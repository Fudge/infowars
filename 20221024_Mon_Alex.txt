[00:00.000 --> 00:21.760]  It's Monday, October 24th, 2022 on this Monday edition, thank you for joining us.
[00:21.760 --> 00:26.960]  I come to the viewers and listeners of this broadcast with extremely grave news.
[00:26.960 --> 00:30.040]  I've looked at all the different angles, played through the different scenarios and
[00:30.040 --> 00:36.080]  analyzed globalist propaganda in Ukraine, going back more than eight years.
[00:36.080 --> 00:41.280]  In fact, longer than that, it was in Zbigniew Brzezinski's plan written in the 1970s to
[00:41.280 --> 00:46.240]  bring down the Soviet Union with a pincer attack by fomenting a rebellion in Afghanistan
[00:46.240 --> 00:48.440]  and also one in Ukraine.
[00:48.440 --> 00:54.240]  Well, decades later, they actually launched the attack in Ukraine overthrowing the elected
[00:54.240 --> 00:55.240]  government.
[00:55.240 --> 00:58.560]  Whether you're for the Russians or against the Russians, it doesn't even matter at this
[00:58.560 --> 00:59.560]  point.
[00:59.560 --> 01:05.240]  Mainline political analysts like Zbigniew Brzezinski's counterpart Henry Kissinger and
[01:05.240 --> 01:10.720]  the Pope and many others, like Benjamin yet and Yahoo of all people, have gone on the
[01:10.720 --> 01:15.800]  news and said, this needs to de-escalate and this needs to stop now because it is going
[01:15.800 --> 01:22.480]  to lead to tactical nuclear weapons and that will probably lead to the use of theater weapons.
[01:22.480 --> 01:25.720]  So when you look at all the different angles surrounding what's currently unfolding in
[01:25.720 --> 01:30.840]  this escalation, I have said many times, and remember I predicted back in October of last
[01:30.840 --> 01:38.600]  year the Russians would invade by February, that they would use a dirty bomb, false flag
[01:38.600 --> 01:46.320]  attack, that is, the globalist NATO, the Ukrainians, as a pretext to bring NATO fully
[01:46.320 --> 01:48.720]  in to the conflict.
[01:48.720 --> 01:56.480]  Now U.S. troops have been massing on the border with Ukraine and they've been training
[01:56.480 --> 02:02.800]  with a multinational force that they're not calling NATO, but is a NATO force.
[02:02.800 --> 02:07.360]  And General Petraeus and other key globalists have been making the rounds on international
[02:07.360 --> 02:13.080]  television and in print saying that if the Russians engage in any radiological dirty
[02:13.080 --> 02:24.040]  bombs or chemical attacks, that's a red line, and the U.S. troops, army forces, the Rangers
[02:24.040 --> 02:30.760]  will then go in directly against the Russians.
[02:30.760 --> 02:37.080]  Petraeus went on to say that – I had a 40-inch slip calling him Petraeus – Petraeus went
[02:37.080 --> 02:43.000]  on to say, the full interviews and articles are on infowars.com, read it and see it for
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.520]  yourself, that this would then escalate the war and would finally defeat Russia, and that
[02:47.520 --> 02:51.000]  even if the U.S. doesn't fully come into the war publicly, Russia's still going to
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.760]  lose, but that he predicts that Russia is going to escalate themselves.
[02:56.760 --> 03:02.040]  So the globalists need a false flag, they need a pretext to openly bring NATO under
[03:02.040 --> 03:08.040]  another name, I quote, multinational force, in to directly engage in a war with the Russians.
[03:08.040 --> 03:13.240]  Now already U.S. troops and advisers and mercenaries have been there for eight years.
[03:13.240 --> 03:16.920]  Already there are special forces troops that have been sheet-dipped into the Ukrainian
[03:16.920 --> 03:20.440]  military leading and coordinating the attacks.
[03:20.440 --> 03:25.440]  We are in a de facto war with Russia right now, and we've definitely sleptwalked into
[03:25.440 --> 03:30.760]  it because even though over 80 percent of Americans in major polls are against the war,
[03:30.760 --> 03:34.000]  they still on average don't see the war as the number one issue.
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.440]  They see inflation, they see crime, they see open borders as the number one issue, and
[03:38.440 --> 03:43.240]  those are certainly bad things being around by the very same WEF, and the globalist great
[03:43.240 --> 03:44.240]  reset agenda.
[03:44.240 --> 03:50.960]  And when you pull back and you understand that the new world order needs a major global
[03:50.960 --> 03:59.520]  crisis on top of the COVID crisis as a smokescreen for their great reset and the establishment
[03:59.520 --> 04:07.000]  of this world ID, new digital global central bank currency, then it all falls into place.
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.800]  Why would they inject billions of people with a poison shot?
[04:10.800 --> 04:12.880]  Why would they already kill tens of millions?
[04:12.880 --> 04:15.720]  Why would they be shutting off the economy and shutting off the pipelines and shutting
[04:15.720 --> 04:16.720]  off the oil drilling?
[04:16.720 --> 04:20.520]  Because it's all part of bringing down civilization.
[04:20.520 --> 04:25.000]  We have to understand they've gone from the test phase of this to the operational phase
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.600]  of this, and that's why we're in so much danger.
[04:27.600 --> 04:33.600]  Now, when we come back, I'm going to explain the rest of the different pieces of evidence
[04:33.600 --> 04:37.840]  we have and break down and predict where this is going, but there's also a good chance
[04:37.840 --> 04:42.880]  for us to stop it if we understand the larger program and raise the alarm as modern polar
[04:42.880 --> 04:43.880]  reveres.
[04:43.880 --> 04:46.680]  We'll be right back on the other side of this live Monday broadcast.
[04:46.680 --> 04:50.800]  Owen Schreuer, a string of amazing guests, your calls and more is coming up.
[04:50.800 --> 04:54.520]  Remember, if you're watching or listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.
[04:54.520 --> 05:00.840]  We are InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[05:00.840 --> 05:01.840]  It's our bestseller.
[05:01.840 --> 05:06.920]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller, but as folks
[05:06.920 --> 05:11.600]  tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy
[05:11.600 --> 05:16.080]  it made them, it has become our number one overall bestseller, and it's been sold out
[05:16.080 --> 05:18.360]  for a while, but it's finally back at stock.
[05:18.360 --> 05:23.840]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[05:23.840 --> 05:24.840]  function of the body.
[05:24.840 --> 05:29.640]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[05:29.640 --> 05:32.200]  need to live and be healthy.
[05:32.200 --> 05:36.600]  Essential means without these things you die, and so much of the food is debased, there's
[05:36.600 --> 05:41.480]  so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our bodies defenses with
[05:41.480 --> 05:42.480]  a product like this.
[05:42.480 --> 05:46.000]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.520]  very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWars, so the only way you lose is
[05:50.520 --> 05:56.000]  not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back at stock at infowarsstore.com

[06:04.000 --> 06:10.520]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty, it's Alex Jones.
[06:10.520 --> 06:19.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us on this live Monday broadcast.
[06:19.920 --> 06:24.480]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, bringing you very, very solemn, very, very serious news.
[06:24.480 --> 06:29.120]  We've been warning in the last eight years that the globalists were planning a NATO-backed
[06:29.120 --> 06:33.960]  war in Ukraine against Russia, and now after the overthrow of the government eight years
[06:33.960 --> 06:39.480]  ago and the escalation of the conflict, the Russians invaded, as we all know, in February,
[06:39.480 --> 06:43.800]  and we predicted in October of last year that would happen by the end of February from our
[06:43.800 --> 06:45.280]  research in Intel.
[06:45.280 --> 06:50.160]  And unfortunately, I've got even worse news for you right now.
[06:50.160 --> 06:52.640]  There's a lot of different factors that go into it, so I'm going to lay them out here
[06:52.640 --> 06:54.600]  and then give you my analysis.
[06:54.600 --> 07:01.720]  And unfortunately, my analysis is about 90% at this point that there's going to be full-on
[07:01.720 --> 07:07.680]  public war with Russia and at least a tactical nuclear war in Europe.
[07:07.680 --> 07:12.520]  And I know that that's the unthinkable, but the reason we know that that's where they're
[07:12.520 --> 07:17.840]  going is the globalists need a smokescreen for the collapse of the world financial system
[07:17.840 --> 07:25.520]  and on its ashes to roll out these central bank programmable digital currencies, which
[07:25.520 --> 07:30.720]  again are not Bitcoin to the opposite that are centralized and controlled, and then they
[07:30.720 --> 07:36.240]  can program how you can use them, where and when.
[07:36.240 --> 07:41.280]  Now let's go back before we talk with the latest developments with Putin and others
[07:41.280 --> 07:45.960]  getting on the phone to world leaders over the weekend and saying they have credible
[07:45.960 --> 07:53.680]  intel that Ukraine backed by NATO groups is set to detonate a dirty bomb, not a tactical
[07:53.680 --> 08:03.720]  nuke, not a nuclear detonation of any type, but a classic radiological bomb where you
[08:03.720 --> 08:13.720]  have a bunch of radiological pieces or parts jacketed with explosives.
[08:13.720 --> 08:20.920]  And that basically makes a large area where it's dispersed, extremely radioactive, similar
[08:20.920 --> 08:25.560]  to when a nuclear reactor melts down.
[08:25.560 --> 08:28.400]  Now let's start walking the pieces here.
[08:28.400 --> 08:35.080]  Sure the Russians came out and warned of that, Zelensky, the dictator now of Ukraine, came
[08:35.080 --> 08:39.920]  out and said, oh that's ridiculous, it's the Russians that are about to do this, we're
[08:39.920 --> 08:42.480]  not going to stage any false flags.
[08:42.480 --> 08:46.160]  Now remember, our corporate media is trying to blame Russia for the pipeline explosion
[08:46.160 --> 08:52.280]  and they even tried to claim Russia was behind the bridge as a false flag, but Ukraine couldn't
[08:52.280 --> 08:56.920]  contain themselves and brag that they'd done it with British intelligence, MI6.
[08:56.920 --> 09:02.600]  So these are all massive escalations, all massive upping the ante.
[09:02.600 --> 09:08.120]  Now we have General Petraeus and a bunch of other globalists all over the news, the articles
[09:08.120 --> 09:17.680]  are on them, FullWars.com saying that there is a multinational group of troops training
[09:17.680 --> 09:26.560]  right now in Poland and in Germany and in other areas made up of Army special operations,
[09:26.560 --> 09:37.200]  Army rangers and others that are preparing to lead a major push into the east of Ukraine
[09:37.200 --> 09:45.280]  in a direct conflict with Russian forces and Petraeus went on to say that all they need
[09:45.280 --> 09:51.360]  is some type of provocation like a chemical or radiological attack, not just a tactical
[09:51.360 --> 09:53.800]  nuclear weapon.
[09:53.800 --> 10:01.080]  So they are telegraphing to the world that these are the red lines just like they said
[10:01.080 --> 10:06.600]  if Assad used chemical weapons in Syria that the U.S. would come into the war openly.
[10:06.600 --> 10:12.160]  Well then we know because the videos came out it was confirmed that UN funded jihadi
[10:12.160 --> 10:18.120]  groups were the ones that launched more than 10 chemical attacks over several years of
[10:18.120 --> 10:26.440]  the Syrian war in an attempt in a false flag to frame the Assad regime as a pretext to
[10:26.440 --> 10:31.320]  again publicly bring not just the U.S. but Israel and NATO into that war.
[10:31.320 --> 10:34.960]  Notice that the controlled western corporate media always criticizes anybody that talks
[10:34.960 --> 10:39.760]  about false flags as if they don't exist, but then on the eve of the Russian invasion
[10:39.760 --> 10:46.160]  in February the CIA spokesperson at the State Department gave a speech and there was a question
[10:46.160 --> 10:50.560]  by reporters where he said the Russians are planning false flags, car bombings and the
[10:50.560 --> 10:56.600]  like as a pretext as their cover to invade Ukraine and indeed there is evidence that
[10:56.600 --> 11:01.960]  the Russians did indeed set off some car bombs and things as a pretext to say that Russian
[11:01.960 --> 11:05.240]  held areas were being attacked and so they had to bring their main military in.
[11:05.240 --> 11:07.760]  The point is these things do go on.
[11:07.760 --> 11:13.400]  And so now you have the Russians saying that we don't want an escalation and NATO wants
[11:13.400 --> 11:18.600]  to fully and publicly come in under the guise of this multinational force that Petraeus
[11:18.600 --> 11:24.040]  and others admit is training, is massing, and is preparing, well then do we believe
[11:24.040 --> 11:28.320]  Putin or do we believe NATO about who may stage this provocation?
[11:28.320 --> 11:29.600]  Well who stands to gain?
[11:29.600 --> 11:34.400]  Who has a motive to bring this multinational force in right when the Russians are trying
[11:34.400 --> 11:44.120]  to mobilize and push back the already covert NATO commanded system with Ukrainian troops,
[11:44.120 --> 11:46.040]  contractors, and others.
[11:46.040 --> 11:50.640]  So obviously who stands to gain is NATO, is the globalist, and they're the ones already
[11:50.640 --> 11:57.880]  putting out the red lines that there is any type of radiological or biological or chemical
[11:57.880 --> 12:03.080]  attack that they will have the pretext to then have open war with Russia already in
[12:03.080 --> 12:04.920]  a de facto war.
[12:04.920 --> 12:09.760]  So the globalists have the history, they have the motives, they have the background of doing
[12:09.760 --> 12:14.320]  things like this and that makes them the prime suspects just like with the destruction of
[12:14.320 --> 12:18.280]  the pipeline, not the Russians.
[12:18.280 --> 12:20.600]  These are just facts.
[12:20.600 --> 12:25.920]  So we have to now pull back and ask why would the multinational combine the New World Order,
[12:25.920 --> 12:29.760]  the Debo Scrooge, and allow the Communist China?
[12:29.760 --> 12:32.920]  Why would they launch this war to begin with?
[12:32.920 --> 12:34.360]  Why would they escalate the war?
[12:34.360 --> 12:41.960]  Why would they put over 100 billion U.S. dollars and over 20 billion euros alone into this
[12:41.960 --> 12:47.760]  proxy war with Russia that is now an admitted open war with the West, with U.S. troops already
[12:47.760 --> 12:53.000]  dying embedded inside Ukrainian forces?
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.920]  Because we're not in Kansas anymore, we're not in Beta anymore, we are in operational
[12:56.920 --> 13:01.400]  mode of the Great Reset and the Build Back Better program.
[13:01.400 --> 13:09.040]  Now I talked about this last 20, I guess it's 30 months or more, it's longer than that
[13:09.040 --> 13:13.680]  now, hard to believe so much time has flown since early 2020.
[13:13.680 --> 13:17.360]  I said when they give people these shots and when it causes heart attacks and blood clots
[13:17.360 --> 13:21.920]  and death, we know it's going to do that from our own documents, they're going to need some
[13:21.920 --> 13:29.480]  giant crisis so big, so horrible, so out of control in the future that as those deaths
[13:29.480 --> 13:35.160]  mount around the world from the shots, we are already in a massive war, or a massive
[13:35.160 --> 13:40.600]  cyber attack that makes the power go off for several months, or I said a new virus, they'll
[13:40.600 --> 13:46.520]  release it's so bad, they can then blame it on the people dying from the poison shot.
[13:46.520 --> 13:53.440]  But I knew that you don't pull off something like this, mass sterilization, mass heart
[13:53.440 --> 13:57.960]  attacks, massive cancer, massive blood clots, you don't pull off something like this now
[13:57.960 --> 14:04.360]  confirmed without having an even bigger, more deadly crisis in the wings that will make you
[14:04.360 --> 14:09.160]  forget about the last thing they did to you, the way to kill a story is with a bigger story.
[14:09.160 --> 14:14.560]  So that's exactly what they're doing now and it helps their entire agenda to smoke screen,
[14:14.560 --> 14:20.560]  the world collapse, the energy prices exploding, the planetary inflation, by blaming Russia
[14:20.560 --> 14:24.200]  and claiming that that's the reason the energy prices have gone up, and we've seen them already
[14:24.200 --> 14:28.640]  do this, so we know they're carrying out this game plan, and that's why it's so easy
[14:28.640 --> 14:31.480]  to predict what they're going to do next.
[14:31.480 --> 14:36.280]  So here's the bottom line, we are at war with Russia, the globalists that control our country
[14:36.280 --> 14:39.720]  are at war with us, they're dissolving our borders, they're dissolving the police, crimes
[14:39.720 --> 14:45.560]  exploding, suicide, everything else, and they are directing the collapse of the third world
[14:45.560 --> 14:50.640]  through the lockdowns that ended a few months ago, they're directing a world crisis where
[14:50.640 --> 14:57.160]  the industrial carrying capacity of the planetary system collapses, causing mass starvation
[14:57.160 --> 15:01.560]  death of the third world, explosive crime and poverty in the United States and Europe,
[15:01.560 --> 15:07.560]  and again out of that, the new older technocrats will pose as the saviors offering the solution,
[15:07.560 --> 15:11.800]  these new global digital currencies with universal basic income that of course have the social
[15:11.800 --> 15:15.960]  credit score and the carbon tax, and it's all being rolled out, it's not my opinion
[15:15.960 --> 15:23.760]  now, what is the solution, what is the answer to counter this, I'll talk about solutions
[15:23.760 --> 15:28.600]  when we come back on the other side of the break, and then Owen Troyer will take over,
[15:28.600 --> 15:34.000]  but please whatever you do today, spread the word about this broadcast, share this analysis
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.080]  once it's posted to Bandai Video, because if more and more of the political system wakes
[15:39.080 --> 15:42.920]  up to what's happening, we won't sleepwalk into destruction, it's a very small group
[15:42.920 --> 15:47.120]  of globalists at the top that are orchestrating all of this, most people in the political
[15:47.120 --> 15:56.440]  and corporate system are unaware it's our job to wake them up, we'll be right back.
[15:56.440 --> 16:05.480]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[16:05.480 --> 16:10.520]  you, and the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly
[16:10.520 --> 16:15.840]  see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[16:15.840 --> 16:20.800]  the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny, that's why
[16:20.800 --> 16:26.640]  it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links from info wars.com and to also
[16:26.640 --> 16:31.160]  financially support info wars.com for the most critical time on our fight by using promo

[19:12.400 --> 19:19.280]  that is info wars, think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and
[19:19.280 --> 19:27.000]  Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards
[19:27.000 --> 19:33.240]  firing up their main base to defeat the new world order, the only reason humanity is still
[19:33.240 --> 19:38.760]  in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken

[19:45.200 --> 19:49.960]  info wars is facing its darkest hours, it isn't going to give up, without your support we
[19:49.960 --> 19:57.080]  can be shut down, please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate
[19:57.080 --> 20:01.080]  for our legal defense fund.
[20:01.080 --> 20:24.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:24.880 --> 20:32.960]  World War III, David Petraeus says U.S. may lead multinational force against Russia in
[20:32.960 --> 20:40.200]  Ukraine, he goes on to say the force is ready and prepared but it won't be NATO, just NATO
[20:40.200 --> 20:46.920]  backed and commanded, that is NATO in direct war in Europe with the Russians.
[20:46.920 --> 20:51.160]  So what are the solutions to stop this, for all the great listeners of the Alex Jones
[20:51.160 --> 20:59.160]  show today, call Congress, call talk show, call university heads, march in the streets,
[20:59.160 --> 21:06.040]  protest, demonstrate, go confront right wing and left wing war mongering politicians like
[21:06.040 --> 21:13.200]  AOC and Ted Cruz and others that are leading us to the brink of World War III, nuclear armageddon.
[21:13.200 --> 21:22.320]  Pray to God for justice in a worldwide awakening and engage in information warfare using articles
[21:22.320 --> 21:27.040]  and videos from infowars.com that detail all this, that predicted all this, to get it out
[21:27.040 --> 21:32.160]  to your friends, your family, your neighbors, perfect strangers and explain to them that
[21:32.160 --> 21:38.160]  this war is the smoke screen to bring in world government and a mark of the beast, castles
[21:38.160 --> 21:45.080]  society that is already here, that's it, explain to people this is a lot bigger than
[21:45.080 --> 21:50.880]  just a regional war in Europe, this could end civilization as we know it but regardless
[21:50.880 --> 21:57.120]  is being used as the cover for the engineered financial collapse.
[21:57.120 --> 22:00.920]  The globalists have built this giant Ponzi scheme, they've bought up almost all the resources,
[22:00.920 --> 22:05.600]  they've doubled and tripled their wealth to last five years by running these scams and
[22:05.600 --> 22:10.240]  I said over and over again they're going to use the virus and then the poison shot rollout
[22:10.240 --> 22:14.960]  to destabilize and break down society and then use an even bigger crisis like war and
[22:14.960 --> 22:20.320]  financial collapse and cyber attacks and power outages as the smoke screen for the last leg
[22:20.320 --> 22:24.280]  of their attack and then what's the third leg?
[22:24.280 --> 22:27.600]  We've already gone through the first, the virus and the deadly shot, now we're going
[22:27.600 --> 22:33.000]  into the war and the energy crisis and what is the third leg?
[22:33.000 --> 22:39.080]  Energy crisis accelerating, power outages, cyber attacks, race war, giant third world
[22:39.080 --> 22:47.680]  caravans, 10, 20, 30, 100 times bigger than the 3, 5, 10, 15, 20,000 person caravans we've
[22:47.680 --> 22:53.880]  seen, caravans of millions completely flooding the western world and bringing us to our knees
[22:53.880 --> 22:57.920]  with the UN overseeing it as the supposed savers.
[22:57.920 --> 23:02.880]  I saw a video over the weekend of the world UN food chief saying we need tens of billions
[23:02.880 --> 23:08.240]  of dollars, we've got hundreds of millions starving to death right now because of COVID.
[23:08.240 --> 23:12.800]  Knows because of the lockdowns that they implemented that they carried out, just like we now see
[23:12.800 --> 23:17.720]  Jake Tapper on CNN saying it's terrible that we made kids wear masks and let them go to
[23:17.720 --> 23:20.800]  school, we hurt them mentally and didn't protect them, it's wrong.
[23:20.800 --> 23:26.200]  The very people that launched all this think that you don't have any memory, think that
[23:26.200 --> 23:31.040]  you're stupid and now they're coming back like the saviors agreeing with you because
[23:31.040 --> 23:34.040]  the general public is awake and realizing who they are.
[23:34.040 --> 23:37.680]  That's why I've said hundreds of times the key to understanding the globalist is having
[23:37.680 --> 23:42.600]  a long term memory and remembering what they said one year versus the next and how they
[23:42.600 --> 23:48.000]  play the good cop and the bad cop, sometimes the very same individuals that are engineering
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.000]  the crisis.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.560]  Here's an example, they tell you oh man make global warming made the Wuhan virus not a
[23:53.560 --> 23:54.560]  lab.
[23:54.560 --> 23:56.760]  Man make global warming is the reason there's wars.
[23:56.760 --> 24:00.000]  Man make global warming is the reason the third world is collapsing when in every case
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.240]  it's been their policies that cause that.
[24:04.240 --> 24:08.840]  We've got to reach out to the people, not just of America, but the people of the world
[24:08.840 --> 24:15.800]  and break down that this is a crisis of biblical proportions as the smoke screen to bring down
[24:15.800 --> 24:21.000]  civilization as we know it and build on its ashes the globalist technocracy.
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.560]  Finally, before Owen Schroyer takes over, I want to thank the listeners for their outpouring
[24:25.560 --> 24:26.560]  of support.
[24:26.560 --> 24:32.200]  I want to thank all of the conservative and populist and nationalist media for their unprecedented
[24:32.200 --> 24:37.040]  defense of infowars and the serious, serious fight we're in and I want the listeners to
[24:37.040 --> 24:44.520]  understand the reason you now see these Democrat party ambulance chasers calling for $2 trillion,
[24:44.520 --> 24:50.960]  $750 billion from this court is because they want to demoralize you and break your way
[24:50.960 --> 24:56.160]  and have numbers so big and so crazy it makes you think there's no way infowars can stay
[24:56.160 --> 24:57.160]  on the air.
[24:57.160 --> 25:03.040]  What you're witnessing is the exact same thing that we see in fiction in Wizard of Oz.
[25:03.040 --> 25:07.840]  In the Wizard of Oz you see the big scream and the big curtain and the big floating
[25:07.840 --> 25:12.000]  head screaming and yelling and trying to scare people and be all powerful when really
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.960]  it's a little man behind the curtain.
[25:14.960 --> 25:18.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we will continue to be on air.
[25:18.880 --> 25:25.240]  We have a program to stay on air through chapter 5 bankruptcy that will allow us to continue
[25:25.240 --> 25:27.080]  on indefinitely.
[25:27.080 --> 25:30.920]  We have at least two years of appeal on these cases as well.
[25:30.920 --> 25:35.680]  That's why they want you to think we're being shut down tomorrow so you give up and stop
[25:35.680 --> 25:37.080]  supporting the broadcast.
[25:37.080 --> 25:40.280]  Now more than ever realize infowars are the tip of the spear.
[25:40.280 --> 25:44.280]  That's why enemies of freedom hate it and that's why you should be sharing the articles
[25:44.280 --> 25:47.480]  and the videos and the reports from band.video and infowars.com.
[25:47.480 --> 25:50.680]  That's why you should be sharing the live show feed with Owen Shroyer coming up and
[25:50.680 --> 25:55.360]  all the big guests he's got because that's what the enemy fears is the truth.
[25:55.360 --> 25:57.280]  The truth is we have power.
[25:57.280 --> 25:59.640]  The truth is the general public wants freedom.
[25:59.640 --> 26:04.280]  The truth is there's a global awakening and the truth is the globalists are scared.
[26:04.280 --> 26:09.400]  So it's all a smoke screen, it's all smoke and mirrors, it's all the Wizard of Oz, writ
[26:09.400 --> 26:15.840]  large as a dying corrupt establishment, attempts to start World War III as a pretext to stay
[26:15.840 --> 26:16.840]  in power.
[26:16.840 --> 26:21.960]  No, their attempt to start World War III will not be our undoing, it will be their undoing.
[26:21.960 --> 26:25.040]  So please take advantage of the biggest sell of the year that has to end in just a few

[27:23.040 --> 27:24.040]  situation was hopeless.
[27:24.040 --> 27:28.680]  I'm going to hand the baton back to Owen Schreuer, I'll have more reports coming up today.
[27:28.680 --> 27:29.680]  God bless my friends.
[27:29.680 --> 27:33.200]  Now's the time to be praying, now's the time to be engaged, now's the time to be exposed

[27:37.760 --> 27:38.760]  God bless and good luck.
[27:38.760 --> 27:47.960]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are now broadcasting live from the Infowars World headquarters
[27:47.960 --> 27:48.960]  here in Austin, Texas.
[27:48.960 --> 27:51.960]  Owen Schreuer with you for the rest of the day.
[27:51.960 --> 27:57.600]  Let me give you a program update on what we have coming up for the remainder of today's
[27:57.600 --> 27:58.600]  live transmissions.
[27:58.600 --> 28:04.280]  Guys, who is hosting the fourth hour today?
[28:04.280 --> 28:08.360]  So we've got the great Gerald Salente hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[28:08.360 --> 28:12.600]  I'm going to be here with you until then, I've got two guests coming up.
[28:12.600 --> 28:18.280]  Drew Hernandez is going to join me in about 30 minutes to talk about his recent news coverage
[28:18.280 --> 28:28.280]  at the border and his crew infiltrating Biden events, infiltrating AOC events and perfectly
[28:28.280 --> 28:31.320]  executing their first amendment right at those events.
[28:31.320 --> 28:39.000]  And then Savannah Hernandez in the one o'clock hour to discuss the sights and sounds from
[28:39.000 --> 28:45.120]  Portland, Oregon, where she followed around some drug addicts that did fentanyl and then
[28:45.120 --> 28:52.240]  went to a Matt Walsh event in Nashville, Tennessee, where the liberal crazies were at it as usual.
[28:52.240 --> 28:56.840]  And then when we come back, I'll get into some of the latest news regarding the midterm
[28:56.840 --> 28:59.640]  elections.
[28:59.640 --> 29:05.760]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[29:05.760 --> 29:11.440]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[29:11.440 --> 29:15.080]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[29:15.080 --> 29:18.600]  They know of the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[29:18.600 --> 29:19.600]  It's came over.
[29:19.600 --> 29:24.600]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[29:24.600 --> 29:29.800]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[29:29.800 --> 29:35.160]  That's why when you share articles and videos from band.video or infowars.com or newswars.com,
[29:35.160 --> 29:36.400]  it changes the world.
[29:36.400 --> 29:41.080]  And that's why when you go to infowars.com and get amazing products that empower you

[30:57.880 --> 30:59.640]  Visit infowars.com right now.
[30:59.640 --> 31:05.560]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[31:05.560 --> 31:10.880]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[31:10.880 --> 31:13.000]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[31:13.000 --> 31:14.360]  That's what they want to take away.
[31:14.360 --> 31:15.800]  Your ability to speak freely.
[31:15.800 --> 31:18.880]  So they're going to go from Mike Lindell next or they're going to go for Steve Bannon
[31:18.880 --> 31:20.440]  or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[31:20.440 --> 31:24.600]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years and I knew they were planning
[31:24.600 --> 31:28.920]  all of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[31:28.920 --> 31:29.920]  your support.
[31:29.920 --> 31:33.720]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America,
[31:33.720 --> 31:37.520]  we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda.
[31:37.520 --> 31:41.160]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful info wars has been
[31:41.160 --> 31:42.840]  because of your past support.
[31:42.840 --> 31:46.640]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[31:46.640 --> 31:51.360]  free double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on

[33:01.160 --> 33:30.160]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:32.160 --> 33:42.000]  I want this to be the framing, to be the context as we go into the political news just 15 days
[33:42.000 --> 33:43.000]  out from the midterms.
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.420]  I'm starting to get a little bit excited about it, if anything just for the closure
[33:46.420 --> 33:52.400]  of the event to happen and to see where the country will go from there.
[33:52.400 --> 33:56.840]  But here's the background, here's the backdrop to me that I think is kind of the most important
[33:56.840 --> 34:03.360]  thing to observe and understand heading into the midterms.
[34:03.360 --> 34:09.120]  Anywhere you go, the raw human intelligence will tell you that the Republicans are going
[34:09.120 --> 34:13.480]  to have big victories and take back Congress in the midterm elections.
[34:13.480 --> 34:22.040]  I can give dozens of examples from my own real world experience and from what we're
[34:22.040 --> 34:26.720]  seeing as far as cultural movements are considered.
[34:26.720 --> 34:28.200]  Let's start with the cultural movements.
[34:28.200 --> 34:35.800]  You've had the Blexit, black Americans leaving the Democrat Party, gained millions of followers.
[34:35.800 --> 34:42.200]  You've had the Lexit, Latino Americans leaving the Democrat Party, gained millions of followers.
[34:42.200 --> 34:47.880]  You now have the Jexit, Jewish Americans leaving the Democrat Party, that's gaining traction
[34:47.880 --> 34:49.400]  now as well.
[34:49.400 --> 34:54.720]  You've had the walk away movement, millions of liberal Democrats leaving the Democrat
[34:54.720 --> 34:55.720]  Party.
[34:55.720 --> 35:00.080]  You've had groups that aren't necessarily political, but you know where their politics
[35:00.080 --> 35:06.800]  lie now, like gays against groomers with LGBTQ members that don't even claim to be part of
[35:06.800 --> 35:07.800]  that community.
[35:07.800 --> 35:08.800]  They just live their lives.
[35:08.800 --> 35:11.080]  They just want to live free and prosper.
[35:11.080 --> 35:16.680]  They are abandoning the Democrat Party policies and politics and will obviously not be voting
[35:16.680 --> 35:18.200]  Democrat.
[35:18.200 --> 35:24.240]  You've got huge influencers like Elon Musk saying vote Republican, Joe Rogan saying vote
[35:24.240 --> 35:25.240]  Republican.
[35:25.240 --> 35:30.400]  They gathered leaving the Democrat Party and so much more.
[35:30.400 --> 35:36.960]  So that's just kind of the cultural movements, political movements that you see.
[35:36.960 --> 35:44.200]  On an individual level, I don't know if you've been experiencing this as I have, but I just
[35:44.200 --> 35:47.880]  don't find any Democrat support anywhere I go.
[35:47.880 --> 35:53.560]  And I understand that, you know, obviously I try to avoid leftists, liberals, Democrats
[35:53.560 --> 35:57.520]  like the plague for obvious reasons for the warnings I give you on the air.
[35:57.520 --> 36:00.160]  These people could go psycho at any given time.
[36:00.160 --> 36:02.960]  Literally, they could have a psychotic break at any given time.
[36:02.960 --> 36:11.720]  Like for example, did you know that girl who got famous, she was an E-celeb, she'd get
[36:11.720 --> 36:18.160]  on social media, get half naked and then support Bernie Sanders and she had that famous okay
[36:18.160 --> 36:19.160]  boomer video.
[36:19.160 --> 36:20.160]  Do you guys remember that?
[36:20.160 --> 36:21.160]  Do you guys remember that?
[36:21.160 --> 36:26.200]  Once she got charged with the violent assault of her ex-boyfriend, telling you folks these
[36:26.200 --> 36:27.720]  people can break in any moment.
[36:27.720 --> 36:29.540]  So the average person knows that now.
[36:29.540 --> 36:38.040]  But I go out in public, I have general conversations with individuals and they all are just like
[36:38.040 --> 36:42.520]  Democrat Party politics is like poison or it's like don't touch the lava.
[36:42.520 --> 36:46.520]  Like the game you used to play as a kid, like oh, jump around, don't touch the lava.
[36:46.520 --> 36:48.720]  Democrat Party politics are like don't touch the lava.
[36:48.720 --> 36:51.400]  Yeah, I don't like trans kids.
[36:51.400 --> 36:53.280]  I don't want to chop up little boys and girls.
[36:53.280 --> 36:55.080]  Yeah, you know what?
[36:55.080 --> 36:58.720]  The issue of abortion is tough, but I'm not going to sit here and praise abortion.
[36:58.720 --> 37:01.200]  I'm not going to sit here and celebrate baby murder.
[37:01.200 --> 37:03.480]  We went out in the truck yesterday.
[37:03.480 --> 37:07.000]  You may have seen the video, it's up at Band Out Video, the HD video is at Band Out Video,
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.960]  the full stream, which is more than two hours long, two live streams on my getter account
[37:11.960 --> 37:14.080]  at all I do is own.
[37:14.080 --> 37:22.200]  Obviously it's about a 50-50 split from the public response in support or they hate us.
[37:22.200 --> 37:25.280]  When we went out and you can see it in the live stream, yeah, obviously you've got the
[37:25.280 --> 37:29.480]  people flicking us off and spitting at us and cursing at us, that's always going to
[37:29.480 --> 37:30.480]  be the case.
[37:30.480 --> 37:31.880]  It was busy downtown.
[37:31.880 --> 37:38.000]  But I would say nine of the 10 people yesterday were in support of what we were doing.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.880]  And we obviously in the final upload video, you know, we show you the middle finger people
[37:41.880 --> 37:44.720]  and we show you a lot of people screaming because it's a little more entertaining.
[37:44.720 --> 37:47.720]  It's a little fun to show how psychotic these people are.
[37:47.720 --> 37:52.800]  But the truth is if you go watch the longer live streams that are hours long, you'll see
[37:52.800 --> 37:55.680]  that most people are in support of us.
[37:55.680 --> 37:57.280]  Most people agree with what we're saying now.
[37:57.280 --> 38:02.360]  I'm getting my hair cut today and everyone in the barber shop, it used to be just me
[38:02.360 --> 38:07.320]  and my barber would kind of talk shop on politics and really get conspiratorial.
[38:07.320 --> 38:09.600]  Now everyone's getting conspiratorial.
[38:09.600 --> 38:13.240]  Now everyone's like, yeah, I used to think conspiracy theorists were crazy, but now I
[38:13.240 --> 38:15.640]  think you guys are right on about everything.
[38:15.640 --> 38:18.440]  That's how crazy it's become.
[38:18.440 --> 38:22.920]  Now I can go on, I've got other personal examples, but I'll just stop right there.
[38:22.920 --> 38:26.320]  And so I'm sure you've been experiencing something similar.
[38:26.320 --> 38:29.800]  I don't think my life experience is too much different than yours other than what I just
[38:29.800 --> 38:34.560]  go through for working here and being a talk show host.
[38:34.560 --> 38:38.520]  So everywhere you turn, everywhere you look, the awakening is certainly on.
[38:38.520 --> 38:43.840]  They've got another story in the Washington Post today attacking the reawaken America
[38:43.840 --> 38:47.240]  tour because it's so popular.
[38:47.240 --> 38:51.000]  You don't have anything like this on the Democrat side of the aisle.
[38:51.000 --> 38:57.880]  There's no mass exodus of the Republican party of any sect of the American population.
[38:57.880 --> 39:03.200]  You don't have any big tours promoting Democrat party values that are going on that are successful
[39:03.200 --> 39:04.200]  right now.
[39:04.200 --> 39:05.800]  It just doesn't exist.
[39:05.800 --> 39:10.480]  So I say that because you need to know that, you need to understand that, you need to remember
[39:10.480 --> 39:15.800]  that and you need to know that you should believe your eyes.
[39:15.800 --> 39:17.680]  You should believe your ears.
[39:17.680 --> 39:23.320]  You should believe the world in front of you because part of the mainstream media is don't
[39:23.320 --> 39:27.320]  believe your line eyes, believe us.
[39:27.320 --> 39:32.400]  So if Democrats win in the midterms, they'll tell you, hey, ignore the facts that you can't
[39:32.400 --> 39:34.800]  find a person that votes Democrat.
[39:34.800 --> 39:38.280]  Ignore the facts that millions of people are leaving the Democrat party.
[39:38.280 --> 39:43.600]  Ignore the facts that even in the midterm elections, in the primaries, more Republican
[39:43.600 --> 39:45.760]  voters turned out than Democrats.
[39:45.760 --> 39:50.640]  And when that all goes sideways in the midterm elections coming up in 15 days, they'll say,
[39:50.640 --> 39:52.400]  nope, this is legitimate.
[39:52.400 --> 39:57.960]  And just like in 2020, when you had a million people in Washington, DC, realizing the election
[39:57.960 --> 40:04.000]  was stolen from Trump, you will have that same phenomenon, except it will be millions
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.520]  more people that now realize our elections cannot be trusted.
[40:07.520 --> 40:11.840]  Now, I'm not saying people are going to go to DC, I don't expect that to happen.
[40:11.840 --> 40:16.000]  But I do expect the awakening, I do expect more people to realize it now than ever before.
[40:16.000 --> 40:23.600]  In fact, Ted Cruz was on the view today, and maybe we'll have this clip coming up, and
[40:23.600 --> 40:28.360]  they're attacking Ted Cruz about Republican election deniers.
[40:28.360 --> 40:33.680]  And Ted Cruz says, hey, wait a second, Hillary Clinton denied the results of the 2016 presidential
[40:33.680 --> 40:37.440]  election, Stacey Abrams denied the results of her election, and the view said, yeah,
[40:37.440 --> 40:42.120]  because those elections were illegitimate, beautiful, perfect.
[40:42.120 --> 40:43.120]  Thank you so much.
[40:43.120 --> 40:45.360]  So when a Republican wins, it's illegitimate.
[40:45.360 --> 40:48.080]  When a Democrat wins, it's all above board.
[40:48.080 --> 40:51.080]  We always knew that that was their logic.
[40:51.080 --> 40:52.080]  Now they just admit it.
[40:52.080 --> 40:56.440]  So Democrats are allowed to question elections, you're not.
[40:56.440 --> 40:59.240]  But let's look at Joe Biden here.
[40:59.240 --> 41:01.000]  Let's look at Joe Biden.
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.160]  Now he says he's running again, and I guess that's the truth, I guess he does plan on
[41:07.160 --> 41:08.160]  running again.
[41:08.160 --> 41:14.800]  They have started the Biden pack and everything you normally do in this time space to run
[41:14.800 --> 41:17.080]  for president.
[41:17.080 --> 41:22.560]  But here he is in a clip saying that he could drop dead tomorrow.
[41:22.560 --> 41:26.920]  So how can Joe Biden run for president in two years if he thinks he's going to drop
[41:26.920 --> 41:30.360]  dead tomorrow, like he says here in clip two?
[41:30.360 --> 41:32.920]  So let's say Trump doesn't run again.
[41:32.920 --> 41:36.240]  Convince on Gloria that she's just sick with you.
[41:36.240 --> 41:39.280]  Well, I think Gloria should take a look.
[41:39.280 --> 41:44.640]  I think it's a legitimate thing to be concerned about anyone's age, including mine.
[41:44.640 --> 41:46.080]  I think that's totally legitimate.
[41:46.080 --> 41:54.920]  But I think the best way to make the judgment is to watch me, am I slowing up, and I don't
[41:54.920 --> 41:58.280]  have the same pace.
[41:58.280 --> 42:09.120]  And that old joke, everybody talks about the new 70s, 50s and all that stuff, I'm a great
[42:09.120 --> 42:10.760]  specter of faith.
[42:10.760 --> 42:13.480]  I could get a disease tomorrow.
[42:13.480 --> 42:16.400]  I could drop dead tomorrow.
[42:16.400 --> 42:24.840]  But in terms of my energy level, in terms of how much I'm able to do, I think people
[42:24.840 --> 42:30.080]  should look and say, they still have the same passion for what he's doing.
[42:30.080 --> 42:32.520]  And if they think I do, I can do it, then that's fine.
[42:32.520 --> 42:34.360]  If they don't, then they should vote against me.
[42:34.360 --> 42:35.360]  Not against me.
[42:35.360 --> 42:37.760]  It should encourage me not to go.
[42:37.760 --> 42:40.080]  But that's not how I feel.
[42:40.080 --> 42:42.560]  I can't even say the age I'm going to be.
[42:42.560 --> 42:47.600]  Well, well, well, Joe, hands to yourself, Joe, and then he goes in for the rub job on
[42:47.600 --> 42:50.040]  the neck of that reporter.
[42:50.040 --> 42:51.560]  He can't keep his hands off of people.
[42:51.560 --> 42:55.000]  He can't keep his hands on himself, and he says, am I slowing down?
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  I'm doing great.
[42:56.000 --> 42:57.000]  My energy level is high.
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.600]  I could drop dead tomorrow, but vote for me.
[42:59.600 --> 43:05.760]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[43:05.760 --> 43:11.400]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[43:11.400 --> 43:15.040]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[43:15.040 --> 43:18.560]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[43:18.560 --> 43:24.040]  Things came over, and all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting
[43:24.040 --> 43:25.040]  back.
[43:25.040 --> 43:29.800]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[43:29.800 --> 43:35.160]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com,
[43:35.160 --> 43:36.160]  it changes the world.
[43:36.160 --> 43:41.200]  And that's why when you go to infowarstore.com and get amazing products that empower you and
[43:41.200 --> 43:45.720]  your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the
[43:45.720 --> 43:48.280]  tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[43:48.280 --> 43:54.440]  The fight starts at infowars.com and the support of the fight starts at infowarstore.com.
[43:54.440 --> 43:59.880]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[43:59.880 --> 44:01.720]  Look around you.
[44:01.720 --> 44:04.960]  Everything I predicted from the globalist stone documents from their own admissions
[44:04.960 --> 44:06.560]  is now happening.
[44:06.560 --> 44:08.120]  Infowars credibility.
[44:08.120 --> 44:12.560]  My credibility has never been higher, and it's because of your backing of this operation
[44:12.560 --> 44:18.160]  that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the loss
[44:18.160 --> 44:24.400]  that stay on air, but now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[44:24.400 --> 44:29.720]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[44:29.720 --> 44:33.560]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced
[44:33.560 --> 44:39.160]  by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[44:39.160 --> 44:40.160]  It's unsustainable.
[44:40.160 --> 44:48.120]  So please visit saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations for
[44:48.120 --> 44:52.680]  $5, $10, $500, whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere.
[44:52.680 --> 44:53.680]  I'll never give up.
[44:53.680 --> 44:55.920]  I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[44:55.920 --> 44:57.200]  Thank you for your support.
[44:57.200 --> 44:59.840]  Would me or without you, saveinfowars.com.
[44:59.840 --> 45:04.640]  Think about a world without info wars.
[45:04.640 --> 45:08.960]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[45:08.960 --> 45:14.280]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is info wars.
[45:14.280 --> 45:19.400]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and
[45:19.400 --> 45:26.880]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[45:26.880 --> 45:30.400]  main base to defeat the New World Order.
[45:30.400 --> 45:36.160]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[45:36.160 --> 45:40.640]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[45:40.640 --> 45:42.360]  I don't take the credit.
[45:42.360 --> 45:44.240]  I give you the credit.
[45:44.240 --> 45:46.640]  Now info wars is facing its darkest hours.
[45:46.640 --> 45:48.560]  It isn't going to give up.
[45:48.560 --> 45:50.360]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[45:50.360 --> 45:59.800]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.

[47:29.960 --> 47:37.280]  All the Fox News shows double and triple the audience size of all the other nightly news
[47:37.280 --> 47:38.280]  shows out there.
[47:38.280 --> 47:43.700]  I mean, hell, this audience, the info wars audience, which is, I mean, these transmissions
[47:43.700 --> 47:47.600]  have been completely banned across the internet.
[47:47.600 --> 47:53.720]  We have a bigger audience than most mainstream Democrats do, like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton,
[47:53.720 --> 47:58.960]  they go launch podcasts and nobody listens, nobody.
[47:58.960 --> 48:02.520]  They try to get $2.75 trillion from Alex Jones.
[48:02.520 --> 48:05.200]  Our audience just gets bigger.
[48:05.200 --> 48:06.760]  But that's just a little addition.
[48:06.760 --> 48:09.800]  Now I want to get back to the subject matter.
[48:09.800 --> 48:13.840]  So you just heard Joe Biden say he could drop dead any day, but he's running for office.
[48:13.840 --> 48:16.180]  He says, look at my speed.
[48:16.180 --> 48:19.360]  Look at how great I'm doing.
[48:19.360 --> 48:20.880]  You forget where you are half the time.
[48:20.880 --> 48:22.240]  You're lost half the time.
[48:22.240 --> 48:24.400]  You spend a quarter of the time on vacation.
[48:24.400 --> 48:28.200]  Yeah, we've noticed, Joe, we've believed me.
[48:28.200 --> 48:30.320]  We've noticed.
[48:30.320 --> 48:35.560]  And he gets confused again here talking about the student loan bailout.
[48:35.560 --> 48:37.280]  So this is going back and forth in the courts.
[48:37.280 --> 48:38.280]  It's illegal.
[48:38.280 --> 48:39.280]  It's legal.
[48:39.280 --> 48:40.280]  It's illegal.
[48:40.280 --> 48:41.280]  It's legal.
[48:41.280 --> 48:44.240]  It's just going back and forth in the courts like a ping pong ball.
[48:44.240 --> 48:46.000]  And then the truth is, it doesn't even matter.
[48:46.000 --> 48:52.280]  The Democrat voter is so stupid that all Biden has to say is, I pass student loan forgiveness
[48:52.280 --> 48:54.760]  and they'll just believe it, whether it happens or not.
[48:54.760 --> 49:00.240]  In fact, over the weekend, there were a bunch of the Democrat propaganda Twitter accounts.
[49:00.240 --> 49:02.240]  They all got invited to the White House.
[49:02.240 --> 49:05.960]  They get paid to promote Democrat Party propaganda on Twitter, Twitter then forces that into
[49:05.960 --> 49:06.960]  your newsfeed.
[49:06.960 --> 49:08.640]  Whether you follow them, block them, it doesn't matter.
[49:08.640 --> 49:16.720]  So everyone's getting Democrat propaganda forced into their news feeds while Republican
[49:16.720 --> 49:19.800]  candidates are banned and can't even get into your newsfeed.
[49:19.800 --> 49:22.080]  It's just forced propaganda.
[49:22.080 --> 49:27.920]  And one of them said, oh, my daughter just got her student loan forgiven and now she's
[49:27.920 --> 49:29.800]  going to buy a new house.
[49:29.800 --> 49:35.200]  And then people were responding saying, but they didn't issue the student loan debt relief.
[49:35.200 --> 49:36.640]  It hasn't happened yet.
[49:36.640 --> 49:39.120]  And then that individual had to say, okay, yeah, that's true.
[49:39.120 --> 49:40.600]  Yeah, I made it up.
[49:40.600 --> 49:42.200]  They just made crap up.
[49:42.200 --> 49:44.800]  It's like, oh, yeah, my daughter got student loan debt forgiveness.
[49:44.800 --> 49:45.800]  Now she can buy a house.
[49:45.800 --> 49:46.800]  Yeah, it never happened.
[49:46.800 --> 49:47.800]  He just made the whole thing up.
[49:47.800 --> 49:50.000]  That's what they do.
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.840]  So now he's lying about the student loan bailout and saying it got passed in Congress.
[49:54.840 --> 49:56.040]  Never went to Congress.
[49:56.040 --> 49:57.240]  Never got voted on.
[49:57.240 --> 50:00.400]  But here he is claiming that in clip six.
[50:00.400 --> 50:04.760]  Secondly, if you don't have one of those loans, you just get 10,000 written off.
[50:04.760 --> 50:05.760]  It's passed.
[50:05.760 --> 50:08.960]  I got it passed by a voter to know there was no vote.
[50:08.960 --> 50:09.960]  Never went to Congress.
[50:09.960 --> 50:11.920]  A total lie.
[50:11.920 --> 50:15.520]  And I don't think I don't know if we have this one guys.
[50:15.520 --> 50:18.960]  I don't see it on the video list, but I've got the news headline here.
[50:18.960 --> 50:22.080]  It was part of the same interview from before where he said he could drop dead from Joe
[50:22.080 --> 50:24.920]  Biden, Joe Biden on Kamala Harris.
[50:24.920 --> 50:26.480]  She's smart as hell.
[50:26.480 --> 50:31.440]  She has a backbone of a ramrod.
[50:31.440 --> 50:33.600]  Does anybody know what that means?
[50:33.600 --> 50:38.320]  Maybe we could ask Montell Jordan or was it Montell Jordan that was was running around
[50:38.320 --> 50:40.800]  with the bimbo Kamala?
[50:40.800 --> 50:41.800]  Yeah.
[50:41.800 --> 50:42.800]  Yeah.
[50:42.800 --> 50:43.800]  Kamala was looking good.
[50:43.800 --> 50:44.800]  Wouldn't she?
[50:44.800 --> 50:45.800]  Bimbo Kamala.
[50:45.800 --> 50:50.760]  Maybe he can tell us if Kamala has the backbone of a ramrod.
[50:50.760 --> 50:52.720]  Not sure what that means from Joe Biden.
[50:52.720 --> 50:56.520]  He might not be so sure either.
[50:56.520 --> 51:01.480]  Now I'm going to come back to this issue later, maybe on the war room or maybe later on the
[51:01.480 --> 51:02.480]  Jones show.
[51:02.480 --> 51:05.600]  But I want to play the clip now before I get into the rest of the political news here.
[51:05.600 --> 51:10.480]  So your border is wide open, record amount of illegal immigrants coming through.
[51:10.480 --> 51:12.400]  You've got record high inflation.
[51:12.400 --> 51:15.120]  You've got record high consumer price index growth.
[51:15.120 --> 51:18.720]  Sky producer price index growth.
[51:18.720 --> 51:21.640]  Violent crime is skyrocketing across the country.
[51:21.640 --> 51:23.440]  We've got supply chain problems.
[51:23.440 --> 51:28.120]  I mean, just disaster on top of disaster on top of disaster here in the Biden administration.
[51:28.120 --> 51:32.120]  But Biden has his priorities straight, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:32.120 --> 51:38.440]  And so he wants you to know that sex reassignment surgery and puberty blockers for kids is a
[51:38.440 --> 51:40.720]  top issue of the Democrats heading into midterms.
[51:40.720 --> 51:47.280]  So he brought in a man dressed as a woman to really hammer that point home here in clip
[51:47.280 --> 51:48.280]  four.
[51:48.280 --> 51:52.800]  Do you think states should have a right to ban gender affirming health care?
[51:52.800 --> 51:56.760]  I don't think any state or anybody should have the right to do that.
[51:56.760 --> 52:01.040]  As a moral question, as a legal question, I just think it's wrong.
[52:01.040 --> 52:03.440]  It's the big issue.
[52:03.440 --> 52:08.400]  The big issue is chopping up little boys and girls' body parts and aborting little babies
[52:08.400 --> 52:09.800]  and selling their body parts.
[52:09.800 --> 52:10.880]  That's what the Democrats are all about.
[52:10.880 --> 52:15.720]  So they bring a guy dressed as a woman to tell you how important it is.
[52:15.720 --> 52:17.560]  That's the Democrat Party.
[52:17.560 --> 52:21.160]  And they think that that's going to have them get political victories.
[52:21.160 --> 52:24.220]  And we all know that that's not what's going to lead to the political victories.
[52:24.220 --> 52:26.000]  It's the voter fraud.
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.720]  But I'll come back to that issue later because they really care about it a lot.
[52:28.720 --> 52:34.160]  They really like chopping up little boys and girls either in the womb or out of the womb.
[52:34.160 --> 52:36.360]  But here's some of the other news.
[52:36.360 --> 52:38.960]  Just two weeks out from the midterms.
[52:38.960 --> 52:46.720]  Chuck Todd, Meet the Press, new NBC poll, red flag for the Democrats ahead of midterms.
[52:46.720 --> 52:50.720]  71% of Americans say U.S. is on the wrong track.
[52:50.720 --> 52:52.320]  Boy, oh boy.
[52:52.320 --> 52:54.920]  What could make them believe that?
[52:54.920 --> 52:58.800]  The record high violent crime, the record high inflation, the supply chain crisis, close
[52:58.800 --> 53:03.880]  to World War III, wide open borders, fentanyl overdoses, becoming the leading cause of death
[53:03.880 --> 53:05.600]  amongst middle-aged men.
[53:05.600 --> 53:06.920]  What could it possibly be?
[53:06.920 --> 53:12.280]  Of course, all Democrat party policies.
[53:12.280 --> 53:13.880]  And this is what they're really panicked about.
[53:13.880 --> 53:19.760]  And we're going to be monitoring, apparently, Merritt Garland, that goon is going to be
[53:19.760 --> 53:25.240]  having a press conference in about 40 minutes or so about the upcoming elections.
[53:25.240 --> 53:28.120]  And they're going to probably claim that Russia is getting ready to steal it for the Republicans
[53:28.120 --> 53:29.120]  or something.
[53:29.120 --> 53:34.960]  Or maybe they'll address the poll watchers, the ballot drop box watchers.
[53:34.960 --> 53:40.840]  New York judge rules that continue to absentee mail-in voting based on COVID is unconstitutional.
[53:40.840 --> 53:48.480]  Now, if it's unconstitutional now, which it is, it was unconstitutional then in 2020.
[53:48.480 --> 53:50.160]  And it was.
[53:50.160 --> 53:52.000]  And that's what Trump was arguing.
[53:52.000 --> 53:56.960]  That's what we wanted to be presented on January 6 to Congress to say, look, look at all the
[53:56.960 --> 54:03.360]  unconstitutional rulings that were made just ahead of the presidential elections to get
[54:03.360 --> 54:09.040]  millions of mail-in ballots that shouldn't have counted and all this other crap.
[54:09.040 --> 54:12.560]  And that's why the Democrats wanted the violence that day.
[54:12.560 --> 54:16.400]  That's why the Democrats led the violence that day, stood down the National Guard, stood
[54:16.400 --> 54:17.600]  down the police.
[54:17.600 --> 54:20.640]  Nancy Pelosi had the documentary film crew ready to go.
[54:20.640 --> 54:24.440]  I mean, folks, that was the ultimate proof that the Democrats knew this whole thing and
[54:24.440 --> 54:26.240]  it was their operation from the beginning.
[54:26.240 --> 54:32.560]  Nancy Pelosi had a documentary film crew with her on January 6 to film all their madness.
[54:32.560 --> 54:34.960]  I mean, think about that.
[54:34.960 --> 54:40.720]  And let's say that, let's just pretend for a second that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer
[54:40.720 --> 54:45.000]  had no idea that January 6 was going to go into violence like that.
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.800]  Why would they keep their documentary crew there and filming if it was an insurrection
[54:49.800 --> 54:51.440]  and it was so dangerous for them?
[54:51.440 --> 54:52.600]  They knew it never was.
[54:52.600 --> 54:54.480]  They knew they had control over the whole thing.
[54:54.480 --> 54:57.880]  They knew as soon as they sent out the emergency alert, everybody would went home just like
[54:57.880 --> 54:58.880]  they did.
[54:58.880 --> 55:03.400]  The Democrats ran the January 6 insurrection, not Donald Trump and Republicans, but now
[55:03.400 --> 55:06.920]  I'll be considered a terrorist for saying that and they may come bust into the studio
[55:06.920 --> 55:11.320]  and arrest me because don't you know we live in the Democrat Party fascist authoritarian
[55:11.320 --> 55:12.320]  state now.
[55:12.320 --> 55:20.120]  So okay, mail-in voting is unconstitutional now and it was in 2020 as well.
[55:20.120 --> 55:28.080]  Now here's what I think is going on because you probably saw, now look, there are multiple
[55:28.080 --> 55:33.280]  groups, some of them directly affiliated with the Republican Party, others just independent
[55:33.280 --> 55:39.080]  groups that are watching the ballot drop boxes.
[55:39.080 --> 55:44.480]  And of course this is all after the film, the documentary film 2000 Mules showed how
[55:44.480 --> 55:49.640]  cheating happened in the 2020 election with the drop boxes.
[55:49.640 --> 55:55.400]  Now these groups, none of them, all of them have the same policy which is we don't, we
[55:55.400 --> 56:01.040]  don't confront any individuals that we think might be up to criminal activity at the mail-in
[56:01.040 --> 56:02.040]  drop boxes.
[56:02.040 --> 56:03.120]  We don't confront them.
[56:03.120 --> 56:08.800]  So for example, somebody drives up multiple times to the mail-in drop box with their license
[56:08.800 --> 56:13.720]  plate covered, they just film it, they just capture on camera and that's it.
[56:13.720 --> 56:16.720]  No confrontation, no nothing.
[56:16.720 --> 56:20.040]  And this is going on all around the country, the New York Times, the Washington Post, they've
[56:20.040 --> 56:22.960]  all written stories about how worried they are about that because they know they're going
[56:22.960 --> 56:27.160]  to use the mail-in ballots to cheat and they're going to get caught again.
[56:27.160 --> 56:32.200]  So what they did, and this is what I believe, I believe because there's one group, there's
[56:32.200 --> 56:40.760]  one image now going everywhere of two supposed mail-in drop box watchers sitting in military
[56:40.760 --> 56:46.440]  garb, full-on military garb with weapons and their faces covered and now all the Democrats
[56:46.440 --> 56:50.880]  are saying look at this, Republican terrorists, look at this, voter intimidation.
[56:50.880 --> 56:53.440]  I believe that's a false flat.
[56:53.440 --> 56:58.360]  I don't know of any poll watchers, I don't know of any mail-in drop box watchers that
[56:58.360 --> 57:04.000]  go out there in military garb and cover their faces and that's not what any of the groups
[57:04.000 --> 57:11.320]  that are running these mail-in drop box watching initiatives have told them to do.
[57:11.320 --> 57:15.440]  They've always said no, don't dress like you're in military, don't cover your face, don't
[57:15.440 --> 57:20.480]  brandish a firearm, don't confront these people and then those individuals somehow are the
[57:20.480 --> 57:24.880]  only two that have ever been filmed, ever been caught on camera and then every Democrat
[57:24.880 --> 57:27.040]  is complaining about it.
[57:27.040 --> 57:30.120]  To me that has false flag written all over it and then if they make the press conference
[57:30.120 --> 57:31.880]  about it today, I think that confirms it.
[57:31.880 --> 57:36.920]  So until I hear from that group, those two individuals or somebody that claims that they
[57:36.920 --> 57:42.400]  were officially watching drop boxes for that group, I believe those are Democrat party
[57:42.400 --> 57:47.560]  operatives out there to start the narrative that Republicans are engaging in voter intimidation
[57:47.560 --> 57:48.840]  at the drop boxes.
[57:48.840 --> 57:55.120]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[57:55.120 --> 58:00.360]  you and the globalist number one mission is to silence Info Wars because they rightly
[58:00.360 --> 58:05.680]  see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America but
[58:05.680 --> 58:09.880]  the world, to the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.

[58:55.720 --> 59:00.240]  on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to
[59:00.240 --> 59:02.880]  their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[59:02.880 --> 59:06.560]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[59:06.560 --> 59:11.280]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people
[59:11.280 --> 59:15.240]  don't listen and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[59:15.240 --> 59:20.680]  I lead an incredibly stressful life, I don't play with Mr. Health but if I wasn't taking
[59:20.680 --> 59:27.040]  products like X3 from infowars.com I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[59:27.040 --> 59:32.200]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible and despite the
[59:32.200 --> 59:38.520]  fact that selling out X3 is 50% off right now exclusively at infowars.com.
[59:38.520 --> 59:41.400]  It's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war.
[59:41.400 --> 59:42.400]  We're not selling it for that.
[59:42.400 --> 59:45.880]  We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.
[59:45.880 --> 59:52.040]  Get X3 today, 50% off at infowars.com all supplies last.
[59:52.040 --> 1:00:06.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:12.200]  So Republicans, conservatives, Americans have organized after seeing the documentary
[1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:19.760]  film 2000 mules groups to legally, lawfully, peacefully watch mail-in drop boxes to keep
[1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:24.840]  an eye out for any voter fraud and they all have the same priorities, they all have the
[1:00:24.840 --> 1:00:27.360]  same initiatives told to them.
[1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:32.040]  We don't confront, we don't finish firearms, we don't cover our faces, we don't do anything
[1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:33.040]  illegal.
[1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:36.960]  We do everything by the books and if we see something sketchy or illegal, we just film
[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:39.120]  it, that's it.
[1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:42.640]  And so now all of a sudden you've got this image that every Democrat is sharing, that
[1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:46.920]  every Democrat is complaining about voter intimidation on and now I suspect Merrick
[1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:51.440]  Garland about to have a press conference on, two individuals brandishing firearms, full
[1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:58.880]  military garb, sitting outside of a mail-in drop box with their faces covered.
[1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:04.480]  Now again, no group has claimed that these individuals are working for them, I've not
[1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:08.840]  seen these individuals come out and make any statements about their activities either,
[1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:12.760]  so I'm suspicious that these are Democrat party operatives out there.
[1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:18.160]  Now again, I don't know that, I just know that that's what the Democrats would do if
[1:01:18.160 --> 1:01:24.800]  they were afraid that their big voter fraud scheme at the drop boxes was going to be exposed
[1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:26.280]  and shut down.
[1:01:26.280 --> 1:01:31.920]  They would find some way to shut down the drop box watchers and this would be the means
[1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:33.520]  to do so.
[1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:38.880]  So that's my suspicion here, especially after you've seen all the attacks on watching the
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:45.360]  mail-in drop boxes and then every single Democrat sharing that image as if that's the only,
[1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:48.040]  those are the only two people that have ever watched a mail-in drop box, that's not the
[1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:50.880]  case, there's hundreds of them out there if not more.
[1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:56.880]  But the real question would be, why would you be so concerned about people watching
[1:01:56.880 --> 1:01:58.600]  mail-in ballot drop boxes?
[1:01:58.600 --> 1:02:00.040]  Why would that scare you so much?
[1:02:00.040 --> 1:02:03.680]  Well the answer's obvious because that's how they plan to cheat.
[1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:09.160]  Now Trump had a rally over the weekend in Romstown, Texas and he said the problem with
[1:02:09.160 --> 1:02:14.800]  the US media is that they won't talk about the massive corruption in the 2020 election,
[1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:18.920]  well that's because they were a part of it.
[1:02:18.920 --> 1:02:25.200]  So of course that's because they were a part of it.
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:29.280]  We're looking at something very different, the press being part of the intelligence community,
[1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:32.840]  Lee Smith describes the latest role of fake news.
[1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:36.800]  You have to make the understanding here and most in this audience already have, you have
[1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:42.640]  to make the understanding, you're not watching the news, you're watching party propaganda,
[1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:45.720]  you're watching state government, state propaganda.
[1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:50.800]  When you watch MSNBC, when you watch CNN, when you watch most of the nightly news programs,
[1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:54.360]  you're not watching news, you're watching fake news, but even fake news isn't the right
[1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:55.360]  way to cover it.
[1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:58.560]  You're watching state-run propaganda.
[1:02:58.560 --> 1:03:01.520]  That's what it is and Americans are starting to understand this now.
[1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:05.600]  So yeah, they were in on the big, on the big steal.
[1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:13.480]  That's why Ted Cruz gets Whoopi Goldberg to admit that when they deny election results
[1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:16.720]  it's fine, but when you do it, it's bad.
[1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:20.560]  So here's Ted Cruz on the view of getting Whoopi Goldberg to make that stunning admission
[1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:21.560]  right here.
[1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:44.600]  No, you know, here's the thing.
[1:03:44.600 --> 1:03:48.480]  We may not like when Republicans win, but we don't go and we don't storm.
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:49.480]  We don't try to change.
[1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:52.600]  Oh, yeah, you do, actually, you literally do.
[1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:54.000]  Look at Trump's inauguration.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:55.680]  Look at the riots during Trump's inauguration.
[1:03:55.680 --> 1:03:56.680]  You liar.
[1:03:56.680 --> 1:04:00.720]  Tifa riots where cities across this country were burning, and police cars were being fire
[1:04:00.720 --> 1:04:01.720]  barbed.
[1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:04.280]  Oh, your position is the left doesn't engage in violence, really?
[1:04:04.280 --> 1:04:08.920]  No, they wanted to nip our friend Mike Pence, but how do we make sense of that?
[1:04:08.920 --> 1:04:10.160]  Yeah, amazing stuff.
[1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:12.400]  All right, so there you go.
[1:04:12.400 --> 1:04:13.400]  They don't live in reality.
[1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:14.400]  They're liars.
[1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:15.400]  They're frauds.
[1:04:15.400 --> 1:04:16.400]  It's just unbelievable.
[1:04:16.400 --> 1:04:23.720]  Here's what I think is kind of a big whale waiting to come to the surface here.
[1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:29.040]  Dominion voting system CEO caught in major lie on 60 minutes on his voting machine capabilities.
[1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:32.520]  Well, that's the story headline at the Gateway Pundit.
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:37.000]  I think Dominion is already suing Fox News for billions of dollars.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:41.200]  I think I would not be surprised if Dominion starts going with the Alex Jones precedent
[1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:45.880]  and suing anybody and everybody who says anything negative about their voting machines for trillions
[1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:47.600]  of dollars.
[1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:50.520]  Do not be surprised if that starts happening.
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:54.600]  Why don't we just go back to paper mail-in or a paper ballot, just a paper, a pen and
[1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:55.600]  paper, a pencil paper?
[1:04:55.600 --> 1:04:58.600]  Why don't we just go back to that?
[1:04:58.600 --> 1:04:59.680]  Good question.
[1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:00.840]  It's our best seller.
[1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:04.760]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:09.960]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and
[1:05:09.960 --> 1:05:13.880]  how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[1:05:13.880 --> 1:05:17.200]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:22.640]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:23.640]  function of the body.
[1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:28.440]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[1:05:28.440 --> 1:05:31.000]  need to live and be healthy.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.280]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[1:05:33.280 --> 1:05:37.240]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment.
[1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:41.200]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:44.800]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the
[1:05:44.800 --> 1:05:48.320]  very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the infill war.
[1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:52.480]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally
[1:05:52.480 --> 1:05:56.240]  back in stock at infillwarstore.com for a 50% off.
[1:05:56.240 --> 1:06:07.320]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock, infillwarstore.com.
[1:06:07.320 --> 1:06:23.960]  And we've got Drew Hernandez with us from Drew Hernandez Live, his great talk show.
[1:06:23.960 --> 1:06:25.720]  And Drew has been very active lately.
[1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:27.200]  He and his crew are doing great work.
[1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:32.360]  They're infiltrating Biden events, they're infiltrating AOC events, they were recently
[1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:36.240]  at a protest against Matt Walsh's event in Nashville.
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:37.840]  So Drew joins me now.
[1:06:37.840 --> 1:06:40.520]  Drew, I'd like to talk to you about all three of these things.
[1:06:40.520 --> 1:06:41.520]  Where do you want to start?
[1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:45.240]  Wherever you want to start, oh, and man, great for having me back.
[1:06:45.240 --> 1:06:49.240]  It's always good to be with you, man, and a lot of mental illness to go through, bro.
[1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:50.240]  A lot.
[1:06:50.240 --> 1:06:54.760]  Well, you guys are capturing it on camera, no doubt, especially we can talk about Matt
[1:06:54.760 --> 1:06:56.440]  Walsh's event.
[1:06:56.440 --> 1:06:57.600]  What is it about this?
[1:06:57.600 --> 1:07:03.160]  What is it about, you know, what is it about Matt Walsh or a conservative having an event
[1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:08.240]  that draws hundreds of mentally deranged lunatics out there.
[1:07:08.240 --> 1:07:15.400]  And then they think that this behavior is somehow endearing to their cause, or they
[1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:19.040]  think this is somehow going to help their cause.
[1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:21.240]  And I don't see that at all.
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:24.800]  Any neutral observer can see these people are deranged and filled with hate.
[1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:26.760]  You sit there and watch it firsthand.
[1:07:26.760 --> 1:07:29.000]  I mean, do they ever try to explain that to you?
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:32.960]  Like, I know you've asked before, like, do they know that they're hurting their cause?
[1:07:32.960 --> 1:07:35.800]  I mean, look at that psycho, good lord.
[1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:40.680]  I mean, I mean, these people have severe cotton mouth, it's like, it's like falling into a
[1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:41.680]  black hole.
[1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:44.400]  I mean, you've been to these things and you know exactly how it goes.
[1:07:44.400 --> 1:07:49.200]  It's quite literally like the soundtrack to hell when you go to this stuff and these people
[1:07:49.200 --> 1:07:51.320]  are the figures that are probably going to go there.
[1:07:51.320 --> 1:07:57.360]  But I also will say is this is this was a rally to put a stop to the mutilation of the
[1:07:57.360 --> 1:07:59.920]  genitals of little kids and children.
[1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:03.760]  And so when you show up to something like that and you protest against that, you counter-protest
[1:08:03.760 --> 1:08:04.760]  against that.
[1:08:04.760 --> 1:08:09.400]  You're either a pedophile, you're satanically deranged, you probably have some skeletons
[1:08:09.400 --> 1:08:10.400]  in your closet.
[1:08:10.400 --> 1:08:13.760]  But I think you could pretty much see that these people do.
[1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:16.280]  This isn't like Trump's a Nazi anymore.
[1:08:16.280 --> 1:08:20.120]  This isn't like, oh, Republicans, we hate them and we're just going to scream our heads
[1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:24.640]  off and everybody's a straight white male with your infamous clip.
[1:08:24.640 --> 1:08:30.440]  This is now, these people want to rip apart the bodies of little kid and they sit there
[1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:34.680]  and they praise it, they defend it and they call for it.
[1:08:34.680 --> 1:08:37.440]  There are a bunch of LGBTQ little mini Jeffrey Donners.
[1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:40.440]  I think the next step for these people is they're just going to start eating genitals
[1:08:40.440 --> 1:08:41.440]  and eating little kids.
[1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:44.480]  I mean, I don't know, Owen, like where do we go from here?
[1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:46.600]  Well, look, this is a progression.
[1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:49.680]  There's no doubt this is a progression of mental illness that we're witnessing here
[1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:53.800]  on the left that is certainly reaching new levels every day.
[1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:54.800]  You're right.
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:57.040]  The question is, where does it go from here?
[1:08:57.040 --> 1:08:58.560]  Where does it go?
[1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:03.120]  Screaming in the streets at random people is not going to give them whatever closure
[1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:07.840]  or whatever it is they're looking for in life, whatever dark energy they're searching for.
[1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:10.280]  Do they really love killing babies that much?
[1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:12.640]  Do they really love chopping up babies that much?
[1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:16.000]  Do they really love pedophilia that much?
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.600]  And of course, you can't get an answer out of them.
[1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:20.520]  They just scream and shout and flick you off and everything.
[1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:25.720]  But yeah, I mean, if this mental illness is not addressed for what it is, that's a fair
[1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:26.720]  question.
[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:27.720]  Where does it go?
[1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:29.440]  Where does this mental illness go next?
[1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:32.280]  Because it's not going to just stay screaming in the streets forever, folks.
[1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:35.200]  It's going to go like Ed Buck level.
[1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:36.240]  I'll just say this.
[1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:41.040]  I think the next step is actual open pedophilia for these people.
[1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:43.560]  That's why they advocate for maps, right?
[1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:44.560]  Minor attracted people.
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:50.680]  That's why they have these drag shows with little children's bouncing on their hips
[1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:55.560]  and bouncing on their laps as if it's totally normal sitting there, squatting and twerking
[1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:58.720]  and flashing their bulging genitals in front of little kids.
[1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:02.760]  I mean, when I was in Pride LA, they were literally speaking to little kids in the crowd
[1:10:02.760 --> 1:10:04.200]  offering them lube.
[1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:10.880]  So I would say the next step for these people is out in the open pedophilia where it's normalized
[1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:13.880]  where they're not calling to try and make it normal anymore.
[1:10:13.880 --> 1:10:18.080]  If these people could have their way, it would be all over the mainstream media.
[1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:19.480]  It would be accepted on Disney.
[1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:25.040]  It would be accepted all over your TV, all over your social media apps, all over anything
[1:10:25.040 --> 1:10:27.000]  you could think of in your entertainment.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.440]  If they could have their way, they would have it.
[1:10:29.440 --> 1:10:30.440]  And there's a great clip.
[1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:31.440]  Look at that.
[1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:36.840]  That's a great example of the total depravity these people want to take us into.
[1:10:36.840 --> 1:10:37.840]  And they cheer it on.
[1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:38.840]  They cheer it on.
[1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:39.840]  Exactly.
[1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:41.360]  They cheer it on.
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:44.920]  I had a record skip there because I wasn't aware of this.
[1:10:44.920 --> 1:10:49.520]  You were at an event where they were giving children lube?
[1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:54.920]  They were offering children lube at Pride LA during June, during Pride month.
[1:10:54.920 --> 1:10:57.560]  They were floating around on a float like it was Disneyland.
[1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:01.440]  This drag freak was, you know, they were going up and down the street on Hollywood Boulevard.
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:06.280]  And one of them was literally communicating to the kids offering them lube with the parents.
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:10.320]  They're just sitting there clapping, thinking it's all OK and liberal and progressive.
[1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:12.120]  But that's what these people are doing.
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:13.960]  They hide behind the Pride flag.
[1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:16.320]  They hide behind the LGBTQ term.
[1:11:16.320 --> 1:11:19.520]  They hide behind the ability to be a protected class.
[1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:22.200]  And they're going to usher in their pedophilia through that.
[1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:23.200]  People just need it.
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:26.560]  That's literally what they're, to me, and I'm not saying this positively, like I agree
[1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:31.200]  with it, to me, it's actually a good idea for the pedophiles because they get to just
[1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:33.000]  come in and be accepted in society.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.720]  But that is what total depravity is.
[1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:36.840]  And that is how they're doing it.
[1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:39.200]  They're doing it through the LGBTQ banner.
[1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:43.600]  Well, let's see, but you just nailed their entire operation right there.
[1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:44.600]  That's exactly what it is.
[1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:48.320]  They don't really care about gay people, just like they don't really care about black people.
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:52.960]  You notice, as soon as a gay person or a black person goes against their party politics,
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:53.960]  they hate them.
[1:11:53.960 --> 1:11:54.960]  They want them destroyed.
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:56.120]  They want them censored.
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:11:57.440]  They want them killed.
[1:11:57.440 --> 1:11:59.240]  So they really don't care about these people.
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:00.240]  You just nailed it.
[1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:03.840]  All they care about is having the virtue signal and having that behind them so that they can
[1:12:03.840 --> 1:12:10.280]  hide behind that movement and then say, oh, I'm an ally or oh, I'm LGBTQ.
[1:12:10.280 --> 1:12:12.600]  And if you criticize me, you're a bigot.
[1:12:12.600 --> 1:12:17.720]  And then somehow that gives them the intellect right, as you see in the video here, to pick
[1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:23.120]  up little children, dance with them on a stage like a hooker, half naked, rub their genitals
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:26.480]  in their face, take money like they're strippers.
[1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:28.880]  And they just say, oh, this is LGBTQ pride.
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:32.160]  And if you don't like that, then you're not an ally and you're a bigot.
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:34.800]  No, you're hiding behind that.
[1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:38.920]  You build that up as a victim group to make it untouchable so that you can get away with
[1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:43.000]  your sordid behavior right in front of the people's faces.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  That's what they do.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:45.320]  Oh, and I mean, really think about it.
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:50.680]  Take a look at probably some of the most immoral, disgusting, depraved things taking place right
[1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:51.680]  now.
[1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:56.720]  You have this LGBTQ stick twisted agenda that's going after the children, going after the
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:13:01.640]  minds of children in the classroom, trying to warp their minds and teach them about sex,
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:04.880]  anal sex, gay sex, whatever sex, whatever.
[1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:05.880]  It doesn't matter.
[1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:10.320]  They're trying to warp their minds and their innocence in the classroom.
[1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:15.120]  And then you also have the agenda that's taking it further and going after mutilating their
[1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:19.360]  genitals, telling them that they're not actually a biological male if they're a little boy,
[1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:23.000]  they're not actually a biological female if they're a little girl, again, going after
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  the children.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  Look at the common thread here.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:29.200]  And then also, we have to always bring up the abortion conversation because that's always
[1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:34.520]  at the forefront, they want to kill children, murder children, mutilate children, and they
[1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:37.720]  want to sexually manipulate the minds of children.
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:41.640]  The next step, Owen, is they want open pedophilia.
[1:13:41.640 --> 1:13:43.600]  Let's just call it right now for what it is.
[1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:44.640]  It's been in the shadows.
[1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:46.520]  It's getting exposed in Hollywood.
[1:13:46.520 --> 1:13:52.200]  But right now, I think post, I would say 2021, 2022, they're pushing to normalize and make
[1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:53.200]  pedophilia mainstream.
[1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:54.200]  It's just clear by now.
[1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:58.480]  Well, and I think too, we kind of, you know, we almost have to check ourselves for a second
[1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:03.640]  because we see through the same Overton window that the public sees through in general.
[1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:06.720]  We just have the knowledge to know what we're seeing.
[1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:10.760]  If you move the clocks back, I mean, really, I would say 20 years, I mean, if you just
[1:14:10.760 --> 1:14:18.720]  go back to, let's say, 2002, if you saw this stuff in 2002, the average American, it wouldn't
[1:14:18.720 --> 1:14:20.080]  even be a debate.
[1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:23.680]  They would say that's pedophilia, that's child abuse, lock them all up, give them the electric
[1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:24.680]  chair.
[1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:30.440]  And this just shows you how far they've moved the Overton window that in two short decades,
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:34.800]  behavior that would be considered child abuse and arrestable offense on the spot is now
[1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:39.200]  considered open and loving and LGBTQ gay pride friendly.
[1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:40.200]  Absolutely.
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:46.800]  And this is kind of where liberalism and morality clash because at some point in a society,
[1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:52.400]  a line has to be drawn because if we're just openly, freely doing whatever we want in the
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:58.320]  sense of having no morals, innocent people get hurt in that process.
[1:14:58.320 --> 1:14:59.960]  And we can't get away from that.
[1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:01.840]  We can't shy away from that.
[1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:07.960]  This is why the concept of why the Bible makes sense when we're talking about morality within
[1:15:07.960 --> 1:15:13.480]  a society, because it always goes to one thing, innocent, being violated.
[1:15:13.480 --> 1:15:18.320]  And the most innocent people in a society are what, oh, and we both know this, are children.
[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:19.800]  And that's exactly where this is going.
[1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:23.800]  We cannot get away from it and we have to come out and we have to be aggressively pushing
[1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:24.800]  back.
[1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:25.800]  I'm not saying violence.
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:30.040]  I'm just saying use your political power, use your voice, use the ability that you have
[1:15:30.040 --> 1:15:32.920]  to literally, this stuff has to be shamed, Owen.
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:34.400]  It has to be shamed.
[1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:37.000]  It has to be made a mockery in society.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:41.040]  Otherwise, these people are going to continue to push this forward and attempt to make it
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:42.360]  normalized.
[1:15:42.360 --> 1:15:47.160]  And of course, it's Joe Biden in the White House sniffing kids, grabbing kids, groping
[1:15:47.160 --> 1:15:49.640]  little boys and girls, genitals, literally folks.
[1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:51.640]  That's what Joe Biden does on camera.
[1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:55.320]  And I want to go back to the footage that one of your undercover guys caught of Joe
[1:15:55.320 --> 1:15:58.800]  Biden sniffing a little girl.
[1:15:58.800 --> 1:15:59.800]  It's our bestseller.
[1:15:59.800 --> 1:16:04.000]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:09.120]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made it feel and
[1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:12.880]  how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall bestseller.
[1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:16.320]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:21.800]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:22.800]  function of the body.
[1:16:22.800 --> 1:16:27.600]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:32.440]  need to live and be healthy, essential means without these things you die.
[1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:34.160]  And so much of the food is debased.
[1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:39.280]  There's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:40.280]  with a product like this.
[1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:43.960]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the
[1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:47.480]  very best and it's a low price and it funds the infill war.
[1:16:47.480 --> 1:16:51.640]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally

[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:04.440]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:09.760]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:11.880]  The first amendment is unique in the world.
[1:17:11.880 --> 1:17:13.240]  That's what they want to take away.
[1:17:13.240 --> 1:17:14.240]  Their ability to speak freely.
[1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:17.680]  So they're going to go from Mike Lindell next, or are they going to go for Steve Bannon,
[1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:19.240]  or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[1:17:19.240 --> 1:17:23.440]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[1:17:23.440 --> 1:17:24.440]  all of this.
[1:17:24.440 --> 1:17:27.800]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:28.800]  your support.
[1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:32.840]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America,
[1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:36.360]  we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda.
[1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:40.040]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful infill wars has been
[1:17:40.040 --> 1:17:41.720]  because of your past support.

[1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:11.120]  Now, you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:15.400]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride, and when
[1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:18.520]  you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells, it doesn't just give
[1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:22.360]  you more energy, it doesn't just boost your immune system, but it also blocks the bad
[1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:26.880]  halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.

[1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:07.280]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:07.280 --> 1:20:17.080]  I want to get back into the issue we're leading into here with the Democrats just moving for
[1:20:17.080 --> 1:20:18.600]  open pedophilia in public.
[1:20:18.600 --> 1:20:21.200]  They just want access to your kids.
[1:20:21.200 --> 1:20:23.840]  Like they want to, folks, they literally want to be able to walk up to your kid and grab
[1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:27.160]  him like Joe Biden, and then if you say, hey, don't do that to my kid, they want to be able
[1:20:27.160 --> 1:20:31.320]  to take you to jail for denying the rights of a pedophile.
[1:20:31.320 --> 1:20:35.840]  And we've got unbelievable clips from Biden coming up, but you know, just to clarify something,
[1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:40.960]  Drew mentioned the foaming at the mouth that they do, or the cotton mouth.
[1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:44.840]  This isn't like you just went out and smoked a funny cigarette, or you went out and smoked
[1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:47.640]  a joint, and you got a little cotton mouth, whatever.
[1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:52.160]  No, these people are on serious psychotropic and antidepressant drugs.
[1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:53.920]  These are pill heads.
[1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:58.000]  It's one of the, it's a main side effect of people that are popping pills to have that
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:01.480]  kind of cotton like weird foaming at the mouth cotton mouth.
[1:21:01.480 --> 1:21:03.840]  I see it all the time at these events.
[1:21:03.840 --> 1:21:09.560]  It's well known that Americans are addicted to antidepressants and big pharmaceutical drugs.
[1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:13.280]  I've got the data right here in front of me, but yeah, that's basically what it looks
[1:21:13.280 --> 1:21:17.720]  like, the foam mouth, the spittle foaming at the mouth, cotton mouth, sometimes is what
[1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:19.360]  it's called, but it's much worse than that.
[1:21:19.360 --> 1:21:21.480]  These people are all on pills, folks.
[1:21:21.480 --> 1:21:26.840]  They're literally on pharmaceutical pills, which then gets into an entire new conversation
[1:21:26.840 --> 1:21:32.120]  about maybe it's the pill popping, maybe it's the pharmaceutical pills that are allowing
[1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:35.560]  these people to get brainwashed, but I want to backtrack from that and get back into the
[1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:36.960]  issue.
[1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:41.960]  Just a couple of weeks ago, Drew's crew infiltrated a Joe Biden event.
[1:21:41.960 --> 1:21:46.920]  You may remember it, but in case you don't, here's the video where Joe Biden creepily
[1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:50.360]  told a young girl what he claims to tell his daughter and granddaughter.
[1:21:50.360 --> 1:21:51.760]  I think I know why.
[1:21:51.760 --> 1:21:52.760]  Here's the clip.
[1:21:52.760 --> 1:22:04.080]  Now, very important thing, I told my daughter and granddaughter, no serious guys are 30.
[1:22:04.080 --> 1:22:08.400]  No serious guys are 30.
[1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:09.400]  So there it was.
[1:22:09.400 --> 1:22:11.520]  Now, why does he say no serious guys until you're 30?
[1:22:11.520 --> 1:22:13.200]  Because they're Joe's until they're 30.
[1:22:13.200 --> 1:22:17.320]  Joe has, he gets exclusive access to his daughters and granddaughters until they're 30.
[1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:21.440]  That's when he likes to get his jollies with them in the shower and then he lets them go.
[1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:24.720]  But I'm curious, Drew, that was your guy that infiltrated the event.
[1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:29.320]  The gentleman, because I mean, I believed, I didn't know this, so I'll ask you now.
[1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:33.320]  The gentleman that came and said, hey, no filming, was that because he knew that he
[1:22:33.320 --> 1:22:37.200]  just got epic film of Joe Biden behaving like a pedophile and he didn't want any more of
[1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:38.200]  it out there?
[1:22:38.200 --> 1:22:39.200]  Absolutely.
[1:22:39.200 --> 1:22:40.700]  It appears so.
[1:22:40.700 --> 1:22:42.240]  So that was Kailin Dalmeda.
[1:22:42.240 --> 1:22:45.200]  People could follow him on Twitter and get her at from Kailin.
[1:22:45.200 --> 1:22:48.040]  He actually infiltrated a private photo op.
[1:22:48.040 --> 1:22:53.240]  This was in California after Biden spoke to a group of people or attempted to a group
[1:22:53.240 --> 1:22:59.880]  of people and he infiltrated this private photo op and you could just see the uncomfortable
[1:22:59.880 --> 1:23:02.600]  look on that poor little girl's face.
[1:23:02.600 --> 1:23:05.920]  And they try to stop him because it was a private photo op.
[1:23:05.920 --> 1:23:10.480]  But the reason why they don't want any video going on is for reasons like this, because
[1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:16.040]  they know that Joe Biden, this creepy, disgusting weirdo, does this kind of stuff whenever there's
[1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:21.000]  a little girl president or a little boy president at that, he begins to walk up to them.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  He gets all excited inside and the hands come out, the eyes get big and then it's just
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:32.680]  like, dude, I show that to my mom and my mom has come a long way.
[1:23:32.680 --> 1:23:34.240]  She was anti-Trump at the beginning.
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:35.480]  She's totally red-pilled now.
[1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:38.200]  She's like, that can't be real.
[1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:39.800]  There's no way that's real.
[1:23:39.800 --> 1:23:41.520]  That's not some kind of meme.
[1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:46.520]  I'm like, no, mom, that is a real video that is actually the puppet president of the United
[1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:51.200]  States, groping a little girl, whispering into her ear and probably sniffing her at
[1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:53.000]  the same time.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:55.560]  But that's why they don't want people seeing this.
[1:23:55.560 --> 1:24:00.840]  That's why they try and stop it because they know the regular sane-minded person takes
[1:24:00.840 --> 1:24:04.360]  a look at that and says, dude, that guy's probably a pedophile.
[1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:05.840]  Get him the hell away from the kids.
[1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:11.280]  But because he's a Democrat, because he's the puppet president, because he's an elite,
[1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:14.800]  he gets a pass to just touch little kids out in the open and public and it goes back to
[1:24:14.800 --> 1:24:16.040]  my point, Owen.
[1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:18.600]  They want this stuff to be normalized.
[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:23.040]  And Joe Biden is the normalizer, if you will, if the president can do it on C-SPAN, then
[1:24:23.040 --> 1:24:27.560]  why can't I at a drag queen for kids strip show?
[1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:29.880]  And now, by the way, there's another image.
[1:24:29.880 --> 1:24:36.160]  Now, I mean, look, sadly, I've seen all of the Joe Biden sniffing little girls, grabbing
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:37.160]  little boys' genitals.
[1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:38.920]  I mean, little kids sniffing their necks.
[1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:42.360]  It looks like he's licking them sometimes, grabbing their ears, biting them.
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:43.880]  I mean, literally, folks, this is all happened.
[1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:46.280]  One time he bit Joe Biden's ear at an event.
[1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:47.280]  He bit her ear.
[1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:49.800]  I mean, that's how out of control he is right now.
[1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:51.200]  But have you seen this new one?
[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:55.360]  Because I was surprised I'd never seen this one, but I don't know when this happened.
[1:24:55.360 --> 1:24:58.720]  Have you seen the Joe Biden headbutt sniff of the little kid?
[1:24:58.720 --> 1:24:59.720]  Guys, put this one.
[1:24:59.720 --> 1:25:00.720]  Have you seen this one yet?
[1:25:00.720 --> 1:25:05.520]  Look at this one.
[1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:06.520]  Have you seen this one?
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:11.240]  It's like some kind of beast, like some kind of like mating call, you know what I mean?
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:16.080]  It's like this guy is like driven by his passions because he's so used to being around little
[1:25:16.080 --> 1:25:18.640]  kids and touching them and sniffing them.
[1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:21.360]  That little kid is all of us right now in America.
[1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:23.840]  Like get the hell away from us.
[1:25:23.840 --> 1:25:26.720]  Get the hell away from me, Joe.
[1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:27.720]  No.
[1:25:27.720 --> 1:25:29.080]  The kid has the instincts.
[1:25:29.080 --> 1:25:31.040]  Just like the young girl in the video.
[1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:33.920]  The kid has the intuition, the instincts to know that's a predator.
[1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:36.360]  He goes to hide for daddy and then Joe gives the headbutt.
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:37.680]  Look at that deep sniff too.
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:38.680]  Look at that.
[1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:39.840]  Nosing him.
[1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:41.280]  He's nosing him, Owen.
[1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:43.000]  Oh, Joe Biden is such a freak.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:44.960]  He's into nosing little kids on the back.
[1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:47.720]  Dude, here's the thing too, Owen.
[1:25:47.720 --> 1:25:48.720]  Let me ask you this.
[1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:50.600]  Do you ever feel uncomfortable sometimes?
[1:25:50.600 --> 1:25:54.680]  Like, do you ever feel like when you're watching these videos and you're like, I got a report
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:55.680]  on this?
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:25:56.920]  But should I show this?
[1:25:56.920 --> 1:25:59.240]  Is this considered like CP?
[1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:02.480]  Like, do you ever sit there and you're just like, dude, what the hell is going on?
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:03.480]  Like, I don't know.
[1:26:03.480 --> 1:26:04.480]  I don't know.
[1:26:04.480 --> 1:26:05.480]  Sometimes on my show.
[1:26:05.480 --> 1:26:06.480]  No, no, no.
[1:26:06.480 --> 1:26:07.480]  I totally understand.
[1:26:07.480 --> 1:26:14.080]  It's like even watching the drag queen stripper stuff for kids is so disgusting.
[1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:17.640]  I mean, I wish we didn't have to cover it.
[1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:18.640]  I agree.
[1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:21.760]  And I don't want people to think like, oh, you just love this stuff because it's for
[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:22.760]  a narrative.
[1:26:22.760 --> 1:26:23.760]  And I always have to communicate with you.
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:24.760]  So, but hold on.
[1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:25.760]  I'm sorry, Drew.
[1:26:25.760 --> 1:26:26.760]  I'm sorry to cut you off.
[1:26:26.760 --> 1:26:27.760]  Let me see.
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:32.760]  No, no, no, but that was a whole thread.
[1:26:32.760 --> 1:26:35.120]  The video I sent you, this is unbelievable, Drew.
[1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:36.120]  I'm not even kidding.
[1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:38.200]  This just happened.
[1:26:38.200 --> 1:26:40.400]  There was an entire thread.
[1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:44.960]  It was probably the best thread I've ever seen from George's chilling.
[1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:50.200]  It was like 20 or 30 tweets long, just documenting unlike anything I've ever seen in all of the
[1:26:50.200 --> 1:26:53.320]  Joe Biden pedophilia events, all the different videos we've seen.
[1:26:53.320 --> 1:26:57.040]  He documented each one, each individual, each time, each date.
[1:26:57.040 --> 1:27:02.840]  That has just been nuked from Twitter as we were sitting here playing the video, Drew.
[1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:03.840]  Unun...
[1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:06.880]  You know, you know why they do this.
[1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:12.400]  We all know why they do this because when people see this, they see it for what it truly
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:13.400]  is.
[1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:14.720]  This is why they need censorship.
[1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:16.880]  This is why they need to do platform things.
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:20.880]  This is why they need to suppress things that come out because this is the reality.
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:24.120]  This is the reality of what went to the White House.
[1:27:24.120 --> 1:27:27.920]  We got a pedophile in there that goes after children, that sniffs little boys on their
[1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:33.440]  backs, that gropes young teenage girls, and whispers in their ears like it's totally normal.
[1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:36.720]  See, this is the reality of what America has become.
[1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:42.520]  The total depravity is on full, full display, and people see this, Owen, and Big Tech has
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:47.160]  to silence it because they need to hide their pedophilia because they know that people wake
[1:27:47.160 --> 1:27:48.160]  up to this.
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:52.440]  And this is still a good sign, Owen, and bear with me for the viewers.
[1:27:52.440 --> 1:27:56.640]  It's a good sign when we see this because we know that people are still waking up.
[1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:01.560]  We'd be in a lot of trouble if the majority of this country was accepting this garbage
[1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:02.880]  and was praising it as well.
[1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:06.520]  I still believe it's kind of like a fringe, disgusting little minority and a bunch of
[1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:09.640]  people that are afraid to get canceled to speak out against it.
[1:28:09.640 --> 1:28:11.320]  It's good that we expose this.
[1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:15.720]  It's good that it comes out because people still have a moral compass, thank God, and
[1:28:15.720 --> 1:28:16.720]  it needs to be seen.
[1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:18.280]  That info wars is important as well.
[1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:22.360]  That's why they want to take down info wars because this stuff continues to get exposed.
[1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:28.640]  And the craziest part about it too is, like you said, I get why, I think you were talking
[1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:29.640]  about your mother.
[1:28:29.640 --> 1:28:31.960]  I get why she can't believe this stuff.
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:34.120]  I understand why people doubt this stuff.
[1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:35.520]  I don't want to believe this stuff.
[1:28:35.520 --> 1:28:37.200]  I just have to look at it every day.
[1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:42.880]  I mean, you see Joe Biden grabbing and sniffing little girls in a 30-minute compilation video.
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:44.560]  It's undeniable.
[1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:49.000]  There's a pattern of behavior here, and it's getting worse in his old age.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:53.720]  As his dementia and Alzheimer's get worse, he can't even control himself, folks.
[1:28:53.720 --> 1:28:57.240]  He's giving nose rubs to strange kids.
[1:28:57.240 --> 1:29:03.920]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:05.240]  you.
[1:29:05.240 --> 1:29:09.120]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly see
[1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:14.240]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:18.440]  the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:24.600]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links from info wars.com

[1:30:11.120 --> 1:30:14.440]  obsessed with silencing us.

[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:49.400]  An aspirin kicks in in 30 minutes, Tylenol kicks in in 30 minutes, this kicks in in
[1:31:49.400 --> 1:31:53.280]  about two weeks on average, you need to experience it.

[1:32:00.280 --> 1:32:05.200]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a globalist.
[1:32:05.200 --> 1:32:10.880]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the
[1:32:10.880 --> 1:32:11.880]  world.
[1:32:11.880 --> 1:32:17.280]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[1:32:17.280 --> 1:32:18.280]  deserve the credit.
[1:32:18.280 --> 1:32:23.200]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support info wars are the real
[1:32:23.200 --> 1:32:25.760]  reason you've had this success.
[1:32:25.760 --> 1:32:30.120]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new war you've ever
[1:32:30.120 --> 1:32:31.120]  had.
[1:32:31.120 --> 1:32:37.520]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more
[1:32:37.520 --> 1:32:41.680]  important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue
[1:32:41.680 --> 1:32:44.680]  in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[1:32:44.680 --> 1:32:50.360]  I bless you all, I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing
[1:32:50.360 --> 1:32:54.240]  now because we are over the target and this is happening.
[1:32:54.240 --> 1:32:59.760]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[1:32:59.760 --> 1:33:16.520]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:16.520 --> 1:33:34.480]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[1:33:34.480 --> 1:33:40.520]  Now Drew, I don't want to go into paranoid schizophrenic territory here, but we all witnessed
[1:33:40.520 --> 1:33:41.520]  what happened.
[1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:47.440]  Well, it was on the screen, we all saw on the screen that the tweet thread was removed.
[1:33:47.440 --> 1:33:50.480]  We all saw that on the screen, we documented it on the screen.
[1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:55.360]  I go into the control room during the break and I'm like, hey, is there any way I have
[1:33:55.360 --> 1:33:58.480]  it on my phone here, they haven't blocked it on my phone, if we do a doc cam we can
[1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:01.960]  just show this on my phone, and oh, okay, and then they go back to the tweet, now it's
[1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:03.360]  back live.
[1:34:03.360 --> 1:34:07.000]  So I don't know what's going on, I don't know, you know, again, like, are they watching
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:10.240]  Info Wars, like, oh, they're about to show this, let's ban it, oh no, they just said
[1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:15.360]  we're banning it, let's unban it, I feel like I'm going crazy here.
[1:34:15.360 --> 1:34:19.440]  The point is, the tweet thread is back up, so I want to put this all on the screen and
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:23.240]  just scroll through this slowly, guys, for documentary purposes, in case they do remove
[1:34:23.240 --> 1:34:24.240]  G.O.
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:28.280]  White's Twitter thread, because it's one of the most powerful exhibits about what Joe
[1:34:28.280 --> 1:34:31.640]  Biden has done inappropriately, touching girls, including the one famous video where he does
[1:34:31.640 --> 1:34:35.840]  a titty twister, I mean, that's what he gives a girl a titty twister, folks, it's not like
[1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:40.000]  two kids on the playground having fun like, oh, titty twister, no, Joe Biden sneaks up
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:45.840]  behind a young girl and gives her, oh my gosh, so, but there it is, Drew, but I was getting
[1:34:45.840 --> 1:34:49.560]  into this in the last segment, I kind of want to get your thoughts, I understand why people
[1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:54.840]  can't believe this stuff, and this is why I've kind of always said, you can't, it's impossible
[1:34:54.840 --> 1:34:59.680]  to wake somebody up, you have to give, you can give them breadcrumbs, you can give them
[1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:03.200]  a trail, if you will, you can kind of give them clues, but at the end of the day, it
[1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:07.480]  has to be their own awakening, they have to experience it, they have to land on the conclusion
[1:35:07.480 --> 1:35:12.040]  that this stuff is real, you can't convince them, and so, I mean, how many different examples
[1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:17.200]  are there, if it's not Joe Biden sniffing and groping kids, I mean, the wide open borders,
[1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:21.720]  the inflation, the violent crime, the Antifa riots, they get to question elections, but
[1:35:21.720 --> 1:35:26.840]  you don't, I mean, it's just on all aspects, I see people awakening unlike I've ever seen
[1:35:26.840 --> 1:35:27.840]  before.
[1:35:27.840 --> 1:35:33.200]  Unfortunately, that's how human behavior functions, and unfortunately, it's either you're going
[1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:38.520]  to learn through wisdom and knowledge and make some educated decisions preemptively
[1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:43.800]  to avoid a disaster, or you got to go through the disaster and learn the hard way, and unfortunately,
[1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:47.560]  we have people in this country that don't want to listen, that are afraid of getting
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:50.960]  canceled, that are afraid of just standing up for what is true and what is right, not
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:55.240]  all the viewers and the info warriors, talking about the cowards out there that just continue
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:59.720]  to pedal this stuff and allow it to go on, that are unafraid to draw a line in the sand,
[1:35:59.720 --> 1:36:03.920]  right now, lines have to be drawn, because there's innocence that is being violated right
[1:36:03.920 --> 1:36:08.120]  now, and there's innocence that is at stake, and obviously, at the top of it all is our
[1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:12.200]  country is the United States of America, humanity as a whole, and that's where the
[1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:15.640]  World Economic Forum and the Klaus Schwab's and the globalist agenda comes in from the
[1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:20.880]  top down, this is where this is all coming from, economy, the social revamping and structures,
[1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:27.120]  they all talk about this, especially the replacement migration, this is all a WEF agenda, and when
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:30.480]  people start to wake up to that, I mean, here's the thing, a lot of people will say, oh, the
[1:36:30.480 --> 1:36:34.280]  New World Order, that's just some kind of Christian conspiracy theory, oh, you just
[1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:38.600]  sound like Alex Jones, he's been saying that for decades, and it's just a bunch of garbage,
[1:36:38.600 --> 1:36:43.160]  Illuminati this, New World Order that, it's a one world religion, one world government
[1:36:43.160 --> 1:36:47.440]  that it's a, is it really, it's like, look, we've come to a place, and Alex has been saying
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:51.360]  this for years, you could read their writings and go and read their books, they're open
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:56.680]  about this stuff, but now, people could literally go to the World Economic Forum website, you
[1:36:56.680 --> 1:37:03.240]  can read all of their thought, you can read their entire agenda for 2030 to 2050, I think
[1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:08.440]  it's out like 100 years, everything these people want to do, they have it systemically
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:13.480]  planned, not just for the US, but for the entire globe, you can see it across the entire
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:18.360]  board, Cloud Schwab comes out and makes statements like this, we need to revamp the economic
[1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:23.480]  and social structures of the West and the entire world, the entire globe, that is why
[1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:27.960]  you're seeing everything falling to pieces, that's why they're putting out the build-back-better
[1:37:27.960 --> 1:37:32.840]  great reset agenda, because you need a control demolition in order to build it back up, not
[1:37:32.840 --> 1:37:38.200]  just the economy, but also the social fabric of a nation and a society as well, so all
[1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:43.200]  of this, all of this is a control demolition, so these people can have top-down control,
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:46.560]  it's not a conspiracy theory anymore, go to the freaking website, they're open about
[1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:50.680]  it, you can go to Davos yourself, you can watch it on freaking YouTube at this point
[1:37:50.680 --> 1:37:56.040]  and listen to these psychopaths, these homicidal maniacs planning your future and your life,
[1:37:56.040 --> 1:37:59.960]  oh and then the left wants to come out and say, oh we care so much about democracy, well
[1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:04.520]  what about them, who the hell elected Bill Gates, who the hell elected Cloud Schwab,
[1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:08.840]  why does the left call them out and they claim to care about democracy, then call these people
[1:38:08.840 --> 1:38:13.080]  out that are unelected, that are coming out and making decisions for your life in this
[1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:17.560]  country that you live in, but they're silent on that, why, we all know why, goes back to
[1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:18.560]  the money.
[1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:22.080]  And because of course, if it can't be applied universally, it's not logic, it's propaganda,
[1:38:22.080 --> 1:38:26.480]  it's all propaganda and that's what's so frustrating too, because you understand, you mentioned
[1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:31.480]  the social fabric, part of the great reset is to destroy the social fabric so that they
[1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:35.720]  can remake it and that's what's so frustrating, it's like when you go out and you're dealing
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:40.200]  with these drag queens, dripper time for kids, we're trying to stop the general mutilation
[1:38:40.200 --> 1:38:45.720]  of children, it's not just to protect the children, that's the front lines of us saying
[1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:50.880]  hey let's protect the children, it's to make people understand this is part of a bigger
[1:38:50.880 --> 1:38:55.040]  agenda, this isn't just happening through osmosis, this isn't a natural occurrence, this is being
[1:38:55.040 --> 1:39:02.200]  forced upon you and what's incredible about it now is, again, how anybody could stand
[1:39:02.200 --> 1:39:07.760]  and say I support chopping off little boys and girls genitals, I stand for chopping off
[1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:12.880]  little girls breasts, I think that's a great thing, that is completely insane, let alone
[1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:17.120]  drag queen stripper time for kids, that's like just one level better I guess, I guess
[1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:22.240]  one level worse is actually mutilating them, then one level less worse is just dancing
[1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:27.080]  naked and stripping in front of them and you say how can you support that, they've fully
[1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:30.920]  bought into this Drew and I don't even think they really, I don't think they actually buy
[1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:34.560]  into genital mutilation of children, I don't think they actually buy into drag queen stripper
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:40.680]  time for kids, they've bought into the larger idea of hate everything traditional, hate
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:45.720]  Christians, hate America, just hate, hate, hate and then you have all these things that
[1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:50.640]  they hate and so now their entire mode of operation is, I'm just going to do things
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:55.200]  that you hate, so I'm going to promote chopping up little boys and girls because you hate
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:39:59.520]  it, I'm going to promote abortion because you hate it, so it's not even coming from
[1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:05.200]  a place of what they believe, it's coming from a place of hate, absolutely and I'll
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:12.200]  prove it to you, so when we were at the rally in Nashville on Friday, two detransitioners
[1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:17.680]  and Chloe was one of them, we need to really continue to platform people that are detransitioning,
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:22.920]  not because it fits the narrative, not because it fits the pushback that we want against
[1:40:22.920 --> 1:40:27.480]  these people, but because it's the reality of what happens to someone that goes through
[1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:34.680]  that nightmare and buys that lie, when you see the reaction that these people have against
[1:40:34.680 --> 1:40:39.440]  these kids that are detransitioning, I'm talking like young people, the demons come out even
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:45.360]  more, it is full hatred, they call them fascists, they call them evil, they call them the most
[1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:49.520]  slanderous things you could possibly think of, the people that were once championed by
[1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:55.320]  that one community and the name of love and tolerance and the LGBTQ acceptance, oh diversity,
[1:40:55.320 --> 1:40:59.920]  we just love everybody, the moment and I think it's even worse, I'm going to be honest here,
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:06.400]  I think it's even worse than just a Democrat going over to the right like Tulsi or a black
[1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:11.280]  person that's kind of defecting from leftist thought or a brown person or whatever, I think
[1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:16.240]  these detransitioners are getting it even worse because this is so satanic, it's evil
[1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:21.680]  at its core and when people see that, people see that someone that was once championed
[1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:27.560]  by this community, this cause that they care so much, get absolutely obliterated and slandered
[1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:31.840]  publicly and their other eyes start turning black and rolling behind their heads and the
[1:41:31.840 --> 1:41:37.320]  foam gets worse, that is the key right there, the key is that, is platforming people that
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:42.160]  are detransitioning not for a narrative but to show the reality of what this is doing
[1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:45.920]  to this generation, those are the ones that are going to save this generation and I'll
[1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:50.160]  tell you why, because they've gone through it, they've suffered through it, they've learned
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:54.480]  and they need to be platformed so they can voice just exactly what happened because they
[1:41:54.480 --> 1:41:58.680]  are the ones that could speak to this generation and I think when people see the attack, that
[1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:00.080]  wakes people up big time.
[1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:06.520]  Oh, that was the main thing, I had a detransitioned individual in studio with me last week and
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:09.560]  that was the main thing that grabbed my attention when he was telling me the story, this was
[1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:16.120]  before we took it to air, the main thing that grabbed my attention was how when he was considering
[1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:22.160]  going through the process of being trans man to woman and when he was considering what
[1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:28.920]  types of, you know, either surgeries or chemicals he would take in that process, he was really
[1:42:28.920 --> 1:42:32.680]  hesitant and then he was kind of hesitant with the chemicals and he was kind of hesitant
[1:42:32.680 --> 1:42:36.520]  with the surgeries and then he got to a point where he just didn't want any of it and the
[1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:40.680]  shocking part about me was he told me he was like, he never had more hatred in his life,
[1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:44.820]  he was like when he thought he wanted to be trans to a woman and when he was considering
[1:42:44.820 --> 1:42:49.520]  those things, oh it was open, open minds, open hearts, open arms but as soon as he was
[1:42:49.520 --> 1:42:54.000]  kind of saying, you know what, maybe I don't want to do this, the hatred started to flow,
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:57.360]  the hatred started to flow deep, there's something there.
[1:42:57.360 --> 1:43:04.560]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:09.920]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:13.360]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:14.800]  ability to speak freely.
[1:43:14.800 --> 1:43:17.960]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or are they going to go for Steve Bannon,
[1:43:17.960 --> 1:43:19.600]  are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[1:43:48.600 --> 1:43:51.120]  amazing products that keep us on air.

[1:43:58.640 --> 1:44:03.280]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the globalist stone documents from their own

[1:44:05.320 --> 1:44:09.800]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher and it's because of your
[1:44:09.800 --> 1:44:15.840]  backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and
[1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:21.680]  the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air, but now we're reaching the most critical juncture
[1:44:21.680 --> 1:44:23.280]  in the fight together.

[1:44:28.480 --> 1:44:32.320]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I've been forced
[1:44:32.320 --> 1:44:37.920]  by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[1:44:37.920 --> 1:44:38.920]  It's unsustainable.
[1:44:38.920 --> 1:44:45.600]  So please visit saveinfowarstore.com, saveinfowarstore.com where you can make
[1:44:45.600 --> 1:44:51.480]  straight donations, $5, $10, $500, whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere.
[1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:54.680]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[1:44:54.680 --> 1:44:58.480]  Thank you for your support, wouldn't be without you, saveinfowarstore.com.

[1:46:59.440 --> 1:47:10.960]  Shooting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:29.840]  Good breaking news update here, there has been a school shooting in St. Louis, the event
[1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:39.160]  has ended now and three are ruled dead including the shooter and I believe at least eight others
[1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:47.960]  wounded inside Central Vision and Performing Arts High School in St. Louis and so this
[1:47:47.960 --> 1:47:55.600]  is very sad and I remember something that Rush Limbaugh used to say all the time in
[1:47:55.600 --> 1:48:00.360]  response to this with the left calling to grab the guns.
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:04.800]  The next school shooter is already out there and whatever laws you write are not going
[1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:10.520]  to stop them and that's just the truth folks and with my next guest who's coming up next
[1:48:10.520 --> 1:48:17.080]  hour, Savannah Hernandez, she got into a talk with some anti-gun students who want gun free
[1:48:17.080 --> 1:48:20.160]  zones and she said well if you're in a gun free zone and someone comes in with a gun
[1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:21.920]  what do you do?
[1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:25.880]  They don't have an answer for that because it doesn't make sense, that's why you should
[1:48:25.880 --> 1:48:26.880]  be armed.
[1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:32.600]  So this is a tragic thing, I don't know of the security at that school but I believe
[1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:38.280]  sadly if we have to stop school shootings I believe the thing to do is have a trained
[1:48:38.280 --> 1:48:46.280]  armed guard, heavily trained armed guard, a master marksman at these schools, there's
[1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:50.480]  veterans that will do it, there's X cops that will do it, they'd be happy to do it, many
[1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:55.120]  of them would probably volunteer to do it and unfortunately you're just going to continue
[1:48:55.120 --> 1:49:00.240]  to see copycat events like this because the world has just gone to such a dark place sadly
[1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:03.720]  so we'll monitor that but that's what the latest is there.
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:10.480]  Alright, Drew Hernandez with me for another segment and you know we've been talking about
[1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:18.360]  this issue because again I don't think anybody can in their right mind say that trans kids
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:23.160]  is a good thing, I don't think anybody in their right mind can say that drag queen
[1:49:23.160 --> 1:49:26.920]  stripper time for kids is a good thing, I mean I think neutral observers see this stuff
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:31.040]  and they know it's bad, 20 years ago it wouldn't even been up for debate but now that they
[1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:35.560]  brainwashed the youth and maybe that's what it is Drew, when you go to these events like
[1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:39.920]  for example Matt Walsh's event in Tennessee where you had a bunch of the wild crazies
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:46.600]  show up, it does appear that it's mostly young people and so I guess this is the result
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:53.160]  of decades of propaganda and programming into the youth that have made them buy into such
[1:49:53.160 --> 1:49:57.920]  disgusting despicable behavior like trans kids surgery.
[1:49:57.920 --> 1:50:02.840]  Absolutely, you've seen a total indoctrination, I mean it's the same thing within Tifa and
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:08.520]  Black Lives Matter, these radicals, they get indoctrinated in these universities, that's
[1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:12.760]  why they're trying to push it even at a younger age, that's why they're trying to go K-12
[1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:17.360]  indoctrinating them with CRT and gender queer theory and all this garbage and showing them
[1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:21.880]  pornography and little books and how to have gay sex and they're trying to lower the bar
[1:50:21.880 --> 1:50:25.640]  because yeah they could get them in the university but you take a look at these people, Adolf
[1:50:25.640 --> 1:50:30.520]  Hitler knew this, the Nazis knew it, Mao obviously knew this, you target the youth, you win an
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:34.240]  entire generation and I think these people know that, obviously they know that and they're
[1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:38.800]  doing that with their twisted doctrines of demons and you're seeing the fruit of their
[1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:43.880]  labor of decades of indoctrination in universities and in schools and even in the mainstream
[1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:49.120]  media and in the mainstream arts as well, you're seeing it all come to fruition when
[1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:54.000]  you see the 2020 riots and you see these people championing literally the murder of babies
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:57.880]  inside and outside of the womb when they hit the street, when you see people screaming
[1:50:57.880 --> 1:51:02.520]  at me telling me they love effing killing babies when I was in DC just, you know, right
[1:51:02.520 --> 1:51:06.040]  after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, but you also see it when they're out there doing
[1:51:06.040 --> 1:51:11.440]  the same thing to mutilate the genitals of children. The fruit of that demonic labor
[1:51:11.440 --> 1:51:16.120]  is coming to fruition, an entire generation has bought into this crap and it's disgusting
[1:51:16.120 --> 1:51:21.800]  and it's twisted. Yeah, I did the same thing at a, at a, at a beta rally, a Robert Francis
[1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:26.480]  O'Rourke rally here and I said, I love abortion. I was on a microphone. I said, I love abortion
[1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:30.680]  and these people with beta signs are like, yeah, yeah. And I'm like, yeah, let's kill
[1:51:30.680 --> 1:51:38.600]  the babies. They're like, yeah, kill the babies. Yeah. It's like, oh my gosh. They love it.
[1:51:38.600 --> 1:51:43.560]  It's a cult. It's a death cult. They're Mollick worshipers. These people love death. That's
[1:51:43.560 --> 1:51:49.000]  what they love. They obsess over death. Right. They're just like Satan. They're filled with
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:55.240]  Satan to steal, kill and destroy. And that's why even, you know, with, I hate seeing that
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:59.240]  stuff, man. I hate seeing the school shootings because you know that kind of stuff could
[1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:03.840]  be prevented. You know that if you had an armed person on that campus, it could have
[1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:08.080]  been prevented. And of course the left is going to politicize and say, oh, we care so
[1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:12.400]  much about the kids and this is why we need to take away guns. They immediately politicize
[1:52:12.400 --> 1:52:16.240]  it just like they did with. And what are the odds that the 20 year old shooter was on big
[1:52:16.240 --> 1:52:24.440]  pharmaceutical pills? What are the odds? The thing is Owen is they need further victimization
[1:52:24.440 --> 1:52:28.640]  so they could further control the population through fear. They do it through COVID. They
[1:52:28.640 --> 1:52:33.200]  do it. Everything's a damn phobia. And obviously when it comes to the gun control thing, they
[1:52:33.200 --> 1:52:37.160]  need that to continue to keep going because if they don't have that, they don't have a
[1:52:37.160 --> 1:52:40.800]  narrative to control people through fear. That's why, and they don't care about kids.
[1:52:40.800 --> 1:52:45.080]  They don't give a damn about kids because if they did, we could put armed guards on the
[1:52:45.080 --> 1:52:49.760]  campuses. Oh, no, no, that's our kids. Our babies shouldn't be living like that. Okay.
[1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:54.680]  If AOC and these left leaning politicians could pay hundreds of thousands of dollars
[1:52:54.680 --> 1:53:00.040]  for armed security for their lives to be protected, then why can't we have that for our babies
[1:53:00.040 --> 1:53:03.880]  in the United States of America? You want to know why? Because they hate kids. They
[1:53:03.880 --> 1:53:08.360]  hate them. They want to kill them before they're even born. Oh, the kid's going to be poor.
[1:53:08.360 --> 1:53:12.280]  The kid's not going to have a life. So we might as well just kill it. Stacey Abram says
[1:53:12.280 --> 1:53:17.240]  you can't afford to have a baby. So just kill the damn baby. Okay, the baby's born. Oh,
[1:53:17.240 --> 1:53:24.240]  just warp its mind causing to believe we need off its penis, top off. It's chemically
[1:53:24.240 --> 1:53:30.240]  castrated hate them. They hate them across the board. Oh, and they don't love children.
[1:53:30.240 --> 1:53:34.440]  And these people need to go. Listen, I'll say this, we need to cancel the pedophiles.
[1:53:34.440 --> 1:53:38.320]  We need to cancel the groomers. We need to cancel the child mutilators. We need to go
[1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:43.720]  cancel every single one of these people because these people are a virus, they're toxic, and
[1:53:43.720 --> 1:53:47.680]  they're destroying our society. And I will not hold back on saying any of this stuff
[1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:51.920]  because everyone that's watching this agrees with what I'm saying. We need to cancel every
[1:53:51.920 --> 1:53:55.840]  single one of these parasitic individuals that are living in our society right now.
[1:53:55.840 --> 1:53:59.920]  And I'm not talking about violence. Wow. I mean, I was going to ask Drew about the upcoming
[1:53:59.920 --> 1:54:03.080]  midterms, but that's like a walk off home run right there. I don't know if there's anything
[1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:07.040]  else to really be said, but I will just comment on one other thing you said and then we'll
[1:54:07.040 --> 1:54:11.280]  let you go because you're spot on. I actually agree. I don't want to grow up in a country
[1:54:11.280 --> 1:54:15.000]  where we feel that we need armed guards at schools. I'm in complete agreement. That's
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:19.480]  not the society I want to live in. But guess what? If you want to stop a school shooting,
[1:54:19.480 --> 1:54:24.200]  let's think common sense measures. Have a trained marksman, an expert marksman on the
[1:54:24.200 --> 1:54:29.560]  scene that can neutralize a shooter, hopefully before he even gets a shot off. That's the
[1:54:29.560 --> 1:54:34.320]  common sense response to this, not disarming. Slaves aren't allowed to have weapons. So
[1:54:34.320 --> 1:54:39.800]  why should you disarm yourself like a good slave? I don't think so. Drew Hernandez kick
[1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:44.360]  ass job as always. Where can people follow your great work? You guys could follow me
[1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:49.620]  on Twitter, drew h live on getter drew h live. Same on truth. So you can watch my show front

[1:55:03.200 --> 1:55:07.280]  Really awesome. Drew Hernandez, thanks for joining us today. Thank you, bro. Love you.
[1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:12.880]  Man, oh man, folks, I will tell you, I sleep easy at night knowing drew Hernandez is out
[1:55:12.880 --> 1:55:16.920]  there. I sleep easy at night knowing there's great American patriots out there telling
[1:55:16.920 --> 1:55:22.840]  the truth with a giant following like drew Hernandez. It makes me sleep easier at night.
[1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:29.080]  Obviously info wars, they slated us for destruction years ago. We're still here operating. But
[1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:34.560]  just knowing the reinforcements are aligned behind us is truly a relief factor. But we
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:39.000]  don't plan on going anywhere. We don't plan on shutting down. I get asked all the time,
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:42.400]  you know, what's the situation? How much longer you got? What's going on? Folks, we're gonna,
[1:55:42.400 --> 1:55:45.040]  we're gonna, we're gonna stay here as long as we can. We're gonna keep this mothership
[1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:49.680]  in orbit as long as we can. We're very transparent about what's going on around here. We're even
[1:55:49.680 --> 1:55:53.240]  more transparent considering everything has to come out in the court cases. They act like
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:56.480]  it doesn't come out. Then they, they say they didn't give us discovery. And then they, here's
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:55:59.440]  well, here's all the financials they showed us. So trillion dollars. Wait, you said we
[1:55:59.440 --> 1:56:02.960]  didn't give you financials. So how do you have the financials to get this? So obviously
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:08.760]  you understand it's all lies. But here's how it goes. This is the mothership. It's in orbit.
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:12.240]  We've got a gas tank. We just need to keep it filled. That's all it is. And when you
[1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:17.520]  shop at info wars store.com, that's what keeps it filled. Great ways to support us. If you're
[1:56:17.520 --> 1:56:22.160]  into taking supplements like me, I'm, I'm a supplement head. I take about 15, 20 different
[1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:26.880]  pills every day, all healthy, all organic supplements. Most of them from info wars store.com. The
[1:56:26.880 --> 1:56:32.280]  vitamin mineral drink fusion is fantastic. I mix it with juice every morning. That's what
[1:56:32.280 --> 1:56:36.920]  I chased down my morning supplements with is vitamin mineral fusion. Great flavor, healthy
[1:56:36.920 --> 1:56:43.040]  for you. I suggest having it for kids too. You know, my, my parents were pretty good
[1:56:43.040 --> 1:56:46.720]  about making sure I didn't drink too much soda and stuff. But you know, I had sodas
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:51.840]  every once while I liked sodas. But I'm telling you, get your kids off the sodas. Don't even
[1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:57.680]  put the sodas in the fridge. Just have a cooler or have a pitcher of vitamin mineral fusion
[1:56:57.680 --> 1:57:02.840]  in the refrigerator and your kids are going to love it. And so instead of going and trying
[1:57:02.840 --> 1:57:06.920]  to get a toxic soda with the high fructose corn syrup in it, they'll go for a drink of
[1:57:06.920 --> 1:57:12.160]  vitamin mineral fusion and they'll like it just as much and it'll be good for them. Or
[1:57:12.160 --> 1:57:16.080]  if you're like me, I just like starting out every day with it. Vitamin mineral fusion

[2:00:04.880 --> 2:00:22.440]  All right, Mary Garland has just gone live. This is their national security briefing ahead
[2:00:22.440 --> 2:00:28.000]  of the election. So let's see what kind of propaganda that pinhead is telling the American
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:35.440]  government. Separately, in the Eastern District of New York, the justice in charge seven individuals
[2:00:35.440 --> 2:00:40.240]  who are working on behalf of the PRC within getting in a multi-year campaign of threats
[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:46.680]  and harassment to force a US resident to return to China. Oh my gosh. Thursday, we arrested
[2:00:46.680 --> 2:00:53.360]  two of those defendants. Those activities were part of the PRC's global extra legal
[2:00:53.360 --> 2:00:59.920]  effort known as Operation Fox Hunt. Its purpose is to locate and bring back to China alleged
[2:00:59.920 --> 2:01:04.400]  fugitives who have fled to foreign countries, including the United States. He talks with
[2:01:04.400 --> 2:01:08.440]  no confidence. His voice is wavering like he's about to cry. What does he always sound
[2:01:08.440 --> 2:01:13.120]  like? Critics of the government who have sought relief and refuge. Do you think it's a woman?
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:17.640]  Do you think that's a training? The indictment alleges that the defendants working at the
[2:01:17.640 --> 2:01:25.440]  direction of the government of PRC engaged in a campaign of harassment, threats, surveillance
[2:01:25.440 --> 2:01:32.400]  and intimidation aimed at coercing the victim to return to China. Okay. We also alleged
[2:01:32.400 --> 2:01:36.240]  that the defendants threatened and harassed. This is actually really big. I'm going to
[2:01:36.240 --> 2:01:39.240]  let him talk, but I'm going to tell you what's really going on here before the breaks. But
[2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:42.360]  this is actually bigger than I thought. This has nothing to do with the midterms. Let him
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:48.480]  continue. Travel from China to the United States to convey the PRC's threats to the
[2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:54.320]  victim's son. The defendants threatened the victim, saying that quote, coming back and
[2:01:54.320 --> 2:02:00.640]  turning herself in is the only way out. They showed up at the home of the victim's son
[2:02:00.640 --> 2:02:06.400]  in New York. They filed frivolous lawsuits against the victim and his son and said it
[2:02:06.400 --> 2:02:13.680]  would be quote, endless misery for the defendant and son to defend themselves. And they made
[2:02:13.680 --> 2:02:21.640]  clear that their harassment would not stop until the victim returned to China. As these
[2:02:21.640 --> 2:02:27.120]  cases demonstrate, the government of China sought to interfere with the rights and freedoms
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:33.280]  of individuals in the United States and to undermine our judicial system that protects
[2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:38.320]  those rights. Okay, let me just do this upon that statement right there. And if he and
[2:02:38.320 --> 2:02:41.960]  if he's still alive when we come back from this break, I'll pick it back up. Folks, this
[2:02:41.960 --> 2:02:47.840]  has nothing to do with the midterms. Do you really think that the Justice Department or
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:53.520]  the Biden administration cares about censorship of free speech? No, they engage in it themselves.
[2:02:53.520 --> 2:02:58.760]  In fact, Eric Schmidt is about to depose members of the Biden administration on how, as Mark
[2:02:58.760 --> 2:03:04.760]  Zuckerberg admitted, they went to social media companies to promote Democrat Party propaganda
[2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:08.840]  and censor Republicans. So that's all about to come out in court. So they don't care about
[2:03:08.840 --> 2:03:12.280]  they don't care about free speech. This isn't a free speech thing. Do you really think they
[2:03:12.280 --> 2:03:18.840]  even care about what China does as far as censoring free speech or as far as I mean,
[2:03:18.840 --> 2:03:24.640]  folks, China's been caught, people have been caught trying to smuggle biological materials
[2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:32.360]  in and out of China. Scientists, they do deals with China where they make bioweapons like
[2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:39.600]  Anthony Fauci and Peter Dasek and EcoHealth Alliance with COVID-19. There's been all kinds
[2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:47.560]  of problems with China and intellectual property theft here in America and hacking. So whatever
[2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:55.000]  he's saying, this is about, it's not. This is 100% an affront to China because they're
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  aligning with Russia right now. That's what this is. That's all this is. And it's actually
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:04.960]  pathetic. It'd be one thing if our government actually cared about standing up to the Chinese
[2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:11.880]  communists. You know, they don't. So they send Merrick Garland, a chicken-necked weasel
[2:04:11.880 --> 2:04:17.720]  who can't even speak without his voice wavering. They send Merrick Garland, a chicken-necked
[2:04:17.720 --> 2:04:23.160]  weasel and this woman up there to try to intimidate China and act like they're going to do something
[2:04:23.160 --> 2:04:27.880]  about Chinese corruption politically here in America. Folks, all this is is an affront
[2:04:27.880 --> 2:04:31.160]  to China because they're siding with Russia on the Ukraine situation. That's all this
[2:04:31.160 --> 2:04:36.440]  is. That's all this is. This is Sabre Rattling with China. This is acting like they're going
[2:04:36.440 --> 2:04:40.480]  to do something about China, acting like they're going to take Chinese corruption seriously.
[2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:45.480]  Or not. No one's going to take Merrick Garland seriously. No one's going to take this woman
[2:04:45.480 --> 2:04:51.280]  seriously. Is that Newland up there now? China does not care what you think. This is the
[2:04:51.280 --> 2:04:58.600]  Democrat Party attempt to intimidate China. Wow. What a pathetic display.
[2:04:58.600 --> 2:05:05.040]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy. I am
[2:05:05.040 --> 2:05:10.720]  blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are
[2:05:10.720 --> 2:05:16.640]  obsessed with silencing us. They know the truth about their globalist operations is
[2:05:16.640 --> 2:05:22.760]  exposed. It's game over. And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully
[2:05:22.760 --> 2:05:28.800]  fighting back. And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[2:05:28.800 --> 2:05:34.160]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com,
[2:05:34.160 --> 2:05:38.800]  it changes the world. And that's why when you go to infowars.com and get amazing products
[2:05:38.800 --> 2:05:44.120]  that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also
[2:05:44.120 --> 2:05:48.560]  empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist. The fight starts at

[2:05:54.400 --> 2:06:06.000]  you all for your support.
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:12.400]  We're trying to figure out who this woman speaking is. It's not Victoria Newland. But
[2:06:12.400 --> 2:06:18.080]  let's go back. This is the Democrat Party. This is the American regime's attempt to
[2:06:18.080 --> 2:06:25.080]  intimidate China with Merrick Garland saying, oh, we're going to take the Chinese people
[2:06:25.080 --> 2:06:30.920]  seriously now when they censor and they threaten people. Oh, give me a break. This is them
[2:06:30.920 --> 2:06:35.760]  saberattling saying, China, you better not side with Russia in the Ukrainian war. The
[2:06:35.760 --> 2:06:39.480]  unbelievable stuff. Let's go back to this Goon Squad.
[2:06:39.480 --> 2:06:44.800]  Security official and others through a variety of means, including with all expense paid
[2:06:44.800 --> 2:06:49.000]  trips to Lisa Monaco, deputy director. Yeah, she's scared.
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  Failed because the men and women of the Department of Justice defended our institutions and thwarted
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:07:02.720]  the persistent threat posed by agents of the PRC. I want to thank the agents, analysts
[2:07:02.720 --> 2:07:08.440]  and prosecutors. This has been going on for years. This is hilarious work on behalf of
[2:07:08.440 --> 2:07:13.240]  the American people. And now I'll turn the podium over to FBI Director Ray. Oh, here
[2:07:13.240 --> 2:07:16.880]  we go. Now Ray is going to try to intimidate China. China has been involved in our affairs
[2:07:16.880 --> 2:07:19.600]  for years. Half of these people are paid off by China.
[2:07:19.600 --> 2:07:26.640]  Thank you. First, let me begin by pointing out that 10 of the 13 charged individuals
[2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:32.640]  we're discussing today are Chinese intelligence officers and Chinese government officials.
[2:07:32.640 --> 2:07:38.360]  They're charged in three different cases that might seem at first glance to be about unrelated
[2:07:38.360 --> 2:07:43.120]  issues. However, and this is something that I've been talking about for years now, each
[2:07:43.120 --> 2:07:48.840]  of these cases lays bare the Chinese government's flagrant violation of international laws as
[2:07:48.840 --> 2:07:53.760]  they work to project their authoritarian... This has been going on for years. Yeah, yeah.
[2:07:53.760 --> 2:07:57.040]  Are they going to go after Hunter Biden for his deals with the Chinese? Are they going
[2:07:57.040 --> 2:08:02.440]  to go after Joe and Hunter Biden because of their Chinese deals? No. This is all save
[2:08:02.440 --> 2:08:08.040]  or addling, folks....established democratic norms and the rule of law as they work to
[2:08:08.040 --> 2:08:12.040]  undermine U.S. economic security and fundamental human rights.
[2:08:12.040 --> 2:08:15.760]  It's been doing that for decades. Including those of Americans. Been doing that for decades.
[2:08:15.760 --> 2:08:19.720]  We also see a coordinated effort... Why this press conference today, I'll tell you....to
[2:08:19.720 --> 2:08:27.160]  lie, cheat, and steal their way into unfairly dominating entire technology sectors, putting
[2:08:27.160 --> 2:08:32.600]  competing U.S. companies out of business. This is all old news. This is literally decades
[2:08:32.600 --> 2:08:34.640]  old news. As I pointed out before, their economic assault
[2:08:34.640 --> 2:08:38.840]  and their rights violations are part of the same problem. They both... All right, all
[2:08:38.840 --> 2:08:43.040]  right, pull it down. This is hilarious. I mean, honestly, this is just comical stuff.
[2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:49.520]  So now, Info Wars is next decade's news today on the Department of Justice. Everything they're
[2:08:49.520 --> 2:08:57.280]  talking about is old news, folks. You understand? Look, I'm sorry. This is just so hilarious
[2:08:57.280 --> 2:09:02.880]  that this is what this event ended up being. Folks, again, I'm going to tell you. This
[2:09:02.880 --> 2:09:06.920]  is actually really bad news for the Biden administration, quite frankly, and, well,
[2:09:06.920 --> 2:09:11.960]  this is bad news for the country. But specifically, this is bad news for the Biden administration.
[2:09:11.960 --> 2:09:16.760]  They're not getting cooperation out of China on the Russia-Ukraine situation, and China
[2:09:16.760 --> 2:09:24.480]  is actually helping Russia. And so this is the Biden administration trying to... I don't
[2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:29.280]  even know, really. I guess think that this is going to intimidate China. Like China's
[2:09:29.280 --> 2:09:33.360]  going to be threatened by the Biden family that they have blackmail on. Are you kidding
[2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:38.920]  me? Like Merrick Garland and Christopher Wray are going to stand up to China, and they're
[2:09:38.920 --> 2:09:42.880]  going to sit here and be like, we care about the censorship of free speech in China. We
[2:09:42.880 --> 2:09:46.960]  care about the intellectual property theft. We care about this stuff. This is all old
[2:09:46.960 --> 2:09:51.940]  news. Why are they bringing it up today? They're bringing it up today because China is not
[2:09:51.940 --> 2:09:57.760]  cooperating with them on the situation in Ukraine. That's what this is all about. That's
[2:09:57.760 --> 2:10:02.240]  what this is all about right here. Everything they're telling you they've known for years,
[2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:07.480]  everything they're telling you is decades old news. This is 100% because China is siding
[2:10:07.480 --> 2:10:11.400]  with Russia in the Ukrainian war. And so they're going to act... They're going to front
[2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:15.040]  to China like, we're going to do something about your corruption. We know you've got
[2:10:15.040 --> 2:10:19.040]  spies here. We know you've got intelligence chiefs here. We're going to do something about
[2:10:19.040 --> 2:10:25.320]  it. They're not going to do jack crap. And China knows it because China owns the Bidens.
[2:10:25.320 --> 2:10:30.240]  I mean, we've got phone calls, emails, texts about Hunter Biden bragging about how he cuts
[2:10:30.240 --> 2:10:36.080]  deals with the richest Chinese people in the world. So this is ridiculous stuff coming
[2:10:36.080 --> 2:10:40.000]  out of the Biden administration. And they assume that people are so stupid, they're
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:43.760]  not going to see what's actually going on here. But that's why you're tuned into InfoWars
[2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:48.800]  because we'll tell it like it is. So whatever he's talking about, forget about it. This
[2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:54.320]  is all the Biden administration fronting to China because they're supporting Russia in
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:10:58.960]  the situation with Ukraine and now becoming an ally of Russia in the larger geopolitical
[2:10:58.960 --> 2:11:03.280]  picture. But let's go back at least. I'll finish off the segment with a little bit
[2:11:03.280 --> 2:11:08.040]  more here. But then I'm going to put this propaganda away and we'll move on. But here
[2:11:08.040 --> 2:11:09.040]  we go.
[2:11:09.040 --> 2:11:15.440]  They see the type of CCP hypocrisy on display in our Fox Hunt case today. Yet another case
[2:11:15.440 --> 2:11:21.160]  where the Chinese government officials and co-conspirators mercilessly harassed a naturalized
[2:11:21.160 --> 2:11:22.160]  U.S. citizen.
[2:11:22.160 --> 2:11:24.360]  When have you ever had a press conference about China?
[2:11:24.360 --> 2:11:25.360]  When?
[2:11:25.360 --> 2:11:26.360]  Ever.
[2:11:26.360 --> 2:11:29.360]  Tell me. Maybe Donald Trump...
[2:11:56.360 --> 2:12:04.360]  They're focused on repression, not law enforcement. But our partners also see the CCP's broader
[2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:10.320]  hypocrisy. The fact that while the CCP claims to stand for sovereignty and non-interference
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:16.480]  in other affairs, what the Chinese government actually does is interfere with sovereign
[2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:20.680]  governments around the world whenever doing so suits Beijing.
[2:12:20.680 --> 2:12:22.440]  And what about what we do in Ukraine?
[2:12:22.440 --> 2:12:28.800]  Working with our independent judiciary, violating both our sovereignty and the norms of police
[2:12:28.800 --> 2:12:37.600]  conduct to run lawless intimidation campaigns here in our backyards and corrupting our academic
[2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:39.840]  freedom to further their campaign of repression.
[2:12:39.840 --> 2:12:43.480]  Thank God Chris Ray is telling you this now.
[2:12:43.480 --> 2:12:48.520]  The FBI is going to continue to say what we mean and mean what we say. So our partners,
[2:12:48.520 --> 2:12:53.960]  both here and abroad, many of whom tell us they're battling Chinese aggression themselves.
[2:12:53.960 --> 2:12:56.520]  And probably begging you for help for years, you've been ignoring them.
[2:12:56.520 --> 2:13:00.520]  Against the Chinese government and countless other dangers.
[2:13:00.520 --> 2:13:01.520]  Wow.
[2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:06.720]  Finally, let me urge any person or company being targeted or approached by the Chinese
[2:13:06.720 --> 2:13:09.560]  government to come to the FBI for help.
[2:13:09.560 --> 2:13:16.880]  No American citizen, resident, company, or university should battle this threat alone.
[2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:21.880]  You don't have to. You can report information through your local FBI field office or online
[2:13:21.880 --> 2:13:22.880]  at FBI.gov.
[2:13:22.880 --> 2:13:27.360]  The Biden administration is coming after the Chinese communists now and they're coming
[2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:30.160]  after the Chinese spies, I'm sure of it.
[2:13:30.160 --> 2:13:33.280]  Not the Chinese people and certainly not Chinese Americans.
[2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:39.120]  I want to congratulate all the FBI special agents, intelligence analysts and professional
[2:13:39.120 --> 2:13:44.840]  staff who have worked on these cases, as well as our partners at CBP and the IRS.
[2:13:44.840 --> 2:13:49.260]  All right, so that's fine. So there you go. Pull it down. Oh, yes. Oh, the Chinese communists
[2:13:49.260 --> 2:13:50.260]  are the worst.
[2:13:50.260 --> 2:13:54.480]  Oh, yeah, because you don't do that same thing here to Americans. You don't. You don't censor
[2:13:54.480 --> 2:13:55.480]  Americans free speech.
[2:13:55.480 --> 2:14:00.680]  Oh, wait. Yeah, you do right out of the White House. Folks, this is just embarrassing. Honestly,
[2:14:00.680 --> 2:14:05.440]  it's just it's so low IQ at this point.
[2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:10.560]  You can find dozens, if not hundreds of stories about Chinese theft of intellectual property
[2:14:10.560 --> 2:14:11.560]  in America.
[2:14:11.560 --> 2:14:12.560]  They've never had a press conference.
[2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:16.920]  I mean, look, here's the Washington Post in March.
[2:14:16.920 --> 2:14:21.400]  This is the Washington Post in March. Inside Hunter Biden's multi million dollar deals
[2:14:21.400 --> 2:14:23.400]  with the Chinese energy company.
[2:14:23.400 --> 2:14:28.880]  Do you really think any of these people are going to do a damn thing about China and Chinese
[2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:30.760]  interference in this country?
[2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:35.200]  No. I mean, they might they don't pull a few hairs. Maybe they'll maybe they'll trim
[2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:37.080]  a few hedges.
[2:14:37.080 --> 2:14:42.480]  The Bidens are owned by China. Half the Democrat Party is probably owned by China. Hell, private
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:46.080]  Republican leadership is owned by China, too. Just look at Mitch McConnell's wife. Even
[2:14:46.080 --> 2:14:48.080]  Donald Trump called that out.
[2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:53.520]  So this is all this stuff that they're talking about. I'm not denying it's real. I'm not
[2:14:53.520 --> 2:14:57.120]  denying the stories and the stuff the FBI is doing against Chinese communists is real.
[2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:02.200]  I'm sure it is real, but it's all old news. It's been going on for years. It's been going
[2:15:02.200 --> 2:15:05.600]  on for decades. They've never had a press conference. They've never given a damn. They've
[2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:10.360]  never cared about warning the American people. Fauci funds biological weapons labs research
[2:15:10.360 --> 2:15:16.840]  in Chinese military labs. The Bidens do multi-million dollar deals with the Chinese communists.
[2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:22.840]  So many others in D.C. do. So I mean, this is just a joke. This is just a joke. Understand
[2:15:22.840 --> 2:15:24.960]  what this is really about.
[2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:31.920]  This is the Biden administration upset that China is supporting Russia in the war in Ukraine
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:37.000]  and that China is now becoming an ally with Russia in the larger geopolitical picture.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:41.800]  That's all this was about. So the stuff in that was probably real. There are spies here,
[2:15:41.800 --> 2:15:45.200]  intellectual property theft, censorship. That's all real. The Chinese do all that. No doubt
[2:15:45.200 --> 2:15:50.200]  about it. They've known about it for years. They're only making it a public thing today
[2:15:50.200 --> 2:15:57.520]  as an intimidation factor against the Chinese for siding with Russia in Ukraine.
[2:15:57.520 --> 2:16:01.760]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny. But when you fight tyranny,
[2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:07.320]  the new world order comes after you. Now, I knew that. And for 28 years, I've been on
[2:16:07.320 --> 2:16:11.280]  air, exposed these people, and together we've had a great effect. But listen, they're coming
[2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:14.760]  after us right now. They're trying to shut us down, but they can't beat the power of

[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:15.880]  that is info wars. Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and
[2:17:15.880 --> 2:17:23.560]  Ball Sonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards
[2:17:23.560 --> 2:17:29.840]  firing up their main base to defeat the new world order. The only reason humanity is still
[2:17:29.840 --> 2:17:36.000]  in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action

[2:19:58.800 --> 2:20:04.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:03:41.740 --> 2:20:53.920]  folks, we've got a big problem and that's the biggest criminals perhaps in
[2:20:53.920 --> 2:20:59.200]  the world reside in Washington, DC. They're called American politicians and the whole
[2:20:59.200 --> 2:21:04.640]  world knows them. And Donald Trump wasn't one of them. That's why they had to get Trump
[2:21:04.640 --> 2:21:10.200]  out of office. That's why they had to destroy Trump. And that's why we're in the position
[2:21:10.200 --> 2:21:17.880]  we're in today with so much going wrong in this country. And this just came from the
[2:21:17.880 --> 2:21:29.320]  Washington Post Liberals urge Biden to rethink Ukraine strategy. You guys are so stupid.
[2:21:29.320 --> 2:21:34.640]  You don't realize that they don't give a damn what you think this is a much bigger agenda
[2:21:34.640 --> 2:21:39.800]  and a money laundering operation. The UN said $6 billion could solve world hunger when they
[2:21:39.800 --> 2:21:45.040]  wanted to make Elon Musk look bad, but Biden's give $100 billion to Ukraine and nobody talks
[2:21:45.040 --> 2:21:49.960]  about world hunger then. Amazing stuff. So yeah, yeah, the Ukraine strategy should have
[2:21:49.960 --> 2:21:56.200]  been rethought a long time ago. It was already decided they would fight Russia. It was already
[2:21:56.200 --> 2:21:59.800]  decided they'd send troops to the front lines. It was already decided that they'll have a
[2:21:59.800 --> 2:22:04.560]  nuclear confrontation. They already decided all of it. There's no rethinking. It's already
[2:22:04.560 --> 2:22:11.800]  been thought out and planned out. That's cute though. That's cute that you think the military
[2:22:11.800 --> 2:22:17.520]  industrial complex and the heads of the Democrat and Republican Party want to listen to you
[2:22:17.520 --> 2:22:21.640]  when it comes to peace and not war. That's hilarious. That's really cute. You must be
[2:22:21.640 --> 2:22:26.480]  really naive. Now I want to get into some vaccine issues before we're joined by Savannah
[2:22:26.480 --> 2:22:31.080]  Hernandez. But first, remember they told you that vaccine would be safe and effective
[2:22:31.080 --> 2:22:36.360]  and wouldn't and you wouldn't get sick and you wouldn't transmit the disease if you had
[2:22:36.360 --> 2:22:40.680]  it. Remember that? Well, in case you don't, here's a little reminder. And when people
[2:22:40.680 --> 2:22:48.640]  are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected. You're okay.
[2:22:48.640 --> 2:22:57.240]  You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations. Our data from the CDCs
[2:22:57.240 --> 2:23:05.600]  today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick. It's not
[2:23:05.600 --> 2:23:13.960]  just in the clinical trials, but it's also in real world data. If you get vaccinated,
[2:23:13.960 --> 2:23:16.960]  that vaccine will basically prevent you from getting sick with COVID. It will prevent you
[2:23:16.960 --> 2:23:20.200]  from having to go to the hospital with COVID symptoms. It will prevent you from dying from
[2:23:20.200 --> 2:23:25.040]  COVID. Great. Good for you. What this means is that we can get there with vaccines instead
[2:23:25.040 --> 2:23:31.000]  of the virus, being able to hop from person to person to person, potentially mutating
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:35.440]  and becoming more virulent and drug resistant along the way. Now we know that the vaccines
[2:23:35.440 --> 2:23:42.760]  work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person. A vaccinated person
[2:23:42.760 --> 2:23:49.440]  gets exposed to the virus. The virus does not infect them. The virus cannot then use
[2:23:49.440 --> 2:23:55.840]  that person to go anywhere else. It cannot use a vaccinated person as a host to go get
[2:23:55.840 --> 2:24:01.400]  more people. She says the propaganda was so much confidence. Everyone who takes the vaccine
[2:24:01.400 --> 2:24:07.120]  is not just protecting themselves, but reducing their transmission to other people and allowing
[2:24:07.120 --> 2:24:15.320]  society to get back to normal. We need humans to just die. Right now, that are telling us
[2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:21.840]  that there is a protection against transmission of the disease. There is no variant that we
[2:24:21.840 --> 2:24:33.800]  can identify that escapes the protection of our vaccine. There's all your vaccine pushers
[2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:41.440]  lying to you about that vaccine. Can I sue them? I want to sue them for $39 quadrillion.
[2:24:41.440 --> 2:24:49.480]  I want to sue them for $39 quadrillion. Why not? If they can sue InfoWars for $2.75 trillion,
[2:24:49.480 --> 2:24:54.960]  why can't I sue them for quadrillions after lying to us about the vaccine that impacted
[2:24:54.960 --> 2:25:01.200]  hundreds of millions if not billions of people. I think those liars owe the planet quadrillions
[2:25:01.200 --> 2:25:09.240]  of dollars. U.S. still denies entry to unvaccinated legal travelers, but not illegal aliens walking
[2:25:09.240 --> 2:25:14.760]  across the open border. It's a joke that goes around, but there's truth to it. If you're
[2:25:14.760 --> 2:25:18.720]  not vaccinated and you want to travel to America, just travel to Mexico and then walk across
[2:25:18.720 --> 2:25:25.040]  the border. You'll get a free ride and maybe some nice cash for your vacation as well.
[2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:29.320]  Of course, that's just a complete joke. But see, that's what it's all about. Oh, see,
[2:25:29.320 --> 2:25:35.320]  the law-abiding citizens, oh, yes, get that vaccine. Now you can abide by the law, but
[2:25:35.320 --> 2:25:37.960]  the people that don't abide by the law, they just get to do whatever they want. Oh, you're
[2:25:37.960 --> 2:25:42.120]  an illegal immigrant. Oh, you didn't take the vaccine. Oh, everything's good for you.
[2:25:42.120 --> 2:25:47.020]  That same logic applies with the gun debate. Oh, criminals are just going to turn their
[2:25:47.020 --> 2:25:51.520]  guns in when they make them illegal. Come on, man. All we got to do is make guns illegal
[2:25:51.520 --> 2:25:54.040]  and criminals are going to turn their guns in. Kind of like all we have to do is make
[2:25:54.040 --> 2:26:01.120]  murder illegal and nobody will murder anymore. So, oh, you, the law-abiding citizen, you
[2:26:01.120 --> 2:26:05.760]  disarm yourself. You, the law-abiding citizen, you turn over your gun and now you become
[2:26:05.760 --> 2:26:10.680]  the victim. Now you become the slave. But oh, the criminal that doesn't turn his gun
[2:26:10.680 --> 2:26:18.680]  in, now he's got the upper hand. See how that works? What did Jill Biden mean? Fake Dr.
[2:26:18.680 --> 2:26:25.400]  Jill, what did she mean when she predicted a wave of cancer diagnosis, diagnoses after
[2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:31.560]  COVID-19? Does she know something we don't know? Does she mean COVID-19 or the COVID-19
[2:26:31.560 --> 2:26:37.400]  vaccine? Because we are seeing a spike in brain cancers, specifically since the COVID-19
[2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:41.440]  vaccine. Neurological problems, brain problems, one of the main side effects. What does she
[2:26:41.440 --> 2:26:50.520]  know? What does she know? Gateway pointed headline. COVID-19 was made in a lab without
[2:26:50.520 --> 2:26:55.240]  a reckoning. Even more deadly pandemics are in our future. That's right. Because we're
[2:26:55.240 --> 2:26:59.720]  not putting an end to this deadly research by mad scientists like Anthony Fauci, they're
[2:26:59.720 --> 2:27:03.120]  going to make another bio weapon in a lab and it's going to escape. They already brag
[2:27:03.120 --> 2:27:09.040]  about how they have one in Boston that kills 80% of the mice that get infected with it.
[2:27:09.040 --> 2:27:13.800]  And so they say, oh, look, this COVID gain of function research we did in Boston, which
[2:27:13.800 --> 2:27:17.520]  is totally illegal in the US. I don't know how it has been rated and shut down. Oh, look,
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:23.880]  it kills 80% of humans. Aren't we great? Aren't we the best? Look at how great we are. We made
[2:27:23.880 --> 2:27:30.960]  a virus that'll kill 80% of you. Give us a peace prize. CDC votes to add COVID-19 vaccines
[2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:34.720]  to childhood immunization schedule. So it doesn't matter that it doesn't work. It doesn't
[2:27:34.720 --> 2:27:38.700]  matter all the side effects and the heart attacks and the mild carditis and the cancers.
[2:27:38.700 --> 2:27:46.040]  Give that thing to your kids. Be a good slave. Disarm yourself and make them take the forced
[2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:52.760]  medical procedures. And of course, what happened immediately upon the CDC unanimously voting
[2:27:52.760 --> 2:27:58.680]  to add COVID-19 vaccines to the childhood schedule? Pfizer hikes US COVID vaccine price
[2:27:58.680 --> 2:28:07.320]  to $130 per dose. Isn't that just amazing? Pfizer loves you so much. Oh, oh, and I'm sure
[2:28:07.320 --> 2:28:14.720]  there's no collusion. I will bet. I would bet a lot of money that at least one of the
[2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:20.400]  15 people that voted unanimously to make the COVID-19 vaccine on the childhood immunization
[2:28:20.400 --> 2:28:24.040]  schedule, I would bet at least one of them. I'd bet a lot. I'd bet at all that at least
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:28.040]  one of them ends up working for Pfizer. You don't think this whole thing was planned out,
[2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:33.760]  right? Give me a break. Pfizer knew they were going to get the votes. They've got these
[2:28:33.760 --> 2:28:40.320]  CDC officials, bureaucrats in their back pocket, and they had the price hike ready to go. But
[2:28:40.320 --> 2:28:44.680]  they admit scientists and doctors divided over whether myocarditis concerns would influence
[2:28:44.680 --> 2:28:49.400]  vaccine recommendations. Yeah, that vaccine might give your 15-year-old a heart attack
[2:28:49.400 --> 2:28:52.680]  and they wouldn't even get COVID. They wouldn't even know if they did. But you know what?
[2:28:52.680 --> 2:28:59.680]  It's probably worth it to give them that heart attack anyway.

[2:31:57.760 --> 2:32:02.840]  Look around you. Everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions
[2:32:02.840 --> 2:32:08.240]  is now happening. Infowar is credibility. My credibility has never been higher, and
[2:32:08.240 --> 2:32:13.600]  it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship
[2:32:13.600 --> 2:32:19.200]  and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air. But now we're reaching the most
[2:32:19.200 --> 2:32:25.920]  critical juncture in the fight together. So I want to ask all of you today to help keep
[2:32:25.920 --> 2:32:30.960]  me on the air. In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I've
[2:32:30.960 --> 2:32:35.560]  been forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund
[2:32:35.560 --> 2:32:43.560]  those myself. It's unsustainable. So please visit saveinfowarstore.com, saveinfowarstore.com,
[2:32:43.560 --> 2:32:49.160]  where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that
[2:32:49.160 --> 2:32:53.800]  I can continue to persevere. I'll never give up. I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[2:32:53.800 --> 2:32:58.800]  Make it for your support. Wouldn't be without you, saveinfowarstore.com.
[2:32:58.800 --> 2:33:24.800]  Including a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:24.800 --> 2:33:42.800]  I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:33:42.800 --> 2:34:05.800]  I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:34:05.800 --> 2:34:20.800]  I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:34:20.800 --> 2:34:49.800]  I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:34:49.800 --> 2:35:18.800]  I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:35:18.800 --> 2:35:47.800]  I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:35:47.800 --> 2:36:16.800]  I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:36:16.800 --> 2:36:36.800]  I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:36:36.800 --> 2:36:50.800]  So, we're looking at two different phenomenons now. We've got the Democrats giving needles. It's the Clean Needle Program, and so they give out entire drug kits that include needles and other stuff.
[2:36:50.800 --> 2:36:57.800]  And I guess, so in the first individual that we saw passed out on the street there that had overdosed, was he overdosed on heroin?
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:07.800]  So, it was either heroin or fentanyl. I did go try to ask the firefighters who came to his aid to which they responded. Well, technically, we can't tell you because that would be a hip violation.
[2:37:07.800 --> 2:37:20.800]  But they thought it was fentanyl related. In my report, I do say heroin at first. Because of the needles, we thought it was heroin. But again, we really couldn't tell, but the official said potentially fentanyl.
[2:37:20.800 --> 2:37:27.800]  And most of these needles, are these provided by the government? Are they getting these for free?
[2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:41.800]  So, I did ask a couple of the addicts on the ground to which they responded. They get them from other organizations. I didn't have enough time during this report to investigate if those organizations are federally funded or funded by the state,
[2:37:41.800 --> 2:37:51.800]  which I would imagine they are because that's what happened in San Francisco, right? You have urban alchemy and they provide clean needles for the people on the streets of San Francisco.
[2:37:51.800 --> 2:37:59.800]  They are funded by the officials in San Francisco, by San Francisco's leaders. So, I imagine it's very similar in Portland.
[2:37:59.800 --> 2:38:14.800]  Now, the fentanyl is a little, I'm a little confused about this because we're kind of getting mixed messaging. I mean, there's no doubt the fentanyl is probably the deadliest street drug right now. It's killing middle-aged men in this country more than anything else.
[2:38:14.800 --> 2:38:22.800]  And then we have reports from Border Patrol and others saying, look at all this fentanyl we recovered, by the way, just this much fentanyl can kill you.
[2:38:22.800 --> 2:38:32.800]  But yet, these guys are out here smoking fentanyl, injecting fentanyl. How is that the case? I mean, are they asking for fentanyl? Is that actually what they want?
[2:38:32.800 --> 2:38:36.800]  They're trying to get the fentanyl. They don't think it's going to kill them?
[2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:42.800]  I don't think that they care. The drug addict that I got on camera, because I did ask him, why do you smoke?
[2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:54.800]  Like, just be very honest with me. Why are you doing these hard drugs that you know are bad for you? Which he responded, well, a little part of you just has to want to die. He shared with me that he died three times last year.
[2:38:54.800 --> 2:39:02.800]  So, again, the people on the streets really do enjoy fentanyl, I guess. I don't know. I mean, I only talked to a couple of drug addicts here.
[2:39:02.800 --> 2:39:12.800]  But I think that with the case of fentanyl killing people across the United States, it's because it's laced in a lot of these other more common drugs like cocaine or weed.
[2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:20.800]  We just previously saw three New Yorkers, and these are high-end New Yorkers if you had a lawyer or someone who works on Wall Street, and then I believe a teacher or a social worker who just died from...
[2:39:20.800 --> 2:39:22.800]  Yeah, not people you would expect to buy cocaine.
[2:39:22.800 --> 2:39:31.800]  Yeah, exactly. But it's because the cocaine is laced with fentanyl. So when the people on the streets are smoking fentanyl, like this guy, they know how to dose it out properly, apparently,
[2:39:31.800 --> 2:39:40.800]  or they're mixing it with other drugs. But it is very prevalent in San Francisco. I already detailed the fentanyl crawl, and you'll go there, and you see people hunched over.
[2:39:40.800 --> 2:39:50.800]  It looks like they're dead, and they hunched over for like six hours, and that is fentanyl. So Portland, maybe their drugs are a little bit different up there, but it definitely is on the street.
[2:39:50.800 --> 2:40:00.800]  Well, it does make you wonder. Again, you brought up the story. I think it was two women and a man in New York that bought some cocaine off of a delivery service site.
[2:40:00.800 --> 2:40:16.800]  And they ended up getting fentanyl laced cocaine. Three of them died. And so, obviously, fentanyl is deadly in small doses, but yet, I guess, these drug addicts, maybe they're...
[2:40:16.800 --> 2:40:28.800]  I don't know if they're used to it, or they, like you said, know how to use it properly, because that just... I mean, they just, they know, but they know how deadly it is, right? So they just don't care.
[2:40:28.800 --> 2:40:35.800]  Yeah, they just don't care. I asked them point blank, and they said, well, part of you wants to die. And the thing is, is they are dying on the street.
[2:40:35.800 --> 2:40:46.800]  Like I said, I was there for two hours. I'm watching somebody overdose on the side of the street, and it's because they don't care if they die or not, because they know that the firefighters will come and check them with Narcan, restart their heart, and then they can continue doing their drugs.
[2:40:46.800 --> 2:40:52.800]  So these people, technically, are dying from fentanyl. They're just being revived multiple times.
[2:40:52.800 --> 2:41:06.800]  Now, how often you said, we saw you talking to some law enforcement there, are they basically just patrolling the streets in case at any moment they turn a corner and somebody's passed out on the side of the road, and they got to go revive them?
[2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:18.800]  I mean, the reason the police rolled up to this scene is because we called them, and I was actually walking down the street to Portland at night, because there was one night where I was like, well, I'm just going to go to this food truck.
[2:41:18.800 --> 2:41:29.800]  It's about a half mile away. I'll just walk down there. And the best way I can describe the streets of Portland is like a house of horrors, right? Like every time you turn a corner, there's something scarier and more disturbing around the next corner.
[2:41:29.800 --> 2:41:38.800]  And so I feel like the police are just in the area, in the vicinity, because every single block, you're going to have somebody who is either overdosing, having a schizophrenic episode.
[2:41:38.800 --> 2:41:49.800]  I was walking down the street in the middle of the night and this black man was going, I want to kill all white people. I hate white people. I'm scared of white people. I turned down the corner. This woman is crying and sobbing on the ground.
[2:41:49.800 --> 2:41:59.800]  It's terrifying on the streets of Portland. And so I mean, I would imagine that there's just police there busy all hours of the day because of the amount of crime that's taking place on top of that as well.
[2:41:59.800 --> 2:42:12.800]  Apparently, Portland police do not pull people over for low level traffic violations anymore. So you also have people driving throughout Portland without license plates on one of the residents that I interviewed said, Oh yeah, my neighbor's catalytic converter was being stolen.
[2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:20.800]  He called the police and they asked, Hey, is there any way for you to identify the people who were doing this to which she responded? No, because they're not driving around with license plates.
[2:42:20.800 --> 2:42:35.800]  So how are these drug addicts funding their addiction property crimes? And how are they doing that as well by not getting identified if they're driving either unlicensed vehicles or, you know, again, just not even being arrested because this is legal in the city.
[2:42:35.800 --> 2:42:50.800]  You know, I gotta say, it's always kind of been this way for me as a kid and maybe others can relate. I'll ask Savannah this on the other side. But I remember, you know, I would go to ball games and stuff downtown St. Louis. You'd see homeless people begging for money. And it always breaks my heart. You know, it breaks your heart to see people in that state.
[2:42:50.800 --> 2:42:55.800]  But I mean, to walk down the street and see that it must be crushing.
[2:42:55.800 --> 2:43:15.800]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you. And the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars, because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and
[2:43:15.800 --> 2:43:32.800]  tyranny. That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links, info wars.com and to also financially support info wars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using promo code 1776 at checkout to get additional 10% off.

[2:43:58.800 --> 2:44:16.800]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist. I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but the world. We are engaging the globalist at point blank range in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit.
[2:44:16.800 --> 2:44:33.800]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support info wars are the real reason you've had this success. We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had. We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.

[2:45:56.800 --> 2:46:08.800]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[2:46:08.800 --> 2:46:17.800]  The first amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away your ability to speak freely. So they're going to go from Mike Lindell next or they're going to go for Steve Bannon or going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[2:46:17.800 --> 2:46:34.800]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years. And I knew they were planning all of this. And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere. But I couldn't have done it without your support. And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda.
[2:46:34.800 --> 2:46:49.800]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful info wars has been because of your past support. So I salute you. And I thank you.

[2:47:05.800 --> 2:47:30.800]  The Van Hernandez is with us. She's one of those thought criminals that's banned all over the internet, but that doesn't stop her from doing great work. And so I'm just curious when you're out there in Portland, it's been a few years since I was there and they threatened to kill me so I decided to never come back.
[2:47:30.800 --> 2:47:45.800]  You know, I guess that's just a fool's errand to not want to go back to a place that threatens to kill you. But seeing this has to be heartbreaking. I mean, I get heartbroken when I see homeless people. I mean, I don't I don't like seeing it. I don't like seeing the mental illness.
[2:47:45.800 --> 2:47:59.800]  I don't like seeing the drug abuse. Doesn't mean I hate those people. I don't like seeing it. It breaks my heart. But I mean, it looks like Portland is just done. I mean, the city as a whole just looks completely shot unlivable.
[2:47:59.800 --> 2:48:11.800]  When I was walking down the street, I walked past a bag of human feces, which is something I haven't even seen in San Francisco or New York. Granted, you know, those are very big cities. I was just in downtown Portland in that one area.
[2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:25.800]  But the fact that this is normalized and is insane, not only the homelessness, the dirtiness, just the straight up rot of the city, but you're completely right. I was looking around and as I was watching a couple of homeless people have a schizophrenic episode on the side of the road.
[2:48:25.800 --> 2:48:37.800]  I realized that their leaders have abandoned them, that these are literally mentally ill people who have been left to rot on the streets of Portland. And this is what it looks like truly when you do give government more power, right?
[2:48:37.800 --> 2:48:48.800]  The power to decriminalize drugs makes beautiful utopia. If you look at the West Coast from California to Washington, this is supposed to be the liberal stronghold, right?
[2:48:48.800 --> 2:48:57.800]  These are supposed to be the examples of what progressive policy looks like. And that's why we never see mainstream media reporters on the ground there, because this is the reality of it.
[2:48:57.800 --> 2:49:11.800]  Their leaders have completely abandoned them. And similarly, our leaders will gladly abandon us, turn America into this third world hellhole, and then they will be so far removed in their ivory towers that they're not seeing or dealing with any of this.
[2:49:11.800 --> 2:49:24.800]  The Portland resident that I spoke to said that homeless people straight up crawl into their homes through open windows or through the doors. People will come still cars if they're left idling for too long with children inside of them and just drive off.
[2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:38.800]  So this is the state of Portland. And, you know, again, going back to the drug users on the ground, these people need help. They're mentally ill. I actually had an off-camera conversation with Randall, the guy who was smoking the Percocets in Fentanyl.
[2:49:38.800 --> 2:49:47.800]  I asked him, what do you think the legitimate response to this should be? Because there's clearly people out here who need help. And he even said, yeah, we need to bring back mental institutions.
[2:49:47.800 --> 2:50:02.800]  And I asked him about his addiction as well. I was like, I mean, how do you, what do you need? How do you need help? And how can people help you? And he just basically was like, yeah, I need someone to come in and step in and intervene, because I can't combat this addiction myself.
[2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:17.800]  But again, the city leaders have completely abandoned them and it's heartbreaking. So, yeah, it's really difficult to cover these types of stories. And I think the worst part of it, too, is that this isn't even an issue that's in one American city.
[2:50:17.800 --> 2:50:38.800]  You have been wanting to go to St. Louis and Chicago and many of these other Democrat-run cities to highlight how this is an issue that is very common to a specific political leaning ideology, which is why it's so important for us to vote out the evil people in office who will have abandoned their constituents and are allowing drug users and drug addicts to raw on the street.
[2:50:38.800 --> 2:50:55.800]  Well, and if you could say, what is the example of a liberal progressive city? What is the example of when liberal progressive Democrats run a city? And it's Portland. It's San Francisco. I mean, Portland is beautiful. The timber up there, the northwest, it's awesome to look at.
[2:50:55.800 --> 2:51:10.800]  You're driving in and then you get into the city and it's just a total hellhole. It looked like you were talking to a resident there. How many people are left there that are actually just common folk just living their lives, going to work, going to lunch, what have you, meeting up with friends and family, going to church?
[2:51:10.800 --> 2:51:16.800]  I mean, how much of that did you see? I mean, is there any normalcy left there or is it just all degradation?
[2:51:16.800 --> 2:51:29.800]  I'm actually glad you asked that question because Portland still looks like it's in COVID stages, right? You go there to downtown and there's barely anybody walking around. The restaurants there are still closing by 8pm every single night.
[2:51:29.800 --> 2:51:41.800]  I had an early dinner because the restaurants are all closed down. The people are still wearing face masks. Everyone is still afraid of COVID over there. So the normal people who were living in Portland have moved out.
[2:51:41.800 --> 2:51:52.800]  There's a very select few who are still willing to deal with the homelessness, the crime, the drugs, the prostitution that is now prospering on the streets of Portland as a result of their lax policies.
[2:51:52.800 --> 2:52:04.800]  So, I mean, the average person walking through Portland truly is like a pink-haired liberal who is wearing a face mask, working at Starbucks and smashing fashion on the weekends and, you know, part of their local antifa group.
[2:52:04.800 --> 2:52:07.800]  So that's the majority of Portland unfortunately.
[2:52:07.800 --> 2:52:15.800]  I don't see how Portland recovers from this quite frankly. It looks like it's just completely gone. I don't know how you recover.
[2:52:15.800 --> 2:52:21.800]  Yeah, I have no idea either. They need to oust their current leadership. They need to oust Ted Wheeler as mayor.
[2:52:21.800 --> 2:52:31.800]  I even went so far as to go to the nicest parts of Portland as well just to say, okay, you know what, I don't want to be a journalist who goes to one sad street on downtown Portland and says, okay, the whole city is disgusting.
[2:52:31.800 --> 2:52:42.800]  I went to the suburbs. I went to the nicest parts of Portland. I was in downtown and I would venture to say that the suburbs are even worse because they have pushed a lot of the homeless out of downtown.
[2:52:42.800 --> 2:52:49.800]  And so they've made their ways to neighborhoods. If you go and you drive through the neighborhoods in Portland, there's parking lots, right?
[2:52:49.800 --> 2:53:01.800]  There's a street and there's several parking lots that, of course, after 6 p.m. whenever one goes home from work, become filled with people who pitch their tents, who drive up in their trailers.
[2:53:01.800 --> 2:53:11.800]  And again, too, there's just entire streets where people have trailers there and they're just living there on the side of the road and all the trash around them is piling up and that's just the normal scene.
[2:53:11.800 --> 2:53:15.800]  So the neighborhoods, if you think downtown is worse, the neighborhoods are much worse.
[2:53:15.800 --> 2:53:24.800]  Yeah, we see some of that footage. Again, there's no trash service when you have a tent outside of the road, so they just end up littering all over the streets.
[2:53:24.800 --> 2:53:33.800]  So, I mean, if you want an example of what liberal progressive leadership will do to the country, look at Portland, look at San Francisco, it's quite clear.
[2:53:33.800 --> 2:53:39.800]  I'm curious, though, and maybe you asked some of the drug addicts out there that you talked to.
[2:53:39.800 --> 2:53:48.800]  We saw in New York City, they put up an illegal immigrant shelter that's like, I mean, it's pretty nice digs, I would say, for an illegal immigrant.
[2:53:48.800 --> 2:53:51.800]  Pretty nice digs for somebody that may be struggling or may be homeless.
[2:53:51.800 --> 2:53:56.800]  Brand new facilities, nice cots, laundry service, nice new bedsheets.
[2:53:56.800 --> 2:54:04.800]  They got dozens of entertainment sitters with new video games, big flat screen TVs, phones free to use.
[2:54:04.800 --> 2:54:14.800]  I mean, if you set something like that up for the homeless, because, I mean, you know here in Austin, there's a homeless shelter here in Austin, nobody goes there because they can't do drugs in there.
[2:54:14.800 --> 2:54:22.800]  So they go hang out outside, they eat their meals two, three times a day when the food is provided, but they don't go in and live there because they want to be able to do the drugs on the streets.
[2:54:22.800 --> 2:54:25.800]  So you go down by the homeless center, it's a bunch of people outside doing drugs.
[2:54:25.800 --> 2:54:32.800]  If they built a facility like that, do you think the homeless would even want to use that, or would it just be unused?
[2:54:32.800 --> 2:54:35.800]  I think that there would be some homeless that would use it.
[2:54:35.800 --> 2:54:44.800]  I actually did go speak to residents of the Bronx after Mayor Eric Adams tried to set up his first failed migrant center in a beach parking lot in the middle of winter in New York,
[2:54:44.800 --> 2:54:56.800]  which by the way, I believe the city is allocating $1 billion to making migrant shelters up there and, you know, putting these migrants up in their beautiful video game living room areas.
[2:54:56.800 --> 2:55:03.800]  So I do think that the homeless population would use these types of areas when I did go speak to residents in the Bronx.
[2:55:03.800 --> 2:55:06.800]  They did say, yeah, we do have a very big homeless issue here.
[2:55:06.800 --> 2:55:12.800]  The government is allocating so many of our taxpayer dollars to helping this issue, to helping these illegals.
[2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:18.800]  Meanwhile, the residents here are suffering because the homeless are on the streets, the homeless are sleeping in the subway.
[2:55:18.800 --> 2:55:25.800]  And if you go to New York, there are homeless people who would just ride the subway all day long because it's a warm place for them to sit and they don't have to be outside.
[2:55:25.800 --> 2:55:32.800]  So I do think that these types of areas would be utilized by the homeless and it could help with the issue, but we're too busy spending all of our money on illegally.
[2:55:32.800 --> 2:55:35.800]  Yeah, and Ukraine and all this other stuff.
[2:55:35.800 --> 2:55:37.800]  And look, I'm not a socialist.
[2:55:37.800 --> 2:55:41.800]  I'm not somebody that likes free handouts, but I'm also logical.
[2:55:41.800 --> 2:55:51.800]  And I would say if we can expedite all this money to foreign countries, certainly we can put our own homeless as a priority ahead of that to try to clean up our cities and help these people out.
[2:55:51.800 --> 2:56:00.800]  I would much rather be doing that with the billions of dollars than sending it to Ukraine or God knows where else, fixing their infrastructure, building them walls and bridges and everything.
[2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:03.800]  I don't think Portland comes back anytime soon.
[2:56:03.800 --> 2:56:06.800]  If ever, I don't think San Francisco comes back anytime soon.
[2:56:06.800 --> 2:56:10.800]  If ever, you've you've seen the degradation in both of those cities.
[2:56:10.800 --> 2:56:13.800]  And I guess is this going to be kind of a new tour for you?
[2:56:13.800 --> 2:56:18.800]  Just going to Democrat run cities and showing what life is like in those cities.
[2:56:18.800 --> 2:56:21.800]  Definitely. It's a mini series that I've already started.
[2:56:21.800 --> 2:56:24.800]  I've gone to New York, San Francisco, now Portland.
[2:56:24.800 --> 2:56:29.800]  And like I said, I'm going to keep focusing in on this because there's a reason why Democrats don't want us to see their city.
[2:56:29.800 --> 2:56:35.800]  There's a reason why everyone is trying to, you know, label Republicans as fascist authoritarians like in Florida.
[2:56:35.800 --> 2:56:36.800]  And why is that?
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:39.800]  Because if you go to Florida, you think I'm going to find this on the streets of Florida?
[2:56:39.800 --> 2:56:40.800]  Absolutely not.
[2:56:40.800 --> 2:56:41.800]  No.
[2:56:41.800 --> 2:56:47.800]  So of course, they have to attack the leaders of those states because everything is doing so well on the ground and for their residents.
[2:56:47.800 --> 2:56:50.800]  If you go to a Democrat run city, it's absolutely terrifying.
[2:56:50.800 --> 2:56:51.800]  You're not safe.
[2:56:51.800 --> 2:56:53.800]  You're you're walking past criminals all day every day.
[2:56:53.800 --> 2:56:55.800]  You're watching people shoot up in the streets.
[2:56:55.800 --> 2:56:56.800]  You're watching robberies.
[2:56:56.800 --> 2:56:57.800]  You're watching crimes.
[2:56:57.800 --> 2:56:58.800]  The business owners are terrified.
[2:56:58.800 --> 2:56:59.800]  People can't even live there.
[2:56:59.800 --> 2:57:01.800]  They don't want to raise their children there.
[2:57:01.800 --> 2:57:10.800]  Remember in New York, parents are now taking their kids to counseling because the kids are so horrified by the drug users that are just OD on the streets of New York City.
[2:57:10.800 --> 2:57:13.800]  I'm sure the, you know, is very similar in Portland.
[2:57:13.800 --> 2:57:16.800]  A lot of people moving out over there because they're like, I don't want my kids around this.
[2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:18.800]  So that's the reality of these cities.
[2:57:18.800 --> 2:57:28.800]  We're going to continue to highlight it because, you know, this administration can continue to both the side of us and pretend that the open border isn't bringing drugs in every single day and criminals and more homeless.
[2:57:28.800 --> 2:57:33.800]  But we're going to continue to expose it because nobody else seems to want to do the dirty work here.
[2:57:33.800 --> 2:57:36.800]  Sav says official.com is her website.
[2:57:36.800 --> 2:57:39.800]  You can also find her on Band Out Video at Sav says Savannah.
[2:57:39.800 --> 2:57:40.800]  Thank you so much.
[2:57:40.800 --> 2:57:41.800]  All right, folks.

[2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:18.800]  We're going to talk about essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[2:58:18.800 --> 2:58:20.800]  Essential means without these things you die.
[2:58:20.800 --> 2:58:22.800]  And so much the food is debased.
[2:58:22.800 --> 2:58:24.800]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[2:58:24.800 --> 2:58:28.800]  It is critical to bolster our bodies defenses with a product like this.
[2:58:28.800 --> 2:58:31.800]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.

[2:59:44.800 --> 3:00:09.800]  Visit infowarstore.com right now.
[3:00:09.800 --> 3:00:14.800]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:00:14.800 --> 3:00:20.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[3:00:20.800 --> 3:00:43.800]  And remember everybody, do what you can to support info wars because these are critical times and they're blackballing and blacklisting everybody that doesn't swallow the crap that they're shoving out and regurgitating.
[3:00:43.800 --> 3:01:00.800]  And that's what the mainstream media is. It's adults with their head in the toilet ball sucking up the crap and spewing it out and getting angry at you if you don't believe the crap that they believe in.
[3:01:00.800 --> 3:01:03.800]  So do what you can to support info wars.
[3:01:03.800 --> 3:01:05.800]  These are very critical times.
[3:01:05.800 --> 3:01:13.800]  Even, you know, they come up with a name like misinformation, which I find sexist misinformation or I should be gender information.
[3:01:13.800 --> 3:01:16.800]  Let's really be stupid about everything.
[3:01:16.800 --> 3:01:18.800]  And I can't say blackball to blacklisted.
[3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:20.800]  Oh, that's racist.
[3:01:20.800 --> 3:01:22.800]  Let's what we call it.
[3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:25.800]  Woke listed.
[3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:35.800]  So anyway, the, they're silencing everybody that doesn't swallow their crap. And that's end of story.
[3:01:35.800 --> 3:01:38.800]  End of story.
[3:01:38.800 --> 3:01:45.800]  Speaking of which, swallowing crap, you had that CDC director, you saw this on info wars site as well.
[3:01:45.800 --> 3:01:49.800]  That she tested positive for COVID-19.
[3:01:49.800 --> 3:01:58.800]  Now, this is some arrogant loudmouth telling everybody to get the shot, get boosted, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3:01:58.800 --> 3:02:01.800]  And there you got it.
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:05.800]  Totally, totally, waxed and maxed, waxed out.
[3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:10.800]  And she gets the virus.
[3:02:10.800 --> 3:02:20.800]  A vaccine that they said would have a 96% efficacy rate when they sold this to the people.
[3:02:20.800 --> 3:02:23.800]  And now we're going on almost three years later.
[3:02:23.800 --> 3:02:25.800]  Be three years in January.
[3:02:25.800 --> 3:02:30.800]  That's right. The COVID war began in January 2020.
[3:02:30.800 --> 3:02:35.800]  At a China on the lunar new year, the year of the rat.
[3:02:35.800 --> 3:02:38.800]  And there's a rat seller right looking at you.
[3:02:38.800 --> 3:02:42.800]  A rat seller selling a rat crap.
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:45.800]  Why don't you swallow my rat crap?
[3:02:45.800 --> 3:02:48.800]  Get that facts. Get that facts.
[3:02:48.800 --> 3:02:51.800]  Not one word about natural healing.
[3:02:51.800 --> 3:02:55.800]  Not one word about building your immune system.
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:02:59.800]  I know a woman that's a nurse.
[3:02:59.800 --> 3:03:04.800]  Been one for 40 years.
[3:03:04.800 --> 3:03:07.800]  I asked her when you went to nursing school.
[3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:16.800]  Did they teach you anything about building up your immune system, eating healthy supplements?
[3:03:16.800 --> 3:03:20.800]  Nope. Only drugs.
[3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:21.800]  Only drugs.
[3:03:21.800 --> 3:03:29.800]  And remember, there's not one prescription drug that cures nalatropic disease.
[3:03:29.800 --> 3:03:32.800]  Nothing. Nothing.
[3:03:32.800 --> 3:03:33.800]  Nothing.
[3:03:33.800 --> 3:03:36.800]  All they do is they do away with the symptom.
[3:03:36.800 --> 3:03:41.800]  And you saw that thing about that little Chrissy Cuomo.
[3:03:41.800 --> 3:03:42.800]  Another daddy's boy.
[3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:45.800]  I got the job at CNN, the Cartoon News Network.
[3:03:45.800 --> 3:03:46.800]  They find me.
[3:03:46.800 --> 3:03:47.800]  And I got the job with somebody else.
[3:03:47.800 --> 3:03:50.800]  Again, it's one big club and you ain't in it.
[3:03:50.800 --> 3:03:54.800]  And he's having this conversation with Kanye West.
[3:03:54.800 --> 3:03:57.800]  And West says to him, you know, did you work out today?
[3:03:57.800 --> 3:03:58.800]  He said, no, I didn't work out.
[3:03:58.800 --> 3:04:02.800]  He said I took my antidepressants drugs.
[3:04:02.800 --> 3:04:05.800]  And I take them antidepressants every day.
[3:04:05.800 --> 3:04:06.800]  Oh, antidepressant?
[3:04:06.800 --> 3:04:13.800]  You mean you're so damn whacked out, you got to get drugged out?
[3:04:13.800 --> 3:04:20.800]  Oh, you're the arrogant antidepressant guy that shoves his crap out there and gets angry
[3:04:20.800 --> 3:04:23.800]  when people won't swallow it?
[3:04:23.800 --> 3:04:26.800]  Oh, remember when little Chrissy was locked down?
[3:04:26.800 --> 3:04:27.800]  Oh, yeah.
[3:04:27.800 --> 3:04:31.800]  In his house because he had COVID and he was going to spread it to his kids.
[3:04:31.800 --> 3:04:35.800]  Yeah, he was going out bicycling.
[3:04:35.800 --> 3:04:40.800]  This COVID war, again, it's in your magazine, The Trends Journal, week after week after week
[3:04:40.800 --> 3:04:41.800]  after week.
[3:04:41.800 --> 3:04:48.800]  Now they're coming out with all the psychological and sociological damage that it caused.
[3:04:48.800 --> 3:04:53.800]  None of it was based on science, only political science.
[3:04:53.800 --> 3:04:57.800]  We'll be right back.
[3:04:57.800 --> 3:05:00.800]  Look, it's not hype that info wars has changed the world.
[3:05:00.800 --> 3:05:05.800]  It's not hype that your support of info wars is the reason we were able to do this.
[3:05:05.800 --> 3:05:06.800]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[3:05:06.800 --> 3:05:10.800]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[3:05:10.800 --> 3:05:14.800]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[3:05:14.800 --> 3:05:17.800]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge yourselves.
[3:05:17.800 --> 3:05:18.800]  It doesn't just give you more energy.
[3:05:18.800 --> 3:05:19.800]  It doesn't just boost your immune system.
[3:05:19.800 --> 3:05:25.800]  But it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[3:05:25.800 --> 3:05:30.800]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average.
[3:05:30.800 --> 3:05:34.800]  Take a few drops every day and almost everyone has dramatic results.
[3:05:34.800 --> 3:05:35.800]  Plus it funds the info war.
[3:05:35.800 --> 3:05:39.800]  So what do you have to lose but taking action?

[3:06:25.800 --> 3:06:31.800]  Just 7% of Americans have a great deal of trust and confidence in the media.
[3:06:31.800 --> 3:06:34.800]  This is according to a latest Gallup poll.
[3:06:34.800 --> 3:06:37.800]  Just 7%.
[3:06:37.800 --> 3:06:44.800]  But the power they have and the propaganda that they sell, boy, it works perfectly.
[3:06:44.800 --> 3:06:49.800]  This is from today's toilet paper record, the New York Slime.
[3:06:49.800 --> 3:06:52.800]  They call themselves the paper of record.
[3:06:52.800 --> 3:06:57.800]  The paper of record for selling lies, fear and hysteria.
[3:06:57.800 --> 3:07:00.800]  Oh, no, that's not misinformation.
[3:07:00.800 --> 3:07:03.800]  Oh, I got to be careful, gender information.
[3:07:03.800 --> 3:07:05.800]  That's a fact.
[3:07:05.800 --> 3:07:12.800]  These are the low-life scum that sold us the Iraq war.
[3:07:12.800 --> 3:07:14.800]  That's right.
[3:07:14.800 --> 3:07:16.800]  A fact.
[3:07:16.800 --> 3:07:18.800]  A fact.
[3:07:18.800 --> 3:07:22.800]  Ah, them aluminum tubes that he's getting from Niger.
[3:07:22.800 --> 3:07:24.800]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:07:24.800 --> 3:07:28.800]  Saddam Hussein is getting them and he's building those weapons of mass destruction.
[3:07:28.800 --> 3:07:30.800]  Yep.
[3:07:30.800 --> 3:07:32.800]  This is the garbage that they spew out.
[3:07:32.800 --> 3:07:34.800]  Look at this.
[3:07:34.800 --> 3:07:38.800]  All the news that's fit to print.
[3:07:38.800 --> 3:07:42.800]  You mean all the crap that you want to sell?
[3:07:42.800 --> 3:07:45.800]  Is the news that's fit to print?
[3:07:45.800 --> 3:07:47.800]  Who are you talking to?
[3:07:47.800 --> 3:07:53.800]  I'm talking to all the Americans that still have the mind like they're in high school.
[3:07:53.800 --> 3:07:56.800]  Yeah, what they call an adult population.
[3:07:56.800 --> 3:07:58.800]  Look at this.
[3:07:58.800 --> 3:08:07.800]  Look at this terrible, terrible picture here of this poor guy doing a push-up with no legs.
[3:08:07.800 --> 3:08:15.800]  Finding comradery in recovery at an old medical center in Western Ukraine.
[3:08:15.800 --> 3:08:25.800]  War amputees are forming a community as they adjust to their new line.
[3:08:25.800 --> 3:08:27.800]  Terrible.
[3:08:27.800 --> 3:08:29.800]  Terrible, terrible.
[3:08:29.800 --> 3:08:37.800]  Then you go to page six and seven.
[3:08:37.800 --> 3:08:39.800]  Look at this.
[3:08:39.800 --> 3:08:43.800]  Look at this terrible, terrible coverage, right?
[3:08:43.800 --> 3:08:47.800]  How sad.
[3:08:47.800 --> 3:08:49.800]  New York Times.
[3:08:49.800 --> 3:09:04.800]  How come you weren't covering day after day the amputees from America's Iraq war?
[3:09:04.800 --> 3:09:09.800]  Or I should say Iraq war.
[3:09:09.800 --> 3:09:21.800]  Why weren't you covering every day the amputees from America's Afghan war?
[3:09:21.800 --> 3:09:32.800]  The one that only lasted for 20 years brought to you by a little daddy's boy with a pair of cojones much smaller than a mothball.
[3:09:32.800 --> 3:09:36.800]  A little clown of a moron jerk.
[3:09:36.800 --> 3:09:41.800]  George W. Bush.
[3:09:41.800 --> 3:09:43.800]  How come you weren't covering that?
[3:09:43.800 --> 3:10:04.800]  How come you didn't have photos day after day of the American troops that lost their arms and their legs and their minds?
[3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:06.800]  Day after day.
[3:10:06.800 --> 3:10:07.800]  You never did that.
[3:10:07.800 --> 3:10:08.800]  You know why?
[3:10:08.800 --> 3:10:25.800]  Because your low life propaganda prostitutes, your little media whores that put out for your corporate pimp and your government whore masters.
[3:10:25.800 --> 3:10:27.800]  Day after day.
[3:10:27.800 --> 3:10:29.800]  People see this all in those Russians.
[3:10:29.800 --> 3:10:31.800]  Look what they're doing.
[3:10:31.800 --> 3:10:32.800]  Look how terrible this is.
[3:10:32.800 --> 3:10:34.800]  Look at this little clown.
[3:10:34.800 --> 3:10:36.800]  Liddy's little clowns.
[3:10:36.800 --> 3:10:39.800]  And people swallow their crap.
[3:10:39.800 --> 3:10:43.800]  Yeah, Obama, the Nobel piece of crap prize winner.
[3:10:43.800 --> 3:10:46.800]  I want that guy shot out of there.
[3:10:46.800 --> 3:10:50.800]  I want that guy, uh, Gaddafi out of there.
[3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:53.800]  Quote, I'm really good at killing people.
[3:10:53.800 --> 3:10:55.800]  Oh yeah, little Billy Clinton.
[3:10:55.800 --> 3:11:01.800]  Every time he got caught with his pants down, bombs away over Baghdad.
[3:11:01.800 --> 3:11:12.800]  How come you weren't showing the debts of the 500,000 children that Bill Clinton killed because of the sanctions he put on Iraq?
[3:11:12.800 --> 3:11:14.800]  Oh no, that's not me talking.
[3:11:14.800 --> 3:11:22.800]  That's Leslie Stahl at 60 Minutes asking Madeline all that bright or not all that bright.
[3:11:22.800 --> 3:11:28.800]  Who was the UN ambassador at the time?
[3:11:28.800 --> 3:11:36.800]  America's ambassador to the United Nations is the death of 500,000 Iraqi children worth a sanction.
[3:11:36.800 --> 3:11:39.800]  Yes it is.
[3:11:39.800 --> 3:11:42.800]  How come you didn't sell that?
[3:11:42.800 --> 3:11:45.800]  Who wrote this?
[3:11:45.800 --> 3:11:49.800]  Who put this out?
[3:11:49.800 --> 3:11:50.800]  Let's see.
[3:11:50.800 --> 3:11:53.800]  Again, yeah, Madeline not all that bright.
[3:11:53.800 --> 3:11:59.800]  Another daddy's girl.
[3:11:59.800 --> 3:12:08.800]  Article by Eric Nagourney and David Guttenfelder.
[3:12:08.800 --> 3:12:10.800]  Yeah.
[3:12:10.800 --> 3:12:15.800]  Guttenfelder, gutterfelder, gutterfelder.
[3:12:15.800 --> 3:12:17.800]  Yeah, look at these, look at these pictures.
[3:12:17.800 --> 3:12:27.800]  This is in journalism, but they get the people to hate, to hate, to hate, to hate the Russians and keep supporting the war.
[3:12:27.800 --> 3:12:43.800]  And now, ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages, the number now is going to be Congress is trying to push through a bill before they go into the midterms
[3:12:43.800 --> 3:12:53.800]  of another $50 billion of our money to send more weapons of death to Ukraine.
[3:12:53.800 --> 3:13:19.800]  That will now bring the total since February 24th up to, you ready, 115 billion bucks of our money going to the military industrial complex brought to you by the guy playing our head of the Department of Defense, Lloyd Austin.
[3:13:19.800 --> 3:13:22.800]  Oh, General Lloyd Austin.
[3:13:22.800 --> 3:13:23.800]  Yeah.
[3:13:23.800 --> 3:13:26.800]  General Lloyd Austin, you're a brilliant man.
[3:13:26.800 --> 3:13:28.800]  You did a great job in Afghanistan.
[3:13:28.800 --> 3:13:30.800]  Great job in Iraq.
[3:13:30.800 --> 3:13:35.800]  You're a loser, just like Smiley Miley with those baggy eyes.
[3:13:35.800 --> 3:13:37.800]  All you guys, oh, I forgot.
[3:13:37.800 --> 3:13:39.800]  I forgot.
[3:13:39.800 --> 3:13:53.800]  Lloyd Austin was on the board of directors of Raytheon, the second largest defense contractor in the United States before he became our head of the Department of Defense.
[3:13:53.800 --> 3:13:55.800]  No little boys and girls.
[3:13:55.800 --> 3:13:57.800]  It's not a revolving door.
[3:13:57.800 --> 3:14:00.800]  It's an open door.
[3:14:00.800 --> 3:14:04.800]  And they own it.
[3:14:04.800 --> 3:14:09.800]  Yep.
[3:14:09.800 --> 3:14:10.800]  Yeah, look at all that.
[3:14:10.800 --> 3:14:13.800]  Look at all that drag crap.
[3:14:13.800 --> 3:14:14.800]  Look at all the medals I won.
[3:14:14.800 --> 3:14:16.800]  Look at all the medals I won.
[3:14:16.800 --> 3:14:20.800]  What are you stealing, the Boy Scouts?
[3:14:20.800 --> 3:14:23.800]  Save it, man.
[3:14:23.800 --> 3:14:26.800]  Not a word about peace.
[3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:32.800]  Oh, matter of fact, when you talk about peace, you're a piece of crap.
[3:14:32.800 --> 3:14:42.800]  Because Biden came out against that guy, McCarthy, who wants peace, sending less money, the representative.
[3:14:42.800 --> 3:14:50.800]  And Biden said, they said that if they win, they will not likely to continue to fund Ukraine.
[3:14:50.800 --> 3:14:52.800]  These guys don't get it.
[3:14:52.800 --> 3:14:54.800]  It's a lot bigger than Ukraine.
[3:14:54.800 --> 3:14:56.800]  It's Eastern Europe.
[3:14:56.800 --> 3:14:57.800]  It's NATO.
[3:14:57.800 --> 3:15:01.800]  It's really serious, serious, consequential outcome.
[3:15:01.800 --> 3:15:03.800]  Hey, wait a minute.
[3:15:03.800 --> 3:15:04.800]  I don't care about it.
[3:15:04.800 --> 3:15:06.800]  It's not my business.
[3:15:06.800 --> 3:15:13.800]  There's a border war going on between the United States, I mean, between Russia and Ukraine, like 300 years.
[3:15:13.800 --> 3:15:15.800]  Oh, and Biden talking tough.
[3:15:15.800 --> 3:15:17.800]  Oh, the draft dodger, Biden.
[3:15:17.800 --> 3:15:19.800]  What'd you get?
[3:15:19.800 --> 3:15:23.800]  You got a bunch of drafts when you went to college.
[3:15:23.800 --> 3:15:25.800]  And then you claimed you had asthma.
[3:15:25.800 --> 3:15:27.800]  You got asthma.
[3:15:27.800 --> 3:15:29.800]  Yeah, ASS.
[3:15:29.800 --> 3:15:31.800]  Yeah, that's what you got.
[3:15:31.800 --> 3:15:33.800]  Asthma.
[3:15:33.800 --> 3:15:35.800]  Yeah, and it's hit your brain.
[3:15:35.800 --> 3:15:37.800]  Oh, that's why I got a draft deferment.
[3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:43.800]  These tough guys, these tough guys like little Lindsey Graham couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag.
[3:15:43.800 --> 3:15:45.800]  But boy, they love war.
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:49.800]  They're little war whores.
[3:15:49.800 --> 3:15:51.800]  But they don't put out.
[3:15:51.800 --> 3:15:53.800]  Nope.
[3:15:53.800 --> 3:15:54.800]  Just killed.
[3:15:54.800 --> 3:15:55.800]  We'll be right back.
[3:15:55.800 --> 3:16:00.800]  By the will of God and by God working through you and your support,
[3:16:00.800 --> 3:16:07.800]  info wars continues to persevere against attacks never before seen in the western world against independent media.

[3:17:55.800 --> 3:18:03.800]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a coworker that's on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place.
[3:18:03.800 --> 3:18:08.800]  And they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[3:18:08.800 --> 3:18:11.800]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[3:18:11.800 --> 3:18:18.800]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people don't listen and they don't supplement.
[3:18:18.800 --> 3:18:20.800]  It's literally an intervention.
[3:18:20.800 --> 3:18:22.800]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[3:18:22.800 --> 3:18:24.800]  I don't play with Mr. Health.

[3:20:27.800 --> 3:20:29.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:20:29.800 --> 3:20:35.800]  And now your host Gerald Salente.
[3:20:35.800 --> 3:20:38.800]  Hey, great being on Alex Jones show.
[3:20:38.800 --> 3:20:46.800]  Remember, do everything you can to support info wars because they're supporting the truth as the truth is being stolen from us.
[3:20:46.800 --> 3:20:54.800]  And I was talking about the idiocy of going after people that don't want to spend our money to keep flooding the killing fields of Ukraine.
[3:20:54.800 --> 3:21:00.800]  This war would have been over a long time ago if the United States didn't keep sending in all this dough.
[3:21:00.800 --> 3:21:18.800]  And this is from Politico representative Liz Cheney on Sunday, branded Kevin McCarthy, the leader of the pro Putin wing of the GOP.
[3:21:18.800 --> 3:21:26.800]  After the House Minority Leader suggested cutting US funding of Ukraine's war effort.
[3:21:26.800 --> 3:21:32.800]  In an interview with NBC's Chuck Toad or Todd or is it Toad?
[3:21:32.800 --> 3:21:36.800]  Toad. Nothing a little froggy boy.
[3:21:36.800 --> 3:21:40.800]  Meet the prostitutes or meet the press.
[3:21:40.800 --> 3:21:58.800]  Wyoming Republican, who has been unremitting in her criticism over party's turn to Trumpism, unleashed a litany of concerns over McCarthy's potential speakership should Republicans win the House in November.
[3:21:58.800 --> 3:22:16.800]  Look, the speaker is second in line to the presidency, Cheney said, at every moment since, frankly, the aftermath of the election in 2020 when Majority Leader McCarthy has had the opportunity to do the right thing or do something that serves his own political purpose.
[3:22:16.800 --> 3:22:19.800]  He always chooses to serve his own political purpose.
[3:22:19.800 --> 3:22:21.800]  Okay, what is the right thing?
[3:22:21.800 --> 3:22:23.800]  Here's such as the right thing.
[3:22:23.800 --> 3:22:32.800]  So, such as aid to Ukraine, the idea that the party is now no longer going to support the Ukrainian people.
[3:22:32.800 --> 3:22:34.800]  You got it.
[3:22:34.800 --> 3:22:36.800]  I'm not a repulsive Ken.
[3:22:36.800 --> 3:22:39.800]  I'm not a demo crap.
[3:22:39.800 --> 3:22:41.800]  I don't support war.
[3:22:41.800 --> 3:22:55.800]  But you, Cheney, you, you loser, and they still quote this loser who couldn't win the election, loser, now a daddy's girl, a little daddy's girl.
[3:22:55.800 --> 3:22:59.800]  You got there because of Dick Cheney.
[3:22:59.800 --> 3:23:00.800]  Oh, I gotta be proper.
[3:23:00.800 --> 3:23:02.800]  I can't get blacklisted.
[3:23:02.800 --> 3:23:16.800]  I miss Cheney, her father, a war-mongering lowlife lying piece of crap that got us into the Iraq war and the Afghan war.
[3:23:16.800 --> 3:23:29.800]  And this is who the media sells a worthless warhawk-ish clown, a Cheney clown.
[3:23:29.800 --> 3:23:31.800]  I gotta hear this crap.
[3:23:31.800 --> 3:23:34.800]  That's why you listen to info wars.
[3:23:34.800 --> 3:23:36.800]  You don't get this kind of crap.
[3:23:36.800 --> 3:23:38.800]  And that's why you subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[3:23:38.800 --> 3:23:45.800]  We would never do things like, look at this, loser, you're a loser, you're nothing but a daddy's girl.
[3:23:45.800 --> 3:23:47.800]  You got there because you're lying, daddy.
[3:23:47.800 --> 3:23:49.800]  Oh, Alex Jones.
[3:23:49.800 --> 3:23:57.800]  Alex Jones was sued for quote lying according to the toilet paper of record the New York Times.
[3:23:57.800 --> 3:24:00.800]  How about the lies?
[3:24:00.800 --> 3:24:05.800]  That Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda.
[3:24:05.800 --> 3:24:10.800]  That Bush and Cheney and Wolfish wits.
[3:24:10.800 --> 3:24:19.800]  I can't say the other word, but it starts with an S. It's Wolf, you got it, and ends with a T and an S.
[3:24:19.800 --> 3:24:22.800]  One lying clown after another.
[3:24:22.800 --> 3:24:25.800]  How come they're not brought up on trial?
[3:24:25.800 --> 3:24:27.800]  Alex Jones didn't.
[3:24:27.800 --> 3:24:28.800]  I don't believe this.
[3:24:28.800 --> 3:24:29.800]  Why, how dare you?
[3:24:29.800 --> 3:24:38.800]  By the way, go to the Gerald Salenti or the Trends Journal site on YouTube.
[3:24:38.800 --> 3:24:45.800]  And Judge Napolitano and I, we did a judge, this guy's the top constitutional lawyer.
[3:24:45.800 --> 3:24:48.800]  He knows the Constitution like nobody else.
[3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:57.800]  You know, the deal is a judge, Judge Napolitano, and about the illegality of bringing Alex Jones up on trial.
[3:24:57.800 --> 3:25:06.800]  This is a violation of the First Amendment, but the hypocrisy that they could allow Bush and Cheney to get away with these lies.
[3:25:06.800 --> 3:25:13.800]  You know, I had the rally here in July, July 23rd at the Four Corners of Freedom over here, the most historic Four Corners in America.
[3:25:13.800 --> 3:25:19.800]  The only place with pre-revolutionary war buildings where the seeds of democracy was found.
[3:25:19.800 --> 3:25:22.800]  The Four Corners of Peace.
[3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:32.800]  And I had Phil Geraldi, one of the speakers, along with Napolitano, Scott Ritter, and Phil Geraldi.
[3:25:32.800 --> 3:25:33.800]  There it is.
[3:25:33.800 --> 3:25:34.800]  That's the one to check out.
[3:25:34.800 --> 3:25:36.800]  I'm not going to want to miss it.
[3:25:36.800 --> 3:25:40.800]  And Phil Geraldi was a former top CIA guy.
[3:25:40.800 --> 3:25:44.800]  This guy, he was a speaker at my event.
[3:25:44.800 --> 3:25:53.800]  Geraldi was in the office with little Georgie Bush, little Georgie, no Cajones Bush.
[3:25:53.800 --> 3:26:04.800]  Giving him the data, the papers, the information that Saddam Hussein does not have weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al-Qaeda.
[3:26:04.800 --> 3:26:11.800]  They told Geraldi to leave the office.
[3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:17.800]  Geraldi, being a real man, quit the CIA.
[3:26:17.800 --> 3:26:21.800]  He said the whole CIA knew there were no weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al-Qaeda.
[3:26:21.800 --> 3:26:23.800]  Look at this little clown.
[3:26:23.800 --> 3:26:35.800]  88% of the people swallowed this little moron clown's crap that we're going to get Osama bin Laden dead or alive over in Afghanistan.
[3:26:35.800 --> 3:26:38.800]  And they believed the garbage of Mission Impossible.
[3:26:38.800 --> 3:26:42.800]  The Mission Impossible, you spelt it wrong.
[3:26:42.800 --> 3:26:47.800]  Oh, and they call the people that fight Americans when Americans invade their country militants.
[3:26:47.800 --> 3:26:48.800]  I love that.
[3:26:48.800 --> 3:26:52.800]  Iraqi militants try today to, yeah, militant.
[3:26:52.800 --> 3:27:00.800]  If a foreign company comes and tries to take over my country, I'll kill them if they try to kill me.
[3:27:00.800 --> 3:27:02.800]  And I'm a militant.
[3:27:02.800 --> 3:27:04.800]  And this is sick stuff.
[3:27:04.800 --> 3:27:08.800]  Look, we're going to come back in a little bit and I'm going to talk a lot about the economy and where it's going.
[3:27:08.800 --> 3:27:12.800]  As I went on the air, the market's up like over 400 points.
[3:27:12.800 --> 3:27:13.800]  What a joke.
[3:27:13.800 --> 3:27:14.800]  What a joke.
[3:27:14.800 --> 3:27:17.800]  And the whole thing, the whole thing, it's a con game.
[3:27:17.800 --> 3:27:19.800]  We got con artists in front of us.
[3:27:19.800 --> 3:27:21.800]  Look at the clown con artists.
[3:27:21.800 --> 3:27:23.800]  By the way, don't call this a government.
[3:27:23.800 --> 3:27:25.800]  It's an insane asylum.
[3:27:25.800 --> 3:27:29.800]  Again, you look at the cover of the current trends journal.
[3:27:29.800 --> 3:27:32.800]  One flew over the cuckoo's nest.
[3:27:32.800 --> 3:27:36.800]  Yeah, there it is.
[3:27:36.800 --> 3:27:40.800]  It's not a White House.
[3:27:40.800 --> 3:27:42.800]  It's a nut house.
[3:27:42.800 --> 3:27:46.800]  Look at the jerks telling us what to do.
[3:27:46.800 --> 3:27:48.800]  One after another.
[3:27:48.800 --> 3:27:51.800]  Democracy, it's finished.
[3:27:51.800 --> 3:27:53.800]  There we go.
[3:27:53.800 --> 3:27:55.800]  One flew over the cuckoo's nest.
[3:27:55.800 --> 3:27:57.800]  There he is.
[3:27:57.800 --> 3:27:58.800]  The cuckoo in charge.
[3:27:58.800 --> 3:28:00.800]  Another great cover by Anthony Frieda.
[3:28:00.800 --> 3:28:02.800]  What a genius he is.
[3:28:02.800 --> 3:28:05.800]  We talk about things.
[3:28:05.800 --> 3:28:09.800]  It takes us about 10 minutes to talk about what the cover is going to be.
[3:28:09.800 --> 3:28:11.800]  Come up with ideas.
[3:28:11.800 --> 3:28:12.800]  Okay, take it away.
[3:28:12.800 --> 3:28:14.800]  And he takes it away.
[3:28:14.800 --> 3:28:17.800]  But anyway, we're going to come back.
[3:28:17.800 --> 3:28:29.800]  We're going to talk a lot about the economy because now it's more and more likely that the Fed is not going to be as aggressive as people thought they were.
[3:28:29.800 --> 3:28:37.800]  And as we had forecast in the trends journal three weeks ago, it's now becoming the noon.
[3:28:37.800 --> 3:28:42.800]  And that's why your markets are going up because the whole world is going down.
[3:28:42.800 --> 3:28:48.800]  Don't you wish you were living in Europe where your energy prices are up only about 147%?
[3:28:48.800 --> 3:28:50.800]  Well, but the markets are up.
[3:28:50.800 --> 3:28:56.800]  And we'll be back again, do what you can to support info.
[3:28:56.800 --> 3:29:07.800]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[3:29:07.800 --> 3:29:09.800]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[3:29:09.800 --> 3:29:12.800]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[3:29:12.800 --> 3:29:17.800]  So they're going to go from Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[3:29:17.800 --> 3:29:20.800]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years.
[3:29:20.800 --> 3:29:22.800]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[3:29:22.800 --> 3:29:26.800]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without your support.
[3:29:26.800 --> 3:29:34.800]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[3:29:34.800 --> 3:29:39.800]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been because of your past support.
[3:29:39.800 --> 3:29:41.800]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[3:29:41.800 --> 3:29:49.800]  And I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle, three double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.

[3:29:56.800 --> 3:30:04.800]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a coworker that's on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place.
[3:30:04.800 --> 3:30:09.800]  And they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[3:30:09.800 --> 3:30:12.800]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[3:30:12.800 --> 3:30:21.800]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people don't listen and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[3:30:21.800 --> 3:30:23.800]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.

[3:32:11.800 --> 3:32:14.800]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[3:32:14.800 --> 3:32:21.800]  It's came over and all over the planet humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[3:32:21.800 --> 3:32:25.800]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.

[3:32:50.800 --> 3:33:14.800]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[3:33:20.800 --> 3:33:25.800]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:25.800 --> 3:33:28.800]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:28.800 --> 3:33:39.800]  And you know, Alex was just saying about, you know, lots of censorship and, you know, this is democracy and we're losing that in front of our eyes.
[3:33:39.800 --> 3:33:48.800]  It was an article in yesterday's Global Times that's the propaganda paper for the head of China.
[3:33:48.800 --> 3:33:59.800]  And the headline reads, prospects of U.S. style democracy dims as Americans have less faith in their system.
[3:33:59.800 --> 3:34:01.800]  Global time.
[3:34:01.800 --> 3:34:06.800]  The U.S. always portrays itself as a defender of democracy across the world.
[3:34:06.800 --> 3:34:10.800]  Ironically, let's just stop right at that.
[3:34:10.800 --> 3:34:13.800]  That's the lie, the crap that they always spew out.
[3:34:13.800 --> 3:34:21.800]  We're going to bring freedom and democracy to this country as they're stealing it away from us.
[3:34:21.800 --> 3:34:37.800]  But anyway, ironically, with the midterm elections just around the corner, results of many opinion polls suggest that increasing number of Americans are concerned with the accuracy of the midterm elections and the fate of the U.S. style democracy.
[3:34:37.800 --> 3:34:45.800]  In essence, this is because the U.S. style democracy deviates from its original intention and has become a political game.
[3:34:45.800 --> 3:34:48.800]  Perfectly said. You ready?
[3:34:48.800 --> 3:35:04.800]  According to a new poll by the Associated Press and ORC Center, the public affairs research, only about half Americans have high confidence that votes in the upcoming midterm elections will be counted accurately.
[3:35:04.800 --> 3:35:08.800]  Why, you conspiracy theorists, don't you trust these people?
[3:35:08.800 --> 3:35:11.800]  Hey, remember them hanging chads?
[3:35:11.800 --> 3:35:15.800]  Oh, that was back when Gore and Bush were running?
[3:35:15.800 --> 3:35:18.800]  Yeah, it was a 2000.
[3:35:18.800 --> 3:35:30.800]  Oh, oh, and the guy by the name of JFK won and they say the election was rigged because of James Daly, the very powerful mayor of Chicago that time.
[3:35:30.800 --> 3:35:35.800]  I was on doing a show on USA Watchdog that night.
[3:35:35.800 --> 3:35:38.800]  He asked me to be on election night.
[3:35:38.800 --> 3:35:41.800]  And you know me, I'm a political atheist.
[3:35:41.800 --> 3:35:44.800]  I look at things the way they are.
[3:35:44.800 --> 3:35:46.800]  And he did a great job.
[3:35:46.800 --> 3:35:53.800]  He had all these screens up of all the data coming in from Microsoft and Google and everywhere, all the data coming in.
[3:35:53.800 --> 3:36:01.800]  And the lines were like this, Trump and Biden under it going like that, the whole thing.
[3:36:01.800 --> 3:36:10.800]  All of a sudden, like 110,000 votes come in from Wisconsin and Michigan or somewhere and none of them for Trump.
[3:36:10.800 --> 3:36:11.800]  Wait a minute.
[3:36:11.800 --> 3:36:17.800]  Tell me 100,000 votes came in and none for Trump.
[3:36:17.800 --> 3:36:25.800]  And this happened in Wisconsin, Michigan, the number of places started happening.
[3:36:25.800 --> 3:36:31.800]  All these mail-in ballots came in, all these numbers came in, all of a sudden not one for Trump.
[3:36:31.800 --> 3:36:33.800]  And one of my six years old.
[3:36:33.800 --> 3:36:42.800]  All right, let's say, let's say Biden, let's really be ridiculous and say Biden got 100,000 and Trump only got 10,000.
[3:36:42.800 --> 3:36:44.800]  Not even that.
[3:36:44.800 --> 3:36:48.800]  So of course, you know, it's a crime syndicate.
[3:36:48.800 --> 3:36:50.800]  That's all it is.
[3:36:50.800 --> 3:36:51.800]  They steal our money.
[3:36:51.800 --> 3:36:53.800]  The names are giving it too big to fail.
[3:36:53.800 --> 3:36:56.800]  And they kill us in wars based on lines.
[3:36:56.800 --> 3:36:58.800]  But we have to Alex Jones.
[3:36:58.800 --> 3:37:03.800]  That's fine because he says what you don't want to hear.
[3:37:03.800 --> 3:37:05.800]  So shut them down.
[3:37:05.800 --> 3:37:07.800]  Going on to this article.
[3:37:07.800 --> 3:37:12.800]  You ready?
[3:37:12.800 --> 3:37:22.800]  9%, only 9% of U.S. adults think democracy is working extremely or very well.
[3:37:22.800 --> 3:37:25.800]  Just 9%.
[3:37:25.800 --> 3:37:30.800]  And over half the people say it's not working well at all.
[3:37:30.800 --> 3:37:34.800]  The other half is dead.
[3:37:34.800 --> 3:37:38.800]  That's what's happened to this country in front of our eyes.
[3:37:38.800 --> 3:37:42.800]  Now it's been stolen from us and you could thank the media for that.
[3:37:42.800 --> 3:37:46.800]  Little prostitute girls and boys.
[3:37:46.800 --> 3:37:51.800]  Media whores.
[3:37:51.800 --> 3:37:56.800]  All they are put out for their corporate pimps and a government whoremaster.
[3:37:56.800 --> 3:37:59.800]  We give you the truth and trend.
[3:37:59.800 --> 3:38:02.800]  We tell you what's going on.
[3:38:02.800 --> 3:38:03.800]  What it means.
[3:38:03.800 --> 3:38:04.800]  What's next.
[3:38:04.800 --> 3:38:06.800]  And what to do.
[3:38:06.800 --> 3:38:08.800]  But we don't tell you what to do.
[3:38:08.800 --> 3:38:10.800]  Tell you to think for yourself.
[3:38:10.800 --> 3:38:11.800]  Give you the story.
[3:38:11.800 --> 3:38:14.800]  This is how we see the analysis of it.
[3:38:14.800 --> 3:38:16.800]  Very plain to see.
[3:38:16.800 --> 3:38:20.800]  We don't distort the lie that they do with the other media.
[3:38:20.800 --> 3:38:22.800]  They distort lies.
[3:38:22.800 --> 3:38:27.800]  And they turn lies into truth.
[3:38:27.800 --> 3:38:31.800]  So it's very important to keep this going.
[3:38:31.800 --> 3:38:34.800]  And they're stealing democracy from us.
[3:38:34.800 --> 3:38:39.800]  This is a major article in the communist paper of China.
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:41.800]  Now go back to the economy.
[3:38:41.800 --> 3:38:46.800]  China was about to take over America as the largest economy in the world.
[3:38:46.800 --> 3:38:51.800]  We've had figured maybe within the next seven years that game is over.
[3:38:51.800 --> 3:38:54.800]  Now that the new dictator, the dictator won't leave.
[3:38:54.800 --> 3:38:56.800]  She is in charge.
[3:38:56.800 --> 3:38:59.800]  He has what he's done with these COVID lockdowns.
[3:38:59.800 --> 3:39:03.800]  Zero COVID policy has destroyed the Chinese economy.
[3:39:03.800 --> 3:39:07.800]  He's done a lot of damage to other economies, particularly in Europe.
[3:39:07.800 --> 3:39:12.800]  Because for the longest time, since China has been on the boom,
[3:39:12.800 --> 3:39:15.800]  the biggest tourist groups have been the Chinese.
[3:39:15.800 --> 3:39:18.800]  And they're going over there and they're buying everything they can.
[3:39:18.800 --> 3:39:22.800]  They're going to the top shops, buying, buying, buying, buying.
[3:39:22.800 --> 3:39:24.800]  No, you can't travel anymore.
[3:39:24.800 --> 3:39:26.800]  You've got to stay home.
[3:39:26.800 --> 3:39:36.800]  So we're going to see, you saw the Hong Kong index today went down 6%.
[3:39:36.800 --> 3:39:38.800]  6%.
[3:39:38.800 --> 3:39:45.800]  Hong Kong was like the Wall Street of the East at one time.
[3:39:45.800 --> 3:39:51.800]  And again, I used to be on Hong Kong TV when the protests were going on in 2019.
[3:39:51.800 --> 3:39:56.800]  This is a city of 7.5 million people and over a million people took to the street.
[3:39:56.800 --> 3:40:00.800]  In America, a country, what, 332 million?
[3:40:00.800 --> 3:40:06.800]  You can't get a million people to take to the streets to protest any.
[3:40:06.800 --> 3:40:08.800]  They're going to fight the Chinese way.
[3:40:08.800 --> 3:40:11.800]  And I'd be on these shows like 20 minutes.
[3:40:11.800 --> 3:40:12.800]  We take a break.
[3:40:12.800 --> 3:40:15.800]  I'd say to the guy doing the reporting, I said, so tell me what's going on.
[3:40:15.800 --> 3:40:17.800]  Mr. Slenty, we're not going to stop.
[3:40:17.800 --> 3:40:19.800]  We're not going to let the Chinese take over.
[3:40:19.800 --> 3:40:24.800]  They launched the COVID war in January 2020, the Chinese.
[3:40:24.800 --> 3:40:26.800]  Closed down the city of Yuan.
[3:40:26.800 --> 3:40:28.800]  Closed down Shanghai.
[3:40:28.800 --> 3:40:29.800]  This one, that one.
[3:40:29.800 --> 3:40:31.800]  Closed down Hong Kong.
[3:40:31.800 --> 3:40:33.800]  Beneath them.
[3:40:33.800 --> 3:40:37.800]  That's the security law.
[3:40:37.800 --> 3:40:40.800]  And that was the end of freedom in Hong Kong.
[3:40:40.800 --> 3:40:42.800]  And now the whole economy is going down.
[3:40:42.800 --> 3:40:45.800]  The economy is going down around the world.
[3:40:45.800 --> 3:40:50.800]  It's being artificially pumped up in the United States and in Europe,
[3:40:50.800 --> 3:40:54.800]  but it's still going down in Europe with the record low interest rate.
[3:40:54.800 --> 3:41:01.800]  So now we had written in the Trends Journal three weeks ago
[3:41:01.800 --> 3:41:07.800]  that the Fed's going to meet again on November 1st and 2nd.
[3:41:07.800 --> 3:41:10.800]  The second is a Wednesday.
[3:41:10.800 --> 3:41:12.800]  And then they're going to tell you what they're going to do,
[3:41:12.800 --> 3:41:17.800]  how much they're going to raise interest rate.
[3:41:17.800 --> 3:41:21.800]  The talk on the street is that they're going to raise them 75 basis points.
[3:41:21.800 --> 3:41:24.800]  You're seeing what's going on in the housing market,
[3:41:24.800 --> 3:41:28.800]  how it's going down in other sectors because of high interest rate.
[3:41:28.800 --> 3:41:30.800]  And then the debt load, if you're in business,
[3:41:30.800 --> 3:41:32.800]  you bought buildings, whatever you own,
[3:41:32.800 --> 3:41:34.800]  you're going to pay more on your debt.
[3:41:34.800 --> 3:41:37.800]  And the country, of course, with its $31 trillion in debt,
[3:41:37.800 --> 3:41:41.800]  has to pay a lot more debt as interest rates go higher.
[3:41:41.800 --> 3:41:43.800]  We said that they're not going to raise them that high.
[3:41:43.800 --> 3:41:45.800]  And you know why?
[3:41:45.800 --> 3:41:48.800]  The midterm elections.
[3:41:48.800 --> 3:41:50.800]  That's right.
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:53.800]  And you saw the power of the president.
[3:41:53.800 --> 3:41:59.800]  It was Trump that pushed Powell to lower interest rates in December 2018
[3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:03.800]  when the December stock market was having one of its worst.
[3:42:03.800 --> 3:42:06.800]  It was the Great Recession.
[3:42:06.800 --> 3:42:12.800]  And he talked Powell into lowering interest rates.
[3:42:12.800 --> 3:42:15.800]  New president, same game.
[3:42:15.800 --> 3:42:19.800]  You could see, if you start seeing the equity markets keep booming and booming
[3:42:19.800 --> 3:42:22.800]  as we're going into the midterm elections,
[3:42:22.800 --> 3:42:25.800]  the average person is going to think, oh, things are improving.
[3:42:25.800 --> 3:42:28.800]  The markets, wow, the markets are not going up.
[3:42:28.800 --> 3:42:30.800]  The markets are going up.
[3:42:30.800 --> 3:42:34.800]  So we're forecasting, we can't say directly,
[3:42:34.800 --> 3:42:37.800]  we believe that it's a good possibility
[3:42:37.800 --> 3:42:41.800]  that they may not raise interest rates 75 basis points.
[3:42:41.800 --> 3:42:46.800]  And now that's becoming the word on the street as well.
[3:42:46.800 --> 3:42:49.800]  The Fed is realizing that inflation is smaller,
[3:42:49.800 --> 3:42:52.800]  black hole of pain than previously thought,
[3:42:52.800 --> 3:42:56.800]  and stock rally 16% by year end.
[3:42:56.800 --> 3:43:02.800]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[3:43:02.800 --> 3:43:06.800]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore
[3:43:06.800 --> 3:43:11.800]  that the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[3:43:11.800 --> 3:43:15.800]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[3:43:15.800 --> 3:43:16.800]  It's came over.
[3:43:16.800 --> 3:43:21.800]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[3:43:21.800 --> 3:43:26.800]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[3:43:26.800 --> 3:43:29.800]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video,
[3:43:29.800 --> 3:43:32.800]  or infowars.com or newswars.com, it changes the world.
[3:43:32.800 --> 3:43:36.800]  And that's why when you go to infowars.com and get amazing products
[3:43:36.800 --> 3:43:40.800]  that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family,
[3:43:40.800 --> 3:43:44.800]  you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[3:43:44.800 --> 3:43:47.800]  The fight starts at infowars.com
[3:43:47.800 --> 3:43:50.800]  and the support of the fight starts at infowars.com.
[3:43:50.800 --> 3:44:00.800]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[3:44:20.800 --> 3:44:27.800]  The main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[3:44:27.800 --> 3:44:31.800]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[3:44:31.800 --> 3:44:34.800]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast
[3:44:34.800 --> 3:44:37.800]  have taken action and supported this show.
[3:44:37.800 --> 3:44:39.800]  I don't take the credit.
[3:44:39.800 --> 3:44:41.800]  I give you the credit.
[3:44:41.800 --> 3:44:44.800]  And now infowars is facing its darkest hours.
[3:44:44.800 --> 3:44:45.800]  It isn't going to give up.
[3:44:45.800 --> 3:44:47.800]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[3:44:47.800 --> 3:44:50.800]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today.
[3:44:50.800 --> 3:44:56.800]  Saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[3:44:56.800 --> 3:44:58.800]  It's our best seller.
[3:44:58.800 --> 3:45:02.800]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[3:45:02.800 --> 3:45:07.800]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[3:45:07.800 --> 3:45:11.800]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[3:45:11.800 --> 3:45:14.800]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[3:45:14.800 --> 3:45:17.800]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system,
[3:45:17.800 --> 3:45:20.800]  but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[3:45:20.800 --> 3:45:23.800]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids,
[3:45:23.800 --> 3:45:27.800]  all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[3:45:27.800 --> 3:45:30.800]  Essential means without these things, you die.
[3:45:30.800 --> 3:45:32.800]  And so much of the food is debased.
[3:45:32.800 --> 3:45:34.800]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[3:45:34.800 --> 3:45:38.800]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[3:45:38.800 --> 3:45:41.800]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there,
[3:45:41.800 --> 3:45:45.800]  but this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it funds the InfoWare.

[3:45:56.800 --> 3:45:59.800]  Fluoride is the enemy.
[3:45:59.800 --> 3:46:04.800]  It's the bad halogen to the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[3:46:04.800 --> 3:46:06.800]  What's the good halogen?
[3:46:06.800 --> 3:46:09.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.
[3:46:09.800 --> 3:46:12.800]  We have the highest quality iodine you're going to find anywhere,

[3:47:08.800 --> 3:47:18.800]  Hey, great being out here.
[3:47:18.800 --> 3:47:23.800]  You can see how bad things are going here and what a fraud the whole game is.
[3:47:23.800 --> 3:47:26.800]  That's all it is.
[3:47:26.800 --> 3:47:28.800]  That's why you need to support InfoWareStore.
[3:47:28.800 --> 3:47:35.800]  They're stealing our lives away from us, robbing us of freedom and democracy.
[3:47:35.800 --> 3:47:37.800]  InfoWareStore is doing what they can to preserve that.
[3:47:37.800 --> 3:47:40.800]  So you do what you can to preserve it as well.
[3:47:40.800 --> 3:47:44.800]  And you can do that by buying the great products that they have over there.
[3:47:44.800 --> 3:47:49.800]  As you well all know, one of my favorites is SuperMail Vitality.
[3:47:49.800 --> 3:47:53.800]  But they have their 1776 SuperSale.
[3:47:53.800 --> 3:47:55.800]  Spear to 76.
[3:47:55.800 --> 3:47:59.800]  Yep, I'll be 76 next month.
[3:47:59.800 --> 3:48:05.800]  Anyway, you could save up to 50% and you also get your double-patriot points.
[3:48:05.800 --> 3:48:12.800]  And again, most importantly as well, you're helping yourself but you're also helping fund the tip of the spear.
[3:48:12.800 --> 3:48:14.800]  And these are crucial times.
[3:48:14.800 --> 3:48:24.800]  And InfoWare needs your sponsorship and support to make it over the line during these historic times when they're trying to shut it down.
[3:48:24.800 --> 3:48:28.800]  But now more than ever, it's essential to keep InfoWareStore on the air.
[3:48:28.800 --> 3:48:38.800]  And again, as you see with that video on the Trends Journal and Gerald Salenti with me and the judge, Judge Napolitano,
[3:48:38.800 --> 3:48:48.800]  you have to defend the First Amendment because they've been in violation of the First Amendment by using Alex Jones of what he has done.
[3:48:48.800 --> 3:48:52.800]  There's nothing to do with the First Amendment.
[3:48:52.800 --> 3:48:54.800]  So they have these great products.
[3:48:54.800 --> 3:49:01.800]  You get the Survival Shield, you get the Survival Shield X3.

[3:50:06.800 --> 3:50:12.800]  And the next level, of course, is you want to bring it down to no level at all, only their level,
[3:50:12.800 --> 3:50:15.800]  the level of stupidity, the mainstream media.
[3:50:15.800 --> 3:50:18.800]  It's a joke. It's a joke.
[3:50:18.800 --> 3:50:22.800]  I quoted the woman who runs Fox.
[3:50:22.800 --> 3:50:30.800]  They had an article in the toilet paper record in The New York Times about how she made it very clear that you have to play to your audience.
[3:50:30.800 --> 3:50:36.800]  They called it the conservative audience, and you don't want to put information on there that may upset them.
[3:50:36.800 --> 3:50:40.800]  That's not journalism. That's a TV show. That's a sitcom.
[3:50:40.800 --> 3:50:43.800]  You're playing to an audience. You don't play to an audience.
[3:50:43.800 --> 3:50:50.800]  I could care less what you think, what you believe, what you wish, what you want, and what you hope for in the Trends Journal magazine.
[3:50:50.800 --> 3:50:56.800]  We put out the facts. We tell you where it's going, what it means, what to do, and what's next.
[3:50:56.800 --> 3:51:01.800]  But you like it or not. So that's not journalism.
[3:51:01.800 --> 3:51:08.800]  So there's very little journalism left, and again, InfoWare leaves you with an open mind.
[3:51:08.800 --> 3:51:19.800]  They're trying to close that open mind and put you into the insane asylum that the one flew over the cuckoo's nest is our government.
[3:51:19.800 --> 3:51:26.800]  Talking more about the economy, there's an article today in Wall Street on Parade, which is a great site.
[3:51:26.800 --> 3:51:30.800]  She puts some real good stuff on what goes on.
[3:51:30.800 --> 3:51:44.800]  And they report that the Fed head over there in St. Louis, James Bullard, gave a private invitation-only briefing on October 14th.
[3:51:44.800 --> 3:51:47.800]  You ready? The clients of Citigroup.
[3:51:47.800 --> 3:52:14.800]  And they go on to note that Citigroup got between 2007, you ready? 2010, got a cumulative sum of $2.5 trillion in secret loans from the government.
[3:52:14.800 --> 3:52:19.800]  Yep. Bush and Obama.
[3:52:19.800 --> 3:52:27.800]  Stealing our money to give it to the banks to gangsters.
[3:52:27.800 --> 3:52:33.800]  Disgusting. Democracy, it's a joke, it's dead.
[3:52:33.800 --> 3:52:38.800]  Oh, and they got that guy now that's going to be running as Prime Minister over there in the UK.
[3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:47.800]  Sunak, oh yeah, look him up. Where'd he come from? Oh, he was a Goldman Sachs gang member at one time.
[3:52:47.800 --> 3:52:53.800]  Oh, and then he started his own hedge funds. Hedge funds? You mean gambling syndicates?
[3:52:53.800 --> 3:52:58.800]  They're all on the inside game? They make all that dough?
[3:52:58.800 --> 3:53:04.800]  There was no such thing as hedge funds in private equity groups when I was a young guy.
[3:53:04.800 --> 3:53:10.800]  It was a whole different country. It was a middle class.
[3:53:10.800 --> 3:53:17.800]  Now it's all corporatized. Bigs have gotten everything.
[3:53:17.800 --> 3:53:21.800]  So the markets are up over 400 points.
[3:53:21.800 --> 3:53:25.800]  As I said, you're reading the headlines here.
[3:53:25.800 --> 3:53:29.800]  The Fed is realizing that inflation is smaller.
[3:53:29.800 --> 3:53:37.800]  People have pain than previously thought and they may not raise interest rates as much as they can.
[3:53:37.800 --> 3:53:45.800]  In a note on Monday, recent comments by federal officials which dialed back some of the hawkish
[3:53:45.800 --> 3:53:52.800]  missed that royal markets this year and the inflation remains high.
[3:53:52.800 --> 3:54:02.800]  The Fed's Loretta Meister, Meister, James Bullard, Neil Kesharkary, whoever's name is,
[3:54:02.800 --> 3:54:09.800]  shock man have made comments suggesting the Fed could pause on rate hikes in December.
[3:54:09.800 --> 3:54:15.800]  That led stock rally last week despite mixed corporate earnings. They got it.
[3:54:15.800 --> 3:54:21.800]  Corporate earnings are down and they're going to lower rates.
[3:54:21.800 --> 3:54:29.800]  I believe they're going to lower them. It's a good chance that they're going to lower them before the midterm elections.
[3:54:29.800 --> 3:54:35.800]  Again, they meet on November 1st and 2nd, 2nd to Wednesday.
[3:54:35.800 --> 3:54:39.800]  Now Wednesday, let's say they come up with only 50 basis points.
[3:54:39.800 --> 3:54:50.800]  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, five days of soaring stock market are going to be very positive
[3:54:50.800 --> 3:54:57.800]  in the midterm election. Remember, it's the economy, stupid.
[3:54:57.800 --> 3:55:03.800]  That was the phrase that murderous Bill Clinton used in 1992.
[3:55:03.800 --> 3:55:06.800]  That was the behind the scenes campaign slogan.
[3:55:06.800 --> 3:55:10.800]  Just keep focusing on the economy because it's a pocket book issue.
[3:55:10.800 --> 3:55:12.800]  Oh, and now the latest data came out.
[3:55:12.800 --> 3:55:17.800]  63% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[3:55:17.800 --> 3:55:21.800]  While the rich keep getting richer, the bigs keep getting bigger.
[3:55:21.800 --> 3:55:25.800]  Then you're seeing gold prices.
[3:55:25.800 --> 3:55:32.800]  To me, gold prices should be skyrocketing considering all the global instability.
[3:55:32.800 --> 3:55:39.800]  Remember now, when they raise interest rates, even if they raise them 75 basis points,
[3:55:39.800 --> 3:55:47.800]  does that bring them up to like overnight 3.25% when you have inflation running at 8.3%?
[3:55:47.800 --> 3:55:50.800]  That's nothing. You have negative interest rate.
[3:55:50.800 --> 3:55:57.800]  Over in Europe, you're looking at over 9% inflation.
[3:55:57.800 --> 3:56:05.800]  What do you have at your interest rate? 0.75%.
[3:56:05.800 --> 3:56:10.800]  Deep negative interest rate. Even with these low interest rates,
[3:56:10.800 --> 3:56:13.800]  look at how the economy is slowing down.
[3:56:13.800 --> 3:56:19.800]  Look at the data coming out about the worries about the people campaign off their card debt.
[3:56:19.800 --> 3:56:24.800]  One after another, look at the number of mortgage applications that well weigh down.
[3:56:24.800 --> 3:56:27.800]  Look at how home sales are going.
[3:56:27.800 --> 3:56:40.800]  As I keep saying, the biggest crash you're ever going to hear is when the commercial business offices go bust.
[3:56:40.800 --> 3:56:45.800]  Because the work at home trend is here to stay.
[3:56:45.800 --> 3:56:49.800]  People don't want to commute an hour and a half back and forth to work,
[3:56:49.800 --> 3:56:53.800]  especially with gas prices rising and everything else going up.
[3:56:53.800 --> 3:56:56.800]  During a COVID war, they love to stay home.
[3:56:56.800 --> 3:57:02.800]  You're going to see a crash, all the buildings that they bought, all the money that they owe.
[3:57:02.800 --> 3:57:04.800]  One after another.
[3:57:04.800 --> 3:57:08.800]  So it's going to go down really hard, really big, really fast.
[3:57:08.800 --> 3:57:11.800]  So prepare for the worst.
[3:57:11.800 --> 3:57:14.800]  If the worst doesn't happen and you're prepared, you lose nothing.
[3:57:14.800 --> 3:57:18.800]  If the worst happens and you're not prepared, you lose everything.
[3:57:18.800 --> 3:57:24.800]  So one of the ways to prepare, of course, is with the Trends Journal magazine, TrendsJournal.com.
[3:57:24.800 --> 3:57:28.800]  There's no magazine like it in the world.
[3:57:28.800 --> 3:57:30.800]  There's no Trends magazine.
[3:57:30.800 --> 3:57:34.800]  What they call Trends magazine is talking about fashion.
[3:57:34.800 --> 3:57:38.800]  And the other way you do it is by supporting info.
[3:57:38.800 --> 3:57:41.800]  Because they're putting out a lot of great information.
[3:57:41.800 --> 3:57:46.800]  They go there every day to see what they're doing and they have what you need.
[3:57:46.800 --> 3:57:49.800]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[3:57:49.800 --> 3:57:53.800]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[3:57:53.800 --> 3:57:55.800]  So I knew that.
[3:57:55.800 --> 3:57:57.800]  And for 28 years I've been on air, exposed to these people.
[3:57:57.800 --> 3:57:59.800]  And together we've had a great effect.
[3:57:59.800 --> 3:58:01.800]  But listen, they're coming after us right now.
[3:58:01.800 --> 3:58:06.800]  They're trying to shut us down, but they can't beat the power of we, the people, of you and I together.
