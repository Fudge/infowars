[00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.711]  Yeah.
[00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:46.788]  Alright folks, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday edition.
[00:00:46.788 --> 00:00:52.791]  Going out on hundreds of radio stations, hundreds of TV stations and at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:55.933]  Banned everywhere else except Twitter with live streaming.
[00:00:55.933 --> 00:01:03.277]  But they can't stop you, ladies and gentlemen, and your own free speech from taking my videos, taking our reports that are free to air.
[00:01:03.857 --> 00:01:07.239]  Editing them, re-releasing them, combining them with other information.
[00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:08.400]  It's your right to do it.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:18.205]  As President Trump said this week, we are still a free country and we have a First Amendment, but they're trying to steal the election for the globalists, for the establishment.
[00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:23.568]  We've got so much coming up today, but I first want to go to this John Fallon report that's so critical.
[00:01:23.568 --> 00:01:27.130]  First Amendment kidnapped by LSD-addled lunatics.
[00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.510]  Here it is.
[00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:31.914]  Silicon Valley calls it information operations.
[00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:42.278]  That's the name Facebook head of cybersecurity policy Nathaniel Gleicher dubbed limiting free speech during the cabal's recent secret meeting in San Francisco.
[00:01:42.278 --> 00:01:46.000]  The tech giants want us to think they're monitoring foreign actors.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.961]  Which they're trying to do.
[00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:52.024]  But what other information operations are they cracking down on in there?
[00:01:52.024 --> 00:02:03.131]  PJ Media reports, multiple posts sharing articles by prominent conservatives have been temporarily censored on Facebook under the excuse that they look like spam.
[00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:09.855]  Facebook censored the New York Post as Post contributor Selena Zico discovered, quote, so this is interesting.
[00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:14.179]  Facebook took down my post of my reporting for the New York Post.
[00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:20.224]  I've received nine separate messages from readers telling me the same thing has happened to them.
[00:02:20.224 --> 00:02:21.925]  What's up, Facebook?
[00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:23.406]  Zito asked in a tweet.
[00:02:23.406 --> 00:02:35.076]  And without missing a beat, the SPLC, which is facing at least 60 defamation lawsuits for targeting those that don't share their left-wing nutjob views on their notorious hate map,
[00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:39.579]  Continues its madness with the aid of Silicon Valley Culture.
[00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.663]  A culture that has been micro-dosing on LSD for years to enhance performance.
[00:02:46.056 --> 00:02:56.585]  There is a trend now, especially in Silicon Valley, interestingly enough, toward what is known as LSD micro-dosing.
[00:02:56.585 --> 00:03:07.915]  And that is the using of very, very small amounts of LSD for performance enhancement rather than to have a psychedelic experience.
[00:03:07.915 --> 00:03:11.979]  If a 100 microgram dose of LSD
[00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:22.003]  10 micrograms of LSD is a brightening and clarifying agent.
[00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:30.789]  It seems that around 10 micrograms or so, or 12 micrograms of LSD, is sufficient to generate what we know as a flow state.
[00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:42.992]  A sense of easily moving through the day, feeling that you have all your faculties with you, enhanced mental clarity, maybe greatly increased sensory acuity.
[00:03:42.992 --> 00:03:46.692]  But LSD doesn't continue to work in small doses.
[00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:51.173]  And since 2011, the trend is alive and well, as Forbes reports.
[00:03:51.173 --> 00:03:57.775]  It seems that the uber-smart 20-something set is looking for a healthy alternative to Adderall.
[00:03:58.035 --> 00:04:05.460]  With the motivation being partly driven by a search for the creative and innovative effects from LSD, explains Fadiman.
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:16.427]  Since he first described the concept of microdosing at a conference in 2011, the number of people experimenting with this technique using LSD has been increasing, he reports.
[00:04:16.707 --> 00:04:30.739]  But anyone that has experienced LSD knows overuse eventually leads to mood swings, unwanted hallucinations, distorted thinking, impulsiveness, impaired judgment, and borderline schizophrenia.
[00:04:30.739 --> 00:04:34.982]  Hey, don't take those, man.
[00:04:34.982 --> 00:04:35.423]  What?
[00:04:35.423 --> 00:04:37.304]  Wow, man!
[00:04:37.304 --> 00:04:39.066]  Hey, what was that s***, man?
[00:04:39.066 --> 00:04:43.710]  You just ate the most acid I've ever seen anybody eat in my life.
[00:04:44.506 --> 00:04:46.327]  Man, I never had an election before, man.
[00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:48.368]  Congratulations, Congress.
[00:04:48.368 --> 00:04:52.469]  This is who is currently in charge of our First Amendment.
[00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:55.010]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.731]  We knew it was coming.
[00:05:01.731 --> 00:05:03.171]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[00:05:03.171 --> 00:05:16.438]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[00:05:16.438 --> 00:05:27.483]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[00:05:27.483 --> 00:05:28.384]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:05:29.144 --> 00:05:29.584]  I think so.
[00:05:50.786 --> 00:05:53.511]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[00:05:53.511 --> 00:05:58.619]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[00:05:58.619 --> 00:05:59.901]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[00:06:14.554 --> 00:06:16.395]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now.
[00:06:16.395 --> 00:06:33.664]  There is no government official here, but I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[00:06:33.664 --> 00:06:37.185]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[00:06:37.185 --> 00:06:41.027]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[00:06:41.027 --> 00:06:42.568]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[00:07:03.476 --> 00:07:09.401]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake news.
[00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:15.346]  Maybe we should go out, all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant we're not the enemy of the people.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.261]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[00:07:28.261 --> 00:07:29.622]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[00:07:29.622 --> 00:07:35.946]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[00:07:35.946 --> 00:07:41.109]  This is CNN.
[00:07:41.109 --> 00:07:51.256]  Buy my Cortex Quick Pills and you will not die!
[00:07:51.256 --> 00:07:52.577]  Now available at McFerrin.
[00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:58.201]  Do not believe anyone who says these pills are just spray-painted Mike and Ike!
[00:07:58.201 --> 00:08:00.202]  Cortex Quake?!
[00:08:00.202 --> 00:08:05.445]  Thank God they didn't get the formula or didn't get the jump on us with Ultimate Female Force!
[00:08:05.445 --> 00:08:11.869]  My beautiful wife had three children one day after she even looked at a bottle of Female Force!
[00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:21.094]  But let me tell you, as Tuck Buckford knows, my cousin, and as I know as well, we came up with the ultimate known herbal formula for your little lady friend.
[00:08:21.394 --> 00:08:24.156]  Popeye turns into a badass when he eats spinach.
[00:08:24.156 --> 00:08:28.839]  My little lady turns into Godzilla when she takes it!
[00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:46.092]  So remember, you can get your ultimate female force today at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com and tell the mainstream media they can go straight to hell as you fund the First Amendment and unlock the incredible dynamo that is your little lady friend.
[00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.949]  I forgot to go down below!
[00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:39.453]  Bono has announced that during the upcoming U2 tour, he's going to wave a giant EU flag on stage.
[00:09:39.453 --> 00:09:45.637]  Well, U2 is kicking off its tour in Berlin this week and we've just had one of our more provocative ideas.
[00:09:45.637 --> 00:09:50.500]  During the show, we're going to wave a big, bright, blue EU flag.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.783]  According to Bono, waving a giant EU flag is transgressive.
[00:09:55.783 --> 00:09:57.244]  It's a radical act.
[00:10:03.973 --> 00:10:08.319]  Waving a flag that represents a giant unelected bureaucracy.
[00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:09.561]  So radical!
[00:10:09.561 --> 00:10:18.372]  Waving a flag that represents the interests of a Byzantine metropolitan elite who have repeatedly ignored the democratic will of European citizens.
[00:10:18.372 --> 00:10:18.933]  So tragic.
[00:10:18.933 --> 00:10:20.034]  Transgressive!
[00:10:20.034 --> 00:10:30.044]  Waving a flag that represents draconian self-serving neoliberal economic policies that have ruined the lives of working-class people in Greece, Italy and Spain.
[00:10:30.044 --> 00:10:31.205]  So radical!
[00:10:31.205 --> 00:10:39.974]  Waving a flag that represents a federal super state whose entire agenda is based around removing sovereignty and control from ordinary people.
[00:10:39.974 --> 00:10:40.975]  So transgressive!
[00:10:41.095 --> 00:10:42.255]  Exgressive!
[00:10:42.255 --> 00:10:50.899]  One of the richest celebrities on the planet, waving a flag that represents one of the most opaque, autocratic institutions on the planet.
[00:10:50.899 --> 00:10:52.179]  So radical!
[00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:56.661]  Mate, remember when Geldof stuck his middle finger up at those working class fishermen?
[00:10:56.661 --> 00:10:56.941]  Yeah.
[00:10:56.941 --> 00:11:00.042]  In comparison, you make him look like a man of the people.
[00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:04.104]  Bono says he's proud to recall when Germany welcomed frightened
[00:11:04.244 --> 00:11:05.205]  Then what happened?
[00:11:19.426 --> 00:11:20.306]  Yeah, hope you're proud, Bono.
[00:11:20.306 --> 00:11:20.806]  Really proud.
[00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:21.146]  Hey, Bono!
[00:11:44.972 --> 00:11:48.515]  If you're so proud, why didn't you take in any refugees?
[00:11:48.515 --> 00:11:54.540]  I mean, you're worth 700 million dollars, and you own three multi-million dollar properties.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:59.925]  But don't expect him to take in any refugees, since he doesn't even like having neighbours.
[00:11:59.925 --> 00:12:05.669]  Not content with living in a single mansion in 2005, Bono bought the one next door.
[00:12:05.669 --> 00:12:08.412]  Still no room for those frightened Syrian refugees though.
[00:12:08.412 --> 00:12:13.376]  Oh, but he temporarily changed the chorus of a U2 song to raise awareness.
[00:12:13.476 --> 00:12:14.717]  So I guess that's something.
[00:12:14.717 --> 00:12:15.837]  Right.
[00:12:15.837 --> 00:12:23.602]  Bono says only dirty right-wing nationalists think that diversity is a danger because Bono loves diversity.
[00:12:23.602 --> 00:12:26.063]  He loves diversity so much.
[00:12:26.063 --> 00:12:31.586]  He spends most of his time living in an affluent suburb of Dublin that's almost entirely white.
[00:12:31.586 --> 00:12:32.747]  So diverse.
[00:12:32.747 --> 00:12:36.409]  In a town which is full of mega-rich celebrities like himself.
[00:12:36.409 --> 00:12:37.289]  So diverse.
[00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:39.510]  What's the difference between God and Bono?
[00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:42.032]  God doesn't walk around Dublin believing he's Bono.
[00:12:44.585 --> 00:12:45.366]  That was a joke.
[00:12:45.366 --> 00:12:46.446]  That really saddens me.
[00:12:46.446 --> 00:12:50.489]  Bono says he's proud of Europe's fight to end climate change.
[00:12:50.489 --> 00:13:00.636]  A fight that Bono does his best to contribute towards by travelling around Europe in his luxury private Learjet and lazing around in his CO2 belching 140-foot yacht.
[00:13:00.636 --> 00:13:07.300]  U2's private jet Carbon Footprint for its 2009 tour was also big enough to fly the band to Mars and back.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:12.864]  Bono also paid for two long-distance taxi rides and a flight to pick up a hat that he'd forgotten.
[00:13:13.424 --> 00:13:14.425]  I'm proud of you, Bono.
[00:13:14.425 --> 00:13:18.006]  Bono says he's also proud of the fight to end global poverty.
[00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:26.511]  So proud that his charity called out giant corporations who use shell companies and offshore tax havens to siphon much-needed funds out of developing countries.
[00:13:26.511 --> 00:13:32.574]  But not proud enough for Bono himself to refrain from buying into a partnership of one of those very shell companies.
[00:13:32.574 --> 00:13:42.159]  Bono's so proud of the fight to end global poverty that his charity, which was set up to help fight global poverty, gives so much money to help fight global poverty.
[00:13:42.319 --> 00:13:43.180]  No, no, that's right.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.703]  It gives just 1% of its income to fight global poverty.
[00:13:46.703 --> 00:13:50.927]  According to Bono, Europeans living under the EU are happier than ever.
[00:13:50.927 --> 00:13:57.312]  So happy that according to a recent poll, Europeans living in France, Germany and Spain, the countries most closely embroiled with the EU,
[00:13:57.772 --> 00:14:01.395]  are overwhelmingly pessimistic about their children's future.
[00:14:01.395 --> 00:14:07.100]  In France, for example, just 9% thought that their children would be better off than them in the future.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.140]  So happy!
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:13.545]  Meanwhile, Bono says he's inspired by Pope Francis' solidarity with the most vulnerable.
[00:14:13.545 --> 00:14:21.811]  Unless, of course, you're talking about vulnerable children being sexually abused by Catholic priests, something Pope Francis has helped cover up for years.
[00:14:21.811 --> 00:14:22.912]  Here's an idea, Bono.
[00:14:22.912 --> 00:14:25.674]  If you really do care about protecting the vulnerable,
[00:14:25.714 --> 00:14:32.799]  Why not have a word with Popey about how he rewarded the Cardinal who raped little boys for decades?
[00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:35.861]  Doesn't sound very inspirational to me.
[00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:39.223]  So Bono, go ahead and wave your little EU flag.
[00:14:39.223 --> 00:14:42.425]  Perform your insufferable celebrity virtue signal.
[00:14:42.425 --> 00:14:51.992]  Because that very sanctimonious, out-of-touch, imperious, know-it-all attitude is precisely why we voted to leave the EU in the first place.
[00:14:55.476 --> 00:15:01.199]  That's Paul Joseph Watson with InfoWars.com.
[00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:04.280]  That full video is on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.261]  Okay, I'm going to kick off the main broadcast.
[00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:10.563]  I wanted to play some of those interesting reports first when we come back.
[00:15:10.563 --> 00:15:18.546]  And we're going to talk about why is InfoWars the most demonized, the most attacked, the most scorned broadcast in the world now.
[00:15:18.546 --> 00:15:21.748]  You know, a lot of folks say, oh, we're censored or, oh, we're under attack.
[00:15:21.748 --> 00:15:23.829]  But this is really going on.
[00:15:25.051 --> 00:15:27.132]  And so we're going to discuss, why is that?
[00:15:27.132 --> 00:15:31.173]  Because the answer to that is the answer to everything.
[00:15:31.173 --> 00:15:37.115]  And later I'll tell you, why do I have this Colt 9-11 handgun right here?
[00:15:37.115 --> 00:15:41.597]  Well, the same guy that made President Trump one, that's going to the National Archives, made me this.
[00:15:41.597 --> 00:15:44.158]  And it is one of the sweetest shooting.
[00:15:44.158 --> 00:15:48.559]  I mean, I was shooting bullseye at like 30 yards the first time I shot it.
[00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:51.240]  It's pretty amazing and it symbolizes Americana.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.161]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:52.541]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.398 --> 00:16:03.382]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[00:16:03.382 --> 00:16:06.125]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[00:16:06.125 --> 00:16:10.930]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.352]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[00:20:35.478 --> 00:20:42.784]  There's only 65 days left to what is the most important election in world history.
[00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:44.486]  We're live seven days a week.
[00:20:44.486 --> 00:20:49.950]  I'm here fighting because this is the most critical time in human development.
[00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:50.931]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:50.931 --> 00:20:53.133]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:20:53.133 --> 00:20:54.474]  All right.
[00:20:54.474 --> 00:21:00.939]  I have masses and tons of breaking, incredible video clips, news, your phone calls coming up.
[00:21:00.939 --> 00:21:03.702]  So much more here today on this live Sunday edition.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:11.044]  But the first thing I want to just state is, why is Infowars under such attack?
[00:21:11.044 --> 00:21:17.908]  Why is it demonized so much by corporate media, by the Republican establishment, by the Democrat establishment, by foreign governments?
[00:21:17.908 --> 00:21:20.970]  What is it we're covering?
[00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.372]  Well, it's that there's a breakaway civilization.
[00:21:23.372 --> 00:21:25.033]  That's not just a statement, it's true.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:32.224]  of the military industrial complex controlled by a technological elite.
[00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:38.549]  Those are quotes from President Eisenhower in his farewell address in 1961.
[00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:47.877]  And a technological elite of eugenicists, that was the big craze up until the end of World War II, they went underground into the U.S.
[00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:52.563]  DARPA development system.
[00:21:52.563 --> 00:21:54.244]  Most of them were pro-Hitler.
[00:21:54.244 --> 00:21:55.825]  The others were pro-communist.
[00:21:55.825 --> 00:22:02.088]  They all believed in command and control, centralization by elites because they're the elites.
[00:22:02.088 --> 00:22:13.975]  And they've now established much of a world government that's based on austerity and based on racial division and based on balkanization and based on divide and conquer.
[00:22:13.975 --> 00:22:18.257]  And so we are coming at it from a position of it's unelected,
[00:22:19.764 --> 00:22:22.407]  It's unaccountable.
[00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:25.210]  It's corrupt.
[00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.752]  It doesn't have your interest in mind.
[00:22:27.752 --> 00:22:29.974]  It's very, very evil.
[00:22:29.974 --> 00:22:34.439]  We should say no to this and people around the world are starting to say no to it.
[00:22:34.439 --> 00:22:41.546]  People around the world are starting to understand this and instead of just being tribal about a football team,
[00:22:42.867 --> 00:22:44.428]  Or a baseball team.
[00:22:44.428 --> 00:22:49.491]  Or even your church, which isn't about Christ, but about the community of the church and most of these things.
[00:22:49.491 --> 00:22:51.292]  They're just social clubs.
[00:22:51.292 --> 00:23:02.159]  What about the human ethos of Renaissance and controlling your own destiny and being free that God really tried to build and give you a chance at?
[00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:04.380]  What about that first understanding of free will?
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:16.144]  And globalism is about a worldwide social credit score, a mark of the beast, where if you don't behave and do what they say, you're basically blocked off from society.
[00:23:16.144 --> 00:23:17.825]  You can starve to death.
[00:23:17.825 --> 00:23:22.867]  You try to live out in the country like the Amish or something, here come the armored vehicles because they say you're a cult.
[00:23:22.867 --> 00:23:24.628]  This is manifesting.
[00:23:24.628 --> 00:23:26.109]  This is happening.
[00:23:26.109 --> 00:23:37.154]  This is the big issue that we face as a civilization and as a society right now.
[00:23:37.154 --> 00:23:37.354]  So,
[00:23:39.758 --> 00:23:44.042]  That's why they're trying to shut us down.
[00:23:44.042 --> 00:24:02.877]  Is because you can talk about left-wing or right-wing, you can debate fascism versus anti-fascism, you can debate all this window dressing and all the deck chairs and furniture and silverware and cutlery and plates and china and the food being delivered onto the deck of the Titanic right as it hits that iceberg.
[00:24:08.985 --> 00:24:11.026]  But you've hit the iceberg.
[00:24:11.026 --> 00:24:13.567]  And so the question is, what are you going to do about it?
[00:24:13.567 --> 00:24:31.833]  And I'm the one pointing out the ship's listing, and that Trump's trying to save the ship, he's got pumps going, they're trying to put fires out, and the average leftist is trying to sabotage that, saying that, you know, we've got to basically send the ship to the bottom, and that's how we fix things.
[00:24:31.833 --> 00:24:36.935]  And you've got Bill Maher, and you've got the other Democrats saying, let's have a depression, let's teach Americans to submit.
[00:24:38.115 --> 00:24:49.458]  You've got them so freaked out that we have a 4.6% growth rate and they're doing everything they can to sabotage the productivity of this country and of capitalism because they're the globalists.
[00:24:49.458 --> 00:24:50.778]  They already have a rigged economy.
[00:24:50.778 --> 00:24:51.778]  They already have private jets.
[00:24:51.778 --> 00:24:52.799]  They already have money.
[00:24:52.799 --> 00:25:05.222]  They want you to live in a two-party system where you're a communist on the ground having nothing like a poor Chinese serf, but then the political party are all a bunch of billionaires who are above the law and can have you executed like that.
[00:25:06.195 --> 00:25:07.916]  It's called authoritarianism.
[00:25:07.916 --> 00:25:08.896]  It's not fascism.
[00:25:08.896 --> 00:25:09.857]  It's not communism.
[00:25:09.857 --> 00:25:17.680]  It's authoritarianism carried out by an oligarchy, a plutocracy.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:22.923]  And if you don't know what those terms are, look them up and understand what we're facing.
[00:25:22.923 --> 00:25:25.984]  I keep seeing us still using Google as a search engine constantly.
[00:25:25.984 --> 00:25:27.145]  Google is worthless.
[00:25:27.145 --> 00:25:28.666]  It's a broken search engine.
[00:25:28.666 --> 00:25:29.746]  It doesn't work.
[00:25:29.746 --> 00:25:32.548]  Bing is Microsoft, but it's kind of the old Google search thing.
[00:25:32.548 --> 00:25:34.088]  DuckDuckGo is okay.
[00:25:34.088 --> 00:25:35.289]  Just want to point that out for the viewers.
[00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:40.791]  Now, who are the globalists?
[00:25:40.791 --> 00:25:41.711]  What is their aim?
[00:25:41.711 --> 00:25:43.012]  What do they want to do?
[00:25:43.012 --> 00:25:59.162]  And when you find out how monstrous they are, when you find out how bad they are, when you find out how out of control they are, then it becomes exponential understanding that you've got to stop them.
[00:25:59.162 --> 00:26:05.406]  That you've got to do something to block them because they are literally predatory and out to get you.
[00:26:06.613 --> 00:26:11.056]  The New York Times isn't a yellow journalism fake news outfit.
[00:26:11.056 --> 00:26:28.150]  It is a kingpin-owned, anti-American, robber-baron, weaponized, mafia, intimidation, weapons system run by stay-behind networks of Barack Hussein Obama and the foundations and the CIA publicly.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:38.291]  And it freaks them out at the Washington Post, the New York Times, and CNN, that are all part of the same group, that I know this.
[00:26:38.291 --> 00:26:41.836]  Because it's their religion that you're dumb scum.
[00:26:41.836 --> 00:26:46.502]  When they go to a barbecue in flower country, they look at you as dumb idiot bumpkins.
[00:26:48.137 --> 00:26:57.599]  And see, it rubs salt in their wounds that I have a Texas twang, and they've got this idea that Texans wipe their asses with corn cobs, and that, you know, we ride horses to work.
[00:26:57.599 --> 00:27:12.002]  And so the fact that I am alpha male, and I have a gravelly voice, and I am confident, and I am aggressive, and I know more about their criminal operations than they do, that completely and totally flips them out.
[00:27:12.002 --> 00:27:16.323]  Because if you're a pinhead genetic psychopath like Zuckerberg,
[00:27:17.458 --> 00:27:19.319]  Or Eric Smith or Barack Obama.
[00:27:19.319 --> 00:27:24.082]  Chosen because you come from lines of people that are absolutely evil.
[00:27:24.082 --> 00:27:30.907]  And because you operate with no emotion except for domination of the innocent.
[00:27:30.907 --> 00:27:32.327]  And to abort humanity.
[00:27:32.327 --> 00:27:34.329]  The spirit of pure Satanism.
[00:27:34.329 --> 00:27:35.569]  Abort humanity.
[00:27:35.569 --> 00:27:36.830]  Destroy humanity.
[00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.111]  Toast the evil.
[00:27:38.111 --> 00:27:38.892]  Dominate.
[00:27:38.892 --> 00:27:39.952]  Destroy creation.
[00:27:39.952 --> 00:27:41.833]  Become God.
[00:27:41.833 --> 00:27:44.975]  Because they come from blasphemous bloodlines.
[00:27:44.975 --> 00:27:45.476]  That's what it is.
[00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:50.853]  Committed to destruction of you and your family with laser hate focus!
[00:27:51.997 --> 00:28:16.389]  The fact that they see humanity struggling free from their spiritual bloodlust enrages them, and they see that I'm not afraid, except for failure, and that I'm moving against them, and that we're building a community of people that care, and use their own instincts and spirit not to worship football, or some facsimile, or some prosthesis, but the real thing, and as we pull away from their system,
[00:28:17.728 --> 00:28:21.369]  They become more and more and more panicked.
[00:28:21.369 --> 00:28:24.670]  And they don't know what to do.
[00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.571]  And they're scared.
[00:28:26.571 --> 00:28:28.772]  And so we're on the battlefield now with these people.
[00:28:28.772 --> 00:28:31.953]  But the reason we've been banned is we're talking about the real world.
[00:28:31.953 --> 00:28:32.913]  We're talking about the real system.
[00:28:32.913 --> 00:28:36.414]  We're talking about how it actually operates.
[00:28:36.414 --> 00:28:38.635]  And pointing out who they are.
[00:28:38.635 --> 00:28:39.875]  And that's why they want us destroyed.
[00:28:39.875 --> 00:28:40.996]  Because we have hope.
[00:28:40.996 --> 00:28:42.096]  And we believe in you.
[00:28:42.096 --> 00:28:43.117]  And you believe in us.
[00:28:43.117 --> 00:28:44.077]  And we formed a community.
[00:28:45.609 --> 00:28:50.878]  Now we come back, this whole McCain thing is a giant distraction and sickening, but from this evil we can learn something.
[00:28:50.878 --> 00:28:57.790]  So we'll play some of these key clips of the scripting and look at the message behind the Globalist Vampire's overall operation.
[00:29:03.374 --> 00:29:09.098]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:29:09.098 --> 00:29:16.983]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:29:16.983 --> 00:29:20.145]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:25.588]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[00:29:25.588 --> 00:29:28.370]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:37.355]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[00:29:37.515 --> 00:29:49.362]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pau Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[00:29:49.362 --> 00:29:54.185]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Mico ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:29:54.185 --> 00:29:55.846]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:00.518 --> 00:30:05.379]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:30:05.379 --> 00:30:14.281]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[00:30:14.281 --> 00:30:19.622]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[00:30:19.622 --> 00:30:27.884]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[00:30:28.004 --> 00:30:28.324]  I think so.
[00:31:00.383 --> 00:31:10.988]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:31:10.988 --> 00:31:15.910]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.111]  It's made in the USA.
[00:31:17.751 --> 00:31:18.692]  We're good to go.
[00:31:41.095 --> 00:31:52.829]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:31:52.829 --> 00:31:56.133]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:31:56.133 --> 00:31:59.717]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:00.057 --> 00:32:03.659]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:32:03.659 --> 00:32:05.439]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:32:05.439 --> 00:32:17.485]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:32:17.485 --> 00:32:22.787]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs, if
[00:32:23.267 --> 00:32:32.615]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:32:32.615 --> 00:32:40.462]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:32:40.462 --> 00:32:46.888]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[00:32:47.128 --> 00:32:49.009]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:13.192 --> 00:33:15.834]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:15.834 --> 00:33:25.760]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:35.686]  You know, there's only been a few people who've come out and told you from the inside what's going on.
[00:33:35.686 --> 00:33:40.649]  But if you actually look at the news, and all the things that are going on,
[00:33:42.122 --> 00:33:53.870]  What you're being told by Bill Joy of Sun Microsystems and people like Elon Musk is exactly what's going on.
[00:33:53.870 --> 00:34:06.218]  And so I've got literally dozens of amazing clips, I've got hundreds of amazing articles, I've got guests chomping at the bit to come on the show, I've got all these really interesting reports, but I just know at a fundamental level
[00:34:07.406 --> 00:34:09.047]  I want to explain this.
[00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:21.116]  Hollywood, the whole culture, everything that the media sells you is bad for you, to dumb you down, to control you, to get you out of the way, because the establishment wants to steal the future.
[00:34:21.116 --> 00:34:30.843]  And they want to bring in third world populations to drive down wages and blow up the engine of free market and savings because they don't want any competition.
[00:34:30.843 --> 00:34:34.366]  And they write books admitting all of this.
[00:34:34.366 --> 00:34:35.667]  So see, it's not my opinion.
[00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:44.615]  But they say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again with imagining different results.
[00:34:44.615 --> 00:34:47.037]  But here's the problem.
[00:34:47.037 --> 00:34:48.998]  I'm not insane.
[00:34:48.998 --> 00:34:55.263]  And we have rebooted, you and I together, this audience, who are really activists, who are the tip of the spear.
[00:34:55.263 --> 00:34:58.566]  Americana, free market, renaissance, understanding of globalism.
[00:34:58.566 --> 00:35:02.229]  We're winning all over the world.
[00:35:02.229 --> 00:35:04.110]  Globalism is in trouble all over the world.
[00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:04.551]  The fact that
[00:35:05.789 --> 00:35:12.253]  Big banks lecture everybody to open borders and raise taxes, but they live behind big walls and they're tax-exempt.
[00:35:12.253 --> 00:35:20.258]  And they have bodyguards, but they want our firearms.
[00:35:20.258 --> 00:35:23.520]  It's elitism.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.981]  It's hypocrisy.
[00:35:25.981 --> 00:35:28.383]  And people know that.
[00:35:28.383 --> 00:35:30.784]  People understand that.
[00:35:30.784 --> 00:35:32.345]  So I'm gonna explain it again real, real slow.
[00:35:34.306 --> 00:35:46.456]  Most people would kill to be the black sheep, bad boy, most banned news information in the world.
[00:35:46.456 --> 00:35:58.486]  Well, I would kill, not literally, but figuratively, to not be banned, and to when I have the number one Android app or the number one iPhone app, they leave it at the top instead of delisting it.
[00:35:58.486 --> 00:36:00.508]  We went to number one, they just delisted it.
[00:36:00.508 --> 00:36:01.429]  It's still number one.
[00:36:01.429 --> 00:36:02.550]  Millions of downloads apiece now.
[00:36:04.326 --> 00:36:11.570]  But they don't want to give any attention to the fact that you want freedom.
[00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:25.677]  They don't give any attention to the fact that you want free market, or that you want Americana, or that you want Apple and Google to not run slave factories, because Google's involved with some of their androids as well in China, and that you
[00:36:26.969 --> 00:36:28.891]  Want them to be moral companies.
[00:36:28.891 --> 00:36:33.215]  They don't want you to feel like your lobbying or what you do has any power.
[00:36:33.215 --> 00:36:37.699]  They want to demoralize you.
[00:36:37.699 --> 00:36:40.221]  And everything they do is about demoralizing you.
[00:36:40.221 --> 00:36:52.132]  They're setting up a corporate world government where everything you do is tracked in real time to game you and scam you and rip you off and consolidate markets in their own words.
[00:36:55.469 --> 00:37:14.146]  And then they use all this fake liberal talk about Black Lives Matter and transsexual this and that as just nebulous cover stories about how Tim Cook's good because he's gay, and so it's okay that Apple has the worst factories in China.
[00:37:14.146 --> 00:37:18.430]  Or, oh, the head of Google's an Indian person, so he can't be bad.
[00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:19.651]  He doesn't have to talk to Congress.
[00:37:21.161 --> 00:37:44.219]  And it's so cheap and it's so stupid but the largesse of having someone of a free country created so much wealth that the average person is just basically stunned and in la-la land and watching Netflix shows and the average man thinks acting upright and being part of the establishment is what gets him ahead.
[00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:52.976]  When the truth is, he's not even a player in the arena and might as well not even exist if you're not fighting globalism.
[00:37:52.976 --> 00:37:58.720]  Because it's the mark of the beast, it's the one world government, it's the end of the family.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:05.766]  Everything this system does is to target goodness and sustainability and independence.
[00:38:05.766 --> 00:38:07.607]  And it's here.
[00:38:07.607 --> 00:38:10.389]  And it's attacking you and your family.
[00:38:10.389 --> 00:38:12.351]  And it wants info wars off the air.
[00:38:14.307 --> 00:38:20.169]  As they call me, from NBC to CBS to CNN, a virus.
[00:38:20.169 --> 00:38:22.149]  And a disease.
[00:38:22.149 --> 00:38:28.431]  And an evil, horrible, dark-hearted person who they then lie about when anybody that's actually listened knows it's the opposite.
[00:38:28.431 --> 00:38:29.411]  And why is it?
[00:38:29.411 --> 00:38:33.172]  Because we studied the globalist paradigm.
[00:38:33.172 --> 00:38:34.472]  We know their operation.
[00:38:34.472 --> 00:38:35.973]  And it's not that hard.
[00:38:35.973 --> 00:38:40.874]  And if other people start looking into what we've said, as intelligence agencies have done,
[00:38:42.372 --> 00:38:50.455]  As militaries have done, as members of our own government and other governments have done, they go, my God, why did we never see this?
[00:38:50.455 --> 00:38:52.215]  Now it all makes sense.
[00:38:52.215 --> 00:39:08.181]  And once you see that tiny, technological, scientific, mad scientist elite, and you see how anti-human they are, your very humanity, your very bones, cries out against it on our great quest to the stars.
[00:39:10.305 --> 00:39:36.868]  From fire on to distant nebulas and other dimensions, and you realize the fundamental threat and the fear and the anxiety you've been feeling, but not knowing what it is, is being misdirected by the social engineers, but they're the threat, and they're the problem, and they're the enemy, and they're the ones that want to steal the future from you and your family.
[00:39:38.618 --> 00:39:47.761]  So your future, your birthright, your soul, your destiny is all being stolen from you right now.
[00:39:47.761 --> 00:39:49.041]  That's a fact.
[00:39:49.041 --> 00:39:50.142]  It's incontrovertible.
[00:39:50.142 --> 00:39:51.842]  It's prima facie.
[00:39:51.842 --> 00:39:54.103]  It's on its face.
[00:39:54.103 --> 00:39:55.783]  And that's why they want to shut down.
[00:39:55.783 --> 00:39:57.104]  That's why they're scared of us.
[00:39:57.104 --> 00:39:58.664]  That's why they want us off the air.
[00:39:58.664 --> 00:40:04.606]  That's why they want to make an example out of Infowars to say, anybody else stands up, we'll destroy you like Alex Jones.
[00:40:06.004 --> 00:40:09.747]  Because they think you're scared.
[00:40:09.747 --> 00:40:12.149]  They don't know you were asleep.
[00:40:12.149 --> 00:40:14.690]  And all of us were asleep to degrees.
[00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:26.879]  And so they keep thinking, because they're fear-based and they're cowards, that if they try to make you scared, that's going to make you submit.
[00:40:26.879 --> 00:40:33.084]  But once you realize that if you submit, it sells you and your family out, and that it literally destroys
[00:40:34.571 --> 00:40:42.681]  Your soul, because you sign on to spiritual enslavement, then you realize all that matters is resisting these people.
[00:40:42.681 --> 00:40:44.444]  All that matters is free will.
[00:40:44.444 --> 00:40:47.508]  All that matters is getting out of their control.
[00:40:47.508 --> 00:40:49.771]  And then it becomes a struggle.
[00:40:51.147 --> 00:41:01.771]  And once you're in the struggle, you don't think about the consequences anymore, because you've already counted the consequences, and your gut knows the truth, and you move against it with inexorable strength.
[00:41:01.771 --> 00:41:18.538]  And it's the strength of this audience of activists, in the arena, and the strength of our crew, and the strength of our guests, and the strength of our will, studying the globalist operation even more than they themselves study it, causing a debate within their compartmentalized systems,
[00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:25.235]  That fundamentally challenges their entire paradigm, and that's why they want us off the air.
[00:41:25.235 --> 00:41:40.126]  Because we look at the John McCain's, and we look at the establishment, and where they die, and what they have, and they're so empty, they're so pathetic, they're so wicked, they're so crazed, that you're like, my God, sell my soul to be that?
[00:41:40.126 --> 00:41:41.767]  And then you realize it's all a fraud.
[00:41:41.767 --> 00:41:47.612]  I said I'd play the clips of them at the McCain funeral, and just the inversion of reality, but I'll do that in the next segment.
[00:41:49.031 --> 00:41:53.455]  Very briefly, if you do not financially fund us and get great products at the same time, the enemy will win.
[00:41:53.455 --> 00:41:59.800]  But they're really angry that despite all their attacks the last few years, we are still moving forward.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.684]  They've slowed us down a little bit, but thanks to you, it looks like we may jump to the next level.
[00:42:04.264 --> 00:42:20.163]  We've got a Labor Day special, sales up to 50% off on our best-selling supplements, amazing t-shirts, books, films, but sign up for auto-ship on things like the Wake of America coffee that's really good, and things like BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and all the rest of it.
[00:42:20.163 --> 00:42:21.684]  By the way, BODY's is about to sell out.
[00:42:21.684 --> 00:42:22.345]  It's the strongest.
[00:42:23.396 --> 00:42:23.896]  We're good to go.
[00:42:45.851 --> 00:42:54.709]  Well, our products are just as good as our info, because everything I do, I try my best to give you the absolute, 100% truth.
[00:42:54.709 --> 00:42:57.875]  I do look through rose-colored glasses, though, so sometimes I'm not perfect.

[00:47:14.063 --> 00:47:18.631]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:18.631 --> 00:47:22.217]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:22.217 --> 00:47:24.882]  Okay, so our intrepid reporter Millie Weaver.
[00:47:25.982 --> 00:47:28.423]  Has been going to all these Trump rallies across the country.
[00:47:28.423 --> 00:47:33.064]  In Ohio, Indiana, Florida, you name it.
[00:47:33.064 --> 00:47:36.345]  Her and Gavin Winch, her husband, they make a great team.
[00:47:36.345 --> 00:47:46.487]  And their camper, they have a son too, driving around the country for Infowars, covering things on the road like the solar eclipses, lunar eclipses, you name it.
[00:47:46.487 --> 00:47:52.749]  But watch live, Black America Celebrates Trump Recovery and Make America Great Again Love.
[00:47:54.204 --> 00:48:00.850]  I did a live feed before the show today, and it's posted up on the site.
[00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:02.931]  There's also her report as well.
[00:48:02.931 --> 00:48:06.154]  It is powerful and very, very heartwarming.
[00:48:06.154 --> 00:48:15.562]  And you listen to these people who happen to have dark skin, and they're just so well-spoken and so nice and so good.
[00:48:15.562 --> 00:48:17.924]  And they say, hey, if you're black, come to a Trump rally.
[00:48:17.924 --> 00:48:19.045]  You never got so much love.
[00:48:19.827 --> 00:48:23.429]  And they talk about one guy's in a union, and he says, I've never had so much work.
[00:48:23.429 --> 00:48:26.711]  And everybody else is like, this is awesome.
[00:48:26.711 --> 00:48:30.013]  And then the media sits there and attacks him.
[00:48:30.013 --> 00:48:32.635]  And there's one of the famous guys, Blacks for Trump.
[00:48:32.635 --> 00:48:35.096]  I've got up on screen if you're a TV viewer.
[00:48:35.096 --> 00:48:41.040]  You can see his, you got his Hillary for prison, InfoWars.com, bumper sticker.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.021]  All orders, by the way, at InfoWars.com.
[00:48:43.021 --> 00:48:43.562]  Get some of those.
[00:48:45.285 --> 00:48:47.287]  But it's just a very, very powerful video.
[00:48:47.287 --> 00:48:53.414]  That's my overall breakdown of it on the site, but you can also find her video in 4s just by itself.
[00:48:53.414 --> 00:48:54.675]  She did a bunch of others.
[00:48:54.675 --> 00:48:55.336]  Just amazing.
[00:48:55.336 --> 00:49:06.628]  So I do intend next hour to play her little short report on Black Americans Celebrate Trump Recovery and Make America Great Again Love.
[00:49:07.455 --> 00:49:10.277]  Because that's what it's all about, is this is your country.
[00:49:10.277 --> 00:49:17.902]  Whether you're brown-skinned or white-skinned or pink-skinned or whatever it is, you've got more opportunities here than almost anywhere else in the world.
[00:49:17.902 --> 00:49:20.364]  And the globals are trying to pull that down and destroy it.
[00:49:20.364 --> 00:49:23.065]  Now, let's talk about the facts here.
[00:49:23.065 --> 00:49:34.553]  I've interviewed sailors who were on the forest stall when McCain did the wet start and fired the rocket and blew up a bunch of planes and his dad was the top admiral and they covered it up.
[00:49:35.742 --> 00:49:37.022]  Well, let's forget that.
[00:49:37.022 --> 00:49:42.945]  He was then in the Keating Five and stole 500 billion dollars and admitted, and he said, oh, it was terrible what I did, it'll be on my tombstone.
[00:49:42.945 --> 00:49:46.346]  But no, it's not, because they're covering up for your crimes.
[00:49:46.346 --> 00:49:57.170]  Then he was for open borders, gun control, helped the Democrats through the election to Obama, voted against getting rid of Obamacare, helped fund ISIS, helped cover up Benghazi.
[00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:59.070]  The guy's a monster.
[00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:03.772]  But the media and both political parties are trying to create this weird, sick unity
[00:50:04.537 --> 00:50:08.019]  For their corrupt system nobody likes and nobody wants.
[00:50:08.019 --> 00:50:15.504]  And you get McCain's Democrat Party daughter up there and everything else, it's just a sick joke.
[00:50:15.504 --> 00:50:18.326]  So we're going to go to that in a moment.
[00:50:18.326 --> 00:50:22.669]  But everything they say about Trump is, again, inversed.
[00:50:22.669 --> 00:50:28.572]  Meghan McCain says that Trump is full of all this fake rhetoric.
[00:50:28.572 --> 00:50:30.614]  Oh, what's he got, a magic wand?
[00:50:31.598 --> 00:50:34.019]  Like Obama said, you cannot get the 3% growth rate.
[00:50:34.019 --> 00:50:37.920]  It's down 4.6%.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:52.885]  In fact, they're reporting record stakes are being sold, record home purchases, record building, record... and now Trump's cut the growth, the deficit in half, which is a start.
[00:50:52.885 --> 00:50:57.467]  I mean, how do you sit there and watch what Trump's doing, like turning water into wine,
[00:50:58.933 --> 00:50:59.913]  And I'm not comparing him to Christ.
[00:50:59.913 --> 00:51:02.115]  I'm just saying it's metaphysical.
[00:51:02.115 --> 00:51:06.537]  And then get super angry and then cheerlead the downfall of the country.
[00:51:06.537 --> 00:51:08.157]  It's just crazy!
[00:51:08.157 --> 00:51:11.459]  People spitting in the face of their own recovery.
[00:51:11.459 --> 00:51:13.960]  But the first thing I want to play is a little clip of Chuck Todd.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:19.563]  NBC ran the hoax with Media Matters and everybody else that I said get your battle rifles ready.
[00:51:20.598 --> 00:51:22.620]  I won't even say it on air because they'll cut it out.
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.041]  They're so criminal.
[00:51:24.041 --> 00:51:24.882]  They're so evil.
[00:51:24.882 --> 00:51:32.028]  They're such frauds that they say that I said, get your battle rivals ready and use them on the press, which I never said.
[00:51:32.028 --> 00:51:35.271]  Well, they came out and said, oh, this unifies America.
[00:51:35.271 --> 00:51:43.518]  You know, it's either saying bye to an old legacy, which it really is, a little moment of truth by Chuck Todd, the Democratic operative, or it's a call to arms.
[00:51:43.518 --> 00:51:46.221]  Well, that doesn't mean, and we posted the article.
[00:51:47.586 --> 00:51:55.191]  On Infowars.com, from newsbusters saying Democrats call for more violence, which they do all the time.
[00:51:55.191 --> 00:51:56.873]  Hashtag hunt Republicans, all of it.
[00:51:56.873 --> 00:52:00.595]  But saying a call to arms is not a call to arms.
[00:52:00.595 --> 00:52:10.803]  Like when I say, we're in an information war, playing a game of chicken, it's high noon, and we're gonna march out there and not blink and take them down.
[00:52:10.803 --> 00:52:12.624]  That doesn't mean I mean literally.
[00:52:14.153 --> 00:52:15.775]  And Chuck Todd did not mean that.
[00:52:15.775 --> 00:52:18.858]  And I just want to say, I'm taking the high road even though NBC doesn't.
[00:52:18.858 --> 00:52:21.300]  So I can be like, did you hear?
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.863]  Chuck Todd called for violence.
[00:52:23.863 --> 00:52:27.967]  Chuck Todd called for calling to arms and weapons to kill Republicans.
[00:52:27.967 --> 00:52:28.608]  Did you hear?
[00:52:28.608 --> 00:52:30.290]  Will Chuck Todd be taken off?
[00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:31.651]  Major scandal!
[00:52:31.651 --> 00:52:32.492]  Did you hear?
[00:52:32.492 --> 00:52:34.955]  Chuck Todd said get guns and attack Republicans!
[00:52:35.796 --> 00:52:36.917]  That's what Lester Holt did.
[00:52:36.917 --> 00:52:38.539]  He goes, I'm getting chills right now.
[00:52:38.539 --> 00:52:41.582]  Jones called for getting guns and attacking us physically and killing us.
[00:52:41.582 --> 00:52:44.144]  You are a damn liar!
[00:52:44.144 --> 00:52:49.850]  I was talking about Antifa saying they're coming to kill members of ICE at their houses and members of Congress, like Scalise.
[00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:54.795]  And I said if I was a member of Congress or I was doxxed by Antifa, I'd have my battle rifle to protect myself.
[00:52:54.795 --> 00:52:57.798]  That's the opposite of saying go out and kill people.
[00:52:57.798 --> 00:52:58.739]  Holy mackerel!
[00:53:02.571 --> 00:53:04.393]  But again, that's the fraud they are.
[00:53:04.393 --> 00:53:08.737]  Everyone uses hyperbole like it's high noon or the Red River Shootout.
[00:53:08.737 --> 00:53:15.284]  Does that mean the Sooners in Oklahoma and the UT Texans are going to actually shoot each other at the Cotton Bowl?
[00:53:15.284 --> 00:53:17.827]  Call the Red River Shootout!
[00:53:17.827 --> 00:53:19.649]  Does it mean it's a physical one?
[00:53:19.649 --> 00:53:21.811]  And again, that's the fraud of these people.
[00:53:21.811 --> 00:53:24.494]  How would every major channel in the country say that I said
[00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:34.353]  Kill Mueller, which I never said, or I said get guns and go after the media, because they're getting ready to do it themselves.
[00:53:34.353 --> 00:53:35.974]  Just like the sun came up this morning.
[00:53:35.974 --> 00:53:37.575]  We're 65 days out.
[00:53:37.575 --> 00:53:39.095]  Be vigilant, have your cameras ready.
[00:53:39.095 --> 00:53:43.498]  When something happens, go to the scene, document it, because they don't want us questioning it.
[00:53:43.498 --> 00:53:47.240]  They want me out of the way and discredited ahead of their move on Trump.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.720]  I'm not that important.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.842]  The audience is important as eyes and ears, and that's why they want you silenced.
[00:53:53.823 --> 00:54:04.690]  So, in the interest of fairness, and then showing WeTek the high road, I could go, my good, by their yardstick, Chuck Todd just called for the murder of President Trump with firearms.
[00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:05.931]  A call to arms.
[00:54:05.931 --> 00:54:06.551]  No, it's not.
[00:54:06.551 --> 00:54:09.713]  It's a figure of speech.
[00:54:09.713 --> 00:54:18.399]  We have Democrats calling for me to be indicted in newspapers for saying I'm going to have a confrontation politically at high noon and I'm not going to blink with Mueller.
[00:54:20.066 --> 00:54:21.787]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:54:21.787 --> 00:54:26.311]  So, the last thing I want is that corrupt guy having something done to him.
[00:54:26.311 --> 00:54:28.353]  Does that make him a martyr?
[00:54:28.353 --> 00:54:29.453]  Let's go ahead and go to Chuck Todd.
[00:54:29.453 --> 00:54:30.935]  Here it is.
[00:54:30.935 --> 00:54:37.940]  As I had a few senators who I talked to during, before the event and after, who said, you know what, maybe it'll be a call to arms.
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:45.586]  Maybe the fact that you had, think about this, you had spontaneous applause, breakout, for Meghan McCain's eulogy.
[00:54:45.586 --> 00:54:48.088]  When was the last time you heard that?
[00:54:48.088 --> 00:54:48.989]  Applause at a eulogy.
[00:54:49.873 --> 00:54:55.017]  Remains to be seen if anything will change based on it, but certainly that energy was in the room yesterday in that cathedral.
[00:54:55.017 --> 00:54:59.481]  Okay, so a call to arms means getting together, really taking action.
[00:54:59.481 --> 00:55:02.103]  It does not mean shooting anybody, okay?
[00:55:02.103 --> 00:55:13.652]  But the media thinks you're so dumb, when I say the exact same stuff, and say politically, I'm gonna... You're like, we're dropping truth bombs.
[00:55:13.652 --> 00:55:17.415]  You know when you're over the target, you're getting the flack and we're dropping those 2,000 pound bombs.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:24.602]  Remember Glenn Beck when he was on CNN, kind of a fake conservative?
[00:55:24.602 --> 00:55:30.644]  But money bombs, and Ron Paul's raising like five million dollars a day sometimes.
[00:55:30.644 --> 00:55:39.127]  He'd go, they talk about Guy Fawkes day and bombs and blowing up and they have things called money bombs where they want to blow up things.
[00:55:39.127 --> 00:55:41.388]  That was before folks knew what a money bomb was.
[00:55:41.388 --> 00:55:43.009]  Trying to hope you thought that.
[00:55:43.009 --> 00:55:46.330]  That's the brain at CNN saying do that.
[00:55:47.967 --> 00:55:50.229]  No, they're the ones hyping violence.
[00:55:50.229 --> 00:55:53.733]  They're the ones gearing up all this.
[00:55:53.733 --> 00:56:04.564]  So, let's go ahead now and go to Meghan McCain, this Democrat, anti-gun, anti-American globalist, saying that there's cheap rhetoric out of Trump.
[00:56:04.564 --> 00:56:06.226]  No, Trump's been delivering.
[00:56:06.226 --> 00:56:07.667]  Here it is.
[00:56:07.667 --> 00:56:09.329]  He was a great man.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:15.103]  We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness.
[00:56:15.103 --> 00:56:29.013]  The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.
[00:56:29.013 --> 00:56:30.194]  What a hateful woman.
[00:56:30.194 --> 00:56:32.675]  He was a great fire who burned bright.
[00:56:32.675 --> 00:56:33.996]  Oh yeah, right.
[00:56:33.996 --> 00:56:34.577]  Globalist.
[00:56:34.577 --> 00:56:36.138]  Total, total globalist.
[00:56:36.138 --> 00:56:37.199]  So there you go.
[00:56:37.199 --> 00:56:37.359]  Now,
[00:56:40.222 --> 00:56:42.444]  Obama gets up there and talks a bunch of trash, that's coming up.
[00:56:42.444 --> 00:56:46.547]  But again, real rhetoric, rhetoric saying there's no magic wand.
[00:56:46.547 --> 00:56:49.350]  Trump actually did it, and it's coming back.
[00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:50.310]  Trump's delivering.
[00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:52.292]  Trump's the opposite of rhetoric.
[00:56:52.292 --> 00:56:53.213]  Trump's delivering.
[00:56:53.213 --> 00:56:56.115]  Here it is.
[00:56:56.115 --> 00:57:05.984]  But, for those folks who've lost their job right now because a plant went down to Mexico, that isn't going to make you feel better.
[00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:20.555]  And so what we have to do is to make sure that folks are trained for the jobs that are coming in now, because some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back.
[00:57:20.555 --> 00:57:31.399]  And when somebody says, like the person you just mentioned, who I'm not going to advertise for, that he's going to bring all these jobs back.
[00:57:31.399 --> 00:57:32.800]  Well, how exactly are you going to do that?
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:33.400]  What are you going to do?
[00:57:36.155 --> 00:57:37.756]  There's no answer to it.
[00:57:37.756 --> 00:57:41.819]  He just says, well, I'm gonna negotiate a better deal.
[00:57:41.819 --> 00:57:45.361]  Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[00:57:45.361 --> 00:57:46.702]  What magic wand do you have?
[00:57:47.847 --> 00:57:49.449]  He's not a traitor, Obama.
[00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:10.955]  Knockout packs a powerful punch to get you through the night and achieve proper sleep.

[00:59:44.565 --> 00:59:46.526]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:46.526 --> 00:59:48.427]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:09.611 --> 01:00:14.476]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:00:14.476 --> 01:00:15.997]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:24.418 --> 01:00:33.946]  Alright folks, Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, and the next guy they think Mueller wants to indict but he can't find anything, is going to be hosting the last two segments of the Showers.
[01:00:33.946 --> 01:00:44.055]  I want to give him the floor to cover a lot of big developments, but he's just as nauseated as I am by Meghan McCain and, you know, the whole, like, it's like Jesus Christ just got crucified.
[01:00:44.055 --> 01:00:47.538]  I mean, he was this horribly corrupt guy, but I wanted to mention to you, Roger,
[01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:57.989]  There's big articles out on Infowars.com from high-level sources that they even tried to script oligarchs to claim that they'd paid off Trump but couldn't do it.
[01:00:57.989 --> 01:01:06.660]  And there's also Democrat Senator CNN reports Russians penetrated Florida voter registration systems with no proof.
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.881]  He's way behind in the polls.
[01:01:08.502 --> 01:01:18.432]  So Democrat Senator Bill Nelson, who's up for re-election this year as a state Donald Trump won, said Russians have penetrated some of the state's voter registration systems.
[01:01:18.432 --> 01:01:23.237]  So any Americans wanting to get rid of the Democrats, we're all Russians now.
[01:01:23.237 --> 01:01:25.379]  This is ridiculous.
[01:01:25.379 --> 01:01:26.260]  It's preposterous.
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:31.125]  I guess the Russians just gave us a 4.6% growth rate.
[01:01:31.125 --> 01:01:32.086]  I guess the Russians just
[01:01:32.806 --> 01:01:35.570]  Cut off the Russian oil and gas sales and devastated them.
[01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:38.354]  I mean, I guess I mean this is Preposterous.
[01:01:38.354 --> 01:01:45.144]  I mean if the Russians are doing this my god, they're our best friends ever But obviously they're not so what's your take on that and what's coming up?
[01:01:46.735 --> 01:01:50.376]  Well, let's kind of take this one at a time.
[01:01:50.376 --> 01:01:50.996]  You're right.
[01:01:50.996 --> 01:02:03.238]  The McCain love fest, which is wall to wall on broadcast television, more opulent and more effusive than anything for Ronald Reagan or any other former president, never mind a senator.
[01:02:03.238 --> 01:02:10.759]  But the most telling piece of video was when Barack Obama said, John McCain and I always knew we were on the same side.
[01:02:10.759 --> 01:02:11.559]  There it is, folks.
[01:02:11.559 --> 01:02:13.640]  He said it on the same side.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.280]  Globalists.
[01:02:14.895 --> 01:02:24.438]  Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, One World Government, the two-party duopoly that has run this country into the ditch.
[01:02:24.438 --> 01:02:37.581]  And then, you played this clip, but I have to go back to it, where Meghan McCain says, we gather the mourn a passing American of greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who never came near the sacrifice he gave willingly.
[01:02:38.306 --> 01:02:45.591]  Nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered.
[01:02:45.591 --> 01:02:50.294]  Alex, John McCain was worth $200 million.
[01:02:50.294 --> 01:02:55.718]  When he ran for president, he was asked in a debate how many homes he owned, he couldn't remember.
[01:02:55.718 --> 01:02:59.201]  How did he make $200 million on the salary of a U.S.
[01:02:59.201 --> 01:02:59.541]  Senator?
[01:03:00.373 --> 01:03:18.198]  The systematic effort to erase all of his blemishes, the fact that he was personally responsible for the deaths of 134 of his fellow men in the Navy, on the deck of the Forrestal, is erased from history.
[01:03:18.198 --> 01:03:23.099]  If he were not the son of a- Or helping found ISIS, he was a monstrous creature.
[01:03:24.521 --> 01:03:30.826]  Look, and I have delayed this commentary until... No, no, I agree, but it's gotten disgusting now.
[01:03:30.826 --> 01:03:32.187]  I mean, God almighty.
[01:03:32.187 --> 01:03:38.392]  It's so over the top that I think people aren't seeing... It's basically Satan worship.
[01:03:38.392 --> 01:03:43.416]  We need to get that clip of Barack Obama saying he and McCain were on the same side and play it over and over again.
[01:03:43.416 --> 01:03:46.058]  Yeah, guys, pull that up, because I don't have his full comments.
[01:03:46.058 --> 01:03:48.020]  I did see that.
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.301]  Just search YouTube.
[01:03:49.301 --> 01:03:51.202]  Obama says me and McCain are on the same side.
[01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:52.083]  That is key.
[01:03:53.544 --> 01:04:05.707]  The other thing I would have to say is since I'm at the beach with the family and I've had CNN on, I'm still astounded at the extent to which they no longer even pretend to be a news network.
[01:04:05.707 --> 01:04:10.088]  They no longer pretend to have any semblance of balance in their panels.
[01:04:10.088 --> 01:04:16.629]  Their panels now consist of three liberals bashing Trump wall to wall, no objectivity, no credibility.
[01:04:16.629 --> 01:04:18.750]  They're virtually drooling in their hatred.
[01:04:19.751 --> 01:04:24.880]  It's really... Well, they're getting panicked by the 4.6% rate and everything that's happening.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.744]  Roger, you're going to be hosting two segments.
[01:04:26.744 --> 01:04:27.645]  You're loaded for bear.
[01:04:27.645 --> 01:04:29.388]  We're going to be talking to you straight ahead.
[01:04:29.388 --> 01:04:31.312]  Please stay with us, alright?
[01:04:31.312 --> 01:04:32.113]  Looking forward to it.
[01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:37.747]  All right, he's got better Skype at his hotel and wherever he's at than he does at home.
[01:04:37.747 --> 01:04:40.828]  So Roger Stone's like in the room with us just there, if you're a TV viewer.
[01:04:40.828 --> 01:04:43.509]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:04:43.509 --> 01:04:50.952]  Yeah, I just, I mean, I already hate mainstream media, but my God, you walk by any television, it is just worship, worship, worship, worship.
[01:04:50.952 --> 01:04:55.934]  That shriveled, demonic, horrible little corrupt piece of trash.
[01:04:58.305 --> 01:04:59.666]  We knew it was coming.
[01:04:59.666 --> 01:05:01.107]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[01:05:01.107 --> 01:05:13.978]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[01:05:14.358 --> 01:05:25.406]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[01:05:25.406 --> 01:05:34.272]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[01:05:34.952 --> 01:05:44.420]  It's also critical to go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:56.550]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com Forward Slash Show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[01:05:56.550 --> 01:05:57.831]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:06:04.508 --> 01:06:09.515]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:06:34.898 --> 01:06:38.320]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're live on this Sunday edition.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.320]  We have an hour left.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:43.743]  Roger Stone's coming up in the last two segments with huge breaking news.
[01:06:43.743 --> 01:06:53.848]  But Millie Weaver and Gavin Wentz, her husband, so Millie Wentz and Gavin Wentz, are out on the road doing an amazing job covering Trump rallies and other events.
[01:06:53.848 --> 01:07:00.832]  But man, she posted like five videos this weekend that are on Infowars.com that are powerful.
[01:07:02.313 --> 01:07:20.166]  And you see the beautiful, wonderful black Americans who are so articulate and so nice and so loving and so on top of it and bucking the intimidation, bucking the bullying and talking about how they love Trump.
[01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:29.553]  And man, one big victory the Democrats had was the Tea Party was started by Ron Paul supporters when he ran for election in like 2004.
[01:07:31.954 --> 01:07:33.755]  Because I remember I was there, part of it.
[01:07:33.755 --> 01:07:40.477]  We would, you know, throw the deficit and stuff, you know, into the water in Austin, in Boston, you name it.
[01:07:40.477 --> 01:07:44.018]  That was a thing against Republicans and Democrats.
[01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:46.099]  Then it scared Republicans, so they tried to co-opt it.
[01:07:46.099 --> 01:07:49.480]  But instead, the Liberty Movement took over the Republican Party instead, as I predicted.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.460]  And I was right about that.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:53.701]  I don't know why I keep being right, but I am.
[01:07:53.701 --> 01:07:56.042]  And so now we're an insurrection taking over the Republican Party.
[01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:12.946]  When you sit there and you pull back from this, it's just wild how the Democrats would say, the Tea Party's racist, if you're black or Hispanic or whatever, do not go to one.
[01:08:14.684 --> 01:08:39.780]  But then I sat there over the next few years and watched that fail and saw it go from 90% white to like 70% white till I've gone to tea party events in Texas and I've gone to the rally we set up at the RNC and man I looked out on that crowd and it was half black and hispanic and it was beautiful.
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:44.043]  And they were all just amazing people and that scared the hell out of me.
[01:08:44.952 --> 01:08:54.376]  Out of David Corn and the MSNBC that was there, they were just... I remember them like shaking their head, looking at the crowd and pointing, only aim your cameras up there.
[01:08:54.376 --> 01:08:56.177]  Do not show this.
[01:08:56.177 --> 01:09:04.461]  Because man, they went and they saw that rally and it was half Hispanic and black.
[01:09:04.461 --> 01:09:07.102]  Let's just say most of the crowd was brown.
[01:09:07.102 --> 01:09:09.423]  But their hearts were red-blooded, so I love them.
[01:09:12.066 --> 01:09:18.631]  And it just absolutely freaked the daylight out of them.
[01:09:18.631 --> 01:09:20.793]  They didn't know what to do.
[01:09:20.793 --> 01:09:21.594]  You know, the black community...
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.121]  Loves Trump before he ran for office.
[01:09:25.121 --> 01:09:29.842]  He was the most quoted, most lauded person in hip-hop, in rap, on BET.
[01:09:29.842 --> 01:09:32.982]  He was the favorite guy because everybody knew he opened the doors up to everybody.
[01:09:32.982 --> 01:09:35.403]  45 years ago, he took over golf courses that were white only.
[01:09:35.403 --> 01:09:36.483]  Hardly those even existed.
[01:09:36.483 --> 01:09:38.144]  I'm like, but I guess I'm only 45.
[01:09:38.144 --> 01:09:42.605]  So back when I was being born, Trump was taking over failed golf courses.
[01:09:42.605 --> 01:09:44.305]  There's a bunch of old dead white people were dying.
[01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:49.807]  They didn't want anybody but their own little club there like Caddyshack, Judge Smails.
[01:09:49.807 --> 01:09:50.147]  And so
[01:09:51.488 --> 01:10:03.058]  I mean, black people who lived in New York or wherever, they love Donald Trump, because they know he was like, throwing open the doors, and if you were a good manager or a good business person, he'd put you in charge.
[01:10:03.058 --> 01:10:05.360]  If you were gay, he'd put you in charge.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:10.324]  He got all these awards for all that, because he just cared about what you stood for.
[01:10:10.324 --> 01:10:12.806]  And everybody knows that, that actually knows Trump.
[01:10:12.806 --> 01:10:17.911]  And that's why the Democrats are so scared of him, because the claim that he's a racist is ridiculous.
[01:10:21.109 --> 01:10:26.154]  And so you see Millie Weaver go out there, and the media always goes, oh look, there's the Black for Trumps guy.
[01:10:26.154 --> 01:10:27.335]  Well, he loves Trump.
[01:10:27.335 --> 01:10:30.478]  And whenever Trump has a rally, he flies out there on his own dime.
[01:10:30.478 --> 01:10:31.559]  He's a Christian, he gets in that.
[01:10:31.559 --> 01:10:33.180]  But I go to the events.
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:36.043]  I go to them.
[01:10:36.043 --> 01:10:38.605]  And now it's 20% black.
[01:10:38.605 --> 01:10:40.808]  Well, blacks are only 13% of the population.
[01:10:40.808 --> 01:10:42.449]  But the numbers are about 20%.
[01:10:42.449 --> 01:10:45.492]  That scares the hell out of the Democrats.
[01:10:45.492 --> 01:10:46.333]  And guess what the polls show?
[01:10:47.839 --> 01:10:52.563]  Twenty-three percent of black Americans, it's like some title to say African-American.
[01:10:52.563 --> 01:10:55.585]  I'm not a German-American or a Welsh-American, I'm American.
[01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:57.647]  And you call me white, I'm part Native American, doesn't matter.
[01:10:57.647 --> 01:10:59.528]  A couple of those, black, black, white, doesn't matter.
[01:10:59.528 --> 01:11:02.490]  The names don't matter, we're humans.
[01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:06.994]  You got 23% of blacks in major polls supporting Trump.
[01:11:06.994 --> 01:11:09.956]  Same thing with Hispanics, it's a doubling number.
[01:11:09.956 --> 01:11:13.519]  Well, actually, Hispanics were 30%, they're up like 50% now, so that's even bigger.
[01:11:14.397 --> 01:11:16.220]  But people are getting the scam.
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:20.506]  Yeah, a lie goes halfway around the world before truth puts its pants on, to quote Mark Twain.
[01:11:20.506 --> 01:11:24.712]  But man, once you get the truth, it doesn't go back.
[01:11:24.712 --> 01:11:26.455]  So let's play this Millie Weaver report.
[01:11:26.455 --> 01:11:28.057]  There's a bunch of others on Infowars.com.
[01:11:28.057 --> 01:11:28.358]  Here it is.
[01:11:38.038 --> 01:11:41.420]  Silicon Valley calls it information operations.
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:44.201]  I'll tell you what make America great means to me.
[01:11:44.201 --> 01:11:59.446]  The fact that I can wake up every day of my life and if I choose to make the right decisions, I can be whatever I want to be in the greatest country in the world.
[01:11:59.446 --> 01:12:00.226]  The president's here.
[01:12:00.226 --> 01:12:02.807]  It'd be cool if I could do some tricks for him.
[01:12:04.722 --> 01:12:05.322]  I'll support.
[01:12:05.322 --> 01:12:06.183]  I mean, I'm still here.
[01:12:06.183 --> 01:12:07.423]  Everybody's having a good time.
[01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:09.764]  So it's just, it's a good vibes.
[01:12:09.764 --> 01:12:15.065]  I stand for all his policies, both religiously and politically.
[01:12:15.065 --> 01:12:18.086]  And I just think he's been doing a really great job.
[01:12:18.086 --> 01:12:23.948]  I just want to say like, just because I've never seen him and it's exciting.
[01:12:23.948 --> 01:12:25.889]  He's already done so much for the country.
[01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:28.950]  And he's really doing a great job.
[01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:33.393]  Have you guys been affected by any of the policies that he's enacted personally?
[01:12:33.393 --> 01:12:34.973]  I have.
[01:12:34.973 --> 01:12:38.335]  As far as abortion goes, that was one of my big issues.
[01:12:38.335 --> 01:12:40.756]  I very heavily stand for the unborn.
[01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:44.578]  And so his policies, as far as that goes, has really, really affected me.
[01:12:49.018 --> 01:12:53.161]  I just like him.
[01:12:53.161 --> 01:12:56.183]  I lived in New York back in the 70s when Trump was on his rise.
[01:12:56.183 --> 01:13:05.211]  And I always had that admiration for Trump and the things that he was doing in New York City back in the early and mid 70s.
[01:13:05.211 --> 01:13:08.874]  So when he became a candidate for president, I just still had a joy for him.
[01:13:08.874 --> 01:13:10.075]  I've got more friends in the unions now.
[01:13:15.379 --> 01:13:17.281]  Then I ever have before.
[01:13:17.281 --> 01:13:23.827]  They are hiring at a rate that they don't have enough minorities to fill.
[01:13:23.827 --> 01:13:24.908]  There's not enough of them.
[01:13:24.908 --> 01:13:27.470]  These guys aren't going out and applying for these jobs.
[01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:30.493]  They're everywhere and they're begging for minorities.
[01:13:30.493 --> 01:13:31.914]  Wages are going up.
[01:13:31.914 --> 01:13:33.956]  The economy is thriving.
[01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:36.378]  Jobs are being more jobs are being provided.
[01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:39.161]  I mean, the guy creates minority jobs just by showing up.
[01:13:39.821 --> 01:13:46.528]  Trump's still Trump, and now there's a motivator, a person that do things, a person that can get things done.
[01:13:46.528 --> 01:13:50.131]  And nothing you can do or say about it can change that so well.
[01:13:50.131 --> 01:13:52.574]  So why do you like him?
[01:13:52.574 --> 01:13:54.856]  Cuz he speak his mind.
[01:13:54.856 --> 01:13:57.178]  He don't play around with it.
[01:13:57.178 --> 01:14:00.802]  You know what I mean?
[01:14:00.802 --> 01:14:01.643]  He goes to the point.
[01:14:02.210 --> 01:14:05.952]  Do you think some of these other politicians are being fake a lot of times?
[01:14:05.952 --> 01:14:07.033]  Absolutely.
[01:14:07.033 --> 01:14:08.814]  He is a great man for our country.
[01:14:08.814 --> 01:14:09.855]  I do believe so.
[01:14:09.855 --> 01:14:10.956]  Yes, I do.
[01:14:10.956 --> 01:14:11.816]  I love Trump.
[01:14:11.816 --> 01:14:12.737]  Go Trump!
[01:14:12.737 --> 01:14:14.578]  The hate is clearly over there.
[01:14:14.578 --> 01:14:15.839]  He's trying to get that screamer.
[01:14:15.839 --> 01:14:19.261]  You can feel the vibes of hate coming from over there.
[01:14:19.261 --> 01:14:22.323]  If you look over here, the people aren't screaming at him.
[01:14:23.183 --> 01:14:38.230]  Why are they mad for us believing what we believe, and we're not mad at them for believing what they believe?
[01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:41.271]  I mean, I think it's all out here to get each other out of our skin, and I love it.
[01:14:41.271 --> 01:14:42.892]  It's out here for entertainment purposes for me.
[01:14:42.892 --> 01:14:46.273]  They say because I'm black, I should be over there, and I'm not black.
[01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:47.054]  I don't go by black.
[01:14:47.054 --> 01:14:47.874]  I go by two or more races.
[01:14:47.874 --> 01:14:51.336]  What were they saying to you?
[01:14:52.835 --> 01:14:55.038]  They said something about a white girl or something.
[01:14:55.038 --> 01:14:56.279]  I don't know.
[01:14:56.279 --> 01:14:57.140]  Yeah.
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:58.141]  I can't find the hate.
[01:14:58.141 --> 01:14:59.822]  I've been looking for hate all day.
[01:14:59.822 --> 01:15:01.684]  Hate was over here with the protesters.
[01:15:01.684 --> 01:15:05.087]  There's been no hate in the Trump crowd.
[01:15:05.087 --> 01:15:07.730]  I've got nothing but love all day.
[01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:13.476]  So I don't understand where the racism or the hate or whatever they say about Trump.
[01:15:13.476 --> 01:15:14.296]  Trump's not a racist.
[01:15:14.296 --> 01:15:15.417]  He's an American businessman.
[01:15:16.817 --> 01:15:18.598]  It's that simple.
[01:15:18.598 --> 01:15:24.781]  The divide was created in the Obama administration and that wave has just been rolled by the media and that's it.
[01:15:24.781 --> 01:15:30.344]  Trump creates nothing but greatness.
[01:15:30.344 --> 01:15:34.367]  Conspiracy theories were first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:15:34.367 --> 01:15:37.328]  Alright folks, we're gonna go to break and come right back.
[01:15:37.328 --> 01:15:38.369]  Roger Stone's coming up.
[01:15:38.369 --> 01:15:42.111]  I got some other clips I want to play but I want to also hit
[01:15:43.388 --> 01:15:53.707]  The globalists plan to bankrupt this country and how we stop them because we can see Trump's bringing oxygen back into the room, but imagine if they were in control, what's their plan to demoralize you?
[01:15:53.707 --> 01:15:55.470]  America was never great, will never be great.
[01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:56.391]  Remember what Cuomo said.
[01:15:57.554 --> 01:16:03.138]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in Fuller's life.
[01:16:03.138 --> 01:16:04.019]  It'd take hours.
[01:16:04.019 --> 01:16:06.461]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:07.642]  It's stronger.
[01:16:07.642 --> 01:16:09.243]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:16:09.243 --> 01:16:12.466]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:16:12.466 --> 01:16:13.587]  It's back in stock.
[01:16:13.587 --> 01:16:16.769]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:16:16.769 --> 01:16:20.592]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.

[01:16:24.396 --> 01:16:25.997]  And our latest product, it goes great.
[01:16:26.437 --> 01:16:33.739]  But the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[01:16:33.739 --> 01:16:34.599]  It's a spray you do.
[01:16:34.599 --> 01:16:35.920]  You can also swallow it.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:41.261]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high-quality silver, and a lot more.
[01:16:41.261 --> 01:16:42.641]  Without you, we couldn't do it.

[01:17:58.041 --> 01:18:01.645]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:18:01.645 --> 01:18:03.408]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:18:03.408 --> 01:18:14.701]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:18:15.462 --> 01:18:24.647]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:18:24.647 --> 01:18:30.590]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:35.712]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:38.314]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:18:38.314 --> 01:18:40.034]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:18:40.034 --> 01:18:44.837]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[01:18:45.077 --> 01:18:50.026]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:18:50.026 --> 01:18:52.670]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:57.398]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[01:20:01.367 --> 01:20:03.994]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:28.465 --> 01:20:30.126]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:20:30.126 --> 01:20:33.488]  You know, think about what the globalists would do if they had control of this country.
[01:20:33.488 --> 01:20:37.810]  The Democrat Attorney General, who looks like the star of American Psycho, I should add.
[01:20:37.810 --> 01:20:44.353]  I mean, he just looks like the archetypal devil meets a vampire that had babies.
[01:20:44.353 --> 01:20:46.794]  We'll put him up on screen for folks.
[01:20:46.794 --> 01:20:50.816]  He wants all illegals to have free health care and be able to vote.
[01:20:50.816 --> 01:20:52.958]  That's in the Associated Press.
[01:20:52.958 --> 01:20:55.219]  They say that all with a completely straight face.
[01:20:56.021 --> 01:21:09.711]  You've got seven plus billion people outside of this country, many of them living in total squalor, and you advertise everything's free, and you're racist if you don't give it out for free.
[01:21:09.711 --> 01:21:19.618]  So let's go back to the video clip since we're on that subject, and then I'll come back and give you the actual news articles on what's going on with that for you and your family.
[01:21:21.274 --> 01:21:29.516]  But just search engine, Democrat Attorney General of California give free health care to illegal aliens.
[01:21:29.516 --> 01:21:31.136]  That's what they're talking about.
[01:21:31.136 --> 01:21:32.376]  That's what they've always been pushing.
[01:21:32.376 --> 01:21:37.817]  But remember, Obama said McCain tributes echoes criticism of Trump.
[01:21:37.817 --> 01:21:42.938]  President George W. Bush comments at John McCain's funeral demonizing him.
[01:21:42.938 --> 01:21:46.119]  This is the fraud of these people.
[01:21:46.119 --> 01:21:47.219]  This is how they operate.
[01:21:47.219 --> 01:21:48.119]  This is what they believe.
[01:21:49.585 --> 01:21:52.606]  Can you go to Mexico and get free health care?
[01:21:52.606 --> 01:21:56.568]  Can you go to Russia or China?
[01:21:56.568 --> 01:21:56.988]  No!
[01:21:56.988 --> 01:21:59.189]  But only in Europe or the U.S.
[01:21:59.189 --> 01:22:05.671]  and they use the niceness of us to enslave us and they bring in these client groups to do it.
[01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:07.292]  California craziness.
[01:22:07.292 --> 01:22:15.035]  Congress may have to stop the state from giving free health care to illegal immigrants who they're bringing in to be their controlled clients.
[01:22:16.363 --> 01:22:20.348]  Democrat proposes government-funded health care for illegal aliens.
[01:22:20.348 --> 01:22:24.492]  That's the Attorney General Gavin Newsom.
[01:22:24.492 --> 01:22:25.253]  We have the video.
[01:22:25.253 --> 01:22:27.176]  68% of voters.
[01:22:27.176 --> 01:22:28.998]  Illegal immigration, major problem.
[01:22:28.998 --> 01:22:29.919]  Fed's not doing enough.
[01:22:31.917 --> 01:22:43.885]  It's a model where you're a world government corporate system, you bring in third world populations that will drive down wages, get rid of the middle class, and then keep them as a client group who will burn down cities if you don't submit.
[01:22:43.885 --> 01:22:48.749]  And so they're set to vote out globalism in Germany and Sweden?
[01:22:48.749 --> 01:22:52.572]  Thousands of car fires, thousands of rapes, thousands of stabbings.
[01:22:52.572 --> 01:22:55.494]  And if you talk about it on Facebook, you're banned.
[01:22:55.494 --> 01:22:59.476]  That is 21st century warfare.
[01:22:59.476 --> 01:23:01.378]  That is globalist control.
[01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:08.676]  And then, Canada has a 280% tariff on all dairy.
[01:23:08.676 --> 01:23:12.280]  Cheese, milk, yogurt, billions of dollars.
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:15.443]  Trump says, get rid of that.
[01:23:17.344 --> 01:23:21.066]  And they say, oh my God, you're such a horrible person, you hate Canada.
[01:23:21.066 --> 01:23:27.470]  See, there's this, like we were just here to be raped and pissed on and all this, and then we go, no, no, no, no, no, China.
[01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:29.151]  You have a $900 billion deficit.
[01:23:29.151 --> 01:23:30.432]  We want $200 billion.
[01:23:30.432 --> 01:23:31.533]  Cut off that.
[01:23:31.533 --> 01:23:32.494]  China goes, F you.
[01:23:32.494 --> 01:23:33.034]  We go, fine.
[01:23:33.034 --> 01:23:34.014]  $500 billion.
[01:23:35.155 --> 01:23:35.755]  F you.
[01:23:35.755 --> 01:23:36.035]  Fine.
[01:23:36.035 --> 01:23:36.936]  800 billion.
[01:23:36.936 --> 01:23:38.636]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:23:38.636 --> 01:23:39.136]  We need you.
[01:23:39.136 --> 01:23:39.617]  That's right.
[01:23:39.617 --> 01:23:41.317]  Because you're dirtbag commies.
[01:23:41.317 --> 01:23:43.298]  Your people don't even have running sewage.
[01:23:43.298 --> 01:23:44.438]  You enslave them.
[01:23:44.438 --> 01:23:48.039]  Because you're a bunch of soulless, anti-Christian scum at the top.
[01:23:48.039 --> 01:23:49.220]  A bunch of commies.
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:58.523]  And you're not going to lecture us through Google and Facebook and Apple that have moved over there and are down on their knees giving you you-know-what.
[01:23:59.966 --> 01:24:01.047]  We're done!
[01:24:01.047 --> 01:24:02.548]  We're the moral people.
[01:24:02.548 --> 01:24:04.249]  We believe in a human future.
[01:24:04.249 --> 01:24:06.010]  We're not trying to screw people over.
[01:24:06.010 --> 01:24:09.392]  The Democratic Party and the chi-coms and the globalists, they are.
[01:24:09.392 --> 01:24:12.795]  And they're the enemy.
[01:24:12.795 --> 01:24:16.137]  Unbelievable garbage from these scum.
[01:24:16.137 --> 01:24:18.439]  Now let me stop right there.
[01:24:18.439 --> 01:24:20.860]  I don't own slave factories in China.
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:24.222]  I didn't get a Pulitzer Prize for the New York Times.
[01:24:24.222 --> 01:24:24.363]  Why?
[01:24:25.478 --> 01:24:29.059]  Their reporters did for lying about WDs in Iraq to kill over a million people.
[01:24:29.059 --> 01:24:36.622]  Not against our troops going over there, they were ordered, but I'm against the lie to get us there to take out a non-radical and put in radicals for the Arab Spring coming and the invasion of Europe.
[01:24:36.622 --> 01:24:50.468]  They had to get rid of the old CIA plan of Egypt and Iraq with stable leaders that the CIA put in under Eisenhower plans that took decades to take place and put it in with radicals to implode into Europe for the larger UN plan.
[01:24:50.468 --> 01:24:51.148]  And all the rest of it.
[01:24:54.611 --> 01:24:56.373]  So again, these people are monsters.
[01:24:56.373 --> 01:24:57.975]  They're the enemies of your prosperity.
[01:24:57.975 --> 01:25:03.782]  They admit they are, and thank God for Trump and you, they've been forced out in the open.
[01:25:03.782 --> 01:25:05.525]  But I didn't lie about WMDs in Iraq.
[01:25:06.314 --> 01:25:08.955]  I'm not defending the Vatican and the giant pedophile rings.
[01:25:08.955 --> 01:25:13.896]  I'm not hurting the children like that with deadly vaccines, with autism from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 58.
[01:25:13.896 --> 01:25:26.060]  That's why they say I hurt children by questioning public events that happen, when they happen, till we verify they happen, because we were told babies, you know, thousands had their brains bashed out to invade Iraq.
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:26.720]  And it wasn't true.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:27.500]  It was an actress.
[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:28.481]  It was a PR firm.
[01:25:28.481 --> 01:25:28.941]  It was fake!
[01:25:31.678 --> 01:25:33.458]  So we have a right to question that.
[01:25:33.458 --> 01:25:34.679]  I've never killed any children.
[01:25:34.679 --> 01:25:35.879]  I've never killed your children.
[01:25:35.879 --> 01:25:37.599]  I've not done the things they say I've done.
[01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:42.761]  They have, the New York Times, by their known lies.
[01:25:42.761 --> 01:25:43.801]  But you see, they're after me.
[01:25:43.801 --> 01:25:46.422]  They want to shut us down because they know you're listening.
[01:25:46.422 --> 01:25:48.002]  And they know the military's listening.
[01:25:48.002 --> 01:25:49.162]  And they know the police are listening.
[01:25:49.162 --> 01:25:51.183]  And that's why it's so critical.
[01:25:51.183 --> 01:25:52.143]  And I want to thank the listeners.
[01:25:53.561 --> 01:25:55.062]  To understand that this is your fight.
[01:25:55.062 --> 01:25:58.465]  This isn't like some football game where you hope your team wins, but if they lose, it's okay.
[01:25:58.465 --> 01:26:07.051]  This is your Second Amendment, your private property, your right to raise your children as you see fit, and to be religious or not religious.
[01:26:07.051 --> 01:26:12.114]  This is your true Renaissance egalitarianism.
[01:26:12.114 --> 01:26:14.236]  Infowars is the spirit of liberty.
[01:26:14.236 --> 01:26:16.958]  The enemy hates it.
[01:26:16.958 --> 01:26:19.460]  And so it's your choice to support
[01:26:20.967 --> 01:26:44.046]  The right to say what we're saying and what we're doing so we have a voice, so the enemy can't shut us up, which is their real goal, and then say whatever they want about me once they can bankrupt me and put me in prison, which they have an Obama-CIA stay-behind network in Congress, funded, and you just like you thought Trump wouldn't go after internet censorship, and we pushed it and you pushed it and now he's doing it?
[01:26:44.719 --> 01:26:55.905]  The President is now talking about how Obama put $3 billion into a CIA leftist group, hiring the New York Times, the Washington Post, or Bezos.
[01:26:55.905 --> 01:27:09.273]  CNN and MSNBC, CBS and ABC, and NBC are all getting hundreds of millions a year to lie about Trump, to lie about Roger Stone, to lie about me, and it's all in the documents!
[01:27:11.212 --> 01:27:12.992]  See, the lawyers all know this.
[01:27:12.992 --> 01:27:16.753]  They're just scared to say it, because if you cover it, they go after you.
[01:27:16.753 --> 01:27:20.814]  But let's put those Zero Hedge articles back up on screen, please.
[01:27:20.814 --> 01:27:31.597]  Because if you want to know what will defeat the globalists, the so-called Countering Foreign Propaganda Act that Obama put in right before he left, that's the big criminal enchilada.
[01:27:33.064 --> 01:27:34.565]  That's the election meddling.
[01:27:34.565 --> 01:27:41.067]  But if the American people let them brand us all as Russian agents, like every Democrat's doing, it's losing.
[01:27:41.067 --> 01:27:42.928]  Because they know that we're awake to them.
[01:27:42.928 --> 01:27:45.789]  If we let them brand us as that, then it's our fault.
[01:27:45.789 --> 01:27:49.910]  But if we rise up politically to these bills, like H.R.
[01:27:49.910 --> 01:28:00.294]  6393 that passed, the Intelligence Authorization Act, fiscal year 2017, and the accompanying bill, it's over.
[01:28:00.294 --> 01:28:01.995]  And I've been on the phone with the Pentagon
[01:28:02.876 --> 01:28:04.759]  I've been on the phone with the Patriots.
[01:28:04.759 --> 01:28:19.097]  I've been in, cause you know, thank God the army in the fifties, when they were trying to make us lose, when the CIA was trying to make us lose to North Korea and the Chinese, the army got pissed then and created to stay behind networks in America.
[01:28:21.007 --> 01:28:23.970]  And see, I'm not one of those stay-behind networks.
[01:28:23.970 --> 01:28:26.592]  I just come from the same cloth as those people.
[01:28:26.592 --> 01:28:30.076]  And so I seamlessly merge right into it.
[01:28:30.076 --> 01:28:31.657]  And yes, I'll just tell you.
[01:28:31.657 --> 01:28:34.140]  We are a stay-behind network for America.
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:35.921]  It's the big secret.
[01:28:35.921 --> 01:28:36.642]  That's what we are.
[01:28:36.642 --> 01:28:37.843]  It's why they're after us.
[01:28:37.843 --> 01:28:38.184]  It's true.
[01:28:40.461 --> 01:28:42.824]  The Stay Behind Network support me.
[01:28:42.824 --> 01:28:44.827]  I'm from a Stay Behind Network.
[01:28:44.827 --> 01:28:47.390]  Most of my family was in Stay Behind Networks.
[01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:48.631]  That's why they hate me.
[01:28:48.631 --> 01:28:50.013]  I'm an American.
[01:28:50.013 --> 01:28:51.996]  I'm a Stay Behind Network for America.
[01:28:51.996 --> 01:28:54.278]  I'm fighting the Chinese globalist takeover.
[01:28:54.278 --> 01:28:55.220]  Roger Stone, straight ahead.

[01:33:00.859 --> 01:33:03.464]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.355 --> 01:33:21.996]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:21.996 --> 01:33:27.077]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:33:27.077 --> 01:33:35.319]  Alright, so why am I so hated by Soros, the Nazi collaborator, by CNN, by Obama, by Hillary, they call me the dark heart.
[01:33:35.319 --> 01:33:39.059]  I'm not in any intelligence agency, I'm not in any part of that group.
[01:33:39.059 --> 01:33:46.441]  The John Birch Society, which I was never a member of, my dad gave speeches for them and stuff in high school, just because he was an anti-communist.
[01:33:49.622 --> 01:33:56.543]  They knew that we turned China over to Mao in 49 and killed John Birch, who was an army officer, and tried to expose it.
[01:33:57.247 --> 01:33:58.808]  They tortured him to death.
[01:33:58.808 --> 01:34:18.499]  And so when you say stay behind network, there were plans under Operation Gladia, which I don't defend what NATO did under that, where as the Soviets would take over Eastern Europe or try to take over Italy, you would leave stay behind networks that looked like they were working in regular jobs and media, in case the Soviets took over, you would then resist behind enemy lines.
[01:34:18.499 --> 01:34:22.902]  So it's behind enemy lines, resistance fighters, carrying out
[01:34:24.127 --> 01:34:30.976]  Total Resistance Operations using HUMET and using covert action.
[01:34:30.976 --> 01:34:40.368]  And so, long before I read about covert action stuff, I heard about how the Air Force aided the CIA in basically stand-downs, not bashing the Air Force, they were new.
[01:34:41.673 --> 01:34:45.335]  In the turnover of North Korea to China.
[01:34:45.335 --> 01:34:48.716]  And that's when the Army really began to get suspicious.
[01:34:48.716 --> 01:34:50.317]  The Army's got its problems.
[01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:52.858]  The Navy's famously corrupt, you know, with politics.
[01:34:52.858 --> 01:34:57.681]  But the Army still, George Washington, the whole nine yards, it's still Americana.
[01:34:57.681 --> 01:35:00.322]  So the Army the entire time has been fighting with the CIA.
[01:35:00.322 --> 01:35:02.883]  That's been the ongoing program.
[01:35:02.883 --> 01:35:05.424]  And the CIA was created by bluebloods and globalists.
[01:35:05.424 --> 01:35:06.925]  And it isn't all bad either.
[01:35:06.925 --> 01:35:08.186]  It's a large consortium.
[01:35:09.565 --> 01:35:12.127]  When I say I'm a stay-behind network, you are.
[01:35:12.127 --> 01:35:15.749]  We believe in free market, we believe in the family, we believe in the Second Amendment.
[01:35:15.749 --> 01:35:31.540]  You are an agent of America, of George Washington, of liberty, literally in an information war with them trying to intimidate you, and Obama set up these bills, the Counter-Disinformation Act and the Intelligence Authorization Act, which billions of dollars
[01:35:32.679 --> 01:35:38.666]  To mainstream media to be the watchdogs with big tech and it says to shut down alternative media.
[01:35:38.666 --> 01:35:45.515]  Then they had hearings just saying that Breitbart and Infowars are Russians.
[01:35:45.515 --> 01:35:47.517]  With no proof.
[01:35:47.517 --> 01:35:48.839]  Obviously we're not Russians.
[01:35:48.839 --> 01:35:51.983]  We are the red-blooded Americans.
[01:35:53.271 --> 01:35:54.292]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:35:54.292 --> 01:35:57.095]  My family worked to bring down the Soviet Union.
[01:35:57.095 --> 01:35:57.476]  You name it.
[01:35:57.476 --> 01:35:58.517]  Worked in Latin America.
[01:35:58.517 --> 01:36:00.820]  All of it.
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:04.204]  Trump and Alex Jones and Roger Stone say what they want about us.
[01:36:04.204 --> 01:36:04.824]  We're not perfect.
[01:36:04.824 --> 01:36:08.609]  But let me tell you, we are red, white, and blue, baby.
[01:36:08.609 --> 01:36:09.229]  And they know that.
[01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.650]  We are USA.
[01:36:11.414 --> 01:36:14.218]  So Roger, you're going to host these two segments, you'll be back with me tomorrow.
[01:36:14.218 --> 01:36:26.235]  Big breaking news, but you were bringing up some really huge news to me during the break that before we get into the whole fake Russiagate thing and all the rest of the persecution that Kudlow, who I don't want to get into, I don't know how much we can say on air,
[01:36:26.736 --> 01:36:28.998]  I know you're friends with him and had dinner with him.
[01:36:28.998 --> 01:36:31.039]  Kudlow, you know, there's big work.
[01:36:31.039 --> 01:36:32.581]  I've had law firms send stuff to Trump.
[01:36:32.581 --> 01:36:33.782]  It's gotten to him.
[01:36:33.782 --> 01:36:36.303]  Trump's now moving, saying we're a free country.
[01:36:36.303 --> 01:36:38.705]  You can't censor the internet ahead of an election.
[01:36:38.705 --> 01:36:42.008]  That's a violation of campaign finance law.
[01:36:42.008 --> 01:36:45.450]  The head of Google will not even appear to Congress.
[01:36:45.450 --> 01:36:49.654]  We ought to really be celebrating that the listeners of this broadcast and you and I and this crew
[01:36:50.134 --> 01:36:51.276]  Who puts up with a lot.
[01:36:51.276 --> 01:36:52.157]  Our great crew.
[01:36:52.157 --> 01:36:53.058]  Praise God.
[01:36:53.058 --> 01:36:53.699]  Jesus Christ.
[01:36:53.699 --> 01:36:54.641]  I'm serious.
[01:36:54.641 --> 01:36:57.645]  We've already now got them in our sights if Trump takes action.
[01:36:57.645 --> 01:36:59.228]  So give us the latest on that, my friend.
[01:37:00.270 --> 01:37:20.077]  Yeah, you know, I must say, Alex, I think Larry Kudlow, who, as you know, was one of the architects of the great Ronald Reagan economic surge, then went on to see NBC with a very successful economic show, economic analysis and market analysis show, may be one of the president's single best appointments.
[01:37:20.077 --> 01:37:22.818]  He is the apostle of economic growth.
[01:37:22.818 --> 01:37:27.160]  He is the man who, not only working with Steve Moore, another great
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:40.687]  Pro-growth, pro-supply side economist at the Heritage Foundation helped candidate Donald Trump formulate the most dynamic economic growth program and tax program of any of the Republican candidates.
[01:37:40.687 --> 01:37:43.409]  But Kudlow is more than just a thinker.
[01:37:43.409 --> 01:37:52.734]  He is now at the right hand of the President helping administer that program, which has created 3.2 million new jobs.
[01:37:52.734 --> 01:37:55.636]  Hey, Barry, those jobs, they did come back.
[01:37:56.466 --> 01:38:03.835]  Uh, it is extraordinary now that Kudlow has immersed himself in the internet censorship issue.
[01:38:03.835 --> 01:38:14.448]  It was Larry Kudlow announced last week that the administration is going to be taking a hard look at the antitrust aspects of the anti, uh, those, the monopolistic practices.
[01:38:15.149 --> 01:38:19.073]  Larry Kudlow is a true American hero and he's doing a hell of a job for President Donald Trump.
[01:38:31.525 --> 01:38:32.066]  I agree.
[01:38:32.066 --> 01:38:34.308]  Antitrust may take too long, though.
[01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:35.909]  They're 65 days out.
[01:38:35.909 --> 01:38:36.990]  They're meddling with the election.
[01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:40.574]  They've lied to Congress, a lot of their deputy heads, in these hearings.
[01:38:40.574 --> 01:38:42.075]  They've now been caught lying.
[01:38:42.075 --> 01:38:44.738]  And you've also got the Federal Elections Commission meddling.
[01:38:44.738 --> 01:38:46.639]  Those are serious federal charges.
[01:38:46.639 --> 01:38:53.226]  Every time they ban a major congressperson or their campaign or their constituents, that is in-kind donations.
[01:38:53.746 --> 01:38:58.839]  We need a quadratic equation to create the number for that amount of money.
[01:38:58.839 --> 01:39:03.009]  It's in the billions and start federal indictments of the heads of the big tech companies.
[01:39:04.341 --> 01:39:05.941]  I could not agree more.
[01:39:05.941 --> 01:39:17.523]  The attempt to limit conservative and Republican candidates in their electioneering advertising on the internet has turned out to be an egregious error by the tech left.
[01:39:17.523 --> 01:39:20.464]  It's opened a whole new front for us to attack.
[01:39:20.464 --> 01:39:28.105]  Now, as you know, Alex, the courts have generally dismissed all of the First Amendment-oriented lawsuits against Twitter.
[01:39:28.105 --> 01:39:31.606]  But now it's going to be Federal Elections Commission and it's going to be Section 2 Antitrust Act.
[01:39:32.608 --> 01:39:36.290]  Yes, and I think that is where their greatest vulnerability lies.
[01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:43.195]  Look, the Congress, in the hands of Republicans, with a Republican president, and I'm never for regulation, but in this case it may have to be.
[01:39:43.195 --> 01:39:47.438]  Because the lack of regulation allows all their takeover to happen.
[01:39:47.438 --> 01:39:52.601]  We have that regulation saying, leave it alone, but look, we're not trying to toot our horn here, but listen to this.
[01:39:52.601 --> 01:39:56.964]  We are the ones, this audience, we push this over the top.
[01:39:56.964 --> 01:39:58.785]  I mean, this is a devastating victory.
[01:40:00.134 --> 01:40:00.995]  There's no question.
[01:40:00.995 --> 01:40:07.879]  Had they not targeted Alex Jones, had they not targeted InfoWars, the president would not be pushing back today.
[01:40:07.879 --> 01:40:11.381]  Their insidious little plan would have succeeded.
[01:40:11.381 --> 01:40:23.808]  But because they overreached in their attempts to strangle us right here at InfoWars, you have a president who totally gets it and who is intent on not... Let me ask you this question, because they'd already shadow ban millions like you, totally ban you on Twitter.
[01:40:23.808 --> 01:40:26.790]  Why was it InfoWars being banned that finally made the president move?
[01:40:28.593 --> 01:40:31.628]  You know, I think it's because, Alex, we didn't take the ban laying down.
[01:40:32.715 --> 01:40:35.776]  We didn't claim, you know, we didn't just go quietly.
[01:40:35.776 --> 01:40:41.758]  Because we raised holy hell across the media platforms that were available to us.
[01:40:41.758 --> 01:40:43.938]  And I don't need to tell you what happened.
[01:40:43.938 --> 01:40:47.480]  Record number of people going to the Infowars.com site.
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:50.781]  Record number of people listening to you on terrestrial radio.
[01:40:50.781 --> 01:40:53.341]  Record number of people signing up for the podcast.
[01:40:53.341 --> 01:40:54.862]  Record number of new stations.
[01:40:54.862 --> 01:40:55.402]  Hundreds.
[01:40:55.402 --> 01:40:56.442]  Taking down the app.
[01:40:59.683 --> 01:41:01.064]  So you know how this is.
[01:41:01.064 --> 01:41:05.206]  The American people always want what you tell them they cannot have.
[01:41:05.206 --> 01:41:08.328]  And therefore people who are ambivalent... So I ask this question again.
[01:41:08.328 --> 01:41:12.290]  Why the hell did they make such a brazen authoritarian move?
[01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:17.592]  And why would the head of Google refuse to go to Congress?
[01:41:17.592 --> 01:41:20.594]  Because you piss them off.
[01:41:21.221 --> 01:41:23.142]  Because you won't lay down.
[01:41:23.142 --> 01:41:24.542]  Because you won't quit.
[01:41:24.542 --> 01:41:31.284]  Because you, Alex, and all of our colleagues here, we just keep hammering them and exposing them.
[01:41:31.284 --> 01:41:35.165]  This is why they are so intent on silencing you.
[01:41:35.165 --> 01:41:36.745]  You're the tip of the spear.
[01:41:36.745 --> 01:41:38.986]  And we know the plan here was insidious.
[01:41:38.986 --> 01:41:41.907]  If we get Alex Jones, Sean Hannity's next.
[01:41:42.427 --> 01:41:50.673]  And then Tucker Carlson, and then Rush Limbaugh, and then Mike Savage, and then Mark Simone, and so many other great patriots.
[01:41:50.673 --> 01:41:52.414]  And their whole plan is now exposed.
[01:41:52.414 --> 01:41:54.115]  They're in retreat.
[01:41:54.115 --> 01:41:58.918]  The head of Google refuses to show up in Congress because he knows what's going to happen, and he does.
[01:41:58.918 --> 01:42:03.501]  Now you've got all these top Democrats saying, don't impeach Trump, stop censoring conservatives, stop.
[01:42:03.501 --> 01:42:07.304]  Panetta, all the smart guys, the wise men are saying back off.
[01:42:07.304 --> 01:42:11.767]  I don't want to be too positive, but I think we really, by not backing down, Roger,
[01:42:13.127 --> 01:42:16.648]  Because I was in War Council a month and a half ago with my family and I said, I'm going to do this.
[01:42:16.648 --> 01:42:18.088]  My family said, go ahead.
[01:42:18.088 --> 01:42:18.708]  We trust you.
[01:42:18.708 --> 01:42:23.829]  But we did this consciously, my friend.
[01:42:23.829 --> 01:42:25.349]  There's no question.
[01:42:25.349 --> 01:42:27.090]  Let me also, Alex, say something.
[01:42:27.090 --> 01:42:28.750]  I want to address something you said early on.
[01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:32.110]  Like you, I was never a member of the John Birch Society.
[01:42:32.110 --> 01:42:35.451]  But there are many, many good people in the John Birch Society.
[01:42:35.451 --> 01:42:38.351]  Anti-communists, real patriotic Americans.
[01:42:38.351 --> 01:42:41.432]  I always liked your father, Dr. Jones, and now I really know why.
[01:42:42.192 --> 01:42:47.256]  Uh, it is extraordinary, and right now, somewhere, David Brock's head is exploding.
[01:42:47.256 --> 01:42:50.999]  Oh my God, Roger Stone said something nice about the John Birch Society.
[01:42:50.999 --> 01:42:57.323]  Well, the John Birch Society, which is not the power it once was, has many, many good people in it, even today.
[01:42:57.323 --> 01:43:01.466]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.

[01:44:58.075 --> 01:45:01.658]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:45:01.658 --> 01:45:03.440]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:14.709]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:45:15.490 --> 01:45:24.618]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:30.644]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:45:30.644 --> 01:45:35.749]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:45:35.749 --> 01:45:37.971]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:40.052]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:45:40.052 --> 01:45:50.058]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:45:50.058 --> 01:45:52.700]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:58.103]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[01:47:01.903 --> 01:47:20.013]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.013 --> 01:47:26.277]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:27.341 --> 01:47:33.626]  Alright, Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, been involved in like six, seven presidential campaigns.
[01:47:33.626 --> 01:47:37.249]  He is in Delaware at the beach with his family, taking a few days off.
[01:47:37.249 --> 01:47:41.452]  I know two weeks ago he was meeting with Kudlow, he goes out in New York.
[01:47:41.452 --> 01:47:44.294]  He gets bobbed, attacked, by like a zombie apocalypse.
[01:47:44.294 --> 01:47:52.701]  Now, this morning he's at lunch, and I've induced him to tell the story, and some guy attacks him, so he knocks him out on the jaw.
[01:47:52.701 --> 01:47:54.542]  That's where we've gotten.
[01:47:54.542 --> 01:47:54.863]  Plus,
[01:47:55.902 --> 01:48:00.664]  The Democrats are moving with major impeachment operations against the president.
[01:48:00.664 --> 01:48:05.387]  So we'll probably tomorrow tell the whole, you know, villagers with torches in New York story.
[01:48:05.387 --> 01:48:11.010]  But right now, let's get into their move to impeach Trump, why they're insane.
[01:48:11.010 --> 01:48:13.331]  But first, let's get into what happened.
[01:48:13.331 --> 01:48:17.293]  We don't want to say where you are, but you're in Delaware having breakfast this morning.
[01:48:17.293 --> 01:48:23.676]  Yeah, I was with my family, Alex, and, you know, minding my own business, engaged in reading newspaper.
[01:48:24.585 --> 01:48:33.771]  Drinking a triple espresso, which is my custom, and some guy out of nowhere comes up to the table, starts screaming that I'm a Russian traitor that I'll dry in prison.
[01:48:33.771 --> 01:48:36.352]  I say to the guy, look, get lost.
[01:48:36.352 --> 01:48:38.814]  That's when he made the mistake of shoving me.
[01:48:38.814 --> 01:48:41.375]  Now, Alex, I hit the heavy bag every Sunday.
[01:48:41.375 --> 01:48:42.756]  I have for almost 20 years.
[01:48:42.756 --> 01:48:45.758]  Yes, I could knock you out with one punch.
[01:48:45.758 --> 01:48:50.441]  And I smacked this guy in the jaw, but he started the violence.
[01:48:50.441 --> 01:48:52.522]  You see, I'm not going to be pushed around.
[01:48:52.522 --> 01:48:53.543]  I'm not going to be bullied.
[01:48:54.143 --> 01:48:55.825]  I'm never going to start the violence.
[01:48:55.825 --> 01:48:57.006]  I don't believe in violence.
[01:48:57.006 --> 01:48:58.607]  I'm like Dr. King.
[01:48:58.607 --> 01:49:01.189]  But I will stand up for myself and my rights.
[01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:04.351]  You're not going to attack me with my family sitting there.
[01:49:04.351 --> 01:49:06.033]  That's not going to happen.
[01:49:06.033 --> 01:49:07.274]  This is where we've gotten to.
[01:49:07.274 --> 01:49:08.154]  Same thing happened to me last week.
[01:49:08.154 --> 01:49:08.835]  So tell us what happened.
[01:49:08.835 --> 01:49:14.860]  What happened once you, uh, because they'll probably ban this on Twitter saying, fighting back against some guy attacking you is wrong.
[01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:21.165]  So, again... He ran like the yellow coward that he was, the proprietor in this
[01:49:22.094 --> 01:49:27.478]  Diner called the police, but by the time they arrived, there was nothing to do.
[01:49:27.478 --> 01:49:28.759]  He was long gone.
[01:49:28.759 --> 01:49:32.501]  Look, I'm not trying to make myself sound like a superhero.
[01:49:32.501 --> 01:49:33.101]  No, no, no.
[01:49:33.101 --> 01:49:34.322]  We are hunted men.
[01:49:34.322 --> 01:49:36.384]  When I go on the street with you in Austin, it happens to me too.
[01:49:36.384 --> 01:49:37.965]  They go, F you, Russian.
[01:49:37.965 --> 01:49:40.086]  F your family.
[01:49:40.086 --> 01:49:41.827]  And I'm like, dude, I'm not a Russian.
[01:49:41.827 --> 01:49:43.969]  The economy's at 4.6.
[01:49:43.969 --> 01:49:46.951]  We're rebuilding the military.
[01:49:46.951 --> 01:49:49.032]  It's the left that hates America.
[01:49:49.032 --> 01:49:51.173]  It's Cuomo saying America was never great.
[01:49:51.173 --> 01:49:51.894]  It will never be great.
[01:49:52.879 --> 01:49:54.808]  Or that ice are a bunch of thugs.
[01:49:55.305 --> 01:49:58.787]  Not understanding it's the people they're arresting that are the thugs.
[01:49:58.787 --> 01:50:15.075]  No, this is extraordinary, but it's where we have gotten in the country, where you cannot even eat dinner in peace or roam the streets with your family, try to enjoy a vacation while you're attacked by some libtard.
[01:50:15.075 --> 01:50:19.017]  Let me be as clear as we possibly can.
[01:50:19.017 --> 01:50:22.499]  I wear the scorn of these liberals like a badge.
[01:50:22.499 --> 01:50:24.360]  The more they hate me, the more I love it.
[01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:25.221]  No, I agree.
[01:50:25.221 --> 01:50:28.543]  So what did he do when he attacked you and you fought back?
[01:50:28.543 --> 01:50:29.985]  He just ran.
[01:50:29.985 --> 01:50:31.346]  He pushed me.
[01:50:31.346 --> 01:50:32.147]  I spun around.
[01:50:32.147 --> 01:50:34.328]  I smacked him kind of square on the jaw.
[01:50:34.328 --> 01:50:35.529]  He was dazed.
[01:50:35.529 --> 01:50:38.452]  Then I think he realized he was overmatched and he ran like hell.
[01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:41.152]  It's after stumbling backwards.
[01:50:41.152 --> 01:50:44.656]  Look, I'm not telling this story to try to sound like a tough guy.
[01:50:44.656 --> 01:50:46.157]  Believe me, you've been with me.
[01:50:46.157 --> 01:50:50.942]  You've seen when they come over to the table and go, F you Russians, you're the worst people in America.
[01:50:50.942 --> 01:50:54.365]  And I'm like, I am America.
[01:50:54.365 --> 01:50:56.087]  The left hates America.
[01:50:56.087 --> 01:50:57.288]  They're globalists.
[01:50:57.288 --> 01:50:59.050]  They hate flyover country.
[01:50:59.050 --> 01:51:02.193]  But how do they believe this narrative that we're the enemy?
[01:51:02.193 --> 01:51:02.974]  It's crazy.
[01:51:03.885 --> 01:51:07.888]  Well, because you have CNN just recycling it over and over and over again.
[01:51:07.888 --> 01:51:10.090]  Look, I'm a proud Italian-American.
[01:51:10.090 --> 01:51:12.532]  You're not taking a swing at me and walking away.
[01:51:12.532 --> 01:51:13.653]  You're just not.
[01:51:13.653 --> 01:51:15.655]  I will stand up and defend myself.
[01:51:15.655 --> 01:51:18.377]  No, I will never start the violence.
[01:51:18.377 --> 01:51:21.860]  But I will not, I will not be attacked in the streets by thugs.
[01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:22.961]  Well, exactly.
[01:51:22.961 --> 01:51:25.423]  Let's expand to your Trump impeachment news.
[01:51:25.423 --> 01:51:27.425]  You were telling me some really important stuff.
[01:51:28.134 --> 01:51:31.716]  Yeah, I mean, you have some really extraordinary developments over the last couple days.
[01:51:31.716 --> 01:51:57.090]  First of all, the revelation that Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official under Barack Obama, was keeping Andrew Weissman, the Pitbull attack prosecutor for Robert Mueller, apprised of the progress in the compilation of the dirty dossier means that Weissman has violated the Department of Justice rules regarding the independence of the Special Counsel's Office.
[01:51:57.759 --> 01:51:59.680]  Donald Trump, are you awake?
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:01.361]  Are you hearing this?
[01:52:01.361 --> 01:52:03.243]  This is extraordinary news.
[01:52:03.243 --> 01:52:05.905]  They've committed all these process crimes.
[01:52:05.905 --> 01:52:09.647]  They're all a bunch of globalist agents, exactly.
[01:52:09.647 --> 01:52:10.808]  So you're mad at Trump.
[01:52:10.808 --> 01:52:13.950]  He's saying he's not going to fire Sessions, reportedly.
[01:52:13.950 --> 01:52:16.732]  We don't know if it's true until after the midterms.
[01:52:16.732 --> 01:52:19.314]  Even though the Senate has signaled for him to fire him.
[01:52:20.762 --> 01:52:27.229]  Well, and if you watch the CNN narrative, oh, Republicans fear if they move they'll lose the midterm elections.
[01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.930]  No.
[01:52:27.930 --> 01:52:30.252]  Make the midterms elections about your action.
[01:52:30.252 --> 01:52:33.255]  Go to the American people in an Oval Office address.
[01:52:33.255 --> 01:52:40.543]  He'd win, we would win 20 seats in the House if he SWAT teamed Google, if he SWAT teamed the DNC.
[01:52:40.543 --> 01:52:42.606]  I mean, people would be in ecstasy.
[01:52:43.783 --> 01:52:48.329]  But he has never, Alex, gone to the American people in an Oval Office address.
[01:52:48.329 --> 01:52:49.110]  Not once.
[01:52:49.110 --> 01:52:49.871]  No, I agree.
[01:52:49.871 --> 01:52:51.633]  He should go to an address about the traitors.
[01:52:51.633 --> 01:52:53.656]  You've seen the economy come back.
[01:52:53.656 --> 01:52:56.259]  In fact, advise the President right now as we go to break.
[01:52:57.248 --> 01:53:02.272]  What would you say in three, four, five minutes if you were President Trump addressing the American people?
[01:53:02.272 --> 01:53:03.033]  Oh my God.
[01:53:03.033 --> 01:53:03.833]  That's why they fear him.
[01:53:03.833 --> 01:53:05.194]  He hasn't used the power.
[01:53:05.194 --> 01:53:07.376]  He thought he'd bring the economy back and they'd back off.
[01:53:07.376 --> 01:53:09.137]  No, the elites don't want more money.
[01:53:09.137 --> 01:53:11.739]  They want America by the short hairs.
[01:53:11.739 --> 01:53:13.781]  Roger, what would you tell the President to do?
[01:53:13.781 --> 01:53:17.764]  I agree on that Oval Office address.
[01:53:17.764 --> 01:53:22.067]  Announce that you are taking a series of actions.
[01:53:22.067 --> 01:53:26.851]  Step one, declassify all the documents regarding the FISA warrants.
[01:53:27.199 --> 01:53:27.259]  Yes.
[01:53:47.662 --> 01:53:47.742]  Yeah.
[01:54:02.219 --> 01:54:07.484]  Uh, recused himself in the FISA warrant that was put on Carter Page.
[01:54:07.484 --> 01:54:10.106]  The President needs to lay out the facts here for the American people.
[01:54:10.106 --> 01:54:16.872]  And let's be clear, if he did an Oval Office request, an Oval Office speech, laying out the facts, we'd turn the economy back on.
[01:54:16.872 --> 01:54:18.993]  They're in bed with the Russians and the Chinese.
[01:54:18.993 --> 01:54:20.194]  I believe in you.
[01:54:20.194 --> 01:54:21.295]  They're trying to attack you.
[01:54:21.295 --> 01:54:26.560]  They've got CIA stay-behind networks trying to overthrow the government, trying to stop the recovery.
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:27.980]  I'm fighting for you.
[01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:34.183]  He needs to do the Oval Office address and just be honest and say, I'm taking these actions.
[01:54:34.183 --> 01:54:35.403]  I believe it's a referendum.
[01:54:35.403 --> 01:54:36.484]  I believe in you.
[01:54:36.484 --> 01:54:37.724]  You want to be great again.
[01:54:37.724 --> 01:54:38.885]  I'm doing it.
[01:54:38.885 --> 01:54:39.665]  It would be over.
[01:54:39.665 --> 01:54:40.985]  That's why they're so scared.
[01:54:40.985 --> 01:54:44.567]  Because if he ever exercises real power, it's over.
[01:54:44.567 --> 01:54:47.528]  Well, he also ought to hit Robert Mueller's greatest hits.
[01:54:48.246 --> 01:54:57.112]  An incredible front page story in the New York Times last Sunday by Matt Appuzzo would have you believe that this unblemished career is that of the Second Coming of Christ.
[01:54:57.112 --> 01:55:00.494]  The President knows Robert Mueller's real record.
[01:55:00.494 --> 01:55:02.616]  He knows the cover-up of 9-11.
[01:55:02.616 --> 01:55:05.138]  He's well aware of the cover-up of BCCI.
[01:55:05.138 --> 01:55:08.940]  He's well aware of the cover-up of what happened in Lockerbie Flight 103.
[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:12.182]  He knows the real story of the Anthrax investigation.
[01:55:12.182 --> 01:55:16.145]  He knows the real story regarding- Covering up for the Clintons?
[01:55:17.726 --> 01:55:21.671]  So the president needs to lay that out because the New York Times is not going to do it.
[01:55:21.671 --> 01:55:23.654]  The Washington Post is not going to do it.
[01:55:23.654 --> 01:55:25.556]  Mainstream media is not going to do it.
[01:55:25.556 --> 01:55:27.778]  Even Fox News is not going to do it.
[01:55:27.778 --> 01:55:33.285]  Only we here at InfoWars have the courage and the fortitude to lay these things out.
[01:55:33.285 --> 01:55:34.486]  But the president knows them.
[01:55:34.486 --> 01:55:35.367]  You know this, Alex.
[01:55:35.988 --> 01:55:38.870]  You've heard it from intimates of the President yourself.
[01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:44.493]  It's time for the American people to know the real Robert Mueller and what his real motives are.
[01:55:44.493 --> 01:55:51.516]  Interestingly enough, CNN has a headline up saying, criticizing the President for saying in a tweet that Mueller's investigation is illegal.
[01:55:51.516 --> 01:55:52.737]  They say that's not right.
[01:55:52.737 --> 01:55:57.240]  Well, it has not been declared illegal yet, but it will be.
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:01.382]  Because no one has brought the correct lawsuit yet, but they will.
[01:56:01.382 --> 01:56:03.223]  Well, Roger, let's point this out in closing.
[01:56:04.241 --> 01:56:05.342]  America's coming back.
[01:56:05.342 --> 01:56:06.483]  The globalists are the enemy.
[01:56:06.483 --> 01:56:07.663]  They admit they hate America.
[01:56:07.663 --> 01:56:10.025]  It was never great, never be great.
[01:56:10.025 --> 01:56:11.706]  Democrats, applause.
[01:56:11.706 --> 01:56:14.808]  Even if they get you and I and the Trump, they're never gonna win.
[01:56:14.808 --> 01:56:19.451]  Don't they look five, six moves ahead and realize they never get out of this?
[01:56:19.451 --> 01:56:20.432]  They're done.
[01:56:20.432 --> 01:56:25.696]  We've already won, but the question is how bad will it get before they realize that?
[01:56:25.696 --> 01:56:27.417]  These people don't know when to give up.
[01:56:28.592 --> 01:56:31.573]  That's because they're used to having their way for the last 30 years.
[01:56:31.573 --> 01:56:35.914]  That's because the Bush-Clinton combine has called to tune for the last 40 years.
[01:56:35.914 --> 01:56:37.755]  And what have we gotten from it?
[01:56:37.755 --> 01:56:39.095]  The decline of America.
[01:56:39.095 --> 01:56:41.556]  Endless foreign war with our national interest.
[01:56:41.556 --> 01:56:43.557]  But you look at the people worshipping McCain.
[01:56:43.557 --> 01:56:45.377]  It looks like a mummy convention.
[01:56:45.377 --> 01:56:45.897]  I agree.
[01:56:45.897 --> 01:56:47.438]  These people are the past.
[01:56:47.438 --> 01:56:48.038]  They're done.
[01:56:48.038 --> 01:56:48.798]  We're winning.
[01:56:48.798 --> 01:56:49.879]  Roger, come to town.
[01:56:49.879 --> 01:56:51.519]  Host with us for four or five days.

[01:57:04.857 --> 01:57:07.942]  I love quoting Colonel Travis.
[01:57:07.942 --> 01:57:08.803]  All right, now.
[01:57:10.862 --> 01:57:13.524]  I was at this church today and they had this special operations guy.
[01:57:13.524 --> 01:57:16.087]  He was a great guy going, I'm a fifth generation Texan.
[01:57:16.087 --> 01:57:20.390]  It just made me so proud to be an eighth or ninth and actually found the state.
[01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:21.711]  And it's not like a bragging thing.
[01:57:21.711 --> 01:57:25.915]  It's just like, well, I am Texas royalty, so that's just the way it is.
[01:57:25.915 --> 01:57:29.818]  And I'm proud that today we're having a big effect.
[01:57:29.818 --> 01:57:30.439]  And so are you.
[01:57:30.439 --> 01:57:32.480]  I don't care where you come from or what you do.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:32.961]  I love you.
[01:57:32.961 --> 01:57:35.883]  If you love liberty, black, white, old, young, I love you.
[01:57:35.883 --> 01:57:36.424]  All right.
[01:57:36.424 --> 01:57:37.364]  God bless you all.
[01:57:37.364 --> 01:57:38.746]  That's it for this live transmission.
