[00:30.000 --> 00:47.040]  All right folks, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday edition, going out
[00:47.040 --> 00:51.760]  on hundreds of radio stations, hundreds of TV stations, and at infowars.com forward slash
[00:51.760 --> 00:58.000]  show, banned everywhere else except Twitter with live streaming, but they can't stop you
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.520]  ladies and gentlemen, and your own free speech from taking my videos, taking our reports
[01:02.520 --> 01:07.280]  that are free to air, editing them, re-releasing them, combining with other information, it's
[01:07.280 --> 01:10.280]  your right to do it, as President Trump said this week.
[01:10.280 --> 01:13.900]  We are still a free country and we have a First Amendment, but they're trying to steal
[01:13.900 --> 01:18.280]  the election for the globalist, for the establishment.
[01:18.280 --> 01:22.280]  We've got so much coming up today, but I first want to go to this John Bowne report that's
[01:22.280 --> 01:29.040]  so critical, First Amendment kidnapped by LSD-addled lunatics, here it is.
[01:29.040 --> 01:34.640]  Silicon Valley calls it information operations, that's the name Facebook head of cybersecurity
[01:34.640 --> 01:40.640]  policy, Nathaniel Gleisher dubbed limiting free speech during the cabal's recent secret
[01:40.640 --> 01:42.320]  meeting in San Francisco.
[01:42.320 --> 01:48.080]  The tech giants want us to think they're monitoring foreign actors, which they're trying to do.
[01:48.080 --> 01:52.080]  But what other information operations are they cracking down on in there?
[01:52.080 --> 01:53.080]  P.J.
[01:53.080 --> 01:58.280]  Media reports, multiple posts sharing articles by prominent conservatives have been temporarily
[01:58.280 --> 02:03.560]  censored on Facebook under the excuse that they look like spam.
[02:03.560 --> 02:08.840]  Facebook censored The New York Post as post contributor Selena Zico discovered, quote,
[02:08.840 --> 02:14.000]  so this is interesting, Facebook took down my post of my reporting for The New York Post.
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.600]  I've received nine separate messages from readers telling me the same thing has happened
[02:19.600 --> 02:20.600]  to them.
[02:20.600 --> 02:26.760]  Facebook, Zito asked in a tweet, and without missing a beat, the SPLC, which is facing
[02:26.760 --> 02:32.120]  at least 60 defamation lawsuits for targeting those that don't share their left wing nut
[02:32.120 --> 02:38.600]  job views on their notorious hate map, continues its madness with the aid of Silicon Valley
[02:38.600 --> 02:46.160]  Culture, a culture that has been micro dosing on LSD for years to enhance performance.
[02:46.160 --> 02:52.760]  There is a trend now, especially in Silicon Valley, interestingly enough, toward what
[02:52.760 --> 02:56.680]  is known as LSD micro dosing.
[02:56.680 --> 03:04.720]  And that is the using of very, very small amounts of LSD for performance enhancement
[03:04.720 --> 03:07.960]  rather than to have a psychedelic experience.
[03:07.960 --> 03:17.560]  If a 100 microgram dose of LSD would be an official trip, if you will, 10 micrograms
[03:17.560 --> 03:22.520]  of LSD is a brightening and clarifying agent.
[03:22.520 --> 03:28.960]  Seems that around 10 micrograms or so or 12 micrograms of LSD is sufficient to generate
[03:28.960 --> 03:35.600]  what we know as a flow state, a sense of easily moving through the day, feeling that you have
[03:35.600 --> 03:43.080]  all your faculties with you, enhanced mental clarity, maybe greatly increased sensory acuity.
[03:43.080 --> 03:46.760]  But LSD doesn't continue to work in small doses.
[03:46.760 --> 03:52.480]  And since 2011, the trend is alive and well, as Forbes reports, it seems that the uber
[03:52.480 --> 03:58.120]  smart 20-something set is looking for a healthy alternative to Adderall.
[03:58.120 --> 04:02.880]  With the motivation being partly driven by a search for the creative and innovative effects
[04:02.880 --> 04:09.160]  from LSD explains Fatima, since he first described the concept of micro dosing at a conference
[04:09.160 --> 04:15.840]  in 2011, the number of people experimenting with his technique using LSD has been increasing,
[04:15.840 --> 04:16.840]  he reports.
[04:16.840 --> 04:23.880]  But anyone that has experienced LSD knows overuse eventually leads to mood swings, unwanted
[04:23.880 --> 04:30.560]  hallucinations, distorted thinking, impulsiveness, impaired judgment, and borderline schizophrenia.
[04:30.560 --> 04:33.560]  Hey, don't take those, man.
[04:33.560 --> 04:34.560]  What?
[04:34.560 --> 04:35.560]  Wow, man.
[04:35.560 --> 04:38.560]  Hey, what was that?
[04:38.560 --> 04:43.560]  You just ate the most acid I've ever seen anybody eat in my life.
[04:43.560 --> 04:46.560]  Hey, man, I've never had no acid before, man.
[04:46.560 --> 04:48.560]  Congratulations, Congress.
[04:48.560 --> 05:00.440]  This is who is currently in charge of our first amendment, John Bound reporting for Infowars.com.
[05:00.440 --> 05:01.440]  We knew it was coming.
[05:01.440 --> 05:03.440]  The whole thing was for me, Lake.
[05:03.440 --> 05:08.720]  First demonize Infowars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[05:08.720 --> 05:14.040]  to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[05:14.040 --> 05:16.560]  children and Islamophobia.
[05:16.560 --> 05:23.200]  And then, voila, two weeks later ban Infowars completely off of dozens of major platforms
[05:23.200 --> 05:27.000]  where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.520]  Go to infowars.com, forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link,
[05:33.520 --> 05:37.120]  whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[05:37.120 --> 05:41.280]  It's also critical to go to infowords.com, forward slash newsletter, and give us your
[05:41.280 --> 05:45.520]  email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our
[05:45.520 --> 05:46.520]  own platform.
[05:46.520 --> 05:51.560]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowords.com, forward slash show, how they can download
[05:51.560 --> 05:56.240]  the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information
[05:56.240 --> 06:14.520]  and point out, this is the verboten info, this is what they don't want you to see.
[06:14.520 --> 06:18.400]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now, there is no government official here, but
[06:18.400 --> 06:33.760]  I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[06:33.760 --> 06:37.200]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[06:37.200 --> 07:03.640]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[07:03.640 --> 07:08.960]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue, like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake
[07:08.960 --> 07:14.080]  news, maybe we should go out, all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant
[07:14.080 --> 07:27.000]  we're not the enemy of the people.
[07:27.000 --> 07:38.600]  We're not the enemy of the people, we're not the enemy of the people, we're not the
[07:38.600 --> 07:39.600]  enemy of the people.
[07:39.600 --> 07:40.600]  This is CNN.
[07:40.600 --> 07:51.600]  Buy my Cortex Quake pills and you will not die.
[07:51.600 --> 07:52.600]  Now available in Mixed Barrier.
[07:52.600 --> 07:53.600]  Cortex Quake.
[07:53.600 --> 07:58.360]  Do not believe anyone who says these pills are just spray painted Mike and Ike.
[07:58.360 --> 07:59.360]  Cortex Quake.
[07:59.360 --> 08:04.960]  Thank God they didn't get the formula or didn't get the jump on us with ultimate female force.
[08:04.960 --> 08:11.120]  My beautiful wife had three children one day after she even looked at a bottle of female
[08:11.120 --> 08:12.120]  force.
[08:12.120 --> 08:16.440]  But let me tell you, it's tough buck for nose, my cousin, and as I know as well, we came
[08:16.440 --> 08:21.280]  up with the ultimate known herbal formula for your little lady friend.
[08:21.280 --> 08:24.160]  Popeye turns into a badass when he eats spinach.
[08:24.160 --> 08:28.760]  My little lady turns into Godzilla when she takes it.
[08:28.760 --> 08:36.480]  So remember, you can get your ultimate female force today at infowarzlack.com or infowarzstore.com
[08:36.480 --> 08:41.760]  and tell the mainstream media, then go straight to hell as you fund the First Amendment and
[08:41.760 --> 08:46.280]  unlock the incredible dynamo that is your little lady friend.
[08:46.280 --> 08:53.280]  Whoa, I love it!
[09:16.280 --> 09:38.520]  Bono has announced that during the upcoming U2 tour he's going to wave a giant EU flag
[09:38.520 --> 09:39.520]  on stage.
[09:39.520 --> 09:43.640]  Well, U2 is kicking off its tour in Berlin this week and we've just had one of our more
[09:43.640 --> 09:46.480]  provocative ideas during the show.
[09:46.480 --> 09:50.960]  We're going to wave a big bright blue EU flag.
[09:50.960 --> 09:55.880]  According to Bono, waving a giant EU flag is transgressive.
[09:55.880 --> 10:04.400]  It's a radical act.
[10:04.400 --> 10:08.400]  Waving a flag that represents a giant unelected bureaucracy.
[10:08.400 --> 10:13.680]  So radical, waving a flag that represents the interests of a Byzantine metropolitan
[10:13.680 --> 10:18.440]  elite who have repeatedly ignored the democratic will of European citizens.
[10:18.440 --> 10:24.400]  So transgressive, waving a flag that represents draconian self-serving neoliberal economic
[10:24.400 --> 10:30.120]  policies that have ruined the lives of working-class people in Greece, Italy and Spain.
[10:30.120 --> 10:35.440]  So radical, waving a flag that represents a federal super-state whose entire agenda
[10:35.440 --> 10:40.000]  is based around removing sovereignty and control from ordinary people.
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.320]  So transgressive!
[10:42.320 --> 10:46.880]  One of the richest celebrities on the planet, waving a flag that represents one of the
[10:46.880 --> 10:50.960]  most opaque, autocratic institutions on the planet.
[10:50.960 --> 10:51.960]  So radical!
[10:51.960 --> 10:56.640]  Mate, remember when Geldof stuck his middle finger up at those working-class fishermen?
[10:56.640 --> 10:57.640]  Yeah.
[10:57.640 --> 11:00.120]  In comparison, you make him look like a man of the people.
[11:00.120 --> 11:05.680]  Bono says he's proud to recall when Germany welcomed frightened Syrian refugees.
[11:05.680 --> 11:11.400]  Remember, this was the same guy who back in 2015 lectured us all not to use the word
[11:11.400 --> 11:12.560]  migrants.
[11:12.560 --> 11:15.120]  We must call them refugees.
[11:15.120 --> 11:16.120]  Then what happened?
[11:16.120 --> 11:20.760]  Waves and waves of migrants, not refugees, flooded into Germany.
[11:20.760 --> 11:26.520]  It was 2,000 migrants who molested over 1,000 women in Cologne on New Year's Eve in 2015.
[11:26.520 --> 11:32.000]  It was a migrant who barreled a truck through a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016,
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.280]  killing 12 people and injuring 56 others.
[11:35.280 --> 11:41.240]  Germany's violent crime rate increased, and 90% of it was attributable to male migrants.
[11:41.240 --> 11:43.520]  Yeah, hope you're proud, Bono.
[11:43.520 --> 11:44.520]  Really proud.
[11:44.520 --> 11:48.480]  Hey, Bono, if you're so proud, why didn't you take in any refugees?
[11:48.480 --> 11:54.640]  I mean, you're worth $700 million, and you own three multi-million dollar properties.
[11:54.640 --> 12:00.080]  But don't expect him to take in any refugees, since he doesn't even like having neighbors.
[12:00.080 --> 12:05.840]  Not content with living in a single mansion in 2005, Bono bought the one next door.
[12:05.840 --> 12:08.400]  Still no room for those frightened Syrian refugees, though.
[12:08.400 --> 12:13.520]  Oh, but he temporarily changed the chorus of the U2 song to raise awareness.
[12:13.520 --> 12:16.080]  So I guess that's something, right?
[12:16.080 --> 12:21.280]  Bono says only dirty right wing nationalists think that diversity is a danger, because
[12:21.280 --> 12:23.640]  Bono loves diversity.
[12:23.640 --> 12:26.120]  He loves diversity so much.
[12:26.120 --> 12:31.680]  He spends most of his time living in an affluent suburb of Dublin that's almost entirely white.
[12:31.680 --> 12:32.800]  So diverse.
[12:32.800 --> 12:37.440]  In a town which is full of mega-rich celebrities like himself, so diverse.
[12:37.440 --> 12:39.760]  What's the difference between God and Bono?
[12:39.760 --> 12:44.680]  God doesn't walk around Dublin believing he's Bono.
[12:44.680 --> 12:45.680]  That was a joke.
[12:45.680 --> 12:46.680]  That really saddens me.
[12:46.680 --> 12:50.440]  Bono says he's proud of Europe's fight to end climate change.
[12:50.440 --> 12:54.800]  A fight that Bono does his best to contribute towards by travelling around Europe in his
[12:54.800 --> 13:00.360]  luxury private Learjet, and lazing around in his CO2 belching 140 foot yacht.
[13:00.360 --> 13:05.520]  U2's private jet carbon footprint for its 2009 tour was also big enough to fly the
[13:05.520 --> 13:07.560]  band to Mars and back.
[13:07.560 --> 13:13.160]  Bono also paid for two long distance taxi rides and a flight to pick up a hat that he'd forgotten.
[13:13.160 --> 13:14.640]  So proud of you, Bono.
[13:14.640 --> 13:18.080]  Bono says he's also proud of the fight to end global poverty.
[13:18.080 --> 13:22.800]  So proud that his charity called out giant corporations who use shell companies and offshore
[13:22.800 --> 13:26.640]  tax havens to siphon much needed funds out of developing countries.
[13:26.640 --> 13:31.240]  But not proud enough for Bono himself to refrain from buying into a partnership of one of those
[13:31.240 --> 13:32.720]  very shell companies.
[13:32.720 --> 13:37.160]  Bono's so proud of the fight to end global poverty that his charity, which was set up
[13:37.160 --> 13:42.080]  to help fight global poverty, gives so much money to help fight global poverty.
[13:42.080 --> 13:43.080]  No, no, that's right.
[13:43.080 --> 13:47.160]  It gives just 1% of its income to fight global poverty.
[13:47.160 --> 13:50.960]  According to Bono, Europeans living under the EU are happier than ever.
[13:50.960 --> 13:55.440]  So happy that according to a recent poll, Europeans living in France, Germany and Spain,
[13:55.440 --> 14:00.160]  the countries most closely embroiled with the EU, are overwhelmingly pessimistic about
[14:00.160 --> 14:01.400]  their children's future.
[14:01.400 --> 14:06.200]  In France, for example, just 9% thought that their children would be better off than them
[14:06.200 --> 14:07.200]  in the future.
[14:07.200 --> 14:08.200]  So happy.
[14:08.200 --> 14:13.560]  Meanwhile, Bono says he's inspired by Pope Francis' solidarity with the most vulnerable.
[14:13.560 --> 14:17.840]  Unless, of course, you're talking about vulnerable children being sexually abused by Catholic
[14:17.840 --> 14:18.840]  priests.
[14:18.840 --> 14:21.720]  Something Pope Francis has helped cover up for years.
[14:21.720 --> 14:22.920]  Here's an idea, Bono.
[14:22.920 --> 14:27.280]  If you really do care about protecting the vulnerable, why not have a word with Pope
[14:27.280 --> 14:32.560]  Pete about how he rewarded the cardinal who raped little boys for decades?
[14:32.560 --> 14:35.880]  Doesn't sound very inspirational to me.
[14:35.880 --> 14:41.320]  So Bono, go ahead and wave your little EU flag, perform your insufferable celebrity
[14:41.320 --> 14:42.640]  virtue signal.
[14:42.640 --> 14:48.720]  Because that very sanctimonious, out of touch, imperious, know-it-all attitude is precisely
[14:48.720 --> 15:18.680]  why we voted to leave the EU in the first place.
[15:18.680 --> 15:23.280]  A lot of folks say, oh, we're censored, or oh, we're under attack, but this is really
[15:23.280 --> 15:25.120]  going on.
[15:25.120 --> 15:27.360]  And so we're going to discuss why is that?
[15:27.360 --> 15:31.200]  Because the answer to that is the answer to everything.
[15:31.200 --> 15:36.600]  And later, I'll tell you, why do I have this Colt 9-11 handgun right here?
[15:36.600 --> 15:40.400]  Well, the same guy that made President Trump won, who's going to the National Archives,
[15:40.400 --> 15:41.400]  made me this.
[15:41.400 --> 15:43.720]  And it is one of the sweetest shooting.
[15:43.720 --> 15:46.040]  I mean, I was shooting bullseye.
[15:46.040 --> 15:50.800]  Like 30 yards the first time I shot it, it's pretty amazing, and it symbolizes Americana.
[15:50.800 --> 15:59.560]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[15:59.560 --> 16:03.160]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[16:03.160 --> 16:06.320]  But sometimes, supplements don't work fast enough.
[16:06.320 --> 16:11.120]  That's why InfoWarsLife has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue Line, Super

[20:31.080 --> 20:42.880]  There's only 65 days left to what is the most important election in world history.
[20:42.880 --> 20:43.880]  We're live.
[20:43.880 --> 20:48.720]  Seven days a week I'm here fighting because this is the most critical time in human development.
[20:48.720 --> 20:51.080]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[20:51.080 --> 20:53.080]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[20:53.080 --> 20:54.320]  All right.
[20:54.320 --> 21:00.120]  I have masses and tons of breaking, incredible video clips, news, your phone calls coming
[21:00.120 --> 21:05.760]  up so much more here today on this live Sunday edition.
[21:05.760 --> 21:11.120]  But the first thing I want to just state is, why is InfoWars under such attack?
[21:11.120 --> 21:15.920]  Why is it demonized so much by corporate media, by the Republican establishment, by the Democrat
[21:15.920 --> 21:18.040]  establishment, by foreign governments?
[21:18.040 --> 21:19.840]  What is it we're covering?
[21:19.840 --> 21:24.680]  Well, it's that there's a breakaway civilization, and that's not just a statement.
[21:24.680 --> 21:32.320]  It's true of the military industrial complex controlled by a technological elite.
[21:32.320 --> 21:38.720]  Those are quotes from President Eisenhower and his farewell address in 1961.
[21:38.720 --> 21:41.840]  And a technological elite of eugenicists.
[21:41.840 --> 21:44.880]  That was the big craze up until the end of World War II.
[21:44.880 --> 21:52.760]  They went underground into the U.S. DARPA development system.
[21:52.760 --> 21:55.880]  Most of them were pro-Hitler, the others were pro-communist.
[21:55.880 --> 21:59.400]  They all believed in command and control, centralization by elites because they're the
[21:59.400 --> 22:02.240]  elites.
[22:02.240 --> 22:07.520]  And they've now established much of a world government that's based on austerity and based
[22:07.520 --> 22:14.040]  on racial division and based on balkanization and based on divide and conquer.
[22:14.040 --> 22:22.520]  And so we are coming at it from a position of it's unelected, it's unaccountable, it's
[22:22.520 --> 22:30.040]  corrupt, it doesn't have your interest in mind, it's very, very evil.
[22:30.040 --> 22:31.840]  We should say no to this.
[22:31.840 --> 22:34.640]  And people around the world are starting to say no to it.
[22:34.640 --> 22:37.600]  People around the world are starting to understand this.
[22:37.600 --> 22:45.480]  And instead of just being tribal about a football team or a baseball team or even your church,
[22:45.480 --> 22:49.600]  which isn't about Christ, but about the community of the church and most of these things, they're
[22:49.600 --> 22:51.440]  just social clubs.
[22:51.440 --> 22:57.880]  What about the human ethos of renaissance and controlling your own destiny and being
[22:57.880 --> 23:02.280]  free that God really tried to build and give you a chance at?
[23:02.280 --> 23:08.280]  What about that first understanding of free will?
[23:08.280 --> 23:12.480]  And globalism is about a worldwide social credit score, a mark of the beast, where if
[23:12.480 --> 23:16.360]  you don't behave and do what they say, you're basically blocked off from society, you can
[23:16.360 --> 23:17.360]  starve to death.
[23:17.360 --> 23:20.920]  And you try to live out in the country like the Amish or something, here come the armored
[23:20.920 --> 23:23.000]  vehicles, because they say you're a cult.
[23:23.000 --> 23:24.760]  This is manifesting.
[23:24.760 --> 23:26.240]  This is happening.
[23:26.240 --> 23:37.200]  This is the big issue that we face as a civilization and as a society right now.
[23:37.200 --> 23:46.120]  So that's why they're trying to shut us down, is because you can talk about left-wing or
[23:46.120 --> 23:50.880]  right-wing, you can debate fascism versus anti-fascism, you can debate all this window
[23:50.880 --> 23:57.480]  dressing and all the deck chairs and furniture and silverware and cutlery and plates and
[23:57.480 --> 24:02.440]  China and the food being delivered onto the deck of the Titanic, right as it hits that
[24:02.440 --> 24:05.440]  iceberg.
[24:05.440 --> 24:11.080]  But you've hit the iceberg.
[24:11.080 --> 24:13.640]  And so the question is, what are you going to do about it?
[24:13.640 --> 24:18.080]  And I'm the one pointing out the ship's listing and that Trump's trying to save the ship and
[24:18.080 --> 24:23.640]  he's got pumps going, they're trying to put fires out, and the average leftist is trying
[24:23.640 --> 24:29.360]  to sabotage that saying that, you know, we've got to basically send the ship to the bottom
[24:29.360 --> 24:31.920]  and that's how we fix things.
[24:31.920 --> 24:35.600]  And you've got Bill Maher and you've got the other Democrats saying, let's have a depression,
[24:35.600 --> 24:41.200]  let's teach Americans to submit and you've got them so freaked out we have a 4.6% growth
[24:41.200 --> 24:47.280]  rate and they're doing everything they can to sabotage the productivity of this country
[24:47.280 --> 24:51.040]  and of capitalism because they're the globalists, they already have a rigged economy, they already
[24:51.040 --> 24:52.880]  have private jets, they already have money.
[24:52.880 --> 24:57.840]  They want you to live in a two-party system where you're a communist on the ground having
[24:57.840 --> 25:02.600]  nothing like a poor Chinese surf, but then the political party are all a bunch of billionaires
[25:02.600 --> 25:06.280]  who are above the law and can have you executed like that.
[25:06.280 --> 25:12.800]  It's called authoritarianism, it's not fascism, it's not communism, it's authoritarianism
[25:12.800 --> 25:17.800]  carried out by an oligarchy, a plutocracy.
[25:17.800 --> 25:22.920]  And if you don't know what those terms are, look them up and understand what we're facing.
[25:22.920 --> 25:26.240]  I keep seeing it's still using Google as a search engine constantly.
[25:26.240 --> 25:30.720]  Google is worthless, it's a broken search engine, it doesn't work, Bing is Microsoft
[25:30.720 --> 25:34.720]  but it's kind of the old Google search thing, that goes okay, I just want to point that
[25:34.720 --> 25:36.600]  out to the viewers.
[25:36.600 --> 25:43.240]  Now, who are the globalists, what is their aim, what do they want to do, and when you
[25:43.240 --> 25:47.560]  find out how monstrous they are, when you find out how bad they are, when you find out
[25:47.560 --> 25:57.400]  how out of control they are, then it becomes exponential understanding that you've got
[25:57.400 --> 26:04.480]  to stop them, that you've got to do something to block them because they are literally predatory
[26:04.480 --> 26:06.680]  and out to get you.
[26:06.680 --> 26:14.560]  The New York Times isn't a yellow journalism fake news outfit, it is a kingpan-owned anti-American
[26:14.560 --> 26:23.320]  robber baron weaponized mafia intimidation weapon system run by stay behind networks
[26:23.320 --> 26:30.240]  of Barack Hussein Obama and the foundations and the CIA publicly.
[26:30.240 --> 26:34.400]  And it freaks them out at the Washington Post, the New York Times, and CNN that are all
[26:34.400 --> 26:41.960]  part of the same group that I know this because it's their religion that you're dumb scum.
[26:41.960 --> 26:48.240]  When they go to a barbecue in flower country, they look at you as dumb idiot bumpkins and
[26:48.240 --> 26:52.720]  see it rub salt in their wounds that I have a Texas twang and they've got this idea that
[26:52.720 --> 26:57.680]  Texans wipe their asses with corn cobs and that we ride horses to work.
[26:57.680 --> 27:02.800]  And so the fact that I am alpha male and I have a gravelly voice and I am confident and
[27:02.800 --> 27:08.800]  I am aggressive and I know more about their criminal operations than they do, that completely
[27:08.800 --> 27:12.200]  and totally flips them out.
[27:12.200 --> 27:19.120]  Because if you're a pinhead genetic psychopath like Zuckerberg or Eric Smith or Barack Obama
[27:19.120 --> 27:27.360]  chosen because you come from lines of people, they're absolutely evil because you operate
[27:27.360 --> 27:32.840]  with no emotion except for domination of the innocent and to abort humanity, the spirit
[27:32.840 --> 27:39.200]  of pure Satanism, abort humanity, destroy humanity, toast the evil, dominate, destroy
[27:39.200 --> 27:47.240]  creation, become God because they come from blasphemous bloodlines, that's what it is,
[27:47.240 --> 27:52.040]  committed to destruction of you and your family with laser hate focus.
[27:52.040 --> 27:59.280]  The fact that they see humanity struggling free from their spiritual bloodlust enrages
[27:59.280 --> 28:04.160]  them and they see that I'm not afraid except for failure and that I'm moving against them
[28:04.160 --> 28:09.120]  and that we're building a community of people that care and use our own instincts and spirit
[28:09.120 --> 28:14.760]  not to worship football or some facsimile or some prosthesis but the real thing and
[28:14.760 --> 28:21.480]  as we pull away from their system, they become more and more and more panicked.
[28:21.480 --> 28:26.640]  And they don't know what to do and they're scared.
[28:26.640 --> 28:30.200]  And so we're on the battlefield now with these people but the reason we've been banned is
[28:30.200 --> 28:33.160]  we're talking about the real world, we're talking about the real system, we're talking
[28:33.160 --> 28:39.320]  about how it actually operates and pointing out who they are and that's why they want
[28:39.320 --> 28:43.600]  us destroyed because we have hope and we believe in you and you believe in us and we formed
[28:43.600 --> 28:44.600]  a community.
[28:44.600 --> 28:49.480]  Now we come back, this whole McCain thing is a giant distraction and sickening but from
[28:49.480 --> 28:54.000]  this evil we can learn something so play some of these key clips of the scripting and look
[28:54.000 --> 29:03.600]  at the message behind the globalist vampires overall operation.
[29:03.600 --> 29:08.560]  Years ago Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[29:08.560 --> 29:09.560]  yeast.
[29:09.560 --> 29:13.120]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew
[29:13.120 --> 29:17.000]  we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[29:17.000 --> 29:22.160]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed
[29:22.160 --> 29:26.360]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better
[29:26.360 --> 29:28.400]  product to help your body fight back.

[29:33.080 --> 29:37.760]  tract and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.

[29:41.840 --> 29:46.440]  bark and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test
[29:46.440 --> 29:49.440]  of time as powerful microbalancing properties.
[29:49.440 --> 30:00.560]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com, that's InfoWarsLife.com.
[30:00.560 --> 30:05.440]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[30:05.440 --> 30:09.880]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all
[30:09.880 --> 30:14.960]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[30:14.960 --> 30:20.200]  That's why InfoWarsLife created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula, the new platinum
[30:20.200 --> 30:23.600]  standard of advanced multivitamin formulation.
[30:23.600 --> 30:28.360]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your

[30:54.040 --> 31:00.520]  Mineral Fusion today, available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[31:00.520 --> 31:04.880]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[31:04.880 --> 31:09.600]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[31:09.600 --> 31:11.120]  to detoxify the body.
[31:11.120 --> 31:16.000]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[31:16.000 --> 31:21.200]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[31:21.200 --> 31:24.280]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[31:24.280 --> 31:26.520]  It is a classical 360-win.
[31:26.520 --> 31:31.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[31:31.000 --> 31:35.680]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[31:35.680 --> 31:36.680]  get.
[31:36.680 --> 31:39.880]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[31:39.880 --> 31:44.920]  country and the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[31:44.920 --> 31:50.160]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[31:50.160 --> 31:52.880]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[31:52.880 --> 31:56.160]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[31:56.160 --> 32:00.160]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and InfoWarsLife.com.
[32:00.160 --> 32:05.520]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[32:05.520 --> 32:10.680]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[32:10.680 --> 32:17.520]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[32:17.520 --> 32:23.400]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[32:23.400 --> 32:26.720]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[32:26.720 --> 32:31.640]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[32:31.640 --> 32:36.720]  of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[32:36.720 --> 32:37.720]  symptoms.
[32:37.720 --> 32:41.640]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[32:41.640 --> 32:46.320]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[32:46.320 --> 32:52.120]  tryptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[32:52.120 --> 32:54.800]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[32:54.800 --> 33:21.760]  Get to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[33:25.800 --> 33:33.080]  You know, there's only been a few people who have come out and told you from the inside
[33:33.080 --> 33:35.760]  what's going on.
[33:35.760 --> 33:42.400]  But if you actually look at the news and all the things that are going on, what you're
[33:42.400 --> 33:51.120]  being told by Bill Joy of Sun Microsystems and people like Elon Musk is exactly what's
[33:51.120 --> 33:53.880]  going on.
[33:53.880 --> 33:58.320]  And so I've got literally dozens of amazing clips, I've got hundreds of amazing articles,
[33:58.320 --> 34:01.960]  I've got guests chomping at the bit to come on the show, I've got all these really interesting
[34:01.960 --> 34:10.040]  reports but I just know at a fundamental level, I want to explain this, Hollywood, the whole
[34:10.040 --> 34:15.200]  culture, everything that the media sells you is bad for you to dumb you down to control
[34:15.200 --> 34:21.160]  you to get you out of the way because the establishment wants to steal the future.
[34:21.160 --> 34:25.760]  And they want to bring in third world populations to drive down wages and blow up the engine
[34:25.760 --> 34:30.880]  of free market and savings because they don't want any competition.
[34:30.880 --> 34:34.360]  And they write books admitting all of this.
[34:34.360 --> 34:42.080]  So see, it's not my opinion but they say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing
[34:42.080 --> 34:49.040]  over and over again with imagining different results but here's the problem, I'm not insane.
[34:49.040 --> 34:53.360]  And we have rebooted you and I together, this audience who are really activist, who are the
[34:53.360 --> 34:59.640]  tip of the spear, Americana, free market, renaissance, understanding of globalism, we're winning all
[34:59.640 --> 35:02.640]  over the world.
[35:02.640 --> 35:07.160]  Globalism is in trouble all over the world, the fact that big banks lecture everybody to
[35:07.160 --> 35:12.360]  open borders and raise taxes but they live behind big walls and they're tax exempt and
[35:12.360 --> 35:20.360]  they have bodyguards but they want our firearms.
[35:20.360 --> 35:29.640]  It's elitism, it's hypocrisy and people know that, people understand that.
[35:29.640 --> 35:34.520]  So I'm going to explain it again real, real slow.
[35:34.520 --> 35:44.640]  Most people would kill to be the black sheep bad boy, most banned news information in the
[35:44.640 --> 35:46.600]  world.
[35:46.600 --> 35:53.280]  Well I would kill, not literally but figuratively, to not be banned until when I have the number
[35:53.280 --> 35:58.080]  one Android app or the number one iPhone app, they leave it at the top instead of delisting
[35:58.080 --> 35:59.080]  it.
[35:59.080 --> 36:00.560]  We went to number one, they just delisted it.
[36:00.560 --> 36:01.560]  It's still number one.
[36:01.560 --> 36:07.360]  There are millions of downloads, a piece now but they don't want to give any attention
[36:07.360 --> 36:11.640]  to the fact that you want freedom.
[36:11.640 --> 36:16.440]  They don't give any attention to the fact that you want free market or that you want Americana
[36:16.440 --> 36:22.280]  or that you want Apple and Google to not run slave factories because Google's involved
[36:22.280 --> 36:28.960]  with some of their androids as well in China and that you want them to be moral companies.
[36:28.960 --> 36:33.240]  They don't want you to feel like you're lobbying or what you do has any power.
[36:33.240 --> 36:40.320]  They want to demoralize you and everything they do is about demoralizing you.
[36:40.320 --> 36:44.200]  They're setting up a corporate world government where everything you do is tracked in real
[36:44.200 --> 36:55.560]  time to game you and scam you and rip you off and consolidate markets in their own words
[36:55.560 --> 37:03.120]  and then they use all this fake liberal talk about Black Lives Matter and transsexual this
[37:03.120 --> 37:09.640]  and that as just nebulous cover stories about how Tim Cook's good because he's gay and so
[37:09.640 --> 37:16.120]  it's okay that Apple has the worst factories in China or oh the head of Google's an Indian
[37:16.120 --> 37:18.480]  person so he can't be bad.
[37:18.480 --> 37:23.920]  He doesn't have to talk to Congress and it's so cheap and it's so stupid but the large
[37:23.920 --> 37:32.880]  gist of having somewhat of a free country created so much wealth that the average person
[37:32.880 --> 37:39.360]  is just basically stunned and in La La Land and watching Netflix shows and the average
[37:39.360 --> 37:46.000]  man thinks acting upright and being part of the establishment is what gets him ahead.
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.120]  When the truth is he's not even a player in the arena and might as well not even exist
[37:51.120 --> 37:55.400]  if you're not fighting globalism because it's the mark of the beast, it's the one world
[37:55.400 --> 37:59.120]  government, it's the end of the family.
[37:59.120 --> 38:05.920]  Everything this system does is to target goodness and sustainability and independence and it's
[38:05.920 --> 38:14.600]  here and it's attacking you and your family and it wants info wars off the air as they
[38:14.600 --> 38:23.800]  call me from NBC to CBS to CNN of virus and a disease and an evil horrible dark hearted
[38:23.800 --> 38:28.360]  person who they didn't lie about when anybody that's actually listened knows it's the opposite
[38:28.360 --> 38:34.640]  and why is it because we studied the globalist paradigm, we know their operation and it's
[38:34.640 --> 38:40.480]  not that hard and if other people start looking into what we've said as intelligence agencies
[38:40.480 --> 38:46.320]  have done, as militaries have done, as members of our own government and other governments
[38:46.320 --> 38:52.640]  have done, they go my god why did we never see this now it all makes sense and once you
[38:52.640 --> 39:00.280]  see that tiny technological scientific mad scientist elite and you see how anti-human
[39:00.280 --> 39:07.480]  they are, you're very humanity, you're very bones, cries out against it on our great quest
[39:07.480 --> 39:18.920]  to the stars from fire on to distant nebulas and other dimensions and you realize the fundamental
[39:18.920 --> 39:24.360]  threat and the fear and the anxiety you've been feeling but not knowing what it is is
[39:24.360 --> 39:30.840]  being misdirected by the social engineers but they're the threat and they're the problem
[39:30.840 --> 39:36.320]  and they're the enemy and they're the ones that want to steal the future from you and
[39:36.320 --> 39:43.800]  your family so your future, your birthright, your soul, your destiny is all being stolen
[39:43.800 --> 39:54.400]  from you right now, that's a fact, it's incontrovertible, it's prima facie, it's on its face and that's
[39:54.400 --> 39:57.960]  why they want to shut down, that's why they're scared of us, that's why they want to soft
[39:57.960 --> 40:02.840]  the ear, that's why they want to make an example out of info wars to say anybody else stands
[40:02.840 --> 40:10.200]  up will destroy you like Alex Jones because they think you're scared, they don't know
[40:10.200 --> 40:15.840]  you were asleep and all of us were asleep to degrees and so they keep thinking because
[40:15.840 --> 40:21.040]  they're fear based and they're cowards that if they try to make you scared that's going
[40:21.040 --> 40:30.480]  to make you submit but once you realize that if you submit it sells you and your family
[40:30.480 --> 40:38.880]  out and that it literally destroys your soul because you sign on to spiritual enslavement
[40:38.880 --> 40:44.480]  then you realize all that matters is resisting these people, all that matters is free will,
[40:44.480 --> 40:51.640]  all that matters is getting out of their control and then it becomes a struggle and once you're
[40:51.640 --> 40:55.640]  in the struggle you don't think about the consequences anymore because you've already
[40:55.640 --> 41:00.000]  counted the consequences and your gut knows the truth and you move against it with an
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.960]  extroval strength and it's the strength of this audience of activists in the arena and
[41:05.960 --> 41:11.520]  the strength of our crew and the strength of our guests and the strength of our will.
[41:11.520 --> 41:16.600]  Studying the globalist operation even more than they themselves study it causing a debate
[41:16.600 --> 41:23.200]  within their compartmentalized systems that fundamentally challenges their entire paradigm
[41:23.200 --> 41:27.600]  and that's why they want us off the air because we look at the John McCain's and we look at
[41:27.600 --> 41:31.720]  the establishment and where they die and what they have and they're so empty, they're so
[41:31.720 --> 41:38.200]  pathetic, they're so wicked, they're so crazed that you're like my God sell my soul to be
[41:38.200 --> 41:41.640]  that and then you realize it's all a fraud.
[41:41.640 --> 41:46.360]  I said I'd play the clips of them at the McCain funeral and just the inversion of reality
[41:46.360 --> 41:49.240]  but I'll do that in the next segment.
[41:49.240 --> 41:52.560]  Very briefly if you do not financially fund us and get great products at the same time
[41:52.560 --> 41:56.600]  the enemy will win but they're really angry that despite all their attacks the last few
[41:56.600 --> 41:59.880]  years we are still moving forward.
[41:59.880 --> 42:03.440]  They've slowed us down a little bit but thanks to you it looks like we may jump to the next
[42:03.440 --> 42:04.440]  level.
[42:04.440 --> 42:10.920]  We've got a Labor Day special sales up to 50% off on our best selling supplements, amazing

[42:19.600 --> 42:20.600]  of it.
[42:20.600 --> 42:24.600]  By the way bodies is about to sell out as the strongest tumeric formula out there from
[42:24.600 --> 42:29.600]  our research the curcuminoid level is 95% the competitors are 3% because they're just
[42:29.600 --> 42:30.600]  a scam.
[42:30.600 --> 42:34.240]  They just have a bunch of marketing and don't give you any real curcumin and this is the
[42:34.240 --> 42:38.320]  strongest out there and it's about to sell out but you get a 5% off despite that 60 day

[47:21.000 --> 47:27.240]  Okay, so our intrepid reporter Millie Weaver has been going to all these Trump rallies
[47:27.240 --> 47:34.920]  across the country in Ohio, Indiana, Florida, you name it, her and Gavin Wentz, her husband,
[47:34.920 --> 47:40.160]  they're a great team and their camper, they have a son too, driving around the country
[47:40.160 --> 47:45.120]  of Fremful Wars, covering things on the road like the solar eclipses, lunar eclipses, you
[47:45.120 --> 47:46.600]  name it.
[47:46.600 --> 47:54.120]  But watch live, Black America celebrates Trump recovery and make America great again love.
[47:54.120 --> 47:58.760]  I did a live feed before the show today.
[47:58.760 --> 48:03.000]  And it's posted up on the site, there's also her report as well.
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.560]  It is powerful and very, very heartwarming.
[48:06.560 --> 48:11.960]  And you listen to these people who happen to have dark skin and they're just so well
[48:11.960 --> 48:15.680]  spoken and so nice and so good.
[48:15.680 --> 48:19.920]  And they say, hey, if you're black, come to a Trump rally, you never got so much love.
[48:19.920 --> 48:23.760]  And they talk about one guy's in a union, he says, I've never had so much work and everybody
[48:23.760 --> 48:26.840]  else is like, this is awesome.
[48:26.840 --> 48:30.120]  And then the media sits there and attacks them.
[48:30.120 --> 48:32.600]  And there's one of the famous guys, blacks for Trump.
[48:32.600 --> 48:35.160]  I've got up on the screen of your TV viewer.
[48:35.160 --> 48:41.080]  You can see his, you got his Hillary for prison in fours.com bumper sticker.
[48:41.080 --> 48:45.440]  All orders, by the way, in four store.com, get some of those.
[48:45.440 --> 48:47.480]  But it's just a very, very powerful video.
[48:47.480 --> 48:52.600]  That's my overall breakdown of it on the site, but you can also find her video in fours
[48:52.600 --> 48:53.600]  just by itself.
[48:53.600 --> 48:55.400]  There's a bunch of others, just amazing.
[48:55.400 --> 49:03.160]  So I do intend next hour to play her little short report on black Americans celebrate
[49:03.160 --> 49:08.720]  Trump recovery and make America great again, love, because that's what it's all about is
[49:08.720 --> 49:13.520]  this is your country, whether you're brown skinned or white skinned or pink skinned or
[49:13.520 --> 49:17.960]  whatever it is, you've got more opportunities here than almost anywhere else in the world.
[49:17.960 --> 49:20.440]  And the globalists are trying to pull that down and destroy it.
[49:20.440 --> 49:22.960]  Now, let's talk about the facts here.
[49:22.960 --> 49:30.360]  I've interviewed sailors who were on the forest stall when McCain did the wet start and fired
[49:30.360 --> 49:34.280]  the rocket and blow up a bunch of planes and his dab was the top admiral and they covered
[49:34.280 --> 49:35.280]  it up.
[49:35.280 --> 49:40.560]  But let's forget that he was then in the Keating five and stole $500 billion and admitted
[49:40.560 --> 49:41.560]  he said, Oh, it's terrible.
[49:41.560 --> 49:44.560]  What I did will be on my tombstone, but no, it's not because they're covering up for
[49:44.560 --> 49:45.560]  your crimes.
[49:45.560 --> 49:51.720]  So he was for open borders, gun control, help the Democrats through the election to Obama,
[49:51.720 --> 49:57.200]  consider it against getting rid of Obamacare, help fund ISIS, help cover up Benghazi.
[49:57.200 --> 49:59.160]  The guy's a monster.
[49:59.160 --> 50:04.520]  But the media and the both political parties are trying to create this weird, sick unity
[50:04.520 --> 50:05.800]  for their corrupt system.
[50:05.800 --> 50:06.800]  Nobody likes it.
[50:06.800 --> 50:07.800]  Nobody wants.
[50:07.800 --> 50:14.560]  And you get McCain's Democrat Party daughter up there and everything else.
[50:14.560 --> 50:15.800]  It's just a sick joke.
[50:15.800 --> 50:18.400]  We're going to go to that in a moment.
[50:18.400 --> 50:22.760]  But everything they say about Trump is again, inversed.
[50:22.760 --> 50:28.480]  Megan McCain says that Trump is full of all this fake rhetoric.
[50:28.480 --> 50:31.680]  Oh, what's he got a magic wand?
[50:31.680 --> 50:33.920]  Like Obama said, you cannot get to 3% growth rate.
[50:33.920 --> 50:37.920]  It's down 4.6.
[50:37.920 --> 50:44.160]  In fact, they're reporting record stakes are being sold record home purchases, record
[50:44.160 --> 50:52.840]  building record and now Trump's cut the growth of the deficit in half, which is a start.
[50:52.840 --> 50:57.720]  I mean, how do you sit there and watch what Trump's doing like turning water into wine?
[50:57.720 --> 50:59.880]  And I'm not comparing to Christ.
[50:59.880 --> 51:05.360]  I'm just saying it's it's it's metaphysical and then get super angry and then cheerlead
[51:05.360 --> 51:06.600]  the downfall of the country.
[51:06.600 --> 51:08.440]  It's just crazy.
[51:08.440 --> 51:11.520]  People spitting in the face of their own recovery.
[51:11.520 --> 51:16.040]  But the first thing I want to play is a little clip of Chuck Todd in BC ran the hoax with
[51:16.040 --> 51:19.680]  media matters and everybody else that I said, get your battle rifles ready.
[51:19.680 --> 51:22.360]  And I won't even say it on air because they'll cut it out.
[51:22.360 --> 51:24.160]  I mean, they're so criminal.
[51:24.160 --> 51:25.160]  They're so evil.
[51:25.160 --> 51:28.760]  There's such frauds that then they say that that I said, get your battle rifles ready
[51:28.760 --> 51:30.880]  and use them on the press, which I never said.
[51:30.880 --> 51:35.320]  Well, they came out and said, oh, this unifies America.
[51:35.320 --> 51:39.720]  You know, it's either saying by to an old legacy, which it really is a little moment
[51:39.720 --> 51:43.560]  of truth by Chuck Todd, the Democratic operative, or it's a call to arms.
[51:43.560 --> 51:50.000]  Well, that doesn't mean and we posted the article on info wars.com from newsbusters
[51:50.000 --> 51:55.640]  saying Democrats call for more violence, which they do all the time.
[51:55.640 --> 51:57.080]  Hashtag hunt Republicans, all of it.
[51:57.080 --> 52:00.680]  But but that saying a call to arms is not a call to arms.
[52:00.680 --> 52:06.200]  Like when I say we're an information war, playing a game of chicken, it's high noon,
[52:06.200 --> 52:10.920]  and we're going to march out there and not blink and take them down.
[52:10.920 --> 52:14.320]  That doesn't mean I mean literally.
[52:14.320 --> 52:15.840]  And Chuck Todd did not mean that.
[52:15.840 --> 52:18.640]  And I just want to say I'm taking the high road, even though NBC doesn't.
[52:18.640 --> 52:24.040]  So I could be like, did you hear Chuck Todd called for violence?
[52:24.040 --> 52:28.080]  Chuck Todd called for calling the arms and weapons to kill Republicans.
[52:28.080 --> 52:29.080]  Did you hear?
[52:29.080 --> 52:31.760]  Well, Chuck Todd be taken off major scandal.
[52:31.760 --> 52:35.960]  Did you hear Chuck Todd said, get guns and attack Republicans?
[52:35.960 --> 52:36.960]  That's what Lester Holt did.
[52:36.960 --> 52:38.640]  He goes, I'm getting chills right now.
[52:38.640 --> 52:41.720]  Jones called for getting guns and attacking us physically and killing us.
[52:41.720 --> 52:44.120]  You are a damn liar.
[52:44.120 --> 52:47.560]  I was talking about Antifa saying they're coming to kill members of eyes at their houses
[52:47.560 --> 52:49.920]  and members of Congress like Scalise.
[52:49.920 --> 52:53.400]  And I said, if I was a member of Congress or I was doxxed by Antifa, I'd have my battle
[52:53.400 --> 52:55.000]  rival to protect myself.
[52:55.000 --> 53:02.680]  That's the opposite of saying go out and kill people, holy mackerel.
[53:02.680 --> 53:04.800]  But again, that's the front they are.
[53:04.800 --> 53:08.840]  Nothing uses hyperbole like it's high noon or the Red River shootout.
[53:08.840 --> 53:12.920]  Does that mean the Sooners in Oklahoma and the UT Texans are going to actually shoot
[53:12.920 --> 53:15.400]  each other at the Cotton Bowl?
[53:15.400 --> 53:18.000]  Call the Red River shootout.
[53:18.000 --> 53:19.720]  Does it mean it's a physical one?
[53:19.720 --> 53:21.880]  And again, that's the fraud of these people.
[53:21.880 --> 53:27.880]  How would every major channel in the country say that I said kill Mueller, which I never
[53:27.880 --> 53:34.520]  said, or I said get guns and go off the media because they're getting ready to do it themselves.
[53:34.520 --> 53:37.640]  Just like the sun came up this morning, we're 65 days out.
[53:37.640 --> 53:39.200]  Be vigilant, have your cameras ready.
[53:39.200 --> 53:43.200]  When something happens, go to the scene, document it because they don't want us questioning
[53:43.200 --> 53:44.200]  it.
[53:44.200 --> 53:47.200]  They want me out of the way and it's credited ahead of their move on Trump.
[53:47.200 --> 53:48.760]  I'm not that important.
[53:48.760 --> 53:53.880]  The audience is important as eyes and ears, and that's why they want you silenced.
[53:53.880 --> 53:58.120]  So in the interest of fairness and in showing we take the high road, I could go my good
[53:58.120 --> 54:04.600]  by their yardstick, Chuck Todd just called for the murder of President Trump with firearms,
[54:04.600 --> 54:05.600]  a call to arms.
[54:05.600 --> 54:06.600]  No, it's not.
[54:06.600 --> 54:09.800]  It's a figure of speech.
[54:09.800 --> 54:13.800]  We have Democrats calling for me to be indicted in newspapers for saying I'm going to have
[54:13.800 --> 54:20.040]  a confrontation politically at high noon and I'm not going to blink with Mueller.
[54:20.040 --> 54:21.880]  I mean, this is crazy.
[54:21.880 --> 54:26.360]  So the last thing I'd want is that corrupt guy having something done to me.
[54:26.360 --> 54:28.640]  I'm going to make him a martyr.
[54:28.640 --> 54:29.640]  Let's go ahead and go check it out.
[54:29.640 --> 54:30.640]  Here it is.
[54:30.640 --> 54:35.600]  As I had a few senators who I talked to during, before the event and after, who said, you
[54:35.600 --> 54:38.160]  know what, maybe it'll be a call to arms.
[54:38.160 --> 54:44.040]  Maybe the fact that you had to think about this, you had spontaneous applause, breakout
[54:44.040 --> 54:45.280]  for Megan McCain's eulogy.
[54:45.280 --> 54:46.280]  Yeah.
[54:46.280 --> 54:49.880]  When was the last time you heard that applause at a eulogy?
[54:49.880 --> 54:53.280]  Remains to be seen if anything will change based on it, but certainly that energy was
[54:53.280 --> 54:55.360]  in the room yesterday in that cathedral.
[54:55.360 --> 54:56.680]  Okay.
[54:56.680 --> 54:59.480]  So a call to arms means getting together, really taking action.
[54:59.480 --> 55:02.160]  It does not mean shooting anybody, okay?
[55:02.160 --> 55:09.320]  But the media thinks you're so dumb when I say the exact same stuff and say politically,
[55:09.320 --> 55:13.640]  I'm going to, you're like, we're dropping truth bombs.
[55:13.640 --> 55:16.800]  When you know when you're over the target, you're getting the flack and we're dropping
[55:16.800 --> 55:19.640]  those 2,000 pound bombs.
[55:19.640 --> 55:26.040]  Remember Glenn Beckley's on CNN and kind of a fake conservative, but money bombs and
[55:26.040 --> 55:32.800]  Ron Paul's raising like $5 million a day sometimes, he go, they talk about Guy Fox
[55:32.800 --> 55:37.400]  day and bombs and blowing up and they have things called money bombs where they want
[55:37.400 --> 55:39.200]  to blow up things.
[55:39.200 --> 55:43.200]  That was before folks knew what a money bomb was trying to hope you thought that that's
[55:43.200 --> 55:47.240]  the brain at CNN saying, do that.
[55:47.240 --> 55:50.400]  No, they're the ones hyping violence.
[55:50.400 --> 55:53.800]  They're the ones gearing up all this.
[55:53.800 --> 56:01.960]  So let's go ahead now and go to Megan McCain, this Democrat, anti-gun, anti-American globalist
[56:01.960 --> 56:04.320]  saying that there's cheap rhetoric out of Trump.
[56:04.320 --> 56:06.280]  No, Trump's been delivering.
[56:06.280 --> 56:07.760]  Here it is.
[56:07.760 --> 56:11.360]  He was a great man.
[56:11.360 --> 56:15.120]  We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness.
[56:15.120 --> 56:20.640]  The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he
[56:20.640 --> 56:27.680]  gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege
[56:27.680 --> 56:28.960]  while he suffered and served.
[56:28.960 --> 56:30.240]  What a hateful woman.
[56:30.240 --> 56:32.480]  He was a great fire who burned bright.
[56:32.480 --> 56:34.040]  Oh yeah, right.
[56:34.040 --> 56:36.240]  Globalist, total, total globalist.
[56:36.240 --> 56:38.240]  So there you go.
[56:38.240 --> 56:41.960]  Now, Obama gets up there and talks a bunch of tracks.
[56:41.960 --> 56:42.960]  That's coming up.
[56:42.960 --> 56:46.840]  But again, real rhetoric, rhetoric saying there's no magic wine.
[56:46.840 --> 56:48.640]  Trump actually did it.
[56:48.640 --> 56:49.640]  And it's coming back.
[56:49.640 --> 56:50.640]  Trump's delivering.
[56:50.640 --> 56:52.520]  Trump's the opposite of rhetoric.
[56:52.520 --> 56:53.520]  Trump's delivering.
[56:53.520 --> 56:56.280]  Here it is.
[56:56.280 --> 57:04.480]  But for those folks who've lost their job right now because a plant went down to Mexico,
[57:04.480 --> 57:06.760]  that isn't going to make you feel better.
[57:06.760 --> 57:14.160]  And so what we have to do is to make sure that folks are trained for the job that are
[57:14.160 --> 57:20.720]  coming in now because some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back.
[57:20.720 --> 57:27.200]  And when somebody says, like the person you just mentioned, who I'm not going to advertise
[57:27.200 --> 57:32.680]  for, that he's going to bring all these jobs back, well, how exactly are you going to do
[57:32.680 --> 57:33.680]  that?
[57:33.680 --> 57:34.680]  What are you going to do?
[57:34.680 --> 57:37.800]  There's no answer to it.
[57:37.800 --> 57:41.000]  He just says, well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.440]  Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[57:45.440 --> 57:48.120]  What magic wine do you have?
[57:48.120 --> 57:50.200]  And he's not a traitor, Obama.

[59:53.560 --> 01:00:19.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:28.680]  Alright folks, Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign and the next guy they think
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:33.400]  Mueller wants to indict but can't find anything, is going to be hosting the last two segments
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.400]  of the show.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.280]  I want to give him the floor to cover a lot of big developments, but he's just as nauseated
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:44.040]  as I am by Megan McCain and the whole, like it's like Jesus Christ just got crucified.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:48.720]  I mean, he was this horribly corrupt guy, but I wanted to mention to you, Roger, there's
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:54.720]  big articles out on InfoWars.com from high-level sources that they even tried to script oligarchs
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.120]  to claim that they'd paid off Trump but couldn't do it.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:03.840]  And there's also Democrat senators seeing in reports, Russians penetrated Florida voter
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.800]  registration systems with no proof.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.560]  He's way behind in the polls.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:13.880]  So Democrat Senator Bill Nelson, who's up for reelection this year as a state, Donald
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:18.480]  Trump won, said Russians have penetrated some of the state's voter registration system.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.360]  So any Americans wanting to get rid of the Democrats, we're all Russians now.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.440]  This is ridiculous.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.440]  It's preposterous.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:31.040]  I guess the Russians just gave us a 4.6% growth rate.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.560]  I guess the Russians just cut off the Russian oil and gas sales and devastated them.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.320]  I mean, I guess, I mean, this is preposterous.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.000]  I mean, if the Russians are doing this, my God, they're our best friends ever.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.200]  But obviously they're not.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.680]  So what's your take on that and what's coming up?
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.480]  Well, let's kind of take this one at a time.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.480]  You're right.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.040]  The McCain Love Fest, which is wall-to-wall on broadcast television, more opulent and
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:02.040]  more effusive than anything for Ronald Reagan or any other former president, never mind
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.280]  a senator.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.320]  But the most telling piece of video was when Barack Obama said, John McCain and I always
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.840]  knew we were on the same side.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:11.840]  There it is, folks.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.840]  He said it.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:13.840]  On the same side.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:20.080]  Globalists, council on foreign relations, trilateral commission, one-world government,
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.560]  the two-party duopoly that has run this country into the ditch.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.440]  And then you played this clip, but I have to go back to it, where Meghan McCain says,
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.920]  we gather the morning passing American of greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:40.680]  from men who never came near the sacrifice he gave willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:45.680]  of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:50.400]  Alex, John McCain was worth $200 million.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.520]  When he ran for president, he was asked into debate how many homes he owned he couldn't
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.520]  remember.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:00.800]  How did he make $200 million on the salary of a U.S. senator?
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:06.360]  The systematic effort to erase all of his blemishes, the fact that he was personally responsible
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:16.280]  for the deaths of 134 of his fellow men in the Navy on the deck of the forestall, is
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.200]  erased from history.
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.560]  If he were not the son of a...
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.400]  Or helping found Isis, he was a monstrous creature.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:28.520]  Look, and I have delayed this commentary until...
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.720]  No, no, I agree, but it's gotten disgusting now.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.720]  I mean, God am I.
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:34.920]  Well, it's so over the top that I think people aren't seeing the fruit.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:38.440]  It's basically Satan worship.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:42.600]  We need to get that clip of Barack Obama saying he and McCain were on the same side and played
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.600]  over and over again.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.000]  Yeah, guys, pull that up, because I don't have his full comments.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.760]  I did see that, just search YouTube, Obama says me and McCain on the same size.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.600]  That is key.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:57.080]  The other thing I would have to say is, since I'm at the beach with the family and I've
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:03.480]  had CNN on, I'm still astounded at the extent to which they no longer even pretend to be
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.760]  a network.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:10.160]  They no longer pretend to have any semblance of balance in their panels.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:15.440]  Their panels now consist of three liberals bashing Trump wall-to-wall, no objectivity,
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.680]  no credibility.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.800]  They're virtually drooling in their hatred.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.800]  It's really...
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.800]  Well, they're getting panicked by the 4.6% rate and everything that's happening.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.800]  Roger, you're going to be hosting two segments.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.800]  You're loaded for bear.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.480]  We're going to be talking to you straight ahead.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:30.480]  Please stay with us.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.480]  All right?
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:32.480]  Looking forward to it.
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:33.480]  All right.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:37.840]  He's got a better sky for this hotel and wherever he's at than he does at home.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:42.080]  So Roger Stone is like in the room with us just there over here, TV viewer, infowars.com,
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.080]  newswars.com.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.080]  Yeah, I just...
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:47.280]  I mean, I already hate mainstream media, but my God, you walk by any television.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.080]  It is just worship, worship, worship, worship.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:58.360]  That shriveled, demonic, horrible little corrupt piece of trash.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:59.360]  We knew it was coming.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.360]  The whole thing was for me, leg.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:06.600]  Just demonize infowars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:11.940]  to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:14.440]  children and Islamophobia.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:21.080]  And then, voila, two weeks later ban infowars completely off of dozens of major platforms
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:25.080]  where we were all in the top five or top 10 news feeds.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:31.320]  Go to infowars.com, 4-slash-show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link,
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.040]  whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:40.400]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com, 4-slash-newsletter, and give us your emails so that we can stay
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:44.840]  in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform, but whatever
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:50.520]  you do, tell folks about infowars.com, 4-slash-show, how they can download the free Android and
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:54.480]  iPhone apps, and how they can then reach out to others with the information and point
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:01.480]  out, this is the verboten info, this is what they don't want you to see.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:39.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're live on this Sunday edition, we have an hour left,
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:45.080]  Roger Stone's coming up in the last two segments of the huge breaking news, but Millie Weaver
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:50.520]  and Gavin Wentz, her husband, so Millie Wentz and Gavin Wentz are out on the road doing
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:56.360]  an amazing job covering Trump rallies at their events, but man, she posted like five videos
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:05.640]  this weekend that are on infowars.com that are powerful, and you see the beautiful, wonderful
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:15.440]  black Americans who are so articulate and so nice and so loving, and so on top of it,
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:20.880]  they're bucking the intimidation, bucking the bullying, and talking about how they love
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:27.080]  Trump, and man, one big victory the Democrats had was, the Tea Party was started by Ron
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:33.240]  Paul supporters when he ran for election in like 2004, because I remember I was there
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:39.400]  part of it, we would, you know, throw the deficit and stuff into the water in Austin
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:44.560]  in Boston, you name it, that was a thing against Republicans and Democrats, and then it scared
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.840]  Republicans so they tried to co-opt it, but instead the Liberty Movement took over the
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:51.080]  Republican Party instead as I predicted, and I was right about that, I don't know how
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:55.760]  I keep being right, but I am, and so now we're in insurrection taking over the Republican
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:06.720]  Party, but when you sit there and you pull back from this, it's just wild how the Democrats
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:15.080]  would say, the Tea Party's racist, if you're black or Hispanic or whatever, do not go to
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:18.400]  one, but then I sat there over the next few years and watched that fail and saw it go
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:25.160]  from 90% white to like 70% white till I've gone to Tea Party events in Texas and I've
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:32.280]  gone to the other rally we set up at the RNC, and man, I looked out on that crowd and it
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:39.840]  was half black and Hispanic and it was beautiful.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:46.040]  And they were all just amazing people and I, that scared the hell out of David Corn
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:50.920]  and the MSNBC that was there, they were just, I remember them like shaking their head looking
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:56.480]  at the crowd and going, pointing, only aim your cameras up there, do not show this, because
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:04.560]  man, they went and they saw that rally and it was half Hispanic and black.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.400]  Let's just say most of the crowd was brown, but their hearts were red-blooded, so I love
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:18.680]  them and it just absolutely freaked the daylight out of them.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.880]  They didn't know what to do.
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:26.480]  Now the black community loves Trump before he ran for office, he was the most quoted,
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:31.000]  most lauded person in hip hop and rap on BET, he was the favorite guy because everybody
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.320]  knew he opened the doors up to everybody 45 years ago, we took over golf courses that
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:39.400]  were white only, hardly those even existed, I'm like, but I guess I'm only 45, so back
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.160]  when I was being born, Trump was taking over failed golf courses, there's a bunch of old
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.280]  dead white people were dying, they didn't want anybody but their own little club there
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:54.600]  like Caddyshack, Judge Smales and so, I mean, black people who lived in New York or wherever,
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.400]  they loved Donald Trump because they know he was like throwing open the doors and if
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.320]  you were a good manager or a good business person, he'd put you in charge, if you were
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:07.440]  gay he'd put you in charge, he got all these awards for all that because he just cared
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:13.120]  about what you stood for and everybody knows that, that actually knows Trump and that's
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:21.160]  why the Democrats are so scared of him because the claim that he's a racist is ridiculous.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:24.920]  And so you see Millie Weaver go out there, the media always goes, oh look, there's the
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:28.920]  black for Trump's guy, well he loves Trump and whenever Trump has a rally he flies out
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:33.320]  there on his own dime, he's a Christian, he gets in that, but I go to the events, I go
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:41.280]  to him and now it's 20% black, well blacks are only 30% of the population, but the numbers
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:48.000]  are about 20%, that scares the hell out of the Democrats and guess what the polls show?
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.520]  23% of black Americans, it's like some titles say African American, I'm not a German American
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:57.360]  or a Welsh American, I'm American, and you call me white, I'm part of the American,
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.520]  it doesn't matter, okay, I'll call a couple of those black, black, white, it doesn't matter,
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:05.840]  the names don't matter, we're humans, you got 23% of blacks in major polls supporting
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:11.360]  Trump, same thing with Hispanics, it's a doubling number, well actually Hispanics were 30% there
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:16.920]  up in like 50% now, so that's even bigger, but people are getting the scam, yeah, a lie
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:20.600]  goes half way around the world before truth put its pants on to quote Mark Twain, but
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:26.480]  man, once you get the truth, it doesn't go back, so let's play this Millie Weaver report,
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:38.560]  there's a bunch of others on infowars.com, here it is.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:41.360]  Silicon Valley calls it information operation.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:46.440]  I tell you what make America great means to me, the fact that I can wake up every day
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:52.680]  of my life and if I choose to make the right decisions, I can be whatever I want to be
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:59.480]  in the greatest country in the world.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:05.600]  The president's here, it'd be cool if I could do some tricks for him, I support, I mean I'm
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:09.560]  still here, everybody's having a good time, so it's just, it's a good vibes.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:16.840]  I stand for all his policies, both religiously and politically, and I just think he's been
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:17.840]  doing a really great job.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:24.000]  I just want to see what I've never seen him and it's exciting.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  He's already done so much for the country and he's really doing a great job.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.760]  Have you guys been affected by any of the policies that he's enacted personally?
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:39.320]  I have, as far as abortion goes, that was one of my big issues, I very heavily stand
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:44.840]  for the unborn, and so his policies as far as that goes has really, really affected me.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:55.640]  I just like him, you know, I lived in New York back in the 70s when Trump was on his
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:02.120]  rise and I always had that operation for Trump and the things that he was doing in New York
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:07.960]  City back in the early and mid 70s, so when he became a candidate for president, I just
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.560]  still had a joy for him, you know.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:17.320]  I've got more friends in the unions now than I ever have before.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:23.960]  They are hiring at a rate that they don't have enough minorities to fill.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:24.960]  There's not enough of them.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.560]  These guys aren't going out and applying for these jobs.
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:30.520]  They're everywhere and they're begging for minorities.
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:37.200]  Wages are going up, the economy's thriving, jobs are being provided, I mean the guy creates
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:43.720]  minority jobs just by showing up, Trump still trump and now there's a motivator, a person
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:48.360]  that do things and a person that can get things done and nothing you can do or say about it
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.160]  can change, that's the whole way up.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.160]  So why do you like him?
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.160]  Huh?
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.160]  Because he speak his mind.
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:01.760]  He don't play around with it, you know what I mean, he goes to the point.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:05.920]  Do you think some of these other politicians are being fake a lot of times?
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:06.920]  Absolutely.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.920]  He is a great man for our country, I do believe so, yes, I do, I love Trump.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.920]  Go Trump!
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:15.920]  The hate is clearly over there, he's trying to get that scream out.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.920]  You can feel the vibes of hate coming from over there.
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:24.920]  You look over here and the people aren't screaming at this, the people aren't screaming.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:25.920]  Peace to protest.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.920]  This is not what peace to protest is all about.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.920]  This is what they think is acceptable.
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:33.920]  This is not what Trump stands for, but they don't understand it.
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.920]  Why are they mad for us believing what we believe and we're not mad at them for believing
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:37.920]  what they believe?
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.920]  I mean, I think it's all out here to get each other out of our skin and I love it.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.920]  It's out here for entertainment purposes for me.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.920]  They say because I'm black I should be over there.
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:49.920]  And I'm not black, I don't go by black, I go by two or more races.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.920]  What were they saying to you?
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:55.920]  They said something about a white girl or something, I don't remember.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.920]  I can't find the hate, I've been looking for hate all day.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.920]  Hate was over here with the protesters.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.920]  There's been no hate in the Trump crowd.
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.920]  I've got nothing but love all day.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:12.920]  So I don't understand where the racism or the hate or whatever they say about Trump.
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:15.920]  Trump's not a racist, he's an American businessman.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.920]  It's that simple.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:24.920]  The divide was created in the Obama administration and that wave has just been rolled by the media and that's it.
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:29.920]  Trump creates nothing but greatness.
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:33.920]  Conspiracy theories were first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.920]  Hi folks, we're going to go to break and come right back.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.920]  Roger Stone's coming out, I've got some other clips I want to play.
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:45.920]  But I want to also hit the globalist plan to bankrupt this country and how we stop them
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:48.920]  because we can see Trump's bringing oxygen back into the room.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:52.920]  But imagine if they were in control, what's their plan to demoralize you?
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.920]  America was never great, will never be great.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.920]  Remember what Cuomo said?
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:02.920]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have it in Fuller's life.
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:03.920]  It'd take hours.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.920]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:06.920]  It's stronger.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.920]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:11.920]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:12.920]  It's back in stock.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:15.920]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:19.920]  It's got the preglonone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:22.920]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:27.920]  So you can upload it, and our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:33.920]  silver and iodine 4 to 5 toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:34.920]  It's a spray you do.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:35.920]  You can also swallow it.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:40.920]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.920]  Without you, we couldn't do it.

[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:24.920]  Quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.920]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later,
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:35.920]  we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.920]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.920]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:49.920]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.920]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.

[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:29.920]  Alex Jones here back live.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.920]  You know, think about what the globalists would do if they had control of this country.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:37.920]  The Democrat Attorney General, who looks like the star of American Psycho, I should add.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:42.920]  I mean, he just looks like the archetypal devil meets a vampire and had babies.
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.920]  We'll put him up on screen for folks.
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:50.920]  He wants all illegals to have free healthcare and be able to vote.
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:52.920]  That's in the Associated Press.
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:55.920]  They say that all with a completely straight face.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:02.920]  You've got seven-plus billion people outside of this country, many of them living in total squalor.
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:08.920]  Then you advertise everything's free and you're racist if you don't give it out for free.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:13.920]  So let's go back to the video clip since we're on that subject.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:20.920]  And then I'll come back and give you the actual news articles on what's going on with that for you and your family.
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:22.920]  But just search engine.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:28.920]  Democrat Attorney General of California, give free healthcare to illegal aliens.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.920]  That's what they're talking about.
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.920]  That's what they've always been pushing.
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:37.920]  But remember, Obama said McCain tributes echoes criticism of Trump.
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:42.920]  President George W. Bush comments at John McCain's funeral demonizing.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.920]  This is the fraud of these people.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.920]  This is how they operate. This is what they believe.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:52.920]  Can you go to Mexico and get free healthcare?
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:58.920]  Can you go to Russia or China or no, but only in Europe or the U.S.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:04.920]  and they use the niceness of us to enslave us and they bring in these client groups to do it.
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.920]  California craziness.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:15.920]  Congress may have stopped state from giving free healthcare to illegal immigrants who they're bringing in to be their controlled clients.
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:19.920]  Democrat proposes government funded healthcare for illegal aliens.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:23.920]  That's the Attorney General Gavin Newsom.
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.920]  We have the video.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.920]  68% of voters, illegal immigration, major problem.
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.920]  Fed's not doing enough.
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:34.920]  It's a model where you're a world government corporate system.
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:38.920]  You bring in third world populations that will drive down wages, get rid of the middle class,
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:43.920]  and then keep them as a client group who will burn down cities if you don't submit.
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.920]  And so they're set to vote out globalism in Germany and Sweden.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:51.920]  Thousands of car fires, thousands of rapes, thousands of stabbings.
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.920]  And if you talk about it on Facebook, you're banned.
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:58.920]  That is 21st century warfare.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:02.920]  That is globalist control.
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:07.920]  And then Canada has a 280% tariff on all dairy.
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:11.920]  Cheese, milk, yogurt, billions of dollars.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.920]  Trump says, get rid of that.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:18.920]  And they say, oh my God, you're such a horrible person.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.920]  You hate Canada.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:24.920]  See, there's this, like we were just here to be raped and pissed on and all this.
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:26.920]  And then we go, no, no, no, no, no, China.
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.920]  You have a $900 billion deficit.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.920]  We want $200 billion cut off that.
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:32.920]  China goes FU.
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.920]  We go fine, $500 billion.
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.920]  FU, fine, $800 billion.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.920]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we need you.
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.920]  That's right, because you're dirtbag commies,
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:42.920]  your people don't even have running sewage.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:46.920]  You enslave them because you're a bunch of soulless, anti-Christian scum
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.920]  at the top, a bunch of commies.
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:51.920]  And you're not going to lecture us through Google and Facebook
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:55.920]  and Apple that have moved over there and are down on their knees
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.920]  giving you, you know what, we're done.
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:01.920]  We're done. We're the moral people.
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:03.920]  We believe in a human future.
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.920]  We're not trying to screw people over.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:08.920]  The Democratic Party and the Chai comms and the globalists, they are.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:11.920]  And they're the enemy.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:15.920]  Unbelievable garbage from these scum.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.920]  Now let me stop right there.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:19.920]  I don't own slave factories in China.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.920]  I didn't get a Pulitzer Prize for the New York Times.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.920]  Like their reporters did for line about WDs.
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:29.920]  Iraq to kill over a billion people, not against our troops going over there,
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:31.920]  they were ordered, but I'm against the lie to get us there
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:34.920]  to take out a non-radical and put in radicals for the Arab Spring coming
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.920]  and the invasion of Europe.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:39.920]  They had to get rid of the old CIA plan of Egypt and Iraq
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.920]  with stable leaders that the CIA put in under Eisenhower plans
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.920]  that took decades to take place
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:49.920]  and put it in with radicals to implode into Europe for the larger UN plan
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:53.920]  and all the rest of it.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:56.920]  So again, these people are monsters.
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:58.920]  They're the enemies of your prosperity.
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:02.920]  They admit they are and thank God for Trump and you, they've been forced out in the open.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:05.920]  But I didn't lie about WMDs and Iraq.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:08.920]  I'm not defending the Vatican, the giant pedophile rings.
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:11.920]  I'm not hurting the children like that with deadly vaccines
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:14.920]  from autism from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 58.
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:18.920]  That's why they say I hurt children by questioning public events that happen
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:20.920]  when they happen till we verify they happen
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:25.920]  because we were told babies, thousands had their brains bashed out to invade Iraq
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:30.920]  and it wasn't true. It was an actress. It was a PR firm. It was fake.
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.920]  So we have a right to question that.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:35.920]  I've never killed any children. I've never killed your children.
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.920]  I've not done the things they say I've done.
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:41.920]  They have the New York Times by their known lies.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:43.920]  But you see, they're after me.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:45.920]  They want to shut us down because they know you're listening
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.920]  and they know the military's listening
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:48.920]  and they know the police are listening
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.920]  and that's why it's so critical.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:54.920]  And I want to thank the listeners to understand that this is your fight.
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.920]  This isn't like some football game where you hope your team wins
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:57.920]  but if they lose, it's okay.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:01.920]  This is your second amendment, your private property.
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:04.920]  Your right to raise your children as you see fit
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.920]  and to be religious or not religious.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:11.920]  This is your true Renaissance egalitarianism.
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:13.920]  Info wars is the spirit of liberty.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.920]  The enemy hates it.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:21.920]  And so it's your choice to support the right to say what we're saying
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.920]  and what we're doing so we have a voice
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.920]  so the enemy can't shut us up, which is the real goal,
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:29.920]  and then say whatever they want about me
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.920]  once they can bankrupt me and put me in prison,
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:38.920]  which they have an Obama CIA stay-behind network in Congress funded.
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:41.920]  And you just like you thought Trump wouldn't go after Internet censorship
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:42.920]  and we pushed it and you pushed it.
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:43.920]  Now he's doing it.
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.920]  The president is now talking about how Obama put 3 billion
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:51.920]  into a CIA leftist group hiring the New York Times,
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.920]  the Washington Post through Bezos, CNN and MSNBC,
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:02.920]  CBS and ABC and NBC are all getting hundreds of millions a year
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:06.920]  to lie about Trump, to lie about Roger Stone, to lie about me
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:08.920]  and it's all in the documents.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:12.920]  See, the lawyers all know this.
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:16.920]  They're just scared to say it because if you cover it, they go after you.
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:20.920]  But let's put those zero-hedge articles back up on screen, please.
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:23.920]  Because if you want to know what will defeat the globalist,
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:26.920]  the so-called countering foreign propaganda act
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:32.920]  that Obama put in right before he left, that's the big criminal enchilada.
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.920]  That's the election meddling.
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:38.920]  But the American people let them brand us all as Russian agents
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.920]  like every Democrat's doing was losing
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:42.920]  because they know that we're awake to them.
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:45.920]  If we let them brand us as that, then it's our fault.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:50.920]  But if we rise up politically to these bills like HR 6393
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:56.920]  that passed Intelligence Authorization Act fiscal year 2017
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.920]  and the accompanying bill, it's over.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:02.920]  And I've been on the phone with the Pentagon.
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.920]  I've been on the phone with the Patriots.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:07.920]  I've been in, because you know, thank God the army in the 50s
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:10.920]  when they were trying to make us lose,
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:14.920]  when the CIA was trying to make us lose to North Korea and the Chinese,
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:20.920]  the army got pissed then and created to stay behind networks in America.
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:23.920]  And see, I'm not one of those stay-behind networks.
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:26.920]  I just come from the same cloth as those people.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:29.920]  And so I seamlessly merge right into it.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.920]  And yes, I'll just tell you, we are a stay-behind network for America.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.920]  It's the big secret.
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:37.920]  That's what we are, it's why they're after us.
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:39.920]  It's true.
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:42.920]  The stay-behind networks support me.
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:44.920]  I'm from a stay-behind network.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.920]  Most of my family was a stay-behind networks.
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.920]  That's why they hate me.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:49.920]  I'm an American.
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.920]  I'm a stay-behind network for America.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:53.920]  I'm fighting the Chinese globalist takeover.
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:29:06.920]  Roger Stone, straight ahead.
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:30.920]  I'm a stay-behind network for America.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:30:00.920]  I want to plow into all of this.
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:03.920]  That I'm going to spend a few minutes here first,

[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:53.920]  And they know we know who they are.

[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:19.920]  to our important work here to beat back the globalists
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:22.920]  and to destroy their campaign of censorship
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:48.920]  in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.920]  And with your help spreading it and with your help downloading it,
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:25.920]  we are unstoppable.
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:55.920]  Thank you.
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:03.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.920]  All right, so why am I so hated by Soros, the Nazi collaborator,
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:34.920]  by singing in, by Obama, by Hillary, they call me the dark heart.
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:36.920]  I'm not in any intelligence agency.
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:38.920]  I'm not in any part of that group.
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.920]  The John Birch Society, which I was never a member of.
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:44.920]  My dad gave speeches for him and stuff in high school.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:48.920]  I mean, just because he was an anti-communist.
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:53.920]  They knew that we turned China over to Mao in 49
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:56.920]  and killed John Birch, who was an army officer who tried to expose him.
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.920]  They torched him to death.
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:01.920]  And so when you say stay behind network, there were plans
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:05.920]  under Operation Gladia, which I don't defend what NATO did under that,
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.920]  where as the Soviets would take over Eastern Europe
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.920]  or try to take over Italy, you would leave stay behind networks
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:14.920]  that looked like they were working in regular jobs and media.
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:17.920]  In case the Soviets took over, you would then resist behind enemy lines.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:21.920]  So it's behind enemy lines resistance fighters
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:26.920]  carrying out total resistance operations using humet
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.920]  and using covert action.
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:33.920]  And so long before I read about covert action and stuff,
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:36.920]  I heard about how the Air Force aided the CIA
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:40.920]  and basically stand downs and not bashing the Air Force they were new
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:44.920]  in the turnover of North Korea to China.
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:47.920]  And that's when the army really began to get suspicious.
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:52.920]  The army's got its problems. The Navy's famously corrupt with politics,
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:55.920]  but the army still, George Washington, the whole line yards,
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.920]  it's still Americana.
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:59.920]  So the army the entire time has been fighting with the CIA.
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:01.920]  That's been the ongoing program.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.920]  And the CIA was created by Blue Bloods and Globalists,
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.920]  and it isn't all bad either.
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:08.920]  It's a large consortium.
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:11.920]  When I say I'm a stay behind network, you are.
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.920]  We believe in free market. We believe in the family.
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:15.920]  We believe in the Second Amendment.
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:19.920]  You are an agent of America, of George Washington, of Liberty,
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:23.920]  literally in a information war with them trying to intimidate you.
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:27.920]  And Obama set up these bills, the Counter Disinformation Act,
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:29.920]  and the Intelligence Authorization Act,
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:34.920]  which billions of dollars to mainstream media to be the watchdogs
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:38.920]  with big tech, and it says to shut down alternative media,
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:44.920]  then they had hearings just saying that Breitbart and Info Wars are Russians.
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:46.920]  With no proof.
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:48.920]  Obviously we're not Russians.
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:52.920]  We are the red-blooded Americans.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.920]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:56.920]  My family worked to bring down the Soviet Union.
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:58.920]  You name it, worked in Latin America, all of it.
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:03.920]  No, we, though, Trump and Alex Jones and Roger Stone say what we want about us.
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:07.920]  We're not perfect, but let me tell you, we are red, white, and blue, baby,
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:10.920]  and they know that we are USA.
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.920]  So, Roger, you're going to host these to say, which will be back with me tomorrow,
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:18.920]  big breaking news, but you were bringing up some really huge news to me during the break
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:22.920]  that, before we get into the whole fake Russiagate thing and all the rest of the persecution,
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:26.920]  that Kudlow, well, I don't want to get it, I don't know how much we can say on air.
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.920]  I know your friends with him and had dinner with him.
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.920]  Kudlow, you know, there's big work.
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.920]  I've had law firms send stuff to Trump.
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:33.920]  It's gotten to him.
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.920]  Trump's now moving, saying, we're a free country.
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.920]  You can't censor the Internet ahead of an election.
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:44.920]  The violation of campaign finance law, the head of Google will not even appear to Congress.
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:48.920]  We ought to really be celebrating that the listeners of this broadcast and you and I,
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:53.920]  and this crew, who puts up with a lot, our great crew, praise God, Jesus Christ, I'm serious.
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:59.920]  We've already now got them in our sights of Trump's action, so give us the latest on that, my friend.
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:03.920]  Yeah, you know, I must say, Alex, I think Larry Kudlow, who, as you know,
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:08.920]  was one of the architects of the great Ronald Reagan economic surge,
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:13.920]  then went on to see NBC with a very successful economic show,
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:19.920]  economic analysis and market analysis show, may be one of the president's single best appointments.
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:22.920]  He is the apostle of economic growth.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:26.920]  He is the man who not only working with Steve Moore,
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:31.920]  another great pro-growth, pro-supply side economist at the Heritage Foundation,
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:36.920]  but he's also helped candidate Donald Trump formulate the most dynamic economic growth program
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:40.920]  and tax program of any of the Republican candidates.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:43.920]  But Kudlow is more than just a thinker.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:48.920]  He is now at the right hand of the president helping administer that program,
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:52.920]  which has created 3.2 million new jobs.
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:56.920]  Hey, Barry, those jobs, they did come back.
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:03.920]  It is extraordinary now that Kudlow has immersed himself in the internet censorship issue.
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:08.920]  It was Larry Kudlow announced last week that the administration was going to be taking a hard look
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:16.920]  at the antitrust aspects of the anti-monopolistic practices of these internet giants
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:23.920]  to crush info wars, to crush conservative and libertarian commentary across the board.
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:27.920]  In my view, Larry Kudlow is a true American hero,
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:31.920]  and he's doing a hell of a job for President Donald Trump.
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:34.920]  I agree. Antitrust may take too long, though.
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:36.920]  They're 65 days out. They're meddling with the election.
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:40.920]  They've lied to Congress, a lot of their deputy heads in these hearings.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:42.920]  They've now been caught lying.
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.920]  And you've also got the Federal Elections Commission meddling.
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.920]  Those are serious federal charges.
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:51.920]  Every time they ban a major congressperson or their campaign or their constituents,
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:58.920]  in-kind donations, we need a quadratic equation to create the number for that amount of money.
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:03.920]  It's in the billions and start federal indictments of the heads of the big tech companies.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:05.920]  I could not agree more.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:12.920]  The attempt to limit conservative and Republican candidates in their election nearing advertising
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:16.920]  on the internet has turned out to be an egregious error by the tech left.
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:19.920]  It's opened a whole new front for us to attack.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:27.920]  Now, as you know, Alex, the courts have generally dismissed all of the first amendment-oriented lawsuits against
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:28.920]  the Twitterer.
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:31.920]  But now it's going to be Federal Elections Commission, and it's going to be Section 2 Antitrust Act.
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:35.920]  Yes, and I think that is where their greatest vulnerability lies.
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:39.920]  Look, the Congress, in the hands of Republicans, with a Republican president,
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:42.920]  and I'm never for regulation, but in this case, it may have to be.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:46.920]  Because the lack of regulation allows all their takeover to happen.
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:50.920]  We have to have regulations saying, leave it alone, but we're not trying to hit our horn here,
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:51.920]  but the listeners have to know.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:52.920]  We are the ones.
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:55.920]  This audience, we push this over the top.
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:58.920]  I mean, this is a devastating victory.
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:39:59.920]  There's no question.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:04.920]  Had they not targeted Alex Jones, had they not targeted Info Wars,
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:06.920]  the president would not be pushing back today.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:10.920]  Their insidious little plan would have succeeded.
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:15.920]  But because they overreached in their attempts to strangle us right here at Info Wars,
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:19.920]  you have a president who totally gets it, and who is intent on not...
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.920]  Let me ask this question, because they already shadowed bad millions like you,
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.920]  totally ban you on Twitter.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:27.920]  Why was it Info Wars being banned that finally made the president move?
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:31.920]  You know, I think it's because, Alex, we didn't take the ban laying down.
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:35.920]  We didn't claim, you know, we didn't just go quietly,
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:41.920]  because we raised holy hell across the media platforms that were available to us.
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.920]  I don't need to tell you what happened. Record number of people going to the Info Wars.com site.
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:49.920]  Record number of people listening to you on terrestrial radio.
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.920]  Record number of people signing up for the podcast.
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:55.920]  Record number of new stations, hundreds.
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:58.920]  Taking down the app.
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:00.920]  So, you know how this is.
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:04.920]  The American people always want what you tell them they cannot have.
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:06.920]  And therefore, people who are ambivalent about how...
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:11.920]  So, I ask this question again. Why the hell did they make such a brazen authoritarian move,
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:16.920]  and why would the head of Google refuse to go to Congress?
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.920]  Because you piss them off.
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.920]  Because you won't lay down.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.920]  Because you won't...
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:27.920]  Because you, Alex, and I think about all of our colleagues here,
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.920]  we just keep hammering them and exposing them.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:34.920]  This is why they are so intent on silencing you.
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.920]  You're the tip of the spear.
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:38.920]  And we know the plan here was insidious.
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:41.920]  If we get Alex Jones showing Hannity's next,
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:44.920]  and then Tucker Carlson, and then Rush Limbaugh,
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:47.920]  and then Mike Savage, and then Mark Simone,
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:49.920]  and so many other great patriots,
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:53.920]  and their whole plan is now exposed. They're in retreat.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:58.920]  The head of Google refuses to show up in Congress because he knows what's going to happen when he does.
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:00.920]  Now you've got all these top Democrats saying,
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:05.920]  hey, Trump, stop Sensory Conservatives, stop Panetta, all the smart guys,
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.920]  the wise men are saying back off, I don't want to be too positive,
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:12.920]  but I think we really, by not backing down, Roger,
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.920]  because I was in War Council a month and a half ago with my family,
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:18.920]  and I said, I'm going to do this, my family said, go ahead, we trust you,
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:23.920]  but we did this consciously, my friend.
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:25.920]  There's no question.
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:28.920]  Let me also, Alex, say something, I want to address something you said early on.
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:31.920]  Like you, I was never a member of the John Birch Society,
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:37.920]  but there are many, many good people in the John Birch Society, anti-communist, real patriotic Americans.
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:41.920]  I always liked your father, Dr. Jones, and now I really know why.
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:46.920]  It is extraordinary, and right now, somewhere, David Brock's head is exploding.
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:50.920]  Oh my God, Roger Stone said something nice about the John Birch Society.
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:53.920]  Well, the John Birch Society, which is not the power it once was,
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:56.920]  has many, many good people, and it's even today.
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:00.920]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:03.920]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters,
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:07.920]  but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:00.920]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine,
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:02.920]  introducing pollen block.
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:07.920]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:11.920]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:14.920]  eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:19.920]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:23.920]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:26.920]  They began studying this effect in published trials,
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:29.920]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:34.920]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:37.920]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:39.920]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:44.920]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:49.920]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:52.920]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:57.920]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:01.920]  We're bringing back one of the biggest fan-favorite formulas we've ever offered,

[01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:00.920]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:06.920]  Live
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:11.920]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:26.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:29.920]  Hi, Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign,
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:32.920]  been involved in like six, seven presidential campaigns.
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:36.920]  He is in Delaware at the beach with his family, taking a few days off.
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:40.920]  I know two weeks ago he was meeting with Cutlow, he goes out in New York.
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:43.920]  He gets bobbed, attacked by like a zombie apocalypse.
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:46.920]  Now, this morning, he's at lunch.
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:49.920]  I've induced him to tell the story, and some guy attacks him,
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:51.920]  so he knocks him out in the jaw.
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:53.920]  That's where we've gotten.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:59.920]  Plus, the Democrats are moving with major impeachment operations against the president.
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:04.920]  So, we'll probably tomorrow tell the whole, you know, villagers with torches in New York story.
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:08.920]  But right now, let's get into their move to impeach Trump.
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:10.920]  Why they're insane?
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.920]  But first, let's get into what happened.
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:16.920]  We don't want to say where you are, but you're in Delaware having breakfast this morning.
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:19.920]  Yeah, I was with my family, Alex, and, you know,
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:25.920]  minding my own business, engaged in reading newspaper and drinking a triple espresso,
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:29.920]  which is my custom, and some guy out of nowhere comes up to the table
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:32.920]  and starts screaming that I'm a Russian trader that I'll dry in prison.
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:35.920]  And I just say to the guy, look, get lost.
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:38.920]  That's when he made the mistake of shoving me.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:40.920]  Now, Alex, I hit the heavy bag every Sunday.
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:42.920]  I have for almost 20 years.
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:47.920]  Yes, I could knock you out with one punch, and I smacked this guy in the jaw,
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:49.920]  but he started the violence.
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.920]  You see, I'm not going to be pushed around.
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:53.920]  I'm not going to be bullied.
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:55.920]  I'm never going to start the violence.
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:56.920]  I don't believe in violence.
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:00.920]  I'm like Dr. King, but I will stand up for myself and my rights.
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:03.920]  You're not going to attack me with my family sitting there.
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:05.920]  That's not going to happen.
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:06.920]  This is where we've gotten to.
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:08.920]  So tell us what happened.
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:11.920]  What happened once you, because they'll probably ban this on Twitter saying
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:14.920]  fighting back against some guy attacking is wrong.
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:19.920]  So again, he ran like the yellow coward that he was.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:22.920]  The proprietor in this diner called the police,
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:26.920]  but by the time they arrived, there was nothing to do.
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:28.920]  He was long gone.
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:31.920]  Look, I'm not trying to make myself sound like a superhero.
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:33.920]  No, no, no. We are hunted men.
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:35.920]  When I go on the street with you in Austin, it happens to me too.
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:39.920]  They go, F you Russian, you're F your family.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.920]  And I'm like, dude, I'm not a Russian.
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:43.920]  The economy is at 4.6.
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:46.920]  We're rebuilding the military.
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:48.920]  It's the left that hates America.
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:50.920]  It's Cuomo saying America was never great.
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:52.920]  It will never be great.
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:54.920]  Or that ice are a bunch of thugs.
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:58.920]  Not understanding it's the people there are resting that are the thugs.
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:03.920]  So this is extraordinary, but it's where we have gotten in the country
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:10.920]  where you cannot even dinner in peace or roam the streets with your family
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:14.920]  trying to enjoy a vacation where you're attacked by some libtard.
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:18.920]  Let me be as clear as we possibly can.
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:21.920]  I wear the scorn of these liberals like a badge.
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:24.920]  The more they hate me, the more I love it.
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:29.920]  So what did he do when he attacked you and he just ran?
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:30.920]  He pushed me.
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:31.920]  I spun around.
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:33.920]  I smacked him kind of square on the jaw.
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:34.920]  He was dazed.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:38.920]  Then I think he realized he was overmatched and he ran like hell.
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:40.920]  It's after stumbling backwards.
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:43.920]  Look, I'm not telling this story to try to sound like a tough guy.
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:45.920]  Believe me, you've been with me.
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:48.920]  You've seen when they come over to the table and go F you Russians.
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:50.920]  You're the worst people in America.
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:52.920]  And I'm like, I am America.
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:55.920]  I mean, the left hates America.
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:56.920]  They're globalist.
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:58.920]  They hate flower country.
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:01.920]  But how do they believe this narrative that we're the enemy?
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:02.920]  It's crazy.
[01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:07.920]  Well, because you have CNN just recycling it over and over and over again.
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:09.920]  Look, I'm a proud Italian American.
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:11.920]  You're not taking a swing at me and walking away.
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:12.920]  You're just not.
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:14.920]  I will stand up and defend myself.
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:20.920]  No, I will never start the violence, but I will not be attacked in the streets
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:22.920]  by thought. Exactly.
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:24.920]  Let's expand to your your Trump impeachment news.
[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:25.920]  You're doing the break.
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:27.920]  We're telling me some really important stuff.
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:31.920]  Yeah, I mean, you have some really extraordinary developments over the last couple days.
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:36.920]  First of all, the revelation that Bruce or a Justice Department official under Barack Obama
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:43.920]  was keeping Andrew Weissman, the pit bull attack prosecutor for Robert Mueller,
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:48.920]  a prize of the progress in the compot compilation of the dirty dossier.
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:54.920]  It means that Weissman has violated the Department of Justice rules regarding the independence
[01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:56.920]  of the special counsel's office.
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.920]  Donald Trump, are you awake?
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:00.920]  Are you hearing this?
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:02.920]  This is extraordinary news.
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:04.920]  They've committed all these process crimes.
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:07.920]  They're all a bunch of globalist agents.
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:08.920]  Exactly.
[01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:10.920]  So you're mad at Trump.
[01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:11.920]  He should be.
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:12.920]  He's saying he's not going to fire sessions.
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:17.920]  Reportedly, we don't know if it's true until after the midterms, even though the Senate
[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:20.920]  has signaled for him to fire him.
[01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:25.920]  Well, and if you watch the CNN narrative of Republicans fear if they move, they'll lose
[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:26.920]  the midterm elections.
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:29.920]  No, make the midterms elections about your action.
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:32.920]  Go to the American people in an Oval Office address.
[01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:38.920]  By the way, we would win 20 seats in the house if he swat teamed Google, if he swat teamed
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:39.920]  the DNC.
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:42.920]  I mean, people would be in ecstasy.
[01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:48.920]  But he has never, Alex, gone to the American people in an Oval Office address, not once.
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:49.920]  No, I agree.
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:51.920]  He should go to an address about the traders.
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:53.920]  You've seen the economy come back.
[01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:56.920]  In fact, advise the president right now as we go to break.
[01:52:56.920 --> 01:53:01.920]  What would you say in three, four or five minutes if you were President Trump addressing
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.920]  the American, oh my God, that's why they fear him.
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:04.920]  He hasn't used the power.
[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:06.920]  He thought he'd bring the economy back.
[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:07.920]  They back off.
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:08.920]  No, the elites don't want more money.
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:11.920]  They want America by the short hairs.
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:13.920]  Roger, what would you tell the president to do?
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:17.920]  I agree on that Oval Office address.
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:21.920]  Announce that you are taking a series of actions.
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:27.920]  Step one, he classified all the documents regarding the FISA warrants and the illegal
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:30.920]  spying and surveillance on Donald Trump's campaign for president.
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:39.920]  Step two, the president should fire Jeff Sessions, fire Rod Rosenstein and fires deep in his
[01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:45.520]  Justice Department as he has to, at the same time, announcing that he has ordered an investigation
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:52.920]  into their activities, including the activities of Bruce Orr, who never disclosed that he,
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:58.600]  that his wife was getting campaign funds from the Clintons.
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:06.520]  Find out why Judge Rudy Contreras recused himself in the FISA warrant that was put on
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:07.520]  Carter Page.
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:09.520]  The president needs to lay out the facts here.
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:14.680]  And let's be clear, if he did an Oval Office request, an Oval Office speech, laying out
[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:17.000]  the facts, we'd turn the economy back on.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.840]  They're in bed with the Russians and the Chinese.
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:20.280]  I believe in you.
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:21.280]  They're trying to attack you.
[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:25.520]  They've got CIA stay behind networks, trying to overthrow the government, trying to stop
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:26.800]  the recovery.
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:28.440]  I'm fighting for you.
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:34.080]  He needs to do the Oval Office address and just be honest and say, I'm taking these actions.
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:35.320]  I believe it's a referendum.
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:36.520]  I believe in you.
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:37.640]  You want to be great again.
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:38.640]  I'm doing it.
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:39.640]  I'm doing it.
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:40.640]  It would be over.
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:43.920]  That's why they're so scared, because if he ever exercises real power, it's over.
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:48.240]  Well, he also ought to hit Robert Mueller's greatest hits.
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:53.120]  An incredible front page story in The New York Times last Sunday by Matt Appuzzo would
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:58.120]  have you believe that this unblemished career is that of the second coming of Christ.
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:00.520]  President knows Robert Mueller's real record.
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:02.680]  He knows the cover-up of 9-11.
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:05.200]  He's well aware of the cover-up of BCCI.
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:09.000]  He's well aware of the cover-up of what happened in Lockerbie Flight 103.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.240]  He knows the real story of the anthrax investigation.
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:13.720]  He knows the real story.
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:16.040]  Covering up for the Clintons.
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:17.040]  Right.
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:18.040]  One.
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:21.720]  The president needs to lay that out, because The New York Times is not going to do it.
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:23.720]  The Washington Post is not going to do it.
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:25.640]  Mainstream media is not going to do it.
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:27.960]  Even Fox News is not going to do it.
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:33.360]  Only we here at Info Wars have the courage and the fortitude to lay these things out.
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:34.560]  But the president knows them.
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:38.960]  You know this, Alex, because you've heard it from intimates of the president yourself.
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:43.840]  It's time for the American people to know the real Robert Mueller and what his real motives
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:44.840]  are.
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:48.680]  Interestingly enough, CNN has a headlight up saying, criticizing the president for saying
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:51.560]  in a tweet that Mueller's investigation is illegal.
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:52.840]  They say that's not right.
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:58.320]  Well, it has not been declared illegal yet, but it will be, because no one has brought
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:01.120]  the correct lawsuit yet, but they will.
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:04.240]  Well, Roger, let's point this out in closing.
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:05.360]  America's coming back.
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:06.520]  The globalists are the enemy.
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:07.680]  They admit they hate America.
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:08.680]  It was never great.
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:09.680]  Never be great.
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:14.040]  They, Democrats, applause, even if they get you and I and the Trump, they're never going
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:15.040]  to win.
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:19.560]  Don't they look five, six moves ahead and realize they never get out of this?
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:20.560]  They're done.
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:22.200]  We've already won.
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:26.760]  But the question is, how bad will it get before they realize that these people don't
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:28.720]  know when to give up?
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:31.720]  That's because they're used to having their way for the last 30 years.
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:36.440]  That's because the Bush-Clinton Combine has called the tune for the last 40 years.
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:37.800]  What have we gotten from it?
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:41.360]  The decline of America, endless foreign war without our national interest.
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:45.320]  But you look at the people worshiping McCain, it looks like a mummy convention.
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:46.320]  I agree.
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:47.560]  These people are the past.
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:48.560]  They're done.
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:49.560]  We're winning.
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:50.560]  Roger, come to town.
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:51.560]  Host with us for four or five days.
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:53.640]  Live in studio during the weekday broadcast.

[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:04.800]  Alex, victory or death?
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:07.320]  I love quoting Colonel Travis.
[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:13.520]  All right, now, I was at this church stand and I had this special operations guy.
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:15.800]  He was a great guy going, I'm a fifth generation Texan.
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:19.840]  It just made me so proud to be an eighth or ninth and actually found the state.
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:24.600]  It's not like a bragging thing, it's just like, well, I am Texas Royalty, so that's
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:26.000]  just the way it is.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.880]  And I'm proud that today we're having a big effect.
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:30.880]  And so are you.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:32.320]  Do you come from or what you do?
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:33.320]  I love you.
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:34.320]  You love liberty.
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:35.320]  Black, white, old, young.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:36.320]  I love you.
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:37.320]  All right.
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:38.320]  God bless you all.
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:39.320]  That's it for this live transmission.
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:40.320]  Big day.
