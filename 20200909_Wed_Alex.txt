[00:00.000 --> 00:29.700]  I'm watching the midterms.
[00:29.700 --> 00:33.700]  Then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:33.700 --> 00:37.700]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:37.700 --> 00:43.700]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:43.700 --> 01:04.700]  You're going to drop! You're going to drop!
[01:04.700 --> 01:31.700]  And then you would think everybody in the countries is like to the bunker.
[01:31.700 --> 01:35.700]  Fifty-four days out. It's Wednesday, September 9th of the year. It's 2020. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:35.700 --> 01:37.700]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:37.700 --> 01:39.700]  Remember the prerequisite, however you're listening.
[01:39.700 --> 01:43.700]  Spread those links. Tell folks to tune in on the local stations.
[01:43.700 --> 01:46.700]  That's how we override the censors. You've been doing a great job.
[01:46.700 --> 01:50.700]  So I commend you and thank you all for your own preservation in mind and my family.
[01:50.700 --> 01:51.700]  Again, I salute you.
[01:51.700 --> 01:57.700]  All right. We fall out in the open. You got a good man as president.
[01:57.700 --> 02:03.700]  He's been nominated for the Peace Prize for getting the United Arab Emirates-Israeli deal.
[02:03.700 --> 02:10.700]  Of course, pulling trips out of Iraq, out of Afghanistan, out of Syria, almost completely out of all three of those places.
[02:10.700 --> 02:19.700]  As promised to do, got the big deal also between Serbia and Bosnia.
[02:19.700 --> 02:23.700]  And so you probably won't win the Peace Prize because you only get it if you're a war criminal now,
[02:23.700 --> 02:28.700]  Morocco's Shane Obama who got it and then started the biggest wars ever.
[02:28.700 --> 02:37.700]  In front of the Arab Spring that overthrew our allies and put radical jihadis into power.
[02:37.700 --> 02:39.700]  Simply amazing and Trump is now hitting on all cylinders.
[02:39.700 --> 02:41.700]  That's why they're having big problems.
[02:41.700 --> 02:44.700]  Why he's surging in the internal polls, not just the public polls.
[02:44.700 --> 02:48.700]  He's way ahead of Biden, probably 10 points, 15 points or more.
[02:48.700 --> 02:54.700]  He probably got half of black Americans supporting him, 60% of Hispanic Americans supporting him.
[02:54.700 --> 02:57.700]  This is an absolute awakening right now.
[02:57.700 --> 03:00.700]  It's beautiful, which means they'll probably try to kill him or do worse,
[03:00.700 --> 03:04.700]  which they're now announcing just incredible revolution and operations.
[03:04.700 --> 03:15.700]  But if you make this about America versus China, an American system versus communist system, which is what it is,
[03:15.700 --> 03:19.700]  then we win and Americans are finally clicking and getting that.
[03:19.700 --> 03:24.700]  And Trump was talking about it yesterday.
[03:24.700 --> 03:27.700]  I remember if Biden wins, China wins.
[03:27.700 --> 03:32.700]  It's as simple as that.
[03:32.700 --> 03:41.700]  So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.
[03:41.700 --> 03:48.700]  We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in.
[03:48.700 --> 03:50.700]  And now we've opened it.
[03:50.700 --> 03:52.700]  And by the way, your state should be open.
[03:52.700 --> 03:58.700]  Your state should be open.
[03:58.700 --> 04:00.700]  You ought to vote for Dan Forest.
[04:00.700 --> 04:09.700]  Any governor that does that, and even if you look statistically, it's you, it's Michigan, it's a couple of others.
[04:09.700 --> 04:11.700]  They're closed.
[04:11.700 --> 04:13.700]  New York, look what they're doing in New York.
[04:13.700 --> 04:16.700]  What they're doing to our beautiful New York.
[04:16.700 --> 04:18.700]  Oh, it's so sad.
[04:18.700 --> 04:22.700]  But you just take a look at what's going on in North Carolina.
[04:22.700 --> 04:23.700]  They want to open.
[04:23.700 --> 04:24.700]  They want to open.
[04:24.700 --> 04:28.700]  They want to open in Michigan so badly.
[04:28.700 --> 04:29.700]  They want to open.
[04:29.700 --> 04:30.700]  They want to have football.
[04:30.700 --> 04:32.700]  They want to have their schools open.
[04:32.700 --> 04:34.700]  And it's a shame what's going on.
[04:34.700 --> 04:39.700]  And I'll tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open.
[04:39.700 --> 04:42.700]  They're doing it for political reasons.
[04:42.700 --> 04:44.700]  Trump is attacking the enemy head on.
[04:44.700 --> 04:45.700]  And it is beautiful.
[04:45.700 --> 04:47.700]  And their new world order will never recover.
[04:47.700 --> 04:48.700]  It's going to be a long, hard fight.
[04:48.700 --> 04:49.700]  This is just a major battle.
[04:49.700 --> 04:52.700]  But, wow, they're going to really pull out the stops now.
[04:52.700 --> 04:53.700]  This is economic warfare.
[04:53.700 --> 04:54.700]  It's you and your family.
[04:54.700 --> 04:58.700]  We'll be right back.
[04:58.700 --> 05:05.700]  The mask is more than just a symbol of subservience being a blind follower, not knowing facts and science.
[05:05.700 --> 05:08.700]  It's a symbol that you have been turned into a subhuman.
[05:08.700 --> 05:10.700]  And they tell you, you are non-essential.
[05:10.700 --> 05:12.700]  Remember, first they said, no more industry.
[05:12.700 --> 05:13.700]  You'll be a service economy.
[05:13.700 --> 05:15.700]  And now they tell you, service is non-essential.
[05:15.700 --> 05:18.700]  This has been the post-industrial world plan the whole time.
[05:18.700 --> 05:27.700]  And Operation Long Step and other documents, the Rockefeller Foundation admits that this is how they're going to slowly teach you to be totally poor.
[05:27.700 --> 05:33.700]  And under their control, you can finally be starved to death of nutrients and then killed with very, very weak bio weapons.
[05:33.700 --> 05:37.700]  It won't affect anyone that actually gets their RDA of vitamins and minerals.
[05:37.700 --> 05:39.700]  And so that's the plan for you and your family.
[05:39.700 --> 05:42.700]  Now that you're tuning to this broadcast, you check this out for yourself.
[05:42.700 --> 05:43.700]  You know it's true.
[05:43.700 --> 05:45.700]  So let's start warning the sheep.
[05:45.700 --> 05:47.700]  Let's start educating them now.
[05:47.700 --> 05:50.700]  I just went and swam at the lake.
[05:50.700 --> 05:53.700]  And I walked around for 20 minutes educating people after getting out of the water.
[05:53.700 --> 05:54.700]  It's that simple.
[05:54.700 --> 05:57.700]  You must take action now or be slaves forever this life and death.
[06:24.700 --> 06:36.700]  I just want to thank you all for tuning in to this broadcast that the enemy works around the clock trying to keep off the air.
[06:36.700 --> 06:43.700]  Thanks to you, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the air and standing strong.
[06:43.700 --> 06:49.700]  And boy, have we been proven right about everything.
[06:49.700 --> 06:56.700]  And I have hundreds and hundreds of articles and video clips to cover and big guests and everything else you can imagine in your calls.
[06:56.700 --> 06:59.700]  But I'm just going to say this again up front, because this is the most important thing we can say.
[06:59.700 --> 07:01.700]  The globalists are not in control.
[07:01.700 --> 07:05.700]  God is in control.
[07:05.700 --> 07:12.700]  And everything they do is to act like they're in total control and try to build a panopticonic AI control grid.
[07:12.700 --> 07:20.700]  But the only way that grid has power over us is if we give up our authority and give up our power that God gave us to them.
[07:20.700 --> 07:23.700]  It's the only prayer in hell our enemies have.
[07:23.700 --> 07:27.700]  And I'll say this again.
[07:27.700 --> 07:30.700]  I did not predict any of this.
[07:30.700 --> 07:36.700]  If you think you have to have a crystal ball to defeat the globalist, you just don't get it.
[07:36.700 --> 07:39.700]  And the reason I say that is I get stopped on the street every time I'm out.
[07:39.700 --> 07:42.700]  And people go marble. They go, how did you know all of this would come true?
[07:42.700 --> 07:44.700]  I watched your film in game just the other day.
[07:44.700 --> 07:48.700]  And you predicted bio weapons and lockdowns and drones controlling us.
[07:48.700 --> 07:50.700]  And you made that 13 years ago.
[07:50.700 --> 07:54.700]  How do you do it? You're like a prophet.
[07:54.700 --> 07:59.700]  And I go, no, the enemies very arrogant and has admitted all of this.
[07:59.700 --> 08:03.700]  Didn't you notice in the film I showed you where they were saying it?
[08:03.700 --> 08:05.700]  But still, how did you know?
[08:05.700 --> 08:09.700]  So there's something about this when they tell you they're going to do all this,
[08:09.700 --> 08:13.700]  like an architect and a company buys land, they say they're going to build this.
[08:13.700 --> 08:15.700]  And then two years later, there's this big giant building.
[08:15.700 --> 08:19.700]  You're like, how did you know that the building would be there?
[08:19.700 --> 08:22.700]  They bought the land, they got the loan, they got the engineers.
[08:22.700 --> 08:25.700]  They went in, they built the damn thing.
[08:25.700 --> 08:28.700]  We have the Death Star plans.
[08:28.700 --> 08:30.700]  We have the enemies operation.
[08:30.700 --> 08:35.700]  And it's a lot easier hypothetically to destroy than the Death Star.
[08:35.700 --> 08:42.700]  You don't have to shoot a torpedo down a chimney.
[08:42.700 --> 08:45.700]  Down an exhaust port.
[08:45.700 --> 08:51.700]  All you've got to do is admit it's evil, admit it's out to get you and reject it.
[08:51.700 --> 08:54.700]  And I got up at like 4 a.m. this morning.
[08:54.700 --> 08:56.700]  I couldn't sleep.
[08:56.700 --> 09:00.700]  And for some reason, Sky Television out of Australia came up with my feet.
[09:00.700 --> 09:02.700]  And I found this guy named Alan Jones.
[09:02.700 --> 09:04.700]  I want to play some clips of later, but I'm just telling you about him.
[09:04.700 --> 09:05.700]  You don't know who he is.
[09:05.700 --> 09:09.700]  And I watched like an hour and a half of his reports.
[09:09.700 --> 09:13.700]  And the guy is knocking it out of the park.
[09:13.700 --> 09:15.700]  And he's a big talk show host over there.
[09:15.700 --> 09:19.700]  I mean, I'd heard of who he was, big TV analyst.
[09:19.700 --> 09:23.700]  But he just destroys the whole COVID deal, how it's a power grab, how it's communism,
[09:23.700 --> 09:27.700]  how it's UN and Chinese run, how it's a New World Order,
[09:27.700 --> 09:36.700]  how they're coming in to take over everything, how only 77 people died in Australia of COVID.
[09:36.700 --> 09:39.700]  But how they put out fake numbers and it's all there.
[09:39.700 --> 09:41.700]  And of course, I know all that's true.
[09:41.700 --> 09:46.700]  I look at the numbers, but just to see it on national TV, when it came to COVID,
[09:46.700 --> 09:48.700]  he's doing a better job than Tucker Carlson.
[09:48.700 --> 09:49.700]  That's not a criticism of Tucker.
[09:49.700 --> 09:53.700]  It's just this guy knocked it out of the park.
[09:53.700 --> 09:56.700]  And he just explained that this is about them running your lives.
[09:56.700 --> 10:01.700]  And if they can dictate what you can do medically and they can dictate that you're locked in your house
[10:01.700 --> 10:06.700]  and they can dictate what you got aware of your face and that they can arrest the press and control the media,
[10:06.700 --> 10:10.700]  then we're living in communist China.
[10:10.700 --> 10:17.700]  And then he goes in and these reports to how the leftist mayors like in Melbourne signed a treaty with the Chinese.
[10:17.700 --> 10:19.700]  I forgot that.
[10:19.700 --> 10:23.700]  Putting their city under Chinese control outside the government.
[10:23.700 --> 10:28.700]  And so that leads me to the next bomb shell information.
[10:28.700 --> 10:34.700]  Because if we don't shoot down this COVID scam, you know, people call it a hoax and that gets the truth across it.
[10:34.700 --> 10:37.700]  Overall, it's a hoax, but it is a real virus.
[10:37.700 --> 10:38.700]  It's manmade.
[10:38.700 --> 10:39.700]  It spreads really easily.
[10:39.700 --> 10:42.700]  If you have vitamin and mineral deficiencies, it'll kill you deader than a hammer.
[10:42.700 --> 10:44.700]  And they don't want you to know that.
[10:44.700 --> 10:48.700]  But there's any virus will kill you if you don't have enough of those key nutrients.
[10:48.700 --> 10:52.700]  That's why they're called essential.
[10:52.700 --> 10:53.700]  It's a scam.
[10:53.700 --> 10:55.700]  It's the COVID scam.
[10:55.700 --> 10:58.700]  It's the COVID conspiracy.
[10:58.700 --> 11:04.700]  It's a big organized operation with the UN and the big pharma and the big banks and all the leftist groups,
[11:04.700 --> 11:10.700]  the leftist cities, the leftist states, the leftist countries, all the organizations.
[11:10.700 --> 11:19.700]  And every group in the New World Order gets to manage that angle of COVID and consolidate power and control for themselves.
[11:19.700 --> 11:22.700]  All the Silicon Valley is making record profits.
[11:22.700 --> 11:24.700]  Bezos has doubled his wealth under this.
[11:24.700 --> 11:25.700]  It's destroying mom and pops.
[11:25.700 --> 11:27.700]  It's doing what Walmart could ever do.
[11:27.700 --> 11:30.700]  It is annihilating small businesses.
[11:30.700 --> 11:32.700]  It is putting everybody on the dole.
[11:32.700 --> 11:33.700]  It is domesticating us.
[11:33.700 --> 11:35.700]  It's bringing in the AI spy grid.
[11:35.700 --> 11:36.700]  It's getting rid of the cash.
[11:36.700 --> 11:46.700]  It's creating a digital global passport and digital currency and digital medical records and the system for the cashless society,
[11:46.700 --> 11:49.700]  planetary, social credit score.
[11:49.700 --> 11:51.700]  It's all being rolled out.
[11:51.700 --> 11:54.700]  It's being rolled out in blue cities and blue states.
[11:54.700 --> 12:01.700]  And I use that term nationwide and worldwide now because they don't call it red, blue, whether you're pro human, you're red,
[12:01.700 --> 12:09.700]  you're anti-human, you know, you're blue, I guess blue blood, globalist, gamma line, whatever you want to call it.
[12:09.700 --> 12:10.700]  Because it fits.
[12:10.700 --> 12:17.700]  It's the same global conspiracy and they admit it's a conspiracy and they even brag in their mainline publications that we're taking over the planet.
[12:17.700 --> 12:19.700]  The head of Debo said it's a worldwide reset.
[12:19.700 --> 12:23.700]  We're going to get rid of the middle class and lower the carbon footprint and teach people to be poor.
[12:23.700 --> 12:26.700]  And there are going to be no more tourism with the general public.
[12:26.700 --> 12:29.700]  All the big spaces will be open for us rich people to enjoy it.
[12:29.700 --> 12:31.700]  Wow.
[12:31.700 --> 12:33.700]  I mean, the party is over, man.
[12:33.700 --> 12:45.700]  And it's a bunch of jerks that want total control that own jumbo jets and huge 50,000 acre palaces and have huge parties and do whatever they want.
[12:45.700 --> 12:51.700]  Larry Page and Sergey Brin and all these jerks and the Democrats, they all have parties.
[12:51.700 --> 12:52.700]  They get their hair done.
[12:52.700 --> 12:54.700]  They fly around on private jets.
[12:54.700 --> 13:03.700]  They pay for all their hookers and everything with government taxpayer money and then they tell you when you're a blue collar worker, you're going to lose all your savings and have nothing.
[13:03.700 --> 13:13.700]  So we can dictate total control over you, which leads me to what I'm going to hit after I get into the election news, the election fraud news and Trump being on fire and so much more.
[13:13.700 --> 13:14.700]  Look at these headlines.
[13:14.700 --> 13:15.700]  These are on enforce.com.
[13:15.700 --> 13:18.700]  You got to share these.
[13:18.700 --> 13:20.700]  Now, listen to how they spin this.
[13:20.700 --> 13:27.700]  Quebec City says it will isolate uncooperative citizens in secret Corona facility.
[13:27.700 --> 13:34.700]  Authorities in Quebec City, Canada have announced they will isolate uncooperative citizens in a coronavirus facility, the location of which remains secret.
[13:34.700 --> 13:36.700]  They will come to your house and arrest you.
[13:36.700 --> 13:39.700]  What did the UN head of emergency response say three months ago?
[13:39.700 --> 13:41.700]  He said, we need to go into the houses.
[13:41.700 --> 13:43.700]  We need to get their kids, get their families.
[13:43.700 --> 13:52.700]  And then you saw Lightfoot say it, they all the UN says it, the big banks, the big insurance companies, the big medical systems.
[13:52.700 --> 13:54.700]  They put out their order.
[13:54.700 --> 14:02.700]  It goes into the UN and from Australia to Spain to the UK to the US to Canada.
[14:02.700 --> 14:12.700]  They admit with the statistics that five times, even with their bloated numbers of exaggerated COVID deaths, five times the number of people are dying from not getting medical care and not getting screenings.
[14:12.700 --> 14:20.700]  And I have family that has a problem and cannot get in.
[14:20.700 --> 14:30.700]  They got their ovaries looked at a few months ago how to persist and now the place won't book them in and it's getting worse.
[14:30.700 --> 14:34.700]  And I know people that live in Europe, they can't go to the doctor when they've got a sore throat.
[14:34.700 --> 14:35.700]  They can't get antibiotics.
[14:35.700 --> 14:39.700]  They're dying because they're all empty hospitals for the cut.
[14:39.700 --> 14:44.700]  And now none of that money is getting spent that the insurance companies and banks got that you paid in.
[14:44.700 --> 14:47.700]  You're still paying your insurance. Have you thought about that?
[14:47.700 --> 14:52.700]  You're still paying your insurance, but you can't get any medical care.
[14:52.700 --> 14:58.700]  You got to go to the emergency room if you're lucky.
[14:58.700 --> 14:59.700]  Just like that.
[14:59.700 --> 15:03.700]  Remember Bill Gates said, hey, we're going to give you a cane when you get cataracts.
[15:03.700 --> 15:09.700]  You got to hurt me and get a cane just like Cuba or Venezuela. They don't want you to have service.
[15:09.700 --> 15:10.700]  They don't want you to have an economy.
[15:10.700 --> 15:16.700]  They want to kill grandma to hire 10 teachers, but they're not going to hire 10 teachers and the dumb teachers rub their hands together.
[15:16.700 --> 15:18.700]  Oh, if I kill somebody, I get something.
[15:18.700 --> 15:21.700]  No, they're making this all obsolete.
[15:21.700 --> 15:27.700]  It's all their admitted sick evil plan because they think you're done.
[15:27.700 --> 15:28.700]  They think you're helpless.
[15:28.700 --> 15:30.700]  They think they can break your will.
[15:30.700 --> 15:36.700]  It's unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen, and when we play this video of this sick-oid medical tyrant, Dr. Mingola type,
[15:36.700 --> 15:38.700]  just going, the police are so good.
[15:38.700 --> 15:41.700]  We're going to grab you secretly. We're going to disappear you.
[15:41.700 --> 15:43.700]  I mean, they take a secret facility.
[15:43.700 --> 15:48.700]  They just got the power like a bastard grabbed a lure and they're running with it, man.
[15:48.700 --> 15:51.700]  They're just running, running, running for the power grab.
[15:51.700 --> 15:54.700]  You're seeing modern day high-tech tyranny right now.
[15:54.700 --> 15:56.700]  You live to see the New World Order.
[15:56.700 --> 16:03.700]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[16:03.700 --> 16:08.700]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[16:08.700 --> 16:14.700]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids,
[16:14.700 --> 16:21.700]  don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships,
[16:21.700 --> 16:26.700]  and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well,
[16:26.700 --> 16:32.700]  including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa do,
[16:32.700 --> 16:38.700]  and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[16:38.700 --> 16:43.700]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[16:43.700 --> 16:46.700]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[16:46.700 --> 16:55.700]  Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks, infowarstore.com.
[17:16.700 --> 17:23.700]  These civilizations have a post-remizant stagnation or new dark age
[17:23.700 --> 17:29.700]  and a total consolidation of all wealth and power in the hands of the kleptocratic post-humanist.
[17:29.700 --> 17:36.700]  The magnitude of this is unfathomable. As you can see, all the checkboxes of tyranny are being marked carefully.
[17:36.700 --> 17:43.700]  Every eye dotted, every T crossed, a total societal vertical integration, takeover, medical tyranny, total surveillance.
[17:43.700 --> 17:47.700]  The big tech heads, on average, have had their wealth cope up 35% in the last eight months.
[17:47.700 --> 17:50.700]  And of course, Jeff Bezos has basically doubled his.
[17:50.700 --> 18:18.700]  Everyone is being forced onto their system to post-human robot takeover. You're being made obsolete.
[18:18.700 --> 18:29.700]  Wednesday, September 9th, the year 2020, 54 days out, humanity rallies against the forces of the psychotic Satanists.
[18:29.700 --> 18:39.700]  So many hundreds of millions of children, billions of already been slaughtered, killed before they ever left the shelter of their mother's womb.
[18:39.700 --> 18:48.700]  Yes, we as adults, many of us deserve what is about to happen to us, but God gives us a reprieve for the children.
[18:48.700 --> 18:55.700]  And so I pray that God's spirit move upon the land through myself and through all of you and through others.
[18:55.700 --> 18:58.700]  And that we turn the tide for the sake of the children.
[18:58.700 --> 19:10.700]  We repent and seek God's face in the quiet place, the most high that King David talked about.
[19:10.700 --> 19:15.700]  All right, I'm going to get into the total global martial law directed by the UN.
[19:15.700 --> 19:17.700]  You understand that's not rhetoric.
[19:17.700 --> 19:22.700]  I mean, I'm saying that the total global martial law directed by the UN, that's what it is.
[19:22.700 --> 19:24.700]  It's not an exaggeration.
[19:24.700 --> 19:31.700]  In fact, it's worse than that. It's a martial law where they make you take a vaccine that changes your DNA and can give you cancer on record.
[19:31.700 --> 19:34.700]  And it's making everyone super sick.
[19:34.700 --> 19:37.700]  Now coming out that 100% are getting violently ill.
[19:37.700 --> 19:39.700]  What the hell are they doing?
[19:39.700 --> 19:42.700]  I mean, this is out of control.
[19:42.700 --> 19:46.700]  And they're pushing and they're pushing and they're pushing to be able to secretly arrest whoever they want.
[19:46.700 --> 19:48.700]  And it's already here.
[19:48.700 --> 19:50.700]  I have a stack of news on this.
[19:50.700 --> 19:53.700]  And they even quote the UN as their authority.
[19:53.700 --> 19:55.700]  It's unbelievable.
[19:55.700 --> 20:02.700]  In Italy, in Quebec, in New Zealand, in Australia, in Spain is one of the worst.
[20:02.700 --> 20:04.700]  Meanwhile, in Sweden, they did absolutely nothing.
[20:04.700 --> 20:09.700]  And now they're saying, actually, COVID didn't exist and we have record low deaths from pneumonia.
[20:09.700 --> 20:11.700]  This doesn't exist, basically.
[20:11.700 --> 20:14.700]  It's a real virus because Gates owns it.
[20:14.700 --> 20:16.700]  And everybody gets it so you can be guilty.
[20:16.700 --> 20:18.700]  Don't you get it?
[20:18.700 --> 20:21.700]  Sorry, let me get back to the news I said I was going to cover.
[20:21.700 --> 20:23.700]  But look at these headlines.
[20:23.700 --> 20:29.700]  America held hostage dims, announced planned to burn down every U.S. city of Trump wins.
[20:29.700 --> 20:35.700]  Atlantic Monthly, Washington Post, I've got them all right here.
[20:35.700 --> 20:37.700]  Looting is legitimate.
[20:37.700 --> 20:47.700]  CNN, the defensive looting and defensive arson, NPR, and defensive violent street action.
[20:47.700 --> 20:54.700]  And they've announced under a Soros funded group to mainstream news that they're going to burn every city and quote,
[20:54.700 --> 20:59.700]  keep America locked down and do what and do what and do what and do what?
[20:59.700 --> 21:01.700]  Plunge the stock market.
[21:01.700 --> 21:03.700]  Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding.
[21:03.700 --> 21:07.700]  How many times I tell you that was coming.
[21:07.700 --> 21:16.580]  And Zuckerberg and Zuckerberg says that it'll be days or even weeks and once you accept
[21:16.580 --> 21:19.340]  weeks of a delayed election, it'll be months.
[21:19.340 --> 21:23.380]  And on January 20th, if the president and vice president have not been seated with
[21:23.380 --> 21:35.020]  the electors, then it gets who becomes the president, the 46th president, Nancy, the
[21:35.020 --> 21:44.220]  Crick Keeper, Paul Losey.
[21:44.220 --> 21:50.420]  And then if she steps now, do you know who comes next?
[21:50.420 --> 21:57.620]  Oh, so let me just show you these headlines again.
[21:57.620 --> 22:00.020]  This is coming up.
[22:00.020 --> 22:06.860]  Quebec City is already having secret arrest in secret COVID camp.
[22:06.860 --> 22:11.660]  Corona marshals to patrol UK cities to enforce social distancing.
[22:11.660 --> 22:15.100]  Spain citizens stop police from arresting a woman for not wearing a mask.
[22:15.100 --> 22:17.100]  That's the answer is rebellion.
[22:17.100 --> 22:19.700]  This is tyranny.
[22:19.700 --> 22:26.220]  La Stampe make mass parts of the big paper, a big liberal paper in Italy, make mask the
[22:26.220 --> 22:27.420]  law forever.
[22:27.420 --> 22:28.420]  Never shake hands again.
[22:28.420 --> 22:29.940]  And this is a damn cult.
[22:29.940 --> 22:34.580]  Hand-framed officials using government gyms while private gyms remain shut.
[22:34.580 --> 22:39.940]  Of course, in fours dot com positive COVID tests in no lockdown, Sweden hit lowest rate
[22:39.940 --> 22:46.780]  since pandemic began, Reuters, Governor Noam rejects report that Sturgis rally led to hundreds
[22:46.780 --> 22:48.940]  of thousands of COVID cases is fiction.
[22:48.940 --> 22:51.060]  Yes, it is.
[22:51.060 --> 22:55.060]  Trump campaign crowd appeared to violate North Carolina mask order.
[22:55.060 --> 22:56.060]  Good.
[22:56.060 --> 23:00.140]  Dr. Fauci says he's frustrated by large, massless Trump rallies.
[23:00.140 --> 23:02.460]  We want to set an example.
[23:02.460 --> 23:07.060]  Meanwhile, the persecution of Christians is escalating dramatically worldwide in fours
[23:07.060 --> 23:08.060]  dot com.
[23:08.060 --> 23:09.060]  You might want to spread that.
[23:09.060 --> 23:14.060]  Fox News channels Carson says Democrats leverage fear of virus to gain political power.
[23:14.060 --> 23:15.140]  This isn't science.
[23:15.140 --> 23:16.140]  It's dystopia.
[23:16.140 --> 23:21.660]  Meanwhile, Los Angeles fans Halloween trick or treating due to COVID-19 risk, unless you're
[23:21.660 --> 23:25.780]  a big rich globalist thinking of all the parties you ever wanted.
[23:25.780 --> 23:26.780]  It's all coming up.
[23:26.780 --> 23:35.300]  But when I'm going to hit first, when we come back, I'm going to get into the pre-planning
[23:35.300 --> 23:40.860]  for the martial law destabilization collapse of stock market race war, the execution of
[23:40.860 --> 23:44.740]  the beta test, then the white paper saying they were going to go operational three months
[23:44.740 --> 23:45.740]  ago.
[23:45.740 --> 23:49.460]  Now they're going operational and we're now in the operation to now have been launched
[23:49.460 --> 23:54.620]  and it's official and they're doing it just like they loaded up a train full of TNT and
[23:54.620 --> 23:57.300]  started it towards the town and it's going to just blow up when it hits the town.
[23:57.300 --> 24:00.180]  I mean, it's it's it's it's it's it's coming down the tracks.
[24:00.180 --> 24:03.460]  It's only going 100 miles an hour is coming right up.
[24:03.460 --> 24:04.460]  Wow.
[24:04.460 --> 24:05.460]  Wow.
[24:05.460 --> 24:14.140]  And from San Francisco to New York City from Miami to Dallas, Texas, we got videos of them
[24:14.140 --> 24:26.260]  chanting from Portland, Oregon to Indiana, Indianapolis, chanting death to America.
[24:26.260 --> 24:28.940]  That's what black lives matter and any of a chant official grips.
[24:28.940 --> 24:31.060]  Hey, I wonder if those are the bad guys.
[24:31.060 --> 24:35.620]  I wonder if they're coming to destroy us.
[24:35.620 --> 24:40.100]  People like, oh, America never let that happen.
[24:40.100 --> 24:43.620]  Sauros is overthrown more than 20 countries he takes credit for.
[24:43.620 --> 24:49.380]  He has destroyed more than 15 major currencies and made more people poor people than anybody
[24:49.380 --> 24:50.380]  in modern history.
[24:50.380 --> 24:51.740]  He loves it.
[24:51.740 --> 24:54.220]  He loves it because he's liberal.
[24:54.220 --> 24:57.380]  You know, when you help round up fellow Jews, you're liberal.
[24:57.380 --> 25:01.340]  When you bankrupt economies and destroy millions of people's savings in each country and people
[25:01.340 --> 25:06.460]  starve to death, you're liberal because you're George Soros and the ADL said so.
[25:06.460 --> 25:13.300]  Get on your knees to the Nazi collaborator and bow to your God who said back in the 80s
[25:13.300 --> 25:15.300]  and interview that he was the Messiah.
[25:15.300 --> 25:20.420]  But he said he doesn't tell people that they might want to lock him up, but that as a young
[25:20.420 --> 25:23.420]  man, he knew he would be the Messiah.
[25:23.420 --> 25:28.900]  Well, he sure as hell bring it in satanic evil everywhere.
[25:28.900 --> 25:31.180]  Maybe he is like Satan's daddy or something.
[25:31.180 --> 25:35.180]  I mean, maybe maybe he's laid an egg somewhere and Antichrist is going to hatch out of it.
[25:35.180 --> 25:37.460]  He sure as hell ain't Alexander Soros.
[25:37.460 --> 25:43.500]  He looks like 20 times weirder than his father was like a little crazed demon though, man.
[25:43.500 --> 25:46.500]  You look at him and you're like, man, keep that guy away from my kids.
[25:46.500 --> 25:47.500]  Woo.
[25:47.500 --> 25:49.460]  I've seen Alexander Soros as a pedophile.
[25:49.460 --> 25:51.860]  He sure as hell looks like one though, huh?
[25:51.860 --> 25:58.580]  So this is all Alexander Soros, all this crap, all the garbage, all the new world order,
[25:58.580 --> 26:00.140]  all the everything.
[26:00.140 --> 26:08.820]  And I'm very honored to have that slime that the jaws of hell are just open stinking jaws
[26:08.820 --> 26:13.540]  of hell and Alexander Soros and his father and all of them are going to be dumped directly
[26:13.540 --> 26:18.020]  into it.
[26:18.020 --> 26:24.860]  So there is a God, God's in control and the enemies of God and the enemies of goodness
[26:24.860 --> 26:27.900]  will pay and they already sold out their losers.
[26:27.900 --> 26:28.900]  They know they're paying.
[26:28.900 --> 26:31.620]  They're trying to take as many of us with them as they can.
[26:31.620 --> 26:32.620]  Don't let them get you down.
[26:32.620 --> 26:33.980]  Don't let them make you depressed.
[26:33.980 --> 26:35.140]  Don't let them crawl to despair.
[26:35.140 --> 26:36.140]  Be happy.
[26:36.140 --> 26:37.140]  Love God.
[26:37.140 --> 26:38.140]  Have good cheer.
[26:38.140 --> 26:39.980]  Know that revelations will be fulfilled that God is real.
[26:39.980 --> 26:45.180]  We'll be with God for eternity, but we must be tested by these rats, by these snakes.
[26:45.180 --> 26:55.420]  We must and we will be tested and we will come through the fire stronger.
[26:55.420 --> 27:02.700]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands, but if you
[27:02.700 --> 27:06.940]  were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that you think it was magic, you wouldn't
[27:06.940 --> 27:10.340]  even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them.
[27:10.340 --> 27:15.060]  So for that person, it would be spiritual or it would be something of the spirit.
[27:15.060 --> 27:19.380]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies and many other species of animal, they'll
[27:19.380 --> 27:23.180]  have to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[27:23.180 --> 27:27.780]  They're following magnetic lines, they have magnetic cells in their brains, we now know
[27:27.780 --> 27:30.860]  side of what's going on, there's even a lot more than that.
[27:30.860 --> 27:34.620]  So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter, we're talking about
[27:34.620 --> 27:37.020]  all the things you don't understand but we know it's there.
[27:37.020 --> 27:41.140]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off a wireless system, that's what's
[27:41.140 --> 27:47.140]  going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people and that's how this
[27:47.140 --> 27:51.580]  entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a consciousness manipulated
[27:51.580 --> 27:54.940]  mechanism, space-time continuum.
[27:54.940 --> 28:01.500]  As of 54 days out, the globalist child molesting devil worshipers know they're in trouble
[28:01.500 --> 28:03.300]  and they know Trump's going to win in the landslides.
[28:03.300 --> 28:06.380]  They're saying they're going to contest the election and plunge the country into civil
[28:06.380 --> 28:07.380]  war.
[28:07.380 --> 28:13.380]  And they're throwing hack attacks at M4s, dirty tricks, attempts to shut us down, it's incredible.
[28:13.380 --> 28:18.220]  That's why now more than ever, your financial support at M4store.com is critical, it's what
[28:18.220 --> 28:19.220]  keeps us in the game.
[28:19.220 --> 28:22.220]  We've only got a few months of backup.
[28:22.220 --> 28:25.700]  If money wasn't coming in, we'd be shut down and that's not good.
[28:25.700 --> 28:30.540]  We need to have extra money in our coffers, people to expand in this home stretch, not
[28:30.540 --> 28:31.740]  just contract.
[28:31.740 --> 28:36.140]  We're winning but these scumbags aren't going to give us the victory without a fight.
[28:36.140 --> 28:40.220]  So I know you're going to step up and at M4store.com we've got free shipping on a bunch of our
[28:40.220 --> 28:44.140]  best-selling items, a bunch of new items that came back in stock, we've got privacy pockets
[28:44.140 --> 28:49.100]  so your phones don't track you, great supplements, books, films, t-shirts and so much more.
[28:49.100 --> 28:53.100]  Get prepared and fund the M4 War at M4store.com, God bless you all.
[28:53.100 --> 28:58.700]  I don't want to say I'm a prideful person, I am a humble person overall, I've not come
[28:58.700 --> 29:03.060]  off as aggressive in things because I'm under threat, you're under threat and I'm fine as
[29:03.060 --> 29:06.940]  hard as I possibly can and I appreciate your support and your prayers but I know I come
[29:06.940 --> 29:11.500]  off as obnoxious sometimes and I wish I did a better job so that's why when you call in
[29:11.500 --> 29:16.100]  thanking me all the time, you just kind of make me feel pathetic because I guess call
[29:16.100 --> 29:20.220]  in pride, I don't like begging you all the time to try our products or to donate or to
[29:20.220 --> 29:24.220]  spread the word or to pray for us, I just know that's what keeps us on air and so I want
[29:24.220 --> 29:29.260]  to thank you, you, it's put the card before the horse to call in and thank me.
[29:29.260 --> 29:35.060]  Listen, I'm committed to this just like you are so understand you're my equal 110% and
[29:35.060 --> 29:38.860]  I just want to thank you all, I want to thank our crew and our affiliates and everybody
[29:38.860 --> 29:42.780]  else man, I just want to stay in this fight and it's so serious now, things are getting
[29:42.780 --> 29:46.460]  so clear now, that's why they want us off here because all of our credibility is so
[29:46.460 --> 29:50.460]  high, let's just stay together, fight hard, spread the word, pray to God to take us through
[29:50.460 --> 29:57.580]  this, we're going to make it.
[29:57.580 --> 30:17.380]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show 54 days and then the Democrats are going to contest
[30:17.380 --> 30:21.860]  and they're going to burn down every city and they're going to try to occupy the streets
[30:21.860 --> 30:25.180]  until the stock market plunges and they're going to demand Trump leave and try to pull
[30:25.180 --> 30:30.940]  the 25th amendment or worse, they were first to tell you, I just remind you of that so
[30:30.940 --> 30:35.500]  people know and I'm laying this stuff out, I'm not playing games ladies and gentlemen,
[30:35.500 --> 30:40.620]  I'm not telling you stuff that sounds scary, I'm telling you the truth so you can make
[30:40.620 --> 30:48.540]  preparation for it because I believe in you, I can see you, I know your power and I want
[30:48.540 --> 30:59.500]  you to stop fearing Satan and start fearing God, now let's get into the news, President
[30:59.500 --> 31:03.220]  Trump is hitting it hard saying if you're with Biden, you're with communist China and
[31:03.220 --> 31:06.980]  you're against your own damn self-interest and he's coming out saying they're coming
[31:06.980 --> 31:11.340]  for your guns, they're going to ban your guns, they've sworn to do it, if you let these
[31:11.340 --> 31:15.020]  enemies take over, here's what the president had to say.
[31:15.020 --> 31:19.820]  We will always defend the Everglades and we will always safeguard the magnificent Florida
[31:19.820 --> 31:25.580]  coastline, we'll expand access for fishermen and sportsmen, we'll uphold your right to
[31:25.580 --> 31:36.700]  hunt and we will protect your right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment.
[31:36.700 --> 31:43.020]  And I can tell you this, if Joe Biden gets in, he'll have nothing to say about it, he's
[31:43.020 --> 31:46.740]  not, let's face it, Joe's shy.
[31:46.740 --> 31:52.620]  If Joe Biden gets in, your second amendment is gone, it's gone, either obliterated to
[31:52.620 --> 31:58.500]  a point of being gone or gone itself, okay, you will not have a second amendment and the
[31:58.500 --> 32:04.620]  pressure put on me in the last four years to make massive changes to the second amendment
[32:04.620 --> 32:14.340]  which would have really rendered it worthless, Ron knows, the pressure put on me, very few
[32:14.340 --> 32:17.940]  people would have been able to withstand that pressure, they would have made big, big cuts
[32:17.940 --> 32:23.940]  and big changes, your second amendment will remain powerful, will remain strong, will
[32:23.940 --> 32:25.780]  remain with you.
[32:25.780 --> 32:31.580]  Yes, and even if Trump gets killed or thrown out via fraud, they're not taking our guns,
[32:31.580 --> 32:37.420]  but it's critical if they start a war to not fight with the fodder because we don't want
[32:37.420 --> 32:38.420]  that to happen.
[32:38.420 --> 32:45.020]  Got to go to the head of the snakes, it's a hydra, it's got a lot of heads, but it's,
[32:45.020 --> 32:49.620]  we go to the heads, we're not going to bite on the pinky toe or anything or chew on its
[32:49.620 --> 32:57.380]  tail, going right for the eyes and the neck, the nose, right off.
[32:57.380 --> 33:03.300]  So politically, loving, liberal way, we treat unborn babies, you know, that kind of nonviolent
[33:03.300 --> 33:04.300]  thing.
[33:04.300 --> 33:09.020]  Seriously though, we're going to win this thing peacefully one way or another, and that's
[33:09.020 --> 33:14.660]  what I stand for when I believe in, but Joe Rogan, I told you he's a really smart guy,
[33:14.660 --> 33:19.020]  but when you hear him on air, he always tries to show both sides of it, well sometimes the
[33:19.020 --> 33:24.300]  other side's a lie, you can't really do that, he had Adam Curry on who did start podcasting,
[33:24.300 --> 33:28.340]  he's not just a famous first big host on MTV, he's one of the guys that got Joe to move
[33:28.340 --> 33:34.540]  to Austin, I was there for him as well, but there was the media still doesn't know where
[33:34.540 --> 33:37.620]  Joe lives, they just keep saying, well, no one knows in Texas, but he had Adam Curry
[33:37.620 --> 33:42.420]  on yesterday, and they talked about losing Austin, I mean, I told you losing Austin folks,
[33:42.420 --> 33:47.300]  but the point is, is that Trump tweeted a bunch of stuff about Joe Rogan including about
[33:47.300 --> 33:53.980]  me yesterday, and I told you that Joe was debating which hundred episodes he was going
[33:53.980 --> 33:57.820]  to keep on YouTube under their deal, and what he was going to put on Spotify because they
[33:57.820 --> 34:02.140]  can't be both places, but I got word yesterday, I guess Spotify's figuring out how much they
[34:02.140 --> 34:06.460]  need to be on YouTube, and have content both places, because that will just promote over
[34:06.460 --> 34:11.460]  to Spotify, that was a very dumb idea to get rid of all those episodes, oh so now my episodes
[34:11.460 --> 34:16.500]  will be on both platforms, so see how that works, there was a big debate going on with
[34:16.500 --> 34:20.220]  them about what was the best to do, it's free on Spotify, but they have like a gold member
[34:20.220 --> 34:25.180]  deal, and so they're just figuring it out, it was not a censorship issue, I told you,
[34:25.180 --> 34:30.700]  I called up Joe, had a 30 minute conversation with him last week, and I told you the truth,
[34:30.700 --> 34:34.900]  it's just that Joe said whatever the most controversial, whatever the highest views
[34:34.900 --> 34:39.820]  are, let me review a list, so Spotify kind of held back some of the highest views, but
[34:39.820 --> 34:43.620]  also some of what they thought was controversial, probably kind of hoping Joe didn't pay attention
[34:43.620 --> 34:47.580]  and then that didn't go over there, but then that blew up, so there was some proof that
[34:47.580 --> 34:53.580]  it was censorship, but Joe's in control so it stopped, and that's the nuance of it, because
[34:53.580 --> 34:58.260]  when they're corporately going back and forth with all of that, they're not sure what they're
[34:58.260 --> 35:02.020]  doing, he's not sure, I mean that's what uncharted territory is like folks, it's not
[35:02.020 --> 35:05.900]  like just cut in stone, and that's the way it is, and Joe had said I want you to be
[35:05.900 --> 35:09.900]  one of my first guests when I get to Austin, and then that became a huge national issue,
[35:09.900 --> 35:14.420]  and there was a stock issue and all the rest of it, but Joe will be here soon, and I will
[35:14.420 --> 35:20.500]  be with him soon, I'm going to leave it at that, because it's really uncanny that his
[35:20.500 --> 35:24.740]  office will be right on the street from me, so it's just, it's weird how the universe
[35:24.740 --> 35:31.700]  works, because you didn't even try to get an office next to us, I mean literally, I
[35:31.700 --> 35:36.980]  could walk there in five minutes, it's just the way the universe works, so Joe's like
[35:36.980 --> 35:45.220]  this is a really cool place, wait a minute, it was Rob Alex Jones, so a lot of craziness,
[35:45.220 --> 35:48.620]  that's how the universe works, okay, let me just get serious here, because I need to get
[35:48.620 --> 35:52.300]  back in the mode and not get distracted off and all of that, and I really need to hit
[35:52.300 --> 35:56.220]  the martial law plans, and the plans to destroy the stock market and all this, I mean this
[35:56.220 --> 36:02.260]  is show illegal, this is show criminal, and if they kill the dollar, I could talk for
[36:02.260 --> 36:05.540]  ten hours straight on what that will look like and how bad it is, I don't think I need
[36:05.540 --> 36:08.700]  to explain to everybody what that will look like, but you know what, remind me guys, six
[36:08.700 --> 36:13.500]  after next hour, I'm going to spend five minutes on what that will look like, and I've tried
[36:13.500 --> 36:17.740]  to not even look into that area, because here's the deal, I don't manipulate, I don't lie
[36:17.740 --> 36:23.220]  to you ever, but I do hold stuff back sometimes if I think it's going to hurt the economy,
[36:23.220 --> 36:29.340]  because they're trying to kill the economy, and if I get up here and tell people what
[36:29.340 --> 36:32.620]  it's going to look like, if they're able to kill the dollar, it will scare the hell out
[36:32.620 --> 36:36.700]  of people, and they've even had the Wall Street Journal admit that this show massively affects
[36:36.700 --> 36:40.700]  stock prices, so the last thing I want to do is spook everybody, but let me tell you
[36:40.700 --> 36:44.580]  something, you better thank your lucky stars, we got Trump, and we better be praying on
[36:44.580 --> 36:49.260]  our knees to get reelected, because the globalists want to end America, and they want to dictate
[36:49.260 --> 36:53.940]  to us the terms of surrender, they didn't just collapse all their blue cities on accident,
[36:53.940 --> 36:58.180]  they did it on purpose to consolidate control, they're going to have ten, twenty years of
[36:58.180 --> 37:02.980]  depression, and then buy it all up and break our will, and then they'll turn America back
[37:02.980 --> 37:08.060]  on later, and have it be a threat to China, and have a bipolar world again, but right
[37:08.060 --> 37:14.180]  now they want to have China take over, and have a big run, probably for fifty years,
[37:14.180 --> 37:23.020]  and so, folks, I started thinking about what the death of the dollar would look like, we're
[37:23.020 --> 37:29.340]  talking great depression, but ten times worse, and we're talking war on the streets, and
[37:29.340 --> 37:36.020]  so I'll talk about that coming up, speaking of the devil, I don't want to exaggerate,
[37:36.020 --> 37:40.300]  but let's put up the name of the sale right now, for TV viewers please, this headline
[37:40.300 --> 37:45.980]  is not an exaggeration, save them for war, save the republic, save yourself, I literally
[37:45.980 --> 37:51.100]  have agonized over this last few weeks, but I'll just tell you, we have everything we
[37:51.100 --> 37:55.300]  have in stock, a lot of it we can't even reorder, everything's breaking down, the supply chain
[37:55.300 --> 37:58.700]  is breaking down, everything's falling apart, we're under massive Chinese government hack
[37:58.700 --> 38:02.340]  attack right now, both sides, they're secure, but it slows them down, costs us tons of money
[38:02.340 --> 38:07.820]  to fight it, this is a real war, so if you ever wanted an M4 Wars t-shirt, or you ever
[38:07.820 --> 38:11.140]  wanted to get an Alexa Pure Breeze, or you ever wanted to buy some of the supplements
[38:11.140 --> 38:14.820]  and see how they are, and support us, now's the time folks, you don't want to wait, this
[38:14.820 --> 38:20.580]  is sudden death over time, super bowl, but for the whole future everybody, and with all
[38:20.580 --> 38:24.540]  their strategic attacks and things that are going on, I need to get fuel on the gas tank,
[38:24.540 --> 38:33.340]  let's say the fuel tank is on a tenth of a tank, and I've got to go 100 miles, and I've
[38:33.340 --> 38:39.020]  got enough gas to go 50 miles, okay, so there's a lot of things I can do, I have to make decisions,
[38:39.020 --> 38:43.300]  and I've seen the big support last week, big support this week, that buys us, the extra
[38:43.300 --> 38:50.540]  support we just got, bought us maybe in my gas tank another three weeks, I need to sell
[38:50.540 --> 38:54.300]  everything, in fact people only buy when it's massively discounted, there's not that much
[38:54.300 --> 38:58.580]  of a markup, so then we sell a bunch of stuff, a bunch of money comes in, then there's not
[38:58.580 --> 39:05.980]  money to order the next group, and see that's where I am, do I cannibalize, and just sell
[39:05.980 --> 39:09.900]  it a discount, sell everything out to have the money to go into next year, and then
[39:09.900 --> 39:15.940]  have to implode, and maybe not even be on air, that's where I'm at, so I'm probably
[39:15.940 --> 39:19.140]  just going to say we're selling out everything and then sell it at full price, and then hope
[39:19.140 --> 39:22.620]  we have enough money to buy stuff into the future, or go back to an advertising model
[39:22.620 --> 39:26.940]  or donations model which people don't respond to, I don't know, and I don't feel sorry for
[39:26.940 --> 39:30.140]  myself because if Trump loses, and they're going to put us in a depression anyway, it's
[39:30.140 --> 39:32.700]  just going to be so hellish, we're all going to enjoy it together, I mean, I feel sorry
[39:32.700 --> 39:37.020]  for everybody man, I try my best, you know what I mean, but I mean it's bad, it's bad,
[39:37.020 --> 39:39.980]  and everybody I know in business the supply chains are breaking down, anything that's
[39:39.980 --> 39:45.820]  service oriented, or furniture, tile, you know, silverware, stuff for your house, just
[39:45.820 --> 39:51.940]  everything, food, supplements, medical supplies, drugs, it's all breaking down, we're under
[39:51.940 --> 39:54.540]  devastating attack.
[39:54.540 --> 39:59.740]  There is a metaphysical rule that God has put in place that controls the universe, and
[39:59.740 --> 40:04.580]  it's free will, that's why the social engineers, the robber barons, the globalists, the post
[40:04.580 --> 40:12.220]  humanists, the anti-humans openly tell you what they're doing, and openly tell you that
[40:12.220 --> 40:16.340]  your work was to crap and you need to die, because that will save the earth, and they
[40:16.340 --> 40:21.300]  do everything they can to make the most dystopian, ugly future they can in the movies, and in
[40:21.300 --> 40:26.020]  the culture, and in all the different publications, they are making you hate yourself, they are
[40:26.020 --> 40:29.660]  making you be depressed, they are making you not have a connection to God, because they
[40:29.660 --> 40:33.620]  just want you to die, so they can selfishly control the future, and that's what all this
[40:33.620 --> 40:37.500]  is about, you know, they say they're setting up world government to protect us all from
[40:37.500 --> 40:42.140]  our super technologies, while they're the ones running around like mad scientists, in
[40:42.140 --> 40:45.060]  danger in the whole planet, with a lot of these technologies.
[40:45.060 --> 40:50.780]  The globalists are what is disruptive to human species, they call us disruptive to their
[40:50.780 --> 40:54.340]  power grab, it's time to say no.
[40:54.340 --> 41:02.260]  In Germany, in Australia, in Canada, and now even in Ohio, every blue state, every blue
[41:02.260 --> 41:08.820]  city is announcing that they are establishing emergency COVID centers for people that refuse
[41:08.820 --> 41:14.020]  to be tested, or people that are tested, but refuse to stay in place, while the results
[41:14.020 --> 41:18.740]  are coming back, or those that supposedly break quarantine, this of course is all based
[41:18.740 --> 41:24.420]  on the tests that are over 90% fraudulent and were designed to be so.
[41:24.420 --> 41:30.260]  This is a power grab, the world government globalist system is in trouble, all over the
[41:30.260 --> 41:36.220]  planet free peoples are trying to pull out of it, and every blue area, I use the term
[41:36.220 --> 41:41.820]  blue as if the US for blue for democrats, red for republicans, is basically globalists
[41:41.820 --> 41:47.340]  or communists and authoritarian, and they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian
[41:47.340 --> 41:51.140]  takeover because they know the world's waiting to them, it's a very simple equation, it's
[41:51.140 --> 41:54.140]  illegal, we must resist it.
[41:54.140 --> 41:58.580]  I know I say it all the time, but I mean it from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank
[41:58.580 --> 42:03.340]  you for the listeners, viewers, this broadcast, and all the stations, and all the affiliates,
[42:03.340 --> 42:09.140]  sponsors, and my family, and the crew, and just everybody out there, the listeners and
[42:09.140 --> 42:14.340]  viewers as I said, this is such an epic struggle, and we've all been proven dead on, we've been
[42:14.340 --> 42:18.220]  proven we're right because we're being led by God, we have a spirit, and we're very humble
[42:18.220 --> 42:23.220]  about that, this is not us, this is God working through us, but man now it's so precious to
[42:23.220 --> 42:27.820]  stay on air, I used to think maybe I'll wake a bunch of people up and I can kind of proceed
[42:27.820 --> 42:33.500]  into the background because fighting this thing 18 hours a day gets a little bit old, but
[42:33.500 --> 42:37.140]  now with the evil so out in the open and everything we've said being vindicated, I never questioned
[42:37.140 --> 42:41.140]  what I was saying because I knew it was true, but I did question where they'd ever actually
[42:41.140 --> 42:44.500]  try to carry it all out, well now we know they're going to carry it out and then some,
[42:44.500 --> 42:48.540]  so we got to fight, and I just really appreciate you and we're in this together, and praise
[42:48.540 --> 42:55.060]  God, past the ammunition of the info war, again take action folks, this is it.
[42:55.060 --> 43:01.500]  We is being domesticated, and we're not being domesticated to end war as the Carnegie Endowment
[43:01.500 --> 43:07.380]  the UN say, that's for proletariat consumption, when you read deeper into the transhumanist
[43:07.380 --> 43:13.700]  plan it is the most megalomaniacal psychotic thing you could ever imagine, not even in
[43:13.700 --> 43:18.860]  again a science fiction horror movie, could you come close to what this is actually going
[43:18.860 --> 43:23.860]  to look like, so remember compliance with the mask, compliance with social distancing,
[43:23.860 --> 43:27.700]  with the airports, all of this is training you for the post-human world, we're all being
[43:27.700 --> 43:32.140]  taught that we're not essential, we must get people like the governor of Texas to wake
[43:32.140 --> 43:37.780]  up and say no and reverse himself, we've got to get Trump to go more on the offense exposing
[43:37.780 --> 43:43.500]  COVID-19 as an overblown hoax, yes it's a virus, yes it kills people, maybe one percent
[43:43.500 --> 43:48.820]  as bad as the flu, not ten percent as bad, it's totally overblown ladies and gentlemen
[43:48.820 --> 43:57.020]  because it is the shoehorn to bring in the end of liberty and freedom as we know it.
[43:57.020 --> 44:24.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:24.020 --> 44:47.500]  Let's get into it right now, let's lay it out, let's break it down, look at these headlines,
[44:47.500 --> 44:55.100]  this is an infowars.com article, report, leftist groups form alliance to prepare for
[44:55.100 --> 45:02.780]  mass public unrest, they go in and they pledge the Daily Beast reports in the group run by
[45:02.780 --> 45:08.700]  Soros, they don't even hide that now, putting move on, color of change and the American
[45:08.700 --> 45:15.620]  Federation of Teachers have formed a democracy defense nerve center and it itself is run
[45:15.620 --> 45:25.380]  by former CIA and FBI color revolution operatives that have overthrown more than 20 governments.
[45:25.380 --> 45:29.980]  The coalition dubbing itself the fight back table is reportedly planning to counter claims
[45:29.980 --> 45:34.860]  of election victory by Trump and his supporters and are joined by Facebook and others saying
[45:34.860 --> 45:41.180]  it will not be allowed to say that Trump won and anyone out saying it will be physically
[45:41.180 --> 45:51.100]  assaulted, revolver has a big article, legal hatchet man and central operative in the color
[45:51.100 --> 45:57.780]  revolution against President Trump, they call it a color revolution themselves in our report
[45:57.780 --> 46:04.300]  on never Trump State Department official George Kent, a revolver news first through attention
[46:04.300 --> 46:12.900]  to the ominous similarities and the tactics of the United States government employees
[46:12.900 --> 46:17.820]  the so-called color revolutions and the coordinated efforts of government bureaucrats in the media
[46:17.820 --> 46:22.820]  to house President Trump, a recent follow up to this official report focused specifically
[46:22.820 --> 46:26.820]  on the shadowy George Soros link group called transition integrity project, that's the
[46:26.820 --> 46:32.020]  one that's running and all I just mentioned, war games, exercises suggesting the likelihood
[46:32.020 --> 46:37.020]  of a contested election scenario insuring chaos and they go on to say their job will
[46:37.020 --> 46:44.380]  be keeping the country locked down shut down and take down the stock market and I'm not
[46:44.380 --> 46:48.260]  taking away from revolver that's a new side I like it they do a good job newer side is
[46:48.260 --> 46:53.260]  just that we've been the victim of this day behind network the COG that Pelosi says is
[46:53.260 --> 46:58.420]  going to put her in power said that on national TV that shy met with COG and I'm second command
[46:58.420 --> 47:05.140]  and I'll I'll be president soon when he doesn't leave what the hell I mean this is this is
[47:05.140 --> 47:12.260]  being said by them so but what they did dig up surprise surprise is Homer Powell would
[47:12.260 --> 47:20.060]  always say that Soros is running with Alexander Soros of course he is and that works for the
[47:20.060 --> 47:24.980]  deep state and Obama and the rest of them so that is a big big deal you got to go read
[47:24.980 --> 47:30.500]  what they're saying what they're going to do meanwhile far left group the same group
[47:30.500 --> 47:37.980]  predicts implores will docks Joe Biden electors no last time I said it was illegal for Pelosi's
[47:37.980 --> 47:41.660]  daughter to be going to the electors saying that they're not going to put Trump in they're
[47:41.660 --> 47:46.140]  going to put Hillary in and then she said I deathreaded her on Fox News and they tried
[47:46.140 --> 47:49.020]  to have the Justice Department arrest me and they opened up a Justice Department investigation
[47:49.020 --> 47:55.980]  of the FBI counterterrorism unit and then they went back to he didn't do any of that
[47:55.980 --> 48:02.980]  that's who these people are a far left coalition wargamed several post election apocalyptic
[48:02.980 --> 48:07.860]  scenarios in case Democrat candidate Joe Biden lost president Trump predicting that info
[48:07.860 --> 48:13.820]  wars could get involved by doxing Joe Biden's electors okay there that's a public thing
[48:13.820 --> 48:23.980]  I mean and leaking 88 of these electors to George Soros and 14 to child sex trafficking
[48:23.980 --> 48:28.900]  probably more of than that a bizarre piece by the Daily Beast entitled the left secretly
[48:28.900 --> 48:34.420]  preps for mega violence mega violence every election day and it goes on to say I'm running
[48:34.420 --> 48:43.820]  everything which I mean I guess we kind of only because we say what everybody else already
[48:43.820 --> 48:50.460]  knows I mean I mean Trump's people others people that are patriots in the FBI CIA I
[48:50.460 --> 48:54.620]  mean they tune in they hear what they already know at the highest level they go how the
[48:54.620 --> 48:58.980]  hell is this guy doing because I've been reverse engineering it for my entire adult life and
[48:58.980 --> 49:04.420]  before that and I grew up around people that had worked in some secret areas they told me
[49:04.420 --> 49:07.980]  how everything worked and how corrupt it was how there was an alien outside group coming
[49:07.980 --> 49:12.580]  in to take over the government and one day we'd have to fight it and here we are fighting
[49:12.580 --> 49:17.740]  it and doing a damn good job and it's not because I've got magic connections and not
[49:17.740 --> 49:27.700]  because no info wars is independent it's like in that movie Elysium where she says you know
[49:27.700 --> 49:33.460]  you'll be lucky if we if you don't hang for this he goes hang we do the hanging that's
[49:33.460 --> 49:38.740]  all that gives orders like Tony Montana says his balls and this isn't about bragging it's
[49:38.740 --> 49:42.780]  about you knowing how powerful you are you are just as important as anybody in the government
[49:42.780 --> 49:47.140]  anybody at the Newark Times anybody at the Financial Times of London anybody at the FBI
[49:47.140 --> 49:53.580]  you're a sovereign person it's not a slave you're a good person and info wars is directly
[49:53.580 --> 50:05.340]  organic out of the dirt like a lily out of the Nile mud you are Moses that's what Moses
[50:05.340 --> 50:12.780]  is after Egyptian word for Lily in the mud you are that you are Moses you are George
[50:12.780 --> 50:18.620]  Washington you are Paul Revere you are Thomas Jefferson you you you you you you you're black
[50:18.620 --> 50:21.900]  you're white you're old you're young you want a birthright of freedom and the right to self
[50:21.900 --> 50:29.340]  defense then you are an American stand for your birth right now and defend it I create
[50:29.340 --> 50:33.100]  the talking points more than anybody else in the resistance and it's the enemy knows
[50:33.100 --> 50:37.700]  that they've got transcripts and it's not about bragging it's about knowing what you
[50:37.700 --> 50:42.940]  funded and what you did and what you could do no matter what happens to us we don't
[50:42.940 --> 50:51.580]  take orders we give the orders we do the hanging I do the hanging it's not about a power trip
[50:51.580 --> 50:57.380]  I already knew this before they ever figured it out I flip below the radar there's no more
[50:57.380 --> 51:02.100]  below the radar now ladies and gentlemen and it's not because I'm that special I went and
[51:02.100 --> 51:06.580]  read their documents their founding thesis their programs I saw they were carrying them
[51:06.580 --> 51:12.980]  out I saw they were in charge I didn't want to be part of that I believed in you we built
[51:12.980 --> 51:19.100]  this the most lied to people are inside the government the most lied to people are inside
[51:19.100 --> 51:29.020]  intelligence agencies it's not like all the movies you see we're on the ground we see
[51:29.020 --> 51:32.780]  what's really going on we're where the crops are grown where the engines get fixed where
[51:32.780 --> 51:36.700]  the diapers get changed where the dinner gets cooked where the house gets cleaned where the
[51:36.700 --> 51:49.980]  cuts get stitched where the fighting gets done and the killing step into that office this is where
[51:49.980 --> 51:54.700]  the living and the dying happens this is where you come into the world you go out of the world
[51:56.220 --> 52:01.660]  this is where you live all the passions and go through the crises this is where you get strong
[52:01.660 --> 52:08.380]  this is what makes you who you are thank god then he put us here under this pressure so that we
[52:08.380 --> 52:16.060]  could experience this incredible reality that isn't a simulation but real our spirits jacked into
[52:16.060 --> 52:24.060]  this flesh suit that's an interface of all the people we were and all the people will be
[52:24.060 --> 52:28.300]  with our individual spirit in communion with our families and all their experiences
[52:28.300 --> 52:34.780]  them holding us us holding them and their desire for the future and to build the master plan that
[52:34.780 --> 52:40.780]  god has in store for us that's incredible and that is perfection in its impurity
[52:43.180 --> 52:46.540]  all right i didn't i'll get into what the great depression will look like in the death of the
[52:46.540 --> 52:51.500]  dollar of these enemies have the plan they're like running around with hangar and they pull
[52:51.500 --> 52:56.300]  the pins above themselves up hoping some of the shrapnel hits us i mean this is followers this is
[52:56.300 --> 53:02.060]  slaves doing this these are pathetic people don't let zuckerberg demoralize you he's a pathetic nobody
[53:02.060 --> 53:06.700]  all of them have been chosen because they're so weak and so spiritless they have no god in them
[53:06.700 --> 53:14.220]  nothing no connection to the father no connection it's all synthetic garbage mark zuckerberg's one
[53:14.220 --> 53:21.100]  of the poorest people on earth but they know you're rich spiritually that's why they want to make
[53:21.100 --> 53:26.780]  you poor so you don't have money to be free money is not worshiped like they worship it because it

[54:43.660 --> 54:49.100]  well mark zuckerberg on paper two weeks ago put in hundreds of millions of dollars with bloomberg
[54:49.660 --> 54:54.780]  to launch this operation red mirage to contest the election when it's overwhelmingly clear that
[54:54.780 --> 55:00.300]  trump has won on election night now he's come out the statement and told all the media in the
[55:00.300 --> 55:05.500]  united states they better get behind saying that trump basically lost that they're not going to let
[55:05.500 --> 55:10.060]  trump declare victory even though it's overwhelming they'll have 95 percent of the vote
[55:10.060 --> 55:14.540]  done election night and even if you added all the other votes in against him he'd be the winner
[55:14.540 --> 55:18.620]  they are going to steal this election they're preparing everyone you've seen all the scams
[55:18.620 --> 55:24.220]  they've already run trump is surrounded by tyrants but he has we the people and he has
[55:24.220 --> 55:29.660]  true media not independent media the real media so now more than ever it's critical to share the
[55:29.660 --> 55:34.620]  live streams the videos the articles and the information info wars dot com because the globalists
[55:34.620 --> 55:40.620]  fear it most because we were the first to expose their plan to contest the election and drag it out
[55:40.620 --> 55:46.380]  to keep the american people from re-electing president trump it sounds over the top when i go on
[55:46.380 --> 55:51.580]  air and i explained that the controllers of the planet want to carry out the extermination of the
[55:51.580 --> 55:58.380]  entire human population except for a few of what they call their new transcended silicon gods but
[55:58.380 --> 56:02.860]  that's really what they're now externalizing they're now taking what was in their textbooks and
[56:02.860 --> 56:07.660]  white papers 30 years ago and actually openly announcing it everywhere they're going from
[56:07.660 --> 56:12.220]  beta to operation and think about all these major corporations they tell you humans are
[56:12.220 --> 56:15.980]  harmful they tell you humans are a parasite they tell you that we've all got to be gotten rid of
[56:15.980 --> 56:20.460]  and then they won't let people see their old folks in nursing homes and then ship in covet to kill
[56:20.460 --> 56:27.020]  them that's all organizing as a beta test for larger operations and everything is a microcosm
[56:27.020 --> 56:32.540]  and a laboratory test of larger scalability of what they are now beginning to roll out
[56:32.540 --> 56:36.700]  look at how they're banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics they're absolutely
[56:36.700 --> 56:42.940]  essential to stop viral infections like over 19 this is all absolute information control this is
[56:42.940 --> 56:59.820]  beyond 1984 you're listening to the alex jones show
[56:59.820 --> 57:07.820]  rising up
[57:07.820 --> 57:14.380]  uh this full report is seven minutes two seconds long it's at man dot video it's very strong it's
[57:14.380 --> 57:18.620]  democrats confess to 2020 election theft we're only gonna air four minutes of it right now
[57:18.620 --> 57:23.580]  then i'm gonna come back i'm gonna be good boy just i'm pretty fired up today the spirit's strong
[57:23.580 --> 57:29.980]  today and it tends to do it at once i'm gonna try to be mechanical and cover all this when we come
[57:29.980 --> 57:34.700]  back but right now let's go to this report here it is one of the things that i think we
[57:34.700 --> 57:43.180]  we and and other media need to start doing is preparing the american people that there's nothing
[57:43.180 --> 57:48.860]  illegitimate about this election taking additional days or even weeks to make sure that all the
[57:48.860 --> 57:53.900]  votes are counted in fact that might be important to make sure that this is a legitimate and fair
[57:53.900 --> 57:59.100]  election the reason we talk about a red mirage is in fact because we believe that on election night
[57:59.100 --> 58:06.060]  we are going to see donald trump in a stronger position than the reality actually is we are
[58:06.060 --> 58:10.620]  sounding an alarm and saying that this is a very real possibility that the data is going to show
[58:10.620 --> 58:16.460]  an election night an incredible victory for donald trump you know joe biden should not concede under
[58:16.460 --> 58:24.620]  any circumstances because i think this is gonna drag out and eventually i do believe he will win
[58:24.620 --> 58:32.860]  if we don't give an inch and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is you have a
[58:32.860 --> 58:39.740]  result on election night where it appears that donald trump has won but a result after ballots are
[58:39.740 --> 58:46.540]  counted that show that joe biden has actually won that's right we essentially built a simulator
[58:46.540 --> 58:51.420]  where it's a sequence of sliders and you just pull those sliders to start seeing what the scenarios
[58:51.420 --> 58:55.180]  will show you what's it gonna look like on election night what's it gonna look like the day after
[58:55.180 --> 59:01.660]  the day after that the day after that so if one of the candidates in any of the races claims victory
[59:01.660 --> 59:09.100]  before there's a consensus result then we're going to add some informational context to that
[59:09.100 --> 59:15.500]  post directly saying that that there there's no consensus result yet we see in the data that
[59:15.500 --> 59:22.620]  twice as many voters intend to cast a ballot by mail than have ever before they are disproportionately
[59:23.180 --> 59:29.580]  joe biden supporters we might have the results saying something on the evening of november 3rd
[59:29.580 --> 59:34.380]  that it will not say the evening of november 10th my advice to joe biden and i've told the campaign
[59:34.380 --> 59:42.140]  this obviously is do not concede under any circumstances because i believe the other side
[59:42.140 --> 59:54.940]  is going to cheat and and sneak and the fact is whether he knows it yet or not he will be leaving
[59:55.660 --> 59:59.660]  just because he might not want to move out of the white house doesn't mean we won't have an
[59:59.660 --> 1:00:06.140]  inauguration ceremony to inaugurate a duly elected president of the united states but there is a
[1:00:06.140 --> 1:00:11.340]  process it has nothing to do with it the certain occupant of the white house doesn't feel like
[1:00:11.340 --> 1:00:17.580]  moving and has to be fumigated out of there because the presidency is the presidency it's not
[1:00:18.140 --> 1:00:24.060]  geography or location this president's going to try to steal this election this the guy who said
[1:00:24.060 --> 1:00:29.660]  that all mail-in ballots are fraudulent have you ever considered what would happen if the
[1:00:29.660 --> 1:00:35.580]  election result came out as you being the winner and trump refused to leave yes i have and i was so
[1:00:35.580 --> 1:00:42.220]  damn proud here you have four chiefs of staff coming out and ripping the skin off of trump and
[1:00:42.220 --> 1:00:49.580]  you have so many rank and file military personnel saying whoa we're not a military state this is
[1:00:49.580 --> 1:00:54.220]  not who we are i promise you i'm absolutely convinced they will escort him from the white
[1:00:54.220 --> 1:01:01.180]  house and with great dispatch it has been suggested that this is a trial run for the president of the
[1:01:01.180 --> 1:01:09.420]  united states who may be organizing uh to not accept uh what happens when we have the election
[1:01:09.420 --> 1:01:17.180]  if he's not elected is he going to pull out his military is he going to engage us he is already
[1:01:17.180 --> 1:01:23.740]  alluded to there may be a civil war if he's not reelected this is dangerous uh but what's really
[1:01:23.740 --> 1:01:29.020]  important when we come back is they've rolled out millions of their george soros armies those big
[1:01:29.020 --> 1:01:34.140]  women's marches those uh soros funded women's marches those pro-abortion marches we saw five
[1:01:34.140 --> 1:01:39.900]  million marching in dc four years ago they're getting ready to burn everything down i told this
[1:01:39.900 --> 1:01:45.420]  hostage good luck you dirty filthy commie losers you're gonna get your ass handed to you trash
[1:01:53.100 --> 1:01:56.860]  you've always had a pledge for me and it's that i'll come to you with the truth at least as good as
[1:01:56.860 --> 1:02:02.620]  my human temporal truth can get because as the bible says we all see through a rose-colored
[1:02:02.620 --> 1:02:08.300]  darkly kind of a foggy lens that distorts what we actually can perceive so that everything we do
[1:02:08.300 --> 1:02:13.260]  is actually a fallen sin everything we do is actually a twisted distortion of god's will
[1:02:13.260 --> 1:02:19.100]  so when i tell you the truth it's the best truth this fallen creature's got but i'll tell you it's
[1:02:19.100 --> 1:02:25.580]  all i got and when i tell you this country and the world is under major satanic threat you don't
[1:02:25.580 --> 1:02:30.300]  need me to tell you that you can look out the window you can look into your own family you can
[1:02:30.300 --> 1:02:35.740]  turn on the news you can see it but you've got this commitment i do recognize the truth of god
[1:02:35.740 --> 1:02:40.780]  so to you we're gonna win this fight it's gonna be hard and i want to keep info wars in the main
[1:02:40.780 --> 1:02:45.100]  position to fight and it only happens when you support what you've been doing so again i thank
[1:02:45.100 --> 1:02:50.380]  you but go to info wars store dot com buy the product spread the word because that's how we're
[1:02:50.380 --> 1:02:59.020]  gonna win again i thank you all
[1:02:59.020 --> 1:03:19.660]  so
[1:03:24.780 --> 1:03:25.980]  so we've got
[1:03:25.980 --> 1:03:34.460]  videos out every hour of people chanting death to america i guess no borders no walls no usa
[1:03:34.460 --> 1:03:40.300]  at all is not enough but just death to america has a nicer sound to it and i haven't even gotten
[1:03:40.300 --> 1:03:44.700]  into all the race war news i mean just one of the craziest part of the technocracy is the biggest
[1:03:44.700 --> 1:03:51.180]  video game sports maker of video games came out and they have a the game where colin cavern it's
[1:03:51.180 --> 1:03:58.620]  the best quarterback in the nfl i mean he used to all those games actually went off the real ratings
[1:03:58.620 --> 1:04:03.420]  he's a not a very good quarterback there's some great black quarterbacks but he's not even black
[1:04:03.420 --> 1:04:10.060]  anyways it's just it's just now he's he's rated better than any active playing quarterback
[1:04:10.060 --> 1:04:15.340]  in the nfl including black quarterbacks who are higher rated than him it's just everything's a fraud
[1:04:15.340 --> 1:04:23.260]  with silicon valley man the video games are just and again it's all a fraud and everyone's rejecting
[1:04:23.260 --> 1:04:29.260]  it so why does hollywood not care they're burning down why do video game makers hate the fact that
[1:04:29.260 --> 1:04:34.780]  they're having record low sales because of stuff like this because they work for the globalist
[1:04:34.780 --> 1:04:40.940]  that created thousands of trillions in fiat currency that they use to buy up companies
[1:04:40.940 --> 1:04:46.220]  and control everything but they never give the money to us because that would create inflation
[1:04:46.220 --> 1:04:54.700]  but they use it to buy up all the companies then they have board meetings at the highest levels
[1:04:54.700 --> 1:05:02.300]  at devos and others on record and they decide who can buy who and who can spend as much money on
[1:05:02.300 --> 1:05:08.860]  acquisition people like zuckerberg get told how big a jet he can have and how many houses and what he
[1:05:08.860 --> 1:05:16.300]  can buy by jp morgan chase golden sacks and others there's a front man he gets told by bill gates
[1:05:16.300 --> 1:05:21.420]  i mean bill gates has finally gotten the table of the round table at the highest levels and then his
[1:05:21.420 --> 1:05:34.540]  his his minion his his trainee his apprentice is jeff zuckerberg come on over dude what's up
[1:05:34.540 --> 1:05:42.220]  oh my earpiece has popped out i'm sorry it doesn't matter and everything's always popping i'm good i can
[1:05:42.220 --> 1:05:52.380]  fix it go ahead and fix it the point is is that all of this is happening and and and we sit here
[1:05:53.500 --> 1:05:59.340]  with these jerks that just in the last really hundred years since 1913 took over the american
[1:05:59.340 --> 1:06:07.260]  engine they've been siphoning our wealth off to shine on everywhere else to build it up
[1:06:07.820 --> 1:06:12.060]  and then now they don't even want us to have any of the wealth they want to dictate to us when we're
[1:06:12.060 --> 1:06:16.300]  totally poor and fighting with each other over what color we are and then they know there's a
[1:06:16.300 --> 1:06:20.140]  revolution against government a revolution against corruption revolution against the globalist
[1:06:20.140 --> 1:06:25.900]  through government oppressing us and rigging things so they pick the police in blue cities
[1:06:25.900 --> 1:06:33.180]  under democrat command so the police can't fight back to scapegoat blue collar workers police are
[1:06:33.180 --> 1:06:38.940]  blue collar folks they're the upper end of it they scapegoat blue collar workers
[1:06:41.660 --> 1:06:49.580]  outmanned outgunned as the demon and the revolution big mega banks offshore millions
[1:06:49.580 --> 1:06:55.660]  and slave camps in china apple heavily involved all of them and then they've got the nerve to have
[1:06:55.660 --> 1:07:03.420]  tim cook we've given a hundred million dollars oh hi we've given a hundred million dollars so
[1:07:03.420 --> 1:07:10.540]  black lives matter because we think it has value and are good people back yeah back it up let's just
[1:07:10.540 --> 1:07:16.220]  play what you had to say imagine he runs death camps but he's telling you he likes black people
[1:07:18.140 --> 1:07:25.260]  i mean this is all a sick cover for what they do here he is focus on issue beginning in the united
[1:07:25.260 --> 1:07:31.340]  states and expanding globally over time the initiative will challenge the systemic barriers
[1:07:31.340 --> 1:07:37.500]  to opportunity and dignity that exists for communities of color and particularly for the
[1:07:37.500 --> 1:07:44.860]  black community with special focus on issues of education economic equality and criminal justice
[1:07:44.860 --> 1:07:55.500]  reform so if you just type in apple biggest buyer of components made by weager slaves in real death
[1:07:55.500 --> 1:07:59.580]  camps i mean people debate whether hitler had death camps or not he had slave camps he killed
[1:07:59.580 --> 1:08:05.180]  people he did but china doesn't on a scale never before seen on record with hd drone footage and
[1:08:05.180 --> 1:08:10.380]  all the admissions three million muslims million christians million buddhas on average that's five
[1:08:10.380 --> 1:08:17.020]  million people being chewed up into a wood chipper but it's literally i don't care that tim cook likes
[1:08:17.020 --> 1:08:22.860]  dingaling okay i'm not mad at him because he's a homosexual i'm mad at him that he hides behind it
[1:08:22.860 --> 1:08:30.300]  with a lisp and his big act and all of his garbage while he literally is the biggest buyer of components
[1:08:30.300 --> 1:08:36.540]  from death camps apple nike and other companies implicated in muslim forced labor in china think
[1:08:36.540 --> 1:08:42.220]  about that do i want giant muslim hordes brought in by george soros literally trained to try to
[1:08:42.220 --> 1:08:47.900]  take our daughters and enslave us and and and burn everything down no that's the middle eastern muslims
[1:08:47.900 --> 1:08:53.580]  brainwashed by the globalists the north africans but do i want to take anybody black white muslim
[1:08:53.580 --> 1:09:00.780]  christian and put them in death camps no no no two wrongs don't make a right they are and those
[1:09:00.780 --> 1:09:06.620]  wiggers are very nonviolent very good people you know the muslims came in and took over central asia
[1:09:06.620 --> 1:09:10.940]  they kind of picked it up as a religion they're like muslim life the point is is that if they could be
[1:09:10.940 --> 1:09:16.060]  al qaeda don't take their women and children and put three million in death camps
[1:09:18.860 --> 1:09:24.380]  and trump has criticized it when democrats won't so again that's what i'm getting at is the hypocrisy
[1:09:24.380 --> 1:09:32.060]  is is insane but tim cook says i deserve to be off air because i'm a bad person
[1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:38.860]  he curated me he led the move to have me deplatformed and he told jiji ping four years ago in a
[1:09:38.860 --> 1:09:46.940]  speech he gave that he supports censorship and now in the year 2020 he runs the contracts at death
[1:09:46.940 --> 1:09:53.900]  camps at death camps and the average liberals like we don't want trump leaving afghanistan and
[1:09:53.900 --> 1:10:00.220]  syria he's helping terrorist oh we don't want to do anything to china about the three million
[1:10:00.220 --> 1:10:08.220]  muslims in death camps oh but collin cappernick as soon as he got his night contract i love afros
[1:10:08.220 --> 1:10:13.340]  if you got an afro haircut he did never have one he had cornrows he bozos this big big thing out
[1:10:14.460 --> 1:10:21.260]  search wearing kutakente shirts and talking about african pride while he doesn't say a damn thing
[1:10:21.260 --> 1:10:29.820]  about 22 plus million black people upwards of 70 percent since 1974 the year i was born not making
[1:10:29.820 --> 1:10:36.540]  it out of their mama's guts that's not a virtue signal i'm out here kissing black people's ass i
[1:10:36.540 --> 1:10:40.220]  don't owe you anything i just owe you the truth like i owe anybody else the truth i care about
[1:10:40.220 --> 1:10:44.380]  everybody but i'm not going to kiss your ass if you won't stand up for yourself with that bozo
[1:10:44.380 --> 1:10:49.580]  the clown when night's got slave camps killing people but oh look there oh he's oh don't worry
[1:10:49.580 --> 1:10:55.100]  about night slave camps night you oh no we got bozo the clown here man with a kutakente shirt
[1:10:58.300 --> 1:11:04.860]  it's a joke it's a sick evil joke they're using him as a cover for all the evil they're involved in
[1:11:08.940 --> 1:11:12.700]  doesn't matter he's the top rated quarterback in the nfl according to stats now
[1:11:12.700 --> 1:11:20.140]  now in the video games i mean it's all fraud it's all scams it's all a joke and it goes on
[1:11:20.140 --> 1:11:32.940]  and on and on and on and on so we're sitting here now there's collin cavernet
[1:11:34.540 --> 1:11:40.780]  with the white family that adopted him and of course they're left as they love the anti-white
[1:11:40.780 --> 1:11:46.460]  stuff because that's an elitism that's the ultra rich powerful whites organizing all the brown people
[1:11:46.460 --> 1:11:52.220]  who are the majority to go in warfare and destroy the middle class that they label as white to complete
[1:11:52.220 --> 1:12:00.380]  the dominance to complete the takeover that's all it is is cold blooded evil in fact the greatest
[1:12:00.380 --> 1:12:05.980]  nazi there would be a real nazi a real race-based person winning race war and winning racial identity
[1:12:05.980 --> 1:12:11.340]  it's collin cavernet for pr purposes and all of it he's the greatest nazi and then if you
[1:12:11.340 --> 1:12:15.340]  want to talk about black folks you know he's the greatest so-called black guy that's closest to
[1:12:15.340 --> 1:12:18.860]  hitler who's closest to christ i'm not comparing him to christ i'm saying who's the closest to that
[1:12:18.860 --> 1:12:23.500]  it'd be a kanya west don't kill your babies no matter what color they are come together love god
[1:12:23.500 --> 1:12:28.860]  and he's fighting the system meanwhile you got a real black guy fighting bozo the clown over here
[1:12:29.580 --> 1:12:33.500]  does kanya need to get a bozo the clown haircut to prove he's black though because he's black
[1:12:33.500 --> 1:12:41.260]  and collin cavernet is is a nobody that works for the man the real evil to exterminate and
[1:12:41.260 --> 1:12:47.020]  enslave black people and all you suckers about out to him deserve what you get he wants get black
[1:12:47.020 --> 1:12:57.180]  babies he wants to kill you ignorance does not equal bliss ignorance equals slavery if you're
[1:12:57.180 --> 1:13:02.140]  ignorant walking through a field at night that there's a six-foot hole up ahead you're gonna step
[1:13:02.140 --> 1:13:07.100]  in it and probably break your ankle or maybe worse well it's the same thing happening to human
[1:13:07.100 --> 1:13:13.020]  civilization the industrialized age really empowered humanity in many respects but also took
[1:13:13.020 --> 1:13:18.220]  us away from the land made us very very domesticated and very very easy to manipulate and now corruption
[1:13:18.220 --> 1:13:22.780]  and predatory activity can hide behind that complexity now i know what's going on behind
[1:13:22.780 --> 1:13:27.980]  the complexity because i go read what the un and the rockfeller foundation and the davos group and
[1:13:27.980 --> 1:13:34.860]  the boulder group and all their subsidiaries what the club of rome say so i know exactly what's
[1:13:34.860 --> 1:13:41.100]  going on not because i'm even that cool or special a person but i'm actually want to be empowered
[1:13:41.100 --> 1:13:45.740]  and informed because i'm a history buff i know that those that don't know history don't repeat it
[1:13:45.740 --> 1:13:49.580]  the globalists think you're stupid they laugh at you because you won't research their own admissions
[1:13:50.620 --> 1:13:56.700]  they ever wondered why big tech acts in unison to create monopolies and aren't so incredibly
[1:13:56.700 --> 1:14:02.940]  anti-human love to censor people love to cover up for corrupt authoritarian regimes and dictatorships
[1:14:02.940 --> 1:14:07.660]  well it's very simple the first computers ever created were created by thomas watson the founder
[1:14:07.660 --> 1:14:12.780]  and owner of ibm to carry out eugenics and they helped run the death camps in nazi germany that's
[1:14:12.780 --> 1:14:18.060]  what the tattoos were on the slaves arms it would decide who lived and who died so from the beginning
[1:14:18.060 --> 1:14:23.980]  it's been about creating monopolies cornering markets and making humans obsolete the same people
[1:14:23.980 --> 1:14:28.380]  brought us baby formula that doesn't have enough protein fat in it to make your child's brain small
[1:14:28.380 --> 1:14:33.100]  the same people that said put babies in cribs separate from their mothers the lower IQs about
[1:14:33.100 --> 1:14:38.220]  20 points on average as well these are hardcore eugenicists survival of the fittest social
[1:14:38.220 --> 1:14:43.980]  Darwinists grow up world admit the truth with being soft as much and letting these globalists run
[1:14:43.980 --> 1:14:54.140]  their lives they are your mortal enemy they want you dead do you understand that you're listening
[1:14:54.140 --> 1:15:13.100]  to the alex jones show coming to you from deep in the heart of texas you're listening to the
[1:15:13.100 --> 1:15:24.940]  alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind that is the interface for your soul
[1:15:27.100 --> 1:15:33.580]  before we go next level we got to get past the ai for howl nine thousand we will
[1:15:35.100 --> 1:15:36.540]  and then we shall be reborn
[1:15:36.540 --> 1:15:45.420]  the establishment doesn't want you to be part of that as if they could ever
[1:15:48.060 --> 1:15:48.940]  go to the next level
[1:15:52.300 --> 1:15:57.900]  in their selfishness they destroyed the bridge love would have carried them to the stars of
[1:15:57.900 --> 1:16:05.980]  Valhalla and beyond all right by the way alex jones here back live since we're talking about all
[1:16:05.980 --> 1:16:13.500]  this i forgot disney's one of the worst groups actually thanking death camp operators disney
[1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:20.620]  under fire as a cnbc for moulin credits that think chinese groups linked to detention camp
[1:16:20.620 --> 1:16:28.540]  operations well of course i mean you got to run a death camp or round up some people you know
[1:16:28.540 --> 1:16:33.340]  in your cred sheet like soros did you don't get a job with these people and the more exploitive
[1:16:33.340 --> 1:16:39.740]  the more horrible the more systematic the better it is for a tim cook or a jeff zuckerburton
[1:16:41.180 --> 1:16:45.180]  far left group predicts info wars will dox joe byard i already mentioned that but
[1:16:45.180 --> 1:16:48.940]  it just gets so crazy now let's get into all these articles georgia
[1:16:50.540 --> 1:16:55.420]  one thousand people illegally voted twice during primary elections using absentee ballots
[1:16:56.300 --> 1:17:01.340]  and i read what the state official over this said he looked into it that was a sampling
[1:17:01.340 --> 1:17:06.780]  and they found a thousand videos up on info wars dot com georgia secretary of state
[1:17:07.340 --> 1:17:15.180]  brad raffin springer confirmed that at least one thousand georgian votes twice in the state's
[1:17:15.180 --> 1:17:19.980]  june 9th primary oh and guess who they mainly were i think you can guess what party cheats a lot
[1:17:22.300 --> 1:17:26.060]  i mean the media says trump people are riding everywhere of course the media lies we know
[1:17:26.060 --> 1:17:31.660]  who's riding we know who cheats meanwhile other info wars dot com article democrats panic admit
[1:17:31.660 --> 1:17:37.340]  they are losing the election call for end of electoral college well don't worry that's just
[1:17:37.340 --> 1:17:42.300]  a talking point of Pelosi even if it's clear that they can't stop the ballot boxes with the 80 million
[1:17:42.300 --> 1:17:45.980]  it can't hold it up a few weeks which they say they're gonna do and no one's allowed to say that
[1:17:45.980 --> 1:17:50.620]  trump won even though the numbers show he did zuckerburton said so i mean he's like god he's
[1:17:50.620 --> 1:17:55.180]  up there you have to get him first then it's you know you look through the bees behind the burning bush
[1:17:57.580 --> 1:18:03.020]  then he tells you what you can do even they say if that is clear that they lost they're just gonna
[1:18:03.020 --> 1:18:08.140]  say oh we won the popular vote and they can pull that off then at the blue cities of blue states
[1:18:08.140 --> 1:18:12.940]  just count endless fake ballots and say they they won that and of course studies came out showing
[1:18:12.940 --> 1:18:17.580]  at least six million people voted illegally trump only lost by three million votes the popular vote
[1:18:17.580 --> 1:18:21.420]  vote so he won by three million of course he did probably won one more than that
[1:18:23.260 --> 1:18:29.100]  i'm worried this is joy bayhard i'm worried that trump could pull this off bayhard said
[1:18:29.820 --> 1:18:35.980]  let me speak to her voice i'm worried that trump could pull this off we see the polls and we see
[1:18:35.980 --> 1:18:43.500]  biden is leading but russian interference is live and kicking facebook is continuing to leave
[1:18:43.500 --> 1:18:51.340]  all the lies on the page postal service is being interfered with electoral college is an issue
[1:18:51.340 --> 1:18:56.860]  and a problem in the history of united states there were four presidents who won the popular vote
[1:18:56.860 --> 1:19:03.340]  because of electoral college bayhard continued bayhard then claimed the electoral college
[1:19:03.980 --> 1:19:08.620]  rather than popular vote gives a handful of states the power to choose the president
[1:19:08.620 --> 1:19:13.740]  with in fact the opposite is true i think it's ridiculous that a few states a handful of states
[1:19:13.740 --> 1:19:19.500]  determine my future it's ridiculous so they bother voting in the rest of the country need to change
[1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:25.740]  the electoral college it's barely a few percentage points and it's meant so texas in new york and
[1:19:25.740 --> 1:19:34.860]  california don't make indiana georgia arkansas colorada south dakota north dakota i don't do what
[1:19:34.860 --> 1:19:41.100]  we want that's why you have the popular vote with the congressman the house members and the
[1:19:41.100 --> 1:19:44.220]  senate used to be the legislatures but now they took that away may that a popular vote
[1:19:45.260 --> 1:19:51.740]  making senators their own imperium let's continue
[1:19:56.460 --> 1:20:01.820]  wow there's so many of these where should we start oh yeah numbers show that uh in florida
[1:20:01.820 --> 1:20:08.140]  um hispanics are gonna vote for trump and the majority and i always like this headline i just
[1:20:08.140 --> 1:20:12.460]  noticed pr i remember warren buffett there ran all sorts of corrupt money laundering operations
[1:20:12.460 --> 1:20:17.660]  it's a super evil guy but he always poses with an ice cream cone in almost all his photos i was
[1:20:17.660 --> 1:20:22.380]  like oh ice cream cone and biden does that too because they know statistically it's non-threatening
[1:20:22.380 --> 1:20:29.580]  well olymp must have an ice cream cone and so here's the article obama and kamala harris
[1:20:29.580 --> 1:20:38.540]  discussed joe biden's ice cream fetish ignore substantive issues now now again i later found
[1:20:38.540 --> 1:20:42.300]  the psychological warfare it mentions admitting they do that but i could just tell they were doing it
[1:20:42.860 --> 1:20:49.820]  did you see when hillary lost the election two days after and they had surge brinn and they had
[1:20:49.820 --> 1:20:55.660]  larry page and all the google scum up there and they've got their main tech people and they're all
[1:20:55.660 --> 1:21:03.900]  wearing rainbow colored dunce hats with helicopters on top meaning we're idiots we're non-threatening

[1:29:38.220 --> 1:29:44.460]  into this now i know the general audience is as smart as i am or smarter and but for new new
[1:29:44.460 --> 1:29:49.580]  listeners and new viewers i want to explain something there's a whole cottage industry
[1:29:50.220 --> 1:29:56.220]  out there to talk about how we've gotten into too much debt and how we've devalued the dollar
[1:29:56.220 --> 1:30:00.700]  and how america's done and how the dollar is going to go belly up and you notice they started
[1:30:00.700 --> 1:30:05.020]  that with a lot of conservatives and so-called individuals on the internet who are really heavily
[1:30:05.020 --> 1:30:11.500]  invested in communist china yes we've devalued the dollar but we have the world reserve currency
[1:30:11.500 --> 1:30:17.500]  still china has way more devalued their internal and external currencies the yawn and the yen
[1:30:18.460 --> 1:30:24.460]  the eu has way more devalued this is on record they don't deny this their currency and and they're
[1:30:24.460 --> 1:30:31.260]  not the global currency so to have wall street globalists and the media all saying they're bearish
[1:30:31.260 --> 1:30:37.420]  on the stock market they're bearish on the dollar and they think it's the end of the dollar and
[1:30:37.420 --> 1:30:43.740]  soros has always wanted to mount the dollar on his wall before he dies and boy he looks like his
[1:30:43.740 --> 1:30:49.340]  expiration date was up a hundred years ago and so they're out there all over the news and paying
[1:30:49.340 --> 1:30:53.260]  pundits and i mean because i've been offered the money you know oh here's an advertisement group
[1:30:53.260 --> 1:30:58.940]  that wants you to say this i'm like no we don't do that oh push this newsletter do that and it's
[1:30:58.940 --> 1:31:04.460]  all america dominance is over america sucks china's the future invest in this the dollar's gonna die
[1:31:06.220 --> 1:31:15.660]  and so this has been going on for a long long long time so yes we've over devalued yes america has
[1:31:15.660 --> 1:31:20.940]  problems yes we're in too much debt but compared to other countries we have the world reserve
[1:31:20.940 --> 1:31:29.340]  if we lose the world reserve then all of those debts are magnified we don't have political power
[1:31:29.340 --> 1:31:34.460]  anymore we don't have military power to a great extent we don't have the power to buy the goods
[1:31:34.460 --> 1:31:39.340]  and services we need when we've been positioned that oh under globalism make china the manufacturer
[1:31:39.340 --> 1:31:44.140]  but you control the currency well china and the globalist double cross that so china was supposed
[1:31:44.140 --> 1:31:47.900]  to balance power in the globalist system was all lie to sell the middle level academics on it
[1:31:47.900 --> 1:31:54.220]  where they let us be the military they became economic power they got the reverse men roles they
[1:31:54.220 --> 1:31:59.340]  control manufacturing it was all agreed upon these big global councils china and the people
[1:31:59.340 --> 1:32:06.060]  they work with that sold us out to china promptly double crossed all that during the obama administration
[1:32:06.620 --> 1:32:11.420]  and chinese spies in the obama administration transferred in the office of personnel management
[1:32:11.420 --> 1:32:19.900]  hack 20 plus million 22 plus million of all the family members and histories and databases
[1:32:19.900 --> 1:32:25.900]  of every federal employee including 18 intelligence agencies the keys to the kingdom
[1:32:31.580 --> 1:32:37.100]  and that's why you see biden up there five years ago before trump got in saying
[1:32:37.100 --> 1:32:43.740]  we are under china's control they should dictate every aspect of our culture
[1:32:45.260 --> 1:32:49.180]  maybe we'll play it in a minute they got the clip you can see it right there on screen
[1:32:49.180 --> 1:32:55.980]  that's why polosi came out and said yes china wants biden yesterday their big national paper said
[1:32:55.980 --> 1:33:04.540]  joe biden is mirroring us what was the exact quote joe biden and his political and and cultural
[1:33:04.540 --> 1:33:09.340]  views mirror ours what was the exact word i covered yes staff forget i'm having one of those
[1:33:09.340 --> 1:33:14.300]  threats moments or not even it's ocd moments i've got to have the exact headline official chinese
[1:33:14.300 --> 1:33:24.460]  communist national paper brags that joe biden is simpatico with them dancing with them that his
[1:33:24.460 --> 1:33:33.180]  agenda mirrors their agenda exactly there's never been such trees and spoken if they were a wonderful
[1:33:33.180 --> 1:33:37.020]  country with freedom and stuff we'd say that's wrong you don't take our government over it's a
[1:33:37.020 --> 1:33:45.980]  horrible murderous regime so do you know what the death of the dollar looks like it looks like total
[1:33:45.980 --> 1:33:52.380]  slavery property values imploding everything going to near zero absolute depression no goods and
[1:33:52.380 --> 1:33:58.380]  services no food the breakdown of civilization and then the left and the global is coming with an
[1:33:58.380 --> 1:34:06.540]  emergency global new marshal plan they're calling it to have china bail us out like germany after
[1:34:06.540 --> 1:34:13.660]  world war one with a Versailles treaty and to dictate to us the terms of our surrender
[1:34:16.940 --> 1:34:22.940]  but what a headline out of the washington post gg ping must destroy trump to save america and
[1:34:22.940 --> 1:34:27.980]  then i'm having an ocd we've not had luck i'll look it up myself we don't have any luck on
[1:34:27.980 --> 1:34:35.340]  uh chinese national paper uh brags about biden that'll pull it up right there china brags biden
[1:34:35.340 --> 1:34:39.020]  will pull it i'll pull it up for you right now not mad not matters i have to have it so you know
[1:34:41.420 --> 1:34:46.140]  china paper brags biden
[1:34:52.140 --> 1:34:55.580]  joe biden on video bragging about china relationships and chinese helped to win
[1:34:55.580 --> 1:35:02.860]  try duck duck go and see if it comes up on there but i don't have to tell you they're all on record
[1:35:02.860 --> 1:35:07.660]  saying that they're all on record doing that this is who they are yes they stack i have to have it
[1:35:07.660 --> 1:35:13.500]  bring in if they stack i have to have it give me yes they stack i'll pull it so that's the point
[1:35:13.500 --> 1:35:21.660]  all this has gotten to and they just think you're gonna sit there and take it so i want you to know
[1:35:21.660 --> 1:35:27.100]  that the democrats have said when trump wins they're going to hold up the election burn down the
[1:35:27.100 --> 1:35:31.020]  cities and try to crash the economy i showed you that the last two segments and that they're the
[1:35:31.020 --> 1:35:35.660]  ones openly behind it while they say they've got to go out and burn everything down because trump
[1:35:35.660 --> 1:35:45.260]  is violent and trump is planning all this and the official national communist paper of china
[1:35:45.260 --> 1:35:53.020]  comes out and endorses and quote brags that joe biden is completely synced up with everything
[1:35:53.020 --> 1:35:56.940]  they're doing and everything he's involved in that's why president trump came out and said
[1:35:56.940 --> 1:36:01.500]  if you're for joe biden you're for communist china and not their people but the horrible evil
[1:36:01.500 --> 1:36:06.300]  communist party that the same globalists couldn't get control of america but they could use american
[1:36:06.300 --> 1:36:12.860]  power to put mouse a tongue into control i put a chess board out here and i'll talk about it
[1:36:12.860 --> 1:36:17.580]  next segment but i just want americans to know there's a game going on in its life and death
[1:36:17.580 --> 1:36:21.580]  just be aware of the game they want to tell you being in politically informed as a conspiracy
[1:36:21.580 --> 1:36:26.620]  theory they treat you like you're an idiot you're not an idiot and you deserve freedom so do i and
[1:36:26.620 --> 1:36:31.420]  we're gonna do it together by the way my buddy shane steiner flew his helicopter around trust

[1:40:06.620 --> 1:40:11.820]  are saying they have reasons to sell this garbage to the general public but if you just scratch the
[1:40:11.820 --> 1:40:18.060]  surface they're so arrogant they've all written to tell blueprints of this plan and more and more
[1:40:18.060 --> 1:40:24.540]  being honest about it because there comes a point where as david ike says they have to stop hiding it

[1:42:57.500 --> 1:43:02.220]  involved in every aspect of our lives means a party they've wedded to and then we've got
[1:43:02.220 --> 1:43:06.780]  to pelosi just a few weeks ago admitting that uh china wants biden well we know the chinese

[1:43:19.980 --> 1:43:26.860]  us china relationship has also improved dramatically in the past 30 years in order to cement this
[1:43:26.860 --> 1:43:33.420]  robust partnership we have to go beyond close ties between washington and beijing which we're
[1:43:33.420 --> 1:43:40.460]  working on every day go beyond it to include all levels of government go beyond it to include
[1:43:40.460 --> 1:43:46.620]  classrooms and laboratories athletic fields and board room oh i need to say what what these what
[1:43:46.620 --> 1:43:52.300]  they said is china would prefer joe biden whether they do that's their conclusion that they would
[1:43:52.300 --> 1:43:58.060]  prefer joe biden so there you go meanwhile to undermine our military in our country here's
[1:43:58.060 --> 1:44:03.180]  some of the headlines we've got right here obama era pentagon training manual attacks white men
[1:44:03.180 --> 1:44:10.220]  as inherently bad madden 21 to feature colony cavernic has higher rating than half of nfl

[1:45:16.220 --> 1:45:20.060]  who was convicted of all those crimes he's not the same guy he looks like him
[1:45:20.060 --> 1:45:21.900]  in cano show let's go ahead and roll this video
[1:45:25.100 --> 1:45:29.500]  what did you just say what did you say to him i said to do something no what did you say after
[1:45:29.500 --> 1:45:34.780]  that nigga with a so with a so you're here for black lives matters but you're using the n word

[1:45:40.300 --> 1:45:45.100]  black lives matters you really honestly live in america in 2020 unbelievable you don't know the
[1:45:45.100 --> 1:45:49.820]  difference between a hard er on the end of the n word and an a so you're saying white people can
[1:45:49.820 --> 1:45:55.100]  say that white i just did oh this guy right here interesting and you know which white guy specifically
[1:45:55.100 --> 1:45:58.700]  the one who's been standing over there for hours holding a black lives matter sign so that means

[1:46:03.580 --> 1:46:07.500]  the one holding a blm sign and using the n word announcing how he hates whites wrap that together
[1:46:07.500 --> 1:46:12.460]  have you never listened to rap music there's probably i would guess that there are 320 million
[1:46:12.460 --> 1:46:18.140]  people in the united states yeah probably 319 million of them have heard rap music at some point
[1:46:18.140 --> 1:46:22.140]  have you not so that means we can say whatever rap music that means we can say whatever in your
[1:46:22.140 --> 1:46:26.540]  life that means we can say whatever you heard rap music so then you know the difference between an
[1:46:26.540 --> 1:46:32.380]  a on the end of that word and an er i'd love to see what people like you say oh really you say
[1:46:32.380 --> 1:46:36.540]  stuff like that yeah you have no idea what i'm the weird or you're in fact the last thing tries to
[1:46:37.260 --> 1:46:45.020]  trick the guy to hitting friends to hitting you goofy that's dumb ass that shows our trump
[1:46:45.020 --> 1:46:50.300]  supporter wherever you are what did you say the n word with an a on the end have you honestly never
[1:46:50.300 --> 1:46:53.900]  heard that you've never listened to rap music it's very curious black people just very curious
[1:46:53.900 --> 1:46:58.220]  you really don't have a point here you're just running your mouth you stupid white guy
[1:47:03.020 --> 1:47:07.340]  now there's so many videos coming out we can't even keep track of them all but i've got a black
[1:47:07.340 --> 1:47:12.540]  lives matter protester assaults a black store manager in pittsburgh pa after mobbing his
[1:47:12.540 --> 1:47:17.340]  mcdonald's we have another footage of a lady drinking a guy's beer and they attack a white
[1:47:17.340 --> 1:47:24.060]  guy with a megaphone when he fights back they beat him up these are racial attacks now happening and
[1:47:24.060 --> 1:47:28.860]  this is what george soros on record just bit 200 plus million dollars just this month to fund this
[1:47:28.860 --> 1:47:52.860]  group to do this like go ahead and play those clips
[1:47:59.020 --> 1:48:09.900]  now again we're going to play more of these clips for you in a moment but this is all meant
[1:48:09.900 --> 1:48:14.700]  to trigger a civil war and to make it not about globalist and foreign banks and the chai comms
[1:48:14.700 --> 1:48:18.620]  but black against white they want black people to be the cover for this so they're sitting in
[1:48:18.620 --> 1:48:22.620]  leftist everywhere to try to trick black people into doing this that's in their own documents
[1:48:22.620 --> 1:48:29.980]  police post three years ago obama planned marshal on maryland 2015 with alton senator soros
[1:48:30.780 --> 1:48:35.900]  and we got more of this footage coming up for you next hour but let me now go ahead and get to

[1:50:27.740 --> 1:50:32.380]  flashlight with a dying battery clip three i want to loop that for the last minute let's go and roll
[1:50:32.380 --> 1:50:40.860]  it flashlight with a dying battery and going for a long hike in the woods it is not going to work
[1:50:40.860 --> 1:50:49.260]  out it's not going to make it biden to me is like having a flashlight with a dying battery and going
[1:50:49.260 --> 1:50:58.220]  for a long hike in the woods it is not going to work out it's not gonna make it i didn't to me
[1:50:58.220 --> 1:51:06.300]  is like having a flashlight with a dying battery and going for a long hike in the woods it is not
[1:51:06.300 --> 1:51:13.820]  going to work out it's not going to make it i didn't to me is like having a flashlight with
[1:51:13.820 --> 1:51:18.340]  with a dying battery and going for a long hike in the woods.
[1:51:18.340 --> 1:51:21.180]  It is not going to work out.
[1:51:21.180 --> 1:51:23.700]  It's not going to make it.
[1:51:23.700 --> 1:51:26.940]  Iden to me is like having a flashlight
[1:51:26.940 --> 1:51:31.500]  with a dying battery and going for a long hike in the woods.
[1:51:31.500 --> 1:51:33.780]  It is not going to work out.
[1:51:38.140 --> 1:51:41.380]  It couldn't have been scripted any better.
[1:51:41.380 --> 1:51:43.980]  And that's because it was completely scripted.
[1:51:43.980 --> 1:51:47.540]  And we even know the names of the United Nations
[1:51:47.540 --> 1:51:49.940]  Rockefeller Foundation, Bill Mullen Decades,
[1:51:49.940 --> 1:51:52.380]  and John Hopkins Toppings.
[1:51:52.380 --> 1:51:56.060]  We have the script, just like you'd have for a Hollywood movie.
[1:51:56.060 --> 1:51:58.420]  And it's designed to free civilization
[1:51:58.420 --> 1:52:04.860]  and have a post-Renaissance stagnation or new dark age
[1:52:04.860 --> 1:52:07.500]  and a total consolidation of all wealth and power
[1:52:07.500 --> 1:52:11.260]  in the hands of the kleptocratic post-humanist.
[1:52:11.260 --> 1:52:13.380]  The magnitude of this is unfathomable.
[1:52:13.380 --> 1:52:16.100]  But you can see all the checkboxes of tyranny
[1:52:16.100 --> 1:52:17.420]  are being marked carefully.
[1:52:17.420 --> 1:52:19.940]  Every high dotted, every T crossed,
[1:52:19.940 --> 1:52:22.860]  a total societal vertical integration takeover,
[1:52:22.860 --> 1:52:24.700]  medical tyranny, total surveillance.
[1:52:24.700 --> 1:52:27.060]  The big tech heads, on average, have had their wealth cook up
[1:52:27.060 --> 1:52:29.060]  35% in the last eight months.
[1:52:29.060 --> 1:52:31.820]  And of course, Jeff Bezos has basically doubled his.
[1:52:31.820 --> 1:52:33.660]  Everyone is being forced out of their system
[1:52:33.660 --> 1:52:35.380]  to post-human robot takeover.
[1:52:35.380 --> 1:52:36.420]  You're being made obsolete.
[1:52:36.420 --> 1:52:40.460]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled
[1:52:40.460 --> 1:52:43.660]  by wireless internet commands.
[1:52:43.660 --> 1:52:45.660]  But if you were a person just 200 years ago
[1:52:45.660 --> 1:52:47.660]  and you saw that, you think it was magic.
[1:52:47.660 --> 1:52:49.660]  You wouldn't even know really what the machines were
[1:52:49.660 --> 1:52:51.660]  or what was controlling them.
[1:52:51.660 --> 1:52:53.660]  So for that person, it would be spiritual
[1:52:53.660 --> 1:52:55.660]  or it would be something of a spirit.
[1:52:55.660 --> 1:52:59.060]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies
[1:52:59.060 --> 1:53:00.420]  of many other species of animal
[1:53:00.420 --> 1:53:02.420]  now how to fly thousands and thousands of miles
[1:53:02.420 --> 1:53:04.420]  back to the exact place they were.
[1:53:04.420 --> 1:53:06.420]  They're following magnetic lines.
[1:53:06.420 --> 1:53:08.420]  They have magnetic cells in their brains.
[1:53:08.420 --> 1:53:10.420]  We now know how scientific what's going on.
[1:53:10.420 --> 1:53:12.420]  There's even a lot more than that.
[1:53:12.420 --> 1:53:14.420]  So when we talk about the spirit,
[1:53:14.420 --> 1:53:16.420]  we're talking about all the dark matter.
[1:53:16.420 --> 1:53:18.420]  We're talking about all the things you don't understand,
[1:53:18.420 --> 1:53:20.420]  but we know it's there.
[1:53:20.420 --> 1:53:22.420]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots
[1:53:22.420 --> 1:53:24.420]  working off the wireless system,
[1:53:24.420 --> 1:53:26.420]  that's what's going on with this satanic transmission
[1:53:26.420 --> 1:53:28.420]  that's working through people.
[1:53:28.420 --> 1:53:30.420]  And that's how this entity behind it all
[1:53:30.420 --> 1:53:32.420]  is able to direct it because it is a
[1:53:32.420 --> 1:53:35.420]  consciousness manipulative of the space-time continuum.
[1:53:35.420 --> 1:53:59.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:59.420 --> 1:54:01.420]  I have the clip, not the cruise fault.
[1:54:01.420 --> 1:54:04.420]  I sent too many clips of racial attacks on white people.
[1:54:04.420 --> 1:54:06.420]  They found the clip. I'll play it in the next segment.
[1:54:08.420 --> 1:54:10.420]  Give me back my bullets.
[1:54:16.420 --> 1:54:17.420]  Radio looks to stand here.
[1:54:17.420 --> 1:54:19.420]  There's like giant thunder blast going on.
[1:54:20.420 --> 1:54:22.420]  Let me pull up Austin right off, folks.
[1:54:23.420 --> 1:54:25.420]  Give me back my bullets.
[1:54:26.420 --> 1:54:28.420]  This guy's great. Sky News host.
[1:54:28.420 --> 1:54:30.420]  Leads resistance against COVID-19 scam.
[1:54:30.420 --> 1:54:32.420]  I kept Daniel's article on M4Wars.com,
[1:54:32.420 --> 1:54:34.420]  NewsWars.com. The only way these videos get out
[1:54:34.420 --> 1:54:36.420]  is you spread the word.
[1:54:36.420 --> 1:54:38.420]  The first clip I want to play,
[1:54:38.420 --> 1:54:40.420]  because it gets going after a while,
[1:54:40.420 --> 1:54:42.420]  is the one on
[1:54:42.420 --> 1:54:44.420]  this country's a mess.
[1:54:44.420 --> 1:54:46.420]  We'll air a few minutes of that
[1:54:46.420 --> 1:54:48.420]  and a few minutes of communism's knocking on the door.
[1:54:48.420 --> 1:54:50.420]  But these are all like nine-minute reports.
[1:54:50.420 --> 1:54:52.420]  They're up on M4Wars.com. You need to share them.
[1:54:52.420 --> 1:54:54.420]  And then Shane Steiner's coming into the studio
[1:54:54.420 --> 1:54:56.420]  with the Trump flotilla
[1:54:56.420 --> 1:54:58.420]  and the Trump Air Force.
[1:54:58.420 --> 1:55:00.420]  So stay with us.
[1:55:00.420 --> 1:55:02.420]  And this is a central issue here.
[1:55:02.420 --> 1:55:04.420]  These people are pretending to manage our health.
[1:55:04.420 --> 1:55:06.420]  What knowledge are they using
[1:55:06.420 --> 1:55:08.420]  that is superior to ours?
[1:55:08.420 --> 1:55:10.420]  Where's the evidence?
[1:55:10.420 --> 1:55:12.420]  Yesterday I raised a document from the Government's own
[1:55:12.420 --> 1:55:14.420]  Department of Health.
[1:55:14.420 --> 1:55:16.420]  Epidemiology report 22,
[1:55:16.420 --> 1:55:18.420]  the period ending August 2, which says,
[1:55:18.420 --> 1:55:20.420]  I quote, co-morbidities were common
[1:55:20.420 --> 1:55:22.420]  in those COVID-19 cases
[1:55:22.420 --> 1:55:24.420]  admitted to Australian hospitals,
[1:55:24.420 --> 1:55:26.420]  with 78%
[1:55:26.420 --> 1:55:28.420]  recording at least one of the specified
[1:55:28.420 --> 1:55:30.420]  co-morbidities. Only 9%
[1:55:30.420 --> 1:55:32.420]  recorded no
[1:55:32.420 --> 1:55:34.420]  co-morbidity.
[1:55:34.420 --> 1:55:36.420]  And as further said, the symptoms reported
[1:55:36.420 --> 1:55:38.420]  by COVID-19 cases in Australia
[1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:40.420]  are consistent with a mild
[1:55:40.420 --> 1:55:42.420]  respiratory infection in the majority
[1:55:42.420 --> 1:55:44.420]  of cases. There it is.
[1:55:44.420 --> 1:55:46.420]  9% recorded no
[1:55:46.420 --> 1:55:48.420]  co-morbidity.
[1:55:48.420 --> 1:55:50.420]  Even if we're up to 10%.
[1:55:50.420 --> 1:55:52.420]  That means if there are 770 deaths,
[1:55:52.420 --> 1:55:54.420]  only 77 have died
[1:55:54.420 --> 1:55:56.420]  from coronavirus alone.
[1:55:56.420 --> 1:55:58.420]  And I repeat, we've got only 29
[1:55:58.420 --> 1:56:00.420]  cases across Australia,
[1:56:00.420 --> 1:56:02.420]  serious or critical.
[1:56:02.420 --> 1:56:04.420]  And what have we got? An economy
[1:56:04.420 --> 1:56:06.420]  smashed. I met with New South Wales
[1:56:06.420 --> 1:56:08.420]  businessman today.
[1:56:08.420 --> 1:56:10.420]  Why can't all businesses open up?
[1:56:10.420 --> 1:56:12.420]  Where's the scientific evidence to suggest they can't?
[1:56:12.420 --> 1:56:14.420]  Where on the figures is anyone
[1:56:14.420 --> 1:56:16.420]  at risk? Why can't we say to the public,
[1:56:16.420 --> 1:56:18.420]  you look after your own health?
[1:56:18.420 --> 1:56:20.420]  The old, the vulnerable, the elderly,
[1:56:20.420 --> 1:56:22.420]  the indigenous, the people with co-morbidities,
[1:56:22.420 --> 1:56:24.420]  yes, we've got a hospital system
[1:56:24.420 --> 1:56:26.420]  to look after you, the rest
[1:56:26.420 --> 1:56:28.420]  get on with your lives. Why do we have
[1:56:28.420 --> 1:56:30.420]  children locked up and able to go to school?
[1:56:30.420 --> 1:56:32.420]  Why are 5.5 million
[1:56:32.420 --> 1:56:34.420]  Melbourneians living like battery hens?
[1:56:34.420 --> 1:56:36.420]  6.5
[1:56:36.420 --> 1:56:38.420]  million Victorians, paying for the
[1:56:38.420 --> 1:56:40.420]  stupidity and arrogance of Daniel
[1:56:40.420 --> 1:56:42.420]  Andrews. He should have resigned long ago.
[1:56:42.420 --> 1:56:44.420]  If he had any disease,
[1:56:44.420 --> 1:56:46.420]  this is very serious stuff. I guess
[1:56:46.420 --> 1:56:48.420]  in the almost Marxist world in which we exist,
[1:56:48.420 --> 1:56:50.420]  this is inevitable.
[1:56:50.420 --> 1:56:52.420]  How ironic that I have just finished
[1:56:52.420 --> 1:56:54.420]  speaking to Catherine McGregor,
[1:56:54.420 --> 1:56:56.420]  journalists about to leave China.
[1:56:56.420 --> 1:56:58.420]  They get the knock on the door,
[1:56:58.420 --> 1:57:00.420]  and what does the Chinese Communist Party President
[1:57:00.420 --> 1:57:02.420]  Xi say to Chinese journalists,
[1:57:02.420 --> 1:57:04.420]  your name is Party.
[1:57:04.420 --> 1:57:06.420]  Does this sound like Daniel Andrews?
[1:57:06.420 --> 1:57:08.420]  Do it our way, or look out.
[1:57:08.420 --> 1:57:10.420]  Witness the pregnant woman being arrested.
[1:57:10.420 --> 1:57:12.420]  A very learned legal man
[1:57:12.420 --> 1:57:14.420]  texted me tonight to say
[1:57:14.420 --> 1:57:16.420]  that quote, the trust that government
[1:57:16.420 --> 1:57:18.420]  needs in a crisis has been
[1:57:18.420 --> 1:57:20.420]  absolutely incinerated.
[1:57:20.420 --> 1:57:22.420]  Remember, I spoke two weeks ago to Dr.
[1:57:22.420 --> 1:57:24.420]  Amon Matheson, a Melbourne and East
[1:57:24.420 --> 1:57:26.420]  statist, who's one of 13 doctors and surgeons
[1:57:26.420 --> 1:57:28.420]  who signed a letter saying that the lockdowns
[1:57:28.420 --> 1:57:30.420]  and the restrictions were killing more
[1:57:30.420 --> 1:57:32.420]  people than the virus. He also said
[1:57:32.420 --> 1:57:34.420]  the strategy was completely wrong, and he called
[1:57:34.420 --> 1:57:36.420]  for other doctors to sign up. Well,
[1:57:36.420 --> 1:57:38.420]  they were overwhelmed. The website
[1:57:38.420 --> 1:57:40.420]  was swamped such that it had to be
[1:57:40.420 --> 1:57:42.420]  shut down. A Facebook page blew up
[1:57:42.420 --> 1:57:44.420]  and had to be deleted.
[1:57:44.420 --> 1:57:46.420]  This is now a massive story
[1:57:46.420 --> 1:57:48.420]  many of the doctors are worried.
[1:57:48.420 --> 1:57:50.420]  They are fearful for their own professional futures.
[1:57:50.420 --> 1:57:52.420]  They believe there will be repercussions
[1:57:52.420 --> 1:57:54.420]  for speaking out.
[1:57:54.420 --> 1:57:56.420]  They know if people can arrest
[1:57:56.420 --> 1:57:58.420]  pregnant mothers in front of crying
[1:57:58.420 --> 1:58:00.420]  children, why can't they come up
[1:58:00.420 --> 1:58:02.420]  after the doctor's next, the communist
[1:58:02.420 --> 1:58:04.420]  knock on the door.
[1:58:04.420 --> 1:58:06.420]  Is this the new world order?
[1:58:06.420 --> 1:58:08.420]  Well, one class act prepared to stick
[1:58:08.420 --> 1:58:10.420]  his head up is Dr. Amon Matheson.
[1:58:10.420 --> 1:58:12.420]  I spoke to him last week.
[1:58:12.420 --> 1:58:14.420]  I have to stress he is not tonight
[1:58:14.420 --> 1:58:16.420]  speaking on behalf of anyone other
[1:58:16.420 --> 1:58:18.420]  than himself. The letter that
[1:58:18.420 --> 1:58:20.420]  has been written to Premier Andrews by all of
[1:58:20.420 --> 1:58:22.420]  those doctors has not been
[1:58:22.420 --> 1:58:24.420]  acknowledged in any way.
[1:58:24.420 --> 1:58:26.420]  But as Edmund Burke said, the only
[1:58:26.420 --> 1:58:28.420]  thing necessary for the triumph of evil
[1:58:28.420 --> 1:58:30.420]  is for good men to do nothing.
[1:58:30.420 --> 1:58:32.420]  Here's a good man is doing something,
[1:58:32.420 --> 1:58:34.420]  Dr. Amon Matheson. Dr. Matheson,
[1:58:34.420 --> 1:58:36.420]  thank you for your time again. You're
[1:58:36.420 --> 1:58:38.420]  speaking on behalf of all of us. I know not the doctors
[1:58:38.420 --> 1:58:40.420]  who signed the original letter. I should
[1:58:40.420 --> 1:58:42.420]  point out the letter writers who signed
[1:58:42.420 --> 1:58:44.420]  the letter to Premier Andrews
[1:58:44.420 --> 1:58:46.420]  and Dr. Amon Matheson.
[1:58:46.420 --> 1:58:48.420]  As of
[1:58:48.420 --> 1:58:50.420]  54 days out,
[1:58:50.420 --> 1:58:52.420]  the globalist child molesting devil
[1:58:52.420 --> 1:58:54.420]  worshippers know they're in trouble
[1:58:54.420 --> 1:58:56.420]  and they know Trump's going to win in
[1:58:56.420 --> 1:58:58.420]  the landslides. They're saying they're
[1:58:58.420 --> 1:59:00.420]  going to contest the election and plunge
[1:59:00.420 --> 1:59:02.420]  the country into the war. And they are
[1:59:02.420 --> 1:59:04.420]  throwing hack attacks at them full wars,
[1:59:04.420 --> 1:59:06.420]  dirty tricks, attempts to shut us
[1:59:06.420 --> 1:59:08.420]  down. It's incredible. That's why now
[1:59:08.420 --> 1:59:10.420]  more than ever, your financial support
[1:59:10.420 --> 1:59:12.420]  at mforeshore.com is critical.
[1:59:12.420 --> 1:59:14.420]  We've got a few months of back up.
[1:59:14.420 --> 1:59:16.420]  If money wasn't coming in, we'd be
[1:59:16.420 --> 1:59:18.420]  shut down and that's not good.
[1:59:18.420 --> 1:59:20.420]  We need to have extra money in our coffers
[1:59:20.420 --> 1:59:22.420]  to be able to expand in this home
[1:59:22.420 --> 1:59:24.420]  stretch, not just contract. We're
[1:59:24.420 --> 1:59:26.420]  winning, but these scumbags
[1:59:26.420 --> 1:59:28.420]  aren't going to give us the victory without a fight.
[1:59:28.420 --> 1:59:30.420]  So I know you're going to step up
[1:59:30.420 --> 1:59:32.420]  at mforeshore.com. We've got free

[1:59:38.420 --> 1:59:40.420]  Great supplements, books, films,

[1:59:44.420 --> 2:00:10.420]  God bless you all.
[2:00:14.420 --> 2:00:18.420]  The die was cast, the rebel flag unfurled.
[2:00:18.420 --> 2:00:20.420]  And on to Concord,
[2:00:20.420 --> 2:00:22.420]  march to the fold, to seize the arsenal.
[2:00:22.420 --> 2:00:24.420]  There you know, waking folks,
[2:00:24.420 --> 2:00:26.420]  searching all around.
[2:00:26.420 --> 2:00:30.420]  Till our militia stopped them in their tracks,
[2:00:30.420 --> 2:00:32.420]  at the old North Bridge, we turned them back
[2:00:32.420 --> 2:00:34.420]  and chased those Red Coasts back
[2:00:34.420 --> 2:00:36.420]  to Boston Town.
[2:00:36.420 --> 2:00:38.420]  And the shot around the world
[2:00:38.420 --> 2:00:40.420]  was a start of the Revolution.
[2:00:40.420 --> 2:00:46.420]  The men were ready on the move.
[2:00:46.420 --> 2:00:48.420]  Take your powder, take your gun,
[2:00:48.420 --> 2:00:50.420]  report to General Washington,
[2:00:50.420 --> 2:00:54.420]  hurry when there's an hour to lose.
[2:00:54.420 --> 2:00:56.420]  It happened that they had planned
[2:00:56.420 --> 2:00:58.420]  if the British was ever to come over here
[2:00:58.420 --> 2:01:00.420]  that they had put a light up in this
[2:01:00.420 --> 2:01:02.420]  high church steeple.
[2:01:02.420 --> 2:01:04.420]  And Paul went down there to look
[2:01:04.420 --> 2:01:06.420]  and shone up. There was the light,
[2:01:06.420 --> 2:01:08.420]  burning brighter than day.
[2:01:08.420 --> 2:01:10.420]  Well, Paul, he jumped on his old horse
[2:01:10.420 --> 2:01:12.420]  and he lit out.
[2:01:12.420 --> 2:01:14.420]  He didn't know where he was going,
[2:01:14.420 --> 2:01:16.420]  but he knew he had to go somewhere.
[2:01:16.420 --> 2:01:18.420]  Oh, I wish you could have seen it.
[2:01:18.420 --> 2:01:20.420]  That old horse with his ears laid back
[2:01:20.420 --> 2:01:22.420]  in his nostrils wide, open the sucking in wind
[2:01:22.420 --> 2:01:24.420]  like a jet engine, feet pounding on them cobblestones,
[2:01:24.420 --> 2:01:26.420]  striking off sparks.
[2:01:26.420 --> 2:01:28.420]  Paul are holding on for dear life
[2:01:28.420 --> 2:01:30.420]  and are hollering at the top of his lungs.
[2:01:30.420 --> 2:01:32.420]  He says, the British is coming, the British is coming.
[2:01:32.420 --> 2:01:36.420]  Get you a gun, we gonna have us a revolution.
[2:01:36.420 --> 2:01:38.420]  Some farmers come up piling out of the hay
[2:01:38.420 --> 2:01:40.420]  like bees out of beehive.
[2:01:40.420 --> 2:01:42.420]  Minute men there's called.
[2:01:42.420 --> 2:01:44.420]  What's minute mean?
[2:01:44.420 --> 2:01:46.420]  Minute men, there's fellas that had to be ready
[2:01:46.420 --> 2:01:48.420]  at a minute's notice, and when Paul comes
[2:01:48.420 --> 2:01:50.420]  screeching down the road that way,
[2:01:50.420 --> 2:01:52.420]  they grabbed their guns and hid out behind
[2:01:52.420 --> 2:01:54.420]  the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere.
[2:01:54.420 --> 2:01:56.420]  And when the British come pranks
[2:01:56.420 --> 2:01:58.420]  and all dressed up in their red suits,
[2:01:58.420 --> 2:02:00.420]  they let them have it.
[2:02:00.420 --> 2:02:02.420]  Phew, it was a sight to see.
[2:02:02.420 --> 2:02:04.420]  Phew, it was a sight to see.
[2:02:04.420 --> 2:02:06.420]  And then it happened.
[2:02:06.420 --> 2:02:08.420]  They fired the gun.
[2:02:08.420 --> 2:02:10.420]  They fired the gun.
[2:02:10.420 --> 2:02:12.420]  And the shot was so loud
[2:02:12.420 --> 2:02:16.420]  it was heard clear around the world.
[2:02:16.420 --> 2:02:18.420]  Oh, get out.
[2:02:18.420 --> 2:02:20.420]  It's a fact.
[2:02:20.420 --> 2:02:38.420]  That's the way this country started.
[2:02:38.420 --> 2:02:42.420]  You can run on for a long time.
[2:02:42.420 --> 2:02:45.420]  Run on for a long time.
[2:02:45.420 --> 2:02:48.420]  Run on for a long time.
[2:02:48.420 --> 2:02:52.420]  Soon our leader gonna cut you down.
[2:02:52.420 --> 2:02:54.420]  Soon our leader gonna cut you down.
[2:02:54.420 --> 2:02:56.420]  Wow, President Trump
[2:02:56.420 --> 2:02:58.420]  in every internal poll, every public poll
[2:02:58.420 --> 2:03:00.420]  is way ahead. What is the left going to do?
[2:03:00.420 --> 2:03:02.420]  He's a good friend of mine from high school,
[2:03:02.420 --> 2:03:04.420]  successful business owner,
[2:03:04.420 --> 2:03:06.420]  all around great top country music singer,
[2:03:06.420 --> 2:03:08.420]  all the stuff Shane Steiner's done in his life.
[2:03:08.420 --> 2:03:10.420]  That's along with other Tommy Shane Steiner.
[2:03:10.420 --> 2:03:12.420]  And then your folks and your family
[2:03:12.420 --> 2:03:14.420]  are in the big Yellowstone TV show,
[2:03:14.420 --> 2:03:16.420]  not even trying to get in that, a lot of stuff going on.
[2:03:16.420 --> 2:03:18.420]  You're such good friends.
[2:03:18.420 --> 2:03:20.420]  I have to come on this show to see you anymore.
[2:03:20.420 --> 2:03:22.420]  So that's what I have to go to.
[2:03:22.420 --> 2:03:24.420]  You're a great guy. I love flying around your helicopter too.
[2:03:24.420 --> 2:03:26.420]  We need to do it more.
[2:03:26.420 --> 2:03:28.420]  You're amazing.
[2:03:28.420 --> 2:03:30.420]  We've got to get Joe Rogan's here in town now.
[2:03:30.420 --> 2:03:32.420]  He wants to go flying around.
[2:03:32.420 --> 2:03:34.420]  That's what I heard.
[2:03:34.420 --> 2:03:36.420]  Dude just told me that I'm flying around Saturday.
[2:03:36.420 --> 2:03:38.420]  It's the first I've heard of it.
[2:03:38.420 --> 2:03:40.420]  I didn't know that. No, I just said,
[2:03:40.420 --> 2:03:42.420]  I'm sure there's going to be an aftershock
[2:03:42.420 --> 2:03:44.420]  of Saturday's event, which they now believe
[2:03:44.420 --> 2:03:46.420]  in America right here in Austin, Texas.
[2:03:46.420 --> 2:03:48.420]  So I had heard about it on Facebook.
[2:03:48.420 --> 2:03:50.420]  And just thought I'd go fly around a little bit.
[2:03:50.420 --> 2:03:52.420]  They were going to have a big helicopter
[2:03:52.420 --> 2:03:54.420]  drop these skydivers off.
[2:03:54.420 --> 2:03:56.420]  And at the last minute, that fell through.
[2:03:56.420 --> 2:03:58.420]  So I got me and a bunch of my friends together
[2:03:58.420 --> 2:04:00.420]  and we took up six skydivers.
[2:04:00.420 --> 2:04:02.420]  So that was my point to start off.
[2:04:02.420 --> 2:04:04.420]  And we dropped those skydivers off.
[2:04:04.420 --> 2:04:06.420]  But yeah, here's where we're going to go through all this.
[2:04:06.420 --> 2:04:08.420]  But let me just say this.
[2:04:08.420 --> 2:04:10.420]  We don't, and I'm not going to say that.
[2:04:10.420 --> 2:04:12.420]  I'm not going to say that.
[2:04:12.420 --> 2:04:14.420]  We don't, and I'm the worst person
[2:04:14.420 --> 2:04:16.420]  on following my own views on this.
[2:04:16.420 --> 2:04:18.420]  We need to make fighting tyranny fun
[2:04:18.420 --> 2:04:20.420]  instead of depressing like I do.
[2:04:20.420 --> 2:04:22.420]  And every time you get involved politically,
[2:04:22.420 --> 2:04:24.420]  you're kicking ass, you like lead helicopters in there,
[2:04:24.420 --> 2:04:26.420]  skydiving into the crowds, flying over the boats.
[2:04:26.420 --> 2:04:28.420]  Everybody loved it, made national news.
[2:04:28.420 --> 2:04:30.420]  Great job, Shane, because this is fun.
[2:04:30.420 --> 2:04:32.420]  And Trump talked about the rally.
[2:04:32.420 --> 2:04:34.420]  That was the great thing about it is everybody
[2:04:34.420 --> 2:04:36.420]  was out there having the time.
[2:04:36.420 --> 2:04:38.420]  I mean, I heard from people that were out there on the boats
[2:04:38.420 --> 2:04:40.420]  that said that was the most fun they've ever had on Lake Travis.
[2:04:40.420 --> 2:04:42.420]  So everybody's out there having a good time.
[2:04:42.420 --> 2:04:44.420]  They're enjoying themselves.
[2:04:44.420 --> 2:04:46.420]  And it really goes...
[2:04:46.420 --> 2:04:48.420]  We're not burning down police stations
[2:04:48.420 --> 2:04:50.420]  or burning down black owned businesses.
[2:04:50.420 --> 2:04:52.420]  But they always say that Trump supporters
[2:04:52.420 --> 2:04:54.420]  are this angry mob.
[2:04:54.420 --> 2:04:56.420]  It's like I saw people being kind each other
[2:04:56.420 --> 2:04:58.420]  and just enjoying it.
[2:04:58.420 --> 2:05:00.420]  Well, everything the left does is an inversion.
[2:05:00.420 --> 2:05:02.420]  Like black people that finally go to Trump rallies.
[2:05:02.420 --> 2:05:04.420]  That's why now you go to Trump rallies.
[2:05:04.420 --> 2:05:06.420]  There's a ton of black folks and brown folks there
[2:05:06.420 --> 2:05:08.420]  because they really believed it was racist.
[2:05:08.420 --> 2:05:10.420]  It's over.
[2:05:10.420 --> 2:05:12.420]  Yeah, so I hate to admit this,
[2:05:12.420 --> 2:05:14.420]  but I just found out what gaslighting is.
[2:05:14.420 --> 2:05:16.420]  And it's when your own eyes
[2:05:16.420 --> 2:05:18.420]  are telling you something different
[2:05:18.420 --> 2:05:20.420]  than you're being told is going on.
[2:05:20.420 --> 2:05:22.420]  And so that's what that whole day was.
[2:05:22.420 --> 2:05:24.420]  So when I got home and started reading the articles
[2:05:24.420 --> 2:05:26.420]  of all the boats sinking
[2:05:26.420 --> 2:05:28.420]  and just the chaos
[2:05:28.420 --> 2:05:30.420]  and the...
[2:05:30.420 --> 2:05:32.420]  They said seven boats.
[2:05:32.420 --> 2:05:34.420]  It was all exaggerated.
[2:05:34.420 --> 2:05:36.420]  If you get 6,000 boats, something's going to happen though.
[2:05:36.420 --> 2:05:38.420]  Now, I'm not going to say that no boats sank,
[2:05:38.420 --> 2:05:40.420]  but they acted like it was Armadas
[2:05:40.420 --> 2:05:42.420]  just going down at the helm, but...
[2:05:42.420 --> 2:05:44.420]  The Spanish Armadas.
[2:05:44.420 --> 2:05:46.420]  The Spanish Armadas, like boats were
[2:05:46.420 --> 2:05:48.420]  on the bottom now, but...
[2:05:48.420 --> 2:05:50.420]  We've got some photos. You found one boat that went down.
[2:05:50.420 --> 2:05:52.420]  There it is right there.
[2:05:52.420 --> 2:05:54.420]  My video,
[2:05:54.420 --> 2:05:56.420]  I caught this one giant yacht
[2:05:56.420 --> 2:05:58.420]  that obviously capsized.
[2:05:58.420 --> 2:06:00.420]  Actually, like a 16-footer.
[2:06:00.420 --> 2:06:02.420]  Yeah.
[2:06:02.420 --> 2:06:04.420]  But the truth is in some of those narrow champs,
[2:06:04.420 --> 2:06:06.420]  there's not a lot of river.
[2:06:06.420 --> 2:06:08.420]  Some days when it's busy, there's some big waves out there.
[2:06:08.420 --> 2:06:10.420]  A lot of folks get their boats out
[2:06:10.420 --> 2:06:12.420]  and they've not been de-wanderized
[2:06:12.420 --> 2:06:14.420]  and they leave the plug out.
[2:06:14.420 --> 2:06:16.420]  I routinely see sinking boats.
[2:06:16.420 --> 2:06:18.420]  I go, I pull up and help them a couple times.
[2:06:18.420 --> 2:06:20.420]  You know, I go out there a lot.
[2:06:20.420 --> 2:06:22.420]  I've helped three boats.
[2:06:22.420 --> 2:06:24.420]  They're like, oh, the plug wasn't it?
[2:06:24.420 --> 2:06:26.420]  So that was one guy
[2:06:26.420 --> 2:06:28.420]  that officially his boat sank
[2:06:28.420 --> 2:06:30.420]  because he forgot to put the plug in.
[2:06:30.420 --> 2:06:32.420]  One,
[2:06:32.420 --> 2:06:34.420]  multiple waves kind of converging.
[2:06:34.420 --> 2:06:36.420]  You got to watch what you're doing.
[2:06:36.420 --> 2:06:38.420]  If you don't spend a lot of time in the lake,
[2:06:38.420 --> 2:06:40.420]  then you can...
[2:06:40.420 --> 2:06:42.420]  Well, it's like having people sit on the back of the boat
[2:06:42.420 --> 2:06:44.420]  and backing up too fast.
[2:06:44.420 --> 2:06:46.420]  I mean, even I know how to drive a boat
[2:06:46.420 --> 2:06:48.420]  and I almost flooded one about a month ago.
[2:06:48.420 --> 2:06:50.420]  I mean, nobody got hurt.
[2:06:50.420 --> 2:06:52.420]  But they tried to make that the story
[2:06:52.420 --> 2:06:54.420]  which is why I said we should have another rally this Saturday.
[2:06:54.420 --> 2:06:56.420]  Because I didn't go out last Saturday,
[2:06:56.420 --> 2:06:58.420]  but I think we have a big aftershock.
[2:06:58.420 --> 2:07:00.420]  I think it's going to be big.
[2:07:00.420 --> 2:07:02.420]  I mean, we got to have a lot of people
[2:07:02.420 --> 2:07:04.420]  that will show up for that, just because...
[2:07:04.420 --> 2:07:06.420]  Well, we're saying Trump too. We're doing it again.
[2:07:06.420 --> 2:07:08.420]  I mean, Trump said they do it on the weekends.
[2:07:08.420 --> 2:07:10.420]  Trump goes, they ought to do it every day.
[2:07:10.420 --> 2:07:12.420]  Did you see that? So I had to say,
[2:07:12.420 --> 2:07:14.420]  yes, sir, Mr. Trump.
[2:07:14.420 --> 2:07:16.420]  Why not? Go out and have fun on the lake.
[2:07:16.420 --> 2:07:18.420]  Anyways, your experience is when we come back,
[2:07:18.420 --> 2:07:20.420]  we're going to play a bunch of clips.
[2:07:20.420 --> 2:07:22.420]  Tell us about the craziness because
[2:07:22.420 --> 2:07:24.420]  a helicopter at 6,000 feet looks like you're at 30,000.
[2:07:24.420 --> 2:07:26.420]  That's crazy that footage you got.
[2:07:26.420 --> 2:07:28.420]  And also because you're in an open cockpit,
[2:07:28.420 --> 2:07:36.500]  slowing down to 20 or 30 knots in your 6,000 feet. It does feel a little unnerving.
[2:07:37.380 --> 2:07:40.820]  I got to say it, I want to jump out of there, but you had experienced guys out there.
[2:07:40.820 --> 2:07:43.620]  Oh yeah, these guys were great. You don't want me to jump out.
[2:07:43.620 --> 2:07:47.780]  They also had flags that they would, so you'll see right here, this guy jumps.
[2:07:47.780 --> 2:07:49.700]  And you were flying a stage four cancer guy around.
[2:07:51.460 --> 2:07:57.380]  Afterwards, he, one of the skydivers who can no longer, I mean, he hasn't skydived in the
[2:07:57.380 --> 2:08:00.180]  wall because he's been having some health issues. They asked me if I would go and
[2:08:00.820 --> 2:08:05.700]  fly him around and give him a fun flight to kind of bring up his spirits.
[2:08:05.700 --> 2:08:09.140]  And he's the one that filmed all of the video from my helicopter.
[2:08:10.580 --> 2:08:12.660]  Now tell folks who else you've given the helicopter bug.
[2:08:12.660 --> 2:08:14.340]  One congressional medal honor winner.
[2:08:14.340 --> 2:08:20.580]  That's right. Dakota Meyer was, he was almost going to get his pilot's license in airplanes.
[2:08:21.140 --> 2:08:24.580]  And I decided, no, I'm going to, you know, misery loves company.
[2:08:24.580 --> 2:08:27.220]  So I, I took him for a ride.
[2:08:27.220 --> 2:08:29.380]  Well, they, they say you're a really good helicopter pilot.
[2:08:29.380 --> 2:08:31.940]  I can tell, but it's a little, you know how to do all the tricks and everything.
[2:08:32.660 --> 2:08:35.700]  Well, I mean, it, it, it looks like tricks and, uh,
[2:08:35.700 --> 2:08:39.780]  there's people that, they don't, you know, they don't fly helicopters.
[2:08:39.780 --> 2:08:45.460]  And, you know, it looks like it's, uh, scary, but what I'm doing is I never do anything that's,
[2:08:45.460 --> 2:08:47.300]  I understand. Does Sid fly with you now?
[2:08:48.340 --> 2:08:50.020]  No, my brother does not fly with me.
[2:08:50.020 --> 2:08:56.820]  He rode with me too many years in, in high school and, uh, people think that I'd,
[2:08:56.820 --> 2:09:02.420]  I fly like I drive and, uh, I'll admit I'm a little bit, uh, crazy driver, but
[2:09:02.420 --> 2:09:04.340]  you drive pretty good now compared to me.
[2:09:04.340 --> 2:09:05.460]  Well, I don't drive anymore.
[2:09:06.020 --> 2:09:07.780]  That's another thing. You just fly around.
[2:09:07.780 --> 2:09:11.540]  Yeah. I, all my trips are now based on whether or not I could land there.
[2:09:12.180 --> 2:09:15.940]  And, uh, if the weather's, that's right, we had to show fur you today over here.
[2:09:15.940 --> 2:09:16.500]  Yeah, that's right.
[2:09:16.500 --> 2:09:18.580]  Run the secret Joe Rogan location.
[2:09:18.580 --> 2:09:21.860]  Hey, I just, I don't, driving is too dangerous.
[2:09:21.860 --> 2:09:25.780]  You know, they, they think helicopter is, or dangerous, but when I get in a car now with
[2:09:25.780 --> 2:09:30.100]  my wife, I'm like, I'm white knuckling on the, on the dashboard.
[2:09:30.100 --> 2:09:32.820]  It is amazing that we can fly to any restaurant we want.
[2:09:32.820 --> 2:09:35.380]  Like 10 minutes, we're in like round rock having lunch.
[2:09:35.380 --> 2:09:38.020]  We fly back. We're done. I'm very spoiled here.
[2:09:38.020 --> 2:09:40.900]  Let's talk about the T footage when we come back. Stay with us.
[2:09:45.060 --> 2:09:47.220]  I don't want to say I'm a practical person.
[2:09:47.220 --> 2:09:51.300]  I'm, I am a humble person overall. I come off as aggressive and things because
[2:09:51.300 --> 2:09:54.740]  I'm under threat here under threat and I'm, I'm fine as hard as I possibly can.
[2:09:54.740 --> 2:09:59.140]  And I appreciate your support, your prayers, but I know I come off as obnoxious sometimes
[2:09:59.140 --> 2:10:03.140]  and I wish I did a better job. So that's why when you call in, thank me all the time.
[2:10:03.140 --> 2:10:07.460]  And get it just, it just kind of makes you feel pathetic because I guess call it pride.
[2:10:07.460 --> 2:10:11.620]  I don't like begging you all the time to try our products or to donate or to spread the word
[2:10:11.620 --> 2:10:14.340]  or to pray for us. I just know that's what keeps us on air.
[2:10:14.340 --> 2:10:18.020]  And so I want to thank you. You it's, it's, it's put the cart before the horse
[2:10:18.580 --> 2:10:22.340]  to call it and thank me. Listen, I'm committed to this just like you are.
[2:10:22.340 --> 2:10:26.820]  So understand you're, you're my equal 110%. And I just want to thank you all.
[2:10:26.820 --> 2:10:30.020]  I want to thank our crew and our affiliates and everybody else, man.
[2:10:30.020 --> 2:10:32.340]  I just want to stay in this fight and it's so serious now.
[2:10:32.900 --> 2:10:36.020]  Things are getting so clear now. That's why they want us off air because
[2:10:36.020 --> 2:10:40.180]  all of our credibility so high as we're just stay together, fight hard, spread the word,
[2:10:40.180 --> 2:10:47.060]  pray to God, take us through this. We're going to make it. There is a metaphysical rule that God
[2:10:47.060 --> 2:10:53.300]  has put in place that controls the universe and it's free will. That's why the social engineers,
[2:10:53.300 --> 2:11:00.100]  the robber barons, the globalists, the post humanist, the anti humans openly tell you
[2:11:00.100 --> 2:11:04.980]  what they're doing and openly tell you that your work will some crap and you need to die
[2:11:04.980 --> 2:11:08.900]  because that will save the earth. But they do everything they can to make the most dystopian
[2:11:08.900 --> 2:11:14.580]  ugly future they can in the movies and in the culture and in all the different publications.
[2:11:14.580 --> 2:11:18.740]  They are making you hate yourself. They are making you be depressed. They are making you
[2:11:18.740 --> 2:11:22.660]  not have a connection to God because they just want you to die so they can selfishly control
[2:11:22.660 --> 2:11:26.180]  the future. And that's what all this is about. You know, they say they're setting up world
[2:11:26.180 --> 2:11:30.580]  government to protect us all from our super technologies. While they're the ones running
[2:11:30.580 --> 2:11:34.820]  around like mad scientists, endangering the whole planet with a lot of these technologies,
[2:11:34.820 --> 2:11:41.540]  the globalists are what is disruptive to human species. They call us disruptive to their power
[2:11:41.540 --> 2:11:50.260]  grab. It's time to say no. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:50.260 --> 2:12:07.300]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[2:12:07.300 --> 2:12:18.100]  Let them wash your American hair.
[2:12:20.500 --> 2:12:24.820]  But take the Americana cutting edge Lake Travis outside Austin.
[2:12:25.620 --> 2:12:30.660]  Bunch of helicopters, planes, 6,000 boats. Everybody having a great time.
[2:12:30.660 --> 2:12:33.460]  And they take a couple boasts in and put the plug in the bottom and launch them and they
[2:12:33.460 --> 2:12:38.500]  sank or rumble boats or whatever. Shane Stoner, my old high school buddy, successful business guy,
[2:12:38.500 --> 2:12:44.100]  helicopter pilot, country music singer, the whole nine yards. We're here talking about this.
[2:12:44.100 --> 2:12:49.300]  You've got a bunch of clips you can direct us which one to go to first, but just the excitement
[2:12:49.300 --> 2:12:54.500]  of a Trump rally and the spontaneous boat rallies versus what the left is up to where they burn
[2:12:54.500 --> 2:13:02.180]  down cities. Yeah, I think it's a stark contrast to when you see Trump rallies who are supposed
[2:13:02.180 --> 2:13:10.580]  to be filled with anger and vitriol and they're all happy and out. American flags, when did it
[2:13:10.580 --> 2:13:17.380]  become a partisan thing to not love your country and not fly an American flag? Mainline Democrats
[2:13:17.380 --> 2:13:22.580]  say they hate America now. What the hell happened to these people? Then you get home and see the
[2:13:22.580 --> 2:13:26.980]  news about mostly peaceful protests where the city's on fire. Fiery but mostly peaceful.
[2:13:26.980 --> 2:13:31.620]  What do we do about the Democrats though once they probably lose this?
[2:13:32.740 --> 2:13:36.100]  How do we rehabilitate them? What the hell is wrong with these people?
[2:13:37.380 --> 2:13:43.380]  I don't know. At this point, like I was saying, if we can't come together on just
[2:13:43.380 --> 2:13:49.860]  the love for the country, then there's really not much you can, there's not much.
[2:13:49.860 --> 2:13:52.740]  Well, you're a smart guy and your dad's a smart and your family's smart. What do you think is
[2:13:52.740 --> 2:14:00.900]  going to happen to this country? I have no idea. I mean, it's like a do what I were talking about.
[2:14:00.900 --> 2:14:05.780]  At least it's, you know, there's this craziness. It's, you know, at least it's not boring.
[2:14:06.740 --> 2:14:11.940]  Well, damn right. It's not boring. So, so when did you hear about this boat rally? Because I said
[2:14:11.940 --> 2:14:15.140]  we should have one or also another we're going to have one. I heard about like two days before.
[2:14:15.140 --> 2:14:20.580]  They say Trump says it's the biggest one yet. Yeah. So I saw it on Facebook. Several of my
[2:14:20.580 --> 2:14:24.980]  friends called and asked how I was going to be flying over. And that's, that's how I initially
[2:14:24.980 --> 2:14:29.620]  heard about it. And I just thought, man, it's Austin, you know, Austin's a very liberal city.
[2:14:29.620 --> 2:14:34.340]  So I thought maybe a few hundred boats were going to show up. And it, I mean,
[2:14:35.060 --> 2:14:39.940]  you could tell by that skydive video, that's before the boats even started to move that
[2:14:40.820 --> 2:14:45.460]  there was already in the foul couple thousand. They're estimating six thousand the state police
[2:14:45.460 --> 2:14:51.140]  and LCR are lower Colorado River authority. Well, this Saturday noon, the nighttime folks,
[2:14:51.140 --> 2:14:54.740]  I'm just saying there's going to be another one. Everybody tell, just come to it. Be safe. We're
[2:14:54.740 --> 2:14:58.020]  going to be there. Are we going flying? Is that what's going on too? I didn't know that you've
[2:14:58.020 --> 2:15:03.060]  been conscripted, but I would like to fly around the helicopter. Well, let's do it. I'm so fat,
[2:15:03.060 --> 2:15:07.780]  though. I jumped out of the helicopter, but it will splash the whole way. But seriously,
[2:15:07.780 --> 2:15:15.540]  tell us about this long shot of boat. So yeah, I have a long shot of me just going over the, the, uh,
[2:15:15.540 --> 2:15:20.260]  the boat parade. Because the media called this harassment, Reddit owned by the common Chinese
[2:15:20.260 --> 2:15:22.900]  said this was bad. This was one. Because in China, you don't even get a car unless you're
[2:15:22.900 --> 2:15:28.660]  with Gigi Payne. I just want to demonstrate that, I mean, you could see all the boats going in the
[2:15:28.660 --> 2:15:35.300]  same direction. There's not boat sinking left and right. I mean, I fly like this, this video.
[2:15:35.300 --> 2:15:41.540]  And where did the boats meet? Right in front of emerald point, emerald point. All right. That's
[2:15:41.540 --> 2:15:46.340]  where we're doing it again. And that's where they started off. And then this is after they've already
[2:15:46.340 --> 2:15:54.180]  started to go. But yeah, one, uh, at one point I'd, I got home and saw that one of the boats had
[2:15:54.180 --> 2:15:58.180]  waved me closer. Like the guy was on the back like, Hey, get closer. And so I got a little closer
[2:15:58.180 --> 2:16:05.220]  and wave to him and that made it on to Reddit. And, uh, from, from the way they shot that video,
[2:16:05.220 --> 2:16:10.100]  they shot like you're harassing. They said he's harassing. They got begged you. He said he was
[2:16:10.100 --> 2:16:15.780]  using the airport nomenclature. You could see him move his hands to, to like wave me in. And
[2:16:15.780 --> 2:16:20.020]  this is the shot from the boat. The boat's all shaky. Yeah. I mean, I was down on the boat a
[2:16:20.020 --> 2:16:24.100]  couple of months ago and I saw you flying around. I called you and you're like, and so you flew
[2:16:24.100 --> 2:16:29.620]  over. My kids were mad. You didn't get closer. It was awesome. Well, I mean, I, I try to do things
[2:16:29.620 --> 2:16:33.140]  as safe as possible. Folks that don't know though, planes flow over all the time. It's all legal.
[2:16:33.140 --> 2:16:37.300]  Explain that to people. That's a thing. People, people, uh, maybe have heard that there's rules
[2:16:37.300 --> 2:16:43.460]  for aircraft that they have to stay a thousand feet above, uh, congested and 500 feet above
[2:16:43.460 --> 2:16:48.820]  uncongested. So there's a rule for airplanes, but helicopters, uh, do not fall on that. There is no
[2:16:49.780 --> 2:16:53.380]  because they have way more control. Well, I mean, we can, we're under control all the way to the
[2:16:53.380 --> 2:17:00.020]  ground and, uh, we could hover and go backwards and all that stuff. So, uh, people see that and
[2:17:00.020 --> 2:17:03.780]  it's no, nobody, it was at the Trump rally. I mean, they shared that on their social media
[2:17:03.780 --> 2:17:07.540]  and then other people see those videos and then think, Oh, this guy is crazy.
[2:17:07.540 --> 2:17:12.500]  He was endangering people. I can only imagine that the FAA got inundated with, with calls,
[2:17:12.500 --> 2:17:16.020]  but I'm sure they did, but it's all legal. And you've got extras. It just shows the left though.
[2:17:16.020 --> 2:17:18.820]  They complained about everything because I remember on Reddit, they said, we're going to
[2:17:18.820 --> 2:17:23.540]  get him. We're going to expose him. David docs you. Yeah. They docs me and, uh, and
[2:17:24.820 --> 2:17:29.540]  did links to all my social media accounts and, but, uh, it's, it's, it's mostly people just
[2:17:29.540 --> 2:17:33.140]  don't understand that, that, you know, what I was doing is completely legal. Well,
[2:17:33.140 --> 2:17:37.220]  the average leftist doesn't leave their house on record. I mean, they're literally in a compact
[2:17:37.220 --> 2:17:42.020]  bill wearing a mask alone, just sitting there jerking off in front of the computer. I'm sorry.
[2:17:42.020 --> 2:17:46.020]  And they just see you in a helicopter. They go, this isn't legal. They're on boats. They're
[2:17:46.020 --> 2:17:50.740]  having fun. There's women in bikinis. This is not allowed. So it's funny that, uh, somebody
[2:17:50.740 --> 2:17:55.460]  who's asked me the other day if I, uh, named my helicopter and, uh, I haven't thought of a name
[2:17:55.460 --> 2:18:02.500]  yet, but after this weekend, I've decided, uh, to call it trigger. I agree. Willie Nelson names
[2:18:02.500 --> 2:18:08.020]  his guitar, though. And also, uh, Roy Rogers horse was trigger. It's perfect. But that helicopter,
[2:18:08.020 --> 2:18:12.260]  when people, when I fly over, I, I definitely trigger some people. Well, and I see the lies
[2:18:12.260 --> 2:18:16.340]  because I don't even look for it. And I see Shane Stoner's helicopter in the news. They like, oh,
[2:18:16.340 --> 2:18:20.660]  he's landed in somebody's yard. It's your yard. It's like they just lie about you constantly.
[2:18:20.660 --> 2:18:26.340]  You know, also, somebody sent me a daily mail article that showed us in a, in a v formation
[2:18:26.340 --> 2:18:31.940]  after we dropped off the skydivers. We all formed up in this arrow formation. And, uh,
[2:18:31.940 --> 2:18:38.580]  that picture was on the daily mail that said helicopters come rescue, uh, sinking Trump boats
[2:18:38.580 --> 2:18:42.340]  like we were out there coming to the rest. Let me say this. We've got to take your footage.
[2:18:42.340 --> 2:18:45.700]  You gave us a bunch of, we'll play it next segment. We got to put five of the Valkyries to it.
[2:18:46.340 --> 2:18:51.060]  That'd be, that'd be awesome. We'll do it. I need to get a, uh, a sound system that
[2:18:51.060 --> 2:18:56.260]  just plays it off the skids. I'll pay for it. If you can get it rigged up, I'll pay for like a 500
[2:18:56.260 --> 2:19:02.180]  watt. We need it. Is that, is that big? 501% in number. We need big speakers, five of the Valkyries
[2:19:02.180 --> 2:19:06.260]  to fly on the left. As you imagine. Oh, look at this footage. Oh, this is footage I shot.
[2:19:06.260 --> 2:19:10.180]  Oh yeah. That's when you said that. How on earth do you guys even have this?
[2:19:11.700 --> 2:19:16.740]  I mean, uh, yeah, I have my, I have my, uh, I know social media is incestuous, but
[2:19:17.300 --> 2:19:24.180]  how in the hell do you guys even have this footage for me? Okay. Oh. Oh, Rob, dude, grab that on my
[2:19:24.180 --> 2:19:28.660]  phone. Yeah. This is a couple of months ago. This is crazy. There's Shane right there. Yeah.
[2:19:28.660 --> 2:19:32.420]  My, you can see my, my daughter was in there. I was taking her to, uh, cheer practice.
[2:19:32.420 --> 2:19:39.220]  This is amazing. See, I shot this. How good is that footage? That's, that is, is that a new
[2:19:39.220 --> 2:19:44.740]  iPhone? Uh, whatever. Did you see how good I am? I wish my crew would shoot video like that.
[2:19:44.740 --> 2:19:51.380]  See that skill? See, I'm, I'm sorry. That is precision. First class video shooting. Alex Jones
[2:19:51.380 --> 2:19:55.300]  did that. That's great. I'm just teasing. I didn't shoot it. I actually, I didn't shoot the video.
[2:19:55.300 --> 2:19:58.580]  No, you're over there circling other boat. I go, is that you get over here? You like,
[2:19:58.580 --> 2:20:04.900]  I was like, uh, headed, you're like 800 yards north, I guess. Yeah. I saw, you know what,
[2:20:04.900 --> 2:20:10.740]  I flew over the dam, the, the, my phone rang and I was like, I saw it was you. And I said, I knew,
[2:20:10.740 --> 2:20:15.460]  I know he's at the lake. Yeah. That's funny. I love you flower by neighbor's house too. That's
[2:20:15.460 --> 2:20:19.860]  always good. Look at this and see that downwash. That is not that that's not even rippling the
[2:20:19.860 --> 2:20:25.140]  water. Uh, I was also accused of being the reason why boats sank that that downwash was
[2:20:25.140 --> 2:20:29.780]  what, uh, look at how I did perfect shot. I mean, and then let me go out of frame. That is,
[2:20:29.780 --> 2:20:33.940]  that was some nice work. I'm not bragging, but I mean, you know, you know, we over here,
[2:20:33.940 --> 2:20:37.220]  the glove was, but that's not important. I didn't shoot some good video. We'll be right back with
[2:20:37.220 --> 2:20:44.660]  more footage. Stay with us. We're having some fun. It sounds over the top when I go on air and I
[2:20:44.660 --> 2:20:49.700]  explained that the controllers of the planet want to carry out the extermination of the entire human
[2:20:49.700 --> 2:20:55.940]  population, except for a few of what they call their new transcendent silicon gods. But that's
[2:20:55.940 --> 2:21:00.660]  really what they're now externalizing. They're now taking what was in their textbooks and white papers
[2:21:00.660 --> 2:21:06.580]  30 years ago and actually openly announcing it everywhere. They're going from beta to operation
[2:21:06.580 --> 2:21:10.180]  and think about all these major corporations. They tell you humans are hard, but they tell you
[2:21:10.180 --> 2:21:14.500]  humans are a parasite. They tell that we've all got to be gotten rid of. And then they won't let
[2:21:14.500 --> 2:21:19.380]  people see their old folks in nursing homes and then ship in COVID to kill them. That's all organizing
[2:21:19.380 --> 2:21:25.620]  as a beta test for larger operations. And everything is a microcosm and a laboratory test
[2:21:25.620 --> 2:21:30.420]  of larger scalability of what they are now beginning to roll out. Look at how they're
[2:21:30.420 --> 2:21:34.580]  banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics. They're absolutely essential
[2:21:34.580 --> 2:21:40.500]  to stop viral infections like COVID-19. This is all absolute information control. This is beyond
[2:21:40.500 --> 2:21:45.220]  1984. You've always had a pledge for me, and it's that I'll come to you with the truth,
[2:21:45.220 --> 2:21:51.220]  at least as good as my human temporal truth can get. Because as the Bible says, we all see through a
[2:21:51.220 --> 2:21:56.820]  rose-colored, darkly kind of a foggy lens that distorts what we actually can perceive so that
[2:21:56.820 --> 2:22:01.460]  everything we do is actually a fallen sin. Everything we do is actually a twisted distortion of
[2:22:01.460 --> 2:22:07.860]  God's will. So when I tell you the truth, it's the best truth this fallen creature's got. But I'll
[2:22:07.860 --> 2:22:13.540]  tell you, it's all I got. And when I tell you that this country and the world is under major
[2:22:13.540 --> 2:22:18.660]  satanic threat, you don't need me to tell you that. You can look out the window. You can look into
[2:22:18.660 --> 2:22:23.860]  your own family. You can turn on the news. You can see it. But you've got this commitment. I do
[2:22:23.860 --> 2:22:27.300]  recognize the truth of God. So to you, we're going to win this fight, but it's going to be hard.
[2:22:27.860 --> 2:22:32.740]  And I want to keep M4 Wars in the main position to fight. And it only happens when you support
[2:22:32.740 --> 2:22:38.180]  what you've been doing. So again, I thank you, but go to m4warstore.com, buy the product, spread
[2:22:38.180 --> 2:22:42.900]  the word because that's how we're going to win. Yeah, I think you will. Ignorance does not equal
[2:22:42.900 --> 2:22:50.660]  bliss. Ignorance equals slavery. If you're ignorant, walking through a field at night that there's a
[2:22:50.660 --> 2:22:56.020]  six foot hole up ahead, you're going to step in it and probably break your ankle or maybe worse.
[2:22:56.580 --> 2:23:02.180]  Well, it's the same thing happening to human civilization. The industrialized age really
[2:23:02.180 --> 2:23:05.860]  empowered humanity in many respects, but also took us away from the land and made us very,
[2:23:05.860 --> 2:23:10.660]  very domesticated and very, very easy to manipulate. And now corruption and predatory activity
[2:23:10.660 --> 2:23:16.180]  can hide behind that complexity. Now, I know what's going on behind the complexity because I go read
[2:23:16.180 --> 2:23:20.500]  what the UN and the Rockefeller Foundation and the Davos Group and the Bilderberg Group and
[2:23:20.500 --> 2:23:27.940]  all their subsidiaries, what the Club of Rome say. So I know exactly what's going on. Not because
[2:23:27.940 --> 2:23:33.220]  I'm even that cool or special a person, but I'm actually one of the empowered and informed
[2:23:33.220 --> 2:23:36.900]  because I'm a history buff. I know that those that don't know history don't repeat it.
[2:23:36.900 --> 2:23:40.740]  The globalists think you're stupid. They laugh at you because you won't research their own admissions.
[2:23:40.740 --> 2:24:00.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:10.740 --> 2:24:39.780]  What's incredible is Shane Stoners here, one of my good buddies in high school.
[2:24:40.820 --> 2:24:44.740]  And he's just an amazing guy. It's not about kissing your ass. It's the truth.
[2:24:45.460 --> 2:24:49.300]  Growing up around my grandfathers and all these old Texas people that are almost all dead
[2:24:49.940 --> 2:24:53.780]  is they were always happy and excited. You go to eat dinner with them. You'd go ride around the
[2:24:53.780 --> 2:24:58.340]  ranch. You'd go to a museum with them. You'd go to the beach. There was always like this energy
[2:24:58.340 --> 2:25:02.660]  like these guys got something going on. They're excited. They love life. You know, they're confident.
[2:25:02.660 --> 2:25:08.180]  They're nice. And I just see less and less Texas and your whole family's like that. It's got that.
[2:25:08.180 --> 2:25:11.300]  What is it about Texas? Because everybody, everybody talks about Texas having something
[2:25:11.300 --> 2:25:15.940]  special or the South or the West or Montana. What is it and what is that spirit? Because
[2:25:15.940 --> 2:25:21.940]  you've definitely got it. Well, I mean, it's like it's made of people that, you know, like my family
[2:25:21.940 --> 2:25:27.860]  moved here from from Germany five generations ago because they wanted to go out into the West and
[2:25:27.860 --> 2:25:35.700]  be free. And so, you know, you're, and it's all, you know, that your success is based on how much
[2:25:35.700 --> 2:25:44.020]  you're willing to work and, and, and it's that cowboy spirit of the West. Freedom. Yeah. It's
[2:25:44.020 --> 2:25:50.340]  freedom. And now it's like everything you do with people see you exercising that freedom. They just
[2:25:50.340 --> 2:25:57.860]  want to stop it and take it away and, you know, put a stop to it. What do you think your great
[2:25:57.860 --> 2:26:00.900]  grandpa, Buck Stoner, because this is interesting stuff. If you don't want to talk about yourself,
[2:26:00.900 --> 2:26:05.620]  talk about him down to 102, you know, founder of the family dynasty. You guys are big successful folks
[2:26:05.620 --> 2:26:09.060]  here in Texas. I mean, hell, he worked with Al Capone during the whole, I mean, that's a crazy
[2:26:09.060 --> 2:26:15.780]  story right there. Yeah. That was back in the, the, the prohibition days and all that stuff. But
[2:26:17.700 --> 2:26:23.780]  man, he was born 1899. So, you know, there was even cars then. So I can't even imagine
[2:26:23.780 --> 2:26:30.580]  you, when something happened to you, that was your fault. That's kind of what, what I learned from,
[2:26:31.300 --> 2:26:37.540]  from him was, you know, there, you, you can't blame your troubles on somebody else. And now
[2:26:37.540 --> 2:26:40.500]  everybody wants to blame everybody. So Buck Stoner was the opposite of the victim.
[2:26:41.460 --> 2:26:45.700]  I mean, there was this, who would, back then nobody would listen to you. If you, if you tried to
[2:26:45.700 --> 2:26:50.980]  pull the victim mentality, nobody cared. You know, it's just everybody did their thing and, and
[2:26:50.980 --> 2:26:56.820]  and yeah, we've, we've gotten so far away from that. I don't know where we go.
[2:26:56.820 --> 2:27:00.740]  Those people like Buck built America though. I mean, that's, that's true.
[2:27:01.940 --> 2:27:08.260]  Yeah. And you know, it's that, it's that whole like the, the strong, create a great society. And
[2:27:08.260 --> 2:27:14.100]  then the, the weak create a, you know, I don't know what that, there's that cycle that I always mess
[2:27:14.100 --> 2:27:20.420]  up. Prosperity creates monsters, adversity creates men. Exactly. And so we're kind of in the, I
[2:27:20.420 --> 2:27:27.860]  think the, the prosperous time right now where, where, uh, we've got weak people, you know, running
[2:27:27.860 --> 2:27:34.020]  the show. What would Buck Stoner think about what's happened today? I mean, I can't even,
[2:27:34.020 --> 2:27:36.820]  I can't even imagine it's, he wouldn't, he would enjoy it. I'll tell you,
[2:27:38.260 --> 2:27:42.980]  actually he probably wouldn't even care. Like if, if somebody got on, on social media and,
[2:27:42.980 --> 2:27:48.100]  I mean, he's, he's like me, he wouldn't, he just lets it roll off. There it is. Hard times, great
[2:27:48.100 --> 2:27:52.660]  strong men. There it is. Strong men create good times, good times, create weak men,
[2:27:52.660 --> 2:27:58.660]  weak men create hard times. It's true. Yeah. I always, uh, I love that, that's saying, I always
[2:27:58.660 --> 2:28:05.300]  screw it up. So, uh, well, I did too. So let's get, listen, I'm not, this is the biggest,
[2:28:06.020 --> 2:28:10.500]  because they say the other big ones, like 3000, they're saying five to 6000, maybe more boats.
[2:28:10.500 --> 2:28:14.260]  This was the biggest Trump rally yet. They're like, oh, they're not wearing masks. You're in
[2:28:14.260 --> 2:28:18.020]  the fricking water. If you believe the virus is real, this was a big deal this last Saturday.
[2:28:18.020 --> 2:28:22.180]  It was. And also it's because it's in Austin, that is a very liberal city.
[2:28:23.620 --> 2:28:28.180]  And that's kind of why I didn't really know what to expect. And when you, you could literally just
[2:28:28.180 --> 2:28:33.620]  get out and walk from boat to boat. It looked like to me from the air that. And this is very
[2:28:33.620 --> 2:28:36.900]  even early on, I'm told even more boats show up. This is like 3000 boats right there. This is the
[2:28:36.900 --> 2:28:42.660]  very beginning. This is right around noon. Yeah. And later on, uh, I don't know how those. Well,
[2:28:42.660 --> 2:28:45.380]  you know, I don't know if you saw the clip, Trump said, we need to have these daily,
[2:28:45.380 --> 2:28:49.620]  you know, for, for not, you said, Hey, I love them every weekend. We should have them daily.
[2:28:49.620 --> 2:28:52.100]  So I think we're definitely doing Saturday. I'm going to be out there.
[2:28:52.900 --> 2:28:55.300]  All right. Well, we'll be flying around. All right. Good.
[2:28:57.940 --> 2:29:01.620]  Keep going. I don't want to take over the interview here. You know, I'm well known for that.
[2:29:01.620 --> 2:29:06.100]  Let's, let's play these clips. Let's play long shot a boat parade with audio or what's
[2:29:06.100 --> 2:29:09.220]  what you want to play here? Yeah, just to do a long shot. They've been playing it.
[2:29:09.220 --> 2:29:16.100]  Uh, it's the, uh, my first, uh, my first pass over the top of all the boats and, uh,
[2:29:27.460 --> 2:29:30.580]  look at that. That's amazing. And you just go and go and go.
[2:29:31.300 --> 2:29:36.100]  This goes on. I mean, I don't know if they could, uh, if they could, uh, speed it up, but
[2:29:36.100 --> 2:29:41.540]  this literally goes on for 30 minutes of me just flying over like that.
[2:29:43.220 --> 2:29:46.420]  But how much freedom is it? They want to get ripped. That's my next point.
[2:29:46.420 --> 2:29:51.460]  Bezos just got approval for these big skyscrapers that send these drones out that deliver everything,
[2:29:51.460 --> 2:29:55.540]  but they don't want helicopters, helicopters in the future. These skies empty. There's no
[2:29:55.540 --> 2:29:59.700]  helicopters up there and they're way safer than cars. Well, and also I've been hearing about these,
[2:29:59.700 --> 2:30:04.340]  uh, this air mobility where they take people and they put them in these big giant drones
[2:30:04.340 --> 2:30:09.700]  and they're going to be able to go, uh, it's going to alleviate traffic and notice it's not,
[2:30:09.700 --> 2:30:14.500]  it's not human driven where it pilots there. You talk to a guy, everybody wants robot.
[2:30:15.300 --> 2:30:17.300]  It's the same groups for attacks. I'm saying they're attacking.
[2:30:17.860 --> 2:30:21.540]  They're attacking human flyers, but saying, don't worry, Bezos will have your new deal
[2:30:21.540 --> 2:30:24.500]  or a robot flies you. No, I don't want that. Yeah. And also they,
[2:30:25.140 --> 2:30:30.500]  what people won't realize is that drones are way noisier than helicopters. The noisiest thing
[2:30:30.500 --> 2:30:35.860]  on my helicopter is the tail rotor because of the diameter. The, the main rotor just makes that
[2:30:35.860 --> 2:30:42.740]  little, little wispy noise. Yeah. But the, uh, the tail. Sounds like a, like a, like a lawnmower.
[2:30:42.740 --> 2:30:47.780]  Yeah. Um, a drone is just a bunch of those smaller diameter. Um,
[2:30:48.420 --> 2:30:52.420]  and it's a bunch of crap and then they have you sign a form. They know it's way more dangerous.
[2:30:52.420 --> 2:30:57.060]  We need humans running things. Why not use technology that's been around for a hundred years?
[2:30:57.060 --> 2:31:00.740]  I mean, helicopters is proven. It's been proven. I mean, we use them every day to,
[2:31:00.740 --> 2:31:04.820]  well, they admit to in those, in those scales that it's the proven technology that matters.
[2:31:04.820 --> 2:31:07.060]  Yeah. And, but right now they're trying to develop some new thing.
[2:31:07.700 --> 2:31:14.100]  Uh, electric engines, uh, they don't auto rotate. So if you have an engine freeze up,
[2:31:14.100 --> 2:31:18.740]  falls, if you're falling, well, they have them now where they have a ballistic parachutes,
[2:31:18.740 --> 2:31:24.180]  but you're still going to come down really hard. Um, but those same places that are looking forward
[2:31:24.180 --> 2:31:30.260]  to having those drones will not let me or anybody I know land a helicopter.
[2:31:30.260 --> 2:31:34.900]  That's what I'm saying is I see like one helicopter crashes in Hawaii like twice a year.
[2:31:34.900 --> 2:31:39.140]  We have to ban helicopters with 10 million people. It's this. So they're,
[2:31:39.140 --> 2:31:43.620]  they're the same groups are demonizing human flight. Oh, robots are safe. Well, they're not.
[2:31:43.620 --> 2:31:46.340]  Well, and the thing about the, all the accidents that have been happening,
[2:31:46.340 --> 2:31:51.940]  even with the Kobe Bryant, uh, that was fog, that was fog as whether it wasn't like a perfectly
[2:31:51.940 --> 2:31:56.260]  good helicopter was flying along and then just came apart and crashed. Well, the guy took a risk
[2:31:56.260 --> 2:32:01.060]  in the end. Yeah. That's kind of what happened. So why do they authorize him to fly now? I guess.
[2:32:01.060 --> 2:32:06.100]  Um, it's my understanding. They really didn't. They just kind of give him his, his own discretion.
[2:32:06.660 --> 2:32:10.820]  And he went in and, and, uh, just it closed it on so fast that.
[2:32:11.380 --> 2:32:16.740]  So you don't fly in fog. No, nobody flies in fog unless you've got, you know, like a
[2:32:16.740 --> 2:32:22.980]  flair, a black Hawk will do it because it's got special equipment that has radar, uh, to the
[2:32:22.980 --> 2:32:28.500]  ground and those things can hover on, on their own. So I have to hover mine.
[2:32:29.780 --> 2:32:35.380]  You're a good helicopter pilot though. Well, I've been doing it since 2003. So that was my
[2:32:35.380 --> 2:32:40.580]  first flight. So people don't realize I've been flying that long. It's fun stuff. Shane
[2:32:40.580 --> 2:32:45.620]  Stonner is our guest in studio. We're not burning down police stations. We're not shooting cops
[2:32:45.620 --> 2:32:49.300]  in the head or people at checkpoints. We're just, we're just driving boats around and flying,
[2:32:49.300 --> 2:32:57.220]  flying American flags, which means we're terrorists. And this weekend, the second Travis County,
[2:32:58.260 --> 2:33:04.100]  Lake Travis, Trump boat rally is going to happen. Noon in front of Emerald Point again. I will
[2:33:04.100 --> 2:33:09.460]  be there this time in the air. And then I guess we'll land somewhere. I guess the steakhouse.
[2:33:09.460 --> 2:33:13.540]  Shane also has the Stonner steakhouse is always sold out and always full. She can't even get in
[2:33:13.540 --> 2:33:19.220]  there, but we'll make room for you. Make room for everybody, huh? All right, we'll come back and
[2:33:19.220 --> 2:33:22.900]  play more of these clips straight ahead. I'm Alex Jones. What a crazy time to be alive.
[2:33:22.900 --> 2:33:28.420]  infowars.com, newswars.com. Only way those clips get out is you sharing them. We'll be right back,
[2:33:28.420 --> 2:33:35.940]  stay with us. And don't forget, Owen Troyer takes over with the war room at 3 p.m. Central. And then
[2:33:35.940 --> 2:33:43.780]  we've got no more fake news before that. This is going to come down to the fight over how many
[2:33:43.780 --> 2:33:46.980]  people are awake and how many aren't. They're going to contest the election. They're going to say
[2:33:46.980 --> 2:33:51.620]  Trump lost. They're super pissed that I'm on air. I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want
[2:33:51.620 --> 2:33:56.100]  them muted. I think they are horrible for our society. You kept us on air. We did the analysis
[2:33:56.100 --> 2:34:00.980]  first. It's now gone mainstream. We continue to be the epicenter. And what they've said directly
[2:34:00.980 --> 2:34:06.660]  to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want. And you need to
[2:34:06.660 --> 2:34:10.180]  stop right now. And they're very, very serious. Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil
[2:34:10.180 --> 2:34:14.580]  worshiping chomplesters. It's not going to happen. So they are moving now to destroy me. I used to
[2:34:14.580 --> 2:34:19.940]  say support infowars. Rescue infowars. Save yourself. Save the world. We're in this together.
[2:34:19.940 --> 2:34:24.020]  Because let me tell you something. Communisms up here, infowars is the damn blocking it,
[2:34:24.020 --> 2:34:28.180]  which is all of us together supporting. And you and I are all down here with our families. My
[2:34:28.180 --> 2:34:34.500]  children are right here. But I need money to fight a war. And I need word of mouth. And I need prayer.
[2:34:34.500 --> 2:34:40.180]  And I need action. Because that damn is going to come down. Trump's told you, hell's coming.
[2:34:41.940 --> 2:34:50.420]  In Germany, in Australia, in Canada, and now even in Ohio, every blue state, every blue city
[2:34:51.060 --> 2:34:57.220]  is announcing that they are establishing emergency COVID centers for people that refuse to be tested
[2:34:57.220 --> 2:35:02.900]  or people that are tested but refuse to stay in place while the results are coming back or those
[2:35:02.900 --> 2:35:07.940]  that supposedly break quarantine. This, of course, is all based on the tests that are over 90%
[2:35:08.660 --> 2:35:16.500]  fraudulent and were designed to be so. This is a power grab. The world government globalist system
[2:35:16.500 --> 2:35:23.300]  is in trouble. All over the planet, free peoples are trying to pull out of it. And every blue area,
[2:35:23.300 --> 2:35:28.980]  I use the term blue as if the U.S. for blue for Democrats, red for Republicans, is basically
[2:35:28.980 --> 2:35:35.140]  globalist or communist and authoritarian. And they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian
[2:35:35.140 --> 2:35:39.300]  takeover because they know the world's waiting to them. It's a very simple equation. It's illegal.
[2:35:39.300 --> 2:35:47.300]  We must resist it. The mask is more than just a symbol of subservience being a blind follower,
[2:35:47.300 --> 2:35:51.940]  not knowing facts and science. It's a symbol that you have been turned into a subhuman.
[2:35:51.940 --> 2:35:56.020]  And they tell you, you are non-essential. Remember, first they said, no more industry.
[2:35:56.020 --> 2:35:59.860]  You'll be a service economy. And now they tell you service is non-essential. This has been the
[2:35:59.860 --> 2:36:04.500]  post-industrial world plan the whole time. And Operation Long Step and other documents, the
[2:36:05.220 --> 2:36:10.900]  Rockefeller Foundation admits that this is how they're going to slowly teach you to be totally
[2:36:10.900 --> 2:36:15.460]  poor. And under their control, so you can finally be starved to death of nutrients and then killed
[2:36:15.460 --> 2:36:20.340]  with very, very weak bio weapons that won't affect anyone that actually gets their RDA of
[2:36:20.340 --> 2:36:24.500]  vitamins and minerals. And so that's the plan for you and your family. Now that you're tuned
[2:36:24.500 --> 2:36:28.500]  into this broadcast, you check this out for yourself, you know it's true. So let's start
[2:36:28.500 --> 2:36:34.740]  warning the sheep. Let's start educating them now. I just went and swam at the lake and I walked
[2:36:34.740 --> 2:36:38.580]  around for 20 minutes educating people. I forgot all the water. It's that simple. We must take
[2:36:38.580 --> 2:36:44.020]  action now or be slaves forever. This is life and death. I talk about all the horrible things
[2:36:44.020 --> 2:36:48.340]  that are happening. And I point out that the globalist are eugenics death goal because it's true.
[2:36:48.340 --> 2:36:53.860]  I don't say it to scare you. A lot of people say, man, this show is dark. Well, you've got to know
[2:36:53.860 --> 2:36:58.500]  you're dealing with evil if you're going to defeat it. And if we just listen to the surface of what
[2:36:58.500 --> 2:37:04.100]  the NWO propagandists were saying, they have reasons to sell this garbage to the general public.
[2:37:04.100 --> 2:37:09.540]  But if you just scratch the surface, they're so arrogant, they've all written detailed blueprints
[2:37:09.540 --> 2:37:14.020]  of this plan and more and more being honest about it. Because there comes a point
[2:37:14.020 --> 2:37:20.260]  where, as David Icke says, they have to stop hiding it and start selling it. So we're at the
[2:37:20.260 --> 2:37:27.140]  point of the emergence now. And it's coming out in the open. And some people, under mass Stockholm
[2:37:27.140 --> 2:37:32.260]  syndrome, are going to submit to any level of tyranny that others are going to fight. This isn't
[2:37:32.260 --> 2:37:38.100]  like some old dictatorship that you could submit to it and join it and be okay. No. This thing is
[2:37:38.100 --> 2:37:47.460]  post-human and exterminism research. What that is. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:00.500 --> 2:38:04.660]  All right. We got Jimmy Dean bringing to stand here, folks, not known for sausage
[2:38:04.660 --> 2:38:08.660]  but a country music singer. I'm Alex Jones, your host, James Tyler, my old buddy,
[2:38:08.660 --> 2:38:15.460]  helicopter pilot patrons here who witnessed the biggest boat rally of Trump yet, the biggest
[2:38:15.460 --> 2:38:19.780]  flotilla. And this Saturday we're doing it again. Who knows how big it will be. I'm going to be out
[2:38:19.780 --> 2:38:22.660]  there with him. He'll be in his helicopter. I'm going to have a boat down there. I'll be in the
[2:38:22.660 --> 2:38:27.620]  boat and the helicopter. He wants to do it. So I appreciate that. But Shane, pulling back from
[2:38:27.620 --> 2:38:33.620]  this, seriously, I felt like I'm watching astronauts when you guys are up there with people jumping out
[2:38:33.620 --> 2:38:40.020]  and skydiving and all the, it's like, this is better than a movie. I mean, I go see movies.
[2:38:40.020 --> 2:38:44.660]  They're boring. They're not real. This is real. This got me really excited. I mean, you didn't
[2:38:44.660 --> 2:38:48.340]  ask to come on. I begged you to come on. It's hard to get you on air. This is some killer stuff,
[2:38:48.340 --> 2:38:53.700]  man. Well, thanks. I mean, this is a real world, baby. Listen, I love doing this. This is the most
[2:38:53.700 --> 2:39:00.820]  fun thing in the world for me to do is go out and fly. Not only is it a useful tool to get
[2:39:00.820 --> 2:39:05.940]  places fast, but I mean, it's also fun. Oh, Clint Eastwood. It says for 40 years, he's probably
[2:39:05.940 --> 2:39:12.340]  flies everywhere. I mean, I look, I don't know. I mean, now that I, that's my main source of
[2:39:12.340 --> 2:39:18.580]  getting around. Oh, also, I think it's a, we should mention that we have discovered the actual
[2:39:19.380 --> 2:39:23.860]  Rob do shot this, not me. I thought it was me. I just saw smoke and I was like, that's my footage
[2:39:23.860 --> 2:39:28.340]  as I shot this. Rob is a better camera guy than me. He shot this. Well, I just want to make sure
[2:39:28.340 --> 2:39:32.980]  Rob got his, you saw my fat ass on the shot of Rob. He said, that's actually me doing that. I'm
[2:39:32.980 --> 2:39:36.420]  like, okay, I saw a really good camera footage. It was a really good job though, didn't it?
[2:39:37.300 --> 2:39:40.580]  It's like he should do this for a living. Let's see it again. Let's just roll it again.
[2:39:41.860 --> 2:39:44.900]  Anyways, getting, we got a bunch of these clips that we haven't done the Reddit video. Let's talk
[2:39:44.900 --> 2:39:52.660]  about local TV says that you harass everybody and a bunch of stuff. Yeah, they're like I was
[2:39:52.660 --> 2:39:59.380]  saying earlier that one of the boats, the guy waved me in closer and I, I obliged. I went in,
[2:39:59.380 --> 2:40:04.020]  got close and you could tell by the look on all their faces that they were enjoying it. And that
[2:40:04.020 --> 2:40:08.980]  was my, let's just say you got flashed a lot. I mean, there was a few times, I also got mooned
[2:40:08.980 --> 2:40:15.780]  a lot too, believe it or not, but, uh, this is exciting. So I was, you know, that was my whole
[2:40:15.780 --> 2:40:19.860]  point was to get down there and wave to people and, and you can see they were all excited and
[2:40:19.860 --> 2:40:23.540]  having a great time. Oh, I talked to folks whether they said it just made it like crazy. Yeah, if
[2:40:23.540 --> 2:40:27.460]  you, if you can play the audio to this clip. Yeah, play it again with audio guys. Go ahead and roll it.
[2:40:32.180 --> 2:40:37.140]  Feel like Magnum PI, man. Can we go out to the Magnum PI theme place?
[2:40:39.300 --> 2:40:43.540]  And see the way this video is cut, it looks like I just die bomb them, but I'm, I'm actually,
[2:40:44.180 --> 2:40:46.980]  well, they waved to it because the left says everything's right, but you got it.
[2:40:46.980 --> 2:40:51.140]  And here's from my point of view. It's very controlled. Uh,
[2:40:53.060 --> 2:40:58.420]  you know, the left just demonizes everything. So how much safer is the helicopter statistically
[2:40:58.420 --> 2:41:03.700]  of the car? Like five times? It is, it is statistically safer. Yeah. Um, I mean, not,
[2:41:04.740 --> 2:41:09.460]  even every helicopter crash does not end in a fatality. I mean, there's only like one out of
[2:41:09.460 --> 2:41:15.060]  like, I believe it's one out of five or six. Exactly. But it's like COVID. They make a huge
[2:41:15.060 --> 2:41:18.900]  deal out of each death. So it looks like it's really bad. Like, Oh, I know somebody died. Like,
[2:41:18.900 --> 2:41:23.700]  well, statistics 77 people died in Australia. Total martial law lockdown. Well, they'll make
[2:41:23.700 --> 2:41:32.260]  a big deal about, um, I remember New York when the, uh, the blade guy, uh, went down in the Hudson
[2:41:32.260 --> 2:41:36.500]  and he swam away from the helicopter and then they started wanting to ban helicopters. And I was
[2:41:36.500 --> 2:41:41.380]  thinking, you know, he, yeah, he wrecked that helicopter, but he didn't, he didn't even get hurt.
[2:41:41.380 --> 2:41:45.460]  Well, that's the thing is they're trying to ban risk. That's what a humanity is about.
[2:41:46.180 --> 2:41:50.340]  That's the wall, wall, west. That's, I always tell people, uh, you know, what's not dangerous is
[2:41:50.340 --> 2:41:55.060]  sitting on your couch wearing a helmet, but it's not very much fun. I mean, that's not statistically
[2:41:55.060 --> 2:41:59.060]  you die 20 years younger. Yeah, you would, uh, you would, if you think about it, that's actually
[2:41:59.060 --> 2:42:03.620]  dangerous to sit on your couch. Um, so life is dangerous. You might as well do something. If
[2:42:03.620 --> 2:42:08.740]  you don't excite your brain, if you like, but they've cut the brains open of like 95 year old
[2:42:08.740 --> 2:42:14.180]  famous, uh, composers. The brain's all shriveled, but the guy that, the day he died was super smart.
[2:42:14.180 --> 2:42:18.980]  They speak five languages, right? Because the neurons stay connected. But my thing is, uh,
[2:42:18.980 --> 2:42:22.260]  everybody only hears about helicopters when there's a crash. Right now there's
[2:42:22.820 --> 2:42:27.460]  hundreds of thousands of helicopter operations going on and nothing is, is happening today.
[2:42:27.460 --> 2:42:31.940]  But if one goes down, it's front page news. And so people think, no, I agree, it's dangerous.
[2:42:31.940 --> 2:42:37.140]  And then with self driving cars and self drones crash, that's not a big deal. So I'm for humans
[2:42:37.140 --> 2:42:42.820]  running things. I want human technology out there. I don't want Bezos' crap. Yeah. And so when I see
[2:42:42.820 --> 2:42:47.540]  me flying low on the, on the water, they think, well, he's obviously doing something dangerous.
[2:42:47.540 --> 2:42:51.540]  And so they, but they're going to be sitting drones into your yard. By the way, you've ran
[2:42:51.540 --> 2:42:55.780]  it about Bezos and these helicopter things are dangerous. Yeah. Like you said, it's like six
[2:42:55.780 --> 2:43:01.700]  tail rotors. It'll be six times louder. Absolutely. And, uh, and the drone's flying around actually
[2:43:01.700 --> 2:43:06.260]  has a risk to other pilots. In fact, we almost ran in and I almost ran into a drone one time.
[2:43:06.260 --> 2:43:11.780]  We were flying around downtown and big one came right up. Yeah. It was, it was eye level to us and
[2:43:12.660 --> 2:43:16.660]  they kind of went off to the left and we went off to the right, but then we just passed each other.
[2:43:16.660 --> 2:43:20.260]  He did. Luckily he was watching. He flew right up in front of us. He went, yeah.
[2:43:20.260 --> 2:43:24.260]  But still, I mean, if that would have flown into us, that would have been a, that would have been
[2:43:24.260 --> 2:43:29.940]  fun. That was an Imperial prob droid. You always got to bring it back to Star Wars. Well, I mean,
[2:43:29.940 --> 2:43:34.580]  not that I'm even into it. Aren't you glad Star Wars, the whole franchise is bankrupt now because
[2:43:34.580 --> 2:43:43.300]  they made it SJW. Yeah. I mean, it, yeah, it's kind of going down. Oh, uh, especially the, uh,
[2:43:43.300 --> 2:43:48.740]  the Han Solo was, I thought, extra. Did you think 30 years ago when we were in high school,
[2:43:48.740 --> 2:43:56.820]  we'd be here right now? No, I did not think that. So, uh, did you think your brother and your parents
[2:43:56.820 --> 2:44:01.380]  would be in, in, in Yellowstone TV show? Yeah, I heard they were going to be on that, that show,
[2:44:01.380 --> 2:44:09.060]  but, uh, yeah, my brother is, uh, and his son, uh, Rocker, my nephew, my mom, dad, they were all in
[2:44:09.060 --> 2:44:13.860]  that, uh, season three episode, I think seven. And that was the worst work. You didn't even cast,
[2:44:13.860 --> 2:44:20.020]  they didn't cast that. They just got the job. I mean, uh, I think, uh, they wrote that with my
[2:44:20.020 --> 2:44:26.660]  brother and, and, uh, nephew in mind. So they left me out of it because I, I don't wear boots in a
[2:44:26.660 --> 2:44:32.020]  cowboy hat. So they left me out of it. But you are playing next Saturday at the Steiner Steakhouse
[2:44:32.020 --> 2:44:35.060]  out by Lake Travis and people can even get into it. Well, we'll see us play.
[2:44:35.940 --> 2:44:41.140]  Yeah. I mean, I, uh, I retired from the music business, but, uh, on Saturdays, when the weather's
[2:44:41.140 --> 2:44:47.460]  good, I'll, uh, you do a great job. In closing the time we have, I'm going to come introduce the
[2:44:47.460 --> 2:44:53.780]  next guest to us, uh, Mr. Rappaport and, and play some clips I haven't gotten to. What happens if
[2:44:53.780 --> 2:44:57.380]  Trump doesn't win? I mean, he should win, but what are they still the election?
[2:44:58.820 --> 2:45:05.620]  Well, um, I know that we, you know, we won't burn the cities down. Uh, we will, uh,
[2:45:06.900 --> 2:45:11.860]  make the best of it and go on. That's the, that's kind of, I see as the difference. Um, I think
[2:45:11.860 --> 2:45:17.380]  it's, you know, when Trump wins that, uh, that's when the, the writing and the looting and all that
[2:45:17.380 --> 2:45:23.860]  stuff will, will, uh, start back up. I agree. So what, what does Trump do about that? Cause he
[2:45:23.860 --> 2:45:28.100]  needs to send in the military and the police, but then if he does, it's an agile prop. That's
[2:45:28.100 --> 2:45:32.420]  what they call it. They want to get that fight going. So what, what do you do when you're damned,
[2:45:32.420 --> 2:45:38.820]  if you do, you're damned, if you don't. I mean, I think it's, uh, better to be damned if you do. I
[2:45:38.820 --> 2:45:44.660]  mean, uh, there's been definitely precedents where, you know, when they were, uh, trying to
[2:45:44.660 --> 2:45:51.620]  in segregation and in schools, they brought in the, uh, military, nobody ever, nobody ever
[2:45:51.620 --> 2:45:58.020]  questions that move. So, uh, I mean, if the point of the government is to keep the citizens safe,
[2:45:58.020 --> 2:46:04.820]  and if, if, uh, that's really, I think their only job. And, uh, if you let the city or whatever
[2:46:04.820 --> 2:46:10.180]  abandoned you and, and, uh, they're letting lawlessness take over, I think it's the government's
[2:46:10.180 --> 2:46:13.780]  job to step in and, and restore. Well, that's it. The Democrats know they're not being held
[2:46:13.780 --> 2:46:16.260]  accountable. So they're just trying anything right now. And I think they should be able to come.
[2:46:17.220 --> 2:46:21.780]  I mean, right now, I think it's, you know, they're, they're, they know that the longer
[2:46:21.780 --> 2:46:26.020]  that they can keep this going, the, the more it hurts, uh, Trump's chances for election,
[2:46:26.020 --> 2:46:28.740]  reelection. So they're just going to keep this going and keep.
[2:46:28.740 --> 2:46:32.260]  Well, I agree with you. They thought that, but people are smart enough to see through it. I
[2:46:32.260 --> 2:46:38.020]  think it's a backfire. Absolutely. I mean, you could only, I mean, the, the American people are
[2:46:38.020 --> 2:46:42.980]  not stupid. I mean, you know, if you say, I mean, people think as a whole the society is stupid,
[2:46:42.980 --> 2:46:47.300]  but I'm telling you, you know, when you talk to them individually, everybody understands
[2:46:47.300 --> 2:46:52.260]  what's going on. It's actually, I agree. So how do the Democrats get punished for this? Because
[2:46:52.260 --> 2:46:55.700]  if they don't get in trouble, they're going to keep doing stuff like this. Like what do they do
[2:46:55.700 --> 2:47:00.900]  next? They don't get in trouble. Like when this fails, what do they do next? I don't know. I'm,
[2:47:01.940 --> 2:47:06.180]  I'm not the, the, the one to know what's, what's going to happen.
[2:47:08.180 --> 2:47:12.100]  Oh, I know. I wish I did. I agree with you. I don't know either. That's why I'm asking.
[2:47:12.100 --> 2:47:16.900]  We should all be asked that question. This next Saturday, 12 noon, Emerald Point,
[2:47:17.780 --> 2:47:21.220]  the next big boat parade, President Trump said, do it every day. We can't do it every day.
[2:47:21.220 --> 2:47:25.700]  We'll do it every Saturday. It's a horrible sacrifice I'm making. Let's just do it every day.
[2:47:27.140 --> 2:47:32.500]  Start doing, starting tomorrow every day. Gosh, what was the lake like? I mean, all the gas
[2:47:32.500 --> 2:47:38.180]  stations were empty. I didn't even think about that. How would you even gotten gas if you ran out of,
[2:47:38.180 --> 2:47:42.820]  because there's, the infrastructure is not there for everyone. There's usually a couple
[2:47:42.820 --> 2:47:47.860]  hundred boats. Yeah. Now there's five, 6,000. I just make sure you filled up before you got on
[2:47:47.860 --> 2:47:51.060]  the lake. Well, it's a manifestation of what's happened. They want to keep us locked down.
[2:47:51.060 --> 2:47:55.300]  They want to keep us shut down. It's not going to work. All right. Well, I appreciate you coming in.
[2:47:55.300 --> 2:47:59.540]  Any websites we should plug, Shane? I've got nothing going on. Oh yeah. I'm glad to see you,
[2:47:59.540 --> 2:48:06.260]  man. Good seeing you, brother. Hey, we got to get, we got to get Joe Rogan flying around your
[2:48:06.260 --> 2:48:11.540]  helicopter. Hey, I mean, Joe hasn't called me. Well, he called me up. He goes,
[2:48:11.540 --> 2:48:15.380]  Hamry flying around in Tim Kennedy's helicopter. And I go, oh, you mean Shane Steiner's
[2:48:15.380 --> 2:48:19.300]  helicopter? He's going to have one soon. I know, but it's good. So I said, no, you'll be flying.
[2:48:20.100 --> 2:48:24.260]  It's all good. All right, brother. Thank you, man. All right. I'm coming right back. I'm going to
[2:48:24.260 --> 2:48:35.060]  introduce our next guest. Stay with us. Well, Mark Zuckerberg on paper two weeks ago put in hundreds
[2:48:35.060 --> 2:48:41.060]  of millions of dollars with Bloomberg to launch this operation red mirage to contest the election
[2:48:41.060 --> 2:48:46.500]  when it's overwhelmingly clear that Trump has won on election night. Now he's come out the statement
[2:48:46.500 --> 2:48:51.300]  and told all the media in the United States that they better get behind saying that Trump basically
[2:48:51.300 --> 2:48:55.860]  lost. They're not going to let Trump declare victory even though it's overwhelming. They'll
[2:48:55.860 --> 2:49:00.580]  have 95% of the vote done on election night. And even if you added all the other votes in
[2:49:00.580 --> 2:49:05.220]  against it, he'd be the winner. They are going to steal this election. They're preparing everyone.
[2:49:05.220 --> 2:49:10.340]  You've seen all the scams they've already run. Trump is surrounded by tyrants, but he has we the
[2:49:10.340 --> 2:49:16.260]  people and he has true media, not independent media, the real media. So now more than ever,
[2:49:16.260 --> 2:49:20.180]  it's critical to share the live streams, the videos, the articles and the information info
[2:49:20.180 --> 2:49:25.700]  wars.com because the globalist fear at most things. We were the first to expose their plan
[2:49:25.700 --> 2:49:30.340]  to contest the election and drag it out to keep the American people from reelecting president Trump.

[2:50:51.940 --> 2:50:56.100]  just raised felon lawyer michael cohen has a new book out it's an election year quickie that he
[2:50:56.100 --> 2:51:01.860]  probably hasn't even read it attacks donald trump someone should ask him have you read it quick what
[2:51:01.860 --> 2:51:06.420]  chapter three about no one will ask him that of course the media naturally have swung into
[2:51:07.060 --> 2:51:12.740]  formation and promote it cnn is leading the charge tomorrow night michael cohen is on cnn for a
[2:51:12.740 --> 2:51:17.860]  much hyped prime time interview you can imagine how many tough questions he's gonna get on cnn
[2:51:17.860 --> 2:51:23.060]  probably not too many for michael cohen cnn is like a second home he's got a lot of close friends
[2:51:23.060 --> 2:51:26.980]  over there including we told you about this last week the channel's chief bodybuilding
[2:51:26.980 --> 2:51:31.780]  correspondent chris qualmo will have much more on the friendship between cohen and
[2:51:31.780 --> 2:51:37.540]  qualmo later in the week but chris qualmo is not cohen's only ally at cnn cohen is also close
[2:51:37.540 --> 2:51:42.580]  to cnn president jeff zucker the man who moon lights is a democratic campaign operative
[2:51:42.580 --> 2:51:46.420]  cohen and zucker once had kids at the same private school in new york cohen served on the
[2:51:46.420 --> 2:51:51.380]  board of the school was zucker's ex-wife jeff zucker and michael cohen have long been personal
[2:51:51.380 --> 2:51:56.340]  friends at least to the extent that narcissists have the capacity for personal friendship the
[2:51:56.340 --> 2:52:01.860]  relationship tells you a lot about how things actually work in media and in politics case and
[2:52:01.860 --> 2:52:09.060]  point a march 10th 2016 that was the day of the final republican primary debate cohen called jeff
[2:52:09.060 --> 2:52:13.700]  zucker on his cell phone cnn was hosting the debate that night in miami and cohen who was working
[2:52:13.700 --> 2:52:18.180]  for donald trump at the time wanted to check in about it was zucker almost immediately started
[2:52:18.180 --> 2:52:23.380]  bragging about himself as he is want to do after a few pro forma words about their family zucker
[2:52:23.380 --> 2:52:29.380]  launched into an extended lecture about his own importance here's the thing zucker announced to cohen
[2:52:29.380 --> 2:52:35.540]  you cannot be elected president of the united states without cnn fox and msnbc are irrelevant
[2:52:35.540 --> 2:52:40.580]  irrelevant in electing a general election candidate if you want to run the country in other words
[2:52:40.580 --> 2:52:46.180]  jeff zucker said you've got to sniff my throne it's not that cnn needs the help you explain quote
[2:52:46.180 --> 2:52:52.740]  we're killing it we're doing great but donald trump badly needs cnn quote you guys have had great
[2:52:52.740 --> 2:52:57.620]  instincts great guts great understanding of everything but you're missing the boat on how it
[2:52:57.620 --> 2:53:04.980]  works going forward oh how it works going forward okay michael cohen replies why don't you email
[2:53:04.980 --> 2:53:11.060]  donald trump and tell him that and at that point for the first time in the conversation jeff zucker
[2:53:11.060 --> 2:53:16.980]  pauses it turns out that jeff zucker doesn't like to write things down sneaky people never do
[2:53:16.980 --> 2:53:23.540]  so here's what he says next i'm very conscious of not putting too much in email as you're a
[2:53:23.540 --> 2:53:31.780]  lawyer as you understand and you know and as fond as i am of the boss he also has a tendency like
[2:53:31.780 --> 2:53:38.660]  you know if i call him or i email him he then is capable of going out in his next rally and
[2:53:38.660 --> 2:53:45.060]  saying that we just talked and i can't have that if you know what i'm saying people would know i talked
[2:53:45.060 --> 2:53:50.100]  to trump and i can't have that if you know what i'm saying yeah we know what you're saying jeff
[2:53:50.100 --> 2:53:54.980]  zucker you're saying that secretly when you think no one is watching you're more than happy to play
[2:53:54.980 --> 2:54:00.740]  all sides you can brag about how powerful you are the big-time network honcho kingmaker the man
[2:54:00.740 --> 2:54:06.340]  who decides who's president like all tiny insecure people you will mix flattery with your swagger
[2:54:06.340 --> 2:54:10.980]  along the way you refer to donald trump as the boss even when he's not on the call you're happy
[2:54:10.980 --> 2:54:16.820]  to do that what you don't want is anyone in your tiny self-righteous left-wing rich person world to
[2:54:16.820 --> 2:54:21.860]  know that you're doing it what would don laman think if he knew you were talking to orange satan
[2:54:21.860 --> 2:54:27.140]  rick balvin might storm off the set the world would conclude that you're a dishonest phony and
[2:54:27.140 --> 2:54:32.740]  for good reasons you've got to keep it all hidden sorry you know what i'm saying but zucker assured
[2:54:32.740 --> 2:54:37.220]  michael cohan that none of this was personal quote it's not that i don't want to talk to trump
[2:54:37.220 --> 2:54:42.580]  every day i just got to be careful because because i've got to be careful i just don't want him talking
[2:54:42.580 --> 2:54:46.820]  about it on the campaign trail but you know what i'm going to give him a call right now and i'm
[2:54:46.820 --> 2:54:53.540]  going to wish him luck in the debate tonight and then zucker added this i have all these proposals
[2:54:53.540 --> 2:54:59.300]  for him like i want to do a weekly you know i want to do a weekly show with him and all this stuff
[2:54:59.300 --> 2:55:07.460]  when is he back in new york tomorrow do you know wait what a weekly show on cnn jeff zucker the president
[2:55:07.460 --> 2:55:14.420]  of cnn wanted to give a weekly show to a man he himself has denounced as a racist yep all right

[2:55:20.500 --> 2:55:24.900]  billionaires that are no bodies there's a spirit controlling them they're all followers though

[2:55:50.900 --> 2:55:56.260]  plunge the country in civil war and they're throwing hack attacks at info wars dirty tricks

[2:57:07.540 --> 2:57:18.740]  for their hats i want to fly like an eagle all right let's get serious
[2:57:22.260 --> 2:57:25.940]  the united nations is openly setting up world government and they're openly using
[2:57:25.940 --> 2:57:33.860]  immunization or u n run cities to implement incredibly draconian classical tyranny just
[2:57:34.500 --> 2:57:38.260]  absolutely horrifying behavior which is then picked up by the news and showed everybody else is
[2:57:38.260 --> 2:57:45.540]  normal arresting pregnant women in their houses for planning to protest lockdowns uh 77 deaths
[2:57:45.540 --> 2:57:49.860]  actually now in australia they say it's thousands they've been caught i mean this is crazy
[2:57:49.860 --> 2:57:55.540]  jen rep or it's about to take over but this article's on info wars dot com Quebec city says
[2:57:55.540 --> 2:58:02.820]  it will isolate uncooperative citizens in secret corona facility just the fact that it's secret is
[2:58:02.820 --> 2:58:11.860]  major alarm bells flame throwers red flags but then you add oh you didn't agree to be tested
[2:58:11.860 --> 2:58:15.700]  you didn't wait while you were tested or you didn't stay in your house when 90 percent of the test
[2:58:15.700 --> 2:58:21.940]  are fake this is a recipe for their smokescreen for roundups and arrest run by the clinton global
[2:58:21.940 --> 2:58:26.580]  initiative and bill gates who controls the global contact tracing and in texas the governor gave
[2:58:26.580 --> 2:58:32.900]  hundreds of millions of dollars to google and to build gates and clinton to run it so every state
[2:58:32.900 --> 2:58:37.940]  chipping in all this money the bill will end the gates and the clinton's to control our lives
[2:58:37.940 --> 2:58:43.140]  that's the real scandal my god they'll just come to your house and take your guns they come to your
[2:58:43.140 --> 2:58:51.060]  house and take you away because somebody saw you cough or sneeze here is the covex city head health
[2:58:51.060 --> 2:58:56.980]  officer then after that we'll play the clip we have the clip of the un head of global response
[2:58:58.180 --> 2:59:04.180]  four months ago saying we're going to come take your kids come take you out of your house i mean
[2:59:04.180 --> 2:59:10.500]  that was always the goal this is all you and run here it is dr jirar before the terminal
[2:59:10.500 --> 2:59:15.700]  he is a journalist who could not be present here who asks briefly is that the orders have been
[2:59:15.700 --> 2:59:26.900]  issued to the place of the clients recalcitrant yes thank you dr jirar yes the order nance
[2:59:26.900 --> 2:59:32.340]  uh can you understand please the other time the two people who are not cooperating here
[2:59:33.060 --> 2:59:35.460]  and this is great that we can finally work with them
[2:59:37.060 --> 2:59:38.660]  provision you know before
[2:59:40.820 --> 2:59:47.860]  if you are not in a health crisis the political news provisions then we cover our
[2:59:49.140 --> 2:59:53.300]  waiting for judges confirmation of such a provision in the covex 19 we have the
[2:59:53.300 --> 2:59:59.780]  covex 19 case we are as a sum of 14 days and this is the morning and we have done in the past
[3:00:01.060 --> 3:00:06.180]  as such is this morning 40 percent of cooperating with the investigation
[3:00:08.900 --> 3:00:15.060]  and we've done in the past with success with success with a collaboration with xie jignon
[3:00:15.060 --> 3:00:24.180]  oh thank you all have a great day when you order someone not to leave home for 14 days
[3:00:24.980 --> 3:00:31.140]  does it happen in your home is it not at home 14 days at home is it not in a prison
[3:00:33.060 --> 3:00:39.220]  do you feel like you are in a prison because that's it often it is what we do
[3:00:39.220 --> 3:00:47.620]  it's a location we at the c i uss don't have the power to provide preventable isolation
[3:00:48.980 --> 3:00:50.340]  it's happening finding it is
[3:00:52.100 --> 3:00:56.660]  finding and much easier for them to come on someone is not going to collaborate
[3:00:57.460 --> 3:01:06.260]  and because it's more difficult and yes under what he is he's even told us who exactly is we
[3:01:06.260 --> 3:01:14.340]  isolated we're all secret it's not a home it depends on the person because we have people
[3:01:14.340 --> 3:01:22.980]  isolated at home and then we show a person not at home and so it was their home and told them
[3:01:22.980 --> 3:01:36.500]  they don't get z yeah i say you only want you to be uh ggping love you good love you long time one
[3:01:36.500 --> 3:01:42.580]  point five million tuberculosis deaths we don't care but no one died coven we take control
[3:01:43.860 --> 3:01:50.820]  and every major city in europe australia you name it is chile australia is under u in
[3:01:50.820 --> 3:01:56.500]  shy com command i mean they close the parks people just tear up the signs ignore it and
[3:01:56.500 --> 3:01:59.780]  that's the answer let's play this footage before i go the next guest just taking over
[3:02:02.500 --> 3:02:11.620]  spain citizens stop police from arresting a woman for not wearing a mask this is the answer
[3:02:12.260 --> 3:02:18.260]  this is the key i personally this week went to swim at martin springs they have the main
[3:02:18.260 --> 3:02:23.860]  park clothes but the spillway they had the fences up again saying park clothes i ripped it down in
[3:02:23.860 --> 3:02:29.620]  seconds a little too lustfully i actually cut my finger doing then whatever i just tore it all down
[3:02:29.620 --> 3:02:37.460]  again three days ago seven a.m in the morning and i will continue to do it and next time i'm
[3:02:37.460 --> 3:02:40.340]  going to carry away the signs there's a little trophy here on there in fact i think i'll bring
[3:02:40.340 --> 3:02:44.580]  that to you tomorrow so because i didn't get my mile in this morning i think i'm gonna go get
[3:02:44.580 --> 3:02:50.980]  one right now so spain citizens stop police from arresting a woman for not wearing a mask
[3:02:50.980 --> 3:02:58.180]  this is the answer to eight months of lockdown of tyranny of bs run by the un of world government
[3:02:58.180 --> 3:03:17.780]  roll the footage
[3:03:28.260 --> 3:03:34.580]  but this is terrible when the government feels the people there is liberty
[3:03:34.580 --> 3:03:37.780]  people feel the government there is terrible
[3:03:43.220 --> 3:03:48.580]  this is all directed by the un they tell you

[3:06:51.860 --> 3:06:57.620]  every app and every company that are on apple and androids don't just track your location but
[3:06:57.620 --> 3:07:03.780]  your surfing history where you go who you talk to your relationships and they all share the
[3:07:03.780 --> 3:07:08.980]  data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well including having apps turn on
[3:07:08.980 --> 3:07:15.620]  and listen to what you're saying just like siri or alexa do and then putting databases transcripts
[3:07:15.620 --> 3:07:20.660]  of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever your phone is spying on you

[3:07:44.980 --> 3:07:50.180]  love to censor people love to cover up for corrupt authoritarian regimes and dictatorships
[3:07:50.180 --> 3:07:54.900]  well it's very simple the first computers ever created were created by thomas watson the founder
[3:07:54.900 --> 3:08:00.020]  and owner of ibm to carry out eugenics and they helped run the death camps in nazi germany that's
[3:08:00.020 --> 3:08:04.660]  what the tattoos were on the slaves arms they would decide who lived and who died so from the
[3:08:04.660 --> 3:08:10.660]  beginning it's been about creating monopolies cornering markets and making humans obsolete the
[3:08:10.660 --> 3:08:14.900]  same people brought us baby formula that doesn't have enough protein fat in it to make your child's
[3:08:14.900 --> 3:08:19.700]  brain small the same people who said put babies in cribs separate from their mothers the lower

[3:08:36.260 --> 3:08:46.420]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[3:09:04.500 --> 3:09:17.140]  show and now your host john rapaport well here we are again folks as you know i've been very hard on
[3:09:17.140 --> 3:09:27.700]  trump on a lot of issues having to do with coke mostly buying it in the first place
[3:09:27.700 --> 3:09:34.660]  from fauci that came from neil fergusson that came from the imperial college of london that came
[3:09:34.660 --> 3:09:47.140]  from bill gates that came from globalist lockdown of the planet in the form of a stupid predatory
[3:09:47.140 --> 3:09:56.420]  prediction of two million deaths in the u.s and 500 000 in the uk that was put together by fortran
[3:09:56.420 --> 3:10:09.220]  at best some hideous ancient system that was exposed completely you could take the same set
[3:10:09.220 --> 3:10:15.460]  of data stick it in the same computer and run it several times and you come up with different
[3:10:15.460 --> 3:10:23.060]  answers every time and on that basis trump recommended the state of emergency lockdown the country
[3:10:23.060 --> 3:10:37.220]  okay now now he's holding rallies with no masks very good mr president
[3:10:38.420 --> 3:10:48.420]  very good we need many more of these rallies without masks because this is the reality fauci
[3:10:48.420 --> 3:10:56.580]  is the worm crawling under the ground of the rally that you see as you're looking if you're
[3:10:56.580 --> 3:11:06.660]  watching this he's not we're not playing defense okay that's the problem oh well they're saying
[3:11:06.660 --> 3:11:14.260]  this and we have to defend oh no no no no no no no no you don't win that way he's the moron
[3:11:14.260 --> 3:11:27.060]  he's the predator he's the insane one who has to control everything fauci and gates and so on and so
[3:11:29.460 --> 3:11:37.060]  the good reality is some rallies a lot of rallies happen to be trump rallies very good
[3:11:37.060 --> 3:11:44.980]  good people showing up standing side by side no masks exactly what we want that's reality
[3:11:44.980 --> 3:11:55.700]  that's sense that makes sense that's true that's real that's a statement of fact that there is no
[3:11:55.700 --> 3:12:05.940]  pandemic it's finished it's a farce it always was a farce it was propped up on nothing it still is
[3:12:05.940 --> 3:12:15.220]  being propped up on a vicious nothing and we need a lot more people showing up everywhere
[3:12:15.220 --> 3:12:22.500]  without masks in berlin in london another big rally coming up in trafalgar square in london
[3:12:22.500 --> 3:12:33.300]  more rallies mr president more rallies no masks people standing cheek to jowl
[3:12:36.500 --> 3:12:48.580]  governor of south dakota christie noom fabulous sturges 500 000 people show up for that
[3:12:48.580 --> 3:12:58.420]  it's exactly more of that what we need absolutely and so media outlets come out and say well
[3:12:58.420 --> 3:13:07.860]  this could mean uh 250 000 cases of the corona virus as a result of the bikers going into
[3:13:07.860 --> 3:13:22.180]  sturges 500 000 of them big comma economists say economists say this is like saying you know
[3:13:25.380 --> 3:13:33.380]  we just have to we have to put this whole thing down quickly because if it gets out that nobody's
[3:13:33.380 --> 3:13:39.700]  getting sick and the whole thing is an insane farce and here's all these bikers who don't care
[3:13:41.220 --> 3:13:47.780]  and 500 000 of them are showing up in south dakota where christie noom is the governor
[3:13:47.780 --> 3:13:57.540]  and hasn't locked down anything and everything is okay and there's no 250 000 corona virus cases
[3:13:57.540 --> 3:14:07.140]  then the game is over it's all being exposed it has to be more exposed and exposed and exposed
[3:14:07.860 --> 3:14:18.180]  and then trump follows up the rallies with the first sensible tweet or thing that i've heard
[3:14:18.180 --> 3:14:28.180]  and say finally about his own city new york and the state of new york that the governor
[3:14:28.180 --> 3:14:37.380]  komo and the mayor of new york debasio have to stop the shutdown of new york city there
[3:14:37.380 --> 3:14:45.540]  and the state they're destroying new york absolutely right that is correct that is factual
[3:14:45.540 --> 3:14:54.100]  that is what is happening and has been happening for since whatever it is
[3:14:56.100 --> 3:15:06.180]  february march april may june july august on and on and on and on leveling the city of new york
[3:15:06.180 --> 3:15:14.980]  the new york times is not going to cover that the new york post will cover a little bit of it
[3:15:15.940 --> 3:15:22.100]  the television news in new york a bunch of treasonous traders in their own city are not
[3:15:22.100 --> 3:15:30.020]  going to go out with cameras and explore every desolate wrecked screwed up street in the city
[3:15:30.020 --> 3:15:37.380]  that's a bombed out lying in ruins with shops and small businesses one after another shut down
[3:15:37.380 --> 3:15:44.180]  and the owners of bankrupt committing suicide addicted to drugs etc etc which is the whole
[3:15:44.180 --> 3:15:50.340]  purpose of this fake epidemic no they're not going to cover that they're just going to sit there
[3:15:50.340 --> 3:15:59.220]  and take potshots at trump and take potshots at anybody else who criticizes vouchy and gates
[3:15:59.220 --> 3:16:08.580]  and the globalists and so on and so forth treasonous traders so finally trump tweeted about that
[3:16:08.580 --> 3:16:15.780]  follow it up mr president don't stop keep on hammering they're destroying new york
[3:16:16.660 --> 3:16:24.660]  once the greatest city in the world look at all you have to do is look at it this is not
[3:16:24.660 --> 3:16:34.660]  not brain surgery just take cameras out into the streets of the city it's leveled and destroyed
[3:16:40.260 --> 3:16:47.060]  Berlin two gigantic rallies robert f kennedy speaks at one of them
[3:16:47.060 --> 3:16:55.460]  half a million a million whatever it is are there and so right away nbc has to say actually
[3:16:56.020 --> 3:17:05.940]  it was 20 000 neo-nazis when they say that you know that we're winning when they say that you
[3:17:05.940 --> 3:17:17.300]  know that we're winning and they are excreting waste matter in terror because the day is coming
[3:17:18.340 --> 3:17:26.900]  the day is coming for retribution massive retribution when enough of the people are out
[3:17:26.900 --> 3:17:38.900]  they are saying it's over it never was you screwed us to the hilt big tech is the global
[3:17:38.900 --> 3:17:44.580]  straightjacket of the new world order it is the enforcement system the surveillance system
[3:17:44.580 --> 3:17:48.900]  it's going to track everything you do everywhere you go everything you say everything you basically
[3:17:48.900 --> 3:17:54.820]  think and then reward or punish you for those behaviors and they're not liberals that's a
[3:17:54.820 --> 3:18:00.740]  complete and total cover they are monsters that love authoritarianism and are building towards
[3:18:00.740 --> 3:18:06.420]  a post-human world their mission is to destroy indigenous communities annihilate small towns
[3:18:06.420 --> 3:18:13.140]  annihilate all human culture and consolidate us all isolate us all and then carry out our orderly
[3:18:13.140 --> 3:18:20.820]  extermination this is their public master plan and covet 19 is the cover for the rollout of this
[3:18:20.820 --> 3:18:25.620]  digital control system ladies and gentlemen it's only going to get worse from here when you see
[3:18:25.620 --> 3:18:30.980]  officials from apple google facebook twitter you are looking at people way more smart and way more
[3:18:30.980 --> 3:18:38.020]  evil than hitler they want to murder you and your family you have been warned i know i say it all the
[3:18:38.020 --> 3:18:41.380]  time but i mean it from the bottom of my heart i want to thank you the listeners of viewers this
[3:18:41.380 --> 3:18:48.020]  broadcast and all the stations and all the affiliates and sponsors and my family and the crew and just
[3:18:48.020 --> 3:18:54.580]  everybody out there the listeners and viewers as i said this is such an epic struggle and we've all
[3:18:54.580 --> 3:18:58.900]  been proven dead on we've been proven we're right because we're being led by god we have a spirit
[3:18:58.900 --> 3:19:02.260]  and we're very humble about that this this is not us this is god working through us but
[3:19:02.820 --> 3:19:07.780]  man now it's so precious to stay on air i used to think you know maybe i'll wake a bunch of people
[3:19:07.780 --> 3:19:13.300]  up and i can kind of proceed into the background because fighting this thing 18 hours a day gets
[3:19:13.300 --> 3:19:17.860]  a little bit old but now with the evil so out in the open and everything we've said being vindicated
[3:19:17.860 --> 3:19:22.100]  i never questioned what i was saying because i knew it was true but i i did question where they'd
[3:19:22.100 --> 3:19:25.620]  ever actually try to carry it all out well now we know they're going to carry it out and then
[3:19:25.620 --> 3:19:30.500]  some so we got a fight and i just really appreciate you and we're in this together and praise god
[3:19:30.500 --> 3:19:37.300]  passing ammunition the info war again take action folks this is it i don't want to say i'm a

[3:20:21.620 --> 3:20:25.780]  want to stay in this fight and it's so serious now things are getting so clear now that's why
[3:20:25.780 --> 3:20:30.420]  they want to solve here because all of our credibility so high we're just stay together
[3:20:30.420 --> 3:20:36.900]  fight hard spread the word pray to god take us through this we're gonna make it
[3:20:39.300 --> 3:20:42.900]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:42.900 --> 3:21:02.980]  a new study from medical scientists at ucla and stanford university finds the likelihood
[3:21:02.980 --> 3:21:09.620]  of contracting the coronavirus is much much lower than previously thought the study published in late
[3:21:09.620 --> 3:21:15.140]  june says the current probability of becoming infected going to the hospital or even death
[3:21:15.140 --> 3:21:21.540]  from covet nineteen is quote an extremely rare event the study goes on to say that people are
[3:21:21.540 --> 3:21:27.220]  vastly overestimating their chances of getting sick and going to the hospital especially here in the
[3:21:27.220 --> 3:21:33.300]  us as part of the study doctors reviewed public cases of infection in 100 of the largest counties
[3:21:33.300 --> 3:21:41.860]  across the nation they found that an average person in an average county has a one in 3836
[3:21:41.860 --> 3:21:48.500]  chance of getting infected with the coronavirus and that's without wearing a mask or doing any
[3:21:48.500 --> 3:21:54.820]  social distancing even the odds of being hospitalized are vanishingly small even for
[3:21:54.820 --> 3:22:01.380]  someone who's in the at-risk category for an average person between 50 and 64 years old the
[3:22:01.380 --> 3:22:10.420]  chances of getting the virus and needing hospitalization are one in 852 thousand and for that same
[3:22:10.420 --> 3:22:19.700]  person who's at risk the chances of dying from coronavirus are one in 19.1 million and those
[3:22:19.700 --> 3:22:26.260]  figures were for the last week of may when deaths from coronavirus were 16 times higher than they
[3:22:26.260 --> 3:22:33.060]  were last week doctors say they were shocked to find out how low the risk of coronavirus really
[3:22:33.060 --> 3:22:38.100]  was it's worth mentioning that compared to the risk of dying from coronavirus which again is
[3:22:38.100 --> 3:22:46.660]  one in 19 million the risk from dying in a car crash is one in 114 these figures come after
[3:22:46.660 --> 3:22:52.900]  a revelation from the cdc itself that of all deaths attributed to the coronavirus just six
[3:22:52.900 --> 3:22:59.620]  percent actually died from the virus itself the other 94 percent had severe underlying medical
[3:22:59.620 --> 3:23:06.100]  conditions combined with this latest data the case for keeping the country locked down falls apart
[3:23:06.100 --> 3:23:12.020]  and reveals the risk to the american public appears much lower than so-called experts like
[3:23:12.020 --> 3:23:29.060]  dr anthony fauci had claimed yeah so fauci is not an expert let's correct the record fauci the fake
[3:23:29.060 --> 3:23:35.700]  expert the so-called expert who should never have been allowed near the white house but probably
[3:23:35.700 --> 3:23:46.100]  should have been you know in the outhouse he's not an expert he's a liar he's been lying for 50
[3:23:46.100 --> 3:23:53.060]  years that's how long he's worked for the government so you just saw the results of that study yeah
[3:23:53.060 --> 3:24:01.860]  there he is okay okay so here are two more pieces of ammunition one was referred to
[3:24:01.860 --> 3:24:14.180]  in the video you just watched cdc even the cdc admits only six percent six percent of all
[3:24:14.180 --> 3:24:23.700]  covid so-called covid deaths in the u.s. occurred quote from the virus alone 94
[3:24:23.700 --> 3:24:31.620]  percent occurred in basically the elderly who had already serious illnesses multiple illness
[3:24:31.620 --> 3:24:38.660]  conditions etc etc etc i've done this song and dance a hundred times now to describe
[3:24:38.660 --> 3:24:46.420]  how that all works the bottom line is no need for a virus to kill those old people
[3:24:46.420 --> 3:24:53.780]  all you have to do to force their premature deaths which has been being done all over the world
[3:24:55.060 --> 3:25:01.700]  is to terrify them with a covid-19 diagnosis and then isolate them from friends and family
[3:25:01.700 --> 3:25:07.060]  and cut them off from the world and then if necessary put them on a ventilator with sedation
[3:25:07.060 --> 3:25:24.500]  they die no virus necessary that's co-covid is that being done to old people period that's it
[3:25:26.260 --> 3:25:32.020]  the other is an article in the new york times you can look it up yourself on a 29 called
[3:25:32.020 --> 3:25:42.980]  your coronavirus test let me get this now is positive maybe it shouldn't be that's the title of the
[3:25:43.700 --> 3:25:48.740]  delectable new york times piece big study they report on
[3:25:48.740 --> 3:26:02.260]  one up to 90 percent of all u.s. coronavirus cases in the u.s. false positive false positive
[3:26:03.460 --> 3:26:10.580]  and they explain this by saying that a test is set to a certain sensitivity
[3:26:10.580 --> 3:26:18.900]  that is so expansive that it could catch basically you know the tiniest tiny of the tiny tiniest
[3:26:18.900 --> 3:26:32.180]  of the tiny amount of virus that wouldn't harm a flea or be contagious that's the conclusion
[3:26:32.820 --> 3:26:38.500]  of course the article then turns around and says the solution to this is more testing and better
[3:26:38.500 --> 3:26:48.340]  testing they've got to say that that you catch that up to 90 percent of all the coronavirus cases
[3:26:48.340 --> 3:26:56.500]  i mean the fraud is just right out there are false positives so lop off 90 percent from the
[3:26:56.500 --> 3:27:06.020]  figures of coronavirus cases in the u.s. right and lop off 94 percent of all the covet death
[3:27:06.020 --> 3:27:15.940]  numbers in the u.s. and then grab Fauci by the neck and shove him up against the wall and hold
[3:27:15.940 --> 3:27:26.100]  him there until he confesses and explains the truth because these are the pieces of information
[3:27:26.100 --> 3:27:34.340]  that turn the whole thing around there are many more and i've gone into them over the many months
[3:27:34.340 --> 3:27:42.420]  i've been writing about this and talking about it but with those two what the cdc has admitted and
[3:27:42.420 --> 3:27:50.820]  the new york times article it's over it's done it's finished finished finished finished no lockdown
[3:27:50.820 --> 3:28:00.020]  no masks no distancing gone done more sturges folks more sturges more trump rallies with no mask
[3:28:00.020 --> 3:28:06.420]  people standing next to each other bigger and bigger and bigger rallies more and more people
[3:28:06.420 --> 3:28:13.860]  out in the open going back to work doing the economy any way you can possibly do it
[3:28:13.860 --> 3:28:22.180]  sideways inside out upside down trading bartering whatever until there are so many people out there
[3:28:22.180 --> 3:28:31.620]  so many people visible to everybody else wearing no masks standing next to each other
[3:28:32.740 --> 3:28:39.860]  that the entire hoax is exposed and then the people looking at all those other people are
[3:28:39.860 --> 3:28:46.580]  saying well we're not seeing the millions of coronavirus cases they're claiming are going
[3:28:46.580 --> 3:28:52.580]  to result from this we're not seeing people dropping like flies we're not seeing people
[3:28:52.580 --> 3:29:03.700]  going to hospital we're not seeing any of this at all so the whole thing is crap it's all been
[3:29:03.700 --> 3:29:11.460]  lowered down in our heads to destroy the economy obviously globalists technocrats are behind this
[3:29:11.460 --> 3:29:18.260]  because they want to take us into a different kind of world entirely which i've discussed many times
[3:29:18.260 --> 3:29:28.740]  on this show not going to focus on today just the bear in your face factor here trump listen
[3:29:29.540 --> 3:29:37.140]  scott atlas the new coronavirus advisor to the white house who has some central facts
[3:29:37.140 --> 3:29:45.700]  straight in his head indeed he does listen the more people who show up in public the bigger
[3:29:45.700 --> 3:29:54.820]  the crowds for whatever reason alabama orburn football game is coming up in november what's
[3:29:54.820 --> 3:30:03.700]  going to happen then giant numbers of people in alabama are either orburn fans or alabama fans
[3:30:03.700 --> 3:30:08.260]  if they won't let them into the stadium they'll be in the parking lot if they can't go to the
[3:30:08.260 --> 3:30:12.580]  parking lot they'll be across the street if they can't be across the street they'll be
[3:30:13.620 --> 3:30:19.460]  somewhere in town wherever the game is there's going to be masses and masses of people
[3:30:20.660 --> 3:30:28.500]  that's what we need nobody gets sick the whole thing's exposed it's over overwhelming
[3:30:28.500 --> 3:30:38.020]  the liars the scumbags of the world stay with us it couldn't have been scripted any better
[3:30:38.660 --> 3:30:44.820]  that's because it was completely scripted and we even know the names of the united nations
[3:30:44.820 --> 3:30:50.740]  rockefeller foundation bill mullin the gates and john hotkins documents we have the script
[3:30:50.740 --> 3:30:56.260]  just like you'd have for hollywood movie and it's designed to free civilization and have a
[3:30:56.260 --> 3:31:04.180]  post renaissance stagnation or new dark age and a total consolidation of all wealth and power
[3:31:04.740 --> 3:31:10.900]  in the hands of the kleptocratic post humanist the magnitude of this is unfathomable as you
[3:31:10.900 --> 3:31:17.140]  can see all the checkboxes of tyranny are being marked carefully every eye dotted every t crossed
[3:31:17.140 --> 3:31:22.500]  a total societal vertical integration takeover medical tyranny total surveillance the big tech
[3:31:22.500 --> 3:31:26.500]  heads on average have had their wealth cook up 35 percent in the last eight months of course
[3:31:26.500 --> 3:31:31.620]  jeff bezos has basically doubled his everyone is being forced onto their system the post human
[3:31:31.620 --> 3:31:39.060]  robot takeover you're being made obsolete the clock is ticking on the once free world and the
[3:31:39.060 --> 3:31:45.380]  free press is under attack more than ever i now see videos 10 or 15 times a day without even trying
[3:31:45.380 --> 3:31:51.060]  to find them of press being arrested the united states press being arrested canada the uk europe
[3:31:51.060 --> 3:31:56.660]  australia new zealand and it's always the so-called liberal left the defenders of speech doing it
[3:31:57.300 --> 3:32:03.540]  they are the authoritarians they work for the chai kong globalist combine and they are working
[3:32:03.540 --> 3:32:09.540]  around the clock to silence info wars just as we were the group they started with three years ago
[3:32:10.260 --> 3:32:14.820]  they test out everything new on us and a lot of what i can't get into on air at this point
[3:32:14.820 --> 3:32:19.700]  i'll be able to reveal this later but i just want to make you all realize that your support your word

[3:33:48.020 --> 3:33:54.740]  into the transhumanist plan it is the most megalomaniacal psychotic thing you could ever imagine
[3:33:54.740 --> 3:34:00.500]  not even in again a science fiction horror movie could you come close to what this is actually
[3:34:00.500 --> 3:34:05.620]  gonna look like so remember compliance with the mass compliance with social distancing compliance
[3:34:05.620 --> 3:34:09.780]  at the airports all of this is training you for the post human world we're all being taught that
[3:34:09.780 --> 3:34:15.540]  we're not essential we must get people like the governor of texas to wake up and say no in reverse
[3:34:15.540 --> 3:34:21.700]  himself we've got to get trump to go more on the offense exposing covet 19 as an overblown hoax
[3:34:21.700 --> 3:34:28.340]  yes it's a virus yes it kills people maybe one percent as bad as the flu not 10 percent as bad
[3:34:28.900 --> 3:34:33.700]  it's totally overblown ladies and gentlemen because it is the shoehorn to bring in the end of liberty
[3:34:33.700 --> 3:34:46.820]  and freedom as we know it you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:46.820 --> 3:35:05.140]  news analysis reports it's the alex jones show and now your host john
[3:35:05.140 --> 3:35:19.060]  bravo last segment here remember the dootron bomb it was the bomb that didn't destroy any structures
[3:35:19.060 --> 3:35:26.500]  it was just radioactivity it killed all the people and left all the infrastructure there
[3:35:26.500 --> 3:35:37.380]  that's what this is destroy the people leave everything else up by telling them that a virus
[3:35:37.380 --> 3:35:42.740]  could kill them and they all have to stay indoors and then when they come out they have to shuffle
[3:35:42.740 --> 3:35:49.060]  along like prisoners oh you know with the mask and so forth and the distancing and whatever
[3:35:49.060 --> 3:35:54.420]  and they have to be nice and polite and they get tested and then they then get shot up with a toxic
[3:35:54.420 --> 3:36:07.700]  vaccine and the structures stand that's what they're doing and the way they keep this whole
[3:36:08.740 --> 3:36:14.420]  thing alive is the testing testing testing testing testing because the test is fake it's
[3:36:14.420 --> 3:36:20.820]  worthless it's useless but it does spit out false positives which means that they can rack up case
[3:36:20.820 --> 3:36:27.620]  numbers and confine people to their homes and announce oh we have 12 000 more cases and everybody
[3:36:27.620 --> 3:36:32.740]  could die so we have to lock down again and that's what they're doing that's what they're
[3:36:32.740 --> 3:36:39.540]  preparing for and then this winter when the flu hits Fauci will say well it's COVID-19 again and
[3:36:39.540 --> 3:36:46.340]  we have to lock down testing testing testing testing testing testing no no and no and no
[3:36:46.340 --> 3:36:59.380]  fake fake fake show up in public again this is the medicine this is the remedy this is the cure
[3:37:00.020 --> 3:37:10.580]  this is the healing not the scumbags this is the way to hold a mirror up for the rest of the world
[3:37:10.580 --> 3:37:17.940]  well last month a million people showed up in Berlin and this month it was seven million
[3:37:18.500 --> 3:37:25.300]  and it took up half the city and most of the police were on the side of the people there
[3:37:25.300 --> 3:37:32.420]  and they were all peaceful and here we go what do you think of this and somebody in Italy finally
[3:37:32.420 --> 3:37:41.380]  wakes up out of a stupor and says what are we doing being locked down for eight months and half a
[3:37:41.380 --> 3:37:48.100]  million people show up there and they come pouring out of their houses and cities in America and they
[3:37:48.100 --> 3:37:56.420]  go back to work and they're sitting in restaurants and the bars open and here we go here we go here
[3:37:56.420 --> 3:38:05.540]  we go and the people look at each other and they say what did we fall for what did we fall for
[3:38:07.860 --> 3:38:18.820]  and everybody looks at everybody and everybody says it's over and Fauci is like something that
[3:38:18.820 --> 3:38:26.500]  you just want to rub off your shoe that's all and Gates is something you rub off your other shoe
[3:38:26.500 --> 3:38:35.540]  that's all their power is yeah they can bring out the cops yeah they can smash the windows
[3:38:35.540 --> 3:38:42.500]  yeah they can arrest people yeah they can do all this we understand that but only up to a certain
[3:38:42.500 --> 3:38:50.660]  point because when the numbers get big enough of the people who are showing up out on the streets
[3:38:51.380 --> 3:39:02.580]  and going back to work it's over that is the cure that is the reversal of the
[3:39:02.580 --> 3:39:15.540]  sigh of the brainwash of the slavery that is the gateway to freedom we're here we're not sick
[3:39:16.260 --> 3:39:28.020]  we're not going to get sick we're not sick and we're not going to get sick well you can't possibly
[3:39:28.020 --> 3:39:35.700]  know that yeah we can we can't and if we do get sick it has nothing to do with what you're talking
[3:39:35.700 --> 3:39:43.380]  about because a couple shots of whiskey and some honey will take care of it so forget about it
[3:39:45.540 --> 3:39:54.180]  we're not sick and we're not going to get sick and those of you who are huddled masses give us
[3:39:54.180 --> 3:40:04.420]  your huddled masses yearning to be vaccinated even those people will begin to wake up slowly
[3:40:05.380 --> 3:40:14.260]  and realize that they are dupes being used to forward this massive agenda of destruction
[3:40:14.260 --> 3:40:21.300]  by neutron bomb they will even realize that they're being used and they will wake up
[3:40:21.300 --> 3:40:30.980]  up and realize that they're dupes and because they'll look around and say well you know I mean
[3:40:30.980 --> 3:40:36.660]  I can see millions here and millions there and millions everywhere and so on and so forth and
[3:40:36.660 --> 3:40:45.540]  nobody seems to be falling down in the street nobody's sick so what is this really all about
[3:40:45.540 --> 3:40:56.900]  let me take off my mask and have a breath of air and go into the park and even yes I know how much
[3:40:56.900 --> 3:41:04.820]  it would take in Melbourne and Victoria where the violence of the police from reports that I'm
[3:41:04.820 --> 3:41:12.900]  getting is now severe I mean they've completely lost their frigging minds over there trying to
[3:41:12.900 --> 3:41:22.020]  enforce must wear a mask or we're going to you know take you to another planet and stick you in a
[3:41:22.020 --> 3:41:30.660]  you know a cave hundreds thousands hundreds of thousands of people in victoria show up on the
[3:41:30.660 --> 3:41:37.540]  street what are these fascists going to do I don't think that's going to work for them
[3:41:37.540 --> 3:41:50.020]  people looking at each other who are free people who are free looking at other people who are free
[3:41:51.220 --> 3:42:01.300]  the protests getting bigger people going back to work the economy expanding by any means necessary
[3:42:01.300 --> 3:42:14.580]  Trump holding bigger and bigger rallies by propping him up saying over and over again
[3:42:14.580 --> 3:42:24.340]  that he wants masks for everybody as a federal regulation and in his campaign ads if you're
[3:42:24.340 --> 3:42:36.020]  listening he says if and when the parents of these children go back to work what if and when
[3:42:36.980 --> 3:42:48.820]  a national plan coordinated to fight the pandemic override all the states that's what he's talking
[3:42:48.820 --> 3:42:57.140]  about override governor christy in south dakota override south carolina utah wherever there's
[3:42:57.140 --> 3:43:10.740]  some freedom lock the whole sucker back down again wow does not want free people looking at free people
[3:43:10.740 --> 3:43:21.300]  does not want that that is the wooden stake in the heart the silver bullet
[3:43:22.740 --> 3:43:30.820]  the thing that just simply dispels the fog of insanity and delusion and treason and crime
[3:43:30.820 --> 3:43:38.900]  and murder because that's what we're seeing mass murder all over the planet yeah we're
[3:43:38.900 --> 3:43:47.140]  locking down the planet you know somebody said that five years ago even a crack brained reporter
[3:43:47.140 --> 3:43:53.620]  from c&m would say whoa whoa whoa lock down the pump what does that even mean well it means basically
[3:43:53.620 --> 3:43:59.060]  everybody stays indoors nobody goes to work uh you know you either work from home or you don't work
[3:43:59.060 --> 3:44:03.540]  but businesses all shut down everything the streets are empty everybody's wearing a mask
[3:44:03.540 --> 3:44:11.300]  you got to walk six feet apart or else you get arrested what what what what what yeah
[3:44:14.580 --> 3:44:16.100]  that's the hypnotic trance
[3:44:20.100 --> 3:44:25.060]  and we're seeing the cure spread so mr trump
[3:44:25.060 --> 3:44:32.100]  bigger rallies more rallies more people standing cheek to jowl
[3:44:34.420 --> 3:44:44.580]  no masks hey the rolling stones up in canada right after the first sars outbreak of 2003 which
