[00:00.000 --> 00:09.480]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.480 --> 00:19.400]  radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones the Titanic we all
[00:19.400 --> 00:25.000]  know is the global economy appears to be moving along at full speed but signs of
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.560]  sea ice are dead ahead the first alarm bells have been sounded from several
[00:29.560 --> 00:33.240]  economists that know to look for the most subtle signs of danger of a global
[00:33.240 --> 00:38.640]  economic collapse we have a bubble around the world in demographic spending
[00:38.640 --> 00:42.120]  which keeps declining in more countries and I'm trying we can predict this by
[00:42.120 --> 00:47.320]  country Japan was the first to peak and then the US and now Europe but we also
[00:47.320 --> 00:52.360]  have the greatest debt bubble in modern history two to four times what we've
[00:52.360 --> 00:57.520]  seen back in the roaring 20s last time we had that bubble and all we need like
[00:57.520 --> 01:04.640]  in 2008 with the subprime crisis is a trigger to cause this debt bubble to
[01:04.640 --> 01:10.640]  reset and de leverage or what I call a financial detox and when you go south of
[01:10.640 --> 01:17.200]  the border even below Mexico way it's currency crisis after currency crisis
[01:17.200 --> 01:23.200]  commodity crash after commodity crash current events form future trends what
[01:23.200 --> 01:27.220]  happened yesterday over in Brazil but they had a wonderful time about a half
[01:27.220 --> 01:31.880]  a million people turned out to protest against the government how come well
[01:31.880 --> 01:36.360]  they're in a recession inflation is skyrocketing and the currency is
[01:36.360 --> 01:41.880]  plummeting is the economy moving the Baltic dry index has hit a new low the
[01:41.880 --> 01:46.240]  Baltic dry index is the assessment of the price of moving all of the globe's
[01:46.240 --> 01:52.720]  major raw materials by sea including commodities like coal grain and iron ore
[01:52.720 --> 01:58.560]  Tyler Durden of zero hedge reports last week I received news from a contact who
[01:58.560 --> 02:01.600]  is friends with one of the biggest billionaire shipping families in the
[02:01.600 --> 02:06.320]  world he told me they had no ships at sea right now because operating them
[02:06.320 --> 02:11.040]  meant running at a loss commerce between Europe and North America has
[02:11.040 --> 02:17.020]  literally come to a halt for the first time in known history not one cargo
[02:17.020 --> 02:22.400]  ship is in transit in the North Atlantic between Europe and North America all of
[02:22.400 --> 02:28.480]  them hundreds are either anchored offshore or in port nothing is moving it
[02:28.480 --> 02:33.680]  is a horrific economic sign proof that commerce has literally stopped the
[02:33.680 --> 02:38.400]  very Chinese shipyards supplying the needed vessels to transport the world's
[02:38.400 --> 02:43.320]  raw materials are going bankrupt due to the struggling economies across the
[02:43.320 --> 02:48.000]  globe according to global times experts have said that half of China's ship
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  building enterprises will go bankrupt in the coming years other signs of a
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.440]  sinking ship Graham Summers of zero hedge reports that the bursting of the
[02:57.440 --> 03:03.080]  bond bubble has begun the bond bubble was close to 80 trillion in size going
[03:03.080 --> 03:08.880]  into 2008 globally the bond bubble has grown by more than 20 trillion since
[03:08.880 --> 03:15.760]  2008 today it is north of a hundred trillion with an additional 555 plus
[03:15.760 --> 03:22.880]  trillion in derivatives globally over 50% of all corporate bonds are now junk
[03:22.880 --> 03:30.280]  in the UK you have the ability to sell the same bond an incident number of
[03:30.280 --> 03:35.240]  times in the United States you're limited you can't sell the same bond an
[03:35.240 --> 03:39.960]  incident number of times you can sell it a few times and claim that it has a
[03:39.960 --> 03:45.240]  collateral value but in the UK and this is why all of the major banks and all
[03:45.240 --> 03:51.040]  the major countries treasuries outsource their fraud to the UK this is why the
[03:51.040 --> 03:56.040]  UK is responsible for the Lehman collapse the AIG collapse the Bernie
[03:56.040 --> 04:00.760]  Madoff collapse the London well from JP Morgan collapse because everyone
[04:00.760 --> 04:04.520]  outsources their fraud to the UK because the UK is where you can commit the
[04:04.520 --> 04:10.080]  grievous fraudulent financial behavior the Dow Jones has lost 1500 points in
[04:10.080 --> 04:15.080]  10 days and still has a lot further to fall the fragility of the markets are
[04:15.080 --> 04:21.160]  worse than pre 2008 one minor trigger could send the globe into it the very
[04:21.160 --> 04:26.960]  least yet another major recession regardless Obama will hear none of that
[04:26.960 --> 04:34.240]  anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction John

[08:09.360 --> 08:25.640]  John ladies and gentlemen it is Friday the 15th day of January 2016 this is a
[08:25.640 --> 08:29.600]  big broadcast lined up today David night's gonna be in with a roundtable
[08:29.600 --> 08:34.440]  discussion with Leanne McAdoo Jacarie Jackson Darren McBreen popping in from
[08:34.440 --> 08:38.600]  the other studio with some of the Twitter comments and info wars dot comments
[08:38.600 --> 08:43.320]  and Facebook comments from last night taking your phone calls we have several
[08:43.320 --> 08:48.280]  guests joining us today as well dealing with the debates dealing with the
[08:48.280 --> 08:53.200]  imminent fall we hope of Hillary Clinton as all of her lies and corruption
[08:53.200 --> 09:01.280]  begin to come out dealing with so much but before we get into cruise walking
[09:01.280 --> 09:08.280]  into that powerful left uppercut of Trump on insulting New Yorkers before we
[09:08.280 --> 09:12.200]  get into the whole natural born citizen issue that both of them frankly have
[09:12.200 --> 09:20.280]  under a very strict interpretation of the Constitution that's Trump and cruise
[09:20.280 --> 09:24.360]  and I've always thought that way his mom's born in Scotland too so it really
[09:24.360 --> 09:27.440]  gets interesting from that point out David night's can be breaking that down
[09:27.440 --> 09:31.440]  as well but I want to start with a special report that we aired in that
[09:31.440 --> 09:35.600]  first little segment that some stations don't carry by John Bowne global
[09:35.600 --> 09:40.200]  economy dead in the water it's five minutes long it's on info wars.com I'm
[09:40.200 --> 09:44.600]  going to tweet it out right now at real Alex Jones in case you didn't hear it or
[09:44.600 --> 09:49.600]  see it I mean this global economy is melting down the Dow Jones industrial
[09:49.600 --> 09:56.520]  average is down 400 plus points today that's almost 2000 points the last two
[09:56.520 --> 10:04.960]  weeks since the new year began 15 days ago so this is engineered we told you it
[10:04.960 --> 10:08.640]  was coming we told you the derivatives were bigger than ever been we told you
[10:08.640 --> 10:12.360]  the big banks were already positioning themselves buying up gold at record
[10:12.360 --> 10:16.640]  levels while saying you shouldn't buy gold and I'm not saying you know gold's
[10:16.640 --> 10:20.040]  the best thing in the galaxy anyways what I'm saying is they are hoarding it
[10:20.040 --> 10:23.600]  while telling you not to have it which is a hedge against collapse so you have
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.600]  something the world has never been this leveraged different numbers are out
[10:28.600 --> 10:33.920]  there but we're reportedly leveraged many times more than why my republic or
[10:33.920 --> 10:38.120]  even Zimbabwe when it comes to derivatives so I'm not here glooming and
[10:38.120 --> 10:41.880]  dooming but I'm watching CNN I'm watching Fox News this morning while I'm on the
[10:41.880 --> 10:45.080]  elliptical while I'm exercising just kind of watching the closed captioning at
[10:45.080 --> 10:52.320]  the gym and it was pretty much all about the debate or all about cultural stuff
[10:52.320 --> 10:56.160]  and and really not much about what's happening with the economy that they
[10:56.160 --> 11:01.320]  would just mention it in the background well the Dow Jones is down 400 plus
[11:01.320 --> 11:06.120]  points and John Bounds report on info wars.com goes over that Dow falls 400
[11:06.120 --> 11:14.440]  points as oil ways fidelity stealth bear could see big turnaround so they're
[11:14.440 --> 11:19.960]  acting like this wasn't seen coming here's another headline from CNBC this
[11:19.960 --> 11:24.800]  is not 2008 it's actually worse what have all of our experts and what have I
[11:24.800 --> 11:30.240]  been saying the last two years this will be worse than 2008 because it's by
[11:30.240 --> 11:35.280]  design just like 2008 to get more banker bailouts more funding more global
[11:35.280 --> 11:39.160]  government more bank regulations against banks the globalists don't control
[11:39.160 --> 11:43.840]  against mutual funds they don't control against businesses they don't control in
[11:43.840 --> 11:48.960]  the financial market the financial market has been consolidated since 2008 over
[11:48.960 --> 11:54.000]  80% I mean that's in the news they have taken it over the big corrupt robber
[11:54.000 --> 12:00.640]  barons that ran this whole show are the ones using regulatory systems to come
[12:00.640 --> 12:06.400]  in and take over everything they're trying to take down local banks they're
[12:06.400 --> 12:10.080]  trying to take down credit unions they are I mean I talked to credit union
[12:10.080 --> 12:14.120]  heads I talked to bankers I've read the Texas Banking Association head back in
[12:14.120 --> 12:19.200]  2009 you know it it read like Alex Jones wrote it it's a foreign takeover banks
[12:19.200 --> 12:23.240]  they did this they're now shutting us down not letting us lend this will kill
[12:23.240 --> 12:27.080]  lending to real businesses and now the big banks you notice don't lend to small
[12:27.080 --> 12:31.080]  businesses like they did even when you have good credit because they got all
[12:31.080 --> 12:35.800]  the free money they want they went beyond fractional reserve banking so
[12:35.800 --> 12:40.920]  that's the big issue now David Knight and others are gonna be coming in breaking
[12:40.920 --> 12:44.680]  down all the different angles of this then I'll be back live this Sunday 4 to
[12:44.680 --> 12:49.120]  6 p.m. we'll be doing a live report tonight as well I've got major stories
[12:49.120 --> 12:53.520]  I'm working on and I'll be popping in but the time we have till we go to break
[12:53.520 --> 12:57.440]  here I want to start then getting into some of these clips and the most
[12:57.440 --> 13:03.480]  important one is Trump saying I am angry I am angry well of course he has a
[13:03.480 --> 13:07.360]  right to be angry and the media and Obama act like it's weird to be angry
[13:07.360 --> 13:12.640]  they've got all their surrogates out spewing racism division civil war class
[13:12.640 --> 13:19.240]  in week gender war but then he gets up there and says can't we all just get
[13:19.240 --> 13:24.240]  along can't we all just be buddies Allah Rodney King this is how he appears to
[13:24.240 --> 13:28.960]  rise above it but people see through his surrogates and others and of course we
[13:28.960 --> 13:32.920]  should be angry that's why Trump's successful he's angry he's off the cuff
[13:32.920 --> 13:37.080]  people are sick of scripting that's all I ever told Rand Paul to do to stay at
[13:37.080 --> 13:43.720]  the lead was to be you know real populist that's why I'm successful because
[13:43.720 --> 13:48.480]  I'm real I'm populist well even if you're not that but you're a patriot people
[13:48.480 --> 13:52.720]  need to see you get more down in the trenches and that's lessons for
[13:52.720 --> 13:56.160]  everybody so let's go ahead and go to this clip Trump I'm angry because our
[13:56.160 --> 14:01.880]  country is run horribly South Carolina governor Nikki Halley in her response to
[14:01.880 --> 14:14.360]  the state of the union address saying Republicans should resist quote the
[14:14.360 --> 14:19.880]  siren call of the angriest voices she confirmed she was referring to you
[14:19.880 --> 14:26.000]  among others was she out of line and how would a president Trump unite the
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.720]  party okay first of all Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers
[14:30.720 --> 14:34.880]  actually a close friend and I wherever you're sitting Nikki I am a friend we're
[14:34.880 --> 14:41.200]  friends that's good but she did say she did say there was anger and I could say
[14:41.200 --> 14:47.200]  oh I'm not angry I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I
[14:47.200 --> 14:53.680]  will gladly accept the mantle of anger our military is a disaster our health
[14:53.680 --> 14:58.920]  care is a horror show Obamacare we're gonna repeal it and replace it we have
[14:58.920 --> 15:04.200]  no borders our vets are being treated horribly the legal immigration is
[15:04.200 --> 15:10.440]  beyond belief our country is being run by incompetent people I'll stop there I
[15:10.440 --> 15:14.760]  am everything you said is true except the incompetence they put incompetent
[15:14.760 --> 15:18.480]  people in the low levels and mid levels who will just follow the computer
[15:18.480 --> 15:22.320]  programs basically do what they're told and not question but at the top this is
[15:22.320 --> 15:25.600]  by design the globalists write books about it they brag about it they're
[15:25.600 --> 15:29.920]  taking over the planet with economic warfare but great job oh and I would
[15:29.920 --> 15:40.880]  say great job to Fox business they did the opposite of CNBC CNBC got skewered by
[15:40.880 --> 15:46.840]  nasty questions by twisting things by being petulant by being arrogant both of
[15:46.840 --> 15:52.640]  the commentators both the questioners were respectful they they did a great
[15:52.640 --> 15:55.760]  job and I'm not defending mainstream media they just did a great job still a
[15:55.760 --> 16:01.040]  lot of the debate was academic because most those Republicans won't actually do
[16:01.040 --> 16:05.480]  what they say they're pushing they're known for being total flying around in
[16:05.480 --> 16:09.360]  the wind like a weather vane I saw a political commercial where Rubio's a
[16:09.360 --> 16:12.680]  weather vane flip-flopping you know spinning in the wind that's absolutely
[16:12.680 --> 16:18.880]  true and so are the others other than people like Ted Cruz and folks like
[16:18.880 --> 16:22.800]  Rand Paul they have not flip-flopped they've changed a few issues here and
[16:22.800 --> 16:25.640]  said why they did but but overall they've been very very very very very
[16:25.640 --> 16:31.840]  steady but this is really all about the fact that everybody's watching the
[16:31.840 --> 16:36.040]  Republican debates while meanwhile the Democrats hide them on the weekend
[16:36.040 --> 16:39.320]  during playoff games because they don't want you to hear Hillary and don't want
[16:39.320 --> 16:42.800]  you to hear Bernie Sanders and hear all the socialism and hear all the tyranny
[16:42.800 --> 16:47.080]  and hear all the anti-gun stuff they're hiding them that's really the big
[16:47.080 --> 16:51.960]  issue here that's what has to be dealt with here now I'm not going to get to
[16:51.960 --> 16:55.360]  the Ted Cruz clip but he comes out and says look I'm you know New York we all
[16:55.360 --> 17:00.240]  know liberal pro-abortion you know gay marriage we know what New York is
[17:00.240 --> 17:03.520]  conservatives don't really come out of there and he's trying to play to the
[17:03.520 --> 17:08.120]  South I don't think Cruz really understands the South and the West and
[17:08.120 --> 17:12.800]  stuff okay northerners love Southerners Southerners love northerners when it
[17:12.800 --> 17:18.920]  comes down to Americana Southerners love Trump I get the fact he can't really
[17:18.920 --> 17:21.880]  trust money's been up in the elite of New York if he would have said Trump's
[17:21.880 --> 17:26.960]  from the elite of New York he's been for Hillary before he just doesn't have a
[17:26.960 --> 17:31.080]  history we don't know we're getting what he says sounds great but with me you
[17:31.080 --> 17:35.440]  know what you're going to get because of my track record I mean I like Ted Cruz
[17:35.440 --> 17:43.360]  he's he's great the problem is is that he walks into things he and he just really
[17:43.360 --> 17:48.480]  let Trump tear him up and then here's Trump's response to him talking about
[17:48.480 --> 17:51.280]  New York I would have said you know I think you're part of the New York elites
[17:51.280 --> 17:55.080]  that feed on the great people of New York that's what New Yorkers really think
[17:55.080 --> 17:58.960]  instead of what he did let's go to part of this clip from Trump as we get ready
[17:58.960 --> 18:07.080]  to go to break here he is responding to Cruz quote insulting New Yorkers so
[18:07.080 --> 18:13.480]  conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan including William F Buckley and
[18:13.480 --> 18:18.960]  others just so you understand and just so if I could because he insulted a lot
[18:18.960 --> 18:23.600]  of people I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made that New York is
[18:23.600 --> 18:28.760]  a great place it's got great people it's got loving people wonderful people when
[18:28.760 --> 18:35.080]  the World Trade Center came down I saw something that no place on earth could
[18:35.080 --> 18:39.480]  have handled more beautifully more humanely than New York you're two one
[18:39.480 --> 18:51.600]  hundred and ten story buildings come crashing down I saw them come down
[18:51.600 --> 18:57.360]  thousands of people killed and the cleanup started the next day and it was
[18:57.360 --> 19:03.160]  the most horrific cleanup probably in the history of doing this and in
[19:03.160 --> 19:07.320]  construction I was down there and I've never seen anything like it and the
[19:07.320 --> 19:13.120]  people in New York fought and fought and fought and we saw more death and even
[19:13.120 --> 19:18.160]  the smell of death nobody understood it and it was with us for months the smell
[19:18.160 --> 19:23.200]  the air and we rebuilt downtown Manhattan and everybody in the world
[19:23.200 --> 19:28.040]  watched and everybody in the world love New York and love New Yorkers and I have
[19:28.040 --> 19:33.600]  to tell you that was a very insulting statement that take me well I mean it's
[19:33.600 --> 19:36.920]  what Democrats would do and I'm not attacking Ted Cruz but divide and conquer
[19:36.920 --> 19:41.440]  and I'm not attacking Cruz it just that's why he got torn up we'll be right

[20:01.200 --> 20:04.680]  pickpocketing ten years ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying

[20:08.120 --> 20:12.360]  with a built-in radio chip called RFID I felt having to broadcast my personal
[20:12.360 --> 20:16.480]  information was an invasion of privacy soon after it was also announced that
[20:16.480 --> 20:20.880]  credit cards debit cards US passports hotel room keys and even transit passes
[20:20.880 --> 20:25.240]  would all soon incorporate RFID it was then I formed ID stronghold to share
[20:25.240 --> 20:28.920]  my inventions and blocking RFID signals with the world there are a lot of

[25:08.320 --> 25:13.880]  in to the debate and David Knight has some really good points on this and I'll
[25:13.880 --> 25:18.200]  tell you talking to David Knight he likes Rand Paul because he knows he's more
[25:18.200 --> 25:23.080]  consistent he also likes Cruz but doesn't trust him for a few reasons like
[25:23.080 --> 25:26.400]  Goldman Sachs connections CFR things like that hey I don't care as long as
[25:26.400 --> 25:28.960]  you've been part of the power structure and come over and join us and vote
[25:28.960 --> 25:33.040]  right and filibuster and fight for the Second Amendment Darth Vader you know
[25:33.040 --> 25:36.440]  destroys Palpatine at the end and there's historical cases you know Saul
[25:36.440 --> 25:41.880]  fighting against you know corruption and becoming a Paul but trust but verify
[25:41.880 --> 25:46.040]  I know Paul's the most steadfast but he can be influenced and try to be too
[25:46.040 --> 25:52.400]  gentlemanly he's not perfect either Cruz I think is probably the smartest when it
[25:52.400 --> 25:57.200]  comes to politics and actually how things work on business it's Trump I think
[25:57.200 --> 26:02.000]  Trump wants to really for this country and his own ego wants to save America he
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.600]  said the right thing he said I don't care about my company I'll hand it over to
[26:04.600 --> 26:09.760]  good managers and stuff you know if I win the presidency that's the big issue so
[26:09.760 --> 26:12.920]  you he was point blank about that saying all the right things not
[26:12.920 --> 26:15.920]  apologizing for saying we've got a shut off route you know the Muslims coming
[26:15.920 --> 26:20.000]  until they're vetted because they're not being vetted that's the issue that's
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.400]  totally common sense even Lewis Farrakhan agrees with him on that but we're
[26:25.400 --> 26:29.600]  going to get coming up the next segment with David Knight and he's gonna hot show
[26:29.600 --> 26:37.840]  this into the Constitution section 1 article 2 clause 5 what it really means
[26:37.840 --> 26:42.560]  and the truth is Obama really wasn't eligible if his dad was really from
[26:42.560 --> 26:46.680]  Kenya but the truth is they were hiding all that his dad was really Frank
[26:46.680 --> 26:50.720]  Marshall Davis the whole thing was a giant scam it's open and shut dreams my
[26:50.720 --> 26:55.680]  real father on DVD and info wars dot com but separately he's gonna go over all
[26:55.680 --> 27:01.040]  that and he's got a good point I don't want to disqualify 10 crews I don't
[27:01.040 --> 27:05.440]  want to do that but I'm gonna be honest with you what Trump is saying is true
[27:05.440 --> 27:09.200]  we have all these big lawsuits that have been announced will be filed next week
[27:09.200 --> 27:13.320]  multiple lawsuits have been announced by the Democrats and others Trump was
[27:13.320 --> 27:17.000]  right the word was already out as of debate time they're gonna sue to block
[27:17.000 --> 27:22.440]  Cruz now that said folks you got to choose because if you're gonna say the
[27:22.440 --> 27:25.600]  Constitution Bill of Rights can't be violated 2nd Amendment 1st Amendment
[27:25.600 --> 27:30.720]  4th Amendment 10th Amendment well what about this area on the fact that when
[27:30.720 --> 27:38.640]  you go over it and the quote strict interpretation you can't do it and by
[27:38.640 --> 27:44.280]  the way it's almost questionable it's it's it's you know here's the white
[27:44.280 --> 27:47.640]  here's the gray here's the black area with Cruz it's a little bit in the gray
[27:47.640 --> 27:51.520]  with Obama it was way over in the you know dark gray with Trump it's in the
[27:51.520 --> 27:56.400]  edge of gray almost you know not as far as Cruz questionable but you know he's
[27:56.400 --> 27:59.760]  where the white starts turning gray because his mother born in Scotland and
[27:59.760 --> 28:02.600]  and we're gonna break down the reason for this letter I'm gonna shoot a
[28:02.600 --> 28:07.440]  special report for the nightly news on it as well the Austrian Hungarian Empire
[28:07.440 --> 28:12.280]  the Spanish the Portuguese the British others they were always sending their
[28:12.280 --> 28:17.880]  princelings and others into business and stuff into democratizing countries 250
[28:17.880 --> 28:23.120]  300 years ago right around the time we were found at 240 years ago and they
[28:23.120 --> 28:26.720]  were actually taking countries over in the electoral process because of their
[28:26.720 --> 28:30.880]  money their slickness and everything it was a new form of conquest so we were
[28:30.880 --> 28:36.080]  worried about that there are some areas that you could actually argue maybe we're
[28:36.080 --> 28:39.760]  outdated I mean Americans aren't gonna vote for a foreigner anyways but I'm
[28:39.760 --> 28:42.840]  sorry you know I'd rather just keep it all the way it is then let them get in
[28:42.840 --> 28:46.000]  there and start taking parts of it out I mean I think I trust Ted Cruz I think
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.160]  you should be able to you know be president I believe he wants to be
[28:49.160 --> 28:53.240]  American he hates communism I buy all that it's just the Constitution is the
[28:53.240 --> 28:57.160]  Constitution we're gonna be looking at that now finally as we go to break here

[32:36.760 --> 32:41.240]  the cameras the equipment the crew the reporters you get exclusive HD higher

[33:01.800 --> 33:09.320]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[33:11.320 --> 33:15.240]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host for the rest of
[33:15.240 --> 33:21.520]  this Friday January the 15th 2016 and as I'm looking at the tickers here they're
[33:21.520 --> 33:25.680]  going down approaching 500 points down on the Dow that's a little bit over 3%
[33:25.680 --> 33:32.720]  three and a quarter percent down on the S&P the NASDAQ is down over 4% 4.12%
[33:32.720 --> 33:37.440]  so things are looking at very bad economically that will only bolster the
[33:37.440 --> 33:42.440]  case for a Donald Trump presidency because I think that when you look at
[33:42.440 --> 33:47.520]  these people on the stage I don't have any confidence based on what I saw oh
[33:47.520 --> 33:51.920]  you're gonna choose a Jeb Bush to do anything to understand what the situation
[33:51.920 --> 33:57.000]  is and of course Walmart is now going to shutter 269 stores 154 of them and the
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.080]  United States this is a story that was up on the drudge report now I thought it
[34:01.080 --> 34:05.080]  was interesting when I read this I said more than 95% of the stores set to be
[34:05.080 --> 34:10.600]  closing United States are within 10 miles of another Walmart understand what
[34:10.600 --> 34:14.040]  that's all about because I've been in a business that's been competing against
[34:14.040 --> 34:20.360]  large Wall Street financed multinational corporations what they like to do it's a
[34:20.360 --> 34:23.860]  very familiar pattern of competition if you want to call it competition it's
[34:23.860 --> 34:28.280]  predatory these people who have unlimited amounts of money because they
[34:28.280 --> 34:33.720]  can float their stuff on Wall Street and junk stocks just like we've got the
[34:33.720 --> 34:39.960]  disconnection between between our dollar and it's true value with Federal
[34:39.960 --> 34:43.080]  Reserve they can float this money just like the federal government can get the
[34:43.080 --> 34:46.080]  Federal Reserve to print money these guys can essentially print money by going
[34:46.080 --> 34:50.600]  on Wall Street and they can open up one giant Walmart after the other until they
[34:50.600 --> 34:56.760]  drive every mom and pop out of business and that's what they have done so now
[34:56.760 --> 34:59.920]  that they've done that they're going to consolidate some of that nevertheless
[34:59.920 --> 35:05.440]  we're seeing that they're shaky retail information and of course the oil market
[35:05.440 --> 35:11.080]  the oil price of oil is plummeting it dropped down below finished below $30
[35:11.080 --> 35:15.520]  a barrel we have people who are saying that they're looking for another 10
[35:15.520 --> 35:21.040]  percent decline this is Larry Fink talking about this on NBC he's a black
[35:21.040 --> 35:25.440]  rock chairman CEO he said today that he thought stocks could fall another 10
[35:25.440 --> 35:30.240]  percent that oil prices could test $25 per barrel I remember wasn't that many
[35:30.240 --> 35:33.760]  months ago that everybody was saying well could they possibly go below $40 a
[35:33.760 --> 35:37.400]  barrel boy that would be catastrophic to the oil market nevertheless that is
[35:37.400 --> 35:41.920]  about to happen and here's the other issue we're going to have if this
[35:41.920 --> 35:45.800]  continues to go through as it is we're going to have Iranian oil coming on the
[35:45.800 --> 35:49.960]  market one of the largest supplies of oil in the world is going to be coming
[35:49.960 --> 35:55.000]  online that will only push down the oil even more but here's the fundamental
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.960]  thing about the price of oil it isn't just that there's a glut the reason
[35:57.960 --> 36:03.640]  there's a glut is because demand has fallen demand has fallen because the
[36:03.640 --> 36:10.360]  economy is stopping everywhere that's why you see Apple having Foxconn in
[36:10.360 --> 36:14.680]  China declare a holiday for their people there
[36:14.680 --> 36:19.600]  essentially I'm assuming it's an unpaid holiday because of the slave wages so
[36:19.600 --> 36:23.360]  they're going to essentially shut down their factory for a while hoping that
[36:23.360 --> 36:29.200]  they can catch up to demand and there are some issues with Apple's products not
[36:29.200 --> 36:32.600]  being as innovative as they used to be before but that's just another example
[36:32.600 --> 36:37.480]  in general of how demand is falling and it's not just the Foxconn factory that's
[36:37.480 --> 36:41.720]  making iPhones that is seeing soft demand so this is something that is
[36:41.720 --> 36:47.680]  happening everywhere now if you want to prepare for what may be a very severe
[36:47.680 --> 36:51.360]  situation who knows what's going to happen we see our government and we've
[36:51.360 --> 36:53.880]  been saying this for a long time in infowars we believe that one of the
[36:53.880 --> 36:58.280]  reasons you've seen this massive adventurism even under a Democrat
[36:58.280 --> 37:03.040]  president like Obama creating war after war after war certainly there's the
[37:03.040 --> 37:06.920]  military industrial complex profit motive these people want to restart the
[37:06.920 --> 37:10.360]  Cold War because that is a massive profit center for them you can make a
[37:10.360 --> 37:16.040]  lot more money fighting the Russians with bombers and intercontinental
[37:16.040 --> 37:21.080]  ballistic missiles and giant navies then you can if you want to try to fight an
[37:21.080 --> 37:25.560]  unconventional warfare nevertheless the way they've put the war on terror they
[37:25.560 --> 37:29.280]  positioned it as a police state industrial complex where they want to go out
[37:29.280 --> 37:34.120]  and militarize our police to that level and put camera surveillance on every
[37:34.120 --> 37:39.240]  corner multiple cameras everywhere the capability to record and to analyze
[37:39.240 --> 37:42.840]  everybody's every movement your activity-based intelligence your
[37:42.840 --> 37:47.520]  geospatial intelligence mapping the human domain that's a lot of money they
[37:47.520 --> 37:51.720]  can make but of course they're doing that as well as creating the foreign wars
[37:51.720 --> 37:58.200]  because if we have a massive economic meltdown people are going to be angry
[37:58.200 --> 38:02.040]  and one of the ways that you shift their anger is with a foreign war and if you
[38:02.040 --> 38:06.440]  can't control that anger by shifting it to a foreign war you can always hit them
[38:06.440 --> 38:11.640]  with the iron fist of a police state so all that makes sense now with all that
[38:11.640 --> 38:15.720]  in mind one of the ways that you may want to prepare there's a great special
[38:15.720 --> 38:22.320]  we have an info wars store today that is 30 to 40% off our select storeable food
[38:22.320 --> 38:26.640]  and that is ending today the special for the next 24 hours only we're giving you

[38:48.560 --> 38:53.920]  for the next 24 hours only and one of the things I think that came out of the
[38:53.920 --> 38:58.760]  debate last night and Alex mentioned it was the excellent performance and let's
[38:58.760 --> 39:01.920]  say that you know some performance that's what's going on at this point there
[39:01.920 --> 39:05.320]  are some real issues and some issues that weren't talked about and we're gonna
[39:05.320 --> 39:08.680]  talk about those as well but for most of these debates that's the way they're
[39:08.680 --> 39:12.160]  evaluated going back to the first television debates they look at
[39:12.160 --> 39:16.640]  performance and when you look at that I think Donald Trump did a masterful job
[39:16.640 --> 39:22.080]  last night just from a performance standpoint even with the natural born
[39:22.080 --> 39:26.200]  citizen issue he deflected that he said hey it's other people that have this
[39:26.200 --> 39:30.360]  problem I'll I'll invite you as a vice president I would not invite him as a
[39:30.360 --> 39:34.720]  vice president because it matters to me and I'll tell you why it matters this
[39:34.720 --> 39:38.480]  boils down to whether or not we're going to have a living Constitution or
[39:38.480 --> 39:41.440]  whether or not we're going to have an originalist interpretation of the
[39:41.440 --> 39:46.400]  Constitution in other words are we going to look at the documents and go with
[39:46.400 --> 39:52.320]  what they say or are we just going to go with whatever the current dictator has
[39:52.320 --> 39:57.480]  to say or stick our finger in the wind or let the Supreme Court say it's going
[39:57.480 --> 40:01.880]  to mean whatever it says think about the fact that when you're looking at the
[40:01.880 --> 40:06.360]  term natural born citizen and they don't define it they did not define the term
[40:06.360 --> 40:11.320]  militia either both of those terms meant something very specific to them they
[40:11.320 --> 40:15.240]  felt that it was so well understood that it didn't need to be defined and we're
[40:15.240 --> 40:19.800]  going to tell you what that definition is but consider the fact that if you're
[40:19.800 --> 40:24.240]  going to let the definition of natural born citizen just kind of float in the
[40:24.240 --> 40:29.320]  wind and be interpreted as anybody wishes you're going to see them putting
[40:29.320 --> 40:35.560]  out the idea that the militia is the National Guard I had valedictorian high
[40:35.560 --> 40:39.240]  school students who worked for me telling me that and they were smart kids
[40:39.240 --> 40:44.400]  but they had been thoroughly miseducated by the government schools to
[40:44.400 --> 40:47.000]  think that the militia was an actual guard something that didn't come around
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.320]  until the early 20th century no they had a very clear definition of the
[40:51.320 --> 40:55.160]  militia we can understand what that definition is and I think this is a
[40:55.160 --> 41:00.720]  real important issue because it goes to the foundation of what are we going to
[41:00.720 --> 41:04.000]  have are we going to have a rule of law are we going to be subject to the whims
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.520]  of whoever is the current dictator in office and I think it's very important
[41:08.520 --> 41:13.680]  have that discussion and when I look at this you know if citizenship doesn't
[41:13.680 --> 41:19.600]  matter if it really doesn't matter then why don't we just have an H1B visa
[41:19.600 --> 41:24.120]  president because as I looked at the stage for me personally I didn't see
[41:24.120 --> 41:27.560]  anybody there that I really want to have for president maybe we are open this up
[41:27.560 --> 41:31.680]  to people who are not citizens of the United States let's maybe Nigel
[41:31.680 --> 41:36.640]  Farage is available or Lord Moncton or Paul Joseph Watson maybe we could get
[41:36.640 --> 41:40.120]  one of them to come over here because they understand liberty they understand
[41:40.120 --> 41:45.520]  freedom they have a freedom orientation I think they could read the Constitution
[41:45.520 --> 41:50.080]  and understand it and I think they have the personal integrity that when they
[41:50.080 --> 41:55.000]  take the oath of office to be subject to the Constitution which is our real
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.360]  king in this country I think they would take it seriously so let's just have an
[41:59.360 --> 42:04.080]  H1B visa program and we could make them citizens for four years while they're
[42:04.080 --> 42:09.560]  president and then they could move on maybe we should do that I think it's a
[42:09.560 --> 42:13.520]  very serious issue and other people think it's a serious issue too here's
[42:13.520 --> 42:17.640]  this article from Reuters one quarter of Republicans think that Cruz's
[42:17.640 --> 42:23.320]  birthplace disqualifies him for president they say a quarter think that he was
[42:23.320 --> 42:27.160]  born in Canada so therefore he's not qualified as natural born citizen well
[42:27.160 --> 42:30.240]  they would have that right and the interesting thing is that it's about the
[42:30.240 --> 42:35.360]  same percentage with all voters not just with Republicans 27% of all voters
[42:35.360 --> 42:41.520]  28% of independents believe that they say only 47% of voters surveyed responded
[42:41.520 --> 42:45.880]  thought that Cruz was qualified to be president with regard to his citizenship
[42:45.880 --> 42:52.040]  another 26% said they're not sure so I'm gonna talk to those 26% here in just a
[42:52.040 --> 42:57.680]  moment and tell you why I'm sure that he is not qualified to be president and
[42:57.680 --> 43:01.280]  they go on to say and this is what Trump said last night I already know
[43:01.280 --> 43:06.880]  Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit let's play Alan Grayson this was a
[43:06.880 --> 43:11.600]  comment that he made on January the 7th and of course he didn't just discover
[43:11.600 --> 43:17.960]  this as Ted Cruz was speaking in the debate he said well Donald Trump wasn't
[43:17.960 --> 43:21.120]  concerned about this back in September and the Constitution hasn't changed well
[43:21.120 --> 43:24.880]  you know I was concerned about it Alan Grayson was talking about it other
[43:24.880 --> 43:27.920]  people were talking about it back in September the Constitution he's right
[43:27.920 --> 43:34.480]  doesn't change and if Ted Cruz wants to run as a constitutionalist then he owes
[43:34.480 --> 43:39.840]  it to us to not just play debating parlor tricks like he did to say well
[43:39.840 --> 43:44.920]  Donald Trump is not qualified because his mother was from Scotland Donald Trump's
[43:44.920 --> 43:50.800]  mother was an American citizen four years before Donald Trump was born his
[43:50.800 --> 43:57.600]  grandfather immigrated in the 1880s Donald Trump is a natural born citizen
[43:57.600 --> 44:03.800]  born in America of parents who were American citizens Rubio is an anchor
[44:03.800 --> 44:10.080]  baby he was born here before his parents were citizens the parents cannot
[44:10.080 --> 44:15.720]  convey something they don't possess and they could not convey natural born
[44:15.720 --> 44:20.600]  citizenship to Marco Rubio when he was born they weren't American citizens so
[44:20.600 --> 44:24.240]  we have out of the top three as drudge says the top three candidates according
[44:24.240 --> 44:29.520]  to his poll he says a three-person race out of those three candidates the only
[44:29.520 --> 44:36.200]  one who's even a natural born citizen is Donald Trump and if you want to explain
[44:36.200 --> 44:40.960]  why you're eligible mr. Cruz what you should do is you could tell you could
[44:40.960 --> 44:46.520]  explain to us give us a the benefit of your constitutional knowledge you said
[44:46.520 --> 44:50.960]  you've argued cases before the Supreme Court tell us instead of engaging in
[44:50.960 --> 44:56.960]  this kind of debate sophistry where you cast dispersion on it the yardstick is
[44:56.960 --> 45:00.160]  not whether or not Donald Trump is a natural born citizen it's not whether
[45:00.160 --> 45:05.520]  or not Marco Rubio could run for office or Bobby Jindal they can't they're not
[45:05.520 --> 45:09.800]  eligible okay they can run for office they could get elected but some of us
[45:09.800 --> 45:14.440]  are going to challenge them in court because the Constitution matters let's
[45:14.440 --> 45:18.800]  play that clip from Alan Grayson well it's a legitimate issue you know the
[45:18.800 --> 45:23.520]  Constitution says natural born citizen also provides an age limit so for
[45:23.520 --> 45:27.000]  instance Arnold Schwarzenegger clearly is not qualified or eligible to be
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.880]  present in the United States whether Ted Cruz falls on that side of the line or
[45:30.880 --> 45:34.720]  the other side of the line is a matter for the courts to determine and there
[45:34.720 --> 45:37.720]  are legitimate arguments he's made some legitimate markets in his defense and
[45:37.720 --> 45:41.560]  there are legitimate arguments made against that do you plan to file a
[45:41.560 --> 45:47.080]  lawsuit yes when would we see such lawsuit if and when he becomes the
[45:47.080 --> 45:51.520]  nominee and tries to qualify for the ballot and also potentially after he
[45:51.520 --> 45:55.240]  qualifies for the ballot we have a statute that says that those plans can
[45:55.240 --> 45:59.520]  be made even after the election you understand that's what Donald Trump was
[45:59.520 --> 46:03.160]  talking about and so Donald Trump didn't want to press the issue of natural
[46:03.160 --> 46:06.440]  born citizenship but I think it does matter but I look at this I'm very
[46:06.440 --> 46:10.920]  disturbed because I don't believe that Barack Obama was eligible to be
[46:10.920 --> 46:15.080]  president based on what we knew at the time as Alex said he believes that his
[46:15.080 --> 46:20.120]  father was Frank Marshall Davis nevertheless with the narrative that
[46:20.120 --> 46:24.240]  he's giving us if we go by the fact that he says his father was a Kenyan
[46:24.240 --> 46:29.160]  citizen that his mother was an American citizen and that he was born in Hawaii if
[46:29.160 --> 46:33.600]  you believe all of that it's true okay let's just assume that that's the case
[46:33.600 --> 46:37.800]  alright he would not be a natural born citizen because his father was not a
[46:37.800 --> 46:42.760]  citizen but it's far worse than that with Ted Cruz because he here's a
[46:42.760 --> 46:47.480]  situation where his father's not a citizen like Obama and he's not born in
[46:47.480 --> 46:50.920]  America and then the question as to whether or not his mother is an
[46:50.920 --> 46:54.680]  American citizen see the sophistry that he's engaged in as he shows his mother's
[46:54.680 --> 46:58.760]  birth certificate the questions about his mother came up because she was on a
[46:58.760 --> 47:03.840]  Canadian voting registry now there's no record that she voted in Canada while
[47:03.840 --> 47:07.440]  she was there nevertheless the way they would do this they would go door to door
[47:07.440 --> 47:11.600]  like a census they would talk to people they say are you here you Canadian
[47:11.600 --> 47:15.480]  citizen alright we'll put you on the roll and so they listed both his father
[47:15.480 --> 47:19.920]  who was a Canadian citizen and his mother as being Canadian citizens
[47:19.920 --> 47:24.520]  nevertheless it doesn't really even matter whether or not his mother was a
[47:24.520 --> 47:31.400]  citizen that is not enough to make him a natural born citizen and as Alan Combs
[47:31.400 --> 47:37.240]  was talking to Alan Grayson on his program Combs said it's interesting to
[47:37.240 --> 47:41.080]  me that people who had a problem with Obama don't have a problem with Ted Cruz
[47:41.080 --> 47:45.640]  who was literally born in another country and only recently renounced his
[47:45.640 --> 47:49.800]  Canadian citizenship after he became a senator well you know I do I do have a
[47:49.800 --> 47:53.040]  problem with that I've had a problem with that from the very beginning haven't
[47:53.040 --> 47:57.120]  spent a lot of time talking on it about it because he wasn't near the top now
[47:57.120 --> 48:00.680]  that he's near the top we need to look at this and focus on this especially
[48:00.680 --> 48:04.800]  because it goes to the fundamental issue of whether or not he believes in an
[48:04.800 --> 48:08.440]  originalist interpretation of the Constitution or if he thinks it's a
[48:08.440 --> 48:13.320]  living document or if he thinks that he's an exception to the Constitution
[48:13.320 --> 48:19.080]  like Barack Obama that if he doesn't qualify and is not eligible then he can
[48:19.080 --> 48:23.760]  just throw the Constitution under the bus for his own personal ambition see
[48:23.760 --> 48:28.720]  that's the real issue here now Grayson went on to say I don't know he says the
[48:28.720 --> 48:32.080]  Constitution says natural born Americans so now we're counting Canadians as
[48:32.080 --> 48:36.360]  natural born Americans he says look even the anchor babies were actually born
[48:36.360 --> 48:40.160]  here he doesn't even meet that qualification and Colm says right and
[48:40.160 --> 48:43.160]  although I don't like the term anchor babies it's been embraced by people like
[48:43.160 --> 48:46.800]  Donald Trump but Ted Cruz he said Marco Rubio who may in fact be one I
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.400]  understand yeah that's true so Marco Rubio as an anchor baby Ted Cruz is a
[48:51.400 --> 48:57.600]  Canadian and we're looking at these guys as possibly running for president now
[48:57.600 --> 49:02.040]  here's where a lot of this really picked up speed and this is on Monday the former
[49:02.040 --> 49:07.840]  law professor who taught Ted Cruz at Harvard Lawrence tribe wrote an op-ed
[49:07.840 --> 49:12.320]  piece in the Boston Globe on Monday and this is the title of it he says under
[49:12.320 --> 49:17.080]  Ted Cruz's logic his own logic he is ineligible for the White House he said
[49:17.080 --> 49:21.320]  people are entitled to their own opinions about what the definition ought
[49:21.320 --> 49:25.840]  to be but the kind of judge that Ted Cruz says he admires and would appoint to
[49:25.840 --> 49:30.040]  the Supreme Court is an originalist one who claims to be bound by the narrowly
[49:30.040 --> 49:34.920]  historical meaning of the Constitution's terms at the time of its adoption to this
[49:34.920 --> 49:39.240]  kind of judge to his kind of judge Cruz ironically would not be eligible
[49:39.240 --> 49:42.880]  because illegal principles that prevailed in the 1780s and 90s required
[49:42.880 --> 49:48.840]  someone actually be born on US soil to be a natural born citizen even having two
[49:48.840 --> 49:53.000]  US parents would not survive suffice and having just an American mother as
[49:53.000 --> 49:59.000]  Cruz did would have been insufficient at the time because they made dissent from
[49:59.000 --> 50:04.600]  the father decisive not from the mother but from the father now this is the key
[50:04.600 --> 50:10.480]  point here even more so the besides that that construct and and Alex touched on
[50:10.480 --> 50:14.720]  this when he said people were concerned about European intrigue and yes he says
[50:14.720 --> 50:20.000]  but the narrow definition reflected 18th century fears of tyrannical takeover
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.800]  of our nation by someone who was loyal to a foreign power fears that no longer
[50:24.800 --> 50:28.400]  makes sense but the same could be said of the fears that a tyrannical federal
[50:28.400 --> 50:34.200]  army might overrun our state militias oh okay so he says so we're going to look
[50:34.200 --> 50:37.320]  at the Second Amendment's right to bear arms as a historical relic limit the
[50:37.320 --> 50:40.520]  right to bearing arms by members of today's state militias the National
[50:40.520 --> 50:45.360]  Guard we would never have to worry about somebody imposing foreign values on
[50:45.360 --> 50:51.040]  our country by executive order would we stay with us we'll be right back

[54:00.800 --> 54:06.040]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight we're gonna be joined by
[54:06.040 --> 54:10.520]  economists as well as the commentary from Alex Jones coming up in the next hour
[54:10.520 --> 54:13.720]  about what is going on with the economy and of course as I'm looking at this
[54:13.720 --> 54:18.200]  we've got the major markets in the United States down three to three and a
[54:18.200 --> 54:22.280]  half percent across the board everyone is very concerned about what's going on
[54:22.280 --> 54:29.040]  we see the Chinese economy plummeting we see oil plummeting demand is plummeting
[54:29.040 --> 54:33.920]  so it we're up for some rough roads coming up Alex is going to be talking to
[54:33.920 --> 54:36.920]  us in the next hour he's got a special report that he's cut we're gonna be
[54:36.920 --> 54:41.280]  talking to Gerald Salenty in the program as well as Peter Schiff about what's
[54:41.280 --> 54:45.920]  going to happen with the economy now we've also got some articles up on
[54:45.920 --> 54:51.200]  infowars.com Noam Chomsky says Erdogan is aiding terrorist of course that'd be
[54:51.200 --> 54:57.760]  the head of Turkey and there was an interesting article about him the same
[54:57.760 --> 55:02.760]  guy Erdogan in Turkey the same guy who's been buying millions of dollars
[55:02.760 --> 55:06.800]  worth of oil a day from ISIS you've seen the videos if you watch our broadcast
[55:06.800 --> 55:12.960]  of the massive caravan of oil being coming from ISIS controlled territories
[55:12.960 --> 55:18.320]  and to Turkey well he has arrested a dozen professors for simply signing a
[55:18.320 --> 55:22.600]  petition denouncing military operations against Kurds in the southeast part of
[55:22.600 --> 55:27.760]  the country as I point out even joking even a joking reference comparing
[55:27.760 --> 55:33.920]  Gollum and Erdogan is enough to get you thrown in jail in Turkey that's our
[55:33.920 --> 55:41.120]  ally you know Erdogan's our ally in Turkey just like the guys who cut off 50
[55:41.120 --> 55:46.560]  people's heads the beginning of the year happy new year in Saudi Arabia let's
[55:46.560 --> 55:49.920]  kill all of our political opponents and just chop their heads off they kill
[55:49.920 --> 55:54.720]  more people than ISIS but those are our allies in the area RT says Washington's
[55:54.720 --> 56:00.000]  new and improved plan for Syria is to have a Sunni stand a safe zone for
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.440]  terrorists I think that's a brilliant way to refer to that of course we had
[56:04.440 --> 56:10.440]  Gary North years past would talk about the areas underneath Russia as chaos
[56:10.440 --> 56:14.960]  stand and of course one of the reasons it was chaos stand was because it was a
[56:14.960 --> 56:19.400]  policy of the United States government from the 1960s to use Islamic radicals
[56:19.400 --> 56:24.400]  to destabilize Russia as they're using Islamic radicals to destabilize the West
[56:24.400 --> 56:28.920]  now it is the same people the people who are our government are doing that same
[56:28.920 --> 56:34.560]  thing I think it's brilliant that Trump has rented an Iowa theater to show the
[56:34.560 --> 56:39.320]  movie 13 hours for free to people you know this is a story and we got an
[56:39.320 --> 56:43.960]  article up on info wars.com that by Kurt Nemo says the real story of what
[56:43.960 --> 56:47.480]  happened in Libya will take down Hillary Clinton says unfortunately the film
[56:47.480 --> 56:51.360]  doesn't mention Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama it avoids politics it
[56:51.360 --> 56:56.040]  steps around the real reason for the CIA mission in Benghazi and that was to
[56:56.040 --> 57:02.160]  ship CIA arms from Libya to Syria how about that that's where it all began it
[57:02.160 --> 57:06.280]  was going on there and of course it's going to miss that and this is going to
[57:06.280 --> 57:10.440]  be a very powerful movie because you know movies are visceral as Stalin said
[57:10.440 --> 57:15.480]  one death is a tragedy a million deaths are just a statistic if you watch a
[57:15.480 --> 57:19.960]  movie then it becomes especially concerning especially when you watch
[57:19.960 --> 57:25.360]  the death and by betrayal of heroes and that's what we're going to see in this
[57:25.360 --> 57:29.720]  movie that's what really what happened but I think that the the sad thing is is
[57:29.720 --> 57:35.120]  that we've had a death and betrayal of our Constitution we've had a death and
[57:35.120 --> 57:42.760]  betrayal of our nation morally and politically and of course I guess you
[57:42.760 --> 57:45.680]  know instead of it being a statistic it's just going to be an historical
[57:45.680 --> 57:51.080]  footnote that America died when we ignored the Constitution thoroughly and
[57:51.080 --> 57:54.760]  that's what I was talking about that's the real issue behind what's going on
[57:54.760 --> 57:58.440]  with a natural born citizen and let me just read you one more quote before we
[57:58.440 --> 58:02.800]  move on to another subject in 1868 when they were at the 14th amendment many
[58:02.800 --> 58:05.800]  people take that out one of the commentators there and one of the key
[58:05.800 --> 58:10.120]  authors senator Howard who wrote most of the 14th amendment said this will not
[58:10.120 --> 58:14.840]  of course include persons who are born in the United States who are foreigners
[58:14.840 --> 58:19.200]  how do you get born in the United States and be a foreigner well that's
[58:19.200 --> 58:24.080]  because your parents aren't American citizens okay so do some research the
[58:24.080 --> 58:27.640]  Constitution matters we can understand what it says and if you're going to run
[58:27.640 --> 58:30.600]  for office and your constitutional scholar so you're gonna be originalist
[58:30.600 --> 58:37.880]  explain that to us we'll be right back thank you for listening to GCN visit

[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.040]  with a special report on what's going on with the economy as I continue to watch
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:27.280]  this it's still about three to three and a half percent down the major markets
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.480]  here in the United States course we're going to be closed on Monday that's part
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.920]  of the panic people are concerned that the Asian markets are going to continue
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.360]  to drop over the weekend that they're going to drop on Monday and they're
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.520]  trying to offload this on this Friday before the markets close that's a big
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:47.360]  part of what's going on with that we're going to have Gerald Salenty as well as
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.320]  Peter Schiff joining us later in the program Gerald Salenty is going to
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:54.400]  join us at the bottom of the hour and then Peter Schiff after him there we're
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.480]  going to talk to them about the economy also we'll ask them about what they
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:03.640]  thought about the debate last night and the the real state of the Union not the
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:10.480]  one that was a fantasy land that that was given to us by Barack Obama one of
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.920]  the things that came up that did not come up in the debate last night but came
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.480]  up to date on the news Justin Amash has offered a bill to repeal the new
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.320]  cybersecurity law that would be CISA he points out he introduced this bill on
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:29.120]  Wednesday to repeal CISA he says the this is the worst anti-privacy law
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:33.600]  since USA Patriot Act he says it gives businesses legal protections to encourage
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.840]  them to share more data on hacking threats with the government so that's a
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:42.000]  whole thing you offer immunity to the corporations to give up the data that
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.080]  they've collected on other people under the legal fiction that that's not my
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.600]  data but that data belongs to Verizon or to AT&T and they can do with it
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.360]  whatever they wish and so then they would come back some of them would say
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:59.280]  well I don't feel comfortable with this I feel like I've got some moral
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:05.120]  responsibility some legal liability if I violate the privacy of my customers and
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.440]  so they say okay you don't have that anymore so turn it over that's what's
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.560]  really behind this and as Amash says he said the Cybersecurity Act was
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:18.080]  negotiated in secret by a few members of Congress it was added quietly to the
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:23.720]  2009 page omnibus bill to avoid scrutiny most representatives are probably
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:27.600]  unaware they even voted for this legislation because they've offered it
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.680]  multiple times offered CISPA two times offered SOPA Act PIPA you know they had
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.560]  all these different variations all doing the same thing removing liability for
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.080]  corporations so they can pressure them to give up the information of course we
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:44.600]  had a short question on this last night during the debate they asked Jeb Bush
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.960]  about it goes well I would get Tim Cook you know the CEO of Apple and other
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:52.280]  corporations in here would talk about encryption and privacy and that sort of
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.800]  thing and it's like oh really so that's the way in a Bush administration let's
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.760]  be honest the way it would happen and virtually all these guys administrations
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:05.080]  they wouldn't consult the Constitution they would talk to the multinational
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:08.760]  corporate bosses who run them and say well what do you have what can we
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:13.880]  negotiate how can we sell this to the public how can we make this palatable to
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.760]  them you know I know I've got my own goals I want to know what everybody is
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:21.000]  doing you want to make money right we can make that happen so let's work out
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.600]  something on how we can keep these people under our feet and pick their
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.640]  pockets now joining Justin Amash in this effort is a bipartisan group of
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.640]  privacy-minded civil liberties focused co-sponsors including Democrat John
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:39.920]  Conyers Democrat Zo Lofgren Republicans Thomas Massey from Kentucky Ted Poe
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:45.680]  from Texas and Jared Paulus from Colorado thank you regardless of what
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.840]  party you're in we need to join with people on these fundamental issues of
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:56.040]  obeying the law obeying our privacy obeying the Fourth Amendment and not
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:00.560]  turning this country into this surveillance state that is becoming and
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:03.640]  that's one of the things that concerned me yesterday as well just before the
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.840]  debate we saw Ted Cruz had shifted his position on Ed Snowden he'd originally
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.920]  said if it's the case that the federal government is seizing millions of
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:17.120]  personal records yes it is the case mr. Cruz about law-abiding citizens and if
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.560]  it is the case that there are minimal restrictions on accessing or reviewing
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:24.840]  those records yes that is the case mr. Cruz then I think mr. Snowden has done a
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.160]  considerable public service but now he says today we know that Snowden
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.960]  violated federal laws that his actions materially aided terrorists now that's
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:38.880]  not true mr. Cruz and so he says under the Constitution giving aid to our
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.200]  enemies is treason so he joins the chorus that wants to call Snowden a
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:48.800]  traitor no he exposed criminal activity by the traders who run our government
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:52.040]  stay with us we'll be right back with Alex Jones breaking down economic news
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:57.640]  Hillary Clinton is running for president as an advocate for women's rights but
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:02.680]  there is a shocking side to her story that has been carefully covered up
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:07.160]  until now the notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women no
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:12.000]  bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically that's
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.200]  GOP presidential consultant Roger Stone talking about his book the Clinton's
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:22.120]  war on women from the Alex Jones show where Roger Stone says Hillary Clinton
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.680]  played a huge role in the cover-up of her husband's rape allegation well
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:31.920]  Hillary's the one who runs the cover up now on the campaign trail Hillary refuses
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:37.600]  to answer any questions about the women involved in Bill Clinton's sex scandals
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:42.280]  Donald Trump appearing on Fox News Sunday over the weekend said that some of
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:46.760]  the women involved in Bill Clinton's sexual assault allegations have been

[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:44.640]  mouth hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times the last two
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:52.640]  years really longer than that since 2008 that a global economic designed meltdown
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:57.360]  was coming and out of it they're going to announce a new planetary government
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:05.920]  backed up by strategic drawing rights SDRs it's just digital made up money
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:14.440]  backed up with carbon taxes digital money transfer taxes VATs paid by regional
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:20.640]  government combines into the IMF World Bank International Bank of Settlements
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:25.680]  controlled by the WTO and all of these secret agreements like the TPP that are
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:30.120]  now public after they put them in place that transfer all power to unelected
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:35.880]  corporate boards that have diplomatic and corporate immunity and for all
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:43.120]  intents and purposes are about 95% tax exempt they put so many taxes on us it's
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.360]  hard for them to avoid them all but it's incredible whether it's the socialist
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:50.120]  government of France caught all the Swiss bank accounts not paying taxes and
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:53.440]  then they don't get in trouble or the EU bureaucrats not paying taxes look it up
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:10:00.360]  they're unelected the EU Parliament is advisory to the permanent bureaucracy
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:05.920]  that's now creating an international police force and controls NATO I mean
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.300]  you want to be conquered by 21st century tyranny it isn't Napoleon it isn't
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:14.120]  Hitler it isn't the Russians it's this global corporate combine it's the new
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:20.440]  world order and I put out a bunch of Facebook mentions a bunch of YouTube's
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:27.440]  the last month saying global collapse imminent emergency I talked to top
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:30.760]  elites you see all the high-powered folks that come on the show from
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:36.120]  Congress people to famous special forces commanders to top movie producers to
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:40.200]  major bankers I mean we for every person you see on the show or hear on the
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:45.400]  show there's five or six prominent I talked to off record I was told five
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:52.520]  years ago by a billionaire defense contractor owner multi-billionaire that
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:56.800]  they were leaving the United States and then I had four to five maybe six years
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:01.720]  until it was quote gone and they were going to New Zealand also the Cook Islands
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.240]  with their money and then who I was came to me talked to me they saw me in a
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:09.440]  lawyer's office in a building I kind of knew I knew I'd seen them before but
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.720]  then I looked them up I was like oh my god that is who they said they were I'd
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:15.480]  like a 15-minute conversation with them and I said well what is it that's happening
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.200]  and they said you already know you already say it you're gonna be getting
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.440]  very popular you're gonna be getting very big you're gonna be getting very very
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:26.360]  famous I was like well I don't want to get famous off that she said look you're
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:32.400]  just dead on now we're here Walmart's closed hundreds of stores a hundred
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.400]  million Americans are on some form of welfare and 98 million are out of the
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:39.000]  workforce they're flooding us with unskilled workers on record to drive
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.920]  down wages and bankrupt is Obamacare is designed to bankrupt the country the
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:47.320]  clowered in heaven they're just doing everything to bankrupt our fracking
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:52.480]  industry people demonize it all day okay it was only economy we had left we're
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:57.200]  sitting here watching all this happen and Obama's on the news last week saying
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.960]  you know anybody that says that we don't have the best economy it's not great you
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.480]  know it's basically full of bull I'm gonna show you the clip in a moment the
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:07.640]  actual quote it's like he said there are no ISIS in America no threat in two days
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:11.880]  later there's an attack on San Bernardino so he says up it's down he says
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.080]  left it's right if he says black it's white if he says it's polka dotted it's
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:20.600]  not I mean it's incredible and it's on purpose lying to us they also say well
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:24.160]  don't be gloom and doom that'll destroy confidence it'll get worse that's not
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.040]  what's doing this I've seen thousands of comments over the years saying you're
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:30.960]  gloom and doom you're gonna cause the collapse I didn't cause the derivatives
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:39.520]  to be one plus quadrillion in 2008 now it's 2.2 as of last year we haven't got
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:44.080]  new numbers in six months I mean you're talking about mega massive in
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:48.440]  formation here it's it's hundreds of times all the real wealth and all the
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.680]  world it's impossible to pay it's not our debt it was created it was absolutely
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:13:03.400]  set up and developed so that we could be tied to all that debt bail out the big
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.880]  banks and in bailing it out we become their slaves and in debt to them this is
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:12.160]  economic warfare and look I don't respond to the trolls but there's national
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:16.120]  trolls the New York Times and others you know saying I'm a fear peddler porn
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:23.920]  fear porn Gerald Salente is no or not the fundamentals are two plus two equals four
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.560]  and everything has been to shut down small businesses everything has been to
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:30.480]  vertically integrate and consolidate power everything has been to take over
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:33.960]  local banks and real lenders the big banks get their own free money now they
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:38.560]  don't even lend anymore and it's getting worse this is a controlled economic
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:42.480]  takeover that's the problem it'd be one thing if it was just a normal deal but
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:46.640]  29 was staged that's come out in Congress this is totally staged it's
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:50.960]  going to be worse probably it's gonna be real bad it's happening for sure but
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:55.200]  it's gonna be bad they can't pump up the markets forever and they're just giving
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:58.160]  themselves the money when they do it and destroying the overall economy so
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.600]  you're damned if you do you're damned if you don't now we're gonna play this
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:03.840]  report on the show today as well as David Knight and others break it down and
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:09.400]  they've already played this clip on the show today but here's Obama you know
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:16.520]  openly saying anyone who says economy declining is lying okay here you go
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:26.600]  anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction and
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.040]  then he goes on to say it's wonderful when all the fundamentals are the
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.200]  opposite now for the globalist things are wonderful because they're consolidating
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:41.160]  control they're crony capitalist look at this Walmart the close 629 stores CNBC
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:51.760]  or I said that wrong 269 stores and they're going to lay off 16,000 people
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:58.040]  there's the article from zero hedge up on info wars.com so check that out for
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:03.080]  yourself look I can show you a bunch of clips I can sit here and go over with you
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:08.960]  all day long all I'm telling you ish they tell you believe in confidence believe
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:12.440]  everything's fine get into debt go along with the system everything's going to be
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:17.400]  wonderful trust the system on and on and on and the more we trust the system the
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:21.360]  more we go along what they say the worst it gets because it's a plan to take over
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:27.880]  the world and use economic depravity and economic deprivation to control people
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:33.720]  this is their own strategy written by Carol Quigley in 1967 in tragedy and hope
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:37.720]  a battle plan for the CIA and the State Department run by these foreign interest
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:43.480]  our country got taken over in 1947 by the National Security Act by foreign
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.720]  interests we've had a soft coup for a long time inside the country building
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.760]  their world government empire with our blood our sweat our tears our money our
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:56.600]  treasure our young men and now women and then we get the blame for all of it
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:02.200]  the globalists hate us more than anybody they want to mount the republic's head
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:06.200]  on the wall after they're done sucking us dry like a big fat spider eating a
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:13.560]  weevil stop being fools stop buying into the propaganda break your conditioning
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:17.920]  realize that lying to yourself and submitting to them only allows them to
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.320]  screw you over the awakenings happen I'm not talking to our general audience
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:24.680]  but I'm talking to other people out there that don't get it you can't side with
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.840]  the system delusionally and get out of this and then it's going to be nice to
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:34.040]  you it's predatory you're delusional you have Stockholm syndrome where you the
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:40.680]  victim worships their accuser worships their captors worships their enslavers
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:46.120]  worships the tyrants worships the parasites worships the criminals worships
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:50.520]  the scum that are raping them and robbing them and always telling them how
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:56.000]  they're bad and it's something that women historically go under Stockholm
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.320]  syndrome more than men it's biological it's evolutionary that women would get
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:03.040]  captured and taken over and they go okay okay you're right you just killed my
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.480]  husband and kids you know you're a foreign army that came in 5,000 years
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.360]  ago I'll go ahead and bow down to you I guess it's right oh you know King

[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.000]  statistically they go under Stockholm syndrome a lot quicker a lot easier
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.880]  learn helplessness but now men are pathetic it's time for you to get up and
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:37.120]  stand up break your conditioning get involved physical courage isn't what
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.280]  it's about it's about mental courage to admit what's happened to be involved to
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.400]  not care if you're ridiculed because as Mark Twain said in the beginning a
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.840]  patriot is a scarce man hated feared and scorned but in time when his cause
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:52.440]  succeeds the timid joined him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot break
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:58.040]  your conditioning now get involved wake up and reach out to others you are the
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:03.080]  resistance or just bend over and get ready because the globalist ideology if
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.440]  you're gonna bend over if you're gonna submit if you're gonna get down on your
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.520]  knees like Patrick Henry said to his enemies crouch down and lick the hand

[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:50.240]  info wars store.com now as Alex was talking about in the last segment how
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:55.320]  this is a long-term engineered takeover there's another aspect something you
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:00.040]  should be concerned about and I believe we've been seeing this developing in a
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:05.040]  slow mode but now they're stepping on the accelerator when it comes to robot
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.520]  cars they'll be controlled by the government now you understand most of
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:13.600]  the people who listen to us just how dangerous it is to have gun control do
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:17.520]  you realize how dangerous dangerous it is to have the government control and
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:22.280]  track and tax all of your transportation are you concerned about that you
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:26.040]  should be and you should be concerned about the fact that in spite of the fact
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:30.640]  that these early tests of Google cars in California showed that they had a very
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:35.640]  high accident rate compared to humans had 11 accidents out of six years they
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:42.800]  had another I think it's about 350 some odd accident issues where the driver in
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:46.920]  the car had to take over control of the self-driving car to keep from having an
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:52.840]  accident nevertheless they don't want to have the restriction put on them as the
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.360]  California Department of Transportation said they were going to do they don't
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:58.800]  want to have this restriction of saying you're gonna have a human backup driver
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:03.600]  there as you test these things now the long-term issue with this is not just
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:08.760]  whether or not you would like to have the option of having a drudgery job of
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:13.240]  your daily commute drive you automatically to your office or whatever
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:17.880]  no the reality is is that you're not going to have a choice as I pointed out
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.480]  when I cut that one minute you know is with Obamacare you heard you know if
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:25.080]  you like your insurance you can keep your insurance and with Obama car I'm
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:28.320]  sure that you can keep your car except you're just not going to be able to
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:32.320]  afford the insurance they're gonna drive you out of the car with insurance so
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:36.360]  we're seeing these factors come together Alex has been talking about this a long
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:39.600]  time I've been talking about this since I came to Info Wars the fact that
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:44.400]  they're going to use insurance rates to push away private ownership of
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:49.800]  automobiles and they're going to put sensors in the cars to track and tax all
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:54.400]  of your movement and once they get rid of private cars everybody is going to
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:28:00.200]  have to rely on a few companies perhaps like Uber that are going to be the only
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:03.800]  ones who own cars does that sound like the Trans Pacific transatlantic
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:08.840]  partnership where only a few mega multinational corporations own everything
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:14.080]  and we just pay them rent all the time okay we don't own land we don't own
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:19.480]  cars we don't own homes we just pay the banks we pay the insurance companies we
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:23.120]  pay the car companies in the future for everything that's one of the reasons why
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:27.840]  Detroit is jumping on this you understand it's a lot more profitable to
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:32.360]  rent something to somebody than it is to sell something to somebody when you
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.440]  rent something to somebody they never stop paying you when you sell it to them
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:39.240]  you know you can make some money but that's it no they want to rent stuff to
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:42.520]  people so and they're going to jockey for position with the government let me
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:45.800]  read you what happened yesterday of the troit auto show and of course this is
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:48.960]  something that had been tipped was going to be in the state of the union they
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:52.160]  did not talk about it nevertheless the head of the transportation the
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:58.040]  transportation secretary Anthony Fox went to Detroit and met with the had a
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:02.720]  press conference there with the major automobile manufacturers talking about
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:08.640]  sustainable transportation now when you see the word sustainable used by the
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:13.120]  government you need to take the safety off your gun because they're coming for
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:17.200]  something that you have and they say this is we're going to regulate this at
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:20.400]  the national level just like they wanted to do with GMOs they were concerned
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:24.040]  that GMOs are being shut down by regulation at the state and local
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:27.160]  level people concerned about safety same thing with this so they're going to get
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:30.160]  rid of them the national level they said they're going to have a government
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:35.400]  industry tag team yeah that's exactly right it's called crony capitalism it's
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:41.040]  called making you a surf stay with us we'll be right back the journal salinity
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:48.080]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:50.360]  network
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:55.960]  agent stocks fell sharply after suspected ISIS suicide bombers and gunmen
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:59.120]  attacked Indonesia's capital on Thursday killing at least three and wounding
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:02.720]  several others massive explosions shook downtown Jakarta including a reported
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:06.080]  Bob going off near local UN office another explosion outside of popular
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.360]  shopping mall and several gunmen also exchanged gunfire with police on public
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:12.840]  streets Jakarta stock market plunged the results impacting other Asian stock
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:15.840]  markets are already in freefall following a massive sell-off on Wall Street
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:19.080]  yesterday fueled by concerns over a China's economy overvalued stock and
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:23.160]  low oil prices Japan's Nikkei 225 slid dramatically in early trading and was
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:28.440]  down 2.68% around 474 points near the end of the day China's Hainsein index
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:31.600]  stayed negative territory most of the day while Indonesia's currency crashed

[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.400]  continued to go down as I'm looking at this right now we're just under 500
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:52.160]  points down on the Dow the Dow and the S&P are down just about 3% the Nasdaq's

[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:22.600]  here with the markets well it's what we had forecast the panic is on our last
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:30.400]  broadcast of 2015 on December 30th the trends in the news broadcast was the
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:36.960]  panic of 2016 yes of course I've been on with you and Alex throughout the year
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:41.840]  and in early August we made the forecast that the markets would unravel
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:47.560]  this year and they have there was no Santa Claus rally it's been one decline
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:52.920]  down it was a flat year overall on the Dow but the decline had already begun
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:58.960]  and when you listen to the media first they blame China and then they blame
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:05.360]  oil it's one of our top trends of 2016 and we came out with well over a month
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:11.560]  ago into the new year looking ahead and it's the great recession that's global
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:17.920]  it's a global recession going on that's why commodity prices are falling it's
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:23.360]  not only China it's a lack of demand around the world and it's a very simple
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:31.240]  equation far too few have much too much and far too many have much too little
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:38.200]  we all know about the point zero one percent that controls the world's wealth
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:44.920]  and I'm not making that number up you had 85 people that have more dough than
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:52.360]  half the world's population at 3.25 billion people 85 take a trip here in
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:57.760]  the USA and I was listening to some of your commentaries on how they take more
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:02.880]  of our rights away and we're basically just slaves for the multinationals I
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:08.560]  call it slave land here so look what's happening in slave land here you have a
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:12.640]  gap between the rich and the poor that's wider than it was during the during the
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:21.720]  gilded age you have 400 people worth 2.5 trillion dollars while the middle class
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:28.320]  is now a minority while our real median household income is below
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:33.320]  $19.99 levels so then the people are saying yeah but with those gas prices
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:38.160]  down well you know people could go out and buy more not if everything else is
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:42.120]  going up you mentioned about the Obamacare rip-off where we the people
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:47.280]  are being forced to buy insurance from private companies the merger state and
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:52.600]  corporate powers by the way called fascism yeah they call it tag-teaming
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:59.360]  yeah so now what's going on is that the people don't have the money and it's
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:04.600]  worldwide so that's why you're seeing it's not only oil for example let's go
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:10.000]  back to the Great Depression and we're in one now for all those what is it the
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:16.160]  labor force participation rate down to 1970s levels when women weren't in the
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:21.280]  workforce like they are now and it's still that bad so when you look at the
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:28.280]  the depression that's going on with so many people you can have low prices it's
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:33.360]  called a depression yeah if it doesn't eggs only cost a quarter during the
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:38.200]  depression you still couldn't afford them so you could have low oil prices but
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:44.520]  you have all your other expenses as real wages continue to decline when
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:49.200]  accounting for real inflation what we're going through this is the beginning
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:57.840]  this is the panic of 2016 and I want to make this clear David I in November of
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:04.880]  2007 I took out the domain name the panic of 08 that's how sure I was we
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:10.280]  were so sure about this panic that we named it at the end of the year you're
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:17.920]  going into the new year and this equity market panic has begun here we are
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:22.000]  well that's amazing and as you pointed out when people look at things like the
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.160]  Chinese market and oil those are symptoms of the greater problem which is
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:31.320]  the depression that is underlying all of this how deep do you think this is
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:34.520]  going to go how far do you think this is going to go I mean is there any
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:37.440]  optimism on your part that we're going to come out of this because you talk
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:43.960]  about the concentration of wealth as they have become the only owners of not
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:47.160]  only wealth but they want to be the people who own everything even the
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:51.160]  only ones who own cars okay we're going to have you know the banks literally own
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:56.040]  our homes and we we pay them rent we pay rent in terms of property tax we're
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:39:00.480]  gonna have the same situation with cars with private car ownership disappearing
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:03.360]  as well they want to own everything and once they do are they going to have a
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:07.300]  society where they just have robots provide for their needs and use the
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:12.200]  robots as slaves instead of human slaves that they've got now both billy is both
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:17.920]  and the people there's is such a lack of courage in this country and I'm not
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:21.840]  talking of course I mean there's what you guys are doing what we're doing a
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:26.800]  number of others Peter Schiff is going to be on later Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:31.280]  David Stockman you know Dr. Andrew Napoli a judge Andrew Napoli time there
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:35.680]  a number of us out there but we're in the vast minority most of the people
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:41.440]  clap and applaud to their you know their presidents their prime ministers and
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:46.520]  chancellors yeah so until the people rise to a greater level and stop you know
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:50.760]  understanding to begin to understand they weren't put on this earth to take
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:55.840]  orders from lowlifes then that's the only way we're going to have the change
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:00.560]  and I I mentioned briefly yesterday with Alex you know this is a time not only
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:05.160]  for a third party but a fourth and a fifth I mean it this is watching that
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:09.800]  the presidential reality show last night is an insult to anyone's
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:14.040]  intelligence every time you ask them a question they go into their campaign
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:18.000]  spiel without giving an answer oh yeah that's that's a great tactic that's a
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:23.720]  that's a very deliberate debate tactic to not answer the question and if you go
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:26.280]  on about some other topic they'll come back and say but you didn't answer my
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.680]  question all right I'll answer your question so they get more time that's
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:31.760]  a tactic that these what do you think about the fact as you mentioned
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:38.520]  yesterday you know we've had 20 plus thousand bombs dropped by Obama all
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:42.200]  over the world he can't shed a tear about that but of course Republicans
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:45.960]  don't think that was enough they want even more every time they go to another
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:49.440]  candidate it's like oh I'm gonna be tougher than these other guys gonna be
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:52.680]  tougher than Obama I'm gonna go to war with the Russians I'm gonna do you know
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:58.560]  whatever yeah I get a kick out of my see little Marco Rubio and Teddy Cruz
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:03.560]  for example shooting there and and Christie what a joke I mean you put all
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:07.280]  these three guys in a paper bag they wouldn't be able to fight their way out
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:15.920]  of it and they talk so tough yeah so these little boys of nothing if you put
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:20.080]  them all together you know maybe they have the size of you know Kahone's the
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:26.680]  size of a mothball you know so what I'm saying is this they they can take the
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:32.200]  people to war very easily you've heard me say this before when all else fails
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:38.480]  they take you to war yes and that's is going to be the end game unless we change
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:44.240]  it there is no stopping this economic decline it should have happened it
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:49.240]  should it should it should have happened but it was stopped after the panic of
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:54.560]  08 because of all of the cheap money that they threw into the system with
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:59.960]  quantitative easing a word and a system made up that never happened before and
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:05.880]  zero interest rate policy so now they've run out of tools that's right and of
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:09.520]  course they they did the quantitative either printed all this money and then a
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:13.400]  lot of that great majority of that they didn't even put into the market they
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:16.840]  kept at the banks and paid the banks massive amounts of interest on the
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:19.520]  money that they didn't even put out into the economy if they had put it out we
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:24.720]  probably would have had hyperinflation and the other fact of it is is that the
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:35.240]  wealth created since the panic of 08 95% of it went to the 1% yeah that's a
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:41.520]  fact yeah so what they again this is fascism it's the merger of state and
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:48.440]  corporate powers you go back to our trends journals going back to 2008 when
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:53.760]  Henry Paulson I think was he playing roles in Frankenstein movies now I think
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:43:00.400]  the former CEO of Goldman Sachs and Bush's Treasury Secretary when he gave
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:06.520]  us too big to fail and again in capitalism there's no such thing as too
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:13.360]  big to fail so what happened was our headline was Wall Street hijacked
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:18.440]  Washington it's a take oh yeah they're not only too big to fail they're too big
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:22.920]  to jail I mean this guy El Chapo that we've seen so much press about his
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:29.040]  son Loa cartel had its own private window to launder money at HSBC and of
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:33.840]  course the Obama administration's Justice Department quote unquote refused to
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:38.120]  prosecute them for money laundering saying well it wouldn't serve to to put
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:42.840]  any executives in jail or to pull their charter there and as everybody pointed
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:46.600]  out you're saying then that they're too big to jail that's the kind of corruption
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:50.920]  that we see with this crony capitalism and those were essentially the words of
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:57.040]  the former attorney general Eric Holder who's now back with that white shoe boy
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:02.120]  firm on Wall Street yeah go straight back there that protects the criminals
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:08.040]  and and you mentioned about not doing anything with HSBC how about the six
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:14.840]  banks that were convicted not not charged convicted of felonies for rigging
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:20.760]  the live war rate for rigging the forex markets 5.3 trillion a day the
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:25.640]  interest rates currency markets and not one head roll but for us the little
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:30.600]  people you know the guy just read they're gonna lower that that alcohol level
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:34.600]  to one drink yeah you have one drink and you get in that car we're gonna get
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:40.000]  you don't go over that yellow line you had your bright son here in Austin
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.880]  they've got forced blood draws and you know if you if you resist or you say
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:49.320]  you don't want to they've taken people down strap them to a gurney pulled out
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:54.200]  their blood found they had zero alcohol level but that's the kind of fascist
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:56.760]  tyranny that we're looking at you're talking about yeah they're gonna lower
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:00.320]  it to one drink and that's something that's coming from the feds they want
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:03.920]  to do that nationwide I mean this is worse than the 55 mile an hour speed
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:07.640]  lemon I'm somebody who doesn't drink and it and it bothers me because I know
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:12.600]  that I'm still possibly gonna get pulled over and have a blood drawn without my
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:18.080]  consent exactly so that's what I'm saying it's all tied together so going back
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:23.760]  to the economy I mean what what what's the Dow doing now as we speak you know
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:32.120]  right now the Dow is down 2.72 percent 445 points 445 points and what's the
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:37.760]  what's the NASDAQ at NASDAQ is down 3.2 percent 147 points and what's it at
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:47.680]  sorry SNP is down two and a half what's it at is it 4,000 what 4468 4468 the
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:58.680]  NASDAQ was at 5,000 in 2000 and here we are 15 years later 16 years later and
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:03.600]  look where it's at yeah yeah and then you got people like Chris Christie saying
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:08.200]  to the baby boomers who are losing their 401ks to all of this manipulation
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:12.720]  saying well you know we're going to take away the the money that we promised we
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:16.960]  would pay you in this Ponzi scheme called Social Security oh yeah as they get
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:21.360]  all their benefits yeah yeah yeah so what we're looking at when we're looking
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:27.040]  at this market decline this is unprecedented the decline in oil prices
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:33.000]  now that we're seeing we're almost down one was like 20% in a new year 20% hmm
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:40.600]  so what we're looking at is the worst oil collapse since OPEC really became OPEC
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:45.840]  1970s now we have to put it together into where we're going when I said when
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:51.280]  all else fails they take you to war look what's going on in the Middle East these
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:58.000]  dictatorships that they like to call the Kings and the Amirs these countries are
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.840]  in deep trouble they shut the people up during the Arab Spring by dumping more
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:08.920]  dough into their coffins over there and now they're pulling it back Saudi Arabia
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:14.320]  remember now we're looking at oil at around $29 a barrel Saudi Arabia needs
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:21.040]  $100 a barrel just to break even yeah you're gonna see destabilization as they
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:26.080]  keep spreading war in Yemen and as they have in in Syria now you're looking at
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:30.640]  Turkey exploding as that economy is crashing along with the Turkish leader
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:37.000]  then come back to the states then go back to oil go to all the states and all
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:42.920]  the cities and all the counties that became enriched with the shale boom go
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:47.200]  back to transportation what happened with the railroads and all of these cars
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:53.160]  that were being put online I'm saying this because of all the debt that has
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:48:00.160]  been taken on to fuel the boom when you put in the mining sector and the energy
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:06.480]  sector you're looking at about 20% of the junk bonds in the United States in
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:12.240]  those sectors and now those bonds for those companies that have gone bankrupt
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:17.840]  are selling for pennies on the dollar with more to come wow and of course when
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:21.280]  you look at Saudi Arabia as you pointed out there in Yemen kind of a
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:25.760]  Vietnam war that where they're attacking in that country of course our press is
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:29.840]  very silent about that they're also not talking about the fact that all these
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:34.840]  people that they executed right after the new year began I think they waited so
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:39.240]  they wouldn't set a new Guinness record for beheadings but all these people that
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:43.000]  they executed especially this one particular guy that has created a massive
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.240]  sectarian division in the country so they've got a lot of political turmoil
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:50.360]  within their country they're fighting a Vietnam type of war and of course there
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:55.120]  are big buddies with the petrodollar that Nixon and Kissinger put in that's
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:49:00.440]  really what's a key part of what's been propping up our fiat currency throughout
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:04.280]  the decades along with the Federal Reserve they've got the Saudis coming in
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:08.520]  with a petrodollar that's all about to collapse as well isn't it it is and when
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:12.720]  you you made a good point too about the revolution going on and there and the
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:18.000]  social unrest in Saudi Arabia after they executed of course they're Shia cleric
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:24.120]  and where the most of the she is live on the eastern end of Saudi Arabia where is
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:29.560]  most of the oil right over there oh and by the way the Yemenis that they're
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:34.960]  slaughtering probably up to over 10,000 about now destroyed the most you know the
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:41.160]  poorest country in in in the Middle East and they've done nothing to warrant
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:47.000]  the attack which by the way was launched from Washington DC by the Saudi
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:54.240]  ambassador on March 26th 2015 and the United States is part and parcel to it
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:59.600]  oh yeah mentioning that also because you have about four million Yemenis living
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:05.440]  in Saudi Arabia and a lot of them work in the oil fields so what you can see a
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:12.600]  major catastrophe happening with Saudi oil that may temporarily boost up the
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:19.760]  price the Middle East has exploded it's not about to explode it has exploded it
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:25.360]  just hasn't made the news just as the financial crisis that we're going through

[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:07.040]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're talking to
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:14.120]  Gerald Salenty and of course we hear this panel of the British there of course
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:19.560]  that was that was president Jackson who stood up to the Federal Reserve didn't
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:28.200]  he Gerald yes he did and he also said one man of courage makes a majority there
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:31.000]  you go yeah and of course it wasn't the Federal Reserve I understand it was the
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.040]  National Bank at the time and yeah and they said yeah we're gonna have the
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:36.920]  National Bank he said well the Supreme Court made the ruling let's see them
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:42.320]  enforce it was a we've been talking about the economy what do people do right
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:46.240]  now with the what what is your advice to them of course you want to have
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:51.080]  preservation of capital what what can somebody do if they got a 401k and they
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:55.680]  see the stock market crashing because they have forced people to put their IRAs
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:00.640]  into Wall Street investments there what can they do well of course I can't give
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:05.200]  financial advice so only speaking for myself you're seeing a lot of people
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:11.680]  leaving it in cash and I also you know again thinking for myself you know GC
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:18.520]  three G's guns gold and a getaway plan so gold is really to me when you're
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:22.920]  looking at everything going down gold is going up because it's the ultimate
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:27.560]  safe haven commodity as all the other ones are going down I want to make this
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:33.480]  really clear with the conditions going on now in the equity markets and the
[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:39.240]  reality of a major crash happening coupling on that if there is quote a
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:45.920]  terror strike false flag or real you may not be able to get your money because
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:53.040]  they'll call quote a bank holiday that lovely language a holiday you can't get
[01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:58.360]  your money and they'll devalue it and they're devaluing currencies around the
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:03.560]  world you're looking at you just saw it happen in Argentina people say should I
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:08.400]  own gold hey how about if you live up there in Canada not so far away what
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:13.720]  you're loony at oh it's only down what the 70 cents against a dollar would you
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:20.240]  rather own gold so what I'm saying David is prepare for the worst is my motto if
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:26.360]  the worst doesn't happen you've lose nothing if the worst happens you can
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:29.920]  lose everything if you didn't prepare for it so I believe there are
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:37.840]  possibilities of bank closures if the panic goes in a direction where it's
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:44.480]  heading and continues if on top of that there's quote a terrorist strike false
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:50.840]  flag or real because I say that without being a conspiracy theorist because
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:56.080]  after all remember the main hey how about that Gulf of Tonkin incident that
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:57:01.120]  never happened I'll tell you what David that's an arm who's saying has weapons a
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:06.040]  mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda yeah that's right that's a real fear
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:09.320]  that's a real fear that they're going to ramp this up and of course they have
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:13.800]  laid the the groundwork for conflicts all over the country and before we go to
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:17.040]  break I want to tell you real quickly in terms of talking about preparing one of
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:20.080]  the things that you can do is to make sure that you've got food and of course

[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:11.760]  and I want to get a little bit of his take on what he thinks is going to
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:15.760]  happen in the future with the Trans Pacific Partnership and these other
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:20.440]  quote-unquote trade deals that are far more than trade deals that are coming
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:24.280]  up and also his comments about what happened last night with the debates
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:28.680]  where he thinks this is going to lead with politics is it going to help us at

[01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:49.600]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:59:49.600 --> 02:00:03.560]  they took my saddle and here's to broke my leg in the Santa Fe lost my wife and a
[02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:11.880]  girlfriend somewhere along the way in defense of human liberty Alex Jones
[02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:21.120]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David and I we're talking to Gerald
[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:25.240]  Salenty in this segment and we're going to be talking to Peter shift in the next
[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:28.840]  segment of course if you're following the economic news you can see that there's
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:35.040]  been a huge decline in all the American indexes here and of course that's going
[02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:39.040]  on across the world as we've been talking to Gerald Salenty we're going
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:44.560]  into a deeper depression in his opinion I agree because the situations that we're
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:48.280]  seeing in this market and the Chinese market and the oil market are all
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:54.080]  symptoms of a deeper problem and that is an economic slowdown that is global
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:57.040]  that's something we should all be very concerned about Gerald as we're looking
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:02.160]  at the debate last night and as you said to Alex Jones yesterday it really is
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:07.680]  just a celebrity show I call it a celebrity big brother I couldn't really
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:11.440]  see that much difference between the guys who were on the stage last night I
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:16.960]  mean is there any hope in terms of getting any of these people elected that
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:20.160]  it's going to make any difference whatsoever you talked about having a
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:24.800]  third-party option out there but of course they're going to shut that down
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:29.320]  in terms of people who were I've seen many times working with a libertarian
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:32.640]  party they get on the ballot in 50 states and they're not allowed on the
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:36.720]  debate stage or we do it at the state level you can get on the ballot at
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:40.200]  the state level they still won't let you on the debate stage do we have any hope
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:44.960]  of getting a third or fourth or fifth party well if Spain could do it if
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:49.120]  Italy could do it if they could do it in other countries why can't we and it
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:55.280]  has to be a unified effort and it never before in my career and one of the ways
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:02:01.600]  I made my name in my book trends trend tracking back in the late 80s far better
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:05.920]  than megatrends time magazine I predicted there'd be a new third party in
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:12.840]  1992 and I mentioned for some strange reasons someone like Ross Perot the
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:18.400]  conditions exist today better than they were back then and what Donald Trump has
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:23.920]  done is to show what really a freak show it is as I pointed out you know this was
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:31.840]  the cover of our magazine the trends journal back in the spring of 2015
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:37.800]  cowards liars freaks and fools welcome to the presidential reality show and
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:44.480]  that was before Trump got into it so what he's done is he exposed really as
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:48.840]  the term that he uses they totally agree with that the people running the
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:54.840]  government are incompetent and stupid so if you have a new leader of the
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:03:01.280]  incompetence and stupids it's not going to make a difference it has to be a whole
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:07.280]  new way and it's something we do at the ground at the from the ground up I mean
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:10.560]  I look at things like great nullification I look at state nullification
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:16.280]  everybody gets mesmerized like you know a cobra with a snake charmer about the
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:20.360]  presidential elections and they completely ignore what's going on locally
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:23.840]  and it's harder to track that because we all talk about what's going on at the
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:27.080]  national level nobody really talks about what's going on local of you have to
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:30.760]  really dig to get that information well there's a reason for that because of the
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:34.520]  consolidation of the media yeah you have these private equity groups that have
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:39.000]  bought up all the newspapers matter of fact have centralized locations right
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:42.800]  where you are over there where they aggregate the news and the same stuff
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:47.240]  goes to the newspapers that they own all over the world you only have copy
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:51.920]  editors anymore in most of these smaller newspapers you're not getting local
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:57.120]  reporting anymore those days are gone so it's up to the people again if they
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:01.520]  could do it in Spain if they could do it in Italy we could do it here the
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:05.960]  opportunity exists now more than ever yeah I just want to backtrack on one
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:09.960]  thing and listening to what you were saying about storing up on food and
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:15.600]  going back to what's going on with the economy and again it's a crisis mode but
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:20.080]  the people are detached from it because a lot of people aren't in the markets like
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:27.360]  they used to be it's only now for the very rich yeah to prepare and prevail and
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:33.440]  prosper it's having your food supply absolutely having a getaway plan it's
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:37.280]  having your hand on your money and it's understanding where the trends are going
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:40.920]  and if you want to keep up with that you can go to trends research calm we've
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:45.360]  been talking to Gerald Salenty publisher of trends journal thank you so much

[02:04:55.440 --> 02:05:00.960]  advocate for women's rights but there is a shocking side to her story that has
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:05.680]  been carefully covered up until now the notion that Hillary has somehow been an
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:10.440]  advocate for women no bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them
[02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:16.040]  psychologically that's GOP presidential consultant Roger Stone talking about his
[02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:21.160]  book the Clintons war on women from the Alex Jones show where Roger Stone says
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:25.680]  Hillary Clinton played a huge role in the cover-up of her husband's rape
[02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:30.160]  allegations Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up now on the campaign trail
[02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:35.840]  Hillary refuses to answer any questions about the women involved in Bill
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:40.840]  Clinton's sex scandals Donald Trump appearing on Fox News Sunday over the
[02:05:40.840 --> 02:05:44.560]  weekend said that some of the women involved in Bill Clinton's sexual

[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:24.120]  Irwin Schiff Mr. Schiff I've seen your father many times at the Libertarian

[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:43.520]  EuroPak.com what do you make of what's going on in the markets we've seen them
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:48.160]  open up down a great deal today and dropping even more every day seems to
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:52.400]  be bringing even worse economic news well this is exactly what I've been
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:56.640]  saying was gonna happen I've been coming on Alex's Jones now regularly for the
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:00.320]  last several months and this is exactly what I said was going to happen I said
[02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:04.160]  that the if the Federal Reserve raised interest rates that the market would
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:06.960]  tank that was one of the reasons I thought they wouldn't raise rates because
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:10.200]  I thought they could figure this out but apparently I gave them too much credit
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:15.040]  so they raised interest rates and the markets are tanking also the economic
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:19.280]  news is horrific I mean if you look at the data that came out today we are
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:24.080]  clearly in a recession now the question is how long have we been in recession
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:27.600]  did it start a few months ago or is it just starting this month but we're
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:31.840]  back in a recession and Clintus right it is gonna be a horrible recession I
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:34.960]  think it's gonna be worse than the great recession so it will be a greater
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:39.740]  recession and it's because of everything the Federal Reserve did to mitigate the
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:44.360]  damage back then they just postponed the pain to a later date unfortunately this
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:48.240]  is the later date and the pain is about to begin and it's very ironic because you
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:51.920]  had President Obama just give his ridiculous State of the Union address
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:55.760]  where he said everything is fantastic you know it's the greatest economy ever
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:59.840]  and I think he gave the same marching orders to Janet Yellen and her cohorts
[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:03.440]  at the Federal Reserve because they keep trying to pretend that everything is
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:06.920]  great too because they don't want to admit they were wrong to raise rates of
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:10.520]  course the real mistake was cutting them in the first place because all they did
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:14.440]  is inflate a gigantic bubble and now they've pricked it they kept they cut
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:17.560]  them and then they left it down for a very long time and of course as we saw
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:22.160]  with Alan Greenspan right rolling up to the 2008 bubble that they created and
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:25.960]  then burst I mean he he continued to cut interest rates over a long period of
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:30.480]  time and then he continued to raise interest rates until they burst that
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:34.960]  bubble but now it appears that it only took one the very first interest rate
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:38.480]  and now it's it's busting that bubble isn't it that's because it's a much
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:41.720]  bigger bubble you know the bigger the bubble the smaller the pin you need to
[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:46.280]  pop it and and so the question is when is the Fed going to acknowledge the
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:48.880]  weakness in the economy and what are they going to blame it on because of
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:53.640]  course they have to pretend that some external factor is what caused it and
[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:57.080]  there's no way anybody could have possibly predicted it even though it was
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:00.560]  one of the easiest things to predict I think this is even easier than the
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:04.200]  financial crisis which I also predicted and which the Fed was oblivious to
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:08.760]  remember even after the real estate bubble burst they still didn't recognize
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:12.880]  the problem they still even see it was a bubble so they don't know until all the
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:16.200]  wheels have fallen off the bus and and and right now that's exactly what's
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:21.200]  happening they're still in denial but I think that sometime in the next few
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:26.080]  months they're gonna have to launch QE for they're gonna have to reduce that
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:30.040]  rate hike they're gonna go back down to zero and I think Congress is also gonna
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:35.160]  come out with a huge stimulus bill that's gonna include tax cuts for the
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:39.280]  middle class and massive increases in government spending everybody's gonna
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:43.320]  vote for it because everybody's gonna be afraid to oppose it and it's gonna send
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:47.200]  a budget deficit skyrocketing and it's gonna make it more ironic that you know
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:52.800]  President Obama tried to claim credit for reducing the deficit the deficit in
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:57.560]  his last year of office could easily be bigger than the trillion dollar deficit
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:01.560]  in his first year and of course the national debt doubled under President
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:06.840]  Obama so he is the biggest deficit spender of all time in fact he will be a
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:10.480]  bigger deficit spender than every president that preceded him from George
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:15.360]  Washington to George Bush well and of course one of the things that was also
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:20.200]  I think pretty predictable was the fact that they would not choose to audit the
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:25.480]  Fed because that is really at the center of all this but we're not even allowed
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:29.600]  to look behind the curtain with all of this that that's to me the most amazing
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:33.520]  thing and of course the thing that they never talk about in the debates unless
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:37.600]  you've got Rand Paul there and of course he wasn't there last night so the Fed
[02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:40.680]  wasn't there they're all talking about how they're going to have different
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:45.240]  levels you know where their brackets are for income taxes what their percentages
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:48.600]  are going to be where they're gonna be flat or progressive or whatever that's
[02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:53.480]  just really rearranging the chairs on the Titanic isn't it yeah and for nobody
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:57.000]  wants to look behind the curtain there at the Fed it's like you know if you're
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:00.040]  eating at a fast food restaurant you don't want to go into the kitchen and
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:04.200]  actually see what they're making and you know and especially since they're
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:07.720]  about to have to pull out the stops because they're gonna have to do even
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:12.680]  more crazy stuff this time because the problem is much bigger see everybody
[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:16.960]  wants to pretend that the Fed solved our problem they didn't solve anything the
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:21.240]  market would have solved our problems had the Fed allowed it but the Fed didn't
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:25.080]  the Fed prevented the market from working and we had seven years of zero
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:28.840]  percent interest rates and three rounds of quantitative easing and as a result the
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:33.880]  economy today is far more screwed up than it was you know seven years ago the
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:37.920]  only difference is we still have all the low-paying service sector jobs that our
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:42.880]  college graduates have been able to land during this Obama recovery but the
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:46.480]  jobs are going to start to go away quickly right there the service sector
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:51.040]  is going to be hemorrhaging jobs you know it was a wealth effect and the false
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:56.120]  perception of a recovery that created these jobs but now that that phony wealth
[02:15:56.120 --> 02:16:01.880]  is evaporating and the perception is being replaced by reality a lot of
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:05.280]  these jobs are going to be lost in fact I think we're maybe a few months away
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:10.680]  from some huge negative numbers in the non-farm payroll a big spike up in
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:15.040]  unemployment and then even when the Fed launches QE for and cuts race to zero
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:19.080]  it's not going to you know turn the time I think the unemployment rate is going
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:22.520]  to be rising for years I think we're headed back above ten percent
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:26.160]  officially and who knows where we'll be unofficially with all the people that
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:30.480]  just leave the labor market but we've seen the best days as far as the low
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:33.920]  unemployment rate and the job creation and of course everybody is trying to
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:37.560]  hang their hat on this one data point they're saying oh we can ignore all the
[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:42.200]  bad news because look the jobs the jobs market is strong no you have to ignore
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:45.800]  the jobs market and pay attention to all the other news because the other news
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:49.560]  is forward-looking the jobs news is backward-looking the jobs are going to
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:53.800]  follow the other data if corporate profits are collapsing if retail sales
[02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:57.960]  are collapsing if the stock market is in a bear market all these companies are
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:00.960]  gonna be cutting job look Walmart today just announced they're gonna have to
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:04.200]  shut down a bunch of stores you know and the reason that Walmart wants to shut
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:07.480]  down stores is because they need to lower their labor costs because they were
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:10.920]  just dumb enough to raise everybody's wages in order to placate the Obama
[02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:13.920]  administration who said that their wages weren't high enough so now they're
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:19.120]  gonna give out pink slips and of course part of the employment impediment in
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:23.280]  terms of getting more people jobs in terms of the labor cost is Obamacare
[02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:27.680]  and they use that they spend these unemployment numbers by by playing
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:33.360]  games as to the definition of who's unemployed and then counting a part-time
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:38.400]  jobs with this and people you know dumbing this down to 30 hours a week as
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:42.360]  a full-time job so that a lot of people at the bottom of the service sector have
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:46.960]  to get two jobs to make ends meet I mean it's just absolutely incredible what
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:49.720]  they're doing and if you look at what's going on in terms of not only
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:54.800]  exporting jobs but importing workers you see that all the job growth since the
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:59.320]  since 2008 has pretty much come to immigrants coming in 17% of the labor
[02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:04.080]  force now is immigrant labor force you know it it's the ultimate in irony and
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:08.960]  that president Obama passes a law that destroys full-time jobs because in order
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:13.160]  to get out from under Obamacare employers have to limit the number of full-time
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:17.560]  jobs that they that they have and so now people lose their full-time jobs but
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:22.280]  now those full-time workers are replaced by part-time workers so now somebody
[02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:26.720]  used to have one really good job and now they have two crappy jobs where both
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:31.160]  those jobs still pay less than the one job he used to have but now Obama gets
[02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:35.200]  credit for the extra job yeah because all they do in the jobs numbers is count
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:40.320]  the numbers so two lousy jobs is better than one good job as far as Obama's
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:44.720]  concern but not as far as the guy who has to work these two lousy jobs for low
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:49.520]  pay so he gets to destroy jobs and to and claim credit for creating jobs at the
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:57.640]  same time it's kind of like common core economics isn't it Peter and of course
[02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:03.680]  in terms of the what the banks did in terms of being bailed out we just see
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:08.440]  Goldman Sachs being assessed a five billion dollar fine here we are seven
[02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:11.960]  years after the fact they're still handing out some fines I guess we're
[02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:15.640]  supposed to feel better that they're going to give us a little bit of mercy
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:20.360]  and not charge taxes to the people whose houses they've repossessed to no
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:24.160]  of us instead of finding them now we should just let them go bankrupt back
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:28.040]  then you know we bailed them out and now we're asking for some of the bailout
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:31.720]  money back but you know what all these big banks and I'm getting was looking at
[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:35.440]  the brokerage stocks Goldman Sachs today is at a 52 week load the stocks you know
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:39.800]  dropped I don't know what 25 30% from its high and it's gonna keep falling and
[02:19:39.800 --> 02:19:43.040]  all the big banks are in trouble right here I think they're gonna need fresh
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:46.600]  rounds bailout money so a lot of that little bit of a little bit of shading
[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:52.840]  for you there right we're gonna be right back with Peter chef stay with us as if
[02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:57.280]  chlorine in our water weren't bad enough now they're adding ammonia it's true

[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:12.520]  we're going to be talking to Leanne McAdoo and Jakari Jackson we're going to
[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:17.040]  do a panel discussion going over the debate last night and what has happened
[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:22.560]  and the follow-up to that we're talking to Peter Schiff right now he's with you
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:26.640]  can find him at Euro PAC comm this is a website of course a frequent guest here
[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:30.960]  with Alex and on many financial TV shows as we're looking at the financial
[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:36.080]  situation we're down today between two and a half and three and a half percent
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:40.960]  on most of these indices and it has been down all day that appears to be the new
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:46.800]  normal for 2016 this segment Peter I'd like to talk to you about the strength of
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:50.280]  the dollar I mean we've we've we're talking to Gerald Salenty about the
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:54.400]  instability in Saudi Arabia of course the petro dollar has been a big part of
[02:24:54.400 --> 02:25:00.000]  the the reserve currency the bubble that they created if you will and in a way
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:04.440]  with the petro dollar when they took us off the gold standard and now they the
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:08.320]  key the linchpin to that of course is Saudi Arabia they've got a Vietnam like
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:14.120]  war going on in Yemen they have internal unrest especially after all these
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:17.800]  executions at the beginning of the year so there's a lot of instability there
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:22.760]  what do you think about the strength of the dollar well it can't last and first
[02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:26.520]  of all as strong as the dollars been recently the yen and the euro are
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:30.320]  actually stronger and you know the Swiss franc which is currency I like better
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:36.680]  than than those but what's driving the dollar is the false perception that the
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:41.560]  US economy is still strong that it's going to keep growing without recession
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:45.480]  and that the Fed is going to follow through with all the rate hikes that it's
[02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:49.040]  been signaling that it's going to deliver and I think this is a complete
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:55.160]  fantasy I don't know why it's taking so many people so long to figure out that
[02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:59.440]  they've been wrong but you know this has happened in the past when the dot-com
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:04.400]  bubble first burst the initial reaction on Wall Street was okay it's no big deal
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:08.640]  it's confirmed it's contained to technology and dot-coms and internet
[02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:12.000]  stocks it's not going to affect the overall market and it's not going to
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.600]  affect the economy well they were wrong on both counts because the overall market
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:19.840]  ended up going down by about 50% and we went into a recession and the Nasdaq of
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:26.160]  course went down 80% same thing happened in 2007 2008 when the subprime market
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:30.720]  blew up nobody was concerned nobody at the Fed was worried it was contained to
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:35.160]  subprime they told us and then even after it was obviously not contained when
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:38.160]  there were problems in the entire housing market then they said well it's
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:41.440]  just housing that's just one part of the economy the rest of the economy is
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:44.800]  going to be fine the markets are going to be fine and then it all blew up in the
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:49.680]  financial crisis of 2008 and the great recession so people have a history of
[02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:54.600]  ignoring the obvious you know even at the point where it's you know flashing like
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:59.360]  a neon sign so I've been I've been warning about these problems now for
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:04.400]  years and now right there they're obvious they're here everything I've been
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:08.840]  saying was gonna happen is playing out in bold in technicolor right before the
[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:12.560]  eyes of people who have been oblivious and now they still can't even see it but
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:15.680]  you know they're going to at some point right the market's not going to stop
[02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:20.320]  falling the economic data is not going to improve and ultimately the one lone
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:23.880]  piece of good news that they think they have is going to roll over to and that's
[02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:27.360]  the job numbers and people have to be prepared because the dollar is going to
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:31.440]  break it's going to be a vicious decline when it happens and gold's going to go
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:34.920]  the other way what's been restraining gold has been the appeal of the dollar
[02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:37.760]  but when people realize they bought a bill of goods when they were buying the
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:40.680]  dollar they're going to rush to buy gold and you know you guys mentioned all
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:43.760]  these specials that you're having over at Alex Jones and we've been having a
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:47.760]  special this week at my gold company at shift gold and we're selling maple leaves
[02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:54.760]  one-out maple leaves for as low as $33 over spot per coin which that
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:57.640]  includes whatever our markup is and that's about the cheapest price you're
[02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:01.920]  going to find anywhere I think we've ever sold them that cheaply over spot and so
[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:05.240]  I'm not sure how many we have left because we we bought a bunch of women you
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:10.560]  know but if look this could be the last chance to buy gold under 1100 you know
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:14.480]  because when people figure this out there's a lot of people that are short
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:17.920]  gold that have to cover a lot of people that haven't been buying that are on the
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:21.480]  sidelines are going to try to buy it once so this is going to be the big trade
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:25.480]  I mean this the big short last time was subprime the big short now is the
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:30.080]  dollar and the way you play that is to be long gold and you know the best way to
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:34.080]  do that is with with real physical bullion again I love the Canadian maple
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:38.520]  leave it's a great coin on and if you can get it for $33 over spot with spot
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:42.480]  below 1100 I mean you do it you're talking about yeah you're talking about
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:49.640]  Obama essentially is the chief person who is ignoring reality and we saw this
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:53.680]  with the State of the Union address the other night how he's the only one yeah
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:56.920]  I know but he's basically putting that narrative out people are buying into that
[02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:01.680]  if the Federal Reserve you believe the Federal Reserve's first interest rate
[02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:06.320]  increases is the pin that has burst this bubble if they just ignore continue to
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:11.400]  ignore reality and continue to do interest rate increases as we saw Alan
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:14.800]  Greenspan do he did a series of increases what do you think is going to
[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:18.080]  happen to that and we're just about well you got about 20 seconds well I don't
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:20.920]  think they're gonna get that far because they're not supposedly gonna raise
[02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:24.560]  interest rates until maybe March or April but by then it might be obvious to
[02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:27.600]  everybody including the members of the Fed that we're in a recession and how
[02:29:27.600 --> 02:29:30.440]  can they raise interest rates at a recession when they normally want to
[02:29:30.440 --> 02:29:35.200]  stimulate the economy not to date it you know so this economy is so much weaker
[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:38.920]  the problems are so much bigger we don't have the luxury of all those

[02:33:24.920 --> 02:33:28.320]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and joining me in this
[02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:33.160]  segment are Leanne McAdoo and Jakari Jackson of course we had a live coverage
[02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:36.760]  of the debate last night as it was happening we had live commentary and
[02:33:36.760 --> 02:33:42.520]  analysis and now we're going to do some post-mortem of what happened in the in
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:47.240]  the aftermath of this and I think it's I think the real takeaway of this and the
[02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:52.200]  hopeful thing is that we've seen now not just Donald Trump break free of the
[02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:57.040]  mainstream media control but we've also seen Rand Paul do the same thing I
[02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:00.720]  think it was a very smart move I think it worked out very well for him last night
[02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:05.800]  he did a periscope took questions on periscope as the debate was going and
[02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:09.800]  some very interesting questions I think that came up certainly much more
[02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:14.640]  interesting I think than what was going on on the Fox debate absolutely yeah
[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:20.480]  yeah so that's that's a positive sign there we need to find a way to get
[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:23.080]  around the mainstream media's control and certainly there have been a lot of
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:28.320]  articles recently about how the super PACs really don't have as much power and
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:33.120]  influence as they did because the millions and tens of millions of dollars
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:36.240]  that are being spent on television advertising really have not been
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:41.960]  effective especially when you look at these Jeb Bush commercials we had one
[02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:46.640]  that we didn't play last night we had to play it coming up the one with Jeb
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:51.880]  Bush Jeb Bush coming after Marco Rubio playing these boots are made for walking
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:57.320]  making fun of him because he's shorter than Jeb I mean this is beyond
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:00.840]  yeah we didn't see this kind of stuff when people running for class president
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:04.720]  in high school they didn't get this petty Napoleon was pretty short too I
[02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:10.120]  hear exactly exactly but of course Jeb is tall and he still has Napoleon
[02:35:10.120 --> 02:35:14.640]  complex right so go figure right he may be tall but his pole numbers are pretty
[02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:21.440]  short right he needs to get some some lift shoes to put underneath his pole
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:26.320]  number but one of the things that I think came out of this I talked about
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:31.560]  this at great length in the first hour was the issue about natural born
[02:35:31.560 --> 02:35:35.560]  citizens and of course the bigger issue of this is are we going to take the
[02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:39.760]  Constitution in an originalist interpretation or are we going to have
[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:45.160]  a living Constitution where we just redefine it as we wish okay and and when
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:49.160]  you do that you have basically cut yourself loose from the rule of law and
[02:35:49.160 --> 02:35:51.960]  we've done that in this country and I think that's one of the things that is
[02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:55.600]  really scary people in America if they see something they don't like if they
[02:35:55.600 --> 02:35:59.560]  don't like drugs they just say well we're going to ignore the Constitution and
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:02.120]  we're going to give the federal government the ability to prohibit
[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:05.680]  anything that they want we're going to let them seize property without even
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:09.040]  charging people the crime we're going to let them lock people up for ridiculous
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:13.800]  amounts of time now we got the most number of people incarcerated and so
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:17.040]  they just say well we that we do that because we don't like drugs and now the
[02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:19.880]  left wants to do that because they don't like guns they're gonna say well we're
[02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:24.600]  gonna let the president just ignore the Constitution that explicitly protects
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:28.560]  it and we looked at Lawrence tribe talking about natural born citizen he
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:31.200]  goes yeah it's kind of like militia you know we've got a different definition of
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:34.880]  militia now than we did back then it's like no I think it's important that we
[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:39.520]  understand that militia is everybody okay it's not the National Guard and if we
[02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:43.040]  do things like throw away these terms that were very well understood I mean
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:47.440]  national natural born citizen was not defined in the Constitution just like
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:51.760]  militia was not defined in the Constitution because everybody there knew
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:56.520]  what it was and there's ample information for us to understand what they
[02:36:56.520 --> 02:36:59.920]  meant by it and we need to understand that there were principles behind that
[02:36:59.920 --> 02:37:03.520]  they had a reason for saying that the militia was everybody in the country
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:07.640]  because they had seen over and over again how a standing army could be used
[02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:11.440]  to subjugate a population so they were very concerned about that they had seen
[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:15.720]  as Alex Jones pointed out how you could have these infiltrators come into a
[02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:18.600]  country and take it over from a foreign country so they were very concerned
[02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:21.520]  about that as well and we should be as well right well and it's that's why it's
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:24.960]  so important to make sure we have a clear understanding of what they meant
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:30.000]  because depending on the climate of what the world situation is going on you're
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:33.760]  gonna have people coming in trying to reinterpret what they meant so that they
[02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:37.040]  can push their own agenda and that's why it's so important to not come in and
[02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:41.840]  try and reinterpret what the Constitution yeah actually stands for and
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:45.080]  what it's stating because you know you're always gonna have these nefarious
[02:37:45.080 --> 02:37:49.080]  actors coming in and I think it's important that if your message is I'm
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:54.200]  going to have a strict interpretation of the original text and the original
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:37:57.760]  meaning that you don't make an exception for yourself and that's the bigger
[02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:02.000]  story as well with what happened with the New York Times and nobody went the
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:07.640]  New York Times story about Ted Cruz and the incomplete reporting on his
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:11.760]  federal election campaign okay what he was doing was presenting this as his own
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:15.800]  personal savings at the same time attacking Wall Street attacking Goldman
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:21.600]  Sachs specifically and taking money secretly from them and not reporting it
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:26.480]  on the federal election campaign and so it goes to the the hypocrisy of this
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:29.680]  message that's why it's a big story it isn't a big story because they didn't
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:33.120]  file a piece of paperwork yeah that's what his supporters will look at this
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:37.800]  and say but the bigger story is the fact that you know he has this special
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:42.200]  relationship I mean do you get a million dollar loan from Goldman Sachs well if I
[02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:45.840]  did I wouldn't forget about it but as we're talking about the Constitution we
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:49.320]  have all these guys who want to give us their interpretation of Constitution you
[02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:52.800]  know we see well there's President Obama or Ted Cruz or anybody else you know I
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:56.280]  say the Constitution I understand what's in the Constitution but then they nit
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:00.760]  pick this and that and as you said they they go out to certain things that they
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:04.160]  like or they don't like and they try to accentuate those things and these like
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:07.600]  you said turn it into a living document where they can manipulate it wherever
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:12.400]  they see fit and I'm so I'm not not content to cruise a holy here but you
[02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:15.600]  know my issue with him is more of less of the Goldman Sachs connection that
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:19.000]  you're alluding to along with I believe Kurt Nimmels been talking about it for
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  quite some time yeah right the things he has going on there well look at this
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:27.520]  Reuters article one of the things that they point out is after taking office
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:31.720]  and in March he says Goldman is one of the biggest banks on Wall Street and my
[02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:35.760]  criticism with Washington is that they engage in crony capitalism he said the
[02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:39.000]  Dodd-Frank act on banking reform he continued was sold to the American
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:43.040]  people as stopping too big to fail what happened the banks have big banks have
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:47.040]  gotten bigger Goldman has gotten bigger and the point is this he's built his
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:50.840]  campaign they say on the idea that the little guy has gotten a raw deal because
[02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:55.040]  the Washington cartel as he puts it has worked solely for the interests of big
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:39:57.840]  business in Wall Street this was a substance of a speech he made a
[02:39:57.840 --> 02:40:02.560]  conservative heritage foundation in June entitled the people versus the
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:07.640]  Washington cartel so when he runs on the fact that he's a populist with the
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:11.920]  people not part of Wall Street not part of this insider group and his wife is a
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:17.400]  managing partner right of Goldman Sachs and he wants to hide the fact that he
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:21.520]  gets a quarter of a million dollars from these two bank loans one of them from
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:26.360]  Goldman Sachs the other one from let's see which bank was it here it was city
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:31.960]  group okay that funds his Senate campaign so there's that hypocrisy there's the
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:35.000]  hypocrisy that if he's going to say that he's qualified if he's gonna defend it
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:38.480]  you don't defend it by saying well then that's gonna mean that Marco Rubio can't
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:42.480]  run and you don't lie about the fact that Donald Trump wouldn't be qualified
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:46.360]  because again his mother was an American citizen when he was born that's the
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:50.880]  difference and he was born in the United States Ted Cruz wasn't so forth and so
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:54.400]  yeah well he deflects away from himself by pointing the finger at everybody else
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:59.040]  he needs to give us a definition so okay fine you're a constitutional lawyer give
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:04.440]  us a constitutional explanation as to how you are a natural born citizen when
[02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:08.800]  your only connection is your mother who was living in Canada at the time and
[02:41:08.800 --> 02:41:12.440]  there's suspicion that she was registered as a voter in Canada so did
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:16.160]  she become a citizen we don't know there's still suspicion about that but how
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:20.280]  does that fit under the original definition of natural born citizen
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:25.000]  that's the real issue here just like this issue with with Goldman Sachs right
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:28.640]  is it is quite literally in bed with him and Trump called him out on that and he
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:31.720]  said you know ask your professor your professor is the one that was
[02:41:31.720 --> 02:41:35.680]  interpreting this this is your constitutional professor and so he just
[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:39.160]  kind of buttoned up at that point and then of course there's the other
[02:41:39.160 --> 02:41:44.280]  issues and he's joined the pack in terms of saying that Ed Snowden is a
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:50.840]  traitor yeah reversing himself on that I find that to be very disturbing
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:55.280]  because we have to understand that we need to have whistleblowers and the
[02:41:55.280 --> 02:41:59.760]  reason that Snowden did it the way Snowden did it was because he saw the
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:05.000]  government prosecute legitimate whistleblowers within the NSA going after
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:09.560]  Thomas Drake specifically threatening and coming after and detaining breaking
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:13.480]  in on William Bennings he's taking a shower and so forth all of these people
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:18.240]  who upheld the Constitution again we're coming back to the Constitution okay
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:22.280]  and and so you have all these NSA personnel like William Benny who was
[02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:27.360]  head technical globally he was the the top person technically as well as
[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:32.080]  Thomas Drake looking at this with others and saying you are doing dragnet
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:35.520]  surveillance of the American people that is unconstitutional they went through
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:38.760]  the proper channels they went to the Senate they tried to follow everything
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:45.040]  by the book they were ignored and finally Thomas Drake mentioned it to the
[02:42:45.040 --> 02:42:49.600]  press they come after him and try to prosecute him for nonsense that they
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:54.000]  are allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with in spades always kill the
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:57.040]  messenger yes because you know as we always point out they don't go after
[02:42:57.040 --> 02:42:59.760]  the people who actually committed the acts they want to talk about the person
[02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:05.840]  who brought the the action yes yes so we have that situation when Snowden saw
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:10.600]  that and he he did what he did because he knew that they would arrest him that
[02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:16.120]  they would squelch this information and when Ted Cruz says you know at one
[02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:20.200]  point well if he was tipping us off to criminal wrongdoing I'm paraphrasing
[02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:24.280]  what he had to say then he should be a hero but now he says no he helped our
[02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:29.280]  enemies how does it help your enemies when you say that they're spying on the
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:33.800]  American people okay it only helps enemies in the sense that we don't like
[02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:37.080]  our government as much as we did before I guess we could make that kind of an
[02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:41.080]  argument well and also you know saying that well now they know how we go about
[02:43:41.080 --> 02:43:46.480]  spying on them and so now they can skirt around those procedures and and you
[02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:51.240]  know go through new channels but they didn't stop a single terror attack they
[02:43:51.240 --> 02:43:54.920]  it was ineffective in the first place that's right so all they were doing was
[02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:58.640]  scooping up all of the personal information from millions of innocent
[02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:02.480]  hundreds of millions of innocent it's just the world the bulk data collection
[02:44:02.480 --> 02:44:07.040]  yes so much going on you can't really it made it totally ineffective that's the point
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:10.520]  the way many days you just created a bigger haystack to try to find your
[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:16.320]  needle and and it really has not done anything to to help anybody and in my
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:20.880]  opinion I mean clearly the state actors it's not any big surprise when we learn
[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:26.480]  through the Snowden documents that the NSA is spying on Germany for example okay
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:30.400]  even though there are allies we spy on them well of course they know that the
[02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:34.320]  states know that and of course the terrorists know that as well okay and
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:38.480]  they're taking measures to to try to undo that so it really doesn't make a
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:42.120]  difference in that sense and I think if we're going to take that kind of action
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:45.720]  against people who exposed criminal activity we've seen this happen over and
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:50.560]  over again look at Manning for example when WikiLeaks exposed these video tapes
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:55.560]  of people repeatedly shooting an ambulance you know first of all they
[02:44:55.560 --> 02:44:58.440]  shoot people that are walking around that aren't armed people carrying a
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:01.560]  camera that when an ambulance comes to help them they shoot up the ambulance
[02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:04.800]  and you get the video tape where they're laughing about it and so forth okay we
[02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:08.760]  had a similar situation with the hospital attack in Afghanistan the
[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:12.960]  doctors against borders where they not only did a 30-minute prolonged attack
[02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:17.520]  of something that was very well known as being a hospital they were contacted
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:22.040]  by the doctors without borders as this attack was going on then we learned that
[02:45:22.040 --> 02:45:26.480]  they were also targeting people who are running from the hospital okay so there
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:30.960]  are criminal war crimes that are going on that need to be exposed need to be
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:35.400]  purged and understand there's never going to be a situation where every cop
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:40.320]  every soldier does the right thing the test of a society is once you find out
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:46.360]  somebody has broken the the moral law broken yes the criminal law broken the
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:51.080]  international law in terms of rules of engagement that's the point at which now
[02:45:51.080 --> 02:45:56.160]  the the society either does the right thing they have a moment to decide as to
[02:45:56.160 --> 02:45:59.200]  whether or not they're going to do the right thing or they're going to embrace
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:03.360]  this criminality and continue down that path on people act like if you point out
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:07.080]  these things that your anti cop your anti-military no you're trying to
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:10.280]  strengthen the military by purging the negative people in it yeah you don't want
[02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:13.880]  to have these type of actions and this is what our enemies look at they point at
[02:46:13.880 --> 02:46:16.600]  this and this is what they put in the in the recruitment videos look at these
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:20.920]  guys shooting up you know a guy who comes to rescue a camera crew or look at
[02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:23.840]  these guys blowing up a hospital and when you leave those people in your
[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:27.480]  ranks whether they be police or military that's what the enemies point to if you
[02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:30.600]  could get rid of those guys then you'd have a healthier law enforcement and
[02:46:30.600 --> 02:46:33.960]  military and that's the point that Frank Superko has made many times he said
[02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:37.520]  of course you're going to have bad actors and the police so the difference is
[02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:41.320]  are you going to make this corruption systemic or are you going to prosecute
[02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:44.800]  the bad guys when this happens and of course this is the issue and and Rand
[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:48.240]  Paul has said when people bring up Snowden he goes okay he broke some laws
[02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:52.360]  you want to put him in jail then put the people in jail who broke the laws to
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:56.720]  prevail on us at the same time nobody wants to talk about that just like they
[02:46:56.720 --> 02:47:00.320]  don't want to talk about the fact that we are funding ISIS and that's the real
[02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:06.080]  story about Benghazi they're gonna go to the visceral story about how these
[02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:10.640]  heroes were betrayed and died and that's a very powerful stand down and
[02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:14.480]  exactly that's a very powerful narrative and that story should be told but the
[02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:19.640]  bigger story is the death of our society the death of the rule of law and
[02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:23.640]  morality when we allow this to happen that's the bigger story but again it's
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:27.280]  just a statistic like a million people dying okay the one person dying that's
[02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:31.880]  a tragedy this will be a very tragic movie and it is tragic what happened
[02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:36.800]  there but we still need to address these bigger problems absolutely and also one
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:40.840]  of the other things with that without Rand Paul being there we couldn't
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:45.440]  address this but one of the things that Congress does have that constitutional
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:50.160]  authority with is the military and and they want to increase the military
[02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:53.960]  spending by billions of dollars which of course that means it's gonna get added
[02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:59.760]  to our debt and there's no way to pay for it no way to explain why this is
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:04.400]  necessary why it's a good idea and also going in and saying well let's audit the
[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:09.720]  Pentagon how are they spending this money we can't even audit the Fed yeah
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:14.200]  they're just like we just want to keep on throwing money at them we don't care
[02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:18.000]  how they're spending it it's going on the back of the taxpayers and the
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:22.880]  children in the future and the only person that is saying that is insane is
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:27.120]  Rand Paul yeah yeah he's the only one who really pushed back against the idea
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:30.000]  that we're going to go toe-to-toe with the Russians we're going to tell them to
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.800]  get out of this country where they've been invited or we're going to shoot down
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:36.400]  their planes and start World War three but of course they would like to start
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:40.360]  World War three if we have a total economic collapse and as I'm looking at
[02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:45.440]  this and watching the stock market numbers continue to go down that makes
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:49.240]  perfectly good sense we've said this was the game plan all along that they
[02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:54.440]  wanted to create a situation flash points where they could distract the
[02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:57.800]  public's attention is what Gerald Salenty was talking about so we
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:49:01.400]  understand that that's what's going to happen but that's it's still very
[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:06.560]  disturbing to watch this now in terms of other points of the debate what stuck
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:10.440]  out to you two last night well like I said last night you know I'm not going
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:13.360]  to vote for the guy but I thought Marco Rubio came out with some very good
[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:18.400]  points I will we were talking so I really get it here as much as I want to
[02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:21.960]  hear about how they felt about the Second Amendment they did ask Trump you
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:26.560]  know did you support or would you support any type of gun regulations as far
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:29.520]  as buying the firearm and he said no but once again on the back and he does
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:34.000]  support the no fly no gun buy list which is very concerning to me
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:39.880]  Jeb is Jeb Jeb exclamation point I really wish you would get off the stage
[02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:43.840]  and make room for somebody else so you know as the person that they talked to
[02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:46.520]  last night in Charleston pointed out you know we did lose out not having
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:50.040]  Rand Paul there but we also did win by showing people there's alternative way
[02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:54.160]  get your message across you know how he did on social media yeah in the past I
[02:49:54.160 --> 02:49:57.160]  think you always had some very good back and forth especially between Rand Paul
[02:49:57.160 --> 02:50:00.920]  and Chris Christie Chris Christie being the most belligerently authoritarian
[02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:04.840]  person on the stage and proud of it and so it was always interesting to see the
[02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:08.520]  authoritarian versus the libertarian on there but I think it was far more
[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:13.320]  important for Rand Paul to break the stranglehold of the mainstream media
[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:17.200]  control and and to make it clear to people too because I've seen Rachel
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:21.360]  Maddow saying well you know he didn't make it so he's a crybaby you know look
[02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:26.680]  they had three polls that finished on Sunday and they embargoed this one poll
[02:50:26.680 --> 02:50:31.920]  where he did well for 36 hours Bloomberg did and Fox said we're not going to pay
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:35.760]  any attention to it if they had allowed that poll there he would have been tied
[02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:39.400]  with Jeb Bush and he should have been in the debate but he did even better
[02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:43.280]  thanks a lot yeah okay they were hoisted by their own part stay with us we're
[02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:48.040]  gonna be right back with Leanne McAdoo and Jakari Jackson
[02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:56.040]  are you looking to sell body armor want to make extra money selling body armor
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:00.120]  at your local gun shows with low minimum buys and great returns Katie armor is

[02:55:14.480 --> 02:55:22.120]  store dot com I'm looking at this the story here about Hillary Clinton and her
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:28.000]  national lead is slipping faster they say in 2016 than it did in 2008 that's
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:32.600]  pretty amazing she is taking very quickly yes she's she laughed that off
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:36.240]  though she said oh you know how these polls are they go up they go down I don't
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:39.880]  really concern myself with them yeah that's that's true but of course that's
[02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:44.080]  the Washington Post saying that that's not us these are people who actually do
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:47.600]  like Hillary Clinton and they say her national lead is slipping faster than it
[02:55:47.600 --> 02:55:51.160]  did eight years ago when she eventually lost to Barack Obama they say she's
[02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:55.040]  doing better nationally but at the moment because she's only got one
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:56:00.800]  competitor in the past in 2008 it was split between Obama and John Edwards
[02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:04.400]  you know the the Brecht girl and I thought it was interesting also we have
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:10.040]  an RNC member urging the party to rally against Trump now this is the same RNC
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:14.360]  that Richard Reeves our reporter on the ground yesterday and Charles in
[02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:18.920]  Charleston South Carolina talked to the RNC member who proposed that they
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:25.840]  impeach Obama they couldn't get more than four people out of 168 to go for
[02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:29.520]  impeachment of Obama but now they're saying hey we need to rally against
[02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:34.560]  Trump that's amazing to me and of course the rationale for this is that we have
[02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:39.720]  to say that we control this party so that's the partisan politics my question
[02:56:39.720 --> 02:56:43.560]  is if you know I'm not a supporter of Trump but if they're going to oust Trump
[02:56:43.560 --> 02:56:47.240]  who are they going to try to put in his place to you know really bring up the
[02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:51.760]  party yeah well that that may be seen of course it looks like Rubio is winning
[02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:56.560]  the establishment primary at if you look at the judge report poll and that's
[02:56:56.560 --> 02:57:00.240]  what they're concerned about that's why Jeb is coming so hard after Rubio even
[02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:05.560]  criticizing him for not being tall enough but let's go to Rob do Rob you
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:10.160]  have some comments about last night's debate go ahead first off I want to say
[02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:15.120]  I am barely recovered from last night I was up here to about 12 30 cleaning up
[02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:18.360]  helping with the other guys to put the studio back together and I do want to
[02:57:18.360 --> 02:57:22.400]  say you guys did a fantastic job this being our six or seventh debate now it
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:26.560]  was the Sixth Republican but we did do one Democratic debate and there's a lot
[02:57:26.560 --> 02:57:30.200]  of work that goes in behind the scenes to get those things going a lot of moving
[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:35.960]  parts and you guys were just stalwart and kept pouring the heat on these liars
[02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:40.160]  now what y'all were saying about Trump just now who are they gonna get to
[02:57:40.160 --> 02:57:45.080]  replace him I think this whole debate was set up for kind of Ted Cruz to take
[02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:48.960]  that mantle because I think you are gonna see Ted Cruz win Iowa and then
[02:57:48.960 --> 02:57:53.280]  after that you know I think he's gonna have some momentum and I and I do think
[02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:58.440]  Trump's overall shtick of just kind of acting confident is sort of wearing thin
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:02.400]  it's like people want to see what's behind the confidence what do you have to
[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:09.440]  offer in addition to just being you know awesome exactly Rob I think and I
[02:58:09.440 --> 02:58:15.160]  fought for a long time that Ted Cruz was put out there as essentially a ringer
[02:58:15.160 --> 02:58:20.240]  to try to get the Liberty vote the the common man's vote and now we see him
[02:58:20.240 --> 02:58:25.400]  turning with Snowden as well as with these other issues stay with us we'll
[02:58:25.400 --> 02:58:28.840]  be right back with more analysis
[02:58:34.240 --> 02:58:40.800]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network

[03:00:10.400 --> 03:00:14.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show this fourth hour I'm here with Leanne
[03:00:14.720 --> 03:00:19.320]  McAdoo and Jakari Jackson we also have Rob Dew joining us in the other studio and
[03:00:19.320 --> 03:00:22.880]  he's going to finish up the remainder of this fourth hour after this first
[03:00:22.880 --> 03:00:26.040]  segment and of course Rob we were talking about who's gonna take Trump's
[03:00:26.040 --> 03:00:31.520]  place one of the things this RNC member was saying when he was urging the party
[03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:35.880]  to rally against Trump he continued to use this phrase we heard first from
[03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:42.240]  Nikki Halley Haley about angry voices that seems to be the preferred way to
[03:00:42.240 --> 03:00:47.200]  refer to Donald Trump and I thought he did a great job yesterday in terms of
[03:00:47.200 --> 03:00:51.160]  diffusing that he very calmly said yeah we should be angry about what's going on
[03:00:51.160 --> 03:00:55.360]  and I think people should be angry about what the RNC is doing and of course
[03:00:55.360 --> 03:00:59.800]  Donald Trump is the expression of the voter anger about these people who are
[03:00:59.800 --> 03:01:03.880]  more concerned as he said about reducing our label so that's just it
[03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:08.720]  well they're label yeah and look at life in general David if people always say
[03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:11.560]  oh you're not supposed to be angry everybody's supposed to be calm we're
[03:01:11.560 --> 03:01:15.600]  always supposed to be passive there from birth they train you not to have
[03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:20.640]  outbursts those are bad and there is something to that but also anger can be
[03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:24.920]  used as a positive force for making stuff happen you know you get mad I'm
[03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:28.280]  gonna carry the ball I'm gonna do like Alex Jones does it every day takes that
[03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:33.240]  ball filled with anger that anger filled football and gives you what's really on
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:37.560]  his mind every day and I think you know if Alex Jones wasn't an angry person
[03:01:37.560 --> 03:01:42.160]  you wouldn't see you know all this you know this media empire that he's built
[03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:46.320]  from the ground up oh yeah absolutely look at Ritalin for example I mean most
[03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:53.280]  CEOs have enough energy and that they would be put on Ritalin today if they
[03:01:53.280 --> 03:01:56.640]  were going through school and so they want to dumb that down they want to
[03:01:56.640 --> 03:02:00.280]  pull that out but it can be a very effective strategy to be able to
[03:02:00.280 --> 03:02:03.520]  multitask and do a lot of things to have a lot of energy to have a lot of
[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:07.120]  passion we should be passionate about what is happening and they should ask
[03:02:07.120 --> 03:02:11.400]  themselves those people in the Republican Party should ask themselves why
[03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:14.960]  everybody is so angry with them and of course we just saw the best example of
[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:19.120]  that with the Omnibust bill where they went in and funded everything even
[03:02:19.120 --> 03:02:23.160]  funding that climate change treaty a couple of weeks you know just just it
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:26.520]  was only what a week to ten days old and they said well we're gonna have
[03:02:26.520 --> 03:02:29.400]  something to say about it well what they said about it was yeah sure you do it
[03:02:29.400 --> 03:02:35.560]  there you go in 2014 and 2015 yeah even though the voters made it clear that we
[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:39.880]  wanted change and so then they went in and just signed the whole thing over for
[03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:42.280]  the fiscal year well that's the thing that people don't feel that they're
[03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:46.280]  accountable to the voters anymore I'm in office I have power so they're just
[03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:49.360]  gonna do whatever they want and they know that most people are gonna be asleep
[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:53.080]  at the wheel and just hope that it works itself out in the end the term the term
[03:02:53.080 --> 03:02:55.960]  is loyal opposition yeah and that's what we have this is World Wrestling
[03:02:55.960 --> 03:03:02.160]  Federation this is heels and heroes and it's the same thing we're you know and
[03:03:02.160 --> 03:03:05.200]  we're trying to of course we're looking at the Republican Party is something
[03:03:05.200 --> 03:03:09.560]  that has a little bit more variation in their thoughts you know you got Ram
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:12.880]  Paul on one end and then you got Jeb Bush on the other and then all the
[03:03:12.880 --> 03:03:17.240]  flavors in between and I but I do think Donald Trump stands outside of that and
[03:03:17.240 --> 03:03:20.360]  he proudly does that and that's one reason why I do kind of look at him going
[03:03:20.360 --> 03:03:24.280]  well if I was gonna vote for any of these clowns it would be Donald Trump as
[03:03:24.280 --> 03:03:28.000]  compared to what I'm seeing out there now unless you see Rand Paul take it maybe
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:31.840]  Rand Paul does have some grassroots behind him you know we interviewed one
[03:03:31.840 --> 03:03:34.960]  of the the gentleman last night Richard did and he was there and he was his
[03:03:34.960 --> 03:03:37.680]  disappointing that Rand Paul isn't in the debate they had an outburst from a
[03:03:37.680 --> 03:03:43.120]  group saying stand with Rand. Rand was the like biggest thing there on on
[03:03:43.120 --> 03:03:48.560]  social media so of course that stand with Rand outburst was edited out of the
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:53.040]  transcript was pointed out by somebody today so Rand Paul's name does not
[03:03:53.040 --> 03:03:57.000]  appear anywhere within that debate that's right even though he had you know
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:00.280]  the massive presence outside you know Biggs talked to the guys beforehand you
[03:04:00.280 --> 03:04:03.760]  know out there shouting stand with Rand before the thing even started yeah you
[03:04:03.760 --> 03:04:07.480]  know so people were out there concerned about Rand Paul not being included in
[03:04:07.480 --> 03:04:12.560]  the main event so when people see the the mainstream media like Fox and
[03:04:12.560 --> 03:04:16.640]  Bloomberg and the GOP moving against somebody they might get interested and
[03:04:16.640 --> 03:04:20.560]  say hey who is this guy that they dislike so much maybe there's something there
[03:04:20.560 --> 03:04:23.720]  and there is something there we see Trump bringing up issues of the other
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:27.480]  people would not talk about we see Rand Paul bringing up issues that other
[03:04:27.480 --> 03:04:31.160]  people would not talk about I would like to see a lot of these issues brought up

[03:04:51.720 --> 03:04:57.440]  Hillary Clinton is running for president as an advocate for women's rights but
[03:04:57.440 --> 03:05:02.440]  there is a shocking side to her story that has been carefully covered up
[03:05:02.440 --> 03:05:06.920]  until now the notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women no
[03:05:06.920 --> 03:05:11.760]  bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically that's
[03:05:11.760 --> 03:05:16.960]  GOP presidential consultant Roger Stone talking about his book the Clinton's
[03:05:16.960 --> 03:05:21.920]  war on women from the Alex Jones show where Roger Stone says Hillary Clinton
[03:05:21.920 --> 03:05:26.800]  played a huge role in the cover-up of her husband's rape allegation Hillary's
[03:05:26.800 --> 03:05:32.400]  the one who runs the cover-up now on the campaign trail Hillary refuses to answer

[03:08:04.200 --> 03:08:08.400]  radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist alex jones alex jones a
[03:08:08.400 --> 03:08:12.840]  nudge up radio guy talk show host alex jones a man who trades in such sinister
[03:08:12.840 --> 03:08:16.280]  conspiracy theories you have to wonder if he really believes half of what he
[03:08:16.280 --> 03:08:19.760]  says I'm here to warn people you keep telling me to shut up this isn't a
[03:08:19.760 --> 03:08:25.440]  game speech can anything be done to stop the hatred I think alex was the one
[03:08:25.440 --> 03:08:34.080]  who took the pro-gun position I don't want that man to have a gun else shows
[03:08:34.080 --> 03:08:37.600]  is a 9-11 truth or that conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all
[03:08:37.600 --> 03:08:41.880]  conspiracy theories that's an internet talk show called info wars I heard that
[03:08:41.880 --> 03:08:49.320]  alex jones so it's true you're making some very serious allegations against the
[03:08:49.320 --> 03:08:53.040]  US government saying that they stage attacks they allow them to occur in the
[03:08:53.040 --> 03:08:57.660]  United States against us classified alex jones may sound crazy I think that
[03:08:57.660 --> 03:09:02.880]  alex jones is a lunatic that may have threatened the conspiracy theory deeply I
[03:09:02.880 --> 03:09:09.320]  think racist I just got called racist by MSNBC challenge Alex Jones to a boxing
[03:09:09.320 --> 03:09:14.080]  match show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop them I'd love to
[03:09:14.080 --> 03:09:22.240]  see that in uniform keep shoving lies at your audience jackasses I like that
[03:09:22.240 --> 03:09:42.920]  is the best we have gangsters running this country criminals gangsters bigger
[03:09:42.920 --> 03:09:56.920]  this war gets the more freedom we lose the cover up everything you've heard us
[03:09:56.920 --> 03:10:02.720]  talk about is now that an old in triplicate spade this is real I guess I
[03:10:02.720 --> 03:10:06.840]  had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me to Matt it's
[03:10:06.840 --> 03:10:10.560]  over for you they've got the votes now to enforce copyright law you're out of
[03:10:10.560 --> 03:10:16.480]  there you want it baby you're about to get it
[03:10:20.400 --> 03:10:26.640]  we did meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea be tolerant and see
[03:10:26.640 --> 03:10:31.200]  how many guns or what kind of guns they came to take we met him at Concord Bridge
[03:10:31.200 --> 03:10:36.600]  and we blew their punk ass brains out info wars has been able to break every
[03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:41.880]  record infiltrate every operation blow the criminal cover of operatives more
[03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:46.880]  than any other institution out there of freedom and I'm so proud of that the
[03:10:46.880 --> 03:10:51.640]  notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women no bill rapes them
[03:10:51.640 --> 03:10:56.200]  physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically I hope the enemies of
[03:10:56.200 --> 03:11:00.720]  this broadcast when you lie about us when you censor us when you attack us when
[03:11:00.720 --> 03:11:05.360]  you delist us when you do that you're signing on to the other side these
[03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:12.160]  people are all the devil let's be very blunt about this raise hell and demand
[03:11:12.160 --> 03:11:16.680]  accountability it is the most corrupt degenerate criminal government in
[03:11:16.680 --> 03:11:27.320]  American history from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[03:11:27.320 --> 03:11:30.920]  moving forward toward the barrier the police have been telling everybody they
[03:11:30.920 --> 03:11:36.640]  are going to shoot if we don't move back their defeat will be ultimately a
[03:11:36.640 --> 03:11:44.800]  pushing one another fabulous intro by Darren McBreen the man sitting to my
[03:11:44.800 --> 03:11:49.760]  left this is Rob do this is the fourth hour of overdrive you're watching the I
[03:11:49.760 --> 03:11:53.320]  guess the new tail end hour that we've added on the Alex Jones show if your
[03:11:53.320 --> 03:11:56.880]  radio station is not picking this up call them and ask them to it's another
[03:11:56.880 --> 03:12:01.320]  hour of original content that we'll be producing we do about five hours a day if
[03:12:01.320 --> 03:12:04.920]  you count the nightly news is another hour of produce programming per day and
[03:12:04.920 --> 03:12:08.440]  how many videos how many videos on YouTube I count yesterday we put up 20
[03:12:08.440 --> 03:12:12.360]  different videos on YouTube I was I was even amazed at that and and we
[03:12:12.360 --> 03:12:15.920]  actually missed a couple that are going up right now so if you count yesterday
[03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:20.720]  about 24 total videos we are really churning it out this week has been very
[03:12:20.720 --> 03:12:26.280]  productive last night's debate coverage I think was in terms of us just really
[03:12:26.280 --> 03:12:30.880]  handling we handled the debate instead of the debate handling us like not letting
[03:12:30.880 --> 03:12:35.640]  these guys push their BS and just go we're gonna take it yeah we saw
[03:12:35.640 --> 03:12:38.840]  ramp all really come out and just take it away and just go hey you know what I
[03:12:38.840 --> 03:12:42.040]  don't need your debate coverage yeah he would have been a big-time loser if he
[03:12:42.040 --> 03:12:45.240]  would have allowed them to demote him to the kitty table but he was like no
[03:12:45.240 --> 03:12:49.640]  screw you not only am I gonna boycott I'm gonna go get all of the free media
[03:12:49.640 --> 03:12:53.520]  because they're all waiting to see what I'm gonna do and then I'm gonna dominate
[03:12:53.520 --> 03:12:58.280]  on Twitter with my Periscope how powerful social media has become because
[03:12:58.280 --> 03:13:03.520]  in a lot of ways Rand Paul stole the show last night because he was on Twitter
[03:13:03.520 --> 03:13:08.960]  right he had a Facebook mentions he was on Periscope they had that live town
[03:13:08.960 --> 03:13:12.160]  hall meeting where people were able to ask the real questions not these
[03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:16.480]  prescripted you know predetermined and pre-approved questions normally get in
[03:13:16.480 --> 03:13:19.720]  the debate so it's pretty awesome surprised and what do we see in the
[03:13:19.720 --> 03:13:25.240]  debate a lot of the same questions it just got so boring sitting there
[03:13:25.240 --> 03:13:27.920]  listening to these guys if it weren't for our coverage that would have been a
[03:13:27.920 --> 03:13:32.080]  very boring debate I totally agree and I really like it when people say let him
[03:13:32.080 --> 03:13:36.560]  talk no they talk enough yeah we're gonna talk and we tell you straight up at
[03:13:36.560 --> 03:13:40.160]  the beginning if you don't want nothing to add guys I want to show you this these
[03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:44.240]  are two stories here New York Times I don't think you guys have this you want
[03:13:44.240 --> 03:13:49.240]  to get it on on on overhead cam deadliest a bull outbreak on record is over
[03:13:49.240 --> 03:13:55.800]  WHO says this is from the New York Times there it is now now look Ebola virus new
[03:13:55.800 --> 03:14:01.640]  cases emerge in Sierra Leone today back back and it's back all and maybe it's a
[03:14:01.640 --> 03:14:05.080]  new strain of Ebola that they've just created in their lab exactly the span
[03:14:05.080 --> 03:14:11.640]  of one day it's now back in Sierra Leone my Ebola is back so hopefully you that
[03:14:11.640 --> 03:14:16.240]  nobody really knows what is going on over there and how these things are
[03:14:16.240 --> 03:14:21.400]  being how it's being created how it's being controlled it it's a sad
[03:14:21.400 --> 03:14:24.600]  situation especially for the Africans but I firmly believe there is something
[03:14:24.600 --> 03:14:28.760]  going on behind the scenes that is making this disease as virulent as it is
[03:14:28.760 --> 03:14:33.040]  and as as widespread as it is I don't think it's happening by natural osmosis
[03:14:33.040 --> 03:14:38.600]  that's my gut feeling so we'll leave that there I've also got a bunch of GMO
[03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:43.480]  news that I printed this out for when Anthony's gonna come on Anthony
[03:14:43.480 --> 03:14:46.640]  Gutierrez gonna be joining me at the bottom of the hour those of you keeping
[03:14:46.640 --> 03:14:49.680]  score and we're gonna be talking about all kinds of stuff including what's
[03:14:49.680 --> 03:14:53.800]  going on with Walmart as Alex Jones talked about earlier in a video we shot
[03:14:53.800 --> 03:14:59.560]  we shot that in the office we gave it to the guys they put it up played it put
[03:14:59.560 --> 03:15:03.120]  the articles on top of it made it even more dynamic all live in an in in real
[03:15:03.120 --> 03:15:08.000]  time and it's we're at the point now like where the team is so coalesced we
[03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:12.400]  could start bringing in more people and showing them how the processes work and
[03:15:12.400 --> 03:15:15.800]  how we get stuff done quickly and efficiently but also looking good yeah
[03:15:15.800 --> 03:15:21.640]  because there is a technique to get it out there quickly in making it news
[03:15:21.640 --> 03:15:24.880]  worthy and whether it's shooting a video on YouTube and uploading it
[03:15:24.880 --> 03:15:29.360]  immediately or Facebook mentions or you know doing a produced report there's all
[03:15:29.360 --> 03:15:34.640]  different ways to get this information out so Darren like what I guess I guess
[03:15:34.640 --> 03:15:37.080]  what I want to know is what's your process of putting something together like
[03:15:37.080 --> 03:15:40.280]  that intro that we just saw if you're watching on info wars.com forward slash
[03:15:40.280 --> 03:15:45.320]  show it's a little bit more processed you know it's more polished when I'm
[03:15:45.320 --> 03:15:50.600]  doing that those intros so but so it really just takes a storyboard it you
[03:15:50.600 --> 03:15:55.080]  know and first to get all the clips together and that was a massive amount
[03:15:55.080 --> 03:15:58.000]  of clips to all those attacks on Alex over the years I mean you just and a
[03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:01.240]  lot of times you have to narrow it down because each time I do this I could
[03:16:01.240 --> 03:16:05.480]  literally have a two-hour documentary each time you know so just kind of get
[03:16:05.480 --> 03:16:09.160]  the best of and change it up and make it exciting throw some music on there some
[03:16:09.160 --> 03:16:13.280]  fancy graphics and and that's how we do which by the way we have some playlists
[03:16:13.280 --> 03:16:18.240]  on our on our Alex Jones channel where we basically have started collating all
[03:16:18.240 --> 03:16:22.800]  the fans have made intros of the fans go and find the Alex Jones rants and they
[03:16:22.800 --> 03:16:29.640]  create their own remixes of rants and so we add those to this playlist kind of
[03:16:29.640 --> 03:16:32.440]  giving the fans a little bit of a boost as well that's right we should have a
[03:16:32.440 --> 03:16:35.880]  list of intros as well because I know Jacari Jackson he's made several of them
[03:16:35.880 --> 03:16:39.000]  that are very nice and that's it's always fun putting the intros together George
[03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:42.120]  Carlin when we I kind of cut it up then you made it look really good together
[03:16:42.120 --> 03:16:46.640]  yep I think that's where we really can come together on that stuff is is doing
[03:16:46.640 --> 03:16:49.880]  it that way and sharing sharing the load yeah so there's all the playlist if
[03:16:49.880 --> 03:16:55.480]  anyone wants to guys check out this story Texas student suspended for sharing
[03:16:55.480 --> 03:16:59.120]  inhaler a Texas middle school student was suspended after sharing her inhaler
[03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:02.880]  with an asthmatic student who's gasping for breath on Tuesday she faces 30 days
[03:17:02.880 --> 03:17:08.040]  at an alternative school wow and that's not to protect the girl for it's this
[03:17:08.040 --> 03:17:11.520]  to protect the school you should let her die yeah yeah it would have been better
[03:17:11.520 --> 03:17:16.440]  to let her die or you know have even a worse allergy brain yeah brain death
[03:17:16.440 --> 03:17:20.520]  from not being able to breathe losing oxygen and this is a you know a human
[03:17:20.520 --> 03:17:24.520]  being that's your your innate thing is you want to save that other human being
[03:17:24.520 --> 03:17:27.960]  but now you could potentially get sued or the school could get sued yeah the
[03:17:27.960 --> 03:17:31.840]  saddest part about that headline is it's not even shocking anymore oh I know
[03:17:31.840 --> 03:17:34.800]  there's no I mean for years ago that would have been a really big deal and
[03:17:34.800 --> 03:17:37.800]  it should be a big deal now but I mean I just like I feel like I'm immune to it
[03:17:37.800 --> 03:17:44.160]  here's some more freedom in America let's see this one freedom Plano mom sued
[03:17:44.160 --> 03:17:47.960]  over Playhouse loud kids yeah the sound of children playing we've seen this
[03:17:47.960 --> 03:17:51.480]  before remember the cardboard house the guy built his cardboard fort cardboard
[03:17:51.480 --> 03:17:55.240]  castle and that's so offensive and it looked awesome and people freaked out
[03:17:55.240 --> 03:17:59.120]  about it you know what those things last about two weeks let the kids have their
[03:17:59.120 --> 03:18:05.080]  fun or they're gonna come arrest you I mean this life is so short you got one
[03:18:05.080 --> 03:18:09.320]  life to live enjoy it why do people need their perfect lawns and they're
[03:18:09.320 --> 03:18:12.600]  perfectly manicured homes well they've been they've been conditioned to think
[03:18:12.600 --> 03:18:17.200]  that's that's the best way to live yeah but her classmate began wheezing and
[03:18:17.200 --> 03:18:21.600]  gasping for breath and every second gets worse said the student who helped her
[03:18:21.600 --> 03:18:26.040]  out and who's had the disease since she was five and Rush offered the girl her
[03:18:26.040 --> 03:18:29.400]  inhaler and the two were sent to the principal's office rush was punished
[03:18:29.400 --> 03:18:34.480]  several days at home suspension I mean this is this is a travesty I can't
[03:18:34.480 --> 03:18:39.120]  believe this happens you help out somebody and you get punished right and
[03:18:39.120 --> 03:18:42.960]  that's why and then people don't help in the future people drive by car wrecks
[03:18:42.960 --> 03:18:46.520]  because they go if I help I might get sued I'm I getting trouble exactly yeah

[03:24:18.600 --> 03:24:22.860]  going over some health news and also taking a look at Walmart and what what
[03:24:22.860 --> 03:24:26.820]  looks to be the fall of Walmart is happening now what does that mean for
[03:24:26.820 --> 03:24:30.500]  the rest of the country in society in general I have we outgrown the Walmart
[03:24:30.500 --> 03:24:35.100]  model but first before we get to that we had a guest yesterday Tim Kennedy who's
[03:24:35.100 --> 03:24:40.300]  a UFC fighter and he was talking about you know this ISIS threat that the FBI
[03:24:40.300 --> 03:24:46.700]  told him about which was against him and earlier today Alex did a video showing
[03:24:46.700 --> 03:24:50.540]  how Obama said hey anybody who says the economy's doing bad's pedal in fiction
[03:24:50.540 --> 03:24:55.380]  and then we get this news about the Walmart right and yesterday you did
[03:24:55.380 --> 03:24:58.900]  this this was your opening on the nightly news your opening stories talking
[03:24:58.900 --> 03:25:02.300]  about how Obama said oh ISIS is contained and then you kind of detailed
[03:25:02.300 --> 03:25:04.740]  all those once you go into a little bit of what you talked about last night
[03:25:04.740 --> 03:25:08.880]  well just you know the state of the union the state of the onion I would
[03:25:08.880 --> 03:25:13.180]  call it is he just came out and told everyone what he wants us to be like
[03:25:13.180 --> 03:25:16.820]  what he wants reality to be not what reality is so I just kind of took
[03:25:16.820 --> 03:25:21.740]  everyone down memory lane just the last year less than a year pointing out all
[03:25:21.740 --> 03:25:25.380]  the different times that there have been actual terror attacks people being
[03:25:25.380 --> 03:25:30.780]  picked up by the FBI planning terror attacks here on US soil terror attacks
[03:25:30.780 --> 03:25:36.460]  that were thwarted here like in Dallas with the drama Hamid contest and you
[03:25:36.460 --> 03:25:40.260]  know all these mysterious cell phone purchases which in several of these
[03:25:40.260 --> 03:25:44.140]  instances it's those prepay phones which are being used to detonate these
[03:25:44.140 --> 03:25:48.100]  explosives in Missouri yeah exactly those and some other things that went
[03:25:48.100 --> 03:25:53.260]  missing in some areas people were crazy stuff but pretty much behavior people
[03:25:53.260 --> 03:25:57.860]  are asking about dams yeah yes exactly wanted to take a tour of the dam which
[03:25:57.860 --> 03:26:02.860]  is completely legal and so but you know what Obama is everything is awesome
[03:26:02.860 --> 03:26:06.540]  nothing to see nothing to see there you go and so let's go to this clip now this
[03:26:06.540 --> 03:26:11.020]  is from yesterday's I guess it was the fourth hour he kind of finished up the
[03:26:11.020 --> 03:26:14.860]  show with Alex and then I jumped in but this is Tim Kennedy UFC fighter talking
[03:26:14.860 --> 03:26:21.060]  about the threat that the FBI told him here it is I said years ago this ISIS
[03:26:21.060 --> 03:26:25.540]  spinoff of al-qaeda is big a lot bigger than al-qaeda was because I'm on the
[03:26:25.540 --> 03:26:30.460]  ground I get the threats I see them at Ferguson and in New York and I see the
[03:26:30.460 --> 03:26:36.380]  signs I see the stickers it's trendy with the left and it's in Texas we go
[03:26:36.380 --> 03:26:40.060]  out to these Islamic training centers and get death threats we get hacked we get
[03:26:40.060 --> 03:26:44.940]  they put Joe Biggs former Staff Sergeant US Army decorated combat vet they put
[03:26:44.940 --> 03:26:48.700]  him in ISIS videos when he went down to the border to show him on the Texas
[03:26:48.700 --> 03:26:52.580]  border so this is what they do but but but Tim Kennedy just like bin Laden's a
[03:26:52.580 --> 03:26:56.220]  high-value target or was he's a high-value target now Tim I just set the
[03:26:56.220 --> 03:26:59.820]  stage is that accurate what I said correct me if I'm wrong you're the
[03:26:59.820 --> 03:27:04.060]  expert and please break down as much detail as you can about the personal
[03:27:04.060 --> 03:27:08.060]  federal Bureau of Investigation visit and warning you got it's great to have you
[03:27:08.060 --> 03:27:11.860]  here in the info war I've been a fan for a long time so just appreciate you
[03:27:11.860 --> 03:27:20.420]  having me from what they said the FBI the credible threat came from every
[03:27:20.420 --> 03:27:24.260]  day I get five to ten people saying hey I hate you you're gonna die I want to
[03:27:24.260 --> 03:27:29.020]  kill you everything you stand for I hate what makes this significant is you
[03:27:29.020 --> 03:27:33.740]  know this one was geotagged and they had they had content that they couldn't
[03:27:33.740 --> 03:27:37.500]  have gotten from anywhere else besides first-person so they had pictures of a
[03:27:37.500 --> 03:27:40.900]  guy's head that they cut off and they said this is gonna be you the geotag
[03:27:40.900 --> 03:27:44.940]  picture was was you know close enough that the FBI says hey this is
[03:27:44.940 --> 03:27:48.700]  significant and that's why we're that's why we're talking to you right now the
[03:27:48.700 --> 03:27:54.220]  problem was that I've been doing this for 13 years you know I don't know if I'm
[03:27:54.220 --> 03:27:57.940]  desensitized to it or I just don't care and I do have zero respect for the
[03:27:57.940 --> 03:28:02.700]  cowards that they are and the FBI is like you're not normal you should be a
[03:28:02.700 --> 03:28:05.700]  little bit freaked out by this as I don't know let them come I don't you
[03:28:05.700 --> 03:28:08.500]  like I've been traveling all over the world to find these guys and now they're
[03:28:08.500 --> 03:28:11.660]  gonna come to Texas last time they gave it a whirl was in Garland I didn't go so
[03:28:11.660 --> 03:28:15.460]  well for them so you like come to central Texas and see how this is gonna
[03:28:15.460 --> 03:28:19.180]  work you know they're the only thing they got going for them is they're brutal
[03:28:19.180 --> 03:28:23.020]  they're evil and they have no respect for human life they're uneducated they're
[03:28:23.020 --> 03:28:27.220]  weak they're stupid but they have no respect for anything and they'll we now
[03:28:27.220 --> 03:28:31.380]  have two versions of this we have the short clip up on our YouTube channel if
[03:28:31.380 --> 03:28:35.180]  you guys want to pull up the computer here FBI says ISIS threat in Texas and
[03:28:35.180 --> 03:28:39.340]  also former Green Beret UFC fighter details ISIS threat in Texas that's the
[03:28:39.340 --> 03:28:43.740]  longer interview Tim Kennedy did with Alex and we have the shorter one which
[03:28:43.740 --> 03:28:48.700]  just details I'm talking about the threat and you know it I don't think they
[03:28:48.700 --> 03:28:52.180]  said it in that clip but it was geotagged from Houston Texas oh wow that's
[03:28:52.180 --> 03:28:56.420]  where that's where it originated from so that's pretty close right which is
[03:28:56.420 --> 03:28:59.580]  where they have picked up the other guy there in Houston who was working on
[03:28:59.580 --> 03:29:04.500]  attacking some malls there in Houston using prepaid phones to detonate these
[03:29:04.500 --> 03:29:08.300]  explosive devices so I wonder if they're buying the phones somewhere else and
[03:29:08.300 --> 03:29:12.260]  then shipping them over so they there's no connection or they can you know they
[03:29:12.260 --> 03:29:15.900]  coming across the border I mean we've talked to Texas border patrol volunteers
[03:29:15.900 --> 03:29:21.780]  and then you know they found Muslim prayer rugs Iranian cash on the Texas
[03:29:21.780 --> 03:29:26.300]  side of the border I mean translation dictionaries yep that's right so it's
[03:29:26.300 --> 03:29:30.060]  here people you better better get prepared for it because and keep your
[03:29:30.060 --> 03:29:34.220]  eyes open because ISIS is here in America and we definitely need to do
[03:29:34.220 --> 03:29:37.020]  something about his creation by our government we back with more as Rob do
[03:29:37.020 --> 03:29:42.180]  for the fourth hour of overdrive thanks to Darren and sitting in you we're on
[03:29:42.180 --> 03:29:50.380]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:29:51.940 --> 03:29:55.820]  despite all the status rhetoric that gun control works here's five reasons why
[03:29:55.820 --> 03:29:59.660]  it won't number one California has many of the most restrictive gun laws in the
[03:29:59.660 --> 03:30:03.420]  country yet those laws did absolutely nothing to stop the San Bernardino
[03:30:03.420 --> 03:30:06.820]  shooting number two Paris France also has some of the most restrictive gun laws
[03:30:06.820 --> 03:30:10.460]  in the world but those laws also did nothing to stop November 13th ISIS
[03:30:10.460 --> 03:30:15.060]  attacks number three it's estimated that someone in Chicago is shot every 2.8
[03:30:15.060 --> 03:30:20.100]  hours despite the city's strict gun laws number four Mexico also has restrictive
[03:30:20.100 --> 03:30:24.260]  gun laws just like Chicago yet over 160,000 people have been murdered in the
[03:30:24.260 --> 03:30:28.260]  country's drug war since 2007 the only people who are actually stopping the
[03:30:28.260 --> 03:30:32.500]  Mexican cartels or private citizens who are openly defined Mexico's gun laws to
[03:30:32.500 --> 03:30:36.820]  form self-defense malicious number five president Obama has been arming and
[03:30:36.820 --> 03:30:40.940]  funding ISIS link Syrian rebels for quite some time in fact Obama proved the
[03:30:40.940 --> 03:30:44.940]  rearming of these so-called moderate rebels on October 1st the same day he
[03:30:44.940 --> 03:30:48.140]  called for gun control in response to the community college shooting up in

[03:34:47.580 --> 03:34:52.940]  parents were in Hurricane Rita and our our house had three trees fall on it

[03:34:57.380 --> 03:35:01.860]  hot it was like the end of September it was the year the hurricane the other
[03:35:01.860 --> 03:35:07.020]  hurricane hit New Orleans I forget the name was Katrina yeah that's it so then
[03:35:07.020 --> 03:35:11.660]  Rita hit and what did we survive on we had MRE's that we were able to eat we
[03:35:11.660 --> 03:35:15.140]  also had some other food that we were preparing but we ate MRE's twice a day
[03:35:15.140 --> 03:35:19.180]  and they were great and they worked and but it's not nearly as good as what

[03:35:46.500 --> 03:35:50.100]  issues and I guess this is a health issue this is the health of the economy
[03:35:50.100 --> 03:35:55.020]  health of the world the mental health the the spiritual health of people and
[03:35:55.020 --> 03:36:00.860]  how things are changing and a big bell weather is what happened with Walmart the
[03:36:00.860 --> 03:36:04.620]  big announcement today. Well you know I think I heard from an advertisement on
[03:36:04.620 --> 03:36:10.740]  television that you can buy the American Dream at Walmart for 50% off okay
[03:36:10.740 --> 03:36:17.900]  Walmart is the embodiment of what America has become and I think I really
[03:36:17.900 --> 03:36:21.860]  really believe the age of Walmart is over and I believe Walmart closing its
[03:36:21.860 --> 03:36:26.940]  269 stores today which I understand is only 1% really of their if their annual
[03:36:26.940 --> 03:36:31.580]  you know income I get that it's not that they're over I get that but it's the
[03:36:31.580 --> 03:36:36.980]  beginning of the end for them I believe and I believe it's a micro symbolism of
[03:36:36.980 --> 03:36:41.900]  what's happening in this country and really the world because if you look at
[03:36:41.900 --> 03:36:48.980]  Walmart if you look at the decaying slave good slinging reality that is
[03:36:48.980 --> 03:36:53.140]  Walmart what it is it's the embodiment of everything that we need to stand
[03:36:53.140 --> 03:36:58.700]  against in this country that has taken it over it is the parasite it is the
[03:36:58.700 --> 03:37:05.540]  company that pushes as hard as it can to save you money right by paying Chinese
[03:37:05.540 --> 03:37:10.140]  slave laborers and I have some stories here from international news agencies
[03:37:10.140 --> 03:37:14.420]  about the slave labor from IHS child slave labor news I want to give you an
[03:37:14.420 --> 03:37:20.300]  example what they're really doing but today really marks a change in my view
[03:37:20.300 --> 03:37:25.220]  the age of Walmart is over because we've already decided we're not going to
[03:37:25.220 --> 03:37:28.660]  support them anymore but it's not just the store I want to make that clear it's
[03:37:28.660 --> 03:37:34.820]  the politicians it's the establishment system it's the whole whole shebang that
[03:37:34.820 --> 03:37:40.500]  is done the done the fakeness watching the debates last night you know I gotta
[03:37:40.500 --> 03:37:44.740]  tell you one thing that really makes me mad I don't even care sometimes about
[03:37:44.740 --> 03:37:49.540]  what they're saying as much as they're saying it's so fake so so scripted you
[03:37:49.540 --> 03:37:53.140]  know jeb bush is just a joke but some of the things that Ted Cruz says right he
[03:37:53.140 --> 03:37:56.060]  goes up there he doesn't he doesn't speak like like we're speaking right now
[03:37:56.060 --> 03:38:00.660]  from the heart or anything like that it sounds so canned well you know I believe
[03:38:00.660 --> 03:38:05.300]  in an America people are tired of that crap they want reality we're tired of
[03:38:05.300 --> 03:38:09.940]  buying into our own slavery because the establishment sells us slavery just like
[03:38:09.940 --> 03:38:13.900]  Walmart sells us slavery because when we spend money at Walmart and we support
[03:38:13.900 --> 03:38:19.300]  child slavery we buy into the system we support our own slavery and the TV
[03:38:19.300 --> 03:38:22.740]  reinforces that and so people think that's the way to get the American dream
[03:38:22.740 --> 03:38:27.380]  is to buy imported slave goods so because you're saving money so you can spend it
[03:38:27.380 --> 03:38:30.620]  elsewhere but what people don't realize is that you're also undercutting your
[03:38:30.620 --> 03:38:35.500]  local economy which is a big deal and people are starting to see that local is
[03:38:35.500 --> 03:38:39.060]  better they're not eating out at McDonald's as much anymore you're seeing
[03:38:39.060 --> 03:38:42.980]  other you know restaurants people that serve good food those restaurants are
[03:38:42.980 --> 03:38:49.780]  being a patron by people and it is and in the debates last night who was the
[03:38:49.780 --> 03:38:53.220]  bigger who was the winner of the debate ran Paul and he didn't even show up and
[03:38:53.220 --> 03:38:57.540]  he got the most attention out of anybody he probably is he's probably gonna go up
[03:38:57.540 --> 03:39:00.900]  in the polls as a result of not showing up to the debate and able to get his
[03:39:00.900 --> 03:39:06.060]  ideas out there without listening to John Kasich drone on or Rubio or any of
[03:39:06.060 --> 03:39:09.780]  these other guys just drone on about the same issues over and over again he was
[03:39:09.780 --> 03:39:12.860]  able to take each question they were asked and give an impassioned long form
[03:39:12.860 --> 03:39:17.380]  answer we're just sold over and over again like you just said we're sold the
[03:39:17.380 --> 03:39:22.380]  cheap prices at Walmart is our salvation for American dream we're sold that these
[03:39:22.380 --> 03:39:25.820]  politicians standing up there like plastic figurines reading a teleprompter
[03:39:25.820 --> 03:39:29.460]  that they've rehearsed you know hours and hours for this that's our salvation
[03:39:29.460 --> 03:39:33.940]  that's BS that's complete BS and we're tired of it completely look at this
[03:39:33.940 --> 03:39:38.020]  article from Huffington Post for example corporations working hard to keep
[03:39:38.020 --> 03:39:42.460]  Chinese slave labor and if you actually look at the IHS child slave labor news
[03:39:42.460 --> 03:39:47.980]  website it specifically says it's messed up to Walmart and child slave labor is
[03:39:47.980 --> 03:39:53.300]  the cost worth it in 2003 it was recorded that there were 246 million
[03:39:53.300 --> 03:39:56.820]  child laborers in the world and the number is increasing many companies use
[03:39:56.820 --> 03:39:59.780]  cheap child slave labor in third world countries in order to make a large
[03:39:59.780 --> 03:40:02.860]  profit young children are forced to work in sweat shops and produce shoes
[03:40:02.860 --> 03:40:06.300]  clothing toys and other products Walmart is a huge contributor to this issue
[03:40:06.300 --> 03:40:09.340]  because they encourage the cheap labor in order to save money it's the largest
[03:40:09.340 --> 03:40:12.660]  employer in the United States with over 1 million workers it's the largest food
[03:40:12.660 --> 03:40:16.540]  retailer and the third largest pharmacy the factories in China that Walmart
[03:40:16.540 --> 03:40:20.860]  uses are horrible the average pay in these special economic zones is 3 cents
[03:40:20.860 --> 03:40:24.980]  an hour and even the best workers will receive at most 10 cents an hour there
[03:40:24.980 --> 03:40:29.940]  are some workers who make a profit of 36 cents a month a month not normally
[03:40:29.940 --> 03:40:33.780]  person you know per people cannot survive on this Walmart Walmart workers
[03:40:33.780 --> 03:40:37.220]  are like slaves that suffer unjust treatment at the factory in China
[03:40:37.220 --> 03:40:42.620]  thousands of women work 98 hour weeks but profit less than $22 we got okay
[03:40:42.620 --> 03:40:45.460]  that's let's put that in that's what you're supporting when you go to Walmart
[03:40:45.460 --> 03:40:52.100]  but yeah and let's be clear though too I buy things that are made in China you
[03:40:52.100 --> 03:40:54.820]  buy things that are made in China you can't avoid it pretty much everyone
[03:40:54.820 --> 03:40:59.260]  watching buys things are made in China is that a bad decision yes are we
[03:40:59.260 --> 03:41:04.260]  terrible people know but you know what is terrible the number one producer of
[03:41:04.260 --> 03:41:09.380]  all this according to this is still doing it right and and promoting it
[03:41:09.380 --> 03:41:15.780]  because as this one article I have so intelligently says somewhere in here
[03:41:15.780 --> 03:41:19.460]  scoop like I grabbed it from like it says something along the lines of people
[03:41:19.460 --> 03:41:23.580]  care more about cheap Asian food than Chinese slaves right so they go to
[03:41:23.580 --> 03:41:27.220]  Walmart unfortunately because we're this is the American dream right we go to
[03:41:27.220 --> 03:41:30.980]  Walmart we can get some stir fry for 99 cents instead of going somewhere else
[03:41:30.980 --> 03:41:35.860]  and paying $1.30 well that's a victory that's the American dream but in
[03:41:35.860 --> 03:41:40.420]  reality what's happening is Walmart and the people behind this are the ones
[03:41:40.420 --> 03:41:44.020]  really doing it because we're not we don't know that we're not looking at the
[03:41:44.020 --> 03:41:47.380]  99 cents stir fry and thinking I'm killing children you know it's the people
[03:41:47.380 --> 03:41:50.020]  that have to make the decisions the big executives that have to say well we're
[03:41:50.020 --> 03:41:54.900]  gonna save a million dollars if we pay the kids 20 cents a week as opposed to
[03:41:54.900 --> 03:41:58.700]  actually pay them good wages right have suicide well we'll just put the suicide
[03:41:58.700 --> 03:42:04.100]  nets in there or Apple right yeah so my message though is a victory it's not
[03:42:04.100 --> 03:42:07.700]  trying to be just depressing talking about this I mean the majority of
[03:42:07.700 --> 03:42:11.140]  American see Congress as an out-of-touch corrupt organization according to Gallup
[03:42:11.140 --> 03:42:16.340]  48% 48% say their own representatives are out of touch 32% say their own
[03:42:16.340 --> 03:42:21.340]  members corrupt CBS says why don't Americans trust the government come on
[03:42:21.340 --> 03:42:24.980]  guys why don't you trust the government yeah want to cut government waste five
[03:42:24.980 --> 03:42:29.260]  that find the 8.5 trillion that Pentagon can't account for the the
[03:42:29.260 --> 03:42:34.700]  fakeness in my view the Walmart system that we all live under because again the
[03:42:34.700 --> 03:42:38.540]  establishment is like one embodied in our government collapsing yeah because
[03:42:38.540 --> 03:42:42.460]  we're not gonna buy it anymore we're not buying into our own slavery so I think
[03:42:42.460 --> 03:42:47.380]  the veils is going away and I will say also those stores closing is a sign
[03:42:47.380 --> 03:42:51.780]  that Walmart is on the verge in the beginning of a total collapse in my
[03:42:51.780 --> 03:42:54.660]  view because people aren't buying this and if you look at the executives
[03:42:54.660 --> 03:42:57.460]  responses of Walmart well it's not a big deal it's not a big deal they just keep
[03:42:57.460 --> 03:43:00.580]  saying it over and over again it's not a big deal it's not a big deal the economy
[03:43:00.580 --> 03:43:04.260]  is doing great you're peddling fiction yeah if you say anything otherwise that's
[03:43:04.260 --> 03:43:07.700]  what a boss if you look at the numbers people do want to support local
[03:43:07.700 --> 03:43:11.220]  businesses they don't want to buy the slave goods anymore and they're not
[03:43:11.220 --> 03:43:15.740]  going to stand for it so I declare at the age of Walmart is over and I declare
[03:43:15.740 --> 03:43:19.780]  we are having a victory even with all this messed up stuff going on but the
[03:43:19.780 --> 03:43:23.060]  reality is we're not buying it anymore I saw a meme going around said you know we
[03:43:23.060 --> 03:43:25.860]  declared a war on drugs we have more drugs we declare a war on poverty we
[03:43:25.860 --> 03:43:29.780]  have more more poverty I wish the government would declare a war on
[03:43:29.780 --> 03:43:36.540]  farmers markets we have more farmers markets we know what to do with go guys
[03:43:36.540 --> 03:43:39.220]  if you can pull up the computer again Paul Joseph Watson did it put out a
[03:43:39.220 --> 03:43:44.820]  video a couple days ago why capitalism is great and it's got this girl with the
[03:43:44.820 --> 03:43:50.300]  pink hair and she's flipping off the camera using her iPhone resist cap
[03:43:50.300 --> 03:43:54.180]  hashtag resist capitalism I mean that's what you're dealing with you're
[03:43:54.180 --> 03:43:58.420]  dealing with these young spoiled kids here in the United States that think
[03:43:58.420 --> 03:44:02.460]  everything should be free because you know we should have robots doing it or
[03:44:02.460 --> 03:44:05.580]  it should be free because there's a lot of money going around and there is money
[03:44:05.580 --> 03:44:09.860]  going around you can see the the thumbnail on the computer did it die
[03:44:09.860 --> 03:44:16.580]  over here okay I'll pop it back up real quick but you see like that is just
[03:44:16.580 --> 03:44:21.700]  people are detached and there's a lot of people waking up but people are detached
[03:44:21.700 --> 03:44:25.620]  from what's really going on and how their stuff is made they don't know where
[03:44:25.620 --> 03:44:29.100]  where their chicken comes from they don't know any of this stuff this is a
[03:44:29.100 --> 03:44:32.860]  new age of entitlement right because they've never actually had to go through
[03:44:32.860 --> 03:44:36.020]  the process they just get the end result right so when you don't have to go
[03:44:36.020 --> 03:44:40.580]  through the process of having let's say a horrible job to create financial
[03:44:40.580 --> 03:44:45.220]  stability right you have to clean floors and sweep things and scrub dirty
[03:44:45.220 --> 03:44:48.500]  dishes right like working at a server as a busboy or server
[03:44:48.500 --> 03:44:52.820]  a dish dog that's called a dish dog I worked at a restaurant I was the dish
[03:44:52.820 --> 03:44:56.660]  dog for three months but let's not my way out of it we don't want to sound because
[03:44:56.660 --> 03:45:01.060]  we're not right we're not grumpy old men these this new generation right because
[03:45:01.060 --> 03:45:03.780]  that's not really what it's about it's because anyone can be entitled sure
[03:45:03.780 --> 03:45:08.340]  anyone can act ridiculous like that and not understand the severity of it and I
[03:45:08.340 --> 03:45:10.860]  think it's also because of their insecurities they don't want to open
[03:45:10.860 --> 03:45:14.500]  themselves up to that reality it's like when some people you talk to start
[03:45:14.500 --> 03:45:17.660]  talking about this stuff like the Chinese slave labor I don't want to hear
[03:45:17.660 --> 03:45:21.340]  about that don't tell me about that I don't care I don't care yeah yeah let's
[03:45:21.340 --> 03:45:24.540]  go to Walmart it's there the sad truth is though if they actually read about it
[03:45:24.540 --> 03:45:27.900]  and listen to it they would probably cry and be really upset right they'd be a
[03:45:27.900 --> 03:45:31.660]  upset as I am but they won't let themselves do that they won't accept
[03:45:31.660 --> 03:45:36.580]  that reality right since sometimes that also comes off as snide and rude and
[03:45:36.580 --> 03:45:40.420]  titled which it is in some ways but they also just won't accept that reality
[03:45:40.420 --> 03:45:43.940]  right because they can't they can't because that would shatter their
[03:45:43.940 --> 03:45:48.380]  illusion that the establishment gave them the Walmart dream from birth they
[03:45:48.380 --> 03:45:52.380]  bought the American dream of Walmart from birth and the dream that they have
[03:45:52.380 --> 03:45:55.300]  that everything is great everything's fine and as long as you have your new
[03:45:55.300 --> 03:45:59.980]  iPhone who cares exactly or being able to go to the movies or get a new pair of
[03:45:59.980 --> 03:46:04.700]  jeans all this stuff is made by these people in third-world countries and we
[03:46:04.700 --> 03:46:09.460]  do have to seriously examine that and one way to do that is to also start
[03:46:09.460 --> 03:46:12.380]  businesses here in the United States even though your tax to the gills at
[03:46:12.380 --> 03:46:16.620]  doing it but it's people working hard is what made this country great all right
[03:46:16.620 --> 03:46:21.300]  there's nothing nothing else nothing was handed to us all right we did steal
[03:46:21.300 --> 03:46:27.420]  some land from the Indians but nothing was done in terms of like nothing was
[03:46:27.420 --> 03:46:30.780]  given to us everything you know I'm there's some show on Netflix where
[03:46:30.780 --> 03:46:34.460]  they're building the railroad across the United States all right they had to lay
[03:46:34.460 --> 03:46:39.740]  it one step at a time one it didn't happen overnight but they laid a rail
[03:46:39.740 --> 03:46:43.220]  and then they laid another rail and then they get to a bridge and they built a
[03:46:43.220 --> 03:46:46.420]  bridge and it doesn't happen overnight none of this stuff people think that
[03:46:46.420 --> 03:46:49.700]  stuff's gonna happen like them these people who are running to that 7-11 and
[03:46:49.700 --> 03:46:52.740]  jumping around like we won well they didn't win anything they were
[03:46:52.740 --> 03:46:55.540]  celebrating with the guy who had the powerball tickets even you guys can pull
[03:46:55.540 --> 03:46:59.300]  that up they're jumping around like their winners they didn't win anything and
[03:46:59.300 --> 03:47:04.660]  they it's this instant gratification this instant entitlement society that is
[03:47:04.660 --> 03:47:09.220]  slowly people are say we've reached it's it's reached the peak of what it is now
[03:47:09.220 --> 03:47:13.180]  we're gonna start seeing the fall and I agree with you I think maybe in 10 years
[03:47:13.180 --> 03:47:18.220]  we might see you know hat Walmart's at 50% of what it was you know McDonald's is
[03:47:18.220 --> 03:47:22.660]  that 40% of what it was and people as they start making better decisions how
[03:47:22.660 --> 03:47:27.640]  they spend their dollars and how they spend their time you're gonna see the
[03:47:27.640 --> 03:47:30.460]  system change on its own it's not gonna happen overnight it's not gonna happen
[03:47:30.460 --> 03:47:33.200]  with an election either people think it's gonna happen in the presidential
[03:47:33.200 --> 03:47:36.340]  election it ain't gonna happen well see here's my view on this I think the age
[03:47:36.340 --> 03:47:40.140]  of information has already come people already get it people already have the
[03:47:40.140 --> 03:47:44.700]  information now it's the time of action the age of solutions the age of action
[03:47:44.700 --> 03:47:48.900]  2016 opens the new door for actions and solutions and real results because we
[03:47:48.900 --> 03:47:52.620]  already know what's screwed up in the world we get that now now it's time to
[03:47:52.620 --> 03:47:56.300]  equip the information and do something about it and you talk about money right
[03:47:56.300 --> 03:48:00.420]  you talk about entrepreneurship you talk about all that stuff I did a segment
[03:48:00.420 --> 03:48:03.460]  when I hosted the fourth hour last time called the truth about money and here's
[03:48:03.460 --> 03:48:06.380]  here's the ridiculousness of the entitlement society they want
[03:48:06.380 --> 03:48:09.260]  everything they want everything I mean they they want everything they want the
[03:48:09.260 --> 03:48:13.820]  new iPhone just like Watson's awesome video they want all of it but if you try
[03:48:13.820 --> 03:48:16.740]  to build anything and you're not the establishment here's the key part you're
[03:48:16.740 --> 03:48:21.740]  not the establishment oh my god we can't trust that what like you just want to

[03:55:32.140 --> 03:55:34.940]  is interesting and this is a story of a company going hey you know what we got a
[03:55:34.940 --> 03:55:39.860]  reboot here Chipotle had that that was that outbreak of food poisoning where
[03:55:39.860 --> 03:55:42.900]  people are getting sick I think it was E. Coli they were getting up and started
[03:55:42.900 --> 03:55:47.900]  up in Seattle in Washington and now on February 8th they're gonna close
[03:55:47.900 --> 03:55:51.900]  company-wide and have food safety meetings they hired a food safety expert
[03:55:51.900 --> 03:55:56.380]  they're gonna get together have their safety meetings and really work on
[03:55:56.380 --> 03:56:00.340]  making it safe for people to eat there and you know their stocks gone down they
[03:56:00.340 --> 03:56:02.700]  didn't go oh we're gonna close a bunch of stores and they have a bunch of people
[03:56:02.700 --> 03:56:06.300]  we're gonna regroup and come back even stronger and sometimes it takes that take
[03:56:06.300 --> 03:56:09.740]  a step back you find something wrong in the process and then you take two steps
[03:56:09.740 --> 03:56:12.700]  forward because nothing is perfect nothing is ever gonna be perfect and
[03:56:12.700 --> 03:56:16.340]  nothing is gonna change you know overnight but they're they're literally
[03:56:16.340 --> 03:56:20.180]  gonna try to attempt that on February 8th change overnight and just go boom
[03:56:20.180 --> 03:56:25.540]  we're gonna reset come back with a new attitude and you know let's let's I wish
[03:56:25.540 --> 03:56:29.220]  them the best because I like Chipotle so strong opinions are best held very
[03:56:29.220 --> 03:56:33.020]  weekly right so if I come into something and I see it's Chipotle oh it's a big
[03:56:33.020 --> 03:56:36.460]  corporation they're instantly bad right we can't always hold those views oh
[03:56:36.460 --> 03:56:40.020]  that's so terrible Chipotle has actually handled things really really well mm-hmm
[03:56:40.020 --> 03:56:43.180]  I'm sure they're covering their butts in a lot of ways but looking at the GMO
[03:56:43.180 --> 03:56:45.540]  issue where they said hey we don't know exactly what's going on but our
[03:56:45.540 --> 03:56:48.740]  customers are pretty freaked out by GMOs overall so we're gonna do our best to
[03:56:48.740 --> 03:56:53.500]  get rid of them a plus hey we antibiotics yeah the antibiotics they're
[03:56:53.500 --> 03:56:56.940]  actually doing things that matter and changing things and they have a huge
[03:56:56.940 --> 03:56:59.820]  pull on a huge leeway and they're feeding millions of people so they're
[03:56:59.820 --> 03:57:03.740]  directly impacting the lives and health of millions of people Chipotle overall
[03:57:03.740 --> 03:57:07.100]  is doing a good job it's the it's the complete opposite of Walmart the Walmart
[03:57:07.100 --> 03:57:13.740]  strategy would have been no one got sick here what what that's absurd let's open
[03:57:13.740 --> 03:57:16.940]  the hatch open the hatch you know that the Walmart strategy would have just been
[03:57:16.940 --> 03:57:20.740]  reduced pay or something absurd like that you know shut down all the stores and
[03:57:20.740 --> 03:57:24.580]  instead of doing the one Chinese factory with the dead pig sludge everywhere
[03:57:24.580 --> 03:57:29.780]  go next door or something exactly now here's speaking of GM products FDA gives
[03:57:29.780 --> 03:57:35.700]  okay for companies genetically engineered potato and in a letter to to to
[03:57:35.700 --> 03:57:39.620]  Idaho based JR Simplot the FDA said the potatoes isn't substantially different
[03:57:39.620 --> 03:57:43.340]  in composition or safety from other products already on the market that
[03:57:43.340 --> 03:57:47.380]  so FDA just said it's good and you know there's no evidence they say in
[03:57:47.380 --> 03:57:49.740]  continuing this article there's no evidence that genetically modified
[03:57:49.740 --> 03:57:54.420]  organisms known as GMOs are unsafe to eat but there is an ethical issue and I
[03:57:54.420 --> 03:57:57.420]  think the ethical issue is they're taking genes from other things and
[03:57:57.420 --> 03:58:00.020]  splicing them into each other it's not like we're taking two potatoes and
[03:58:00.020 --> 03:58:05.580]  mating you know they're taking insect genes they're taking glyphosate resisted
[03:58:05.580 --> 03:58:10.100]  genes I mean people really need I think the GMO thing is really gonna come to
[03:58:10.100 --> 03:58:14.700]  a head this year we saw some victories we saw some setbacks last year but 2016
[03:58:14.700 --> 03:58:18.540]  is a new year right Anthony and we're going to take the fight to them on the
[03:58:18.540 --> 03:58:23.020]  GMO front 2016 is a new year it's the age of solutions in action what are you
[03:58:23.020 --> 03:58:26.580]  doing out there hmm what are you doing out there to make changes in your life
