[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:24.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  We are live, my friends.
[00:26.000 --> 00:29.000]  It is Tuesday, the fifth day of October 2010.
[00:29.000 --> 00:36.000]  I'm honored that four Minnesota governor, movie star, mayor, talk show host,
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.000]  and the star of the number one hit on TruTV, Conspiracy Theory,
[00:41.000 --> 00:44.000]  back for its second season premiering here in just about a week and a half.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  Governor Jesse Ventura joins us.
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.000]  He kicked off the promotion yesterday with a USA Today interview
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.000]  and talking to some major newspapers, but this is his first big radio interview
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  as he gets ready to promote the television show.
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  Of course, I know a lot about the show, but most of it is secret.
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.000]  And so he joins us today to be able to talk about as much as he can,
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  some of the harassment they've gone through, what's coming up in the episodes.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  We'll also get into all these new terror alerts just ahead of the election.
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.000]  And we're going to talk about the economy, a host of issues with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:17.000 --> 01:18.000]  Jesse, good to have you with us.
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  Hi, Alex. How are you doing?
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  Should I get off on the right foot with all you Texans?
[01:23.000 --> 01:24.000]  Sure.
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  What the hell happened when you played UCLA?
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  Yeah, UT didn't do too well, did they?
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  Boy, that's one of the worst showings of the Texas football team
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  that I can recall in my memory, especially at home.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  You guys are usually unbeatable in Austin or Dallas, as the case was.
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.000]  Where did you end up playing them?
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.000]  Well, I forgot to mention you did XFL and NFL, didn't you?
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  Yeah, I did three years of the National Football League, two at Tampa Bay Radio
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  and one with the Vikings, and then I did one year that the XFL existed.
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  Well, football is football, you know?
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  It's just played at different levels by the professionals that do it,
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  but it's still the same game, whether you're playing it at junior high or high school
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  or all the way to the pros.
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  When we were down in New Orleans after we were done doing our investigation,
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  I had to fly out the next morning.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  You were there for a few more days to continue your investigation.
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  Did you ever get a chance to go to that Vikings and Saints game?
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  Well, I had the opportunity to go, but unfortunately the show came first
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  and we had gone out that day way out to the tip of the glass,
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  which is a few hours drive from New Orleans.
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  And unfortunately, I didn't get back until they were actually kicking it off
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  and by then, you know, you shot with us in the heat down there.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  I was pretty exhausted, so I took the easy way out.
[02:50.000 --> 02:54.000]  I just went up to my hotel room and watched it on TV.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  Well, a lot is happening.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  We're going to break in a moment, but I want to get into the show.
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  I mean, obviously I've been a consultant and I appear in quite a few of the episodes
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.000]  that are coming up, but I have to say if the last season was shocking and informative
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  from what I've seen, it looks like this one's shaping up to even be more hardcore.
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  I think so. I think the topics are even, I don't know how you say they're better,
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  but more exciting even.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  And the other thing on the production and on our end of it,
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  any time you go from your first season to your second season,
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  you're going to iron out some of the rough edges.
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  You're going to do better on the focus of what you're trying to accomplish.
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  And so a second season is always the first season to do it a show like this.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  You kind of fly by the seat of your pants.
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  The second season, you have a good idea of what works and what doesn't work
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  and how to go about getting the information we need to get.
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.000]  So I think it's always a work in progress and hopefully always an improved work in progress.
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.000]  When we come back, we'll get into as many of the episodes as we can
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  and squeeze as much info as we can out of you, Governor.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  But a quick question, what's your favorite episode right now?
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  Well, I suppose my favorite would have to be JFK,
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  because that's the one that, you know, has had my passion for 30 odd years now
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  of reading and studying about it.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  So that's the one that really strikes home with me.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  And also because my feelings about JFK are this.
[04:31.000 --> 04:38.000]  If a coup d'etat could happen, if you can remove a president, power president,
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  and get away with it, well, what can't you do that?
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  Let's see, that's what to me lays the table for anything that comes later.
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.000]  If you can do that, Alex, what can't you do?
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest for the full hour.
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.000]  We're going to come right back and continue with the JFK investigation he's conducted.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  He's got some groundbreaking information.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[05:14.000 --> 05:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[05:52.000 --> 05:56.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[05:56.000 --> 06:00.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[06:00.000 --> 06:03.000]  Listen up, friends. This is Alex Jones with key information.
[06:03.000 --> 06:07.000]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[06:07.000 --> 06:10.000]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[06:10.000 --> 06:15.000]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[06:15.000 --> 06:21.000]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating with a ton of great food to choose from.
[06:21.000 --> 06:26.000]  It's all fresh and made on a monthly basis, not some old, cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[06:26.000 --> 06:31.000]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran the next three months,
[06:36.000 --> 06:39.000]  the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  The place to go is eFoodsDirect.com.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  Go to their website online right now.
[06:46.000 --> 06:52.000]  eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[06:52.000 --> 07:00.000]  Again, on the web, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[07:04.000 --> 07:05.000]  tyranny is here.
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[07:11.000 --> 07:17.000]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[07:17.000 --> 07:23.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cares, now being expanded nationwide.
[07:23.000 --> 07:29.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[07:38.000 --> 07:44.000]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[07:49.000 --> 07:50.000]  It's here.

[08:09.000 --> 08:16.000]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is here with us today kicking off the promotion.
[08:16.000 --> 08:21.000]  We're honored to have him for the second season of conspiracy theory.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  Here's USA Today's headline.
[08:24.000 --> 08:32.000]  Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory raises further questions and it's a pretty balanced report here.
[08:32.000 --> 08:39.000]  It's going to be kicking off October 15th, 10 p.m. Eastern time, 9 p.m. Central on TruTV.
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  It was the number one hit show last year and I had so many people saying only eight episodes.
[08:44.000 --> 08:50.000]  We want more. I've gotten so many emails, so many calls, so many people on the street have said,
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  you know, bring back the show and now that the second season has been announced,
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  people are calling me saying, will there be a third season, Jesse?
[08:58.000 --> 08:59.000]  I don't know.
[08:59.000 --> 09:08.000]  You know, again, this is cable or satellite television so it runs differently than regular network TV
[09:08.000 --> 09:16.000]  and the fact that they buy them by, for lack of better term, the lots, like they bought seven and they bought eight
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.000]  and that's the way they do it there.
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  It's not like a yearly thing like network TV does and all that.
[09:22.000 --> 09:27.000]  So whether they could order another eight of them at any moment, they could do it today
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.000]  or they could wait till the conclusion or whatever and because that's the way it's done in cable television.
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  What if network TV wanted to say, give you Larry King's show because I know people talked about that
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  or wanted you to do a broadcast.
[09:40.000 --> 09:46.000]  You're going to put me to replace Larry King, right?
[09:46.000 --> 09:55.000]  Well, what if you got offered a broadcast television show? Would you even accept it or is Mexico too much fun?
[09:55.000 --> 10:00.000]  I don't know. You know, again, it's one of those hypotheticals, Alex, that until it happens,
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  I'm not going to even bother thinking about it because there's nothing happening right now that indicates that
[10:07.000 --> 10:14.000]  and so I just keep doing what I do and now if it does rear its head, well, then I'll have to sit down
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  and make the decision on what I prefer to do.
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.000]  Getting back into the television show, for stations that just joined us,
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.000]  we were talking about your favorite of the eight episodes of your investigations being the JFK
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  and I'm privy to some of the groundbreaking research you guys have done and know how much you can get into
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  but you were making the point that if they can kill a president in broad daylight and get away with it,
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.000]  they can do anything and that's basically what Bruce Willis told Vanity Fair last year.
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  He said, you know, my whole views changed since I researched JFK
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.000]  because clearly the same people that killed him are in control today.
[10:49.000 --> 10:57.000]  Well, it seems so. You're going to see a lot of tie-ins and I'll just say this and I'll be real open about it.
[10:57.000 --> 11:03.000]  Through a great majority of our investigations and shows, these eight shows,
[11:03.000 --> 11:09.000]  in a great deal of them at some point, at some point during the investigation,
[11:09.000 --> 11:12.000]  Palo Burton shows up.
[11:12.000 --> 11:19.000]  It's amazing the tentacles that this company has into our foreign affairs
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.000]  and things that are going on with our country.
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.000]  It seems along with our country right below the United States comes the word Hallibur.
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.000]  And of course we all know who operates and runs that.
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  Good old Mr. Cheney.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  Yeah, and I mean it's amazing.
[11:39.000 --> 11:45.000]  Every time I do it, the conspiracy theory, a great majority of them,
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.000]  at some point paperwork will lead us to Hallibur.
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  When you were down here in Texas, I don't know how much we can get into ahead of the show,
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.000]  but I tell you, that was amazing at that particular facility.
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, they all are.
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  And you know, and I'll go into like in the JFK situation,
[12:06.000 --> 12:12.000]  people I want them to tune in the show because they will hear the first confession.
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.000]  And believe me, Lee Oswell's been dead for a long time, so it certainly isn't him, would it be?
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000]  So you know, that's the main thing I answer on JFK.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  Here's the big question as well.
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  What will your show this year that's new?
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.000]  And I think the confession is pretty dynamic.
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  Doing your in-depth, I mean you've been studying the JFK assassination for decades.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  Your new books got several very informative chapters.
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.000]  American conspiracies that by the way we carry at infowars.com if folks want to get it.
[12:47.000 --> 12:54.000]  But did your investigation just confirm your previous research or did it cause you to question?
[12:54.000 --> 13:01.000]  No, I think it confirmed what I've believed in studying that particular conspiracy for many, many years.
[13:01.000 --> 13:06.000]  I felt very vindicated and kind of sat back and thought, gee, I was right.
[13:06.000 --> 13:13.000]  You know, I noticed consulting and traveling around the country to a few places, whether you're out here in Texas,
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.000]  that over and over again it was a mirror of last season, like when you were at Harp,
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  when they hide inside the buildings and won't come out.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  I mean, they act very suspicious.
[13:23.000 --> 13:30.000]  Oh, it's terrible. I mean, we went to one place that they call a residence.
[13:30.000 --> 13:36.000]  And I mean, I've been a governor and I've traveled to state prisons before,
[13:36.000 --> 13:42.000]  and I could not distinguish between the two except for the name on the front of the building.
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.000]  A residence center with barbed wire and playscapes for children.
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  Yeah, and that was the real, and then the response is no comment.
[13:52.000 --> 14:00.000]  I mean, the thing that I hope people get out of this is that we can't even ask our government a question,
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  let alone expect them to give us an answer.
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.000]  That's the great big story I'm learning and doing this show.
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.000]  And I find that very offensive, Alex, because we are the ones that pay.
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  We're the taxpayers and I'm sure I can compare South Minneapolis to Texas.
[14:19.000 --> 14:26.000]  The way it worked when I grew up in South Minneapolis is if you're paying out the money, that makes you the boss.
[14:26.000 --> 14:27.000]  Yes.
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  And somehow we've lost sight of that, that we are the boss.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  We are the ones that pay the money taxes.
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  These people work on our money, so therefore we should be the boss.
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  Now, I understand that sure you've got national security issues,
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  sure you've got things that you have to protect as a government.
[14:48.000 --> 14:56.000]  I've been on both sides of the fence, but the point is unless it deals with something of total national security,
[14:56.000 --> 15:03.000]  why can't we, we don't have to know the details, but certainly they can admit to what things are.
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  Like, I'll tie it in with area 51.
[15:06.000 --> 15:14.000]  I mean, everybody knows there's a base there, yet the government officially denies one exists.
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  Now, what type of nonsense is that?
[15:17.000 --> 15:24.000]  My tax dollars pay for that secret base out there, and I think I have every right to know it exists,
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  and I think I have every right to be protected from it.
[15:27.000 --> 15:37.000]  This base out there has no gate, it has no distinguished markings that indicate that you're trespassing on a government base,
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.000]  and yet there's a sign there that says they can use lethal force.
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  Well, look at what's happened.
[15:43.000 --> 15:49.000]  That's very disturbing, Alex. They can kill you for trespassing, technically.
[15:49.000 --> 15:57.000]  Well, going back to 1947, Governor, they made the national security state through the National Security Act,
[15:57.000 --> 16:01.000]  and since then, tens of trillions of dollars go into a secret black hole.
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.000]  Trillions are missing from the Pentagon under Clinton, Bush, and now Obama.
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  They tell Congress in the C-SPAN hearings, we won't say where the money went.
[16:09.000 --> 16:14.000]  Foreign banks have stolen trillions in the bailout. They won't say where the money went.
[16:14.000 --> 16:21.000]  Exactly. I mean, this is the biggest case of criminal white collar crime there could possibly be.
[16:21.000 --> 16:22.000]  Let's talk about that.
[16:22.000 --> 16:29.000]  It's simply as basic as this, Alex. We can't even have a paper trail.
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  We can't even get a receipt, like going to an ATM.
[16:33.000 --> 16:41.000]  An ATM at least offers you a receipt, something that you can have in the palm of your hand that says you did what you did.
[16:41.000 --> 16:47.000]  We can't even get a receipt from our government over the millions and trillions of dollars.
[16:47.000 --> 16:53.000]  And I have to laugh when the debate gets to healthcare and they talk about paying for it.
[16:53.000 --> 17:01.000]  Alex, if we just accounted for all the money in these two wars and all the rest of it they spend on this crap,
[17:01.000 --> 17:06.000]  we could pay for healthcare to where we don't probably have our own doctor living in the garage.
[17:06.000 --> 17:16.000]  Well, yeah, that's true. The total defense budget is $2 trillion every year, $1 trillion on record and another $800 plus billion on top of that.
[17:16.000 --> 17:25.000]  Governor, speaking about secrecy and all of this, we were talking about Congress keeps asking the banks, where's the money?
[17:25.000 --> 17:30.000]  And they say we won't tell you. You did do a big investigation on Wall Street. Talk about that.
[17:30.000 --> 17:38.000]  Well, Wall Street was the one that I thought was going to be the most difficult show because it's so...
[17:38.000 --> 17:43.000]  I mean, these power brokers and their money, they know how to put up the smoke screens.
[17:43.000 --> 17:55.000]  They are professional at doing that, of making things so convoluted, so hard to understand and that's how they get away with it.
[17:55.000 --> 18:03.000]  But it turns out, from all indications, people are telling me the Wall Street show could be the best of the lot.
[18:03.000 --> 18:13.000]  Because they said we managed to break it down into a simplistic form to where everyone out there will truly understand what happened.
[18:13.000 --> 18:18.000]  Give us as much of an insight into the episode as you can without giving it all away.
[18:18.000 --> 18:29.000]  Well, just that we go out there and we deal with people, some of them are going to prison and these are people that are at best mid-level.
[18:29.000 --> 18:34.000]  And yet we're made to believe that these are the culprits.
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.000]  Remember this about the whole Wall Street debilical.
[18:39.000 --> 18:44.000]  The people going to jail are not the ones truly responsible.
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.000]  Some were caught up in the middle of all this mess and really had no way to get out of it.
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.000]  And they're the ones that are going to fall on the sword and go to the slammer.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  Well, they always burn a few underlings.
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  Sure, and that's what you're going to see on our show.
[18:58.000 --> 19:07.000]  We talked to a few of these underlings and I'll tell you they're very vocal because they're not very happy that they're the ones that are going to jail.
[19:07.000 --> 19:11.000]  And the big criminals are walking away scot-free and more wealthy.
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  Well, I know a little bit about the show and the research.
[19:14.000 --> 19:18.000]  It's bombshell and are you worried again like you were last year?
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  Do you have any private bets with the crew that this may not air?
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  No, I have full cons.
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  I'll be stunned this year if it doesn't.
[19:25.000 --> 19:31.000]  They put everything on last year and there's no indication I've gotten whatsoever.
[19:31.000 --> 19:40.000]  In fact, Mark Juris, who's the head of 2TV, he told me when I told him about my gentleman's bet, he told me eye to eye.
[19:40.000 --> 19:46.000]  He said, I can assure you, Governor, there wasn't one discussion about your show not going on.
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  Well, that's another big question.
[19:48.000 --> 19:49.000]  They've denied world government.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  They've denied CIA drug trafficking.
[19:51.000 --> 19:58.000]  They've denied human experimentation, giving people syphilis all over the United States and Latin America our own government.
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  Now they just pretty much admit it.
[20:00.000 --> 20:06.000]  Like three months ago, the CIA came out in the Washington Post and said, yeah, we put out fake bin Laden videos.
[20:06.000 --> 20:09.000]  And then now they have Robert Shapiro who works with them.
[20:09.000 --> 20:18.000]  That's because Alex is so arrogant now because we sit back and I guess they figure there's nothing we can do about it anyway.
[20:18.000 --> 20:21.000]  That's the only conclusion I can come to.
[20:21.000 --> 20:24.000]  I agree with you, but I think it's several things.
[20:24.000 --> 20:31.000]  It's also that the alternative media has now overall displaced even the mainstream media and they can't deny this anymore.
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  So to keep any credibility, they just have to basically admit some of this.
[20:36.000 --> 20:39.000]  I agree with you on that aspect too.
[20:39.000 --> 20:43.000]  Certainly alternative media is the only hope we got.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  And that was my next question.
[20:45.000 --> 20:50.000]  I'm sure you've seen in the news, but it was in the BBC last week, inventor of the Internet.
[20:50.000 --> 20:51.000]  No, it's not Al Gore.
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  The real inventor came out.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  Guys, Google that and put it on screen for me.
[20:55.000 --> 21:01.000]  Inventor of Internet came out and said the Internet is being shut down incrementally with this cyber security.
[21:01.000 --> 21:10.000]  And I noticed that they admit now in the media that Israel launched this worm that attacked Iran and China and others.
[21:10.000 --> 21:18.000]  But then the government came out and said, see, we need cyber security to take over the infrastructure of the web and spy on you because of this new worm.
[21:18.000 --> 21:23.000]  The government launches the attack and then says we need to take your rights to keep you safe.
[21:23.000 --> 21:34.000]  Oh, of course, that's standard operating procedure. You know, people need to understand clearly that whenever government tells you they're going to protect you and keep you safe,
[21:34.000 --> 21:40.000]  the only way they can achieve that is by putting you under, by taking your freedoms.
[21:40.000 --> 21:50.000]  And I personally, and I'm speaking only for myself, I would rather have my freedoms and face the fears of life
[21:50.000 --> 21:58.000]  than I would to be given this cozy safety net underneath a domain that allows me no freedom.
[21:58.000 --> 22:05.000]  There's a new report out from Tennessee where a guy in the county didn't pay a $75 fire department tax.
[22:05.000 --> 22:12.000]  So they came out and watched his house burn, but then put the neighbors out because that house then caught the neighbor's house on fire.
[22:12.000 --> 22:20.000]  Whatever happened to the laws about failure to render aid? If I'm driving down the street and somebody's just had a car wreck and I don't stop and help them, I can go to prison.
[22:20.000 --> 22:32.000]  But now under privatization, our taxes go up, but they're laying off police, firemen, and they're saying if you don't pay all these new fees, when your house is burning, we're not going to put it out.
[22:32.000 --> 22:42.000]  Well, indeed, that's a total shame and we should be embarrassed that something like that could happen.
[22:42.000 --> 22:51.000]  Well, read what I brought up in my USA Today article, Alex. I mean, I'm sure I'm going to get plenty of flack over this.
[22:51.000 --> 23:07.000]  I said far more important than building a mosque in New York City is I would like to ask why religion doesn't have to pay property taxes for the services that they receive and are rendered on an equal basis that all the rest of us have to pay for,
[23:07.000 --> 23:19.000]  which is fire, police, and the maintenance of your streets. How come churches get that for free?
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  Well, I'll say this.
[23:21.000 --> 23:30.000]  All the rest of us have to pay when they're getting me. I mean, if someone disrupts church, a policeman will come in at the call and take care of it.
[23:30.000 --> 23:39.000]  If the church catches on fire, the fire department will put it out, and if they need their roads plowed up in Minnesota, the public plows do it.
[23:39.000 --> 23:43.000]  How come they don't have to pay and everybody else does?
[23:43.000 --> 23:50.000]  Well, I'll say this because in the First Amendment, it says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting it for exercise thereof.
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  And I agree with that.
[23:52.000 --> 23:59.000]  There's nothing to do with that. This is called getting services from the public domain on a piece of property.
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.000]  Well, I'll be honest.
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  I don't have nothing to do with restricting religion.
[24:04.000 --> 24:11.000]  No, no, I'll be honest with you with the power to taxes, the power to destroy. I didn't know that churches didn't have to pay for the fire department.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  They don't have to pay for nothing.
[24:14.000 --> 24:28.000]  At least in Minnesota, maybe in Texas they do, but I can unequivocally tell you in Minnesota, the way our property tax system, and I think it's the same everywhere, religious places don't have to pay nothing.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  Well, I'll say this.
[24:31.000 --> 24:42.000]  The reason they didn't want that, because if the government starts having taxes, they can then have tax incentives like George Bush's faith-based initiative where the government starts paying churches and this is...
[24:42.000 --> 24:50.000]  Alex, this is apples and oranges. This is owning property and getting public services brought to that property.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  No, no, I understand what you're saying.
[24:52.000 --> 25:08.000]  To me, you can't absolve them of that just for fear of the other. That shouldn't happen. These are buildings, these are properties that get services from the public domain, which we all chip in and pay for.
[25:08.000 --> 25:21.000]  Okay, if you're an atheist, why should your tax dollars, if you don't believe in God and you don't believe in any of that, why should your tax dollars go to pay for those places to get services rendered?
[25:21.000 --> 25:29.000]  No, no, I see your point. Just like in Travis County, why should I have to pay money to pay for elective abortions? And that's the problem.
[25:29.000 --> 25:37.000]  Once we get a big government period, then a lot of us are forced to be paying for things that we don't want.
[25:37.000 --> 25:45.000]  Well, no, it's not even don't want. If it's out there, anyone that uses it should be required to participate.
[25:45.000 --> 25:56.000]  That's the difference, Alex. They're using it. It's being provided and they're not having to pay for that participation. Why?
[25:56.000 --> 26:08.000]  Now, it's an interesting point. Why do they get off free? Why does all the rest of us have to pay? And like I said, if you're an atheist, you have to pay and this entity doesn't.
[26:08.000 --> 26:20.000]  And it's not getting into abortion or anything like that. It's doing daily things that happen in life that are required to be done. How come they get a free ride on it?
[26:20.000 --> 26:29.000]  Well, it's a powerful lobby, but I do see your point. Shifting gears on another subject. You talk about your father, even before people were protesting the Vietnam War.
[26:29.000 --> 26:37.000]  And of course, he was a highly decorated World War II veteran. He was criticizing the Vietnam War beforehand. You talk about your father in USA today.
[26:37.000 --> 26:44.000]  Oh, yeah. No, I just told them the story about how my dad, I would come home with the teachings that they were teaching me in school.
[26:44.000 --> 26:56.000]  And my father and I would be at the dinner table and have battles over it because he didn't feel we were being told the real truth in school and it turned out he was correct.
[26:56.000 --> 27:08.000]  And I always like to laugh about it today. My dad died in 91, but I always tell people, you know, it's amazing. He died in 91, but he gets smarter every day.
[27:08.000 --> 27:22.000]  The things he told me growing up, now that I'm 59 years old, I'm looking back and remembering how extremely bright this man was about world affairs.
[27:22.000 --> 27:31.000]  And here's a guy that only went to eighth grade. He was a World War II veteran and worked his whole life as a street laborer.
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  He knew a lot of stuff.
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.000]  Well, it's sad that so many of that great generation are dying off both my grandfathers, of course, World War II veterans.
[27:41.000 --> 27:48.000]  And when we're out on the road driving around or in airports, you talk a lot about your dad and those lessons he taught you.
[27:48.000 --> 27:55.000]  Briefly, get into that story about he was really too old to even join the military and all the combat he saw.
[27:55.000 --> 28:00.000]  Well, he, my dad went into age 36, which was the oldest you could possibly be.
[28:00.000 --> 28:12.000]  And he, I think, six bronze battle stars. He was North Africa, then Normandy, Battle of the Bell, Dramagen Bridge, Anzio, and finally Berlin.
[28:12.000 --> 28:20.000]  And he got out of four years and got out. And the fun part of the story is when he got into his latter sixties,
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.000]  my aunt went back to Pennsylvania to the coal mining towns where he was born.
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  And they discovered his birth certificate that turned out he was a year older than he thought he was.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  So he was too old to even be in, really?
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  Yeah, he technically was too old to be allowed in the military.
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  Or maybe he knew and just lied to go anyway. I don't know.
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.000]  And your mom was in the war too?
[28:44.000 --> 28:50.000]  Yeah, my mom was a nurse in North Africa. And she served in North Africa.
[28:50.000 --> 28:57.000]  And the amazing thing about her was as she got old, every night they'd do the reruns of MASH.
[28:57.000 --> 29:02.000]  And she would watch the evening news and never miss MASH right after it before she'd go to bed.
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.000]  Which was probably very similar because MASH was Korea.
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.000]  And it was probably very similar to, you know, just a few years earlier in North Africa.
[29:10.000 --> 29:14.000]  And of course, your dad being in the European Theater and the North African,
[29:14.000 --> 29:19.000]  that was really the toughest battles, they say, statistically, was against Erwin Rommel, the Desert Fox.
[29:19.000 --> 29:23.000]  Yeah, that's what they say, you know, on the knowledge that I have of it.
[29:23.000 --> 29:28.000]  And, you know, knowing that my mom and dad were both in North Africa against Rommel,
[29:28.000 --> 29:32.000]  who was probably the best Nazi general by whatever, all accounts.
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  I mean, didn't Hitler have him killed in the end or something?
[29:34.000 --> 29:39.000]  Yeah, he was jealous of him because Rommel was secretly trying to work with folks to get rid of Hitler.
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[29:41.000 --> 29:44.000]  The new show premieres the 15th of October.
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  We're going to come back, get more into the show, a bunch of the news, all these new fake terror alerts.
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.000]  Stay with us.
[29:50.000 --> 29:54.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.000 --> 30:08.000]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions.
[30:08.000 --> 30:16.000]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[30:16.000 --> 30:21.000]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[30:21.000 --> 30:26.000]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[30:26.000 --> 30:34.000]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[30:34.000 --> 30:42.000]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[30:42.000 --> 30:49.000]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.000]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[30:52.000 --> 30:56.000]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[30:56.000 --> 31:00.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[31:00.000 --> 31:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[31:05.000 --> 31:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[31:08.000 --> 31:13.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[31:13.000 --> 31:19.000]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our President and Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[31:19.000 --> 31:24.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[31:24.000 --> 31:35.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[31:35.000 --> 31:41.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[31:41.000 --> 31:48.000]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[31:48.000 --> 31:59.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[32:19.000 --> 32:24.000]  Number 3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[32:24.000 --> 32:28.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:28.000 --> 32:31.000]  Number 4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[32:31.000 --> 32:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[32:35.000 --> 32:40.000]  Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[32:40.000 --> 32:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.

[33:06.000 --> 33:11.000]  Hi, this is former Governor Jesse Ventura and this is the Alex Jones Show.
[33:11.000 --> 33:17.000]  I recommend you all pay attention to Alex because Alex and I are teaming up again this fall
[33:17.000 --> 33:24.000]  for a second season of conspiracy theory where we will attempt to get to the bottom of these conspiracies.
[33:24.000 --> 33:28.000]  Until then, keep watching and listening to Alex.
[33:28.000 --> 33:43.000]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[33:43.000 --> 33:50.000]  Thomas Jefferson. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:50.000 --> 33:57.000]  Well, the man himself, the iconic Jesse Ventura is our guest for the rest of this hour.
[33:57.000 --> 34:05.000]  We appreciate him giving us the first radio interview as he kicks off the promotion for the second season of conspiracy theory.
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.000]  Jesse, do you know yet what the first episode is going to be, what they're going to air for?
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.000]  I can't tell you it's in stone, but I think the first one is Plum Island.
[34:15.000 --> 34:19.000]  Let's talk about Plum Island, then we'll get into water. That's another episode.
[34:19.000 --> 34:25.000]  Yeah, well, Plum Island, what's interesting about that, of course, is it's located right on the end of Long Island.
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  And really what intrigues you about it is to go into the history of it.
[34:30.000 --> 34:39.000]  It's a biological center where our government tests out biological diseases on animals,
[34:39.000 --> 34:43.000]  which like hoof and mouth and things like that, to prevent it.
[34:43.000 --> 34:47.000]  That's the upfront story about Plum Island.
[34:47.000 --> 34:55.000]  Now, the conspiracy in Plum Island is this, Lyme disease, the first recorded case was found in Lyme, Connecticut,
[34:55.000 --> 34:58.000]  which is right across the water from Plum Island.
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.000]  And then you go into the history of Plum Island and you learn this.
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.000]  The godfather of Plum Island is a Nazi named Eric Traub.
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  And at the end of World War II, he was right underneath Himmler.
[35:11.000 --> 35:17.000]  And his expertise was creating biological warfare using ticks and mosquitoes
[35:17.000 --> 35:23.000]  and inflicting them upon another country with devastation of biological warfare.
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  Well, he probably should have stood trial at Nuremberg,
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  but of course, we all know at the end of World War II,
[35:29.000 --> 35:34.000]  there was a battle between us and the Soviets of how many scientists we could all get.
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  And he's one that made it here.
[35:36.000 --> 35:43.000]  And now that we're good to that, we got Warner Von Braun, who's the godfather of our space program in NASA.
[35:43.000 --> 35:50.000]  But we also got Eric Traub, whose expertise was biological warfare using ticks and mosquitoes.
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.000]  He is the godfather of Plum Island.
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  He is the man that created this place.
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  So, I mean, call me, you know, a paranoid Alex,
[36:00.000 --> 36:08.000]  but anytime I know that a Nazi created something and we're now using it,
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  my suspicion rate goes up.
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.000]  Is that a logical thing to do?
[36:13.000 --> 36:14.000]  Well, absolutely.
[36:14.000 --> 36:20.000]  And as you know, they're now building 36 level four bioweapons labs in the middle of nowhere,
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.000]  but also in major cities like San Antonio, Texas, and in places like that.
[36:25.000 --> 36:29.000]  And there's a lot of evidence that not just Lyme disease came from Plum Island.
[36:29.000 --> 36:37.000]  But also that the West Nile virus and so many other zoological type things,
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  and now we're going to put this on screen.
[36:39.000 --> 36:44.000]  I'm sure it came out a few days ago that not only did they give black men syphilis for 40 plus years
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.000]  and kill them and let them spread it, but now they've apologized for the U.S. government
[36:48.000 --> 36:53.000]  in secret testing, injecting thousands of Guatemalans with syphilis.
[36:53.000 --> 37:00.000]  I mean, Alex, am I missing something or would we classify that terrorism?
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  It is terrorism, yes.
[37:02.000 --> 37:03.000]  Yeah.
[37:03.000 --> 37:08.000]  I mean, how come our country can do things that are terrorist and we're not called?
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  I mean, I got in trouble.
[37:10.000 --> 37:18.000]  You know, Fox TV won't have me on anymore because I made the statement on there when I was on the months ago.
[37:18.000 --> 37:25.000]  I said, why are we so shocked that we would get attacked by terrorists when our country's been practicing terrorism
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  for going on 50 years?
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  We just call it foreign policy.
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.000]  And they got angry and asked me to cite an example of the quick one that came into my head.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  I said, well, what about Cuba?
[37:38.000 --> 37:43.000]  I said, we've attempted to assassinate their leader on multiple occasions.
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  I said, we've tried to destroy their game fields.
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  We've got bomb ships in their harbor.
[37:49.000 --> 37:54.000]  And of course, we all know you and I about the nice guy, Orlando Bosch.
[37:54.000 --> 38:00.000]  He's a guy that blew up a Cuban civilian aircraft with a hundred and some people on board
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  and was pardoned by George Bush Sr. and walking free today.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  The Cuban Olympic team.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  And that's admitted that he was CIA contracted.
[38:08.000 --> 38:09.000]  Yeah.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  No, is that not an act of terrorism?
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  Well, let me bring this up to you then.
[38:13.000 --> 38:16.000]  If that's not, then explain to me the difference.
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  Well, well, there's two issues here.
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  And I want to get back into the government sponsored terror, both the stuff they staged,
[38:21.000 --> 38:27.000]  but the open terror that they call foreign policy, a thousand drones bombing Pakistan.
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.000]  And they admitted they kill one person of interest that may be a terrorist, they claim.
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.000]  It's okay to kill 100 innocent people at a wedding.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  But and I want you to speak to that governor, but separately, you're saying specifically,
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  well, because that's big news.
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  Fox News has told you because it used to be on there all the time as a guest.
[38:46.000 --> 38:53.000]  You're not allowed on now because they don't officially tell me, but they won't book me.
[38:53.000 --> 39:00.000]  The last time I went, you know, it used to be I could at least get on with Hannity.
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  Now I can't even get on with him.
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  Back Hannity or Riley and all of them.
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  See, they're the kind of guys that they thrive upon being able to bully people.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  And the problem is I can't be bullied usually.
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  Well, that's the issue is that Glenn Beck calls you stupid, but I know you well.
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  You're extremely smart, but also street smart.
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  Glenn Beck calls me stupid.
[39:21.000 --> 39:24.000]  Yeah, guys, YouTube Glenn Beck calls Jesse Ventura stupid.
[39:24.000 --> 39:25.000]  He does an imitation of you.
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  He says, yeah, I was in a dressing room with him.
[39:28.000 --> 39:34.000]  This way, Alex, this comes from a guy who's only claimed to fame in his entire life.
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.000]  History is being a top 40 disc jockey.
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  Absolutely.
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.000]  And he calls and he says, I'm stupid, huh?
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  Well, I'm going to try to pull this clip up.
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  No, I don't care.
[39:46.000 --> 39:52.000]  I consider the source, but I mean coming from a guy and nothing against disc jockeys, you know?
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  I have nothing against that profession.
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  It's an honor.
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.000]  But I know you well.
[39:56.000 --> 40:04.000]  But you can't hardly call yourself a foreign policy specialist if your entire background is being a disc jockey.
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  Well, my point is, is that in the tape from his radio show, he claims that you were in a dressing room with him.
[40:08.000 --> 40:12.000]  And quote, tried to intimidate him if memory serves.
[40:12.000 --> 40:13.000]  Oh, that's true.
[40:13.000 --> 40:14.000]  Absolutely.
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  I intimidate all the people at Fox.
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.000]  He joins a good company called O'Reilly, Hannity, and the rest of them.
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  Well, I was going to expand on that.
[40:23.000 --> 40:31.000]  I mean, I've seen you with Hannity where he completely capitulates and they're just unable to dominate you, but you're not bullying them.
[40:31.000 --> 40:34.000]  You're very calm and just lay out the facts.
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  Well, the thing is, you have to remember something, Alex.
[40:38.000 --> 40:47.000]  You have to treat journalists in different ways because each one of them thrives on being successful in a certain manner.
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.000]  And the Fox people thrive on being bullies.
[40:51.000 --> 41:00.000]  So the key to interviewing with them is to show them they can't bully you and that, you know, you in turn bully them.
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.000]  Did you see when John Stuart was on with O'Reilly?
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  I mean, John Stuart destroyed O'Reilly.
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  It's the first time I've seen O'Reilly lose control of his show.
[41:13.000 --> 41:20.000]  John Stuart had full control of O'Reilly's show and O'Reilly was just pumping in little bits and pieces when he could.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  Yes, I have seen that.
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.000]  And if anybody is a bully, it's O'Reilly.
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.000]  He'll cut off people's mics. He'll get in their face and tell them to shut up.
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.000]  They all are. It isn't just him. They're all that way. That's the persona there.
[41:36.000 --> 41:42.000]  People need to understand, Fox News is not Fox News. It's Fox Entertainment.
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  Well, since we raised this, I want you to hear it and be able to comment.
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.000]  Here's Glenn Beck talking about Governor Jesse Ventura. Here it is.
[41:51.000 --> 41:55.000]  I heard Jesse Ventura. What a dope this guy is.
[41:55.000 --> 42:02.000]  I heard Jesse Ventura, who's nothing but a big, fat, dumb bully.
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  And trust me, I know.
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.000]  He tried to intimidate me in the makeup room one day before CNN show.
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.000]  And he's just a bully. He's big, he's dumb, he's slow.
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.000]  He's definitely a big dumb animal. And he is a bully.
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  You know the only offense I take out of that, Alex?
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  What?
[42:26.000 --> 42:32.000]  The only offense I take? How dare Glenn Beck called me fat?
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  How dare him?
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.000]  That fat butterball called me fat?
[42:38.000 --> 42:43.000]  Excuse me, I used to be called Jesse the Body Ventura.
[42:43.000 --> 42:47.000]  Well, I gotta say, granted, I am not in the shape that I was in
[42:47.000 --> 42:52.000]  when I was at the peak of my pro wrestling career at the height of athleticism,
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  but I still am in pretty good shape.
[42:54.000 --> 42:55.000]  Well, let me be clear.
[42:55.000 --> 43:01.000]  The offense I take from that is having Glenn Beck call me fat.
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.000]  When's the last time he looked into a mirror?
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  Well, he certainly is an effeminate twerp.
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.000]  But I mean, to be serious here, I remember right after you had your hip surgery,
[43:11.000 --> 43:15.000]  you came down and visited me in Austin, and that was the biggest you'd ever been.
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.000]  Maybe 10 pounds overweight, but you know, when we were flying around the country,
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  I saw you pull your shirt off a few times.
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  We were changing and stuff, and I mean, for somebody who's 59,
[43:24.000 --> 43:27.000]  I've never seen anybody with ripped muscles like you, Governor.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  Well, I'm not the best-built 59-year-old in the world.
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  I'm not going to claim that, but I train every day.
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  I work out constantly.
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.000]  If you're going to go down an attempt to surf in Mexico,
[43:41.000 --> 43:46.000]  do you think you can do it being big and fat as Glenn Beck would?
[43:46.000 --> 43:47.000]  He called me.
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  I can't believe he could.
[43:49.000 --> 43:54.000]  Him, of all people, could call me fat.
[43:54.000 --> 44:00.000]  That right there should kill Glenn Beck's credibility completely.
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  Well, I didn't mean to get off into him.
[44:02.000 --> 44:03.000]  No, no, no.
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.000]  I'm laughing about it, Alex.
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  It's good humor.
[44:06.000 --> 44:09.000]  I'm not, I rate you're nothing about that.
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  I consider the force.
[44:11.000 --> 44:14.000]  Well, you know, Glenn is covering a lot of world government stuff,
[44:14.000 --> 44:17.000]  but then he blames it on low-level communist professors.
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.000]  Instead of admitting, our Pentagon, I have the Rand Corporation documents,
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.000]  I have the global trends, 2025, the transformed world,
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.000]  the policy of the megabanks that run the military industrial complex
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  that Eisenhower warned us about, is to have corporate welfare
[44:31.000 --> 44:35.000]  and to steal the wealth of the people to make us more easily controlled.
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.000]  And meanwhile, he's claiming some low-level professor,
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  you know, is the top of the pyramid.
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  And I think people are getting wise to him.
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.000]  That's why his ratings are plunging and the New York Times talked to him
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  and he admitted that he's got major friction with Fox
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  and they may throw him under the bus.
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  I mean, you may not see Glenn back in a year.
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  Well, you know what?
[44:54.000 --> 44:55.000]  He won't care.
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  He's made his money.
[44:57.000 --> 45:01.000]  You know, he's become exceptionally wealthy for what he does
[45:01.000 --> 45:05.000]  and let me throw that out to the people of the United States
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.000]  because of the millions of lemmings out there
[45:09.000 --> 45:13.000]  that could take someone like Glenn back and make him a messiah.
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  I mean, what does he care for?
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  Alex, he's made a ton, a ton of money.
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  Well, I think that's the establishment joke.
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.000]  They got an effeminate, and I was reading the New York Times article,
[45:22.000 --> 45:25.000]  they admitted he's effeminate and said that's good
[45:25.000 --> 45:30.000]  and they admitted constantly flip-flops and they said they're proud of that
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  in this New York Times piece.
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.000]  And so the face of the anti-New World Order,
[45:35.000 --> 45:39.000]  unless you talk about Alex Jones, Ron Paul or Jesse Ventura,
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.000]  is Glenn Beck, who just radiates.
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  It's not even fair to women to call him effeminate.
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  It's, well...
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  You know, again, I'm more disappointed in the people of this country
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  than I am him.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  You know, how could they be led by the nose
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  by somebody who's unqualified at anything is him.
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  He's never done anything.
[46:03.000 --> 46:08.000]  He found a niche in the radio world and the TV world
[46:08.000 --> 46:11.000]  and he found a niche of people that he could lead.
[46:11.000 --> 46:15.000]  I mean, remember that people are easily led, you know?
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.000]  Well, he criticizes Obama, which is fair, for reading off a teleprompter,
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  but he admits he uses a teleprompter.
[46:21.000 --> 46:24.000]  Everybody does. The teleprompter's a marvelous thing.
[46:24.000 --> 46:29.000]  I think the only jealousy comes in the fact that George Bush couldn't read one.
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  All right, all right.
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  All the rest of us can.
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  We're running out of time and this interview's really getting powerful here,
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  but I want to get back into the episodes.
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.000]  Let's talk about the water episode, because I was asking here in a break.
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  I said, what do you think's the most scary?
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  And you said water, and I tend to agree with you,
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  because these multinationals, well, I mean, tell folks what you discovered.
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.000]  Well, let me say this. I go out with the Native American chief
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  and we go to Lake Mead.
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.000]  By, by Hoover Dam, you know, the water source from Las Vegas.
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.000]  Let me finish with this. I got news for you people.
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.000]  Within the decade, Las Vegas is going to have no water.
[47:04.000 --> 47:09.000]  Lake Mead is down 125 feet.
[47:09.000 --> 47:14.000]  Let me repeat that. 125 feet down.
[47:14.000 --> 47:18.000]  I stood on a plateau there, 60 feet below the ledge,
[47:18.000 --> 47:24.000]  where docks were still up there where less than a decade ago, kids were fishing off them.
[47:24.000 --> 47:29.000]  The water was now 60 feet below where I was standing at.
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  And the water show that we do.
[47:33.000 --> 47:38.000]  If it does not terrify the people of this country, then nothing will.
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  And of course you interviewed me for that.
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  You came to Austin to investigate it, but, but, but,
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  how much more of the investigation can you talk about?
[47:44.000 --> 47:45.000]  I mean, clearly you show how these...
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.000]  That's enough, Alex, just to say it leads us to the north,
[47:49.000 --> 47:52.000]  the northern peninsula of Michigan and the Great Lakes,
[47:52.000 --> 47:57.000]  which is home to 20% of the world's fresh drinking water.
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  And who gets to have the water?
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  We don't get to have it, but somebody else does.
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  Well, watch the show.
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  That will be very clear on the show.
[48:07.000 --> 48:13.000]  What can you say about the police state camps show?
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.000]  Well, that I will say this, it again reaffirms,
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.000]  you all remember when Michael Moore spoke to Congressman Connears,
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.000]  and he set Michael Moore down and said,
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.000]  let me tell you something, we don't even read the bills we vote on.
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.000]  Yes.
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.000]  You will be reassured of that again.
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  Because I sit down with the congressman who assures me up and down
[48:35.000 --> 48:40.000]  that there are no FEMA internment camps being built in the country.
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  And when we, you should see how funny it is on camera,
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.000]  when we then show him the bill he was co-sponsor of Homeland Security,
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.000]  which states that they would be building no less than six of them.
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  And that's on top of the other camps they've got under some...
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  But he didn't even know it was in the bill.
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  That's the point.
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  These people are not reading what they vote on,
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  they're being told by their political parties how to vote.
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  Let's get into another episode.
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  What can you say about the oil spill?
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  I mean, this is really powerful.
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.000]  Again, the oil spill, we investigate conspiracies,
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  and to be blunt and straightforward, there's a strong suspicion
[49:18.000 --> 49:24.000]  and a lot of circumstantial evidence that that oil spill was done intentionally.
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  And, you know, we talked to some homeless people down there
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  who were actually clean cut, who came down to get jobs,
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  and they said they wouldn't hire us for the cleanup.
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  And you said exactly what I was thinking.
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  You said, hey, buddy, be glad you didn't get that job.
[49:36.000 --> 49:43.000]  Exactly, because, you know, the stuff they're using down there, this dispersant,
[49:43.000 --> 49:49.000]  it has four lethal chemicals in it, including, I think, cadmium and arsenic
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  and two other lovely things.
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  And I'm for the life of me trying to figure out
[49:54.000 --> 50:00.000]  how adding billions of barrels of lethal chemicals
[50:00.000 --> 50:05.000]  to already saturated oil water is a good thing.
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  I can't figure that out now.
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.000]  I am not a scientist, but it doesn't make sense to me
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  that by adding poison to the water,
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.000]  it's going to be beneficial more so than just the oil in the water.
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.000]  Now you've got two of them in there.
[50:23.000 --> 50:28.000]  We're going to come back with our final segment with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  I might twist his arm to do five more minutes in the next hour,
[50:30.000 --> 50:37.000]  but he's probably going to... And we'll get into all this hyping of stage terror.
[50:37.000 --> 50:43.000]  And we'll talk about another 9-11 investigation they're doing with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  Don't forget, folks, his book, American Conspiracies,
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  number four, New York Times bestseller.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  We've got it discounted at infowars.com.

[52:09.000 --> 52:12.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[52:12.000 --> 52:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[52:17.000 --> 52:22.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  now being expanded nationwide.
[52:24.000 --> 52:27.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  has established an old powerful shadow state.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[52:38.000 --> 52:44.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[52:50.000 --> 52:55.000]  It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com

[52:59.000 --> 53:02.000]  You've seen our SinoFresh banner on the GCN website.
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  Are you waiting for a SinoFresh discount?
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  Okay, here it comes.
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.000]  But first, the facts.
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[53:16.000 --> 53:20.000]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.000]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent protected homeopathic nasal product
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.

[53:59.000 --> 54:12.000]  Well, the gov hurt my feelings.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.000]  He usually gives us more than an hour, but he's got a tee time.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  I guess it's almost too cold to keep playing golf.
[54:17.000 --> 54:21.000]  But he did say he'll come back one more time with us before he heads down to Mexico.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  Correct, gov?
[54:22.000 --> 54:23.000]  Absolutely.
[54:23.000 --> 54:26.000]  I got a tee time and they don't hold them for anybody, not even me.
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  How many holes are you going to play?
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  18. That's why I got to be out there.
[54:30.000 --> 54:34.000]  The days are getting shorter. It's getting cold up here in Minnesota.
[54:34.000 --> 54:39.000]  The window of golf is slowly closing and that tells me it's time to start surfing now.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  What are you shooting in golf?
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  Oh, I'm just, you know, if I'm shooting well, I shoot in the 80s.
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  If I'm shooting not so well, I play in the 90s.
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.000]  That's pretty good.
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  You got to get you down here and play our producer, Jaren.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  He's a pretty good guy.
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  Now, we've only got about four minutes left.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  I'm sure you've seen the hype, you know, the terrorists.
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  We have specific targets in Europe in the U.S.
[55:00.000 --> 55:03.000]  Turns out they had drills planned two months ago.
[55:03.000 --> 55:10.000]  It's a global drill and it just so happens it was scheduled for this week.
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.000]  And we have all these White House people, even under Obama saying,
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  we need a terror attack, that's in the Financial Times of London,
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  to make people trust their government again.
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.000]  You know, Governor Ridge admitted they issued fake terror alerts under Bush.
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  Is that not psychological terrorism?
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.000]  Yeah, well, it also, you know, if they're talking like that,
[55:28.000 --> 55:33.000]  then it kind of winds back to 9-11, shouldn't we start questioning it?
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.000]  You know, if it takes a terror attack to bring the country together,
[55:38.000 --> 55:43.000]  then the country is in pretty bad shape, in my opinion.
[55:43.000 --> 55:48.000]  And, you know, the timing of these things, they always do them.
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  Look at the elections where all of a sudden, right before the election,
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.000]  we get an Osama bin Laden tape.
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.000]  I guess the best thing I can say is to the people out there,
[55:58.000 --> 56:03.000]  is wake up and smell the coffee, start paying attention a little bit more,
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.000]  and start looking beyond the soundbite news for your answers.
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.000]  But then again, I'm on the Alex Jones show, so essentially I'm preaching to the choir.
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  Well, we have a lot of new listeners, Governor.
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.000]  Obviously...
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.000]  No, but so many don't listen to you, Alex,
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  and so many don't listen beyond the soundbite news,
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  and it's those people we have to try to reach.
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.000]  Briefly, tell us about the 9-11 episode. It's the Pentagon.
[56:29.000 --> 56:35.000]  Well, the 9-11 episode, the most exciting part of it will be that I speak to a woman
[56:35.000 --> 56:40.000]  who was right in there when the alleged plane hit,
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  and you will hear an eyewitness account from someone who was right in there,
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  and she says some very startling things.
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  Has this verified your suspicions?
[56:49.000 --> 56:53.000]  Oh, yeah, it's reaffirmed my, yes, very much so.
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.000]  It took it that way rather than the other way.
[56:57.000 --> 56:58.000]  Well, I'm...
[56:58.000 --> 57:02.000]  Because whenever you talk 9-11 long enough, Alex,
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  eventually you start doubting yourself.
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  You start questioning yourself.
[57:08.000 --> 57:13.000]  And when I speak to a woman who survived the Pentagon and was right in there,
[57:13.000 --> 57:18.000]  and she reaffirms my suspicions,
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  well, that's good for me too.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  I need that every now and then,
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  because it just seems you're out there fighting the unwinnable war,
[57:25.000 --> 57:28.000]  and occasionally you need an ally.
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.000]  But clearly people are starting to wake up.
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.000]  I mean, not everybody, but I mean, you've been around the country, and...
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  I hope so.
[57:36.000 --> 57:41.000]  But see, wake up doesn't mean that the Tea Party...
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  You know, people need to...
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  You know, that's...
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.000]  I don't know whether wake up is going to take place.
[57:48.000 --> 57:49.000]  I really don't.
[57:49.000 --> 57:54.000]  But hopefully people are starting to question more the things they're told,
[57:54.000 --> 57:59.000]  and not just this self-blinded belief that they...
[57:59.000 --> 58:03.000]  with our egos, that the government can't lie to us,
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  that the government can be bad.
[58:05.000 --> 58:08.000]  They can be, because government is merely people,
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.000]  and we need to lose the ego that to quite possibly evil people
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.000]  can be elected to powerful positions.
[58:15.000 --> 58:20.000]  You need only look at Germany in the 1930s to clearly understand that.
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.000]  Well, the show's premiering at 10 p.m. Eastern, October 15th.
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  That's a Friday, isn't it, Gov?
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.000]  Yeah, Friday night, so there'll be no conflicting baseball games.
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  All right, well, let me say bye to you in the break,
[58:31.000 --> 58:32.000]  and I'll let you get to your tea time.
[58:32.000 --> 58:33.000]  We'll come back next hour.
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.000]  Another big guest joining us on a lot of news.
[58:35.000 --> 58:39.000]  That's Governor Jesse Ventura giving us the exclusive first radio interview.
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  You are listening to GCN.
[58:44.000 --> 59:05.000]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[59:05.000 --> 59:08.000]  How much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.

[59:22.000 --> 59:26.000]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[59:26.000 --> 59:31.000]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me,
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  how's business?
[59:33.000 --> 59:37.000]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[59:37.000 --> 59:46.000]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com
[59:46.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  and find a one to two month soap sampler. Thank you.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  Well, it was great that when I was out in New Orleans and Georgia with Ventura,
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  he said even if he doesn't do radio promotion for the new TV show, which he may do,
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  he's not sure that he would do this show first.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  We appreciate him being on with us and we'll have him again exclusively in the next two weeks joining us again.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  And then as soon as the show starts airing, he can talk more about behind the scenes stuff
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  or things that got cut out because in a 45 minute show, you got 15 minutes of ads,
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  the hours and hours of incredible things that we shoot and see, it can't all end up in the television show.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  And I had a big role in the investigation and consulting and in what three of the episodes last year.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  I think I'm in five or six this year and usually the national television calls me.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  I mean, literally my producers have seen it.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  I refuse to be flown here or there to go on shows because I know it's going to be five minutes
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  and they're going to edit what I say.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  But I do like being part of Governor Jesse Ventura's show and I've really gotten to know him in the last five years
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  and he's just a wonderful person.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  I disagree with some of his political views and ideas, but he's a real person and he really does care.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  He's very interesting.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  Okay, we've got all this amazing news and David Ike is scheduled to join us in about 30 minutes.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  Another big informative guest.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  In fact, Jiren, two weeks ago I had that big folder on the Air Force people saying that aliens were real
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  and on Churchill saying they were real and Eisenhower saying they were real, all that declassified.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  I don't get into aliens in my 15 years on air, but when it's all over mainstream news that aliens are real
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  and they're about to land and the UN is assigned an ambassador for when the aliens land,
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  that's the one area David Ike gets into that I've been lying and not getting into it.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  People criticizing, but now it's just everywhere.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  It's just everywhere and I think it's a government hoax.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  I think they're going to have fake alien landings.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  I don't think I know.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  They have Project Bluebeam and Iron Mountain and others and it's admitted they've thought about fake Second Coming of Christ,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Buddha, Allah, you could pull that stuff up, Time Magazine where they have giant hologram projectors
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  where they can have a 3,000 foot tall Jesus or a goblin or whatever they want it to be,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  a wizard, a pig, a turkey, you know, a jack in the box.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  So they've got all these systems.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  I want to bring that up to Ike as well, but also the economy, the police state,
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  a bunch of other news that we're going to be discussing with him.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  I got some really amazing gold news here.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  Gold powers ahead, a new record high, no signs of market top.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  It went down about $8 yesterday in profit taking to about 1,316.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  It rocketed.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  In fact, guys, get me spot gold right now.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  It rocketed to 1,337.60.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  So what's 16 to 37?
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  I mean, you're talking about a $20 something increase right there.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  I mean, that is just incredible.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  $21 increase right there in one day.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  So I'm going to cover this later in the broadcast.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  Also, I've got other gold news here.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  Where's my economic stack?
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  I had it dealing with a Bloomberg headline that the super rich are moving into gold big time.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  So we're also going to be talking about that.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  Oh, here it is.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  It's Reuters.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  There's also a Bloomberg with a similar headline.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  Oh my gosh, gold's even up more.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  In fact, go over to the right hand side.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  That's where the graph is on that screen.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  And we can go in the actual price, but it looks like it's gone up even more.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  There you go.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  Absolutely.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  And it is up $25.10 today.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  And if you'll minimize that, I can actually give them the situation.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  It is at $1,340.10.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  $1,340.10 up $25.10.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  Thank you guys for that.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  Just print me that page.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  So I'm going to cover more of this briefly when we come back.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  Then I'm going to get into a bunch of other news today ahead of David Ike joining us.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  We'll get into all the terror scares going on.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  Also, Ukrainian people say no to globalist vaccines.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  And they're not the only one.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  And the establishment is upset.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  They're angry.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  They're throwing a pity party for themselves that people are waking up with their eugenics secretizing agenda.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  And again, it's absolutely free.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  There are tons of tools to help you.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  For instance, if you want to remodel your home, go to homegain.com.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  Use their home sale maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  For 10 years, these folks have been helping home sellers and buyers.

[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  Listen up, friends.

[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  You need to get your own supply of high quality, storeable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  They're the best company out there.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  The longest continually operating with a ton of great food to choose from.

[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  Not some old, cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.

[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  With open talk of a strike on Iran the next three months.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  The crisis in the Gulf and possible evacuations.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  The place to go is eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  Again on the web eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  When you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  But if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  We turn jeans inside out diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which by any decent standard they ought not to enjoy.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  Perhaps you would better start from the beginning.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  Perhaps you would better start from the beginning.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  I doubt the government had the right under U.S. law to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  We have to work with dark side or we will spend time in the shadows.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil who will join me and I'm proud to sit here at the right hand to see.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  It's a need for new world order.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  Someday in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  We are back live.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  I want to put a quick plug in for several great radio stations at the big one ksco.com.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  They wrangled me into doing a speaking engagement.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  I'm also out in California doing a secret investigation.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  But I'll be speaking October 24th at one time event starting at 6pm at the coconut grove ballroom and tickets are going fast.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  One place to get them ksco.com.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  Some folks don't have internet though.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  Maybe I should get the ksco number and give that out in the next few days.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  You can also ask any questions or have suggestions at alexalexatksco.com.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  I'll be speaking for two hours and taking a question and answer.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  And I'm tempted to try to get Dr. Stan Montief to come down and give a 30 minute talk as well.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  He lives there and is a great guy and kind of woke up the station owner decades ago back when the station owner was in high school.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  And Dr. Stan Montief came and spoke to his high school about the coming world government.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  But great folks out there, MZ putting it on, ksco.com to get tickets.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  There's links up on the gcnlive.com website or you can just go to ksco.com.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  Huge banner at the top.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  That's October 24th coming up in about 19 days.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  I will be there on that Sunday evening speaking in Santa Cruz, California.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  It's a nice place, the coconut grove ballroom there where I'm going to be speaking ksco.com.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  And I've rarely had events that don't sell out.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  But I've had events with 1,400, 1,200, 1,900, 800, 500, 600 and with almost no promotion.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  And then we're on two stations that MZ owns out there, ksco being the big one.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  Again ksco.com to get tickets or questions.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  Alex at ksco.com Sunday October 24th.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  We also have a Chemtrail film that I've been producing for two years.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  Part of the film, it's a eugenics masterpiece, like the Rosetta Stone of just everything about the elitist.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  Two years, I wasn't going to release it this year, I just can't.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  Because I've just got more interviews, more time, more research, more new information coming out.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  I guess I've got to release it sometime.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  So I was excited when G. Edward Griffin said, hey, I've produced a Chemtrail film.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  And I said, let me see a copy of it.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  I saw it a couple weeks ago and I said, I definitely want to carry this and promote it.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  And, you know, distribute it through info wars.com.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  Because it covers a lot of the same info and research where they admit the Chemtrailing, the weather modification.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  And that's the stuff they've got.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  And the aluminum poisoning the soil in Monsanto with a seeds that can grow in aluminum when nothing else can.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  It's really an important film.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  What in the world are they spraying?
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  And it's going to be shipping out the 22nd of October.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  So I guess now in about 17 days or so or a little bit less.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  So if you want to be the first to get it, order what in the world are they spraying?
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  Infowars.com or call 888-253-3139-888-2533139.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  You can also write to me P.O. Box 19549, P.O. Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  Again, P.O. Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760 or 888-2533139.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  Okay.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  And by the way, for 15 years I had a local outfit, operators that took orders and calls.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  And they're great folks.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  We still transfer the phones over to them at night sometime.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  But they didn't really work here.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  They couldn't answer your questions.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  We got two great ladies up there that do customer service and take your orders now.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  You're calling Infowars.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  That doesn't mean they can come back here and get me on the phone with them.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  Some people berate them and that isn't the ticket.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  I'm working all the time.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  The point is you can actually call our office.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  888-253-3139.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  Oh, they're going to get 10 million phone calls.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  Okay.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  Getting into the news here.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  Gold powers ahead to new record high.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  No signs of market top.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  December Comics Gold Futures on Tuesday had another fresh contract.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  An all-time record of $1,339.50 an ounce as of this writing.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  December Gold traded up $20.80 at $1,337.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  And it's up even more than that.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  It's up at $1,340 and change right now.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  Here is Reuters.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  And again, as soon as the yuppies figure out that the stock market isn't the place to be
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  and that it's a suckers market and that it's basically a casino, a digital casino in the sky,
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  they're going to start moving into gold.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  1% was in gold, now it's 2% individually in gold.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  When we hit the 5% number, it's going to be bananas.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  And yeah, gold will probably start becoming a bubble.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  So, you know, be careful.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  But I personally, not selling gold, I bought at $265 an ounce.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  I'm not selling gold, I bought at $1,100.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  I haven't really bought since it was about $1,200 just as I haven't had the money.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  But my wife's like, get more gold.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  You're really smart to do this 10 years ago.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  Come on, baby.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  But I have bought some silver lately because it's so inexpensive at $10.50 around for the silver half dollars.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  Of course, that's now gone up, but still better than any deal you can find.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  But here it is, super rich investors buying gold by the ton, Reuters.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  And we told you this months ago, but here it is.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  The world's wealthiest people have responded to economic worries by buying gold by the bar.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  And now they're not just doing this in Asia or the Middle East or Europe.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  I heard local Fox News this morning was Kelby J590 reporting that they're putting in gold vending machines all over Texas.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  So, I mean, it's here. It's here.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  The world's wealthiest people have responded to economic worries by buying gold by the bar and sometimes by the ton and by moving assets out of the financial system.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  Bankers catering to the very rich set on Monday.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  Fears of a double-dip downturn that was never an upturn, folks, have boosted the appetite for physical bullying,
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  as well as for mining company shares and exchange-traded funds.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  UBS executive Joseph Stadler told Reuters Global Private Banking Summit.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  We'll cover more of this in a moment, but I wanted to go to Ted Anderson, 30-plus years, 31 years in gold and silver, 15 years with Minus Resources,
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  the owner of the Genesis Network, with gold and silver deals that I have not found, anybody that can match them, these radio specials.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  Ted, I mean, yesterday I talked to you last night, you said, yeah, there was some profit-taking.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  It went down a few dollars, but I think it'll go up tomorrow. You were certainly right, Ted.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  Yeah, you can see it right here. Of course, gold right now at $13.4210 at a high today, currently trading at $13.4120.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  Silver's a big gainer today, too. $22.77 already.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  We've been as high as $22.77 currently at $22.75.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  That round coin that you're talking about, the Walking Liberty Half, currently I have them at $10.83.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  I really held back on those prices. I mean, honestly, Alex, you know, I looked at it, and I just don't want to post them over $11 a piece.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  Actually, on the Internet, they're well over $12 each, and I just, you know, I looked through and I tried to figure out a way to do it.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  Well over $12, I saw them weeks ago at $16. I mean, it was a week and a half ago, gold wasn't even $1,300. Now it's $1,342-plus.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  I know. Everything's going up like crazy. And of course, today, again, another big increase in gold and silver, and so that price at $10.83 is out of this world.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  I just need to say this, Alex. The people that are out there and they're procrastinating thinking that they're going to get to it and they'll buy their gold and silver,
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  you better start thinking about $1,400 gold now.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  His name is Alex Jones. I've been meaning to get gold and silver for months and just got a little bit of silver just because I'm too busy and don't have the capital.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  Well, that's the thing. And time is working against you. It's working against everybody out there. I know. I say it all the time.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  If you have annuities, you're in the stock market. If you have money in the bank, I mean, there's just a whole long line of different types of investments that have everything to do with this fiat money paper and what's going on in the time.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  Well, we knew this years ago and big signals months ago, we said the elites are all grabbing gold up right now. They've decided they can't suppress it.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  Here it is from Reuters, Ted. What does this mean that the rich are just pell-mell grabbing gold?
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  Well, the rich people know what's going on. They know that the United States dollar has been falling. I mean, right now, the yen is falling. The United States dollar is falling against the yen.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  So which one's free falling the fastest? It's reflected in the gold and silver prices. It's not so much that gold and silver has been rising over the last 10 years.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  It's the value of this paper fiat money is going into the toilet. And that's why you see that right now, you're talking about that Reuters article, I have it right here in front of me.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  And they're just saying that the super rich investors are buying gold by the ton. And you know, with the names like George Soros, Warren Buffett, I mean, these people are connected.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  They know what's going on in the marketplace. They're getting in. They're telling you to stay out. I mean, George Soros said that gold is in a bubble back when gold is at about $1180 an ounce.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  No, it doesn't hit bubble until it's $2,500 an ounce. All the big analysts have said because that's 1980 inflation. Now, when it starts going about 2,500, I'll be a little paranoid.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  But I mean, we're a long way to go to 2,500. Now, Ted, I want to come back and read some of this Reuters articles and a few others with you and get your brief take on it.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  But folks, call them for the radio specials on Silver, on Gold, on Franks, on Sovereigns, on Eagles, on the Silver Half Dollars, 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  As I said two months ago, when Bloomberg reported that the majority of the futures contracts in the month of December are $1,500 or gold, I don't know if that's going to happen, but it sure looks like it.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  800-686-2337. I mean, we haven't seen gold really back off. It's just, it's, and we're going into the hottest time every year.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  You know, will it run up to 2,000 by the end of winter? Then go back down to 1,600, and then next year it'll be 3,000 after that. That's the pattern.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:13.000]  We'll be right back with Ted Anderson. Stay with us.

[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  My name is Ban and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont. In the spring of 2003 I started to have problems with my heart. It felt like my heart was pounding. It made me feel breathless. I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself. Nothing did anything.

[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  They are the dark arms. The dark murdering armies of the honor is atrocity.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  We are back with Ted Anderson. David Ike scheduled to come up later in the hour. We'll also have open phones for him once I give the number out.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  But here is the headline. I want to get into some of this. Super rich investors buy gold by ton. Reuters, the world's wealthiest people, are rushing.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  And the wealthiest people have responded to the economic worries by buying gold by the bar and some by the ton and by moving assets out of the financial system.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  Which is a Ponzi scheme with 1.5 quadrillion, that's 1,500 trillion, impossible to pay back. So they created this to buy up the world.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  Now they're plunging the markets to consolidate and bring in their global carbon taxes. Total, financial, military style takeover, financial dictatorship.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  Fears of double dip downturn have boosted the appetite for physical bullion as well as for mining company shares. And it continues and exchange traded funds.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  UBS executive Joseph Stadler said they don't buy only ETFs or futures. They buy physical gold, said Stadler, who runs the Swiss bank services for clients with assets of at least 50 million to invest.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  So he only talks to you if you got 50 million at least. UBS is recommending top tier clients hold 70% of their assets and precious metals like gold, which is on course for its 10th consecutive yearly gain.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  And you can't beat that and traded it around 1,314. That's when this came out. It's above 1,340 plus right now.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  It says we had clear example of a couple buying over a ton of gold and carrying it to another place, Stadler said. And today's prices that shipment would be worth 42 million.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  Julius Baer, Chief Investment Officer of Asia, is recommending that wealthy investors park some of their assets in gold as a defensive stance following a string of lackluster U.S. data and amid concerns about currency weakness.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  I see gold as insurance. Van Anathan Nagaswaran said, I recommend 10% as minimum in portfolios and anything more than that will be used for trading purposes to respond to short term overbought or oversold signals.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  And it goes on to say the ultimate bubble with George Sorrell saying it's a bubble, but it's clear he's in there buying it.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  Ted, what does this mean that they're now admitting that the super rich are grabbing gold right now? Because all the signals are, the globalists can't suppress it anymore.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  Ted, they've had global concerted devaluation of currencies that are only accelerating.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  Yeah, well, all that means is that the people that are in the know are starting to buy gold, which means that tells me that we're not in the bubble yet. It's when you have the little, you know, the postal worker and the McDonald's clerk and everybody that like that is getting into gold.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  Right now, the big people are moving in, they can see the handwriting on the wall. The United States dollar is in very big trouble. We just have gone into way too much bailout, we have way too much debt.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  China is trying to get away from us. I mean, it's just way, the United States afforded its prosperity through the 1980s and through the 1990s by borrowing money from places like China.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  They don't want to lend us their money anymore. We now are looking to the printing press to solve the problems that we've created from the 1980s and previous.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  I mean, the United States dollar, this fiat money system is coming to the end of its life cycle. It started in 1913. We are now sitting in the year 2010.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  And this has happened over and over again. 97 years later, we've seen these cycles. We know where this goes in Germany, in Weimar Republic, in Zimbabwe, in Nigeria, in Argentina. We know how this goes.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  It's all about credibility. The United States is losing its credit rating. We no longer can afford to service the debt that we've accumulated.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  And we knew this was going to happen three months ago when the head of the Chinese central bank signaled the dollar was dead.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  Yep. See, that's what it is. It's all about servicing this humongous debt and they're doing it by printing money. What do you think is going to happen to the currency? These people are not stupid.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  Ted, we've only got a minute left and we're coming back with a guess and a big blitz of news first and then calls. But tell folks about your best coin offers for radio listeners only and give them that number.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  Well, currently right now, the best coin offer is still the Walking Liberty Half. It's at 1083. We have the Frank currently right now at 289. We're offering the full year subscription.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  There's lots of different things we have. The Junk Silver, the Eagles, that kind of thing. Call us at 1-800-686-2237. Ask for the CBO report while you're calling to 1-800-686-2237.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  Alex, there's so many things that are going on. I have so many great deals right now.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  Yeah, 26 bucks for the creature from Jekyll Island and a full Silver Dollar. I mean, you're losing money on that. 800-686-2237. Thank you so much, Ted Anderson. Gold at $1340 plus right now and still surging upward.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000]  Consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:21.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.

[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:19.000]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:34.000]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:41.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:59.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:06.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:20.000]  We're back live and for the balance of this transmission, the next hour and a half, the conspiracy icon as he's known, David Icke, is our guest.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  I agree with about 98% of what David Icke says. He's so articulate, former head of the Green Party in the U.K., the best-selling author many times over, championship goalie.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  Very articulate. He can really put things in easy to understand ways. He can really take complex issues and do that.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  But David gets into basically something we never cover and that's interdimensional or extraterrestrial type entities.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  But once something's out in the open, once I can start proving that at least it's being discussed, we're going to talk later at the start of the next hour about UFOs.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  U.S. Air Force officers testify on UFO sightings at National Press Club. They said they were turning off nukes.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  It continues. Churchill and Eisenhower agreed to cover up RAF planes UFO encountering World War II secret files reveal.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  It just goes on from there and more and more the media is hyping some type of alien landing.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  The UN announced last week they've appointed an ambassador to meet with the aliens. We are on a planet out in the middle of space here orbiting the sun in the Milky Way galaxy in our little solar system here.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  And I want to talk to David about why Larry King Live, all of them are basically saying get ready for aliens to land.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:54.000]  They've got all these TV shows like V and The Incident and I know about Project Bluebeam, a program the government admits to fake UFOs.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000]  So we'll talk about that coming up in the next hour.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  First I want to get into what's happening with the economy, the awakening that's happening. I want to ask David he's been very busy.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  If he's seen this new video put out in England that they pulled by the 1010 project where it shows them murdering the children because they won't cut their carbon footprint and murdering football players and murdering talk show host and murdering people and businesses.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  All these authority figures pushing a red button, the message is we're your God, we control you. All these TV ads showing satellites watching citizens saying we know where you are Tom.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  The system has gone from denying that they have a murderous agenda to coming out and saying we want eco-fascism. It isn't about global warming, it's about reducing population.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  Man is a parasite. Man is the enemy. They're teaching us to hate ourselves. So we'll talk about that with David as well next. But first David, the economy gold at $1342 an ounce.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  The currency is going down. The open world government being announced. Riots all over Europe against austerity. You've been proven right.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  So much of what you talked about 15, 16 years ago were called a loon. It's all coming true. And right on the timeline, you said David.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  Well, I said in September 2008 Alex when this first recent crash became clear that there was a three step game going on here.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  The first step was to crash the economy so that people could see there was a problem. The next stage was to get governments to empty their barrels, if you like, to empty their ability to respond to it financially by hurling enormous fantastic
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  kukuland amounts of money at the banking system, which was designed from the start to disappear, which of course the vast majority of it has. And the third stage, which I'm now waiting for is when they make the judgment that it's its optimum moment,
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  they crash the economy again in a way that governments have no longer any means of responding to it, even in the ludicrous way they did in the last couple of years.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  And then the banking system itself will be stepping forward as the saviour and they'll say the only way of sorting out this global mess is ABCD and it will be a global economic tyranny based on a world central bank
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  in which a few people sitting around one table will dictate finance to every country. This of course is where we've been going all along. You know, if there's a few of you and compared with the 7 billion we're supposed to have on this planet, it is an absolute tiny few
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  that are in full awareness behind this conspiracy. And if they are going to reach their goal of a fully fledged global dictatorship, then they have to incessantly centralize power.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  And the more power they have, the more power they have over more and more people and the more power they have centrally, the more power they have to then centralize even quicker. And this is why the speed of globalization in all areas of our lives has got faster and faster.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  And of course the Rockefeller Rothschild World Trade Organization is there to ensure that countries cannot defend themselves against the merciless world system so that every country is dependent on forces and events that are outside their sphere of influence
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  and outside their sphere of control and response. And this is the whole idea to get everyone dependent on everyone else so that the few people at the center running this system have power over every area of our lives.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  I was talking to a journalist yesterday in England, a mainstream journalist who was like saying, he's seeing it, the centralization of power in the media is now blatant and we're now reaching that point.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  The point I talked about 15 years ago where the agenda that for decade after decade, indeed century after century has operated in the shadows, there comes a point where it has to break the surface when it's getting close to its final goal.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  But close to introducing the new world it wants to, well that new world is eventually going to break the surface where we can actually see it. It has to, otherwise it can't become the new world. And we're now at that point that this is why we have a point here Alex of tremendous challenge but tremendous opportunity
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  because it's becoming so blatant, more and more people are seeing what they couldn't see before. So it's a real fork in the road we're facing here.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  You said that brilliantly and you didn't shoot your horn properly. Yes, two years ago you said we're going to have the banker bailouts. That will exhaust the central governments, the state governments, the regional governments.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  They will then announce a new global currency and that's in Reuters and AP Today, the band core that will be digital that then nations will have to borrow from the banks that's made up out of nothing.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  So if you go back to the trilateral commission, public documents from the 70s, they said we will interconnect the world, we'll get everybody in debt, we will set it up where everybody's dependent on each other.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:40.000]  We'll be outside of that as the global arbiters, then we'll implode the world economy and announce the new one world government. And we have those documents. We have the club of Rome, the UN, the trilateral commission, the CFR.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  And so everything we've talked about has come true because we were reading their playbook and as you said they denied it, denied it, denied it in public, though their white papers were available but not widely distributed.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  Now they're getting ready to have their full takeover so they have to go ahead and admit it's all real but say it's our savior.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  David, how do you see this playing out in year one, year two, year three, year four, year five? You say and I tend to agree with you that the main flash isn't 2012 but projecting the lines forward around 2015, 2016.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  The riots have already begun, the Pentagon admits global meltdown but they say martial law is the answer when they've engineered it.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  The British Ministry of Defense says the same thing, the UN, they are getting ready for this. The rich are moving offshore to private redoubts and islands.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  They're hardening the police departments against the citizens. Google admits their NSA and can quote predict the future and are surveilling everything we're doing.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  They're admitting they're taking our blood secretly at birth. They're admitting the vaccines are killing us but they don't care. I mean it's just all coming out and people are being given a choice.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  Some people are waking up now that all of this is so apparent saying Alex Jones, Ron Paul, David I, so many others were right but others are choosing to then out of fear just accept the evil because it's so overwhelming.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  What's the psychological warfare point here and what do you see happening in these phases?
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  Well I think first of all Alex, as you pointed out, if you prepared to do the research and you prepared to focus your life on this stuff over the years, you don't have to be a prophet because there's stuff written down.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  I mean we knew what was coming because it's there to find if you want to look for it. But we have reached this amazing point where people are finding even those with their head in the sand.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  There's no way, as I say in my new book, to have your head in the sand you have to be on your knees and the two things go together and it's time we got off our knees and to do that first of all we're going to get our heads out of the bloody sand and actually face what we're dealing with here.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  And we're at this amazing point now where they can't hide it anymore and humanity is faced with a choice that will be more and more difficult for it to persuade itself and kid itself that there's not a choice to be made because it's really not happening.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  It's just conspiracy theory. No, no, this is in our face now. So we're entering very fast Alex, a totally new phase in this game, in this unfolding conspiracy to impose a global fascist communist state because they're both masked on the same face anyway.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  And for me, we are going to continue to go down this road for some years yet, where it seems that this control system is going incessantly in the direction it wants to and is unstoppable.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  But I am absolutely convinced that in the years between 2016 to 2020, that period, then there is going to be enough people who have awoken to this and can see this, that there's going to come a tipping point.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  What they've been trying to do all these years, Alex, is to bring in the surveillance, the control, the data surveillance, the surveillance of where you go on the internet, surveillance of every area of your life to bring in the more and more, the militarization of law enforcement, even domestic law enforcement is happening all over the world.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  You see the policemen now, and often you can't tell them from the map.
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  And we see a total continuity of agenda where they do snatch and grabs in front of news cameras at the G-20 in England, at Pittsburgh in the US, in Toronto and Canada. We see the same cameras, the same body scanners. We see global drills set up months ago for the surge on trains and bus stations and airports, and they admit it's a global drill that coincides with the latest scare of terrorist bombers.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  It's the same system, the same nomenclature run by the same corporate Borg.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  Yeah, but this is the point, Alex. While they've of course been using terrorists as the excuse, and terrorism as the excuse, we well know that what it's really been constructed for and constantly added to for is the population, the general population.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  That's what it's for. And it's not even for the population that will stay asleep or go into a freeze mode through fear of what they're seeing. It's for those people who are waking up and it's for those people who are prepared to do something.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  And so it's so important for people to appreciate that this is not laid up by the day or the month or the week or the year or even the decade. This has been long projected forward.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:46:00.000]  And so all the different elements of it, the understanding of what they're going to do in terms of the economic crash, et cetera, et cetera, the way that's going to be received by the public.
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  We're seeing it now, more and more unrest, et cetera. And parallel to that, another wing of this conspiracy has been preparing for this with the excuse of terrorism to bring in all these anti-terrorist laws and all these institutions to fight terrorism or to track terrorism,
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  which have all been designed for the general population all along.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  And they admit that this is so central. And this is what I talk about every day, but you do it so eloquently.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  95% of Homeland Security's for veterans, gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, anti-globalists, anti-war people, anybody that doesn't play along with their controlled paradigm.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  And now we've gotten a secret Department of Justice new document up on infowars.com. DOJ urges citizens to report extremists handing out literature like the Obama Joker poster.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  They are now, it's come out that Israeli companies were hired by Homeland Security in Pennsylvania to spy on mainline Tea Parties and state representatives.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:20.000]  And they said that the state reps may be terrorists. I mean, there is an arch, and now Derspiegel admits the former East German Stasi was hired in the U.S. and in Europe to help set up this grid.
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.000]  I mean, now the Stasi are going to save us.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  Yeah, well, we've reached the point where there's a new stage in the psychological warfare. Up to this point, it's been like, keep it under wraps, keep it secret.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  Dismiss and ridicule so-called conspiracy theorists because it seems that the humans have a genetic inability to say the word conspiracy without following it with theory.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  And just say it's all a nonsense. It's not really happening. And that gives you a cover story and time to build your control system more and more powerfully and in more and more of the fine detail of people's lives.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  But now we've reached another psychological point where they're basically saying, yes, I know a lot more people are going to see it now, but it doesn't matter because we're all powerful and we can do what we like.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  And we're going to show you that we can do what we like because we're going to put this on public display more and more and more.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  Now, what are you going to do? Are you going to take us on because we're all powerful and we can do anything we want?
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  Or are you going to just be like good little sheep and good little slaves and just do what you're told, keep your head down, keep your mouth shut and hope that that will see you okay.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  So they've now gone to the pure intimidation. They've taken the velvet glove off and they go, they go, you bet we did, we gave children syphilis in injections in Guatemala.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  You bet we're poisoning your vaccine. You bet we run death camps. You bet, you know, Halliburton and Dinecore run child kidnapping rings.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  You bet we're evil. And so they're trying to intimidate us. You bet we're watching you if you hand out any literature.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  You don't do that in America or the UK. You bet we're listening to your phone calls. You bet we want to reduce your population.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  Just like all these new TV ads and cartoons and video games where it shows the environmentalists murdering people if they don't accept the carbon tax dictatorship.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  Have you seen that new video?
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  I've not, but it makes absolute sense to this whole thing that we're talking about here because we have reached the point now where, you know, we've got to decide are we going to be people who are going to stand up or are we going to be mice
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  and just scuttle away and try to hide in the corner in the skirting board somewhere because this is what they're saying to us now.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  Okay, come on, you can see it, what you're going to do about it. And we need to have the courage and the backbone to say, yeah, we're not having it.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  We're not having it because this is the truth. There's a fraction, a fraction of the number of people in this world who are being manipulated, who are being intimidated, who are having their lives controlled, who have been turned into a slave race.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  A fraction of those that people on earth are actually doing it and the vast, vast, vast, vast majority are having it done to them.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  I think I see a way out of this. And, you know, if we realize that the number and the number advantage the manipulated, abused and suppressed have over those who are in full awareness doing it, the game is over.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  Absolutely, amen to that. The enemy is now out in the open and is unclogged itself. Are you going to stand up against this? Because submitting to it means death.

[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  We are back live. David Ike with us throughout the full next hour. A host of key topics and issues.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  We're going to break down here, but we're going to continue along the line of humanity get off your knees.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  This is bonafide, high tech, brazen, out of control evil, trillions missing at the Pentagon, trillions stolen by the banks,
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  open world government, open biometrics going in at shopping malls, public schools, face scanners on the street.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  I mean, it's all here. Everything we warned you about. I want to read from Alexander Schultz and Eatson's Gulag Akrappelago,
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  who of course he was taken to the camps, and how we burned in the camps later burning inside,
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  thinking what would things have been like if every security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest,
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family instead of their families being drug away and killed.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  Or if during periods of mass arrest, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city,
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  people had not simply sat there in their layers, palling and pailing with terror at every bang on the downstairs door,
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  at every step on the staircase, but it understood that they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, and whatever else was in hand.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  The organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers in transport and notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst for blood.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  The cursed machine would have ground to a halt if, if we didn't love freedom enough.
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  And even more, we had no awareness of the real situation.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  We're purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward, Alexander I. Schultz and Niedsen.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  David Ike, we are in not just a physical dictatorship, it's a psychological, pharmacological.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  They're poisoning our food, our water, everything. They are assaulting us now.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  We have to get angry and get in their face and be bold about this.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  Well, it has to be a psychological control system because of the very thing I talked about before the break, Alex, numbers.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  They cannot control the human population through physical means.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  They can control that way in small areas in certain situations, but en masse they can't do it.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  They haven't got the numbers. They haven't got a fraction of the numbers.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  And so it has to be psychological because, of course, through the mind we decide our behavior and perceptions and therefore we decide our actions.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  And so it's a mind game. I've said this all along. It has to be because of the numbers involved here.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  And we knew this eight years ago, but they now admit the airports, the body scanners, the searches, the questions.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  That's now on the streets of the U.K. and the U.S. and Europe.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  And they're literally training us to line up and answer questions everywhere.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  But the schools are being turned into prisons. We're being inducted into slavery.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  Yeah, I mean, I've used this analogy many times over the years because I think it's so appropriate to what we're looking at.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  And that is the laboratory rat who's put in the maze of channels.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  And some of these channels have electric shock equipment in them.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  And when the rat goes down those channels, it gets an electric shock.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  It might go down that channel another time, maybe another couple of times if it's stupid and it will get an electric shock.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  After that, you can take the electric shock equipment away.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  That rat will never go down that channel again because its behavior has been modified.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  It's been reprogrammed. And that's what all this is about, you see.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  When you look at this explosion, this staggering explosion of legislation that is dictating to the fine detail of our lives,
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  you can do this, you can't do this, you can't say that, you can't even think that.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  We're moving into those kind of realms now.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  And what it is, it's like a fly stuck in a spider's web and more and more the fly is wrapping the spider rod,
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  is wrapping the fly up in the web so it cannot move.
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:30.000]  More and more and more legislation equals less margin for maneuver, for perception, for uniqueness, for view, for expressing what you really want.
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  For underground economy, they're just shutting everything down, farms, ranches.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:50.000]  Back in 70 Seconds with David Ike, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating with a ton of great food to choose from.
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.000]  It's all fresh and made on a monthly basis, not some old credit food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two week supply of delicious, easy to fix food.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it with open talk of a strike on Iran the next three months.
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.000]  The crisis in the Gulf and possible evacuations, get yourself and your family ready today.
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  Each to go is eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:59:43.000 --> 02:00:05.000]  Again on the web, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:13.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  Okay, I briefly wanted to get back into the subject of climate-gay, the global carbon taxes on carbon dioxide that we exhale.
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  But meanwhile, the FDA is approving GMO salmon with insect and eel genes in it that gives rise on record to the extinction of regular salmon.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  That's major university studies. Mutated viruses and bacteria. And this will open the door to thousands of these being approved.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.000]  And you're not even allowed to know in the labeling if it's a chimera cross species clone.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  And meanwhile, the environmentalists aren't worried about that. It's all a population reduction cult.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:06.000]  They're now out in the open, Paul Watson's article, climate film depicts children assassinated for not reducing carbon footprint.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  And I wanted to play a short clip. It starts with a teacher in a British school with what looks like about sixth graders.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:19.000]  And they say, what are you going to do for 1010 to cut your carbon? And some kids say, I'll do this, I'll do that.
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  Three or four say, I'm not going to do anything. She goes, fine, hits a button and murders them.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  They explode. Then it cuts to a business where they're murdering their employees, then murdering other people.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  And this is everywhere. They're coming out saying eco fascism is good.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  We're going to play that clip while David talks to show people the video.
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:42.000]  Go ahead and play the clip now so David can comment on it. Here's a quick clip of their heads being blown off.
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  And there's not.
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  Philip and Tracy. That's fine. That's absolutely fine. Your own choice. Okay class, thank you so much for today and I will see you all tomorrow.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  Oh, just before you go, I just need to press this little button here.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  Now, everybody, please remember, blood and guts splatters over the other children in their little white pressed uniforms. And so the message here is the authority figure, the teacher that kids believe.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  And this is shown in movie theaters to children. You're going to be killed. I mean, David, this is amazing.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  Yes. But there's one side to it. Also, Alex, that it does also smack of desperation because they are becoming more and more extreme for another reason is that they do have a timescale.
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  You know, there is a human awakening going on. You know, I've been to 51 countries in the last 20 years talking about this and researching it.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  And there is a global awakening going on. I mean, I went to speak in the Czech Republic about two weeks ago. I'd never been in the country before.
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  I didn't arrive till about three days before. There was no mainstream media coverage as there never is because, of course, they want to keep that quiet.
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  And because of the way the venue was set up, I actually didn't see the audience or out front, as they say, until I walked through the door onto the stage.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  And I stopped in mid-stride. I was shocked at how many people had come, not only for someone who was in the country for the first time after three days,
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  but the fact that it was actually a simultaneously translated talk if you wanted earphones on so they could understand what I was saying.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  So this is happening and it is gathering pace very, very quickly. And so they are pushing this on also with these more and more extreme, extraordinary things like you just described.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  Because they are trying to push this forward as fast as they can because they do have a time scale. And that time scale is the more it's delayed.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  We've had these conversations before, Alex, over the years. The more we can delay this and slow it down, the less, less chance it's got of prevailing because of the awakening that's going on.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  I agree with you. Long segment coming up. This was a short break, but there's so many videos, so many cartoons now where they show humans as bad.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  I mean, scores of video games where it shows, you know, you're a robotic mega worm that kills women and children and it's a good thing.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  They're also trying to breed a group of psychopathic children that think of killing fellow humans as a attribute.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  Yeah, and the thing is, how are you ever going to express the full magnitude of who we are if you think you're a useless piece of dirt, that you're just the equivalent of a virus?
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:54.000]  I mean, how are we going to do that? It's attempting to give us a self-hatred perception of self, which would, of course, be desperate for who we really are.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  Okay, there, let's finish up with that central point straight ahead.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:10.000]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:25.000]  And it states it's now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:31.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:45.000]  The police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:06:00.000]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at prismplanet.tv.

[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:47.000]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business? I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self produced colloidal silver solutions.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:16.000]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:21.000]  My name is Mario Sofaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator.
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:34.000]  Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:42.000]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:52.000]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung system works.
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:08:13.000]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  We're live ladies and gentlemen. 8 minutes into hour number 3. It is Tuesday the 5th day of October 2010.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:38.000]  The iconic David Ike is our guest. We're going to talk about a host of other key issues here just a moment, but finishing up if you just joined us.
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  David was getting into the fact that and if you go back to Edward Bernays 80 years ago who advised the Department of War and the Department of Defense and he's the reason you eat bacon with eggs.
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  He's the reason there's a music room. You've got to have that piano in the house to be classy.
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:09:02.000]  They wrote up the feminist movement to break up the family to get women working so they could double tax and break up families even if women wanted to stay home and raise the children.
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  They brag about this and they said the number one goal is to make you feel inadequate, to make you feel worthless so they can then sell you on their quote new ideas.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  And what David was saying is mirrored by the article at prismplanet.com, climate cult indoctrinating our kids with depraved death wish.
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:40.000]  And it, the second article Watson wrote over the weekend on this, climate cult indoctrinating our kids with depraved death wish and it deals with their teaching them you're worthless, you're bad, humans are evil so that we're already desensitized with violence and death on television and simulated murders.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:48.000]  So when we see the real thing, a lot of people don't care, watch some old lady hit by a car, bleed to death for two hours on the street or a cop hit by a car.
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:56.000]  You see these reports all the time, people not rendering aid, not just disliking themselves but hating everyone else.
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  They're destroying our connectivity to each other and it's so wicked they don't want us to know how special we are, the mind that gave you Shakespeare and Beethoven and Socrates and Mathematics and Max Planck 110 years ago.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  Now, literally envisioning in his mind the atomic theory and atomic weapons and atomic energy, a species that's brought us space travel. We're supposed to love the dolphins, love the elephants, but then we're trash, we're scum, we're worthless, we don't have a right to have children.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  And this is so central. David, please continue.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  Well, you know, Alex, I've been writing my books for years that this is no new phenomenon. The process we're now experiencing, if you want to use the version of time that we perceive as time, then you're talking thousands, probably tens of thousands, maybe more years, that this has been slowly but surely unfolding.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  And the same techniques have been used all along. There'll be people listening to this program won't like this, but what we're talking about here is the same principle as telling people that by the very fact that they were born, the very process of birth, they are a sinner.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  And if you go back to ancient Sumer and you read in what we now call Iraq, thousands of years BC, and you read their perception of themselves as a general population, and it was that the gods were up there and they were down here.
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  They were just slaves. They had the same kind of perception of self that we're talking about here.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  All along, the same techniques have been used that manifested in different ways in different epochs, different eras, different stages of history in different areas of the world, but they're the same basic blueprint.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  And fundamental to that is to make people feel small, insignificant, they have no power, because people who believe they have no power do not express the power they have, because we are constantly expressing our self-perception, our self-identity.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  So if you can get people to feel that they are useless, they're worthless, they're just as Prince Philip once alluded to the humanity, just a virus, and basically just you should have contempt for yourself and everything that you stand for and the human race collection be the same,
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:38.000]  then you are going to perceive yourself in that way. You're going to manifest your life in that way. You're not going to see the true magnitude of who you are, consciousness capable of all and much greater feats of awareness and creation than even the one you've just listed, Alex.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  This is who we really are. Now, you imagine billions of people on this planet who are in awareness of the full magnitude, scale, potential, infinite possibility of who we are. A few people controlling them from a central point, forget it, no chance.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  So fundamental to this is to disconnect us from a true awareness of who we are and to put us both in a box of self-perception of being worthless, but also in a box of little me, I have no power, because people who think they have no power, they look up or look out to people who have the power.
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  And it's funny enough, it is the perception that these few have power over us that leads to them having power over us. All you can't, they're all too powerful, there's nothing you can do about it. Watch me.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:53.000]  You know, the numbers alone say that the game of your 70s... Well, what's happening is they impose a predetermination that we're going to fail, a predetermination that we have no power so that people just think it's absolutely lost.
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:14:04.000]  You've just got to go along with everything that's happening. You have to submit to the evil and they are just pushing this like never before. Now, David's shifting gears because...
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  Can I just say one thing, Alex, quickly? You know, what we're talking about here is connected to something that I've been writing about for some time. I know I go into deep into stuff sometimes that people go, you know, that's too far out from me, but what the human body is, is a receiver-transmitter of information.
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  It's like a computer. Now, if you program a computer like on a desktop, you program that to only read information within certain firewalls, then that will be the computer's reality. That is what you're going to get on the screen in terms of the computer manifesting its reality.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:55.000]  Well, that's what the term conspiracy theory is. They throw it out there as a computer command. Do not read this information. Do not see it. Disregard it.
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  So what they're doing is systematically programming humanity, programming the body computer, which is the vehicle, not the realized, we are consciousness, infinite awareness, but it's the vehicle we use to experience this reality we call the world. And it's systematically programming that computer through various means,
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  through education, through media, through all these things, to only perceive a certain reality. And in doing so, what happens, the computer only reads that reality. And you do not then have the perception of the true magnitude of who we are.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  Now, everything connects to everything else. They are bombarding us with electrochemical poisons and pollutions in food and drink and genetically modified food, which is designed to genetically modify us, genetically modify what?
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  Genetically modify, i.e. change the way that the body computer receives and transmits information. That's what they're doing. And in all these ways, they are destabilizing and limiting and distorting how we read reality.
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:31.000]  Because on one level, the body is clearly an electrochemical organism, and it has a particular electrochemical balance. It has a genetic balance. It has a DNA balance. And once you start distorting that, it no longer reads reality to the potential that it had before.
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:53.000]  It's like having a virus in your desktop computer. It doesn't work the same. And this is what is happening. It's a systematic distortion of the way we read reality by distorting the body chemically, electromagnetically, and also in the way that we perceive by the manipulation of the information we receive.
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  The information that we're receiving, Alex, from the media, and what bravely calls itself education, and all these sources, is no different in its basic theme than actually programming a computer, so it reads reality in a certain way. That's what they're doing.
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:27.000]  And I see an ace in the hole for the globalist, because they admit with Project Bluebeam and other reports that have impartially declassified that for 50 years, the British government, the Pentagon, and others have actually hyped UFO stories as a cover for some of their secret technology,
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  but also at a key point to unify the planet, as Kissinger talked about, and Ronald Reagan and many others, that what have aliens invaded? We would then unify. And the government admits they've got secret programs with huge hologram projectors, you name it, to have Christ's Return,
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  Aliens Land, Buddha, Muhammad, they admit this, and suddenly you have all these mainstream media reports we're going to go over after the break where they're saying, oh, it looks like aliens might be real. Eisenhower and Churchill knew.
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:10.000]  And now the UN announces we've appointed an ambassador for when the aliens arrive. And we've got top physicists coming out and saying the aliens are going to be mean when they come.
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:17.000]  This is a very, very important area, Alex, absolutely. We've got time to talk about it now or we wait for a break.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:20.000]  Well, I mean, we've got about a minute and a half, but go ahead and start and we'll come back with it.
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  Well, you know, this is a complex subject, well, slightly complex, in that there's two angles to it. First of all, the idea that humans are the only species of like in this universe is utterly, utterly ludicrous, insane and beyond belief.
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:58.000]  One day, when we wake up a bit more, people are going to say, how could we ever believe it in the same way as how could we ever believe the earth was flat? However, that having said that, and I can talk more about that after the break, there is also, on the other hand, exactly as you're talking about.
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:13.000]  In fact, in my latest book, Humor is Good, Off You Knees, I actually talk about this, that there has been a demonstrable seed change in the way governments and authorities are looking at and responding to information of this kind.
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  There has been a blatant decision that there is going to be a total change, more and more stuff out there. It's not going to be laughter anymore and denied in the way it was before, because they are building up to something here, which will be a disclosure that will be a fake disclosure,
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  a disclosure that leads to the reaction they want in the way you talk about.
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:51.000]  David, let's come back in the next segment and you'll have the floor walk through the pre-programming for the disclosure, just like it was pre-programming before the last 9-11 attack, to tell you who the boogeyman was.
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:20:01.000]  They're clearly doing the pre-programming that the aliens are coming, and all the movies and TV and governments, fiction, non-fiction, they're getting us ready for something. What's the reaction?
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:15.000]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:08.000]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors. Are we going to see economic growth? Slide into a recession or at worst depression.
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:19.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources. We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent. When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:29.000]  But what do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means? Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:38.000]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:33.000]  Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:39.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:42.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:48.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:14.000]  Okay, here's the headlines. UFOs, U.S. Air Force officers testify on UFO sightings at National Press Clubs so they flew over bases and turned nukes off.
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:21.000]  That was all over mainstream news. Here's the mail. Churchill and Eisenhower agreed to cover up UFOs.
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:27.000]  Here's another report. UFO files. Winston Churchill feared panic over Second World War RAF incidents.
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:40.000]  And it's just everywhere now. And even when it's clearly not something extraterrestrial, ABC News will point cameras at a homeland security blimp at 100,000 feet even with propellers and say it's aliens.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  So they've got all these TV shows, the incident, the V, they've got all these groups saying a disclosure is coming.
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  As I said, the UN last week appointing an ambassador for when the aliens land. David Ike, what's going on here?
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  Well, it's a strange situation in that on one hand there are non-human species that are visiting this planet and interacting with it behind the scenes.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:18.000]  And this has been going on for a very, very long time. I mean, I've spent 20 years researching this. Other people have too.
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:32.000]  I have come across ancient accounts all over the world in almost any ancient culture that you want to talk about, whether it's Africa, South America, whether it's Asia, wherever.
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  And you find these descriptions of non-human entities that were clearly vastly, shall we say, ahead of the humans at that time in terms of technology. I mean, light years ahead, probably literally.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  And I have spoken to enough people all over the world from every walk of life you can think of, from people in the Swiss banking industry, people in America, people in Australia, people in the bush of Africa.
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:22.000]  And they have told me compellingly consistent descriptions of their experiences of these different entities. And indeed the descriptions of them, because there are a lot more than one species, the descriptions of them are incredibly consistent.
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  And I have to much ridicule, not quite so much as before now, but with much ridicule over the years, as you know, Alex, I've talked about the fact that ultimately behind this human control system, this human bloodline network we call the Illuminati,
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:53.000]  are a, or maybe more than one, but certainly one, non-human race that seems to take a reptilian form. And you know, I say this to people before we get on to actually what's going on now.
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  You know, when earlier in this program, Alex, you reeled off element after element after element of this control system and how it's coming in now.
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  I ask people, look at the great spectrum of things that are coming in, the fine detail of it, the way it all interconnects with different elements of itself, the attack on the human body, the banking, the pharmaceutical, the oil, the environmental, and so on and so forth,
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:36.000]  an infinitum. Are we really saying that all this is being orchestrated by men in dark suits sitting round the table discussing their next move?
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:56.000]  There is a reason that people like Aldous Huxley and George Orwell, real name Eric Blair, could have access to the projected agenda for this planet decades and decades and decades ago through accessing through the Fabian Society,
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  through these different elements of the secret society network, particularly the really exclusive ones, you can get access to the projected agenda.
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:15.000]  How can these people talk about drugs that didn't exist? How could they talk about technology that didn't exist, some of which was never even thought of?
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  And yet now we look back at what they wrote in, quote, prophetic novels and we say, Mike, how did they know? Because, Alex, there is a common theme through these thousands of years.
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  People have said to me, it's a very good question over the years. Why would these families dedicate their lives over century after century after century to push this agenda on,
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  to more and more centralization from the tribal situation, bring the tribes together under nations, now bring the nations together under unions, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:56.000]  And this centralization that's gone on not just recently, it's become more obvious recently because it's got quicker, but it's been going on for a long time.
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  How could these people be born, grow up in these families in the 1600s and 1700s, and give themselves to advancing an agenda which they knew they were not going to see unfold in their lifetime?
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:20.000]  Because there is another force that is the cement, that is the common theme through this period, and I would suggest you it's a non-human force.
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:29.000]  This is the cement, this is the common theme that holds it all together because the human families we call the Illuminati are middle men and women.
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  They are conduits to play out the agenda of a non-human race.
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:40.000]  Well, Christians would say they're basically possessed, demon-possessed, and you'd say, well, that's an interdimensional.
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000]  Yeah, basically the same thing.
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:51.000]  Stay there, David and I, we'll continue with why they want to have a fake alien landing, why they're gearing up for that. We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:30:00.000]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:05.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:15.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:29.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:52.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:07.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:12.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.

[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:24.000]  DavidIke.com's website, our websites are infowars.com and prisonplina.com.
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:30.000]  You can't have the Pentagon and the UN saying aliens may be real and may land soon.
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:36.000]  And then get mad at DavidIke for looking at human history and all the different, you know, reports of this.
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:42.000]  But we're certainly looking at the fact that the government has admitted that they've had plans to stage landings.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:48.000]  And I have no doubt they're gearing up for something, so we'll talk to him in a moment about the problem reaction solution.
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:54.000]  What are they planning to get out of that? Obviously a unification of the planet under the one-rule government to the outside threat.
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:58.000]  But we're going to be discussing that with David here in just a moment.
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:02.000]  First, I'm going to tell you about a few sponsors like MySolarBackup.com.
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.000]  That's one word. MySolarBackup.com. Super high quality.
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000]  We've been promoting these for over three years. Listeners love them.
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:14.000]  Solar Backup system. It's a nice solar panel hooked into the battery system and little control unit, no fumes.
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:21.000]  None of that stuff that you get from a gas power generator can run your work shed or your campsite or some of the appliances in your house
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:27.000]  or get a bunch of them and run your whole house. It's MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:36.000]  877-327-0365. The government doesn't own the sun, ladies and gentlemen, and it's good to be somewhat self-sufficient.
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:42.000]  MySolarBackup.com. We're going to free information pack 877-327-0365.
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:46.000]  Then, of course, there's purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.000]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:55.000]  One word. They have a full line of household filters to remove fluoride and everything else.
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:01.000]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole house water fluoride system.
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:06.000]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from your water, including shower and bath filters.
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  All other filters are made in the USA. Check out their banners on PrisonPlanetandInfoWars.com
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:17.000]  or go to purewaterfreedom.com to take control of your water supply today.
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:24.000]  I will take four or five phone calls for David Ike in the 25 minutes we've got left after he finishes this issue we were discussing.
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:28.000]  Anything else he thinks is important to talk about?
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:37.000]  We have different questions for David Ike on the economy, on the brainwashing, on the off-world influences that the government is giving more and more credence to.
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  I mean, I only cover what I can prove, but the media is certainly hyping all this.
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:44.000]  And the globalists certainly think they're God and act like they are.
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:49.000]  And there is some type of evil intelligence running this. As a Christian, you'd call it the devil, the old serpent.
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:54.000]  But we're having a wider discussion about that.
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  I'm going to call Free Number to join us. 1-800-259-9231-8259-9231.
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:09.000]  David, we've talked about your view on part of this agenda being real, the other agenda being fake.
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:17.000]  They admit that for a staged, some type of event that they're hyping at crescendo levels.
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  When do you see them building towards some type of staged event? And why would they do that?
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:31.000]  That is the big but at the end of what I said before the break, where I talked about the reality of non-human life.
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:36.000]  In my lady's book, I say this at one point, where I'm talking about this very subject.
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:44.000]  Over the 20 years that I've been on my journey of research all over the world, I've experienced a very different before and after period in the extraterrestrial field.
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:52.000]  I mean, the before and after decision was demonstrably made to allow more information about non-human activity, but released by bit to the public.
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:37:02.000]  And since, of course, the book came out about three months ago, as we've been discussing, more and more stories are being put in the media
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  and being given credence and being given official connections to pursue this very situation.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:19.000]  But what I also go on to say in the book is that whatever this official disclosure that they're almost certainly leading to, or whatever they say,
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:28.000]  it's not going to be the truth about what's going on. It's going to be a cover story to get a reaction to advance the agenda we're talking about.
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:41.000]  You know, it's a simple thing. If you want a centralized global dictatorship, and you use as they do, of course, the technique of what I call problem reaction solution,
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:52.000]  create the problem, get the reaction, do something, and then offer the solution, then if you have a global agenda for global control, then what you need to, in the end,
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  Is Osama bin Laden with green skin?
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:05.000]  You need a global problem through which you can offer a global solution. That's what you want, global problems.
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:13.000]  You don't want just a problem in Utah or something, which someone in Utah can sort out. You can manipulate Utah.
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  Hence global warming or terrorism.
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:27.000]  I mean, this is what I'm going on to say. You're looking at a global war on terror. You are looking at a problem of a global warming, of a global climate change.
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:28.000]  Of course, all made up.
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000]  Global poverty.
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  What else are we looking at? A global economic crisis. All these problems, Alex, have global in front of them because a global problem requires, in the way they're selling it to us, a global solution.
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:50.000]  Now, what greater global problem can you have?
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:39:00.000]  Indeed, as you say, Reagan alluded to it, and others have too. Then a global threat to the earth from a non-human race.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  We have the kind of research already in places you talked about with Project Bluebeam, which actually talks about using things like a fake alien attack to centralize power.
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  Because what would you do in that situation? What do they do in places like Britain when they go to war?
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  They have a war cabinet. They have a few people, not the whole government anymore, a few people around the little table who are making all the decisions.
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  What they would suggest if they could sell this alien threat to the people is they'd want a global equivalent of a war cabinet controlling all the armed forces to meet the threat. They would take a gigantic leap to exactly what they want.
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  This is almost certainly what we're looking at here.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:40:10.000]  I've been tracking this for a while now, a few years, but the speed with which they're now introducing alien threat or UFOs are real stories into the media suggests that we're not a million miles away from some kind of fake disclosure.
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:28.000]  And one thing that we should also remember, Alex, this is another thing that I've come across many, many times over the years, is just because we see a craft that looks like what people call a flying saucer or whatever, doesn't mean it's flown by non-human entities.
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:46.000]  You know, it's anti-gravity technology. And of course, as we well know, the technology in a great spectrum of possibility that they have in the underground bases and the secret projects is right here again ahead of what we see in the public arena.
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:57.000]  And therefore, when we see this technology, people see this technology flying around, because it is so apparently in advance of what we see, we think it must be aliens.
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  Let me stop you. Let me stop you.
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:06.000]  They have this technology, and humans can fly this stuff, and it's not always non-humans that people are seeing, to say the least.
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  Well, let me throw this out at you, and then we'll let you finish and take calls, David.
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  Ten years ago, or I guess in 99, 11 years ago, I saw headlines in the BBC about Hong Kong markets where you could buy a part Reese's Monkey part jellyfish that glowed in the dark.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:34.000]  And I saw reports, you know, 10, 11 years ago, and he actually 12 years ago had the CEO on upstate New York of part spider goats that produced body armor in their milk.
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:50.000]  So it's not a stretch that they could take, you know, humans, and they, you know, have human cloning, and basically breed a glow in the dark human that looks like a space alien, train them up to be a pilot, brainwash them that they are an alien,
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  land on the White House lawn, and be the ambassador from Jubil Snopple, you know, or from Planet Pop-Tart.
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  I mean, the sky's the limit. Look at the technology they admit they have, and then remember that the B-2 bomber was around for 20 years before they admitted it was, you know, in action.
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  They still say the SR-71 Blackbird, in service in the mid-50s, is the fastest plane we've got.
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:18.000]  I mean, there's no doubt that the, and then they admit they have giant hologram projectors, and clearly they're really hyping.
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:25.000]  I mean, if you had to dead reckon when they're going to do this fake alien stuff, I mean, it could be this year, next year, it could be any time.
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:34.000]  It could be any time. And, you know, the thing is that another aspect of this is that this very reality, what we call the physical world, is actually holographic.
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  Of course, in the way that it manifests itself, it's far more sophisticated than reality in itself than technology can do.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:50.000]  But we're still experiencing a holographic reality of what we call the physical world.
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  This is provable stuff if people would only look at it.
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:43:04.000]  And so projecting holographic images within a holographic environment already, we could sort of decode it that, if you like,
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:14.000]  and it would look to every bit as much, probably, as real as the reality looks that we're experiencing.
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  Because, you know, it's like being projected within a more advanced version of like.
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:29.000]  This holographic stuff is very, very important because it has incredible manipulative potential.
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:39.000]  Well, it certainly does, and they have patents from the 50s of sound they can project into your middle ear without being able to audibly hear it with regular sound.
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:44.000]  They admit they have electromagnetic systems that can make you have hallucinations.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:48.000]  We know they've used PCP and LSD sprayed on people.
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000]  You know, during the Six-Day War, they did that.
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:53.000]  And that's all 30, 40, 50, 60 years old.
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:59.000]  And so all of this is open to discussion because we know the establishment is looking at it and studying it,
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:03.000]  and everything they put on mainstream TV has some type of agenda.
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:06.000]  And so it's just in our face.
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  The point, Alex, you know, they know, the inner core know that the human body is a biological computer system, which we use to experience this reality, much like a space suit on the moon or whatever,
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:27.000]  but obviously much more sophisticated expression of that theme.
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:35.000]  And so they are manipulating us in the knowledge that it's a computer system.
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  And these things you're talking about now projecting sound on a certain frequency that we've not audible to the conscious mind,
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:50.000]  projecting that information into the mind, projecting instructions into the mind, perceptions into the mind.
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000]  They know what they're doing.
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:53.000]  No, no, DARPA admits.
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:57.000]  No, it's a computer, and they know how to manipulate it. We need to understand that.
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:13.000]  And this is the other point, is that one of the most foundation ways that you manipulate a population is to suppress the information about what is actually possible.
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:30.000]  Because if you can suppress people's perception of what is possible, then when you use technology and techniques that are much beyond what you have programmed the population to believe is possible,
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:44.000]  they will immediately think, if I believe it, it's non-human, or I'm not going to believe that they're using this technology when people like you and me say it, because it's impossible.
[02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000]  They limit people's horizon.
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:51.000]  We're almost out of time, David. This has been an amazing interview. We appreciate you joining us.
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  I want to get to some phone calls.
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:57.000]  Martina in Iowa, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:58.000]  Yes.
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:45:59.000]  Go ahead.
[02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:08.000]  Yes, I just had a quick point. My son is in the Army Reserve, which worries me.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:19.000]  But I heard about this colonel who had written a book about his experience over in Afghanistan or Iraq, whatever.
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:26.000]  And then the higher-ups, whoever they are, burnt a thousand of those.
[02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:30.000]  You're talking about Anthony Schaefer. We're going to get him back on the show. He's been there.
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:36.000]  And that just shows more suppression of information. But you obviously don't have a question for David Eich.
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:46.000]  No, I do. I wanted to know if this is something that is going to, you know, where are they going to burn next? I mean...
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:54.000]  Well, ma'am, it's insane to join the military because they shoot them up with a bunch of experimental vaccines that have been caught killing the troops in secret testing.
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:47:01.000]  Not just killing Guatemalans. And so you have to understand that it's a culture of death and just get your son out as soon as you can.
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  People are like, well, you better support the military. It's not our government. It's not our military.
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:11.000]  They use the troops like guinea pigs. Supporting the troops means, you know, mindlessly letting them be used up and killed by the globalists.
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000]  David Eich, comments. Thank you, Martina.
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:26.000]  Albert Einstein had it right when he said the pioneers of a wall-less world are the youth that refuse military service. You know, what we have to understand is that when you join the military, you're not serving your country.
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:36.000]  You're not. You're serving the cabal that wishes to destroy your country and enslave your families. That's what you're there for.
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:52.000]  And you rightly point out, you're also there in a closed environment. And anyone that wants to experiment in terms of drugs of various kinds to see the effect and all the rest of it, do you want a closed environment?
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:58.000]  Do you want a group of people that you can observe, which without too much change?
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:11.000]  This is why, probably enough, they use a lot of islands with small populations to do their experiments of various kinds, because again, you've got an observable population that doesn't change too much.
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:20.000]  And that's why the military are perfect guinea pigs for this stuff. And that's what you're signing for. You are not there to serve your country.
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:21.000]  All right, let's go to another call.
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:26.000]  Those who are trying to destroy your country. And that applies to any country in the world.
[02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  Peggy and Indiana, you're on the air.
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:37.000]  I like his comment about ancient Sumer. And there's one more fact that I do know about that time that may add some insight.
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  When Sumer was first started and for hundreds of years after that, they did not feel as he had described the people of Sumer feeling and then people from that area, you know, down to the present being sort of not worth anything.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:49:06.000]  They had a different viewpoint. It was more of the, of the, they had a goddess-centered religion, more so than the later. And it didn't change until they were conquered by one of the step peoples.
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  And after that, it was completely different. And then their society slowly died.
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  Do you have any questions for David?
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:24.000]  Yes. I wanted to comment about different, different types of people having different types of religions. You know, some people can live for, well, I think...
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  Okay. Well, thank you, Peggy. You have the comments on what you said.
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  I can say this, Alex. You know, this obviously won't go down well with a great number of people. But, you know, when you study religion, whatever religion it is, invariably you find the same blueprint.
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  And that blueprint is us down here, the deity up there. Now, that applies no matter almost what religion you're talking about.
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  And the dynamics is the we're down here. We're either sinners, or we have to do whatever Allah wants, or we have to do whatever Yahweh wants and all the rest of it.
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:14.000]  And then you have a middleman and a woman, mostly middlemen section, which is telling you what the deity wants you to do.
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  Yeah, but Jesus said, Jesus said, get rid of the middleman, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and pray to God, communicate with God by yourself.
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:32.000]  Exactly. And what I'm talking about in the books that I write is that we have a direct connection with what I call infinite awareness.
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  People call that God, whatever they like. The name doesn't matter. It's what it is, is what it stands for. It's the infinite potential.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  Revelation is accurately predicting everything that's happening. I know you would say that was predictive programming being laid down.
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:50.000]  But regardless, you know, I see the New World Order system attacking Christianity first and foremost.
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:58.000]  And in my instinct, in my gut, you know, I know it's the truth. But there's the false modern man's Christianity. I have nothing to do with that.

[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000]  I want to thank everybody for their support there.
[02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000]  Jack in Illinois, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:05.000]  Hi, Alex and David. It's an honor to speak with both of you.
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:10.000]  David, I'd like to thank you for being instrumental in my awakening.
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  I'd like to make two quick points. One is that from my research, ETs are benevolent for the most part.
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:24.000]  And so they are going to probably mislead us with a false flag alien attack.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:27.000]  I don't even use the word alien. I use the word ET.
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:34.000]  I would suggest if you haven't talked to or mentioned Dr. Stephen Greer at ccedi.com. He's an excellent source.
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:42.000]  The most important thing, David, I would like to have you expand on and talk about the fear and how fear plays into the hands of the dark hacks.
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000]  Okay. Thank you. Briefly.
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:50.000]  Well, I think some are benevolent and some are neutral. And I think there is a force that is extremely negative.
[02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:56.000]  And that's the one behind the control system. And that's the one that won't be talking about in their fake disclosure.
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:59.000]  It should be a load of nonsense to divert attention.
[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  In terms of fear, yes. Of course, once you're in fear, you give your power away to anyone you think can protect you from what you've been manipulated to fear.
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:16.000]  The whole system of control is based on fear. And fear equals I have no power. It's just another extreme way of saying that.
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:19.000]  You have no power. You don't express any power. You're a slave.
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:23.000]  All right. Briefly. Naomi in Hawaii. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:27.000]  Hi. I'm calling to see if David Eich will be coming back to Hawaii soon.
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:34.000]  Well, that's funny because I've just had an invite which I've not yet replied to because it's just crazy here at the moment.
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:40.000]  And I shall reply. Yes, I'd like to. So the answer is almost certainly yes.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:43.000]  And probably enough, Alex, I'm coming to America in 10 days.
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:47.000]  I'm talking in New York on October 17th in Times Square, Nokia Theater.
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:51.000]  And then I'm going on the next weekend, October 23rd in San Francisco.
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  The Nokia Theater is big. I mean, you've gone from 15 years ago talking to groups of 20 to talking to 2,000.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:08.000]  Well, the Nokia Theater is almost full in terms of this coming 10 days now, not much more than that.
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:11.000]  But so people want to come. They have to be quick.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:16.000]  And San Francisco is a big theater, too. And it's amazing all over the world.
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:22.000]  Now, I've been asked to go to the Ukraine. I'm coming to the next year to Mexico and all these different countries I've never been into before.
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:26.000]  It's going. It is happening, Alex. It's very, very encouraging.
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000]  Naomi, anything on the other side?
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000]  Naomi, anything else?
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000]  No, just thank you so much.
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:35.000]  Thank you, Naomi. I'll see you in Hawaii someday then, maybe.
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:39.000]  Thank you. I'm sorry the other callers were flat out of time.
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:44.000]  The Jesse Ventura exclusive interview is coming up in about T minus two or three minutes.
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:48.000]  But David, you know, you've talked about all these issues and so much what you talk about.
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:51.000]  I can document some of it. You know, I know it's from your research.
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:56.000]  And but I mean, regardless, so much what you talk about is now, you know, becoming so mainstream.
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:59.000]  All I know is the government and the media are hyping that aliens are real.
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  I think they're going to stage something.
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:04.000]  You know, I can't get the public to admit FEMA camps when they're on record.
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:08.000]  But very interesting talking to you, always informative.
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:20.000]  And I look forward to speaking to you in the very near future. Perhaps we can have you pop in during the October 14th, 25 hour marathon broadcast just in a few weeks.
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:23.000]  So I'm going to put you on hold, David, here at the end of the show.
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:26.000]  I should be. I think I'll be in New York at that time actually.
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:30.000]  Yeah, and maybe just do 30 minutes or something just to pop in while you're here in the U.S.
[02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:34.000]  So I'm going to put you on hold right now at the end of the main three hour broadcast.
[02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000]  We'll get that set up.
[02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:41.000]  Good job to the crew. Jesse Ventura coming up, infowars.com. Listen to the audio streams.
