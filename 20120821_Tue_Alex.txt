[00:00.000 --> 00:08.080]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08.080 --> 00:19.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:19.400 --> 00:24.160]  To better understand the current state of modern day media manipulation, we must first
[00:24.160 --> 00:30.520]  look at the father of propaganda, Edward Bernays. His influence on the 20th century
[00:30.520 --> 00:37.480]  rivaled that of his uncles, Sigmund Freud, as Bernays pioneered the idea of crowd psychology
[00:37.480 --> 00:43.240]  with Freud's psychoanalytical ideas in what would become a new political ideal on how
[00:43.240 --> 00:47.880]  to control the masses.
[00:47.880 --> 00:54.680]  In his 1928 book Propaganda, Bernays wrote, if we understand the mechanisms and motives
[00:54.680 --> 01:01.600]  of the group mind, it is now possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will
[01:01.600 --> 01:03.440]  without them knowing it.
[01:03.440 --> 01:09.760]  He called it the engineering of consent and proposed that those who manipulate this unseen
[01:09.760 --> 01:15.440]  mechanism of society constitute an invisible government, which is the true ruling power
[01:15.440 --> 01:17.760]  of our country.
[01:17.760 --> 01:23.800]  It was Bernays who introduced the corporate giants to crowd psychology methods and polished
[01:23.800 --> 01:30.040]  techniques to manipulate society. He convinced the population to buy on impulse things they
[01:30.040 --> 01:41.480]  didn't even need by linking mass-produced goods to their own unconscious desires.
[01:41.480 --> 01:47.640]  The tobacco industry hired Bernays to persuade women to take up smoking, and the Alcoa aluminum
[01:47.640 --> 01:57.480]  company asked him to drive the campaign for the national fluoridation of our water supply.
[01:57.480 --> 02:02.840]  A consumerist culture was born, and the U.S. government took notice.
[02:02.840 --> 02:08.760]  In addition to famous corporate giants, Bernays also began working for the federal government.
[02:08.760 --> 02:13.920]  They adopted his technique of manufacturing ever-present dangers and then maintaining
[02:13.920 --> 02:20.160]  a constant state of fear to give those in power greater control of what Bernays called
[02:20.160 --> 02:21.840]  the mass mind.
[02:21.840 --> 02:27.600]  Edward Bernays, who's the father of modern advertising and propaganda, he literally wrote
[02:27.600 --> 02:33.120]  the book Propaganda. Joseph Goebbels on record, the Nazi propaganda minister, used a lot of
[02:33.120 --> 02:40.000]  his information and twisted it to his own designs. Bernays was the chief psychological
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.280]  warfare expert for more than 20 years, advising the Department of War. He advised them to
[02:45.280 --> 02:49.440]  call it defense, don't be honest anymore, call it the Department of Defense because
[02:49.440 --> 03:06.120]  you're actually going to run giant imperial slaughter operations.
[03:06.120 --> 03:13.120]  It's missing in all kinds of things, you know.
[03:13.120 --> 03:31.120]  It's missing, it's missing in all kinds of things, you know.
[03:31.120 --> 03:38.120]  It's missing, it's missing in all kinds of things, you know.
[03:38.120 --> 03:49.120]  It's missing, it's missing in all kinds of things, you know.
[03:49.120 --> 04:09.120]  It's missing, it's missing in all kinds of things, you know.
[04:09.120 --> 04:34.120]  It's missing, it's missing in all kinds of things, you know.
[04:34.120 --> 04:46.120]  It's missing, it's missing in all kinds of things, you know.
[04:46.120 --> 05:01.120]  Baby, baby, baby, I'm going to leave you.
[05:01.120 --> 05:26.120]  It's missing, it's missing in all kinds of things, you know.
[05:26.120 --> 05:53.120]  It's missing in all kinds of things, you know.
[05:53.120 --> 06:21.120]  It's missing, it's missing in all kinds of things, you know.
[06:21.120 --> 06:50.120]  It's missing, it's missing in all kinds of things, you know.
[06:50.120 --> 07:00.120]  It's missing, it's missing in all kinds of things, you know.
[07:20.120 --> 07:49.120]  It's missing, it's missing in all kinds of things, you know.
[07:49.120 --> 08:16.120]  It's missing in all kinds of things, you know.
[08:16.120 --> 08:41.120]  Well, my friends, the war drums are beating louder than they ever have.
[08:41.120 --> 08:52.120]  The war with Iran and a, quote, U.S. strike, that means a banker strike through our military against Syria after they've sent an al-Qaeda to destabilize the country.
[08:52.120 --> 09:09.120]  It is crazy, the amount of off-the-chart news and information that we're going to be covering here on this Tuesday, 21st day of August 2012 worldwide broadcast.
[09:09.120 --> 09:13.120]  And we are going to, again, be here for the next three hours.
[09:13.120 --> 09:16.120]  Here is the news that we have in front of us.
[09:16.120 --> 09:22.120]  Netanyahu determined to attack Iran before U.S. elections claims Israel's Channel 10.
[09:22.120 --> 09:31.120]  TV reporter adds, I doubt Obama could say anything that would convince the prime minister to delay a possible attack.
[09:31.120 --> 09:48.120]  Continuing, war with Iran appears more imminent, New American magazine, World Net Daily, when Israel strikes Iran in October by Joseph Farah, BBC, Obama warns Syria, chemical weapons use may spark U.S. action.
[09:48.120 --> 09:50.120]  What have we been saying for a month?
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.120]  They're going to have a false flag claiming Syria used chemical weapons.
[09:54.120 --> 09:57.120]  Unbelievable.
[09:57.120 --> 10:02.120]  Meanwhile, our criminal government run by foreign banks publicly runs al-Qaeda.
[10:02.120 --> 10:08.120]  There's an article by Tony Cardilucci up at infowarch.com with that, U.S. desperation services in Syria.
[10:08.120 --> 10:17.120]  But I don't say U.S. we're a proxy state that is used by the globalists who are busy destroying all nation states as fast as they can.
[10:17.120 --> 10:28.120]  So that is just some of what is coming up. Again, global research, Professor Chassadowski, Israel's war plans to attack Iran before the U.S. election.
[10:28.120 --> 10:32.120]  It's just coming out of all these sources.
[10:32.120 --> 10:35.120]  We're going to be breaking it all down today.
[10:35.120 --> 10:48.120]  Also, Russia, China warn West against Syrian intervention saying it would violate international law and saying they're not going to stand by and watch that happen.
[10:48.120 --> 10:51.120]  You know, the Russia and China have vetoed.
[10:51.120 --> 10:54.120]  And again, it's not that I'm siding with Russia and China.
[10:54.120 --> 10:55.120]  My government's gone.
[10:55.120 --> 11:00.120]  It was captured by foreign banks who brag that they've captured the country.
[11:00.120 --> 11:08.120]  But it is the bankers through the United States, Western Europe, England, NATO that are menacing and sending in proxy jihadis.
[11:08.120 --> 11:14.120]  Al-Qaeda, Wahhabist, murdering the Christians, the Jews, the Alawite Muslims.
[11:14.120 --> 11:16.120]  I mean, it's incredible.
[11:16.120 --> 11:19.120]  It's so off the chart immoral.
[11:19.120 --> 11:30.120]  And the prostitute corporatist media plays off the ignorance the American people and others. And it's like, yeah, we got to go into Libya and Syria because Al-Qaeda.
[11:30.120 --> 11:36.120]  They actually say because Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, Qaddafi's with Al-Qaeda, Assad's with Al-Qaeda.
[11:36.120 --> 11:39.120]  I mean, that's how dumb they think you are.
[11:39.120 --> 11:49.120]  Like when Bush said that Sunnis were Shiites and Muhammad Karzai said, no, no, sir, they're two different groups. And he said, no, they're not.
[11:49.120 --> 11:51.120]  It wasn't that Bush was wrong.
[11:51.120 --> 11:53.120]  He wasn't making a mistake.
[11:53.120 --> 11:59.120]  He was throwing it in everyone's face, flaunting it, destroying reality, poking holes in it.
[11:59.120 --> 12:06.120]  The world economy is being imploded by design to establish the global corporate banking monopoly government.
[12:06.120 --> 12:09.120]  The New World Order, Gen. 21.
[12:09.120 --> 12:14.120]  And I told you, when they try to put the capstone on the pyramid, they're going to launch giant wars.
[12:14.120 --> 12:16.120]  Biggins.
[12:16.120 --> 12:22.120]  And that's what they've got the martial law ready for, is the wars and the collapse and all of it.
[12:22.120 --> 12:26.120]  And they're going to tell the public, just do what you're told during the crisis.
[12:26.120 --> 12:30.120]  And when order is restored, everything will be okay.
[12:30.120 --> 12:32.120]  But that's not the case.
[12:32.120 --> 12:36.120]  And I hope there's ways to back this off, but you see everything converging.
[12:36.120 --> 12:45.120]  The election, these conflicts, these larger wars, the world lining up, squaring off, all of this.
[12:45.120 --> 12:51.120]  So the Russians of their own corrupt system, the Chinese are more merged with the globalist.
[12:51.120 --> 12:57.120]  But it's kind of a Mexican standoff there where both sides are balancing against each other.
[12:57.120 --> 13:03.120]  But basically, it's globalists who just opportunistically are playing all of these different factions off against each other.
[13:03.120 --> 13:06.120]  And they win out of the chaos.
[13:06.120 --> 13:08.120]  And they get to pose as the saviors.
[13:08.120 --> 13:14.120]  And their puppet minions get higher approval ratings once this happens and can take liberties.
[13:14.120 --> 13:19.120]  And then they can stage terror attacks or open the door for people to attack.
[13:19.120 --> 13:23.120]  And then use that to crack down on the general public.
[13:23.120 --> 13:30.120]  I told you over a decade ago they'd shift from Al Qaeda to conservatives, libertarians, gun owners, veterans.
[13:30.120 --> 13:32.120]  And you saw it then come out in the government documents.
[13:32.120 --> 13:37.120]  I told you the army would start claiming, because it was an ADL, Southern Prairie Law Center propaganda,
[13:37.120 --> 13:44.120]  and some of their fronts were putting it out, that the Tea Party was going to link up with Al Qaeda.
[13:44.120 --> 13:50.120]  That's now in major army training battle plan scenarios.
[13:50.120 --> 14:00.120]  Yes, they say that in North Carolina the Tea Party is going to radicalize and merge with Al Qaeda.
[14:00.120 --> 14:03.120]  And illegal aliens, I forgot that part.
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.120]  I mean, that's like saying that the lamb will lie down with the lion.
[14:07.120 --> 14:10.120]  I mean, it's like saying Superman is Lex Luthor.
[14:10.120 --> 14:13.120]  I mean, it is Lex Luthor, whatever his name is.
[14:13.120 --> 14:18.120]  It is so ridiculous, ridiculous.
[14:18.120 --> 14:21.120]  But this is what they're going to do.
[14:21.120 --> 14:24.120]  And more and more, it looks like they're getting ready to pull the trigger on this.
[14:24.120 --> 14:26.120]  I hope we can back them off.
[14:26.120 --> 14:28.120]  And there still may be a miracle.
[14:28.120 --> 14:32.120]  But I want to hear from all of you on this topic.
[14:32.120 --> 14:35.120]  Do you think everything's going to be okay?
[14:35.120 --> 14:37.120]  Do you think this is all just more saber rattling, which I hope it is?
[14:37.120 --> 14:40.120]  You know, they had three different joint chiefs of staff, chairman.
[14:40.120 --> 14:47.120]  Two different heads of sent com basically resigned in the last decade over not wanting to go to war with Iran.
[14:47.120 --> 14:50.120]  There's been a lot of people have held back this madness.
[14:50.120 --> 14:55.120]  They've had massage chiefs, you know, resigned or fired over it.
[14:55.120 --> 14:58.120]  They've had the head of the IDF say it's not a good idea.
[14:58.120 --> 15:00.120]  I mean, you know it's bad.
[15:00.120 --> 15:04.120]  But even the Hawks in Israel don't want to do this because it'll be bad for Israel.
[15:04.120 --> 15:07.120]  But it'll be good for the new world order.
[15:07.120 --> 15:11.120]  You better believe this crisis is going to hurt every nation state.
[15:11.120 --> 15:17.120]  Iran, Israel, Lebanon, the United States, Europe, everywhere.
[15:17.120 --> 15:20.120]  This will be used as the political cover.
[15:20.120 --> 15:26.120]  They always do this World War One, World War Two at the beginning of or right at the end of an economic crash.
[15:26.120 --> 15:27.120]  This is what you have.
[15:27.120 --> 15:34.120]  You have the the imploding economy, the looting and then a war collapse and war or war and collapse.
[15:34.120 --> 15:35.120]  They all circle each other.
[15:35.120 --> 15:38.120]  Birds of a feather fly together.
[15:38.120 --> 15:41.120]  So I want to hear from you on this subject.
[15:41.120 --> 15:45.120]  You're quick and fast and, you know, your take where you think we're going.
[15:45.120 --> 15:54.120]  What all these giant preparations, the billion 400 million rounds of ammo, the armored pill boxes, the army manuals for reeducation camps.
[15:54.120 --> 15:57.120]  I mean, wow.
[15:57.120 --> 15:59.120]  And they set the precedent.
[15:59.120 --> 16:06.120]  Well, let's, I mean, I've seen it at UT lectures where the former CI director Woolsey says we'll put all the Muslims in camps.
[16:06.120 --> 16:08.120]  They all Muslims in America in camps.
[16:08.120 --> 16:10.120]  And a lot of people like, yeah, that sounds good.
[16:10.120 --> 16:12.120]  It's going to be you that's in that camp.
[16:12.120 --> 16:16.120]  You wearing the John Deere hat, listening in Alabama right now.
[16:16.120 --> 16:20.120]  You Hank Williams, Jr.
[16:20.120 --> 16:22.120]  You are the target of this.
[16:22.120 --> 16:30.120]  And they use tribalism, your ancient ingrained tribalism of, oh, there's a foreigner that look like me.
[16:30.120 --> 16:38.120]  Let me growl because instinctively the threat humans have always faced is the tribe from over the hill or from across the sea that comes and you serve shoe.
[16:38.120 --> 16:39.120]  I understand it.
[16:39.120 --> 16:42.120]  I get the primitive systems.
[16:42.120 --> 16:46.120]  People like who looks like them, who smells like them, who talks like them.
[16:46.120 --> 16:47.120]  That's just culture.
[16:47.120 --> 16:48.120]  That's what humans are.
[16:48.120 --> 16:50.120]  We're tribalist, period.
[16:50.120 --> 16:52.120]  And the globalist manipulate that.
[16:52.120 --> 16:55.120]  That's what divide and conquer is a bunch of tribes fighting with each other.
[16:55.120 --> 17:15.120]  Instead of having a tribe that is for liberty and justice and human equity and freedom and creativity and the rule of law and science and honor and loving God and not having these churches superimpose themselves in front of it.
[17:15.120 --> 17:17.120]  That's what we're talking about here.
[17:17.120 --> 17:25.120]  And we've got to decide whether we want good or evil because no one can deny the world is hurtling towards disaster.
[17:25.120 --> 17:30.120]  I mean, there's already disaster worldwide, starvation, death, exploding food prices, riots.
[17:30.120 --> 17:39.120]  We live in a tiny island that even though it began to sink is still the highest point in the world other than Switzerland.
[17:39.120 --> 17:50.120]  We live on an island here in the United States in Canada and places like Scotland, places like even areas of Ireland, places like Switzerland.
[17:50.120 --> 17:59.120]  We live in islands of good, strong, common law, common sense culture.
[17:59.120 --> 18:04.120]  And all around us is absolute bedlam intensifying.
[18:04.120 --> 18:09.120]  And the globalist want to take America out in the final equation and bring in a tyranny here.
[18:09.120 --> 18:13.120]  And to do that, they want to start a civil war in this country.
[18:13.120 --> 18:22.120]  They plan to train the police and military and hype them up and teach them that their main enemy, like training an attack dog, is gun owning libertarian conservatives.
[18:22.120 --> 18:25.120]  That's why they seize on every cop killing, even though they're rare.
[18:25.120 --> 18:32.120]  They search their computer files of even associates of the reported killers, this case in Louisiana.
[18:32.120 --> 18:41.120]  And then they find one of them who's visited my website and come out with the headlines, the ADL yesterday, Alex Jones.
[18:41.120 --> 18:43.120]  Alex Jones.
[18:43.120 --> 18:48.120]  You know, these guys loved Alex Jones.
[18:48.120 --> 18:50.120]  Why is that?
[18:50.120 --> 18:57.120]  Because the globalist understand that I'm aware of their game plan and they hope that you don't catch on to it.
[18:57.120 --> 19:02.120]  They want to get a civil war going between the police, the military and the citizens,
[19:02.120 --> 19:09.120]  which will chew up the police and military and further radicalize them into a real terrorist force.
[19:09.120 --> 19:13.120]  Then they'll get out the old guard, bring in the new guard with mercenaries and foreigners.
[19:13.120 --> 19:16.120]  They train for an NLE09, you name it.
[19:16.120 --> 19:18.120]  We're going to be breaking that down today.
[19:18.120 --> 19:25.120]  But first, I want your take on what I've said here, and I'll get into some of the incredible geopolitical developments as well.

[24:17.120 --> 24:22.120]  And I started out of town, yeah.
[24:22.120 --> 24:31.120]  All of a sudden, I saw Sherry Dunn Brown came in to shoot me down.
[24:31.120 --> 24:36.120]  So I shot, I shot, I shot them down.
[24:36.120 --> 24:39.120]  And I said,
[24:39.120 --> 24:56.120]  The Globalist orchestrated the build-up to World War I to destroy the old order in Europe and bring in this corporatist British Empire model through corporate governance.
[24:56.120 --> 25:00.120]  They've written books on it. Carol Quigley's written about it. They brag about it.
[25:00.120 --> 25:14.120]  They engineered World War II. Hitler didn't work for them, but they funded him. They psychologically profiled him. They shut him up. They gave him the funding and then knocked him down after he wrecked Europe, just like they funded the Soviets.
[25:14.120 --> 25:27.120]  The people running our government created Al Qaeda. They created the Russian Soviet. They created the Nazis. They are the eugenicists. They are the full spectrum dominance science guild.
[25:27.120 --> 25:33.120]  Who cold-bloodily see us as like rats or bacteria in a Petri dish. That's how they describe us.
[25:33.120 --> 25:48.120]  Well, I don't like it. And I had a caller yesterday who said, what is the point of debating Romney and Obama and who's the lesser of two evils when they're chemtrailing us, when the GMO, when the cancer rates are exploding?
[25:48.120 --> 26:03.120]  And it's true. The reality is so much more wild than even debating whatever the news is. But let me tell you something. War is a big deal because that's what they bring in to sell giant change.
[26:03.120 --> 26:11.120]  And the fact that it looks like the light is going green again, it went green last year for a little while.
[26:11.120 --> 26:19.120]  But there were a lot of news reports coming out that it was made up news stories that the Iranians were going to attack the Saudi embassy and all that.
[26:19.120 --> 26:31.120]  And it got backed off again. But believe me, if there is an opposition to this Iran strike and going into Syria, I told you six months ago they start calling for boots on the ground and bombing.
[26:31.120 --> 26:39.120]  Now they are. Told you what would happen in Libya. People are like, oh, they're not going to bomb. Oh, they're not going to invade. What happened?
[26:39.120 --> 26:48.120]  I mean, this is a big globalist move. And remember, they hate all sovereign nations. Good, bad, ugly and different. Assad, Iran, U.S.
[26:48.120 --> 26:57.120]  The globalists are busy using us to destroy their enemies while they enslave us. And nothing is better than a war.
[26:57.120 --> 27:03.120]  So we need to not have a civil war with the police and military. We do not need at the drop of a hat.
[27:03.120 --> 27:10.120]  In my view of the police show up at your house, shoot them. We do not need to do that. We do not need to go into war mode.
[27:10.120 --> 27:17.120]  And look, the globalists have pushed people into this. I would tell the police to, I would back off.
[27:17.120 --> 27:25.120]  I mean, we just do not need to have this happen. We need cooler minds to prevail here. Let's go to your calls, as I promised.
[27:25.120 --> 27:28.120]  Bob in Michigan, first caller, welcome.
[27:28.120 --> 27:31.120]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for having me on. I appreciate it.
[27:31.120 --> 27:32.120]  Appreciate you.
[27:32.120 --> 27:42.120]  I really think you've hit the nail on the head here, certainly. You and a lot of other talk show people have really done a good job in exposing this and keep doing that,
[27:42.120 --> 27:50.120]  because they don't like the light of day. They don't like the truth like Ron Paul is giving us.
[27:50.120 --> 28:02.120]  I think our best export from this country, honestly, is our Constitution and working together as a people, no matter where you're from.
[28:02.120 --> 28:07.120]  I'm only a second generation off the boat, Ellis Island, you know, the whole thing.
[28:07.120 --> 28:15.120]  My mother was in a industrial town in the Midwest when she grew up during World War II.
[28:15.120 --> 28:26.120]  She had stuff thrown at her and things like that. They looked like everybody else, but after the war, of course, they were their big buddies.
[28:26.120 --> 28:32.120]  They were always good citizens. They were always law-abiding, hardworking people.
[28:32.120 --> 28:46.120]  But I really think our biggest ace card here to play is the freedom, our background, and our history of tolerance.
[28:46.120 --> 28:55.120]  Some people may call that Christian ethics, albeit, but that doesn't mean that it's just for a small group of people.
[28:55.120 --> 29:05.120]  These people, no matter where they're from, rolling up their sleeves, getting with the program, and helping with this is going to be our answer.
[29:05.120 --> 29:10.120]  I couldn't agree with you more. The last thing we need is trouble. That's what they want.
[29:10.120 --> 29:18.120]  That'll give more excuses to go in and hurt people, destroy infrastructure, and all kinds of things we don't want.
[29:18.120 --> 29:24.120]  We have lots of countries overseas right now, and they're still recovering from war and having a bad time.
[29:24.120 --> 29:34.120]  Absolutely. The global issues are money and our blood to go wreck countries and then put worse people in and then our tax money pays to rebuild it with strings attached,
[29:34.120 --> 29:40.120]  with new ruling classes dominating and oppressing those countries. And I don't want that done in my name.
[29:40.120 --> 29:45.120]  Key information in your calls and a ton of news and a special guest all coming up.
[29:45.120 --> 29:50.120]  We're going right to your calls. On the other side, I'm Alex Jones.
[29:50.120 --> 29:57.120]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:21.120 --> 30:28.120]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from Eat Foods Direct now.
[30:28.120 --> 30:34.120]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, Eat Foods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply.
[30:34.120 --> 30:38.120]  I recently increased my supply from Eat Foods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[30:38.120 --> 30:44.120]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods. The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today.
[30:44.120 --> 30:51.120]  Because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost. Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633
[30:51.120 --> 30:59.120]  or go to EatFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex. Call 800-409-5633 or EatFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[30:59.120 --> 31:02.120]  You can bet your life on Eat Foods Direct.
[31:02.120 --> 31:08.120]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[31:08.120 --> 31:13.120]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[31:13.120 --> 31:21.120]  That's in the mainstream news every day. Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat
[31:21.120 --> 31:27.120]  that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity. I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[31:27.120 --> 31:31.120]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[31:31.120 --> 31:38.120]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling power hub unit.
[31:38.120 --> 31:44.120]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make. It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[31:44.120 --> 31:51.120]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar powered. That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[31:51.120 --> 32:09.120]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com. That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[32:21.120 --> 32:30.120]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles
[32:30.120 --> 32:36.120]  instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.

[32:54.120 --> 33:22.120]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[33:22.120 --> 33:37.120]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[33:37.120 --> 33:52.120]  Coming up at the bottom of the next hour, I am going to premiere to everybody the new cover of the inaugural edition of the InfoWars newspaper slash magazine.
[33:52.120 --> 34:07.120]  It's a format that's white, high quality magazine type paper, but it's the information that is important and powerful.
[34:07.120 --> 34:22.120]  The article that I put together, the opening letter from the publisher of why we're putting this publication out and breaking down the fact that we're dealing with a lot of new forms of censorship in the Internet.
[34:22.120 --> 34:27.120]  And this is our answer to the Internet kill switch. And I'm going to break that down at the bottom of the next hour.
[34:27.120 --> 34:37.120]  Coming on, he's written a very powerful book, Fool Me Twice, Aaron Kline, breaks down from Obama's own think tanks what they're planning if he gets in.
[34:37.120 --> 34:41.120]  Of course, that'll tell us what Romney's planning too, because they're all Rom of the same people.
[34:41.120 --> 34:44.120]  But this is what Obama is planning if he gets back into office.
[34:44.120 --> 34:51.120]  Then I had, of course, Webster Tarpley on last week for an hour and 45 minutes on the nightly news to break down what he thinks will happen if Romney gets in.
[34:51.120 --> 34:57.120]  And you know, Tarpley was a big enemy of Obama saying he was a total globalist, accurately predicting what Obama did do.
[34:57.120 --> 35:05.120]  He was saying last week that it's Romney who's going to get in now and look out because everybody's going to go to sleep and they're going to ram through their agenda.
[35:05.120 --> 35:11.120]  And sure enough, you saw Newsweek yesterday saying, hit the road.
[35:11.120 --> 35:21.120]  He actually said, guys, if you pull that up, I'm going for memory. It said hit the road, right? It said it's time for a new president.
[35:21.120 --> 35:24.120]  It says hit the road, Barak. Yeah.
[35:24.120 --> 35:33.120]  That's such a shocking headline. All the time I say stuff and it feels like a lie because it's so wild.
[35:33.120 --> 35:39.120]  I mean, all the time, I think about talking about some of our accomplishments or something and I go, I better not do that.
[35:39.120 --> 35:43.120]  It sounds like a lie. You know what I mean? Well, it's the same thing with this.
[35:43.120 --> 35:47.120]  I'm like, did it really say hit the road, Barack Obama? And I'm like, guys, check that.
[35:47.120 --> 35:50.120]  They pull it up and they go, yeah, that's how fast they are.
[35:50.120 --> 35:52.120]  Talk about quick draw in there on the Internet.
[35:52.120 --> 35:56.120]  In fact, put it up on screen when you get a chance.
[35:56.120 --> 36:06.120]  If you're a radio listener and you hear me say put it on screen, this or that, all you have to do is go watch us at prisonplanet.tv
[36:06.120 --> 36:11.120]  or infowarsnews.com and the word we've got streaming video for the three hour radio show.
[36:11.120 --> 36:14.120]  It really is a TV show, multimedia and then the nightly news.
[36:14.120 --> 36:19.120]  Hit the road, Barak. Why we need a new president by Ferguson.
[36:19.120 --> 36:26.120]  So very, very incendiary type comments for Newsweek.
[36:26.120 --> 36:33.120]  I don't think I've ever seen Newsweek or Time, even with Republicans that they claim to hate come out with something like that.
[36:33.120 --> 36:43.120]  I mean, this is incredible. Again, we're seeing all of these things that you don't normally see happening, telling you we're moving towards a flashpoint.
[36:43.120 --> 36:52.120]  And that happens throughout history where more happens in just a year or two period than happened in the previous 2030.
[36:52.120 --> 36:54.120]  It's those flashpoints in history.
[36:54.120 --> 37:00.120]  And my gut, my intellect, my research, other researchers intellect your gut.
[37:00.120 --> 37:10.120]  I know most of my listeners are pretty concerned. Everybody can feel kind of like mice know a day before a tornado comes that, you know, something's coming.
[37:10.120 --> 37:19.120]  I mean, is it magnetic when they've proven mice and fish and other animals have these little magnetic sensors in their brain cells?
[37:19.120 --> 37:26.120]  That's how birds, that's how hummingbirds can fly to Connecticut and fly to Guatemala back.
[37:26.120 --> 37:31.120]  I was looking at a bird book this morning because I follow birds and we've got some hummingbird feeders.
[37:31.120 --> 37:42.120]  I saw a hummingbird I hadn't seen before. So I looked it up and it turns out it's a hummingbird that goes as far north as Wisconsin and then flies back to Guatemala.
[37:42.120 --> 37:50.120]  It hatches as a baby and knows where to fly to the same place and then fly back.
[37:50.120 --> 38:00.120]  Just amazing. And that's done with the magnetic field of the earth. They've done tests where they've, you know, I'm digressing.
[38:00.120 --> 38:12.120]  If you just joined us, ladies and gentlemen, Netanyahu determined to attack Iran before U.S. elections claims Israel's Channel 10.
[38:12.120 --> 38:20.120]  World Net Daily says when Israel strikes Iran in October, let's get Joe Farah on it. He has a lot of big sources there in D.C.
[38:20.120 --> 38:24.120]  And so I'd like to get Farah popping for 30 minutes every next week. Give us his breakdown on that.
[38:24.120 --> 38:29.120]  We're going to be going over that. Also, war with Iran appears more imminent.
[38:29.120 --> 38:34.120]  New American, BBC, Obama warns Syria chemical weapons may spark U.S. action.
[38:34.120 --> 38:39.120]  And we've been saying for three weeks or so a false flag where Al Qaeda launches the chemical attack.
[38:39.120 --> 38:44.120]  They say Assad's done it and then NATO has to attack. Well, that's what they're now saying. So look out.
[38:44.120 --> 38:50.120]  We're going to be breaking all of this down and more. Russia and China warn West against Syrian intervention.
[38:50.120 --> 38:59.120]  They're already sending in jihadis out of Turkey. We've got a bunch of other news here.
[38:59.120 --> 39:03.120]  Also, the nanny state is out of control. Cover this in the third hour.
[39:03.120 --> 39:06.120]  Cops interrogate family for allowing kids to play outside.
[39:06.120 --> 39:12.120]  Well, I mean, I've seen this with CPS all over the country. Children playing in fenced backyards.
[39:12.120 --> 39:17.120]  CPS comes and calls it neglect, even though the mother is washing them out of the window.
[39:17.120 --> 39:21.120]  Let me tell you something. When I was a kid, I ran around everywhere.
[39:21.120 --> 39:26.120]  And statistically, things were a little more dangerous than they were in the 50s, 60s or 70s,
[39:26.120 --> 39:30.120]  but not as dangerous as they were in the 80s or 90s. I mean, this is just a joke.
[39:30.120 --> 39:34.120]  And then it's always the government that claims they're going to take your kids to keep them safe
[39:34.120 --> 39:37.120]  when they're the most dangerous group for your children to be in their clutches.
[39:37.120 --> 39:39.120]  And not just here, but in Russia and other places.
[39:39.120 --> 39:43.120]  The orphanages are veritable hell pits, but going to be getting into that.
[39:43.120 --> 39:47.120]  Russian woman kills elderly neighbor with her bra associated press.
[39:47.120 --> 39:53.120]  The answer is obvious, ban bras. And I'm going to cover this too in the third hour.
[39:53.120 --> 39:55.120]  In fact, at the start of the third hour, I'll get into this.
[39:55.120 --> 40:02.120]  ADL implies Alex Jones inspired inspiration behind Louisiana cop killings.
[40:02.120 --> 40:07.120]  And I'm going to have a message directly to the Anti-Defamation League
[40:07.120 --> 40:10.120]  coming up eight after in the third hour.
[40:10.120 --> 40:14.120]  Okay, let's go through calls now. Let's go to Randy in Ohio. Thanks for holding.
[40:14.120 --> 40:17.120]  What is your view on the geopolitical things happening?
[40:17.120 --> 40:22.120]  I mean, do you think we're on the edge of oblivion or is everything going to be just fine?
[40:22.120 --> 40:28.120]  Well, Alex, you know, you look at it in the fact of good talking to you today, by the way.
[40:28.120 --> 40:34.120]  You look at it in the fact of our intervention in Syria right now.
[40:34.120 --> 40:38.120]  And the dominoes are starting to fall. You look at Tunisia, you look at Egypt.
[40:38.120 --> 40:44.120]  Basically, what we're doing is a big resource grab in order to move into Iran.
[40:44.120 --> 40:49.120]  So once that Syria falls, we can build a pipeline from Northern Iraq into Syria
[40:49.120 --> 40:52.120]  so we can do shipping routes to the Mediterranean Sea.
[40:52.120 --> 40:55.120]  So if they do try to close down the straight of her move,
[40:55.120 --> 40:59.120]  we have a shipping route to circumvent that,
[40:59.120 --> 41:04.120]  which will allow us our access to Iran without interrupting shipping.
[41:04.120 --> 41:09.120]  Yes, yes, yes, that's the Grand Chess Board, Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[41:09.120 --> 41:16.120]  But when we say we, we're paying for it, just like we paid back in the 70s and 80s
[41:16.120 --> 41:20.120]  to put in the big drilling rigs and oil pipelines,
[41:20.120 --> 41:25.120]  20% of the oil of Alaska is allowed to be shipped to the West Coast.
[41:25.120 --> 41:31.120]  The rest of it per agreement is shipped to Japan and China.
[41:31.120 --> 41:34.120]  So again, we go pay.
[41:34.120 --> 41:36.120]  It'd be one thing if we were going there to steal the oil,
[41:36.120 --> 41:38.120]  because I hear good old boys all the time go,
[41:38.120 --> 41:41.120]  hey, we need that oil.
[41:41.120 --> 41:44.120]  I'll admit it, we're going to come take your oil.
[41:44.120 --> 41:46.120]  You've been here looking, we don't glass parking lot.
[41:46.120 --> 41:48.120]  It was some hydrogen bombs, boy.
[41:48.120 --> 41:50.120]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[41:50.120 --> 41:53.120]  The globalist hate good old boys even more than they hate Arabs.
[41:53.120 --> 42:00.120]  I mean, if you actually compared the average Muslim to a good old boy in, say,
[42:00.120 --> 42:05.120]  East Texas, they're a lot more similar than some, you know,
[42:05.120 --> 42:08.120]  globalist, eugenicist, fake liberal.
[42:08.120 --> 42:14.120]  You know, I mean, they want guns, you know, they're into freedom, basic freedom.
[42:14.120 --> 42:17.120]  And again, I'm not even defending some of the Muslim sex out there.
[42:17.120 --> 42:20.120]  The point is, is that this isn't our empire.
[42:20.120 --> 42:22.120]  I always say, we're in Iraq.
[42:22.120 --> 42:23.120]  We're in Afghanistan.
[42:23.120 --> 42:24.120]  No, we're not.
[42:24.120 --> 42:27.120]  Our captured military under globalist control.
[42:27.120 --> 42:32.120]  It'd be like if Hitler took over France in 1941, you know,
[42:32.120 --> 42:36.120]  if Hitler took over France and he had the Vichy French and the police,
[42:36.120 --> 42:38.120]  the military were already been paid off by him.
[42:38.120 --> 42:40.120]  So they just basically stood down.
[42:40.120 --> 42:43.120]  And then if Hitler would have sent French legions,
[42:43.120 --> 42:48.120]  which he actually did have some French battle groups off to fight a war,
[42:48.120 --> 42:51.120]  it's not the French military off fighting the war.
[42:51.120 --> 42:52.120]  It's collaborators.
[42:52.120 --> 42:54.120]  So this is a banker globalist system.
[42:54.120 --> 42:57.120]  And we've got to get those definitions in our mind.
[42:57.120 --> 43:01.120]  It is not our military is not growing opium in Afghanistan.
[43:01.120 --> 43:06.120]  Our captured soldiers who were under mind control, cultural mind control,
[43:06.120 --> 43:08.120]  and who don't even know who they're fighting for,
[43:08.120 --> 43:12.120]  are over there growing the opium to ship it all over the world.
[43:12.120 --> 43:13.120]  I'm sorry.
[43:13.120 --> 43:14.120]  I'm ranting.
[43:14.120 --> 43:15.120]  Go ahead and make a point.
[43:15.120 --> 43:16.120]  No, and I agree with you.
[43:16.120 --> 43:18.120]  But what I don't, I don't agree with the timeline of October.
[43:18.120 --> 43:22.120]  It's not going to be an October surprise because we have to secure Syria
[43:22.120 --> 43:24.120]  in order to secure the pipeline routes.
[43:24.120 --> 43:29.120]  So we're probably looking at an attack with Iran feasibly within the next year or two.
[43:29.120 --> 43:32.120]  It won't be this year because we don't have Syria under control.
[43:32.120 --> 43:33.120]  Well, that's right.
[43:33.120 --> 43:35.120]  They need to get not Syria out first.
[43:35.120 --> 43:39.120]  And that's why they wanted the Al Qaeda to be able to have secured the job
[43:39.120 --> 43:42.120]  and get down to the important business of murdering all the Christians and Jews
[43:42.120 --> 43:47.120]  and minority Muslim groups because the peace prize president said so.
[43:47.120 --> 43:48.120]  And it's so loving.
[43:48.120 --> 43:54.120]  But that's why they could attack and bombard Damascus with a peace bombardment
[43:54.120 --> 43:56.120]  like Libya any time now.
[43:56.120 --> 44:02.120]  And sounds like you're, are you in the military?
[44:02.120 --> 44:03.120]  I'm not.
[44:03.120 --> 44:04.120]  No.
[44:04.120 --> 44:08.120]  Well, I just, I've researched a lot about
[44:08.120 --> 44:13.120]  about this and about pipelines and pipeline politics that are going on,
[44:13.120 --> 44:16.120]  that have been going on with our country and the different,
[44:16.120 --> 44:19.120]  I mean, people say the Cold War is over, but it's not over.
[44:19.120 --> 44:23.120]  I mean, we're in a resource grab and we're in a race against China and Russia right now.
[44:23.120 --> 44:24.120]  That's what I just said.
[44:24.120 --> 44:25.120]  We are not in a race though.
[44:25.120 --> 44:27.120]  Look, they tell the generals.
[44:27.120 --> 44:34.120]  The generals get up there on C-SPAN at these Army and Navy and Marine Corps war college events.
[44:34.120 --> 44:37.120]  Air Force has events and they say,
[44:37.120 --> 44:40.120]  we work for Wall Street, Wall Street's doing a great job dominating.
[44:40.120 --> 44:42.120]  We're getting resources for our people.
[44:42.120 --> 44:44.120]  Let me explain something.
[44:44.120 --> 44:47.120]  The globalists work to make sure we don't get our resources.
[44:47.120 --> 44:49.120]  We're already would be self-sufficient.
[44:49.120 --> 44:52.120]  Globalism is about not letting countries be self-sufficient.
[44:52.120 --> 44:54.120]  That's why they want that oil over there.
[44:54.120 --> 45:00.120]  So China and Iran and India and Russia can't get their own resources
[45:00.120 --> 45:02.120]  and develop themselves.
[45:02.120 --> 45:05.120]  The bankers don't want anybody developed, sir.
[45:05.120 --> 45:07.120]  They want everybody under their control.
[45:07.120 --> 45:10.120]  So I agree with what you're saying in generality,
[45:10.120 --> 45:13.120]  but I don't agree with you going back to the thing saying we're in a resource grab.
[45:13.120 --> 45:17.120]  The globalists strategically have moved to China.
[45:17.120 --> 45:19.120]  That's the real future.
[45:19.120 --> 45:22.120]  When they're done with us, China's going to be the center of the world, okay?
[45:22.120 --> 45:25.120]  And China has been positioned to get,
[45:25.120 --> 45:29.120]  I said 95% because my mind automatically ratchets down.
[45:29.120 --> 45:33.120]  It's 98.7% of all rare earth minerals.
[45:33.120 --> 45:35.120]  Look it up.
[45:35.120 --> 45:39.120]  Guys just type in 98% of rare earth minerals controlled or mined by China
[45:39.120 --> 45:42.120]  are dominated by China.
[45:42.120 --> 45:43.120]  Okay?
[45:43.120 --> 45:45.120]  That's what's going on here.
[45:45.120 --> 45:46.120]  Okay?
[45:46.120 --> 45:48.120]  And the globalists position themselves.
[45:48.120 --> 45:52.120]  Ted Turner, Marie Strong, the British royalty, the Rothschilds, all of them,
[45:52.120 --> 45:55.120]  the Rockefellers, everything's in China now.
[45:55.120 --> 45:57.120]  China, China, China, China, China, China.
[45:57.120 --> 45:59.120]  For a lot of different strategic reasons.
[45:59.120 --> 46:03.120]  They can leverage out anybody's competition with cheaper goods.
[46:03.120 --> 46:05.120]  They'll follow a one-shot policy.
[46:05.120 --> 46:07.120]  They do what the globalists say.
[46:07.120 --> 46:10.120]  That's because our government put Mao Zedong and power in 49.
[46:10.120 --> 46:12.120]  That's been declassified.
[46:12.120 --> 46:13.120]  Okay?
[46:13.120 --> 46:16.120]  The Communist Chinese are in bed with the globalist,
[46:16.120 --> 46:20.120]  who they then plan to double cross what's left of the United States.
[46:20.120 --> 46:21.120]  I'm sorry.
[46:21.120 --> 46:22.120]  I appreciate your call.
[46:22.120 --> 46:23.120]  A very interesting point.
[46:23.120 --> 46:24.120]  So I'm ranting here.
[46:24.120 --> 46:26.120]  Who's up next here?
[46:26.120 --> 46:28.120]  Jason in Pennsylvania.
[46:28.120 --> 46:29.120]  You're on the air.
[46:29.120 --> 46:30.120]  Go ahead.
[46:30.120 --> 46:31.120]  Gerald Jones.
[46:31.120 --> 46:32.120]  God bless you.
[46:32.120 --> 46:33.120]  How are you doing today?
[46:33.120 --> 46:34.120]  I'm all right, brother.
[46:34.120 --> 46:35.120]  What's on your mind?
[46:35.120 --> 46:36.120]  Good, good.
[46:36.120 --> 46:38.120]  I got my rabble rouser next to me here.
[46:38.120 --> 46:40.120]  I'm drinking it, and it's some good stuff, brother.
[46:40.120 --> 46:41.120]  I love it.
[46:41.120 --> 46:44.120]  For those that don't know, tell them what a rabble rouser is.
[46:44.120 --> 46:46.120]  It's an Alex Jones special.
[46:46.120 --> 46:49.120]  It's a tangy tangerine, one scoop of tangy tangerine,
[46:49.120 --> 46:51.120]  and a pollen burst, and it rules.
[46:51.120 --> 46:56.120]  Well, thank you so much for supporting us by getting out at infowarshealth.com.
[46:56.120 --> 46:59.120]  And thank you so much for calling out the broadcast.
[46:59.120 --> 47:00.120]  What's on your mind?
[47:00.120 --> 47:01.120]  Okay.
[47:01.120 --> 47:03.120]  Real quick, because I'm off topic.
[47:03.120 --> 47:08.120]  Alex, I pray to you, please go to homelandsecurityus.com.
[47:08.120 --> 47:10.120]  It's Doug Hagman's site.
[47:10.120 --> 47:11.120]  Okay.
[47:11.120 --> 47:14.120]  Fourth thing down on the main page right in the center column.
[47:14.120 --> 47:19.120]  There's an article entitled Christianity and gun owners in the crosshairs.
[47:19.120 --> 47:21.120]  Chilling tactic exposed.
[47:21.120 --> 47:22.120]  Okay.
[47:22.120 --> 47:24.120]  It's an article about what happened to me.
[47:24.120 --> 47:30.120]  I started a radio show myself recently, and I did a broadcast on August 7th.
[47:30.120 --> 47:31.120]  Okay.
[47:31.120 --> 47:36.120]  One of my buddies heard the broadcast, and I talked about how I didn't like Obama,
[47:36.120 --> 47:39.120]  that I think that the hammer's probably coming down pretty soon,
[47:39.120 --> 47:42.120]  and I picked up some firearms recently.
[47:42.120 --> 47:47.120]  Alex, the next day, August 8th, I was sitting in my home, and I got a call from a cop.
[47:47.120 --> 47:53.120]  And he said to me, Jason, I'd like you to come out on your porch for a second to talk to you.
[47:53.120 --> 47:55.120]  So this is what he says to me, Alex.
[47:55.120 --> 47:57.120]  He says, all right, so here's the thing.
[47:57.120 --> 47:59.120]  You have to come with us.
[47:59.120 --> 48:01.120]  I said, sir, what is this about?
[48:01.120 --> 48:08.120]  He said my friend from New York called and said that he was concerned about me and was worried about me.
[48:08.120 --> 48:09.120]  So this is what happened.
[48:09.120 --> 48:10.120]  He 302ed me.
[48:10.120 --> 48:18.120]  He called the CMC and under law 302 in the code, which is a mental defect.
[48:18.120 --> 48:24.120]  No, no, no, that's what they do now is they take any comment about the hammer's coming down.
[48:24.120 --> 48:27.120]  I'm going to get some firearms and they spin that that you're going to kill yourself.
[48:27.120 --> 48:30.120]  This is this new mental illness thing.
[48:30.120 --> 48:35.120]  They had a Marine who said some similar things and they came and put him in a mental institution.
[48:35.120 --> 48:37.120]  So what happened to you?
[48:37.120 --> 48:38.120]  Okay.
[48:38.120 --> 48:39.120]  So this is what happened, Alex.
[48:39.120 --> 48:44.120]  I was in a CMC hospital in Scranton for 20 hours.
[48:44.120 --> 48:48.120]  They marched in, you know, the social worker, the psychologist.
[48:48.120 --> 48:52.120]  The first thing that the psychologist asked me, are you ready for this?
[48:52.120 --> 48:54.120]  Are you going to?
[48:54.120 --> 48:56.120]  Do you intend to hurt the president?
[48:56.120 --> 48:58.120]  Number one, I said, absolutely not, sir.
[48:58.120 --> 49:00.120]  I'm a Christian.
[49:00.120 --> 49:01.120]  Okay.
[49:01.120 --> 49:05.120]  Number two, do you intend on making bombs and blowing people up?
[49:05.120 --> 49:07.120]  I said, absolutely not, sir.
[49:07.120 --> 49:08.120]  I'm a Christian.
[49:08.120 --> 49:10.120]  He said very good because he was an Indian.
[49:10.120 --> 49:11.120]  Very good.
[49:11.120 --> 49:12.120]  You look like religious men.
[49:12.120 --> 49:13.120]  I said, thank you, sir.
[49:13.120 --> 49:18.120]  So I was in there 20 hours and Alex, they weren't going to let me go unless I, number
[49:18.120 --> 49:20.120]  one, agreed to get rid of my firearms.
[49:20.120 --> 49:23.120]  Number two, I agreed to go to counseling.
[49:23.120 --> 49:29.120]  And number three, that I immediately call somebody to prove that I have a support system.
[49:29.120 --> 49:35.120]  Yeah, what they do is they extrajudicially off of your free speech, induct you in there,
[49:35.120 --> 49:40.120]  you act friendly, then they get you to waive all your rights and agree that you have mental
[49:40.120 --> 49:47.120]  problems to then go pay to have quack drug pushing psychiatrist claim that you have mental
[49:47.120 --> 49:51.120]  illnesses all because you said the hammers coming down.
[49:51.120 --> 49:53.120]  You're saying on a radio show, you said this?
[49:53.120 --> 49:54.120]  Yes.
[49:54.120 --> 49:55.120]  Yes.
[49:55.120 --> 49:56.120]  This is a first amendment issue.
[49:56.120 --> 49:57.120]  Secret police.
[49:57.120 --> 50:00.120]  This is Soviet style have grabbed you.
[50:00.120 --> 50:05.120]  Now you're saying, I'm going to need to get Hagman on anyways, about a bunch of other issues.
[50:05.120 --> 50:09.120]  But it's the four story down you're saying.
[50:09.120 --> 50:13.120]  Christians and gun owners in the crosshairs chilling tech exposed.
[50:13.120 --> 50:14.120]  I want to guys print that for me.
[50:14.120 --> 50:18.120]  I want to post that at info wars.com right now so everybody can find it easily.
[50:18.120 --> 50:21.120]  And I was already like yesterday going to tell dude to get Hagman on.
[50:21.120 --> 50:23.120]  So let's get Hagman on today.
[50:23.120 --> 50:24.120]  The nightly news.
[50:24.120 --> 50:29.120]  I'm also going to interview Jacarie Jackson, our new incredible reporter who's now moved
[50:29.120 --> 50:30.120]  here officially.
[50:30.120 --> 50:34.120]  And so his Dan Badani doing amazing job helping produce the radio show and run stuff there
[50:34.120 --> 50:35.120]  and as a reporter.
[50:35.120 --> 50:37.120]  I'm going to review Dan Badani tomorrow.
[50:37.120 --> 50:39.120]  I tell you what sir.
[50:39.120 --> 50:40.120]  We're going to look at your story.
[50:40.120 --> 50:43.120]  Give us your name and number right now off air.
[50:43.120 --> 50:45.120]  And we need to talk about this.
[50:45.120 --> 50:46.120]  Wow.
[50:46.120 --> 50:47.120]  You know what?
[50:47.120 --> 50:50.120]  I said I get to all these other collars.
[50:50.120 --> 50:51.120]  You know what?
[50:51.120 --> 50:52.120]  Stay there.
[50:52.120 --> 50:53.120]  I want to hear the rest of the story.
[50:53.120 --> 50:55.120]  And then we'll go to everybody else.
[50:55.120 --> 51:03.120]  But a radio talk show host arrested for saying wow.
[51:03.120 --> 51:07.120]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid and generate your
[51:07.120 --> 51:09.120]  own supply of electrical power.
[51:09.120 --> 51:13.120]  Folks with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid
[51:13.120 --> 51:14.120]  and just how vulnerable it is.
[51:14.120 --> 51:16.120]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[51:16.120 --> 51:21.120]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms
[51:21.120 --> 51:24.120]  and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[51:24.120 --> 51:28.120]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.

[53:07.120 --> 53:11.120]  Herbal remedies are much safer and much cheaper than prescription drugs.
[53:11.120 --> 53:15.120]  Tastes great, and most importantly, herbal teas are effective and non-addictive.
[53:15.120 --> 53:19.120]  Renovation tea is especially unique, and here's why.
[53:19.120 --> 53:22.120]  We spent years researching herbs and their beneficial properties.

[53:55.120 --> 53:59.120]  Renovation teas renovate your health one bag at a time.
[54:11.120 --> 54:16.120]  All over the world, schoolchildren are hand-scanning and face-scanning
[54:16.120 --> 54:22.120]  to buy and sell, to be able to get cafeteria food or to check out books.
[54:22.120 --> 54:26.120]  And when parents say they think it's the mark of the beast and don't like it,
[54:26.120 --> 54:28.120]  they're called conspiracy theorists.
[54:28.120 --> 54:32.120]  See, if you don't like TSA grabbing your genitals, they call you conspiracy theorists.
[54:32.120 --> 54:36.120]  It's like, if you say you don't like strawberry milkshakes, you like chocolate ones.
[54:36.120 --> 54:40.120]  Having an opinion is now a conspiracy theory.
[54:40.120 --> 54:42.120]  Like, hey, I don't think we should have checkpoints on the highways.
[54:42.120 --> 54:49.120]  Whatever conspiracy theorist, meanwhile, world government is being thrown openly in our face.
[54:49.120 --> 54:54.120]  Now, by the way, I've scanned over this article now, and we're going to get Mr. Hagman on.
[54:54.120 --> 55:00.120]  I'm posting this article at infowars.com, and linking over to it.
[55:00.120 --> 55:02.120]  It's also in Canadian free press.
[55:02.120 --> 55:06.120]  Christianity and gun owners in the crosshairs, chilling tactic exposed.
[55:06.120 --> 55:11.120]  That's a great headline, but I'm changing it to thought police kidnap talk show hosts.
[55:11.120 --> 55:15.120]  If cops are banging on my door, I'd say, what's the emergency?
[55:15.120 --> 55:18.120]  And they say, we need you to come out here and talk to us.
[55:18.120 --> 55:22.120]  I would then say to them, well, what's it about?
[55:22.120 --> 55:29.120]  And they said, well, it's about your comments on your talk show about guns and the hammers coming down.
[55:29.120 --> 55:34.120]  Well, yeah, I clearly was saying this country's collapsing, and we all need to get guns to protect ourselves.
[55:34.120 --> 55:37.120]  That's in national surveys, number one reason to buy guns.
[55:37.120 --> 55:42.120]  Let me call the local talk radio right now, and I also call 911.
[55:42.120 --> 55:45.120]  And yeah, they might try to have a big standoff and a big event.
[55:45.120 --> 55:46.120]  At least the police will be there.
[55:46.120 --> 55:47.120]  There'll be news.
[55:47.120 --> 55:50.120]  You can come out and say, hey, charge me with a crime.
[55:50.120 --> 55:54.120]  Instead, they take you to an extrajudicial situation.
[55:54.120 --> 56:03.120]  And then now they're trying to induct you into agreeing to go to their classes and sign agreements saying you're mentally ill and give up your guns.
[56:03.120 --> 56:20.120]  And yes, I think everyone should buy guns because all over the country, I mean, I saw a story two years ago where Oakland, California, their crime rate has exploded since then, said we're not going to respond to 30 crimes, including robbery.
[56:20.120 --> 56:21.120]  You name it.
[56:21.120 --> 56:26.120]  All over the country, I see them lay off 20, 30, 40, 50, 60% of the cops.
[56:26.120 --> 56:28.120]  Some areas are getting rid of all of them.
[56:28.120 --> 56:34.120]  And yeah, we need guns to protect ourselves for deteriorating society.
[56:34.120 --> 56:38.120]  And the hammer, it looks like, could be brought down against the American people.
[56:38.120 --> 56:43.120]  My gosh, we've got Army manuals that are public where they say they're going to arrest us for our speech.
[56:43.120 --> 56:45.120]  And they're trying everywhere.
[56:45.120 --> 56:51.120]  I mean, I've talked to so much family and friends where people at a cookout will say, I hate Obama.
[56:51.120 --> 56:53.120]  They ought to throw him out of this country.
[56:53.120 --> 56:56.120]  Boom, secret service next day in their face.
[56:56.120 --> 56:57.120]  We want your guns.
[56:57.120 --> 56:58.120]  You know what?
[56:58.120 --> 56:59.120]  Secret service comes around here.
[56:59.120 --> 57:01.120]  I'm like, look, you're the guys that helped kill Kennedy.
[57:01.120 --> 57:02.120]  Just get out of my office.
[57:02.120 --> 57:03.120]  And I do.
[57:03.120 --> 57:04.120]  I tell them that.
[57:04.120 --> 57:05.120]  I'm not going to.
[57:05.120 --> 57:12.120]  Look, the ADLs out here saying that I'm and others that I'm going to promote violence or cause violence.
[57:12.120 --> 57:15.120]  Not offensive violence, but I will defend myself.
[57:15.120 --> 57:17.120]  They want to start a civil war.
[57:17.120 --> 57:19.120]  They can't win politically.
[57:19.120 --> 57:21.120]  Our ideas are winning.
[57:21.120 --> 57:22.120]  They're panicking.
[57:22.120 --> 57:30.120]  Sir, do you agree that you were basically coerced with a guy, you know, with a gun, basically kidnapped into going down there with them?
[57:30.120 --> 57:31.120]  Yeah, Alex.
[57:31.120 --> 57:34.120]  I mean, that's that's pretty much the best way to put it.
[57:34.120 --> 57:39.120]  I mean, I the way I thought was this, Alex, you know, I told folks your name.
[57:39.120 --> 57:42.120]  You'll tell people your name and you're in your talk show on heaven.
[57:42.120 --> 57:44.120]  Well, I appreciate that opportunity.
[57:44.120 --> 57:45.120]  Yeah.
[57:45.120 --> 57:46.120]  And I was going to mention the website.
[57:46.120 --> 57:47.120]  Just go.
[57:47.120 --> 57:50.120]  The website is revelationnews.net.
[57:50.120 --> 57:51.120]  That's my website.
[57:51.120 --> 57:52.120]  Oh, I've seen your site.
[57:52.120 --> 57:54.120]  Yeah, you've got a popular talk show.
[57:54.120 --> 57:56.120]  So so now they could come here.
[57:56.120 --> 57:59.120]  I've said, hey, they're getting ready to drop the hammer on us.
[57:59.120 --> 58:01.120]  We need guns to protect ourselves.
[58:01.120 --> 58:03.120]  I mean, are they going to come here?
[58:03.120 --> 58:04.120]  Are they going to?
[58:04.120 --> 58:08.120]  This is a group that ships guns to Mexico to blame the Second Amendment.
[58:08.120 --> 58:10.120]  I'm so sick of it.
[58:10.120 --> 58:11.120]  Wow.
[58:11.120 --> 58:12.120]  Again, tell people your name.
[58:12.120 --> 58:19.120]  My name is Jason E. Roth, but I just want everybody to listen to the August 7th broadcast.
[58:19.120 --> 58:20.120]  Okay.
[58:20.120 --> 58:24.120]  The last one on the black talk radio widget at the bottom.
[58:24.120 --> 58:27.120]  You tell me, Alex, if I said anything that warranted this.
[58:27.120 --> 58:28.120]  All right, brother.
[58:28.120 --> 58:32.120]  Well, listen, listen, you need to sue them for violating your civil rights, trying to
[58:32.120 --> 58:36.120]  coercion out of your second amendment, especially if you don't have a criminal record.
[58:36.120 --> 58:37.120]  Okay.
[58:37.120 --> 58:38.120]  This is the site police.
[58:38.120 --> 58:44.120]  This is the thought police.
[58:44.120 --> 58:49.120]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:49.120 --> 58:50.120]  Thank you.
[59:19.120 --> 59:21.120]  Thank you.
[59:49.120 --> 59:51.120]  533139.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:29.120]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:35.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into the next hour of global transmission.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.120]  Unbelievable news up at infowars.com.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.120]  We mentioned some of it in the next segment.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.120]  Let's continue with your calls.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.120]  Very chilling call.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:46.120]  We just had a moment ago, a talk show host that said they're getting ready to drop the
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.120]  hammer on this country.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.120]  I need to buy some more guns.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.120]  And they came and didn't arrest him.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.120]  Come outside, get in the car.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.120]  You're going to commit suicide.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.120]  No, I'm not insane about that.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:05.120]  Well, we'll let you out of the mental institution, but you got to give us your guns.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.120]  But again, if he had just sat there, court hearing would have come up.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.120]  He'd have gone before the judge and said, this is crazy.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.120]  I have no psychiatric history, no criminal record.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.120]  I have a radio show.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.120]  I was making a point about society crumbling.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.120]  Here's a national survey where people say they're buying guns because of worried about
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.120]  collapse.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.120]  That's what I was talking about, your honor.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.120]  Here's my wife and children.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.120]  And I'm going to file a complaint on these people after this is done.
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.120]  You'd have been out.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:34.120]  But they use your ignorance of the system to shanghai your butt.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:39.120]  The TSA is running around outside the law now doing whatever they want on the highways.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:44.120]  The psychologists are all these two-bit nobodies that couldn't get a job cleaning toilets are
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.120]  now going to be psychiatrists and psychologists.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:50.120]  The new priest class trying to drug the daylights out of us while their wind-up toy mind control
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.120]  shooters go absolutely ape.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:57.120]  By the way, later remind me guys to review the born, the new born movie.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:02.120]  I went and saw last night with the crew, unbelievably good, unbelievably accurate.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:07.120]  I mean, they are really telling you, I mean, that's right down to the actual drugs they
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.120]  really use.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:11.120]  I mean, I am just blown away right now.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.120]  They use viruses to reprogram the brain.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.120]  How many years?
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.120]  About a decade I've been telling you about that.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:20.120]  But Dondi, how long have I talked about the viruses?
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.120]  Ten years, yeah.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.120]  But because that's in the medical literature.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:31.120]  That movie's real.
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.120]  That's all I can say.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.120]  There's my review right there.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mary in Wisconsin.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.120]  You're on the air.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.120]  Go ahead.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.120]  Hello, Alex.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:47.120]  I had some information that I think should be passed on.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:55.120]  About five years ago, as a matter of fact, it's two months short of five years ago, I
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:01.120]  filed a provisional patent for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.120]  It was a very, very simple chemical that I used.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:09.120]  As a matter of fact, you can buy it at the drugstore.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:15.120]  And I, because there was controversy about this, I said, hmm, this is interesting.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:21.120]  So I took this chemical, I took it outside, and I mixed it with some water, I took it
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:27.120]  outside, and I sprayed it into the atmosphere and I was shocked at what I experienced.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:33.120]  Subsequent to that, I filed the provisional patent and it was used.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.120]  It was a very simple chemical that grabs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:43.120]  And this is information I want to pass on to people.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:48.120]  And I hesitate to say what the chemical is on the air, but I certainly would be willing
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:57.120]  to pass the copy of the provisional patent on to you with the proof of what I am saying
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.120]  is correct.
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.120]  Yeah, well, mail me a letter.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.120]  I'm Alex Jones or send us an email, show tips, and I'd like to look into that.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:10.120]  There's all sorts of weather modification, patents and provisional patent pending type
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.120]  things, and most inventions do get made in the garage.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:17.120]  So I'd like to see your information on that, Mary.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.120]  I just don't know where to send it.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.120]  That's the problem.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.120]  You can send it to P.O.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:31.120]  Box, P.O. Box, 1-9-5-4-9, Austin, Texas, 787-60.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:35.120]  P.O. Box, 1-9-5-4-9, Austin, Texas, 787-60.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.120]  And thank you so much for listening.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.120]  I look forward to seeing that.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.120]  All right, we got a guest coming up.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.120]  What will Obama do if reelected?
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:47.120]  And I like the book because it will tell us what Mitt Romney will do if elected.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.120]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.120]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.120]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.120]  GCNLive.com is their website.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.120]  A lot of key news there as well.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120]  Stay with us.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:26.120]  We'll be back.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:53.120]  We'll be right back.

[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:34.120]  Your host here Monday through Friday from 12 noon to 3 p.m. eastern.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:38.120]  We'll be talking with the author of Fool Me Twice, Obama's Shocking Plans for the next
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:41.120]  four years exposed here in just a moment.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:50.120]  First off, some of the headlines up at prisonplanet.com and infowarch.com just out.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:56.120]  Print 2.0, the answer to the Internet kill switch.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.120]  And it goes on.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.120]  Fed, court rules, banksters can steal pensions.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:09.120]  Cops interrogate family for allowing kids to play outside.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.120]  Pre-crime cameras for RNC in Tampa.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.120]  Jacob Rothschild, Paul Paulson, John Paulson.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:21.120]  George Soros are all beating the financial disaster is coming.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.120]  They're all betting on it.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:28.120]  John Paulson and George Soros are all betting that financial disaster is coming.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.120]  Continuing.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:35.120]  Former Marine indefinitely detained in psychiatric ward over 9-11 Facebook post.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:47.120]  That is all up at infowarch.com and prisonplanet.com right now.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:54.120]  But now I want to bring up Aaron Klein to go over his excellent book that I finished reading last week, Fool Me Twice.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:10:02.120]  We also sell it at the infowarch online video bookstore at infowarchop.com or infowarchstore.com will also get you there.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:13.120]  And this goes over with his co-authors from their statements, from their think tanks, from their operatives, what they're planning if he gets elected.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.120]  Now, I want to be clear, I'm not endorsing Romney either here.
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.120]  He's bought and paid for by the same people.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:24.120]  But Obama is so over the top that he's just unusually dangerous.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:33.120]  With the government run healthcare, the shutting down power plants without congressional approval, they're giving billions to his buddies in no bid contracts and energy deals.
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.120]  I mean, it is the Chicago mafia on steroids running our country.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:39.120]  And they've done some amazing research.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:51.120]  Aaron Klein is a New York Times bestselling author, journalist, and radio host. He's a senior reporter for WorldNet Daily and host Aaron Klein investigative radio on New York's WABC, the nation's largest talk station.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:59.120]  Klein's program is one of only two weekend shows in the U.S. to make the heavy hitter hundred for the top of American radio shows for Talkers Magazine.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:07.120]  His previous books include Red Army, The Manchurian President, The Late Great, State of Israel, and Schmoozing with Terrorist.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:11.120]  And Aaron Klein joins us right now from their research to break down.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.120]  That's why I like the book. It goes from what they're saying they're going to do.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:18.120]  But this isn't getting enough. I mean, it's the bestseller already, but it's not getting the attention it should.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:23.120]  Really scary what Obama will do because then he isn't facing reelection.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.120]  He can basically do anything and have pardons.
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:29.120]  That's why it's so scary if you're a new listener. I know most of you know that.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.120]  So Aaron, good to have you on with us, sir.
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.120]  Thanks for having me.
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.120]  By the way, I also don't endorse Romney. I'm not a Republican or a Democrat. I'm an Independent.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:45.120]  I actually think that Romney is probably going to be a slow-motion version of Obama.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:55.120]  But as you said, these plans really lay out very clearly that if Obama gets another four years, we will not recognize the country.
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:12:02.120]  I agree with you because then he, again, isn't facing reelection, has the pardon power. Run through it.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:06.120]  Why you decided to write the book basically, you know, break down for us.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:09.120]  Obviously, the book covers it in more detail, but what the plans really are.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:16.120]  I mean, this is a newsmaking interview here. A lot of people, I don't think, realize if you think Obama's been bad, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:26.120]  Yeah, the flexibility that Obama promises to the Russian president on, let's say, missile defense in Europe, that obviously begs the question.
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:34.120]  If he's hiding policies from the American electorate on foreign policy, what is he hiding when it comes to domestic policy?
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:48.120]  So I personally was prompted to write the book because I saw how in 2008 Obama ran on such a general platform on hope, on change, on fundamentally transforming the U.S.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:53.120]  Of course, actually not a single reporter, as far as I know, bothered to ask him directly,
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:58.120]  what do you mean, Obama, by fundamentally transforming the U.S.? What do you want to transform it into?
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:07.120]  Well, he's trying to do the same thing now, and that is run on a general platform of, well, prominently, of something called economic fairness.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:12.120]  He constantly talks about fair share. They're rich today. They're fair share.
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.120]  What does that mean? Why doesn't anybody bother to ask him what it means?
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:26.120]  So what I have done is I've gone through, there are certain key progressive organizations that were behind Obama's first-term agenda.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:34.120]  And actually, in a very specific way, I mean, to the point where some of these groups, like the Center for American Progress, like Demos,
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.120]  like the Institute for Policy Studies, like the Economic Policy Institute,
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:45.120]  these groups crafted parts of what actually became the text of the stimulus bill,
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:50.120]  what actually became some of the text of the health care bill in Obama's first term.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.120]  So what I've done is go through thousands, with my co-author, Brenda J. Elliott,
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:14:01.120]  thousands upon thousands of documents for what these same progressive groups and activists who are behind in a very real way,
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:08.120]  Obama's first-term agenda, what they're planning for his second term, recommendations for his second term,
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:15.120]  on all fronts, on jobs, on the economy, on exactly, by the way, what he means by economic fairness,
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:21.120]  on immigration overhaul, which will translate into executive amnesty for millions of illegals,
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:26.120]  on health care, which might begin with Obama care, but that's just the start.
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:32.120]  We're talking about nudging toward a single-payer system, on national energy policy, on pentagon plans,
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:38.120]  on, by the way, using the pentagon for globalist agenda, and so much more.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:41.120]  Continue, continue.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.120]  Yeah.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:49.120]  About economic fairness, because, again, Obama really has been driving that term home.
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:57.120]  In fact, he gave a speech in 2012, January 2012, instead of the union,
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:02.120]  where he used economic fairness, that phrase, something like five or six times.
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:07.120]  Well, economic fairness, first of all, before we even get to what he's planning specifically,
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:11.120]  comes directly from Marxist doctrine.
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.120]  It comes right out of the Marxist playbook.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:18.120]  I can trace it back to ideologues who want to basically spread America as well.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:24.120]  But what I've gone through here is the progressive gang, again, behind Obama's first term,
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.120]  and they have specific plans for economic fairness.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.120]  Let's go over them and see how fair they sound to you.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:37.120]  For example, paycheck fairness, where the US government, the federal government, can come
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:47.120]  and determine what would be the fair pay for an individual job in the private sector.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:52.120]  So that's a bit of government centralization and control over there.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:58.120]  Or welfare fairness, or actually specifically it's called living wage fairness,
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:05.120]  where the government swoops in and raises the minimum wage to meet with some of the basic needs of individuals,
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:10.120]  such as housing, food, utilities, transportation, healthcare, recreation.
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:13.120]  So you might actually think, wow, that sounds really good.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.120]  The government's going to come in and raise the bar on my paycheck.
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.120]  That's amazing.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:22.120]  The problem is that this has actually been tried in the past.
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:30.120]  In fact, in over 80 cities from the 1990s until 2003, and by the way, it was pushed by Acorn in the past,
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.120]  and it failed.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.120]  It failed miserably.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:37.120]  It actually caused local economies in different cities to crash and burn.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:41.120]  So again, this is just the beginning of economic fairness.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:52.120]  Also, by the way, not fair economic fairness to bring more unions into private industry,
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:59.120]  to nudge the unions into the industries, for example, with tax incentives and other things.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:03.120]  And so now we can get a better picture of the kind of economic fairness,
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:09.120]  including by the way, forcing companies to pay sick leave for 12 weeks,
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:14.120]  even if somebody is taking care of somebody else in the family who is sick.
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:16.120]  And again, actually, that sounds really good.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:17.120]  Obama is up for the worker.
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:18.120]  That's what it sounds like.
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:21.120]  The problem is who's going to pay for all of this.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:26.120]  And actually, when you look at all of the plans that I outlined in Fool Me Twice,
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:34.120]  and economic fairness is just the start, the theme here certainly is nudging closer toward a welfare state.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:40.120]  To a state where the government is involved in pretty much every aspect of our lives,
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:45.120]  literally from cradle to grave.
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:50.120]  Well, I agree with you and I don't think people realize just how big a threat we're facing
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:54.120]  and that they're already shutting down one-third of the power plants.
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.120]  They've shut down about a third of that third.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.120]  Power outages, giant power increases.
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:04.120]  Our mayor said for the earth, they've shut down two of our power plants.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.120]  The third is now being shut down and they say,
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:10.120]  if you don't like your power prices doubling, get ready, it's going to double over that.
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:14.120]  And it's just a pretext to take over.
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.120]  This is a foreign army with bombers.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.120]  Couldn't do this much damage to our country.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:23.120]  Well, you know, actually, it's interesting that you talk about the power plants shutting down.
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:29.120]  We also have battery companies, the day after Obama boasted about it, for example,
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.120]  instead of the union, a kind of green battery company,
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.120]  and then one of the battery companies from Obama's stimulus went bankrupt.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:43.120]  Here we are, a mass corruption from Obama's first term stimulus, 2009 green stimulus.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:48.120]  To the point where we're actually in the book, pull me twice, I have even more corruption,
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:53.120]  including top Obama administration officials tied to companies
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.120]  that received hundreds of millions of dollars in stimulus funding.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.120]  But again, forget about that.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:03.120]  Look at just the miserable failure economically of these green companies going bankrupt.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:10.120]  Well, actually, in Obama's second term, there are plans for a new green stimulus.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:14.120]  There are also plans for a national independent energy trust,
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:20.120]  which would be basically a federal green bank, plus actually greening the military.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:27.120]  So we see a theme here of a massive government jobs works program, by the way, also coming,
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:32.120]  but then a theme of using so-called global warming,
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:37.120]  the so-called theory of global warming as if it wasn't highly in question
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:43.120]  after the late emails of 2009 to advocate for more green stimulus,
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:50.120]  but again, to advocate for using the military to actually, in some of these progressive plans,
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:54.120]  this is how loony it goes, to fight global warming.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:57.120]  In fact, I saw different progressive groups.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:00.120]  Well, take a look, stay there, tell us about that on the other side.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:24.120]  That's a total power grab.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:38.120]  I recently increased my supply for MeFoodsDirect because we have all known this was coming.

[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:49.120]  they're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.

[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:05.120]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have dead bolts.
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:09.120]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about five minutes.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:15.120]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV jewelry and my guns.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:18.120]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:25.120]  The police officers said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door and that dead bolts alone don't stop intruders.
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:31.120]  The officer told me to go to ezarmor.com if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder.

[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:08.120]  We'll talk more about that here in about 10 minutes or so.
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:16.120]  Aaron Klein, again, WorldNet Daily, mailed me probably 20 different books they've published or big publishers for folks that don't know.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:21.120]  And I scanned over a bunch and read about three of them to decide which ones I wanted to carry.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:24.120]  And yours is one of the ones I decided to carry at infowars.com.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:29.120]  Because you guys have done the research and all I do is study these people.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.120]  And I learned some stuff here.
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:44.120]  But you've got how they all operate, the adjit props for the cameras, the Alinsky method, the way they plan to take over society and make us dependent on them.
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.120]  I mean, there's so much in here.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:53.120]  And it's hard to really understand how criminal these people are.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.120]  You break down the fact that they're gearing up to hack the 2012 elections.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:59.120]  We have reported on that.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:03.120]  But you were getting into the radical fake environmental power grab agenda.
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:10.120]  And then let's get into some of the other areas in the book because it is just a giant smorgasbord of information.
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:16.120]  A lot of people are asking me what's the most shocking plan that I've found for Obama's second term.
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:19.120]  And actually the answer is it's not one shocking plan.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:28.120]  It's a series of small shocks so that by the end of, let's say, another four years, it's incremental changes.
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:33.120]  It's like the frog that's boiling slowly in the hot water.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:36.120]  It doesn't realize that it's boiling until it's too late.
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:38.120]  You talk about power grab.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:41.120]  That's what it is domestically.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:46.120]  There's no question that this is government spending out of control.
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:49.120]  But more than that, it's government involvement in our lives.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:56.120]  But then there's also the international aspect of this, of Obama's plans for the military.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:27:00.120]  We're on the one hand, we're talking about massive scalebacks to the military.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:10.120]  But then on the other, aligning the military closer and closer to the United Nations to peacekeeping forces worldwide.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:17.120]  Oh yeah, we've had Obama, as you know, in letters, but also the Joint Chiefs in Congress say that NATO and the UN are now over the military.
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:18.120]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:23.120]  Yeah, we had Canada tell Congress we will inform you if we decide to go.
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:33.120]  But actually, it's interesting that you mentioned that because one key aspect of the military chapter in full means twice is the use of something I'm sure you're familiar with.
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:43.120]  It's called responsibility to protect, which is the doctrine that Obama employed to violate Libya's nation border.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:47.120]  Go in and remove Gaddafi and then put in who knows who.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:58.120]  That was my next point. Now they admit the main forces al-Qaeda also in Syria, and that's what he's twisted the protect clause into.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:04.120]  That's my next question. Why do you think the president is openly aligning with al-Qaeda and jihadis?
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:20.120]  I don't think that he is openly. What he's doing here is very interesting, actually, is that I believe that he sees the Muslim Brotherhood as somebody that the United States, but that also internationally and globally,
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:31.120]  the global community can do business with and actually that it would nudge closer to what seems to be the goal of the responsibility to protect authors.
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:39.120]  And I've actually personally gone through the literature of responsibility to protect who crafted it, how it was crafted.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:51.120]  George Soros is all over it and was also authored by two individuals who write time and again how their goal, they actually write this and nobody bothers to look into this.
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:29:09.120]  Talking about Gareth Evans and Georgians, of course, they talk about how their ultimate goal is to violate nation-state borders and to ensure a one-world order, global rebalancing, international redistribution.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:13.120]  That's their word, the words of the founders of responsibility to protect.
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:21.120]  Now, if you take out your map and I'm extremely familiar with the Middle East, I have been reporting from there for seven years.
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:36.120]  It's one big mess of a clan in Syria, a clan in Saudi Arabia, a clan in Jordan. What unites the whole Middle East if you want to unite them under a nudge enclosure to some sort of one-world concept?
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:49.120]  Well, that happens to be the Muslim Brotherhood. They're in every country and if they take over, we're not talking about Egypt being a sovereign nation because Egypt's going to merge with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:51.120]  Stay there, stay there. Let's get into this.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:30:06.120]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:28.120]  Joel Gilbert, available at infowars.com. This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:32.120]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:36.120]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.

[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:43.120]  None dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:57.120]  We're also carrying behind the green mask, U.N. Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey. This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover. The greater good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:13.120]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:37.120]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%. Easy to set up and use. Doesn't require electricity. Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:44.120]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key. Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:58.120]  Propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there. It's what my family uses. Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Propure, but if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at infowars.com.

[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:15.120]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the Blackouts, get off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power. Folks with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:25.120]  That's in the mainstream news every day. Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:33.120]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for Blackouts, and if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:43.120]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling power hub unit. In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:53.120]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings. Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar powered. That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:33:01.120]  Info Wars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com. That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:33.120]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:39.120]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:53.120]  A New World Order.
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:34:07.120]  Aaron Kline is our guest for the rest of this segment. In a little short segment at the end of the hour, I'm going to read some excerpts of the new article where we're announcing and giving details about the new publication, Info Wars Magazine,
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:23.120]  free to everybody that purchases stuff at InfoWarshop.com. You can also buy them in bulk. In the next few days, we're going to watch a subscription if you just want to get one every month or more copies. But right now, you can buy them in bulk at cost.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:38.120]  The key weapon in the Info War, it's available right now. We can show people the article too if they're watching at PrismPlanet.tv. Print 2.0, answer to the Internet kill switch, going back to the roots of freedom of speech.
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:54.120]  Our answer to the Internet kill switch, Alex Jones. And you can also link through there in the first paragraph. You can just sign up for the Info Wars Insider, our daily news articles, videos, special reports, links to the podcast that we send to people
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:35:09.120]  if they sign up for the free newsletter. Well, tomorrow I will send, in the morning blast, email blast, we will send you a link to the high quality PDF that you can just turn like a regular page.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:27.120]  It's just like reading a regular newspaper or magazine, but it's digital for your iPhone or iPad or droid or for your regular computer. If you sign up at InfoWars Insider, a lot of exclusive articles in there by Gerald Salente, you name it, a very, very powerful issue, first issue.
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:41.120]  And it's got the Federal Reserve on fire on the front. And we're saying, Rome burned, will we? Because Europe is burning in many areas in riots. And the Federal Reserve is burning down our currency and our sovereignty.
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:53.120]  So I ask the question, will major cities like D.C. and other places down the road burn in riots? I hope that's not the case. We're trying to avert some type of civil war in this country.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:36:03.120]  And that's my next question for Aaron Klein, bestselling author, New York Times bestselling author, Fool Me Twice, the new book that's out breaking down Obama's shocking plans for the next four years exposed.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:14.120]  You were getting into their plan to use the Muslim Brotherhood worldwide, which is probably one of the biggest, most cohesive groups in the world. Christianity is broken into a million pieces.
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:30.120]  And the seminaries have all been infiltrated by communists and globalists. So it's pretty much fractured Christendom. They're secular humanists, hate Christianity, but they love Jihad for whatever reason.
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:50.120]  And so now we see the clash of civilizations. Actually, the Neocons talked about, they said, a war between the West and the East. But if you look at it, it's a manufactured conflict where you put the radicals in and then I guess see that as the unifying force worldwide and then play the clash of civilizations.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:37:00.120]  Or are you saying that the Obamanoid types would actually really want to bring in some type of radical Muslim caliphate worldwide?
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:10.120]  You know, I don't know whether they even care about a Muslim caliphate worldwide as much as they care about uniting, let's say, the Middle East under one sort of common banner.
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:27.120]  And it happens to be that the only common banner really is a Muslim brotherhood. You know, it's amazing you mentioned Europe burning. And right now, Obama, if he gets another four years, will implement some of what caused Europe's entire economy to crash and burn.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:37.120]  He doesn't want us to know his plans. And so I'm trying to outline them in a very specific way in the book. But also, by the way, look at Syria right now because it's a perfect example.
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:48.120]  Hillary Clinton, last week, according to reports, talked with Turkey, which borders Syria. Turkey and Syria are enemies.
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:38:02.120]  Turkey wants to get rid of Bashar Assad's regime. Hillary talked with the Turkish leader about possibly implementing a no-fly zone in Syria, which would be under the banner of responsibility to protect.
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:13.120]  The very doctrine that I point out and pull me twice will be some of the motivating, driving force behind the future of the U.S. military.
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:31.120]  But who is fighting on the other side? You have Bashar Assad, the president of Syria, who's been accused of so-called human rights atrocities because responsibility to protect can be used against any country that's accused of genocide, of human rights abuses, of atrocities.
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:50.120]  But actually, in the past, by the way, the United Nations has used some of those labels in places where they absolutely don't fit. But actually, the jihadists have been streaming into Syria, even Mujahideen, that we were supporting, that we were fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:53.120]  Of course, we were supporting them before that with the Soviets.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:39:03.120]  Now they're being supported and they're the main force. Even the CFR, as you know, two weeks ago, one of their riders came out and said, we need al-Qaeda. That was a quote.
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:16.120]  So the TSA, again, needs to go in my pants to make sure bin Laden isn't hiding in there. But all of a sudden, al-Qaeda-affiliated groups actually flying the al-Qaeda flag, al-Qaeda patches.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:30.120]  They're now supposedly these humanitarians and, you know, you've hit on something that's key here. That really is the UN global government model, where they fund proxy rebels to attack a country, whether that country be good or bad or indifferent.
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:42.120]  And then, oh, we've got to invade to protect the peaceful rebels that are blowing up police stations and shooting people and burning down churches in Mosque, and of Alawites and also driving out Jews.
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:52.120]  I mean, what are they going to do now in Egypt as they're driving out Christians and the few Jews that are there, or as they line up blacks and Libyan, kill them and, you know, drive out Christians?
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:40:05.120]  What are they going to do when the jihadis, as promised, go after the Shiites, the Alawites, the Christians and the Jews? I mean, they're burning up and blowing up the churches right now in Syria, and our media is calling them heroes.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:18.120]  Yeah, you know, our great Judeo-Christian country founded with the Judeo-Christian values is aiding the site that is causing Christians to flee from Egypt that is persecuting Christians right now in Syria.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:32.120]  Now, the White House claims that it's only providing non-lethal aid to the so-called rebels, and we know who the rebels are at this point, even the New York Times is admitting that it's, in part, certainly represented by al-Qaeda.
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:47.120]  But I have a lot of information that the United States has been using cutouts, like Saudi Arabia in particular, to give Saudi weapons, which actually come ultimately from the U.S., to the rebels.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:41:04.120]  And so I believe there's no question at this point, according to multiple sources that I talked to, that we are absolutely helping the rebels get, I hate using that term, I don't even want to use it, they're not rebels, helping the insurgents that are fighting Bashar Assad's regime to get weapons.
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:20.120]  So this means we are funding the other side, which we do all the time, by the way, it's not just in Syria, even in the Palestinian Authority, where we give training, actual training to the Palestinian so-called militias.
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:29.120]  Well, the problem is that these militias double as members of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, which is the terror group that attacks Israel.
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:41.120]  It's so ridiculous that I've personally interviewed, in person, for example, the senior leader of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, declared a terror group by the United States, his name's Al-Aqsa Nakhra.
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:51.120]  I met him and his gang in Nablus in the northern West Bank, and he was telling me about how he was trained as a militia member by the United States.
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:42:08.120]  Or even more ridiculous, we give weapons to them, and I found out that at least until two years ago, the guy who was on the receiving team, the chief of the receiving team in the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah that was getting the weapons, his name's Kamal Ranam, I also interviewed him.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:13.120]  He's the chief of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade terror group also in Ramallah.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:22.120]  So it's been going on for quite some time, and now the situation is getting out of hand and really ever more dangerous.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:28.120]  I agree. Let me bring up this angle with you. And again, we have a New York Times best-selling author on the line with us, Aaron Klein.
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:37.120]  He's written Fool Me Twice, available at InfoWarsHop.com, or link through at InfoWars.com, Obama's shocking plans for the next four years exposed.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:45.120]  It is so crazy to say, give up all our rights, Al Qaeda's going to get you, but then separately, openly being funding and training all these groups and affiliated groups.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:56.120]  What about the 10,000 missiles, 2,000 plus being heat seeking or radar guided, that disappeared out of Qaddafi's caches and are now being shipped all over the world by these jihadis?
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:59.120]  What's going to happen when they start blowing up airliners?
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:08.120]  Well, I guess that'll give the government the excuse to take more of my rights because they gave these people 10,000 missiles and it's admitted this is going on.
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:20.120]  I mean, what do they think is going to happen when radical jihadis are in control of Syria and our evil, prostitute media is praising it while they commit black genocide in Libya?
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:23.120]  I mean, this is wild what's happening.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:32.120]  So your comment on the missiles and then what do you think the end game is? What would Obama do in the next four years with his jihadi brigades?
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:49.120]  You know, I personally talked with Israeli security officials who have exactly that kind of information that the missiles that were in Libya and many other kinds of weapons and munitions are being sold now using Iranian and other money to the jihadis across the Middle East,
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:59.120]  including in the Sinai Peninsula where reportedly they do have anti-aircraft missiles that can down an airliner in the Sinai.
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:15.120]  No, what's even more crazy, I don't know really what is crazy here at this point, but is the billions of dollars in aid that we've given to Egypt and we were told at the beginning of the so-called Arab Spring
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:27.120]  that the Muslim Brotherhood would never take control of the presidency and would certainly never take control of the United States back, the United States armed, the United States funded Egyptian military.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:49.120]  Well, Mohammed Morsi, President Obama's good pal, the Muslim Brotherhood new Egyptian president, just fired the top brass of the Egyptian military and so now the Muslim Brotherhood in control basically for all intents and purposes of what I would say is the number two or number three most powerful military in the Middle East.
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:56.120]  And yeah, we have a massive situation of this weapons proliferation. What's going to happen in Syria? Should Assad go?
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:09.120]  So what is the grand plan? Why would the State Department, why would NATO do this? Why would they do this? I mean, what are they planning? Just to try to get a Shiite Sunni civil war going?
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:27.120]  I think that that's certainly where one of the, I actually think that is where we're headed because if you look at the situation right now in the Middle East today, Iran and its Shiite proxies, meaning Hezbollah, meaning some in Lebanon, although not all,
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:46.120]  meaning Hamas, Islamic Jihad and others, although actually Hamas and Islamic Jihad are Sunni but they're paid off by Iran. And then on the other hand, you have the Sunni superpowers of Saudi Arabia and now Egypt and we are headed toward a massive possible Middle East confrontation.
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:46:02.120]  There's no other way to read the tea leaves here. And in Obama's second term, the use of the U.S. military, you would think with all of these growing threats, although actually we're feeding these threats, certainly,
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:23.120]  and I would say we're behind some of them, that the use of the U.S. military, you think would be to combat these threats, but actually is to scale back the U.S. military with regard to funding the certain aspects, but then to use it for a more internationalist agenda.
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:41.120]  Sure, and also take over Africa with the made up county stuff and get a bunch of the diamonds and oil and the rest of it. But at the same time, that's why I don't think Obama at this time, once the Iran attack, because that would probably unify the Muslims instead of just getting them to kill each other.
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:55.120]  And I think all of it is extremely immoral, and I think it goes back to 53 and Mosaddek. If our government and the British government wouldn't have thrown him out and then double-crossed the jihadis and then put in the Shah, it just goes on and on.
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:47:12.120]  This policy of putting radical Muslims in didn't just start with Obama this last three years. It's been going on since the British did it with Saudi Arabia, and it is an evil policy, and I think it's just going to continue to sow the seeds of our destruction.
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:32.120]  Yeah, and it continued after the Shah, obviously, with the opposing the Shah, and then putting in now the radical Shiite fundamentalist regime. And this is how dangerous it is. I mean, the Shiites believe that the coming of their Imam, the Mehti, the Islamic Shiite Messiah,
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:43.120]  can only come about if there's an apocalyptic world battle of good versus evil, where the world almost comes to the brink of destruction, and then the Islamist Messiah comes back.
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:59.120]  So does NATO, does the Obama administration, does the European Union understand that they are playing with fire in the Middle East, and not just in the Middle East, of course, the ramifications around the world, even in the United States?
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:09.120]  Obviously, Iran terrorist proxies are very capable of deploying some sort of attack right here in the U.S. or in U.S.
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:14.120]  Which the government would love, which the government would love, because then they can take our rights, which is what they...
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:19.120]  That's my final question for you on this front, and then I want to get a brief take on what you think Romney would do if he gets in.
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:32.120]  I mean, as you said earlier, he would just go slower with this program. The ADL came out yesterday and, you know, said, oh, one of the guys that shot a cop, or one of the friends of somebody that shot a cop,
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:43.120]  his Facebook had a link to Alex Jones. Well, yeah, I mean, I have a website that a million people a day visit, and oh, the theater shootings are being caused by Talk Radio and Rush Limbaugh,
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:56.120]  the Southern Prairie Law Center is out there saying all this, and they're saying, yeah, we need to restrict speech because, you know, there's going to be a civil war with the right-wingers.
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:03.120]  What's your research on that, these attempts to demonize conservatives and libertarians in a second administration?
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:09.120]  We've all seen the Mayak and Homeland Security reports and others where they say the biggest threat is returning veterans.
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:19.120]  So now they're going to say Al-Qaeda is not a threat, but the returning veterans are. I mean, my point is, what do you expect the next administration of Obama gets back in on that whole front?
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:24.120]  Yeah, I mean, just even the current administration has that kind of ideology.
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:38.120]  Like Julius Jekinowski of the FCC, who comes from, and is heavily tied with something called Free Press, that is anything but Free Press, they're agitating toward more government control over the internet of the airways,
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:52.120]  and Cass Sunstein, who of course just stepped down, but before then advocated for a new deal fairness doctrine where the government would impose a panel of experts that could oversee diversity of view on the airways.
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:50:02.120]  It's like the Ministry of Information. But in Fool Me Twice, I do have specific plans that we've found, including in the Green Chapter, surprisingly,
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:14.120]  because the Progressive Camp is very nervous about the conservative and libertarian drive to point out the pseudoscience behind global warming,
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:20.120]  which is the basis for what they're trying to do in the upcoming Second Obama term with lots of the economic plans.
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:33.120]  So there is a drive, although it's not specified exactly how, but using multiple possible assaults, like this large octopus that has many tentacles, to silence talk radio,
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:42.120]  to silence, to nudge toward more government regulation, keyword regulation, of the internet of the airways.
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:50.120]  Yeah, the Ministry of Truth. You know, I'm going to plug the new magazine, and I want to read the article, but I'll have to do that at the start of the next hour.
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:51:13.120]  And then I'll get into this whole demonization report. Third hour's coming up, but stay there, Aaron Klein. I want to come back and get your take on Mitt Romney briefly.
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:28.120]  Because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity, I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts,
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:39.120]  and if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you. Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling power hub unit.
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:45.120]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make. It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:51.120]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered. That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.

[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:39.120]  The old Willie Nelson, our good friend. He's in the hospital. The last few days with breathing problems. He's almost 80.
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:50.120]  That's one of the cool things about being a radio talk show host is I've gotten to know people like Willie Nelson real well, but Charlton Heston.
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:57.120]  First of all, walking last week, we got Richard Belzer coming back on Friday to get into being censored on CNN.
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:05.120]  But right now we are talking to the bestselling author of Fool Me Twice, Aaron Klein. The book is available at infowars.com.
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:13.120]  In closing, these really are authoritarians and Bush had a lot of authoritarian stuff that I was extremely critical of as well.
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:27.120]  But I've been shocked by mainline Democrats and Democrat publications across the board just absolutely backing Obama on outrageous stuff.
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:37.120]  They could care less that Al Qaeda lined up tens of thousands of blacks and mowed them down or cut them up with machetes. They put out this war propaganda to invade Uganda.
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:49.120]  These are really a nasty group of people and it just shows their followers are purely ignorant, hype driven people who have no real liberal intentions.
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:59.120]  I could admire somebody that's anti-war and stuff. I could admire some, I mean, Thomas Jefferson I would see as a liberal. These people have nothing in common with Thomas Jefferson.
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:06.120]  And they are flaming authoritarians and I'm shocked by their criminality. I mean, it is shocking.
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:20.120]  Yeah, I personally, by the way, as a reporter, have been to different events in the Middle East, like for example, a speech in Ramallah on the 40th anniversary of Fatah, where I was sitting next to members of the world media,
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:31.120]  and I heard one thing and in fact have the transcript of the speech and then went back and saw how they all, amazingly, and I don't think they coordinated with each other at all,
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:37.120]  they selectively quoted, they changed what was said in order to meet a specific agenda.
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:47.120]  I think though that there's no question that we're at an economic emergency as a country, that we have two choices.
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:57:02.120]  So it's number one is Obama, who does not want the country to know what his specific plans are for former years. There's no question because if he did, he would give a speech that would outline what he is planning to do.
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:12.120]  He isn't. And so what I'm doing is taking the actual blueprint for his second term that if he only implements some of this, we won't recognize the country in four more years.
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:18.120]  And I'm not allowing him to get away with not telling the public what his plans are.
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:25.120]  Sure. In closing, if Romney gets in, I mean, he's bought and paid for by a lot of the same interest, but how would Romney be different?
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:36.120]  Well, you know, that's where I was going next. I haven't seen Romney spell out how he's going to cut government spending in specific ways, which government agencies he's going to cut.
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:47.120]  Every speech that I heard, and I pay attention specifically also when it comes to the Middle East, seems no different when it comes to his agenda on Syria.
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:54.120]  He talks about having to, Assad having to go and backing the rebels.
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:58:07.120]  So I don't think that he's going to come with this expansive agenda, but I think we might be looking at George Bush number two, which is basically some of Obama's policies, but in slow motion.
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:13.120]  So the question is, are we going to get on the fast train to disaster?
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:20.120]  Do you think Romney would stop having the TSA take small children behind closed doors and grub them?
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:26.120]  I haven't heard anything about that from him and so many other issues that we want to know he just has not addressed.
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:34.120]  Well, all I know is Al Qaeda is not hiding in my wife's bosom, and I want the government to stop it.
[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:51.120]  Thank you so much for joining us, Mr. Klein. The book's available at infowarshop.com. We'll talk to you again soon. Stay with us.

[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:26.120]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:41.120]  All right, we got a big news blitz coming up. I'm going to start the segment going over an article we put together announcing the new magazine officially print 2.0 to answer the Internet kill switch.
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:52.120]  Then I've got to get into the ADL again, trying to imply that I'm the hero of cop killers. Very, very dangerous to have that group doing that.
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:58.120]  Very authoritarian. We're going to be breaking that down coming up here after the break.
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:06.120]  We're going to get into Russia and China, warning the West against Syrian intervention and a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:18.120]  And I've just got to go through all this information. There's so much of it. But right now, let's go to a few callers who've been holding patiently like Josh and then we'll go to Moose and then Susan.
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:22.120]  Josh, you're on the air from Oklahoma. Go ahead.
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:32.120]  How's it going, Alex? First off, thank you for opening my eyes. My six month old has been hearing you since before he was born and he recognizes your voice whenever you come on air.
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:34.120]  Wow.
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:49.120]  Now, I have to agree with you with the crackdown on free speech. It's becoming ridiculous. I'm currently dealing with a lawsuit against my local police department for civil rights violation with a similar incident like your first or second caller.
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:02:04.120]  Police department's taken screen caps of my Facebook posts and they put me on their watch list as a suspicious person. What they're doing is they're taking training that they did for gangs where they stop you and take photos of you and all this.
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:13.120]  And they're now putting conservatives, libertarians, patriots in those. So if you don't like checkpoints they're running, if you don't like, oh, we're just going to put you on a list, buddy.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:21.120]  And so I say fight fire with fire. Just shoot video of all them, put them on YouTube, talk about them, follow them around, see how they like it.
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:30.120]  Yeah, and see, that's one of the beautiful things about Oklahoma is we're still one party state. So, you know, I have arrived as long as I'm part of the conversation to record the conversation.
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:39.120]  But they pulled my military record. They know I've been kicked out for being a conscientious objector. And, you know, they've known that I worked in ordinance.
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:43.120]  So they, that automatically makes me suspect primal.
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:52.120]  Well, that's because they're going to start a civil war. Look, the ADL, Southern Primary Law Center, federal government say the veterans will attack all police stations with improvised explosive devices.
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:03:01.120]  It is coming. Get ready for war. And then they hype it and get the police and military to treat veterans like crud starting the fight.
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:10.120]  So they'll have the civil war. I mean, and okay, cops and military, I know most of them aren't like this, but the leadership is you want to get this fight started.
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:22.120]  I happen to know how it ends with you absolutely defeated, cowering in your little fortresses and then they're going to bring in the real torture teams, the mercenaries, the foreign troops.
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:34.120]  And it's not going to be UN helmets. This is official plans. And we don't want to be enemies with you, but stop harassing real Americans that know that we were occupied by foreign banks.
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:41.120]  Stop demonizing us. Stop it. We're the ones that knew Al Qaeda worked for the globalist. Proven now.
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:46.120]  We're the ones that knew the foreign banks were setting up world government. Proven. We've been proven right.
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:52.120]  The reason we're being demonized is we know what we're talking about and we're not going to the stinking FEMA camp.
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:04:00.120]  Don't stick your hand in the bear trap. I'm trying to warn people over and over again. Why is our symbol a rattlesnake?
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:07.120]  Rattlesnakes aren't aggressive like water moccasins, folks. They don't look for trouble. They shake their tail and say, hey, don't tread on me.
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:14.120]  Hey, hey, you see this? You see that? You know what that is? That's a rattle on this end and fangs on that end.
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:20.120]  Leave me alone. You understand that? You speak English? Treat me just as good as an illegal alien.
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:26.120]  I saw some big controversy where an illegal alien was drunk driving so the cops took him to a Taco Bell.
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:32.120]  And then the guys stumbled out in traffic and got run over. Why? Because the judges say, don't bring illegal aliens in.
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:42.120]  I want to be as good as an illegal alien. In fact, just legalize all the illegals if I can just have the rights they have.
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:45.120]  Call Bing above the law. Godlike.
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:48.120]  Alright, I appreciate your call, sir. Sorry to hear about that. You know?
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:53.120]  You can either move out of the town or you can start really trying to talk to those guys.
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:05:00.120]  I would go up in their restaurants and stuff and really try to talk to them like a human. Hey, you dehumanized me. Stop doing that.
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:13.120]  I'll give them a copy of the magazine.
[02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:35.120]  Eat Foods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply.

[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:26.120]  There's no priming required. It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:29.120]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.

[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:36.120]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:39.120]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:43.120]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:47.120]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there. It's what my family uses.
[02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:53.120]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure, but if you add the promo code WATER at checkout,
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:56.120]  you get an additional 10% off at infowars.com.

[02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:04.120]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:09.120]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:16.120]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:22.120]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowars.com.
[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:26.120]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:31.120]  You've got the life straw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:36.120]  The K-Tor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:39.120]  Strategic relocation, third edition by Joel Scowsen.
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:47.120]  When disaster strikes by Matthew Stein, they're a safe use by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:50.120]  Hand crank shortwave AMFM radios.
[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:54.120]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at infowars.com
[02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:57.120]  and your purchase makes our info war possible.
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:08:10.120]  We're getting prepared. Are you infowarsshop.com?
[02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:16.120]  Alright, coming up, I'm going to respond to the ADL's latest demonization of yours truly.
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:18.120]  Alex Jones, that's me.
[02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:24.120]  We've got big news. Government documents prove domestic drones are for spying on Americans.
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:29.120]  Remember a month or so ago they ran a national hoax saying the drones were not for spying,
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:35.120]  that infowars.com was wrong, that drudgerport.com was wrong, that Matt Drudge was wrong,
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:38.120]  that I'm wrong, that oh, we're not going to spy on you.
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:45.120]  And then now the new documents are out there as if we needed Homeland Security documents to know
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:49.120]  they're already arresting people using drones. They're already weaponizing them.
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:52.120]  But a key article by Steve Watson up there.
[02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:56.120]  Also, federal court rules, banksters can steal pensions.
[02:08:56.120 --> 02:09:00.120]  We're going to be going over Curtin Emo's article and another amazing story,
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:03.120]  cops interrogate family for allowing kids to play outside.
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:05.120]  This is the new way CPS takes your kids.
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:11.120]  Everything's in danger and they just make it up, then they go into the clutches of the most dangerous people out there.
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:18.120]  That said, if you go to the front page of infowars.com, you can see the featured news stories image
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:25.120]  and it is the cover of our inaugural September issue that I wanted to put out a little bit early.
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:33.120]  We're starting out with 50,000 copies on the streets of Austin at 1,000 locations.
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:38.120]  And then everyone that orders books, videos, t-shirts, ball caps,
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:41.120]  with evil messages of freedom on them so you can meet like-minded people.
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:45.120]  Anybody that orders stuff at infowarshop.com or infowarsstore.com,
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:47.120]  both places take it the same place.
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:50.120]  There's some alternate shopping carts. We have two at infowars.com.
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:53.120]  If you click on the shopping link, we have Yahoo's store as well.
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:57.120]  But the point is, you can go there and Tim came in here during the break.
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:10:00.120]  It is explosive. People are excited about this.
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:04.120]  They are buying it en masse at cost.
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:08.120]  At cost. You can buy Tim copies for $9.95.
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:14.120]  You can buy upwards of 100 copies and the price just goes down and down and down.
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:18.120]  We factored it out at cost. We are selling these at cost.
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:26.120]  In fact, if you go to the article print 2.0, answer to the Internet kill switch,
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:32.120]  you can actually go to the bottom of the article and there is a link where you can go
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:34.120]  and see all the different prices.
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:37.120]  And that's what I'm doing right now, even though I came up with these prices last week,
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:38.120]  going from memory.
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:45.120]  You can get 10 copies for $9.95, 20 copies for $19.95.
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:51.120]  You can get $50 for $50 or $100 for $74.95.
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:54.120]  And we actually lose money on that $100 one.
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:58.120]  But I think if somebody is ordering $100, I'm happy to lose $89.
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:01.120]  But we've done all the math. This is at cost.
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:04.120]  That's why there is no free citizen rule book or bumper sticker with these.
[02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:06.120]  I can't afford it.
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:10.120]  All the other orders, of course, you get free citizen rule book, bumper stickers,
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:12.120]  and pins and stuff we throw in there.
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:15.120]  The point is, it's all available at infowarshop.com.
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:19.120]  But wait, you do not need to buy the hard copies,
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:21.120]  even though this will really get people's attention.
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:25.120]  Great way to get them to friends and family as low as $0.75 a piece.
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:27.120]  We're going to have a subscription thing up later in the week, too,
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:30.120]  where you can sign up for years to have all the issues mailed to you.
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:33.120]  We're going to have later, of course, a year later, have a back issues deal.
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:36.120]  And I plan to go weekly down the road.
[02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:43.120]  But the real plan, what's really exciting I'm going to get to here in just a moment,
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:48.120]  you can go to infowars.com or prismplanet.com
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:52.120]  and click on the article print 2.0, the answer, the internet kill switch.
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:57.120]  And when you go there, the first link is to infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:01.120]  And you just subscribe there to the free newsletter,
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:06.120]  and you get exclusive articles, videos, a news boil down every day.
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:14.120]  But we're also going to send you a free PDF, but it's put out by issues.
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:18.120]  You can flip through it, click on the links, the links work.
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:19.120]  It's amazing.
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:23.120]  We're going to send that out to everybody that signed up for the info wars insider.
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:29.120]  And again, you just go to infowars.com forward slash insider and get a free digital copy.
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:33.120]  And then I'm not asking, I'm begging, pay it forward.
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:34.120]  It's free.
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:39.120]  Send your link to everybody on your email list so they can read it as well.
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:44.120]  And tell them to subscribe for free if they want to get the free magazine.
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:49.120]  And believe me, the graphics in it, the graphics team, they did a great job.
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:54.120]  I'm surprised in the first issue, we only found a few typos and problems.
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:56.120]  And we did our customary thing.
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:58.120]  We're one printing, we're doing a second printing right now.
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:01.120]  That'll be the collector as collapse.
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:07.120]  The letters flipped in it collapses, but it's, it's, it's classic.
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:11.120]  The point is, is that I'm going to flip through this for you in a video.
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:14.120]  I'm going to shoot today all over Austin.
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:19.120]  By the way, these info wars.com little stands.
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:20.120]  What do you call it?
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:25.120]  What do you call the thing that you put the magazines in the magazine racks?
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:26.120]  Yeah, the racks.
[02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:27.120]  There you go.
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:29.120]  And a thousand locations.
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:32.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're putting the magazines at 200.
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:36.120]  I paid for the racks, which cost me quite a bit.
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:38.120]  And again, we're beta testing this.
[02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:39.120]  We're rolling it out.
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:42.120]  It, it, it paid for itself to be able to print it.
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:46.120]  It hasn't made money, but to be able to print it in the first issue.
[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:50.120]  And so we're beta testing it to be able to have people that already print local
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:54.120]  papers or people that already put out magazines to partner with us where we'll
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:57.120]  supply a lot of the content and get part of the advertising.
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:00.120]  You supply your local content and advertising.
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:05.120]  And so you have national news and local news all in one publication.
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:07.120]  So we're going to have that down the road.
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:13.120]  And that's really the big plan here is I'd like a year from now to have 20 cities.
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:16.120]  And I don't care if you're at small town or a big city.
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:20.120]  You could, because we have to have the lawyers write it up for everybody and stuff,
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:23.120]  you know, so that it's all legal and lawful and properly done.
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:24.120]  We're protected.
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:28.120]  You're protected in a code of conduct and stuff for the paper because I don't want
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:30.120]  to get sued for what somebody writes locally.
[02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:33.120]  You know, it'll be your own standalone deal and you'll be responsible for what you
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:34.120]  write in your area.
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:35.120]  But I'm getting off in the legalese.
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:40.120]  The point is that you'll have our national news with your local news as a supplement
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:44.120]  to it and then you'll get part of the advertising in your area.
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:49.120]  And then you'll have the info wars name and then you'll have print locally
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:50.120]  everywhere.
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:52.120]  That is, that is so exciting.
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:58.120]  We're already getting all sorts of printers, publishers, radio, host, radio station owners,
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:14:59.120]  TV station owners.
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:00.120]  They're getting it.
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:01.120]  This is exciting.
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:04.120]  Now, let me explain why we're going back to print.
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:10.120]  Print 2.0, the answer to the Internet kill switch, reading the letter from the publisher.
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:11.120]  That's me.
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:16.120]  If you're picking up this publication for the first time and wondering what we are
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:17.120]  all about, the answer is freedom.
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:23.120]  We stand behind the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the concept of 1776 expanding
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:24.120]  worldwide.
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:27.120]  The idea of liberty all over the planet.
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:34.120]  We are a firewall standing between liberty and the tyranny of the corporatist and monopolist
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:41.120]  system that is diabolically opposed to freedom and the free market, especially when it comes
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:45.120]  to the media and unrestricted flow of information.
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:49.120]  We oppose the wireless NSA wiretapping and the secret arrest of Americans under the
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:50.120]  NDAA.
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:54.000]  We oppose endless and criminal proxy wars carried out in our names.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:00.920]  We oppose the persecution of people for religious or cultural reasons.
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:02.520]  We are not left or right.
[02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:04.120]  We are constitutionalist.
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:08.320]  Imagine the average liberal in Austin who's not really a liberal, who's a fascist, programmed
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:11.400]  mind slave, reading something like this for the first time that's outside their little
[02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:12.600]  political correctness box.
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:21.120]  It's not about preaching to the choir, folks, it's about reaching out.
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:25.000]  Because Obama is currently the titular head of the global empire and crime syndicate,
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.800]  a lot of this publication will be about his actions.
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:29.760]  In the past, we were critical of Bush.
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:35.080]  We will also examine Romney and others who may replace Obama and his administration.
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:38.240]  Infowars.com and prisonplotter.com are flagship websites.
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:43.720]  They're rated by Alexa.com, it's actually four times, and similar metrics that gauge
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:47.800]  web traffic as a top alternative media site in the world.
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:49.920]  Infowars.com receives about twice as much traffic.
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:50.920]  We looked at that.
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:55.200]  It's four times according to Google Analytics and Alexa, so we need to change that because
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:17:01.760]  I, Kurt wrote this at a great job off of a recording I did, and so it's just, I told
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:02.760]  him check the numbers.
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:03.760]  I'm thinking you ought to read them.
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:08.880]  The point is news via print is dying as a result of a perfect storm.
[02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:13.480]  People are abandoning corporate newspapers and print publications and are instead flocking
[02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:20.400]  to the web as so-called mainstream newspapers just regard to take corporate and government
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:21.400]  talking points.
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:23.840]  Mainstream news is also dying online.
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:28.880]  This is why we are able to dominate them with film, videos, and our news websites.
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:31.880]  Yeah, print isn't really dying because of the web.
[02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:37.680]  Here it would have reduced it some, but people like print.
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:45.080]  They are, it's falling apart because people are leaving print and it's horrible propaganda.
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:48.040]  Now here's the important part I'm going to get to right now.
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:51.520]  We're going to skip this break because I've got to have time to finish this.
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:52.520]  Thank you.
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:53.520]  Network break, we're skipping it.
[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:54.880]  Station should not skip this.
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:18:00.320]  Print is impervious to a government kill switch and any other electronic scheme designed
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:04.680]  to shut down areas of the web that government wants censored.
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:08.760]  Digital and network technology make it easy for corporate control freaks to track down
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:13.440]  dissidents, delete their words, and even kill audio files of their voices as they have
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:16.560]  done with My Voice on YouTube.
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:21.040]  Operations have gone so far as to claim copyright on voices, including that of Optimus Prime,
[02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:23.600]  a character from the Transformers franchise.
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:30.080]  That's right, YouTube is now adhering to third-party claims of ownership, where now the guy that
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:34.640]  does Optimus Prime can't even speak to somebody on the street because they say the voice is
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:35.640]  owned.
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:36.640]  That's a way to erase everything.
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:37.640]  It's already happening.
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:38.640]  We warned of this years ago.
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:39.640]  Now it's happening.
[02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:40.960]  And that's their little secret plan.
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:43.680]  Once you're up in the cloud, they can shut you down.
[02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:44.680]  That's right.
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:49.040]  YouTube is now adhering to third-party claims of ownership, many of them erroneous.
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:53.640]  The people's own voices and is using, this is a pretext, delete content representing
[02:18:53.640 --> 02:19:00.480]  a new frontier of censorship via copyright.
[02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:05.440]  Automated software bots are now being used to preemptively censor content with no due
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:07.200]  process whatsoever.
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:10.680]  It's prior constraint, violates First Amendment and triplicate.
[02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:16.360]  Kendall recently demonstrated how it is possible to remove content when it invaded privately
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:21.800]  owned devices that had legally bought the books without permission or warning and deleted
[02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:26.800]  e-books, who I should have added, how they went in with Jesse Ventura, Marshall Law Show,
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:31.280]  and deleted, deleted off the Teavos.
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:33.200]  It was supposed to air 50 times.
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:34.200]  That's how they do it.
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:36.480]  It cost close to a million bucks to make an episode.
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:39.160]  I was like, cost $700,000, no, close to a million.
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:43.880]  Aired once, Homeland Security freaked out and had it erased off the Teavos and all other
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:46.160]  cable systems went in and erased it.
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:47.400]  I talked to executives.
[02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:48.400]  It was confirmed.
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:52.640]  But they sent me the orders at one time, Warner, in a major city where they said, you will
[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:53.640]  do this.
[02:19:53.640 --> 02:19:58.080]  Most cities, it was just remotely done, continuing.
[02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:02.000]  Kendall recently demonstrated how it's possible to remove content when it invaded privately
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:05.720]  owned devices without permission or warning and deleted e-books.
[02:20:05.720 --> 02:20:11.160]  As Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, if I pronounce that right, recently warned, the idea of cloud
[02:20:11.160 --> 02:20:17.240]  computing poses a threat to the existence of digital material and the idea of individual
[02:20:17.240 --> 02:20:18.240]  ownership.
[02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:21.900]  The director of the CIA has admitted that the internet is a surveillance tool that even
[02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:26.240]  gives smart appliances the ability to spy on you.
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:31.920]  This censorship war amounts to nothing less than electronic book burning, where words
[02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:34.600]  and ideas can be digitally erased from the cloud.
[02:20:34.600 --> 02:20:40.920]  The automated bots will now do the work of the firemen in Ray Bradbury's dystopian classic
[02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:44.320]  Fahrenheit 451.
[02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:47.280]  Print makes this sort of censorship virtually impossible.
[02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:51.520]  It allows you to hold a physical copy in your hand, a physical copy that you can now pick
[02:20:51.520 --> 02:20:57.840]  up in your city or order online in bulk at cost at infooreshop.com and give to your friends
[02:20:57.840 --> 02:20:58.840]  and family.
[02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:02.880]  We're going back to the very roots of free speech, the Gutenberg printing press, while
[02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:08.080]  also continuing to expand in an increasingly restrictive internet space where cybersecurity
[02:21:08.080 --> 02:21:12.560]  legislation is little different than that the state is doing to freedom of expression
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:13.560]  in Russia.
[02:21:13.560 --> 02:21:18.560]  More and more, the web is darkening as our authoritarian government expands its reach.
[02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:22.240]  While we continue to fight for internet and cyber freedom, it is important to embrace
[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:25.960]  print at a time when everyone else is abandoning it.
[02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:31.240]  Print media is important because it is not dependent on a device that can be controlled,
[02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:35.480]  disabled, or turned off by government kill switch or corporate kill switch at the whim
[02:21:35.480 --> 02:21:37.200]  of a corporation.
[02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:39.080]  All you need are your eyes.
[02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:43.400]  Print gives you the power, the power to the reader.
[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:47.400]  Over the next year, we will transform from a monthly to a weekly publication.
[02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:52.280]  We will also launch a franchising of a publication over the next few months.
[02:21:52.280 --> 02:21:57.320]  This will allow others that share our passionate love of liberty to add their local stories
[02:21:57.320 --> 02:22:02.000]  to our national and international content.
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.440]  Franchising will also allow you to share ad space.
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:09.040]  In addition, we will offer a digital copy of the publication, which you can receive
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:10.240]  for free.
[02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:16.040]  All you have to do is sign up for our newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:22:16.040 --> 02:22:20.120]  And I should add, franchisees will also be able to have subscribers in their geographic
[02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:27.200]  area with specialized tailored local news coverage.
[02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:31.760]  Continuing here, infowars.com forward slash newsletter to sign up for your free e-copy.
[02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:38.040]  Over the next year, we will transform the monthly to a weekly, as I just said.
[02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:40.360]  Franchising will also allow you to share ad space.
[02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:43.040]  In addition, we will offer a free digital copy of the publication, which you can receive
[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:44.040]  for free.
[02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:47.680]  All you have to do is sign up for the newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:52.960]  Ultimately, the success and this is key of this venture is up to you and other liberty
[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:57.480]  lovers eager to see the message of resistance delivered across all media.
[02:22:57.480 --> 02:23:03.000]  Hopefully, we will serve as an example that will help lead print back from oblivion and
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:08.680]  make a truly useful activist tool in the fight against global control freaks determined to
[02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:14.080]  dominate all media and wipe out the message of resistance as they move to consolidate power
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:15.480]  and dominate the world.
[02:23:15.480 --> 02:23:18.920]  Alex Jones.
[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:20.480]  And this is the great fight.
[02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:23.680]  15 years ago, you couldn't find organic food anywhere.
[02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:25.000]  People started voting with their dollars.
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:29.040]  Now it's displacing all the other crud food and they're coming back with counterfeits.
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:30.440]  Well, we are exposing that.
[02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:33.760]  They're catching a bunch of the major brands lying.
[02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:35.320]  This is what happens.
[02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:40.640]  And I believe if we put enough passion energy research into this, this will become successful
[02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:45.320]  economically, even in the depression, probably more so because it's a depression and will
[02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:47.000]  be one of the few islands of truth.
[02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:55.320]  And I actually welcome with relish knowing that as soon as this is proven as financially
[02:23:55.320 --> 02:24:02.960]  viable, we're going to see other local papers and national papers pop up in competition
[02:24:02.960 --> 02:24:03.960]  with us.
[02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:05.080]  In fact, they'll probably attack us.
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:06.200]  But that's what children do.
[02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:10.960]  It's part of the growing process, you know, mental children and that's okay.
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:13.160]  We were all mental children once.
[02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:14.600]  It's a thought process.
[02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:19.120]  But the point is that we welcome everyone else to do this.
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:20.720]  I know this is viable.
[02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:27.880]  Again, we already paid for the printing, the graphics people and other things with the amount
[02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:29.640]  of advertising we got.
[02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:35.120]  In fact, the Lord provides it didn't make any money this month.
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:38.440]  But what publication can make money when they first roll off?
[02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:39.440]  I looked into it.
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:41.240]  Basically, it's unknown.
[02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:43.000]  It's unknown with periodicals.
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.200]  It's unknown with magazines and newspapers.
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:53.360]  We're set next month to make a good profit, which I will plow back in, plow back in to
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:56.120]  hiring even more people because we've got to move towards the weekly.
[02:24:56.120 --> 02:25:01.720]  I've got to hire people that are specialists in dealing with, because I spend all my time
[02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:04.840]  just in lawyer stuff trying to just do basic stuff.
[02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:06.360]  We're not lawyer heavy around here.
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:07.360]  We're lawyer light.
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:13.040]  But I'm going to roll something out and got to have a basic code of ethics so people don't
[02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:22.160]  print the publication or town, there's a bunch of porn stuff in it or kill black, kill white.
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:23.160]  Basic code of stuff.
[02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:26.360]  We're going to work with people that are already publishing, people that have their heads screwed
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:28.240]  on straight.
[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:29.560]  But it's going to be info wars.
[02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:33.560]  But then it's going to explain that the local content, it'll be published in that area under
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:38.920]  their licensure with the info wars name, but they will take responsibility for their content
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:44.360]  we for ours, and again, third party authors not so much, you know, just basically say
[02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:47.360]  that we don't absolutely follow their views.
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:51.680]  But that's a small side caveat, it's just that's why we're not going right to the franchising
[02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:52.680]  up front.
[02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:53.680]  We're getting good at it.
[02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:57.880]  We're doing a few issues first and then moving into that.
[02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:01.520]  And it's going to be very, very successful.
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:03.000]  People are hungry for this.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:07.240]  In fact, that's all that's been successful is little specialty magazines and newspapers.
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:12.400]  For years, I've been talking to publishers around the country, successful local publishers.
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:15.400]  The Austin American Statesmen can't get people to subscribe to them.
[02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:16.840]  They can't give it away.
[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:23.080]  It's gone from a thick paper to a tiny paper because they keep pushing establishment propaganda.
[02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:27.920]  But they put out a satire joke, onion, they published the onion locally, which has national
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:29.120]  stuff and local stuff in it.
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:31.520]  And I had this idea six years ago before they even did it.
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:33.560]  This is just, you know, common sense move.
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:37.840]  Other's have the same idea, you know, I'm sure somebody looking at a swimming pool thinks
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:38.840]  about swimming in it.
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:42.160]  It's not like it's, you know, you're a rocket scientist that you want to swim in the swimming
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:44.160]  pool or you see a big cheeseburger, you want to eat it.
[02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:45.680]  Hey, somebody else is eating a cheeseburger.
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:46.680]  You're plagiarizing me.
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:47.800]  No, cheeseburgers are good, man.
[02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:48.800]  They taste good.
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:51.000]  I mean, they're necessarily good for your heart.
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:56.080]  But the point is, I forget my point, I'm kind of brainstorming here on the air about this
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:27:02.640]  in generalities is that this is a big deal.
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:09.880]  And this is up to you that it's success will rise or fall with you.
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:10.960]  And I know it's going to be successful.
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:16.440]  The question is how successful I would like this to be explosively successful, explosively
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:29.520]  successful because the idea of citizens in mass buying these at bulk at cost, I don't
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:33.400]  care if you're free market and go out on the street corner and, you know, sell them for
[02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:35.520]  $2 a piece and make a profit.
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:37.400]  I mean, that's what this is all about.
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:38.400]  Sell them in your shop.
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:42.160]  That's one thing we'll probably change even though it is going to be free is it says free
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:45.360]  on the cover, but people are buying them in bulk and are going to subscribe.
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:49.400]  We should have a note inside saying free on the street or something like that.
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:53.520]  But all people will be able to sell these too because it's not just about making money.
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:55.080]  It's about sustaining yourself.
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:58.800]  You sell them in your gas station, sell them at your church, sell them wherever, sell them
[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:01.200]  for $2, $3 because it's definitely worth it.
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:02.200]  48 pages.
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:03.200]  We plan to make it even bigger.
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:06.160]  All the graphics, all the articles, all of it, I'm going to show you some of this.
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:09.320]  In fact, I'm going to do a whole video on this today.
[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:12.800]  I'm going to come back and cover news here, but showing you with a document cam, you're
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:14.920]  watching at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:18.000]  I mean, it is just full.
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:21.840]  It is absolutely just full of the economic collapse.
[02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:23.240]  Where does money come from?
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:29.760]  Rome burned, will we, a brief history of false flag attacks, the shadow, Patsy rises again,
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:31.680]  bank cartel conquers America.

[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:50.880]  This exposes eugenics.
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:57.760]  Really modified apples are the newest GMO creation pushed on consumers.
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:28:59.040]  It's got a bunch of other stuff.
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:02.200]  It's got Ron Paul's latest article.

[02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:24.920]  flags.
[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:29.520]  It's got a big poster you can hang on the wall from.
[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:33.080]  It's kind of a they live knockoff.

[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:38.760]  It's just all here.
[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:40.600]  It goes on and on and on.
[02:29:40.600 --> 02:29:42.680]  This is going to absolutely shake people up.
[02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:47.040]  I mean, print media out there is a bunch of dribble, establishment politically correct
[02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:48.040]  garbage.

[02:29:55.280 --> 02:30:04.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[02:30:58.440 --> 02:31:03.560]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:03.560 --> 02:31:07.520]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:09.120]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:13.160]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[02:31:13.160 --> 02:31:14.160]  or gold?
[02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:17.600]  These true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:19.760]  possible that could even happen again.
[02:31:19.760 --> 02:31:24.320]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:31:24.320 --> 02:31:25.320]  seeds.
[02:31:25.320 --> 02:31:30.240]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:32.080]  food for you and your family.
[02:31:32.080 --> 02:31:33.200]  And here's the best part.
[02:31:33.200 --> 02:31:37.400]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:39.880]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:31:39.880 --> 02:31:43.120]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:43.120 --> 02:31:47.320]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:31:47.320 --> 02:31:51.280]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:58.960]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:31:58.960 --> 02:32:02.840]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:02.840 --> 02:32:07.040]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[02:32:07.040 --> 02:32:11.320]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire
[02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:14.960]  function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver
[02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:18.280]  solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:32:18.280 --> 02:32:23.040]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:27.640]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[02:32:27.640 --> 02:32:32.280]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[02:32:32.280 --> 02:32:35.800]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:32:35.800 --> 02:32:42.600]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive
[02:32:42.600 --> 02:32:43.600]  system.
[02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:51.000]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com
[02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:54.080]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[02:33:01.080 --> 02:33:18.520]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[02:33:18.520 --> 02:33:32.600]  the Info War.
[02:33:32.600 --> 02:34:02.560]  I'm going to get into the latest drone news, but first, I want to just briefly address
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:26.080]  the
[02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:31.680]  being pushed to the edge, tired of being treated like trashed, tired of being treated 50 steps
[02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:36.800]  lower than illegal aliens, tired of being treated like a milk cow that the government
[02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:45.800]  sticks a straw in and sucks dry, the establishment wants to get a war going between the police
[02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:56.280]  and military and the American people. The plan is for civil war. And the Southern Poverty
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:35:03.720]  Law Center was forced to retract in 2009 when Richard Poplowski, a dishonorably discharged
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:08.960]  marine and white supremacist, his mother threw him out of the house because he got a second
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:14.660]  pit bull. This is all on record. And she said, that's it. You're kicked out of the house.
[02:35:14.660 --> 02:35:19.760]  Your dogs are using the bathroom everywhere. And Poplowski, because to understand what
[02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:24.480]  happened yesterday with the ADL, he had to understand the past of this, Poplowski threw
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:29.880]  a fit. And when the cops got there, he grabbed his semi-auto Mac 90 and shot three of them,
[02:35:29.880 --> 02:35:35.400]  killing them. And instead of blaming the Marines for him killing them, and I'm not blaming
[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:39.800]  the Marines, but they would certainly be more to blame than I am. I know training him how
[02:35:39.800 --> 02:35:43.720]  to kill. I'm not saying that's even a bad thing because we train somebody who's good
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:49.600]  how to kill. They can protect themselves. The point is, he's drunk. This is all on record.
[02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:55.560]  He throws a fit. The cops come. He kills them. The most dangerous thing is a domestic dispute.
[02:35:55.560 --> 02:36:01.720]  Mama's boy with his tough guy pit bulls, urinating and defecating everywhere. Well, he showed
[02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:08.440]  mama, didn't he? Well, then he gives up. And within two hours of him and custody, the Southern
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:12.320]  Poverty Law Center beat Ryder. There at the local paper, came out and said he did it because
[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:18.080]  he's a fan of Alex Jones. And whenever, even before stuff like this happens, when Nightline
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:24.960]  or MSNBC or CNN, Rolling Stone, the list goes on and on. Whenever I get a call from a reporter
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:29.360]  or they're here physically, they go, aren't you worried you're going to cause violence?
[02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:35.280]  And I go, you know, gee, I'm calling for non-violence and I always have, but I am exposing, you
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:38.880]  know, that foreign banks are bragging they've conquered our country. They've been doing
[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:43.520]  that for years, but now they're out in the open, not just in their own publications,
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:50.360]  but you know, trade publications, but in our facing. And I told the Nightline guy, I said,
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:54.120]  let me show you clips of world leaders saying the crisis will be used to bring in one world
[02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:58.680]  government. No, no, I don't want to look at that. I just want to say you believe in this
[02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:06.440]  because you're delusional. So stuff like that happens. And so within two hours of this happening,
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:12.000]  the Southern Barbie Law Center and a bunch, literally more than 20 publications ran with
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:18.080]  it as a national point saying, Alex Jones is the reason this guy killed the cops.
[02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:24.040]  And that's done so they can demonize my free speech. And if cops are a gang, like any group
[02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:30.360]  of people, good gang, bad gang, if it's a gang, they start thinking you're killing them,
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:34.440]  they're going to come after you. So it's an attempt to, the oldest trick in the book
[02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:39.520]  is to manipulate police. Whenever they raided Sherry Peele Jackson, the IRS criminal investigator,
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:44.600]  she did nothing wrong with her free speech. She sees lasers on her head in her house and
[02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:49.560]  broad daylight. And her kids see lasers on her face and then they bust in and slam to
[02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:54.800]  the ground. It's all part of the theatrics. And the cops were like, wow, we didn't find
[02:37:54.800 --> 02:38:00.360]  anything the feds told us would be here. I have been in a parking lot at a land rights
[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:14.480]  meeting in 2006 at the Texas State Capitol, 1996 time flies. I have been there and walking
[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:19.280]  back to my car and I hear cops on their radio, state police going, yeah, they're Republic
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:23.600]  of Texas. Yeah, you know, so they probably got weapons. They may bomb us. Yeah, yeah.
[02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:28.360]  Well, there it's breaking up now. Their leader just quit speaking. And it was just me a minute
[02:38:28.360 --> 02:38:32.800]  before and I'm like, Hey guys, number one, I'm not with a Republic of Texas number two,
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:36.280]  you're demonizing that group. And number three, you're being lied to by whoever just told
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:42.800]  you that over the radio. So it's like an art form of lying to them, the higher ups sitting
[02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:47.960]  there. And I'm walking along and I hear them on the radio is like 20 feet away. And it
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:56.320]  was just ridiculous. You know what, I'll just address the 80 all tonight because I addressed
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:39:01.040]  it a little bit last night, but not in the focus way I want to. I mean, look, I don't
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:05.320]  want poison fluoride in the water. I don't want cancer viruses in the vaccines. It's
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:09.440]  all admitted. And you guys say I'm an evil conspiracy theorist because I know how to
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:16.040]  read major Harvard studies that are in the associated press. I mean, I'm freaked out.
[02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:22.120]  And I'm beyond tribalism just wanting to get in a fight with these people. I'm beyond
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:27.600]  it, man. I am beyond all this race stuff, all of it. And the ADL has been caught. You
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:31.760]  can go to the Wikipedia page. It has links to all the mainstream news running fake white
[02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:37.840]  supremacist groups. I went and re researched it last night and I'd forgotten so much. I
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:44.680]  mean, it really is a nasty organization. And now, oh yeah, going back to the Popoloski
[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:53.360]  story. So within hours they're saying it's my fault because it was on his computer.
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:57.320]  We get his handle and go find out he writes for all these big white supremacists that
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:05.040]  he was all over our website saying I was going to get it and stuff because I wasn't for violence
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:09.040]  and that I worked for the Jews and all this. I mean, that's another thing, man. I'm so
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:13.760]  sick of getting it from all the crazy white supremacist groups and who are all handled
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:20.240]  and run and run by the feds and others. And then the other side of the full spectrum dominance,
[02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:26.480]  the Southern Primary Law Center and ADL. I mean, I can't tell you how many cases where
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:32.600]  top white supremacists, top radio talk show host white supremacist, it's all FBI, ADL,
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:35.680]  Southern Primary Law Center. And it's not like they're infiltrating groups. They're
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:40.200]  running them. And I've got people that it's turned out we're working for the feds saying
[02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:45.080]  I'm evil, somebody ought to get me to their crazy audience.
[02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:49.400]  So I get to have the ADL attacking me, the Southern Primary Law Center. And then I get
[02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:57.400]  to have all these groups, all these white supremacist groups constantly threatening
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:06.240]  me. And it's just so mindless because folks, I'm right. I've got my finger on the pulse.
[02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:10.440]  I know what's going on. And believe me, it's not fun know what's going on. It's like a
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:15.120]  nightmare. Instantly being able to unspend things, instantly understanding the deeper
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:20.720]  meaning of things. It's like torture, basically. I mean, I wonder if my discernment and research
[02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:25.720]  has gotten to this level where I can't even articulate to you my understanding of things.
[02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:30.960]  It's torture. Everything is frustration. I just am so tired of it. Because there's
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:37.120]  a billion points I want to make. And verbally, you can't do it. Getting back to Boplowski.
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:41.400]  So within two hours of these cops being shot, they're not even cold yet. They're saying
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:47.600]  he was a fan of Alex Jones and I was his hero. And this is why I need to get in trouble
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:52.320]  or whatever. And the First Amendment's bad. And this is why we want to restrict the First
[02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:57.200]  Amendment and all this other garbage. So Paul Watson discovers this guy's all over the
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:01.280]  Internet saying he's going to get me and all this stuff. So we start sending it to the
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:09.520]  press going, you got to retract this, you know, I can sue you. And they all did retract,
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:14.960]  by the way, including the Southern Property Law Center. Because I'm not litigious. I mean,
[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:19.440]  I'm not looking forward to having to sue people I have before. Because once I sue you, I got
[02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:24.320]  to go perfect the case. I've got to make sure I win the case. And then if I get a judgment
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:30.080]  on somebody, I mean, I don't like get off on getting the judgment and enforcing the judgment
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:38.400]  and taking somebody's car, it's harder to get their house going after these companies.
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:43.800]  But the point is I got bigger fish to fry. I told him, I said, look, you're saying I'm
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:49.700]  helping get cops killed. I can't allow this to stand. Here he is. You know that you were
[02:42:49.700 --> 02:42:53.920]  given this information. And the thing is the Southern Property Law Center and ADL basically
[02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:58.800]  run the police departments now. And they're just in there demonizing the daylights out
[02:42:58.800 --> 02:43:04.900]  of people and scaring cops that the guy with a libertarian website on their car, a Ron
[02:43:04.900 --> 02:43:09.560]  Paul sticker, they're going to kill you. To the point of cops pull Ron Paul people over
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:13.640]  all the time for Ron Paul stickers. It's happened to friends of mine. And they ask them, got
[02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:19.200]  guns or got any bombs because you've got a Ron Paul sticker. That's an attempt to intimidate
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:24.080]  us. And so if we let that intimidation work, it's over folks. We go into tyranny. And so
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:28.760]  they're trying to do this right now. And we've got to reach out to the police and military.
[02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:33.960]  We've got to reach out in local communities. You've got to bring an intelligence file to
[02:43:33.960 --> 02:43:39.640]  your sheriff to your police chief and go look, here's the ADL breaking into police departments.
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:44.160]  Here they are, you know, they're people convicted of doing this. Here they are running white
[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:48.840]  supremacist leaders. Here they are doing all this. You've got to counter them with the
[02:43:48.840 --> 02:43:54.720]  real intelligence and the ADL smart. So the Southern Prairie Law Center, they'll get the
[02:43:54.720 --> 02:43:59.000]  police chief and give them a war, give them a trophy, have famous people there. They do
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:04.400]  it in every major city and they get the police chief up and give them awards. And I mean,
[02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:08.920]  it is just super creepy. And when you do that, you're a schmuck. When you do that, you're
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:18.800]  a chump, a sucker, a dupe, a useful idiot, a moron. When you go and have the ADL, on
[02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:26.560]  time the ADL put on a gun seminar to discuss gun violence. So I went to the synagogue where
[02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:30.760]  they were having it, was open to the public. And when it got time for the question and
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:34.160]  answer, I said, listen, you need to stop demonizing the Second Amendment, this legislator. And
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:41.000]  they said, get out of here. Get out of here. And I started getting up and leaving and they
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:49.000]  said, and don't try anything violent. There's no First Amendment with these people. Oh yeah,
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:54.080]  folks, I used to go protest at abortion clinics. I've marched into synagogues and anti-gun
[02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:58.000]  meetings. I mean, I'm back on the day when I was just doing local TV and radio, I used
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:02.880]  to hit it hard. That's what I'd rather be doing. And I've gone to churches that are
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:07.320]  having anti-gun meetings. I went to a Baptist church once, a Catholic church once. I mean,
[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:14.000]  it is just sick what's going on in these churches and synagogues and places. A bunch of brainwashing.
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:18.440]  And the ADL wants to shut down free speech in this country. So does the Southern Barbery
[02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:24.360]  Law Center. All the legislation they support is just unbelievably un-American. And they
[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:31.160]  are provocaturing. They've been caught provocaturing. Everything I'm saying is on record. And my
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:35.560]  lawyer has put the ADL on notice before. They actually changed an article that had stuff
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:39.600]  that was wrong in there. It was that I was calling for violence against immigrants. And
[02:45:39.600 --> 02:45:44.880]  I said, look, I'm not going to let you set me up. So my lawyer who they noticed was about
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:50.640]  as high-powered as it gets in Austin, they responded. And I'm not here running around
[02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:56.480]  swinging a big hatchet at you politically. Here's the deal. I want my freedom and I'm
[02:45:56.480 --> 02:46:00.080]  going to fight for it politically. You're not getting my guns. You're not getting my
[02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:04.000]  second amendment. I mean, both these groups are the most anti-civil rights groups you
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:09.960]  can imagine. And they're there to play blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians off against each
[02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:18.080]  other. A lot of these big organizations are. And these are poverty pimps like Obama that
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:25.040]  create racial division in the name of fighting it. And it's divide and conquer. And it's
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:30.200]  all part and parcel of the eugenics with the Planned Parenthood and the abortions and all
[02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:38.240]  the rest of it. And so this latest event I'd seen in the news was police don't know why
[02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:46.360]  they shot at them at the Valero station. Police don't know why they ambushed them at a trailer
[02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:52.480]  park. Turns out they were surveilling them because they were gun owners. Turns out that
[02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:57.240]  they were planning to swat team them. And it turns out now we're getting reports that
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:47:02.360]  looks like the cops may have been shooting. And see, this isn't going to be like Waco
[02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:05.920]  where you come and you shoot up everybody and then they shoot back and then you put
[02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:10.200]  your hands up and everybody then stops shooting. People know you'll just burn them down and
[02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:15.880]  kill them. So they know they don't have anything anywhere to go when you've got locally, federally
[02:47:15.880 --> 02:47:25.760]  funded, anti-constitutionalist task forces operating in Louisiana. And you rush in, people
[02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:29.080]  in this climate are going to start shooting back. And by the way, in the future, they're
[02:47:29.080 --> 02:47:34.680]  not just going to wait at the trailer park. I mean, you understand that, right? If this
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:40.040]  civil war starts, you are to be destroyed. And they plan on using patriots to do it.
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:46.000]  And I'd say, don't do it. Don't do it. But you don't have a choice when the police are
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:50.560]  coming in with their guns drawn because they've been told you're terrorist. People are just
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:57.560]  going to say time to die. Whether you're going home in a body bag or they are. The American
[02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:02.200]  people have had incredible restraint. And now with all this demonization, the point
[02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:07.680]  is, is that now the police, one of the seven they arrested, they're saying not one of the
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:16.200]  shooters, but one of their friends on a Facebook said he liked the Alex Jones show. Facebook
[02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:23.240]  says, who do you want to meet? Who do you like? Alex Jones. And the way this is written
[02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:28.680]  in David Koresh. Yeah, right. No one in the patriot movement says, I would like to meet
[02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:33.240]  Alex Jones and David Koresh. Everyone knew David Koresh was a weirdo. The point is, they
[02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:38.160]  picked him and singled him out to kill those people, start a war against the American people
[02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:42.760]  and churches and people that want to be left alone. So they picked a group they thought
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:47.720]  they could demonize easily. That all came out in court documents and congressional hearings.
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:53.840]  And if you like the idea of dozens of little kids being burned up and blown up by the feds
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:58.680]  with the troops shooting them as they tried to leave all on FLIR footage, you're sick.
[02:48:58.680 --> 02:49:06.280]  And you idiots at the New World Order think that you're going to intimidate us starting
[02:49:06.280 --> 02:49:12.160]  a civil war. One Waco woke this country up. So you had to do Oklahoma City to counter
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:17.800]  blaming on us. You pull more Waco's, ladies and gentlemen, the American people are not
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:22.720]  going to go after the police and the military unless they get it in their way. They're going
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:29.720]  to come after you. And that's the basic message, okay? Just because you can set up people or
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:34.480]  find people that are on the edge. First, they said they were criminals and all this stuff
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:39.560]  and just using sovereign citizen name. Now it looks like they all had jobs, businesses.
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:42.880]  We don't know what really happened with these people. We don't even know if they shot the
[02:49:42.880 --> 02:49:47.120]  cops. I've seen so much lies. I saw a case where the Travis County SWAT team shot one
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:52.240]  of their own officers in the back going up the steps so they blame the guy inside. That
[02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:56.200]  happened out in Lubbock a few years ago, too, where the SWAT teams went in and shot their
[02:49:56.200 --> 02:50:01.360]  own people so they blame the guy. But it turned out he didn't have a gun. And a good SWAT team
[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:08.800]  member went public and told the truth. You know, look, I don't want this war to take
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:16.080]  place. But if the globalists start this civil war, I would suggest that police departments
[02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:19.960]  once you, because you're not going to listen. I understand that. But once you're really
[02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:26.440]  losing the fight big time, remember I told you all this. If it goes to this because you're
[02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:32.880]  meant to lose, they've done the numbers. Okay. You pick a fight with the American constitutionalist.
[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:37.160]  You're going to lose. You're going to pick a fight with 30 million veterans. A lot of
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:42.760]  them who don't even like life and are very depressed and screwed up. They are going to
[02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:47.520]  come after you. They're going to come into your police stations. You hurt their family
[02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:52.640]  members. They're going to come after you like a terminator. Now, we don't want to go there,
[02:50:52.640 --> 02:51:03.240]  do we? I know I don't. I know I like living. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[02:54:00.600 --> 02:54:10.280]  I'm going to close by saying this, and I'll do a more focused breakdown than I on the
[02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:15.480]  nightly news I'm hosting it. I know a lot of police. They're really good men and women
[02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:19.720]  on average. Most of them did join because it seemed like a good career opportunity because
[02:54:19.720 --> 02:54:23.960]  they were in the military or they were from rural communities and they want to go after
[02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:29.240]  bad guys. And they find out it's really about revenue generating and putting on a show most
[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:35.080]  of the time. I know most police are good men and women. And look, this isn't theatrics.
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:38.680]  You know the globalists are trying to tell you there's going to be a civil war and that
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:44.680]  you will face veterans and gun owners. And now you're taking the posture on of getting
[02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:50.120]  in people's faces. You pull somebody over and harass them a couple times for their Ron
[02:54:50.120 --> 02:54:58.640]  Paul sticker. You just radicalize them against you. You're falling right into the trap. It's
[02:54:58.640 --> 02:55:04.880]  like we're two roosters and they're putting us in a dirt floor arena to kill each other.
[02:55:04.880 --> 02:55:10.400]  It's stupid. I'm so tired of watching the globalists play everybody off against each
[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:15.480]  other. They're trying to get soons and Shiites to start a big civil war over there to kill
[02:55:15.480 --> 02:55:21.320]  millions of people. They're trying to do that here. Folks, they are geared up. I've studied
[02:55:21.320 --> 02:55:26.320]  the architecture of this new world or takeover. They are gearing up to try to go. They're arresting
[02:55:26.320 --> 02:55:31.760]  people all over the country. Talk show hosting people now. We just confirmed another case
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:37.120]  who make mild statements about I'm getting my guns in case stuff collapses. The Hatari
[02:55:37.120 --> 02:55:40.600]  militia, the feds were in it. I told people that for it happened. I could tell they were
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:46.160]  being set up out of 2000 groups. I saw videos they did. I could tell, oh, that's federal
[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:51.400]  because it looked like a cartoon. I just smell this stuff out, folks. I just immediately
[02:55:51.400 --> 02:55:56.160]  know stuff. And the point is, is I warned them and then I got criticized for saying you've
[02:55:56.160 --> 02:56:00.200]  been infiltrated and it turned out the feds were in there. They're like, what do we do
[02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:04.920]  if things collapse and they come to get our guns, the UN? Well, I guess we got a fight.
[02:56:04.920 --> 02:56:09.080]  Well, it's all right as Americans to say, if there's foreign occupation, we're going
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:15.240]  to fight. They arrested them for that. And I told you they were innocent. There's coming
[02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:20.560]  a time, folks, where they're going to try to arrest me. And let me tell you, once stuff
[02:56:20.560 --> 02:56:25.920]  like that starts police, then it's going to radicalize everybody and they're not going
[02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:31.560]  to, people are going to really get into an aggressive mode. We want to keep things in
[02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:35.400]  a discussion here.
[02:56:35.400 --> 02:56:39.640]  But I know humans like to have wars and kill each other. And there's a kind of fascination
[02:56:39.640 --> 02:56:44.000]  like an arsonist has of let's just get the fire going. Let's just, let's just, let's
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:48.960]  just do it. Let's just have war in America. Let's kill the conservatives and libertarians
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:53.960]  and let's kill the Alex Jones supporters and let's arrest them and let's, oh, so, so we
[02:56:53.960 --> 02:56:58.360]  can have great agenda 21. I mean, my gosh, think about your children. Think about how
[02:56:58.360 --> 02:57:03.640]  innocent they are, people that work for the government and the bureaucrats. Think about,
[02:57:03.640 --> 02:57:09.320]  think about how good this country's been and look at what we're bringing in. Total world
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:14.480]  government run by foreign banks and the ADL says the world government doesn't exist as
[02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:19.960]  it's announced everywhere. We're the good guys, the patriots. Does that mean there aren't
[02:57:19.960 --> 02:57:24.800]  some dirt balls and people that take on that mantle with their revolutionaries because they
[02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:32.360]  see it as fashionable? Sure. And the government will focus in on them and on horrible tragic
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:37.480]  events like these police officers getting killed to then try to get you hyped up to
[02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:43.520]  go out and I will find somebody who's a member of that gang, that patriot gang. Again, they're
[02:57:43.520 --> 02:57:47.040]  telling you, you're the cop gang and anybody that's against the new world order, they're
[02:57:47.040 --> 02:57:54.560]  that cop killer gang. And it's going to become a self fulfilling prophecy. And so the shot
[02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:59.240]  heard around the world, cops are going to start killing patriots. You're going to kill
[02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:04.760]  the wrong person's brother. And then they're going to come after you. It'll be some poor
[02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:09.600]  innocent cops in a restaurant. You know how it'll work. And then that's and then the cops
[02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:15.480]  will go even crazier. And then the fight starts. Then the fight starts. And then the hammer
[02:58:15.480 --> 02:58:21.040]  gets dropped on you. The globalists want to destroy the police and military. Look at
[02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:25.920]  their own documents. Once you're out of the military, they say you're the terrorist. Don't
[02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:33.040]  play this game. Again, ADL, boom, trying to connect me to these cop killings. Ladies and
[02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:38.800]  gentlemen, that's because we are doing everything we can to stop this and the federal provocateurs
[02:58:38.800 --> 02:58:52.480]  want to get it going right now. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCN Live.com today.
[02:58:52.480 --> 02:58:56.880]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest
[02:58:56.880 --> 02:59:02.400]  half year on record. 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions. Not only corn,
[02:59:02.400 --> 02:59:07.280]  but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and wheat are all impacted, raising prices. The cost
[02:59:07.280 --> 02:59:11.960]  to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:59:11.960 --> 02:59:16.620]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting
[02:59:16.620 --> 02:59:21.760]  your own supply of foods from Eat Foods Direct now. As the price of raw ingredients increases,
[02:59:21.760 --> 02:59:25.640]  Eat Foods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply. I recently
[02:59:25.640 --> 02:59:29.320]  increased my supply from Eat Foods Direct because we've all known this was coming. You
[02:59:29.320 --> 02:59:33.840]  know about their delicious long term storable foods. The fact is you can eat it anytime
[02:59:33.840 --> 02:59:37.880]  to save money today and because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices
[02:59:37.880 --> 02:59:44.040]  and avoiding the rising food cost. Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to EatFoodsDirect.com

[03:00:47.600 --> 03:00:49.400]  your point? What's your question?
[03:00:49.400 --> 03:00:58.320]  Hi, Alex. Yeah, I just wanted to point it out that for everybody listening in law enforcement
[03:00:58.320 --> 03:01:07.400]  of the thing that do they want a foreign dictatorial coup for their children to live under and for
[03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:15.720]  the military is the road to Persian is a suicide. And that's it. That's my point.
[03:01:15.720 --> 03:01:22.360]  Thank you so much. Yeah, it's just disgusting to watch the globalists get the police and
[03:01:22.360 --> 03:01:27.000]  military brainwash that people that are American and understand the takeover that we're the
[03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:32.920]  bad guys. When everything we were saying that the government said was a lie is now admitted.
[03:01:32.920 --> 03:01:37.840]  It's like, oh, you were proven right. They're terrorists. They don't like the world government.
[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:43.200]  I thought I was a terrorist because I was lying about one being set up. Most people
[03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:48.400]  are peer pressure driven. They get in a gang mentality. And I'm just I'm just telling you
[03:01:48.400 --> 03:01:53.120]  I'm really concerned, folks. I studied the architecture of this whole thing. It looks
[03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:58.840]  super bad. Susan in Colorado, you're on the air and then John in Ohio. Go ahead, Susan.
[03:01:58.840 --> 03:02:04.800]  Oh, hi, Alex. I am an RN in Colorado and I am just beside myself and feel so violated
[03:02:04.800 --> 03:02:12.800]  that the public health department has passed the rule regulation to mandate vaccine percentages
[03:02:12.800 --> 03:02:17.320]  for health care workers. Yeah, it's not a law. It's all fraud. They'll try to make you
[03:02:17.320 --> 03:02:22.720]  wear a mask. It's like like wearing a yellow star in a concentration camp. It's all fraud,
[03:02:22.720 --> 03:02:26.600]  fight them, get together, sue them over it because it came out the flu shot doubles your
[03:02:26.600 --> 03:02:31.160]  chances of getting the flu the next year. Just get the literature together, sue them.
[03:02:31.160 --> 03:02:37.120]  But they're making it so that you can only have a narrow medical exemption to even wear
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:43.840]  the mask. Take the shot or get terminated. And who can get terminated? So I'm almost
[03:02:43.840 --> 03:02:48.760]  thinking I'm going to have to take the shot because I have to work and then fight it as
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:54.680]  I go along because ma'am ma'am, it's a death sentence. These flu shots have been absolutely
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:03:01.200]  confirmed to give you cancer, brain damage, epilepsy, narcolepsy, brain cancer, autoimmune
[03:03:01.200 --> 03:03:07.800]  disorders. I mean, it's listen, these are these big pharma have been caught killing
[03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:12.600]  foster children in studies. I mean, this would be like the devil showing up with a shot and
[03:03:12.600 --> 03:03:17.000]  you taking it. They're total authoritarian trash.
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:21.440]  Hey, absolutely agree. But what would what would you do or what would somebody do who
[03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:26.080]  needs to work and you can run but you can't hide because every it's all a fraud. It's
[03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:30.520]  all a fraud. Just you can find it. Number one, the exemption is to a rule. That was like,
[03:03:30.520 --> 03:03:35.760]  you got to get an exemption when it's not even it's a regulation. It's just made up.
[03:03:35.760 --> 03:03:42.200]  And so what you do is you you tell them that you're not going to wear the mask and that
[03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:45.320]  it's a fraud that there rules of fraud and that you're going to sue them for wrongful
[03:03:45.320 --> 03:03:52.120]  termination if they let you go. Oh, okay. I mean, ma'am, ma'am, I mean, I'm not going
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:55.640]  to give you that's what I would do. Okay, you do what you think's best. Okay, but I'll
[03:03:55.640 --> 03:04:00.720]  tell you this. I mean, I I run into these young 25 year old trips on their second, third
[03:04:00.720 --> 03:04:05.240]  tour and they're like, Oh, yeah, we know D you's not supposed to be used and we breathe
[03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:08.440]  some of it, but I'm young. I'm tough. I run into them five years later and they're down
[03:04:08.440 --> 03:04:14.800]  to cancer. Look, nothing is worth your life. Okay, these are murderers. Okay, they know
[03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:18.360]  the vaccines are killing people. Have you looked at how brain damage and dumb the public
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:23.520]  are? Well, you know, I'm even looking within my facility and I am just surprised that there's
[03:04:23.520 --> 03:04:28.600]  not more health care workers that are in an uproar or over this. The ones that don't want
[03:04:28.600 --> 03:04:34.520]  to take the shot just feel so compelled to take it. You should get together and form
[03:04:34.520 --> 03:04:38.880]  your own group and have a class action lawsuit. They tried to make it to law in Massachusetts
[03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:44.080]  and it failed. We're out of time. Sorry to John and others. Huge retransmission coming
