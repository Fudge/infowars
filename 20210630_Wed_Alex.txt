[00:00.000 --> 00:29.960]  This country in its 250 years history has never had traitors as bad as
[00:29.960 --> 00:35.560]  Honor Ray and Millie and Austin. These men, once they've been politically, culturally,
[00:35.560 --> 00:42.080]  economically and using the criminal justice system defeated, will be known as the new
[00:42.080 --> 00:47.840]  definition of Benedict Arnold. They are the plague. They are a curse. And they are planning,
[00:47.840 --> 00:53.000]  in my view, false flagged terror attacks here in America to cement their rollout against us.
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.600]  They're spoiling for a war. They're spoiling for a coup. They're spoiling to overthrow. And
[00:58.600 --> 01:04.640]  they're getting ready to carry out terror attacks, that is, their handlers are, to be blamed on those
[01:04.640 --> 01:08.960]  of us, their loyal Americans, in our opposition to the destruction of the country and the sellout
[01:08.960 --> 01:13.440]  of the nation. And they're all over television saying, Trump question the election is an act
[01:13.440 --> 01:17.440]  of terror, and he's got to be dealt with by the military. The government's going to kill this
[01:17.440 --> 01:22.000]  guy. And they're on channel saying, we need to get members of Congress using the military. People
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.960]  sitting in Congress right now, people in and around the former president. And then General Millie
[01:27.960 --> 01:33.760]  and General Austin and General Honorary get up there and click their heels and say, we want to
[01:33.760 --> 01:39.200]  slug out with the American people. And every white person that doesn't salute us is a white
[01:39.200 --> 01:44.360]  supremacist enemy. And we're the Americans and they're Hitler. And we're going to get up. We're
[01:44.360 --> 01:52.640]  ready for war. Turn us loose. We're going to get America. Death to America says Millie. Death to
[01:52.640 --> 02:14.000]  America says Austin. Death to America says Honorary. To chronicle the treason and anti American
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.360]  activities of General Honorary, Austin and Millie, it would take years. Let us examine only one
[02:21.360 --> 02:28.720]  small data point, the gun confiscation that took place after the Katrina hurricane, where
[02:28.720 --> 02:35.480]  peaceful people high and dry under the orders of Honorary had their firearms stolen and taken
[02:35.480 --> 02:42.240]  from them, never to be returned. The police and National Guard going street by street, house
[02:42.240 --> 02:48.840]  to house, sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn and instructions to disarm anyone
[02:48.840 --> 02:54.440]  inside. You say guns will be taken. No one will be able to be armed. We'll take all weapons. And now
[02:54.440 --> 03:01.320]  Honorary is organizing the national response for the Democratic Party for gun confiscation. That
[03:01.320 --> 03:05.760]  happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their
[03:05.760 --> 03:12.520]  mansions. Residents were handcuffed on the ground. In the end, police took their weapons but let
[03:12.520 --> 03:17.400]  them stay in their homes. For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to
[03:17.400 --> 03:24.360]  do this in an American city. This guard unit occupied a church using it as a base camp. All of a
[03:24.360 --> 03:31.560]  sudden they were banging on the front door, the side door, and the back door. They let us in.
[03:34.120 --> 03:39.480]  I said it's not even loaded. I really thought they were going to kill me. They took them
[03:40.840 --> 03:44.600]  and they didn't have a right to take them. They didn't have a reason to take them. You never expect
[03:44.600 --> 03:49.560]  to do this in your own country. Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than the trolling
[03:49.560 --> 03:54.760]  American neighborhoods. Walking up and down these streets, you don't want to think about the stuff
[03:54.760 --> 03:59.320]  that you're going to have to do. Somebody pops around the corner. Let me shoot an American. Yeah.
[04:00.040 --> 04:07.240]  You know them by their fruits, as Christ said. A leopard never changes its spots. Here,
[04:07.240 --> 04:15.160]  infocus is the treason of honoree against the Second Amendment and America. Info wars. Info wars.
[04:15.160 --> 04:24.760]  Info wars. Info wars. Info wars. Info wars. Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
[04:24.760 --> 04:29.160]  Owen Schreuer here in the Info Wars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[04:29.160 --> 04:39.320]  And coming up on the other side is going to be Alex Jones down at the southern border. And he
[04:39.320 --> 04:44.920]  tells me we had brief conversations. The footage is coming now. He says, Owen, we have the most
[04:44.920 --> 04:49.560]  unbelievable footage that we've ever captured from the border. You're not going to believe it.
[04:49.560 --> 04:55.240]  He was breathless on the phone. And so, yeah, we've had half a million people come across
[04:55.240 --> 04:58.600]  the border illegally since Kamala Harris has been put in charge. And it's worse than that.
[04:58.600 --> 05:02.840]  The fourth of July super sales starts now. And in four more stores.
[05:03.720 --> 05:09.080]  July 4th, 2021 is now upon us. And that means our yearly big sale is here.

[05:53.000 --> 05:58.280]  The 4th of July Super Sale starts now at infowarstore.com.
[06:11.480 --> 06:19.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, June 30th, 2021. Info Wars is on the air so the
[06:19.960 --> 06:26.440]  resistance is still alive, but the globalist assault on America continues and our very own
[06:26.440 --> 06:31.400]  Alex Jones is down at the southern border witnessing it happening and Alex is on the
[06:31.400 --> 06:36.200]  line with us now with perhaps we're about to reveal the most unbelievable footage from the
[06:36.200 --> 06:41.560]  southern border that we've seen yet to this date. Alex Jones on the line, what have you
[06:41.560 --> 06:45.880]  witnessed in McAllen, Texas since your arrival at the border last evening?
[06:45.880 --> 06:54.200]  Well, Owen, I want to be calm here because this is the most insane thing I've ever seen.
[06:55.640 --> 07:00.280]  Way crazier than sneaking into Bohemian Grove and catching the only footage of the ritual
[07:01.000 --> 07:07.160]  way crazier than being behind the scenes with Trump, you know, with the RNC 2016.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.320]  Crazier than watching my first children born because what I witnessed today
[07:13.320 --> 07:22.840]  in 45 minutes, in 45 minutes, you have to understand something, we left after 45 minutes
[07:22.840 --> 07:28.200]  to come back to the hotel so that we would have better bandwidth to upload the raw footage that
[07:28.200 --> 07:33.960]  should be up on Bandog video in the next 20 minutes or so. And it's just raw unedited
[07:33.960 --> 07:42.200]  just from one of our cameras, 42 minute video. Let me just start here. Okay.
[07:45.640 --> 07:52.840]  One of our great camera guys, Zach, who's been here, I guess, eight years,
[07:54.280 --> 07:57.640]  he was with us here the last time we were here a couple of months ago.
[07:58.360 --> 08:01.960]  And I looked over and he had tears in his eyes. And I said, What's going on?
[08:01.960 --> 08:05.240]  And he's not a drama queen. He goes, I just caught on tape.
[08:06.200 --> 08:10.680]  One of the little kids was going around looking for somebody crying. They don't have a parent
[08:10.680 --> 08:16.360]  with them. And then I saw the child about 50 yards away inside the COVID testing center and
[08:16.360 --> 08:23.720]  they just disappeared. And then we just kind of glossed over that. And then I saw that over and
[08:23.720 --> 08:29.480]  over again, you know, at a mall or at an amusement park when a child's alone scared for their mom or
[08:29.480 --> 08:39.720]  dad, ladies and gentlemen, on the 42 minutes of video that's being uploaded and understand,
[08:39.720 --> 08:47.560]  this is going on two miles from me right now, continually. We were there 42 minutes and I saw
[08:49.160 --> 08:54.520]  three buses deliver people. I saw six or seven other buses dubbing people off down the street.
[08:54.520 --> 09:02.520]  I saw dozens of vans. The Catholic charity here in McAllen has at least seven big buildings,
[09:02.520 --> 09:07.480]  one of them is 80 yards long warehouse. When the doors open, you just see hundreds of women
[09:07.480 --> 09:14.920]  and children inside. And I'm standing there as a bus pulls up. There's another bus around
[09:14.920 --> 09:20.600]  the corner dubbing people off of the alleyway with people in cages. Wait till I get to that.
[09:20.600 --> 09:26.600]  So I'm telling you, folks, people in cages with private mercenaries wearing Catholic
[09:26.600 --> 09:32.280]  charity outfits, driving Border Patrol buses with guns on their sides. So Biden has deputized
[09:32.280 --> 09:37.240]  all these people with the child smugglers. We confronted them, by the way, and the Border
[09:37.240 --> 09:42.120]  Patrol came because they are their enforcers. And then the Border Patrol is said before they
[09:42.120 --> 09:47.240]  relieved him of command that they now complete the smuggling process. But I'm standing there
[09:47.240 --> 09:54.600]  about 30 minutes into this feed, again, that you're all going to see being shot on an iPhone,
[09:54.600 --> 10:00.600]  because all the other cameras were fogged up in the rain. And I witnessed children looking around
[10:00.600 --> 10:07.240]  carrying blankets, looking around, I don't know where they are, without mothers and get this blonde
[10:07.240 --> 10:14.120]  haired blue-eyed children without their mothers, without their fathers coming up to the security
[10:14.120 --> 10:21.080]  guard and saying, in English, I heard them saying, I want my mother. And I started screaming at my
[10:21.080 --> 10:25.720]  screaming, I was going to call the police, call 911, and the kid gets into this spider hole,
[10:25.720 --> 10:29.800]  and the door closes with our men smiling at us, the ones that didn't have masks on.
[10:30.600 --> 10:35.960]  This is beyond anything I have ever imagined. So you all know when you see a child that's lost
[10:35.960 --> 10:40.440]  at Target or Walmart, you all know when a child gets lost at church, you take them to the front
[10:40.440 --> 10:47.560]  and the PA says, we have a small child here, his name's Corey or whatever. We have to come here,
[10:47.560 --> 10:49.880]  we have to have a permanent office, which is going to be dangerous, because they'll probably
[10:49.880 --> 10:55.160]  send cartels after it's next. That's why we kind of hit and run here, because it's all cartel run.
[10:56.680 --> 11:01.240]  We have to come down here and stay at McAllen now, because this is human smuggling, these are
[11:01.240 --> 11:06.360]  kidnapped children. The Senate report said that thousands of children under Obama were knowingly
[11:06.360 --> 11:13.000]  placed with child rapists. And so this is just an expansion of that. This is tenfold conservatively.
[11:13.560 --> 11:20.520]  The amount of activity we saw last time, and it was like a beehive of buses and of vans and of
[11:20.520 --> 11:26.120]  taxis, putting them on buses, putting them on planes, charter planes, weird, creepy dudes.
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.040]  You know, they're picking up kids for themselves, no IDs, people wearing masks.
[11:32.040 --> 11:38.440]  But wait till you see the footage. It's being uploaded right now. In fact, Rob is in the room
[11:38.440 --> 11:42.840]  next to me. I should probably text him guys and tell him to send you guys a screenshot of the
[11:42.840 --> 11:47.640]  blonde-haired blue-eyed kids. And again, I'm sitting there, and I go, why am I staring at these
[11:47.640 --> 11:53.880]  kids? They were barefoot, barefoot, sitting there holding all they had was a blanket in their hand,
[11:53.880 --> 11:58.840]  with huge black circles around their eyes, blonde-haired blue-eyed children, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:58.840 --> 12:05.240]  But again, okay, maybe the woman married an Anglo guy. No, these kids were not with them. They were
[12:05.240 --> 12:11.480]  looking for an adult and saying, I want my mommy. In English, I heard them walk up to the security
[12:11.480 --> 12:17.240]  guard and said, I want my mommy. And I almost jumped over, they put a little fence up there now,
[12:17.240 --> 12:21.800]  almost jumped over and tackled the security guard and grabbed the kid, but I'd be in jail. Then
[12:22.760 --> 12:28.440]  we see another car cramming kids in it without safety seats. I walk over and I say,
[12:28.440 --> 12:33.880]  that's illegal. They call the police, the police come. I didn't block the car at that time too long.
[12:33.880 --> 12:37.080]  The police say, well, you're right, I would have given them a ticket if that happened, call me again.
[12:38.360 --> 12:43.480]  But this is all on tape. And then the left says what we shot back in April was fake, Owen,
[12:43.480 --> 12:48.280]  even though it's all real. And they said, surge the border and you see children being thrown over,
[12:48.280 --> 12:53.480]  babies thrown over the 20-foot fence, bouncing at the bottom, and then being sent back over and over
[12:53.480 --> 12:59.560]  again to smuggle humans in. But we know hundreds of thousands of children are kidnapped from the
[12:59.560 --> 13:04.440]  U.S. every year. The Amber Alert system is run by Laurel Sillsby who changed her name,
[13:04.440 --> 13:08.360]  who was convicted for smuggling children for the Clintons out of Haiti, many of which ended up,
[13:08.360 --> 13:14.040]  by the way, never seen again or alive. She runs the tracking system for Amber Alert.
[13:14.040 --> 13:19.400]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, we, and I'm just going to say
[13:19.400 --> 13:24.200]  point blank, we need people to donate at mfoldwarstore.com, a purchase of a product's donation.
[13:24.200 --> 13:29.160]  You can be our sponsor, give a five-time gift, one-time gift, a hundred-times gift. You can give
[13:29.160 --> 13:34.440]  $100, $5, $1. You can do recurring gifts, but we need money because I don't have the money to keep
[13:34.440 --> 13:39.240]  a team down here and to come down here myself at least a day a week. It's five and a half hours
[13:39.240 --> 13:43.880]  from Austin. We need the funds to do this. This, oh, and here's the whole other area.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.600]  There are tens of thousands of people, it's estimated, by the rest of my crew because we've
[13:48.600 --> 13:56.680]  got the crew split. They're out at the airport where Trump is about to land at the DPS airport
[13:56.680 --> 14:00.280]  outside of McAllen, and he's going to come to the DPS facility and have a press conference with
[14:00.280 --> 14:04.200]  Governor Abbott. Okay, great. And Governor Abbott has actually done something now, calling in foreign
[14:04.200 --> 14:08.040]  state police from outside Texas, and they are trying to arrest the illegals for trespassing
[14:08.040 --> 14:12.120]  and breaking and entering in the crimes they're already getting picked up for. But the counties
[14:12.120 --> 14:18.440]  locally have pulled out of the emergency declaration, and so they're now, as sanctuary counties,
[14:18.440 --> 14:24.600]  aiding and abetting the smugglers, the cartels, and Trump needs to come to downtown McAllen,
[14:24.600 --> 14:29.560]  where they have at least seven buildings with buses and people and smuggling to the left and
[14:29.560 --> 14:35.240]  the right. No Fox News, no CNN, nobody. No, instead they're going to have rallies and raw,
[14:35.240 --> 14:40.120]  raw. We're upset about what's happening at the border. That's fine and dandy, but it's the exposure
[14:40.120 --> 14:45.720]  of what's happening here. That is the most important because you can go to downtown McAllen at the
[14:45.720 --> 14:50.360]  corner of 15th Street in Austin, and you can see this for yourself. We're going to go back down
[14:50.360 --> 14:55.640]  there today, and there's there's towns like this all over the border. The same thing. They had hundreds,
[14:55.640 --> 15:00.520]  what, 100, Tim Enlow, my security guy, smart guys here, he's been following this. How many people
[15:00.520 --> 15:06.200]  did one sector grab in the last few months? 174,000 in Del Rio. 174,000 in Del Rio sector,
[15:06.200 --> 15:11.000]  and Tim will come on next segment with you, but you have to understand, I could take just this
[15:11.000 --> 15:18.200]  42-minute video and have Alex Jones tries to block human smugglers again, Alex, women and
[15:18.200 --> 15:25.880]  children transported in cages delivered by private mercenaries to alleyway, but it goes
[15:25.880 --> 15:35.000]  on and on. Imagine, that's me and my crew in 42 minutes. This is one non-stop deal,
[15:35.000 --> 15:41.640]  42 minutes, and we can't even digest all this. This is the level of the replacement
[15:41.640 --> 15:47.400]  migration crime that's been committed with the UN shutting down, the world food supply for the
[15:47.400 --> 15:51.320]  last year and a half, with the global lockdown, the first world collapse, the third world dies,
[15:51.320 --> 15:54.520]  but they ask these people, why are you here? They said, we're starving, there's no businesses,
[15:54.520 --> 15:57.960]  there's no land, we're not allowed to leave our houses. We'll be right back with Alex Jones at the
[15:57.960 --> 16:06.280]  border. Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person,
[16:06.280 --> 16:11.080]  it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular, they know you're angry,
[16:11.640 --> 16:15.560]  and now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every
[16:15.560 --> 16:21.000]  tool we've got. Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts,
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.640]  you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and
[16:25.640 --> 16:30.120]  special reports and share them with everyone you know. Take action now by texting the word
[16:30.120 --> 16:40.680]  news, NEWS to 833-470-0438. That's 833-470-0438 for Info Wars Emergency News Alerts, or text the
[16:40.680 --> 16:49.000]  word show to 833-470-0438 and receive live show notifications. Take action now, rate the chain
[16:49.000 --> 16:57.640]  reaction, and tell others to share those texts. Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[17:00.440 --> 17:05.160]  The globalists are having their revolution, but for humanity has to have its revolution.
[17:05.880 --> 17:14.040]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[17:14.040 --> 17:22.200]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves,
[17:23.240 --> 17:30.040]  worse than slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system, rendered down to be servile
[17:30.760 --> 17:37.080]  minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control. We have to recognize the
[17:37.080 --> 17:41.560]  great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia, and we have to promote
[17:41.560 --> 17:47.640]  liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia. It's that choice, it's that realization
[17:47.640 --> 17:53.080]  that's going to change the world, and it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to
[17:53.080 --> 17:59.240]  evil. It is a spiritual battle, an Info Wars at the tip of the spear fighting it. Again, I don't
[17:59.240 --> 18:03.320]  like to lecture people I'm a very private person, but because of the globalists, their attack on
[18:03.320 --> 18:08.360]  humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure, and we've given the globalists
[18:08.360 --> 18:13.400]  one hell of a run for their money because of God, and I know some of our listeners get mad when I
[18:13.400 --> 18:17.240]  talk about God all day, but just give me a break. The Satanism's out in the open. I've always been
[18:17.240 --> 18:22.280]  a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear, and I get it.
[18:22.280 --> 18:26.120]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches, a lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt
[18:27.000 --> 18:32.200]  priest class system, and I get it, me too, believe me, I'm one of them, but it's that relationship
[18:32.200 --> 18:39.560]  with God and just God's universe that God created that is so essential, and God created the universe
[18:39.560 --> 18:43.640]  for us to have communion with God through and to have life, and so that's what Info Wars is
[18:43.640 --> 18:47.400]  really all about. So thank you all for your word of mouth. Thank you for spreading the word about
[18:47.400 --> 18:52.120]  Info Wars, and thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting infowarstore.com,
[18:52.120 --> 18:56.040]  because without your daily and weekly monthly purchases, we'll be taken off the air. So thank
[18:56.040 --> 19:13.960]  you for the support, infowarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[19:13.960 --> 19:27.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live on the Alex Jones show, and you know, it's just incredible
[19:27.880 --> 19:32.920]  to be witnessing this history, and now to even be a part of it, Info Wars breaking the news again
[19:32.920 --> 19:36.840]  at the southern border that nobody else will touch. We went down there last time, we exposed
[19:36.840 --> 19:41.800]  child sex trafficking happening. It showed you how the gang members, the cartel members,
[19:41.800 --> 19:45.880]  are there running the facilities. We showed you how the Biden administration is funding all of it,
[19:45.880 --> 19:51.800]  how their policy is completing the process using border patrol, and we go down there again, and
[19:51.800 --> 19:58.920]  it's worse than we've ever seen, and that is saying a lot. And so this is just one side of the coin
[19:58.920 --> 20:03.080]  of tyranny to collapse the West that we are witnessing right now. We're going to have more
[20:03.080 --> 20:08.840]  coming up later on the Alex Jones show of the total process being used to subvert the United
[20:08.840 --> 20:13.640]  States of America into a third world nation of tyranny. And Alex Jones is on the phone with us
[20:13.640 --> 20:18.360]  right now just trying to, in a short 10 minute segment, explain everything that he's witnessed
[20:18.360 --> 20:23.240]  down at the border since his arrival last night. So Alex, pick it up where you left off.
[20:24.200 --> 20:29.000]  Okay, now I'm going to hand the phone over to Tim Enlow, who's been basically, you know,
[20:29.000 --> 20:35.000]  law enforcement, federal army, Marines, Blackwater, you name it, and he's also been deployed to the
[20:35.000 --> 20:39.000]  border before when he was in the military. So he can really speak to this at an even better level
[20:39.000 --> 20:46.200]  than I can, but let me be very clear about this when I say these things. This is illegal under
[20:46.200 --> 20:52.040]  international under federal under state law. He does a giant organized crime operation and Biden
[20:52.040 --> 20:57.320]  is exercising his criminal will just like he did still in the election doing this. They still have
[20:57.320 --> 21:01.400]  a waiver that the Justice Department put in, which they don't have the power to do under law.
[21:01.400 --> 21:07.400]  The Justice Department now makes law like the judges do saying four months ago that
[21:07.400 --> 21:11.800]  the people transporting these children and women do not have to have a criminal background check.
[21:12.600 --> 21:17.880]  We witnessed prison bushes with women and children in cages
[21:20.280 --> 21:27.640]  being loaded into an alleyway in the little like a dungeon door with armed private security. We
[21:27.640 --> 21:32.840]  confronted the armed security politely but forcefully and said, what is your authority to
[21:32.840 --> 21:37.960]  be transporting people in these Border Patrol vehicles with guns? Who are you? They were wearing
[21:37.960 --> 21:44.280]  masks, of course, and they said, we are emergency security. Then I said, you're not allowed to
[21:44.280 --> 21:48.440]  do this. And so then we made them sit there 20 minutes until the Border Patrol showed up and
[21:48.440 --> 21:52.760]  then they transported them in and would not say who they were. And again, the mask was a symbol
[21:52.760 --> 21:58.600]  of this criminal takeover. And then I saw unaccompanied blonde-haired blue-eyed children, not one but three.
[22:00.360 --> 22:05.400]  And they're walking right by me and then I turn to Donning and they walk right around the corner
[22:05.400 --> 22:09.000]  of a little fence in front of the Catholic Charity with armed men. They walk over and they
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.440]  go, I want my mama and I was like standing about eight feet away over the fence and my mouth was
[22:14.440 --> 22:19.400]  hanging open. And see when you're hit with something this criminal, it's like, and then
[22:19.400 --> 22:23.720]  everybody's going along with it. It's like Nazi Germany or the Aztec Sacrificing Children.
[22:23.720 --> 22:28.200]  What do you do? Or Jeffrey Dahmer, he learns eating his neighbors or whatever and he's
[22:28.200 --> 22:33.080]  got them in 50 gallon drums. Everybody's just standing around like it's normal. I start going,
[22:33.080 --> 22:39.160]  call 911, call 911, and my crew goes, they're not going to do anything. And so I almost ran
[22:39.160 --> 22:43.880]  through the door and just because, I mean, I know, I'll grab the kid, they're kidnapped, they're here,
[22:43.880 --> 22:48.200]  we must force this. I mean, there are kidnapped children, ladies and gentlemen. The Senate report
[22:48.200 --> 22:54.200]  confirms it's happening at a massive scale. Literally, because if I saw wonderful little
[22:54.200 --> 22:59.080]  brown children sitting there going, I want my mama, I want my mama, that freaked us out before.
[22:59.080 --> 23:04.520]  This is blonde-haired blue-eyed kids barefoot. You know, the CIA got caught in the Finder's case
[23:04.520 --> 23:09.960]  back in the 80s. Ted Gunterson and the FBI, they were better exposed as a CIA vehicle with barefoot
[23:09.960 --> 23:14.520]  little kids kidnapped in a van in Florida. And that brought down the whole CIA base in D.C.,
[23:14.520 --> 23:19.000]  where they had kidnapped kids making stunt films and rape films. That all came out in the newspaper,
[23:19.000 --> 23:24.200]  folks. This is real. But up the Finder's case, so I'm telling you, I'm telling you, this is all
[23:24.200 --> 23:29.480]  naked. It is out in the dam open. I, this just crossed the line with me. I'm not putting up with
[23:29.480 --> 23:34.840]  this. I'm not going along with this. And we are becoming a narco terrorist country. And there
[23:34.840 --> 23:38.440]  are massive amounts of European tourists and others having their kids kidnapped in Central
[23:38.440 --> 23:46.040]  America. And a lot of kids get kidnapped whenever my uncle was in Guatemala. My cousin got kidnapped
[23:46.040 --> 23:51.160]  back in the 1980s for about three days. They had to pay a ransom. So it's very common in Guatemala.
[23:51.160 --> 23:55.880]  And these are Central American children. I am witnessing kidnapped children. The government
[23:55.880 --> 23:59.240]  is pure damn evil. Tim Enlow, give people a little bit of a briefing here. We'll go to break
[23:59.240 --> 24:02.360]  and come back with you. I want to show your hosting and I'll show you the McKellen border
[24:02.360 --> 24:08.600]  while Trump is about to land. Everybody's waving Trump flags. Imagine they all came to McKellen.
[24:08.600 --> 24:14.680]  Yeah. So, Owen, as you recall, when we were down here, we documented extensively how the
[24:14.680 --> 24:19.880]  border patrol was dropping these illegals off at the COVID testing center in downtown McKellen.
[24:19.880 --> 24:25.320]  Well, they've done away with that for tents now. That all those tents have been taking down.
[24:25.320 --> 24:31.400]  And the buses now literally directly roll up the border patrol buses that will directly roll up
[24:31.400 --> 24:38.600]  to Catholic Charities, RGV, and dozens upon dozens of illegals just pour out and are taken into that
[24:38.600 --> 24:44.360]  center. So, Tim, let me ask you then, what is the release policy? Because we know they were using
[24:44.360 --> 24:49.000]  that testing facility as kind of the soft release facility, like, oh, that's processing. And then,
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.200]  once you're out, you're released. Are they just considered release now once they get taken to
[24:54.200 --> 24:59.720]  the facility? Right. So as soon as they pull up, and that's why that's an interesting point.
[24:59.720 --> 25:05.880]  So that is why they have now switched. If you recall, Owen, so before the border patrol personnel
[25:05.880 --> 25:13.000]  were the ones driving the buses up to the COVID testing site, now the border patrol already releases
[25:13.000 --> 25:19.320]  them at the detention center and turns responsibility over them to private guards. And now it's
[25:19.320 --> 25:24.760]  private guards wearing bandanas over their faces that are driving these buses into downtown
[25:24.760 --> 25:29.960]  McAllen. And then they're pulling up in front of the Catholic Charities, RGV, and they're just
[25:29.960 --> 25:35.240]  letting the people out there. So when we started filming, they became so worried that they refused
[25:35.240 --> 25:40.600]  to open the buses up and let the illegals out. And they actually called border patrol to come
[25:40.600 --> 25:46.600]  assist the private guards in helping get the illegals off the bus and hurry them into the
[25:46.600 --> 25:51.400]  Catholic Charities building. And we're witnessing all of this, folks. You're seeing some of the
[25:51.400 --> 25:55.560]  footage. There's just some of the footage that we've gotten from the crew. They're still sending
[25:55.560 --> 26:01.000]  us more. So I guess that means that as soon as you get released from that facility, you're
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.240]  basically free. I mean, they don't have to go with that private security, right? They can just walk
[26:05.240 --> 26:08.520]  down the road. We'll come back to Enlo, Owen. We're going to rock another side. But this is the
[26:08.520 --> 26:13.960]  key to this. It's 10 times the magnitude it was before. And as fast as they go in, they come back
[26:13.960 --> 26:19.720]  out and then get on the city buses to go God knows where. Back to Tim. Right. And that's exactly
[26:19.720 --> 26:24.280]  right, Owen. So they're free to go as soon as they step off that bus. They are free. And then
[26:24.280 --> 26:28.680]  after that, as we know, the Catholic Charities, then get them plane tickets to fly them throughout
[26:28.680 --> 26:34.840]  the United States. And, you know, it's the amount of buses. We were there 20 minutes and buses were
[26:34.840 --> 26:41.000]  just coming nonstop. In fact, one bus had to wait on 15th Street before he could turn because
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.400]  another bus was already blocking the entrance in front of the Catholic Charities, RGV.
[26:45.400 --> 26:51.240]  And if you remember when we were down here, Owen, they've now annexed the building across
[26:51.240 --> 26:56.600]  the street, the one with the Hollywood sign on it. Catholic Charities has now opened that up.
[26:56.600 --> 27:03.000]  So our reporting on that was also accurate. It's absolutely 100% accurate. And we now today have
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.120]  footage of them going into both buildings simultaneously. So one bus will put up, one
[27:08.120 --> 27:12.360]  group will go into the building marked Hollywood. The other bus will put up and they'll go into
[27:12.360 --> 27:17.080]  the original RGV building. Now, see, that just proves chicanery because we specifically asked
[27:17.080 --> 27:20.680]  after doing our own independent investigation, hey, when are you going to launch this new
[27:20.680 --> 27:24.120]  facility? They said, no, no, no, no, that's not our building. We're not doing that. Turns out
[27:24.120 --> 27:28.360]  they lied about that too, huh? They absolutely lied about that. They now have armed guards in
[27:28.360 --> 27:34.200]  front of that building and up to seven to eight security personnel are now walking with the
[27:34.200 --> 27:40.280]  illegals to put them in the vans to transport them to the airport. And all their t-shirts said
[27:40.280 --> 27:45.160]  emergency response team. Yeah, we've got this video. This is incredible. We're going to be right
[27:45.160 --> 27:49.400]  back with Alex Jones and the crew. But folks, let me just say, I mean, they are running,
[27:49.400 --> 27:53.640]  they are openly running human smuggling operations at the southern border right now.
[27:53.640 --> 27:57.240]  And they're also running eugenics programs with these vaccines right now. I mean, this is incredible
[27:57.240 --> 28:07.080]  stuff. As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.

[30:57.320 --> 31:23.480]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones show, Owen Schroyer at the Info Wars World Headquarters
[31:23.480 --> 31:30.120]  in Austin, Texas. Alex Jones and crew about five and a half hours south in McAllen, Texas
[31:30.120 --> 31:34.680]  at the southern border. No, not where Kamala Harris went for a photo shoot, where there's no
[31:34.680 --> 31:40.920]  smuggling going on. No, where the actual human trafficking operation is going on. Honestly,
[31:40.920 --> 31:45.560]  folks, this is so epic. It's so over the top. It's so beyond our pay grade, but nobody else wants
[31:45.560 --> 31:50.680]  to do this. So it has to be Info Wars. And that's why you're supported InfoWarsStore.com is so key.
[31:50.680 --> 31:57.160]  And Alex Jones and crew rejoin us there from the border. I'm honestly overwhelmed and I
[31:57.160 --> 32:02.120]  witnessed this myself, guys, but I can't even imagine what you're going through where we're
[32:02.120 --> 32:06.120]  just we're already dizzy and spinning over here with the vaccines killing everybody.
[32:06.120 --> 32:09.800]  And then it's like, okay, hey, let's go focus again on this issue. And it's just, oh, yeah,
[32:09.800 --> 32:14.040]  they're trafficking hundreds of children across the border every day with now private security,
[32:14.040 --> 32:18.440]  masked men, it's all totally illegal. These kids will have them probably end up in a sex trafficking
[32:18.440 --> 32:23.160]  ring. And it's just like, oh, yeah, the Border Patrol just facilitates it. So I can't even believe
[32:23.160 --> 32:26.040]  that this is happening. I can't imagine how overwhelmed you guys are right now.
[32:27.080 --> 32:32.520]  Perfectly said, Owen, because because you have to understand, we would come down here before and see
[32:32.520 --> 32:37.000]  a bus. And of course, there's hundreds of sites like this across the Texas border. We'd see a bus
[32:37.000 --> 32:43.720]  every hour, see a van every 30 minutes. This is three, four buses at one time. Buses constantly
[32:43.720 --> 32:50.360]  vans everywhere on assembly line where there's a shot on the video. It's almost uploaded to you.
[32:50.360 --> 32:53.480]  We were able to send you the first half, but it's the second half. It's really powerful.
[32:54.120 --> 32:59.560]  But the uploads fell the few times. So next hour, it's really the second half because it's
[32:59.560 --> 33:05.000]  all unedited. We get out of the car immediately. There's smuggling kids out of the building into
[33:05.000 --> 33:11.240]  vans without safety seats. It says emergency response with special weird federal tags on
[33:11.240 --> 33:16.200]  the cars. It's all these goon guys with mask on and guns bugging their eyes out at us in like
[33:16.200 --> 33:21.720]  fake looking security guard outfits. And then these are definitely Central Americans being loaded in.
[33:21.720 --> 33:26.120]  And then you see unaccompanied children that are just by themselves looking around for their mommy.
[33:26.680 --> 33:31.960]  And then, and then boom, another van, boom, another bus. And then all of a sudden the door opens up
[33:31.960 --> 33:35.880]  and you see people discordant. And then you look down the block and you see vans because we were
[33:35.880 --> 33:40.120]  told we were here months ago that they had just leased seven buildings, not just the big Hollywood
[33:40.120 --> 33:45.720]  building across the street. That's just as big as the original Catholic charity, but seven buildings.
[33:45.720 --> 33:49.640]  I'm going to talk to locals. We're going to investigate today and find out more. But
[33:51.560 --> 33:59.480]  imagine one spot, one corner, 15th and Austin, McAllen, Texas. And this is what we saw in 42
[33:59.480 --> 34:03.160]  minutes. So I know next hour you're going to be able to play some of that raw footage for people
[34:03.160 --> 34:08.200]  and show it. I know we're showing some of the b-roll now, but you said it. The UN said in the
[34:08.200 --> 34:13.640]  documents that Lou Dobbs, a judicial watch got 15 years ago, 14 years ago to my film Endgame,
[34:15.160 --> 34:20.200]  that the plan was to use a virus to bring in global government and to bring collapsing borders
[34:20.200 --> 34:24.600]  and collapsing third world to bring down the first world and bring in world government.
[34:24.600 --> 34:29.960]  They do the great lockdown. They do the great reset. That stars the third world to death. The
[34:29.960 --> 34:36.360]  UN organizes them as armies to then completely break our borders and then break our social
[34:36.360 --> 34:41.480]  safety net. And then the UN admits this is their clowered and pivot strategy. This is an exact
[34:41.480 --> 34:47.960]  strategy and Congress sits there dumb debating who really broke the border. Why is there a surge
[34:47.960 --> 34:53.640]  when Biden said, as soon as I get elected, but she knew he was going to be selected. He said,
[34:53.640 --> 34:59.080]  I want you to immediately surge the border. And then now they've surged and Kamala doesn't need
[34:59.080 --> 35:03.560]  to come see the border because they're doing the great job. And man, you see these creepy women with
[35:03.560 --> 35:10.760]  devil tattoos and the saint of death tattoos ushering these children in. Again, we have videos
[35:10.760 --> 35:13.400]  at multiple airports because they have a private one and then they have the public one.
[35:14.680 --> 35:19.880]  And they bring babies and the same woman with these, with these grim reaper cat tattoos,
[35:19.880 --> 35:26.040]  this is my baby, you take it now. And they go, okay, no checkpoint, no records, no nothing,
[35:26.040 --> 35:34.600]  hand it off to charities. And then we saw today, like 20 waspy looking blonde haired blue-eyed,
[35:34.600 --> 35:39.880]  you know, trendy college kids getting off a bus and going into one of the Catholic charities.
[35:39.880 --> 35:44.040]  Again, because that's part of their college thing is to help organize this. You have NASA
[35:44.040 --> 35:49.640]  saying to employees, take people in. You have the Democrats taking people in. And then what,
[35:49.640 --> 35:54.840]  what they do is they then farm these illegals whose identities they control. They put them to work
[35:54.840 --> 35:58.920]  in sweatshops. They put them to work in restaurants. They put them into work in, in, in, in different
[35:58.920 --> 36:03.880]  facilities. And then they sign them up and control them through lawyers and skim the money off the
[36:03.880 --> 36:08.840]  top, just like they do with the homeless. That's why they invite the homeless in. Society collapses
[36:08.840 --> 36:12.840]  that they get billions of dollars for major city for the homeless. That's all skimmed off the top
[36:12.840 --> 36:19.160]  to the left. The left farm homeless and illegal aliens as a permanent underclass using America's
[36:19.160 --> 36:25.480]  welfare system to bring them in and then implode the country in the end. So listen, listeners, you
[36:25.480 --> 36:29.560]  gotta understand it's a pincer attack with the virus, with the lockdowns, with the killing,
[36:29.560 --> 36:34.520]  with the killing of the old people and bringing in these third world poor slaves that will put
[36:34.520 --> 36:40.280]  up with anything and, and, and, and do anything. This is economic war. This is an attack on the
[36:40.280 --> 36:47.960]  country. And I cannot keep this broadcast on air without your support. I cannot do this without
[36:47.960 --> 36:52.520]  people realizing that your word of mouth to take these articles and to take these videos from Bandai
[36:52.520 --> 36:56.280]  video and share them. And I know you're doing it. We've all got to work harder and we've got to push
[36:56.280 --> 37:01.080]  harder and we've got the Fourth of July special going right now. That's going to have to end
[37:01.080 --> 37:06.440]  after Fourth of July free shipping double patriot points. We need the funds. We don't have the big
[37:06.440 --> 37:11.960]  sponsors. We don't have that. We only have you listeners. These children only have you and no
[37:11.960 --> 37:19.320]  one else is doing this. So please go to infowarstore.com today. We have 60% off on x3. I got a big
[37:19.320 --> 37:23.880]  shipment of that in the highest quality tri iodine, deep earth crystal iodine and two other types.
[37:23.880 --> 37:27.960]  So many people are deficient in it. So many people have low libido and stamina and energy
[37:27.960 --> 37:34.600]  because of that. And just take my iodine challenge. See it for yourself. Take it for a month and,
[37:34.600 --> 37:39.240]  and if you don't feel more energy of your skin, it's an healthier. If it doesn't do amazing
[37:39.240 --> 37:45.160]  things for you, I'll eat my hat. But if this price is 60% off, there is no way you can beat
[37:45.160 --> 37:51.640]  this deal. $16. We barely make any money per container of it, but I believe you're going to
[37:51.640 --> 37:56.760]  love it so much. You're going to reorder in the future. So please go to infowarstore.com.
[37:56.760 --> 38:01.960]  We have free shipping through Sunday double patriot points and we have a bunch of other
[38:01.960 --> 38:06.760]  products back in like pollen block. We have other great products like prostagard. We have
[38:06.760 --> 38:11.160]  other great products like super melts for female vitality back in stock. So many of our other
[38:11.160 --> 38:17.000]  best sellers were unable to even get in because of the supply chain breakdown that the globalist
[38:17.000 --> 38:22.040]  hit us with. It's the lockdown killing people and bankrupting people, not COVID-19. So again,
[38:22.040 --> 38:26.360]  listeners, fundraising drive here. And if you really want to help us go right to the front page
[38:26.360 --> 38:32.680]  of infowarstore.com where it says sponsor us give and you can give right there $5, $10, $50,
[38:32.680 --> 38:39.400]  $100 one-time gift or sign up for auto gift of $5, $10, whatever and just do it because no one
[38:39.400 --> 38:45.560]  else is fighting this hard. No one else is doing this and I am doing whatever it takes to get
[38:45.560 --> 38:49.960]  this information out and to expand what we're doing. And I believe that we need to have reporters
[38:49.960 --> 38:55.800]  down here several days out of the week basically reporting on what's happening and exposing it.
[38:55.800 --> 38:59.400]  And I'll just tell you a point blank. I've hired a couple of reporters. They'll be here soon.
[38:59.400 --> 39:05.160]  We're beefing up what we're doing. We are expanding everything right now in this fight,
[39:05.160 --> 39:09.400]  despite the fact that long-term we don't have the funds to continue on at this point because we
[39:09.400 --> 39:15.160]  realize this is the main assault on the United States of America. This is the globalist attack
[39:15.160 --> 39:21.320]  and this is the time for us to put our full energy in to this struggle. We can't wait any longer.
[39:21.320 --> 39:26.680]  And we're going to break here in just a few minutes. They say they're 80% uploaded on the raw
[39:26.680 --> 39:30.920]  footage that they're going to be playing a large excerpts of next hour that Owen's going to be
[39:30.920 --> 39:35.480]  narrating over. But I wanted to do two minutes to break. Just tell you, Tim Enlow, come over here
[39:35.480 --> 39:38.360]  and make any other points you want to make her. Perhaps we should do it on the other side, but
[39:38.360 --> 39:43.480]  there's just, we are witnessing the collapse and the takeover of the country. So, Owen, you take
[39:43.480 --> 39:47.960]  us to break and we'll get some final comments from Tim Enlow. But again, when you see the escalation
[39:48.680 --> 39:54.120]  from already wide open border and at one corner in one little town, thousands of people a day being
[39:54.120 --> 39:58.120]  trafficked and children without their parents, some of these children looking for their mommy and
[39:58.120 --> 40:02.200]  you're witnessing the crime and the Senate report admits that tens of thousands of children were
[40:02.200 --> 40:06.520]  sex-travelling to give it to people that weren't their parents by Obama purposely. And you realize
[40:06.520 --> 40:10.520]  we are complicit if we let this happen. So, I'd love it if the tens of thousands here to see
[40:10.520 --> 40:15.000]  Trump would actually start actually coming and videotaping and exposing and putting it on Facebook
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.680]  and YouTube and Twitter because I don't have accounts there, but you do have accounts there.
[40:18.680 --> 40:22.520]  Damn it. And so, only place we have is banned on video. And the only way we get out of this
[40:22.520 --> 40:26.440]  cage is you sharing the videos from banned on video. And that's why you're so damn important
[40:26.440 --> 40:30.440]  listeners because we cannot let these children be abused. We cannot let this criminal precedent be
[40:30.440 --> 40:36.920]  set of abiding to be a damn dictator who could do whatever he wants. And that evil general Milley
[40:36.920 --> 40:40.680]  saying that America's the enemy and the main threat's right-wingers. So, the main threat is
[40:40.680 --> 40:44.280]  criminals like them that know they're conquering this country right now. We know what they've done.
[40:44.920 --> 40:50.040]  All right. When we come back, we'll be hearing more from Alex Jones. And I want to get his take
[40:50.040 --> 40:53.720]  on this because this isn't blaming Trump, but it's like Trump is now a distraction like an angler
[40:53.720 --> 40:57.880]  fish that they can run all these things while we're distracted by the light. Three of our best
[40:57.880 --> 41:03.240]  selling products are now back in stock after months and months of not being available because
[41:03.240 --> 41:08.600]  of the COVID lockdowns that destroy the supply chain. Biotruce selenium is the highest quality

[42:01.400 --> 42:07.000]  but free humanity has to have its revolution. We have to first recognize this anti-human
[42:07.960 --> 42:15.160]  takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us
[42:15.160 --> 42:24.280]  into these artificial corporate controlled slaves. Orson slaves are just just property
[42:24.280 --> 42:31.480]  from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual
[42:31.480 --> 42:37.400]  of dominance and satanic control. We have to recognize the great reset post industrial world
[42:38.040 --> 42:41.000]  which realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.680]  that is the opposite of their dystopia. It's that choice. It's that realization that's going to
[42:46.680 --> 42:51.960]  change the world and it's the only choice we've got. Freedom or slavery go to evil.
[42:52.840 --> 42:56.040]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.

[44:58.680 --> 45:03.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:16.040 --> 45:21.880]  This is one of those epic broadcasts that you're going to remember for the rest of your life and
[45:22.440 --> 45:26.600]  we've got Alex Jones and crew with us down in McAllen, Owen Schreuer here in the Info Wars World
[45:26.600 --> 45:32.840]  Headquarters in Austin, Texas and so Alex makes such a great point and I know they want to kind
[45:32.840 --> 45:37.160]  of expand on this and just with the human smuggling that they're witnessing there as they're
[45:37.160 --> 45:42.280]  reflecting on everything that they saw today and what we've seen in the past being down in
[45:42.280 --> 45:48.360]  McAllen at this child trafficking center but like you were saying Alex and I'm getting all these
[45:48.360 --> 45:53.960]  messages oh Trump's here and thousands of people are out there waving flags and so it's it we've
[45:53.960 --> 45:59.320]  reached this weird point and again I'm not blaming Trump for this but it's like Trump is now just a
[45:59.320 --> 46:04.920]  distraction a shiny object and everybody's paying attention to what Trump's doing what he's thinking
[46:04.920 --> 46:10.520]  oh my gosh meanwhile the vaccines are killing people we have human smuggling child smuggling
[46:10.520 --> 46:14.920]  happening at the southern border all the other crimes that the biden family and the biden
[46:14.920 --> 46:20.120]  administration is up to and we can't even get over this this weird hard on for Trump as the
[46:20.120 --> 46:24.360]  election got stolen from him and and and now he's sitting down in Florida as it all goes out so I
[46:24.360 --> 46:30.680]  mean again I'm not blaming Trump but at what point do we say hey it's time to let Trump do his own
[46:30.680 --> 46:35.880]  thing whatever he's going to do that's irrelevant to us now we still got to save this country Trump
[46:35.880 --> 46:40.680]  can make his own decision of his involvement but this is the perfect analogy I think right here
[46:40.680 --> 46:45.240]  where you have thousands of people over here ready to see Trump where they should be down in
[46:45.240 --> 46:52.520]  mctown trying to stop this human smuggling operation from going down he helps get good
[46:52.520 --> 46:57.480]  republicans elected he's awesome the republican establishment wants to get rid of him 100% you
[46:57.480 --> 47:03.000]  know back from trying to energize the republican party the issue is the tired old go to the dps
[47:03.000 --> 47:07.240]  headquarters sit around the table talk about you know what they're going to do talk about the
[47:07.240 --> 47:13.560]  smuggling that's good that puts a band-aid on it but this is a hatchet wound or a 12-gauge
[47:13.560 --> 47:19.960]  shotgun hole this is a we need a tourniquet we need emergency surgery the escalation of this the
[47:19.960 --> 47:26.200]  fuggishness of these private security goons wearing masks making threatening statements to us women
[47:26.200 --> 47:32.360]  in prison bus cages children unaccompanied this is a massive crime and and since nothing was done
[47:32.360 --> 47:36.600]  by congress and nothing was done by the courts in the last six months since biden stole the election
[47:36.600 --> 47:40.680]  when we were here four or five months ago and two months ago it was bad it is escalated off
[47:40.680 --> 47:46.920]  the freaking chart there are folks this looks like people coming into disney world there's so many
[47:46.920 --> 47:53.160]  this is one spot in one place completely illegal and it's all part of the illegal takeover all
[47:53.160 --> 47:57.400]  part of the medical tyranny they want us to have internal checkpoints to go to the mall
[47:57.400 --> 48:02.920]  or or go to the store with a medical ID a vaccine passport to go to college but oh the
[48:02.920 --> 48:07.320]  borders wide open and the colleges have been turned into engines of leftist activity where
[48:07.320 --> 48:12.200]  again the leftists are bringing in third world populations sent here because of the covid lockdown
[48:12.200 --> 48:18.520]  who they now farm we like a chiapet or something they keep in their room i mean this is unbelievable
[48:18.520 --> 48:23.880]  and i know tim enlo has got a lot to add about this because we're not exaggerating he's been in
[48:23.880 --> 48:29.320]  law enforcement you know for a long time he's a good old buzzard and he can tell you all the
[48:29.320 --> 48:35.400]  different things from his perspective that are going on because we're not exaggerating this is
[48:35.400 --> 48:41.160]  this is something out of a nightmare science fiction movie and it's going on right now and
[48:41.160 --> 48:47.080]  what's scary is where is fox news where is i mean i know oan's had some reporters here newsmax has
[48:47.080 --> 48:52.120]  great but i don't see anything as hardcore as we got every time we step out of the damn suv it's
[48:52.120 --> 48:57.480]  it's like there's video this 40 minute video that's now been sent to you where i'm literally sitting
[48:57.480 --> 49:01.000]  there and i see the kids being smuggled without their parents and i go what the hell's this call
[49:01.000 --> 49:05.640]  911 and then more buses and more cars there's a shot where there's buses and all and all the
[49:05.640 --> 49:11.800]  four-way stops uh buses and fans so many of them that it's like there's people everywhere crossing
[49:11.800 --> 49:17.720]  with freaks everywhere it's like a freaking ant hill man this and so when you hear that it's 500
[49:17.720 --> 49:22.040]  thousand have come across it's kamala got in this one border sector found almost that many
[49:23.080 --> 49:28.760]  tim enlo give people a quick summation of what you witness today right you know and and i'd like
[49:28.760 --> 49:33.000]  to i'd like to key off what you said oh and and and what alex said and that is you know
[49:33.000 --> 49:39.480]  trump coming in and abit coming in we we know while both of them have their good points this is
[49:39.480 --> 49:44.600]  just smoking mirrors it's just a photo op for attention that says you know and and the part
[49:44.600 --> 49:49.480]  of that is good because we need attention focused on this issue but literally while they're walking
[49:49.480 --> 49:54.520]  around getting their pictures taken there are thousands of illegals being dropped off in downtown
[49:54.520 --> 49:59.960]  mcgallon and all the americans are at the rally waving flags and waving trump banners which is
[49:59.960 --> 50:04.760]  doing nothing what we need them to do is be in front of the catholic charities rgv building
[50:04.760 --> 50:09.560]  and sit there in protest and say you're not bringing these illegals in here right that that's
[50:09.560 --> 50:14.920]  really what we need we need americans to get involved to sit there and videotape and expose
[50:14.920 --> 50:20.440]  this just as we are doing right now and if you remember last time we were doing down here oh and
[50:20.440 --> 50:25.560]  they called the police on us several times well they did so again today and it's really frustrating
[50:25.560 --> 50:31.560]  as a former law enforcement officer because mcgallon police comes out they talk to us and i'm trying
[50:31.560 --> 50:36.280]  to explain to them how they're they're stuffing these illegal kids in the taxi cabs right in front
[50:36.280 --> 50:42.760]  of us five minutes before mcgallon police showed up today without car seats and the mcgallon police
[50:42.760 --> 50:47.960]  officer's response was well we're here for you because we heard you were blocking traffic
[50:47.960 --> 50:53.480]  we're not blocking traffic we're trying to prevent them from stuffing kids into cars without car
[50:53.480 --> 50:58.680]  seats and then taking them to god knows where and you know the officer's like well i don't
[50:58.680 --> 51:03.080]  understand why you're raising your voice well we're raising our voices because we're upset about
[51:03.080 --> 51:08.520]  what's happening in our country we're upset about children being smuggled and being transported
[51:08.520 --> 51:14.280]  illegally we're upset about that and uh you know they're like well call us next time you see it
[51:14.280 --> 51:19.400]  well we've been calling since april they've known about this is another question what's coming next
[51:19.400 --> 51:25.240]  if we keep putting up with this level what's the next level of abuse and so the scale of this is
[51:25.240 --> 51:31.720]  just right now it's unfathomable it's unbelievable what we're seeing down here and we need on if you
[51:31.720 --> 51:37.880]  can encourage americans come down to the border bring your cameras bring your videos bring your
[51:37.880 --> 51:43.880]  phones and expose this help us expose what's going on because the administrative the administration
[51:43.880 --> 51:50.520]  narrative is oh there's no crisis nothing's going on and one day in mcallin texas and you'll know the
[51:50.520 --> 51:55.720]  scale of this crisis and there are great patriots down there in mcallin but they're not enough
[51:55.720 --> 52:00.200]  ladies and gentlemen the true texas patriots group down there that that i've been in contact with i
[52:00.200 --> 52:04.200]  mean they they just it's just a small group of people down there and that's what's so frustrating
[52:04.200 --> 52:09.320]  it's like hey look info wars is banned everywhere man all of our reporters alex jones you can't
[52:09.320 --> 52:14.360]  even share our links it's like hey why don't other people with massive followings that aren't
[52:14.360 --> 52:18.520]  censored make a big deal out of this hey that's great trump you're down there and well that's
[52:18.520 --> 52:23.000]  what we're doing now and and i've got an idea i've got bullhorns i didn't bring up the armored
[52:23.000 --> 52:27.000]  vehicle that's a giant bullhorn but i'm next time trump comes down here i'm gonna go to this event
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.200]  to tell everybody hey great when you're done listen to trump let me come show you the actual human
[52:30.200 --> 52:35.640]  smuggling let's go protest this let's camp out let's basically shut it down by exposing it and so
[52:35.640 --> 52:39.240]  i'm going to go to actually the trumps rally today and i'm going to tell people in the bullhorn hey
[52:39.240 --> 52:43.800]  when you're done seeing trump speed and everything that's great we're going to go back down to the
[52:43.800 --> 52:50.680]  corner of 15th and austin in downtown mcallin people got to see this for themselves oh and it's
[52:50.680 --> 52:58.600]  insane yeah and of course we've been witnessing this for months now and like you said where is
[52:58.600 --> 53:04.200]  the other news i mean like for any news reporter this is the number one story why would you not
[53:04.200 --> 53:10.200]  be covering this quite frankly it's the easiest thing you sit on the corner and just hit record
[53:10.200 --> 53:15.080]  that's all you have to do understand last time you were here i know zack got really upset because
[53:15.080 --> 53:19.480]  he saw little kids his panic kids or well mama mama by themselves it's clear when a kid's by
[53:19.480 --> 53:23.960]  themselves okay you can kind of go okay maybe their mom's somewhere else or whatever no obviously
[53:23.960 --> 53:27.080]  they've been kidnapped and grabbed it's been confirmed that a percentage of them have been
[53:27.080 --> 53:31.800]  kidnapped and used as a way to get across the border because some of these are like full grown men
[53:31.800 --> 53:36.840]  with the kid but the kid doesn't like them and i understand the hispanics have a lot of anglo white
[53:36.840 --> 53:40.200]  background genetics or sometimes you know dark hispanic parents have a blonde hair blue like
[53:40.200 --> 53:45.160]  kid that's not what's going on today i saw blonde hair blue like kids with no shoes on walking up to
[53:45.160 --> 53:51.160]  the to the armed guards saying i want my mother i mean the kid had an anglo accident american
[53:51.160 --> 53:55.160]  accident there's a kidnapped kid it's a kidnapped kid with central america's i saw it with my own
[53:55.160 --> 53:59.240]  damn eyes i bet my right arm and of course we've seen the hispanic kids clearly been kidnapped as
[53:59.240 --> 54:04.680]  well they're not with their damn mothers most of them are with their mothers but i'm telling you
[54:04.680 --> 54:08.760]  remember they did genetic tests have found one third trump was doing it one third are not with
[54:08.760 --> 54:14.600]  their mothers they're not even with a kin person that's a fifth cousin one third are not that was
[54:14.600 --> 54:19.480]  that was when trump was clamping down one third are not with their biological parents or even
[54:19.480 --> 54:25.080]  their damn family so we know what's going on and i'm telling you we need to push for impeachment
[54:25.080 --> 54:29.800]  of biden for crimes against humanity human smuggling right now instead the dam has just
[54:29.800 --> 54:36.040]  broken this is so bold the crimes of the globalist the crimes of the democratic party the crimes of
[54:36.040 --> 54:41.480]  the republican leadership not doing anything mitch mcconnell i mean i've never i feel dirty and ashamed
[54:41.480 --> 54:45.560]  for the first time i want to be an american i do i feel ashamed right now i think i don't feel like
[54:45.560 --> 54:49.720]  i'm doing enough i i want to go down there right now in fact i don't feel good about myself once i
[54:49.720 --> 54:54.920]  go down there right now and save those kids i'm serious well that's the problem here alex and
[54:54.920 --> 54:59.480]  that's the that's the conclusion you reach when you just war game it out in your head is
[54:59.480 --> 55:03.560]  there's really only one option you want to stop this you're going to get arrested i mean that's it
[55:03.560 --> 55:07.960]  you try to stop this human smuggling operation you're going to get arrested and and why do people
[55:07.960 --> 55:14.200]  act so naive to this you've seen the stories florida los angeles dozens of kids in cages you
[55:14.200 --> 55:20.600]  see huffington post reporters arrested for sending out child porn where do you think they get the
[55:20.600 --> 55:26.280]  children to get raped on film folks those kids just don't appear out of nowhere they get smuggled
[55:26.280 --> 55:31.640]  into this country they're abusing these children we saw the creep come out we were here last time
[55:31.640 --> 55:36.920]  to go hey these women need to be know the lord did i will teach you the big tall white guy he goes
[55:36.920 --> 55:41.560]  i'm here to get him to work for me in pennsylvania and he was inside we had undercover police lady
[55:41.560 --> 55:45.080]  in there and that's why he ran out to confront her and he ran into our people all right we got a

[57:24.840 --> 57:54.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:54.840 --> 58:06.040]  All right, we're going to have a busy broadcast just like in the first hour.
[58:06.040 --> 58:09.240]  Quickly though, we go back to Alex Jones in McAllen, Texas.
[58:09.240 --> 58:10.540]  Just incredible footage.
[58:10.540 --> 58:12.360]  It's all going to be aired here on The Jones Show today.
[58:12.360 --> 58:14.760]  You can find it all at band.video.
[58:14.760 --> 58:18.960]  Alex again, just recapping the epicness of this human smuggling operation being run by
[58:18.960 --> 58:19.960]  the Biden administration.
[58:19.960 --> 58:26.760]  That's right, the key is to understand we get out of the car at like 9.30 AM in McAllen
[58:26.760 --> 58:31.120]  and we park one street over where there's, you know, pre-parking and as soon as we round
[58:31.120 --> 58:36.680]  the corner, there's like buses and vans and children and people going back and forth across
[58:36.680 --> 58:42.040]  the street with the little Manila envelopes, they can fly out to wherever they're going
[58:42.040 --> 58:43.440]  and it just begins to dawn on us.
[58:43.440 --> 58:47.760]  So we shot 42 minutes consecutively and that's what's crazy is we're not like cherry
[58:47.760 --> 58:48.760]  picking this.
[58:48.760 --> 58:53.040]  We shot 42 minutes consecutively that you're going to air large sections of next hour.
[58:53.040 --> 58:55.240]  It just got to the crew.
[58:55.240 --> 58:56.240]  They now have it.
[58:56.240 --> 58:57.240]  I know you got a big guest coming on.
[58:57.240 --> 58:58.240]  I don't want to pre-up that guest.
[58:58.240 --> 59:01.440]  This is just as important when you're about to cover the forced inoculations of the dangerous
[59:01.440 --> 59:04.760]  children and this medical doctor you've got on has testified to the Senate that's been
[59:04.760 --> 59:05.760]  censored.
[59:05.760 --> 59:09.080]  So folks, you definitely want to stay tuned for that because I cannot explain enough.
[59:09.080 --> 59:12.280]  I mean, I could slap myself in the face if I need to, folks.
[59:12.280 --> 59:13.880]  You're everything.
[59:13.880 --> 59:17.720]  You are the gunpowder in the realm that fires the bullet down the barrel.
[59:17.720 --> 59:19.320]  And you share these articles and videos.
[59:19.320 --> 59:23.400]  So this video, we haven't come up with a headline yet, but since I got off here, we have a headline
[59:23.400 --> 59:24.400]  for it.
[59:24.400 --> 59:28.600]  It's going to go live at Bandod video, but you can't share that link most places.
[59:28.600 --> 59:29.600]  It's blocks.
[59:29.600 --> 59:32.760]  You've got to share freeworldnews.tv.
[59:32.760 --> 59:34.280]  That's the new URL to share.
[59:34.280 --> 59:39.600]  And Sharon say, here is the explosive footage of the child trafficking.
[59:39.600 --> 59:44.560]  You will see children clearly saying, where's my mommy, blonde hair blew out children.
[59:44.560 --> 59:45.560]  You will see it all.
[59:45.560 --> 59:47.480]  I mean, this is just insane.
[59:47.480 --> 59:50.720]  It'd be like if you saw black kids, some go, oh, that's racist.
[59:50.720 --> 59:51.720]  I mean, why is it bad?
[59:51.720 --> 59:52.720]  They're blonde or blue?
[59:52.720 --> 59:56.680]  It'd be like if you saw black kids with white refugees, you'd say, where'd you get the
[59:56.680 --> 59:57.680]  black kid?
[59:57.680 --> 59:59.160]  I mean, it's, it's, it's incredible.
[59:59.160 --> 1:00:04.080]  You've got Central American, Guatemalan women with blonde haired blue-eyed children and
[1:00:04.080 --> 1:00:07.280]  you could say, oh, well, the father was, was a white guy.
[1:00:07.280 --> 1:00:08.720]  They weren't holding their hand.
[1:00:08.720 --> 1:00:13.080]  They were going up the security guard saying, I want to be with my parents.
[1:00:13.080 --> 1:00:14.200]  You could see it on tape.
[1:00:14.200 --> 1:00:15.600]  You know, children that are separate.
[1:00:15.600 --> 1:00:19.240]  Lots of children are with their parents holding their hand clean to them, but I'm literally
[1:00:19.240 --> 1:00:23.600]  seeing white kids that are by themselves.
[1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:24.600]  Here's the deal.
[1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:27.560]  Do I go to the Trump rally right now and like stand there and go, oh, Trump, great.
[1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:32.000]  You know, and Trump, there was a press conference or do I go back down to 15th and Austin in
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  McAllen?
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:36.040]  Or do I go out to the, where they keep these people under bridges?
[1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:40.960]  Or should I go show all the smuggling and the people swimming across and just all of that
[1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:42.560]  because that's what's happening.
[1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:44.440]  So again, I'll explain to listeners.
[1:00:44.440 --> 1:00:47.200]  There are less and less media outlets that are able to get the truth out.
[1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:49.040]  That's why info wars is more important than ever.
[1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:52.180]  And we have to stay on air and I have to have your support.
[1:00:52.180 --> 1:00:59.200]  So go to info wars.com and get one of our new free American t-shirts in Navy black or

[1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:35.280]  can only add for a day or two.

[1:02:34.080 --> 1:02:38.400]  We're having trouble getting enough money on the supplies we can even get to reorder
[1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:42.240]  the supplements and reorder the product to have it to sell in the future because I've
[1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:46.560]  eaten so much into our reserves that I'm getting to the point where I'm going to do a fundraiser

[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:13.560]  We're going to go right back to Alex before we bring the good doctor on to talk about
[1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:17.640]  these vaccines and all the side effects that the mainstream media is covering up and centering.
[1:04:17.640 --> 1:04:21.680]  Final comments from Alex down there at the border before he rejoins us later on.
[1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:22.680]  That's right folks.
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:25.280]  We're swinging for the fences here, they're imploding the borders, they're imploding
[1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:30.040]  our healthcare system, they're bringing in a planned collapse that's in the UN zone documents
[1:04:30.040 --> 1:04:33.920]  and we're so blessed to have this amazing crusading doctor who's about to take over
[1:04:33.920 --> 1:04:37.880]  and I just can't wait while we're driving back to go to the Trump rally to be able to
[1:04:37.880 --> 1:04:42.200]  listen to this great doctor thanks to all the supporters that keep info wars on the
[1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:43.200]  air.
[1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:45.400]  I just want to say we're going to have more live reports from the border today.
[1:04:45.400 --> 1:04:47.520]  I'll be on during the war room today.
[1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:49.400]  I'll be on towards the next hour.
[1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:52.520]  We're going to air that exclusive footage, the most shocking stuff you've ever seen
[1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:57.520]  next hour and just pray for us down here because this is a dangerous situation and this really
[1:04:57.520 --> 1:05:01.240]  has shaken me to my very, very core to see children clearly that have been kidnapped
[1:05:01.240 --> 1:05:06.520]  without parents crying for mommy, being led by armed men, being taken out of cages on
[1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:11.640]  buses into so-called Catholic charities that have taken over much of the downtown of McAllen.
[1:05:11.640 --> 1:05:15.720]  I mean, this is something out of a nightmare, fever dreams, something out of like get the
[1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:16.720]  clown.
[1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:19.480]  And so again, I'm going to turn this back over to Owen Troyer.
[1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:23.720]  Please share the live links folks from freeworldnews.tv.
[1:05:23.720 --> 1:05:28.080]  All of our guests are amazing people and it's critical to ask all our great guests to share
[1:05:28.080 --> 1:05:33.640]  the live feed to their people from freeworldnews.tv because that's how we override the sensors.
[1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:37.920]  Remember all these medical doctors and scientists and senators are being censored by Big Tech.
[1:05:37.920 --> 1:05:40.120]  Big Tech has been caught covering up where COVID came from.
[1:05:40.120 --> 1:05:42.120]  They've been caught covering up the treatments.
[1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:43.720]  They've committed crimes against humanity.
[1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:48.640]  We are facing a criminal assault back to Owen Troyer taking over the Alex Jones show.
[1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:49.840]  God bless you ladies and gentlemen.
[1:05:49.840 --> 1:05:53.000]  Please take the live link now and share it because what this doctor is about to say is
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:54.880]  beyond critical.
[1:05:54.880 --> 1:05:58.440]  And so we are now joined by Dr. Angelina Farella.
[1:05:58.440 --> 1:06:02.760]  I could go off of her list here of everything she's accomplished, but it's more important
[1:06:02.760 --> 1:06:04.480]  what she's doing now.
[1:06:04.480 --> 1:06:14.040]  For more information, ABT4, the number for kids.com or AFLDS.org for more information.
[1:06:14.040 --> 1:06:16.800]  And I've got stacks of news about the vaccine.
[1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:19.680]  We've covered all the numbers of the death from the vaccine.
[1:06:19.680 --> 1:06:25.520]  We showed you the powerful press conference that Ron Johnson had of all the children that
[1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:29.880]  have been negatively affected with the adverse reactions from this vaccine.
[1:06:29.880 --> 1:06:33.800]  And quite frankly, my only knock is that they don't go far enough because they always hedge.
[1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:37.520]  Oh, we're not against vaccines or oh, you know, we know some people.
[1:06:37.520 --> 1:06:41.840]  No, no, no, it's trying to be completely honest that this is a worldwide human experiment
[1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:45.560]  now being run on children that is killing tens of thousands of people.
[1:06:45.560 --> 1:06:51.280]  So Dr. Angelina Farella, where do you want to start off with this issue that we're seeing
[1:06:51.280 --> 1:06:54.640]  with the medical tyranny and the forced experimental vaccines?
[1:06:54.640 --> 1:06:57.360]  Well, thanks for having me today.
[1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:05.800]  And I'm really hopeful that the message really gets out broad and wide and loud and clear.
[1:07:05.800 --> 1:07:13.800]  The COVID vaccine is totally inappropriate for children under the age of 18.
[1:07:13.800 --> 1:07:22.640]  Totally inappropriate COVID does not affect children COVID actually, if they do get it,
[1:07:22.640 --> 1:07:31.240]  you know, it's a very mild disease in and their survivability is 99.997%.
[1:07:31.240 --> 1:07:36.640]  So you have to understand that the reason why I've come out so strongly against this
[1:07:36.640 --> 1:07:41.680]  is because when you're looking at risk and benefit that there really is no benefit for
[1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:48.320]  these children to get a vaccine for a disease process that they really don't get nor do
[1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:54.520]  they spread, we know from early on in the Chinese studies that the only time a child
[1:07:54.520 --> 1:08:00.400]  would really contract COVID was from their parent and it was actually quite rare.
[1:08:00.400 --> 1:08:06.400]  So children acted as a buffer and this is something that I when I read it and I understood
[1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:10.240]  it I was so happy to see it because I was thinking this is fantastic.
[1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:15.200]  The kids are the buffer, the kids are going to be the ones that actually confer immunity
[1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:21.400]  throughout the population because if you think about it, children are 30% of our population.
[1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:28.080]  And so experts are telling us that more than 50% of them now are immune to coronavirus
[1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:35.440]  and it's because as children they get colds all the time and the common cold is coronavirus.
[1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:41.560]  It's one of the viruses that causes the common cold and children as we know always get colds.
[1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:44.000]  It's not unusual for a child to get a cold.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:51.400]  Well, this is one of those issues where you do not vaccinate a child against a disease
[1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:53.320]  that they have no risk for.
[1:08:53.320 --> 1:08:56.000]  It doesn't make any sense.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:01.480]  It doesn't make sense that we are telling our children the reason they should get vaccinated
[1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:03.880]  is to protect grandma.
[1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:06.440]  That is ludicrous.
[1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:10.240]  There's so much risk involved in this vaccine.
[1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:19.640]  Number one, it is a technology that has never been in a vaccine before.
[1:09:19.640 --> 1:09:24.520]  Number two, there are no long-term studies whatsoever on safety.
[1:09:24.520 --> 1:09:30.120]  Number three, the original trials did not include anyone under the age of 18.
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:37.240]  Number four, the original trials did not include anyone that was immune to COVID.
[1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:43.800]  So they never checked anyone that had COVID in the past and enrolled them in these studies
[1:09:43.800 --> 1:09:52.080]  because we know now that if you are COVID recovered or COVID immune and you receive a vaccination
[1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:59.400]  that you have a two to three times higher risk of getting very high severe adverse events.
[1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:02.200]  This is just the data.
[1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:05.920]  So let me ask you this question and I'll withhold my opinion.
[1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:11.200]  It's pretty well known I would imagine to this audience, but I'll ask you with everything
[1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:17.160]  you've just said and with now the data that we have so we can say this without hesitation,
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:21.880]  the vaccine is more dangerous for children under 18 than COVID.
[1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:25.560]  Actually the vaccine is more dangerous for people under 30 than COVID, but we'll stick
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:27.240]  with the kids right now.
[1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:31.880]  So why do you suppose they would be doing this?
[1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:34.640]  Well there's two interesting facts that you need to know.
[1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:41.600]  The reason, I don't know the reason why they're doing this honestly and I'm hopeful that
[1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:47.640]  my thought processes of it being very sinister is a farce.
[1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:52.840]  However, the data is pointing to not so much.
[1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:57.160]  We originally had hope that the kids were never going to be touched.
[1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:04.960]  We know that from the Israeli data that they reached herd immunity without touching a kid.
[1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:09.160]  So we were real hopeful here in the United States that the children would be just left
[1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:10.160]  alone.
[1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:17.120]  Unfortunately, with the EUA in place, there's two major issues at bay here.
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:22.800]  The first one is the fact that under EUA, which is the emergency use authorization,
[1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:29.640]  they can authorize in a quote unquote emergency situation, which of course right now has not
[1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:34.720]  been lifted to date, but hopefully will be very, very soon.
[1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:43.160]  And in that, they don't really have to abide by the law that states that if a product is
[1:11:43.160 --> 1:11:50.600]  FDA approved and causes or has a potential to cause 25 deaths, it needs to be pulled
[1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:51.600]  off the market.
[1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:57.800]  So they really don't want this to actually become FDA approved because almost immediately
[1:11:57.800 --> 1:12:00.800]  it will be pulled.
[1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:08.280]  If it even makes that approval, and so I'll ask you this, do you believe COVID is still
[1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:12.720]  an emergency or ever was an emergency?
[1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:16.880]  So when we look at, again, data, let's just look at the data.
[1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:19.640]  You know, I've lived through five pandemics as a physician.
[1:12:19.640 --> 1:12:27.800]  So for me, you know, this was not as bad as the 2017 flu epidemic that we had just in
[1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:29.800]  2017, just a few years ago.
[1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:36.800]  I was seeing 60 to 80 patients a day running around like crazy, testing for the flu, treating
[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:42.160]  for the flu, you know, giving people advice about how to protect themselves and how to
[1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:45.920]  protect others and what vitamins to take and so on and so forth.
[1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:54.760]  And if you see this, the approach that we had with this pandemic is so off key.
[1:12:54.760 --> 1:12:55.760]  It's completely off.
[1:12:55.760 --> 1:13:02.520]  You know, the first media coverage was things like, stay home, don't see your doctor, you
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:08.280]  know, just take some over the county counter remedies until you can't breathe anymore and
[1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:11.360]  then go and visit the emergency room.
[1:13:11.360 --> 1:13:14.560]  We had never done this before in history, in medical history, I've never seen anything
[1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:15.560]  like this before.
[1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:17.920]  So this is a big problem.
[1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:23.560]  You know, we are, you know, the numbers show that it falls in the normal range of other
[1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:25.720]  pandemics in the past histories.
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:30.640]  So I don't think this is something that we really need to worry about as far as is it
[1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:31.640]  over?
[1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:33.040]  Yeah, it's been over.
[1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:37.440]  And there's evidence to show we've been at herd immunity since before 2% of the population
[1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:40.880]  was even starting to be vaccinated.
[1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:45.680]  And you know, either way, whether this was the emergency, the media claimed it was or
[1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:49.600]  not, the government does not have the right to just take control of your life and your
[1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:52.200]  body just through declaring an emergency.
[1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:53.960]  That's a very dangerous precedent being set.
[1:13:53.960 --> 1:13:58.120]  We'll be right back with Dr. Angelina Farella.
[1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:00.120]  Your voice counts.

[1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:07.720]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:09.240]  They know you're angry.
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:13.520]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:14.520]  we've got.

[1:15:55.560 --> 1:16:02.920]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[1:16:02.920 --> 1:16:11.640]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[1:16:11.640 --> 1:16:19.520]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves,
[1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:27.120]  worsted slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system, rendered down to be
[1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:33.360]  servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and safety and control.
[1:16:33.360 --> 1:16:38.440]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia,
[1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:43.400]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[1:16:43.400 --> 1:16:44.400]  It's that choice.
[1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:47.640]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:52.000]  It's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:59.160]  It is a spiritual battle and end full wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[1:16:59.160 --> 1:17:14.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:19.720]  Go back here on the Alex Jones Show, Owen Troyer sitting in for Alex Jones.
[1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:29.320]  Dr. Angelina Farella is our guest, and, Dr., I'm not sure if you follow the news as much
[1:17:29.320 --> 1:17:30.320]  as I do.
[1:17:30.320 --> 1:17:34.400]  You're obviously studying the data, so our perspectives might be different on this, but
[1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:38.720]  I'm curious if, in your own head space, when looking at this data and seeing all this play
[1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:43.720]  out, what you're thinking, because all I'm doing is just covering the news every day.
[1:17:43.720 --> 1:17:47.480]  I don't know if you saw the press conference by Ron Johnson the other night where these
[1:17:47.480 --> 1:17:52.000]  poor families are bringing up their kids that had the adverse reactions, and so this is
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  all happening.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  It's all real.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:57.520]  Even if the media wants to not cover it and Big Tech wants to censor it, this is very
[1:17:57.520 --> 1:17:58.520]  real stuff.
[1:17:58.520 --> 1:18:03.720]  These are very real people this is happening to, so knowing that that's all going on, and
[1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:08.240]  that's in your mind that that's going on, but then seeing the continuation of the push
[1:18:08.240 --> 1:18:12.400]  from Dr. Fauci, the push from the Biden administration saying, yes, get vaccinated.
[1:18:12.400 --> 1:18:14.800]  We need at least 70, 80% of people vaccinated.
[1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:16.800]  Yes, vaccinate your kids.
[1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:23.960]  What goes through your mind when you see those two conflicting developments happening?
[1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:26.000]  Easy.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:29.760]  This is criminal, what we're doing to our kids.
[1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:30.760]  Absolutely criminal.
[1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:37.560]  Because I was around in 1999 when Rodevirus vaccine was on the market, and there were
[1:18:37.560 --> 1:18:47.320]  15 cases of a condition called intiseception, and what intiseception is is when the GI tract
[1:18:47.320 --> 1:18:52.040]  basically telescopes on itself, sometimes it releases on its own and sometimes it needs
[1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:54.560]  help to do, to release.
[1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:59.720]  So I was one of the doctors at the time that was told to please go and check all the refrigerators
[1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:04.440]  and pull all the Rodevirus because it was being recalled because of this incident.
[1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:13.360]  So for 15 cases of a medical entity that was non-life threatening, it pulled a vaccine
[1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:14.760]  off the market.
[1:19:14.760 --> 1:19:19.840]  And I remember back then, I remember thinking, wow, this is really kind of awesome because
[1:19:19.840 --> 1:19:26.000]  these companies are really looking at the safety for kids.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:29.600]  They are looking out for the safety of our children.
[1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:35.440]  This whole COVID thing has just blown us out of my mind now.
[1:19:35.440 --> 1:19:42.480]  It just upsets me to my core about how we are allowing these companies to use our children
[1:19:42.480 --> 1:19:44.000]  as lab rats.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:50.440]  Never before has any product for children hit the market without at least three to six
[1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:56.200]  to eight years of safety data before we even introduce it into our pediatric population.
[1:19:56.200 --> 1:19:57.200]  What happened with that?
[1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:00.120]  It's been thrown out the window completely.
[1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:07.080]  So now we're vaccinating a group of children that, number one, don't need to be vaccinated
[1:20:07.080 --> 1:20:12.160]  against an illness that they do not have significant risk for them.
[1:20:12.160 --> 1:20:14.160]  They just don't.
[1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:16.120]  It's very simple.
[1:20:16.120 --> 1:20:22.480]  So that's one of the things that has really pushed me to come out and speak out against
[1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:31.080]  this because this is one of those issues where you only give a vaccine to a person that is
[1:20:31.080 --> 1:20:37.440]  at high risk for major risks from that particular disease.
[1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:42.640]  You do not use vaccination to protect another age group that's at risk.
[1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:44.760]  And that's what we're doing right now.
[1:20:44.760 --> 1:20:50.680]  So my faith in the pharmaceutical industry and their protection of kids has been completely
[1:20:50.680 --> 1:20:52.560]  destroyed.
[1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:59.480]  What we're doing on the health department level is also something that just is throwing
[1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:03.480]  me way off because I went yesterday to the Houston health department.
[1:21:03.480 --> 1:21:10.480]  They had a public forum, which basically wasn't a public forum because within that audience
[1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:14.800]  there were plants that were very obvious from the health department.
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:21.720]  So when I raised concerns and questions, they basically were poo-pooing what I had to say,
[1:21:21.720 --> 1:21:27.320]  minimalizing, basically trying to shut me up from being recorded and broadcasting this
[1:21:27.320 --> 1:21:33.720]  information to the public that was online, that may have been watching online.
[1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:36.120]  So it was a complete nutter farce.
[1:21:36.120 --> 1:21:45.240]  I tried to bring up the fact that, you know, for children with a 99.997% survivability,
[1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:52.880]  what that means is that basically one in a million chance of a child dying from COVID.
[1:21:52.880 --> 1:21:58.840]  However, these vaccines are killing one in 3,000 people.
[1:21:58.840 --> 1:22:00.600]  That's unacceptable.
[1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:06.840]  There is no reason whatsoever that the safety of the American public should be forefront
[1:22:06.840 --> 1:22:07.840]  in this.
[1:22:07.840 --> 1:22:09.120]  Absolutely not.
[1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:14.560]  And children should be completely excluded and protected because a great majority of
[1:22:14.560 --> 1:22:20.840]  them may be actually already immune and we are harming them.
[1:22:20.840 --> 1:22:26.040]  So the other thing is, I don't know if you saw the ACIP, which is the advisory committee
[1:22:26.040 --> 1:22:28.160]  of immunization practices.
[1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:35.120]  They had their emergency meeting last Wednesday and I listened in on a great majority of it.
[1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:41.440]  Honestly, I had to shut it off at certain points because I was yelling at my phone about
[1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:46.920]  how ludicrous some of the statements that were coming through from these board members.
[1:22:46.920 --> 1:22:54.080]  They were downplaying the side effect of myocarditis and pericarditis as if it was really just a
[1:22:54.080 --> 1:23:02.960]  mild event that is so upsetting to me because myocarditis and pericarditis, they are not
[1:23:02.960 --> 1:23:04.160]  something that are...
[1:23:04.160 --> 1:23:06.560]  No, I mean, let's be clear.
[1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:09.680]  That's like saying a heart attack is a minor event.
[1:23:09.680 --> 1:23:10.680]  Correct.
[1:23:10.680 --> 1:23:11.680]  Absolutely.
[1:23:11.680 --> 1:23:17.720]  And it's heartbreaking because they were saying, oh, these children fully recovered.
[1:23:17.720 --> 1:23:20.000]  Fully recovered, 98% of them were in the hospital.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:21.640]  What do you mean they fully recovered?
[1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:29.440]  They take six months to even determine whether or not there is damage to that child's heart.
[1:23:29.440 --> 1:23:34.200]  These vaccines have only been available to these kids for about six, eight weeks now
[1:23:34.200 --> 1:23:41.480]  and yet we have over 300 cases of reported myocarditis or pericarditis.
[1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:45.360]  You have to understand that the reporting through the vaccine adverse event reporting
[1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:47.600]  system is backlogged right now.
[1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:49.200]  We know that it's backlogged.
[1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:55.360]  We also know that those numbers are only representative of about one to 10% of the actual adverse
[1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:58.760]  events that are going on at this moment.
[1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:05.000]  And so these numbers actually can be way, way in excess of the 300 or so that they're
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:09.360]  actually putting on the VARS reporting system site.
[1:24:09.360 --> 1:24:17.600]  So this, of course, is something that... Other than to say that it's very upsetting, right?
[1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:22.200]  We're seeing it after the first shot and we're also seeing it even in higher proportions
[1:24:22.200 --> 1:24:27.920]  and in greater leaps and bounds after a second shot and what's even more disturbing is the
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:35.440]  fact that the board even came out and stated that if a child got myocarditis or pericarditis
[1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:43.240]  from the first inoculation that as long as they quote, unquote, recovered, it was okay
[1:24:43.240 --> 1:24:45.400]  for them to get the second shot.
[1:24:45.400 --> 1:24:53.320]  This is mind-blowing that they're not even recognizing a very serious adverse event.
[1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:54.480]  It is not mild.
[1:24:54.480 --> 1:24:57.280]  There's no such thing as mild myocarditis.
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:04.160]  And if you don't believe me, why don't we look at the most quoted and the most published
[1:25:04.160 --> 1:25:08.120]  cardiologists in the entire nation, Dr. Peter McCullough.
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:09.320]  Look at his studies.
[1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:15.680]  Look at what he's coming out with because Peter 100% is behind me with this too.
[1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:19.560]  When I actually asked him about this and I said, Peter, you know, I'm really disturbed
[1:25:19.560 --> 1:25:22.120]  and he says, absolutely, this is ridiculous.
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:27.240]  We don't vaccinate a child for a disease they don't get, a disease that they have no
[1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:33.600]  risk from, especially now when so early on we're seeing these high-risk problems, myocarditis,
[1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:34.600]  pericarditis.
[1:25:34.600 --> 1:25:39.880]  Let's not even talk about the fact that many of these cases are being misdiagnosed and
[1:25:39.880 --> 1:25:42.280]  not reported.
[1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:46.320]  And these are just the most common side effects.
[1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:52.040]  We haven't even talked about the Guillain-Barre syndrome, the seizures, all the rest.
[1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:54.840]  We'll be right back with Dr. Angelina Farrella.
[1:25:54.840 --> 1:25:58.320]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[1:25:58.320 --> 1:26:04.080]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative.
[1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:09.320]  It hurts, it stinks, it's got pus coming out of it, I go to the doctor, they fix it.
[1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:10.320]  That's not negative.
[1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:12.160]  I'm not living in denial.
[1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:16.880]  And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we didn't feel yet, but
[1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:18.440]  now it's come to the surface.
[1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:20.400]  That's actually a positive thing.
[1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:22.680]  And so, yeah, Trump did an overall great job.
[1:26:22.680 --> 1:26:23.680]  They stole the election.
[1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:25.760]  We can't get down about that.
[1:26:25.760 --> 1:26:29.600]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:32.960]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed.
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:33.960]  They're scared.
[1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:37.200]  That's why, instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers, look what happened.
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:41.720]  No we're a bunch of winners, they're trying to suppress us, let our light of truth shine
[1:26:41.720 --> 1:26:43.920]  and tell everybody what's happening.
[1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:47.680]  Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.
[1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:51.480]  Just keep sharing however you can and realize we're in an information war.
[1:26:51.480 --> 1:26:55.880]  We're going to win this together in the Fight Starts, templewars.com.
[1:26:55.880 --> 1:26:58.360]  The world is awakening.
[1:26:58.360 --> 1:27:01.880]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[1:27:01.880 --> 1:27:07.240]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral
[1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:13.200]  commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the club of Rome.
[1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:18.360]  And so, even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:22.960]  come out of the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:26.080]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:30.000]  So as bad as these times are, a lot of negative things are about to happen.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:31.960]  Guys, humanity is winning.
[1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:37.080]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:38.520]  That is invincible.
[1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:41.800]  That is ethereal, timeless and unstoppable.
[1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:46.720]  So don't trust in man, trust in God to lead God and direct your soul and then take action
[1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:50.640]  against the globalists and realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew
[1:27:50.640 --> 1:27:51.640]  to you.
[1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:55.840]  We will never back down from the globalists and we will never surrender.
[1:27:55.840 --> 1:28:00.880]  We here at Info Wars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:03.160]  is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:08.760]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it
[1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:13.840]  has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric
[1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:14.840]  effects.
[1:28:14.840 --> 1:28:20.520]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[1:28:20.520 --> 1:28:24.840]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:28:24.840 --> 1:28:29.520]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:30.720]  loosen up a little.
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:35.640]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:41.640]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:47.800]  herbs including but not limited to German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap and Valerian
[1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:48.800]  root.

[1:29:58.640 --> 1:30:13.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:30:13.680 --> 1:30:17.560]  We're back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[1:30:17.560 --> 1:30:23.640]  Dr. Angelina Ferella is our guest.
[1:30:23.640 --> 1:30:25.640]  And there's just so much to cover with her.
[1:30:25.640 --> 1:30:33.400]  I'm going to try to get to all of it here in the next two segments with the good doctor.
[1:30:33.400 --> 1:30:36.760]  So let me just ask you this because you were kind of getting into this in the last segment
[1:30:36.760 --> 1:30:39.080]  and we're really focusing on the children here.
[1:30:39.080 --> 1:30:46.240]  But again, it must just be stunning and shocking for me it is because I see all the lies, but
[1:30:46.240 --> 1:30:50.320]  they say safe and effective, safe and effective, safe and effective, safe and effective.
[1:30:50.320 --> 1:30:57.560]  When quite frankly, the data shows that it's neither safe or effective because we're seeing
[1:30:57.560 --> 1:31:02.320]  the entire cruise ships that have been vaccinated, cases of coronavirus.
[1:31:02.320 --> 1:31:05.360]  In Massachusetts, they're keeping the data really tight.
[1:31:05.360 --> 1:31:10.600]  All these people vaccinated, thousands of people testing positive for COVID.
[1:31:10.600 --> 1:31:14.080]  And then you have the Delta variant, which seems to be an offshoot of the vaccinated
[1:31:14.080 --> 1:31:16.840]  people, but we can get to that later.
[1:31:16.840 --> 1:31:21.040]  So they say safe and effective, even though neither of it is true.
[1:31:21.040 --> 1:31:23.720]  And we've discussed this with the children, but what about with adults?
[1:31:23.720 --> 1:31:24.720]  What about with adults?
[1:31:24.720 --> 1:31:29.560]  What about the short-term side effects, the long-term side effects?
[1:31:29.560 --> 1:31:30.560]  What are you seeing?
[1:31:30.560 --> 1:31:35.520]  What are your concerns with adults that are getting vaccinated?
[1:31:35.520 --> 1:31:41.160]  The what we are seeing and hearing from boots on the ground, I'm talking about medical professionals
[1:31:41.160 --> 1:31:45.360]  that are still in emergency rooms, that are, you know, manning the floors.
[1:31:45.360 --> 1:31:51.600]  I spoke with an ambulance personnel the other day in the EMT and he's telling me, you know,
[1:31:51.600 --> 1:32:00.480]  the calls that they're doing lately, it tends to be 110% post-vax, post-vax adverse events
[1:32:00.480 --> 1:32:04.600]  So you're talking like EMT is going to the scene of people having adverse reactions from
[1:32:04.600 --> 1:32:07.840]  the vaccine is like the number one thing right now.
[1:32:07.840 --> 1:32:09.360]  That is what this EMT told me.
[1:32:09.360 --> 1:32:15.360]  He said, the majority, if not all of their calls that he has done on his shifts, you know,
[1:32:15.360 --> 1:32:24.080]  they do 24 to 48 hour shifts at a time, they're all related in one way, shape or form to some
[1:32:24.080 --> 1:32:28.400]  kind of adverse event that's happening because of a vaccinated patient.
[1:32:28.400 --> 1:32:34.520]  You know, heart attacks, strokes, neurologic problems, I mean, severe neurologic problems.
[1:32:34.520 --> 1:32:36.960]  We're seeing all kinds of strange things.
[1:32:36.960 --> 1:32:42.360]  You know, Dr. Taryn Clark, who's one of our American frontline doctors, she's a neurologist
[1:32:42.360 --> 1:32:49.440]  and she is seeing just insane numbers of horrible effects that are occurring in the neurology
[1:32:49.440 --> 1:32:50.440]  realm.
[1:32:50.440 --> 1:32:54.680]  You know, the heart attack rate is probably through the roof.
[1:32:54.680 --> 1:32:59.520]  Let me just cut you off right there and ask you this for a comparison here because you're
[1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:04.600]  a doctor, you were around in the year 2020, you're here in 2021.
[1:33:04.600 --> 1:33:08.760]  What was a bigger, you know, kind of onslaught of reports?
[1:33:08.760 --> 1:33:12.080]  What was a bigger event horizon for doctors?
[1:33:12.080 --> 1:33:16.960]  Was it the COVID pandemic or has it been the vaccines?
[1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:21.920]  You know, that's a hard one because I think the brainwashing has gone across the medical
[1:33:21.920 --> 1:33:26.600]  establishment that is so sick, I can't even understand it.
[1:33:26.600 --> 1:33:30.800]  And that's one of the reasons why I came out and that I reached out to the American frontline
[1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:35.880]  doctors because I felt like this, our world has been turned upside down.
[1:33:35.880 --> 1:33:41.920]  Never before in medical history, not since I've been practicing for 25 years now, have
[1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:47.520]  I seen such propaganda against the patient-physician relationship.
[1:33:47.520 --> 1:33:53.880]  You know, every time you turn on the television, there's some kind of targeted TV commercial
[1:33:53.880 --> 1:33:59.760]  that told you to stay home, wash your hands, stay away from people, wear a mask.
[1:33:59.760 --> 1:34:05.520]  And now, every time you turn on the TV, there's constant commercials barraging you with propaganda
[1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:07.680]  that state, get vaccinated.
[1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:12.320]  It's the only way that we can stop the pandemic and it's the only way that we can become
[1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:13.320]  normal again.
[1:34:13.320 --> 1:34:14.320]  This is not normal.
[1:34:14.320 --> 1:34:16.280]  This has never been normal.
[1:34:16.280 --> 1:34:21.800]  So we are not ever going to reach normalcy with this because if we don't actually show
[1:34:21.800 --> 1:34:27.640]  both sides of the story where doctors actually open their eyeballs and understand that sometimes
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:34.280]  the patient in front of them is dealing with a direct adverse event from a vaccine and
[1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:40.600]  yes, that by law is supposed to be reported, it's criminal, it's malpractice.
[1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:43.320]  And I hate to say that about my peers, honestly.
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:47.840]  I mean, it breaks my heart to hear that there are patients coming to me.
[1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:53.840]  I'm a pediatrician in a small community in Southeast Houston and I have adult people
[1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:58.880]  calling me all the time because they know that I will treat them.
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:02.520]  I will treat them whether they have COVID, I will help protect them if they don't have
[1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:08.840]  COVID or never been exposed to COVID or if they ever feared that they may be exposed.
[1:35:08.840 --> 1:35:14.880]  We have opened our doors so wide at this point that it just still blows my mind that there
[1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:20.680]  are doctors telling their patients, one, we won't see you if you're not fully vaccinated.
[1:35:20.680 --> 1:35:22.000]  That's ridiculous.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:29.280]  Secondly, they won't see their patients if they have one or two symptoms of COVID.
[1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:34.560]  I have patients coming to me, pediatric patients where parents are like, my kid is probably
[1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:39.320]  suffering from allergies, but our doctor won't see them because they have a runny nose and
[1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:40.320]  cough.
[1:35:40.320 --> 1:35:46.040]  And that is actually two symptoms of COVID, so they will not see us unless our child is
[1:35:46.040 --> 1:35:48.040]  COVID tested first.
[1:35:48.040 --> 1:35:49.160]  That's ridiculous.
[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:50.160]  We are doctors.
[1:35:50.160 --> 1:35:51.960]  What did we sign up for?
[1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:56.800]  It is ludicrous to me to find out that there are doctors going bankrupt during a pandemic
[1:35:56.800 --> 1:35:57.800]  because they show-
[1:35:57.800 --> 1:36:03.840]  But isn't that actually against the Hippocratic oath that you turn patients down?
[1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:07.960]  I don't know what's going on, to be honest with you, seriously.
[1:36:07.960 --> 1:36:11.000]  This whole thing has just blown my mind, and that's why-
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:16.240]  Well, look, doctor, let me just tell you, I mean, I could tell you what's going on.
[1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:19.720]  I kind of just want people to experience it for themselves because it's more powerful.
[1:36:19.720 --> 1:36:25.320]  If I tell you that a vaccine was released to run a population control program on the
[1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:26.920]  planet, you wouldn't believe me.
[1:36:26.920 --> 1:36:27.920]  I completely understand.
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:29.160]  That sounds outlandish.
[1:36:29.160 --> 1:36:33.360]  So I don't just bring that on to people, but when you see it and experience it for yourself
[1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:36.680]  and you have that realization yourself, it's all the more powerful.
[1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:41.120]  But so let me ask you this, and I'll combine these two topics that I wanted to get into
[1:36:41.120 --> 1:36:43.760]  with you.
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:45.280]  What is actually in this vaccine?
[1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:46.800]  Have you looked into the ingredients?
[1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:48.320]  What do you think about the ingredients?
[1:36:48.320 --> 1:36:51.200]  And is it even technically a vaccine?
[1:36:51.200 --> 1:36:56.240]  Well, let me go to the second one first because the second question is much easier because
[1:36:56.240 --> 1:36:59.920]  if you define the second question, the first one doesn't matter.
[1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:00.920]  It's not a vaccine.
[1:37:00.920 --> 1:37:02.920]  This is not a vaccine at all.
[1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:03.920]  It's a genetic product.
[1:37:03.920 --> 1:37:05.800]  It is not a vaccine.
[1:37:05.800 --> 1:37:12.800]  It has never been used in the vaccine industry before, ever, this technology, ever.
[1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:19.160]  We actually know, I don't even want to get into that kind of craziness, but really honestly,
[1:37:19.160 --> 1:37:20.160]  it's not a vaccine.
[1:37:20.160 --> 1:37:28.280]  So when you're looking at just that part of it, it should have never been able to even
[1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:31.960]  be classified under emergency use authorization.
[1:37:31.960 --> 1:37:39.880]  But we find now that the dictionary is now changing the definition of what a vaccine
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:40.880]  is.
[1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:49.480]  There was a change done in the actual dictionary so that this whole nonsense could be justifiable,
[1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:50.480]  I guess, in the future.
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:55.000]  We're changing history just to suit ourselves, I guess.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:58.280]  So that kind of just pushes it away from that.
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:37:59.520]  Do we know it's in the vaccine?
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:01.400]  Well, it's proprietary.
[1:38:01.400 --> 1:38:04.920]  It's completely proprietary, so they don't even have to tell us the truth about what's
[1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:05.920]  in it.
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:06.920]  So no, we don't know what's in it.
[1:38:06.920 --> 1:38:07.920]  We do know some things.
[1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:09.360]  We know about the spike protein.
[1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:14.440]  We know about spike protein syndrome, which is the actual, a lot of people refer to it
[1:38:14.440 --> 1:38:15.440]  as shedding.
[1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:22.080]  Well, basically what happens is this mRNA goes into your system, it starts manufacturing
[1:38:22.080 --> 1:38:26.920]  protein through your DNA, and this protein doesn't have a shutoff valve.
[1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:28.960]  There's no on-off switch or anything.
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:35.920]  So you're just producing these spike proteins in numbers that are in such great, overwhelming
[1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:40.720]  numbers that your body can't contain them within your skin, honestly.
[1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:44.360]  And so what happens is that these proteins, I mean, think about how small these things
[1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:45.360]  are.
[1:38:45.360 --> 1:38:50.200]  These things, they're teeny-weeny, so a mask is irrelevant.
[1:38:50.200 --> 1:38:53.000]  I mean, the mask doesn't block it, trust me.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:54.720]  So the mask is completely irrelevant.
[1:38:54.720 --> 1:38:58.400]  You could do that if you want to, but honestly, it's not doing a darn thing, except making
[1:38:58.400 --> 1:39:00.320]  your hyper-kethnic.
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:05.800]  But it's being shed through the skin, through inhalation, exhalation of a person that's
[1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:06.920]  been vaccinated.
[1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:12.640]  So they're actually sending these proteins onto people that are not vaccinated, and that's
[1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:18.360]  why the unvaxxed, or what I don't even like calling them unvaxxed, I like to say that many
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:22.400]  of these people that are unvaxxed are really COVID immune.
[1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:24.040]  They are COVID recovered.
[1:39:24.040 --> 1:39:28.960]  But they are still feeling the effects of the spike protein syndrome.
[1:39:28.960 --> 1:39:36.560]  They are calling us with problems with headaches, with fatigue, with unusual sensations like
[1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:39.000]  numbness in their hands and feet.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:42.120]  I've gotten many personal reports of that.
[1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:44.960]  And so the other interesting thing is that we have-
[1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:45.960]  Hold that thought.
[1:39:45.960 --> 1:39:46.960]  We got to take a break.
[1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:47.960]  Let's come right back.
[1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:50.240]  Hold that thought, Dr. Angelina Ferrell.
[1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:51.400]  This has been very powerful.
[1:39:51.400 --> 1:39:52.400]  Another segment coming up.
[1:39:52.400 --> 1:39:53.400]  Don't go anywhere, folks.
[1:39:53.400 --> 1:39:54.400]  Let's share these videos.
[1:39:54.400 --> 1:39:59.600]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the
[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:01.800]  scientific literature is overwhelming.
[1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:05.120]  It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body, your well-being.
[1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:07.960]  A lot of folks take it before they take tests.
[1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:09.960]  People that have arthritis pain, they take it.
[1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:12.600]  It's well-known for the things it does for a body.
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:14.600]  It makes our lives so much better.
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:19.720]  But then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil, and we've got both
[1:40:19.720 --> 1:40:24.000]  at infowarstore.com, but with the COVID lockdown, supply chains have broken down, so it's been
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:27.240]  months and months and months since we've had krill oil back at Stoff.
[1:40:27.240 --> 1:40:31.000]  But let's back, ladies and gentlemen, and despite the fact that it's already very fairly
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:36.360]  priced for the grade it is, highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:41.800]  time at infowarstore.com with free shipping and double-paid credit points, because I want
[1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:44.240]  those of you that have already been customers to have a chance to get more of it, and I
[1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:48.440]  want new viewers and listeners who have tried it to get it from us, and then try regular
[1:40:48.440 --> 1:40:51.760]  krill oil that is not one-tenth as powerful as ours.
[1:40:51.760 --> 1:40:54.760]  This is the highest grade back at Stoff, infowarstore.com.
[1:40:54.760 --> 1:41:02.160]  The globalists are having their revolution, but for humanity it has to have its revolution.
[1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:10.720]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:20.160]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves,
[1:41:20.160 --> 1:41:21.160]  worsted slaves.
[1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:27.920]  It's just property from cradle to grave of the system, rendered down to be servile minions
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:32.480]  of the system and a ritual of dominance and safety and control.
[1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:37.680]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia
[1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:41.880]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:47.600]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world, and it's the only
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:51.120]  choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:56.320]  It is a spiritual battle, and infowar is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[1:41:56.320 --> 1:42:00.640]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point, it's very bittersweet.
[1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:03.800]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would, and now we have
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:05.520]  a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[1:42:05.520 --> 1:42:09.400]  I care about beating the new world order, and it's because we have so much credibility
[1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:12.360]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:15.560]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us, for a lot of reasons
[1:42:15.560 --> 1:42:19.240]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:22.840]  the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[1:42:22.840 --> 1:42:26.720]  So please pray for us and please buy the products, and infowarstore.com, they're great
[1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:29.040]  products plus they fund the operation.
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:31.840]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:32.840]  Do they fund freedom?
[1:42:32.840 --> 1:42:34.240]  No, a lot of them don't.
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:38.880]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[1:42:38.880 --> 1:42:40.720]  up and looking for truth.
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:42.320]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:45.760]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.

[1:43:59.680 --> 1:44:03.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:44:03.720 --> 1:44:13.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I've got some more breaking news on this right now that
[1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:17.840]  I'm not going to go too deep into, but just so that folks have a better understanding,
[1:44:17.840 --> 1:44:22.320]  because I hope this video goes viral with Dr. Angelina Farella.
[1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:26.360]  You have this company out of France, Sanofi, that has just decided they're going to start
[1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:33.760]  investing hundreds of millions of dollars every year into the mRNA vaccine research.
[1:44:33.760 --> 1:44:39.840]  And this is something that they've been hesitant on, because in the past, mRNA vaccine research
[1:44:39.840 --> 1:44:44.640]  has been done since the 30s, but for the 90 years up to this point, they've never got
[1:44:44.640 --> 1:44:50.360]  that past animal trials, because every group of animals they test the mRNA vaccine with
[1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:52.000]  dies.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:55.160]  So for 90 years, they've been killing animals testing this vaccine.
[1:44:55.160 --> 1:45:00.240]  Oh, now they roll it out to the public without approval because of the emergency youth authorization.
[1:45:00.240 --> 1:45:02.080]  Boy, that's extremely dangerous.
[1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:06.760]  So this is just more evidence that, oh, Big Pharma realizes now, the rulebook's thrown
[1:45:06.760 --> 1:45:11.040]  out, people die, people get side effects, doesn't matter, so we're just going to keep
[1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:14.560]  investing this, we'll roll it out to the public, and it won't even matter if people die.
[1:45:14.560 --> 1:45:18.200]  So we'll invest all the money, and we're immune from lawsuits anyway.
[1:45:18.200 --> 1:45:22.520]  So I figured I'd just break that with the doctor, Angelina Ferrella, on with us.
[1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:27.320]  And I wanted to ask her this, because this is the new phenomenon.
[1:45:27.320 --> 1:45:32.640]  Now our health establishment, Fauci, and these doctors that go on mainstream news are saying,
[1:45:32.640 --> 1:45:34.900]  oh, well, just mix the vaccines.
[1:45:34.900 --> 1:45:38.840]  Just get one here, one over there, get your double dose, whatever, just get 100 vaccines
[1:45:38.840 --> 1:45:39.840]  they're saying now.
[1:45:39.840 --> 1:45:44.960]  And beyond just the fact it's still in testing phase, it's just like, oh, yeah, let's just
[1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:47.960]  double, I mean, this is like mad scientist stuff.
[1:45:47.960 --> 1:45:52.000]  So what do you make of them saying now, combine your vaccines?
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  It's fine.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:57.080]  This is just, it's absolutely ludicrous.
[1:45:57.080 --> 1:46:01.280]  And I think part of the problem is, is because they lied on the efficacy data.
[1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:07.200]  So even by Pfizer's own data, if you look at Pfizer's own data, it shows that there's
[1:46:07.200 --> 1:46:15.000]  less than a 1% efficacy rate, not 95%, that is, that is an outright outrageous lie.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:19.800]  And on top of that, you still are seeing propaganda, like yesterday when I went to this public
[1:46:19.800 --> 1:46:25.640]  hearing, that they, on the sheets that they give the public, you know, that is part of
[1:46:25.640 --> 1:46:31.600]  the information that they disseminate to tell people like, this is safe and effective.
[1:46:31.600 --> 1:46:35.360]  Under the side effects, it's very suspect because, you know, these vaccines have been
[1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:38.320]  out now for six, seven, eight months now.
[1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:39.800]  We are seeing horrible side effects.
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:44.240]  I mean, you can see, I'm sure you know this and your, and your viewers know this, that
[1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:53.240]  the number one deadliest vaccine ever in history is this one, is this class of vaccines, is
[1:46:53.240 --> 1:46:54.740]  the COVID vaccines.
[1:46:54.740 --> 1:47:00.160]  They have more deaths and more adverse events recorded and reported.
[1:47:00.160 --> 1:47:04.920]  And just so people understand, we're not talking about, we're not talking about a little uptake
[1:47:04.920 --> 1:47:05.920]  here, folks.
[1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:09.760]  We're talking about six months of this vaccine being rolled out and the death numbers are
[1:47:09.760 --> 1:47:12.640]  literally off the charts.
[1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:14.640]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:47:14.640 --> 1:47:20.240]  I mean, if you combine all the years that we have been collecting data on adverse events
[1:47:20.240 --> 1:47:26.520]  from vaccines and add them all up, they still, they pale in comparison.
[1:47:26.520 --> 1:47:27.960]  They're not even close.
[1:47:27.960 --> 1:47:28.960]  Not even close.
[1:47:28.960 --> 1:47:29.960]  It's ridiculous.
[1:47:29.960 --> 1:47:34.800]  I mean, swine flu, that vaccine, when that came out, that was pulled after 25 deaths.
[1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:39.800]  25, we are now in excess of 6,000 deaths.
[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:44.600]  And I can tell you, I've been looking and trying to really combine the data, but because
[1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:49.560]  the CDC, by their own admission, is telling you that there's a backlog on their information
[1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:56.360]  and so not all the data is even in bears the way it should be, that I can't even give you
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:47:59.840]  a real good solid death rate in children under 18.
[1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:00.840]  And I'm looking into that.
[1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:06.160]  I'm having people help me to try to get these numbers because to me, we really need to see
[1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:09.800]  these numbers in order to combine real apples to apples, right?
[1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:11.720]  So we're going to start comparing things.
[1:48:11.720 --> 1:48:16.280]  We need to really compare, for instance, the death rate from COVID versus the death rate
[1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:17.680]  from the vaccines.
[1:48:17.680 --> 1:48:22.800]  Let's compare it because I can tell you that just on the face level, simple math, stuff
[1:48:22.800 --> 1:48:26.880]  that you learned in sixth grade, one in a million chance of dying from COVID if you're
[1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:34.600]  under the age of 30, actually, versus an overall rate of one in 3,000 deaths from the vaccine.
[1:48:34.600 --> 1:48:39.600]  And by the way, these are the rigged numbers that we have to go off of because we know
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:41.520]  that they were inflating the COVID numbers.
[1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:43.320]  We know they were inflating the death numbers.
[1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:44.320]  I had a great aunt.
[1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:49.280]  She was almost 90 years old, smoked and drank her entire life, was on, I mean, I love her
[1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:51.800]  to death, but she died, and they said, oh, she died of COVID.
[1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:52.800]  No, she didn't.
[1:48:52.800 --> 1:48:53.800]  She was 90 years old.
[1:48:53.800 --> 1:48:54.800]  She smoked and drank her whole life.
[1:48:54.800 --> 1:48:55.800]  God bless her soul.
[1:48:55.800 --> 1:48:57.480]  And so you have all of that stuff.
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:01.840]  But then, you know, you were saying in the last segment that the numbers that we're getting
[1:49:01.840 --> 1:49:05.180]  on VAERS are probably only 10% of the numbers.
[1:49:05.180 --> 1:49:09.560]  When we were trying to crunch this data, we, I guess, conservatively said, well, you can
[1:49:09.560 --> 1:49:11.320]  multiply it by four.
[1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:13.960]  That's how we landed on about 20,000 vaccine deaths.
[1:49:13.960 --> 1:49:17.200]  That was about a month ago when they first released the 5,000 number.
[1:49:17.200 --> 1:49:20.600]  But you're saying, really, it's closer to times 10.
[1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:23.000]  So maybe times four would be conservative.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:24.720]  Times 10 would be high.
[1:49:24.720 --> 1:49:25.640]  Either way, the point is.
[1:49:25.640 --> 1:49:29.160]  If we actually got the real numbers, people would learn real fast.
[1:49:29.160 --> 1:49:34.320]  This vaccine is much deadlier and much worse off for you than COVID.
[1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:35.320]  COVID's over.
[1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:37.920]  Why still is this push?
[1:49:37.920 --> 1:49:38.920]  It's over.
[1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:39.920]  The pandemic's over.
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:40.920]  It has been over.
[1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:43.320]  So then what do you make of the Delta variant?
[1:49:43.320 --> 1:49:49.080]  Because I believe, since that we saw it starting and the worst in Israel where everyone's vaccinated,
[1:49:49.080 --> 1:49:53.160]  is the Delta, quote unquote, Delta variant or Delta Plus variant or whatever new name
[1:49:53.160 --> 1:49:54.160]  they come up with.
[1:49:54.160 --> 1:49:58.840]  Do you believe that's the mutation of COVID out of the vaccinated people?
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:01.720]  You know, it's really hard to tell, right?
[1:50:01.720 --> 1:50:06.000]  Because first of all, let's just talk about variants for a second because we know that
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  viruses mutate.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:12.120]  We know that they mutate to become actually more contagious, but less deadly because
[1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:14.120]  it's an organism that wants to survive.
[1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:16.920]  So if it kills everybody, it's not going to survive.
[1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:19.560]  I mean, this is just basic.
[1:50:19.560 --> 1:50:26.640]  So when you're looking at variants, the variants really only vary less than 1%.
[1:50:26.640 --> 1:50:33.800]  So now I just heard a wonderful report this past week that, oh, no, the variants are covered
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:35.600]  by these vaccines.
[1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:41.240]  So in other words, if you come in contact with the variant, that you should be protected
[1:50:41.240 --> 1:50:42.240]  from your vaccination.
[1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:44.360]  Which by the way, we're getting mixed notes on that.
[1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:47.720]  The World Health Organization says, no, the COVID vaccine doesn't work.
[1:50:47.720 --> 1:50:50.280]  Anthony Fauci says, yes, the COVID vaccine does work.
[1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:51.280]  So somebody's wrong.
[1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:52.280]  Exactly.
[1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:54.400]  Well, I was just going to say that, too.
[1:50:54.400 --> 1:51:00.080]  You know, how come the World Health Organization came out last Thursday, I believe, with a
[1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:04.960]  statement that said no one under the age of, I'm paraphrasing, but no one under the age
[1:51:04.960 --> 1:51:10.000]  of 18 has any need to get these COVID vaccinations.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:13.920]  And then the next day, they changed the statement.
[1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:16.760]  So why is that?
[1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:19.040]  Why did they change their statement?
[1:51:19.040 --> 1:51:24.200]  Where all of a sudden it was like, they were putting a hard stop to anyone under 18 getting
[1:51:24.200 --> 1:51:26.160]  vaccinated.
[1:51:26.160 --> 1:51:29.600]  And I would assume that somebody had a heart over there.
[1:51:29.600 --> 1:51:35.000]  And then all of a sudden the next day, it changed to, well, not so much.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  Maybe they should.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:40.840]  So this is the kind of mixed messaging, and it's also very suspect when we're watching
[1:51:40.840 --> 1:51:41.840]  them.
[1:51:41.840 --> 1:51:45.320]  I mean, we are watching, American Frontline doctors, we are watching them like a hawk.
[1:51:45.320 --> 1:51:47.160]  Yeah, the world is watching.
[1:51:47.160 --> 1:51:50.360]  And let me just say this, because we got three minutes left in this segment.
[1:51:50.360 --> 1:51:55.320]  And guys, we're going to put the full interview at band.video, we're going to put the full
[1:51:55.320 --> 1:51:56.320]  interview up there.
[1:51:56.320 --> 1:51:57.640]  We'll put the segments up there, too.
[1:51:57.640 --> 1:52:01.800]  And then guys, let's make sure we have the writers write up a story with the same headline
[1:52:01.800 --> 1:52:04.520]  I put on the band.video with that link in there.
[1:52:04.520 --> 1:52:09.040]  We need to get as many eyes and ears on this doctor's report right here, this interview
[1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:10.040]  as possible.
[1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:15.280]  So just in the last two and a half minutes, what would you like to depart with?
[1:52:15.280 --> 1:52:18.640]  What do you want your final words to be here?
[1:52:18.640 --> 1:52:24.320]  So what I really want to get out to people is really, you need to start motivating yourself.
[1:52:24.320 --> 1:52:28.200]  We have got to get parents to understand this message.
[1:52:28.200 --> 1:52:32.520]  Their child is not to be used as a guinea pig.
[1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:36.920]  Their child should not have the fear that they are bringing home something that might
[1:52:36.920 --> 1:52:37.920]  kill grandma.
[1:52:37.920 --> 1:52:42.760]  That is a complete false statement, and they need to help their kids get through this,
[1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:44.840]  because it's causing emotional damage.
[1:52:44.840 --> 1:52:50.560]  The other problem that we have is you need to be boots on the ground for us.
[1:52:50.560 --> 1:52:54.080]  American frontline doctors, we are throwing lawsuits out there.
[1:52:54.080 --> 1:52:59.880]  We have a lawsuit, a temporary restraining order against vaccinating kids in the 12-15
[1:52:59.880 --> 1:53:01.380]  age group.
[1:53:01.380 --> 1:53:07.320]  It's stalled in the courts, but we need really to have citizens all around our country stand
[1:53:07.320 --> 1:53:13.000]  up for us and help us get these messages out through the Citizen Corps of American Frontline
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  Doctors.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:17.520]  There are plenty of places that you can get early effective treatment, and that's also
[1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:19.440]  a big theme.
[1:53:19.440 --> 1:53:21.760]  Understand there is treatment out there.
[1:53:21.760 --> 1:53:26.440]  Understand that even with spike protein syndrome, you can help protect yourself.
[1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:29.800]  Understand that the government is not here to help you in this particular instance at
[1:53:29.800 --> 1:53:30.800]  all.
[1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:31.800]  That's another angle.
[1:53:31.800 --> 1:53:39.480]  They censored the reports on hydroxychloroquine working, vitamin C, zinc, ivermectin.
[1:53:39.480 --> 1:53:40.480]  It's just unbelievable.
[1:53:40.480 --> 1:53:47.800]  But they've also done things sneaky, like they've also pulled off the market and end
[1:53:47.800 --> 1:53:49.920]  gestal, which is something that helps your lungs.
[1:53:49.920 --> 1:53:52.640]  It's an IV medication I use in my IVs.
[1:53:52.640 --> 1:53:53.800]  They pulled that off the market.
[1:53:53.800 --> 1:53:57.120]  They're blocking it from being imported from Germany, because guess what?
[1:53:57.120 --> 1:53:58.120]  It works.
[1:53:58.120 --> 1:54:02.960]  They also just recently pulled NAC off the market and acetylcystine.
[1:54:02.960 --> 1:54:04.200]  They just pulled it off the market.
[1:54:04.200 --> 1:54:06.600]  It used to be on over the counter.
[1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:07.600]  It's a supplement.
[1:54:07.600 --> 1:54:09.100]  It was there for years and years and years.
[1:54:09.100 --> 1:54:10.840]  Now all of a sudden, they're pulling it.
[1:54:10.840 --> 1:54:12.160]  There's no reason to pull it.
[1:54:12.160 --> 1:54:14.160]  There's no safety problem with it.
[1:54:14.160 --> 1:54:15.680]  Why are they pulling it?
[1:54:15.680 --> 1:54:18.360]  Well, strangely enough, guess what NAC does?
[1:54:18.360 --> 1:54:21.360]  NAC protects you from spike protein syndrome.
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:22.360]  Ah.
[1:54:22.360 --> 1:54:23.440]  Wow.
[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:28.320]  And so again, I'm not putting these words in the doctor's mouth.
[1:54:28.320 --> 1:54:30.160]  Dr. Angelina Ferrella, thank you so much.
[1:54:30.160 --> 1:54:31.160]  This is a powerful interview.
[1:54:31.160 --> 1:54:32.960]  We need as many eyes and ears on this as possible.
[1:54:32.960 --> 1:54:38.720]  But folks, you do all the math, and I understand it's a tough realization to come to, but someone's
[1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:40.800]  trying to kill us, OK?
[1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:43.640]  They're putting this vaccine out there, and they're stopping us from getting the actual
[1:54:43.640 --> 1:54:44.640]  cures.
[1:54:44.640 --> 1:54:49.920]  Info wars is here because there's a war on for your mind.
[1:54:49.920 --> 1:54:54.200]  That's why I spent our motto for more than 25 years, and if you research even the UN's
[1:54:54.200 --> 1:55:01.000]  own admissions, over 2 billion people of planet Earth out of 7.5 billion have cognitive disabilities.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.520]  Lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:07.680]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food, isn't in the salt anymore.
[1:55:07.680 --> 1:55:13.320]  Now, regular iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals, and so it's
[1:55:13.320 --> 1:55:14.320]  hard for your body to absorb.
[1:55:14.320 --> 1:55:18.840]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's 3 types that are good for the body,
[1:55:18.840 --> 1:55:19.840]  it does amazing things.
[1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:21.340]  It's essential in the body.
[1:55:21.340 --> 1:55:26.160]  But we have our amazing tri-iodine, a big shipment came in, and so we're able to offer
[1:55:26.160 --> 1:55:28.920]  it at the lowest price ever, 60% off.
[1:55:28.920 --> 1:55:34.560]  That is, survival shield X3, 60% off with 3 types of powerful iodine.
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:39.120]  Tri-iodine is from a patented process that stabilizes the iodine and makes it even more
[1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:40.920]  powerful to sell at your level.
[1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:46.280]  You and your family will love it, it's incredible for your body, get it info or short.com today.
[1:55:46.280 --> 1:55:49.320]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[1:55:49.320 --> 1:55:50.320]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:54.640]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason, and amongst all
[1:55:54.640 --> 1:55:58.640]  this stupidity, wanted to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year,
[1:55:58.640 --> 1:55:59.640]  okay?
[1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:05.760]  I'm Matthew T, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:07.280]  Living defense saved my life.
[1:56:07.280 --> 1:56:11.600]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:13.040]  Living defense brought me back.
[1:56:13.040 --> 1:56:18.760]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:25.760]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill
[1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:32.480]  you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake, and then shall many be offended
[1:56:32.480 --> 1:56:35.760]  and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:37.600]  That's right where we're at brother.
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:42.040]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:49.240]  and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:57.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:56:57.040 --> 1:57:11.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, seriously, I've done a lot of big interviews in my short
[1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:14.000]  time here on earth and my short time here in the media.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:16.120]  That's definitely one of the most powerful interviews I've done.
[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:24.760]  I think bright top five and so please we're going to put a story up at info wars.com.
[1:57:24.760 --> 1:57:29.320]  And we're going to put the videos at band.video and it's going to have the headline full interview.
[1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:33.000]  Doctor warns the world of covid vaccines and I want that in a story on the front page of
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:36.760]  info wars.com and that needs to make sure that we have that on the front page of band
[1:57:36.760 --> 1:57:43.160]  out video too because again, but we know all this is going on.
[1:57:43.160 --> 1:57:44.160]  I get it.
[1:57:44.160 --> 1:57:47.640]  Info wars, if you've been watching, we've been reporting on this for a year and a half.
[1:57:47.640 --> 1:57:51.880]  Yes, even that the deadly vaccines were coming.
[1:57:51.880 --> 1:57:57.280]  And so when you start seeing the awakening happening in real time with doctors like this,
[1:57:57.280 --> 1:58:00.440]  you don't want to, you want them to learn all this for themselves.
[1:58:00.440 --> 1:58:01.640]  They're smart people.
[1:58:01.640 --> 1:58:03.080]  They're witnessing all of this now.
[1:58:03.080 --> 1:58:06.280]  They're going to land on the conclusions eventually.
[1:58:06.280 --> 1:58:10.600]  But you see, I lived through this as well where I would be in denial of all of this.
[1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:13.240]  And when somebody would try to warn me, I just stubbornly turned my head.
[1:58:13.240 --> 1:58:18.040]  But then when you experience it yourself, the walls break down intellectually in your
[1:58:18.040 --> 1:58:19.040]  own head.
[1:58:19.040 --> 1:58:25.920]  So, but let me do this as a juxtaposition as we pivot back to what's happening at the
[1:58:25.920 --> 1:58:26.920]  border.
[1:58:26.920 --> 1:58:29.960]  Cause it's like, I mean, oh, if a first hour they're trafficking children at the border
[1:58:29.960 --> 1:58:34.360]  and then second hour, they're killing us with the vaccines and it's all real.
[1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:37.280]  And no one else will tell you what's going on for whatever reason.
[1:58:37.280 --> 1:58:42.720]  You can make your judgments about why everyone else in the media is a coward or sell out whatever.
[1:58:42.720 --> 1:58:52.960]  Here is a video from a gas station in Utah where a woman gets kidnapped in broad daylight
[1:58:52.960 --> 1:58:57.800]  and is screaming for help and no one comes to rescue her.
[1:58:57.800 --> 1:59:03.040]  Now, I'm going to play this report and I'm going to explain this phenomenon and how it
[1:59:03.040 --> 1:59:04.520]  ties into what's going at the southern border.
[1:59:04.520 --> 1:59:08.600]  So here is the news report woman kidnapped in broad daylight.
[1:59:08.600 --> 1:59:09.600]  Nobody helps her.
[1:59:09.600 --> 1:59:15.160]  And if you see that, what would you think?
[1:59:15.160 --> 1:59:16.640]  Last night, police got a call.
[1:59:16.640 --> 1:59:19.240]  A woman, possibly a teenager, was kidnapped.
[1:59:19.240 --> 1:59:23.960]  A couple of witnesses reported hearing her yell, help, please help me.
[1:59:23.960 --> 1:59:28.960]  That's when this man enters a picture chasing after her as she crawls under a bystander's
[1:59:28.960 --> 1:59:29.960]  truck.
[1:59:29.960 --> 1:59:30.960]  She drags her out.
[1:59:30.960 --> 1:59:33.200]  She was taken from underneath the vehicle.
[1:59:33.200 --> 1:59:36.320]  She was hoisted up over onto a shoulder.
[1:59:36.320 --> 1:59:44.280]  She was kicking, crying for help, asking for help, and she was pushed back into a vehicle.
[1:59:44.280 --> 1:59:47.240]  Yet police suspect the bystander did nothing to help.
[1:59:47.240 --> 1:59:53.320]  We were really, I had a hard time trying to locate the people that were there.
[1:59:53.320 --> 1:59:57.920]  As police work to locate that key witness, drivers like Charles Albert, who got the
[1:59:57.920 --> 2:00:00.560]  Amber Alert, are still concerned.
[2:00:00.560 --> 2:00:03.560]  To be that involved where he rips her out from underneath the vehicle and he doesn't
[2:00:03.560 --> 2:00:06.280]  help her at all, that's not cool.
[2:00:06.280 --> 2:00:10.800]  Police support bystanders stepping in to help, but say it's a personal choice.
[2:00:10.800 --> 2:00:13.400]  You have to go with what you feel comfortable doing.
[2:00:13.400 --> 2:00:16.040]  But if you see something, say something.
[2:00:16.040 --> 2:00:18.280]  Please help us get a license plate number.
[2:00:18.280 --> 2:00:22.280]  Please help us get a good description of the suspect or the victim.
[2:00:22.280 --> 2:00:25.240]  Yet police say they had a lot of community support.
[2:00:25.240 --> 2:00:31.480]  We even had family members calling in to identify who the perpetrator was in that video.
[2:00:31.480 --> 2:00:36.800]  Finding the detectives who ID 22-year-old Carl Gravitt as a suspect, police say finding
[2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:40.840]  the 35-year-old victim alive was a community effort.
[2:00:40.840 --> 2:00:43.160]  We have somebody in custody that is behind us.
[2:00:43.160 --> 2:00:44.160]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:00:44.160 --> 2:00:46.400]  If you're watching this, you see it's a crowded gas station.
[2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:48.160]  There's at least half a dozen cars.
[2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:49.160]  There are people there.
[2:00:49.160 --> 2:00:50.160]  She's screaming.
[2:00:50.160 --> 2:00:51.160]  It's all on tape.
[2:00:51.160 --> 2:00:54.200]  I mean, individuals, and they do nothing.
[2:00:54.200 --> 2:00:55.680]  They do nothing.
[2:00:55.680 --> 2:00:58.840]  Now, again, people see that and they're like, this is incredible.
[2:00:58.840 --> 2:01:00.240]  How could you not do anything?
[2:01:00.240 --> 2:01:01.240]  And so here's the juxtaposition.
[2:01:01.240 --> 2:01:06.120]  It's just like the Britney Spears thing, like, oh, Britney Spears has medical tyranny.
[2:01:06.120 --> 2:01:07.720]  Britney Spears is dealing with medical tyranny.
[2:01:07.720 --> 2:01:08.720]  This is wrong.
[2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:09.720]  You can't have that.
[2:01:09.720 --> 2:01:12.400]  We're all dealing with medical tyranny right now.
[2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:15.640]  But see, so, oh, everybody sees, why wouldn't you help this girl?
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:16.840]  She's obviously being kidnapped.
[2:01:16.840 --> 2:01:17.840]  She's screaming.
[2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:18.840]  Ask her to help.
[2:01:18.840 --> 2:01:19.840]  Nobody helps her.
[2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:20.840]  What?
[2:01:20.840 --> 2:01:24.120]  You say that's messed up, but that's what's going on at the southern border.
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:28.320]  So you see, it's this weird thing where we can't make these connections and we have
[2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:32.760]  these, like, walls of what we'll put up with and what we won't, what we'll admit is bad
[2:01:32.760 --> 2:01:34.200]  and what we won't.
[2:01:34.200 --> 2:01:38.960]  They're kidnapping kids and trafficking them across the southern border.
[2:01:38.960 --> 2:01:44.160]  And it's like, Alex Jones, InfoWars has the instinct to step in and do something, unlike
[2:01:44.160 --> 2:01:48.560]  all the people at that gas station that sat by and watched a woman get kidnapped.
[2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:53.680]  We're not going to watch children get trafficked across our border, damn it.
[2:01:53.680 --> 2:01:58.800]  The 4th of July Super Sale starts now at infowarsstores.com.

[2:02:53.320 --> 2:03:18.560]  Alright, I'm just overwhelmed here and I've been on air for two hours and I've got stacks
[2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:23.120]  of news on my desk that I don't even know if I'm going to be able to get to them and they're
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:26.240]  all huge.
[2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:36.480]  But we've got the footage now, the raw footage of Alex Jones and crew arriving at the scene
[2:03:36.480 --> 2:03:39.120]  this morning in McAllen, Texas.
[2:03:39.120 --> 2:03:42.760]  And again, because you know, they always like to make the arguments, oh, info wars edits
[2:03:42.760 --> 2:03:46.000]  and cuts and cherry picks, all this stuff, no we don't, no we don't.
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:49.200]  And when we used to be able to go live on YouTube and Twitter and Facebook, we'd be
[2:03:49.200 --> 2:03:53.040]  able to prove that in real time, but they've blocked us from having that access.
[2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:56.040]  They couldn't have us on air when they were trying to kill us all.
[2:03:56.040 --> 2:03:59.760]  So they went ahead and banned us, but that's what we're in right now.
[2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:04.240]  But so this is the raw footage and I'm just going to do commentary over this b-roll and
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:09.920]  try my best here for radio audience and the TV audience.
[2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:13.720]  Thank God I have a background in play-by-play, I suppose, and color commentary to do this,
[2:04:13.720 --> 2:04:18.400]  but we're just going to roll this and I'm going to do my best play-by-play color commentary
[2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:24.640]  as we see the crew pulling up on the scene in McAllen, Texas, where the Joe Biden child
[2:04:24.640 --> 2:04:27.360]  sex trafficking operation is underway.
[2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:28.560]  And so here we go, guys.
[2:04:28.560 --> 2:04:32.240]  Let's start with the footage right now.
[2:04:32.240 --> 2:04:38.280]  We're here in McAllen, Texas and the so-called Catholic Charities around the Democratic Party
[2:04:38.280 --> 2:04:46.160]  and George Soros funding, literally by a UN NGO, the same NGO that ran the operations
[2:04:46.160 --> 2:04:50.680]  opening up the borders of Europe to the Islamic invasion.
[2:04:50.680 --> 2:04:55.420]  First only had this building right here, where we famously confronted the gentleman illegally
[2:04:55.420 --> 2:04:59.040]  putting three children in the trunk of a car.
[2:04:59.040 --> 2:05:05.200]  Now they have rented this facility that used to be called Hollywood fashion, a clothing
[2:05:05.200 --> 2:05:06.200]  store.
[2:05:06.200 --> 2:05:13.120]  And as you can see right here, there are more folks in the assembly line right here.
[2:05:13.120 --> 2:05:18.680]  You see those packets that we loaded on airplanes or private charter, and then they're put on
[2:05:18.680 --> 2:05:24.000]  these buses, and this just continues around the clock totally illegal, the border absolutely
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  completely open.
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:34.840]  And so again, this is a new expansion of the already one city block full wide facility
[2:05:34.840 --> 2:05:36.920]  that they had last time we were in McAllen.
[2:05:36.920 --> 2:05:40.240]  Now they have another facility right across the street.
[2:05:40.240 --> 2:05:44.760]  We told you, we got the information that yes, they had bought that facility and were planning
[2:05:44.760 --> 2:05:50.000]  on expanding their human smuggling operation into that facility.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:54.560]  And then when we brought that up to the people in the building, they said, no, no, no, no,
[2:05:54.560 --> 2:05:55.560]  no, that's not happening.
[2:05:55.560 --> 2:05:56.560]  No, no, no, no.
[2:05:56.560 --> 2:06:02.440]  Well, we go back down there a couple months later and there it is indeed happening right
[2:06:02.440 --> 2:06:03.640]  before our very eyes.
[2:06:03.640 --> 2:06:07.080]  So again, we don't, there's no, you don't even have to stage this.
[2:06:07.080 --> 2:06:08.280]  You don't have to plan anything.
[2:06:08.280 --> 2:06:13.280]  You go in, you just park your car, and right out of the gates, human smuggling is going
[2:06:13.280 --> 2:06:14.280]  on.
[2:06:14.280 --> 2:06:18.960]  I mean, it's like, if I've got tickets to a ball game and I go set down to the basketball
[2:06:18.960 --> 2:06:22.120]  game and guys are shooting basketball, it's like, yeah, that's what you expect.
[2:06:22.120 --> 2:06:23.120]  That's basically what this is.
[2:06:23.120 --> 2:06:24.800]  Hey, I'm going to watch the human smuggling.
[2:06:24.800 --> 2:06:25.800]  Let's go back to Alex Jones.
[2:06:25.800 --> 2:06:33.560]  Ready and boom, this facility, which just a month ago, they leased is now full of people
[2:06:33.560 --> 2:06:37.040]  from the door swung open and these people were filed out.
[2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:43.840]  I saw more than 50 people, men, women and children inside right now.
[2:06:43.840 --> 2:06:50.160]  And now they've rented buildings up and down the street on both sides of the street.
[2:06:50.160 --> 2:06:52.960]  So again, a lot of people when I stopped that car, because they were illegally putting three
[2:06:52.960 --> 2:06:58.880]  children in the trunk, they said, oh, it must be fake because it says Hollywood on this
[2:06:58.880 --> 2:07:02.640]  old building that I guess decades ago had some type of clothing store.
[2:07:02.640 --> 2:07:03.640]  Oh, this is a real place.
[2:07:03.640 --> 2:07:04.640]  McAllen, Texas.
[2:07:04.640 --> 2:07:05.640]  This is real.
[2:07:05.640 --> 2:07:07.760]  It's going on right here.
[2:07:07.760 --> 2:07:12.200]  And it's it's all illegal, but Biden is not enforcing federal law and these counties are
[2:07:12.200 --> 2:07:16.400]  even bucking the state governor Abbott, who's declared an emergency here and called it state
[2:07:16.400 --> 2:07:21.880]  police from around the country to try to arrest people when they do violate the law like trespassing
[2:07:21.880 --> 2:07:24.160]  on people's property or any type of theft.
[2:07:24.160 --> 2:07:25.160]  So here you go.
[2:07:25.160 --> 2:07:38.520]  This is a emergency response team, state assisted EMS support vehicle, state placard ID.
[2:07:38.520 --> 2:07:39.880]  What does this even mean?
[2:07:39.880 --> 2:07:43.840]  Again, who who are these organizations?
[2:07:43.840 --> 2:07:45.720]  We need to find out about all of this.
[2:07:45.720 --> 2:07:46.720]  We need to investigate.
[2:07:46.720 --> 2:07:51.200]  Here's another one pulling up to get more people.
[2:07:51.200 --> 2:07:53.600]  Now why is this important?
[2:07:53.600 --> 2:07:54.600]  For hundreds of reasons.
[2:07:54.600 --> 2:07:59.640]  When you allow this type of illegal activity to go on an industrial scale, it allows criminals
[2:07:59.640 --> 2:08:01.320]  to bring in drugs to that children.
[2:08:01.320 --> 2:08:02.320]  You name it.
[2:08:02.320 --> 2:08:06.160]  We have video at the airports of the same woman day after day delivering children saying
[2:08:06.160 --> 2:08:10.880]  this is my child babies, they're allowed to fly just handing them off to people, handing
[2:08:10.880 --> 2:08:13.840]  them off to NGOs and then these children just disappeared.
[2:08:13.840 --> 2:08:14.840]  My sister's adopted.
[2:08:14.840 --> 2:08:17.960]  It took us two years to adopt her from South Korea.
[2:08:17.960 --> 2:08:19.600]  They had to go through all the background checks.
[2:08:19.600 --> 2:08:23.920]  They had to check us out and we had to pay a lot of money and they had to make sure that
[2:08:23.920 --> 2:08:28.560]  they weren't taking a child from a woman that wasn't trying to give the child up.
[2:08:28.560 --> 2:08:33.160]  And there should be a lot of strictures and rules and laws of adoption.
[2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:37.200]  This is again, industrial scale taking place.
[2:08:37.200 --> 2:08:44.280]  And again, they're obviously about to load this back up and then leave as well.
[2:08:44.280 --> 2:08:49.320]  Again, you've got these people in their supposed security guard outfits and this is all just
[2:08:49.320 --> 2:08:50.320]  an outfit.
[2:08:50.320 --> 2:08:58.360]  It's just dressing it up with the appearance of legality, you know, so they've got little
[2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:06.880]  armed guards out here conducting this human trafficking at an industrial scale.
[2:09:06.880 --> 2:09:11.000]  That's why Kamala Harris, for the first five months she was the border czar, wouldn't come
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  down here.
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  She didn't come to McCallum.
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:14.600]  She didn't come to the real border checkpoint.
[2:09:14.600 --> 2:09:15.840]  She went to El Paso.
[2:09:15.840 --> 2:09:22.360]  She spent three hours there and then she left.
[2:09:22.360 --> 2:09:25.520]  It was Biden that said if I get elected, immediately surge the border.
[2:09:25.520 --> 2:09:30.840]  Now over a half million people have been apprehended coming through and let go under
[2:09:30.840 --> 2:09:31.840]  Biden.
[2:09:31.840 --> 2:09:35.560]  They estimate as much as three times more or a million and a half more in just the last
[2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:37.360]  five, six months have come through as well.
[2:09:37.360 --> 2:09:46.080]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, what you have is industrial, industrial scale activity now
[2:09:46.080 --> 2:09:50.800]  where they bring them in across the border, who they are is not checked.
[2:09:50.800 --> 2:09:54.160]  They are brought here by the border patrol after they're smuggled across.
[2:09:54.160 --> 2:09:58.840]  The board patrol's own union says we now complete the smuggling process into the U.S.
[2:09:58.840 --> 2:10:04.840]  They then hand off to the so-called Catholic charity, this is just one building of many,
[2:10:04.840 --> 2:10:12.280]  so then load up these vans and the people then disappear into the interior of the country
[2:10:12.280 --> 2:10:16.640]  where they're given new identities, where they're then signed up by Democrat Party sponsor
[2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:18.360]  families who farm them.
[2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:24.680]  So just like Democrats farm homeless and say come to our city and then they live in cities,
[2:10:24.680 --> 2:10:30.600]  but Democrat social workers, private and governmental, sign them up for a bunch of welfare and then
[2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:32.600]  milk that off the top.
[2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:39.280]  So you've heard of farmers that farm corn or soybeans or wheat or vegetables like green
[2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:40.480]  beans.
[2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:45.040]  These people farm humans and so they bring in these exploitable third-world populations.
[2:10:45.040 --> 2:10:51.680]  Now, another big reason we're here today is President Trump is coming to the border facilities
[2:10:51.680 --> 2:10:57.560]  here in South Texas today and a tour, several of them, and we're just here documenting that
[2:10:57.560 --> 2:11:05.600]  while he's busy checking those out, the real serious issues are going on right under his
[2:11:05.600 --> 2:11:10.040]  nose and that the board patrol again is on record saying they are there to complete the
[2:11:10.040 --> 2:11:11.040]  smuggling process.
[2:11:11.040 --> 2:11:16.200]  And so that's what's going on ladies and gentlemen, all of it blacked out so you don't know what's
[2:11:16.200 --> 2:11:22.880]  going on with the women and the children predominantly and as you can see right over here, this is
[2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:35.640]  a whole other building and it just goes on and on and on.
[2:11:35.640 --> 2:11:40.600]  So he's crossing the street to the other facility right now and again, this is the one that
[2:11:40.600 --> 2:11:44.440]  we've already covered that's huge, an entire city block.
[2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:50.920]  It sounds like it's a party going on in there, just a huge facility goes on for about 80
[2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:58.440]  yards, just completely jam-packed and filled with human trafficked souls.
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:04.520]  This is the modern slavery being signed up for the Democratic Party, UN, global plantation,
[2:12:04.520 --> 2:12:12.000]  and they use our laws against no trespassing and our primacy laws that then tell us to
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:17.400]  stay off their supposed property and they also use the mast that everyone's still wearing
[2:12:17.400 --> 2:12:21.280]  down here to even cover up the identities of who these people are.
[2:12:21.280 --> 2:12:22.920]  So the magnitude of this is incredible.
[2:12:22.920 --> 2:12:27.640]  So they trespass on our country, they're organized by the UN.
[2:12:27.640 --> 2:12:32.280]  Trump in 2017 pulled us out of the UN treaty that we never actually signed on to but we
[2:12:32.280 --> 2:12:35.600]  were under, we were following, where the UN decides who could come in.
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:42.400]  Well the UN just blank check says all these people are refugees fleeing poverty so they
[2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:43.400]  could come to...
[2:12:43.400 --> 2:12:46.520]  Alright yeah, fleeing communism, fleeing socialism, fleeing leftism.
[2:12:46.520 --> 2:12:55.120]  Alright, when we come back, more from Alex Jones at the US Government Trafficking Facility.
[2:12:55.120 --> 2:12:59.760]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:08.480]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[2:13:08.480 --> 2:13:18.040]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves, worst
[2:13:18.040 --> 2:13:25.280]  of slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system, rendered down to be servile
[2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:30.200]  minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[2:13:30.200 --> 2:13:35.440]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia
[2:13:35.440 --> 2:13:39.560]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[2:13:39.560 --> 2:13:44.480]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world.
[2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:48.840]  And it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[2:13:48.840 --> 2:13:53.520]  It is a spiritual battle, an info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[2:13:53.520 --> 2:13:59.960]  The equation is very simple, the mega banks control the media, they control big pharma,
[2:13:59.960 --> 2:14:05.280]  they control academia, they control the military, industrial complex, they control big pharma,
[2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:10.400]  they control big tech, and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world
[2:14:10.400 --> 2:14:15.280]  they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[2:14:15.280 --> 2:14:21.720]  It is the western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted
[2:14:21.720 --> 2:14:24.640]  women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[2:14:24.640 --> 2:14:30.160]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside
[2:14:30.160 --> 2:14:37.560]  down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[2:14:37.560 --> 2:14:40.440]  that threatens them and off the list of control.
[2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:44.520]  That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[2:14:44.520 --> 2:14:50.200]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[2:14:50.200 --> 2:15:14.760]  We're back here on the Alex Jones show, Owen Troyer sitting in studio here for Alex, he's
[2:15:14.760 --> 2:15:15.760]  down in McAllen.
[2:15:15.760 --> 2:15:23.760]  We're going to go back to this video, but folks, let me just tell you, we broke the
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:29.920]  bank for this coverage at the southern border.
[2:15:29.920 --> 2:15:36.440]  We are pretty much on the razor's edge right now financially to keep this thing afloat
[2:15:36.440 --> 2:15:44.000]  and we don't say that with our hat out panhandling here, that's just the truth and that's kind
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:51.360]  of been Alex's attitude for this is, shoot the moon, whatever fuel we have, that's how
[2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:57.240]  far we're going and then just hope that the audience keeps filling our tank every day,
[2:15:57.240 --> 2:15:58.240]  basically.
[2:15:58.240 --> 2:16:02.680]  So folks, go to infowarstore.com and get this brand new t-shirt.
[2:16:02.680 --> 2:16:10.440]  I absolutely love it, the free American camo version and you'll notice and I asked the
[2:16:10.440 --> 2:16:11.840]  guys to fix this.
[2:16:11.840 --> 2:16:13.120]  I don't know if they're going to do it.
[2:16:13.120 --> 2:16:18.560]  But the image that we have on infowarstore.com of this free American camo t-shirt is not
[2:16:18.560 --> 2:16:20.160]  the actual image.
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:24.000]  The real image is the shirt that I'm wearing right now that you can see.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:27.440]  This is the actual color of the camouflage.
[2:16:27.440 --> 2:16:31.560]  This is the actual design of the camouflage that you see that I'm wearing right now, not
[2:16:31.560 --> 2:16:32.560]  the one on the website.
[2:16:32.560 --> 2:16:36.120]  This is a much better design than what we have on the website, so I don't know why we
[2:16:36.120 --> 2:16:37.120]  still have that one up.
[2:16:37.120 --> 2:16:42.120]  But this is the actual free American camo design t-shirt that I'm wearing.
[2:16:42.120 --> 2:16:47.120]  This is one of the only things that we can consistently keep in stock right now is t-shirts.
[2:16:47.120 --> 2:16:49.240]  And people are really liking to save the frogs t-shirt.
[2:16:49.240 --> 2:16:53.320]  I think you're really going to love the free American t-shirt, whether it's the black, whether
[2:16:53.320 --> 2:16:57.880]  it's the navy, or whether it's my personal favorite camouflage that I have on today.
[2:16:57.880 --> 2:16:58.880]  I'm a huge fan.
[2:16:58.880 --> 2:16:59.880]  I love it.
[2:16:59.880 --> 2:17:00.880]  It's very soft.
[2:17:00.880 --> 2:17:01.880]  I love the fit.
[2:17:01.880 --> 2:17:03.040]  And of course, the design is great, too.
[2:17:03.040 --> 2:17:06.880]  So this is one of the ways that you can support us financially right now is getting t-shirts,
[2:17:06.880 --> 2:17:11.120]  supplements, sell out and come and go and we do what we can to keep them stock.
[2:17:11.120 --> 2:17:15.160]  But it's a lot easier to keep the t-shirts in stock and sell those.
[2:17:15.160 --> 2:17:18.640]  And so please support us by getting the t-shirts at infowarstore.com.
[2:17:18.640 --> 2:17:24.120]  You're going to love the free American camo t-shirt that I am wearing here today.
[2:17:24.120 --> 2:17:30.920]  Let's go back to Alex Jones at the Biden U.S. government human smuggling trafficking
[2:17:30.920 --> 2:17:33.120]  operation in McAllen, Texas.
[2:17:33.120 --> 2:17:37.600]  We never actually signed on to it, but we were under, we were following, where the U.N.
[2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:38.600]  decides who could come in.
[2:17:38.600 --> 2:17:45.520]  Well, the U.N. just blank check says all these people are refugees fleeing poverty so they
[2:17:45.520 --> 2:17:49.600]  could come to the United States and then demand all the free welfare and again be clients
[2:17:49.600 --> 2:17:50.600]  of the system.
[2:17:50.600 --> 2:17:56.560]  So this is, this is the breaking of the United States and bringing in the permanent underclass.
[2:17:56.560 --> 2:17:59.120]  Let's bring Tim Enlow over here, Tim.
[2:17:59.120 --> 2:18:03.760]  Why don't you explain to the viewers and listeners just some of the background and some of the
[2:18:03.760 --> 2:18:09.120]  other key points so that they understand the magnitude of the illegality of this.
[2:18:09.120 --> 2:18:10.120]  Right.
[2:18:10.120 --> 2:18:17.400]  So just as an example, when Border Patrol Del Rio sector about three weeks ago released
[2:18:17.400 --> 2:18:26.320]  their numbers for May, in the Del Rio sector alone, Border Patrol had stopped 174,000 illegal
[2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:27.320]  aliens.
[2:18:27.320 --> 2:18:28.320]  Okay.
[2:18:28.320 --> 2:18:31.400]  That's in one month, in one sector on the U.S. border.
[2:18:31.400 --> 2:18:34.840]  Now we know, Tim, lead us over here, it's happening again right now.
[2:18:34.840 --> 2:18:35.840]  Well, right.
[2:18:35.840 --> 2:18:41.200]  So this is, these are some of the people that are bringing out of this new facility that
[2:18:41.200 --> 2:18:42.200]  they just leased.
[2:18:42.200 --> 2:18:46.960]  Again, these folks are going to be, ladies and gentlemen, it's all children, it's all
[2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:47.960]  children.
[2:18:47.960 --> 2:18:49.960]  They're going to be taken to a destination city of their choice.
[2:18:49.960 --> 2:18:51.960]  Not even an adult with them, just all children.
[2:18:51.960 --> 2:18:55.480]  Since we started rolling nine minutes ago, this is the third load being loaded up.
[2:18:55.480 --> 2:18:58.000]  Now, these children are not in car seats, you notice.
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:00.880]  Now the interesting thing is, this is supposedly a Catholic charity.
[2:19:00.880 --> 2:19:05.920]  Now let's count the security personnel that they're bringing out to put this family into
[2:19:05.920 --> 2:19:06.920]  the van.
[2:19:06.920 --> 2:19:09.960]  You've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[2:19:09.960 --> 2:19:10.960]  Seven security personnel.
[2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:15.680]  Because this is an important cargo for Democrats to farm and milk the welfare they're going
[2:19:15.680 --> 2:19:17.200]  to sign this human shadow up for.
[2:19:17.200 --> 2:19:18.400]  This is slavery.
[2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:21.360]  And imagine the cost involved, right?
[2:19:21.360 --> 2:19:26.280]  Imagine seven security personnel that got to be paid on an hourly basis to sit there
[2:19:26.280 --> 2:19:29.080]  and transport these people and make sure they're protected.
[2:19:29.080 --> 2:19:34.240]  So they're literally protecting illegal aliens as they're taking them to the airport.
[2:19:34.240 --> 2:19:38.280]  Let me just pause this real quick to explain something here, folks.
[2:19:38.280 --> 2:19:39.280]  Okay.
[2:19:39.280 --> 2:19:40.280]  Why?
[2:19:40.280 --> 2:19:43.440]  I mean, the movie's depict this, but this is the reality.
[2:19:43.440 --> 2:19:48.200]  Why do you see, oh, it's a major drug deal, oh, it's a major arms deal, oh, it's a major
[2:19:48.200 --> 2:19:53.480]  this, it's a major that, major criminal activity, and what is always the common thread?
[2:19:53.480 --> 2:19:59.040]  Armed security, armed guards, protecting the criminals, protecting the criminal activity,
[2:19:59.040 --> 2:20:01.160]  protecting the criminal loot.
[2:20:01.160 --> 2:20:06.800]  So that's what you're seeing right here in McAllen, Texas, protecting the loot, protecting
[2:20:06.800 --> 2:20:10.600]  the commodity, protecting the smuggled children.
[2:20:10.600 --> 2:20:16.920]  And they do it all with this masquerade of, oh, we're helping refugees and everything.
[2:20:16.920 --> 2:20:19.680]  I'm just stunned.
[2:20:19.680 --> 2:20:21.800]  Let's go back to the video.
[2:20:21.800 --> 2:20:27.280]  Their choice with no documentation other than whatever they told Board of Patrol their
[2:20:27.280 --> 2:20:28.640]  name is, right?
[2:20:28.640 --> 2:20:30.920]  That is literally what's going on right now.
[2:20:30.920 --> 2:20:35.000]  You can see it's happening by the van load five minutes ago, one van pulled off.
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:38.920]  Now the next van is being loaded up and then pretty soon there'll be another one.
[2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:43.440]  Now the interesting thing is, when we drove in, we noticed that the COVID testing site
[2:20:43.440 --> 2:20:45.320]  had been removed, okay?
[2:20:45.320 --> 2:20:49.640]  So before Board of Patrol was dropping them at the COVID testing site, then the Catholic
[2:20:49.640 --> 2:20:54.040]  charity here would walk up there, march them down the street, march them into their facility,
[2:20:54.040 --> 2:20:58.320]  get them plane tickets, and put them on planes to the interior of the United States.
[2:20:58.320 --> 2:21:03.360]  The COVID testing site is now removed, which tells us now they're not even testing for
[2:21:03.360 --> 2:21:04.600]  COVID anymore.
[2:21:04.600 --> 2:21:10.320]  So hundreds of thousands of illegals coming across the border, not being tested, no background
[2:21:10.320 --> 2:21:11.320]  check being done.
[2:21:11.320 --> 2:21:13.880]  And here's another key point to add.
[2:21:13.880 --> 2:21:16.800]  A few months ago, we're out here and we see the man putting the three children in the
[2:21:16.800 --> 2:21:19.440]  trunk, which is illegal, so we stopped them.
[2:21:19.440 --> 2:21:24.840]  Now they're loading these children in again without child seats again, and we saw it happening
[2:21:24.840 --> 2:21:28.000]  with the other vehicle as well.
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:32.960]  So again, this is a total waving of the law at every level.
[2:21:32.960 --> 2:21:36.960]  Notice they're now calling themselves in the buildings disaster relief vehicles.
[2:21:36.960 --> 2:21:40.480]  So you know, the Texas governor has declared an emergency down here.
[2:21:40.480 --> 2:21:44.680]  What do you bet that they're getting some of the Texas emergency money to stop the imploded
[2:21:44.680 --> 2:21:50.920]  border that Biden created, and that they're actually using disaster money for the smuggling?
[2:21:50.920 --> 2:21:52.720]  And by the way, guys, pause again.
[2:21:52.720 --> 2:21:55.400]  This is well known that the UN does this.
[2:21:55.400 --> 2:21:56.680]  They've been caught.
[2:21:56.680 --> 2:22:03.440]  The UN will go into an area, declare it a disaster zone, and then run child sex trafficking
[2:22:03.440 --> 2:22:05.240]  out of that declared disaster zone.
[2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:06.240]  They've been caught.
[2:22:06.240 --> 2:22:12.120]  They've had, we've had raids where agents that are special forces to go stop children
[2:22:12.120 --> 2:22:15.640]  from being sex trafficked, and they go raid UN facilities.
[2:22:15.640 --> 2:22:18.840]  They've released the body footage and the UN people scatter like rats and then all these
[2:22:18.840 --> 2:22:19.840]  little kids are around.
[2:22:19.840 --> 2:22:22.400]  This is just, this is unbelievable this is going on.
[2:22:22.400 --> 2:22:23.400]  Let's go back.
[2:22:23.400 --> 2:22:29.560]  Yes, but again, the globalist, the UN create an emergency.
[2:22:29.560 --> 2:22:35.240]  They create an emergency and then they get all our tax money to create even bigger emergency
[2:22:35.240 --> 2:22:36.640]  just like with the homeless.
[2:22:36.640 --> 2:22:37.640]  That's the plan.
[2:22:37.640 --> 2:22:41.880]  Tim, tell them the rest of the stories, explain and brief folks on the disaster down here.
[2:22:41.880 --> 2:22:45.920]  And now these counties have been opting out and why these folks are wearing, quote, disaster
[2:22:45.920 --> 2:22:46.920]  zone.
[2:22:46.920 --> 2:22:49.920]  And then it says disaster zone on the back of the vehicle.
[2:22:49.920 --> 2:22:55.480]  In fact, look right here before they pull out.
[2:22:55.480 --> 2:22:58.400]  See right here.
[2:22:58.400 --> 2:22:59.400]  Emergency response team.
[2:22:59.400 --> 2:23:02.680]  Jim, come over here and talk to us on camera.
[2:23:02.680 --> 2:23:03.680]  What do you think this means?
[2:23:03.680 --> 2:23:08.160]  Because they're all wearing emergency response team acting like their official.
[2:23:08.160 --> 2:23:11.880]  They've got guns, the rest of it now I guess to protect the human smuggling operation.
[2:23:11.880 --> 2:23:13.640]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[2:23:13.640 --> 2:23:19.840]  And so what they're doing is they're tapping in to federal funds to sit there and justify
[2:23:19.840 --> 2:23:25.280]  the cost of importing these illegal aliens and sending them to the entire United States.
[2:23:25.280 --> 2:23:30.600]  Now the interesting part is we all know that Governor Abbott issued an emergency declaration
[2:23:30.600 --> 2:23:32.760]  for a lot of the counties down here.
[2:23:32.760 --> 2:23:35.120]  But all right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll stop it right here.
[2:23:35.120 --> 2:23:36.120]  We're about to go to a break.
[2:23:36.120 --> 2:23:41.880]  We'll pick it right back where we left off, but I mean, let's not mince words.
[2:23:41.880 --> 2:23:50.200]  Federal wars is covering a human smuggling child smuggling operation in McAllen, Texas.
[2:23:50.200 --> 2:23:54.960]  I mean, that's what this is.
[2:23:54.960 --> 2:24:01.120]  Your voice counts when you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes
[2:24:01.120 --> 2:24:02.120]  the world.
[2:24:02.120 --> 2:24:04.560]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:24:04.560 --> 2:24:06.080]  They know you're angry.
[2:24:06.080 --> 2:24:10.520]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever to use every tool we've
[2:24:10.520 --> 2:24:11.520]  got.

[2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:00.440]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:25:00.440 --> 2:25:01.440]  Go ahead.
[2:25:01.440 --> 2:25:02.440]  Challenge.
[2:25:02.440 --> 2:25:03.840]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[2:25:03.840 --> 2:25:09.360]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[2:25:09.360 --> 2:25:14.840]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:20.840]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[2:25:20.840 --> 2:25:24.160]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[2:25:24.160 --> 2:25:28.200]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well maybe that's
[2:25:28.200 --> 2:25:32.480]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[2:25:32.480 --> 2:25:37.520]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started
[2:25:37.520 --> 2:25:42.560]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[2:25:42.560 --> 2:25:48.880]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it works wonderfully
[2:25:48.880 --> 2:25:54.080]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:57.160]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[2:25:57.160 --> 2:26:01.760]  The population has been trained to submit to what you're told that's all going to pass.
[2:26:01.760 --> 2:26:05.160]  Because if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that
[2:26:05.160 --> 2:26:08.920]  they reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:10.920]  being cold, being totally enslaved.
[2:26:10.920 --> 2:26:14.520]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[2:26:14.520 --> 2:26:15.520]  that move.
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:19.520]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[2:26:19.520 --> 2:26:25.200]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[2:26:25.200 --> 2:26:30.120]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:35.800]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[2:26:35.800 --> 2:26:40.400]  change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates are saying, but fleeing the
[2:26:40.400 --> 2:26:46.400]  year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute, or they wouldn't
[2:26:46.400 --> 2:26:49.360]  get more IMF and World Bank money.
[2:26:49.360 --> 2:26:53.080]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[2:26:53.080 --> 2:26:58.200]  The Fourth of July Super Sales starts now at importwarstores.com.

[2:27:47.680 --> 2:27:56.280]  The Fourth of July Super Sales starts now at infowarstores.com.
[2:27:56.280 --> 2:28:12.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:17.000]  Back here on the Alex Jones Show, Owen Troyer sitting in.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:18.280]  Alex is in McCallan.
[2:28:18.280 --> 2:28:24.640]  Donald Trump has landed in McCallan and Abbot and Trump are all smiles and everything.
[2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:29.760]  As the Biden human smuggling U.S. government human trafficking facilities are being exposed
[2:28:29.760 --> 2:28:35.160]  by info wars in downtown McCallan, we go back now to the HD footage from Alex Jones breaking
[2:28:35.160 --> 2:28:38.160]  it all down.
[2:28:38.160 --> 2:28:56.160]  Let me stop you so much, it's happening the rest of your security team doesn't come tell
[2:28:56.160 --> 2:28:57.600]  folks real quick what you just saw.
[2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:00.600]  They just smuggled a bunch of people right out of that door while we were talking and
[2:29:00.600 --> 2:29:12.840]  just when they loaded them right down there doesn't tell what you saw.
[2:29:12.840 --> 2:29:18.840]  So again this is just the hot corner there in McCallan where they now have two human
[2:29:18.840 --> 2:29:24.320]  trafficking facilities that are two city blocks wide and then they have the bus station caddy
[2:29:24.320 --> 2:29:29.120]  corner to them so they can easily get them in and out on the bus quickly loaded up without
[2:29:29.120 --> 2:29:30.560]  much interference.
[2:29:30.560 --> 2:29:37.040]  They used to have the COVID testing processing facility there too but they shut that down.
[2:29:37.040 --> 2:29:42.760]  So here's Alex now going to the bus facility which is just right across the street and
[2:29:42.760 --> 2:29:48.320]  this is where a lot of the illegal immigrants are traveled and trafficked across the nation.
[2:29:48.320 --> 2:30:17.040]  So as I was saying Hidalgo, Starr, Willissey and Cameron County all opted out of the governor's
[2:30:17.040 --> 2:30:23.160]  emergency declaration down here primarily because they do not want to be cooperating
[2:30:23.160 --> 2:30:26.040]  with law enforcement and making their jails available.
[2:30:26.040 --> 2:30:32.040]  So the governor now wants DPS to have the power to arrest these illegal aliens for trespassing
[2:30:32.040 --> 2:30:36.440]  especially when they damage property on the various ranches that they crossed down here.
[2:30:36.440 --> 2:30:39.920]  That's been a huge problem for the ranchers down here.
[2:30:39.920 --> 2:30:47.840]  So as we know these counties in the Rio Grande Valley, Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr and Willissey
[2:30:47.840 --> 2:30:53.120]  those are heavily Democrat controlled counties and that is why they have opted out and are
[2:30:53.120 --> 2:31:04.320]  refusing to cooperate with Governor Abbott's emergency declaration order.
[2:31:04.320 --> 2:31:08.960]  Another bus load of about two dozen illegal immigrants moving into the human smuggling
[2:31:08.960 --> 2:31:09.960]  facility.
[2:31:09.960 --> 2:31:16.440]  Those are all volunteers packing in to help process everything.
[2:31:16.440 --> 2:31:20.920]  You see that this is an army operation ladies and gentlemen.
[2:31:20.920 --> 2:31:26.400]  So there are buses and vans just going out all the time constantly and then we just saw
[2:31:26.400 --> 2:31:33.480]  about 15, 16 volunteers going in to help organize this invasion.
[2:31:33.480 --> 2:31:36.080]  This is incredible.
[2:31:36.080 --> 2:31:43.080]  So again, since we've last been down there, they've shut down the COVID testing processing
[2:31:43.080 --> 2:31:44.080]  facility.
[2:31:44.080 --> 2:31:48.960]  The Rio Grande Valley Catholic Charities has expanded their facility to another building
[2:31:48.960 --> 2:31:52.480]  that is just another city-wide block, city-block-wide building.
[2:31:52.480 --> 2:31:53.480]  Just huge.
[2:31:53.480 --> 2:32:00.080]  We'll start to finish with Owen Schroeder's commentary when we're not talking Owen because
[2:32:00.080 --> 2:32:01.640]  I want to get this out to everybody.
[2:32:01.640 --> 2:32:07.360]  Jim, finish up the recap, I mean, Trump needs to be here, and the fact that we're right
[2:32:07.360 --> 2:32:10.240]  here in the center of this, they've set these up all across the Texas border.
[2:32:10.240 --> 2:32:11.240]  Right.
[2:32:11.240 --> 2:32:14.920]  And unfortunately, we see this with all the Republicans that have come down here.
[2:32:14.920 --> 2:32:18.320]  It's more about the photo op than actually getting to the truth, right?
[2:32:18.320 --> 2:32:22.760]  So we know Trump is here and Abbott is here today, unfortunately, where are they going?
[2:32:22.760 --> 2:32:27.240]  They're going to the DPS station out in Westlaco, then they're going to a town hall meeting
[2:32:27.240 --> 2:32:29.600]  at an airport hangar, okay?
[2:32:29.600 --> 2:32:31.600]  That's not going to solve the problem.
[2:32:31.600 --> 2:32:36.040]  That's not going to expose the people to problem, which is happening right down here downtown
[2:32:36.040 --> 2:32:43.000]  McAllen at this Catholic Charity, which this charity alone is responsible in the last six
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:49.880]  months of facilitating the transport of thousands upon thousands of illegal aliens into the
[2:32:49.880 --> 2:32:53.000]  interior of the United States, and nobody's doing anything about it.
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:55.920]  And explain it one sector, how many people they apprehended.
[2:32:55.920 --> 2:32:56.920]  Right.
[2:32:56.920 --> 2:33:01.240]  In the Del Rio sector, as we said earlier, 174,000 illegals stopped in one month.
[2:33:01.240 --> 2:33:06.040]  Now we all know that for every illegal that stopped, three, four, five successfully make
[2:33:06.040 --> 2:33:07.760]  it into the United States.
[2:33:07.760 --> 2:33:12.880]  That means likely in that one sector alone, we're looking at close to a half a million
[2:33:12.880 --> 2:33:18.760]  illegals in one month that have sat there across the border and made it into the United States.
[2:33:18.760 --> 2:33:20.120]  This has to stop.
[2:33:20.120 --> 2:33:21.220]  People need to speak up.
[2:33:21.220 --> 2:33:25.320]  We got to put pressure on our government to put them to this.
[2:33:25.320 --> 2:33:27.880]  Here's another example.
[2:33:27.880 --> 2:33:30.440]  Here's another example of what we're breaking out, what we're talking about.
[2:33:30.440 --> 2:33:32.520]  We were just here a few months ago.
[2:33:32.520 --> 2:33:35.040]  When was that, Tim, that we stopped the car with a load of kids in?
[2:33:35.040 --> 2:33:36.040]  Around April.
[2:33:36.040 --> 2:33:37.720]  So what, four months ago now?
[2:33:37.720 --> 2:33:38.720]  Yeah.
[2:33:38.720 --> 2:33:42.760]  Four months ago, and catch that on tape, and people couldn't even believe it.
[2:33:42.760 --> 2:33:46.040]  We just saw more kids getting loaded in without child safety seats as well.
[2:33:46.040 --> 2:33:49.600]  But the point is, people are in denial about this.
[2:33:49.600 --> 2:33:50.920]  This is all real.
[2:33:50.920 --> 2:33:51.920]  You can come here in McAllen.
[2:33:51.920 --> 2:33:52.920]  Look at this.
[2:33:52.920 --> 2:33:53.920]  Look at this.
[2:33:53.920 --> 2:33:54.920]  Look at this.
[2:33:54.920 --> 2:33:57.120]  We're on 15th Street, 15th Street, and Austin.
[2:33:57.120 --> 2:33:58.120]  Okay?
[2:33:58.120 --> 2:33:59.120]  This is real.
[2:33:59.120 --> 2:34:00.120]  Let's go to the other side.
[2:34:00.120 --> 2:34:01.520]  This is not here.
[2:34:01.520 --> 2:34:06.840]  Another massive bus load, prison bus load, with the bars on the windows, pulls up to
[2:34:06.840 --> 2:34:07.840]  the facility.
[2:34:07.840 --> 2:34:15.720]  So again, this is another bus load and van load actually showing up right here right
[2:34:15.720 --> 2:34:27.360]  now.
[2:34:27.360 --> 2:34:31.320]  There are the Border Patrol agents on the bus, so these guys came from a Border Patrol
[2:34:31.320 --> 2:34:33.120]  facility.
[2:34:33.120 --> 2:34:38.360]  These illegal immigrants, these victims of human trafficking and smuggling, now arriving
[2:34:38.360 --> 2:34:43.200]  at the Catholic Charities facility from the Border Patrol facility being unloaded on
[2:34:43.200 --> 2:34:49.560]  this bus, a bus load of illegal immigrants being smuggled into this country, and Biden
[2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:53.600]  is making Border Patrol complete the process.
[2:34:53.600 --> 2:35:07.760]  It's interesting, this gentleman's...
[2:35:07.760 --> 2:35:11.920]  And so let me just say this too, and guys, just keep the B-roll going.
[2:35:11.920 --> 2:35:17.320]  You know, I was kind of emotional yesterday on air.
[2:35:17.320 --> 2:35:20.640]  I've gotten emotional a couple times in the last week on air just dealing with this stuff.
[2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:27.240]  And so I really, really prayed last night on this issue and got on my knees.
[2:35:27.240 --> 2:35:33.360]  And I always like to start and finish with my favorite prayer, God grant me the serenity
[2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:36.400]  to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the
[2:35:36.400 --> 2:35:37.760]  wisdom to know the difference.
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:40.520]  And this is one of these instances here.
[2:35:40.520 --> 2:35:46.240]  And so here's the problem, folks, this is the problem.
[2:35:46.240 --> 2:35:51.360]  This is never going to stop until people go to jail.
[2:35:51.360 --> 2:35:59.080]  And so it's like what Alex said earlier.
[2:35:59.080 --> 2:36:01.600]  And guys, just pause that, we'll pick it back up.
[2:36:01.600 --> 2:36:05.520]  And it's the same thing whether it's Donald Trump or Abbott or Alex Jones or Owen Schreuer
[2:36:05.520 --> 2:36:09.240]  or any individual.
[2:36:09.240 --> 2:36:16.720]  If you actually did what needed to be done to stop this from happening, you would get
[2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:20.480]  arrested.
[2:36:20.480 --> 2:36:30.240]  And so that was really when the fog lifted when I was praying last night, not that God
[2:36:30.240 --> 2:36:32.240]  is saying, hey, go out there and get arrested.
[2:36:32.240 --> 2:36:36.240]  He's just saying, no, you realize that the cost of stopping this is going to be everything.
[2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:37.440]  It's going to be your life.
[2:36:37.440 --> 2:36:43.640]  And so it brings you back to the V for Vandetta paradigm where he has the girl with the dead.
[2:36:43.640 --> 2:36:44.640]  She's like, oh, you're going to die.
[2:36:44.640 --> 2:36:45.640]  I'm going to kill you.
[2:36:45.640 --> 2:36:47.080]  She lives through it.
[2:36:47.080 --> 2:36:49.000]  And now you're free.
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:50.320]  But it's like that's the cost.
[2:36:50.320 --> 2:36:54.080]  I mean, if we actually wanted to stop this, Alex Jones would have to get arrested.
[2:36:54.080 --> 2:36:55.960]  The crew would have to get arrested.
[2:36:55.960 --> 2:36:57.360]  Donald Trump would have to get arrested.
[2:36:57.360 --> 2:37:01.720]  I mean, for all the issues, this is just one little issue of all the issues.
[2:37:01.720 --> 2:37:04.120]  So that's what it comes down to.
[2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:06.720]  And nobody wants to get tortured in a jail cell.
[2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:07.720]  Nobody wants to get arrested.
[2:37:07.720 --> 2:37:08.720]  I don't blame you.
[2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:11.920]  I'm just saying that's where this is at, folks.
[2:37:11.920 --> 2:37:17.360]  This is criminal activity being accepted by humanity because nobody's willing to step
[2:37:17.360 --> 2:37:19.160]  up and pay the ultimate price.
[2:37:19.160 --> 2:37:20.960]  Again, not blaming it.
[2:37:20.960 --> 2:37:22.360]  I'm one of them, too.
[2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:26.480]  I don't want to go down there and stop this human trafficking operation from going on,
[2:37:26.480 --> 2:37:31.080]  doing whatever it takes because I'm going to end up in jail just like anybody would.
[2:37:31.080 --> 2:37:34.680]  But see, that's the problem is we just accept it.
[2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:36.280]  We just accept the criminal government.
[2:37:36.280 --> 2:37:41.920]  We just accept the metastasizing crimes being committed on every level.
[2:37:41.920 --> 2:37:48.400]  And so now it's so bad that they can run human smuggling and child smuggling operations
[2:37:48.400 --> 2:37:52.160]  in broad daylight with taxpayer dollars.
[2:37:52.160 --> 2:37:56.680]  Three of our best selling products are now back in stock after months and months of not
[2:37:56.680 --> 2:38:00.960]  being available because of the COVID lockdowns that destroyed this supply chain.
[2:38:00.960 --> 2:38:04.840]  Biotruce Selenium is the highest quality selenium from the mustard seed.
[2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:08.320]  It is essential for all cellular activity in the body.
[2:38:08.320 --> 2:38:10.400]  It's critical, and it funds the info war.
[2:38:10.400 --> 2:38:11.400]  It's back in stock.

[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:58.680]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[2:38:58.680 --> 2:39:07.360]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[2:39:07.360 --> 2:39:16.920]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves, worst
[2:39:16.920 --> 2:39:24.200]  of slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system, rendered down to be servile
[2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:29.120]  minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:34.200]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia,
[2:39:34.200 --> 2:39:39.160]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[2:39:39.160 --> 2:39:44.240]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world, and it's the only
[2:39:44.240 --> 2:39:47.760]  choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:52.840]  It is a spiritual battle, an info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[2:39:52.840 --> 2:39:57.640]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[2:39:57.640 --> 2:40:00.360]  for beta testing to operational.
[2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:05.120]  The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[2:40:05.120 --> 2:40:06.120]  takeover.
[2:40:06.120 --> 2:40:09.240]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working, and others have been
[2:40:09.240 --> 2:40:14.160]  working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[2:40:14.160 --> 2:40:18.280]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible, and if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[2:40:18.280 --> 2:40:19.960]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:22.440]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[2:40:22.440 --> 2:40:26.680]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning
[2:40:26.680 --> 2:40:28.360]  others is absolutely essential.
[2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:32.920]  And at the same time, supporting info wars by buying high quality products to keep us
[2:40:32.920 --> 2:40:36.600]  on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're
[2:40:36.600 --> 2:40:39.040]  also funding our operation.

[2:41:55.720 --> 2:42:14.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:42:14.880 --> 2:42:18.680]  There is a lot developing right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:42:18.680 --> 2:42:24.200]  But we go back to McCall and Texas with some of the most shocking footage.
[2:42:24.200 --> 2:42:27.400]  It's all going to be a Band-Aught video, but some of the most shocking footage and revelations
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:32.920]  from just the hour that Alex Jones showed up and was there reporting this morning.
[2:42:32.920 --> 2:42:37.080]  So we jump forward now to some of the more revealing shocking stuff that they caught
[2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:38.080]  this morning.
[2:42:38.080 --> 2:42:39.080]  We've been here 30 minutes.
[2:42:39.080 --> 2:42:40.080]  We're going to upload these chunks raw at a Band-Aught video.
[2:42:40.080 --> 2:42:41.080]  And many of these people have disappeared out of their countries.
[2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:42.080]  Many of these people are alone like this little boy right here.
[2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:43.080]  Barefoot.
[2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:44.080]  And they're just disappeared.
[2:42:44.080 --> 2:42:55.080]  Who's this little kid?
[2:42:55.080 --> 2:43:02.920]  That's a blonde-haired, blue-eyed little boy with a Hispanic lady and a baby.
[2:43:02.920 --> 2:43:03.920]  Right there.
[2:43:03.920 --> 2:43:04.920]  100% an honest mother.
[2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:06.920]  Did you just see that right there?
[2:43:06.920 --> 2:43:07.920]  I got it.
[2:43:07.920 --> 2:43:08.920]  I got it on video.
[2:43:08.920 --> 2:43:13.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, did you just see what I just saw right there?
[2:43:13.920 --> 2:43:15.920]  We need to call the police.
[2:43:15.920 --> 2:43:17.640]  Kim, get over here.
[2:43:17.640 --> 2:43:18.640]  We got to call the police.
[2:43:18.640 --> 2:43:21.640]  I don't care what they say, I'm following the police report.
[2:43:21.640 --> 2:43:24.640]  Kim, we got to call 911.
[2:43:24.640 --> 2:43:25.640]  Kind of.
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:30.520]  The blonde-haired, blue-eyed kid with two Hispanic women, 100%.
[2:43:30.520 --> 2:43:31.520]  Blonde-haired, blue-eyed kid.
[2:43:31.520 --> 2:43:32.520]  We got to call the police.
[2:43:32.520 --> 2:43:33.520]  100% smuggling.
[2:43:33.520 --> 2:43:38.000]  By the way, I've seen about four blonde-haired, blue-eyed kids in this short footage right
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  here.
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:41.520]  I've never, we never saw that before when we got down there.
[2:43:41.520 --> 2:43:44.560]  We're the woman that's two-predored.
[2:43:44.560 --> 2:43:47.560]  I understand that.
[2:43:47.560 --> 2:43:55.160]  So now imagine, the police are just being told to stand down.
[2:43:55.160 --> 2:43:56.160]  Police.
[2:43:56.160 --> 2:43:59.960]  Didn't look like, didn't look like, well, you caught that on tape, didn't you?
[2:43:59.960 --> 2:44:01.640]  Yeah, I got it on the wide angle.
[2:44:01.640 --> 2:44:06.280]  The Senate report found that thousands of these children are not with their parents, and unaccompanied
[2:44:06.280 --> 2:44:12.280]  children are then picked up and tacked on.
[2:44:12.280 --> 2:44:20.360]  So again, the police can't even stop this lawlessness in McAllen, Texas.
[2:44:20.360 --> 2:44:28.720]  We saw children that clearly weren't with their parents, they're going to go to hell
[2:44:28.720 --> 2:44:29.720]  for this.
[2:44:29.720 --> 2:44:34.720]  I hope they make them wear the mask to cover up their identities.
[2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:38.440]  They make these children wear masks so we don't know and no one will ever know who they
[2:44:38.440 --> 2:44:39.440]  were.
[2:44:39.440 --> 2:44:43.720]  And again, it's ironic that they've taken them down to the COVID testing center, looking
[2:44:43.720 --> 2:44:44.720]  at how they're sitting.
[2:44:44.720 --> 2:44:47.720]  They're still forcing them to wear masks.
[2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:52.720]  They're not recording this.
[2:44:52.720 --> 2:44:58.880]  It's on tape, so it's good we got it off.
[2:44:58.880 --> 2:45:05.040]  So again, the police will be called on you if you're out there reporting or filming what's
[2:45:05.040 --> 2:45:09.320]  going on with this illegal immigration pipeline.
[2:45:09.320 --> 2:45:14.520]  But then they're told to stand down when you can clearly point out that this is an illegal
[2:45:14.520 --> 2:45:16.880]  immigrant pipeline, a human smuggling pipeline.
[2:45:16.880 --> 2:45:19.880]  The police can't do anything about it.
[2:45:19.880 --> 2:45:29.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:45:29.880 --> 2:45:50.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:45:50.880 --> 2:45:58.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:45:58.880 --> 2:46:08.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:46:08.880 --> 2:46:18.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:46:18.880 --> 2:46:28.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:46:28.880 --> 2:46:38.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:46:38.880 --> 2:46:48.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:46:48.880 --> 2:46:58.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:46:58.880 --> 2:47:08.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:47:08.880 --> 2:47:18.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:47:18.880 --> 2:47:38.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:47:38.880 --> 2:47:58.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:47:58.880 --> 2:48:08.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:48:08.880 --> 2:48:18.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:48:18.880 --> 2:48:28.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:48:28.880 --> 2:48:38.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:48:38.880 --> 2:48:48.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:48:48.880 --> 2:49:16.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:49:16.880 --> 2:49:26.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:36.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:46.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:49:46.880 --> 2:49:56.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:49:56.880 --> 2:50:06.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:50:06.880 --> 2:50:16.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:26.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:50:26.880 --> 2:50:36.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:50:36.880 --> 2:50:46.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:50:46.880 --> 2:51:06.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:51:06.880 --> 2:51:16.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:51:16.880 --> 2:51:40.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:51:40.880 --> 2:51:50.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[2:51:50.880 --> 2:52:00.880]  They can't talk to us.
[2:52:00.880 --> 2:52:10.880]  They can't talk to us.
[2:52:10.880 --> 2:52:38.880]  They can't talk to us.
[2:52:38.880 --> 2:52:48.880]  They can't talk to us.
[2:52:48.880 --> 2:52:58.880]  They can't talk to us.
