[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.000]  is Alex Jones.
[00:29.000 --> 00:34.000]  Well, I'm getting hundreds of phone calls and thousands of emails of support from listeners
[00:34.000 --> 00:40.000]  after the false charges attacks kind of following the whole Me Too movement have finally been
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  leveled against us because they finally found some folks that would bear false witness.
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.000]  And I feel really good. I feel honored to be in this position to be attacked by Hillary Clinton
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  by her lawyer. That's that's who's filed this suit. And I know the truth is going to come out
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.000]  because we just so happened to have documented because we figured this was going on in the closing days
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.000]  before these individuals left. So they have certainly stepped in a bear trap.
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.000]  But first let's go to this critical report and we'll be back with has Trump betrayed the Second Amendment.
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  There have been shootings where clearly people do it by themselves.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.000]  There's also shootings where I can play a CNN clips where well more cops got shot.
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  They need to do more to stop police violence. That's why they're getting killed.
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  You know, they deserve it. When Congressmen's police got shot.
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  Well, Blitzer had a guest ongoing. Well, the guy was a hero that did it.
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  You know, he wasn't a bad guy. And Blitzer's like, OK, I agree.
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  I just want to let people know that he wasn't evil.
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.000]  That he was, I guess, tired of some of the politics are going on.
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000]  That's what we just heard. Perhaps he wasn't evil, just tired of the politics.
[01:46.000 --> 01:54.000]  Well, the day of the event, we start seeing local stations and Texas stations that were there to cover major league baseball,
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  interviewing students going, there's multiple shooters and crews was with me.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  He wasn't shooting and then I get a guest on. They say it.
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  He knows other people to get in contact with and say it.
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  Imagine then you don't cover it because you don't want to be called a conspiracy theorist.
[02:08.000 --> 02:14.000]  That just means going and talking to the locals and seeing what really happened instead of whatever the
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.000]  national news in D.C. or New York or L.A. says. And that's what's crazy.
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  But see, they can't say, oh, Jones is bad.
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  He interviewed students that said there were multiple shooters and showed local newscasts saying the same thing.
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.000]  And the sheriff stood down. No, no, no, no, no, you can't go up against that.
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  So you go, Alex Jones is to be banned on YouTube Google. Thank God.
[02:35.000 --> 02:38.000]  Washington Times said, thank God. Glenn Beck says, thank God.
[02:38.000 --> 02:46.000]  I was going to go to Glenn Beck, washed up half his audience, Democrat, operative, Judas go.
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  He goes and falls on his sword on mainstream media.
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  That's what he does. He goes and falls on his sword.
[02:50.000 --> 02:54.000]  He gets pushed by Twitter, Facebook, everybody force fed.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  Lab is with corporate sponsorship.
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  He goes on, falls on his sword.
[02:58.000 --> 02:59.000]  This is a fraud.
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  And then he misrepresents what I said about 9 11 about everything because I said there was a stand down Saudi Arabia.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  All that's come out in the 28 pages.
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  But he misrepresents that and then he misrepresents the rest. Here it is.
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  We're frequently accused of spreading conspiracy theories about Obama and about liberals,
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  which is why I want to know what you make of the conspiracy theories this week.
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  These attacks against the students in Florida.
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  Why do people embrace this kind of conspiracy theory thinking?
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  Okay, so let's talk about conspiracy theories because again, this is a left and right kind of thing.
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  Look at the concentration.
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  Excuse me, Scripps Howard did a poll in 2006 and they asked the question,
[03:38.000 --> 03:45.000]  how likely is it that people in the federal government either assisted in the 9 11 attacks
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  or took no action because they wanted war in the Middle East?
[03:49.000 --> 03:55.000]  22% said very likely. 22% of Democrats said very likely.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  28% said somewhat likely.
[03:58.000 --> 04:05.000]  So that's more than half of Democrats thought that Bush was involved in the 9 11 conspiracy.
[04:05.000 --> 04:10.000]  So conspiracy, and by the way, the person who was behind that conspiracy
[04:10.000 --> 04:15.000]  is the same guy behind a lot of these conspiracies, Alex Jones.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  And then they can't actually say, we need to shut it down.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  They played local newscast saying multiple shooters and the police stood down
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  and they're also saying CNN had fake town halls.
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  That's confirmed and the crowd goes burn her, burn her of handpicked people.
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.000]  They're saying kill the NRA, burn people, murder them, shoot them, they're murderers.
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.000]  And all we're doing is going, gee, they all admit they're in an ad thing
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  and they're all in PR and they admit that in Buzzfeed.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  It's like, shut up, you said that no one died.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  See, it's like I say, you know, I want to live like Venezuela.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  Shut up, you're a Nazi, you want to live under Hitler.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  I'm like, no, I said I want to live under communism.
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  So see, they always play these games and only because we're not paying attention
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.000]  do they keep having success but they're starting to lose.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  Fuel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.000]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  into easily absorbable components.
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.000]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  You can eat protein heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets.
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.000]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  Don't let a meal go to waste, use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.000]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.
[05:58.000 --> 06:18.000]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[06:28.000 --> 06:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live. We're broadcasting worldwide.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  And I've got a lot of news to cover today.
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  We've got the mainstream media launching their big fake news story
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  trying to take me down with absolute fake headlines about Alex Jones
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  accused of sexual assault.
[06:51.000 --> 06:56.000]  And Alex Jones accused of grooming male and female employees for sex.
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  And Alex Jones accused of his office having Nazi tennis shoes.
[07:01.000 --> 07:07.000]  I mean, and it's Hillary Rodham Clinton's former lawyer that's filed all this.
[07:07.000 --> 07:11.000]  And I feel really good about this.
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  I feel bad for the people that got induced to say these things.
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.000]  And I feel bad for some of the crew that got put into the whole timeline
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  to make it sound more plausible as I guess kind of extras in the whole fiction production.
[07:23.000 --> 07:30.000]  But I actually feel really good about this because they went over the top.
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  They've been off way more than they can chew.
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  And we've got amazing documentation.
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  But I'm going to leave a lot of that for court.
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  But coming up towards the bottom of the hour,
[07:40.000 --> 07:46.000]  I'm going to make a statement on this and go through some of the facts.
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.000]  Before we go any further, people are going crazy.
[07:51.000 --> 07:55.000]  Is Trump getting ready to gut the second amendment?
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  And he's made some statements that I don't like.
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  And I've been saying this for about a week,
[07:59.000 --> 08:02.000]  and the statements are getting worse and worse and worse.
[08:02.000 --> 08:06.000]  But we've seen this tactic before from the president.
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.000]  It's sound reasonable knowing the Democrats will put forward a bill
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  calling for total gun ban, just like they did with the whole Dream Act.
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.000]  And so I think that's what Trump's doing.
[08:16.000 --> 08:17.000]  That's why they hate him.
[08:17.000 --> 08:18.000]  That's why they want to remove him.
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  They're trying to destroy anybody that's connected to him.
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  But I thought, since I mentioned this report yesterday,
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  that I would go to this now, at least part of it.
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  It's been edited together by some great folks called Galactic Service on YouTube,
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.000]  taking an interview I did with Joe Rogan a year ago and putting it together.
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  And now everything that I talked about in there is what Elon Musk is talking about.
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  It's in the New York Times today.
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  The sublime and the scary future of cameras with AI brains, cameras hooked to AI.
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  They're already all hooked into the Google and the rest of it.
[08:51.000 --> 08:52.000]  That is AI.
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.000]  So this is what the globalists believe.
[08:55.000 --> 09:00.000]  They believe that they're doing this whole off-world situation and all this craziness.
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  And just a year ago, it sounded crazy.
[09:02.000 --> 09:03.000]  Now it's mainstream news.
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  I thought I'd play an excerpt of this.
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  Here it is from the Joe Rogan experience.
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  I want to tell you guys the big enchiladas.
[09:09.000 --> 09:10.000]  Okay, that's it.
[09:10.000 --> 09:11.000]  Please, the big enchilada.
[09:11.000 --> 09:12.000]  Do I have to wear these headphones?
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  What do you know about aliens?
[09:14.000 --> 09:15.000]  Are aliens real?
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.000]  This is really big.
[09:16.000 --> 09:17.000]  So.
[09:17.000 --> 09:18.000]  Okay.
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  The question is, what does Donald Trump know about aliens?
[09:20.000 --> 09:21.000]  Oh, yeah.
[09:21.000 --> 09:22.000]  What does he know now?
[09:22.000 --> 09:23.000]  Right?
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.000]  Because he's in the office.
[09:24.000 --> 09:25.000]  I don't know.
[09:25.000 --> 09:26.000]  That would be the first thing I did.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  I would run to the office and I'd go, who's got the alien doc?
[09:29.000 --> 09:30.000]  The documents.
[09:30.000 --> 09:31.000]  Who's got them?
[09:31.000 --> 09:32.000]  All right.
[09:32.000 --> 09:33.000]  Let me give you my best, please.
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.000]  Deep research approximation.
[09:34.000 --> 09:35.000]  Are you ready?
[09:35.000 --> 09:36.000]  Yes.
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.000]  I'm going to give you the big enchilada.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  Joe, there is aliens in this room right now.
[09:39.000 --> 09:40.000]  For real?
[09:40.000 --> 09:41.000]  Yeah.
[09:41.000 --> 09:42.000]  You're not of this world, bro.
[09:42.000 --> 09:43.000]  Me?
[09:43.000 --> 09:44.000]  You're the alien.
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.000]  Oh, wow.
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.000]  I didn't know.
[09:46.000 --> 09:47.000]  Well, here's what the elite believe.
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  This is the world's greatest science and technology.
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  I don't know, but I think we need to get into that.
[09:51.000 --> 09:52.000]  Oh, thank you.
[09:52.000 --> 09:53.000]  And people can't even handle that.
[09:53.000 --> 09:54.000]  There's armies.
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  We're fighting a pedophile conspiracy, but beyond that, it's a vampire conspiracy
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  in that they are interdimensionally sucking the essence of our youth.
[10:01.000 --> 10:02.000]  Right.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  And they believe they're possessed by an off-world entity.
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  They do?
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.000]  Yeah.
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.000]  And then Joe, I've been on there 22 years.
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  I don't get into aliens, metaphysical, religion, any of that.
[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  I've studied the elite, and I've also communicated with a lot of the top people.
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.120]  people. And if you want to know, I will actually break down right now the best knowledge right
[10:19.120 --> 10:24.560]  now what's happening on the planet. What's happening? The elite are all about transcendence
[10:24.560 --> 10:28.000]  and living forever and the secrets of the universe and they want to know all this. Some
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.840]  are good, some are bad, some are a mix. But the good ones don't ever want to organize.
[10:32.840 --> 10:36.800]  The bad ones didn't want to organize because they lost after power. Powerful consciousnesses
[10:36.800 --> 10:39.880]  don't want to dominate other people. They want to empower them so they don't tend to
[10:39.880 --> 10:43.520]  get together until things are really late in the game. Then they come together, evil's
[10:43.520 --> 10:48.640]  always defeated because good is so much stronger. And we're on this planet, and Einstein's
[10:48.640 --> 10:52.600]  physics showed it, Max Planck's physics showed it all. There's at least 12 dimensions. And
[10:52.600 --> 10:55.620]  now that's why all the top scientists and billionaires are coming out saying it's a
[10:55.620 --> 11:01.520]  false hologram. It is artificial. The computers are scanning it and finding tension points
[11:01.520 --> 11:07.280]  where it's artificially projected and gravity's bleeding in to this universe. That's what
[11:07.280 --> 11:11.480]  they call dark matter. So we're like a thought or a dream that's a
[11:11.480 --> 11:16.200]  wisp in some computer program, some God's mind, whatever. They're proving it all. It's
[11:16.200 --> 11:22.720]  all coming out. Now, there's like this sub-transmission zone below the third dimension that's just
[11:22.720 --> 11:26.120]  turned over to the most horrible things. This is what it resonates to. And it's trying to
[11:26.120 --> 11:31.000]  get up into the third dimension that's just a basic level consciousness to launch into
[11:31.000 --> 11:36.240]  the next levels. And our species is already way up in the fifth, sixth dimension, consciously,
[11:36.240 --> 11:40.960]  our best people. But there's this big war trying to like basically destroy humanity
[11:40.960 --> 11:45.760]  because humanity has free will and there's a decision to which level we want to go to.
[11:45.760 --> 11:50.600]  We have free will, so evil's allowed to come and contend and not just good. And the elites
[11:50.600 --> 11:57.900]  themselves believe they're racing or using human technology to try to take our best minds
[11:57.900 --> 12:03.840]  and build some type of breakaway civilization where they're going to merge with machines,
[12:03.840 --> 12:07.920]  transcend and break away from the failed species of this man, which is kind of like a false
[12:07.920 --> 12:11.840]  transmission because they're thinking what they are is ugly and bad, projecting it onto
[12:11.840 --> 12:16.920]  themselves instead of believing, no, it's a human test about building us up. And so
[12:16.920 --> 12:20.960]  Google was set up 18, 19 years ago, and this was, I knew about this before it was declassified.
[12:20.960 --> 12:25.920]  I'm just saying I have good sources, that they wanted to build a giant artificial system.
[12:25.920 --> 12:31.640]  And Google believes that the first artificial intelligence will be a supercomputer based
[12:31.640 --> 12:37.240]  on the neuron activities of the hive mind of humanity with billions of people wired
[12:37.240 --> 12:41.920]  into it with the internet and so all of our thoughts go into it and we're actually building
[12:41.920 --> 12:46.360]  a computer that has real neurons in real time that's also psychically connected to
[12:46.360 --> 12:52.280]  us that are organic creatures so that they will have current prediction powers, future
[12:52.280 --> 12:56.640]  prediction powers, a true crystal ball, but the big secret is once you have a crystal
[12:56.640 --> 13:01.560]  ball and know the future, you can add stimuli beforehand and make decisions that control
[13:01.560 --> 13:07.200]  the future. And so then it's the end of consciousness and free will for individuals as we know and
[13:07.200 --> 13:13.920]  a true 2.0 in a very bad way hive mind consciousness with an AI jacked into everyone knowing our
[13:13.920 --> 13:19.120]  hopes and dreams, delivering it to us not in some PKD wirehead system where we plug
[13:19.120 --> 13:22.480]  in and give up on consciousness because of unlimited pleasure, but because we were already
[13:22.480 --> 13:26.960]  wired in and absorbed before we knew it by giving over our consciousness to the system
[13:26.960 --> 13:31.600]  by our daily decisions that it was able to manipulate and control into a larger system.
[13:31.600 --> 13:35.880]  There's now a human counter strike taking place to shut this off before it gets fully
[13:35.880 --> 13:40.040]  into place and to block these systems and to try to have an actual debate about where
[13:40.040 --> 13:45.320]  humanity goes and cut off the pedophiles and psychic vampires that are control of this
[13:45.320 --> 13:47.560]  AI system before humanity is destroyed.
[13:47.560 --> 13:49.280]  But how did the pedophiles get in control of AI?
[13:49.280 --> 13:53.160]  Well, the pedophiles at whatever level, the devil, whatever you would call it, this interdimensional
[13:53.160 --> 13:57.360]  thing that gives them advanced off-world technology, the fallen one that's not in this world, is
[13:57.360 --> 14:01.520]  giving them advanced knowledge on how to construct these systems that have already been used
[14:01.520 --> 14:03.200]  before on other populations.
[14:03.200 --> 14:04.200]  What?
[14:04.200 --> 14:05.200]  Is that Satan?
[14:05.200 --> 14:06.200]  What are you talking about?
[14:06.200 --> 14:07.200]  That's Satan.
[14:07.200 --> 14:08.200]  You're saying something insane.
[14:08.200 --> 14:11.800]  You're saying something that the stupid preacher tells you about who's totally controlled
[14:11.800 --> 14:15.160]  or something you read about in the news or TV.
[14:15.160 --> 14:20.480]  This is an interdimensional force that wants to influence us to build something that absorbs
[14:20.480 --> 14:25.440]  us and kills us rather than the divine free will we're given to build something much better
[14:25.440 --> 14:27.320]  than empowers the species.
[14:27.320 --> 14:30.880]  So the species is now making a decision about its entire future.
[14:30.880 --> 14:31.880]  Where are you getting this from?
[14:31.880 --> 14:33.080]  That's what it is.
[14:33.080 --> 14:34.080]  But where are you getting it from?
[14:34.080 --> 14:39.120]  From looking at all the data, researching it, studying it, watching the enemy.
[14:39.120 --> 14:42.320]  That's the big decision that humanity has now got before us.
[14:42.320 --> 14:47.200]  You get some place finally in deep research where it's what every culture already said,
[14:47.200 --> 14:50.440]  what everybody already knew, what they're telling you in movies like Prometheus, what
[14:50.440 --> 14:53.240]  the elite admit the New York Times they believe in.
[14:53.240 --> 14:56.920]  Everything they're doing points towards this and then you read their own writings.
[14:56.920 --> 15:01.840]  They believe we're this ugly fallen, ugly species, we're only to be killed.
[15:01.840 --> 15:05.360]  We're the rich billionaires who are better than us and they're going to merge with machines
[15:05.360 --> 15:07.200]  and become gods and go to the next level.
[15:07.200 --> 15:09.000]  Here's what I'm telling you.
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.120]  The elite literally believe interdimensionally they were given this information and then
[15:14.120 --> 15:15.120]  built it.
[15:15.120 --> 15:16.120]  And here's the thing.
[15:16.120 --> 15:21.400]  They built it and Google admits, even at data dumpster wired two years ago, that they're
[15:21.400 --> 15:26.320]  building an AI that will end human consciousness free will and take over and the next species
[15:26.320 --> 15:27.520]  will rise out of that.
[15:27.520 --> 15:28.520]  They built it.
[15:28.520 --> 15:32.760]  It's a centralized system of what they're building that isn't naturally occurring.
[15:32.760 --> 15:33.760]  Who is that?
[15:33.760 --> 15:36.360]  I mean, if you actually read what all the globalists say, they are getting on the floor.
[15:36.360 --> 15:37.360]  Let's stop right there.
[15:37.360 --> 15:39.760]  There's about four minutes left in the clip.
[15:39.760 --> 15:40.760]  It's online.
[15:40.760 --> 15:45.920]  Alex Jones talks about intergalactic interdimensional war and it breaks it all down.
[15:45.920 --> 15:46.920]  This is why they hate us.
[15:46.920 --> 15:48.520]  It's why they want to shut us down.
[15:48.520 --> 15:51.960]  This is why they want to end the broadcast is I'm bringing everybody together.
[15:51.960 --> 15:55.280]  That's why they're calling me a racist and a rapist and everything else is because they're
[15:55.280 --> 16:04.120]  raping your mind ever since ID stronghold created RFID blocking wallet technology over
[16:04.120 --> 16:05.120]  10 years ago.
[16:05.120 --> 16:09.400]  Major designer brands have tried to create their own versions, but do they really work?
[16:09.400 --> 16:14.280]  We let real people test designer brand RFID blocking wallets using the same rigorous testing
[16:14.280 --> 16:16.240]  ID stronghold wallets go through.
[16:16.240 --> 16:17.840]  So how did the designer brands do?
[16:17.840 --> 16:22.240]  I expected notable brands to perform well and I was pretty surprised to see that it
[16:22.240 --> 16:23.840]  was not fully protected.
[16:23.840 --> 16:28.400]  Just by those big brand names that I like and trust don't really do what they're advertising
[16:28.400 --> 16:29.400]  that they do.
[16:29.400 --> 16:33.600]  Get a stronghold on your credit cards license and other critical data with ID stronghold
[16:33.600 --> 16:34.600]  wallets.
[16:34.600 --> 16:36.800]  Other RFID blocking wallets simply aren't the same.
[16:36.800 --> 16:39.240]  ID stronghold just outperformed them in every aspect.
[16:39.240 --> 16:43.120]  I would definitely recommend ID stronghold wallets to my friends and family.
[16:43.120 --> 16:44.120]  Check the label.
[16:44.120 --> 16:46.680]  If it doesn't say it's an ID stronghold, it's not.
[16:46.680 --> 16:49.360]  I'm very impressed with the ID stronghold wallet.
[16:49.360 --> 16:53.440]  Get the most trusted brand in RFID blocking wallets and protect yourself from electronic
[16:53.440 --> 16:54.440]  pickpocketing.

[16:55.440 --> 17:04.240]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[17:04.240 --> 17:08.320]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's
[17:08.320 --> 17:10.080]  medical expenses.
[17:10.080 --> 17:15.040]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[17:15.040 --> 17:17.120]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[17:17.120 --> 17:19.240]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[17:19.240 --> 17:25.520]  Any guidelines, discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy, go to libertyoncall.org.
[17:25.520 --> 17:28.920]  That's libertyoncall.org.

[17:33.400 --> 17:35.640]  best for you and your family.
[17:35.640 --> 17:39.760]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey purified water.
[17:39.760 --> 17:45.680]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size, for incredibly delicious
[17:45.680 --> 17:48.320]  water now and in an emergency.

[18:04.280 --> 18:09.400]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[18:09.400 --> 18:13.440]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[18:13.440 --> 18:17.800]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[18:17.800 --> 18:23.120]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[18:23.120 --> 18:29.520]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at infowarslife.com.
[18:29.520 --> 18:34.640]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[18:34.640 --> 18:36.560]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[18:36.560 --> 18:41.040]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[18:41.040 --> 18:43.640]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[18:43.640 --> 18:48.080]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[18:48.080 --> 18:51.560]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[18:56.480 --> 18:57.840]  my favorite coffee.
[18:57.840 --> 18:59.840]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[18:59.840 --> 19:02.840]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[19:02.840 --> 19:03.840]  Victor, you're calling?
[19:03.840 --> 19:04.840]  Go ahead.
[19:04.840 --> 19:05.840]  Yes.
[19:05.840 --> 19:06.840]  Hi, Alex.
[19:06.840 --> 19:12.120]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering
[19:12.120 --> 19:13.120]  all the time.
[19:13.120 --> 19:17.400]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[19:17.400 --> 19:22.040]  In particular, Silver Bullet, as soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, maybe
[19:22.040 --> 19:27.360]  like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet, and I'll still feel a
[19:27.360 --> 19:29.560]  little sick, but it won't last as long.
[19:29.560 --> 19:33.000]  I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.040]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[19:35.040 --> 19:38.440]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation because a very small percentage
[19:38.440 --> 19:42.600]  of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products.
[19:42.600 --> 19:43.600]  Thank you.
[19:43.600 --> 19:48.520]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98%
[19:48.520 --> 19:49.520]  review.
[19:49.520 --> 19:53.520]  It is our highest-reviewed product because it is from the top lab in the country discounted
[19:53.520 --> 19:56.520]  high-quality Colloidal Silver, and it's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing
[19:56.520 --> 20:03.640]  you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[20:03.640 --> 20:24.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:24.080 --> 20:29.040]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[20:29.040 --> 20:39.040]  Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the Infowars.com studios.
[20:39.040 --> 20:46.600]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, all hell is breaking loose.
[20:46.600 --> 20:54.000]  President Trump has come out making pro-gun control statements, and I know what he's doing.
[20:54.000 --> 21:00.160]  He's attempting to neutralize all the hysteria and all the opposition so that he can, quote,
[21:00.160 --> 21:01.360]  propose something reasonable.
[21:01.360 --> 21:06.200]  They'll propose something that's draconian, and then nothing gets done, just like he
[21:06.200 --> 21:08.640]  did with the whole DREAM Act.
[21:08.640 --> 21:10.720]  He proposed something that was pretty reasonable.
[21:10.720 --> 21:14.080]  Okay, 1.8 million people have been here for decades, not criminals.
[21:14.080 --> 21:16.440]  Okay, fast-track to citizenship.
[21:16.440 --> 21:17.440]  Everybody else, you're out.
[21:17.440 --> 21:20.080]  He's done everything he said he would do there.
[21:20.080 --> 21:27.280]  But now we learn Trump stuns lawmakers with seeming embrace of comprehensive gun control.
[21:27.280 --> 21:30.600]  And a lot of people are saying they're done with Trump.
[21:30.600 --> 21:31.600]  His base is really upset.
[21:31.600 --> 21:35.080]  They're really upset the NRA for agreeing to bump stocks.
[21:35.080 --> 21:38.720]  Then it's, oh, up to 21, not able to buy a rifle.
[21:38.720 --> 21:41.760]  And then every time there's going to be another shooting, it's always going to happen out
[21:41.760 --> 21:44.640]  of 330 million people.
[21:44.640 --> 21:47.280]  Mass shootings are very, very rare, but the media magnifies them.
[21:47.280 --> 21:49.480]  There's still tragedies.
[21:49.480 --> 21:51.720]  You get put in a position of losing your second amendment.
[21:51.720 --> 21:55.920]  Let's call Larry Pratt, let's get him on today, of Gunners of America, because the NRA the
[21:55.920 --> 21:59.280]  last five, six years has been no compromise, and that's been great.
[21:59.280 --> 22:03.760]  But now they're really starting to slide because a Republican is in office.
[22:03.760 --> 22:06.800]  CNN calls it surreal.
[22:06.800 --> 22:12.760]  Trump meeting on guns, let Republicans reeling, Democrats optimistic.
[22:12.760 --> 22:21.360]  And there's this video that we've got of the Democratic senators, like Feinstein smiling.
[22:21.360 --> 22:26.640]  When Trump says this, we're going to play that in a moment, Feinstein can't even get
[22:26.640 --> 22:28.840]  the nomination in California.
[22:28.840 --> 22:32.880]  She can't even get the groups to endorse her to run.
[22:32.880 --> 22:35.160]  She's so unpopular.
[22:35.160 --> 22:37.320]  And there's Trump being buddy buddy with her.
[22:37.320 --> 22:39.440]  I believe this was a tactic.
[22:39.440 --> 22:46.040]  I've seen Trump do it before, but regardless, he can see where the momentum's going up.
[22:46.040 --> 22:51.720]  There's more of these shootings, and they believe he'll end up losing the election and
[22:51.720 --> 22:53.080]  we'll lose 2018.
[22:53.080 --> 22:54.080]  That is not the case.
[22:54.080 --> 22:57.720]  It will cause Republicans to desert the party and will cause the Democrats to have a huge
[22:57.720 --> 22:58.720]  landslide.
[22:58.720 --> 22:59.720]  Have they gotten to the president?
[22:59.720 --> 23:00.720]  Let me tell you something.
[23:00.720 --> 23:01.720]  They genuinely hate him.
[23:01.720 --> 23:06.880]  They hate everybody that ever supported him, and he's gotten 60 plus percent of his agenda
[23:06.880 --> 23:11.280]  through, I agree with the Heritage Foundation, in just 14 months, killing TPP, renegotiating
[23:11.280 --> 23:16.400]  NAFTA and GATT, massively controlling the borders, crushing political correctness, trillions
[23:16.400 --> 23:20.040]  of the stock market, hundreds of billions of new jobs, millions of new jobs.
[23:20.040 --> 23:26.280]  I mean, I'm not going to list the whole raft again, but Trump about 100-something days
[23:26.280 --> 23:33.920]  in kind of suddenly veered left for about two months, then veered back to the nationalist.
[23:33.920 --> 23:38.760]  And so, Trump's smart.
[23:38.760 --> 23:41.960]  And so, I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt and thank God it's not Hillary, but
[23:41.960 --> 23:45.920]  we've got to run good people for Congress, run good people for the state houses.
[23:45.920 --> 23:49.480]  We've got to just keep moving forward like Trump's going to turn against us.
[23:49.480 --> 23:52.480]  And we've got to start making preparations for that, obviously.
[23:52.480 --> 23:54.680]  This is a really, really sad situation.
[23:54.680 --> 24:01.320]  Let's go ahead and play Dianne Feinstein, the complete political dead duck, and by that
[24:01.320 --> 24:04.320]  of lame duck, you know, it's going to be out of office soon, I call a politician that
[24:04.320 --> 24:07.440]  everybody can't stand in their own party, and it's hated by the other party, and hated
[24:07.440 --> 24:13.720]  by the people, and who's old and out of touch and bumbling around a dead duck politically.
[24:13.720 --> 24:15.600]  That's my term I'm coining.
[24:15.600 --> 24:18.400]  And or a dead, dead turkey, maybe that's a good term.
[24:18.400 --> 24:22.640]  You know, an old, old rotten turkey, man, that's about her term, she's a politically
[24:22.640 --> 24:23.640]  rotten turkey.
[24:23.640 --> 24:28.240]  It's a good term, turkeys, you know, something that fails, something that isn't good, rotten
[24:28.240 --> 24:29.240]  turkey is really bad.
[24:29.240 --> 24:33.600]  So Dianne Feinstein is a rotten turkey, here she is smiling like a, you know what, eating
[24:33.600 --> 24:34.600]  a rat next to Trump.
[24:34.600 --> 24:39.880]  So if you could add that to this bill, that would be great, Dianne, if you could add what
[24:39.880 --> 24:47.360]  you have also, and I think you can, into the bill, can you do that, Joe, can you do that,
[24:47.360 --> 24:50.800]  Pat, can you add some of the things you're not going to agree with?
[24:50.800 --> 24:51.800]  Yeah, you help.
[24:51.800 --> 24:56.480]  Well, no, I'll help, but can you add what Amy and what Dianne have, can we add them in?
[24:56.480 --> 24:57.960]  And I know you can add what John has.
[24:57.960 --> 25:01.960]  We have another domestic violence bill that's very narrow, and it's about dating partners,
[25:01.960 --> 25:05.680]  and a number of states have just enacted it with Republicans.
[25:05.680 --> 25:06.680]  We're going to get it passed.
[25:06.680 --> 25:07.680]  Yeah.
[25:07.680 --> 25:08.680]  We're going to get it passed.
[25:08.680 --> 25:16.800]  If you can add domestic violence, paragraphs, pages into this bill, I'm all for it.
[25:16.800 --> 25:21.680]  And look at the little corrupt Democrats that lust after disarming the American people,
[25:21.680 --> 25:30.040]  having just criminal looks in their eyes, Feinstein could be the Wicked Witch of the East in the
[25:30.040 --> 25:35.680]  famous Yellowbrick Road, Wizard of Oz, in fact, Tim McBreen, or whoever's hearing graphics,
[25:35.680 --> 25:41.920]  can we grab this and put her head on the witch ride in the bicycle, or I'll get you, my pretty.
[25:41.920 --> 25:47.080]  If you're not a radio listener, can we blow this up for TV viewers, can we blow the footage
[25:47.080 --> 25:54.320]  up there to the, yes, blow that up, and just loop that, just visually, but also with the
[25:54.320 --> 26:02.880]  cackling, she looks like a demon witch, the archetypal, oh, yes, oh, finally, oh, oh,
[26:02.880 --> 26:06.040]  yeah, go ahead and roll the audio again, please.
[26:06.040 --> 26:13.120]  Can you do that, Joe, can you do that, Pat, can you add some of the shows, and I think
[26:13.120 --> 26:17.680]  you can, into the film.
[26:17.680 --> 26:24.040]  Actually rubbing their hands together, look, oh, never seen the footage when Hitler and
[26:24.040 --> 26:29.520]  Hermann Göring had taken over Czechoslovakia, and then France capitulates, and Hitler's
[26:29.520 --> 26:33.600]  in Germany, it's newsreel, he's about to travel by train the next day to Paris, and
[26:33.600 --> 26:38.960]  him and Hermann Göring, the head of the Luftwaffe, big old fat Hermann Göring, are rubbing their
[26:38.960 --> 26:47.160]  hands together greedily, I mean, this is unbelievable, Operation Toto will defeat them, that's what
[26:47.160 --> 26:54.720]  Info Wars is, but this image right here, this may sink Trump, because the left will never
[26:54.720 --> 27:00.760]  vote for him, even if he became Mao Zedong, because they're sub-rainwashed, and so I don't
[27:00.760 --> 27:05.040]  know what planet Trump's on, I don't know if it has to do with the Carter Page thing,
[27:05.040 --> 27:09.600]  because our CIA sources told us last week on air, they were really worried about sex
[27:09.600 --> 27:13.600]  ops bringing down the president or compromising him, and they said, that's all we're going
[27:13.600 --> 27:17.720]  to say, that was Pachining, and of course his sources are in the Pentagon, the CIA at
[27:17.720 --> 27:22.640]  the highest levels, and they said, man, people may get freaked out real soon, it looks like
[27:22.640 --> 27:27.360]  they may have all the Stormy Daniels business, and all this other stuff, you know, women
[27:27.360 --> 27:33.680]  got King David in trouble, he got himself in trouble, but this is amazing, but you
[27:33.680 --> 27:39.520]  know, even if you keep your nose clean, doesn't matter, because what's happened to us has
[27:39.520 --> 27:50.120]  come along, and I'm just glad the case that they cooked up is so fraudulent, so ridiculous,
[27:50.120 --> 28:02.360]  so over the top, Newsweek says, Jones is being investigated for sexual assault, that's right,
[28:02.360 --> 28:09.360]  sexual assault and racial discrimination, she claims, she hugged me once and I touched
[28:09.360 --> 28:17.480]  her side, not even true, not even true, and that then turns into sexual assault, and they
[28:17.480 --> 28:23.880]  claim we wear Nazi shoes with swastikas on them, I'm not kidding, totally false, and
[28:23.880 --> 28:27.640]  then that we have open carry guns everywhere, no, sometimes we'll show a rifle on air, but
[28:27.640 --> 28:31.960]  we don't, you don't do open carry with handguns in Texas, that's illegal, we have concealed
[28:31.960 --> 28:36.080]  carry here, there's no, and Ashley asked for a concealed carry class, we have somebody
[28:36.080 --> 28:39.560]  here that works here, went and gave her a class, we have video of that, so what I'm
[28:39.560 --> 28:46.320]  saying is every piece, every piece of what they say we have the opposite, except for
[28:46.320 --> 28:49.800]  the one little frame up part, but then we were able to catch who was behind that as
[28:49.800 --> 28:56.400]  well, I mean this is amazing what they've stepped into.
[28:56.400 --> 29:04.920]  Hear that, that's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked
[29:04.920 --> 29:11.160]  the place, and what they don't steal will be destroyed, this year, resolve not to be
[29:11.160 --> 29:16.640]  the next victim of a break in, go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion

[33:03.560 --> 33:17.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:17.440 --> 33:19.440]  Big Brother.
[33:19.440 --> 33:22.640]  Mainstream media.
[33:22.640 --> 33:23.640]  Government coverups.
[33:23.640 --> 33:24.640]  You want answers?
[33:24.640 --> 33:25.640]  Well, so does he.
[33:25.640 --> 33:26.640]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[33:26.640 --> 33:27.640]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[33:27.640 --> 33:37.640]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:37.640 --> 33:49.200]  We're now 34 minutes in, or 33 minutes in, to the 34 hour live broadcast that we announced
[33:49.200 --> 33:54.960]  we were going to start doing last week today, on March 1st, 2018.
[33:54.960 --> 33:59.480]  And it's called Operation Paul Revere 2018 to defend our free speech, to defend the
[33:59.480 --> 34:03.320]  Internet, and to defend the Second Amendment.
[34:03.320 --> 34:06.160]  And boy, is that not more true now today than ever.
[34:06.160 --> 34:10.520]  Who would have known that this would be the first broadcast day where I'd have a chance
[34:10.520 --> 34:17.920]  to respond to thousands of articles, and it's on national television everywhere, headline
[34:17.920 --> 34:23.600]  Alex Jones accused of sexual assault.
[34:23.600 --> 34:28.240]  Alex Jones accused of gay grooming.
[34:28.240 --> 34:33.640]  Alex Jones accused of threatening people with firearms.
[34:33.640 --> 34:40.720]  Alex Jones, employees wearing Nazi shoes with swastikas.
[34:40.720 --> 34:48.600]  The most insane media behavior we've ever seen.
[34:48.600 --> 34:51.480]  And then I've got the EEOC twin complaint.
[34:51.480 --> 34:59.080]  They don't tell you the individuals were in a relationship together.
[34:59.080 --> 35:04.800]  And then there's a little thing called evidence, there's none of that.
[35:04.800 --> 35:09.760]  And we can sit there and debunk the entire thing.
[35:09.760 --> 35:15.920]  But our listeners, our supporters don't buy any of it because they know the climate we're
[35:15.920 --> 35:25.200]  in, they see where we are, and it's just like the prairie home companion guy where the woman
[35:25.200 --> 35:28.680]  hugged him and his hands supposedly touched her back.
[35:28.680 --> 35:33.240]  That's what they're calling sex assault.
[35:33.240 --> 35:38.160]  But the difference is I never even, she was always trying to hug me and I was never letting
[35:38.160 --> 35:39.160]  her do it.
[35:39.160 --> 35:43.040]  You can ask any employees around here.
[35:43.040 --> 35:45.480]  I'm not stupid.
[35:45.480 --> 35:49.160]  And that's why we are getting all the affidavits and we already have the write-ups in the
[35:49.160 --> 35:54.400]  video and the audio and we already have everything and we're not stupid.
[35:54.400 --> 35:55.800]  We're not stupid.
[35:55.800 --> 35:57.440]  And so I actually thank God.
[35:57.440 --> 35:58.440]  I'm sad for the crew.
[35:58.440 --> 36:02.320]  They got falsely accused of stuff just to add to the script that they created.
[36:02.320 --> 36:09.800]  But, and I mean, you can see how this was written as a script because the media builds
[36:09.800 --> 36:12.720]  on a script.
[36:12.720 --> 36:15.720]  I do some ads with my shirt off, the media makes a big deal about it, I go on the young
[36:15.720 --> 36:19.600]  turks with my shirt off as a joke, and then it turns into Joneses around the office talking
[36:19.600 --> 36:25.360]  everyone with his shirt off, even though it might be twice a year that I'm running from
[36:25.360 --> 36:30.320]  a bathroom back to my office to get a shirt or something, and I'm pulling my shirt on
[36:30.320 --> 36:32.680]  for the show if I'm late.
[36:32.680 --> 36:39.240]  But then that's it, like he patted it on the back and once his shirt was off and they
[36:39.240 --> 36:42.960]  had firearms and she was scared of them and they were all over the place.
[36:42.960 --> 36:47.040]  Meanwhile, I want to go take a concealed carry course, please, here, Ashley, we'll videotape
[36:47.040 --> 36:52.480]  you at your concealed carry wearing info or shirts, so let's put that on screen.
[36:52.480 --> 36:59.120]  We've got all the audio, we've got all the video, we've got everything debunked.
[36:59.120 --> 37:04.520]  It's just then, look at that big smile there in the horrible office with the guns and the
[37:04.520 --> 37:05.920]  guns are all in instant access.
[37:05.920 --> 37:11.840]  This will save people who have concealed carries, and we're in Texas.
[37:11.840 --> 37:14.760]  We're not in North Korea, but I'm going to get to that next segment.
[37:14.760 --> 37:17.880]  Let me just do this, this segment.
[37:17.880 --> 37:25.280]  Look at these headlines, Marie Le Pen, she's set to win the French election in polls, criminally
[37:25.280 --> 37:27.680]  charged for anti-ISIS tweets.
[37:27.680 --> 37:33.520]  She spoke out against ISIS, that's illegal under French law, seriously, and she's been
[37:33.520 --> 37:34.520]  criminally charged.
[37:34.520 --> 37:37.840]  That's at NewsWars.com, that ought to shut her up.
[37:37.840 --> 37:42.400]  China just banned the letter in from the internet because it was being used in a new combination,
[37:42.400 --> 37:47.600]  Zizadong, combining the current dictator with the last dictator, who made himself a dictator
[37:47.600 --> 37:54.040]  of the Communist Party, he's already a dictator of the party, which is a dictatorship.
[37:54.040 --> 37:55.040]  So that's been banned.
[37:55.040 --> 37:57.160]  This is an example of where we are.
[37:57.160 --> 38:01.160]  And then Trump to take the guns first, go through new process, second, boy, what a horrible
[38:01.160 --> 38:02.160]  quote.
[38:02.160 --> 38:06.080]  That's because they didn't go after all the warning signs or follow the law to stop the
[38:06.080 --> 38:08.440]  supposed shooter, Nick Cruz.
[38:08.440 --> 38:12.840]  And so Trump's just kind of brainstorming for hours, and the media is taking that and
[38:12.840 --> 38:15.400]  making it sound like he's going to go for all this.
[38:15.400 --> 38:19.840]  You notice he said, though, you can introduce whatever you want, Diane Feinstein, into the
[38:19.840 --> 38:21.920]  Republican bill and we'll see.
[38:21.920 --> 38:23.320]  You may not get what you want.
[38:23.320 --> 38:28.120]  The point is, it'll scotch the whole deal.
[38:28.120 --> 38:34.600]  And Trump will look like he was reasonable when he knows it's unreasonable that they
[38:34.600 --> 38:36.200]  just want to incrementally get the guns.
[38:36.200 --> 38:40.040]  And these idiots just want to score political points and don't know he's playing them like
[38:40.040 --> 38:41.040]  a fiddle.
[38:41.040 --> 38:43.080]  Now, that's what my gut tells me he's doing.
[38:43.080 --> 38:47.400]  That's what I've seen him do at least five other cases the last 14 months.
[38:47.400 --> 38:51.520]  But let me tell you, I don't think you can play games even rhetorically with the Second
[38:51.520 --> 38:53.320]  Amendment like this.
[38:53.320 --> 38:58.640]  So I think this is a big miscalculation by the president and I don't like it.
[38:58.640 --> 39:04.520]  But we are now 38 minutes into Operation Paul Revere 2018.
[39:04.520 --> 39:08.800]  And I've never gone on air and gone this far.
[39:08.800 --> 39:13.760]  But I'll tell you right now, I'm proud of the fact we're under attack because I know
[39:13.760 --> 39:14.760]  these are bad people.
[39:14.760 --> 39:19.360]  Hillary Clinton can't believe she lost the election and it's one of her former chief
[39:19.360 --> 39:23.600]  lawyers that is running this whole lawsuit operation.
[39:23.600 --> 39:27.000]  And he even says in the Daily Mail, he makes political comments about how I'm a bad person
[39:27.000 --> 39:32.400]  that lies to my audience and how I do these bad things and this just adds to how bad
[39:32.400 --> 39:33.400]  I am.
[39:33.400 --> 39:39.160]  And then the media never even called to get a quote from me because they're not media,
[39:39.160 --> 39:41.440]  they're fake news, but you will hear the truth.
[39:41.440 --> 39:43.560]  You will know the truth.
[39:43.560 --> 39:45.120]  It's unbelievable.
[39:45.120 --> 39:51.280]  And it's, of course, the law firm is the one for Michael Jackson and all of it that's been
[39:51.280 --> 39:53.880]  hooked into all that Hollywood stuff.
[39:53.880 --> 39:54.880]  It's pretty amazing.
[39:54.880 --> 40:02.660]  Speaking of Hollywood, after hashtag Me Too Pepper Spray to giveaways in the Oscar Goody
[40:02.660 --> 40:08.440]  bags, meanwhile, street artists erects three billboards over Hollywood, Oscars for biggest
[40:08.440 --> 40:13.080]  pedophile goes to, and we should show some of those, show some of those.
[40:13.080 --> 40:16.600]  So they're using the Me Too as a distraction from the whole pedophile scandal that we
[40:16.600 --> 40:23.840]  told you was going to break about a year ago and has now broke.
[40:23.840 --> 40:26.160]  So here's what's happening.
[40:26.160 --> 40:29.600]  If you support us in this critical fight, we will win, we will take the contrary back
[40:29.600 --> 40:33.000]  and we'll take the world back because they know they can try to kill the president or
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.760]  impeach him or shut him down, but they know if there's talk radio, they know if there's
[40:36.760 --> 40:41.480]  drugs report, they know if there's info wars, they know that we're the hardcore folks that
[40:41.480 --> 40:42.680]  hit the barbed wire.
[40:42.680 --> 40:46.440]  You hit the barbed wire, we bring up the hard topics, we take the heat, we make it safe
[40:46.440 --> 40:48.120]  for others to say.
[40:48.120 --> 40:53.680]  We change the discussion on the real issues and they've decided that we were critical
[40:53.680 --> 40:55.920]  in losing Hillary the election.
[40:55.920 --> 40:58.440]  And they have said, info wars is the key.
[40:58.440 --> 41:02.000]  They've decided to destroy us and they've said if we can bring them down, we'll bring
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.760]  everybody down, just like they all the headlines saying ban Jones off the internet entirely.
[41:06.760 --> 41:12.240]  Don't just ban him off YouTube, kick him off, talk radio, arrest him, he's a liar.
[41:12.240 --> 41:13.760]  He doesn't have his free speech.
[41:13.760 --> 41:17.080]  Then they lie about what I've said, even if it was true, I have my free speech.
[41:17.080 --> 41:23.040]  You have to adjudicate that in a court, you know, for defamation, not just say I'm banned.
[41:23.040 --> 41:27.680]  So you can pull up the headlines, info wars is, you know, one step away from banning,
[41:27.680 --> 41:30.680]  being banned on YouTube.
[41:30.680 --> 41:35.240]  And so we said this the last few days, we said they're getting ready for something big
[41:35.240 --> 41:40.120]  against info wars because they're trying to silence us and trying to demonize us.
[41:40.120 --> 41:45.320]  Instead of being a demonization campaign every month and then every week, it's every day.
[41:45.320 --> 41:48.240]  And now it's every few hours.
[41:48.240 --> 41:53.360]  And really, I really am honored to be at this level of demonization attack.
[41:53.360 --> 41:54.360]  It shows how effective we are.
[41:54.360 --> 41:58.480]  I think about the soldiers that have fought and died to create this country and then to
[41:58.480 --> 41:59.480]  keep this country.
[41:59.480 --> 42:03.320]  I think about the wives and family that lost those men and women and I think about all
[42:03.320 --> 42:07.680]  my ancestors, a lot of them were hardworking, you know, really good people, always known
[42:07.680 --> 42:11.360]  as being honorable, straight and strong, both sides of my family were known for that genetically
[42:11.360 --> 42:12.360]  and culturally.
[42:12.360 --> 42:18.120]  But when it comes to fighting tyrants and dying and but changing history, we're all over
[42:18.120 --> 42:24.600]  it from 1776 to 1836, right through World War One, World War Two, Vietnam, the Cold War,
[42:24.600 --> 42:29.280]  my family's been there, will sometimes misguided, but fighting for the Republic, fighting for
[42:29.280 --> 42:33.200]  Western culture, fighting for the Renaissance, and I am very honored.
[42:33.200 --> 42:37.600]  I feel for my family and crew around us, I've warned them about this, that they could be
[42:37.600 --> 42:39.360]  targeted as well to try to bring the place down.
[42:39.360 --> 42:41.960]  If they can't get me to buckle, they're going to come after you.
[42:41.960 --> 42:43.720]  But you're strong, you understand that.
[42:43.720 --> 42:49.280]  So I trust in God, I trust in our audience, and I trust in Providence to carry us through.
[42:49.280 --> 42:53.760]  I am extremely honored to be in this position and I commit to you that I will be as strong
[42:53.760 --> 42:59.280]  as I can and stay the course full speed ahead.
[42:59.280 --> 43:04.240]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[43:04.240 --> 43:05.960]  and joint support.
[43:05.960 --> 43:09.120]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[43:09.120 --> 43:12.920]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[43:12.920 --> 43:17.280]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[43:17.280 --> 43:21.440]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[43:21.440 --> 43:25.800]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption to
[43:25.800 --> 43:31.360]  help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much
[43:31.360 --> 43:32.360]  more.
[43:32.360 --> 43:37.780]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our
[43:37.780 --> 43:42.920]  turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[43:42.920 --> 43:48.880]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme
[43:48.880 --> 43:51.760]  to work synergistically for full body support.
[43:51.760 --> 44:01.440]  Buy bodies today at InfoWarsLife.com or call us at 1-88-253-3139.
[44:01.440 --> 44:05.480]  Over a year in the making produced by one of the top organic herbs in the country that
[44:05.480 --> 44:10.400]  if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm going to speak for hours just on the files
[44:10.400 --> 44:14.680]  I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this.
[44:14.680 --> 44:19.880]  This is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year, but
[44:19.880 --> 44:26.040]  the immune wall is incredible and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70-80.
[44:26.040 --> 44:27.640]  It's a great deal at $39.
[44:27.640 --> 44:33.720]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf, and so much more, it is concentrated, you need
[44:33.720 --> 44:35.320]  to go read what is in here.
[44:35.320 --> 44:40.320]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly
[44:40.320 --> 44:41.320]  accelerate.
[44:41.320 --> 44:44.320]  A citrus peel blend, I mean this is the next level.
[44:44.320 --> 44:48.480]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, immune wall, I think it's beyond seasonal.
[44:48.480 --> 44:53.840]  Quick-glucan, olive leaf, and more, immune wall, infowarsstore.com, infowarslive.com or
[44:53.840 --> 45:00.120]  triple-8-253-3139.
[45:00.120 --> 45:06.480]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[45:06.480 --> 45:12.880]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[45:12.880 --> 45:20.120]  or videos or other material from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[45:20.120 --> 45:25.040]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[45:25.040 --> 45:26.040]  at infowarsstore.com.
[45:26.040 --> 45:29.720]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[45:29.720 --> 45:33.560]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodide in it.
[45:33.560 --> 45:36.000]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[45:36.000 --> 45:40.080]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[45:40.080 --> 45:47.920]  and iodine as well, infowarslive.com or triple-8-253-3139 and your purchase of the products stands
[45:47.920 --> 45:51.480]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[45:51.480 --> 45:55.720]  satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are and
[45:55.720 --> 46:00.920]  they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[46:00.920 --> 46:05.680]  Introducing Fluorolife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by Infowarslife.
[46:05.680 --> 46:10.800]  For years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[46:10.800 --> 46:15.000]  Fluorolife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.080]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[46:19.080 --> 46:23.600]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted
[46:23.600 --> 46:28.200]  delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[46:28.200 --> 46:32.680]  Fluorolife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity,
[46:32.680 --> 46:35.120]  immunity, the gut lining and metabolism.
[46:35.120 --> 46:39.160]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[46:39.160 --> 46:44.040]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[46:44.040 --> 46:48.480]  Fluorolife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion
[46:48.480 --> 46:51.840]  probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[46:51.840 --> 46:56.120]  Head to Infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Fluorolife probiotics today.
[46:56.120 --> 47:03.600]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[47:03.600 --> 47:19.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:19.400 --> 47:20.400]  You want answers?
[47:20.400 --> 47:22.400]  Well, so does he.
[47:22.400 --> 47:27.960]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:27.960 --> 47:34.320]  Well, we knew something Meg was coming, and it's part of the anti-free speech globalist
[47:34.320 --> 47:42.560]  attack on anyone promoting a constitutional republic, anyone promoting a free society.
[47:42.560 --> 47:48.520]  We are now 47 minutes into the 34 hour emergency broadcast with my show, David Knight, Owen
[47:48.520 --> 47:49.520]  Schreuer and others.
[47:49.520 --> 47:56.320]  We're going to be broadcasting right through live until 6 o'clock tomorrow night on Friday.
[47:56.320 --> 48:03.000]  This is the official launch day, 24 hours a day on Galaxy 16.
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.840]  We're also on one other big satellite and we're going to be on another one we'll announce
[48:05.840 --> 48:06.840]  in the next week.
[48:06.840 --> 48:09.680]  But today was the day we officially went 24 hours a day on it.
[48:09.680 --> 48:14.360]  We had this planned for a couple months and notice this is the day they rolled out with
[48:14.360 --> 48:24.440]  Alex Jones, accused of sexual assault, wearing Nazi shoes and a bunch of other just completely
[48:24.440 --> 48:25.440]  insane stuff.
[48:25.440 --> 48:33.320]  And you actually read the EEOC report, it says a woman hugged me and I pat it her side.
[48:33.320 --> 48:36.680]  And then that's sexual assault and then that didn't even happen.
[48:36.680 --> 48:41.120]  But see, Newsweek and stuff take the EEOC report and then they don't actually quote
[48:41.120 --> 48:46.560]  it, they just make stuff up.
[48:46.560 --> 48:47.560]  It's incredible.
[48:47.560 --> 48:55.400]  I'm going to talk about that some and I've got some guests coming up.
[48:55.400 --> 48:57.520]  But there's all this other news and here I am again.
[48:57.520 --> 49:00.480]  I never plug hardly in the first hour hardly ever talk about it.
[49:00.480 --> 49:06.920]  That's what the 34 hour broadcast is about is to deal with all the other lawsuits.
[49:06.920 --> 49:12.080]  And here's the good news, the Democrat affiliated groups have filed eight lawsuits on me.
[49:12.080 --> 49:18.360]  Well, this will be nine in the last 14 months since Trump won the lawsuit started the week
[49:18.360 --> 49:19.360]  after he won.
[49:19.360 --> 49:26.960]  So I guess it's about 16, 17 months ago and they're so frivolous they get thrown out they're
[49:26.960 --> 49:27.960]  trying to break us.
[49:27.960 --> 49:28.960]  They think we're going to give up.
[49:28.960 --> 49:34.000]  We just lawyer it up and negotiated good deals with the lawyers and you know how many have
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.680]  got it covered as long as you financially support us.
[49:36.680 --> 49:40.960]  But I won't have money to fight all this and launch these satellites that have affiliate
[49:40.960 --> 49:44.880]  relations with cable and TV stations that are picking us up like wildfire because their
[49:44.880 --> 49:48.840]  attempts to shut us down has really woken up station owners and managers and program
[49:48.840 --> 49:49.840]  directors.
[49:49.840 --> 49:51.640]  We're just exploding on television.
[49:51.640 --> 49:55.760]  We are not listing affiliates at this time because the affiliates appreciate that because
[49:55.760 --> 50:00.600]  then they get targeted and you know some but what are asked but that's way outweighed
[50:00.600 --> 50:02.920]  all the positive support they get.
[50:02.920 --> 50:09.680]  So we're offering the biggest savings ever and infowarstore.com to make it easy to support
[50:09.680 --> 50:10.680]  the broadcast.
[50:10.680 --> 50:13.840]  We also have a donate button we put on the front page of infowarstore.com.
[50:13.840 --> 50:16.640]  We're also going to have a pop up that pops up.
[50:16.640 --> 50:19.680]  We don't usually have those on the side, we're going to have a pop up next few days.
[50:19.680 --> 50:25.240]  Just make a straight up donation because when we sell stuff at 50% off, it's really 50%
[50:25.240 --> 50:26.240]  off.
[50:26.240 --> 50:32.800]  We sell it for 80% off, it's a lost leader even though a lot of these things have sold
[50:32.800 --> 50:33.800]  out.
[50:33.800 --> 50:37.600]  I mean I told you bodies ultimate turmeric formula and 50% off is going to sell out.
[50:37.600 --> 50:39.480]  It sold out, we're not getting more for two months.
[50:39.480 --> 50:42.760]  I'm kind of not good at that sometimes you know because I should have it go back to regular
[50:42.760 --> 50:45.960]  price and then kind of have it run out by the time the new stuff gets in but I want
[50:45.960 --> 50:47.720]  you to see how great it is.
[50:47.720 --> 50:51.760]  So a bunch of those specials ended because they sold out.
[50:51.760 --> 50:59.280]  We've got Operation Paul Revere 2018 special, 30 to 80% off site wide plus free shipping
[50:59.280 --> 51:02.880]  I should have added that yesterday plus the free shipping.

[51:23.640 --> 51:30.160]  Backpack Insert 20% off but here's what I'm telling you.
[51:30.160 --> 51:33.240]  They think they can crush your will with bullying.
[51:33.240 --> 51:37.960]  They think they can crush your will by harassing everybody that's libertarian or conservative
[51:37.960 --> 51:38.960]  or Christian.
[51:38.960 --> 51:40.360]  They think they've got our kids in the schools.
[51:40.360 --> 51:45.040]  If you take action and you start a YouTuber or Facebook or your own local radio show or
[51:45.040 --> 51:48.840]  a local newsletter or write articles for the paper or letters to the editor, whatever
[51:48.840 --> 51:52.600]  you little bit you do builds up and we'll win.
[51:52.600 --> 51:56.360]  When you march, when you demonstrate, I'm going to start demonstrating more because
[51:56.360 --> 51:58.120]  they're trying to shut us off the web.
[51:58.120 --> 51:59.120]  We've got to hit the streets.
[51:59.120 --> 52:00.120]  I'm going to protest Google.
[52:00.120 --> 52:01.120]  You name it.
[52:01.120 --> 52:02.120]  Very soon.
[52:02.120 --> 52:04.000]  We'll be announcing that.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.640]  We've got all our skin in the game because we know we're really up against bad people
[52:07.640 --> 52:14.520]  and at a spiritual level, at an instinctive level, they know we've got to oppose it.
[52:14.520 --> 52:16.920]  They know I love humanity.
[52:16.920 --> 52:18.040]  That's why they say I'm a racist.
[52:18.040 --> 52:20.480]  They know I love men and women and care about everybody.
[52:20.480 --> 52:24.480]  That's why they say I'm an abuser because they know it's the opposite.
[52:24.480 --> 52:28.160]  They know you know that and we knew this was coming and they want to send a message to
[52:28.160 --> 52:29.160]  you.
[52:29.160 --> 52:30.160]  You stand up.
[52:30.160 --> 52:31.360]  We're going to attack you.
[52:31.360 --> 52:32.360]  We're going to lie about you.
[52:32.360 --> 52:33.360]  Well, you know what?
[52:33.360 --> 52:35.600]  I'm honored to be lied about and I've warned crew when they get hired.
[52:35.600 --> 52:36.600]  This could happen.
[52:36.600 --> 52:40.680]  I'm proud they went through all our former employees and the current ones and it took
[52:40.680 --> 52:45.800]  BuzzFeed and others and Daily Mail years to find people that would engage in Judas
[52:45.800 --> 52:53.520]  Iscariot type activities, Benedict Arnold activities in my opinion because we can refute
[52:53.520 --> 53:00.480]  all this and we have evidence to refute it and we have employees that have been wrong.
[53:00.480 --> 53:04.920]  Daria doesn't want her last name used because she's one of the only women ever in the most
[53:04.920 --> 53:10.120]  elite units of special operations because she's a translator and can speak Arabic, Russian,
[53:10.120 --> 53:11.120]  you name it.
[53:11.120 --> 53:12.120]  Her parents come over here, anti-communist.
[53:12.120 --> 53:16.000]  She's been here in the U.S. since she was what, like eight, nine years old and they
[53:16.000 --> 53:26.480]  just call her in this filing a Russian operative, a Russian agent when and she's not even mad.
[53:26.480 --> 53:29.200]  She says, yeah, they've gone too far.
[53:29.200 --> 53:34.360]  But if it has any repercussions on her and her family or anything, serious defamation.
[53:34.360 --> 53:41.160]  You can't call a woman where people like her would talk about it, G.I.
[53:41.160 --> 53:42.160]  Jane's fake.
[53:42.160 --> 53:44.680]  This is real.
[53:44.680 --> 53:49.920]  And you just sit there and you call somebody, talk about discrimination, talk about defamation,
[53:49.920 --> 53:56.240]  talk about, because of somebody's nationality, you call them an agent of a foreign power
[53:56.240 --> 54:01.880]  when they're a bona fide American patriot and a decorated veteran with over 100 combat
[54:01.880 --> 54:04.880]  jumps, you name it.
[54:04.880 --> 54:07.480]  She doesn't want to be talking about it, but I've been told about other people once we
[54:07.480 --> 54:11.960]  hired her with her great resume and all of her backgrounds and all of her defense language
[54:11.960 --> 54:17.720]  school and all her great record and everything in the military for all those years.
[54:17.720 --> 54:19.680]  And I talked to other people in the military, they're like, yeah, you know who that is?
[54:19.680 --> 54:25.280]  That's one of the only women ever in the most elite units there are.
[54:25.280 --> 54:31.640]  And then you just say in the file, Jones was there meeting with his Russian, but they say
[54:31.640 --> 54:34.920]  his Russian operative to get orders.
[54:34.920 --> 54:41.960]  I mean, Hillary's lawyer says, oh, this proves how bad Alex Jones is, he even makes a political
[54:41.960 --> 54:42.960]  statement.
[54:42.960 --> 54:50.120]  He brags, I'm Hillary Clinton's former lawyer and he is, he clerked for, this is her lawyer,
[54:50.120 --> 54:54.560]  her personal lawyer that handle stuff for her and she can't believe she lost the election
[54:54.560 --> 55:01.600]  and she's not all hell turned to try to do all this and the guy, it's the law firm of
[55:01.600 --> 55:04.560]  Michael Jackson and all these people.
[55:04.560 --> 55:11.400]  And they just say in there in a federal document as if it's total proof that she is a Russian
[55:11.400 --> 55:15.920]  operative and our Russian controller, basically.
[55:15.920 --> 55:20.280]  And so I can't even get into it because I've got a list of things I want to go over and
[55:20.280 --> 55:26.520]  I've got to just do it later in the show because it's all just crazy.
[55:26.520 --> 55:30.280]  So here's the deal.
[55:30.280 --> 55:33.800]  But I don't have to worry about money because I know how to go out and advertise and market
[55:33.800 --> 55:37.840]  and they cut this off, I do this, I mean, I spent a lot of my time in front of the operation.
[55:37.840 --> 55:38.840]  I'm not complaining.
[55:38.840 --> 55:44.880]  If you flood us with money and I mean a crap load, we will not have to sit there and mess
[55:44.880 --> 55:48.920]  with all this stuff and I can get really aggressive and I'm talking about legal defense, I'm
[55:48.920 --> 55:50.840]  about legal offense, you name it.
[55:50.840 --> 55:55.440]  It's all up to you how hard I strike back and believe me, I've already pulled the trigger.
[55:55.440 --> 55:57.160]  We are, this is it.
[55:57.160 --> 55:59.080]  This is skyfall.
[55:59.080 --> 56:04.800]  So everybody wants to make this personal and everybody loves her off.
[56:04.800 --> 56:12.920]  So this is a major miscalculation because, but again, they never get anything real.
[56:12.920 --> 56:16.000]  Don't you know they've been looking around?
[56:16.000 --> 56:17.640]  So they already tried to take my kids.
[56:17.640 --> 56:21.360]  They've already tried to do the government, the media, all these other groups.
[56:21.360 --> 56:26.960]  And now I believe and I think the evidence is overwhelming that this is political than
[56:26.960 --> 56:32.040]  they admit it's political and it's people believe they can do anything if it's against
[56:32.040 --> 56:33.540]  the opposition.
[56:33.540 --> 56:37.520]  I mean, I don't even go to YouTube and try to get CNN banned for bullying like they do
[56:37.520 --> 56:38.520]  to me.
[56:38.520 --> 56:39.520]  I just don't act like that.
[56:39.520 --> 56:40.920]  I don't operate like that.
[56:40.920 --> 56:46.400]  So infowarstore.com, there's a donate button and I know there's business owners.
[56:46.400 --> 56:47.400]  I know there's companies.
[56:47.400 --> 56:49.400]  I know there's all the nouveau rich people I know.
[56:49.400 --> 56:50.400]  You know what?
[56:50.400 --> 56:51.400]  I never asked Gary Haven for money.
[56:51.400 --> 56:55.200]  He's been here before and said, you know, I think I'm going to give you $50,000 to help
[56:55.200 --> 56:58.160]  do whatever project and I'm like, you know, Gary, you're doing enough giving it to Haiti
[56:58.160 --> 56:59.960]  and your planes and all the things you do.
[56:59.960 --> 57:01.960]  You just keep that money Gary and give it to Haiti.
[57:01.960 --> 57:04.760]  I'm going to call Gary and I'm going to say, Gary, you're a billionaire.
[57:04.760 --> 57:06.480]  I want a million dollars.
[57:06.480 --> 57:07.720]  I want $2 million.
[57:07.720 --> 57:08.720]  I want $5 million.
[57:08.720 --> 57:10.760]  I bet he gives it to me.
[57:10.760 --> 57:14.320]  And so I'm telling all the people that tried to give me money over the years, whether it's
[57:14.320 --> 57:20.040]  land, patents, whatever it is, flood us with money and you've got one guarantee.
[57:20.040 --> 57:24.800]  I will take that and I will wage war against the globalists and I will take them on and
[57:24.800 --> 57:26.040]  I will win.
[57:26.040 --> 57:27.040]  But you know what?
[57:27.040 --> 57:30.520]  We only expanded this operation and tried to shut me down 10 years.
[57:30.520 --> 57:33.080]  I've decided we're about to double in size.
[57:33.080 --> 57:38.840]  We're going total rampage mode, infowarstore.com, everybody buy the products and everybody donate
[57:38.840 --> 57:40.240]  and we will win.
[57:40.240 --> 57:45.520]  Flood me with greenbacks, the war chest and I will prosecute this war and I will win with
[57:45.520 --> 57:46.520]  God's grace.
[57:46.520 --> 57:57.600]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful

[58:58.840 --> 59:03.400]  From all the wives, tales and every culture, we know that the bones have the essence, we

[59:07.640 --> 59:14.360]  has been reported because it works and there's no way to quantify how strong this is but
[59:14.360 --> 59:20.920]  the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life

[59:44.440 --> 59:52.960]  I want to thank you all for your support, you are funding the Information War in 2018.
[59:52.960 --> 01:00:08.280]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:28.940]  Thank you very much.
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:45.940]  I got to be honest with you crank this up for a minute. Don't tread on me. I'm actually
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:01:09.940]  feeling leaf right now. We are broadcasting worldwide. It is a great honor to be here with you. We're
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:14.540]  already one hour into the 34 hour emergency broadcast to defend the internet, to defend free speech,
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:18.140]  and to defend the Second Amendment. That's what we named it a week ago when we announced it.
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:26.380]  And now look what we're in the middle of. All Hades breaking loose. I said I would get to a
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:33.140]  cogent focus statement about these incredible new false allegations. But there's so many angles
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:40.780]  and it's so false. It's just all lies. And then it's Hillary Clinton's former personal lawyer
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:46.780]  doing it and then making political statements about how I'm a bad person and I lie on air.
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:55.100]  So I just in this shows how bad I am just saying I'm guilty. Prosecutors don't even do that. They
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:02:04.420]  just say we're going to show. And then it's it's the Garagos firm that are like leading
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:09.620]  Armenians and Michael Jackson's lawyers. I guess that's what you get for fighting the young Turks
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:13.620]  saying there was Armenian genocide and having them try to kick me off the air. God, I got the
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:19.140]  Qatar money trying to get me off the air. I got the I guess I got the Armenians trying to get me
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:26.580]  out there. Good God. It's unbelievable. Man, I tell you a Democratic Party, it's just something
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:31.180]  wrong with it. It's just it's willing to do anything. And I think it's jumped the shark more
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:40.260]  ways than one. But very, very, very, very saddening. Another lot of great Armenians,
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:44.500]  they always shake my hand in airports and are big listeners and big fans. And one of the big
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:49.180]  TV stations were on zone by Armenian gentlemen. So they're great people. But I wonder if Garagos
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:56.260]  and Garagos is a couple of the brothers of the firm. I mean, it's like their number one lawyer
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:03.980]  under him, this Hillary, Hillary's former lawyer, doing this. And I'm just like, and then I looked
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.660]  at all the facts and looked at the record and talked to everybody and looked at what we had.
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:13.460]  I'm just like, good God, this is incredible. But I want to get into Trump. I want to get into the
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:22.300]  latest AI news. I want to get into Pelosi. I want to get into China censoring Winnie the Pooh.
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:30.780]  And the word R, the letter R, that's coming up. But I'm just going to say this. When I come back,
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:34.980]  I'm going to be focused as best I can, have the Ashley Beckford clip of her shooting guns ready
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:43.140]  please with audio. And we'll just walk through some of the falsehoods so that I can have one focus
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:47.220]  statement. I tried to get in here before the show and table statements. I could limit it and I was
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:52.100]  busy with other stuff and then get it done. So I knew it'd be hard to do it on air short and sweet
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:59.900]  because God almighty, it doesn't hurt me to have Newsweek say that I've been accused of sexually
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:07.540]  assaulting a woman or trying to groom a male employee for gay sex. It hurts me that the media is
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:13.780]  that bad because the EEOC complaint doesn't even say that says he hugged me once. I hugged him
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:20.020]  once and he touched me on the back. That's not even true. And then once we were filming the caveman,
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:25.060]  not caveman, it was the supermobile vitality. You guys cue that up. The caveman, I mean the
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:29.500]  supermobile vitality ad. He's dressed up like a caveman, Shane Schiner. That's why I keep saying
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:33.140]  we're like, why does his muscles look big? And he's all ripped. We were like trying to aim the
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:37.380]  lights in the studio. You'll see the footage coming up. So I'd go in this editing studio. It's
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:41.500]  got like four computers. We all go in this big studio and I pull up how to light bodybuilders.
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:46.460]  So it's guys like in bodybuilding poses. And then I left that day and Rob came back to work at
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:50.300]  night and I already like blew up and freaked out. And that's why later apologized. That's an HR
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:56.340]  record. We're like, dude, it's bodybuilders. He's like, no, you're grooming me for gayness. It was
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:04.580]  just crazy. Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:12.060]  and water supply that are making us fat, sick and stupid. So what do we do about it? Well,
[01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:18.420]  for starters, don't just sit there and take it. Fight back with the all new supercharged

[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:24.140]  this transmission, you are the resistance from deep in the heart of FEMA region six,
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:39.760]  Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. They've got a lot to cover. They've
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:44.940]  got 33 hours left in the worldwide 34 hour broadcast. We announced we were going to do
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:53.700]  last week on March 1st. Paul Revere, Operation Paul Revere 2018 in defense of internet freedom
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:57.620]  and defensive free speech in defense of the Second Amendment. And I had no idea that we'd
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:02.700]  be launching this emergency broadcast with YouTube trying to ban us, Facebook trying
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:10.740]  to ban us, the media, mainstream media, Glenn Beck, Dan Rather, Brian Stelter, all over
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:15.660]  television saying he needs to be banned from YouTube and the rest of the internet because
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:19.340]  we say he's fake news. Well, the president says you're fake news. Does that mean you get
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:26.740]  banned? So I really was thinking about what was happening and my wife said a few days
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:31.900]  ago at dinner, she said they're getting ready for something big. They want to shut you up.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:36.180]  They had to something really big that they're going to try to do to you. And then I talked
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:40.140]  to other smart folks and like Mike Adams, he said, before this even broke their stay
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:43.380]  on air, before we knew what it broke, it broke right, right then while he was on air, he
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:46.620]  said they're getting ready for something big against free speech and against the Second
[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:54.380]  Amendment. You name it. So let me just go through some of the disinformation and lies.
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:57.580]  If you just joined us, I'm going to move into other big news, but this is a big national
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:02.900]  news and they're not calling me for quotes. They're not going to have, you're not going
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:06.940]  to get to hear anything from me other than this show because this is what yellow journalism
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:11.500]  and fake news does. They take a Daily Mail article. Here it is. The radio listeners,
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:18.980]  I'll read it to you. Document cam shot, please. Friday, it says a fired info war staffers
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:26.860]  at war with Alex Jones. One claimed he was teased as the sites resident Jew or the African
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:32.820]  American worker said she was mocked for a skin tone and Jones grabbed her behind. None
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:41.140]  of them is true. That is all 1000% fake. It's like when they tested all my supplements
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:44.620]  and found them to be totally clean. And I said, watch, I'll just keep retesting until
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:49.300]  they magically say they're not. And of course that happened. We had a separate lab tested
[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:54.220]  and they said, no, it is clean. They don't give up. I mean, you think I'm going to put
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:58.300]  out supplements that aren't clean knowing they're going to give extra scrutiny? Plus
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:04.380]  I want you to get quality. So it's the same thing. Now the Daily Mail didn't tell anybody
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:07.860]  and I asked the Daily Mail writer, Mr. Perry, I said, you know, they're in a relationship
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:11.260]  and he goes, well, I'm not going to talk about that. But yeah. And I said, did you pay them?
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:15.100]  And he goes, I'm not going to discuss that. Well, I go, well, people deny they paid them
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:21.140]  if they didn't. And I said, well, it all come out in discovery then. Because see, that's
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:26.260]  different. You can file your EEOC and put the falsehoods there and then have it in the
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:30.620]  press. But you can't approach the media, have it all lined up, which we know it came before
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:36.540]  the filing, script it all with a law firm, violate your nondisclosure, not that they're
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:42.820]  even disclosing anything true. But the point is, is that they're going past that and then
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:50.540]  pay them. That's going to be the key. We've already got people on the ground. So it goes
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:58.180]  on from there. A, I don't believe those things. B, what person in their right gourd would
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:02.340]  ever do that? In fact, you go in the New York Times, Washington Post is hardly any quote
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:06.140]  minorities. It's all talk with leftist. Same thing in Hollywood. You come in here. There's
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:11.860]  people of every shape, color, creed, sex, you name it. Gay people, straight people, media
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:16.180]  always walks in and goes, half the people in here aren't white. I'm like, yeah, and
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:19.340]  a lot of the people in management are minorities and women. Yeah, it's just whoever does a
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:28.340]  good job. That's how we operate. We're libertarians. So they know how to attack us on our foundation.
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:37.100]  They hit us with the opposite of what we are. By the evening, three, four hours later, they
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:47.920]  had headlines out saying that I sexually assaulted her. So they take one group of disinformation
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:56.340]  and then it turns into sexual assault. So let's go over just some notes I wrote this
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:11:01.100]  morning that are the facts because all of this is absolutely not true. They couldn't
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:05.020]  get me to say it was true. So they called my dad in another building that deals with
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:08.660]  supplement and, and, and the HR over there. And he's like, I don't know anything about
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:13.220]  it, but you know, they're pretty nice. Like a locker room sometimes, but blah, blah, blah.
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:17.100]  So they can then act like somebody said there might be something. That's the one thing that
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:23.020]  got me mad. And I got mad yesterday when I was sitting there reading that the charges
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:27.660]  made against myself and info wars by two former employees are a compendium of lies and false
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:32.180]  information and twisting. We knew this was coming. This is how Hillary Clinton strikes
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:38.420]  back. This is why people fear her. And it's her main former lawyer says it on the website.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:50.820]  I'm a bad guy and this shows it and then I'm a liar on air in the statements to the mail.
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:12:02.340]  So this is how angry the Democrats are. So it goes on. This is the West Coast attack.
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:06.420]  I told you months ago we have Hillary's law firm and I can't disclose the details yet,
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:11.380]  but I will soon on the East Coast that we're engaged with. So West Coast, East Coast, it's
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:21.740]  called a pence for attack continuing here. Newsweek CNN articles in the week leading
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:27.180]  up to this calculated attack. There have been public efforts by deep state to pull down
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:31.300]  our YouTube, Facebook and Twitter so that we could not respond to these attacks when
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:37.820]  they hit, but they failed. And that's in Bloomberg today that they admit that it was fake strikes
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:41.500]  and that they were removed and that was fraudulent and that I did not say that the students did
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:46.820]  not die and I did not say they were crisis actors. That's Bloomberg, YouTube's new moderators
[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:51.380]  mistakenly pull right wing channels. And then the Verge also reported that they restored
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:57.980]  info wars. Fake, but at least two publications admitted it. They said it was a mistake. Yeah,
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:08.060]  continuing. There has been a public campaign by MSM for us to be banned off of the internet.
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:16.700]  The EOC complaints that have been filed are filled with vicious lies and fiction. So transparent
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:23.700]  via Russia gate. They say that they witnessed Daria who doesn't want to last name said on
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:28.980]  there. She was in army special operations. They said that Jones would meet to get orders
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:34.220]  from his Russian operative. I mean, you can imagine Democrats are sitting around and they're
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:39.420]  like, he said anti-Semitic stuff. He hates black people. And there's a Russian there
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:46.740]  running at all because out of 110 people, we have a army veteran who is Russian. Think
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:52.620]  about that. And then it goes on from there. And of course, MSM's favorite false charge
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:57.380]  of anti-Semitism, which again, is totally completely false. David Duke was on in a heated
[01:13:57.380 --> 01:14:03.780]  debate where we were fighting with each other and I was disagreeing with it. And Jacobson
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:08.140]  said, you have three Rob, he says, anti-Semitic. I called him Jacobson to people call me Jones
[01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:12.900]  in the office. That's in there too. He said, I want to get on and debate him and you explain
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:16.060]  him, I'm Jewish. This is a lie and I'm not running things. And I said, sure, buddy, come
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:21.740]  on on. He turns that in the complaint and says that without his permission, I said he
[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:25.500]  was Jewish. I have all the affidavits, all the witnesses when you came storming and saying,
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:31.740]  I want on air and I put you on air, Rob, to disagree with David Duke who I disagreed with
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:36.620]  and to have you be able to confront him. And he goes, I will speak to the Jewish individual
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:40.980]  and then you made a joke out of it and then you say we called you the Jewish individual.
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:45.420]  Shame on you, Rob. Shame on you. I know your parents, they're good people. You're better
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:53.980]  than that, Rob. Shame on you. And of course, MSM's favorite false flag anti-Semitism is
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:15:04.500]  totally bull. Looking up lighting for a body builder on a multi-shoot we were doing in
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:10.300]  the office and we went into, again, the main editing room where I had a computer, Rob had
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:15.460]  a computer and others had computers. And I Googled how to light a body builder because
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:20.340]  Shane didn't look as big as he does in person with the lighting in here. And then we leave
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:24.860]  that day, Rob goes in and sees body builders on a computer, runs over to HR, screams and
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:28.260]  yells. We have this all documented. He then apologizes when they go over and look at the
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:33.300]  computer and it's body building and the search says how to light a body builder at our office.
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:38.460]  For a body building shoot, I'm just showing you on video. And he flipped out at that.
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:44.180]  It's grooming for gay sex. He says that. He felt that was grooming him for gay sex. Well,
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:50.460]  here's the deal, Rob. I'm into girls, not guys. Okay? And everybody knows that. So
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:54.500]  I think you flatter yourself a little too much there. But hey, you're the one defaming
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:57.540]  me. You're the one.

[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:07.060]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection. Mitochondria produce over
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:13.480]  95% of your energy. They are your body's cellular engines. Cell Force helps promote your cellular
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:18.860]  energy production by supporting mitochondria, much like a cellular engine overhaul. Because
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:23.900]  when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:30.460]  oxygen species. Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage,
[01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:36.300]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species. The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:41.100]  of the most powerful available on the market. The stronger the antioxidant, the better its
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:47.740]  ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals. Boost, protect

[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:23.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Coming to you from the former United States
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:35.260]  of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:55.460]  We've got a short time employee, Rob Jacobson, who's been here like 14 years. He's been
[01:20:55.460 --> 01:21:04.660]  here for a long time. I know it's the lawyers, the Democratic Party, and things that are
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:13.460]  going to have to be dealt with. This is Hillary Clinton's main lawyer who has filed all this.
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:17.740]  I want to think it was when Ashley and he got together. We knew about it. People saw
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:22.100]  him out at restaurants, saw him together at his apartment. We knew about it. We just kind
[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:27.380]  of ignored it. But then she didn't really like Trump. I don't think she liked him from
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:31.820]  the time she got here. I don't know if this is part of the infiltration, the Southern
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:38.980]  Parvy Law Center and groups talk about the media matters, bragged how they're going
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:43.660]  to infiltrate media. But they got together. We kind of turned a blind eye to it. We weren't
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:49.740]  sure until after they left. I let her go and he got really, really, really upset. That's
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:54.340]  in all the HR files. Why that all got documented and that'll come out. And then once it's in
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:22:00.420]  a lawsuit, once it's there, we can give you all that stuff. It's pretty powerful information.
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:03.300]  And if they wish to start saying more stuff, I think we're going to go ahead and just bring
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:08.660]  it all out here. In fact, I'm real close to it. I do it today. We'll see. I'm not going
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:12.700]  to just sit here while I get crucified in the media. This could really give the mainstream
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:20.220]  media a big bloody nose if we release all this. I mean, I just am such a private guy
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:24.540]  and I have such a heart that even though I've been lied about massively, I have a tendency
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:34.460]  to just hold back. But continuing, looking up, uh, lighting for a bodybuilder on a multi
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:39.340]  use room with a bunch of terminals in an office that I shared with Jacobson for editing
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:43.500]  other employees, we looked up how to light bodybuilding and he ran over to HR. They came
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:48.300]  over because I was already gone. They went in. They're like, Oh, this says bodybuilding.
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:52.620]  This is, this is, this is bodybuilding. They should have bodybuilding shoot. And he apologized
[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:58.140]  and that's on record. And he'd even says that in the news reports. So that says, though,
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:04.740]  he felt like it was gay grooming. So the news week takes bodybuilding in a building with
[01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:11.980]  probably 50 editing computers with a shoot for super male vitality with a weight lifter.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:15.540]  My friend Shane Steiner, you all know him. Famous country singer. You name it. Brothers
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:23.540]  world champion rodeo. So this is dad. Good family friends and Shane's friends with Rob
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:29.860]  too is known him for 14 years. It's just bizarre. That is now, but the news never says that
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:37.500]  it's just newsweek says grooming gay people for gay stuff. This is how they operate.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:42.900]  We have free concealed carry classes several times a year. It was originally at her request.
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:46.700]  We've done since them a few other times and there is no open carry in the office, but
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:52.420]  they say there's open carry. She's anti gun, but we're pro gun and intimidated her. And
[01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:57.620]  this is just crazy. And then we'll get to some of the other points. But let's go to
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:03.460]  a special report with Ashley Beckford, who got hired as just an intern and we said, Hey,
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:08.220]  you want to be on air and then gave her two raises. And it says in there, we were bad.
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:12.620]  The raises weren't big enough. So my lawyers are very confident. They say none of this
[01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:19.700]  even makes sense. I talked to folks about the supposed image of a Hasidic Jew with Rob's
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:24.260]  face on it. And they said, Yeah, no, Rob had that on his computer. And we asked why. And
[01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:29.420]  then Rob do pulled it off his computer. And that was right before he left C. So you can
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:34.380]  see what's going on here. Let's go ahead and go to this part of this special report with
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:43.340]  Ashley Beckford. Here it is.
[01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:48.580]  Ashley shooting a Glock radio listener. She's got her info wars.com, Trump for president
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:55.460]  shirt or Hillary for president shirt. Hey, guys, give me the day to this report was this
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:25:04.060]  mid 2016. I'm Ashley Beckford reporting for info wars.com. As we know, guns are severely
[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:12.180]  demonized in our society. In fact, Chris Hayes from MSNBC recently said that he was glad
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:18.060]  that the terrorists who bombed Chelsea did not have a firearm because the carnage would
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:24.740]  have been much greater. What a joke. As we know, we've seen so many incidences where
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:30.780]  people with Islamic backgrounds have been procuring firearms and then using them to
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:37.580]  inflict deadly carnage. They've been attacking people from San Bernardino quote workplace
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:44.460]  violence to the Orlando nightclub shooting hate crime. We have people all over the country
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:49.460]  and all over the world who are attacking people with guns. That's why I realized in order
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:54.340]  to be a true feminist, I had to learn to protect myself.
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:26:01.500]  Now, she says that it was a culture of guns that intimidated her and we have emails where
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:07.780]  she requested and others requested the free class. By the way, taught by a black firearms
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:12.580]  instructor is our good buddy, Mr. Cargill. In this uncertain world, I knew that I needed
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:18.940]  to take advantage of the Texas laws and go ahead and get my concealed handgun license
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:24.980]  and my license to carry by going ahead and going to Central Texas Gun Works met Michael
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:31.500]  Cargill. He's a friend and fan of the show and it only took one day. It only took a few
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:36.740]  hours for me. She says in there that we were white supremacist. She also said on our Facebook
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:42.460]  and by the way, Ashley, we saved all that stuff here on Facebook before you filed this
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:47.820]  one, Rob, we filed and we got all the other stuff off your Facebook before you deleted
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:54.420]  it. It's all saved. We're not stupid. We figured it out about a month before Rob and we figured
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:27:00.180]  this might get pulled, Rob. And so don't know how it's going to go for Hillary's former
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:10.100]  top lawyer, Ben Macellis who brags on his own law firm website about this. I can't
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:18.860]  look at any more of it. Can we play the Superman vitality ad though from four years ago with
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:24.020]  Leanne McAdoo who wanted to be in the shoot, wanted to be in the caveman shoot. There's
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:27.740]  this new thing where women are in movies. Leanne is not saying this. Women are in movies
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:32.060]  and they say kissing scenes are now assault. But you sign on, you do a kissing scene, you
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:37.940]  do whatever. This is a caveman running off with the women. You know, fine, fine. And
[01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:44.020]  this is the, this is the recruiting. This is grooming for gayness. This is where that
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:48.700]  came from. And that we, Shane didn't look as big under our lights. So we do lighting
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:52.060]  right here. We tried to light things to make his muscles look like they really look, but
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:56.300]  it didn't work. So he didn't look as big as he is, even though he's huge. So let's go
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.900]  ahead and go to that footage.
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:09.900]  Unprecedented. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to see what happens right now.
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:14.180]  Something's wrong. Something's wrong with him helping. Ladies and gentlemen, we did
[01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:19.380]  not endeavor that to happen. I take it personally, do not have those problems. Again, these are
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:25.740]  these are authorized herbs. Well known to be safe. And please, doctor, doctor, wait a minute,
[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:32.740]  ladies and gentlemen, we're just going to cut, cut the commercial was just a moment.
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:39.060]  Get your money out of here.
[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:49.100]  That is grooming for gayness. I mean, unbelievable that this is unbelievable. This info and
[01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:57.540]  I can't believe the Clinton connected lawyer would do this. It's crazy.
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:01.300]  It's a no brainer. A big Berkey water filter is the one you need. Period. You need a water
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:06.740]  filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides,
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:10.940]  bacteria, viruses and much more. Right. And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:15.220]  Get the original most trusted name in gravity, water filtration, big Berkey. And now GCN

[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:58.380]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, DanPilla.com.
[01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:00.780]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:04.940]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week. Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and
[01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:10.020]  being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:16.660]  to do that in our local areas as well. And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to
[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:21.780]  say thanks for the awesome brain force, Anthroplex. My girlfriend would like to say thanks for
[01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:23.660]  the Anthroplex too. Thank you.
[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:27.820]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal
[01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:32.580]  toothpaste fans. The Super Blue is awesome. And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars
[01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:37.620]  Life products. They are quality. I can't wait to get some more. And thank you so much for
[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:43.540]  doing that for us to keep us healthy. Absolutely. Because then we could all, as educated patriots,
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:48.460]  help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on and
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:52.900]  if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:58.260]  country back.
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:02.500]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from InfoWarsLife.com. But
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:05.500]  instead of going with those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:10.180]  personally. From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:14.660]  the essence. We know chicken noodle soup. It's great for people that are sick. Again,
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:21.140]  in every culture, this has been reported because it works. And there's no way to quantify
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:26.260]  how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount
[01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:33.020]  of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible. Ladies and gentlemen, whether
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:37.220]  it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:42.900]  your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most
[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:48.900]  concentrated bone broth formula out there. And it's amazing. Find out for yourself today
[01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:52.980]  at InfoWarsStore.com, what it could do for your family. And again, I want to thank you
[01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:58.220]  all for your support. You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:03.220]  InfoWarsLive is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. We have found an extraordinary,
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:07.820]  new, natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:13.100]  nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:18.180]  This is pollen blood. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:23.540]  quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny
[01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:29.500]  nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production. And again, studying the effects
[01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:34.380]  in published trials, in their published trials, now we are introducing the fruit of the research,
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:40.300]  a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress, and
[01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:45.460]  fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:50.620]  distress. Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block available now
[01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:57.620]  at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll-free, triple-A-253-3139.
[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:27.620]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:34.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, our next guest is on record last year on our broadcast predicting
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:03.740]  that white farmers would have all their land taken in South Africa that similarly has been
[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:11.460]  done in many other areas of Africa, and that now they're going beyond replacing apartheid
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:16.140]  with an apartheid state where whites are treated unfairly, but where whites are actually killed.
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:20.100]  And the new president's saying, we're not going to kill all the whites yet. He just
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:26.380]  made that statement yesterday. In other statements, the new president, communist president, talks
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:34.100]  about how they are going to take their land. And so last year, our guest warned that soon
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:38.460]  that the old president would be taken out of power for corruption, and the new president
[01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:45.940]  would indeed do this. So we're going to be going to Simon Roche here in just a moment
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:52.940]  and breaking that down. But first, we told you that they were falsely claiming that we
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:57.580]  were bullying children and engaging all these activities on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter,
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:35:01.580]  you name it, where we were being restricted and banned. CNN was running operations to
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:06.420]  have us banned. Bloomberg is now reporting that YouTube said that the strikes were false
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:12.580]  and have been removed. Also, the Verge is reporting that the strikes were removed, that
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:21.660]  they were fraudulent. Mistakenly, shut down. So we're going to be going over all of that
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:26.540]  today. It's hard to look at the Daily Mail the same now, though, because they do a lot
[01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:31.860]  of good stuff. That's why I was shocked when they went with that fake EEOC complaint that
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:38.020]  already went over earlier. But let me just finish up with that. My lawyers have looked
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:42.700]  at this and said the complaint is so contradictory and poorly written that it must be a publicity
[01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:52.700]  stunt. But I don't think, I don't think Ashley and Rob know that. And again, she claims I
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:57.940]  hugged her and the media says it's sexual assault. And quite frankly, she was very touchy-feely
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:05.380]  as everybody is going to testify this is true and I am not. So it's just unbelievable. Like
[01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:11.180]  saying you hug somebody is now sexual assault. According to Newsweek and the rest of it,
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:15.500]  they're coming after us. It's like they're coming after Trump. And Trump is now backpedaling
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:24.500]  on the Second Amendment. It is amazing. Meanwhile, you know, you know, I'm not even going to
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:29.140]  play the race card in my defense. It's just none of what's true anyways. I'm just not
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:33.340]  going to go there, but it's a tactic. I'm not going to go there, but he always goes there.
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:36.340]  I'm the same way because I can't help it. I think about it. It's like when I say I'm
[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:40.500]  anti-communist Chinese, I say I'm anti-Asian. My sister's Korean adopted. I love her. She's
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:43.820]  my blood. She's my family. She works here, by the way. She's a great photographer and
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:52.020]  great videographer and great researcher. She's Korean. She's my sister. And, you know,
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:37:01.220]  my ex-wife's family were not practicing Jews, but they were liberals. And I just liked my
[01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:07.780]  ex-wife. And I didn't even really think about the fact that she was Jewish. That's how blind
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:12.300]  I am to that type of stuff. And then what it means for my children and everything else
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:17.580]  and all the white supremacists hating me and everything else. And that just shows how sick
[01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:24.900]  this is that now the media says I'm an anti-Semite. That's why I'm pro-Israel. That's why I've
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:31.100]  been defending Netanyahu is because I'm an anti-Semite. I mean, it's the left and the
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:37.740]  self-loathing Jews that use all this anti-Semitism crud everywhere. And it's crazy. And I'm
[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:41.660]  not saying Netanyahu is perfect either. Neither is Trump. But he's nationalistic. The globalists
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:48.340]  are trying to bring him down. And so it's just mind-blowing to watch this happen. And
[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:53.740]  look, my ex-wife's mother was Jewish. Her dad wasn't. But it doesn't matter. That makes
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:57.980]  her Jewish. And you can then argue since she's a mother that I guess Israel would accept
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:01.340]  my kids. But they're just red-blooded Christian Americans. But I'm not ashamed of their Jewish
[01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:04.620]  heritage. But I'll tell you this. It takes a lot of baggage with it. I've gotten a lot
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:10.340]  of hate for it. And then to get hate from leftist groups that know the truth is just
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:16.100]  the Nazis are bad and the leftist groups are just as bad. They're all bad. Soros is a Nazi
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:19.660]  collaborator that helped round up thousands of his fellow Jews. And then he has groups
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:24.380]  saying, I'm a Nazi collaborator when he's a Nazi. I mean, it just shows how reprobate
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:33.500]  and bankrupt the leftist are. And she's my ex-wife now. And you know, it's my new wife's
[01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:40.060]  and her pedigree is German, three quarters German from Omaha and a quarter Irish. And
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:46.420]  I'm proud of that background. And the anti-Semites call her a call her Jewish and everything else.
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:52.140]  And if she was, I'd be proud of it. But no, she's got a noble nose, but she's not Jewish.
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:59.420]  So you know, that's what all this comes down to, ladies and gentlemen. And it just is insane.
[01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:06.620]  It's absolutely insane. And I'm just trying to have free market and restore the country.
[01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:10.580]  And they're using race politics and race war politics and everywhere the left's in control.
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:15.260]  By the time they get into the final equations, they always kill anybody that's free market,
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:19.060]  kill anybody that's Christian and kill anybody that's white. And it's happened in five different
[01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:22.700]  African nations last 30 years. And now as it was predicted, tapping in South Africa,
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:26.100]  we look at the data when our guest was last on, we come back, I'm going to go to him for
[01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:30.860]  several segments, but I need to just say this right now. And then briefly, they just corrected
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:34.460]  me. I'm so used to going on at 11 a.m. We do 24 hour broadcast for longer ones. And
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:40.420]  then David Knight's on for six months with a great job. With his broadcast 8 a.m. every
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:44.300]  morning with David night show. That's a trademark issues. We're going to call it David night
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:48.220]  show starting soon or something else. What's calling it real news. The point is, is that
[01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:51.980]  some Democrat groups trademark that and suing us. That's another little side issue that
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:57.260]  I'm going to tell you about. It's all yeah. And in three of the suits, it's Clinton lawyers
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:40:02.380]  and they admit they are. And then I got little messages like, you know, back off, buddy.
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:06.700]  It's going to get a lot worse. I wanted to say this. I want to say this effect. Take
[01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:11.940]  this club and put it on the front of segment two and three, because I want this upfront.
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:17.700]  I'm not changing course. I'm not backing down. I'm not giving in. There's nowhere I want
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:21.860]  to be more than right here. And this fight for America and for justice and for truth.
[01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:26.900]  You guys want to be the lie. You want to be involved in deception. All you Clinton operatives
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:32.340]  and you know, lawyers and people want to sit here and play these games. I know our listeners
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:35.660]  want justice. They want the country back. They want the world back. And I believe in
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:38.980]  our listeners and I believe they're going to financially buy our products and spread
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:44.220]  our articles and videos and know that you're trying to shut us down as CNN and others have
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:47.380]  openly said they're trying to do and that the Streisand effect is going to blow up in
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:52.340]  your face. And I know there's Providence and I trust in God. Whatever happens is in God's
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:59.940]  plan, but I actually feel good doing this because it confirms how bad you guys are and
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:05.660]  how deceptive you are and how just absolutely willing to do anything you are and how much
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:11.220]  we've got to fight you. So I thank God and I ask for Providence and I thank God for this
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:14.380]  great crew and the rest of the people here that have stood strong. Everybody in this
[01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:18.300]  office got calls from BuzzFeed and all these groups and none of them would make anything
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:23.900]  up even though Mike Adams was offered $50,000 last year who contributes here and has a big
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:28.460]  office in Austin, $50,000. I think he's ready to go public with who did it by the way, which
[01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:33.140]  publication we're going to, we're going to take the gloves off. Okay. And we're doing
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:38.060]  some investigations and all the rest of it, but if people want the gloves off, baby, you
[01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:44.580]  got it. And how strong our punches are politically is up to you. So infowarstore.com 30 to 80%
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:49.620]  off. We've never had a sale this big 50% off the new best source fiber we've got from all

[01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:27.260]  there on the front. We're going to do that. You can find the donate page, but where is
[01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:30.300]  the link? I'm trying to find it. We're going to email it out to everybody that signed up
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:35.100]  for the newsletter that's free at infowars.com forward slash newsletter. No, no, I know that's
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:41.140]  the donate button. I'm saying where on infowarstore.com is the link because we need to make it easy
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:48.180]  to find on the front page. That's what I'm saying. I wanted to pop up for that for everybody.
[01:42:48.180 --> 01:42:52.620]  That's what I'm getting at. We'll be right back. Thank you for your support. You'll decide
[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:58.300]  whether we survive and defeat the globalists or are destroyed.
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:03.420]  Floor life. The new probiotic line developed exclusively by infowarslife. After years of
[01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:08.820]  research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same. Floor life probiotics
[01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:13.580]  use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly
[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:18.900]  into the intestines for maximum effect. This is critical because stomach acid kills most
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:23.340]  probiotics. So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:28.380]  gut health and your wallet. Floor life supports your body's core, where you need it most,
[01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:32.700]  including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining and metabolism. Did you know
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:38.300]  that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut? That's why increasing gut probiotic
[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:43.260]  levels is so important for overall health. Floor life is sold as a 15 billion probiotic
[01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:48.300]  for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:53.300]  program. Head to infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floor Life probiotics today.
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:54.300]  That's infowarslife.com.
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:44:04.180]  I'm so excited. The new product at infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled
[01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:10.620]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill. This is a heart and brain
[01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:16.460]  pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's
[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:22.780]  beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:28.340]  their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:33.500]  the formulae. And I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:40.740]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone
[01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:46.140]  to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:53.940]  hormones in your glands. It is amazing. Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com and
[01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:59.020]  your purchase fuzz the operation.
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:06.060]  Nourish a probiotic friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by infowarslife.

[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:30.300]  helps you digest food, absorb nutrients and even support your immune system.

[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:47.500]  the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria
[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:59.420]  throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect. Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.

[01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:54.380]  So, here's Julius Malema, about seven months after our guest joined us to warn of this.
[01:47:54.380 --> 01:47:57.860]  He said he would do just this and we're about to go to our guest. This is what he's now
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:03.460]  saying about taking the white people's farmland, which by the way is the most productive and
[01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:07.220]  employs the most people. And when they took it in five other African nations and they
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:11.580]  totally collapsed into cannibalism, which is like Venezuela, you can't call people
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:16.900]  dying from starvation saying they died from starvation. Here it is.
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:24.740]  The expropriation of land without compensation is envisaged as one of the measures that we
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:31.860]  will use to accelerate redistribution of land to black South Africans. We will need to determine
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:42.300]  collectively how we can implement this measure in a way that promotes agricultural production,
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:47.900]  improves food security, advance rural development, reduce poverty.
[01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:51.500]  Let's stop right there before I throw up. We have another clip where they talk about
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:56.020]  we're not going to kill all the whites yet. Everywhere else this happens. I mean, I just
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:49:00.500]  don't know why they don't just get secret technology from Wakanda. But what's happening
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:06.020]  is they want to kick Wakanda technology out. They want to kick the Dutch and British Africaners
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:09.740]  out of the country. And you know, the problem is the West didn't let those poor folks get
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:15.780]  out. So increasingly they're just being murdered and joining us is Simon Roche. Thank you for
[01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:27.740]  coming on. Again, the websites are suidlanders. Free S-T-A-R-T-R. Tell folks how you best
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:31.740]  pronounce those. You've got all the videos, all the articles, the videos of white farmers
[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:35.900]  being murdered, the media celebrating it. They celebrate cops being killed here. This
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:39.380]  is what the Marxist do everywhere. Give us a report since you joined us last year and
[01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:44.060]  what you predicted has now come true. He's now president and he's now calling for your
[01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:47.420]  land to be taken and we'll play the clip coming up. Sister, no, he's not going to kill you
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:51.220]  quite yet though. So he's being liberal. You should thank him.
[01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:57.860]  Yes. Well, Cyril Ramaphosa, the guy that you just featured in your clip is the new president
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:50:05.380]  of the Republic of South Africa. And shortly after gaining the presidency, he made it very
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:12.180]  clear that land expropriation without compensation, and this is vital for people to know, but not
[01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:21.860]  only land as in farmland, but white owned property will now be subject to expropriation.
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:29.860]  And two days ago, the parliament accepted a motion to initiate a process to change the
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:37.380]  constitution of the country so that this can go ahead. The motion proceeded with 241 votes
[01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:43.620]  to 83. So there was overwhelming support for it and clearly we are now entering that phase
[01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:49.340]  where white owned property as it has been defined, not merely land, especially land,
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:55.340]  but not merely land, white owned property will now be confiscated or expropriated without
[01:50:55.340 --> 01:51:02.060]  compensation. And by the way, you corrected it when I had you on. The president called
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:08.180]  for the compensation without any compensation of white farmer land that produces, I know,
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:12.540]  the majority of the food. We'll talk about those numbers in a moment. He's saying take
[01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:17.500]  the land of compensation. It's Julius Malema, the communist leader, who says we're not going
[01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:21.100]  to kill you quite yet. So you've got the good cop just says we're going to take your land.
[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:25.220]  The bad cop says we're going to kill you. Let's go ahead and play Julius Malema. Here
[01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:26.220]  it is.
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:37.300]  We, the rightful owners, our peace was disturbed by white men's arrival here. They committed
[01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:46.380]  a black genocide. They killed our people during land dispossession. Today, we're told don't
[01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:53.380]  disturb them. Even when they disturbed our peace, they found peaceful Africans here.
[01:51:53.380 --> 01:52:01.260]  They killed them. They slaughtered them like animals. We are not calling for the slaughtering
[01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:09.780]  of white people, at least for now. What we are calling for is for peaceful occupation
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:14.220]  of the land. And we don't owe anyone apology.
[01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:17.940]  Yeah, first we take your land, then we kick you off the internet like Hitler did the Jews,
[01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:22.820]  then we kill you. And I forget the numbers, but guys, can you look it up in the World
[01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:29.620]  Almanac online? I want to say Africa's population is 50 times what it was when colonization
[01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:35.780]  started 400, 500 years ago. I mean, the West has brought nothing but overall good, just
[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:39.780]  like America's. When you got here, the natives would kill you if you didn't help fight the
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:43.820]  other natives. They were always killing each other, just like Europeans before the Renaissance
[01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:48.980]  were killing each other. This idea that everybody's so loving in Africa. The Africans were saying,
[01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:52.700]  you buy slaves or we're going to kill you. That was the main business, was black selling
[01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:55.540]  blacks. And then the Arabs came in and did it. The blacks were all for it, because that
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:53:01.420]  was their main business. So let's, yeah, we'll also roll some of the footage of what's going
[01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:05.140]  on, the attacks on whites, the burning of buildings, the burning of infrastructure.
[01:53:05.140 --> 01:53:08.780]  Because it's this thing that the leftists do here and happens in Africa as well, just
[01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:15.260]  burn the infrastructure down and knock your electricity out. Why do folks do this and
[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:22.100]  why is it escalating? It's escalating because the government has failed to deliver on anything
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:26.820]  that it's promised over recent years. The government has been in power now for almost
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:33.100]  24 years. That is to say the African national Congress party of Nelson Mandela fame in 24
[01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:39.180]  years. The life expectancy has declined by at least 4.3 years, which is almost impossible
[01:53:39.180 --> 01:53:44.540]  to do, but it has been done. And indeed, if you follow the statistics of the, the United
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:54.540]  States Census Bureau, released in late 2016, then the decline in age, a life expectancy
[01:53:54.540 --> 01:54:01.020]  is far greater. It's approaching 10 years. The unemployment rate, the official rate
[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:09.700]  is 38.1%. The unofficial rate is obviously far higher and more realistic. At the recent
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:16.060]  United Nations AIDS conference held in South Africa, global AIDS conference, it was revealed
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:24.740]  that 19%, so one in five practically, of all AIDS cases in the world is in South Africa.
[01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:30.300]  It's a shambles. It's an absolute shambles. I live in a little, very small village on
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:35.700]  the banks of the famous Orange River named for Prince William of Orange, the Protestant
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:44.140]  chap who stood against Spain. And we have recently discovered that our African national Congress
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:50.980]  municipality has lost 7 million ransom worth of money that was paid for electricity.
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:54.220]  And let me stop you right there. Let me stop you right there. Rhodesia, then Zimbabwe,
[01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:58.780]  all these other places, the Congo, first thing nationalized, then they make the whites keep
[01:54:58.780 --> 01:55:01.500]  working on the land, then they kill them, then everything collapses, then they have
[01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:09.180]  multi-billion famous inflation. Why is Africa so corrupt once the evil colonists are kicked
[01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:16.220]  out, then you should have Wakanda if it should be like spaceships and the vibranium and everything,
[01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:20.300]  which would be great. I love Africa. It's a beautiful country, a continent, a lot of
[01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:24.660]  beautiful countries. I want them to do well, fellow humans, but this thing about get the
[01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:29.340]  whites out that brought the civilization, why does it then recede back into total barbarism
[01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:36.020]  that everybody's starving, but the president's son has 100 Lamborghinis.
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:40.620]  Let me put it to you this way. Shortly after that chap, Cyril Ramaphosa, our new national
[01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:46.740]  president, was elected the president of his party prior to becoming the national president.
[01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:53.860]  He and a group of senior people went to Nelson Mandela's grandson, who was a traditional leader
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:56:01.740]  as a chief. They sought permission to go to Nelson Mandela's grave to shake his bones.
[01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:09.900]  That is to say, to invoke the ancestral spirit of Nelson Mandela to reinvigorate the African
[01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:17.100]  National Congress Party. That is indicative of the gulf between one culture and another.
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:22.100]  They're so far apart that they're irreconcilable. It's just as simple as that, Alex.
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:28.300]  But why not evacuate? I mean, because they're going to get killed. I mean, why not just
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:29.300]  evacuate?
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:36.380]  No, no, no. Our forefathers built this land with faith in God, blood, sweat, and tears,
[01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:41.780]  Alex, and they built something beautiful. We will not go. We will not capitulate to
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:47.380]  the face of barbarism. It's an unacceptable proposition. We will stand down and we'll fight
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:48.380]  to the death.
[01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:49.860]  We don't want everybody to die. We don't want everybody to die, but they're going to die.
[01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:53.940]  They're going to kill you and then kill themselves. You can't help them. You're standing in the
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:54.940]  way of Wakanda.
[01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:59.820]  Alex, we are going to stand if we are the last Christian nation in the history of the world
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:03.940]  that stands for Almighty God. We will stand and fight and die here. Watch us.
[01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:06.940]  No, I actually respect that and understand it. I know what you guys have been through.
[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:10.380]  It's been hellish. I'm even really good to the locals, built everybody up, the population
[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:13.460]  exploded. And there's a lot of black folks that actually don't want to see everybody
[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:16.980]  go, but, you know, they get killed and hacked up, don't they? I read about it all the time,
[01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:20.140]  but the blacks that want to work with everybody, they get killed, don't they?
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:27.300]  Yeah, it's a very, very big problem. That fact is referred usually to as intimidation.
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:31.060]  So in other words, anybody who doesn't toe the party line gets chopped to pieces. They're
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:32.780]  tens of thousands of examples.
[01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:38.020]  I didn't win. I used to hang the gasoline tires on a little kid's head. Their favorite thing,
[01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:42.420]  she said, was here, little kid's heads pop. And they like to do that. The necklace thing
[01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:49.420]  is what it's called. It's very liberal. We'll be right back.
[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:19.420]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:49.420]  Oral health routine at infowarstore.com. That's infowarstore.com.
[01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:19.420]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:42.420 --> 02:00:09.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the information war. It's
[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:16.980]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.980 --> 02:00:23.980]  Simon Roche is a leader of a Christian organization. And I've studied the factions and things.
[02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:27.520]  It's very fascinating. I read quite a few books on it in South Africa and how the country
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:32.300]  got set up and different factions that were involved, the Zulus and then the ANC and then
[02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:36.020]  the African Connors, the Dutch that were Protestants. And then the British came in and the Boer
[02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:40.180]  War and Winston Churchill and I probably only read eight, nine books on it. It sounds like
[02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:44.620]  I'm bragging. It's actually not a lot. It's very interesting. And so why don't you just
[02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:49.740]  quantify who you guys are, the biggest group still of farmers going back to Dutch background
[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:55.620]  and others, holding on, feeding a large portion of the country, kind of like Amish do in several
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:01:00.660]  South American countries where they produce over 80%. You're kind of Amish-like folks
[02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:04.180]  that went to South Africa and now they're announcing they're going to kill you. They
[02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:08.420]  are killing you. The second largest party says they're going to start killing you. The
[02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:12.860]  president says, no, we're just going to take their land and just throw you out into the
[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:18.380]  bushes. And you got really mad earlier. And I wasn't trying to get you riled up. I was
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:22.420]  just saying, why not evacuate it? And you got pretty animated there. So tell us who
[02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:27.860]  you are for people out there watching. Quantify that. This is where Simon will come back to
[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:31.020]  the next. And then talk about why you're so, so, so dedicated.
[02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:38.500]  Well, our organization is called Southlanders, which means Southlanders. We are the largest
[02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:43.420]  non-state-owned civil defense organization in the world, and we're constituted under
[02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:49.060]  international law, particularly protocols one and two additional to the Geneva Conventions,
[02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:55.300]  which makes specific provision for identifiable ethnic groups to group together in conditions
[02:01:55.300 --> 02:01:59.500]  of conflict where they are threatened. And we are preparing for a civil war, the civil
[02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:06.020]  war that is now being promised to us by our former president, by Julius Malema, by the
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:10.660]  head of the constitutional court of South Africa. The list just goes on and on and not
[02:02:10.660 --> 02:02:16.260]  least our minister of defense who recently promised a genocide. This was broadcast.
[02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:20.820]  That's right. The communists run the defense department in South Africa now.
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:26.180]  Yeah, absolutely. Bear in mind that the African National Congress political party is actually
[02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:32.540]  only one-third of a greater organization. One-third of it is the political party. One-third
[02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:37.700]  of it is a trade union organization. And one-third of it is the South African Communist Party.
[02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:41.260]  Indeed, Nelson Mandela remains. Well, they've always been the heart of it for those that
[02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:45.220]  don't know, but they've been expanding on this. The left always does this everywhere.
[02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:49.780]  They say whether it's just an issue between a communist and capitalist or whether it's
[02:02:49.780 --> 02:02:54.580]  black or white, they say be liberal, let us take over, we'll be sweet. Then they always
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:59.420]  enslave and kill. Venezuela, it's not even cultural. It's political. They were as rich
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:04.460]  as the U.S. or richer, just like Argentina. Now they're eating out of trash everywhere.
[02:03:04.460 --> 02:03:08.540]  Total collapse. Thousands are dying a week from starvation, but the government passed
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:14.300]  a law where you can't call it starvation. I mean, this is what communists do.
[02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:18.300]  This is what they do, Alex. They always do it, and there's never an exception. And you
[02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:22.780]  can see it, and I say this in humility and respect. You can see it in certain United
[02:03:22.780 --> 02:03:28.100]  States cities that I visited for six months last year. The trend is so clear and so consistent
[02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:32.380]  and so reliable and so dependable. There's just no argument to be held about this. Our
[02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:39.380]  goal is to safeguard the welfare of non-competent civilians in a crisis, which we are preparing
[02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:43.180]  for right now, in which we've recently been promised repeatedly, as I say.
[02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:47.420]  I'm going to go to break, but give us a timeline. Ten years ago, people didn't listen to you.
[02:03:47.420 --> 02:03:49.980]  Now, everybody's listening because it's happening.
[02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:55.140]  Yeah, that's right. People are listening, and we are trying desperately last minute
[02:03:55.140 --> 02:04:00.060]  to try and prepare for it, and that's why we are begging the world to support us. We
[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:06.020]  just started a free starter campaign in the USA with Charles C. Johnson and the support
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:11.580]  of some American senators, and we are imploring people, please help us. We desperately need
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:15.660]  help. There is big trouble coming here.
[02:04:15.660 --> 02:04:21.340]  And we've got George Soros and the WikiLeaks wants to overthrow Israel. I mean, every
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:27.300]  western little enclave is about to be annihilated. Why do you think that is?
[02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:31.780]  It's a thing that goes back thousands and thousands and thousands of years, Alex. This
[02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:37.820]  fight between good and evil is unrelenting. It's nothing special. It's nothing original.
[02:04:37.820 --> 02:04:43.460]  I see that you've just brought up the campaign. It kicked off about half an hour ago, and
[02:04:43.460 --> 02:04:46.820]  yeah, there you've got it there. And we just have to keep up the fight.
[02:04:46.820 --> 02:04:49.740]  We're going to talk about it when we come back. By the way, we're in the same position,
[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:53.180]  so we need support as well, but who will support you like last time? Because they're
[02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:56.780]  trying to shut us down ahead of persecution.
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:05:01.420]  Fuel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life. Digestive
[02:05:01.420 --> 02:05:05.860]  enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients
[02:05:05.860 --> 02:05:10.460]  by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components. They also help prevent discomfort
[02:05:10.460 --> 02:05:14.820]  from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut. Digestive
[02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:18.940]  enzyme production declines as we age. Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those
[02:05:18.940 --> 02:05:24.380]  naturally present in the body. Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again. You
[02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:29.460]  can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly
[02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:34.180]  associated with high meat diets. Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase
[02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:39.940]  the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:05:39.940 --> 02:05:44.380]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you
[02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:49.740]  can fully digest all types of meals. Don't let a meal go to waste. Use carnivore by InfoWars

[02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:33.580]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:41.860]  Climbing Roche runs the biggest civil defense group in the world, basically. Dutch, quasi-Amish,
[02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:46.500]  and a lot of them have been overrun, a lot of them have been killed, just like in five
[02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:51.060]  other African nations in Bobway, the most famous. There were something like a million
[02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:54.480]  white farmers there, then it fell down to less than 20,000. They were still producing
[02:06:54.480 --> 02:07:00.100]  almost all the country's food. Now they're all gone. Just a few years ago, the government
[02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:06.180]  raided the houses and mainly killed a few thousand elderly that just couldn't leave.
[02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:10.020]  They already given the farms over, the tractors, everything. They usually would move them
[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:14.860]  into like a shed and they just came in and blew their heads off. The national TV celebrated
[02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:20.020]  it because it's liberal. White people must be racist and bad and now the country has
[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:26.260]  completely collapsed into total hell on earth. I just don't think the average leftist realizes
[02:07:26.260 --> 02:07:31.380]  that this whole communist programming and trying to make blacks racist and turning everybody
[02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:37.020]  against each other here in America is a communist tactic and that Mandela was a communist. His
[02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:45.020]  wife famously would line up children and put tires over their heads, put gasoline in and
[02:07:45.020 --> 02:07:51.940]  burn them up and sit there and go while they did it. This is who we're told to worship.
[02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:57.300]  You'll get rid of one thing apartheid that I think was bad, but you understand it's
[02:07:57.300 --> 02:08:01.540]  a total barbarous state with different groups and the British came in and took control of
[02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:05.020]  it and then exploited it. I'm not bashing Brits. I'm Welsh. The point is the British
[02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:08.660]  empire and then you think about reconners and other groups that were already there in
[02:08:08.660 --> 02:08:12.580]  many cases living in peace with the natives who wanted them to come in and create agriculture
[02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:17.860]  and jobs and then now you've got black racist nationalist communist saying kill the whites.
[02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:23.940]  We just played that last hour. This is a nightmare situation. So you should support them. Their
[02:08:23.940 --> 02:08:28.380]  plight is very, very serious and it's something that our media won't even cover. Remember
[02:08:28.380 --> 02:08:33.540]  all the free South Africa stuff? Well, I was for that, but I knew that it didn't need to
[02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:36.820]  be replaced with communism. It didn't need to be replaced with a more equitable, you
[02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:41.780]  know, free market system. That hasn't been done. The multinationals are being more exploited
[02:08:41.780 --> 02:08:46.540]  than ever. They just get private mercenaries to guard the very mines instead of actually
[02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:51.140]  investing in the country. I've seen numbers that investment from the mines and investment
[02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:57.460]  from the big industrial agriculture is plummeted under black rule. I'm going to say that again.
[02:08:57.460 --> 02:09:03.060]  The black leaders are keeping the money for themselves, not like the white leaders who
[02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:07.460]  were sharing power. We're putting it back in because they live there. Stabilize things.
[02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:13.060]  Let's have a nice life. No. So again, they're replacing one bad thing with something 50
[02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:17.340]  times worse. We'll talk to him in a moment, but listen, folks, a lot of people have called
[02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:24.140]  me friends, family neighbors and they've said, how are you taking thousands of articles
[02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:30.540]  saying that I it's all over TV saying Alex Jones sexually assaulted male and female
[02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:37.060]  employees. And then you actually read the EEOC complaint and it says one time Jones
[02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:41.340]  hugged me and might have touched me a little bit on my butt. Not even true. And that sexual
[02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:48.020]  assault. I mean, it's not true. And then we're doing a bodybuilding shoot for a supplement
[02:09:48.020 --> 02:09:53.020]  ad and I'm in a major editing suite with four different computers. I'm like, he doesn't
[02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:55.700]  look right because later in the thing, you know, he rips his shirt off like Hulk Hogan
[02:09:55.700 --> 02:09:59.900]  at St. Steiner and kind of fast forward because it comes back with him with his shirt off
[02:09:59.900 --> 02:10:04.460]  in the end with with the girls. And this is this is homoerotic. They're claiming and
[02:10:04.460 --> 02:10:08.380]  we were Googling how to light a bodybuilder. He was saying, man, it doesn't show my ripped
[02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:12.700]  chest to that shot right there. And I guess, you know, the light wasn't right, but we just
[02:10:12.700 --> 02:10:19.100]  couldn't figure it out that it says it. He came in, he saw it. He ran over to HR. They
[02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:23.340]  come and they go, Rob, it says how to light bodybuilding and it's bodybuilders. We have
[02:10:23.340 --> 02:10:28.980]  that written up in HR. This is now national news that I was grooming him. He says, I
[02:10:28.980 --> 02:10:32.900]  mean, he says, Jones never asked me to go out with him. Jones never asked me for sex.
[02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:36.660]  Jones never nothing. This is a guy I've had over for Thanksgiving three or four times
[02:10:36.660 --> 02:10:40.460]  because he was a loner and I've got to feel sorry for him. And he was kind of a smart
[02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:45.860]  writer in ways, but he was always too frustrated. And so Rob's a smart guy, but he just went
[02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:51.420]  downhill and I really feel sorry for him. I mean, when you read the complaint, it says
[02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:57.620]  we wear Nazi shoes. It's what what is that somebody mailed in things of Hillary with
[02:10:57.620 --> 02:11:02.500]  the Nazi symbol on her, some Japanese lady that sewed the shoes for us. I'm trying to
[02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:06.500]  find them. So much stuff comes in the mail room, but that matter. The media takes the
[02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:13.220]  EOC complaint that's twisted and weird and deceptive and it takes it and then ups its
[02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:18.180]  game like the Prairie Home Companion guy. The woman hugged him. Her shirt went up and
[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:25.140]  she said she touched her skin and they fired him. They're just setting a precedent. Meanwhile,
[02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:28.340]  we got all the pedophilia in Hollywood and the rest of it. So financially support us.
[02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:33.220]  We have to have a legal defense fund. This is the best defense is a good offense. I've
[02:11:33.220 --> 02:11:37.620]  already launched stuff major this morning. If we have to do this and don't up the amount
[02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:41.620]  of money coming in, it will cut into production. It'll cut into operations. It'll cut into
[02:11:41.620 --> 02:11:45.660]  our reach and exposing news that they don't want exposed. We can't let them get us in
[02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:50.140]  a shrinking mode. Last year, they banned us off Google advertising. That cost us 5 million.
[02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:55.900]  You came through. You bought. It was just the same time. February, March last year.
[02:11:55.900 --> 02:12:01.740]  You came back and within three months of extra orders and donations, we raised the 5 million
[02:12:01.740 --> 02:12:07.260]  dollars it takes to run this. I'm going up on extra satellites. Affiliates are picking
[02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:11.940]  us up like crazy. The globalists know this. They're scared. This show is exploding, but
[02:12:11.940 --> 02:12:18.060]  it's exploding. The people we reach not in money. Okay. So people on TV, UHF, VHF cable
[02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:21.740]  watching us. They're not really buying stuff. It's talk radio. It's the Christian audience.
[02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:27.940]  It's patriots. It's that dedicated small percentage. I need you. You've done so much to stand
[02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:31.460]  in the way of these. I'm ready to take the next stuff they make up. I'm ready to, if
[02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:35.020]  they kill me, I'm ready. I'm not saying Rob and his lawyers. I'm saying, you know, Hillary
[02:12:35.020 --> 02:12:39.620]  and the globalists because I mean, this is serious. I'm ready and it's not because I'm
[02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:43.300]  a hero. I know I can't give in to them. I know I can't back down. I understand why he
[02:12:43.300 --> 02:12:46.820]  doesn't want to try to evacuate. I was just asking the, you know, devil's advocate question
[02:12:46.820 --> 02:12:49.740]  out of South Africa, even though the president's announcing, we're going to take your land
[02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:54.860]  and the defense minister says we're going to kill you. Okay. Once we put you in, in,
[02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:59.500]  in camps, that's actually the, the, the, the, the communist plan. They always want to put
[02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:07.460]  their opposition in camps. So info or store.com 30 to 80% off. But a lot of these 80% off,
[02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:11.380]  those are clearance items, t-shirts that are great, but some reason nope, never sold or
[02:13:11.380 --> 02:13:15.820]  a lot of other stuff, some brand new best supplements, 50% off, uh, like our new super
[02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:20.540]  fiber, best fiber, a probiotic fiber, it's all there. We need the financing, but when
[02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:24.900]  you go to info wars.com, a pop up pops up, where you go to info wars.com forward slash
[02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:30.780]  show, you'll see a donate button and I need the middle class folks, the wealthy people,
[02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:34.100]  the folks that I've never said, Hey, we need the money. I'm going to call people like Gary
[02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:38.820]  Haven today who's offered me money before and I've said, no, we're doing all right.
[02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:46.220]  I'm selling product. He offered me $50,000 once and I said, no, and then he gave me 20
[02:13:46.220 --> 02:13:50.080]  and then I'm going to call Gary and I'm going to say, Gary, I need the money and Mike Adams
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:54.580]  offered money. People don't know Mike Adams is bigger than we are global. He's huge. He
[02:13:54.580 --> 02:13:59.420]  is bigger when it comes to actual numbers than we are. Mike, Mike's called yesterday
[02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:02.540]  before he was coming on. He said, I want to donate. So I'm going to get on the phones.
[02:14:02.540 --> 02:14:07.220]  I'm going to raise a bunch of money, but I need you to load us up with money right now.
[02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:10.300]  I need you to support local affiliates, send them a hundred bucks a month as well. I need
[02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:14.780]  you to put your calendar to tithe the info wars so we can support pastors and groups
[02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:19.740]  all over the world, people defending freedom, defending freedom of speech and exposing all
[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:25.460]  the evil that's going on, but we're under attack and so far we brought in less money.
[02:14:25.460 --> 02:14:29.620]  We brought in last year at this time, $500,000 less. I met with the accountant yesterday
[02:14:29.620 --> 02:14:34.780]  and I'm looking at a very aggressive program because I've got to, I've got to stop this
[02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:38.460]  now while they're trying to pay people because I talked to Daily Mail. They wouldn't deny
[02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:45.020]  that they were paying. I've got to let folks know that listen, you know, we've got to
[02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:48.820]  have, I'm not going to say what we're going to do. It's all legal and lawful, but it's
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:54.140]  very aggressive. And so they want to fight. They better believe they got one and that
[02:14:54.140 --> 02:15:00.020]  includes everybody involved. That includes everybody. So I need a lot of money. I need
[02:15:00.020 --> 02:15:04.500]  it right now and I commit to you a hundred percent of the money that comes in and donations
[02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:09.260]  and product sales this week will go to, I mean, I already, 95% of the money comes in
[02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:13.380]  here goes to this operation. Then I build up money to fight them and do this and that
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:17.100]  because you know, we got to have some backup money. I don't give a rat's ass about things.
[02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:20.020]  I care about ideas and defeating the globalists. We're going to come back with our guests,
[02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:24.340]  finish up in the final segment, but I'm just telling you, this is a total war. They're
[02:15:24.340 --> 02:15:28.340]  taking off the gloves. You see it. You saw all the attacks this week. They get more of
[02:15:28.340 --> 02:15:32.660]  our sponsors. That's on the news. They tried to ban us off the internet. They're lying about
[02:15:32.660 --> 02:15:37.460]  who we are. They already tried to take my kids away and I'm not complaining. I'm just saying
[02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:42.100]  this is a war. We're up against authoritarians and they're useful idiots and they're minions
[02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:47.460]  and this is Hillary Clinton's former main lawyer. He brags about it. Is the person running
[02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:52.340]  this suit and the whole EEOC thing and they admit the things political. They say we're
[02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:55.860]  full of crap. We need to be exposed. Yeah, right. We'll be back.
[02:15:55.860 --> 02:16:00.780]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon. I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon,

[02:18:56.580 --> 02:19:01.140]  Info War's Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. We have found extraordinary
[02:19:01.140 --> 02:19:06.420]  new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear
[02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:11.660]  nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing. This
[02:19:11.660 --> 02:19:16.780]  is pollen blood. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain
[02:19:16.780 --> 02:19:22.100]  quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny
[02:19:22.100 --> 02:19:28.060]  nose, itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus production. They began studying the effects
[02:19:28.060 --> 02:19:32.420]  in published trials and they're published trials. Now we are introducing the fruit of
[02:19:32.420 --> 02:19:37.980]  the research of fast acting chewable tablets, just two tablets at the first sign of seasonal
[02:19:37.980 --> 02:19:43.460]  distress and fast acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate
[02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:48.460]  seasonal distress. Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast acting pollen block available
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:59.460]  now at infowarslife.com or by calling toll free. Triple A 253 3139.
[02:19:59.460 --> 02:20:24.660]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:24.660 --> 02:20:47.260]  Here's the cut for psychology experiments on why Alex Jones is always taking his shirt
[02:20:47.260 --> 02:20:52.860]  off. Well that violates the Goldwater rule of diagnosing somebody from afar that's a violation
[02:20:52.860 --> 02:20:57.660]  of the code of the American Psychological Association but they don't care. I've taken
[02:20:57.660 --> 02:21:05.660]  my shirt off probably five, six times in 23 years on air and I do it as stunts like Hulk
[02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:11.780]  Hogan. Like where I'm a Hillary supporter that goes crazy and has to be restrained so
[02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:17.540]  I pull my shirt off because it's an anti-Hillary shirt. It's an ad for the shirt. We sold almost
[02:21:17.540 --> 02:21:23.180]  $100,000 of them. It worked. Then I showed how I lost some weight when I was really fat
[02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:29.180]  and then I've had people, listeners take pictures of me like some of those were taken by tabloids
[02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:35.940]  like I'm in Hawaii and they're taking pictures of me or once I went out in the snow and jumped
[02:21:35.940 --> 02:21:42.940]  in water. I mean everybody else does it too. I mean it's just crazy. Everybody else does
[02:21:42.940 --> 02:21:49.900]  it. So if I lose 30 pounds I'm going to show you a picture like everybody else does but
[02:21:49.900 --> 02:21:53.940]  then they go through. It's a show of dominance. It's all this other crap. No it's cold doing
[02:21:53.940 --> 02:21:59.700]  a show and it's cold having some fun. So we've got communists saying murder conservatives,
[02:21:59.700 --> 02:22:04.020]  murder libertarians, murder Trump, murder all the whites of South Africa and their answer
[02:22:04.020 --> 02:22:10.420]  is how bad we are because I take my shirt off. It is simply incredible and they never
[02:22:10.420 --> 02:22:16.140]  let us respond to what they make false charges. All right, Simon Roche of the Southlanders,
[02:22:16.140 --> 02:22:21.180]  civil defense group, he was here with us last year over six months ago and he warned that
[02:22:21.180 --> 02:22:24.540]  the new president was about to get in who said he wanted to take all the land from white
[02:22:24.540 --> 02:22:28.860]  settlers who'd been there 400 years in some cases. He has the emergency plan. The only
[02:22:28.860 --> 02:22:32.580]  one of its kind in the world. Yeah, nobody ever stands up. They just incrementally get
[02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:37.500]  picked off and picked off and picked off. Mainly they got to defend the old folks and
[02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:41.020]  now they have the defense minister who's number two in the government, the communist leader
[02:22:41.020 --> 02:22:44.300]  said we're going to kill the whites. We just played those clips earlier. So please continue
[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:48.740]  sir and tell folks how they can support your organization.
[02:22:48.740 --> 02:22:54.300]  Well we have a good plan. We have good membership and we have lots of experience, training and
[02:22:54.300 --> 02:23:00.980]  skills. Unfortunately in the New South African rainbow nation as the liberals call it, we
[02:23:00.980 --> 02:23:05.740]  are persona non grata. It's very difficult for us to raise money. People have lost their
[02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:11.980]  jobs for less than supporting an organization like us. So we are asking for people to help
[02:23:11.980 --> 02:23:19.820]  us financially so that we can purchase diesel fuel, medicine, food, tents and clothing for
[02:23:19.820 --> 02:23:27.700]  women, children, the elderly and the disabled. We need support from the whole world. I have
[02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:32.940]  just received a message. I'll quote it to you. Julius Malema who you had on earlier
[02:23:32.940 --> 02:23:39.460]  says the following. We want to teach these white people we mean business about property
[02:23:39.460 --> 02:23:45.540]  expropriation without compensation. He then went on to say in front of a very excited
[02:23:45.540 --> 02:23:52.380]  audience, we are going for your white man to cut the throat.
[02:23:52.380 --> 02:23:57.500]  And we just played him saying you know we're not going to kill you quite yet but now he's
[02:23:57.500 --> 02:24:02.660]  saying that in your country the defense minister you pay taxes to says he's coming to racially
[02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:09.140]  murder you. Yes, that's correct. And except things are reaching a crisis now it has been
[02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:14.340]  building up for a long, long time. Very gradually indeed our new president, Cyril Ramaphosa
[02:24:14.340 --> 02:24:19.740]  who you also had on earlier is famous for having said some years ago, we are going to
[02:24:19.740 --> 02:24:27.180]  treat the whites like a frog in hot water. We're going to boil them so slowly they won't
[02:24:27.180 --> 02:24:32.140]  realize until it's too late and then they'll be dead. That's the situation we're in. It
[02:24:32.140 --> 02:24:36.660]  has been building up to this point and now we're about to hit the wall at a hundred miles
[02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:43.020]  an hour. A big crisis is coming here. Well you can see that he's hyping people up he's
[02:24:43.020 --> 02:24:47.180]  getting them ready to obviously invigorate the Communist Party so it completely takes
[02:24:47.180 --> 02:24:53.580]  over and then has a red terror. Well it's exactly as Dr. Gregory Stanton of Genocide
[02:24:53.580 --> 02:24:58.580]  Watch in Washington DC said. He said this is the path that they follow and right towards
[02:24:58.580 --> 02:25:05.220]  the end they use this traumatic rhetoric to get the blood racing and then they launch
[02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:09.540]  their thing. Well let me say this. When somebody says we're coming to kill you because of your
[02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:14.420]  race and they're a defense minister I'm not calling for this but generally if somebody
[02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:18.420]  ends up taking this guy out he asks for it and everybody around him and when they say
[02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:21.940]  we're coming to kill you and your family because you're white I'm the defense minister he has
[02:25:21.940 --> 02:25:28.740]  that power to do it. He needs to be removed right now because this is unbelievable. Oh
[02:25:28.740 --> 02:25:33.940]  Alex it's not unique it's a she as it happens but it's not unique you know in the middle
[02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:37.820]  of last year. I'm confused and Julius Malema leader of the Marxist opposition we played
[02:25:37.820 --> 02:25:41.540]  the club earlier he said we're gonna you know we're not gonna kill you all yet and you were
[02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:47.380]  just quoting I guess one of his adjuncts because his names escape me go back to and just be
[02:25:47.380 --> 02:25:53.860]  clear who said the latest? Ah the the latest is from Julius Malema our bigger partner I
[02:25:53.860 --> 02:25:59.460]  thought you were talking about the defense minister which is a she. Okay so oh so she's
[02:25:59.460 --> 02:26:04.580]  doing it too Julius Malema is the leader of the Marxist. That's right. So you've got
[02:26:04.580 --> 02:26:08.460]  the defense minister you've got okay okay I thought it was just him doing it so you've
[02:26:08.460 --> 02:26:12.620]  got the defense minister you've got you've got the the number two party you've got the
[02:26:12.620 --> 02:26:18.420]  president saying take your land good god. And and boil them alive like frogs and that
[02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:25.020]  it doesn't end there the head of the constitutional court the brother of one of our former presidents
[02:26:25.020 --> 02:26:30.860]  the the head of the African National Congress's private militia of which Nelson Mandela was
[02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:36.180]  head the very famous terrorist organization in Konto where Seasway which means the spear
[02:26:36.180 --> 02:26:43.060]  of the nation in in the middle of last year said it is time now for blacks to to come
[02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:49.140]  to training camps in the bush to learn to fight whites in a civil war. There are many
[02:26:49.140 --> 02:26:55.940]  people who are talking about this Alex. But again it happens in every African country
[02:26:55.940 --> 02:27:00.380]  where the whites are basically pushed into a minority positions in Bobway you name it
[02:27:00.380 --> 02:27:04.220]  why do you think you're going to be different because you're ready for it you've seen history
[02:27:04.220 --> 02:27:12.100]  it's not that it's going to be different we're going to suffer very very badly but we happen
[02:27:12.100 --> 02:27:17.220]  to be a group of people and there are many of us who are willing to stand for what's
[02:27:17.220 --> 02:27:21.980]  right because it's not acceptable and to leave here and to immigrate to America or Australia
[02:27:21.980 --> 02:27:26.460]  or New Zealand is not the solution for our children to be exposed to the same perversity
[02:27:26.460 --> 02:27:31.220]  and pornography and abortion and drugs that is being implemented in all of the European
[02:27:31.220 --> 02:27:35.060]  derived societies around the world Islamists is being brought in sure so I mean to be clear
[02:27:35.060 --> 02:27:40.180]  you're basically living a very very Amish lifestyle very close to that uh Mennonite
[02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:44.900]  just out there producing food for the rest of the country what what what percentage do
[02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:49.220]  the white farmers produce still in South Africa I know previously it was a tiny minority
[02:27:49.220 --> 02:27:57.980]  produced the majority you know there are only about 40,000 white farms of which 21,000 are
[02:27:57.980 --> 02:28:03.020]  now for sale believe it or not I read the figures so there is a massive evaluation now
[02:28:03.020 --> 02:28:09.980]  taking place well people are terrified but we the whites in South Africa produce I'm
[02:28:09.980 --> 02:28:17.100]  I'm estimating but I'll estimate conservatively very very easily 70% of the food consumed in
[02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:20.540]  this country and that's what's crazy in every country they kick you out and then it collapses
[02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:26.460]  why doesn't why don't they have the Wakandan dream why why why doesn't that happen because
[02:28:26.460 --> 02:28:31.220]  the notion of the goose that lays the golden egg is a fallacy in certain cultures we have
[02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:35.580]  a tendency as white people around the world to say we see things this way so they should
[02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:40.500]  too no it's a different culture different values different norms different more race
[02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:46.140]  and there is a notion in Africa that it is better to have 100% of 10 in other words to
[02:28:46.140 --> 02:28:53.940]  control everything than to have 10% of a million in other words to have more but to be sharing
[02:28:53.940 --> 02:28:59.460]  unbelievable one out of four people listening to my voice right now could die from heart
[02:28:59.460 --> 02:29:03.060]  disease this could be your last year and you don't even know it because you don't know
[02:29:03.060 --> 02:29:07.180]  the early warning signs if you think you're safe because your cholesterol levels are normal
[02:29:07.180 --> 02:29:12.020]  think again because studies show that 75% of heart attack patients also had normal cholesterol
[02:29:12.020 --> 02:29:17.020]  levels let me introduce you to Strauss heart drops a world famous heart and brain formula

[02:29:58.020 --> 02:30:04.180]  to Victor in Florida Victor you're calling go ahead yes I Alex first I just want to mention
[02:30:04.180 --> 02:30:10.100]  if people just go and try the products they will be ordering all the time I've ordered

[02:30:15.580 --> 02:30:19.860]  don't know as soon as I start to feel like I get a little stick you know maybe like a

[02:30:32.820 --> 02:30:37.140]  the whole operation because a very small percentage of people buy products and a very small percentage
[02:30:37.140 --> 02:30:41.580]  of them buy a lot of the products so thank you but when you mention the the silver bullet
[02:30:41.580 --> 02:30:47.500]  it's got thousands of reviews a 98% review it is our highest reviewed product because

[02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:14.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. We are on the march the empire is on the run
[02:33:14.420 --> 02:33:24.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. There is a global corporate government that's free
[02:33:24.940 --> 02:33:32.460]  market that pays zero taxes and his ultimate capitalist but in a crony fashion. Obama traveled
[02:33:32.460 --> 02:33:35.740]  to Africa he traveled to South America just two years ago. Remember he gave the speeches
[02:33:35.740 --> 02:33:41.500]  saying now now now now to graduate students. Communism is good for you but then capitalism
[02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:46.620]  is good internationally. Now I don't do a good imitation but you're going to be communist
[02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:50.580]  meaning you're a slave you can't have recognition your cars. They actually said that in Africa
[02:33:50.580 --> 02:33:55.260]  in three different speeches but then we're going to be rich and fly around on jet airplanes
[02:33:55.260 --> 02:34:01.700]  but it's for the environment and then you pay your money to us and then we're exempt.
[02:34:01.700 --> 02:34:06.300]  Amazon's owner is worth a hundred and fifteen billion dollars last time I checked he makes
[02:34:06.300 --> 02:34:13.180]  a billion dollars every three days profit. The company separate from him made 5.6 billion
[02:34:13.180 --> 02:34:21.260]  last year and paid zero tax. Now these virtue signalers pay no tax just like Warren Buffett
[02:34:21.260 --> 02:34:25.180]  basically pays none. Google pays almost none because they set it up but then they tell
[02:34:25.180 --> 02:34:30.620]  you the middle class didn't pay enough and it's the same thing. Then they fund the communists
[02:34:30.620 --> 02:34:34.740]  to take over because it'll be one communist king payment of the military and they just
[02:34:34.740 --> 02:34:39.220]  pay off that person maybe a half a billion dollars every decade. A lot of these African
[02:34:39.220 --> 02:34:45.540]  countries they buy them off a couple hundred million and they can exploit everything. As
[02:34:45.540 --> 02:34:50.460]  long as the leaders get tribal and say kill the white man they can stay in power but what's
[02:34:50.460 --> 02:34:54.420]  happening in a bunch of countries as soon as all the whites are dead it doesn't work
[02:34:54.420 --> 02:34:58.780]  because there's I mean they celebrated in Zimbabwe when the last white farmer two years
[02:34:58.780 --> 02:35:03.620]  ago got killed and now the leaders out finally because they're like there is no more white
[02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:09.680]  man we fight where is it we want all this money everything's bankrupt. That is exactly
[02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:15.940]  what happens but I don't want to see the Africaners leave I don't want to see the Southlanders
[02:35:15.940 --> 02:35:20.340]  leave but most of them have already left you heard that half the farms of 40,000 are up
[02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:25.140]  for sale. I don't blame them but I get also sticking to it because when you've been bullied
[02:35:25.140 --> 02:35:30.220]  so much you have nowhere else to go. They have attacked me and I don't usually do this
[02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:34.500]  on the show but I mean look look look what it's like now it's like they said you know
[02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:38.860]  Rush Limbaugh said that they were trying to promote black quarterbacks over white quarterbacks
[02:35:38.860 --> 02:35:43.260]  but that was true or not they tried to boycott him and remove him ten years ago. Now we've
[02:35:43.260 --> 02:35:49.020]  moved on to Alex hugged me once and his hand went down a little far and then that's not
[02:35:49.020 --> 02:35:55.340]  even true and then the news calls it sex assault and then there's bodybuilding on a computer
[02:35:55.340 --> 02:35:59.940]  because we're trying to light a bodybuilding shoot and that becomes gay porn and that becomes
[02:35:59.940 --> 02:36:11.540]  gay what was it called being groomed. I mean can you imagine can you imagine how ridiculous
[02:36:11.540 --> 02:36:20.260]  but they don't care it's the headlines how ridiculous I look right there. The point is
[02:36:20.260 --> 02:36:25.420]  is that is that this is out of control we're gonna go to our next guest who they're attacking
[02:36:25.420 --> 02:36:28.620]  as well and I just thank the listeners in the audience and I'm that we're in the middle
[02:36:28.620 --> 02:36:35.100]  of a 34 hour broadcast we're now I don't know five hours or so into it as it started when
[02:36:35.100 --> 02:36:38.140]  David Knight kicked off I was saying that wrong like we're in hour number one we're
[02:36:38.140 --> 02:36:40.820]  in hour number no no they're like no Alex add three to it David was on oh yeah that's
[02:36:40.820 --> 02:36:44.780]  right we'll be live right through six o'clock tomorrow we're already live ten hours a day
[02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:48.220]  I promise to expand we got the satellite up links all the TV stations trying to pick us
[02:36:48.220 --> 02:36:53.220]  up I'm ready to announce that too I gotta go to our next guest here the guys that gave
[02:36:53.220 --> 02:37:00.620]  me the new satellites satellite galaxy 16 it's on in fours.com forward slash show galaxy
[02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:11.940]  16 at 99.0 W 24 hours a day in HD and that is galaxy 16 in geosynchronous orbit right
[02:37:11.940 --> 02:37:15.940]  over the equator but straight over the earth so it's like this from the building right
[02:37:15.940 --> 02:37:24.140]  there and that baby's right over and then we've got 14 over here we're at this other
[02:37:24.140 --> 02:37:29.740]  one and that's gonna hit Europe and Africa so we're like over the US and then out over
[02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:35.460]  here into Asia and blasting into Europe and then end up most of Africa and I mean it's
[02:37:35.460 --> 02:37:40.500]  on folks we're in a fight here and like industry people go why do you want to be on in Africa
[02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:44.540]  or why do you want to be on in Asia you don't get any orders from there any sponsorship
[02:37:44.540 --> 02:37:49.420]  our sponsorships freedom there's no real voice of America anymore we've got to do it
[02:37:49.420 --> 02:37:54.020]  people and so that's why we're under attack we're the real voice of America from basic
[02:37:54.020 --> 02:38:01.460]  Americana good values free market we're fighting communism and we're under hellish attack but
[02:38:01.460 --> 02:38:06.300]  again I take that as being over the target both my grandfathers from the Army Air Corps
[02:38:06.300 --> 02:38:11.220]  and World War two both almost died wanted to crash landing and then my other grandfather
[02:38:11.220 --> 02:38:20.260]  was out of North Africa bombing the Germans in Italy and he got a heat stroke and he'd
[02:38:20.260 --> 02:38:25.660]  been over 20 missions already and volunteered for more you know catch 22 and then they put
[02:38:25.660 --> 02:38:31.980]  another pilot and he was a pilot and the plane blew up over Sicily bombing German targets
[02:38:31.980 --> 02:38:35.340]  and you always talked about how guilty he was that he had that heat stroke out working
[02:38:35.340 --> 02:38:39.860]  and digging they're actually digging trenches for when the Germans were strafing him in North
[02:38:39.860 --> 02:38:43.700]  Africa and he was out there all day in between missions because they'd have you fly a few
[02:38:43.700 --> 02:38:47.140]  missions have a few days off he had heat stroke it was actually kind of stroke like the sun
[02:38:47.140 --> 02:38:50.580]  in the eyes they said they called it heat stroke he was out for like a week when he
[02:38:50.580 --> 02:38:56.860]  got up from it they also said they were drinking the fuel out of rockets that was that was not
[02:38:56.860 --> 02:39:01.740]  enough liquor so the army was drinking rocket fuel that's a whole nother subject it was
[02:39:01.740 --> 02:39:05.380]  probably the rocket fuel but drinking the rocket fuel while they were digging ditches
[02:39:05.380 --> 02:39:11.260]  and he was the only one doing it that probably saved his life because the B-17 oh he's fine
[02:39:11.260 --> 02:39:15.540]  liberators time that was B-17s after that the liberator they called it the flying coffin
[02:39:15.540 --> 02:39:20.660]  because it blew up so easily because where they held the bombs his whole crew got killed
[02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:25.460]  so the point is I'm I don't know how I went into this whole story but that's what our
[02:39:25.460 --> 02:39:30.020]  forebears did this is 21st century war where they attack your family they attack your name
[02:39:30.020 --> 02:39:34.060]  I mean I went up against Hillary Clinton we really took her down you took her down and
[02:39:34.060 --> 02:39:38.380]  so I expected hit teams to come in here that's why I got guys you know on the roof with guns
[02:39:38.380 --> 02:39:41.980]  and you know all the rest of it because they have sent some people over here but that's
[02:39:41.980 --> 02:39:46.460]  not how they're doing it they're doing it with disinfo and all this stuff so I'm not
[02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:49.660]  happy it's happening I'm sorry they're saying horrible things about the crew that it's true
[02:39:49.660 --> 02:39:51.740]  because they know it's not getting to me so they're gonna start going after you I'm just
[02:39:51.740 --> 02:39:56.700]  warning you and that's why we got any infiltrators or operatives in here now folks you gotta tell
[02:39:56.700 --> 02:40:00.780]  me about it you gotta watch it because it'll try to set you up I mean this is 21st century

[02:52:01.500 --> 02:52:07.980]  to live and work with these companies in silicon valley i have many patriot friends that still work
[02:52:07.980 --> 02:52:12.860]  inside of these companies and feed me and us information and i've been predicting this stuff
[02:52:12.860 --> 02:52:18.860]  for about a year now it is only going to get worse they are going to continue to censor and
[02:52:18.860 --> 02:52:25.260]  stop the free flow of information they are going to continue to prevent president trump from getting
[02:52:25.260 --> 02:52:30.140]  his message out to the people you just pulled an article before uh facebook made an algorithm
[02:52:30.140 --> 02:52:34.780]  change earlier this year and they claim that they want to connect you more with your friends and
[02:52:34.780 --> 02:52:39.980]  family for your own well-being and this is the new narrative of silicon valley they're focused on
[02:52:39.980 --> 02:52:48.220]  the well-being and the mental health of their user happiness goodness right apparently these smug
[02:52:48.220 --> 02:52:53.580]  silicon valley elites know what's best for us normal average every day blue collar working
[02:52:53.580 --> 02:52:58.620]  class people um it's really astonishing what's happening you know we see hillary clinton tweet
[02:52:58.620 --> 02:53:03.500]  earlier this week that we should all care about how social media platforms play a part in our
[02:53:03.500 --> 02:53:09.500]  democratic process and she actually makes a veiled threat here she says unless it's addressed it will
[02:53:09.500 --> 02:53:14.700]  happen again and the midterms are in eight months we owe it to our democracy to get this right and
[02:53:14.700 --> 02:53:19.980]  fast that's right fix fix the internet so people can't communicate beside they want free market
[02:53:19.980 --> 02:53:24.780]  they've got to choose us they've got to choose the globalist they they've openly declared war
[02:53:24.780 --> 02:53:28.620]  and made the decision and the corporations have done it as news core said three weeks ago
[02:53:28.620 --> 02:53:32.700]  they're a big part of this their CEO said we met with all the tech heads we decided to censor the
[02:53:32.700 --> 02:53:36.700]  web to make more money so the real reason the companies are doing is knock out all the real
[02:53:36.700 --> 02:53:43.820]  communication have bots go out this is amazing absolutely and you know it's sickening this is
[02:53:43.820 --> 02:53:48.460]  their new narrative just days after hillary tweeted this out you have these silicon valley
[02:53:48.460 --> 02:53:54.140]  elites and these executives at facebook and twitter and google coming out with this shared
[02:53:54.140 --> 02:53:59.660]  similar collective narrative of oh we're going to improve the experience to help with the well-being
[02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:05.020]  of users on our platforms and it's your well-being to merge with the board give up your consciousness
[02:54:05.020 --> 02:54:10.860]  you want hillary you want you want us and then they and then they magnify all the sjw kill the
[02:54:10.860 --> 02:54:17.820]  president kill the white people crap it is crazy absolutely the double standards and the hypocrisy
[02:54:17.820 --> 02:54:23.500]  of big tech are disgusting and of big media for that matter if you are speaking you know hate
[02:54:23.500 --> 02:54:30.380]  speech towards whites or towards males or towards christians it's totally acceptable right that type
[02:54:30.380 --> 02:54:34.940]  of hate speech is allowed across all of these platforms is allowed in our culture is allowed
[02:54:34.940 --> 02:54:40.220]  in the media but the second that you are critical or the second that you have um any any kind of
[02:54:40.220 --> 02:54:45.820]  opinion that goes against the status quo of mainstream progressivism your band your censored
[02:54:45.820 --> 02:54:52.380]  your unperson from the internet we're seeing many youtubers including yourself getting these strikes
[02:54:52.380 --> 02:54:57.100]  and these are really arbitrary processes they're just trying to build their case and say oh look
[02:54:57.100 --> 02:55:01.660]  we gave him three chances it doesn't really matter you know eventually the comedy central
[02:55:01.660 --> 02:55:06.860]  goes how american is three strikes well now censorship is american and then even bloomberg
[02:55:06.860 --> 02:55:12.220]  reports now that they've removed the strikes and admit it's fake so there was such a backlash to me
[02:55:12.220 --> 02:55:16.380]  they've backed off but here's the thing everybody else is still getting banned uh mike adams is
[02:55:16.380 --> 02:55:20.940]  having his youtube band just said he came on yesterday uh dr course he's is all these gun
[02:55:20.940 --> 02:55:25.900]  groups so we made a big deal our audience did so they backed off on us but they're not backing
[02:55:25.900 --> 02:55:31.900]  off and other people that's absolutely right we have you you guys coming on and you're using
[02:55:31.900 --> 02:55:36.460]  gab tv to stream and back up all of your videos over there um you know there are let's announce
[02:55:36.460 --> 02:55:40.620]  that because we're gonna partner with you we're gonna partner with natural news everybody just
[02:55:40.620 --> 02:55:45.260]  has to start doing we did our own platform matt drudge link to it we usually do our own videos
[02:55:45.260 --> 02:55:49.340]  like a hundred thousand hundred thousand it had seven million views the two videos that they banned
[02:55:49.340 --> 02:55:53.900]  last friday and it showed that we didn't say what they said we said real people died they weren't
[02:55:53.900 --> 02:55:58.780]  crisis actors but he was on serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the police stood down and then
[02:55:58.780 --> 02:56:05.580]  and then youtube had to remove the strikes because we were able to show it this stuff is insanity over
[02:56:05.580 --> 02:56:12.220]  the past week i've seen videos and people bans uh videos removed they were factual real videos of
[02:56:12.220 --> 02:56:17.580]  one of the students uh speaking in his own words it wasn't an opinion piece or any of this this nature
[02:56:17.580 --> 02:56:23.020]  it was his own words it was him on camera saying these things and they they just scrubbed it they
[02:56:23.020 --> 02:56:26.700]  completely removed it from the internet i've never seen anything like this and meanwhile
[02:56:26.700 --> 02:56:31.740]  you have students who are also in the school that are pro 2a that are not being verified by twitter
[02:56:31.740 --> 02:56:36.060]  that are not getting any media attention that are being silenced in other way and a three thousand
[02:56:36.060 --> 02:56:40.620]  it's only four and exactly videos of students saying multiple shooters or they saw the police
[02:56:40.620 --> 02:56:46.300]  stand down being banned and then they say jones's video was banned because it said no one died and
[02:56:46.300 --> 02:56:51.260]  then we have the video and it's not that's what i mean the level of lying what is going on here
[02:56:53.020 --> 02:56:58.540]  it's disgusting and people need to wake up your viewers need to wake up conservatives christians
[02:56:58.540 --> 02:57:04.380]  libertarians nationalist populist uh anybody that is not far left to be frank we all need to
[02:57:04.380 --> 02:57:09.020]  wait commonsense libertarians this is a war we have to fight on facebook google twitter everywhere
[02:57:09.020 --> 02:57:15.100]  but we got to drive people to gab dot ai to info wars dot com to drudge report dot com and realize
[02:57:15.100 --> 02:57:19.660]  this is the big fight it's now this is bigger than the election of 2016 that was just a beachhead
[02:57:19.660 --> 02:57:25.180]  that made them cut accelerate their plan right absolutely and this war is only going to escalate
[02:57:25.180 --> 02:57:29.820]  and until we start building something new and supporting alternatives uh it's not going to go
[02:57:29.820 --> 02:57:34.540]  away and you know you can tell us when we come back google has said in the news they want him
[02:57:34.540 --> 02:57:38.860]  shut down they lobby lying about him saying it needs to be shut down there's hate speech on there
[02:57:38.860 --> 02:57:43.020]  so it's not just like it's their own platform they want to shut everything down that's anything to

[03:01:09.900 --> 03:01:12.980]  Free market will take us to the stars and we all know it.
[03:01:12.980 --> 03:01:14.580]  Socialism will take us to hell.
[03:01:14.580 --> 03:01:22.580]  Look at this latest story on Infowars.com and News Wars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:01:22.580 --> 03:01:23.580]  You knew it.
[03:01:23.580 --> 03:01:24.580]  Look at this guy.
[03:01:24.580 --> 03:01:28.860]  He's a beta that wants to be an alpha, but then he wants to do it by shutting down the
[03:01:28.860 --> 03:01:30.740]  level playing field.
[03:01:30.740 --> 03:01:34.980]  Man who sent white powder Donald Trump Jr. is a far left gun advocate.
[03:01:34.980 --> 03:01:39.420]  Facebook's page shows support for the resistance, or the real resistance to you, and numerous
[03:01:39.420 --> 03:01:41.060]  other left-wing causes.
[03:01:41.060 --> 03:01:42.060]  Unbelievable.
[03:01:42.060 --> 03:01:44.260]  We'll be talking about that article in a moment.
[03:01:44.260 --> 03:01:48.340]  Going back to gab.ai creator Andrew Torbo created just a few years ago.
[03:01:48.340 --> 03:01:51.540]  He was in Silicon Valley, very successful programmer.
[03:01:51.540 --> 03:01:53.180]  Google and others are calling for his banning.
[03:01:53.180 --> 03:01:58.020]  Who is the worst out of Facebook, Twitter, Google, all the Apple moving to China?
[03:01:58.020 --> 03:02:02.740]  Who is the worst of this combine?
[03:02:02.740 --> 03:02:05.780]  I would say that Twitter is probably one of the worst.
[03:02:05.780 --> 03:02:07.620]  We've had problems with Apple.
[03:02:07.620 --> 03:02:12.860]  We've had problems with Google not allowing us to have apps on their app stores, which
[03:02:12.860 --> 03:02:14.900]  by the way, that's a duopoly.
[03:02:14.900 --> 03:02:15.900]  They control and own.
[03:02:15.900 --> 03:02:18.500]  Oh yeah, $500,000 for not making a cake.
[03:02:18.500 --> 03:02:19.500]  I'd make the cake.
[03:02:19.500 --> 03:02:21.740]  It's free, but you let us have our damn apps.
[03:02:21.740 --> 03:02:23.060]  You don't keep us from the market.
[03:02:23.060 --> 03:02:24.060]  Make the app.
[03:02:24.060 --> 03:02:25.060]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:02:25.060 --> 03:02:26.060]  Yeah.
[03:02:26.060 --> 03:02:27.060]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:02:27.060 --> 03:02:28.060]  Bake the cake.
[03:02:28.060 --> 03:02:29.060]  Well, how about make the app?
[03:02:29.060 --> 03:02:30.060]  Right?
[03:02:30.060 --> 03:02:31.060]  Allow the app on the app store.
[03:02:31.060 --> 03:02:32.060]  So here's the thing, Alex.
[03:02:32.060 --> 03:02:35.940]  I think that these companies, they need some form of regulation.
[03:02:35.940 --> 03:02:40.220]  The government needs to step in, and this is tough for me as a free market conservative,
[03:02:40.220 --> 03:02:41.220]  right?
[03:02:41.220 --> 03:02:44.740]  But that's where government comes in when it's free market, is to protect it.
[03:02:44.740 --> 03:02:47.300]  And by the way, national polls, since you mentioned I'm interrupting, you're just
[03:02:47.300 --> 03:02:52.180]  totally on target, Axios, which is, of course, Politico, since they're just credited as a
[03:02:52.180 --> 03:02:54.620]  new name, public wants big tech regulated.
[03:02:54.620 --> 03:02:56.220]  They are pissed.
[03:02:56.220 --> 03:02:57.220]  Absolutely.
[03:02:57.220 --> 03:02:58.220]  Yeah.
[03:02:58.220 --> 03:03:02.500]  The public sentiment is shifting rapidly, and this is actually something that both
[03:03:02.500 --> 03:03:04.940]  the left and the right agree on.
[03:03:04.940 --> 03:03:09.740]  We are both, on both sides of the political aisle, fed up with big tech and with Silicon
[03:03:09.740 --> 03:03:10.740]  Valley.
[03:03:10.740 --> 03:03:14.180]  Now, it may be for different reasons, and we may have different ideas of how to solve
[03:03:14.180 --> 03:03:15.180]  that problem.
[03:03:15.180 --> 03:03:17.460]  But the honeymoon with big tech is over.
[03:03:17.460 --> 03:03:18.940]  The honeymoon is over.
[03:03:18.940 --> 03:03:19.940]  Right.
[03:03:19.940 --> 03:03:20.940]  Absolutely.
[03:03:20.940 --> 03:03:22.100]  Without a doubt.
[03:03:22.100 --> 03:03:23.100]  Keep going.
[03:03:23.100 --> 03:03:24.100]  Sorry.
[03:03:24.100 --> 03:03:29.820]  So I think that regulation is coming, and the Trump administration needs to do something.
[03:03:29.820 --> 03:03:32.700]  They need to do something before the 2020 campaign kicks off.
[03:03:32.700 --> 03:03:37.180]  And actually, you mentioned Brad Pereskel, Trump's new campaign manager.
[03:03:37.180 --> 03:03:41.260]  He is actually very red-pilled on this problem.
[03:03:41.260 --> 03:03:44.820]  He's tweeted about it several times about the bias and the double standards of big
[03:03:44.820 --> 03:03:45.820]  tech.
[03:03:45.820 --> 03:03:48.700]  And he sees the data firsthand.
[03:03:48.700 --> 03:03:52.900]  He better than anyone else knows what's happening and can see this happening right in the data
[03:03:52.900 --> 03:03:54.020]  right in front of his face.
[03:03:54.020 --> 03:03:58.260]  So we're hoping to get in touch with him to be able to work together and expose what's
[03:03:58.260 --> 03:04:04.260]  going on and hopefully build a new platform for Trump supporters for the 2020 election
[03:04:04.260 --> 03:04:07.620]  because, guess what, they're being no-platformed everywhere else.
[03:04:07.620 --> 03:04:11.700]  And Trump's got such a magnetism, if he just stays true and doesn't become a gun-grabber,
[03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:13.340]  will create the biggest website in the world.
[03:04:13.340 --> 03:04:14.740]  Trump can have that.
[03:04:14.740 --> 03:04:17.900]  And by the way, when I said, Brad, you know, Pascal shouldn't get all the credit, I'm just
[03:04:17.900 --> 03:04:19.940]  saying they say he's why Trump won.
[03:04:19.940 --> 03:04:23.380]  No drudge, the American people, all of us, okay?
[03:04:23.380 --> 03:04:25.660]  It's not about going, oh wait, we get the credit.
[03:04:25.660 --> 03:04:29.180]  It's about don't give credit where it ain't due because then we'll lose.
[03:04:29.180 --> 03:04:30.180]  We need it.
[03:04:30.180 --> 03:04:31.180]  It's all of us.
[03:04:31.180 --> 03:04:32.180]  It's you being active.
[03:04:32.180 --> 03:04:33.620]  I don't like this one person did it.
[03:04:33.620 --> 03:04:35.060]  That's a load of horsemen are.
[03:04:35.060 --> 03:04:36.060]  It isn't Trump.
[03:04:36.060 --> 03:04:37.060]  It isn't drudge.
[03:04:37.060 --> 03:04:38.060]  It isn't me.
[03:04:38.060 --> 03:04:39.060]  It's all of us together.
[03:04:39.060 --> 03:04:41.740]  And that's why all of you were so important to be active and not be passive and just think
[03:04:41.740 --> 03:04:42.740]  somebody else is handling it.
[03:04:42.740 --> 03:04:49.020]  But let's talk with a really smart guy, Andrew Torbov, cap.ai, with our next co-host about
[03:04:49.020 --> 03:04:50.700]  what do we do then?
[03:04:50.700 --> 03:04:51.940]  We know something's about to happen.
[03:04:51.940 --> 03:04:54.860]  What do we do?
[03:04:54.860 --> 03:04:59.820]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[03:04:59.820 --> 03:05:01.540]  and joint support.
[03:05:01.540 --> 03:05:04.700]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[03:05:04.700 --> 03:05:08.500]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[03:05:08.500 --> 03:05:12.860]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[03:05:12.860 --> 03:05:17.020]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[03:05:17.020 --> 03:05:21.300]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption
[03:05:21.300 --> 03:05:26.500]  to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and
[03:05:26.500 --> 03:05:28.260]  so much more.
[03:05:28.260 --> 03:05:32.740]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[03:05:32.740 --> 03:05:38.460]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[03:05:38.460 --> 03:05:44.420]  These combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme
[03:05:44.420 --> 03:05:47.300]  to work synergistically for full body support.

[03:06:05.460 --> 03:06:12.340]  All right, Andrew Torba of GAB, one of the only big independent social media networks
[03:06:12.340 --> 03:06:13.340]  that isn't censored.
[03:06:13.340 --> 03:06:14.340]  It's libertarian.
[03:06:14.340 --> 03:06:19.820]  They're breathing pagans, Christians, Muslims, agnostics, libertarian, you know, communists,
[03:06:19.820 --> 03:06:21.300]  conservatives, liberals.
[03:06:21.300 --> 03:06:22.300]  It's all there.
[03:06:22.300 --> 03:06:25.780]  He's making some really great points and I'm ranting because I'm under total attack
[03:06:25.780 --> 03:06:28.260]  and I can feel the energy of the enemy intensifying.
[03:06:28.260 --> 03:06:33.020]  I can see it and it just has my will just rising to just uncontrolled levels.
[03:06:33.020 --> 03:06:36.220]  This is the animating contest that Liberty Jefferson talked about.
[03:06:36.220 --> 03:06:40.540]  I don't like the fact they're so evil and so bad but their commitment to destroy us
[03:06:40.540 --> 03:06:42.540]  just absolutely sets my hair on fire.
[03:06:42.540 --> 03:06:45.260]  I mean, I've just got chills all over right now.
[03:06:45.260 --> 03:06:50.060]  I've got so much energy, it's unbelievable and I'm glad they're admitting how evil
[03:06:50.060 --> 03:06:51.060]  they are.
[03:06:51.060 --> 03:06:52.060]  They want censorship net wide.
[03:06:52.060 --> 03:06:53.460]  So we're talking about solutions.
[03:06:53.460 --> 03:06:55.500]  What does Trump do?
[03:06:55.500 --> 03:06:59.420]  Now by the way, when Anthony Cooney is done, I'm going to come back and be on a bunch
[03:06:59.420 --> 03:07:04.020]  for the next 30-something hours, we're doing a 34-hour broadcast, is Trump betraying the
[03:07:04.020 --> 03:07:05.420]  Second Amendment?
[03:07:05.420 --> 03:07:09.660]  And the answer is, I know in my gut and intellectually I've studied it.
[03:07:09.660 --> 03:07:10.660]  No.
[03:07:10.660 --> 03:07:15.740]  He has these free flow listen sessions where he says what they want to hear, he says what
[03:07:15.740 --> 03:07:19.380]  others want to hear and he says, hey, you may not get that Dianne Feinstein but put
[03:07:19.380 --> 03:07:21.700]  it in there and we'll see if it passes.
[03:07:21.700 --> 03:07:25.060]  He's being magnanimous like, oh, let me hear what you want with the dreamers.
[03:07:25.060 --> 03:07:27.980]  Maybe if they have been here 20 years and are not criminals, we'll have them and they
[03:07:27.980 --> 03:07:31.660]  want total legalization even to felons and total chain migration and the end of the border
[03:07:31.660 --> 03:07:36.380]  is completely in UN control and everything, he goes, whoa, they got nothing.
[03:07:36.380 --> 03:07:37.620]  He showed them as unreasonable.
[03:07:37.620 --> 03:07:41.060]  I'm not just defending Trump but you judge a tree by its fruits.
[03:07:41.060 --> 03:07:45.460]  So far we've gotten all this great reasonable stuff and turned things back and they hate
[03:07:45.460 --> 03:07:50.140]  him and were killing TPP and the better jobs, the better stock market.
[03:07:50.140 --> 03:07:53.380]  But I got to tell you, even though I get his tactic, the Second Amendment, he shouldn't
[03:07:53.380 --> 03:07:54.380]  do it.
[03:07:54.380 --> 03:08:00.220]  You can get it with dreamers and other issues but not with this because you can't say, oh,
[03:08:00.220 --> 03:08:02.780]  well, I want to get rid of the due process.
[03:08:02.780 --> 03:08:05.780]  You know, when somebody's a killer, the due process was he was already adjudicated nuts.
[03:08:05.780 --> 03:08:07.300]  It was on government drugs.
[03:08:07.300 --> 03:08:08.700]  He can't buy guns.
[03:08:08.700 --> 03:08:13.220]  Just like the shooter at the Texas church a few months ago, he'd been adjudicated in
[03:08:13.220 --> 03:08:18.100]  a mental institution insane, escaped from it and the Air Force didn't put it at the
[03:08:18.100 --> 03:08:19.100]  database.
[03:08:19.100 --> 03:08:20.100]  So he talks for three, four hours in a meeting.
[03:08:20.100 --> 03:08:24.220]  They take a few clips out of context but still, Dianne Feinstein, Rebiter Hansen rather
[03:08:24.220 --> 03:08:28.580]  like the wicked witch of Satan, you know, and agreeing.
[03:08:28.580 --> 03:08:30.660]  It's just, it's too much.
[03:08:30.660 --> 03:08:34.260]  Anthony Cummings, and we'll go back to Mr. Torben and get his take on what does Trump
[03:08:34.260 --> 03:08:35.260]  need to do.
[03:08:35.260 --> 03:08:41.340]  Internet Bill of Rights, break up these companies, point out what's going on.
[03:08:41.340 --> 03:08:42.340]  What do we do?
[03:08:42.340 --> 03:08:47.980]  Build new platforms like compoundmedia.com because he had the number one show on Threshold
[03:08:47.980 --> 03:08:53.020]  Radio for a while and because it was kind of libertarian, it wasn't liberal conservatives.
[03:08:53.020 --> 03:08:57.020]  They really fear something that unifies and then the number one on XM and that made people
[03:08:57.020 --> 03:09:01.060]  jealous so he's kicked off because he said these people killing cops and our people are
[03:09:01.060 --> 03:09:02.060]  savages.
[03:09:02.060 --> 03:09:04.820]  We don't care if they're water black, they are savages, shoot some random cop.
[03:09:04.820 --> 03:09:09.460]  That's why I'm glad, rising like a Phoenix, he has compoundmedia that became an incubation,
[03:09:09.460 --> 03:09:13.500]  you know, dish for all these other great hosts that go and then come back.
[03:09:13.500 --> 03:09:14.500]  It doesn't matter.
[03:09:14.500 --> 03:09:18.900]  It's that we're fighting and now the web itself they want to get rid of, the playing
[03:09:18.900 --> 03:09:19.900]  field.
[03:09:19.900 --> 03:09:23.940]  The cards are stacked, we have the will, we're still winning so they want to shut him down.
[03:09:23.940 --> 03:09:27.020]  That's why it's great to have him hosting with us, letting us kind of have an emergency
[03:09:27.020 --> 03:09:33.660]  take over here because I'm a sexual assaulter according to Newsweek and I, what was the
[03:09:33.660 --> 03:09:35.180]  other thing?
[03:09:35.180 --> 03:09:38.540]  And I'm grooming men for gay sex because we're in a big editing suite and we're trying to
[03:09:38.540 --> 03:09:40.100]  lie to a guy for a bodybuilding shot.
[03:09:40.100 --> 03:09:41.540]  This is all admitted in HR.
[03:09:41.540 --> 03:09:42.540]  He said it.
[03:09:42.540 --> 03:09:45.940]  Yeah, it says how to lie to a bodybuilder and there's images of men in this editing
[03:09:45.940 --> 03:09:50.500]  bay in speedos and we're like, uh, that's all in HR.
[03:09:50.500 --> 03:09:55.500]  But the point is, is that he says, I went in and saw gay porn and I think that's grooming
[03:09:55.500 --> 03:09:58.140]  for gay sex four years ago.
[03:09:58.140 --> 03:09:59.620]  And then a girl hugs me.
[03:09:59.620 --> 03:10:03.060]  She says, which I didn't even do by the way, I'm in a room with a one, well, I'm like,
[03:10:03.060 --> 03:10:04.540]  pants, I don't get on elevators alone alone.
[03:10:04.540 --> 03:10:05.540]  No, seriously.
[03:10:05.540 --> 03:10:06.540]  One woman getting on.
[03:10:06.540 --> 03:10:07.900]  I don't do it.
[03:10:07.900 --> 03:10:11.380]  And then that is sexually assaulting her.
[03:10:11.380 --> 03:10:14.260]  I mean, that may fly in the fake news media.
[03:10:14.260 --> 03:10:17.340]  It's not flying even in front of a Democrat jury.
[03:10:17.340 --> 03:10:18.940]  My lawyers are good.
[03:10:18.940 --> 03:10:23.020]  And they say, my God, we've never seen something that's ridiculous.
[03:10:23.020 --> 03:10:25.260]  I mean, this is, but let me tell you something.
[03:10:25.260 --> 03:10:26.260]  It doesn't matter.
[03:10:26.260 --> 03:10:28.660]  People walk by and say, you lost your kids, even though I didn't.
[03:10:28.660 --> 03:10:33.220]  People walk by and say, you know, all this stuff cause the leftist takes talking points.
[03:10:33.220 --> 03:10:36.500]  They say that there's Mars basis I reported on that kids live on.
[03:10:36.500 --> 03:10:37.500]  I never said that.
[03:10:37.500 --> 03:10:38.860]  They just say it, but it doesn't matter.
[03:10:38.860 --> 03:10:39.860]  That's the zombies.
[03:10:39.860 --> 03:10:40.860]  Let me ask you Anthony Cumia.
[03:10:40.860 --> 03:10:41.860]  We'll take over a couple of segments.
[03:10:41.860 --> 03:10:42.860]  Appreciate you.
[03:10:42.860 --> 03:10:43.860]  Let me board this operation.
[03:10:43.860 --> 03:10:46.860]  I really appreciate you doing what you do at com.media.com.
[03:10:46.860 --> 03:10:48.860]  What in Hades is going on here?
[03:10:48.860 --> 03:10:53.420]  Because you know, you're now on air with a sexual assault her cause a girl says she hugged
[03:10:53.420 --> 03:10:56.860]  me and I pat it a little far too down, Anthony.
[03:10:56.860 --> 03:11:00.740]  Alex, uh, first of all, damn, I love your show.
[03:11:00.740 --> 03:11:06.860]  I sit here before I get the, the honor of, uh, hosting that last hour and I'm laughing
[03:11:06.860 --> 03:11:07.860]  my ass off.
[03:11:07.860 --> 03:11:08.860]  I'm entertained.
[03:11:08.860 --> 03:11:09.860]  I'm informed.
[03:11:09.860 --> 03:11:10.860]  It's, it's fantastic.
[03:11:10.860 --> 03:11:11.860]  Thanks.
[03:11:11.860 --> 03:11:12.860]  Thanks so much, man.
[03:11:12.860 --> 03:11:19.340]  Uh, you know, they, they have said things like this about me also sexual harassment.
[03:11:19.340 --> 03:11:24.620]  There's, there's a, uh, great, uh, thing going around in some circles that I, uh, have sex
[03:11:24.620 --> 03:11:27.060]  with transsexuals.
[03:11:27.060 --> 03:11:29.700]  It's just an amazing, this is their tactic.
[03:11:29.700 --> 03:11:34.780]  They pull these things out and I think because they see how well it works with the left,
[03:11:34.780 --> 03:11:40.580]  with the degenerates in Hollywood, they actually see that people get, uh, prosecuted.
[03:11:40.580 --> 03:11:45.140]  They get thrown out of their businesses and go, wow, let's just accuse the people we want
[03:11:45.140 --> 03:11:49.180]  out of existence and we want exile to nowhere land.
[03:11:49.180 --> 03:11:53.940]  And we'll say that they're as big a degenerates as we are.
[03:11:53.940 --> 03:11:57.580]  And that's exactly what they're doing with you, with me and with a lot of you.
[03:11:57.580 --> 03:12:04.660]  When they cannot debate and argue a point because they have nothing, they turn to sexual
[03:12:04.660 --> 03:12:11.540]  harassment, you're this, you're a horrible father, we're wearing Nazi tennis shoes.
[03:12:11.540 --> 03:12:14.740]  And I guess his, I guess his writers, that's what they are fiction writers.
[03:12:14.740 --> 03:12:17.700]  They think if you say something really weird, it must be true because it's so weird.
[03:12:17.700 --> 03:12:19.860]  Like, oh, let me put my Hitler shoes on.
[03:12:19.860 --> 03:12:22.620]  I mean, what the hell?
[03:12:22.620 --> 03:12:28.020]  From head to toe, there's Hitler shoes, the Hitler haircut, then everything in between
[03:12:28.020 --> 03:12:34.460]  just to peg you as, which I love literally Hitler, members, members, it was a good looking
[03:12:34.460 --> 03:12:40.540]  teapot, JC Penney, but it had a black top, which is normal, but it did a shadow and somebody
[03:12:40.540 --> 03:12:44.740]  might see Hitler, so they banned the teapot.
[03:12:44.740 --> 03:12:50.260]  It's getting to the point where I go to the onion, which has been a funny satirical news
[03:12:50.260 --> 03:12:52.020]  site for years.
[03:12:52.020 --> 03:12:57.860]  And I don't know if it's the, what's supposed to be the real news or a satire site.
[03:12:57.860 --> 03:12:58.940]  It's insane.
[03:12:58.940 --> 03:13:04.860]  Today, somebody said that in a park, they had to remove a gorilla from a cage that kids
[03:13:04.860 --> 03:13:09.340]  have played on for 15 years because someone found it racially insensitive.
[03:13:09.340 --> 03:13:15.340]  Well, I'm guessing whoever saw that and thought it was racially insensitive is the racist.
[03:13:15.340 --> 03:13:20.500]  And kids love like, they love horses, they love donkeys, they love chickens, they love
[03:13:20.500 --> 03:13:22.940]  pigs, they love gorillas, they love giraffes.
[03:13:22.940 --> 03:13:27.660]  I mean, I've got in my daughter's nursery, my 10, 10 month old daughter, we've got little
[03:13:27.660 --> 03:13:32.380]  paintings of Dr. Seuss and we've got a curious George painting.
[03:13:32.380 --> 03:13:34.580]  We've got a painting of a giraffe.
[03:13:34.580 --> 03:13:37.660]  Anthony, you just, oh my God, that's why it's supremacist.
[03:13:37.660 --> 03:13:38.660]  We've got curious.
[03:13:38.660 --> 03:13:39.660]  They've gotten, yeah.
[03:13:39.660 --> 03:13:46.260]  Yeah, I've never seen people that are more racist than the left.
[03:13:46.260 --> 03:13:47.780]  That's their whole gimmick.
[03:13:47.780 --> 03:13:51.980]  It's like saying, it's like saying info wars is behind you and there's an, oh, Anthony
[03:13:51.980 --> 03:13:56.100]  Cumea put an image of someone's anus on TV subliminally.
[03:13:56.100 --> 03:13:59.500]  It's that delusional like, Anthony, why do you have that image of a man's?
[03:13:59.500 --> 03:14:00.500]  That's gay.
[03:14:00.500 --> 03:14:04.580]  Why are you, Anthony, why are you grooming me for gay sex?
[03:14:04.580 --> 03:14:06.300]  There's an anus clearly right there.
[03:14:06.300 --> 03:14:08.300]  No, I'm, I'm gonna sue you.
[03:14:08.300 --> 03:14:09.300]  I'm gonna sue you.
[03:14:09.300 --> 03:14:11.940]  Why did you put a man's rectum in front of me?
[03:14:11.940 --> 03:14:15.060]  Why are you trying to, are you trying to have sex with me?
[03:14:15.060 --> 03:14:18.460]  The person that sees that has the problem.
[03:14:18.460 --> 03:14:21.300]  The person that actually came up with it is the lunatic.
[03:14:21.300 --> 03:14:22.300]  Exactly.
[03:14:22.300 --> 03:14:23.300]  What are those ink blots?
[03:14:23.300 --> 03:14:24.300]  What are those called?
[03:14:24.300 --> 03:14:25.800]  Oh, a Rorschach test.
[03:14:25.800 --> 03:14:26.800]  Rorschach.
[03:14:26.800 --> 03:14:27.800]  It's like crazy.
[03:14:27.800 --> 03:14:29.300]  Like, like, like, what do you see?
[03:14:29.300 --> 03:14:31.300]  Well, I see info wars in the continents.
[03:14:31.300 --> 03:14:34.300]  No, you see a man's butt.
[03:14:34.300 --> 03:14:38.100]  Hey, there's a gorilla at the zoo.
[03:14:38.100 --> 03:14:40.900]  Oh my God, you're putting black people down.
[03:14:40.900 --> 03:14:42.740]  It's racially insensitive.
[03:14:42.740 --> 03:14:49.020]  I, I, and, and, and I'm so happy that that, those layers are being peeled off and they're
[03:14:49.020 --> 03:14:54.460]  being exposed for the mental patients that they are.
[03:14:54.460 --> 03:14:57.940]  I tell you though, they're teaching people that are like failures or they'll even have
[03:14:57.940 --> 03:15:02.700]  jobs and they just, they decide to go with this and it ruins their lives, but they believe
[03:15:02.700 --> 03:15:05.900]  going SJW is like the way.
[03:15:05.900 --> 03:15:09.060]  And then they just walk around and saying, we're going to come back and get solutions
[03:15:09.060 --> 03:15:14.020]  from Andrew Torba of gab.ai who they're trying to censor about what does Trump need to do?
[03:15:14.020 --> 03:15:16.940]  And I want to ask you that, that I'm going to punch out here and let you take over Anthony
[03:15:16.940 --> 03:15:19.300]  Cumi on fire as usual.
[03:15:19.300 --> 03:15:20.300]  We'll be right back.

[03:15:21.300 --> 03:15:22.300]  We've never had 8% off.
[03:15:22.300 --> 03:15:28.340]  A lot of these are lost leaders, like everything 80% is, is like stuff that we haven't sold.
[03:15:28.340 --> 03:15:33.660]  Great t-shirts, great books, great films that that's, we're losing money on those.

[03:17:25.060 --> 03:17:30.540]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.

[03:17:55.540 --> 03:17:58.900]  Introducing Cell Force by Infowars Life.
[03:17:58.900 --> 03:18:02.980]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[03:18:02.980 --> 03:18:05.740]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:18:05.740 --> 03:18:08.740]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:18:08.740 --> 03:18:13.060]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[03:18:13.060 --> 03:18:15.540]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:18:15.540 --> 03:18:20.020]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[03:18:20.020 --> 03:18:22.460]  reactive oxygen species.
[03:18:22.460 --> 03:18:27.620]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[03:18:27.620 --> 03:18:30.540]  these reactive oxygen species.
[03:18:30.540 --> 03:18:35.580]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:18:35.580 --> 03:18:40.420]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[03:18:40.420 --> 03:18:42.940]  species and other free radicals.
[03:18:42.940 --> 03:18:48.220]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from Infowars Life.

[03:18:54.780 --> 03:18:58.260]  Infowars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:18:58.260 --> 03:19:03.020]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[03:19:03.020 --> 03:19:08.420]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health
[03:19:08.420 --> 03:19:09.820]  and normal breathing.
[03:19:09.820 --> 03:19:10.820]  This is pollen block.
[03:19:10.820 --> 03:19:16.180]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[03:19:16.180 --> 03:19:22.340]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes,
[03:19:22.340 --> 03:19:23.820]  and excessive mucus production.
[03:19:23.820 --> 03:19:28.700]  They began studying the effects in their public trials.
[03:19:28.700 --> 03:19:34.820]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research of fast-acting chewable tablets, just two tablets
[03:19:34.820 --> 03:19:39.620]  at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in
[03:19:39.620 --> 03:19:43.220]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[03:19:43.220 --> 03:19:47.460]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block available now at

[03:03:36.060 --> 03:20:27.260]  defense of human liberty you're listening to the alex jones rising up out
[03:20:27.260 --> 03:20:31.180]  of play this whole song because we're almost at the final stands here where I totally win
[03:20:31.180 --> 03:20:37.660]  as everybody knows another cheesy line from what is it pat benatar the invincible winner
[03:20:37.660 --> 03:20:44.280]  haha we can all smell it we all know it all of your winners as well andrew torbogab dot
[03:20:44.280 --> 03:20:49.140]  a i under globalist attack massive independent social network and of course and they kill
[03:20:49.140 --> 03:20:54.660]  me a compound media dot com formerly a top he me I remember back here in like 1520 years
[03:20:54.660 --> 03:20:58.780]  ago like you know the ansy kumia show was like number one in the morning all over the
[03:20:58.780 --> 03:21:03.100]  country they got so mad at it he made a fart joke they banned him as they put him on xm
[03:21:03.100 --> 03:21:08.020]  became number one kicked him off there because he wasn't the communist he wasn't an sjw
[03:21:08.020 --> 03:21:13.500]  he's a libertarian so let me ask you both this question going back to andrew torbogab
[03:21:13.500 --> 03:21:16.900]  what does the president need to do because I know we can get any messages I mean we got
[03:21:16.900 --> 03:21:21.980]  people in the white house he is listening like you said his new guy who was the head
[03:21:21.980 --> 03:21:27.420]  of his internet operation Brad Pascal you're saying it is more red pilled and gets this
[03:21:27.420 --> 03:21:32.420]  is the whole fight it's already happening for 2018 2020 so we kind of got a twin problem
[03:21:32.420 --> 03:21:35.980]  now what do you make of the second amendment comments versus also the internet what does
[03:21:35.980 --> 03:21:42.380]  the president need to do sure so I think he needs to take immediate and swift action he
[03:21:42.380 --> 03:21:48.180]  needs to take this seriously and we all as his supporters need to take this seriously
[03:21:48.180 --> 03:21:52.980]  as well when you think about it Alex we're up against unlimited resources both human
[03:21:52.980 --> 03:21:56.820]  and capital total and complete control the internet total and complete control of the
[03:21:56.820 --> 03:22:02.620]  media total and complete control of our culture and entertainment and yet the elite fear us
[03:22:02.620 --> 03:22:08.020]  and they do everything in their power to silence us why well it's because what we have is more
[03:22:08.020 --> 03:22:14.100]  powerful than all of those things combined it's ideas it's passion it's grit it's authentic
[03:22:14.100 --> 03:22:20.180]  community it's a sense of urgency you know these are the things that it empower us against
[03:22:20.180 --> 03:22:25.180]  the globalist and against the elites to get the truth out there and I think in order for
[03:22:25.180 --> 03:22:30.460]  us to succeed in order for us to defend the the rights and the liberties that we all love
[03:22:30.460 --> 03:22:34.220]  including the freedom of speech including the second amendment we need to stand up and
[03:22:34.220 --> 03:22:38.460]  fight back we need to get loud and we need to get the president's attention to take
[03:22:38.460 --> 03:22:43.980]  action on this I agree and it was the great French philosopher that said that no army
[03:22:43.980 --> 03:22:49.580]  can stop a idea whose time has come if you look at Brad Parscale I was pronouncing it
[03:22:49.580 --> 03:22:55.340]  wrong I'm teleprompter free you know if he gets that it's great but this is not a 2020
[03:22:55.340 --> 03:23:01.580]  issue this is happening this is happening right now and so I mean I agree we need to
[03:23:01.580 --> 03:23:05.900]  do something now they're moving against us because they know they're trying to dominate
[03:23:05.900 --> 03:23:09.700]  us and I want to be online that's that's more than 80% of the battle but we should all do
[03:23:09.700 --> 03:23:14.340]  more demonstrations we should more shoot more things outside we should talk to more people
[03:23:14.340 --> 03:23:18.140]  we should get more people involved the answer is more people speaking out with whatever
[03:23:18.140 --> 03:23:23.260]  their information is whatever their worldview is whatever their truth is from their perspective
[03:23:23.260 --> 03:23:28.700]  and not cookie cutter that's what's going to win Anthony Coombs yeah when you when
[03:23:28.700 --> 03:23:34.780]  you see people demonstrating on the left like we saw last week where those kids are demonstrating
[03:23:34.780 --> 03:23:40.380]  against the Second Amendment and they're out there do you see people trying to silence
[03:23:40.380 --> 03:23:45.540]  them do you see protesters inciting violence against them they're able to get up there
[03:23:45.540 --> 03:23:51.580]  speak and say what they want to say and I have no problem with that go ahead I never
[03:23:51.580 --> 03:23:58.380]  want to infringe on anybody's right to free speech but the second a conservative a libertarian
[03:23:58.380 --> 03:24:02.700]  someone with a different viewpoint gets up and tries to talk it's boy have to be met
[03:24:02.700 --> 03:24:12.020]  with bottles fire of flags of clubs being hit over the head they do not want us to even
[03:24:12.020 --> 03:24:18.620]  speak for us to even be heard they call it hate speech it has no place in the First Amendment
[03:24:18.620 --> 03:24:22.380]  so where does it go Anthony coming if we give in we know in every case in history if we
[03:24:22.380 --> 03:24:26.500]  give into this I want to ask Mr. Torber that as well where does it end if we give in we
[03:24:26.500 --> 03:24:30.580]  know where it ends it's a domino we've got to hold the line this is it if you don't want
[03:24:30.580 --> 03:24:39.060]  to be Venezuela or North Korea folks this is it Anthony absolutely well you know people
[03:24:39.060 --> 03:24:47.100]  like Andrew that are that are really gearing up and firing up a different platform for
[03:24:47.100 --> 03:24:53.300]  us because Twitter is ridiculous I don't know who's delusional enough to think this
[03:24:53.300 --> 03:25:01.300]  isn't an agenda driven platform you have people like Sarah Silverman who is just apparently
[03:25:01.300 --> 03:25:06.580]  people thought she was funny years ago she's up there now she could say whatever she wants
[03:25:06.580 --> 03:25:12.020]  in whatever language she wants against somebody that she disagrees with the second you turn
[03:25:12.020 --> 03:25:17.540]  and criticize her using the same language she used mind you you're thrown off of the
[03:25:17.540 --> 03:25:23.780]  platform it is so by the way bringing that up to you and then Torba it's famous with
[03:25:23.780 --> 03:25:29.460]  Roger Stone he was criticizing people that were saying he's a piece of crap he's a communist
[03:25:29.460 --> 03:25:35.540]  he needs to die he just said you're a screwball screw you to Oberman and and one other lady
[03:25:35.540 --> 03:25:40.540]  he got banned and his lawyers even met when they admitted well we're a leftist group we're
[03:25:40.540 --> 03:25:44.380]  a minority group so we're allowed to say those mean things you're a white male you're not
[03:25:44.380 --> 03:25:49.980]  I was talking to a lawyer today high level and he was coming up this other case and he
[03:25:49.980 --> 03:25:56.100]  said well they're claiming they're heterosexual and you discriminate against that that's impossible
[03:25:56.100 --> 03:26:00.100]  because that's a dominant group and I was disagreeing with this high level lawyer even
[03:26:00.100 --> 03:26:04.820]  though their claims BS I was going what a heterosexual can never I mean man I'm to do
[03:26:04.820 --> 03:26:13.860]  this is this is like cuckoo land we've we've entered an amazing world a bizarro world where
[03:26:13.860 --> 03:26:19.500]  you can't criticize or critique a movie because of the subject matter like we saw with Black
[03:26:19.500 --> 03:26:26.780]  Panther there's been zero media as far as what's going on with white farmers being
[03:26:26.780 --> 03:26:33.660]  being having their land taken away in South Africa because they are looked at as privileged
[03:26:33.660 --> 03:26:40.700]  and as people that are incapable of being prejudiced against or or and by the way they
[03:26:40.700 --> 03:26:47.460]  live in cobra infested lion infested areas and produce 7% of the food only 40,000 farms
[03:26:47.460 --> 03:26:53.220]  and half are closing up and South Africa watch in three years South Africa will be starving
[03:26:53.220 --> 03:26:59.300]  we will have all the leftist sending food there but everybody right now is looking like good
[03:26:59.300 --> 03:27:03.620]  they're getting what they deserve and this is amazing because you know they're they're
[03:27:03.620 --> 03:27:09.860]  the privileged class and they're being oppressed right now doesn't matter what color you are
[03:27:09.860 --> 03:27:15.900]  race religion if you're being oppressed you're being oppressed that's it and you know these
[03:27:15.900 --> 03:27:19.580]  people are not you're not going to hear about this Anthony coming up taking over on the
[03:27:19.580 --> 03:27:23.940]  other side we're down on what six hours into the global transmission this can continue
[03:27:23.940 --> 03:27:27.380]  emergency free speech transmission we had to set up for weeks I had no idea that we'd
[03:27:27.380 --> 03:27:31.060]  be under total attack what actually happened we're finishing with Amber Andrew Torbath
[03:27:31.060 --> 03:27:40.740]  special ride the shotgun and co hosting gab dot a i closing comments sir yeah I think where
[03:27:40.740 --> 03:27:45.980]  this ends up is they want us dead or in jail to be very blunt this is a global information
[03:27:45.980 --> 03:27:51.140]  war and if we don't stand up and fight back they're going to win we need to stand up for
[03:27:51.140 --> 03:27:56.660]  our freedom of expression for our individual liberty for the free flow of information these
[03:27:56.660 --> 03:28:01.020]  are the things that made this country great and that is how we're going to make the country
[03:28:01.020 --> 03:28:06.300]  great again so I think that you know what we need to do is continue to build new platforms
[03:28:06.300 --> 03:28:11.340]  continue to support new platforms like gab and like others we can't put all of our eggs
[03:28:11.340 --> 03:28:16.780]  in one basket why are we continuing to support no I agree everyone who has a facebook twitter
[03:28:16.780 --> 03:28:21.140]  or youtube account should go to gab that I yeah right now they should all get a profile
[03:28:21.140 --> 03:28:26.140]  all be there and then use facebook to push to gab but say this for years and everybody
[03:28:26.140 --> 03:28:30.740]  should go to compound media dot com and sign up there and pick a show you want to subscribe
[03:28:30.740 --> 03:28:35.460]  to because this is a war and I'm telling you it's not about me and some damn money I got
[03:28:35.460 --> 03:28:39.580]  a family ranch of a whole nine yards I've spent my own money on this I'm doing this
[03:28:39.580 --> 03:28:43.060]  because we got a there are a lot to cuss on everywhere else but I can't tell you they
[03:28:43.060 --> 03:28:46.580]  are a bunch of effing you know what I'm gonna stop right there we're gonna come back Anthony
[03:28:46.580 --> 03:28:52.860]  Cummy is taking over straight ahead it's up to you America the answer to being in control

[03:33:34.660 --> 03:33:40.460]  tell you this is the epic fight for free speech the draconian internet takeover is here the
[03:33:40.460 --> 03:33:46.740]  solid war against the second amendment everything it is on the it was almost like a death rattle
[03:33:46.740 --> 03:33:49.860]  or kind of a death battle kind of you gotten stabbed and you kind of fight back hard for
[03:33:49.860 --> 03:33:54.060]  a minute that's what I see trump as is like a breath of air you're been caught in a rip
[03:33:54.060 --> 03:33:57.740]  current I've been caught in a really bad one but one time I got caught in one about eight
[03:33:57.740 --> 03:34:02.180]  or two yards down the Texas coast and hit a river a stream coming out and that kind
[03:34:02.180 --> 03:34:06.660]  of ended it so I was able to get up and I'm not the fighter out of dying I remember it
[03:34:06.660 --> 03:34:10.580]  had been a big storm water was flowing out shouldn't have been swimming I was like 12
[03:34:10.580 --> 03:34:15.500]  that sucked under but I was already a really great swimmer and I relaxed came back up didn't
[03:34:15.500 --> 03:34:19.420]  panic that sucked on a little bit more but only got stuck there for like 10 seconds but
[03:34:19.420 --> 03:34:25.300]  you can panic doing that pop back up another five seconds got over that sucked down you
[03:34:25.300 --> 03:34:31.460]  know half a mile or whatever came back out and that's what this is like ladies and gentlemen
[03:34:31.460 --> 03:34:35.820]  so we can't panic we've been sucked under we kind of came back up with trump for a minute
[03:34:35.820 --> 03:34:39.260]  back under again and we just chill out relax and kind of just kind of we're going to get
[03:34:39.260 --> 03:34:45.220]  back to the surface those currents go up and down but they're all over the news saying
[03:34:45.220 --> 03:34:49.660]  deep platform us ban us from the Internet when you ban us from the Internet it sets the
[03:34:49.660 --> 03:34:55.220]  precedent and three weeks ago the Wall Street Journal said news core that's Fox met with
[03:34:55.220 --> 03:35:01.700]  the big Democrats and Google and Facebook and decided to censor and they said we'll
[03:35:01.700 --> 03:35:06.100]  use info wars is the beginning God we're going to like make a lot of money then Marie
[03:35:06.100 --> 03:35:12.020]  Le Pen criminally charged for anti ISIS tweets that's the day news wars.com China just banned
[03:35:12.020 --> 03:35:16.900]  the letter in from the Internet and when he the poo again as they keep showing the dictator
[03:35:16.900 --> 03:35:20.460]  is that he's already addicted to the Communist Party they're making him permanent and then
[03:35:20.460 --> 03:35:24.700]  Trump take guns first go through the process and I get him an open talk like because they
[03:35:24.700 --> 03:35:28.700]  go surge due process the guy already had due process he was going to kill people he was
[03:35:28.700 --> 03:35:32.260]  mentally ill he was on drugs the gun should already been taken they stood down Trump's
[03:35:32.260 --> 03:35:36.580]  like well if due process got messed up he says going to kill people take it I get an
[03:35:36.580 --> 03:35:41.180]  emergency situation somebody says I'm going to kill people there's no judge there's no
[03:35:41.180 --> 03:35:46.660]  jury witness says it cops grab you Trump just is in there talking for hours and he says
[03:35:46.660 --> 03:35:50.420]  oh yeah do this and hey put in the bill what you want let's work something out he did that
[03:35:50.420 --> 03:35:57.500]  on DACA and they they they brought an unreasonable thing back and fell apart that's what he's
[03:35:57.500 --> 03:36:02.540]  doing I think but still you want to drive your base away Trump I think is making a big
[03:36:02.540 --> 03:36:07.540]  mistake people are going crazy Anthony Cummings of compound media dot com what do you think
[03:36:07.540 --> 03:36:13.780]  about this absolutely I was tweeting about this last night and unfortunately yes tweeting
[03:36:13.780 --> 03:36:19.980]  I wish I could get to everybody through a place like gab but until we really get a lot
[03:36:19.980 --> 03:36:24.380]  of people on on both we got to be on all of you still got to be on both but like you said
[03:36:24.380 --> 03:36:29.780]  drive them toward the alternative to Twitter but I was on the last night talking about
[03:36:29.780 --> 03:36:33.780]  this and a lot of people worry that Donald Trump is going against what he said about
[03:36:33.780 --> 03:36:38.620]  the Second Amendment during his campaign and I said have you read R to the deal the R to
[03:36:38.620 --> 03:36:46.380]  the deal this is how he bargains now I agree with you 100% it's a very risky move to alienate
[03:36:46.380 --> 03:36:51.580]  that base that put you in office but we all have to remember he's done this before this
[03:36:51.580 --> 03:36:58.340]  is how he does it he becomes a sympathetic person to the opposition they're like oh look
[03:36:58.340 --> 03:37:04.100]  he's wants to work with us for me and I can't believe fine-standing them don't get it they
[03:37:04.100 --> 03:37:10.940]  believe the the left the Democrats and unfortunately a lot of his supporters believe what he's saying
[03:37:10.940 --> 03:37:17.500]  and take it at face value this is how he negotiates he gives them what they want and then when
[03:37:17.500 --> 03:37:23.100]  they pour 10 times more on top and it gets shot down he goes well I tried to make the
[03:37:23.100 --> 03:37:29.140]  kids safe and he says that exactly he knows it's I know he's doing that so how do I respond
[03:37:29.140 --> 03:37:31.980]  to my listeners at a rate of tear my head off when I say that because I'm never gonna
[03:37:31.980 --> 03:37:36.700]  steer people wrong I may be wrong but I'm telling you really what I believe and I can't
[03:37:36.700 --> 03:37:41.580]  think I agree with you this is what he does over and over did we get DACA no because it
[03:37:41.580 --> 03:37:46.060]  was no so I mean did they get no or are they trying to kill him are they trying to kill
[03:37:46.060 --> 03:37:52.420]  me yeah they know yeah he was talking about letting twice as many people in or to stay
[03:37:52.420 --> 03:37:58.860]  then then they wanted and everybody lost their minds what where you ran on on a campaign
[03:37:58.860 --> 03:38:03.100]  of building the wall because he tricked them to trick them to be arrogant and say no borders
[03:38:03.100 --> 03:38:07.820]  world government f you you're a Nazi like everybody's legalized f you Nazi he tricked
[03:38:07.820 --> 03:38:13.700]  them exactly I based on his and this isn't just like you said this before it's not just
[03:38:13.700 --> 03:38:19.780]  being always a trump head he's he did it but just backs trump at every turn no I'm basing
[03:38:19.780 --> 03:38:26.620]  it off of what I've already seen him do this is how he operates it's an amazing negotiation
[03:38:26.620 --> 03:38:32.180]  playing them like a Strativarius absolutely and if it turns out to be wrong he'll pay
[03:38:32.180 --> 03:38:38.060]  for it but like it is a risky move but in this situation nothing's gonna be easy you
[03:38:38.060 --> 03:38:44.580]  have the media and the left at the entertainment it is a it is a master master it's a master
[03:38:44.580 --> 03:38:52.380]  move yeah you have all those people and organizations against you you have to take some risky moves
[03:38:52.380 --> 03:38:58.740]  to win in these situations it's called upon he's he's he knows they want he knows fine
[03:38:58.740 --> 03:39:03.180]  sign bills a total assault weapons all semi-autos man so he goes absolutely I'm not saying you're
[03:39:03.180 --> 03:39:06.820]  gonna get it let's go get the clip right I've heard laughing I'm not saying you're gonna
[03:39:06.820 --> 03:39:11.020]  get it but you put it in and then the Republicans are all shaking their heads they've got the
[03:39:11.020 --> 03:39:15.700]  majority it isn't gonna happen that way it's so clear what he's doing cuz I read art of
[03:39:15.700 --> 03:39:19.420]  the deal I had read like two years ago I finally thought this guy's about to win I better read
[03:39:19.420 --> 03:39:25.500]  this book and then I got now you see Trump is following a total formula yeah it's it's
[03:39:25.500 --> 03:39:32.940]  how he operates and the Republicans sat there stone-faced because they're politicians they
[03:39:32.940 --> 03:39:38.860]  never operated like this he's a businessman who's negotiated and made deals his entire
[03:39:38.860 --> 03:39:43.340]  career and that's what he's doing right now right in front of your face and let's be clear
[03:39:43.340 --> 03:39:46.660]  they go always only worth 10 billion others worth 100 billion he didn't do it there's
[03:39:46.660 --> 03:39:50.820]  some combine of some global group he did it always has his own that's why they fear him
[03:39:50.820 --> 03:39:56.620]  that we have that clip of Einstein looking like a witch like when he says it here it
[03:39:56.620 --> 03:40:06.420]  is ladies and gentlemen add that to this bill that would be great and if you could add what
[03:40:06.420 --> 03:40:12.620]  you have also and I think you can into the bill yeah so are you ready can you do that
[03:40:12.620 --> 03:40:17.020]  Joe can you do that back can you add some of the things you're not going to agree just

[03:40:25.780 --> 03:40:35.340]  it's very narrow and it's about dating partners and number of states have just you can add
[03:40:35.340 --> 03:40:46.700]  domestic violence paragraphs pages into this bill I'm all for it he's all for it go ahead

[03:40:51.900 --> 03:40:57.220]  for gun control he's all but no he's all for adding it in just add it in go ahead notice
[03:40:57.220 --> 03:41:06.020]  he says it may not pass it's taking the taking the piss out of him he knows politicians are
[03:41:06.020 --> 03:41:11.340]  the greediest people you'll ever encounter so you tell him exactly you tell him you're
[03:41:11.340 --> 03:41:18.140]  winning they'll tell you who they really are yes and they'll pile more things on any bill
[03:41:18.140 --> 03:41:24.420]  and it will lose and he looks like the good guy it's so obvious and it's brilliant he's
[03:41:24.420 --> 03:41:28.140]  done it before and not and he's not he's not let us down yet like he's told me personally
[03:41:28.140 --> 03:41:32.780]  I will not let you down but did you see Feinstein still doesn't get it she can't even get the

[03:41:59.500 --> 03:42:05.220]  a big risk and I don't want people that are disillusioned because he's working this tactic
[03:42:05.220 --> 03:42:11.300]  to get too nervous and back away from supporting him but this is what he does have faith in
[03:42:11.300 --> 03:42:17.580]  the guy for for during the campaign and during his presidency hasn't let us down yet he hasn't
[03:42:17.580 --> 03:42:22.980]  let us down yet and but I mean let me tell you know he's not infallible way better than

[03:53:22.340 --> 03:53:28.820]  by those those tactics we don't try to shut them down i feel the more they actually talk

[03:53:33.260 --> 03:53:38.980]  the time and they just will not come on because they never have anything they they have the
[03:53:38.980 --> 03:53:46.140]  ability to call you every type of ist or fobe they have the ability to make false allegations
[03:53:46.140 --> 03:53:52.820]  about sexuality and and uh domestic violence and they but they will not come on and actually
[03:53:52.820 --> 03:53:58.020]  are you a point as far as the gun issue goes i have never in my life seen a group of people
[03:53:58.020 --> 03:54:05.260]  so ignorant about the actual thing they are trying to take away the the the laws the rights
[03:54:05.260 --> 03:54:11.220]  the mechanics of a gun the the the laws to get certain weapons in this country i've never
[03:54:11.220 --> 03:54:18.540]  seen a group of people it's completely ignorant about what they're trying to keep from people
[03:54:18.540 --> 03:54:24.460]  and that's uh but that's the left they they'll call you a gun nut they'll call you you have
[03:54:24.460 --> 03:54:30.340]  the blood of children on your hands yeah like all that stuff instead of just having a logical
[03:54:30.340 --> 03:54:37.620]  reasonable debate back and forth i can't get a volley on social media to go past two exchanges
[03:54:37.620 --> 03:54:42.020]  before it they don't have enough honor an honorable man or woman wants to be real in
[03:54:42.020 --> 03:54:46.300]  debate they because their followers and this society has been so good the west has been
[03:54:46.300 --> 03:54:51.580]  so rich it's created a bunch of beta followers who want to then just shut down debate so
[03:54:51.580 --> 03:54:57.420]  they can claim they get the trophy but never wanted that's that and that's what we were
[03:54:57.420 --> 03:55:02.740]  saying years ago the first articles we read that said can you believe this they're giving
[03:55:02.740 --> 03:55:07.500]  kids participation trophies can you believe this they're not keeping score in the sports
[03:55:07.500 --> 03:55:12.020]  in schools anymore because some people get hurt they're not having valentine's day you
[03:55:12.020 --> 03:55:19.380]  can't have a father daughter dance anymore because some people it it disappointment is
[03:55:19.380 --> 03:55:26.620]  part of life unfair times i've had my ass handed to me when i became a man right that's
[03:55:26.620 --> 03:55:31.260]  that's it you have to know what it's like valentine's day as a kid when when some kids
[03:55:31.260 --> 03:55:36.420]  are getting cards and other kids aren't that's part of what you'll experience in life you're
[03:55:36.420 --> 03:55:41.860]  supposed to learn about how to deal with people in a society you're exactly but you've got
[03:55:41.860 --> 03:55:46.020]  to know what's the song you got to know how to lose it's it's uh it's that erasmus song
[03:55:46.020 --> 03:55:51.380]  from the late 70s you've got to know how to lose and know how to win yeah and and that's
[03:55:51.380 --> 03:55:57.620]  absolutely true and and you're taking that away from kids who at this point have no idea
[03:55:57.620 --> 03:56:03.820]  of how to face-to-face actually talk to someone anyway because of social media so you're taking
[03:56:03.820 --> 03:56:09.540]  away when they are in school and they are uh together in a group you're taking away
[03:56:09.540 --> 03:56:14.620]  all types of education that they would get on how to deal with people you're teaching
[03:56:14.620 --> 03:56:18.820]  them as long as you're in a leftist globalist cult and follow that will let you spread your
