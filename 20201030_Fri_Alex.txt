[00:00.000 --> 00:15.680]  It is Friday, October 30th, the year is 2020, the year now four days from an attempt by
[00:15.680 --> 00:22.200]  the deep state ally of the communist China to initiate and ignite a civil war that will
[00:22.200 --> 00:24.160]  destroy our republic.
[00:24.160 --> 00:27.080]  The democrats have committed to carry this out.
[00:27.080 --> 00:31.840]  I got a call early this morning by a very well-nationally known talk show host, and
[00:31.840 --> 00:33.720]  he said, have you seen what Pelosi just said?
[00:33.720 --> 00:34.720]  And I said, no.
[00:34.720 --> 00:39.280]  And he said, it confirms everything you're saying.
[00:39.280 --> 00:46.720]  I then clicked on my phone and watched the clip that he sent me and stumbled as I was
[00:46.720 --> 00:48.560]  walking through my living room.
[00:48.560 --> 00:59.280]  Pelosi has come out and said, no matter what, no matter what, Joe Biden is going to be the
[00:59.280 --> 01:00.280]  president.
[01:00.280 --> 01:02.840]  Now, a few months ago, she said this as well.
[01:02.840 --> 01:07.480]  She said, doesn't matter, even if he stays in the White House, we'll have our own inauguration.
[01:07.480 --> 01:10.640]  The White House isn't geographic.
[01:10.640 --> 01:13.040]  The presidency isn't geographic.
[01:13.040 --> 01:16.800]  So they're telling you they're going to contest, and now they're saying even if President Trump
[01:16.800 --> 01:21.680]  handily wins, they're going to contest, which has been Podesta and the Clintons and Obama's
[01:21.680 --> 01:22.680]  plan.
[01:22.680 --> 01:26.360]  That's why they put out so many ballots and people got two or three copies and dead cats
[01:26.360 --> 01:27.360]  got copies.
[01:27.360 --> 01:30.080]  So they're going to say, oh, there's millions of uncounted.
[01:30.080 --> 01:32.720]  We can never have the election until they've been counted.
[01:32.720 --> 01:34.560]  Well, it's an impossible job.
[01:34.560 --> 01:36.720]  They give you impossible things like COVID.
[01:36.720 --> 01:39.840]  Oh, the cases are way up, way up, but deaths aren't up.
[01:39.840 --> 01:42.880]  But as soon as the winter gets here, there'll be normal flu and pneumonia deaths, and they're
[01:42.880 --> 01:45.760]  saying, oh, there'll be triple COVID deaths by January.
[01:45.760 --> 01:48.920]  Well, of course, there'll be triple what's currently dying because they're going to count
[01:48.920 --> 01:53.800]  all the flu and all the other pneumonias.
[01:53.800 --> 01:57.480]  These people are criminals that lie through statistics, ladies and gentlemen, and they
[01:57.480 --> 01:58.480]  know what they're doing.
[01:58.480 --> 02:00.640]  And now they tell you the mask is never coming off.
[02:00.640 --> 02:04.240]  Now, martial laws being declared in Europe by the EU.
[02:04.240 --> 02:05.560]  People are fleeing to the countryside.
[02:05.560 --> 02:07.760]  Jihadis are allowed to murder at will.
[02:07.760 --> 02:08.760]  It's all happening.
[02:08.760 --> 02:10.200]  We'll cover it in a moment.
[02:10.200 --> 02:14.200]  But ladies and gentlemen, this is civil war they're preparing.
[02:14.200 --> 02:18.320]  This is initiating a overthrow of the election.
[02:18.320 --> 02:20.080]  They tried four years ago.
[02:20.080 --> 02:25.040]  They're trying it again right now because they cannot deal with the huge awakening and all
[02:25.040 --> 02:26.840]  the crimes they've committed are coming out.
[02:26.840 --> 02:29.040]  There's huge new Hunter Biden developments.
[02:29.040 --> 02:30.040]  We're covering it all.
[02:30.040 --> 02:34.640]  But first, here's an important piece put together by Darren McBreen about why people stand stronger
[02:34.640 --> 02:38.880]  for Trump than ever under the incredible bullying.
[02:38.880 --> 02:41.000]  Why am I voting for Donald Trump?
[02:41.000 --> 02:42.000]  Because of you.
[02:42.000 --> 02:43.000]  I'm talking to you, liberals.
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.440]  You're the ones doing everything you can to destroy our country.
[02:46.440 --> 02:50.240]  You're the ones who want to destroy our culture, our history, and our heritage.
[02:50.240 --> 02:54.400]  You tear down our statues, you destroy our monuments, and you desecrate our heroes.
[02:54.400 --> 03:00.520]  You encourage and participate in the rioting and the looting and destruction of our cities.
[03:00.520 --> 03:04.280]  You call the protests peaceful, and then turn around and release the violent criminals back
[03:04.280 --> 03:05.600]  onto the streets.
[03:05.600 --> 03:06.600]  All charges dropped.
[03:06.600 --> 03:08.520]  What's wrong with you?
[03:08.520 --> 03:11.200]  All this while defunding our police.
[03:11.200 --> 03:15.760]  You want wide open borders and sanctuary cities for illegal migrants.
[03:15.760 --> 03:18.280]  What is it about illegal that you don't understand?
[03:18.280 --> 03:22.600]  You say I grew up with white privilege, but you don't know anything about me.
[03:22.600 --> 03:26.520]  Where I've been, the things I've seen, you don't know my history.
[03:26.520 --> 03:28.920]  You call me a white supremacist.
[03:28.920 --> 03:30.960]  You called me an Uncle Tom.
[03:30.960 --> 03:32.120]  I'm a Nazi.
[03:32.120 --> 03:33.120]  Seriously?
[03:33.120 --> 03:34.120]  Get out of here.
[03:34.120 --> 03:36.920]  You refuse to accept the truth.
[03:36.920 --> 03:40.880]  You wouldn't know the truth if it hit you in the face, but it's worse than that.
[03:40.880 --> 03:43.600]  You censor the truth from getting out.
[03:43.600 --> 03:47.200]  You ridicule the people that speak the truth.
[03:47.200 --> 03:48.400]  Why do you have to be like this?
[03:48.400 --> 03:53.000]  You're the gullible sheep who trust the fake news mockingbird media.
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.640]  You think Jeffrey Epstein really did kill himself?
[03:56.640 --> 04:00.960]  You've infiltrated our universities and academia to brainwash our youth into thinking America
[04:00.960 --> 04:05.400]  is a racist country, and that socialism is the answer.
[04:05.400 --> 04:06.480]  I don't think so.
[04:06.480 --> 04:09.520]  When I try to talk to you, you don't listen.
[04:09.520 --> 04:14.320]  When I want to have a conversation, you call me names or block me out.
[04:14.320 --> 04:15.720]  How is that going to help anything?
[04:15.720 --> 04:17.000]  I don't get it.
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.440]  You're embarrassed to call yourself an American.
[04:20.440 --> 04:24.720]  We are proud of our country and our heritage and our culture.
[04:24.720 --> 04:29.080]  Like it or not, we are going to make America great again.
[04:29.080 --> 04:30.080]  Again.
[04:30.080 --> 04:32.360]  Why are we going to be like that, Tom?
[04:32.360 --> 04:41.800]  Because of you.
[04:41.800 --> 04:45.440]  Make America great again, again.
[04:45.440 --> 04:48.080]  Make America great again, again.
[04:48.080 --> 04:50.280]  I'm going to add another again.
[04:50.280 --> 04:58.640]  This way I can sell you all an extra hat, and it all goes down again.
[04:58.640 --> 05:03.760]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshiped for thousands
[05:03.760 --> 05:05.520]  of years by ancient civilizations.
[05:05.520 --> 05:09.480]  With modern science, we know that turmeric is so popular.
[05:09.480 --> 05:11.320]  It's antioxidant effect.
[05:11.320 --> 05:14.280]  It's anti-inflammatory effect.
[05:14.280 --> 05:20.040]  Everything it does is simply amazing, and most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[05:20.040 --> 05:28.600]  They're 3 to 5% curcuminoid, but we have body's ultimate turmeric formula with a 95%
[05:28.600 --> 05:34.040]  curcuminoid level, and we have other organic products in there that accelerate it and bring
[05:34.040 --> 05:35.560]  it into the cells of the body.
[05:35.560 --> 05:36.800]  It's been sold out for months.
[05:36.800 --> 05:41.800]  It's back in stock, and despite that, body's ultimate turmeric formula at infowarstore.com
[05:41.800 --> 05:48.400]  is 50% off with free shipping and triple-patriot points at infowarstore.com.
[05:48.400 --> 05:50.600]  It's body's ultimate turmeric formula.

[05:56.400 --> 05:57.400]  and you can't lose.
[05:57.400 --> 06:14.200]  Here's the infowar.
[06:14.200 --> 06:17.800]  The final countdown, the final countdown.
[06:17.800 --> 06:23.560]  Here we are, where we were four years ago, on the eve of that historic election.
[06:23.560 --> 06:26.280]  And now the stakes are even higher.
[06:26.280 --> 06:33.400]  Now the world is awakening to globalism, and the forces of globalism are striking back
[06:33.400 --> 06:36.560]  in incredibly vicious ways.
[06:36.560 --> 06:38.120]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:38.120 --> 06:40.080]  It is Friday, October 30th.
[06:40.080 --> 06:47.400]  The year is 2020, and then there's the 79 days of hell that I've been talking about
[06:47.400 --> 06:50.280]  that start the day of the election.
[06:50.280 --> 06:55.040]  The Democrats have openly said, first in internal statements that in white papers, that in war
[06:55.040 --> 06:59.680]  game operations, then in Democrat think tank statements, then in the New York Times three
[06:59.680 --> 07:05.320]  months ago, that they are going to contest, they know Trump's going to win, and that they're
[07:05.320 --> 07:10.920]  going to have Western states split off, tank the dollar in the stock market, have race riots
[07:10.920 --> 07:16.080]  nationwide as the cover, and try to drive President Trump from office.
[07:16.080 --> 07:23.960]  The big corporations, the banks, Hollywood, the chai comms, the Democrats, all of these
[07:23.960 --> 07:34.120]  systems along with radical Islam and communist China are allied against us right now.
[07:34.120 --> 07:40.640]  We have put together a historic compilation of intelligence that we're going to air in
[07:40.640 --> 07:47.520]  the next segment of the last four months where they set this up to launch it.
[07:47.520 --> 07:50.600]  We told you when they were in the secret phases that this was happening, but now they've
[07:50.600 --> 07:54.360]  prepared themselves, they've prepared the public, and they're going to make their move
[07:54.360 --> 07:55.360]  in four days.
[07:55.360 --> 07:59.360]  It's why they flooded us with the 80 million ballots, a lot of people got three or four
[07:59.360 --> 08:02.840]  ballots, dead cats, dead dogs, dead people got them.
[08:02.840 --> 08:07.760]  So there's such a confusion level so that even if Trump is winning by three, four points
[08:07.760 --> 08:11.520]  in battleground states and statistically has a majority, and you can see that there's
[08:11.520 --> 08:16.440]  a bunch of votes that haven't been cast, but still he'd win if all of those went Democrat,
[08:16.440 --> 08:19.440]  they're going to say we don't care, they're all going to be counted, and they put out
[08:19.440 --> 08:24.480]  so many millions of fake ones that he may never be able to get to that number because
[08:24.480 --> 08:28.440]  they'll never be able to count enough of the ballots to give him that clear victory, but
[08:28.440 --> 08:40.120]  Pelosi just signaled today that she is intending to contest the election no matter what and
[08:40.120 --> 08:46.160]  even if Trump is the clear winner, he will not be inaugurated and Joe Biden will be made
[08:46.160 --> 08:47.160]  the president.
[08:47.160 --> 08:51.000]  So I want that to sink in for you, for myself, for everybody because when I learned this
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.360]  this morning, it was staggering.
[08:54.360 --> 08:58.640]  She went on national television and now it's coming in that she's made the statement again
[08:58.640 --> 09:00.520]  so it's now a talking point.
[09:00.520 --> 09:06.840]  These videos are pouring in right now that regardless if Trump wins, he will not be president
[09:06.840 --> 09:10.960]  and it will be Joe Biden and they will inaugurate him meaning they'll have a consortium of blue
[09:10.960 --> 09:16.440]  states get together in a civil war and announce that they are succeeding and that he is their
[09:16.440 --> 09:19.440]  president and they will geographically announce the breakup of the country.
[09:19.440 --> 09:21.800]  How do I know this?
[09:21.800 --> 09:26.720]  She said it three months ago on national television and then her surrogates all began parroting
[09:26.720 --> 09:27.720]  it as well.
[09:27.720 --> 09:32.240]  This is the UN Chai Kong move to break up the country.
[09:32.240 --> 09:36.360]  Pelosi and Biden are just Chinese agents, totally compromised.
[09:36.360 --> 09:39.720]  They know that China will release info on them if they don't follow orders to destroy
[09:39.720 --> 09:44.960]  America, the Communist will, and they know that Trump and the Justice Department is starting
[09:44.960 --> 09:48.120]  to move in on them.
[09:48.120 --> 09:53.120]  And so now they're cornered, ladies and gentlemen, here is Pelosi and what she said.
[09:53.120 --> 09:58.120]  Here it is.
[09:58.120 --> 10:00.280]  But we are ready.
[10:00.280 --> 10:06.080]  I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday.
[10:06.080 --> 10:13.000]  Whatever the end count is, but on the election that occurs on Tuesday, he will be elected
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.040]  president on January 20th, he will be inaugurated president of the United States.
[10:20.040 --> 10:23.920]  Now let's go ahead and play that for you for radio listeners and TV viewers.
[10:23.920 --> 10:24.920]  One more time.
[10:24.920 --> 10:26.280]  Listen to her very, very carefully.
[10:26.280 --> 10:28.280]  Here it is.
[10:28.280 --> 10:30.440]  But we are ready.
[10:30.440 --> 10:36.280]  I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday, whatever
[10:36.280 --> 10:43.920]  the end count is, but on the election that occurs on Tuesday, he will be elected on January
[10:43.920 --> 10:48.920]  20th, he will be inaugurated president of the United States.
[10:48.920 --> 10:52.840]  Now, notice, that's not a slip.
[10:52.840 --> 10:55.800]  That's what she's been saying for months, that it doesn't matter what the election
[10:55.800 --> 10:58.200]  says, we're not going to accept it.
[10:58.200 --> 11:05.600]  And then we're going to have states secede, and then we will seat him geographically from
[11:05.600 --> 11:09.880]  another location, and that geography doesn't matter, the White House doesn't matter.
[11:09.880 --> 11:14.160]  It matters who they say the president is.
[11:14.160 --> 11:18.280]  Just like they tell you that the Hunter Biden laptop, which is campaign admins is real,
[11:18.280 --> 11:24.600]  the FBI admins is real, is Russian disinfo, and 51% of Americans in a poll believe that.
[11:24.600 --> 11:27.960]  That's obviously a skewed poll, but there is a large portion that believe if somebody
[11:27.960 --> 11:30.080]  slips on a banana peel, the Russians did it.
[11:30.080 --> 11:34.400]  Because the Bidens, they couldn't ever do anything wrong.
[11:34.400 --> 11:38.160]  And of course, they're telling you that Trump is to blame for the virus, and that we can
[11:38.160 --> 11:43.720]  never get out from under the virus again, and they're announcing all over the country
[11:43.720 --> 11:46.800]  in Democrat controlled areas, that you're going to have to have an app on your phone,
[11:46.800 --> 11:51.880]  it's now official, to buy and sell, to go to a restaurant, and everyone must be registered
[11:51.880 --> 11:54.800]  and have a phone to be able to leave your house.
[11:54.800 --> 11:57.920]  Michigan's dictator, Whitmer, has now launched it.
[11:57.920 --> 12:01.800]  We noticed the first universities in the U.S. to say you can't leave the campus this year,
[12:01.800 --> 12:06.000]  this semester, and you have to be tracked by a phone that's issued to you.
[12:06.000 --> 12:07.520]  That is now going statewide.
[12:07.520 --> 12:09.920]  So it's been announced in France and England.
[12:09.920 --> 12:12.160]  You must have a cell phone tracked at all times.
[12:12.160 --> 12:15.240]  This is beyond 1984.
[12:15.240 --> 12:19.160]  The headline at infowars.com and newswars.com needs to be spread to the forewinds.
[12:19.160 --> 12:27.280]  It is civil war is imminent, Democrats will not accept Trump victory, says Pelosi.
[12:27.280 --> 12:31.600]  That's why you'd cause a civil war, is when a group says we don't accept the election,
[12:31.600 --> 12:33.320]  we don't accept the president.
[12:33.320 --> 12:39.840]  It happened before in the early 1860s with Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis, and
[12:39.840 --> 12:42.640]  you know the rest of what happened.
[12:42.640 --> 12:47.000]  And in that war, at least both sides had some serious beefs, and it was Americans fighting
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.640]  with each other.
[12:48.640 --> 12:52.880]  This is communist Chinese, globalist funded, to absolutely destroy the country.
[12:52.880 --> 13:00.440]  And I side with the voters, I side with President Trump, I side with common sense, and my family
[13:00.440 --> 13:04.920]  against the chai comms and against the globalists, but everybody better understand, the globalists
[13:04.920 --> 13:07.480]  would be making this move, they didn't feel powerful.
[13:07.480 --> 13:11.880]  They're now announcing major email services will read your emails and will not let you
[13:11.880 --> 13:14.800]  have an email account if they disagree with what you're saying.
[13:14.800 --> 13:17.000]  That's in the news.
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.680]  They're now announcing text messages are being read by starting with Facebook and others
[13:20.680 --> 13:23.280]  and they're going to control that.
[13:23.280 --> 13:28.800]  If they see you saying you think President Trump won, then you're going to get in trouble
[13:28.800 --> 13:29.800]  with them.
[13:29.800 --> 13:34.120]  You better not self censor folks, you better speak out now and say no and find services
[13:34.120 --> 13:38.520]  that won't act like this, and you better use email, that last way to communicate and the
[13:38.520 --> 13:43.680]  telephone while you still can to call friends and family and direct them to election night
[13:43.680 --> 13:44.840]  dot news.
[13:44.840 --> 13:45.840]  That's our new URL.
[13:45.840 --> 13:51.240]  They're not blocking now on Facebook and Twitter for now may get blocked to mere hours.

[13:55.960 --> 14:01.600]  emergency election newsletter for the underground videos, the articles, the breaking Intel,

[14:08.160 --> 14:12.200]  newsletter info wars dot com forward slash newsletter.
[14:12.200 --> 14:19.520]  We're going to add a link under the live show feed today with the headline Civil War to

[14:24.120 --> 14:28.040]  Paul Revere so you can spread it separately.
[14:28.040 --> 14:30.520]  There's going to be a lot of deaths from flu, there's going to be a lot of deaths from pneumonia
[14:30.520 --> 14:31.520]  as there always is.
[14:31.520 --> 14:34.920]  We're so run down, we're so undernourished, we're so sickly in this country, we're so
[14:34.920 --> 14:36.680]  drugged out of our brains.
[14:36.680 --> 14:43.800]  I personally boost my body's natural defenses with high quality essential vitamins and nutrients.
[14:43.800 --> 14:48.360]  Vitamin mineral fusion is back in stock, free shipping, triple-patria points, 25% off, it's

[14:59.960 --> 15:07.240]  Body's 95% to cumanoid, highest, strongest, you're going to find out through a turmeric.

[15:18.360 --> 15:22.120]  essential to electrochemical activity and all cellular function.
[15:22.120 --> 15:24.600]  These are the things that globalists don't want you to have.
[15:24.600 --> 15:27.520]  These are the things that they fought to keep you from even knowing about.
[15:27.520 --> 15:32.000]  The average American doesn't even know you die without vitamin C or vitamin D3 or that
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.880]  you die without iodine and they don't want you to know that you and even immense over
[15:35.880 --> 15:41.360]  2 billion people have lower cognitive operation because of iodine deficiency and are the number
[15:41.360 --> 15:44.280]  one cause of mental disability is iodine deficiency.
[15:44.280 --> 15:46.120]  The globalists take it out of everything on purpose.
[15:46.120 --> 15:50.040]  They're murdering slime criminals that want you dumb and stupid so they can slowly kill
[15:50.040 --> 15:53.120]  you with all these viruses they're producing.
[15:53.120 --> 15:56.560]  Go to InfowarsStore.com and it supports the broadcast and gets you essential vitamins and
[15:56.560 --> 15:58.240]  minerals, water filtration, infiltration.
[15:58.240 --> 16:01.840]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[16:01.840 --> 16:02.840]  Me too.
[16:02.840 --> 16:07.000]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.720]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[16:09.720 --> 16:14.080]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[16:14.080 --> 16:15.840]  You probably already believe that.
[16:15.840 --> 16:17.000]  I certainly do.
[16:17.000 --> 16:18.000]  So here's the thing.
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.400]  If you wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[16:22.400 --> 16:27.640]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support, now you'll have to sign
[16:27.640 --> 16:32.280]  a waiver but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[16:32.280 --> 16:33.720]  No curious or treatments there.

[16:38.240 --> 16:42.840]  support product based on that research called Immune10x.

[16:47.200 --> 16:50.440]  of Immune10x without paying anything today.

[16:57.440 --> 17:02.480]  Attention radio listeners, if you're concerned about the coming chaos after the November
[17:02.480 --> 17:05.840]  elections, this will be an extremely important message.
[17:05.840 --> 17:06.840]  Here's why.
[17:06.840 --> 17:13.640]  No matter what the outcome in November, catastrophic social upheaval is a very real possibility.
[17:13.640 --> 17:14.880]  Here's why this is important.
[17:14.880 --> 17:19.760]  Listen, we all know that silver and gold have been historic hedges against the uncertain
[17:19.760 --> 17:25.160]  waves of social chaos and unstable currencies, but did you know that there's been times
[17:25.160 --> 17:30.720]  in the past during times of extreme hardship when Americans put another store of value
[17:30.720 --> 17:32.680]  above even silver and gold?
[17:32.680 --> 17:37.560]  It's true, open pollinated seeds have been and could very well be the ultimate store
[17:37.560 --> 17:40.120]  of value in the coming hard times ahead.
[17:40.120 --> 17:44.240]  Go to survivalseedbank.com to get heirloom seeds below wholesale.

[18:14.180 --> 18:17.560]  Simply go to band.video with your Safari browser.
[18:17.560 --> 18:20.800]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[18:20.800 --> 18:24.280]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[18:24.280 --> 18:26.380]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[18:26.380 --> 18:28.660]  I suggest band.video.
[18:28.660 --> 18:33.240]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[18:33.240 --> 18:34.240]  to stop it.
[18:34.240 --> 18:38.360]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[18:38.360 --> 18:42.560]  add the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[18:42.560 --> 18:46.720]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below.
[18:46.720 --> 18:51.160]  On your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want, be sure and share
[18:51.160 --> 18:52.160]  band.video.
[18:52.160 --> 19:02.400]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[19:02.400 --> 19:06.720]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[19:06.720 --> 19:11.440]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[19:11.440 --> 19:15.960]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[19:15.960 --> 19:20.740]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[19:20.740 --> 19:26.480]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[19:26.480 --> 19:32.480]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[19:32.480 --> 19:39.080]  Studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[19:39.080 --> 19:43.680]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[19:43.680 --> 19:49.480]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[19:49.480 --> 19:52.280]  facts that pertain to reality.
[19:52.280 --> 20:01.200]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[20:01.200 --> 20:28.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:28.800 --> 20:35.840]  Four days, ladies and gentlemen, four days, my friends, four days, my fellow patriots.
[20:35.840 --> 20:38.320]  You have lived to see it.
[20:38.320 --> 20:45.440]  World government, the whole anti-human pedophile satanic agenda, rising.
[20:45.440 --> 20:50.080]  But we're also seeing massive awakening in people that didn't think we were accurate,
[20:50.080 --> 20:54.440]  that the lowest levels and the highest levels of civilization are now completely converting
[20:54.440 --> 20:56.240]  to reality.
[20:56.240 --> 21:02.600]  Now, I'm going to play this seven-minute compilation that is proof of criminal conspiracy and
[21:02.600 --> 21:05.680]  proof of criminals preparing the public.
[21:05.680 --> 21:09.800]  Because if you've got a public conspiracy, you have to first get your operatives in line,
[21:09.800 --> 21:14.680]  you have to test balloon it, you have to pay to test it, and then you roll it out.
[21:14.680 --> 21:21.680]  And so this is Pelosi and Hillary Clinton and all of them in the last three, four months
[21:21.680 --> 21:27.040]  preparing the public for the event that breaks the country up, which is the globalist goal.
[21:27.040 --> 21:31.360]  It's break the country up, it's devalue the dollar, it's bring in world government, it's
[21:31.360 --> 21:36.160]  kill U.S. superpower status to make room for the E.U. and communist China, to them absorb
[21:36.160 --> 21:37.760]  the United States.
[21:37.760 --> 21:43.600]  Then we come back, a special report I just shot, we're premiering here on air, of total
[21:43.600 --> 21:52.040]  proof, total proof that is coming out of what's really on the laptop of Hunter Biden.
[21:52.040 --> 21:56.280]  Giuliani confirming, indeed, it is pedophilia, it is rape of children.
[21:56.280 --> 22:00.600]  That is coming up next segment, spread the word, Paul Revere, now here is the open treason.
[22:00.600 --> 22:08.880]  One of the things that I think we and other media need to start doing is preparing the
[22:08.880 --> 22:14.840]  American people that there's nothing illegitimate about this election taking additional days
[22:14.840 --> 22:17.760]  or even weeks to make sure that all the votes are counted.
[22:17.760 --> 22:23.040]  In fact, that might be important to make sure that this is a legitimate and fair election.
[22:23.040 --> 22:27.200]  The reason we talk about a red mirage is in fact because we believe that on election night
[22:27.200 --> 22:33.640]  we are going to see Donald Trump in a stronger position than the reality actually is.
[22:33.640 --> 22:38.000]  We are sounding an alarm and saying that this is a very real possibility, that the data
[22:38.000 --> 22:42.200]  is going to show on election night an incredible victory for Donald Trump.
[22:42.200 --> 22:49.800]  Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out
[22:49.800 --> 22:57.600]  and eventually I do believe he will win if we don't give an inch and if we are as focused
[22:57.600 --> 23:00.680]  and relentless as the other side is.
[23:00.680 --> 23:06.080]  You have a result on election night where it appears that Donald Trump has won, but
[23:06.080 --> 23:12.480]  a result after ballots are counted that show that Joe Biden has actually won.
[23:12.480 --> 23:13.480]  That's right.
[23:13.480 --> 23:17.040]  We essentially built a simulator where it's a sequence of sliders and you just pull those
[23:17.040 --> 23:20.480]  sliders to start seeing what the scenarios will show you.
[23:20.480 --> 23:23.320]  What's it going to look like on election night, what's it going to look like the day after
[23:23.320 --> 23:25.120]  and the day after that and the day after that.
[23:25.120 --> 23:32.560]  So if one of the candidates in any of the races claims victory before there's a consensus
[23:32.560 --> 23:40.080]  result then we're going to add some informational context to that post directly saying that
[23:40.080 --> 23:42.600]  there's no consensus result yet.
[23:42.600 --> 23:47.840]  We see in the data that twice as many voters intend to cast a ballot by mail than have
[23:47.840 --> 23:48.840]  ever before.
[23:48.840 --> 23:53.160]  They are disproportionately Joe Biden supporters.
[23:53.160 --> 23:58.080]  We might have the results saying something on the evening of November 3rd that it will
[23:58.080 --> 24:00.280]  not say the evening of November 10th.
[24:00.280 --> 24:05.920]  My advice to Joe Biden in October campaign this obviously is do not concede under any
[24:05.920 --> 24:14.520]  circumstances because I believe the other side is going to cheat and sneak and try to
[24:14.520 --> 24:15.520]  do everything that comes.
[24:15.520 --> 24:18.840]  He says if he loses he's not going to leave if he loses.
[24:18.840 --> 24:23.960]  The fact is whether he knows it yet or not he will be leaving.
[24:23.960 --> 24:27.600]  Just because he might not want to move out of the White House doesn't mean we won't have
[24:27.600 --> 24:33.640]  an inauguration ceremony to inaugurate a duly elected president of the United States.
[24:33.640 --> 24:35.080]  But there is a process.
[24:35.080 --> 24:39.400]  It has nothing to do with that the certain occupant of the White House doesn't feel like
[24:39.400 --> 24:45.360]  moving and has to be fumigated out of there because the presidency is the presidency.
[24:45.360 --> 24:48.800]  It's not geography or location.
[24:48.800 --> 24:51.280]  This president is going to try to steal this election.
[24:51.280 --> 24:55.400]  This is the guy who said that all mail-in ballots are fraudulent.
[24:55.400 --> 24:59.640]  Have you ever considered what would happen if the election result came out as you being
[24:59.640 --> 25:02.280]  the winner and Trump refused to leave.
[25:02.280 --> 25:03.280]  Yes I have.
[25:03.280 --> 25:04.280]  I was so damn proud.
[25:04.280 --> 25:10.320]  Here you have four chiefs of staff coming out and ripping the skin off of Trump.
[25:10.320 --> 25:17.000]  And you have so many rank and file military personnel saying whoa we're not a military
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  state this is not who we are.
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.640]  I promise you I'm absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House and with
[25:23.640 --> 25:24.640]  great dispatch.
[25:24.640 --> 25:30.280]  It has been suggested that this is a trial run of the president of the United States
[25:30.280 --> 25:39.200]  who may be organizing to not accept what happens when we have the election if he's not elected.
[25:39.200 --> 25:42.720]  Is he going to pull out his military.
[25:42.720 --> 25:44.360]  Is he going to engage us.
[25:44.360 --> 25:50.000]  He is already alluded to there may be a civil war if he's not reelected.
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.440]  This is dangerous.
[25:51.440 --> 25:57.920]  We are trying to find out more about it and sadly the domestic enemies to our voting system
[25:57.920 --> 26:03.960]  and our honoring our Constitution are right at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[26:03.960 --> 26:09.400]  It's really actually shameful enemies of the state without exaggeration.
[26:09.400 --> 26:13.880]  President Trump's counterintelligence vulnerabilities are exponentially greater than any president
[26:13.880 --> 26:14.880]  in modern history.
[26:14.880 --> 26:17.560]  So do you think the president is a national security threat.
[26:17.560 --> 26:18.560]  I do.
[26:18.560 --> 26:22.240]  The administration's president has demonstrated that they have a capacity to go lower than
[26:22.240 --> 26:24.600]  we can even possibly imagine.
[26:24.600 --> 26:27.560]  So yeah I think we have to be concerned about that.
[26:27.560 --> 26:32.320]  His attempt to talk about mail and voting and all the fraud that is associated with
[26:32.320 --> 26:34.080]  it is factually incorrect.
[26:34.080 --> 26:39.720]  He's just trying to set up a situation where he has the ability to delegitimize a vote that
[26:39.720 --> 26:41.240]  he might lose.
[26:41.240 --> 26:45.920]  If he loses and I expect that he will then we have to be prepared for what he is going
[26:45.920 --> 26:50.240]  to do in the immediate aftermath of such a loss and what he'll do for the time period
[26:50.240 --> 26:54.760]  between the election and the inauguration of the next president.
[26:54.760 --> 26:58.760]  We have to be prepared for things that this nation has never faced before.
[26:58.760 --> 27:05.040]  I think that this is important because there is unfortunately I think a heightened risk
[27:05.040 --> 27:15.560]  of civil unrest in the period between voting and a result being called or after that.
[27:15.560 --> 27:19.520]  And I just think that we need to be doing everything that we can to reduce the chances
[27:19.520 --> 27:23.120]  of violence or civil unrest in the wake of this election.
[27:23.120 --> 27:30.440]  If you think things cannot possibly get worse trust me they can and they will if we don't
[27:30.440 --> 27:32.840]  make a change in this election.
[27:32.840 --> 27:41.360]  And if we don't meet this moment we will continue to have these persistent injustices in our
[27:41.360 --> 27:49.040]  communities and we will continue to have unrest in our streets because there has been unrest
[27:49.040 --> 27:50.040]  in people's lives.
[27:50.040 --> 27:56.320]  Today we are lifting up these stories in the hopes that you will see the lights and if
[27:56.320 --> 28:00.440]  you don't we will bring the fire.
[28:00.440 --> 28:06.200]  This is a movement I'm telling you they're not going to stop and everyone beware because
[28:06.200 --> 28:09.440]  they're not going to stop it is going to they're not going to stop before election
[28:09.440 --> 28:12.880]  day in November and they're not going to stop after election day.
[28:12.880 --> 28:17.240]  And that should be everyone should take note of that on both levels that this isn't they're
[28:17.240 --> 28:20.440]  not going to let up and they should not and we should not.
[28:20.440 --> 28:25.960]  And yeah I am radical I do believe that we need to get radical about what we are doing
[28:25.960 --> 28:26.960]  and take it seriously.
[28:26.960 --> 28:32.680]  I'm looking to the public you know this is as much about public outcry and organizing
[28:32.680 --> 28:38.120]  and mobilizing and applying pressure so that this GOP led senate and that these governors
[28:38.120 --> 28:44.960]  that continue to carry water for this administration putting the American peoples in harm's way
[28:44.960 --> 28:52.680]  turning a deaf ear to the needs of our families and our communities hold them accountable.
[28:52.680 --> 28:55.360]  Make the phone calls, send the e-mail, show up.
[28:55.360 --> 28:58.360]  You know there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there is unrest.
[28:58.360 --> 29:01.360]  CNN and the rest of the corporate media are running with the false headline that Trump
[29:01.360 --> 29:03.760]  is surrendered to the coronavirus.
[29:03.760 --> 29:09.240]  It's the opposite he's not surrendering to the endless drumbeat of fear and false science
[29:09.240 --> 29:13.880]  that it's incredibly deadly and that we have a chance of eradicating it.
[29:13.880 --> 29:19.200]  Bill Gates Fauci and the UN have said we will always wear masks we will never shake hands
[29:19.200 --> 29:25.480]  and even the vaccines won't protect us forever and so that civilization as we know is over
[29:25.480 --> 29:31.800]  until every coronavirus in the world is eradicated that's impossible.
[29:31.800 --> 29:35.600]  That's right they're trying to say they have never cured to the common cold that's what
[29:35.600 --> 29:39.640]  COVID-19 false positives for on the test.
[29:39.640 --> 29:44.240]  They created a problem that can never be defeated but of course they're the ones in charge of
[29:44.240 --> 29:50.000]  the problem and so they stay in power forever and take control of society with contact tracers
[29:50.000 --> 29:55.080]  and outgoing with the police to people's doors in Texas at gunpoint and taking force
[29:55.080 --> 29:59.320]  samples we must say no.
[29:59.320 --> 30:03.640]  Something huge has happened in the last two weeks remember when Hunter Biden's laptop
[30:03.640 --> 30:11.600]  first broke and all of Big Tech in concert from Twitter to Facebook to YouTube, Google
[30:11.600 --> 30:16.520]  all worked to block it they didn't deny that it was real they just wouldn't let anybody
[30:16.520 --> 30:22.760]  even talk about the story or link to major newspapers or even the House and Senate committees
[30:22.760 --> 30:24.040]  that were looking at it.
[30:24.040 --> 30:30.040]  Well now fast forward as the fire hose of information comes out and more tapes get released to more
[30:30.040 --> 30:34.480]  audio with Hunter admitting he was a communist Chinese agent we're not trying to censor
[30:34.480 --> 30:35.480]  anymore.
[30:35.480 --> 30:40.040]  Not because they're good people but because this cryzan effect boomeranged on their traitorous
[30:40.040 --> 30:44.760]  butts last time just a few weeks ago and so now they know they're trying to suppress
[30:44.760 --> 30:49.640]  it only makes it bigger just like they've done with Info Wars in Band-Aut video it's
[30:49.640 --> 30:50.640]  truly amazing.
[30:50.640 --> 30:54.920]  Keep telling the truth the Lord works mysterious ways amazing things are happening and these
[30:54.920 --> 30:58.520]  communist Chinese agents are going to pay.
[30:58.520 --> 31:03.920]  There are many references in the holy Bible to the mustard seed and why is that?
[31:03.920 --> 31:08.520]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there but a giant tree like bush grows from it that
[31:08.520 --> 31:12.040]  produces more mustard seeds.
[31:12.040 --> 31:16.200]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects they
[31:16.200 --> 31:17.200]  didn't know why.
[31:17.200 --> 31:23.800]  Well with modern science we know it's one of the purest cleanest organic forms of selenium.

[31:57.920 --> 32:04.640]  In January and February of the year 2020 the communist super state China working through
[32:04.640 --> 32:10.320]  the United Nations told the world how we are now supposed to live our lives after COVID
[32:10.320 --> 32:16.440]  permanent social distancing permanent mask apps to track everywhere we go and what we
[32:16.440 --> 32:22.120]  do contact tracers coming to our doors with the police and dragging us away.
[32:22.120 --> 32:27.880]  This is the authoritarian medical tyranny takeover and it's never going to end until
[32:27.880 --> 32:30.480]  we start standing up and saying no.
[32:30.480 --> 32:36.080]  Already Fauci and the WHO and the communist Chinese are all over the news saying the lockdowns
[32:36.080 --> 32:38.080]  are permanent.
[32:38.080 --> 32:43.560]  Bill Gates said at least 10 years last week until restrictions are raised by then we'll
[32:43.560 --> 32:49.360]  all be totally and completely trained to live under slavery and it will never end.
[32:49.360 --> 32:55.080]  This is the authoritarian takeover everyone must resist everyone must speak up everyone
[32:55.080 --> 33:24.080]  must say no now you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:24.080 --> 33:29.720]  info wars tomorrow's news today.
[33:29.720 --> 33:33.960]  President Trump just confirmed what Rudolph Giuliani has been laying out.
[33:33.960 --> 33:39.240]  They are set to release what we broke two weeks ago evidence of Hunter Biden engaged
[33:39.240 --> 33:44.000]  in sex acts with underage minors and it's all breaking right now.
[33:44.000 --> 33:52.160]  And we have what's called the laptop from hell from what I've understood you only have
[33:52.160 --> 33:58.280]  seen a tiny portion of it but you know what the press is now doing they're blaming Russia
[33:58.280 --> 34:03.880]  it's Russia I did it Russia is the one that created the laptop.
[34:03.880 --> 34:09.800]  I told you there are underage girls there there are I told you there are documents that show
[34:09.800 --> 34:14.560]  that he's getting 10% there are there are documents that show that he's getting half
[34:14.560 --> 34:26.240]  of what Hunter gets there are you can say what you want about Rudolph Giuliani.
[34:26.240 --> 34:32.000]  He was pro war when I wasn't pro war but no one can deny that he is a former respected
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.480]  federal prosecutor that brought down the mob in New York.
[34:35.480 --> 34:41.000]  He is not the steel dossier that the Clintons paid for that was proven to be fake day one
[34:41.000 --> 34:46.800]  and never showed a one real piece of evidence so when Giuliani came out two weeks ago with
[34:46.800 --> 34:52.000]  Chinese dissidents who had seen the laptop and reported that it showed pedophilia showed
[34:52.000 --> 34:57.400]  illegal acts with Hunter Biden and others you knew it was accurate he's never put out
[34:57.400 --> 35:02.800]  defamation like that that would destroy his name forever then the media tried to claim
[35:02.800 --> 35:07.200]  oh it's Russian this info but US intelligence came out and said no it's real from his laptop
[35:07.200 --> 35:09.040]  shop in Delaware.
[35:09.040 --> 35:13.880]  And so now two weeks later they don't deny that the laptop is real they just hope you
[35:13.880 --> 35:18.320]  forget about it but it's not just the laptop at a moment we're going to play the audio
[35:18.320 --> 35:23.040]  that came out over a week ago with no coverage which is confirmed the Bidens haven't denied
[35:23.040 --> 35:28.480]  it of Hunter Biden talking about getting a million bucks from the head of Chinese intelligence
[35:28.480 --> 35:33.360]  he talks about how the southern district of New York is investigating him in a criminal
[35:33.360 --> 35:36.200]  case and how scared he is.
[35:36.200 --> 35:40.520]  All of this is happening and then on top of it national file came out over a week ago
[35:40.520 --> 35:46.920]  they've confirmed this is accurate as well with Joe Biden's daughter talking about sexual
[35:46.920 --> 35:55.640]  abuse and other bizarre behavior drug abuse you name it this is a family of very degenerate
[35:55.640 --> 36:00.800]  insane drug addicts who are clearly mentally ill and that's why they're the perfect group
[36:00.800 --> 36:07.280]  for corrupt organizations in the US and in China to recruit them and control them.
[36:07.280 --> 36:12.080]  So here's what Giuliani said two weeks ago a clip of this is on our video seen more than
[36:12.080 --> 36:17.760]  3.3 million times at Bandai video and then we'll play a large part of the exchange where
[36:17.760 --> 36:23.760]  Giuliani was on with Lisa Kennedy on Fox News last night and she was trying to say again
[36:23.760 --> 36:28.640]  he's like the steel dossier that's been proven to be total fraud well when he's laid out
[36:28.640 --> 36:33.600]  has been proven to be real because the media can't deny this information they can just
[36:33.600 --> 36:39.360]  try to call it disinformation without ever actually addressing it because this information
[36:39.360 --> 36:44.920]  will bring down not just the bides of the entire deep state and when you look at these photographs
[36:44.920 --> 36:50.400]  that are disgusting and horrible the Chinese had every single one of them Chinese have
[36:50.400 --> 36:56.160]  every single one probably 10 times more because what the Chinese government has been doing
[36:56.160 --> 37:02.240]  and a country was totally undefended against this is setting Biden up putting him in a
[37:02.240 --> 37:06.840]  position where he's totally compromised they've now they've now given him so much money he's
[37:06.840 --> 37:13.040]  totally compromised they now have pictures of his son doing things that doing things
[37:13.040 --> 37:17.760]  that I can't describe some of which are illegal and some could say that you were acting like
[37:17.760 --> 37:23.240]  Christopher Steele that you were abstracting information and because you gotta be kidding
[37:23.240 --> 37:27.120]  me I was acting I was acting like Christopher Steele that's what it sounds like when you
[37:27.120 --> 37:32.160]  look at the people you better you better apologize for that I mean I've been I've been a United
[37:32.160 --> 37:36.200]  States attorney associate attorney general mayor of New York City and a member of the
[37:36.200 --> 37:40.200]  ball for 50 years I've never been accused of anything and you're accusing me of being
[37:40.200 --> 37:45.960]  Christopher Steele I'm accusing you of acting in a capacity similar to Christopher Steele
[37:45.960 --> 37:53.040]  and that similar to a clock back and forth between you and the United States is an
[37:53.040 --> 38:01.960]  outrageous defamation of me of my reputation every single thing is here and I want you
[38:01.960 --> 38:08.920]  to look at it and then you apologize to me well you can you can you can come to my office
[38:08.920 --> 38:12.920]  and you can look at it and tomorrow night you can apologize to me for saying I'm like
[38:12.920 --> 38:18.400]  Christopher Steele I told you there are underage girls there there are I told you there are
[38:18.400 --> 38:24.120]  documents that show that he's getting 10% there are there are documents that show that
[38:24.120 --> 38:29.440]  he's getting half of what Hunter gets there are and when they're there I want you to apologize
[38:29.440 --> 38:34.120]  to me okay because you just to me absolutely that's outrageous because you have no basis
[38:34.120 --> 38:39.400]  for that I came on your show in good faith to give you evidence that is being withheld
[38:39.400 --> 38:45.560]  from the American people and I get defamed that's outrageous we are only a few days away
[38:45.560 --> 38:50.080]  from the election and my White House sources as well as Fox News sources tell me that by
[38:50.080 --> 38:56.560]  tomorrow more information is about to break concerning the Hunter Biden laptop that dwarfs
[38:56.560 --> 39:02.640]  anything that's been released so far and we have what's called the laptop from hell
[39:02.640 --> 39:09.880]  the laptop from hell from what I've understood you only have seen a tiny portion of it also
[39:09.880 --> 39:15.080]  breaking James Rosen of Sinclair Broadcasting is now reporting that a criminal investigation
[39:15.080 --> 39:20.200]  by the FBI has officially been opened into the Biden crime family a Justice Department
[39:20.200 --> 39:25.760]  official confirmed to Sinclair that back in 2019 the FBI opened up a criminal investigation
[39:25.760 --> 39:30.080]  into Hunter Biden and his associates that is focused on allegations of money laundering
[39:30.080 --> 39:36.080]  and remains open and active today we're about to play audio of Hunter Biden talking about
[39:36.080 --> 39:41.280]  working with the head of Chinese intelligence and now emails have been confirmed to be his
[39:41.280 --> 39:46.120]  where he gives wiring instructions to the chai com spy chief on where to send the money
[39:46.120 --> 39:50.560]  ladies and gentlemen history is happening right now and this entire house of criminal
[39:50.560 --> 39:57.920]  cards is coming down I get calls from my father to tell me that the New York Times is calling
[39:57.920 --> 40:02.680]  but my old partner Eric who literally has done me harm for I don't know how long is
[40:02.680 --> 40:08.680]  the one taking the calls because my father will not stop sending the calls to Eric I
[40:08.680 --> 40:15.680]  have another New York Times reporter calling about my representation of the literally Dr.
[40:15.680 --> 40:25.960]  Patrick Oh the spy chief of China who started the company that my partner who was worth
[40:25.960 --> 40:34.320]  three hundred and twenty three billion dollars found it is now missing the richest man in
[40:34.320 --> 40:40.320]  the world is missing who was my partner he was missing since I last saw him in his fifty
[40:40.320 --> 40:46.200]  eight million dollar apartment and signed a four billion dollar deal to be built the
[40:46.200 --> 40:56.560]  largest LNG court in the world and I am receiving calls from the Southern District of New York
[40:56.560 --> 41:03.040]  from the US Attorney himself my best friend in business has named me as a witness without
[41:03.040 --> 41:12.000]  telling me in a criminal case and my father without telling me we're only four days out
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.600]  for the most historic election in world history and to see big tech attempting to censor this
[41:16.600 --> 41:22.360]  information is absolutely damning evidence that they are colluding with and working with
[41:22.360 --> 41:26.560]  not just the traders in our government the bureaucracy but the communist Chinese themselves
[41:26.560 --> 41:31.200]  but we the American people understood what's happening when the censorship intensified
[41:31.200 --> 41:36.600]  three years ago and we set up organizations like ban dot video where this report and others
[41:36.600 --> 41:41.320]  are hosted so you can share it on your email share it on your instant message and share

[42:32.960 --> 42:37.880]  mustard was known by the ancients around the world have amazing health effects they didn't

[43:14.880 --> 43:18.160]  and I know God's real and I've experienced it in my life believe you don't believe in
[43:18.160 --> 43:22.840]  God it's important to recognize that there is good in this world there is evil and there
[43:22.840 --> 43:27.560]  are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing bad and what I see
[43:27.560 --> 43:33.560]  happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally get that
[43:33.560 --> 43:39.280]  they finally understand that they're not being naive anymore don't ever project your decency
[43:39.280 --> 43:43.880]  and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what they stand for and who
[43:43.880 --> 43:47.480]  they are where you're going to get hurt but those of you out there have done your own

[44:10.760 --> 44:14.920]  trying to hold up civilization and power the people and once the establishment has that
[44:14.920 --> 44:19.400]  predatory idea civilization collapses very very quickly you can't treat the least of
[44:19.400 --> 44:24.920]  us like garbage and not treat your own family like that and so it is this lack of empathy
[44:24.920 --> 44:29.640]  that's going to destroy us the globalists can try to be heartless devil or spurs that
[44:29.640 --> 44:35.240]  commit rituals of all sorts of horrible crime try to get away from a humanity but really
[44:35.240 --> 44:39.320]  they can't escape the laws of the universe they may train themselves to commit heinous
[44:39.320 --> 44:44.600]  crimes and not feel it themselves but the repercussions of what they commit always comes

[46:16.680 --> 46:21.960]  jobs and transfer them to china and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt
[46:21.960 --> 46:26.120]  well now china owns the debt now china owns hollywood all the one side of trading deals
[46:26.760 --> 46:32.440]  it turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on but again it wasn't that hard the cfr and others
[46:32.440 --> 46:38.200]  admitted what they were doing but still others didn't want to focus on that issue we did and you
[46:38.200 --> 46:43.560]  focused on it by supporting us at info wars so when you go to infowarstore.com and get all the
[46:43.560 --> 46:48.440]  great supplements books t-shirts films water filtration air filtration all of it you're
[46:48.440 --> 46:52.680]  funding the organization that literally helped make up the world what's really happening so
[46:52.680 --> 46:55.560]  that's a big accomplishment for all of you i want to thank you for your support
[46:55.560 --> 47:04.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:04.040 --> 47:28.520]  the alex jones show because there is a war on
[47:34.280 --> 47:44.680]  treason has a sound it has a sound here it is
[47:47.160 --> 47:54.040]  but we are ready i feel very confident that your biden will be elected president on tuesday
[47:55.000 --> 48:02.440]  whatever the end count is but on the election that occurs on tuesday he will be elected on
[48:02.440 --> 48:06.360]  january 20th he will be inaugurated president of the united states
[48:09.080 --> 48:16.760]  you know we can unpack that for the whole show and we will be but let's just think about if you're
[48:16.760 --> 48:21.240]  a tv viewer what you saw there you've not seen Pelosi give a speech in a mass caveat
[48:22.840 --> 48:28.200]  and suddenly if you watch the weather channel or cnn or msnbc or any channel
[48:28.200 --> 48:34.120]  now even on comedy central this morning i was flipping through the channels
[48:34.120 --> 48:38.200]  they had a host on there skyping into a show zooming into a show i don't know which one
[48:38.760 --> 48:45.800]  wearing a mask remember what the un said you should wear a mask in your house you should
[48:45.800 --> 48:51.320]  wear a mask when you have sex don't look at someone in the eyes that could transmit the virus
[48:51.320 --> 48:59.720]  i'm not joking england says don't look at someone so now don limon is wearing his mask on tv
[49:01.880 --> 49:06.360]  so they're like okay the public caught Pelosi going to the barber going to the salon
[49:06.360 --> 49:08.840]  and they caught all the other democrats not wearing their mask what do we do well to make
[49:08.840 --> 49:14.120]  them look really scared we tell them hospitals are full again we told them there's record numbers
[49:14.120 --> 49:21.000]  of cases though it's not record numbers of death and we scare them again and they've got all these
[49:21.000 --> 49:27.240]  democrats dressed up like grim reapers all over the country in texas and in new york and in michigan
[49:27.240 --> 49:32.840]  and in colorada and in florida it's all over the news like people like i'm the grim reaper
[49:32.840 --> 49:38.680]  covid thanks for not wearing your mask i'm gonna kill you because they know
[49:40.280 --> 49:47.320]  that people don't know science 220 000 dead most of them died of flu cold car wrecks gun shots
[49:47.320 --> 49:51.000]  they've already run their scam they've been caught and they're going to do it again now
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.160]  the winners here that's what they say oh about january they'll be triple the daily deaths there
[49:55.160 --> 49:59.160]  is now well of course because you'll call every it's in the headline suddenly no one's dying of
[49:59.160 --> 50:07.160]  flu worldwide because they add flu in the column now we broke that eight months ago this is criminal
[50:07.160 --> 50:13.400]  organized fraud so now whether it's the weather channel you name it i'm here for the hurricane
[50:13.400 --> 50:17.640]  where am i inside my truck but i'm wearing my mask because i'm a virgin singer because the
[50:17.640 --> 50:25.320]  executives are telling them not only do you go out and stay in the wind when it's not as fast as
[50:25.320 --> 50:28.840]  they claim it is and act like you're being blown away people walk by normally right besides you
[50:28.840 --> 50:38.120]  showing it's a hoax but you also wear your little mask because you're good and we're bad and what
[50:38.120 --> 50:43.720]  does that mean the same mask wears will take the force inoculation the same mask wears will
[50:43.720 --> 50:49.000]  handle the contact tracing the same mask wears will submit and i predicted michigan would be the
[50:49.000 --> 50:54.120]  first state because i i saw whitmer being protected i started being lifted up i started making outrageous
[50:54.120 --> 51:00.600]  claims and now the michigan universities are all announcing you'll have a phone issued by the
[51:00.600 --> 51:05.320]  university you pay for if you leave the campus in a semester you'll be expelled everything you do is
[51:05.320 --> 51:09.240]  being tracked you can only buy food at certain facilities that are approved by them that's the
[51:09.240 --> 51:15.000]  real model the real gold and now whitmer's saying to go to restaurants you must give your name and
[51:15.000 --> 51:20.440]  number and have a cell phone that's scanned to get into them of course you can see all that already
[51:20.440 --> 51:24.920]  happening this is a global plan it's already in australia it's already in spain it's already in the
[51:24.920 --> 51:32.600]  uk and now it's here how cool it is to wear a mask over your face because you're dirty and you're
[51:32.600 --> 51:39.320]  bad and you're a biohazard you're bad for the earth you're a bad species you're evil and what
[51:39.320 --> 51:44.600]  comes out of you is bad and we got to put a muzzle on you talk about cult programming
[51:47.320 --> 51:51.080]  so every store i go in now i'm not wearing the mask and i have a discussion with the manager
[51:51.720 --> 51:56.520]  and i explain it to them and they agree with me but say sir though i'll get fired well you know
[51:56.520 --> 52:00.520]  you're gonna get a lot more than fired if you keep going along with all of this
[52:00.520 --> 52:05.960]  so here's the bottom line if you go to info wars.com we just showed you that incredible
[52:05.960 --> 52:10.840]  report the last report we put out along those same lines two weeks ago got 3.5 million views
[52:10.840 --> 52:14.920]  and had a big effect and they had national news stories about it totally upset and totally angry
[52:14.920 --> 52:21.320]  that we still have a platform that that that circumvents them but if you go to info wars.com
[52:21.320 --> 52:32.040]  or band.video there's the headline devastating juliani confirms child porn pedophilia on

[52:42.120 --> 52:48.440]  psychological virus but i've talked to all the folks that have seen it i don't i'm not looking
[52:48.440 --> 52:52.520]  at it my crew is not looking at it i've told them don't look at it because it could be a crime to
[52:52.520 --> 52:57.000]  even look at it but we've talked to the people that have seen it the FBI confirms they've got it
[52:57.000 --> 53:01.720]  they did have it hunter biden is under criminal investigation for china deals and for barisma

[59:45.080 --> 59:54.040]  night dot news and share now you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:07.800]  welcome back i'm your host alex jones so before tucker carlson announced it i told you a few days
[1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:12.040]  ago that not just tucker carlson reportedly but others that were having their mail broken into
[1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:16.840]  their phones listened to stuff stolen and i can tell you that's been happening a lot of other people
[1:00:16.840 --> 1:00:20.680]  but because of security reasons we don't want to talk about what people have been able to do
[1:00:20.680 --> 1:00:27.160]  successfully because that gives them targeting uh information but uh well let's just say it's
[1:00:27.160 --> 1:00:33.400]  been going on but suddenly ups after the media made fun of tucker carlson saying their mail was
[1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:39.400]  being robbed the people were spying on their mail suddenly the information was confirmed because
[1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:43.000]  they could go back to their cameras and find out who actually did steal it so they got the
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:48.280]  information back here at us last night we told you about a pretty weird experience we had this
[1:00:48.280 --> 1:00:52.520]  week on monday one of our producers in new york overnighted a package to our executive producer
[1:00:52.520 --> 1:00:57.000]  justin welles and to me in los angeles we were there preparing for an interview with the former
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:01.880]  biden family business partner called tony babelinsky somewhere along the way the contents of that
[1:01:01.880 --> 1:01:06.600]  package disappeared inside it was a flash drive that contained primary documents pertaining to the
[1:01:06.600 --> 1:01:11.080]  biden family we should tell you those documents did not come from tony babelinsky and of course
[1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:15.160]  we made a copy of those files before we sent them because we're careful we got a lot of
[1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:19.880]  documents from a lot of different sources all the time but that's especially true in election years
[1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:24.040]  and before we put them on the air we have to determine first whether they're real these were real
[1:01:24.040 --> 1:01:28.760]  whether they're newsworthy and whether it's legal to show them we wanted to assess what we had and
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:33.960]  we're still assessing it but the point is the package never arrived proprietary reporting on the
[1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:39.960]  biden family documents sent between journalists by supposedly secure overnight mail disappeared
[1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:43.560]  and they vanished on the same day we were conducting a heavily publicized interview based
[1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:48.040]  in part on documents from the biden family so as you can imagine we wanted to know what happened
[1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:52.920]  unfortunately we still don't know what happened this morning ups issued a press release announcing
[1:01:52.920 --> 1:01:57.720]  they had found our flash drive and then boasting about their customer service quote ups will always
[1:01:57.720 --> 1:02:03.480]  focus first on our customers and will never stop working to solve issues which is fine ups is a
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:08.200]  reliable company they rarely lose anything we agree with that that's why we use them in the first
[1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:15.080]  place and yet they lost our biden documents how ups won't tell us how we spent a lot of the day
[1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:18.920]  talking to executives there they claimed that the flash drive was found on monday night by an
[1:02:18.920 --> 1:02:23.800]  hourly employee at the ups building on 43rd street in manhattan they suggested it might have been
[1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:29.800]  sitting on the floor there they couldn't prove that because remarkably in a room where millions of
[1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:35.720]  high value packages are handled there are no security cameras that's what they told us ups says
[1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:40.360]  the employee who found our flash drive simply dropped it on top of a supervisor's desk our
[1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:45.000]  documents sat there undiscovered for more than 24 hours until we announced on television that they
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:50.760]  were missing that's their story obviously we had some questions about it but ups executives did not
[1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:56.120]  answer our questions quote they're no more details security is returning it apologies again that we
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:03:00.840]  were unable to deliver it next day at the service level you requested our exchanges went on like
[1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:06.520]  this for hours and the main question we had never changed how did our flash drive get separated from
[1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:11.800]  the package that we sent it in that seemed like something worth knowing the envelope was securely
[1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:16.760]  sealed we know that two witnesses saw our producer seal it and ups does not dispute that was the
[1:03:16.760 --> 1:03:22.360]  package torn open accidentally by a machine that seems unlikely ups says that almost never happens
[1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:27.480]  so we're left with the obvious explanation someone for some reason opened our package
[1:03:27.480 --> 1:03:32.520]  and removed a flash drive containing documents that were damaging to the biden family we'd
[1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:37.400]  love to know who would do that and why it would be helpful to see the envelope itself but ups
[1:03:37.400 --> 1:03:42.840]  says we can't see it because they threw it away so here we are we got our flash drive back today
[1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:48.680]  and that's great but we'd really like are some answers and speaking of answers it occurs as
[1:03:48.680 --> 1:03:54.360]  reading this that we mentioned the documents that we get from a lot of people and we've received
[1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:59.240]  an awful lot of documents recently about hunter biden we haven't aired all of them in fact many
[1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:05.240]  we have not aired the ones that are pertinent to his business career abroad favors he did
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:09.720]  on behalf of foreign clients with the help of his father that seems relevant and it seems like
[1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:13.880]  news and we brought it to you and we were not ashamed of that but there are a lot of documents
[1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:17.800]  about hunter biden's personal life that we haven't brought to you and we're not going to and we
[1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:22.200]  should tell you why one is the obvious answer he's not running for president and so to the
[1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:28.680]  extent those documents pertain to his dad of course but hunter biden is a fallen man at this
[1:04:28.680 --> 1:04:32.680]  point and i should also say that i knew hunter biden fairly well we live near each other in
[1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:36.520]  washington for quite some time i knew his wife who was an absolutely outstanding person a good
[1:04:36.520 --> 1:04:41.320]  person i never thought hunter biden was a bad person i thought he had demons but in the time
[1:04:41.320 --> 1:04:45.240]  i knew him he kept them mostly under control at some point he lost control of those demons and
[1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:50.120]  the world knows that now he's now humiliated and alone it's probably too strong to say we feel sorry
[1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:56.920]  for hunter biden but the point is pounding on a man jumping on piling on the miraculous properties
[1:04:56.920 --> 1:05:02.920]  of tumeric have been admired even worshiped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations
[1:05:02.920 --> 1:05:09.160]  but with modern science we know why tumeric is so popular it's antioxidant effect it's anti
[1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:16.040]  anti-inflammatory effect everything it does is simply amazing and most tumerics out there
[1:05:16.040 --> 1:05:22.760]  are simply food products they're three to five percent curcuminoid but we have body's ultimate
[1:05:22.760 --> 1:05:30.360]  tumeric formula with a 95 percent curcuminoid level and we have other organic products in there
[1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:34.760]  that accelerated and bringing into the cells of the body it's been sold out for months it's back
[1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:42.200]  in stock and despite that body's ultimate tumeric formula at infowarstore.com is 50 off with free
[1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:48.920]  shipping and triple patreon points at infowarstore.com it's body's ultimate tumeric formula if you
[1:05:48.920 --> 1:05:54.200]  haven't tried it learn why it's got thousands of five star reviews at infowarstore.com and you
[1:05:54.200 --> 1:06:06.040]  can't lose it funds the info war big brother mainstream media government coverups you want
[1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:14.680]  to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[1:06:14.680 --> 1:06:28.440]  but we are ready i feel very confident that joe biden will be elected president on tuesday
[1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:36.840]  whatever the end count is but on the election that occurs on tuesday he will be elected on
[1:06:36.840 --> 1:06:45.560]  january 20th he will be inaugurated president of the united states we're gonna be here election night
[1:06:45.560 --> 1:06:49.480]  at election night.news that's the new url that big tech's having trouble censoring
[1:06:51.880 --> 1:06:56.760]  and i'm gonna be here with a raft of incredible co-host and surprises that you're not gonna
[1:06:56.760 --> 1:07:01.000]  want to miss believing it's gonna be big tuesday night we'll be here monday night the lead-up
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:06.600]  we'll be here the next day i hope trump wins in such a giant landslide that it's self-evident and
[1:07:06.600 --> 1:07:10.600]  they don't claim others all these uncounted ballots and they have democrat judges say
[1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:15.320]  keep it open but they're already doing that and they've said they're not gonna accept the results
[1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:20.200]  and when they don't accept the results even though it's clear trump's gonna win if he wins and i
[1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:27.800]  think he will their activists have been primed and ready to burn down cities the democrats control
[1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:31.880]  because the police have been ordered to stand down like we just saw in philadelphia
[1:07:31.880 --> 1:07:39.880]  and all over california michigan other areas new york they're handing out the local cities are
[1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:44.840]  plywood saying board up your businesses for what's going to happen tuesday night
[1:07:44.840 --> 1:07:48.760]  and all the gangs and criminals are online i have articles right here that i've talked to
[1:07:48.760 --> 1:07:54.440]  law enforcement they've confirmed it that all 50 states the gangs and criminal groups like devils
[1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:58.440]  night they used to have in detroit they kind of drove business out of detroit starting in the 70s
[1:07:58.440 --> 1:08:05.320]  and 80s where criminals would go out and car jack murder rob arson on the same night
[1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:08.120]  halloween
[1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:15.880]  so that police couldn't respond and that's kind of the same globalist program is undermine the
[1:08:15.880 --> 1:08:23.960]  pillars of the city undermine society and bring things down so i had some guest schedule today
[1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:33.960]  but i've canceled them we do have a lot of other information to cover nick maggots of course
[1:08:33.960 --> 1:08:37.960]  will be co-hosting in the fourth hour robert barnes is popping in constitutional lawyer
[1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:43.240]  to give his take on things but i did cancel some guests that we're gonna be on right now
[1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:49.480]  so we can take your phone calls and i want to say first time callers here i'd love to hear from you
[1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:54.680]  specifically on polosi saying we don't care what the election results are he's going to be
[1:08:55.800 --> 1:09:01.640]  inaugurated she said that months ago we played that clip that's what she's saying that's what she's
[1:09:01.640 --> 1:09:08.680]  doing and what you make of all this and then the intensified censorship where even the email
[1:09:08.680 --> 1:09:14.680]  providers and gmail's been caught doing this years ago will go in and block your personal email
[1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:19.640]  that you're sending out to friends and family because they don't agree what's in it and they
[1:09:19.640 --> 1:09:25.400]  say they do that not off complaints from people that'd be bad enough but because they can just
[1:09:25.400 --> 1:09:34.360]  block your email but no off of the contents they quote scan it that means they read it
[1:09:35.240 --> 1:09:40.200]  with a computer for keywords and then flag it for a human to look at it and that's in the news
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:49.480]  and glean and glenn greenwald you know a gay liberal reporter who's won a lot of awards broken a lot
[1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:59.320]  of big news his own editors at the thing he started the intercept would not let him publish an article
[1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:04.760]  about how hunter bodied and see laptops real and by the way the fbi admits they already had it they
[1:10:04.760 --> 1:10:09.160]  admit it's real the campaign people have admitted it's real but say it doesn't matter but then they
[1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:14.280]  go in the news and say oh it's russian this info but don't show proof greenwald wrote a huge article
[1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:18.360]  he finally published yesterday that they wouldn't publish fact let's play another tucker carlsson
[1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:29.720]  clip here in a moment think about that and they said oh you're just being a baby resigning oh a
[1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:36.600]  baby i wouldn't read the article he wrote beautifully done describing every aspect of how it's real
[1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:40.680]  why it's real the proof of it the admissions the witnesses that have come forward that have
[1:10:40.680 --> 1:10:45.720]  the other end of the emails all the other iPhones that have now come out the recordings of him this
[1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:51.160]  is all confirmed i mean this is devastating stuff but no one is allowed to cover it why do they not
[1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:57.080]  want me on joe rogan show why are they boycotting net now because i talked about the laptop and i
[1:10:57.080 --> 1:11:04.120]  talked about vaccines damaging people which is a fact it's absolutely shameful so i want to take
[1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:09.480]  your calls on the internet kill switch they've already put in place that selectively censors
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:13.560]  conservatives and nationalists and patriots and the congress is too dumb to even figure that out
[1:11:13.560 --> 1:11:17.640]  they're finally ready for antitrust investigations they've already launched those that finally they
[1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:23.080]  get there being lied to but it's beyond censorship it's surveillance of everybody to censor them
[1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:27.880]  and big tech working in concert for foreign powers against the interest of the united states and the
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:34.680]  american people and against our a very election system and the very integrity of our existence and
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:38.840]  then saying those of us that want our country back and love what made us great and are loyal
[1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:45.240]  that we are a bad person it should be censored and now a gay liberal can't do an article about
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:51.080]  how the laptop's real when it's been real since day one state police have confirmed it yet the eyes
[1:11:51.080 --> 1:11:56.680]  confirmed it but the left just puts out talking points they haven't and some weak minds even buy
[1:11:56.680 --> 1:12:02.360]  into it it's absolutely shameful here's part of dinner curls and talking to mr greenwald
[1:12:03.400 --> 1:12:08.760]  the intercept you live outside our country which is one of the reasons i think you say what you
[1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:14.680]  think is true tell us what this portends for the future here in the united states
[1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:22.840]  so the intercept was actually for a while a unique publication and and and i think the
[1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:28.040]  vision i just described is one reason but another was that it was intended above all else to be
[1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:33.160]  highly skeptical of the claims of intelligence agencies at the time when we were doing the
[1:12:33.160 --> 1:12:38.920]  reporting the attacks were coming from the nsa the cia the deep state against me against my source
[1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:43.320]  edward so did against the reporting and we knew they were lying constantly ending disseminating
[1:12:43.320 --> 1:12:47.320]  propaganda in a very powerful way so we set out to say we're going to investigate them we're going
[1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:52.600]  to be skeptical of them we're going to subject their assertions to critical scrutiny and i am
[1:12:52.600 --> 1:12:57.640]  so embarrassed and angered that the media outlet that i created along with two other excellent
[1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:02.440]  journalists to do that the only article it published about all of these documents that have
[1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:06.680]  emerged about joe biden other than a column of mine where i denounced facebook and twitter for
[1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:11.800]  censoring it was an article that made reference in passing to those documents very snidely and
[1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:16.680]  dismissively to say that no one should pay attention to it because it was russian disinformation and
[1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:22.600]  it cited a letter from john brennan james clapper mike hayden and the rest of the goons from the cia
[1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:27.480]  and the intelligence community asserting it and we're still that letter said we have no evidence
[1:13:27.480 --> 1:13:32.600]  that russia's involved in any of this the intercept omitted that phrase simply cited that letter to
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:37.640]  try and encourage people to ignore this evidence on the grounds that russia had manufactured it and
[1:13:37.640 --> 1:13:42.280]  that the evidence was fabricated even though there's never been any evidence for that that that's
[1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:47.080]  been true and everything since has disproven it showing russia was not involved in any of this
[1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:51.800]  and nobody certainly not even joe biden disputes that these emails are and other text messages
[1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:58.360]  are completely real and authentic it's horrifying so what you're watching is agencies of the u.s
[1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:03.480]  government turning their awesome and unconstrained powers against the american population
[1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:12.600]  this is the real story of the last four years of the trump administration which is that for a
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:17.400]  long time on the lap there was a healthy skepticism of the cia there was a lot of anti-war activism
[1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:21.640]  in the bush and chain of years um that has all disappeared and the reason it's disappeared is
[1:14:21.640 --> 1:14:26.600]  because the cia from the very first days of the trump administration even before he was inaugurated
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:31.160]  devoted themselves to sabotaging the administration because donald trump questioned just a few of
[1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:35.880]  their pieties and that can't be done in washington whoever does that must be destroyed and so the
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:41.720]  cia and the deep state operatives became heroes of the liberal and again these are rogue elements
[1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:45.880]  working with china these are not real cia agencies these are not real fbi agencies these are traders
[1:14:46.600 --> 1:14:51.000]  that took control of our government and are now fighting a president who's standing up for us and
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:58.280]  doing his job but the good news is it's not just glenn greenwald all these big prominent former
[1:14:58.280 --> 1:15:03.560]  liberals that really meant well are now waking up the fact that their party is a fascistic pro-communist
[1:15:03.560 --> 1:15:08.040]  group of criminals and so whatever happens in this election they're in a lot of trouble here's the
[1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:13.480]  toll free number to join us i want to get into the latest martial law lockdowns now being launched
[1:15:13.480 --> 1:15:18.520]  lockdown two they plan to monkey see monkey do bring it here that's coming up your phone calls

[1:15:54.200 --> 1:16:00.200]  it was in the telecommunications act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your gps
[1:16:00.200 --> 1:16:06.680]  location i read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was unamerican
[1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:12.520]  now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on apple and on droids
[1:16:12.520 --> 1:16:17.800]  don't just track your location but your surfing history where you go who you talk to
[1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:23.000]  your relationships and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:29.720]  as well including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just like siri or alexa do
[1:16:29.720 --> 1:16:35.960]  and then putting databases transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever
[1:16:35.960 --> 1:16:40.040]  your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores
[1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:45.560]  based on information this is the global chinese communist social credit score get your protection
[1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:51.400]  privacy pockets at info war store dot com and cut big brother off dead in his filthy tracks info

[1:16:59.560 --> 1:17:03.480]  and everything that's happening because of you when we built the only truly multimedia independent
[1:17:03.480 --> 1:17:08.360]  radio tv print film organization in the world that promotes the truth against the globalists
[1:17:08.360 --> 1:17:12.760]  we've had a devastating effect we're a national treasure you're a national treasure for supporting
[1:17:12.760 --> 1:17:18.200]  us and so go get a t-shirt go get a historic t-shirt we've got a funny one that's the

[1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:25.960]  gift it's pretty cute here it is and it just you know it's a little historic thing i think
[1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:30.040]  trump's gonna win but if biden's able to steal it we'll be probably shut down pretty quick so
[1:17:30.040 --> 1:17:34.200]  it'll be historic thing to have you'll be able to fight them in the third dimension on the street
[1:17:34.200 --> 1:17:39.000]  with graffiti with handbills you hand out and with non-compliance not paying taxes and
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:43.640]  pulling your kids out of the schools and uh just making it a full-time job to expose and fight and
[1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:48.600]  obstruct the criminal foreign takeover of america we've gotten to that point biden for nursing home

[1:17:52.440 --> 1:18:08.360]  more info or store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:22.280]  you're living history folks make no mistake
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:32.200]  so
[1:18:32.760 --> 1:18:36.360]  all right we're going to your phone calls today seven seven seven eight nine alex
[1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:43.880]  but i just want to say this up front history is happening now this is such an amazing kind
[1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:49.880]  of be alive and we are grassroots we are independent info or started with my idea that
[1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:54.600]  globalism was coming we should prepare we should warn people we should build against it and you've
[1:18:54.600 --> 1:19:01.080]  been so supportive that we put on a major defense with your help together you did this and the
[1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:06.200]  globalists have always sued me and tried to get documents and tried to find out what doesn't exist
[1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:11.080]  where's the secret money where's the secret funding who's behind us because they're all slaves
[1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:17.560]  they all have masters not us we are independent this is organic like everything humans do
[1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:24.200]  it doesn't come from some mystique filled secret group it comes from our genetics our blood our
[1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:32.040]  sweat our tears who we are who our ancestors are and so there was almost no opposition to
[1:19:32.040 --> 1:19:37.320]  world government 20 years ago 30 years ago now it's massive and so the fights just started
[1:19:37.320 --> 1:19:40.840]  and we're winning right up front we're losing as well in some areas but
[1:19:40.840 --> 1:19:45.000]  mark twain said that
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:50.040]  a lie goes halfway around the world before truth puts his pants on that's true
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  he also said the beginning of patriots a scarce man hated fear and scorn and at
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:58.360]  time was cause succeeds and timet joined him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot
[1:19:59.160 --> 1:20:03.240]  and that's totally true when he said it 150 years ago as it is now
[1:20:04.840 --> 1:20:09.560]  and so you're the patriots that were here in the winter you think the storm is here right now
[1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:15.480]  now but it's a spring storm bringing the water of liberty and justice and awakening
[1:20:16.680 --> 1:20:22.360]  that leads us into the summer and the golden age if we accept god's providence and god's gift

[1:20:50.200 --> 1:20:58.840]  uh 2016 and after that i kind of had a real awakening and started listening to you and i'm
[1:20:58.840 --> 1:21:02.840]  actually i had said i wasn't going to vote anymore after the last election but this election i'm
[1:21:02.840 --> 1:21:07.960]  going to go down and vote for trump so well that's beautiful we'll just be clear i was so disillusioned
[1:21:08.520 --> 1:21:14.760]  with the republicans and george w bush and how bad mccain was i was neutral in the 2008 election
[1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:20.600]  i mean i criticized both candidates uh but i i i was but when i with them once obama got in he
[1:21:20.600 --> 1:21:25.720]  was so bad i was like oh my god of course mccain wasn't really running against him he was a place
[1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:30.120]  soldier but absolutely so don't feel bad you voted for hillary just thank god you're awake now
[1:21:30.120 --> 1:21:36.200]  you know that's what i'm saying you know i think we were all fooled by a mama and we thought you
[1:21:36.200 --> 1:21:42.680]  know he was going to make all these changes and and we were all just really let down and and i'm
[1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:47.880]  you know i'm trying to convince my dad you know that this democratic party has changed it's not the
[1:21:47.880 --> 1:21:54.600]  same anymore they're turning socialist and i don't know he still wants to vote for biden i'm like the
[1:21:54.600 --> 1:22:04.600]  guys see now dimension up how do we get through to the people that don't don't see this allison i
[1:22:04.600 --> 1:22:10.120]  hear you so much and i appreciate your call god bless i would just say your dad dad i understand
[1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:15.800]  your identities to vote democrat your identities buy into all this but joe biden is a chinese
[1:22:15.800 --> 1:22:23.640]  communist agent and his son has been busted on their payroll and show him glenn greenwald's reporting
[1:22:23.640 --> 1:22:32.600]  a very respected liberal gay person okay gay man who hates right wingers doesn't like but he has to
[1:22:32.600 --> 1:22:40.120]  tell the truth and he's saying that trump's anti-war trump's pro pro america and joe biden works for
[1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:44.600]  the communist chinese and the laptop's real and the media just can't ignore that and greenwald
[1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:50.600]  understands that the truth is going to come out and people are on the wrong side of history here
[1:22:50.600 --> 1:22:54.600]  that are going against it so i would just try to educate your dad that way okay let's go ahead
[1:22:54.600 --> 1:23:02.600]  take another call here let's go to todd in california todd welcomes her hey alec how's
[1:23:02.600 --> 1:23:07.320]  it going man man i'm just really excited only three and a half days from the election wow i mean
[1:23:07.320 --> 1:23:16.520]  this is an amazing time it really is it's really blowing me away um well basically what my topic
[1:23:16.520 --> 1:23:21.480]  is is that um what i think is going to happen is the chinese communist party when the when the
[1:23:21.480 --> 1:23:26.360]  democrats failed through the election they're going to take all of the evidence they have and
[1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:30.600]  they're going to dump as much of it as they can in order to secure some type of bargaining chip
[1:23:31.320 --> 1:23:36.120]  with the uh with the trade deal that they've already right you show okay what's your background
[1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:41.160]  time that's a very sophisticated thing you said uh what's your background to to know something like
[1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:47.320]  that uh well no i just i've been watching you for about six years now and i noticed things about
[1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:51.880]  people it really shocked people when i that i noticed certain things and i i noticed little
[1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:56.520]  things and you always say it right after i really feel like we have that well let's lay that out
[1:23:56.520 --> 1:23:59.880]  todd what's going to happen is this reason the democrats are so desperate and so dangerous
[1:23:59.880 --> 1:24:04.200]  and will do anything if they don't win this election it won't be the justice department
[1:24:04.200 --> 1:24:08.520]  releasing all this horrible stuff it's me the chai comms who will then try to run up to the
[1:24:08.520 --> 1:24:13.640]  new establishment the united states and help destroy the opposition hoping that will carry
[1:24:13.640 --> 1:24:18.360]  favor with trump which it's not going to do by the way uh but that is exactly how communists
[1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:22.920]  operate the only respect strength and and if the democrats are defeated which i believe they will
[1:24:22.920 --> 1:24:26.440]  be but that's why they're not going to concede because what do they have to lose the longer
[1:24:26.440 --> 1:24:31.480]  they hold on the more they don't get in trouble see so that they're going to not concede they're
[1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:37.320]  going to go crazy i think that's a very easy bet to make dodd absolutely absolutely it's
[1:24:37.320 --> 1:24:42.840]  it's only their asses on the line yeah and here's the other problem they never get in trouble so why
[1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:46.840]  shouldn't they make another run of the country why shouldn't they try to have a race war why
[1:24:46.840 --> 1:24:51.240]  shouldn't they do the fake covet lockdowns it's it's have you seen out on cnn everywhere they're
[1:24:51.240 --> 1:24:56.520]  wearing masks on tv now to scare us like oh don't take your mask off look i wear one on tv i mean
[1:24:56.520 --> 1:25:02.360]  it's it's ridiculous oh they're trying to scare us they really are they're doing everything they can
[1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:06.600]  they've brainwashed too many people dude they're dressed up in grim reaper outfits all over the
[1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:13.800]  country saying oh i'm covered that somebody our old grim reaper outfit got torn up go get me a new
[1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:17.800]  grim reaper outfit i bet they're all sold out but get me a grim reaper outfit i'm gonna go around

[1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:15.480]  to release it that's why trump coming out and saying we cannot quote beat the virus by staying
[1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:20.360]  locked up we have to get herd immunity it's not as deadly as they said it's so important

[1:50:28.680 --> 1:50:35.960]  i thought you said and that's the thing that i spent all my time on if humans get excited about
[1:50:35.960 --> 1:50:41.000]  the independent media and share it until others to share it and it causes the domino chain reaction
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:44.760]  it's game over and you guys have done that a lot with info or so i'm not bitching at you you're
[1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:50.120]  amazing we wouldn't be here none of us without you we're on this together but that's why they're

[1:51:05.160 --> 1:51:09.960]  account they don't let you buy or sell that's the chinese communist social score that big tech
[1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:13.720]  actually built for them so that's why this is so dangerous and a lot of people say well i'll just
[1:51:13.720 --> 1:51:17.960]  serve the leftist agenda i'll be fine no no no once they get full control you're gonna have to
[1:51:17.960 --> 1:51:22.600]  agree to be sterilized you're gonna have to agree to a termination date where you're gonna be euthanized
[1:51:22.600 --> 1:51:27.320]  you're gonna have to agree to turn your kids over to these people i mean this is a cult of power

[1:53:45.960 --> 1:53:50.920]  the vetting of it and that takes time and so i'm not complaining i mean imagine what it's like folks
[1:53:50.920 --> 1:53:57.560]  we just you have hunter biden's laptop there's like 40 000 things on it it's estimated 25 000
[1:53:57.560 --> 1:54:03.080]  images and videos of porn and it's a lot of him in bed with like really small girls and it looks
[1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:10.600]  like 10 year olds i've talked to folks that have seen it and you know i've had it right in front of
[1:54:10.600 --> 1:54:15.480]  me and i just i just can't look at it i'm just you know there was a jones it's your job you need to
[1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:20.360]  expose this the government's got it it's like juliani tells reporters come to my office you can
[1:54:20.360 --> 1:54:24.680]  look at this because just transmitting it is illegal she's like well send it to me he's like
[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:28.920]  i'm not sending you child porn lady you're a journalist i'm a journalist come look at it
[1:54:28.920 --> 1:54:33.320]  i refuse to even look at it and i at a certain point i've just there's certain things i'm not doing
[1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:41.320]  okay not looking at hunter biden sticking this you know what 10 year olds i'm just not doing it's
[1:54:41.320 --> 1:54:45.480]  on record it's not disputed it was rolled out more than eight months ago in common to china
[1:54:45.480 --> 1:54:50.120]  now it's in europe now it's the united states canada and the most other industrial parts of the planet
[1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:56.680]  every restaurant you go into even small mom and pops have qr codes for you to supposedly
[1:54:56.680 --> 1:55:01.320]  check their menu and they really get upset if you ask for a paper menu but of course they have them
[1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:05.560]  now what are they saying there well you've got to have a cell phone to come in their establishment
[1:55:05.560 --> 1:55:10.280]  and that you can't have a piece of paper because oh everybody's diseased and uh you know we're
[1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:15.000]  spreading germs it's it's absolutely asinine they can throw away the little one sheet papers
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:20.040]  that actually believe that know what this really is is a contact tracing database again this is
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:25.480]  admitted that everyone's being habituated in the scan to be part of so in the future everywhere you
[1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:29.720]  go is tracked officially now your cell phones already tracking you already have home assistants
[1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:33.960]  watching and listening to your house but now this is officially rolling the sound where you
[1:55:33.960 --> 1:55:38.840]  won't buy or sell have a job in an airplane without it and bill gates even admits it so think about
[1:55:38.840 --> 1:55:46.440]  that folks and we'll look out i once saw a bumper sticker that read if you want your children to
[1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:53.400]  listen to you whisper and it's true a lot of times if somebody's shouting and yelling even
[1:55:53.400 --> 1:55:58.760]  of what they're talking about is important people tend to tune it out you know why i know that because
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:04.520]  i'm elege jones and i've been pretty obnoxious over the years because i'm worried about the new world
[1:56:04.520 --> 1:56:10.200]  order and i read about all their plans to lock down civilization start the third world and then
[1:56:10.200 --> 1:56:15.320]  enslave the first world so i've been really really loud and really really aggressive and
[1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:20.680]  we've had a big effect but but now it's time to think about every different angle and every
[1:56:20.680 --> 1:56:26.440]  different way where you get people to think for themselves before it's too late the lockdown
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:33.800]  social distancing the mask is meant to end human civilization we are under a civilization collapse
[1:56:33.800 --> 1:56:40.120]  weapon so this is live and death please share info wars dot com handband our video and watch our
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:57:02.760]  live election coverage you're listening to the alex jones show we are continuing on this
[1:57:02.760 --> 1:57:10.920]  live friday transmission taking your phone calls and the suspense is intense but really i almost
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:17.960]  feel punch-trunk from the fight that wow we're we're almost into election day saturday sunday
[1:57:17.960 --> 1:57:25.400]  monday three days so three and a half days the rest of friday saturday sunday and then it is on

[1:57:33.480 --> 1:57:41.400]  live right through the evening on tuesday i hope trump has such a landslide that they
[1:57:41.400 --> 1:57:46.840]  capitulate but polosia said he's biden will be president trump will be fumigated out no matter
[1:57:46.840 --> 1:57:52.920]  what we don't care what the election says we're putting him in and they've broken down the plan
[1:57:52.920 --> 1:57:55.880]  of how they're gonna do that they're just gonna contest it and say we say you didn't count these
[1:57:55.880 --> 1:58:00.520]  other ballots that we sent out everywhere we're gonna do it and that but she got caught going
[1:58:00.520 --> 1:58:03.400]  around without a mask and going to get her hair done everything now she wears a mask while she
[1:58:03.400 --> 1:58:10.200]  gives speeches i mean this is just a cult of crazies who had to use the scare of an exaggerated
[1:58:10.200 --> 1:58:16.280]  virus to get marshal law in place and now all these unpopular dictators like merkel and macron
[1:58:16.280 --> 1:58:20.120]  they've all become dictators with the parliamentary system once they get in like hitler got elected but
[1:58:20.120 --> 1:58:25.320]  once he got in he used it to basically create the elections as fraud so all these dictators
[1:58:25.320 --> 1:58:31.160]  worldwide are doing this it's disgusting jacob in south carolina you're on the air thanks for holding
[1:58:32.760 --> 1:58:38.600]  hey sir can you hear me yes sir hey uh former infantry marine and uh former law enforcement
[1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:43.880]  officer and i just want to give my uh my opinion on what uh antsy polosi said yes sir god bless
[1:58:43.880 --> 1:58:49.560]  you please give us your view and thank you for your service to the republic yes sir um yeah i mean i'm
[1:58:49.560 --> 1:58:56.520]  i'm beyond uh angry and what she's saying at the very least is the dishes and it's enticing a
[1:58:56.520 --> 1:59:04.120]  civil war and i i just don't understand where's the accountability and well you just said it they've
[1:59:04.120 --> 1:59:10.680]  gotten away with so many crimes why not just escalate it but she's pushing it there and notice
[1:59:10.680 --> 1:59:17.080]  trump keeps saying the bar and to ray arrest these people but they won't do it because they're scared
[1:59:17.080 --> 1:59:21.560]  i don't think they're even really traitors they're just scared because i mean this is man's work right
[1:59:21.560 --> 1:59:27.400]  now but at least trump's standing up yeah i mean we're living in a time of great iniquity um and
[1:59:27.400 --> 1:59:32.920]  the only thing i could think of to do is train my neighbors and and the people i know how to use
[1:59:32.920 --> 1:59:37.480]  their weapons if it comes down to it and i don't want it and i don't want to stir fear with the
[1:59:37.480 --> 1:59:41.960]  sure but you can't have communist chinese say we don't care if the president selected we're gonna
[1:59:41.960 --> 1:59:47.160]  install our agent i mean you can't do that no absolutely not you know that's not what it's not
[1:59:47.160 --> 1:59:52.600]  what i fought for and it's in i'm trying to protect this this country and what are your other
[1:59:52.600 --> 1:59:59.080]  observations jacob and and and what are your former colleagues in the military saying uh lost contact
[1:59:59.080 --> 2:00:06.840]  with a lot of them but uh i've mixed views i mean i've even talked to one one guy uh veteran who
[2:00:06.840 --> 2:00:11.560]  said that the chinese role in he's just gonna tell him to do and then i've also met and and
[2:00:11.560 --> 2:00:15.240]  that's just one but most of the people i talked to there so you talked to someone that said he'll
[2:00:15.240 --> 2:00:22.440]  follow their orders yeah yeah surprise the hell out of me but um so that that that element does
[2:00:22.440 --> 2:00:27.880]  exist but most of but 90 percent of the people i talked to they're they're not going to have it
[2:00:27.880 --> 2:00:32.600]  you know we we just have to get together and do we can to protect our neighbors our families
[2:00:32.600 --> 2:00:37.240]  our children have a future i agree well it's the globalists and the communists that left us and
[2:00:37.240 --> 2:00:41.080]  the big tech guys that have been above the law that brought us this place through their insanity
[2:00:41.080 --> 2:00:44.600]  almost none of them have been in the military that's what's so dangerous about it is you got a
[2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:48.440]  fear a bunch of military people in government historically because sometimes they'll come
[2:00:48.440 --> 2:00:52.760]  bad and take over but not as bad as a group of untrained people who have corporate power
[2:00:52.760 --> 2:00:56.840]  who don't know about military consequences so you got a bunch of people playing army
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:01:03.160]  that have taken our lack of resistance as weakness instead of taking it as restraint
[2:01:03.160 --> 2:01:08.680]  and so they're really playing with fire here brother yeah absolutely and uh and just one thing
[2:01:08.680 --> 2:01:13.000]  i want to say as well you know even back to far back is 2003 when i was in afghanistan we were finding
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:18.040]  brand new chinese weapons and caves and you know that that never got any attention so even back
[2:01:18.040 --> 2:01:20.920]  then i was just like what the hell's going on that's right let's be clear you were basically
[2:01:20.920 --> 2:01:30.440]  fighting chinese arms yeah yeah we were fighting in the caves and uh the the the talban afghanis
[2:01:30.440 --> 2:01:34.600]  whoever they're all armed up with them brand new brand new chinese stuff brand new chinese weapons
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:39.880]  and ammo amazing anything else you want to add jacob are you done uh that's that's about it man i'm
[2:01:39.880 --> 2:01:45.000]  done thank you sir for the call all right 60 seconds away a bunch of calls straight ahead stay with us

[2:04:00.520 --> 2:04:04.760]  it's a decisive victory by trump but the democrats and policy have said they're going to say
[2:04:05.640 --> 2:04:10.360]  that biden won no matter what and that's what we're discussing right now how do we respond to that
[2:04:10.920 --> 2:04:15.560]  constitutional lawyer robert barnes joins us the bottom of the hour but right now let's clear this
[2:04:15.560 --> 2:04:21.160]  board of these calls there's 10 callers i can see right there and even more on hold below that but
[2:04:21.160 --> 2:04:26.520]  we're going to go to the lila we're going to go to tyler dc blake ian mohammed jimmy

[2:04:34.840 --> 2:04:38.920]  let's go ahead and talk to ian in utah you're on the air go ahead
[2:04:38.920 --> 2:04:46.680]  hey alex strapped in for the next three months gonna be a bumpy ride uh yeah i'm ready i'm not
[2:04:46.680 --> 2:04:52.200]  looking forward to it but i'm ready yeah all right well first thing that i wanted to get into today
[2:04:52.200 --> 2:04:59.160]  was i think that trump needs to replace bar with juliani juliani's doing a lot more exposing
[2:04:59.160 --> 2:05:04.440]  the corruption with hunter biden bars just kind of sit back not doing anything by the way juliani
[2:05:04.440 --> 2:05:11.560]  first sought that position four years ago oh really yep well i think he'd really be the man for the
[2:05:11.560 --> 2:05:17.320]  job he he has the attorney general experience and he like you said earlier in your show
[2:05:17.320 --> 2:05:21.080]  he went after the crying families in new york so i think he could get a lot done
[2:05:23.560 --> 2:05:32.120]  absolutely he helped bust him up yep the entire thing is now jack tort dorsi keeps saying that
[2:05:32.120 --> 2:05:37.800]  that he's not election meddling or anything he literally just had something out on his twitter
[2:05:37.800 --> 2:05:44.360]  when i logged in this morning saying the election might be delayed because of voting but because
[2:05:44.360 --> 2:05:48.440]  of mail in ballot oh yeah they're all been putting that out for months and then admitting it's their
[2:05:48.440 --> 2:05:53.160]  strategy to put out the millions of ballots and then to hold it up and then to claim trumps of
[2:05:53.160 --> 2:05:56.840]  fraud i mean this is gonna happen now will they succeed i don't know but they're going to try
[2:05:56.840 --> 2:06:08.520]  to execute this oh no doubt and anything else uh just november first we need the silent majority
[2:06:08.520 --> 2:06:14.840]  to wake up we're going to do trump caravans all over the entire country all 50 states you can
[2:06:15.560 --> 2:06:21.880]  register to be a volunteer or just be a part of it on www dot maga drag the interstate dot com
[2:06:21.880 --> 2:06:25.560]  let's make this a big one let's have our voices be heard it's beautiful we're going to be out this
[2:06:25.560 --> 2:06:30.040]  weekend on the armored vehicle with trump gear and i see a lot of the crew today wearing keep america
[2:06:30.040 --> 2:06:35.960]  great hats uh because you you've got to do it you've got to exercise it in the face of people
[2:06:35.960 --> 2:06:40.360]  that have tried to intimidate us and said we can't i mean when your country you hear about
[2:06:40.360 --> 2:06:45.960]  college students kicked out high school kids kicked out people lose their jobs because they're
[2:06:45.960 --> 2:06:52.040]  seen wearing a trump hat at the movies this is i mean again it's wrong to say black people can't
[2:06:52.040 --> 2:06:56.600]  go to a lunch line or to say you know that somebody's Hispanic they can't have a bank
[2:06:56.600 --> 2:06:59.800]  account that's that's evil that's wrong that hardly ever happened in the u.s. history but it's
[2:06:59.800 --> 2:07:04.840]  happened imagine saying it's huge support trump or because you're not anti-police that you can't
[2:07:04.840 --> 2:07:10.200]  have a bank account again i've had a bank for 20 years here in texas texas bank and they closed
[2:07:10.200 --> 2:07:14.200]  our bank account about a month ago and i went in there to close it i said what about my kids
[2:07:14.200 --> 2:07:19.320]  accounts i got some tutma you know college fund emergency medical funds not a lot of money but
[2:07:19.320 --> 2:07:23.800]  you know bank accounts for my kids and they said we want no relationship with you or anybody in your
[2:07:23.800 --> 2:07:30.520]  family under jurisprudence and common law and everything else you know if somebody's dad does
[2:07:30.520 --> 2:07:35.400]  something wrong though i didn't you don't keep it or their or their children you don't say they're
[2:07:35.400 --> 2:07:40.360]  guilty but that's the left man these are dirty authoritarians and and people have decided to go
[2:07:40.360 --> 2:07:44.440]  along with it and a lot of americans have have abandoned their birthright and i was more than
[2:07:44.440 --> 2:07:50.120]  happy to leave i just wanted to know but they took real pleasure and just said the directive here is
[2:07:50.120 --> 2:07:57.880]  no relationship with you or anybody in your family straight up tyranny and i'm just i'm just over
[2:07:57.880 --> 2:08:02.440]  not holding these people accountable for what they've done because this is where we are now for not
[2:08:02.440 --> 2:08:07.080]  pushing back and not holding anyone accountable for their crimes and now they're just eroding all
[2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:14.520]  of her freedoms away damn right ian thanks for the call all right next up peter and denver peter

[2:08:42.280 --> 2:08:50.600]  new time we're in um it is really important that every christian and especially every info warrior
[2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:56.360]  christian repent of everything that you you can think of that the holy spirit would lead you to

[2:09:35.080 --> 2:09:40.840]  congress if she can oh yeah news from that little demon yeah yeah i think she's gonna angle to get
[2:09:40.840 --> 2:09:46.760]  him elected and but how do we get around so i've got an idea on getting around the tech censorship
[2:09:46.760 --> 2:09:51.560]  to um for this election and after because you say they're gonna probably be tightening up the
[2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:57.160]  the internet censorship in the next few days and then the next few months the next 70 something
[2:09:57.160 --> 2:10:03.560]  days i oh it's going to be hellish so yeah so jumping off of what a lady called in yesterday
[2:10:03.560 --> 2:10:11.400]  with uh the idea on um the the profile pictures now i'm not too familiar with um with social media
[2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:16.040]  i was never really interested in it and i got bored back in the days of sure well that's where
[2:10:16.040 --> 2:10:20.200]  most people are now that's how they communicate so she was saying have an info wars dot com or an
[2:10:20.200 --> 2:10:25.080]  election night dot news url left us won't recognize that so they'll go to it not know what they're
[2:10:25.080 --> 2:10:31.480]  seeing uh as the profile picture i think that's a great idea what's your other idea um so people
[2:10:31.480 --> 2:10:37.480]  can post like videos and and photos and selfies to these social media right so why do you have to
[2:10:37.480 --> 2:10:42.600]  stop with a profile picture can't you just like take selfies of any take a picture of any sure it
[2:10:42.600 --> 2:10:47.160]  hits keywords though so if you describe it as alex jones or info wars they will take it down
[2:10:47.160 --> 2:10:53.240]  i would have you say look at this craziness then the ai will match the photo and see you said crazy
[2:10:53.240 --> 2:10:57.800]  and believe people don't get the sarcasm so the way to beat it is look at this piece of filth alex
[2:10:57.800 --> 2:11:05.640]  jones damn him to hell he should have no speech they will leave that up because not just the
[2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:11.800]  robots won't recognize it the soul of sociopaths the check it they they they they don't even know
[2:11:11.800 --> 2:11:17.400]  what that means they don't get humor you understand yeah but but in the photograph itself like just
[2:11:17.400 --> 2:11:23.720]  take a picture of a url so then it becomes it becomes encoded as a as a absolutely that's how
[2:11:23.720 --> 2:11:27.960]  you get around these guys look how do you beat computers when they're having to hack a site
[2:11:27.960 --> 2:11:32.520]  the site will pop up an image this is put in this code of to form numbers and letters to get around
[2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:40.120]  a computer so exactly just like we use images to beat computers hacking we can use images to defeat
[2:11:40.120 --> 2:11:45.640]  their ai to get messages out absolutely and their whole mission is to stop us communicating so we
[2:11:45.640 --> 2:11:50.920]  should be spending time communicating but how about painting info wars dot com on the side of a barn
[2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:55.800]  or if you're scared of that url how about news wars dot com how about flying an airplane with a url
[2:11:55.800 --> 2:12:02.360]  on the side how about just telling people just a little bit every day has a huge effect well so
[2:12:03.720 --> 2:12:08.920]  who's uh a social media influencer out there who's got youtube channels that are still up like
[2:12:08.920 --> 2:12:16.040]  Watson and uh and you know uh Hannity I don't know who else like Tucker Carlson and you guys uh
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:22.360]  create uh create some uh videos and I'll do it too and we'll create because people need to be taught
[2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:26.280]  how to do this is a new way of communicating through the people haven't really thought of but
[2:12:26.280 --> 2:12:30.280]  taking pictures well you remember like those military guys a few years ago when they were
[2:12:30.280 --> 2:12:34.680]  the soldiers were saying they weren't going to go to war uh in Syria right so they hold up a piece
[2:12:34.680 --> 2:12:39.720]  of paper cover their face but still put it out yes communication is king it is resistance
[2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:43.960]  everyone's got to do it now with only three days four days of the election thank you so much Blake
[2:12:43.960 --> 2:12:51.560]  more call straight ahead stay with us I get asked all the time by the listeners and by the media
[2:12:51.560 --> 2:12:55.960]  what am I most proud of when it comes to the show and it's the fact that info wars more than
[2:12:55.960 --> 2:13:01.080]  25 years ago doing basic research with what the club of Rome and the cfr and others were actually
[2:13:01.080 --> 2:13:06.680]  saying developed the hypothesis that the communist china had been set up to take our jobs and
[2:13:06.680 --> 2:13:11.880]  transform to china and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt well now
[2:13:11.880 --> 2:13:17.080]  china owns the debt now china owns hollywood all the one side of trading deals it turns out our
[2:13:17.080 --> 2:13:22.520]  analysis was absolutely dead on but again it wasn't that hard the cfr and others admitted what they
[2:13:22.520 --> 2:13:28.840]  were doing but still others didn't want to focus on that issue we did and you focused on it by
[2:13:28.840 --> 2:13:33.320]  supporting us at info wars so when you go to info wars store dot com and get all the great
[2:13:33.320 --> 2:13:38.440]  supplements books t-shirts films water filtration air filtration all of it you're funding the
[2:13:38.440 --> 2:13:42.600]  organization that literally helped make up the world what's really happening so that's a big
[2:13:42.600 --> 2:13:49.960]  accomplishment for all of you i'm gonna thank you for your support election 2020 is here and
[2:13:49.960 --> 2:13:55.960]  whether trump wins or loses we have all won by exposing the communist chinese by exposing the
[2:13:55.960 --> 2:14:01.320]  globalist by exposing the pedophile rings by exposing the fact this is really a fight between
[2:14:01.320 --> 2:14:06.520]  good versus evil now i'm personally a christian i believe in god and i know god's real and i've
[2:14:06.520 --> 2:14:11.080]  experienced it in my life but even you don't believe in god it's important to recognize that
[2:14:11.080 --> 2:14:15.000]  there is good in this world there is evil and there are people out there that want to do you
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:21.480]  harm because they enjoy doing that and what i see happening across the spectrum of different political
[2:14:21.480 --> 2:14:26.760]  views is people finally get that they finally understand that they're not being naive anymore
[2:14:27.400 --> 2:14:33.720]  don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what they
[2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:38.200]  stand for and who they are or you're gonna get hurt but those of you out there have done your own
[2:14:38.200 --> 2:14:42.360]  research and discovered who's good and who is faithful will then come together with those
[2:14:42.360 --> 2:14:47.720]  organizations and support them like info wars because without your support info wars would not exist
[2:14:47.720 --> 2:14:53.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:15:17.720 --> 2:15:24.600]  the distance crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[2:15:27.720 --> 2:15:28.920]  no flashbolts
[2:15:31.560 --> 2:15:37.400]  no trophy no flowers no flashbolts no line he's haunted by something he cannot define
[2:15:37.400 --> 2:15:42.440]  bowels shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse assail him and bail him with monster truck force
[2:15:42.440 --> 2:15:47.080]  and his mind he's still thriving still making the grade she's hoping in time that her memories
[2:15:47.080 --> 2:15:51.560]  will fade because he's racing and pacing and potting the course he's fighting and fighting
[2:15:51.560 --> 2:15:57.160]  and riding on his horse the sun has come down and the moon has come up and longer goes somebody
[2:15:57.160 --> 2:16:02.200]  left with the cup but he's striving and driving and hugging the turns and thinking of someone for
[2:16:02.200 --> 2:16:09.720]  whom he still burns he's going because he's going the distance he's going for speed
[2:16:09.720 --> 2:16:17.960]  he's all alone all alone in a time of need
[2:16:17.960 --> 2:16:24.520]  taking your calls here all right tyler in wisconsin he's up next tyler thanks for holding go ahead
[2:16:26.200 --> 2:16:30.840]  at first time long time alex and uh you know a long time ago uh seems like a long time ago
[2:16:30.840 --> 2:16:34.760]  probably wasn't that long ago you said uh you you were asking a lot of people you know what is the
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:39.000]  the symbol of the time we're in you'd answered yourself once you said uh you know the symbol
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:45.400]  of info or should be the human fist mashing a robot's face forever and you know robots are one thing
[2:16:45.400 --> 2:16:50.840]  to us here in this material world but to satan the deception is the robot is a perfectly possessed
[2:16:50.840 --> 2:16:56.440]  human being and that's what's going on right now is is the bottom line the the basic reality of what
[2:16:56.440 --> 2:17:02.680]  we're dealing with the rest is fluff is that satan is looking to possess the world remotely
[2:17:02.680 --> 2:17:07.880]  you know and create a society where we do that nascently to ourselves that's it it's a giant
[2:17:07.880 --> 2:17:14.360]  avatar takeover you just said it yes and and the solution is all of us educating ourselves on what
[2:17:15.320 --> 2:17:20.840]  what exercises these demons and the stages of exorcism and as you go out in the streets and you
[2:17:20.840 --> 2:17:25.720]  see this coming out of people that's the demon still holding on to its subject and your earlier
[2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:31.800]  caller said our battle is not against flesh and blood and we need to evict these demons out of
[2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:36.680]  these poor people and and notice the signs and know how to do it and be soldiers by the way it's
[2:17:36.680 --> 2:17:44.360]  real it's like a computer program is running them yeah yeah brilliant perfect no you're right i mean
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:49.640]  it's very robotic it's like a transmission and you go out they're like hey america i'll kill the
[2:17:49.640 --> 2:17:54.120]  babies and you're like these are like business women and stuff it's like it's getting worse
[2:17:54.120 --> 2:18:00.040]  something clicks in them how do they exponentially are they mesmerized by the tv how do they get
[2:18:00.040 --> 2:18:05.080]  put under the spell how do they become like this now this is the great work and you know our enemy
[2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:10.520]  has the long game why our battle isn't against flesh and blood is because these these we were born
[2:18:10.520 --> 2:18:15.400]  into this battle and these beings that are from another realm that that human beings are starting
[2:18:15.400 --> 2:18:21.800]  to tune into whether it's through dmp or tv or you know choose your poison that there's only two
[2:18:21.800 --> 2:18:27.240]  transmissions and we only have one antenna and we're either tuning into one or the other and oh
[2:18:27.240 --> 2:18:31.960]  that's so heavy say that again there's only two transmissions and we only got one antenna
[2:18:31.960 --> 2:18:37.480]  that's right and you're either tuned into one or the other and and you you can't have one foot
[2:18:37.480 --> 2:18:43.320]  in each camp we need to get in you need to get right right now because that is what propels us
[2:18:43.320 --> 2:18:48.600]  forward because human beings the long run is we're just one human being and when we were born
[2:18:49.240 --> 2:18:54.920]  in ancient times to now is that human being maturing to the point where god knows we're
[2:18:54.920 --> 2:19:00.280]  ready to take on the enemy in this fallen world and that's now and that's us and we need to step
[2:19:00.280 --> 2:19:05.240]  up to the plate realize that our enemies could all be fit into one room we are the majority we
[2:19:05.240 --> 2:19:13.400]  are strong we are the info warriors we are god's transmission on this planet alex yeah love you
[2:19:13.400 --> 2:19:18.120]  tyler yeah i mean i'll be honest with with people i don't you can call it demon possession whatever
[2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:25.080]  you want to call it i remember like getting in fives for two or three people were ganged up on
[2:19:25.080 --> 2:19:29.800]  me and then like really getting angry and then like this other thing took over me and i was like
[2:19:29.800 --> 2:19:34.600]  behind it watching it and it just wanted to destroy people and hurt them and it totally
[2:19:34.600 --> 2:19:40.920]  enjoyed what it was doing and was very vicious you call it an aspect of our human being what we
[2:19:40.920 --> 2:19:46.040]  are whatever it is but i just remember like sitting back in my consciousness watching it fight
[2:19:47.880 --> 2:19:53.480]  and it was just enjoying crushing people and just and in slow motion just all of it was pure
[2:19:54.040 --> 2:19:59.000]  destruction it wanted to destroy people and you get around globalists they don't really have that
[2:19:59.000 --> 2:20:04.200]  that much of a fire breathing effect but they they still have like they want to wreck things they want
[2:20:04.200 --> 2:20:07.880]  to do bad things it's not like that they came out of them in a fight fight with their life it comes
[2:20:07.880 --> 2:20:12.040]  out in them when they're just like teaching a bunch of school kids or something they want to hurt
[2:20:12.040 --> 2:20:18.360]  things and it's it's very demonic and it's not good and uh that's why the enemy wants to get us
[2:20:18.360 --> 2:20:22.440]  into wars and stuff to try to trigger that in us and get us to make that connection it's it's not good
[2:20:24.040 --> 2:20:27.320]  all right up next we're going to the order the calls are received for sure everybody holding

[2:22:55.160 --> 2:22:59.480]  the new world order the general public i hear is waking up i think that's why they're trying to really
[2:22:59.480 --> 2:23:07.800]  put you guys under martial law issue here we only had 30 years of independence we just stepped out
[2:23:07.800 --> 2:23:15.640]  of communism but apparently people enjoy communism because they are uh i don't know if you walk down

[2:23:38.920 --> 2:23:43.480]  dave allison we're going to everybody the order your call comes in really we really appreciate
[2:23:43.480 --> 2:23:52.040]  you stay with us the problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites the most cunning smart
[2:23:52.040 --> 2:23:58.600]  inventive people believe that chivalry doesn't exist anymore they don't believe in being aristocrats
[2:23:59.160 --> 2:24:03.400]  trying to hold up civilization and power the people and once the establishment has that
[2:24:03.400 --> 2:24:08.120]  predatory idea civilization collapses very very quickly you can't treat the least of us
[2:24:08.840 --> 2:24:13.640]  like garbage and not treat your own family like that and so it is this lack of empathy that's
[2:24:13.640 --> 2:24:19.240]  going to destroy us the globalists can try to be heartless devil worshipers that commit rituals
[2:24:19.240 --> 2:24:24.440]  of all sorts of horrible crimes try to get away from humanity but really they can't escape the
[2:24:24.440 --> 2:24:29.960]  laws of the universe they may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves
[2:24:29.960 --> 2:24:34.840]  but the repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the
[2:24:34.840 --> 2:24:40.760]  very structure itself wealth is created by loving god wealth is created by having connection to god
[2:24:40.760 --> 2:24:46.600]  god is the source of all creation all success all power we deny that you'll be destroyed there
[2:24:46.600 --> 2:24:52.200]  are many references in the holy bible to the mustard seed and why is that it's one of the
[2:24:52.200 --> 2:24:58.840]  tiniest seeds out there but a giant tree like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds
[2:24:59.560 --> 2:25:04.680]  mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects they didn't know
[2:25:04.680 --> 2:25:11.160]  why well with modern science we know it's one of the purest cleanest organic forms of selenium
[2:25:11.160 --> 2:25:18.840]  we have bio true selenium sold out for months back in stock at info wars store dot com at 50
[2:25:18.840 --> 2:25:26.440]  percent off store ride free shipping and triple patriot points bio true selenium at info wars
[2:25:26.440 --> 2:25:32.600]  store dot com is an amazing product and it's even more amazing and that it funds our operation
[2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:38.120]  but if you don't know about selenium research it is an essential nutrient in the body that you've
[2:25:38.120 --> 2:25:43.720]  actually have to have it's back in stock 50 off triple patriot points at info wars store dot com
[2:25:43.720 --> 2:25:51.400]  and with free shipping six months ago the highly respected former head of the rockefeller hospital
[2:25:51.400 --> 2:25:59.320]  virology department went public and said the mainline science on virology is you cannot protect
[2:25:59.320 --> 2:26:04.280]  somebody from a virus like this you have to wait till there's herd immunity and there's never been
[2:26:04.280 --> 2:26:10.600]  a vaccine for any of the coronavirus family of viruses they do not work well even bill gates now
[2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:15.400]  admits oh the vaccine will really never work but you have to keep social distancing and wearing
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:20.920]  masks they're now saying forever last week it was 10 years now it's forever see how the power grab
[2:26:20.920 --> 2:26:25.480]  works so when you hear them saying trump is surrendering and a sheep of staff is surrendering
[2:26:25.480 --> 2:26:29.880]  to coronavirus when they say we just have to learn to live with it and boost our immunity with
[2:26:29.880 --> 2:26:36.600]  things like vitamin d c and of course sink that's the reality that's not fear mongering that's not
[2:26:36.600 --> 2:26:41.640]  giving in to the power grab and the endless fear of the new world order they create a problem to
[2:26:41.640 --> 2:26:45.160]  which there is no solution but they are again the people that say they're gonna be in charge
[2:26:49.160 --> 2:26:51.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:26:51.800 --> 2:26:53.800]  oh
[2:26:58.840 --> 2:27:05.000]  yeah here's our new single record from highwayman two album silver stallion silver stallion

[2:27:44.520 --> 2:27:52.040]  we're gonna ride we were supposed to be off the air by now right like a one night we were supposed
[2:27:52.040 --> 2:28:00.280]  to have given up already they didn't work that way because we stood together that didn't hide
[2:28:00.280 --> 2:28:07.960]  that's reality you did it we did it i'm gonna find me a reckless woman with razor blades and
[2:28:07.960 --> 2:28:14.840]  dice in her eyes one more little piece of the song i'm gonna find me a reckless woman
[2:28:14.840 --> 2:28:20.840]  oh razor blades and dice in her eyes
[2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:27.480]  just a touch of sadness center finger
[2:28:30.600 --> 2:28:36.600]  thunder and lightning in her thigh and we're gonna ride
[2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:42.680]  and we're gonna ride all right robert barnes constitutional lawyer good friend of mine
[2:28:42.680 --> 2:28:49.080]  smart historian the smartest guys i know joins us the most little while then we'll go back to your
[2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:55.240]  phone calls you're looking at tyranny right now they are now announcing the contact tracing in
[2:28:55.240 --> 2:29:01.480]  europe the apps to travel now michigan other client states are doing it the attorney general uh in
[2:29:01.480 --> 2:29:07.240]  minnesota is saying trump's not allowed to have a rally violate the first amendment this is incredible
[2:29:07.240 --> 2:29:13.240]  this is over the top you have marshal law been declared all over europe all stores to be closed
[2:29:13.240 --> 2:29:19.560]  including places to eat uh as people flee what's the big picture globally what's happening with the
[2:29:19.560 --> 2:29:23.960]  election what should be done about this is we know the lockdown the democrats admit
[2:29:23.960 --> 2:29:28.760]  whitmaris said she wants to use it to drive us into not voting for trump i think it's backfired
[2:29:28.760 --> 2:29:32.360]  on them but they're doubling down robert barnes what in hell is going on here
[2:29:32.360 --> 2:29:37.080]  oh at least definitely extraordinary times i mean what you're looking at in terms of
[2:29:37.560 --> 2:29:42.120]  the the track and tracing that's taking place is they're now making it a condition like in
[2:29:42.120 --> 2:29:46.920]  michigan of operating your business you can't operate your business unless you become an agent
[2:29:46.920 --> 2:29:53.400]  of the state and track and trace your own customers for the benefit of the state surveillance so we've
[2:29:53.400 --> 2:29:58.120]  did surveillance capitalism that's taken a whole different uh angle and a whole different edge
[2:29:58.120 --> 2:30:04.840]  where your condition of your business operation is being a component of this uh track and trace
[2:30:04.840 --> 2:30:10.360]  mechanism that's meant to control populations and mass and while that's happening on the one side
[2:30:10.360 --> 2:30:15.800]  you have the extraordinary big tech censorship and manipulation taking place in the election
[2:30:15.800 --> 2:30:21.880]  that's overt and open now what is previously subtle and hidden is now clear for everyone
[2:30:21.880 --> 2:30:26.120]  to witness uh i still think trump will win the election i think he'll win it despite
[2:30:26.120 --> 2:30:31.080]  all of these obstacles and burdens and i think you may even win it by the kind of margin that
[2:30:31.080 --> 2:30:36.040]  will make it tough i think it'll be outside the margin of fraud i think it'll be uh two uh the
[2:30:36.040 --> 2:30:41.400]  margins will be too big and too many key swing states for them to even successfully steal it
[2:30:41.400 --> 2:30:46.280]  but people have to be prepped and prepared for a legal onslaught that will make bush v gore look
[2:30:46.280 --> 2:30:52.760]  like a walk in the park uh they use a lot the team of lawyers the army of lawyers that democrats
[2:30:52.760 --> 2:30:58.040]  are amassing and as uh biden Freudian slipped and said they had built the greatest voter fraud
[2:30:58.040 --> 2:31:04.120]  organization in american history well that Freudian slip was very revelatory and it's what the entire
[2:31:04.120 --> 2:31:10.120]  country faces because if trump wins the the press and the the polling community that supports the
[2:31:10.120 --> 2:31:14.680]  press has already said that they're going to claim it was stolen solely because their bogus polls
[2:31:14.680 --> 2:31:20.120]  predicted he couldn't win well that's exactly where i was going next and i should have pointed
[2:31:20.120 --> 2:31:25.000]  out you're not just a famous constitutional lawyer that's very respected but you're also the guy
[2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:29.800]  would even go to bloomberg they say you're the biggest political better in the world that you
[2:31:29.800 --> 2:31:35.400]  made 300 000 dollars just in ireland alone betting on trump and upset i guess over a million total
[2:31:35.400 --> 2:31:41.320]  or whatever uh on that uh on on on bets then four years ago so you really do your due diligence
[2:31:41.320 --> 2:31:47.000]  and i agree with you landslide for trump except they're not going to concede and now Pelosi came
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:53.400]  out and said we don't care if trump says he wins biden will be seated and she said three months ago
[2:31:53.400 --> 2:31:57.560]  we're just gonna have her own inauguration and split the country up i mean these people have
[2:31:57.560 --> 2:32:02.680]  got a lot of hutzpah no doubt about it i mean they're attempting to allow ballots to be counted
[2:32:02.680 --> 2:32:08.040]  for days or even weeks uh pennsylvania's three days in north carolina it's it's over a week
[2:32:08.040 --> 2:32:13.800]  in nevada it's up to two weeks where they can be counting ballots that come in after election day
[2:32:13.800 --> 2:32:17.960]  so clearly they're building a they're trying to make that margin of fraud as big and as broad as
[2:32:17.960 --> 2:32:23.800]  possible uh to make it as impossible as possible for trump to win so i think all of those dynamics
[2:32:23.800 --> 2:32:29.640]  clearly point to a problematic component for what's going to happen and trump's team and
[2:32:29.640 --> 2:32:33.640]  everybody behind trump has to be prepped and prepared because they're we're going to see a
[2:32:33.640 --> 2:32:38.680]  scale and scope of activity that we have not witnessed before and we know it's not going
[2:32:38.680 --> 2:32:43.480]  to be democrats claiming that oh he cheated they're going to claim oh minorities are angry
[2:32:43.480 --> 2:32:50.120]  you stole this from biden and they're going to try to activate these antifa white progressive
[2:32:51.000 --> 2:32:55.720]  intelligentsia types most of them are academics that are democrat party operatives you know like
[2:32:55.720 --> 2:33:01.560]  the senator canes the sun arrested all these top democrats children arrested out setting fires
[2:33:01.560 --> 2:33:06.200]  of things they are intending to literally set the country on fire i think all the things we've
[2:33:06.200 --> 2:33:12.360]  seen the previous year are only a beta test for the big move there no doubt about it it's
[2:33:12.360 --> 2:33:16.040]  we've been living through a real life milgram experiment and there's an attempt to assert
[2:33:16.040 --> 2:33:22.200]  complete state control over the west and we're seeing it in increasing scale and scope uh
[2:33:22.200 --> 2:33:25.640]  and they all you know they got away with a lot of what they did in the lockdown they got away
[2:33:25.640 --> 2:33:29.160]  with a lot of these test and tracing experiments so they're just going to unleash them on a
[2:33:29.160 --> 2:33:33.720]  different level they let china open up that introductory mechanism of controlling the
[2:33:33.720 --> 2:33:37.720]  population and the guys of virus control and they're just going to continue to expand it
[2:33:37.720 --> 2:33:43.880]  then the one the one thing holding them back is the reelection of donald trump the reelection of
[2:33:43.880 --> 2:33:48.280]  donald trump is the greatest hindrance to the ability of sort of the deep state apparatus to
[2:33:48.280 --> 2:33:52.600]  seize uh more control and more power across absolutely i still get a few people on the
[2:33:52.600 --> 2:33:57.720]  street go is trump for real i mean he's really thinks he's the president does he make mistakes
[2:33:57.720 --> 2:34:01.560]  yeah but he's actually being the president and he's pissed off all these special interests
[2:34:01.560 --> 2:34:05.640]  how would you quantify that for folks just because he's a real president and isn't out to get us and
[2:34:05.640 --> 2:34:09.960]  it's a good guy doesn't mean we agree with everything he does but clearly he is the president
[2:34:09.960 --> 2:34:15.640]  when a foreign group is taking control of the country and they're pissed he's the only person
[2:34:15.640 --> 2:34:20.040]  in the entire western world outside of sweden that's pushing back on lockdowns i mean so the
[2:34:20.040 --> 2:34:23.720]  that gives you an idea for him and he's still independent he still follows his own instincts
[2:34:23.720 --> 2:34:28.440]  he still follows his populist guidance of what the working class voters that put him in there for
[2:34:28.440 --> 2:34:33.000]  and he clearly and you can see it in the degree of opposition when big tech is willing to
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:37.560]  go to great lengths to censor information about hunter biden they're only doing that because
[2:34:37.560 --> 2:34:42.600]  they believe that trump is the greatest threat to their consolidation of power the deep state
[2:34:42.600 --> 2:34:47.000]  isn't doing the shenanigans that they're up to but for thinking that donald trump is the greatest
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:52.760]  threat to their consolidation of power the massive donations coming in from wall street park avenue
[2:34:52.760 --> 2:34:59.080]  silicon valley san francisco dc is it pouring into biden's campaign because they think anything
[2:34:59.080 --> 2:35:04.200]  other than trump is the greatest hindrance to the uh their ability to control power so whatever
[2:35:04.200 --> 2:35:11.640]  his imperfections he is from a populist perspective the uh only obstacle to the establishment teasing
[2:35:11.640 --> 2:35:17.160]  and monopolizing control moving forward and let's define this from a wall street perspective just
[2:35:17.160 --> 2:35:21.640]  using that as a keystone there's many angles to look at this but from that one why would wall
[2:35:21.640 --> 2:35:25.160]  street even though under trump they've goldman sacks jp morgan they've all made the biggest
[2:35:25.160 --> 2:35:30.040]  profits in their history why do they hate him because they like to create artificial contractions
[2:35:30.760 --> 2:35:36.440]  that kill continuity that kill grassroots wealth and generational wealth for average people to
[2:35:36.440 --> 2:35:41.880]  consolidate power they use the stock market as a gyrating consolidation weapon whereas trump
[2:35:41.880 --> 2:35:47.480]  is using it as a rising tide raising all ships which is a renaissance move they don't like so
[2:35:47.480 --> 2:35:51.960]  they don't like the fact that he's not using the stock market as a weapon but as an empowerment tool
[2:35:51.960 --> 2:35:57.880]  and that shows how disgusting they are no doubt about it i mean the the the willingness to use a
[2:35:57.880 --> 2:36:04.920]  virus as a tool to seize power and mass and get a degree of social control no state outside of
[2:36:04.920 --> 2:36:10.840]  communists or fascists ever achieve shows you their willingness and readiness to use any tools at
[2:36:10.840 --> 2:36:16.360]  their disposal to seize and control the population and the only thing stopping it is trump the only
[2:36:16.360 --> 2:36:20.920]  thing the only prevention is trump the only protection is trump the only protection against
[2:36:20.920 --> 2:36:26.280]  the virus of statism is trump and that is the great threat great risk our populist faces as
[2:36:26.280 --> 2:36:30.920]  it goes into the future robert barnes let's chronicle that when we come back i mean how
[2:36:30.920 --> 2:36:35.160]  eight months ago this starts from china now the whole world's china they admit the lockdown never
[2:36:35.160 --> 2:36:40.680]  ends bill gate says ten years the un says it never ends i mean we have to start saying no now
[2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:45.640]  there's no doubt pushing back because the handcuffs are going on the chains are going on you're only
[2:36:45.640 --> 2:36:51.240]  here on air facing the globalist onslaught the dnc funded lawsuits and everything that's happening
[2:36:51.240 --> 2:36:56.120]  because of you when we built the only truly multimedia independent radio tv print film

[2:37:15.240 --> 2:37:19.160]  know it's a little historic thing i think trumps gonna win but if biden's able to steal it we'll
[2:37:19.160 --> 2:37:23.080]  be probably shut down pretty quick so it'll be historic thing to have you'll be able to fight
[2:37:23.080 --> 2:37:27.720]  them in the third dimension on the street with graffiti with handbills you hand out and with
[2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:32.600]  non-compliance not paying taxes and pulling your kids out of the schools and uh just making it a

[2:44:00.840 --> 2:44:07.000]  all right constitutional lawyer robert barnes you just heard me lay this out you were better than me
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:12.760]  it's true you and gateway pundit jim hoft eight nine months ago were telling me on air and off
[2:44:12.760 --> 2:44:17.880]  air jones i know your heads in your bed you see the lockdown in china this is overall a hoax
[2:44:17.880 --> 2:44:22.680]  it's it's a bad flu maximum they're counting deaths of other people it's a un operation so what
[2:44:22.680 --> 2:44:27.480]  have it's man made that's so gates can own it uh this is going to be a permanent lockdown they're
[2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:32.280]  going to use it to control people and for about a month i wasn't sure i just give credit where it's
[2:44:32.280 --> 2:44:38.280]  due you were ahead of me on that you are the grand booba uh other than maybe jim hoff but you have
[2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:43.800]  a legal perspective on what this really is so spend time on what code it is what it's being used for
[2:44:43.800 --> 2:44:49.480]  what we're facing lockdown to and what we should do to resist it no doubt about it i mean i think
[2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:54.520]  what happened was you had something that we know we had the asian flu of 1958 the hong kong flu of
[2:44:54.520 --> 2:45:01.240]  1968 both of those were much more lethal in terms and in a broader population of lethality than this
[2:45:01.240 --> 2:45:07.400]  flu is and yet we've reacted in ways we've never reacted to any virus in history not even the spanish
[2:45:07.400 --> 2:45:13.720]  flu did we shut down civil society shut down economies shut down all small businesses prohibit
[2:45:13.720 --> 2:45:18.920]  basically put everybody under mass house arrest and that is in fact what we're doing on a recurrent
[2:45:18.920 --> 2:45:24.040]  basis across the west even when the world health organization and other people conceded that this
[2:45:24.040 --> 2:45:28.920]  was a bad medical strategy we're seeing it unleashed again throughout europe we're seeing it unleashed
[2:45:28.920 --> 2:45:33.560]  again in parts of the united states because they love the power and the control that comes with it
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:39.080]  so it's an experiment in social control and they found that most people will comply and that because
[2:45:39.080 --> 2:45:43.880]  they think most people will comply continuously and ceaselessly they're not going to give up this
[2:45:43.880 --> 2:45:48.040]  power and their control once they have it just as when they figured out people would go along with
[2:45:48.040 --> 2:45:55.160]  the kind of invasive checks at airports after 9 11 only led to them accelerating and institutionalizing
[2:45:55.160 --> 2:46:01.080]  that control of the population the same thing is intended now on a massive scale and the next great
[2:46:01.080 --> 2:46:09.080]  risk aside from additional and continuous and endless lockdown is forced vaccinations is requiring
[2:46:09.080 --> 2:46:15.640]  people as a condition of employment a condition of education a condition simply of civil participation
[2:46:15.640 --> 2:46:21.160]  probably even a condition of voting down the road that you have to have accepted the vaccine
[2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:26.760]  from whatever government agency fouchi says is okay uh and as an internal divide as to what's
[2:46:26.760 --> 2:46:31.320]  going on there where fouchi favors his and this is literally the right to put in your body what they
[2:46:31.320 --> 2:46:37.080]  want literal rape with the m rna vaccines that in some tests a hundred percent gets sick the other
[2:46:37.080 --> 2:46:45.560]  80 percent that changed the dna of your cell not even a vaccine a totally new genetic recombinant
[2:46:45.560 --> 2:46:49.080]  deal out of bladerunner or something i mean i mean even in bladerunner they explain the real
[2:46:49.080 --> 2:46:53.560]  science that you try to change the overall operation of a cell's code that causes cancer
[2:46:53.560 --> 2:47:01.320]  or gives rise to an arian uh virus oh exactly i mean we this is a we have never had a successful
[2:47:01.320 --> 2:47:06.520]  corona virus vaccine in history in medical history uh there's very little evidence that of a
[2:47:06.520 --> 2:47:12.200]  successful flu vaccine over time its success rate varies by year and it can often be more
[2:47:12.200 --> 2:47:17.960]  problematic than positive the swine flu of 1976 famously a rushed vaccine that led to much more
[2:47:17.960 --> 2:47:23.960]  problems than the flu itself post so the same risk is present here and we're rushing into it and
[2:47:23.960 --> 2:47:29.000]  people are pushing into it for reasons of uh it's almost like you could take a drug and suddenly
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:34.520]  you met you call it vaccine and magically it's it's blessed by god and suddenly is now perfect
[2:47:34.520 --> 2:47:39.240]  exactly they've got they've got vaccines that reprogram the brain with viruses that eat certain
[2:47:39.240 --> 2:47:43.880]  receptors that's not a vaccine that's a viral lobotomy they're just calling new classes of
[2:47:43.880 --> 2:47:49.640]  nanotech drugs vaccines exactly because they found that they've been able to suppress dissent on the
[2:47:49.640 --> 2:47:55.080]  issue of vaccine that as long as they just relabel the name of the drug call it vaccine people think
[2:47:55.080 --> 2:48:00.040]  it's something safe like a one blanket for a baby in the winter when in fact it's medical
[2:48:00.040 --> 2:48:06.280]  experimentation on human beings uh and under the guise of vaccinations under the guise of public
[2:48:06.280 --> 2:48:11.480]  health is how we got uh forced sterilization in the teens in the 20s which ultimately was the
[2:48:11.480 --> 2:48:16.840]  intellectual breeding ground for the not the experimentation of the 1930s and then we got to
[2:48:16.840 --> 2:48:22.520]  ski and everything came out of not america but the mad scientist in england and america people
[2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:27.800]  go why do you i love america but we literally created hitler on record they used that as defense
[2:48:27.800 --> 2:48:33.880]  of the nuremberg trial exactly because they found it it came from english and american what you
[2:48:33.880 --> 2:48:39.400]  can embrace the ideas of eugenics and human experimentation there was no moral or legal
[2:48:39.400 --> 2:48:44.200]  limits to where that could go and we know it where it ended up it ended up in not the experimentation
[2:48:44.200 --> 2:48:49.400]  it ended up in uh forced sterilization and so i want black folks and white folks to riot against
[2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:53.720]  forced inoculation not because a cop might have shot somebody who's wrong that you don't blame
[2:48:53.720 --> 2:48:58.040]  the whole cops for that but you do blame a corrupt government with bill gates coming to shoot us up
[2:48:58.040 --> 2:49:01.640]  with dangerous stuff and i'm not calling for violence but i'm saying it's going to be legitimate
[2:49:01.640 --> 2:49:06.520]  bob if they keep pushing this crap no doubt i think it's something that the deep state apparatus
[2:49:06.520 --> 2:49:11.560]  underestimates if they remove the ability to democratically check the excesses of the deep
[2:49:11.560 --> 2:49:16.280]  state apparatus what do what options there are people left with it's not good options so that's
[2:49:16.280 --> 2:49:21.800]  why we need democracy to succeed we need democracy to survive we need democracy to be sustained
[2:49:21.800 --> 2:49:25.880]  and that means our courts need to be open and enforcing our constitutional rights and liberties
[2:49:25.880 --> 2:49:29.560]  and that means donald trump needs to get reelected president because otherwise we will
[2:49:29.560 --> 2:49:34.520]  face a status onslaught of the kind we haven't seen anywhere in the western world since the rise
[2:49:34.520 --> 2:49:40.440]  of fascism and communism in the 1930s you're damn right keep going here we're going to take calls
[2:49:40.440 --> 2:49:45.400]  next hour but i mean this is such a naked power grab and they're foaming at the mouth but i see it
[2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:49.640]  as a sign of desperation they're trying to act over confident and the un and the globalists are
[2:49:49.640 --> 2:49:52.680]  pushing us because they're in trouble i don't think they're doing this because they're strong bob
[2:49:53.960 --> 2:49:58.200]  no i agree it's a sign of weakness big tech knows more about what's happening in the election
[2:49:58.200 --> 2:50:04.760]  than anybody because of their algorithms and yet they were willing to a disco to show the world
[2:50:04.760 --> 2:50:10.280]  their overt open corruption and censoring the hunter biden that's right they wouldn't be intensifying
[2:50:10.280 --> 2:50:15.800]  under scrutiny if they weren't under orders and scared exactly there's no reason for them to expose
[2:50:15.800 --> 2:50:20.280]  themselves and show their hand unless their internal data shows trump's gonna win so that
[2:50:20.280 --> 2:50:25.000]  means they have to manipulate all sources of information and all means of of that information
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:28.760]  being distributed and dispersed it's what we've been talking about for years i mean the reason
[2:50:28.760 --> 2:50:34.200]  why they use you as the template was to try to control and gatekeep information for this election
[2:50:34.200 --> 2:50:39.800]  and for this scheme it's not because this election is also about their ability and their capacity
[2:50:39.800 --> 2:50:45.000]  to force vaccines on people to force continuous lockdown to continue to stress the system and
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:49.960]  see how much social coercion and social compliance they can get out of the public which they've all
[2:50:49.960 --> 2:50:55.000]  made record profits of consolidating and killing local economy i mean this is literal genocide
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:51:00.440]  against the third world physically genocide against businesses in the first world exactly
[2:51:00.440 --> 2:51:05.560]  really we've seen a favoritism for the cost goes in the walmart against mom and pop businesses
[2:51:05.560 --> 2:51:09.880]  across the entire country in the western world and now they want to see how much experimentation
[2:51:09.880 --> 2:51:14.360]  they can get away with so the only check on it is the america the american experiment of freedom
[2:51:14.360 --> 2:51:18.440]  and democracy which will be tested i agree stay there you know and i don't want it to happen but
[2:51:18.440 --> 2:51:23.000]  people are starting experimenting on these big tech people with lead and with cold steel i mean
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:28.920]  you know it's like hey we're us code title 50 chapter 32 subsection 1528 paragraph b said it was
[2:51:28.920 --> 2:51:36.440]  legalized the new secret testing we'll just call this secret testing there cognitive dissonance is
[2:51:36.440 --> 2:51:43.160]  a major issue amongst the left it can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept
[2:51:43.160 --> 2:51:48.520]  if you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition buy them a bottle
[2:51:48.520 --> 2:51:54.760]  of ultimate fish oil from info wars store dot com studies have suggested that fish oils and fish
[2:51:54.760 --> 2:52:01.080]  oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure decrease triglyceride levels decrease the
[2:52:01.080 --> 2:52:07.000]  growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses and joints
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:13.880]  and the digestive system recent studies have suggested that high epa and dha fish oil can
[2:52:13.880 --> 2:52:20.120]  stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells
[2:52:20.120 --> 2:52:26.760]  it worked for my family and now i can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts
[2:52:26.760 --> 2:52:32.760]  that pertain to reality get your ultimate fish oil for a friend family member or yourself at
[2:52:32.760 --> 2:52:39.960]  info wars store dot com something huge has happened in the last two weeks remember when
[2:52:39.960 --> 2:52:47.080]  hunter biden's laptop first broke and all of big tech in concert from twitter and facebook to
[2:52:47.720 --> 2:52:54.120]  youtube google all worked to block it they didn't deny that it was real they just wouldn't let anybody
[2:52:54.120 --> 2:53:00.360]  even talk about the story or link to major newspapers or even the house and senate committees
[2:53:00.360 --> 2:53:06.200]  that were looking at it well now fast forward as the fire hose of information comes out and more
[2:53:06.200 --> 2:53:10.520]  tapes get released to more audio with hunter admitting he was a communist chinese agent
[2:53:11.080 --> 2:53:14.920]  we're not trying to censor anymore not because they're good people but because this crisis in
[2:53:14.920 --> 2:53:21.560]  effect boomeranged on their traitorous butts last time just a few weeks ago and so now they know
[2:53:21.560 --> 2:53:25.720]  they're trying to suppress it only makes it bigger it's just like they've done with info wars
[2:53:25.720 --> 2:53:31.080]  in band off video it's truly amazing so keep telling the truth lord works mysterious ways
[2:53:31.080 --> 2:53:34.280]  amazing things are happening and these communist chinese agents are going to pay
[2:53:34.280 --> 2:53:54.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:53:54.280 --> 2:54:02.120]  at a short time to get there i'm eastbound just like no bandit run give me liberty or give me death
[2:54:02.760 --> 2:54:10.280]  it's alex jones let it all hang out cause we got a run to pick the boys are thirsty in atlanta
[2:54:10.280 --> 2:54:18.600]  and there's beer in texas counter and we'll bring it back no matter what it takes eastbound and down
[2:54:18.600 --> 2:54:24.280]  go ahead up and truck it are we gonna do what they say can't be done robert barnes is our guest
[2:54:24.280 --> 2:54:30.520]  on your phone calls next segment team nine to six minutes but i wanted to ask him about the hunter
[2:54:30.520 --> 2:54:35.080]  biden stuff they're confirmed it's real the media keeps trying to just ignore it all this chinese
[2:54:35.080 --> 2:54:40.040]  spying evidence coming out even if biden got in i don't see how they ever get away with what they've
[2:54:40.040 --> 2:54:43.880]  done other than a total police state in which i guess the democrats say they're gonna carry out so
[2:54:43.880 --> 2:54:50.920]  we we've absolutely got to defeat biden what are other angles what's your view on the hunter
[2:54:50.920 --> 2:54:56.040]  biden situation and all that that's coming out what's extraordinary is the fb i had this for
[2:54:56.040 --> 2:55:01.640]  a year and sat on it buried it and so the it's it's incredible the scope the scale the depth the
[2:55:01.640 --> 2:55:06.680]  duration of the corruption the fact that durham has not taken meaningful action i think that after
[2:55:06.680 --> 2:55:12.360]  the election trump needs to step up and uh and and basically resuscitate aspects of our american
[2:55:12.360 --> 2:55:17.960]  democratic institutions and the first way he can do that is to pardon both uh snowden and assange
[2:55:17.960 --> 2:55:21.880]  uh he needs to send a message to the deep state that their ongoing corruption and collusion and
[2:55:21.880 --> 2:55:27.080]  covering up the biden scandal not taking action related to spygate has to have a consequence
[2:55:27.080 --> 2:55:31.560]  and the best way for it to have a consequence is to pardon the two people they hate almost as much
[2:55:31.560 --> 2:55:36.760]  or even more than the president julian uh assange and ed snow and these have these have been two
[2:55:36.760 --> 2:55:40.840]  critical whistleblowers that have been a check on the corruption of the deep state and we need to
[2:55:40.840 --> 2:55:46.040]  unleash their power again we need to re-empower wicka leeks re-empower snowden to be able to
[2:55:46.040 --> 2:55:50.680]  continue to be important whistleblowers against the institution i totally agree isn't that trump's
[2:55:50.680 --> 2:55:56.680]  biggest uh failing that he didn't pardon assange and green light others he told assange whoever's
[2:55:56.680 --> 2:56:01.320]  got the intel give it out release it he did it i think that's one of that's a big strike against
[2:56:01.320 --> 2:56:05.560]  trump why hasn't he done the right thing i think a lot of people convince them that if he reached
[2:56:05.560 --> 2:56:09.080]  a date time with the deep state that durham would clean up the bad actors and everything would be
[2:56:09.080 --> 2:56:14.440]  great and durham didn't even issue a report as was promised so the uh he trusted people that are
[2:56:14.440 --> 2:56:19.320]  simply untrustworthy i think i mean for example imagine if julien assange was sitting in the
[2:56:19.320 --> 2:56:24.120]  equatorian embassy he likely would have got this by hunter biden information six months ago and it
[2:56:24.120 --> 2:56:29.160]  would have gone public a long time ago and in a more effective delivery mechanism uh than people
[2:56:29.160 --> 2:56:33.960]  like steve bannon and rudy julian assange would have been a much more effective means to get this
[2:56:33.960 --> 2:56:37.560]  truth out about the world if you just put it up on a website for everybody you don't like senate
[2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:42.600]  only certain media exactly and you don't do it in a sort of half-assed way that sounds that looks
[2:56:42.600 --> 2:56:47.560]  selective and looks partisan you let someone that has a long established record of never like
[2:56:47.560 --> 2:56:51.560]  they're able to challenge the verification and authentication of these things because it's not
[2:56:51.560 --> 2:56:55.880]  assange assange everything he's put out has always been validated and verified none of it has ever
[2:56:55.880 --> 2:57:01.560]  been wrong so the they removed assange to help facilitate the corruption of this election protect
[2:57:01.560 --> 2:57:06.840]  the corruption of the biden and undermine trump i think he's starting to recognize and realize that
[2:57:06.840 --> 2:57:11.160]  full scope at scale now so hopefully he'll take remedial action after the election because if
[2:57:11.160 --> 2:57:16.040]  the fund was not under indictment the hunter biden corruption and other biden related corruption
[2:57:16.040 --> 2:57:19.960]  would have already been fully exposed i agree and i know folks that know juliani he doesn't know
[2:57:19.960 --> 2:57:24.520]  how to run a website he doesn't know how to do this so it's not that juliani's even bad he just
[2:57:24.520 --> 2:57:28.360]  he just doesn't know what he's doing and no one's willing to i'm not willing i'm not going to publish

[2:57:32.280 --> 2:57:37.720]  little kids man but that's a crime to even put her out and the fbi won't prosecute the guy that did
[2:57:37.720 --> 2:57:43.160]  it they'll prosecute me you know they would bob oh no doubt about it the hypocrisy is hot i mean
[2:57:43.160 --> 2:57:48.280]  the problem is rudy juliani is a poor man's julien assange steve bannon is a poor man that looks
[2:57:48.280 --> 2:57:53.000]  jones it's not the effective way to get this story out and so uh it could have been far more
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:58.600]  effective if assange had been free and in order to free democracy uh president needs to free assange
[2:57:58.600 --> 2:58:02.440]  and but bob i know you've probably already been offered it i think you have i mean i've been

[2:58:11.240 --> 2:58:15.480]  probably don't want to want that job do you no exactly that's where assange and wikileaks were
[2:58:15.480 --> 2:58:20.120]  perfect for this they have done this multiple times over the decade they are the best skilled
[2:58:20.120 --> 2:58:24.840]  best equipped people to screen through it quickly filter it effectively verify it authentically i

[3:00:22.360 --> 3:00:24.200]  oh smokey god damn air zone
[3:00:26.760 --> 3:00:29.320]  there you have a big trump parade in israel
[3:00:30.920 --> 3:00:33.800]  trump parades in europe trump parades in the united states
[3:00:34.840 --> 3:00:39.560]  there was one was like a 100 miles long the other day i was reading about on the east coast robert
[3:00:39.560 --> 3:00:43.880]  barns country's lawyer is our guest we're about to go to these loaded phone lines get to every one
[3:00:43.880 --> 3:00:49.320]  of them that are holding barns other points about the selection i mean wow what does the left do if
[3:00:49.320 --> 3:00:53.640]  your predictions that were right four years ago that trump wins in a landslide so big they can't
[3:00:53.640 --> 3:00:58.680]  even contest because all the uncounted ballots will be less the numbers than they need to go over
[3:00:58.680 --> 3:01:04.200]  the top when it's clear what are they going to do then when they lose well they heard they're
[3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:07.800]  already previewing it i mean they're basically taking the strategy that they use in foreign
[3:01:07.800 --> 3:01:12.680]  countries that the cia types use in foreign countries which is to create bogus polling narratives
[3:01:12.680 --> 3:01:18.040]  that say trump can't win so that if he does win they claim he stole it somehow and you already
[3:01:18.040 --> 3:01:23.800]  have people like nat silver the 538 uh the big political forecasters saying exactly that so
[3:01:23.800 --> 3:01:28.360]  they're trying to set up a narrative in advance of trying to discredit trump's election discredit
[3:01:28.360 --> 3:01:32.760]  democracy discredit the american working class that's going to put him back in power particularly
[3:01:32.760 --> 3:01:37.880]  in small town america across the country that's turning out in record levels trying to discredit
[3:01:37.880 --> 3:01:42.280]  them by claiming they really didn't vote for who they voted for and the uh the only question is what
[3:01:42.280 --> 3:01:46.840]  storyline and narrative and what culprit they're going to blame it on uh unless they're not going
[3:01:46.840 --> 3:01:51.640]  to try to go back to the russia gate narrative times you know the sequel or the or the third of
[3:01:51.640 --> 3:01:56.280]  the trilogy uh so i think that's what's coming that they're going to try to discredit the election
[3:01:56.280 --> 3:02:01.800]  by any means possible even though they know uh already from their internal data that in fact
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:07.080]  it's extremely close and then amongst key voter groups trump is the leading i totally agree with
[3:02:07.080 --> 3:02:11.240]  you so why don't we get arrogant statements by polosi that regardless what happens with the election
[3:02:11.240 --> 3:02:16.440]  this is a quote joe biden will be inaugurated the 20th what the hell does that mean i mean that's
[3:02:16.440 --> 3:02:20.360]  what's right i mean i think that you know they need to win a majority of house seats to try to
[3:02:20.360 --> 3:02:25.080]  invalidate the election so that there's a majority of house delegation they already have enough house
[3:02:25.080 --> 3:02:29.480]  seats but right now they don't control enough state absolutely so do they gain seats in the house
[3:02:29.480 --> 3:02:33.240]  according to your number crunching do they get control the senate well let's look at congress
[3:02:33.240 --> 3:02:37.720]  what's your view on that i don't think they will i don't think they they don't have enough control
[3:02:37.720 --> 3:02:41.960]  in enough states and they don't have enough good candidates in enough states so i think republicans
[3:02:41.960 --> 3:02:46.680]  will still continue to control the majority of delegations in the house so that will be the check
[3:02:46.680 --> 3:02:52.200]  for trump uh we'll see you know look you know as we talked about there it was not a trustworthy vote
[3:02:52.200 --> 3:02:55.800]  and everybody said that she was going to get on there and she was going to stop all this nonsense
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:03:00.040]  in pennsylvania and other people and what did she do she ran for cover and didn't even vote
[3:03:00.040 --> 3:03:05.160]  so he can't trust the supreme court unfortunately that's a good point she just basically went along
[3:03:05.160 --> 3:03:10.440]  with all this and her first vote didn't even vote exactly she she found the whole purpose to russia
[3:03:10.440 --> 3:03:14.680]  was the people told trump put her on the bench and she'll make sure none of these crazy things
[3:03:14.680 --> 3:03:19.640]  happened in these elections and she gets a chance right away in pennsylvania north carolina the vote
[3:03:19.640 --> 3:03:24.440]  was happened they waited deliberately until after she was confirmed so that she had an opportunity
[3:03:24.440 --> 3:03:29.400]  to vote and she skipped voting uh said that does she doesn't feel comfortable voting right now
[3:03:29.400 --> 3:03:35.080]  so that tells you how unreliable it's it's it trump's power comes from the people and so as long
[3:03:35.080 --> 3:03:40.280]  as the people's voice is heard their willingness to override that their willingness to completely
[3:03:40.280 --> 3:03:45.720]  ignore that is limited so that's where his only real power base is is the base of the popular
[3:03:45.720 --> 3:03:49.320]  support that he sure i wanted to leave the door open for her but i trust you you've really been
[3:03:49.320 --> 3:03:54.360]  brilliant accurate that scares the hell out of me gosh all right let's take calls mohammed in florida
[3:03:54.360 --> 3:03:56.920]  thanks for holding you're on the air with robert barnes welcome sir
[3:04:00.360 --> 3:04:05.880]  let's first our rule of the foreign invasion is to grab control of the media and the communications
[3:04:06.680 --> 3:04:11.960]  i remember uh in russia boris yeltsin uh we need to go over uh we're trying to fight against the
[3:04:11.960 --> 3:04:18.760]  ussr the bloodiest battles that occurred were in the newsrooms in the media so this is where
[3:04:18.760 --> 3:04:23.960]  the battle is i mean the chinese have bought the media they control the media they control
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:31.080]  big tech they they are in the big tech headquarters actually controlling the tech controlling the
[3:04:31.080 --> 3:04:37.240]  algorithms no you're right it's it's big news big news controls big tech you're right correct so
[3:04:37.240 --> 3:04:43.480]  trump needs to make business priority he needs to round up jack dorsey he needs to round up uh
[3:04:43.480 --> 3:04:50.360]  zuckerberg facebook he needs to go after jeff zucker cnn these people have been colluding
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:56.520]  with a foreign power to take over the united states and i'm not just saying that it's a fact
[3:04:56.520 --> 3:05:01.960]  when you can when you go on twitter and you can put chinese propaganda that's not taken down but
[3:05:01.960 --> 3:05:06.360]  when you put something about the united states about the president when the president's headquarters
[3:05:06.360 --> 3:05:11.720]  are shut down that's foreign collusion when you can when you go on youtube and you can say
[3:05:11.720 --> 3:05:16.200]  china is evil and they won't let that comment say but you can put america is evil and that comment
[3:05:16.200 --> 3:05:23.080]  will stay that's colluding with a foreign power he has the he has that capability based on that to
[3:05:23.080 --> 3:05:27.640]  charge him with treason to charge him with sedition if they're guilty they need to be executed
[3:05:27.640 --> 3:05:33.640]  immediately to set an example the biggest battle here is in the newsroom it's in the media once
[3:05:33.640 --> 3:05:38.040]  it i mean we could do anything we want to do we can win the election by land it won't matter
[3:05:38.040 --> 3:05:41.880]  because the media is going to report what the chinese want the media to report
[3:05:41.880 --> 3:05:48.600]  that's the biggest battle this is not this is not a situation this this is a fight this is a
[3:05:48.600 --> 3:05:53.720]  boris boris yeltsin moment where we're we're going to have to get bloody our founding fathers
[3:05:54.440 --> 3:05:59.800]  throughout throughout history we fought these kind of wars to prevent this type of takeover well i
[3:05:59.800 --> 3:06:03.320]  agree with you that i'm not in command of any violence i don't want violence but we're coming
[3:06:03.320 --> 3:06:08.760]  into an area where if they're involved in criminal activity and and refuse to follow elections
[3:06:08.760 --> 3:06:13.720]  we enter a wheelhouse where it's always been finally blood that gets the the the the check
[3:06:13.720 --> 3:06:18.280]  signed i appreciate your call mom at very powerful points please call back again thanks for holding
[3:06:18.280 --> 3:06:23.320]  robert barnes well i mean and we're seeing what the system wants is they want to weaponize their
[3:06:23.320 --> 3:06:27.880]  own mob while preventing people from being able to defend themselves that's why they're not allowing
[3:06:27.880 --> 3:06:32.920]  self-defense to be that's why they're criminally prosecuting people who defended themselves like
[3:06:32.920 --> 3:06:38.280]  rithdenhouse like the mccloskey's uh like michael strickland out of portland and all these cases
[3:06:38.280 --> 3:06:42.920]  while weaponizing the mob and not letting either the police or the public protect themselves from
[3:06:42.920 --> 3:06:47.320]  the mob when it's a leftist mob committing violence and i think that's part of that they're
[3:06:47.320 --> 3:06:52.520]  anticipating in advance the different ways people could resist well they're encouraging the mob to
[3:06:52.520 --> 3:06:57.720]  go out and attack saying you've got to get out of jail free car exactly they want to control the mob
[3:06:57.720 --> 3:07:01.960]  and prevent self-defense and even prevent local police from defending themselves and we're
[3:07:01.960 --> 3:07:06.920]  defending their community so that's the goal is to seize yellow cop and somebody's trying to stab
[3:07:06.920 --> 3:07:10.440]  me doesn't matter i'm a cop or not i'm gonna defend myself i've arrived to defend myself
[3:07:10.440 --> 3:07:15.160]  i've seen videos where cops let people beat them over the head with baseball bats yeah they'd
[3:07:15.160 --> 3:07:18.920]  become terrified and they become it was the whole reason why they went after the prop boys
[3:07:18.920 --> 3:07:23.400]  originally in new york it was to discourage and deter people from defending themselves from the
[3:07:23.400 --> 3:07:27.480]  mob and the cops saw that they're like wait you can attack my people you can't defend yourself
[3:07:27.480 --> 3:07:32.440]  exactly and if you do all of a sudden you're going to be demonized in the press you're going
[3:07:32.440 --> 3:07:36.200]  to be attacked you're going to be criminally prosecuted if you're just the if you just show
[3:07:36.200 --> 3:07:40.840]  people a gun like the mcloskey so the or if you defend yourself from people trying to seize your
[3:07:40.840 --> 3:07:45.080]  gun and that you're hit you in the head powerful like a written out powerful let's go to dc in
[3:07:45.080 --> 3:07:50.360]  nevada dc in nevada you're on the old rubber barns go ahead yeah yes sir you're there yes sir
[3:07:50.360 --> 3:08:00.760]  okay alex man if the whole lvh or is of the world that is ignorant
[3:08:02.040 --> 3:08:11.000]  they need to stand down and they need to fear that the vision of violence is through their neglect
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:22.200]  that's number one number two polosi obama or should i say michelle obama uh who are the baby
[3:08:22.200 --> 3:08:30.680]  mamas clinton are the baby mamas of the scarlet of the world they do not want law to happen because
[3:08:30.680 --> 3:08:39.000]  they are the scarlet women of the world but jesus said he's living life in the life of word is jesus
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:47.160]  i'm gonna give you one other thing man they go bloody mad you have the assignment and the consignment
[3:08:47.800 --> 3:08:55.720]  to control whatever it takes for what is sitting on the scarlet letter these people are sitting on
[3:08:55.720 --> 3:09:04.520]  the scarlet letter and this scarlet letter is the women who are over women bodies and they're
[3:09:04.520 --> 3:09:12.520]  conscious this is what they are missing and they know that satan had given them that particular fear
[3:09:13.240 --> 3:09:19.400]  and violence and ignorance to control the women body but let me give you one other thing alex
[3:09:20.040 --> 3:09:26.840]  before i let you go you start talking to me david and goliath it was a rock man go ahead and throw
[3:09:26.840 --> 3:09:36.440]  it at rot okay i got you brother very interesting poetry and i know there's some meaning to that
[3:09:36.440 --> 3:09:40.520]  i'll listen to it after the show thank you so much we'll cover it and take more calls right ahead
[3:09:42.440 --> 3:09:47.320]  i get asked all the time by listeners and by the media what am i most proud of when it comes to
[3:09:47.320 --> 3:09:52.520]  show and it's the fact that info war is more than 25 years ago doing basic research with what the
[3:09:52.520 --> 3:09:58.040]  club of rome and the cfr and others were actually saying developed the hypothesis that communist
[3:09:58.040 --> 3:10:03.000]  china had been set up to take our jobs and transform to china and then make us economically
[3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:08.520]  destitute and position us into debt well now china owns the debt now china owns hollywood all the one
[3:10:08.520 --> 3:10:14.600]  side of trading deals it turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on but again it wasn't that hard
[3:10:14.600 --> 3:10:20.360]  the cfr and others admitted what they were doing but still others didn't want to focus on that issue
[3:10:20.360 --> 3:10:26.040]  we did and you focused on it by supporting us at info wars so when you go to info wars store
[3:10:26.040 --> 3:10:30.760]  dot com and get all the great supplements books t-shirts films water filtration air filtration
[3:10:30.760 --> 3:10:35.320]  all of it you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world what's really
[3:10:35.320 --> 3:10:38.840]  happening so that's a big accomplishment for all of you i want to thank you for your support
[3:10:42.120 --> 3:10:48.200]  election 2020 is here and whether trump wins or loses we have all won by exposing the communist
[3:10:48.200 --> 3:10:54.200]  chinese by exposing the globalist by exposing the pedophile rings by exposing the fact this is
[3:10:54.200 --> 3:10:59.720]  really a fight between good versus evil now i'm personally a christian i believe in god and i know
[3:10:59.720 --> 3:11:04.200]  god's real and i've experienced it in my life believe you don't believe in god it's important
[3:11:04.200 --> 3:11:08.120]  to recognize that there is good in this world there is evil and there are people out there that
[3:11:08.120 --> 3:11:14.600]  want to do you harm because they enjoy doing bad and what i see happening across the spectrum
[3:11:14.600 --> 3:11:19.560]  whatever political views as people finally get that they finally understand that they're not
[3:11:19.560 --> 3:11:25.800]  being naive anymore don't ever project your decency and your goodness on to other people
[3:11:25.800 --> 3:11:31.080]  until they've proven what they stand for and who they are or you're gonna get hurt but those of
[3:11:31.080 --> 3:11:35.160]  you out there have done your own research and discovered who's good and who is faithful will
[3:11:35.160 --> 3:11:39.560]  then come together with those organizations and support them like info wars because without
[3:11:39.560 --> 3:11:47.560]  your support info wars would not exist you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:11:57.400 --> 3:12:06.600]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:12:06.600 --> 3:12:09.800]  on a fly like an eagle to the sea

[3:12:58.360 --> 3:13:01.960]  hey i want to hit a few falls here but let us sit on the big secret i don't
[3:13:01.960 --> 3:13:06.200]  think you can give us everything but you're getting ready with a big heavy hitter who's
[3:13:06.200 --> 3:13:10.600]  exposing the vaccine damage and the vaccine fraud doesn't mean we're against vaccine technology
[3:13:10.600 --> 3:13:14.280]  doesn't mean we're against science but the vaccine dangers the bad effects that they've
[3:13:14.280 --> 3:13:18.440]  been covering up they're now admitted you know they they attack Joe Rogan said jones's line
[3:13:18.440 --> 3:13:23.480]  that 80 got sick at a bill gates study release bill gates saying it himself on cbs news
[3:13:25.160 --> 3:13:29.720]  this is big i mean the whole new frontier is them congress passes a law saying they have
[3:13:29.720 --> 3:13:33.880]  liability protection they really don't do they bomb i have no doubt about i mean that they
[3:13:33.880 --> 3:13:39.320]  shouldn't be basically what happens the political class created a label of a drug and just put a
[3:13:39.320 --> 3:13:44.920]  fancy label on it like vaccine and we're supposed to magically remove all the risks associated with
[3:13:44.920 --> 3:13:49.960]  any form of new drug i mean when you're sticking something in your body and particularly vaccines
[3:13:49.960 --> 3:13:55.480]  are often sticking viruses in the people's bodies the the bad reactions are known to occur unless
[3:13:55.480 --> 3:14:01.160]  they're properly tested and properly cleared and medical informed consent requires that the
[3:14:01.160 --> 3:14:06.040]  government not be able to invade your body without your knowledge about what it is they're
[3:14:06.040 --> 3:14:10.600]  trying to stick in your body and without your right to be able to decline it and so the whole
[3:14:10.600 --> 3:14:15.800]  nature of constitutional rights the whole nature of medicine the whole nature of secure safe medicine
[3:14:16.360 --> 3:14:22.360]  requires that we treat any drug with the same skepticism and scrutiny that every drug should
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:28.600]  look at regardless of whether the drug is called a vaccine or not and all the censorship of consumer
[3:14:28.600 --> 3:14:33.960]  reviews now they're trying to say a mother whose child has a seizure after it can't complain on
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:38.680]  facebook because he's not a doctor since when can we not complain that we took a drug or had a
[3:14:38.680 --> 3:14:45.400]  surgery and it sucked i mean this is crazy no and there's a long history of governments abusing
[3:14:45.400 --> 3:14:50.520]  their power of over medicine to control population whether it's sending well i mean didn't medical
[3:14:50.520 --> 3:14:55.960]  tyranny start here in a nazi germany i mean didn't tyranny start on a medical system absolutely no
[3:14:55.960 --> 3:14:59.960]  doubt about it i mean the power of the white lab coat to try to control and dictate people's thoughts
[3:14:59.960 --> 3:15:05.240]  minds and behavior has a long history so much so that they study it like in the milgram experiment
[3:15:05.240 --> 3:15:09.880]  and i mean we i mean we try to get rid of native american populations by the name of medicine sending
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:15.320]  him tuberculosis infected blankets so this is a long notorious history in the name of hey we're
[3:15:15.320 --> 3:15:20.680]  here to protect you they sterilize a whole bunch of poor women throughout the south for 30 years
[3:15:20.680 --> 3:15:24.360]  they're denying them and depriving them of the ability to have children and have a future
[3:15:24.360 --> 3:15:30.520]  and have a legacy so the we cannot trust there's a long history of not being able to trust the state
[3:15:30.520 --> 3:15:35.480]  when it comes to saying don't worry we're doing this for your public health that's not enough
[3:15:35.480 --> 3:15:41.880]  we should have the same scrutiny the same skepticism the same standards we apply to any drug we should
[3:15:41.880 --> 3:15:46.600]  apply to vaccines and we should have the same constitutional rights and legal remedies that
[3:15:46.600 --> 3:15:51.240]  we have as it applies to any government action the fact that it's done in the name of the public
[3:15:51.240 --> 3:15:57.160]  health does not magically inoculate it from constitutional scrutiny and civil liberty
[3:15:58.360 --> 3:16:02.680]  and again for folks that don't know there's a stand for research one the prison experiment
[3:16:02.680 --> 3:16:07.240]  and there's the milgram experiment on shocking people to death they explain to people briefly
[3:16:07.240 --> 3:16:11.400]  the history of that it's very important exactly the question was could you bring people in and
[3:16:11.400 --> 3:16:16.760]  get them to shock a complete stranger who was screaming in pain just because someone in a white
[3:16:16.760 --> 3:16:20.680]  lab coat told them to do it that was all they knew they didn't know the person was a doctor
[3:16:20.680 --> 3:16:24.840]  ahead of the expertise they brought them in and the person and then one person's in the other room
[3:16:24.840 --> 3:16:28.760]  and they in the person in the white lab coat keeps telling them oh nope that's the wrong answer
[3:16:28.760 --> 3:16:33.560]  increase the shock increase the shock and so what they believe is they're electrically shocking
[3:16:33.560 --> 3:16:37.400]  the person in the next room now the person the next room is in fact an actor but they don't know
[3:16:37.400 --> 3:16:42.600]  that so they're hearing these people scream in pain and over half of the population would do
[3:16:42.600 --> 3:16:47.000]  whatever a person in a white lab coat told them to do even though they had no medical reason to do
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:52.120]  it no factual reason to do it no logical reason to do it and they knew they were inflicting horrendous
[3:16:52.120 --> 3:16:56.440]  pain on a complete well and they actually believe that in they were killing people they found the
[3:16:56.440 --> 3:17:01.880]  majority would kill someone that's exactly right and they would even ask uh you know the some people
[3:17:01.880 --> 3:17:06.040]  would get worried and say will i be held liable they'd be like no don't worry just keep just keep
[3:17:06.040 --> 3:17:09.960]  doing it keep doing what you're told so let's explain the extrapolation we didn't have a system
[3:17:09.960 --> 3:17:14.680]  that asked her up that would break the social contract at least they try this is secret laboratories
[3:17:14.680 --> 3:17:19.240]  but not in the mass scale we're seeing beta tests like the milgram experiment and stanford
[3:17:19.240 --> 3:17:25.160]  now externalized going operational globally by the un bill gates and others for a total
[3:17:25.160 --> 3:17:30.920]  societal takeover calling all of their desk covet exaggerating and ordering force inoculations
[3:17:31.720 --> 3:17:36.280]  telling us we're non-essential starving the third world i mean this is their big move
[3:17:36.280 --> 3:17:42.120]  ever wanted to see it the worldwide eugenics the population move this is it but exactly i mean
[3:17:42.120 --> 3:17:47.000]  it's amazing how this virus has a disparate effect and it's uh it both is it's direct and
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:51.880]  indirect effect on the kind of populations bill gates doesn't like so the you mean bill gates
[3:17:51.880 --> 3:17:56.440]  has been for death panels it disproportionately affects the elderly bill gates is for for racial
[3:17:56.440 --> 3:18:01.160]  control of lower populations from africa it disproportionately affects african americans
[3:18:01.160 --> 3:18:07.000]  and is starving poor people in african latin america so it reflects only his agenda but sort
[3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:10.920]  of a broader deep state agenda of seeing how much social control they can have i mean when you have
[3:18:10.920 --> 3:18:15.880]  someone like governor of california saying that you can't even get together for Thanksgiving
[3:18:15.880 --> 3:18:22.040]  without without certain limits you can't even sing christian hymns together for your own family at
[3:18:22.040 --> 3:18:27.960]  Thanksgiving but black lives matter is good it can burn your city down it's such an obvious
[3:18:27.960 --> 3:18:31.960]  see what you'll put up with because he has no consequences we never hold him accountable
[3:18:31.960 --> 3:18:37.720]  how do we hold governor newson that monster and and and governor uh of uh michigan how
[3:18:37.720 --> 3:18:43.800]  whitmer how do we hold these monsters uh accountable the first is to reelect donald trump
[3:18:43.800 --> 3:18:47.640]  reelecting donald trump creates the window of opportunity to hold them accountable the second
[3:18:47.640 --> 3:18:51.240]  thing is that a lot of folks that mad at him pushing a vaccine he did that to take control
[3:18:51.240 --> 3:18:56.600]  of gates clearly gates is pissed oh don't take his wait two years and take mine exactly trump has
[3:18:56.600 --> 3:19:02.040]  been not wearing a mask saying he's over it saying don't give in to fear exactly and and also trump
[3:19:02.040 --> 3:19:06.920]  has said he will not force it period that he opposes a forced vaccine so it's simply an option
[3:19:06.920 --> 3:19:11.480]  an alternative for people to have and not and that's the way vaccine should be they should be a
[3:19:11.480 --> 3:19:16.920]  drug with informed consent you could say yes you can say no uh and it should be the same standard
[3:19:16.920 --> 3:19:21.720]  same scrutiny as anything else constitutionally and legally and the only way that's gonna happen
[3:19:21.720 --> 3:19:26.120]  is if donald trump is reelected president will also send a message to all the lockdown
[3:19:26.120 --> 3:19:31.560]  politicians and all the forced vaccine politicians that their agenda is nowhere near as popular as
[3:19:31.560 --> 3:19:35.640]  they thought it is if donald trump is reelected all right barns how do folks follow you on twitter
[3:19:35.640 --> 3:19:42.280]  my friend sure at barns underscore law uh they haven't uh censored me yet so the uh still up there

[3:20:23.320 --> 3:20:30.200]  that isn't as censored as much is also listed on the website and it is i forget the name it there
[3:20:30.200 --> 3:20:38.280]  it is election night dot news election night dot news election night dot news election night
[3:20:38.280 --> 3:20:45.480]  dot news the problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites the most cunning smart
[3:20:46.040 --> 3:20:52.600]  inventive people believe that chivalry doesn't exist anymore they don't believe in being aristocrats
[3:20:53.160 --> 3:20:57.400]  trying to hold up civilization and power the people and once the establishment has that
[3:20:57.400 --> 3:21:02.120]  predatory idea civilization collapses very very quickly you can't treat the least of us
[3:21:02.840 --> 3:21:07.560]  like garbage and not treat your own family like that and so it is this lack of empathy that's
[3:21:07.560 --> 3:21:13.400]  going to destroy us the globalists can try to be heartless devil or spurs that commit rituals of
[3:21:13.960 --> 3:21:18.680]  all sorts of horrible crimes try to get away from a humanity but really they can't escape the laws
[3:21:18.680 --> 3:21:24.120]  of the universe they may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves but
[3:21:24.120 --> 3:21:28.680]  the repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and
[3:21:28.680 --> 3:21:33.960]  the very structure itself wealth is created by loving god wealth is created by having connection
[3:21:33.960 --> 3:21:39.560]  to god god is the source of all creation all success all power we deny that you'll be destroyed
[3:21:40.360 --> 3:21:46.280]  there are many references in the holy bible to the mustard seed and why is that it's one of the
[3:21:46.280 --> 3:21:52.920]  tiniest seeds out there but a giant tree like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds
[3:21:52.920 --> 3:21:58.760]  mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects they didn't know
[3:21:58.760 --> 3:22:05.240]  why well with modern science we know it's one of the purest cleanest organic forms of selenium
[3:22:05.800 --> 3:22:12.920]  we have bio true selenium sold out for months back in stock at info wars store dot com at 50

[3:22:51.000 --> 3:22:55.960]  spot that info wars has i've noticed that really informed people have this as well and i know a
[3:22:55.960 --> 3:23:00.360]  lot of you tuning in are some of the most performable out there so i want you to be retrospective
[3:23:00.360 --> 3:23:05.880]  and kind of examine yourself because that's what i do every day this hunter bite laptop is important
[3:23:05.880 --> 3:23:11.880]  but the new audio confirmed to be him where he admits he works under the communist chinese spy
[3:23:11.880 --> 3:23:19.560]  chief he should be arrested right now that is so huge that is hiding in plain view and it's getting
[3:23:19.560 --> 3:23:25.640]  almost no attention we have to get that information out to everybody it's all posted on info wars.com
[3:23:25.640 --> 3:23:31.640]  so many other major patriotic sites but we need to get it out to everybody and remember that we
[3:23:31.640 --> 3:23:36.200]  know all of this we knew it a long time ago so when it breaks now we kind of go okay tell us
[3:23:36.200 --> 3:23:45.000]  that we didn't know the point is now it's documented now it's proven you're listening to the alex
[3:23:45.000 --> 3:24:07.000]  jones show live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host nick
[3:24:07.000 --> 3:24:19.560]  baggage and welcome back and happy halloween uh from dr nick on uh this uh friday afternoon
[3:24:19.560 --> 3:24:28.280]  in most of the country i'm uh wearing my alex mask uh today and uh just laughing with you a
[3:24:28.280 --> 3:24:34.760]  little bit um you know when i think about what's going on in the world and i was at the aip convention
[3:24:34.760 --> 3:24:39.320]  we're we're talking about the deep state they and they gave me this t-shirt on maybe those guys can
[3:24:39.320 --> 3:24:47.880]  pop up a screenshot of that uh shirt somewhere on there where is it anyway you can see it there it is
[3:24:47.880 --> 3:24:53.080]  and it's uh you've got the visual image and it's a snake wrapped around the us i gotta take the mask
[3:24:53.080 --> 3:25:02.680]  off because now it's a snake wrapped around the us eating alaska right i mean uh and it's the aip
[3:25:02.680 --> 3:25:07.720]  convention and it's the deep safe represented by that snake and it's got its tail wrapped around
[3:25:07.720 --> 3:25:14.040]  the capital building and then it's looped around the us and then uh eating alaska right the last
[3:25:14.040 --> 3:25:19.480]  big bite and uh i want to talk about uh resources a bit i want to talk about the election a bit
[3:25:19.480 --> 3:25:24.600]  because you know that's a big deal right now and i want to talk about the deep safe from the standpoint
[3:25:24.600 --> 3:25:30.280]  of regulation and i kind of want to start that because this is one of the things that i think is
[3:25:30.280 --> 3:25:34.760]  one of the accomplishments of the trump administration that's not highlighted very much and it's something
[3:25:34.760 --> 3:25:42.360]  that needs a deeper dive into the deep state and that's regulatory uh agencies and the bureaucracy
[3:25:42.360 --> 3:25:48.440]  underneath the elected officials biggest frustration for elected officials is that right now um this
[3:25:48.440 --> 3:25:55.000]  week and this last several months my eldest son uh nicolas three has been uh campaign co-chair for
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:26:00.600]  congressman young from alaska and he's a big resource guy for alaska and i can tell you his
[3:26:00.600 --> 3:26:05.160]  biggest frustration has been the regulatory bureaucrats because they make the laws at the
[3:26:05.160 --> 3:26:11.880]  congressional level and then these bureaucrats set up all these regulations that have nothing to do
[3:26:11.880 --> 3:26:17.640]  with the intent of the law and then congress and the courts have to unravel them over decades
[3:26:17.640 --> 3:26:26.200]  because these parasites underneath that utilize their position and why say parasites not all public
[3:26:26.200 --> 3:26:31.640]  employees for sure most most are not in this category but the ones that are using it for the
[3:26:31.640 --> 3:26:37.640]  own private political agenda which is actually forbidden there's laws on the books at the
[3:26:37.640 --> 3:26:42.600]  national level federal employees aren't supposed to engage in a political agenda but they do
[3:26:42.600 --> 3:26:50.680]  you know uh and and and when they do it violates the rules consistently and constantly and as a
[3:26:50.680 --> 3:26:57.000]  consequence you end up with a whole set of rules that don't correlate to the rest of the world
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:27:03.000]  and this becomes uh the problem and that's the problem we're seeing today play out um again
[3:27:03.640 --> 3:27:11.080]  you know when you think about um upcoming uh uh events in terms of regulation what happens next
[3:27:11.080 --> 3:27:15.160]  you know this alexa is going to decide whether we're going to have a developmental strategy for
[3:27:15.160 --> 3:27:21.400]  the united states or the hide and biden strategy of not doing anything and fall back into the
[3:27:21.960 --> 3:27:28.600]  lackluster world of watching the us collapse because we have to remember in the global
[3:27:28.600 --> 3:27:34.440]  perspective of the globalists out there driving most of the politics for most nations in the world
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:40.440]  with the exception of a few who have different agendas um and and here's the thing about all
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:46.600]  those agendas they don't work for you and me they don't work for the info information warrior
[3:27:46.600 --> 3:27:54.120]  at all in fact they work against us most of the time and and here's the thing as as we're looking
[3:27:54.120 --> 3:28:01.240]  at the regulatory matrix and the next election at the executive level because that's where it's at
[3:28:01.240 --> 3:28:05.080]  through executive orders you can unknot a lot of that and we've seen that during the trump
[3:28:05.080 --> 3:28:12.040]  administration we saw some of that during obama too in a not so good of a direction but here's
[3:28:12.040 --> 3:28:17.720]  the thing is we have the opportunity now to make those changes and they have been made
[3:28:17.720 --> 3:28:22.360]  we have the opportunity right now to elect donald trump again and continue the progress
[3:28:22.360 --> 3:28:27.560]  in that direction for the next four years and i think it's incumbent on all of us to do it
[3:28:27.560 --> 3:28:33.880]  the t-shirt i'm wearing today uh the bureaucracy the deep state swallowing alaskan shutting us
[3:28:33.880 --> 3:28:39.800]  down we're the balance sheet for the nation we're the wealth of the nation coming up next week
[3:28:39.800 --> 3:28:44.200]  is the miners convention for alaskan free this year because it's a virtual event
[3:28:44.840 --> 3:28:51.320]  free normally it's a couple hundred dollars just to get in and so all the presentations on the
[3:28:51.320 --> 3:29:00.600]  alaska miners convention you can go to miners alaska miners with an s alaska miners dot org
[3:29:00.600 --> 3:29:05.800]  alaska miners dot org and you can register and sign up for free for the miners convention
[3:29:05.800 --> 3:29:11.480]  around tuesday afternoon my time and on eastern time just a little bit before eight o'clock i'm
[3:29:11.480 --> 3:29:19.160]  going to be making a presentation on my project in the wilderness to the miners convention but dial
[3:29:19.160 --> 3:29:25.160]  in and look at that and learn a lot about alaskan resources at least dial in for maybe the keynote
[3:29:25.160 --> 3:29:33.080]  address and some of the events but take a look uh alaska miners dot org and take a look at what
[3:29:33.080 --> 3:29:40.040]  we're doing uh in development in alaska you know the thing about all of this right now when we when
[3:29:40.040 --> 3:29:47.000]  we look at the crossroads we're on if we can begin to look at how do we develop the basis of wealth
[3:29:47.000 --> 3:29:52.280]  in the nation with the next administration and we need someone who can do a business plan
[3:29:52.280 --> 3:29:58.760]  and biden has had 48 years of the do nothing plan of politics because when all is you've
[3:29:58.760 --> 3:30:04.440]  done is politics well i guess he's done a little bit of business and we've been reading about it
[3:30:04.440 --> 3:30:09.400]  in the new york post and it's been dead silent almost everywhere else but i guess he's been
[3:30:09.400 --> 3:30:17.400]  doing private business too just not the kind you and i appreciate it's hiding biden's business
[3:30:17.400 --> 3:30:23.640]  which he hides also apparently because hiding biden bribery business is off the wrong one
[3:30:23.640 --> 3:30:30.280]  because no longer is he using the committees and contributions model he's using the brown bag model
[3:30:30.280 --> 3:30:39.720]  through his relative sad story is biden biden bribery scandal that's what we have right now
[3:30:39.720 --> 3:30:48.120]  in a half a century almost a half a century of bad behavior and bad governance and no practical
[3:30:48.120 --> 3:30:56.040]  experience and you know i i admit i admit this about donald trump he is ugly in the presentation
[3:30:56.040 --> 3:31:00.200]  you know can be pretty vulgar but i appreciate it because i know what he's had to deal with
[3:31:00.200 --> 3:31:06.680]  the most corrupt government in the country is new york new york state new york city
[3:31:06.680 --> 3:31:12.680]  look at that mess they have and how many times did the american public bailed that mess out
[3:31:12.680 --> 3:31:18.440]  and they want us to do it again look back in history look up new york bailouts and you'll
[3:31:18.440 --> 3:31:25.560]  see a whole laundry list up and yet we're not seeing anything happen uh dealing with that
[3:31:25.560 --> 3:31:31.400]  laundry list that's out there right now and you know when you think about all of the things
[3:31:31.400 --> 3:31:38.520]  happening in the country right now and it's a fight over the wealth of the nation starting
[3:31:38.520 --> 3:31:43.480]  with the leadership because here's the thing that everyone needs to remember in classical
[3:31:43.480 --> 3:31:51.480]  organizing you try and co-op called co-option co-op the leadership if you can take the leadership
[3:31:51.480 --> 3:32:01.240]  everyone else follows you see it's that simple and so there's a lot of effort channeled directly
[3:32:01.240 --> 3:32:10.520]  in like a fire hose to the leadership to corrupt them to break them to blackmail them later extort
[3:32:10.520 --> 3:32:16.920]  legislation waivers whatever it is you're looking for and this is what has happened so we have a
[3:32:16.920 --> 3:32:25.960]  corrupted elected layer and a corrupted bureaucratic layer and the same people are pushing against both
[3:32:25.960 --> 3:32:32.280]  against you and i and it is the deep state it is the snake coiled around the country
[3:32:33.320 --> 3:32:39.560]  and we have an opportunity in the next election cycle to dislodge it and to take a look at our
[3:32:39.560 --> 3:32:45.800]  possibilities our future possibilities again check out the miners convention all next week look at
[3:32:45.800 --> 3:32:53.160]  the agenda at uh alaska miners dot org that's the miners association up here in alaska and it's free
[3:32:53.160 --> 3:32:59.320]  free get a handle on some of what's going on up here because this is the treasury of the nation
[3:32:59.880 --> 3:33:05.880]  if we can take our minerals and resources from this treasury and begin to move them into the
[3:33:05.880 --> 3:33:11.960]  country to link up the rail system to set up the infrastructures that are necessary for the last
[3:33:11.960 --> 3:33:18.360]  frontier to become the first frontier the first frontier for freedom a different approach to
[3:33:18.360 --> 3:33:24.600]  what's going on in our world right now by recognizing what we have and the possibilities that are in
[3:33:24.600 --> 3:33:30.120]  front of us right now this is dr nick faggots you're listening to the info wars check out info

[3:38:13.640 --> 3:38:18.200]  and welcome back you know thinking about all of this stuff tonight while we're dealing with
[3:38:18.200 --> 3:38:25.400]  these days in the world and and i want to um i'm trying to keep tight into the election because
[3:38:25.400 --> 3:38:31.080]  it's coming up next tuesday we all need to focus on that as well but do not forget the
[3:38:31.080 --> 3:38:37.320]  accomplishments that have already been made and regulatory uh breaking down this bureaucracy
[3:38:37.320 --> 3:38:43.000]  is a critical element you know the amount of complexity small business people is enormous
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:48.760]  uh on the mining side you want to talk about complexity i'll show you some paperwork you
[3:38:48.760 --> 3:38:55.000]  know in the room next door i have like boxes and boxes of archival material just to get
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:39:00.520]  through my permitting process for my project out in the wilderness just for the roads and uh
[3:39:00.520 --> 3:39:06.840]  facilities that you need to put in the amount of regulation is phenomenal so cutting through the red
[3:39:06.840 --> 3:39:13.000]  hay um is a critical element in all of this and uh and making it make sense you know a lot of the
[3:39:13.000 --> 3:39:20.760]  regulation been put in as deliberate impositions to slow processes legitimate processes down and so
[3:39:20.760 --> 3:39:26.040]  the things that are happening there are the critical elements um to allow for growth you know you
[3:39:26.040 --> 3:39:34.360]  have to uh get the snake around the neck of the country uh and get a lask out of its mouth because
[3:39:34.360 --> 3:39:40.280]  here's the opportunities that are here it's not just hydrocarbons and oil and gas the opportunities
[3:39:40.280 --> 3:39:48.600]  in alaska are enormous what what is happening right now in alaska uh is a number of projects
[3:39:48.600 --> 3:39:54.440]  probably 20 major projects in various stages of development some of them like mine are called
[3:39:54.440 --> 3:39:59.240]  prospects are in the early stages where you're developing your data and building out your
[3:39:59.240 --> 3:40:04.920]  infrastructure improving up your values other are more matured and their permitting are about to go
[3:40:04.920 --> 3:40:10.920]  about to be green lit um for their next stage they finish their economic analyses which are
[3:40:10.920 --> 3:40:15.560]  really highly regulated for these public companies what they have to do before they
[3:40:15.560 --> 3:40:21.960]  go out and raise money from the public the next phase are the are the developmental stages where
[3:40:21.960 --> 3:40:30.120]  they start putting uh iron into the ground um and some of those are about to start donlan creek which
[3:40:30.120 --> 3:40:38.680]  is a six billion dollar project in southwest alaska this is a huge project um when they get that done
[3:40:38.680 --> 3:40:44.120]  it's going to open up an entire area of the state that's not had transportation corridor uh to tide
[3:40:44.120 --> 3:40:49.320]  water it has not had any kind of a linkage it's going to have a gas line and a road um so for the
[3:40:49.320 --> 3:40:56.680]  first time it's going to have power cheap energy on natural gas flowing 350 miles to that mine and
[3:40:56.680 --> 3:41:03.640]  that mine will use as much energy converted from that gas as the second largest city in alaska
[3:41:03.640 --> 3:41:10.120]  fairbanks uses on its peak production you know think about that one mine in alaska is going to
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:18.440]  use as much energy as the second largest city in the state you know that's huge okay that's one
[3:41:18.440 --> 3:41:24.600]  there's others that are being looked at across alaska from rarer sit tide water in southeast
[3:41:26.280 --> 3:41:35.080]  carbon up north graphite in particular graphite and graphene these are strategic metals minerals
[3:41:35.080 --> 3:41:43.560]  we have 10 molybdenum copper zinc gold silver platinum palladium on and on and on and and
[3:41:43.560 --> 3:41:50.920]  why is that important because these represent values that we hold as americans in common the
[3:41:50.920 --> 3:41:58.520]  areas that are on private property um like mine or on native land or on state land or on federal
[3:41:58.520 --> 3:42:04.680]  land have various rules for development and on federal land on on on certain federal lands you
[3:42:04.680 --> 3:42:11.400]  and i as americans uh if we're over the age of 18 can go out and make a location find something stake
[3:42:11.400 --> 3:42:17.880]  it uh and claim it and then develop it uh you can do all of that on the state level you can too on
[3:42:17.880 --> 3:42:23.400]  your private land of course if you have the mineral rights you can too and this is what's
[3:42:23.400 --> 3:42:27.880]  important is a lot of people understand the stratification of rights you own your home in
[3:42:27.880 --> 3:42:33.480]  most parts of the western states you own the surface estate you own what's on the top of the
[3:42:33.480 --> 3:42:39.240]  ground to build your home and a few feet under but the mineral estate is reserved to someone else
[3:42:39.240 --> 3:42:44.600]  usually the government uh unless it was taken years and years ago in homesteads and things where
[3:42:44.600 --> 3:42:50.680]  mineral estates were allowed to flow an energy estate toiling gas because most energy in the west
[3:42:50.680 --> 3:42:58.600]  is owned by governments and most of the uh mineral rights are also owned by governments uh now
[3:42:58.600 --> 3:43:03.560]  native organizations tribal governments they own their mineral rights and energy rights
[3:43:03.560 --> 3:43:10.040]  native corporations have theirs intact in alaska um when you look at the state rights
[3:43:10.040 --> 3:43:14.840]  theirs are intact and how they regulate them is up to state jurisdiction and on the federal level
[3:43:14.840 --> 3:43:20.040]  some are in parks and preserves which are excluded right now from development and that was one of
[3:43:20.040 --> 3:43:25.160]  the tricks of early legislation that my dad was involved in and then when he disappeared others
[3:43:25.160 --> 3:43:31.880]  were involved in but what happened here in alaska is the minerals were always the thrust
[3:43:31.880 --> 3:43:39.480]  democrats republicans agreed on that here most still do except for these crazy democrats show
[3:43:39.480 --> 3:43:44.440]  up from somewhere else mainly california with some other idea of what it ought to look like
[3:43:45.480 --> 3:43:52.200]  you know it it's like such a weirdness of what we've seen happen in main party politics at the
[3:43:52.200 --> 3:43:57.000]  national level the democrats have become the party of the weirdos and the republicans you know
[3:43:57.000 --> 3:44:02.360]  when they bring out their mainstream candidates they don't look so good but donald trump reformed
[3:44:02.360 --> 3:44:07.320]  the republican party made it a working man and a business party small business party
[3:44:07.320 --> 3:44:14.760]  wow what a change you know that's a change he hijacked the republicans and hijacked the american
[3:44:14.760 --> 3:44:20.840]  public into a program that we can actually start to believe in again and i hope it continues another
[3:44:20.840 --> 3:44:28.920]  four years and people do your last push if you haven't voted go vote now vote now what if you
[3:44:28.920 --> 3:44:34.840]  have an earthquake on tuesday or hurricane blow through your community on tuesday vote right now
[3:44:35.800 --> 3:44:40.200]  do it right now because it's important to get it done do it over the weekend do it on monday don't
[3:44:40.200 --> 3:44:44.840]  wait for tuesday your states are opened up where you can do early voting go stand in line
[3:44:44.840 --> 3:44:52.840]  of vote early i'm going to my fiance is going to it's important to vote early because you don't
[3:44:52.840 --> 3:44:58.200]  want to be missed in the count this time for sure and you don't want anything getting your way on
[3:44:58.200 --> 3:45:06.600]  monday a kid getting sick or anything else vote that's where the power still is for the moment
[3:45:06.600 --> 3:45:14.040]  uh this may be the last chance you know after this cycle because man the propaganda cycle
[3:45:14.600 --> 3:45:24.760]  the uh surveillance state coupled with the deep state is going to give us a radical change if we
[3:45:24.760 --> 3:45:31.960]  don't show up this election cycle it's absolutely critical it even if you are looking at this thing
[3:45:31.960 --> 3:45:40.040]  and say he's not the best i don't i don't agree for this reason he's not the prettiest but he is
[3:45:40.040 --> 3:45:47.240]  the best for right now for what we're facing right now and sometimes as alex said in that in that last
[3:45:47.240 --> 3:45:53.160]  segment as we were listening softer voice you know a softer voice some people listen well
[3:45:54.200 --> 3:46:01.080]  sometimes it's it's important to carry a baseball bat and have a very loud voice because you got to
[3:46:01.080 --> 3:46:06.520]  get people's attention donald trump has done that when he wins the second election which i believe
[3:46:06.520 --> 3:46:15.000]  will happen on tuesday he can soften the voice and carry the club because there isn't anything
[3:46:15.880 --> 3:46:23.640]  left to yell about he's got four years the front end the program and a two-year midterm cycle to
[3:46:23.640 --> 3:46:28.360]  maybe change out a little of congress and that's where the emphasis should be ladies and gentlemen
[3:46:28.360 --> 3:46:36.600]  in taking america back and holding it okay because when this term is up in four years who's coming
[3:46:36.600 --> 3:46:42.440]  next who's the next guy up that you're going to believe in that isn't another one of these deep
[3:46:42.440 --> 3:46:49.320]  state insiders this can unravel the knot again so we need to pay attention now we need to get a lot
[3:46:49.320 --> 3:46:55.560]  of work done now there's a supreme court installed now that's going to be there now for the next 30
[3:46:55.560 --> 3:47:03.080]  years so at least that piece of the government has been preserved as a balanced piece to take
[3:47:03.080 --> 3:47:08.120]  conservative view of what that constitution means which i think is an appropriate because
[3:47:08.120 --> 3:47:15.160]  constitution should be interpreted clearly as it was written and if it needs to be changed see we
[3:47:15.160 --> 3:47:22.120]  allow for that in this country and what the left is forgotten is it was designed as a living document
[3:47:22.120 --> 3:47:28.680]  there's been many amendments since the first ten the bill of rights you see because in our country
[3:47:29.320 --> 3:47:35.000]  in the united states we recognize that we learn more about ourselves as a nation as individuals
[3:47:35.000 --> 3:47:40.680]  and we change and we have when we started out as a nation had to be a property owner to vote
[3:47:41.240 --> 3:47:46.840]  and then you didn't have and then you had to be a white man to vote and then you didn't have to
[3:47:46.840 --> 3:47:54.200]  be be a black man too and then after that you could be a woman and a man and vote no matter
