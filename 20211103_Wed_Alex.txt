[00:00.000 --> 00:29.880]  Okay, smoking done documents have come out that the FDA knew that the Pfizer shop was
[00:29.880 --> 00:34.080]  causing microcarditis and heart attacks at a very high level and suppressed it they've
[00:34.080 --> 00:37.680]  all got to be arrested now and if they aren't arrested soon we'll have to go to citizens
[00:37.680 --> 00:42.720]  arrest or because it's on us or now I'm coming after the children we've got that we've got
[00:42.720 --> 00:46.720]  the lawyer involved with the documents coming out joining us at the bottom of the hour we
[00:46.720 --> 00:50.840]  have the huge developments in New Jersey and Virginia the Democrats are trying to steal
[00:50.840 --> 00:56.000]  it by the landslide they're in New Jersey too big a landslide for them to steal it in
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.680]  Virginia that's all coming up the FBI got caught suppressing information on written
[01:00.680 --> 01:04.360]  house that showed that he was being shot at they have the footage that's coming out just
[01:04.360 --> 01:09.720]  unbelievable behavior but here's a key report by the great Greg Reese dealing with knowing
[01:09.720 --> 01:24.800]  your enemy enemy one that is antagonistic to another something harmful or deadly for those
[01:24.800 --> 01:32.440]  with eyes to see humanity is currently under attack by an antagonistic and deadly foe an
[01:32.440 --> 01:39.200]  enemy that must hide in the shadows to survive but there is always a money trail and money
[01:39.200 --> 01:46.080]  is their only real power so to find the real enemy we must follow the money in the documentary
[01:46.080 --> 01:52.880]  monopoly who owns the world Tim Geelen does an excellent job of doing this while there
[01:52.880 --> 01:58.560]  appears to be hundreds of independent companies producing food they are practically all owned
[01:58.560 --> 02:05.440]  by the same small group of companies these companies are controlled by their top shareholders
[02:05.440 --> 02:13.480]  financial institutions such as Berkshire Hathaway Vanguard Black Rock and State Street this is
[02:13.480 --> 02:22.400]  also who owns Silicon Valley big tech the airline industry the steel industry agriculture
[02:22.400 --> 02:30.440]  the textile and clothing industry both the oil and solar panel industry tobacco alcohol
[02:30.440 --> 02:37.240]  pharmaceutical electronics and banking just about everything in today's modern world is
[02:37.240 --> 02:45.000]  owned and controlled by these same financial institutions who are also invested in each
[02:45.000 --> 02:53.280]  other forming a pyramid of financial power topped by Black Rock and Vanguard Black Rock
[02:53.280 --> 03:00.680]  loans money to the Federal Reserve Bank advises them and developed their software system Black
[03:00.680 --> 03:08.000]  Rock itself is owned by Vanguard and Vanguard sitting on top of the world pyramid keeps
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.720]  its shareholders private but we know that the majority of wealth has been accumulated
[03:13.720 --> 03:19.920]  by inheritance and monopoly and the same few families have owned most of the world for
[03:19.920 --> 03:31.480]  generations families such as Rothschild Rockefeller DuPont Morgan and Bush operating through nonprofit
[03:31.480 --> 03:39.000]  foundations these unelected families are able to rule over the world like Kings this is
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.960]  the way it has always been whether it be via Pharaoh royalty Papal supremacy dictator or
[03:46.960 --> 03:53.680]  investment banker mankind has always been managed by the rich and powerful freedom is
[03:53.680 --> 04:00.600]  a dream yet to be fully realized in this world after the American Revolution our forefathers
[04:00.600 --> 04:06.280]  gave us the tools to realize this dream of self-governance in the Constitution and the
[04:06.280 --> 04:14.360]  Bill of Rights tools that will be stripped away unless mankind decides to stand and face their
[04:14.360 --> 04:20.480]  enemy here we need a vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private
[04:20.480 --> 04:30.480]  sector with trillions at his disposal far beyond global GDP and with the greatest respect beyond
[04:30.480 --> 04:37.280]  even the governments of the world's leaders it offers the only real prospect of achieving

[06:08.320 --> 06:21.160]  oh baby I'm gonna teach you what love's all about tonight
[06:21.160 --> 06:32.760]  trust me honey everything's gonna be alright I have an incredible conviction on my heart
[06:32.760 --> 06:39.040]  on my mind on my soul deep down inside I'm gonna have to take action and that means
[06:39.040 --> 06:44.600]  political that means nonviolent but that means civil disobedience and then if they
[06:44.600 --> 06:49.400]  try to physically attack us and tell us and put us in prison I don't know what we do because we
[06:49.400 --> 06:55.000]  cannot let them sit there and attack our children and attack our little babies like this it's just
[06:55.000 --> 07:03.000]  incredible you know I'm not an enemy of the US Army or the US Air Force or the Marines or the
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.680]  Navy I'm not an enemy of the Coast Guard not an enemy of the FBI not an enemy of the local
[07:08.680 --> 07:14.320]  police department I'm not an enemy of the Catholic Church I'm not an enemy of the Muslims not a
[07:14.320 --> 07:22.280]  enemy of Billy Graham Jr but I am an enemy of evil people and institutions that are in control
[07:22.280 --> 07:29.400]  of most organizations and I cannot sit here and watch them commit these crimes against humanity
[07:29.400 --> 07:36.920]  and live with myself so I know things are bad hell Alex Jones you would say is a quite the
[07:36.920 --> 07:43.240]  pessimist it's actually opposite I'm an optimist I believe we can beat this tyranny but when I see
[07:43.240 --> 07:47.440]  things come out that are now confirmed that the FBI had HD footage of course they were
[07:47.440 --> 07:57.720]  surveilling everybody that day and drone footage with infrared, clear footage of Kyle Rittenhouse
[07:57.720 --> 08:03.240]  being shot at repeatedly before he defended himself they didn't just have guns in their
[08:03.240 --> 08:06.840]  hands waving them out they were chasing them and shooting at him while they were burning
[08:06.840 --> 08:17.760]  down buildings and they all had rap sheets as long as my arm and the FBI sat on bombshell
[08:17.760 --> 08:24.840]  footage from Kyle Rittenhouse shooting that he was being shot at and retreating because the
[08:24.840 --> 08:29.400]  one crime in the New World Order is defending yourself from the criminal state and its minions
[08:29.400 --> 08:37.320]  like Antifa a pack of pedophiles and others that were chasing him down the street I mean of course
[08:37.320 --> 08:41.640]  the first guy he shot was a convicted child rapist who kidnapped and raped what was it a
[08:41.640 --> 08:51.880]  seven-year-old boy repeatedly and then the rap sheets just continue from there scum of the earth
[08:51.880 --> 09:01.120]  Kyle Rittenhouse did a better job than most train police officers live in that situation that's
[09:01.120 --> 09:06.240]  why it's got to be punished because goodness has to be punished now I got a lot of huge
[09:06.240 --> 09:09.400]  news today and once you hear this news you'll think well why is the Rittenhouse story the
[09:09.400 --> 09:20.080]  first thing you talked about well you can hear the thunder you can feel the rumble across the
[09:20.080 --> 09:29.080]  world of God's anger because powerful private central banks have created unlimited currency for
[09:29.080 --> 09:37.840]  themselves and they've used that to basically buy off almost everyone and so even people that
[09:37.840 --> 09:45.960]  aren't involved in the burning down buildings or the raping of children or the medical testing on
[09:45.960 --> 09:51.440]  newborn babies while they're still alive they're not physically doing it themselves but they know
[09:51.440 --> 10:02.880]  what's going on and they're protecting that system and they've made themselves the bad guys now
[10:02.880 --> 10:07.480]  that doesn't mean that the entire FBI headquarters is our enemy doesn't mean they're all evil men
[10:07.480 --> 10:11.680]  and women inside there but the people running it are bad and you can count that it's a bad
[10:11.680 --> 10:21.000]  institution you can believe that it's evil and lies and fights for the forces of darkness when
[10:21.000 --> 10:28.800]  it counts and that's sad because we don't we need good federal law enforcement and there are still
[10:28.800 --> 10:35.920]  some good people there hell most secret service or FBI or federal marshals I run into or big
[10:35.920 --> 10:41.160]  listeners and say hey we're all awake it's the higher ups I know that but it's always the key
[10:41.160 --> 10:50.960]  people that are always at the key spots isn't it like Kenosha or Oklahoma City or January 6 or the
[10:50.960 --> 10:55.760]  plot to kidnap governor Whitmer that was run by the FBI I mean it's the same damn story I mean the
[10:55.760 --> 11:02.160]  feds the Southern Prairie Law Center connected type groups have packs of white supremacists
[11:02.160 --> 11:09.960]  running around in the state of Texas threatening me while they run around telling the public they
[11:09.960 --> 11:18.360]  work for me and then while they're out burning giant swastikas for YouTube connecting my name to
[11:18.360 --> 11:24.720]  it the local synagogue gets fire bombed I mean that's the level I'm at and you know what I count
[11:24.720 --> 11:30.320]  the fact that I'm gonna face the globalist armies and on the left it's anti-phone the right it's
[11:30.320 --> 11:34.440]  the Nazis they both work for the feds it's come out that almost every white supremacist group is
[11:34.440 --> 11:40.280]  led by the feds and any militia group it's not engaged in constitutional behavior turns out's
[11:40.280 --> 11:47.120]  led by the feds in almost every case I mean it the FBI and an ATF has such an evil record of
[11:47.120 --> 11:55.240]  leading bad organizations it's just it's downright shameful more importantly that it's damn right
[11:55.240 --> 12:05.600]  gotta stop now I got a big guess for you today and I'm just like I said gonna shoot you straight
[12:05.600 --> 12:11.640]  on this I started reading this yesterday afternoon and then story after story broke from documents
[12:11.640 --> 12:19.760]  that I'm somebody that sleeps pretty good I want to bed early last night about 10 p.m. but I woke up
[12:19.760 --> 12:24.400]  about 3 a.m. and couldn't go back to sleep because of this because I had a responsibility even though
[12:24.400 --> 12:28.720]  I don't want to read this because I know it means I'm gonna have to take action against it but I
[12:28.720 --> 12:34.480]  wanted to read every bit of it just to make sure it was entirely accurate and in the process of
[12:34.480 --> 12:40.680]  doing three hours of research from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. before my youngest daughter woke up and I
[12:40.680 --> 12:48.360]  made her breakfast early and we I read books at the breakfast table I discovered a whole bunch of
[12:48.360 --> 12:53.400]  other out in the open period but just hiding in plain view and by discovered just on in full
[12:53.400 --> 12:57.400]  wars and searching around and reading articles and how we've been going to the drugs report just
[12:57.400 --> 13:02.800]  had a bunch of it in our face so let me tell you what I'm going to be covering here today okay
[13:02.800 --> 13:09.440]  because it's not just the FBI covering up they were trying to kill Cal written house and chasing
[13:09.440 --> 13:15.240]  them with guns shooting at him not just stuff like that it's the whole FDA and the whole government
[13:15.240 --> 13:24.800]  coming at our children with something designed to ruin their lives and you can say well I mean
[13:24.800 --> 13:31.240]  look at the FDA and CDC boards a whole bunch of them resigned yeah for four months last time I
[13:31.240 --> 13:36.360]  counted over a hundred board members are resigned out of those two agencies including the two head
[13:36.360 --> 13:43.280]  people over vaccines one have been there 30 years other than their 15 number one and number two
[13:43.280 --> 13:49.160]  people and they said you shouldn't give boosters this vaccine doesn't work and you shouldn't give it
[13:49.160 --> 13:57.400]  under 16 this crossing a Rubicon to go out with children they don't have free will to sign on
[13:57.400 --> 14:01.480]  to something you know adults can take fentanyl adults can blow their brains out adults can decide
[14:01.480 --> 14:05.160]  to have sex with a bunch of people without protection you know adults can decide to destroy
[14:05.160 --> 14:09.920]  themselves you have free will but children aren't of the age and every culture agrees with that and
[14:09.920 --> 14:17.840]  it's all on us if we don't stop this so let me tell you what the new news is and each one of these
[14:17.840 --> 14:23.880]  I could do a whole four-hour show on but we don't have the time to do that but we're gonna try FDA
[14:23.880 --> 14:29.040]  knew about numerous adverse events for children related to Pfizer vaccine approved it anyways
[14:29.040 --> 14:34.600]  and covered up illnesses including deaths and I told you with Robert Barnes three weeks ago on
[14:34.600 --> 14:38.840]  air that it was gonna break in Texas in a few weeks and I told you I thought it would break on
[14:38.840 --> 14:43.560]  Monday instead it broke on Tuesday and now Barnes who's involved in the case that he's
[14:43.560 --> 14:49.200]  actually his client is gonna be coming on the show bottom of the hour in about 15 minutes so
[14:49.200 --> 14:55.000]  there's that giant area of the trials that took place in multiple states but heavily in Texas in
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.400]  Illinois we got the numbers for you let's move on from that science are this is even bigger this
[15:01.400 --> 15:07.480]  is a major prestigious medical journal that an in-depth study vaccine spike protein inner cell
[15:07.480 --> 15:14.400]  nucleus suppresses DNA repair engine will unleash explosion in cancer immunodeficiency autoimmune
[15:14.400 --> 15:19.680]  disorders and accelerated aging and this is a hundred percent confirmed in the study that it
[15:19.680 --> 15:27.640]  doesn't just alter your DNA yet irrevocably sabotages it and either either will kill the cell
[15:27.640 --> 15:32.080]  when it becomes time to replicate or will cause cancer it's all right here this is just we can
[15:32.080 --> 15:38.640]  just stop the presses here we've got that whole study for you but then meanwhile we got something
[15:38.640 --> 15:44.800]  even worse when we come back okay it's it's it's it's even worse we have this from the NIH's own
[15:44.800 --> 15:53.160]  website that upwards of 50 plus percent of children will die when they develop microcarditis 56
[15:53.160 --> 16:03.960]  percent will die within a few years stay with us if you're concerned about the it's now becoming
[16:03.960 --> 16:10.600]  accepted knowledge accepted fact that global government run by private corporations is taking
[16:10.600 --> 16:15.480]  over the United States and other formerly sovereign nations they're being destroyed all the checks
[16:15.480 --> 16:19.880]  and balances are being annihilated our borders are being destroyed our currencies being destroyed
[16:19.880 --> 16:24.920]  and the American people have been listed as terrorist by the rogue federal government info

[16:28.720 --> 16:32.240]  of beating these people but we're not going to be able to stay on air unless you support us and

[18:14.840 --> 18:21.200]  symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge it is the symbol that we are
[18:21.200 --> 18:27.360]  diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the
[18:27.360 --> 18:36.840]  sun it is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil ladies and gentlemen
[18:36.840 --> 18:44.640]  we are crossing the rubicon now the entire future destiny of humanity is upon us plows swab and the
[18:44.640 --> 18:48.800]  you and admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the world ID and carbon
[18:48.800 --> 18:55.280]  taxes things only get worse from here if we submit they only get better if we resist and say no
[18:55.280 --> 19:02.880]  non-compliance non-compliance non-compliance I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart
[19:02.880 --> 19:09.040]  deep in my soul I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet I've had a lot of loss like everybody
[19:09.040 --> 19:20.080]  else has and it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and
[19:20.080 --> 19:28.480]  bled and sweat for and now we're just throwing it all away and I see the general public in a
[19:28.480 --> 19:36.120]  medically induced scientifically induced behavioral psychologically controlled tranqui and I know
[19:36.120 --> 19:42.480]  we're being fed into this globalist be grounded it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of
[19:42.480 --> 19:49.240]  birth and then growth and then falling apart and then deteriorating and collapsing and then coming
[19:49.240 --> 19:54.920]  back to life again it's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process
[19:54.920 --> 20:03.720]  of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it you're listening to the Alex
[20:03.720 --> 20:20.360]  Jones show
[20:20.360 --> 20:37.960]  all right we are back live broadcasting worldwide I'm your host Alex Jones let me go over those
[20:37.960 --> 20:44.680]  numbers again that's probably a shocking number you heard me lay out there up to 56% of children
[20:44.680 --> 20:51.240]  that develop myocarditis will die of it I'm going to read you from the NIH website and now we're
[20:51.240 --> 21:01.880]  learning that a large percentage of children in the trials got myocarditis and some even had heart
[21:01.880 --> 21:07.720]  attacks and there were deaths but they're trying to now spin it and say oh it was unrelated because
[21:07.720 --> 21:11.400]  they're not looking for death they just say that's not part of it because I guess you can't die from
[21:11.400 --> 21:16.360]  it of course you do and how many soccer players are you seeing that took the shot that I now had
[21:16.360 --> 21:22.680]  heart attacks another one yesterday there was one the day before that top stars in Europe both took
[21:22.680 --> 21:32.520]  the Pfizer shot one of them had a heart attack the other myocarditis here it is FDA knew about
[21:32.520 --> 21:39.720]  numerous adverse events for children related to Pfizer vaccine approved it anyway we're going to be
[21:39.720 --> 21:43.880]  getting to that with Bob Barnes next segment now here's the really big one I'm going to cover at
[21:43.880 --> 21:49.400]  the start of the next hour science horror and I went and read the whole study and checked it and
[21:49.400 --> 21:55.320]  it feeds into all the research we have already I wish this wasn't true I don't like being vindicated
[21:55.320 --> 22:01.240]  like this this is worse than I thought vaccine spike protein intercells nuclei suppresses DNA
[22:01.240 --> 22:07.560]  repair engine will unleash explosion of cancer email deficiency autoimmune disorders and accelerated
[22:07.560 --> 22:12.840]  aging and in fact guys I forgot to tell you print me the study that's linked in there I saw you put
[22:12.840 --> 22:18.760]  it on screen printed for me thank you from a very prestigious journal that stories on info wars.com
[22:18.760 --> 22:24.920]  natural news broke it FDA approved first oral blood thinning medications for children ahead
[22:24.920 --> 22:29.640]  of vaccine rollout for ages five to 11 because now these shovel billboards everywhere on buses
[22:29.640 --> 22:34.760]  and side of the road saying hey children having heart attacks and strokes is totally normal get
[22:34.760 --> 22:44.120]  used to it it's the new normal now here's the big giant enchilada and you know just as I read this on
[22:44.120 --> 22:50.360]  dr. Gina's website respected person I don't just go with it I went to the NIH website and sure as
[22:50.360 --> 22:56.360]  hell it was there I'm gonna show it to you if a five-year-old develops mild myocarditis there is
[22:56.360 --> 23:02.760]  a 50-50 chance they won't live to see their 15th birthday this is what we're doing to our children
[23:02.760 --> 23:07.880]  for political statement well it's a little bit more than that and let me read to you now from the
[23:07.880 --> 23:21.800]  NIH website non fulminate active myocarditis has a mortality rate of 25% to 56% within three to 10
[23:21.800 --> 23:28.920]  years owing to progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death well that's not very fun
[23:28.920 --> 23:36.040]  and would you like me to continue because I got stuff just as bad as this you talk the whole
[23:36.040 --> 23:42.680]  show about that and how in the CDC and FDA's on document in October last year they said we predict
[23:42.680 --> 23:53.400]  myocarditis at high levels yeah now the reporting 86% in the studies had a bad effect and they
[23:53.400 --> 24:03.480]  suppressed it that's in the documents wow 86% of children member member bill gates
[24:05.480 --> 24:10.840]  17 months ago was on NBC news we probably played it 30 times till people got sick of it we got we
[24:10.840 --> 24:16.920]  got complaints that we try to find it bill gates held Joe Rogan put it on his instagram
[24:16.920 --> 24:25.640]  you can find it there from last last October 80% of those that took Pfizer shot or those
[24:25.640 --> 24:34.360]  that took covid vax was the headline had serious side effects or serious reaction and then they
[24:34.360 --> 24:39.480]  said that's not true when jones said that on rogan so rogan just put out the actual clip of it that
[24:39.480 --> 24:42.760]  i'd actually provided on the show that they played didn't matter we played it on the show
[24:42.760 --> 24:51.560]  people said oh it's not true now there it is oh look four and a half million views till they killed
[24:51.560 --> 24:57.240]  the spread of it how was it dinner with Joe a few weeks ago he put out another instagram it got one
[24:57.240 --> 25:01.560]  million views in 10 minutes two million by the end of dinner and then they just froze it where you
[25:01.560 --> 25:04.840]  couldn't number didn't go up people were still watching it they just didn't want you know 100
[25:04.840 --> 25:09.960]  200 million on the link just like they've got internal numbers on my one particular interview
[25:09.960 --> 25:13.000]  with Joe episode 1255
[25:17.400 --> 25:26.040]  or was it uh 2005 i forget the exact number it had over 80 million views just on the actual show
[25:26.040 --> 25:31.800]  not the 30 million views they claim that's what scares them but anyways i'm i'm salivating over
[25:31.800 --> 25:37.880]  being able to reach the public and warn them um oh let's continue icelandic soccer player 28
[25:37.880 --> 25:44.600]  requires resuscitation after heart stops mid game but but you know what and it turns out
[25:44.600 --> 25:49.320]  of course he took the shot let's go ahead though and go back to that instagram you guys found so
[25:49.320 --> 25:54.680]  quickly great job and now you did that in 15 seconds with the four and a half million views
[25:56.440 --> 26:00.120]  speaking people the headlines they can go to Joe rogan's instagram and look at it and share it for
[26:00.120 --> 26:05.800]  yourselves i forget the exact headline let's we're thinking about instagram what's the headline on it
[26:05.800 --> 26:11.240]  he says i knew people were going to criticize the content of the podcast without even listening to
[26:11.240 --> 26:16.120]  it and i was right that's why i fact-checked every single crazy thing he said and all of them were
[26:16.120 --> 26:21.160]  verified people have said he spreads anti-common vaccine conspiracy theories because he said 80
[26:21.160 --> 26:26.360]  percent of people who were given one of the vaccines got sick here's the video bill gates
[26:26.360 --> 26:33.880]  admitting it himself now i'm not any vaccine and it goes on so there it is and and then there's the
[26:33.880 --> 26:41.400]  and and then there's the clip and now ooh what did the FDA suppress ooh 86 percent of the children
[26:41.400 --> 26:49.560]  had adverse effects and then now the head of the FDA the head of the cdc had the cdc
[26:49.560 --> 26:55.640]  correction she was on tv again saying it's totally safe and 96 effective they now admit
[26:55.640 --> 27:01.720]  that it's not 96 effective that it's down to below 30 within a few months with just the
[27:01.720 --> 27:08.920]  Pfizer alone same thing with the other vaccines the than our vaccines and that there are all
[27:08.920 --> 27:13.640]  these horrible problems and she just sits there in lies because we're genetically meant to see a
[27:13.640 --> 27:19.400]  middle-aged woman and trust them because on average middle-aged women commit about 2 percent of the
[27:19.400 --> 27:27.320]  crime men ages 15 to 60 commit almost all the violent crime other things like that but see the
[27:27.320 --> 27:31.080]  globalists have recruited women now to commit crime so those numbers have changed even in the
[27:31.080 --> 27:35.960]  statistics you can look them up women are murdering killing lying stealing everything now way worse
[27:35.960 --> 27:40.520]  than they used to and this woman is paid millions of dollars she's a former big pharma executive
[27:40.520 --> 27:46.520]  and she'll sit up there in a cute little blue dress like she's jackie kennedy and oh it's just
[27:46.520 --> 27:52.520]  so good for our little pumpkins nobody ever had a problem it totally protects you from the shots
[27:53.080 --> 27:56.760]  so you get your little sweeties all dressed up and take them right down there to the clinic
[27:56.760 --> 28:00.120]  now your doctor won't give it to you for some reason just because he doesn't have liability
[28:00.120 --> 28:05.800]  protection but the big pharma does you just drop by walmart or cvs or walgreens and roll up the
[28:05.800 --> 28:14.440]  little sleevey weebie and it'll be off to see jesus and a jippy i mean it's just i sat there and
[28:14.440 --> 28:21.000]  watched that this morning and i my heart actually grew very cold towards that woman not not hatred
[28:21.000 --> 28:29.000]  i was like how dare you do this and how how dare i not fight harder we just can't let them do this
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.280]  and see that's the hobson's choice that's the catch 22 that's the no win situation
[28:34.280 --> 28:39.320]  they want an uprising they want physical violence and then if we don't stop them they're just going
[28:39.320 --> 28:47.000]  to continue to kill the shoulder right in front of us all i can say is johnny cash is right you can

[32:09.320 --> 32:15.400]  system that they're pushing cannot coexist with it's very very simple for their world government
[32:15.400 --> 32:21.960]  their anti-human post-human eugenics system to flourish freedom and liberty and due process
[32:21.960 --> 32:28.920]  injustice and god fearing systems must fail so sure you didn't start a fight with bill gates
[32:28.920 --> 32:35.000]  you didn't start a fight with david rockfeller you didn't start a fight with the un they started
[32:35.000 --> 32:39.960]  a fight with you and they're not going to back down and they're not going to go away
[32:39.960 --> 32:45.480]  and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of god put into them
[32:46.040 --> 32:50.200]  the average person still doesn't even know about the new world order or about globalism
[32:50.200 --> 32:54.840]  or about corporate fascism and it's not until people understand that and that we're under
[32:54.840 --> 33:10.760]  attack we have any chance of beating these people you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:10.760 --> 33:20.760]  you
[33:21.960 --> 33:30.680]  you can run on for a long time run on for a long time run on for a long time
[33:32.440 --> 33:37.800]  wow the thunder is rolling above the studio big storms outside while this song plays
[33:37.800 --> 33:45.160]  go tell that long-tongue liar certainly gives it to a little more ambiance doesn't it tell the
[33:45.160 --> 33:52.280]  rambler the gambler the back fighter tell them it god's gonna cut him down tell them it god's
[33:52.280 --> 33:57.560]  gonna cut him down all right robber barns rarely uh flakes out on the show unless he has some
[33:57.560 --> 34:00.360]  emergency come up and i know he's up there working on the call written house case so
[34:01.000 --> 34:04.280]  knowing him will probably pop in in the next five minutes or so but we've got the news now
[34:04.280 --> 34:09.400]  i'm able to talk about it so it's just interesting to have the lawyer on the case with us uh he told
[34:09.400 --> 34:14.760]  me him over a month ago and he was here in texas working on court cases behind the scenes filing
[34:14.760 --> 34:19.560]  things that they had whistleblowers that worked on the trials and they were going out and getting
[34:19.560 --> 34:25.320]  witnesses uh and the actual victims uh as part of what's going on behind the scenes and now it's
[34:25.320 --> 34:32.200]  come out falsified data Pfizer vaccine trial had major flaws whistleblower tells peer reviewed
[34:32.200 --> 34:38.040]  journal so we've got the rest of the story about that fda knew about numerous adverse events
[34:38.040 --> 34:44.600]  for children related to Pfizer vaccines and as i showed you earlier on screen 86 had adverse
[34:44.600 --> 34:55.480]  reactions and it was covered up in the last year so think about that they knew before they ever did
[34:55.480 --> 34:59.400]  the trials because remember they skipped main trials then it did trials deer eating it for
[34:59.400 --> 35:03.880]  children they already had trials they'd done and found 80 plus percent adverse reactions
[35:03.880 --> 35:10.040]  and then they did it with children and found 86 percent a similar number and then suppress that
[35:10.040 --> 35:15.880]  it's absolutely incredible so i'm going to get into that study and more here in just a moment
[35:17.480 --> 35:25.480]  but first i want to play a very important piece of information from robert f kennedy junior
[35:25.480 --> 35:30.520]  making a desperate plea for the world to resist the tyranny being implemented in the name of
[35:30.520 --> 35:36.520]  coveted and warning that we are now in nazi territory and that's not an exaggeration that
[35:36.520 --> 35:40.440]  you know that's why they're busy calling milk toast republicans nazis and calling anybody that
[35:40.440 --> 35:44.760]  wants to control the borders nazis or you don't want to give a half a million dollars to people
[35:44.760 --> 35:50.040]  separated from their parents the border for even five minutes uh money you're a nazi while we've
[35:50.040 --> 35:56.680]  got real nazi stuff here total nurenberg violation stuff they know is poisonous stuff they know is
[35:56.680 --> 36:02.200]  causing irrevocable damage and they're doing it on purpose so i don't think we're in nazi territory
[36:02.200 --> 36:09.320]  we're in the nazi capital here folks we're we're in nazi land and quite frankly it's being done
[36:09.320 --> 36:14.040]  on a larger scale so we're beyond the nazis here because they're going after everybody the nazis
[36:14.040 --> 36:18.840]  only went after certain groups and that was bad this is just depopulation on a mass scale it's
[36:18.840 --> 36:27.560]  psychotic and here is a robert kennedy jr my father told me when i was a child people in authority lie
[36:29.320 --> 36:37.080]  and we all if we are going to continue to live in a democracy we need to understand that people
[36:37.080 --> 36:45.480]  in authority lie people in authority will abuse every power that we relinquish to them and right
[36:45.480 --> 36:52.760]  now we are giving them the power to micromanage every bit of our lives 24 hours a day they're
[36:52.760 --> 36:57.480]  going to know where we are we're going to know the money that we spend they're going to have
[36:57.480 --> 37:05.240]  access to our children they're going to have the right to compel unwanted medical interventions
[37:05.240 --> 37:12.360]  on us we you know the nazis did that in the camps in world war two they tested vaccines on
[37:12.360 --> 37:20.600]  gypsies and jews and the world was so horrified after the war we signed the nuremberg charter
[37:21.640 --> 37:30.040]  and we all pledge when we do that we would never again impose unwanted medical interventions on
[37:30.040 --> 37:39.960]  human beings without informed consent and yet in two years all of that conviction has suddenly
[37:39.960 --> 37:46.600]  disappeared and people are walking around in mass with science has not been explained to them
[37:47.640 --> 37:55.480]  they are they are doing what they're told they are orchestrated these these government agencies
[37:55.480 --> 38:03.480]  are orchestrating obedience it is not democratic it's not the product of democracy it's the product
[38:03.480 --> 38:13.720]  of a pharmaceutical driven biosecurity agenda that will enslave the entire human race and plunge
[38:13.720 --> 38:23.560]  us into a dystopian nightmare where the apocalyptic forces of ignorance and greed will be running
[38:23.560 --> 38:30.760]  our lives and ruining our children and destroying all the dreams and dignity that we hope to give
[38:30.760 --> 38:39.880]  to our children orchestrating obedience orchestrating mass suicide orchestrating a symphony of
[38:40.520 --> 38:47.560]  armageddon well again robert barnes was in texas for several weeks and was available in studio
[38:47.560 --> 38:51.480]  he wouldn't give me much of the details but he said he was representing a whistleblower
[38:51.480 --> 38:55.080]  and what was involved and then after the filings were made he told me more in confidence and i
[38:55.080 --> 38:59.960]  told you a couple weeks ago i said in a couple weeks you will see in the news the biggest news yet
[39:00.600 --> 39:06.040]  i'm not taking any thunder away or lightning uh from the great folks at project veritas they
[39:06.040 --> 39:10.840]  helped spur other people to come public but this is on a scale of one to ten veritas having them
[39:10.840 --> 39:14.840]  admitting they're lying to the public admitting the vaccines are dangerous it's like a five
[39:14.840 --> 39:19.320]  having one of the research scientists involved and and then i mean i'm being able to have lawyers
[39:19.320 --> 39:24.760]  then contact the victims that's a ten and if we don't do something about this and stop this now
[39:24.760 --> 39:28.360]  it's just insane it's like oh and schroeders are here today when he was hosting the fourth hour
[39:29.320 --> 39:36.360]  if this doesn't stop now then we're all complicit i i mean the things that are coming out now
[39:36.920 --> 39:42.200]  are just unbelievable so robert barnes can now speak to a lot more than you even see in the news
[39:42.200 --> 39:47.160]  with the exclusive he'll be with us 15 minutes the next hour and then the main researcher uh on
[39:47.160 --> 39:55.320]  tucker carlson's new three-part series the plot against the people mr beady will be joining us
[39:55.320 --> 40:01.240]  darren beady with huge breaking news on that front with the plot against the people uh coming up
[40:01.240 --> 40:05.320]  in the last 45 minutes the next hour that i'll continue with all this news but robert absolutely
[40:05.320 --> 40:09.480]  huge developments i know you're also working and and you worked on jury selection of things with the
[40:09.480 --> 40:13.560]  written house case we've got huge developments there the fbi sitting on footage of written
[40:13.560 --> 40:17.400]  house being shot at uh just incredible you'll be able to obviously get to that as well but wow
[40:17.960 --> 40:22.520]  you've done a lot in and around vaccines and whistleblowers but is it safe to say this is
[40:22.520 --> 40:27.640]  10 times better than anything you've ever been involved in i mean it's the biggest clinical
[40:27.640 --> 40:31.960]  trial whistleblower in the history of clinical trials involving major drugs and it happens to
[40:31.960 --> 40:36.840]  involve the biggest drug ever distributed or produced in our modern age i mean what what
[40:36.840 --> 40:41.000]  happened here is you know this is someone who comes in and does clinical oddity so this is the
[40:41.000 --> 40:46.680]  person who makes sure the clinical testing is actually meeting scientific standard and what
[40:46.680 --> 40:51.240]  she found was that it didn't meet any standard least of all scientific standard i mean you're
[40:51.240 --> 40:55.240]  talking about walking into the clinical testing where they're not even using the right garbage
[40:55.240 --> 41:00.280]  bags to get rid of the needles because the needles are sticking out of the bag where you walk into
[41:00.280 --> 41:07.000]  the patient's records you could a janitor could walk in and see people's medical records just
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.040]  looking right there on the on the wall to look at who's got what diseases who's got what medical
[41:12.040 --> 41:18.760]  problems i mean basic elementary mechanisms of safety and security were completely abandoned
[41:18.760 --> 41:25.320]  in all in these key critical COVID-19 clinical stage three testing of the COVID vaccine and that
[41:25.320 --> 41:30.280]  doesn't even get to of course the severe scientific problems which is that everything was unblinded
[41:30.280 --> 41:33.960]  it wasn't blinded which it needed to be which they weren't measuring that making sure the
[41:33.960 --> 41:38.680]  temperatures were right on the vaccines to make them actually effective they weren't taking baseline
[41:38.680 --> 41:45.240]  data to do blood samples and other blood pressure and other items to even know what the impact of
[41:45.240 --> 41:50.280]  the vaccine was there was under there was under the table payments being made to people there are
[41:50.280 --> 41:55.880]  people being coming in that were were compromising the fundamental safety and efficacy measurements
[41:55.880 --> 42:02.840]  of the testing basically it was an entire disaster and debacle and here you had someone who last year
[42:02.840 --> 42:08.840]  who is the person that comes in to make sure these tests are being done in a scientific accurate way
[42:08.840 --> 42:14.760]  see that it's not being done at all in that way finds out the problem is systemic and systematic
[42:14.760 --> 42:21.240]  reports it to the FDA and what happens she is summarily fired right out of the gate just fired
[42:21.240 --> 42:28.920]  and the FDA does no publicly known investigation so it's deeply disturbing if this kind of behavior
[42:28.920 --> 42:34.120]  was happening right in the open for someone to witness like she did then that means we can have
[42:34.120 --> 42:39.320]  no confidence at all no trust at all in any of the clinical testing that went on on this COVID
[42:39.320 --> 42:44.600]  vaccine cannot trust any of the data any of the information it's the biggest whistleblower in the
[42:44.600 --> 42:50.040]  vaccine context in the history of vaccines incredible and we've got the lawyer that followed
[42:50.040 --> 42:59.000]  the case robert barnes right here with us we're gonna lay it all out on the other side stay with us

[43:56.040 --> 44:02.680]  supports the info war take action now and get prepared there is very little contemporary study
[44:02.680 --> 44:10.040]  in the world of the planet's ruling class not in communist china not in mexico not in the united
[44:10.040 --> 44:16.600]  states not anywhere is there a real study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design
[44:17.400 --> 44:22.680]  the large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[44:23.480 --> 44:28.440]  that look into say the anglo-american establishment the founder of the bilderberg group the trilateral
[44:28.440 --> 44:33.880]  commission of the united nations the whole project of the ross shawls and the rocky folks until 10
[44:33.880 --> 44:39.400]  years ago the media said the control corporate media the bilderberg group didn't exist well now
[44:39.400 --> 44:45.320]  the bilderberg group is public and its former head show the steering committee is called schwaab
[44:45.320 --> 44:50.520]  and he has set up the great reset at global government and if as a liberty movement worldwide
[44:50.520 --> 44:55.320]  we don't address the globalist head on about the second figure worldwide authoritarian corporate
[44:55.320 --> 45:00.200]  takeover we don't have a shot we do expose them we can beat em easily we've all heard about the
[45:00.200 --> 45:04.920]  pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp in world war two that
[45:04.920 --> 45:09.320]  when they came for one group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and then when
[45:09.320 --> 45:13.960]  they came for another group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and finally
[45:14.680 --> 45:18.520]  when they came for him there was nobody else to stand up oh the global social credit score the
[45:18.520 --> 45:22.600]  china is putting in it's banning people to three hours of video games a week and if you
[45:22.600 --> 45:27.160]  criticize the government you can never buy or sell again well that's that's being brought here and
[45:27.160 --> 45:31.960]  all over the world under the guise of covid vaccine passports they even admit it now there's
[45:31.960 --> 45:36.440]  they has going to be a carbon tax attached to it they're going to track where you go what you do and
[45:36.440 --> 45:41.400]  decide where you can go and what you can do that's what the lockdowns are about you'll accept that
[45:41.400 --> 45:47.160]  you'll accept anything so again the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny
[45:47.160 --> 45:50.520]  pretending like they're part of the power structure but they're all going to be targeted by this
[45:50.520 --> 45:55.000]  nightmare as well we need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will
[45:55.000 --> 46:00.520]  be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists after being unavailable for more
[46:00.520 --> 46:06.280]  than two years ultimate bone broth is back in info wars life ultimate bone broth is now ultimate

[46:53.400 --> 46:58.600]  of turmeric and everything else with the new and improved bone broth at infowarstored.com
[47:01.640 --> 47:04.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:04.360 --> 47:10.360]  well
[47:19.720 --> 47:25.240]  while we were sleeping they came and took it all away
[47:27.800 --> 47:32.440]  you know we called this out 21 22 months ago we called the wuhan lab we called the
[47:32.440 --> 47:37.960]  kameera virus we called how they would try to bring the lockdowns back and how the vaccines wouldn't
[47:37.960 --> 47:42.840]  work and how they would demand booster shots people say how the hell did jones know this
[47:42.840 --> 47:47.000]  it's all over twitter like jones is a wizard that's one of the quotes they got a whole
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.840]  bunch of retweets jones is psychic well all humans are psychic to a certain extent no uh the globalist
[47:52.840 --> 47:58.760]  put out stuff like operation lockstep event 201 crimson contagion i mean they tell you what they're
[47:58.760 --> 48:05.560]  gonna do at a big corporate level like this under the guise of a tabletop exercise and in the spars
[48:05.560 --> 48:10.760]  tabletop war game that they did a year and a half before they launched all this they war game even
[48:10.760 --> 48:16.360]  how when it starts killing us how they're gonna spin that and how they'll blame the unvaccinated
[48:16.360 --> 48:21.640]  but then that won't be enough so then they'll just start burning the government regulators and
[48:21.640 --> 48:26.600]  saying it was all an accident but really it's designed to collapse western society to quote
[48:26.600 --> 48:32.440]  bring in the great reset that's what prince charles said we need military action to end the industrialized
[48:32.440 --> 48:40.680]  world utilism for us he's not talking about himself this is a declaration of war they want to ruin
[48:40.680 --> 48:46.920]  things they want to make the police and firefighters and military quit they want clowered and piven
[48:46.920 --> 48:51.560]  they want the teachers to quit they want the factories to shut down they want the truck
[48:51.560 --> 48:56.920]  drivers to quit because they know they can get the corporations to follow orders with biden's
[48:56.920 --> 49:01.400]  illegal mandate and everything falls apart robert barnes is our guest all i can tell you is the

[50:59.480 --> 51:02.520]  they're really trying to suppress this but it's coming out even mainline news
[51:02.520 --> 51:07.560]  covet 19 researcher blows the whistle on data integrity issue and Pfizer's vaccine trials
[51:07.560 --> 51:12.440]  that's a dry way of saying at major universities you know have headlines like that but this is
[51:12.440 --> 51:18.040]  just fake as a three dollar bill break it down for us sure so i mean this story is being reported
[51:18.040 --> 51:22.760]  and was vetted by the british medical journal so you're talking about one of the premier
[51:22.760 --> 51:29.400]  medical publications in the world research this reviewed this investigated this i look at talk
[51:29.400 --> 51:33.400]  to people that knew her talk to other people that were aware of what was happening with these
[51:33.400 --> 51:39.160]  companies doing these clinical testing for the covet 19 vaccine and they confirmed every single
[51:39.160 --> 51:44.040]  disturbing aspect and attribute of this they confirm that what happened is here you have a
[51:44.040 --> 51:49.720]  whistleblower and the the case that will be filed is for children's health defense against the fda
[51:49.720 --> 51:55.160]  related to emergency use authorized for this vaccine for little children and that's what
[51:55.160 --> 52:00.120]  led her to come forward because this is such a disturbing level of clinical failures i mean
[52:00.120 --> 52:05.960]  every measurement and mechanism for safety for efficacy for determining whether this
[52:05.960 --> 52:11.960]  vaccine works whether this vaccine is dangerous all of them were vitiated and violated in the
[52:11.960 --> 52:16.840]  in the critical stage three clinical testing that and she witnessed it firsthand this is
[52:16.840 --> 52:23.800]  someone who has done over 50 clinical trial involvement over an extensive two decade career
[52:23.800 --> 52:28.120]  and this is not someone that had any political motivation at all this is someone who stepped
[52:28.120 --> 52:34.600]  in and simply was doing her job and was shocked at what she saw the worst clinical stage environment
[52:34.600 --> 52:40.440]  she'd ever witnessed called it helter skelter that's what other witnesses who saw it described it as
[52:40.440 --> 52:46.200]  i mean they had severe adverse events taking place that were not even being reporting or disclosed
[52:46.200 --> 52:52.360]  they had basic baseline information that wasn't being kept this specimen data wasn't being properly
[52:52.360 --> 52:58.440]  maintained the vaccine wasn't even at the proper temperature i mean it's just an utter disaster
[52:58.440 --> 53:04.040]  what was taking place you had complete chaos a complete breakdown of all the basic elemental
[53:04.040 --> 53:09.640]  rules for measuring the safety and efficacy of a drug you can have no confidence and what they
[53:09.640 --> 53:15.240]  were doing when they didn't have adequate data they were just falsifying the data they were just
[53:15.240 --> 53:20.040]  fabricating the data they were putting in false entries into the system that was going to be
[53:20.040 --> 53:25.640]  reported for purposes of fda approval and authorization so that's what's so terrifying
[53:25.640 --> 53:32.200]  here is that the most critical mass mandated drug in history went through the worst clinical
[53:32.200 --> 53:39.400]  uh testing scientifically imaginable and the fda knew about it a year ago and as soon as she
[53:39.400 --> 53:45.080]  disclosed it to the fda these companies fire her and terminate her so clearly that means they weren't
[53:45.080 --> 53:50.120]  serious it was so it's not just what happened in the clinical studies that she saw and that she
[53:50.120 --> 53:56.920]  heard about from other people participating it's what does it say about fizer that when they found
[53:56.920 --> 54:02.840]  out they had a complete disaster on their hand their reaction was not to correct not to remedy
[54:02.840 --> 54:10.440]  not to investigate not to clarify no it was to fire and falsify it was to defraud the american
[54:10.440 --> 54:14.920]  people uh by because i mean there's billions of dollars being paid for these vaccines and and
[54:14.920 --> 54:18.520]  barns barns obviously they they've done all their secret studies and animals they knew this was
[54:18.520 --> 54:23.560]  coming you predicted that almost two years ago but what do you make now in light of the fda board
[54:23.560 --> 54:28.280]  member saying last week famously i'm going to vote for this to see what it does the kids
[54:28.280 --> 54:32.440]  admitting their guinea pigs but now we learn it's far worse than that they all know about this they
[54:32.440 --> 54:37.320]  all know they suppressed the real data that 86 percent of adverse reactions including microcarditis
[54:37.320 --> 54:41.720]  and up to 56 percent of those that get microcarditis at those young ages end up dying within three to
[54:41.720 --> 54:48.600]  ten years i mean this is this is this is just unbelievable premeditation it's terrifying i
[54:48.600 --> 54:54.200]  mean so that's why uh this whistleblower is joining and filing a declaration in support of the suit
[54:54.200 --> 54:58.760]  we are about to bring on behalf of children's health defense in the western district of texas
[54:58.760 --> 55:04.360]  against this emergency use authorization for young kids they want to experiment on five-year-olds now
[55:04.360 --> 55:09.640]  they're going to treat five-year our own five-year-old kids as guinea pigs for this experiment by
[55:09.640 --> 55:13.480]  some of their own admissions by their own statement and let's go further let's go further total
[55:13.480 --> 55:21.480]  violation urnberg code on its face they have the fda and the cdc had the cdc had was on tv last night
[55:21.480 --> 55:28.520]  saying this is 96 effective and no side effects no problems we did studies a complete 180 live from
[55:28.520 --> 55:34.280]  reality completely because the studies aren't worth the paper they're printed on the studies are a
[55:34.280 --> 55:39.080]  joke the studies are a disgrace that's what this whistleblower confirms from right inside
[55:39.080 --> 55:44.760]  the critical level clinical stage testing there is no reliable data they falsify data
[55:44.760 --> 55:49.800]  they fabricated data they uh just perjured themselves left and right to cover up the
[55:49.800 --> 55:55.880]  fact there is no basis to determine that there is any safety or any efficacy in any of these
[55:55.880 --> 56:01.560]  vaccines least of all for minor children and not only that i mean they the fda ignored data which
[56:01.560 --> 56:07.960]  was a violation of their ethical and legal standards they ignored the various contrarian
[56:07.960 --> 56:12.200]  information presented by a wide range of even governmental authorities including the uk as it
[56:12.200 --> 56:17.400]  relates to children they ignored a wide and they didn't even articulate what their standard was
[56:17.400 --> 56:21.560]  they failed to articulate what is the standard for measuring the safety or efficacy of this
[56:21.560 --> 56:27.560]  vaccine what is the standard for measuring the safety or that efficacy as it relates to uh the
[56:27.560 --> 56:32.280]  virus and and how dangerous the virus may be to this population group which is to say it is
[56:32.280 --> 56:37.880]  less by less dangerous this uh virus COVID-19 including the variants are less dangerous to
[56:37.880 --> 56:42.760]  children than the flu is so why are we sticking an experimental drug in them when we have utterly
[56:42.760 --> 56:48.440]  unreliable data to uh and data that has been proven now by the whistleblowers to not be
[56:48.440 --> 56:55.080]  scientifically valid data scientifically trustworthy Robert Robert all these top scientists again
[56:55.080 --> 56:59.400]  almost two years ago warned this would happen now what they warned have happened was premeditated
[56:59.400 --> 57:03.960]  big why would big pharma do something this psychotic and crazy and commit a crime this
[57:03.960 --> 57:07.880]  massive and now we're gonna have a bunch of dead and dying children and they think they're gonna
[57:07.880 --> 57:12.760]  be able to suppress it and normalize it i mean they've gone they lost their minds it's all about
[57:12.760 --> 57:18.360]  immunity the reason it's the reason why there's no available approved vaccine the only vaccine
[57:18.360 --> 57:23.720]  that's out there is these emergency use authorized ones because that has complete immunity once they
[57:23.720 --> 57:28.680]  get it on the kids list then they have the same immunity as all the other drugs on the kids list
[57:28.680 --> 57:33.480]  so they want complete immunity and why do they want immunity because they know this drug isn't
[57:33.480 --> 57:38.200]  safe and effective in the way they're telling people it is that's why and they want to get rid
[57:38.200 --> 57:41.960]  of the population we'll be right back with robert barnes talk about where we go from here and a
[57:41.960 --> 57:45.800]  bunch of other news that ties into this i got another prestigious study about what the spike

[58:58.120 --> 59:03.000]  come out and they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the
[59:03.000 --> 59:10.040]  creator and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much so that's why i repeat
[59:10.040 --> 59:17.880]  that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda
[59:17.880 --> 59:24.200]  would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all the propaganda and all
[59:24.200 --> 59:31.480]  their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they
[59:31.480 --> 59:36.520]  know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important
[59:36.520 --> 59:40.760]  that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever because even you don't believe in god
[59:41.320 --> 59:46.600]  what the globalist are manifesting and setting up is jay can and we are opposing the one world
[59:46.600 --> 59:53.720]  government and the mark of the beast they just announced leading a frontal assault on the lies
[59:53.720 --> 1:00:09.640]  of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:20.280]  robert barnes is our guest and he is representing a major fda whistleblower from inside the medical
[1:00:20.280 --> 1:00:27.160]  system that witnessed the greatest fraud ever in a major vaccine rollout as they try to suppress
[1:00:27.160 --> 1:00:33.080]  the data that gates admitted that 80 plus percent gets sick including microcarditis and heart attacks
[1:00:33.080 --> 1:00:38.120]  so barnes continue laying out this huge information and when is the lawsuit in the district of federal
[1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:43.400]  court here in austin going to get filed uh yeah so i mean this is ordinary information and she
[1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:48.040]  took great risk by coming forward and the reason she did it was because she was horrified that
[1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:52.200]  they were going to experiment on kids now so we're going to file suit for the children's health
[1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:59.080]  defense in the western district of texas uh early next week maybe sooner uh as soon as the fda fully
[1:00:59.080 --> 1:01:03.880]  informally makes its announcement that's done partial stages of it that the emergency use
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:10.120]  authorization has been approved for the purposes of injecting five-year-olds with this experimental
[1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:15.960]  drug for which they have completely inadequate data on either safety or efficacy for a virus that
[1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:21.400]  simply does not pose meaningful risks to children in that age group and that the they've failed to
[1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:25.560]  articulate a standard as they're required for measuring the safety and efficacy of the drug
[1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:30.200]  for measuring the risk of the virus for measuring the risk of the vaccine and particularly the long
[1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:35.560]  tail long-term risks are of course overwhelmingly on children because they have the longest life
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:40.840]  expectancy so there's great dangers to this drug over time the fda admits they don't even know the
[1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:45.320]  full scale of it instead they're just going to experiment on children and that's why she came
[1:01:45.320 --> 1:01:50.920]  forward because what she witnessed was shocking it was a helter-skelter environment where every
[1:01:50.920 --> 1:01:56.680]  a basic measurement of safety and efficacy was completely eviscerated and ignored this is someone
[1:01:56.680 --> 1:02:01.720]  who's spent two decades in the clinical trial context auditing the records to make sure they're
[1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:07.000]  done properly overseeing it to make sure it's done effectively done in a way that is scientifically
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:12.040]  conforming that means you have what's called blinded studies so people don't know who is getting the
[1:02:12.040 --> 1:02:16.520]  vaccine versus who is getting the placebo that means everything is done in a proper manner in
[1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:21.240]  terms of measuring the medical record data information that means you get certain baseline
[1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:26.520]  data before you inject the vaccine or the placebo and then you're able to measure it afterwards
[1:02:26.520 --> 1:02:32.360]  to know what effects the vaccine has that means the person is being monitored in live time after
[1:02:32.360 --> 1:02:37.800]  they receive the injection to make sure you detect any things that occur because when people pass out
[1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:42.200]  other things they may not even know what's happening it needs to be constantly continuously
[1:02:42.200 --> 1:02:46.200]  monitored in addition you of course you have to have basic safety and efficacy in terms of
[1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:51.400]  privacy of medical records and making sure you dispose of things like needles appropriately
[1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:54.840]  if you're not even disposing of needles appropriately which is what was happening here
[1:02:54.840 --> 1:02:59.800]  needles sticking out of bags if you're not even properly managing the privacy of medical records
[1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:05.400]  with people's records you know stuck on the wall for the janitor to watch to read oh look yeah look
[1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:09.800]  at let's look at Susie's sexually transmitted disease right up there that kind of thing if you're
[1:03:09.800 --> 1:03:15.240]  not even at that level of safety or efficacy if you're not even at that level of protocols and
[1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:19.880]  procedures if you're not even at that level of safeguarding critical and essential information
[1:03:19.880 --> 1:03:25.000]  you can guess what the medical record data looks like they didn't even get the baseline data they
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:29.240]  didn't even record it they didn't even note it correctly when they got caught doing that what
[1:03:29.240 --> 1:03:34.920]  did they do they falsified the data they fabricated the records that's what they did instead they
[1:03:34.920 --> 1:03:39.400]  weren't even monitoring people uh during right after they received the injection they've been left
[1:03:39.400 --> 1:03:43.960]  in the hallways unmonitored they weren't even recording properly a whole bunch of adverse
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:49.240]  events that were taking place including severe adverse events in response to the vaccine it
[1:03:49.240 --> 1:03:54.280]  wasn't even blinded everybody knew who was getting the placebo versus the vaccine which completely
[1:03:54.280 --> 1:03:59.400]  throws out the scientific utility of a clinical study particularly a stage three this was a stage
[1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:05.560]  three Pfizer clinical study to measure the efficacy of the primary vaccine being distributed for
[1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:12.840]  COVID-19 to the entire world and they didn't even have basic elemental elementary safety
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:19.000]  security scientific standards to measure it and that is why it is so dangerous that it is now
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:25.640]  being imposed on young children as young as five years old the FDA did not even articulate a standard
[1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:31.320]  for measuring safety and efficacy they should have done an individualized stratus stratified
[1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:36.520]  test they didn't they don't even have they ignored a bunch of relevant data they hid a bunch of other
[1:04:36.520 --> 1:04:43.080]  pertinent data this is a a constitutional abomination this is a public health disaster
[1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:48.040]  and that is why this whistleblower is going to be filing a declaration in support of a suit by
[1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:53.960]  children's health defense against FDA to stop these illegal illicit activity of incredible
[1:04:53.960 --> 1:04:59.320]  this is the biggest disaster in human history stay with us well it's now out in the open
[1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:09.480]  it's now becoming accepted knowledge accepted fact that global government run by private
[1:05:09.480 --> 1:05:14.360]  corporations is taking over the united states and other formerly sovereign nations they're
[1:05:14.360 --> 1:05:19.160]  being destroyed all the checks and balances are being annihilated our borders are being destroyed
[1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:23.320]  our currency is being destroyed and the american people have been listed as terrorists by the
[1:05:23.320 --> 1:05:28.120]  rogue federal government info wars is going to continue to fight on and there is a big awakening
[1:05:28.120 --> 1:05:31.480]  happening we have a good chance of beating these people but we're not going to be able to stay on
[1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:35.800]  air unless you support us and you've been doing it so spread the word about the broadcast pray for

[1:06:10.360 --> 1:06:19.480]  to the violence of the sun from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:06:19.480 --> 1:06:42.040]  what a time to be alive alex jones show here robert barnes is with us he is working with
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:49.240]  robert kennedy jr and a major whistleblower and he is down here in texas or has been in texas
[1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:53.640]  here three weeks ago or so while he was getting ready for this telling me it was coming out telling
[1:06:53.640 --> 1:06:58.840]  me it'd be a huge story biggest whistleblower ever and it is and now it's hitting the news they're
[1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:05.160]  having real trouble trying to spin this oh there was a few problems with the studies uh no they
[1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:12.440]  were finding the same numbers that gates admitted 16 17 months ago of over 80 of people having
[1:07:12.440 --> 1:07:19.400]  adverse reactions including microcarditis and even death and the attempts to suppress all of that
[1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:24.360]  information you can see on screen the clip we've been talking about of your tv viewer so barnes for
[1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:31.160]  folks that just joined us recap this huge new and then get into other angles of this for the public
[1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:37.800]  like how's the power structure going to cover this one up when it's clear that they premeditatedly
[1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:42.600]  knew what this would do knew it would attack immune systems and cause autoimmune problems and attack
[1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:48.600]  the heart and that that's why the rest of the world won't approve these so-called mRNA vaccines
[1:07:48.600 --> 1:07:53.160]  and we have the inventor of the technology a year and a half ago saying don't do this and we have the
[1:07:53.160 --> 1:07:58.120]  former head of fizer chief scientist saying don't do it and we have the Nobel prize winners for
[1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:03.480]  virology saying don't do it i mean it's not like they didn't know don't pour five gallons of gasoline
[1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:08.200]  on yourself and light it i mean they knew exactly what they were damn well doing so why did they do
[1:08:08.200 --> 1:08:13.240]  this why was the deep water horizon did all the engineers say if you don't pump concrete into
[1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:18.440]  the drilling hole and drill a 30 000 foot hole when it hits a big gas pocket it's going to blow up
[1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:25.400]  and they said it's in the court transcript we we a 46 billion dollar company we do what we want
[1:08:25.400 --> 1:08:30.760]  that's a quote in the movie that's a real quote we a 46 billion dollar company at the time so what
[1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:35.720]  why are they doing something thousands of times better than that attacking our children what the
[1:08:35.720 --> 1:08:40.760]  hell is going on here we i think you have a multi-layered agenda you have a you know for
[1:08:40.760 --> 1:08:46.360]  fizer it's simple it's making money they're making record profits they they have no risk in all reward
[1:08:46.360 --> 1:08:51.480]  and all they had to do was keep this silent what was taken place with this whistleblower
[1:08:51.480 --> 1:08:58.040]  spotted again a year ago reported it to fizer and to fda a year ago the uh that was detailing these
[1:08:58.040 --> 1:09:04.680]  extraordinary deviations and basic procedural violations of core safety mechanisms for measuring
[1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:10.840]  the safety and efficacy of this drug the data is as contaminated as it can be the data is utterly
[1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:16.360]  unreliable there is no reliable trustworthy data based on this whistleblowers report that this
[1:09:16.360 --> 1:09:22.280]  vaccine is safe and effective at all the reality is the real clinical three testing that's taking
[1:09:22.280 --> 1:09:27.880]  place is in live time on every american and every person in the world that's taking this vaccine
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:32.840]  they're the clinical test study they're the experimental subject they're the guinea pig
[1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:37.720]  because the actual clinical testing didn't conform to basic elementary standards for
[1:09:37.720 --> 1:09:41.640]  measuring safety and efficacy they weren't properly recording adverse events they weren't
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:46.040]  properly monitoring people they weren't properly getting baseline data they weren't even properly
[1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:49.640]  keeping the vaccine at the right temperature while needles were sticking out of bags and
[1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:54.200]  people's patient records were sticking out of the walls this was a complete disaster with
[1:09:54.200 --> 1:09:59.240]  under the table payments to disguise what was taking place and to illicitly fraudulently
[1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:05.000]  fabricate the data and information consequently we should never even be thinking about forcing this
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:10.200]  into five-year-old children for whom this virus poses very little to no risk and if people want
[1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:14.120]  to understand the broader agenda of foot just look at who bill gates is and what he's been
[1:10:14.120 --> 1:10:19.480]  preaching for 10 years and there you can see where the roadmap is and where the roadmap is going
[1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:24.440]  and it's not a roadmap ordinary everyday americans have any interest in and we have to continue to
[1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:30.920]  push back as people have well robert i know this what we're witnessing is incredibly historical
[1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:35.160]  and now they're not just talking about saying five-year-olds and upper authorized now they're
[1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:39.320]  saying we want to start going down to two and up and then to newborns even though they admit no
[1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:44.440]  newborns ever gotten sick from this they didn't have three or four uh co-barbitities uh like
[1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:54.200]  serious deformities and and you know things like uh holes in the heart it's just over the top and
[1:10:54.200 --> 1:10:59.400]  then we see other studies coming out here's a major study out of the department of molecular
[1:10:59.400 --> 1:11:06.120]  biology the werne green institute stock home university one of the top 10 in the world
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:11.880]  a huge giant study i read the thing last night took me an hour gave me a headache
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:15.160]  and i went and cross-reference it there's a bunch of the studies saying the same thing
[1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:26.520]  sars coveted v2 spike impairs dna damage repair and inhibits v dj recombination in vitro they went
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:33.000]  on to say the vaccine itself creating the spike protein causes a chain reaction in the body
[1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:39.880]  causing cells to not be able to replicate and or become cancerous it's unbelievable there's a
[1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:44.360]  big article on info wars dot com about it from mike adams at natural news dot com
[1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:53.000]  science horror vaccine spike protein enters cell nuclei suppresses dna repair engine will unleash
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:12:00.040]  explosion of cancer immune deficient emo deficiency autoimmune disorders and accelerating aging
[1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:04.680]  and i read the whole thing it's true and they know it and they're doing it i mean this is like
[1:12:04.680 --> 1:12:10.840]  moon raker this is the population this is it barns well me bill gates has always been basically
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:15.480]  a james bond villain look at the data matthew crawford is putting out he is showing all these
[1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:20.040]  countries showing a lot of that like throughout asia look at the southeast asia look at the
[1:12:20.040 --> 1:12:25.080]  death rates from coveted and then look at the dope death rate after the vaccine is introduced
[1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:30.040]  and the death rate skyrockets and key age groups all in every single one of those countries go back
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:34.840]  and think about the soccer player that dropped dead uh are almost dropped dead right in the middle of a
[1:12:34.840 --> 1:12:39.880]  game during the european championships it wasn't long after he got the vaccine there's other soccer
[1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:44.200]  players that are suffering severe medical injuries we now know about tennis players nba players people
[1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:49.960]  that are in the prime of their lives suddenly suffering severe debilitating injuries sometimes
[1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:55.400]  death after they've taken the vaccine within a few weeks of taking of taking it sometimes
[1:12:55.400 --> 1:13:01.160]  within days so it raises major questions about what is really going on and what's going on is
[1:13:01.160 --> 1:13:06.440]  that fundamentally we're being treated as chattel i mean as bobby kennedy pointed out it's practical
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:11.960]  enslavement where our bodies are not owned by us anymore our bodies are owned by the state
[1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:17.080]  our bodies are owned by the corporations our children are being owned by the state and by
[1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:21.720]  corporations and barns you're right when they first started pushing this 20-something months
[1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:26.200]  because they're like it repairs your dna it's magical the only way it alters our dna that's
[1:13:26.200 --> 1:13:30.600]  dangerous they go oh no it doesn't touch your dna there's an article you know bragging about it
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:36.600]  now they've spun that back and now we learned it actually destroys our dna i mean this is crazy
[1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:39.880]  out of all the things they could have injected us with they inject us with something that
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:45.800]  destroys our immunity and gives us cancer i mean this is insane i mean and it fits a long
[1:13:45.800 --> 1:13:51.240]  pattern i mean there's no history of successful coronavirus vaccines in over a century of trying
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:56.040]  to develop them because of the nature of mutations and variations there's no history of a successful
[1:13:56.040 --> 1:14:02.360]  mRNA vaccine these were both massive experimentation being done on a massive scale at a massive stage
[1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:07.560]  on human beings i mean that's that's Sergei Aguero that's one of the greatest uh soccer players in
[1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:11.960]  the world not long after he takes the vaccine suddenly he has heart issues are we supposed to
[1:14:11.960 --> 1:14:17.320]  keep pretending these are coincidences i run into more and more people who know somebody hurt from
[1:14:17.320 --> 1:14:23.800]  the vaccine severely then they know of someone hurt severely from the virus that wasn't already
[1:14:23.800 --> 1:14:28.760]  facing on you know knocking on death's door you know almost nobody knows someone that suffered
[1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:33.800]  a severe injury from the virus that was young and healthy almost everybody now knows somebody
[1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:39.000]  who who suffered severe injury from the vaccine and the risk of this vaccine was its long tail
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:43.640]  risk we're discovering its short term risk is off the chart i totally agree what what about
[1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:47.800]  trump he's hurting himself with this base he's got to get ahead of this he doesn't have much more
[1:14:47.800 --> 1:14:52.200]  time it this whole house of cards is coming down he got lied to by fouchy to come out with these
[1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:58.120]  shots trumps got to extricate himself out of this right now well it's what the santa said the other
[1:14:58.120 --> 1:15:02.520]  day the santa said you know you're talked about when you're into a recession when you're in a
[1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:07.560]  depression and he said you know you're in a recovery when fouchy's been fired well well we
[1:15:07.560 --> 1:15:12.520]  will know we're in a recovery when fouchy's behind bars that's what we'll know we're in recovery
[1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:17.880]  trump has got to recognize the mistakes that he made turn the corner turn the page and start to
[1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:22.040]  address it and embrace the populist direction that the country is moving in that's what the
[1:15:22.040 --> 1:15:26.920]  elections showed yesterday even new jersey is tight because there's so much populist anger
[1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:31.880]  at this agenda the vaccine the virginia gubernator republican candidate came out and said he would
[1:15:31.880 --> 1:15:37.720]  oppose all vaccine mandates three days before the election he surges he wins so we now know you

[1:20:20.920 --> 1:20:25.320]  now to see at least the first two parts of Tucker Carlson's extremely powerful
[1:20:25.880 --> 1:20:30.680]  miniseries on fox nation it's now been seen by millions of people and that of course is the
[1:20:30.680 --> 1:20:38.200]  plot against the people and we have the editor and owner and founder of revolver.news Dr. Darren
[1:20:38.200 --> 1:20:42.600]  J. Beatty a former professor of political science from Duke University who went on to serve in the
[1:20:42.600 --> 1:20:48.440]  white house of speech router advisor on policy to trump he is now founder of revolver.news and
[1:20:48.440 --> 1:20:52.920]  he's one of the leading experts in the world on false flags we actually have some ongoing
[1:20:52.920 --> 1:20:58.360]  false flag stuff here in austin that i wasn't really going to get to today i knew it was coming
[1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:01.400]  a firebombing of a synagogue they're trying to connect it to me
[1:21:02.440 --> 1:21:07.080]  predicted this would happen and i'm not going to feed in to the group and organization that we
[1:21:07.080 --> 1:21:12.360]  know is obviously involved in this but let's just say the system is very mad at me and we've
[1:21:12.360 --> 1:21:15.960]  been predicting this would go on and i'm i'm going to speak to it towards the end of this hour
[1:21:15.960 --> 1:21:21.480]  at austin fire department looking for arson suspect in connection with fire at the synagogue
[1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:26.840]  and so we'll be talking about that but here's there's a bunch of these clips i want to play just a
[1:21:26.840 --> 1:21:32.280]  few and then we're going to get our guest this is a clip of how they're building a guantanamo
[1:21:32.280 --> 1:21:38.360]  bay or i guess it's built in washington dc for hundreds of people here it is guantanamo bay is
[1:21:38.360 --> 1:21:47.000]  a place where terrorists are sent pre-trial absent due process to be held interrogated abused
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:54.760]  by the government until they crack and give us what we want but now they're doing it to us
[1:21:54.760 --> 1:22:00.840]  now you have a group of people who went to exercise their constitutional rights on january 6
[1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:09.400]  who are being held absent due process in a federal prison for an undetermined period of time
[1:22:09.400 --> 1:22:15.160]  they're being held under religious conditions i was incarcerated at first in a special unit
[1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:21.160]  and the first thing i noticed about it was it was full of black mold so even in the drinking
[1:22:21.160 --> 1:22:26.280]  water that came out of your sink you can see the black mold down there and then you punished them
[1:22:27.160 --> 1:22:35.080]  by letting the guards physically assault them brian samsall two guards snuck into his cell in the
[1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:41.080]  middle of the night zip tied his hands behind his back they pulled him out of cell took him down
[1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:45.960]  the end where we're the camera showing uh he followed instructions they proceeded to beat
[1:22:45.960 --> 1:22:51.400]  the man to the point that he now has lost sight in one eye and when i woke up the next morning
[1:22:51.400 --> 1:22:57.000]  another friend of mine said hey ryan's in trouble go down to his cell and check on him i went down
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:04.120]  there got him to turn around and his whole face looked like hamburger meat people are being tortured
[1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:09.800]  and it gets a lot worse than that they've now declared the american people are terrorists
[1:23:09.800 --> 1:23:17.480]  in biden's official national announcement in june and they're just getting started ladies and
[1:23:17.480 --> 1:23:23.240]  gentlemen solitary confinement is another very serious form of torture that's going on so
[1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:29.960]  doctor thank you for coming on with us um a lot is unfolding a lot is coming out more is coming
[1:23:29.960 --> 1:23:33.960]  out in a few days and came out previously in a few weeks uh what do you make of the reception
[1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:38.680]  to tuckers documentary that you're such a big part of an advisor on and what you think the next
[1:23:38.680 --> 1:23:43.000]  moves are going to be by the establishment because they're very upset that you and others are exposing
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:48.120]  tuckers exposing their next big move obviously before the midterms is a false flag or provocative
[1:23:48.120 --> 1:23:54.360]  event yes well first of all thanks for having me and thanks for covering this from the very
[1:23:54.360 --> 1:24:02.600]  beginning and it's one of those things like the media freaks out routinely about a number of things
[1:24:02.600 --> 1:24:09.800]  some trivial and some not so trivial but there are few narratives that have generated such a severe
[1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:17.480]  and prolonged media and regime freak out as the narrative that there were government
[1:24:17.480 --> 1:24:25.480]  operatives inciting on january 6 you saw something similar when revolver.news came out with its first
[1:24:25.480 --> 1:24:31.480]  piece laying out this argument it seems like every fact checker in the country and now it seems like
[1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:38.440]  fact checking is one of the few you know growth industries left in the united states thousands
[1:24:38.440 --> 1:24:45.720]  of fact checkers they put their pencils down from you know going after the latest covid fact check
[1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:51.640]  to you know going to revolver.news saying here's why revolver's wrong of course they they failed
[1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:57.320]  at that but it was a complete freak out the likes of which really haven't seen since since the trump
[1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:03.560]  days oh you definitely hit a nerve tucker hit a nerve they are squealing me thinks they death
[1:25:03.560 --> 1:25:10.680]  protest too much it's really amazing and we saw a reprisal of this with the tucker show but what's
[1:25:10.680 --> 1:25:15.880]  remarkable about the tucker show at least with the first revolver.news piece you had a piece that
[1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:21.800]  came out you had these mid-width low IQ quote unquote fact checkers do their best and it's
[1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:27.880]  amazing with the resources they have just how lousy their attempt at a fact check actually
[1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:33.080]  well that's right a fact check a three-part series they've never seen right no and that's
[1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:37.240]  what i was going to do is that for this one at least for the revolver one they can pretend to
[1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:44.360]  have read it for the tucker one he literally just sent out a trailer a trailer which was hugely popular
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:51.160]  it garnered i think now it's at 3.2 million views it clocked millions of views very quickly in fact
[1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:58.280]  twitter had to roll out special features in order to uh increase the friction because people were
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:05.320]  spreading it so much but the freak out was intense before anyone ever watched it they heard the term
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:12.440]  false flag they knew that he was going to be giving a huge national platform to the one narrative
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:19.320]  that the regime that the government and its apiratic lackeys in the regime media don't want
[1:26:19.320 --> 1:26:27.560]  the american people to hear or entertain and that's that january six was an inside job in
[1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:34.680]  key respects the key people in the major militia groups imputed to one six are protected mysteriously
[1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:41.480]  by the federal government and there's pretty clear evidence of agents provocateurs and that's a lot of
[1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:47.480]  the stuff that's covered in the tucker documentary and in the various revolver dot news investigative
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:57.480]  pieces well i know this it's just like now abc news nbc news even fox news chris wallis says
[1:26:57.480 --> 1:27:01.480]  no one's preaching critical race theory funny have all the textbooks the training manuals
[1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:06.520]  atn t's doing it it's super racist garbage we and we have it they're doing it it's all over the
[1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:10.600]  country it's taught right here in austin and it's the same thing saying there's no false flags or
[1:27:10.600 --> 1:27:15.080]  no federal provocateurs they just got caught as you write about in michigan the fbi completely
[1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:20.600]  running it i mean so so them trying to deny the stuff they're doing is just not working
[1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:26.680]  it's not working it shouldn't work unfortunately it's working more than it should just because
[1:27:26.680 --> 1:27:32.760]  they have the megaphone still we have we have something and you know credit to tucker you know
[1:27:32.760 --> 1:27:37.560]  we have an alternative media which is a hugely powerful and you're a huge player in that but
[1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:44.440]  in mainstream cable television tucker carlson is the only person in all of american media
[1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:49.800]  willing to touch this narrative he's the lone ranger he's the lone ranger and the fact is like
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:57.080]  people talk about media as oh there's the the marketplace of ideas or they think of the information
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:28:03.560]  economy it operates like they learned the free market does an econ 101 if that were the case
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:11.320]  every single person at fox news every person at msnbc cnn even they would be itching to have
[1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:17.080]  me on to talk about this because it gets huge ratings because there's intense national interest
[1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:23.960]  in this story but curiously nobody's interested in this hugely popular story only tucker has the
[1:28:23.960 --> 1:28:29.960]  guts to cover it on mainstream and and he didn't just cover it he knocked it out of the park i
[1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:34.440]  mean it's a very powerful this is better than the stuff you see on hbo and it's all documented

[1:32:56.360 --> 1:33:12.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:12.280 --> 1:33:15.400]  you
[1:33:25.480 --> 1:33:29.400]  live from austin texas it's alex jones
[1:33:29.400 --> 1:33:36.520]  you
[1:33:37.720 --> 1:33:44.040]  what an incredible time to be alive you know it's it's hard doing my job and it's hard getting
[1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:49.160]  attacked in line about it's hard to see the media take things i've said down a context and then
[1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:55.720]  try to destroy me but it's very satisfying to know that there are people out there like tucker
[1:33:55.720 --> 1:34:01.480]  carlson it's very satisfying know there are people out there like joe rogan who's now fully awake
[1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:08.600]  it's very exciting to know there are people like dr darin j beaty who helped president
[1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:15.080]  trump during his administration and is helping america even more now but this is a big deal
[1:34:16.120 --> 1:34:20.680]  to have a three-part series with millions and millions and millions and millions of viewers
[1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:26.360]  it'll have tens of millions before it's done to raise consciousness about one of the main
[1:34:26.360 --> 1:34:30.920]  tricks that authoritarian governments and regimes pull throughout history world war two started with
[1:34:30.920 --> 1:34:35.320]  a false flag when hitler attacked his own radio station in gliwitz on the border with poland
[1:34:35.320 --> 1:34:40.520]  that's declassified came out of the nuremberg trials the gulf of tonkin got us into vietnam
[1:34:40.520 --> 1:34:47.240]  officially in 64 that was declassified in 2004 the examples of this go on and on operation
[1:34:47.240 --> 1:34:51.880]  northwards was a proposal to attack the us to go to war with cuba in the sub union kennedy said no
[1:34:51.880 --> 1:34:59.400]  they killed him soon after so this is a big deal this stuff goes on and i've experienced it and
[1:34:59.400 --> 1:35:04.440]  let me just briefly tell you what's going on there are white supremacist groups that clearly
[1:35:04.440 --> 1:35:08.440]  you track them they're totally connected to the southern property law center adl democratic party
[1:35:09.160 --> 1:35:13.080]  anti foe which is really german intelligence always has been i just learned from oklahoma
[1:35:13.080 --> 1:35:16.280]  city that german intelligence was heavily involved in that because when you attack your own country
[1:35:16.280 --> 1:35:20.040]  you want to use an outside group to do it so there's even a bigger firewall you understand
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:28.120]  and i mean i i told my security people i said i i would look for for fire bombings of us
[1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:33.800]  and or left as targets at the same time by these people and some of the connected groups
[1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:41.960]  and now i indeed austin fire department looking for arson suspect in connection with fire at
[1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:47.880]  synagogue and again you've got multiple groups you've got patchy groups you've got decoy groups
[1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:51.880]  you've got real white supremacist that have been lured into being run by the feds just like you
[1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:57.640]  saw with the whitmer kidnapping plot and they're just trying to get one of their idiot members wound
[1:35:57.640 --> 1:36:03.240]  up to do something like this and then directly tying it to us and i'm going to leave it at that
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:07.560]  but that's what's currently going on people burning big swastika's the middle of the road and saying
[1:36:07.560 --> 1:36:13.160]  we're here for alex jones alex jones told us to it and then you get the firebombing going on i'm
[1:36:13.160 --> 1:36:18.840]  sure by a different organization or group and so that's the type of things going on right now
[1:36:18.840 --> 1:36:24.600]  so that's how real this is and we're entering the season of this when the left is totally desperate
[1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:32.040]  the globalists are desperate and when bill clinton was 20 points behind in 2000 and in 1995 he then
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:38.120]  bragged in 1996 on air force one in front of the whole media that he owed his 96 reelection
[1:36:38.120 --> 1:36:42.840]  to the oklahoma city bombing and now that was blamed on talk radio and conservatives and so
[1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:47.400]  that's why the elaheem city southern prairie law center ran that compound informant said that the
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:53.480]  feds uh were were basically running the attack let it happen and that even came out in court so
[1:36:53.480 --> 1:37:00.760]  dr bd please continue yes well absolutely like we were saying the effect that this narrative
[1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:08.440]  has had i don't think we can explain it simply by confining the issue to one six itself itself
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:14.360]  however big this is and i think i guess it's worth saying why does one six matter yes it's about
[1:37:14.360 --> 1:37:21.800]  the prisoners being held unjustly in abu greib like conditions yes it's about the people who
[1:37:21.800 --> 1:37:27.240]  are present who are being treated unfairly but in a much larger sense it's about
[1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:35.000]  about 70 80 plus million americans who are trump supporters or simply don't like the direction that
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:42.360]  the american regime is going who are effectively cast as domestic terrorists by their own government
[1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:49.160]  on the basis of the false narratives surrounding one six that's one thing and that's frankly big
[1:37:49.160 --> 1:37:55.400]  enough that's big enough to explain the extreme public interest in this on one hand and the extreme
[1:37:55.400 --> 1:38:00.680]  freak out on the part of the government and the media on the other hand when we expose this and
[1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:07.320]  when tucker exposes this but i think it's even bigger than that because up until this point
[1:38:07.320 --> 1:38:12.760]  unless you know people who are regular viewers of your show they're more informed than the average
[1:38:12.760 --> 1:38:19.720]  public but i would i think it's safe to say that the average conservative until very recently till
[1:38:19.720 --> 1:38:26.600]  just several years ago it wouldn't occur to someone like that that the government was involved in
[1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:32.040]  these kinds of things that the government was capable of setting up its own citizens and the
[1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:39.240]  fact has a long history of doing exactly that quite the contrary conservatives tend to want to
[1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:46.120]  venerate institutions of authority like the fb i like the cia like the do d and so forth
[1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:53.080]  and conservatives are just getting it a taste a very bitter taste of what the government actually
[1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:59.640]  is what it does what it's capable of the entire national security apparatus and they're you're
[1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:05.720]  they're reacting accordingly and i think that's something that really freaks out the media
[1:39:05.720 --> 1:39:13.000]  they don't want people to look at the lies of one six and start to ask what other events
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:19.560]  have they been lying to us about what other events has marik garland been lying to us about
[1:39:19.560 --> 1:39:25.480]  because this is not marik garland's first rodeo as i pointed out he's been on the domestic terrorism
[1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:33.160]  beat for decades now that's absolutely right and we cannot stress enough that this is a total
[1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:38.600]  rebranding from al qaeda or the russians or the chinese you know there's actual real groups radical
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:44.120]  islamic you name it which they've overblown and used to take away a lot of our rights and a lot
[1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:49.720]  of real liberals like jonathan terley law professors warned 20 years ago patriot act will be used on
[1:39:49.720 --> 1:39:54.280]  americans and since then it has been expanded and now they're not just saying it's going to be used
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:58.680]  they're saying the main focus is the american people and they're doing things that civil rights
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:04.280]  groups decried when it happened to you know members of al qaeda but now it's happening to us and the
[1:40:04.280 --> 1:40:11.880]  left is praising us so so so this is very very dangerous yes no it's extremely dangerous and
[1:40:12.440 --> 1:40:19.000]  again you know where a lot of people on the right are dispositionally inclined to look at
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:24.440]  the national security state as their friend as the you know the military the do d as their friend
[1:40:24.440 --> 1:40:30.280]  even as the fb is their friend well things have changed it probably wasn't like that ever but if
[1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:37.160]  it ever was it's not like that now and people are seeing how dramatically that is the case in the
[1:40:37.160 --> 1:40:44.200]  specific instance of one six the lies told about one six and more importantly than the lies themselves
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:50.360]  what the regime media and the regime itself is the agenda they're trying to shove down our
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:56.360]  throats on the basis of those lies well you're right this isn't about credit as you know dr
[1:40:56.360 --> 1:41:06.360]  bd but people need to understand this is the equivalent of like in football uh a long past
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:12.440]  to your receivers i mean this is their main move is saying we're terrorist uh banning our speech
[1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:16.440]  censoring us and and coming after american people and they're not beating these drums
[1:41:16.440 --> 1:41:21.480]  everywhere and doing all this for no reason they really intend i believe not let us have real mid
[1:41:21.480 --> 1:41:26.680]  terms and not let us have a real election coming up in 2024 and they want to bring in a permanent
[1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:34.360]  authoritarian state using covet restrictions as just the training wheels yes no absolutely absolutely
[1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:41.240]  and if actually if i could break a little bit of news here here on air with you um revolver.news
[1:41:41.240 --> 1:41:48.200]  just ran a piece exclusive revolver news pieces that congressman matt gates and uh many other
[1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:56.200]  uh members of congress have just issued a uh demand to attorney general merit garland who's
[1:41:56.200 --> 1:42:01.400]  been avoiding their questions sidestepping their questions their demand is very specific
[1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:09.000]  they want to know whether any individual who's listed in the fbi's original most wanted for
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:16.280]  january 6 they want to know if anyone who is listed on that most wanted list and who's been taken off
[1:42:16.280 --> 1:42:21.560]  has any prior relationship with the federal government as an informant and this is directly
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:28.120]  related to a specific individual that we covered in an extensive investigative piece called ray epps
[1:42:28.120 --> 1:42:34.920]  who can be seen on video everywhere seemingly inciting the mob saying we need to go into the
[1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:40.360]  capital up to the day before he was one of the first 20 people that the fbi put on their most
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:46.920]  wanted list and then curiously and very quietly months later after revolver's story saying hey

[1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:20.200]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france notice that people who ate certain

[1:45:37.960 --> 1:45:43.160]  effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually
[1:45:43.160 --> 1:45:49.000]  acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:55.240]  responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to info wars life dot com and
[1:45:55.240 --> 1:46:01.960]  grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets i'm sitting here it's in the early morning hours
[1:46:01.960 --> 1:46:09.240]  and i'm looking at mainstream news reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door
[1:46:09.240 --> 1:46:15.080]  fda has come out and said that the moderna and phyzer shots need to be held up and not authorized
[1:46:15.080 --> 1:46:20.120]  for children because he and studies they did on children it caused myocarditis that's heart
[1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:25.560]  swelling and heart attacks and then i noticed that even though this is even in the associated press
[1:46:25.560 --> 1:46:29.880]  it's not getting any circulation it's not on the national news and it's very hard to even
[1:46:29.880 --> 1:46:35.960]  find on places like instagram or twitter it's just crazy and then fauci was on tv just yesterday
[1:46:35.960 --> 1:46:40.280]  saying there's no damage from the vaccines it doesn't hurt anybody your conspiracy theorists
[1:46:40.280 --> 1:46:45.240]  if you say it it's just crazy and then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and
[1:46:45.240 --> 1:46:49.240]  said these vaccines are going to cause heart problems they gave the exact reasons why and
[1:46:49.240 --> 1:46:54.520]  now it happened that's why info wars is on air because if we weren't on air they get away with
[1:46:54.520 --> 1:47:02.520]  even more of this crap this is just insane these people are killers you're listening to the alex
[1:47:02.520 --> 1:47:18.440]  jones show
[1:47:33.400 --> 1:47:47.480]  we are back final segment with dr darin j beaty revolver.news at darin j beaty on twitter
[1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:53.560]  and he's right at the heart really the progenitor of getting tucker carlson to deeply research this
[1:47:54.200 --> 1:47:58.680]  and come out with this incredibly bold and accurate and well done and truthful
[1:47:58.680 --> 1:48:04.360]  maverick transmission that is the plot against the people i haven't watched part three yet
[1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:08.600]  but i'm going to be watching it this evening with my wife and children
[1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:13.560]  doc recap the big announcement the article just went live 10 minutes ago while you were on
[1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:18.440]  air with us at your revolver the inside scoop members of congress getting together and saying
[1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:24.920]  we want specifics now on the individuals that have not been arrested that were there leading
[1:48:24.920 --> 1:48:33.560]  the attack on the capital yes and so in the previous questioning of a g garland uh as you
[1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:40.040]  probably saw uh congressman massie really elevated the question of ray epps to the national stage
[1:48:40.040 --> 1:48:45.560]  when he posed a question to garland said hey see this guy in the video calling for people
[1:48:45.560 --> 1:48:50.600]  going into the capital what's the deal with this guy and garland sidestepped it with the
[1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:57.240]  usual deflection saying oh we can't comment on any ongoing investigation and so in revolver news
[1:48:57.240 --> 1:49:04.040]  is extensive piece on epps we suggested a question that couldn't be evaded so easily and that's a
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:11.000]  question that now i can say is breaking news in this revolver piece uh congressman gates has asked
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:17.640]  in an official letter to the attorney general that's been signed on by a number of really hard
[1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:26.120]  hitting members of congress including massie uh paul gosar andy bigs gohmert and marjorie taylor green
[1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:33.720]  and and others and the question is um following january six were there people that you took off
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:39.880]  of any of the most wanted lists that were federal assets or federal agents if so did any of the
[1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:45.240]  decisions to remove those people come as a consequence of cooperation between the federal
[1:49:45.240 --> 1:49:50.680]  government and the people that were animating the violence we look forward to your truthful
[1:49:50.680 --> 1:49:57.240]  and transparent response now that is not a theoretical question that's a question that is specific
[1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:05.720]  to one person to the only person in the mountains of video documentary footage of january six and
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:12.680]  fifth the only person to say we need to go into the capital to say it repeatedly to say it the
[1:50:12.680 --> 1:50:19.080]  night before to rouse people all different groups with different interests to refocus them on the
[1:50:19.080 --> 1:50:26.360]  state admission of going into the capital the same man ray epps who is seen right at the barricades
[1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:31.960]  as trump was speaking before the whole crowd came in who was seen at the barricades he whispers
[1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:38.280]  into somebody's ear and that somebody two seconds later breaks down the barricades for the first
[1:50:38.280 --> 1:50:43.160]  time incidentally that person who broke down the barricades is the person in the clip you showed
[1:50:43.160 --> 1:50:49.400]  from the tucker film who got beaten up in prison that guy's in prison getting beaten up the guy
[1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:55.240]  who appears to be one of the key orchestrators of that initial breach nowhere to be seen the feds
[1:50:55.240 --> 1:51:01.800]  put them on their most wanted list the day after revolver ran a major report exposing certain
[1:51:01.800 --> 1:51:07.000]  elements of possible fed involvement they scrubbed him and we've heard nothing since what did you
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:13.320]  think of how the film handled epps and and tracking down all that no i thought it was i thought it
[1:51:13.320 --> 1:51:19.320]  was very strong and i'm glad that most recently people have followed up on all the reporting on
[1:51:19.320 --> 1:51:24.040]  epps tracked him down his ranch and say hey you know what's what's the deal with you what's you
[1:51:24.040 --> 1:51:30.040]  know of course you don't get any answer from him but it's encouraging to see that people have taken
[1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:36.280]  an interest in this and i think part of the reason that the epps piece specifically has taken off
[1:51:36.280 --> 1:51:43.080]  so much is that there's just such a natural virality to the videos i think there are other cases that
[1:51:43.080 --> 1:51:49.160]  revolver is covered that i think are equally important and maybe even more so and more suspicious
[1:51:49.160 --> 1:51:55.480]  but the virality of the video pertaining to epps and his behavior on january 5th and january 6th
[1:51:55.480 --> 1:52:02.200]  is so powerful it's so direct it's so explicit and any ordinary person watching this especially
[1:52:02.200 --> 1:52:10.360]  after seeing the people just hold up in prison for comparatively very trivial things you have to ask
[1:52:10.360 --> 1:52:15.560]  what's the deal with this guy well absolutely but also look at look at jade next they let him out of
[1:52:15.560 --> 1:52:20.120]  jail and we're going to drop it until we all made a big deal about it first it's 40 000 then 70 000
[1:52:20.120 --> 1:52:24.280]  then 90 000 now we're learning more paid by seeing and others he's on the next day with
[1:52:24.840 --> 1:52:28.840]  anderson cooper he's got this female he's on video saying i told you we were going to do this
[1:52:28.840 --> 1:52:32.520]  i told you we're going to take it over he's telling everybody burn it down the day before burn it down
[1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:38.840]  that day he's antifa and then they have the uh the gall to say oh there was no antifa there that
[1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:44.040]  day either even though we have them putting on trumped style gear over their black uniforms in the
[1:52:44.040 --> 1:52:51.880]  woods now very very good point uh jade next is an important figure whom we cover also in the
[1:52:51.880 --> 1:52:57.640]  piece on rey epps he's seen in various clips standing next to rey epps ironically uh rey epps's
[1:52:57.640 --> 1:53:04.840]  remarks are so egregious and explicit that even jade next says uh i don't know this is a little bit
[1:53:04.840 --> 1:53:11.080]  too fed for me but one sort of footnote to what you've said about uh jade next is that
[1:53:12.040 --> 1:53:19.000]  initially a lot of the right sees upon jade next and his uh affiliation with antifa groups
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:24.520]  say that oh look it was antifa doing this and there might be some truth to that but i think it's
[1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:30.680]  worth pointing out what we cover in the article which is that antifa is a horrible organization
[1:53:30.680 --> 1:53:36.520]  in the grand scheme of things and tifa is a paramilitary force for the corrupt establishment
[1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:44.200]  but still you have a lot of uh uh just miscreant types in antifa and they do have a suspicion to
[1:53:44.200 --> 1:53:49.880]  law enforcement and infiltration themselves and in fact a lot of the earliest literature
[1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:57.880]  basically exposing jade and x's uh bizarre uh associations with government was antifa comes
[1:53:57.880 --> 1:54:04.120]  from antifa and so let's be clear let's be clear to say this was an antifa attack is to cover up
[1:54:04.120 --> 1:54:09.400]  uh that it's a deeper deep state leftist justice department operation i totally agree with you
[1:54:09.400 --> 1:54:15.480]  let's cut out the middleman the the guy who was apparently antifa was infiltrating antifa just
[1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:21.480]  like he was infiltrating the other group absolutely cut out the middleman all roads lead to the feds
[1:54:21.480 --> 1:54:25.960]  themselves all roads lead to the feds i haven't seen part three yet have you seen it i can't wait
[1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:32.840]  to see it i've not seen it yet i hope to see it tonight as well all right dr beady at revolver.news
[1:54:32.840 --> 1:54:37.400]  at darin j beady on twitter thank you so much you got 60 seconds left any closing comments
[1:54:38.600 --> 1:54:43.640]  well my closing comments are i hope that as people look at one six and start to ask questions
[1:54:43.640 --> 1:54:48.520]  about one six they'll take a broader perspective and start to look at what the government's been
[1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:53.560]  doing because this didn't happen yesterday it didn't happen months ago with michigan it's been going
[1:54:53.560 --> 1:54:59.880]  on a very long time so wake up learn the history of it you've been great on covering this stuff
[1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:05.960]  alex so i hope people dig into the archives and for starters look into oklahoma city which might
[1:55:05.960 --> 1:55:10.920]  be a very interesting thing and that actually features none other than maryc garland who took
[1:55:10.920 --> 1:55:17.160]  a key role in that case absolutely interesting thanks to come and as much as they've done in
[1:55:17.160 --> 1:55:22.520]  the past they're clearly building up now for this to be the whole new authoritarian system in america
[1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:28.120]  i mean this is the war footing this is the u.s policy it's not russia it's not china it's not
[1:55:28.120 --> 1:55:33.320]  radical islam it's us and again i'm just really glad that you and tucker carlson the general public

[2:00:05.880 --> 2:00:11.080]  he's with us in about six minutes but right now let's play a few clips from this part two of tucker
[2:00:11.080 --> 2:00:16.120]  carlson's new amazing anti-false flag program to plot against the people here's a few clips
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:24.040]  so the republican party i just want them to hear this message look at this crowd we are the people
[2:00:24.040 --> 2:00:31.160]  that you must represent or we're going to replace you with patriots and so that's what january the
[2:00:31.160 --> 2:00:35.320]  six was all about it was just about making sure that if you called yourself a conservative that
[2:00:35.320 --> 2:00:42.920]  you stood with the conservative movement and unfortunately it spiraled out of control we
[2:00:42.920 --> 2:00:47.800]  coordinated with the u.s. Capitol police nearly every day a lot of people don't know that stop the
[2:00:47.800 --> 2:00:52.920]  seal actually had a permit on the capital ground so not the capital itself and not the capital
[2:00:52.920 --> 2:00:57.560]  plaza the the capital grounds law eight we had a permit so you let's just imagine this
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:04.440]  20 to 50 thousand people inside the president's park we're sitting there at the very front i'm
[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:09.880]  dead center of the president front row a trump campaign staffer walks up to me and says you know
[2:01:09.880 --> 2:01:15.640]  i'll leave there are people leaving the overflow and there are already tens of thousands of people
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:21.720]  at the u.s. Capitol with your presence and the presence of alex jones why don't you guys walk
[2:01:21.720 --> 2:01:28.680]  down pennsylvania gather people together and then position them for your rally on lot eight
[2:01:29.400 --> 2:01:36.280]  i wasn't at the capital when it descended into chaos and uh that's only by god's grace because
[2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:40.520]  i was scheduled to be there secret service let us out at a point where we would have been there
[2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:48.280]  when the first punch was thrown and that's strange the only reason that we weren't there
[2:01:48.280 --> 2:02:00.280]  is because we stopped and gave an impromptu speech i get a text from the campaign that you should get
[2:02:00.280 --> 2:02:09.480]  there and de-escalate because things are not going well so we started to approach the side of the
[2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:16.120]  capital where no protest had happened in november no protest had happened in december all i thought
[2:02:16.120 --> 2:02:20.520]  was i need to get them to the other side and i need to get them to lot eight let's march around
[2:02:20.520 --> 2:02:26.040]  to the other side uh and all we have are equipped with are our megaphones and let's not fight the
[2:02:26.040 --> 2:02:32.040]  police and get the system what they want maybe a thousand people are listening to us come out the
[2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:38.440]  stands and 75 to a hundred thousand people there in front of us and it was a very helpless feeling
[2:02:38.440 --> 2:02:55.160]  as a psychological operations officer we may or may not be interested in influencing an
[2:02:55.160 --> 2:03:00.200]  insurrection in other countries if you were going to do that hypothetically you wouldn't do that
[2:03:00.200 --> 2:03:06.200]  by telling a group of a million people to come to the capital peaceably assemble and just bring
[2:03:06.200 --> 2:03:13.880]  your american flags so if that was an insurrection it was the most poorly conducted insurrection
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:21.720]  ever if it wasn't an insurrection then what was it special operations uses the military
[2:03:21.720 --> 2:03:28.920]  deception tactic of a false flag abroad against the enemies of america a false flag is anytime you
[2:03:28.920 --> 2:03:34.760]  want to frame another group so that you can then take action against that group it is my opinion
[2:03:34.760 --> 2:03:42.920]  that false flags have happened in this country one of which may have been january 6th and dhs
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:47.800]  says the coming 20th anniversary of the 9 11 attacks and religious holidays later this year
[2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:54.200]  could be catalysts for violence fear is one of the biggest tactics used in psychological operations
[2:03:54.200 --> 2:04:02.280]  so what we're seeing is fear being used to manipulate the military to see millions of americans
[2:04:02.280 --> 2:04:10.280]  as domestic terrorists and to try to silence people there is a fear that if you are conservative
[2:04:10.280 --> 2:04:15.400]  and you're in the military that you will be singled out that you will be looked at with suspicion
[2:04:15.400 --> 2:04:20.360]  that your clearance may be in question all right folks and that's why they're having these litmus
[2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:25.800]  tests about the shots and litmus test about critical race theory and then saying it doesn't exist
[2:04:25.800 --> 2:04:31.560]  this is a takeover and and yes ladies and gentlemen they tried to scyop us on january 6th it didn't
[2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:37.240]  go off as big as the feds wanted but it almost did and now they're trying to use it as the pretext
[2:04:37.240 --> 2:04:44.840]  to really come after us all and that will be after they stage big false flags so it's important to
[2:04:44.840 --> 2:04:49.880]  expose the fact of false flags existing so that we know what to look for and so we know that if
[2:04:49.880 --> 2:04:53.880]  they pull it they're the ones that are behind it they have the history of it and they have the motive
[2:04:53.880 --> 2:05:04.440]  and they're preparing us for it october 2021 is coming to a close and that means it's our yearly

[2:06:25.400 --> 2:06:33.560]  all right we covered in the last hour with one of the main researchers from tucker carlson's
[2:06:33.560 --> 2:06:42.920]  incredibly important seminal national peace on false flags as my mission the last 28 years
[2:06:42.920 --> 2:06:48.600]  to expose false flags is one of the main ways the globalist would come to power to now see it
[2:06:48.600 --> 2:06:53.560]  on the mass scale reaching tens of millions of people is another real sign of our success
[2:06:53.560 --> 2:06:58.920]  and all glory goes to god when it comes to the whole spiritual front but god works through us
[2:06:58.920 --> 2:07:05.560]  god works through you and it's been your tireless support of the broadcast and your prayer your word
[2:07:05.560 --> 2:07:10.840]  of mouth and your financials of buying products that has kept us in attack formation because we're
[2:07:10.840 --> 2:07:15.320]  not on the defense we're on the offense going after the globalist all you got to be willing to do
[2:07:15.320 --> 2:07:20.680]  is take action do your research and be willing to go to prison or die i'm i'm here to do it
[2:07:20.680 --> 2:07:27.800]  i'm not the hero i would i would die to do this and i certainly might uh but that's okay because
[2:07:27.800 --> 2:07:32.280]  that's where i want to be these people must be met they must be faced they must be dealt with
[2:07:32.280 --> 2:07:37.080]  they are enemies and denying or under attack or trying to join the enemy is delusional
[2:07:37.080 --> 2:07:44.840]  this is pure evil your soul's real get right with god but i have to tell you it is all coming to a
[2:07:44.840 --> 2:07:50.120]  head and out of all the painful things we've been through together as a family and that's all you
[2:07:50.120 --> 2:07:55.960]  the viewers and listeners and our stations and the crew we are a family it is so satisfying
[2:07:57.320 --> 2:08:04.200]  to see so many really well known successful people put their careers on the line to tell the truth
[2:08:04.200 --> 2:08:09.320]  and be good people like joe rogan now is doing i told you a year ago joe's totally waking up
[2:08:09.320 --> 2:08:14.200]  soon as he's in a position to tell the truth he's going to do it he's done it i told you told you
[2:08:14.200 --> 2:08:17.000]  the same thing years ago about tucker carlson they're like when you got tucker carlson at your
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:21.160]  office 10 years ago that guy wears a bow tie he's kind of a liberal republican i said no
[2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:25.800]  tuckers waking up i don't want somebody's for real and when they're not and and it's not like
[2:08:26.360 --> 2:08:30.760]  those of us that woke up before somebody else can get mad at those that weren't totally awake before
[2:08:30.760 --> 2:08:35.320]  this is a process what matters is is they wake up that means they weren't evil they just weren't
[2:08:35.320 --> 2:08:39.960]  aware of all this because they were projecting their own goodness onto people joe rogan's a really
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:47.560]  nice hard-working good guy so tucker carlson just a family guy and for them to really come to grips
[2:08:47.560 --> 2:08:52.760]  with this has been a process they're just as smart as i am or smarter now once they've got it they
[2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:57.560]  don't need alex jones they call me up and tell me oh hey you see this you see that especially joe
[2:08:57.560 --> 2:09:03.080]  i mean he is really really awake and and that's exciting but don't think it's just joe rogan or
[2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:07.480]  you know somebody like tucker carlson is going to save us it's going to be you
[2:09:07.480 --> 2:09:12.600]  and your word of mouth and you speaking out and you saying no to this system that's launching all
[2:09:12.600 --> 2:09:17.160]  the coveted hysteria and the forced injections and all the tyranny because they are in a serious

[2:12:34.840 --> 2:12:41.480]  humanity is currently under attack by an antagonistic and deadly foe an enemy that
[2:12:41.480 --> 2:12:48.440]  must hide in the shadows to survive but there is always a money trail and money is their only real
[2:12:48.440 --> 2:12:55.880]  power so to find the real enemy we must follow the money in the documentary monopoly who owns the
[2:12:55.880 --> 2:13:02.360]  world tim gilin does an excellent job of doing this while there appears to be hundreds of
[2:13:02.360 --> 2:13:08.280]  independent companies producing food they are practically all owned by the same small group
[2:13:08.280 --> 2:13:15.480]  of companies these companies are controlled by their top shareholders financial institutions
[2:13:15.480 --> 2:13:22.920]  such as berkshire hathaway vanguard black rock and state street this is also who owns
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:31.640]  silicone valley big tech the airline industry the steel industry agriculture the textile and
[2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:41.160]  clothing industry both the oil and solar panel industry tobacco alcohol pharmaceutical electronics
[2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:47.960]  and banking just about everything in today's modern world is owned and controlled by these same
[2:13:47.960 --> 2:13:57.320]  financial institutions who are also invested in each other forming a pyramid of financial power
[2:13:57.320 --> 2:14:03.800]  topped by black rock and vanguard black rock loans money to the federal reserve bank
[2:14:04.360 --> 2:14:13.400]  advises them and developed their software system black rock itself is owned by vanguard and vanguard
[2:14:13.400 --> 2:14:19.960]  sitting on top of the world pyramid keeps its shareholders private but we know that the majority
[2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:26.760]  of wealth has been accumulated by inheritance and monopoly and the same few families have owned
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:36.520]  most of the world for generations families such as rothchild rockefeller dupont morgan and bush
[2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:44.440]  operating through nonprofit foundations these unelected families are able to rule over the
[2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:52.680]  world like kings this is the way it has always been whether it be via ferro royalty papal
[2:14:52.680 --> 2:15:00.280]  supremacy dictator or investment banker mankind has always been managed by the rich and powerful
[2:15:01.080 --> 2:15:07.560]  freedom is a dream yet to be fully realized in this world after the american revolution
[2:15:07.560 --> 2:15:13.960]  our forefathers gave us the tools to realize this dream of self-governance in the constitution
[2:15:13.960 --> 2:15:20.600]  and the bill of rights tools that will be stripped away unless mankind decides
[2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:27.320]  to stand and face their enemy here we need a vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength
[2:15:27.320 --> 2:15:36.520]  of the global private sector with trillions at his disposal far beyond global gdp and with
[2:15:36.520 --> 2:15:43.320]  the greatest respect beyond even the governments of the world's leaders it offers the only real

[2:17:59.240 --> 2:18:04.360]  i want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world it's very very simple
[2:18:04.360 --> 2:18:10.760]  but the most people don't know the privately owned central banks of the world are artificially
[2:18:10.760 --> 2:18:17.400]  creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and using them to buy up
[2:18:17.400 --> 2:18:24.680]  infrastructure intellectual property energy they're using it to buy people to buy influence
[2:18:25.400 --> 2:18:30.040]  and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that
[2:18:30.040 --> 2:18:34.760]  manipulate markets but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it
[2:18:34.760 --> 2:18:39.960]  would cause massive inflation now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every
[2:18:39.960 --> 2:18:45.720]  sector of the world economy buying up everything not to have the companies operate but to actually
[2:18:45.720 --> 2:18:51.480]  shut them down and force a collapse of civilization making the companies they do fund the only
[2:18:51.480 --> 2:18:56.040]  things left handed this is the great reset this is what's happening now warn everyone it's the
[2:18:56.040 --> 2:19:01.640]  only way to stop it the average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware
[2:19:01.640 --> 2:19:07.240]  that there's a war between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on
[2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:13.000]  the other who are literally trying to create a post-human world from the united states of brazil
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:17.880]  and of course triggered by the bricks of the uk nations were pulling out of the private corporate
[2:19:17.880 --> 2:19:22.600]  fascist world government that's why they launched their great recess and their program after
[2:19:22.600 --> 2:19:30.920]  collapsing us of build back better this is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of
[2:19:30.920 --> 2:19:36.040]  the world economy because they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow because the left
[2:19:36.600 --> 2:19:42.360]  which is the ideology of this world government system could win they released a biological weapon
[2:19:42.360 --> 2:19:48.600]  on us now we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago it's that simple they can't
[2:19:48.600 --> 2:19:54.040]  meet us because of our free speech and our guns so the global corporate combine released COVID-19
[2:19:54.040 --> 2:19:57.080]  and you know the rest of history expose this paradigm and we win
[2:19:57.080 --> 2:20:18.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[2:21:57.240 --> 2:22:01.480]  for coming on judge good to have you here with us alex what a pleasure to be with you my friend
[2:22:01.480 --> 2:22:07.000]  that has been about seven or eight years the last time i came on all hell broke loose but now i'm
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:11.560]  free to join you my dear friend all right well it's i always love seeing the speeches you give
[2:22:11.560 --> 2:22:15.640]  and the interviews you give and the amazing points you make especially some of those events you've had
[2:22:15.640 --> 2:22:20.840]  with our uh a mutual friend gerald salante what do you want to get into first because you're kind
[2:22:20.840 --> 2:22:24.920]  of the master of all this stuff i mean wow everything you warned about decades ago it's come
[2:22:24.920 --> 2:22:31.480]  true this is crazy what what you just uh pointed out in the city of san francisco of course is an
[2:22:31.480 --> 2:22:36.840]  edict issued by a health commissioner by the mayor it's not a law enacted by the legislature
[2:22:36.840 --> 2:22:43.480]  of california it's not an ordinance enacted by the city government of san francisco so the first
[2:22:43.480 --> 2:22:47.640]  thing people need to know and they probably already know this but i'll remind them of it anyway
[2:22:48.200 --> 2:22:54.200]  is that laws in america can only be written by legislative bodies just because a mayor or a
[2:22:54.200 --> 2:23:00.280]  governor or the president although old joe hasn't gotten around to signing his executive order yet
[2:23:00.280 --> 2:23:06.200]  but just because the chief executive of a governmental unit issues an edict and calls
[2:23:06.200 --> 2:23:14.520]  it a law doesn't make it a law there is no statute state federal or local anywhere in the united
[2:23:14.520 --> 2:23:20.600]  states of america that requires people to be vaccinated or to wear masks the impetus for all
[2:23:20.600 --> 2:23:26.920]  this are edicts issued by the executive branch commandeering the police to enforce it and now
[2:23:26.920 --> 2:23:30.760]  threatening to keep kids out of school and fire people who work for the government
[2:23:30.760 --> 2:23:36.120]  who won't comply with these mandates every single one of them is unconstitutional for that
[2:23:36.120 --> 2:23:41.720]  reason alone that they're not enacted by a legislative body you know i don't need to go
[2:23:41.720 --> 2:23:47.960]  over your curriculum vitae and the fact that uh you are very famous well respected uh judge and
[2:23:47.960 --> 2:23:53.080]  all the letters and and and what you've spoken about i mean i know to be true but i'm not a
[2:23:53.080 --> 2:23:58.280]  lawyer and on its face i know that these are edicts these are out of control just like biden said
[2:23:58.280 --> 2:24:03.320]  months ago got to do it and never even signed an order you know he claims that's coming so if i know
[2:24:03.320 --> 2:24:09.000]  that don't all these other judges in the supreme court that have been going along with this know
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:16.360]  that and so why are they doing this the the only reason i can suspect is fear i was actually stunned
[2:24:16.360 --> 2:24:21.080]  at the midnight decision of the supreme court about three or four days ago involving healthcare
[2:24:21.080 --> 2:24:27.720]  workers in the state of main so these are public and private employees who filed for a religious
[2:24:27.720 --> 2:24:34.120]  exemption whatever their religion is they're sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them
[2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:38.520]  from taking a vaccine whether it's because you you think there's something in the vaccine that
[2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:43.720]  came from an abortion or because you think it's against your religion to take an experimental
[2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:50.600]  uh drug which of course is against uh federal law and international law whatever the reason is
[2:24:51.160 --> 2:24:56.200]  it's a sincerely held religious belief in the supreme court rejected that in his descent
[2:24:56.200 --> 2:25:01.960]  justice gorsuch a donald trump appointee said wait a minute aren't we the same supreme court
[2:25:01.960 --> 2:25:08.280]  that just six months ago upheld the religious exemption so the only thing i can think of is
[2:25:08.280 --> 2:25:15.640]  that this is a preliminary ruling not a final ruling and not on the merits but it's dead wrong
[2:25:15.640 --> 2:25:22.440]  because preliminarily the first freedom in the first amendment s lost also freedom of speech
[2:25:22.440 --> 2:25:28.360]  freedom speech freedom of the press no it's freedom of religion so sincerely held religious beliefs
[2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:33.880]  trump everything in america and the supreme court recognized that as recently alexa six
[2:25:33.880 --> 2:25:40.280]  months ago but six days ago refused to follow its own ruling and is allowing this dictator
[2:25:40.280 --> 2:25:46.360]  governor in main to get away with another edict it's not even legislation enacted by the main
[2:25:46.360 --> 2:25:51.480]  legislature and again that's congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of
[2:25:51.480 --> 2:25:56.040]  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof people think it's the country started over guns or
[2:25:56.040 --> 2:25:59.960]  taxes that was secondary it correct me if i'm wrong was really about religious freedom people were
[2:25:59.960 --> 2:26:04.920]  sick of the church of england and all the rest of people telling them what they had to do people
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:12.680]  were sick of being told how to worship god and alex they were taxed in america for the church
[2:26:12.680 --> 2:26:20.440]  of england when madison was a congressman at the time wrote the bill of rights he was determined
[2:26:20.440 --> 2:26:27.640]  to build a wall of separation between church and state and he did and as i said as i said as
[2:26:27.640 --> 2:26:35.320]  recently as a six months ago the roman catholic diocese of brooklyn and three synagogues sued
[2:26:35.320 --> 2:26:42.600]  then governor andrew qualmo the supreme court took about 15 minutes to reverse the qualmo edicts
[2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:49.000]  which limited the number of people who could go into a cathedral yet a 1200 c cathedral limited
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:56.040]  to 25 people you have 400 seats synagogue he limited it to 25 people you could put 500 people
[2:26:56.600 --> 2:27:03.320]  in walmart you could put 500 people in any kind of a large shopping facility but not a place of
[2:27:03.320 --> 2:27:09.960]  worship the supreme court rejected it and said freedom of religion trumps governmental need
[2:27:09.960 --> 2:27:16.600]  now why they didn't say it in the vaccine case involving main i don't know sometimes i know the
[2:27:16.600 --> 2:27:23.640]  way they think why the naked attack why the naked attack in your opinion this is a social question
[2:27:23.640 --> 2:27:29.720]  by the left on on religion and and the first amendment just to show the censorship not just
[2:27:29.720 --> 2:27:34.840]  going after the churches they're just they're just a total they're just totally authoritarian well
[2:27:34.840 --> 2:27:40.760]  the left hates religion because they can't control it because it it represents a relationship between
[2:27:40.760 --> 2:27:47.480]  individuals to god who is superior to them and and their instruments of government the left
[2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:53.880]  was once a strong there still are some people on the aclu and some people on the left but not
[2:27:53.880 --> 2:28:00.600]  the aoc crowd that crowd would just assume get a get get rid of the first amendment because it's
[2:28:00.600 --> 2:28:07.400]  an obstacle to the furtherance of their goals their goals of course is to take away our liberty
[2:28:07.400 --> 2:28:11.640]  and take away our property and distribute everything to everybody as they think it should
[2:28:11.640 --> 2:28:17.240]  be distributed that of course would require them to take away the constitution and probably to
[2:28:17.240 --> 2:28:22.680]  take away our lives before they could get away with that all right i'm excited to have him judge

[2:28:27.800 --> 2:28:32.520]  there in his books at judge nap dot com and he's been really attacked by the left for standing

[2:32:03.480 --> 2:32:08.760]  to destroy the middle class in any form of upward mobility you've got to divide and conquer the
[2:32:08.760 --> 2:32:14.200]  public so they don't know they're being targeted that's why the fortune 100 have wrapped themselves
[2:32:14.200 --> 2:32:20.200]  the name of lb gt and african-american rights and all the rest of it all over the world that's now
[2:32:20.200 --> 2:32:25.000]  their corporate face while they run slave camps in africa and in communist china and many other
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:30.200]  areas while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through the big tech and the
[2:32:30.200 --> 2:32:35.000]  central banks and other zone so this is a criminal takeover and when you look at the new
[2:32:36.280 --> 2:32:42.280]  superclass it's the politicians it's the corporate media it's the police it's the bureaucrats it's
[2:32:42.280 --> 2:32:46.680]  members of congress and their staff and their families it's the white house hell it's postal
[2:32:46.680 --> 2:32:53.240]  workers who were all exempt from the poison shots but not the general public and everybody else
[2:32:53.240 --> 2:33:01.160]  through corporate rule so this is the true discrimination that's going on you're listening
[2:33:01.160 --> 2:33:02.920]  to the alex jones show
[2:33:11.480 --> 2:33:16.120]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[2:33:16.120 --> 2:33:23.640]  well i gotta tell you i said this for many years the smartest person on fox news was
[2:33:23.640 --> 2:33:28.280]  judge andrew napolitano because he knew his history he knew what was going on i've got a clip
[2:33:29.240 --> 2:33:34.280]  from 2013 where he talks about the history of the fbi being behind almost every domestic
[2:33:34.280 --> 2:33:40.040]  tarot plot that's the special you know political units around to the whole fbi is bad but today
[2:33:40.040 --> 2:33:45.240]  with you see the the plot against the governor being run by the fbi in michigan and we see
[2:33:45.240 --> 2:33:50.440]  the january six clearly feds heavily involved with provocateurs being protected but nonviolent
[2:33:50.440 --> 2:33:55.880]  people still being held in jail judge andrew napolitano i know you've got a lot to say on
[2:33:55.880 --> 2:34:01.480]  the misdeeds of the justice department itself and and really what should be done about this
[2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:06.200]  because it's becoming more and more evident uh that it i mean they it just came out that they
[2:34:06.200 --> 2:34:12.600]  hid an hd video they had of kyle written house being shot at uh before he fires back to defend
[2:34:12.600 --> 2:34:18.920]  himself open and shut uh right to defense here what's going on well when the government hides
[2:34:18.920 --> 2:34:25.240]  evidence that helps the defendant that sometimes should induce the trial judge to throw the case
[2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:30.600]  out because you can't have a prosecution by government cheating most child trial judges
[2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:36.360]  will not throw the case out give the evidence over to defense counsel and give them some time
[2:34:36.360 --> 2:34:41.000]  to deal with it uh you're probably going to find a little bit more of that uh in the written house
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:47.880]  case i can't predict how it's going to end up but judges know when government starts hiding
[2:34:47.880 --> 2:34:53.800]  exculpatory evidence evidence that helps the defendant or hurts the government's case or
[2:34:53.800 --> 2:35:01.240]  does both then the judges begin to wonder how solid and stable the case is with respect to the fbi
[2:35:01.880 --> 2:35:08.120]  and you're right on the mark you and i have discussed this many times the fbi creates crime
[2:35:08.120 --> 2:35:16.520]  it looks like a crime nobody's ever really in danger they talk some lone wolf into believing
[2:35:16.520 --> 2:35:23.240]  that he's going to blow up a subway for example uh in new york city the fbi provides the money the fbi
[2:35:23.240 --> 2:35:28.760]  provides the incentive the fbi talks them into it the fbi brings them to a meeting of supposedly
[2:35:28.760 --> 2:35:33.160]  the people that are going to bring let give them the bomb making materials they give them something
[2:35:33.160 --> 2:35:38.120]  that's talcum powder he goes to plant it in the subway and then they arrest him and then they claim
[2:35:38.120 --> 2:35:45.320]  that they have kept us safe how the hell does the fbi creating a false non-crime something
[2:35:45.320 --> 2:35:51.240]  that they can just boast about keep us safe they did the same thing with the governor of michigan
[2:35:51.240 --> 2:36:00.600]  where there were actual not only um uh undercover people working in behalf of the fbi but fbi agents
[2:36:00.600 --> 2:36:07.880]  themselves acting as provocateurs in the plot against the governor of michigan i'm not a fan of
[2:36:07.880 --> 2:36:14.920]  the governor of michigan but the plot against her was totally concocted by the government paid for
[2:36:14.920 --> 2:36:21.000]  by the government promoted by the government when some of the people are now defendants and
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:26.600]  still in jail got cold feet the government agents threatened them that was a non-crime
[2:36:26.600 --> 2:36:32.200]  and there was no she was never anywhere near having a hair on her head being hot and i would
[2:36:32.200 --> 2:36:36.920]  add it was done when she was in major trouble politically getting caught going on on vacations
[2:36:36.920 --> 2:36:41.000]  and trying to you know rent boats but saying oh nobody else is allowed to leave their house
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:46.040]  or or go to a lake but i'm allowed to i'm the governor and so give my husband the boat i mean
[2:36:46.040 --> 2:36:50.120]  this was done at the time to make her look like a victim and make people that were against lockdowns
[2:36:50.120 --> 2:36:55.240]  look like terrorists which is you know judge biden put in the official u.s government policy of
[2:36:55.240 --> 2:37:00.760]  anti-terrorism that it's not china not russia not radical islam it's the main issue now but people
[2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:05.400]  that question the election people that question lockdowns i mean this is crazy you know it's
[2:37:05.400 --> 2:37:10.280]  funny you should say boats with respect to the governor of michigan and i know you didn't say
[2:37:10.280 --> 2:37:16.520]  this by accident she had the most draconian lockdown in the country even worse than here
[2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:24.680]  here in new jersey you couldn't go to a home depot or loaves and buy a garden hose during
[2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:30.040]  her lockdown but you could rent a boat isn't that interesting her husband's in the business
[2:37:30.040 --> 2:37:37.480]  of renting boats that's right so not only not only was her edict draconian unconstitutional
[2:37:37.480 --> 2:37:43.480]  unlawful and unenforceable she had carved out an exception for her husband to enrich their
[2:37:43.480 --> 2:37:48.840]  family house back to the fbi if we could well that i want to go back to the fbi but that you
[2:37:48.840 --> 2:37:53.000]  just reminded me remember he owns a bunch of wineries that also have those fine dinners
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:58.440]  hosted at him and it turned out the governor newson left his restaurants open where everybody else's
[2:37:58.440 --> 2:38:03.160]  else were closed i mean this is ridiculous it's like lightfoot saying i'm allowed to get a haircut
[2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:09.480]  you're just not allowed to right right i mean it's it's simply outrageous that the government
[2:38:09.480 --> 2:38:16.200]  would issue an edict not a law issue an edict punish people who don't comply with the edict
[2:38:16.200 --> 2:38:22.040]  but carve out an exception for themselves or for their friends it's a form of crony capitalism
[2:38:22.040 --> 2:38:26.600]  and it's a form of soft corruption i don't know if this put money in the governor of michigan's
[2:38:26.600 --> 2:38:33.160]  pocket i don't know if it put money in in uh gavin newson's pocket but i know they didn't apply to
[2:38:33.160 --> 2:38:39.320]  themselves the same draconian edict that they applied to everybody else absolutely right back
[2:38:39.320 --> 2:38:45.720]  to the fbi i mean it just it's i'm sad to see the fbi so discredited and acting like this i mean
[2:38:45.720 --> 2:38:52.040]  they're just destroying themselves i uh when i was on the bench i tried a number of cases that
[2:38:52.040 --> 2:38:59.400]  involved fbi agents and the fbi agents with whom i came in contact were so decent so honorable so
[2:38:59.400 --> 2:39:07.560]  strong so respectful of the constitution i would put my life and my fortune in their hands today
[2:39:07.560 --> 2:39:14.760]  of course the fbi is filled with political types who will use the powers of the office
[2:39:14.760 --> 2:39:23.080]  to embarrass people that they don't like i don't know how january 6 started but i know this the fbi
[2:39:23.080 --> 2:39:32.040]  has undercover people in the crowd who were texting to the fbi as the crowd was maneuvering and what
[2:39:32.040 --> 2:39:39.400]  the undercover people were telling the fbi was radically different from what federal prosecutors
[2:39:39.400 --> 2:39:45.960]  have been telling judges now if the federal prosecutors have an fbi undercover agent who's
[2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:51.080]  on the scene who's with the crowd who's listening to them who's a member of the proud boys who's
[2:39:51.080 --> 2:39:55.720]  interacting with them and he's saying there's no violence there's no plan for violence there's no
[2:39:55.720 --> 2:40:03.000]  plan to destroy anything and the fbi doesn't tell that to the federal prosecutors or the fbi
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:08.120]  tells federal prosecutors and they don't tell the defendants we have another kyle rittenhouse
[2:40:08.120 --> 2:40:15.640]  situation there's exculpatory evidence a federal agent on the ground in the scene whose narrative
[2:40:15.640 --> 2:40:20.680]  of what he's seeing and hearing is radically different from what prosecutors telling the
[2:40:20.680 --> 2:40:27.720]  federal judge another basis to throw the prosecution out but beyond that beyond whether
[2:40:27.720 --> 2:40:32.920]  prosecutors are honest enough to tell defense counsel about exculpatory evidence what is the
[2:40:32.920 --> 2:40:38.200]  fbi doing this for were they there to protect people they didn't protect anybody were they
[2:40:38.200 --> 2:40:44.040]  various provocateurs well if they were they were violating the rules to uphold uh the statue you
[2:40:44.040 --> 2:40:47.320]  know that's i thought that this morning and forgot to make that put on there earlier that's why
[2:40:47.320 --> 2:40:52.360]  you're the judge and i'm not yeah why the hell are they there with infrared watching everybody and
[2:40:52.360 --> 2:40:59.160]  cameras and then not stopping convicted pedophiles running around shooting guns at people well if
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:05.720]  they're there to protect innocent lives and government property they didn't lift a finger
[2:41:05.720 --> 2:41:11.880]  to protect anything and they know what was happening as it was happening they also knew
[2:41:11.880 --> 2:41:17.000]  from their very trusted undercover agent whose name has not been revealed and i don't know who it was
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:23.160]  someone trusted by the proud boys and someone trusted by them that there was no plan for violence
[2:41:24.120 --> 2:41:27.960]  and they didn't tell that to federal prosecutors how do we know they didn't tell the federal
[2:41:27.960 --> 2:41:35.000]  prosecutors because the the undercover or the investigative reporters who discovered this undercover
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:41.240]  agent his name has not yet been given to defense counsel at some point they're gonna have to reveal
[2:41:41.240 --> 2:41:46.600]  who he is and a lot of fbi agents going to be our agents are going to be embarrassed when his name
[2:41:46.600 --> 2:41:52.040]  comes out and defense counsel interrogates him in public courtroom about what he told the fbi
[2:41:52.040 --> 2:41:57.480]  and how they didn't lift a finger to save life or property well that's another question i've got
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:42:01.640]  when we come back you've got hundreds of people still held many of which were not even violent
[2:42:01.640 --> 2:42:06.840]  in guantanamo bay like the areas in solidary confinement and they admit that when they come
[2:42:06.840 --> 2:42:12.760]  out and say i hate trump okay we're evil yeah we plan to attack it and and lie then they're being
[2:42:12.760 --> 2:42:18.520]  let go i mean this is like when our uh air force people would get shot down over vietnam and be
[2:42:18.520 --> 2:42:23.160]  tortured for a couple years and come out and you know lie about america it's just disgraceful to

[2:48:10.440 --> 2:48:16.360]  covered it up simply insane i'll get to that coming up the start of the next hour going back to judge
[2:48:16.360 --> 2:48:21.800]  andrew napolitano you were getting into the fbi and then you were segwaying into the cia and torture
[2:48:21.800 --> 2:48:26.360]  and a big piece you've got coming out this evening at lou rockwell dot com tell us about this court
[2:48:26.360 --> 2:48:31.960]  case so it's actually uh three events happened in a two-week period and you didn't see any of
[2:48:31.960 --> 2:48:40.280]  this on the front pages uh four polish polish intelligence agents tortured a guy who's now
[2:48:40.280 --> 2:48:45.160]  at guantanamo bay in poland and the polish government is prosecuting them and the polish
[2:48:45.160 --> 2:48:49.320]  government subpoenaed the records of the torture the case went all the way to the supreme court
[2:48:49.320 --> 2:48:54.520]  and the federal prosecutor said to the supreme court we can't reveal we we agree we acknowledge
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:49:00.200]  the torture occurred wasn't done by us cia was watching but didn't physically do it we can't
[2:49:00.200 --> 2:49:04.600]  give you the records of it because we have a right to see per se while we're at war
[2:49:04.600 --> 2:49:09.160]  we're upon just as kavanaugh said wait a minute what war are we fighting alex this was two weeks
[2:49:09.160 --> 2:49:14.760]  ago federal prosecutor said we're fighting against the taliban in afghanistan we're upon the courtroom
[2:49:14.760 --> 2:49:21.080]  broke out and left her you see the only person on the planet that knows we are no longer fighting
[2:49:21.080 --> 2:49:25.880]  the taliban in afghanistan our departure was front page news for weeks it was a disaster
[2:49:25.880 --> 2:49:32.840]  of monumental proportions but the government will lie to the supreme court in order to hide
[2:49:33.400 --> 2:49:42.200]  its dirty secrets at the same time that was happening a detainee in guantanamo was testifying
[2:49:42.200 --> 2:49:48.360]  at his sentencing hearing and he testified for two and a half hours about the horrific torture
[2:49:48.360 --> 2:49:55.880]  visited upon him in guantanamo in in a foreign country by american cia agents which included
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:50:03.800]  rape yes rape he then looked at the jury and said the more i cooperated the more they tortured me
[2:50:03.800 --> 2:50:10.760]  when he finished describing the torture his jury is eight senior officers of the united
[2:50:10.760 --> 2:50:17.880]  states military when he finished describing the jury the torture the government refuses to challenge
[2:50:17.880 --> 2:50:24.280]  it meaning for the first time in american history the american government acknowledges
[2:50:24.280 --> 2:50:32.680]  that the bush cheney regime engaged in provided the means for authorized and ordered torture of
[2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:40.040]  people seven of the eight jurors who are senior members of the military wrote a letter to the
[2:50:40.040 --> 2:50:47.560]  judge saying what happened in this case was an attack on the fiber of everything america stands
[2:50:47.560 --> 2:50:52.280]  for this is the first no one nobody even heard about this in the news i saw it forgot to even
[2:50:52.280 --> 2:50:57.800]  cover it because it's so past that the government tortures and at the same time the u.s. government
[2:50:57.800 --> 2:51:02.760]  didn't even deny it which why is that a problem well now they're doing it to january six detainees
[2:51:03.320 --> 2:51:06.600]  in the united states of america they're setting the president to torture us
[2:51:06.600 --> 2:51:14.600]  the the while that was happening a federal judge in washington was ruling on a habeas corpus
[2:51:14.600 --> 2:51:20.840]  petition of a guy who's been at guantanamo bay for 14 years habeas corpus is a fancy phrase for
[2:51:20.840 --> 2:51:26.520]  show me the evidence against me the judge looks at the prosecutors and says there's no evidence
[2:51:26.520 --> 2:51:34.520]  against him i'm going to release him today so why did it take 14 years for this judge to be able
[2:51:34.520 --> 2:51:40.760]  to evaluate this evidence because justice departments under four presidents two republicans
[2:51:40.760 --> 2:51:47.480]  and two democrats kept persuading the courts not this judge but other judges to delay the hearing
[2:51:47.480 --> 2:51:52.440]  until they could find evidence against him well that's not the way it works if you don't have
[2:51:52.440 --> 2:51:57.000]  evidence against him at the time of this arrest you don't have a basis for arrest again you can't
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:03.160]  hold it for 14 years and then hope and pray and delay and delay until you can find evidence and
[2:52:03.160 --> 2:52:08.280]  judge you under a policy i mean let's talk about this but what's so horrifying is that now as you
[2:52:08.280 --> 2:52:12.760]  know the new official policy of biden is that conservatives christians people protesting
[2:52:12.760 --> 2:52:16.760]  elections people protesting lockdowns that they are terrorists and that similar things should
[2:52:16.760 --> 2:52:22.200]  be done and you know and even mainstream news puts up graphics saying that this is terrorism to
[2:52:22.200 --> 2:52:29.720]  question elections or things like that they're really trying to do this so how do we counter
[2:52:29.720 --> 2:52:36.200]  this what do we do with this level of tyranny this is an extremely dangerous time in american history
[2:52:36.760 --> 2:52:44.520]  and it began under bush against cheney george bush was told botanical bay is in cuba the constitution
[2:52:44.520 --> 2:52:50.680]  doesn't apply in cuba the federal laws don't apply in cuba and best of all mr president
[2:52:50.680 --> 2:52:55.080]  those pesky federal judges can't second guess what you're doing cuba well the supreme court
[2:52:55.080 --> 2:53:00.200]  dispatched all three of those arguments in one opinion a first year law student would know
[2:53:00.200 --> 2:53:06.280]  not to make those arguments wherever the government goes the constitution goes with it but they did
[2:53:06.280 --> 2:53:12.360]  begin to inculcate this argument that these people are terrorists and therefore they have
[2:53:12.360 --> 2:53:19.000]  less rights than the rest of us that's the danger you're talking about because the attorney general
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:27.240]  of the united states a former life tenured federal appellate judge has begun to refer to the people
[2:53:27.240 --> 2:53:33.240]  on january 6 as terrorists i don't care what he calls him but if he calls but if he thinks that
[2:53:33.240 --> 2:53:41.000]  calling them terrorists terrorists somehow diminishes their rights he has profoundly rejected
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:45.720]  the declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights all of which he has sworn
[2:53:45.720 --> 2:53:51.480]  to uphold well that leads me to this i mean you were against from our humanity alex they don't
[2:53:51.480 --> 2:53:56.920]  come from the government it doesn't matter where your mother was born which which determines your
[2:53:56.920 --> 2:54:02.120]  rights the fact that you are a human being gives you these basic natural rights that the government
[2:54:02.120 --> 2:54:07.160]  is obliged to protect in defense wow you're you're really on fire there judge you're absolutely
[2:54:07.160 --> 2:54:11.720]  right obviously and that leaves me this final point what do we do about the liberals they
[2:54:11.720 --> 2:54:16.280]  used to not like nsa spine they used to not like torture and war now they were mad at trump who's
[2:54:16.280 --> 2:54:20.200]  trying to pull us out of all these wars and now they're calling for all of us to be arrested as
[2:54:20.200 --> 2:54:25.320]  terrorists a big tech censoring us i mean the democratic party celebrates george herbert walker
[2:54:25.320 --> 2:54:31.080]  bush george w bush they celebrate colon pal lying about anthrax i mean what in the world
[2:54:31.080 --> 2:54:35.320]  happened to the average liberal out there because i you know i didn't agree with them on on the second
[2:54:35.320 --> 2:54:40.200]  amendment or other things but at least they said they didn't want torture now they love it there's
[2:54:40.200 --> 2:54:46.200]  no moderate democrats anymore shouldn't say there's no there's very few there is joe manchin and and
[2:54:46.200 --> 2:54:51.800]  folks like that but the democratic party and then listen i i taught law school with joe biden this
[2:54:51.800 --> 2:54:59.480]  is 35 years ago when he was a member of congress in delaware law school he was and in my view is a
[2:54:59.480 --> 2:55:05.720]  moderate middle of the road democrat but today he has been pulled so far to the left because the
[2:55:05.720 --> 2:55:11.560]  democratic party has moved so far to the left terry mccullough was once a moderate democrat he got
[2:55:11.560 --> 2:55:16.280]  trounced in his effort to return to the governor's mansion in virginia because he panned it to the
[2:55:16.280 --> 2:55:24.600]  left and the people in virginia saw through that the farther left the democrat democratic party goes
[2:55:24.600 --> 2:55:32.440]  the less appeal it has and i don't know what we can do because right now they're running the show
[2:55:32.440 --> 2:55:38.920]  they control the house of representatives and but for the personal courage of joe manchin who by
[2:55:38.920 --> 2:55:42.760]  the way is italian i don't know what the real name is but he told me he would take me to italian
[2:55:42.760 --> 2:55:48.120]  restaurants in west virginia i sort of left but i mean i mean manchin is a manchin is an italian
[2:55:48.120 --> 2:55:55.800]  name i i looked it up it's hard to imagine where we be without somebody of his personal courage
[2:55:56.520 --> 2:56:00.920]  so we have dark times ahead of us alex maybe there's light at the end of the tunnel but there's

[3:00:12.280 --> 3:00:24.840]  sounds
[3:00:24.840 --> 3:00:36.760]  oh
[3:00:36.760 --> 3:00:44.760]  johnny go
[3:00:44.760 --> 3:00:46.760]  Johnny be good
[3:00:47.240 --> 3:00:49.240]  Well he carries
[3:00:54.560 --> 3:01:01.000]  You know I'd rather ride around on the back 40 with a shotgun hunting up some dub for dinner
[3:01:03.440 --> 3:01:06.520]  Maybe grab my dear rival I see a wild hog and popping it
[3:01:08.120 --> 3:01:10.880]  And sit here and talk about the new order come after our children
[3:01:10.880 --> 3:01:12.880]  And
[3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:18.120]  I would be rather driving around in the countryside with the fishing poles and back of the truck about do some fishing
[3:01:18.360 --> 3:01:21.120]  Would a little bit of Chuck Berry on the radio
[3:01:22.480 --> 3:01:29.280]  But we don't have time to do that do we because they're coming for us and they're punishing us and their censor in us
[3:01:29.280 --> 3:01:32.500]  And they're attacking us and they're trying to set us up for crimes
[3:01:34.640 --> 3:01:36.640]  Because
[3:01:36.640 --> 3:01:42.900]  We're fighting them we're standing up to him Kate. Now. He's coming up here in about six seven minutes
[3:01:44.280 --> 3:01:46.280]  I've got a little bit of this
[3:01:46.720 --> 3:01:52.800]  Testimony that Ernest Ramirez gave before the Senate, you know, we had him on the show months ago. His son died. It was in great health
[3:01:53.680 --> 3:01:56.800]  four days after he took the second Pfizer shot and
[3:01:58.200 --> 3:02:02.200]  I did an okay job in the first hour hitting this with Robert Barnes, but
[3:02:02.200 --> 3:02:06.600]  All the news we covered was huge today, but let me tell you something
[3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:15.520]  Them coming after the children with these deadly shots and California now moving to mandate and make children take it under color of law
[3:02:15.520 --> 3:02:19.440]  Which makes it even worse is just total acts of war against humanity and
[3:02:20.040 --> 3:02:22.040]  We have to resist this
[3:02:22.560 --> 3:02:25.440]  Now I don't want to get violent with these people. They're coming after our children
[3:02:25.440 --> 3:02:31.720]  They want that because they're losing but we're gonna it's gonna take some really serious shibble disobedience and
[3:02:32.480 --> 3:02:35.240]  I mean, I'm gonna have to start doing it myself and
[3:02:36.040 --> 3:02:40.220]  You're gonna have to do it. We're gonna figure out what that is when you just got to come to a consensus to start doing it
[3:02:40.960 --> 3:02:42.320]  but
[3:02:42.320 --> 3:02:48.640]  If you live near San Francisco in places like that where they close these in and out burgers because they would maybe we'll have vaccine passes
[3:02:48.640 --> 3:02:54.960]  And I said two weeks ago. I said watch San Francisco is gonna mandate five and up the minute the FDA comes out and says do it?
[3:02:55.520 --> 3:02:57.720]  They don't even finish the study on children till
[3:02:59.120 --> 3:03:00.960]  2026
[3:03:00.960 --> 3:03:06.960]  So they call it approved and studied they covered up what really happened in the studies. That's what broke last night
[3:03:07.600 --> 3:03:10.840]  He told you three weeks ago that suit was coming Robert Barnes
[3:03:12.200 --> 3:03:13.600]  So
[3:03:13.600 --> 3:03:20.760]  What an incredible time to be alive. I'm gonna recap this and hit the earnest from there as news and then Kate dally great syndicated talk show
[3:03:20.760 --> 3:03:24.000]  hosts gonna take over she hosts a large portion of the
[3:03:24.800 --> 3:03:30.520]  Fourth hour here every Wednesday. We're really honored to have her always really amazing to sit back when I had my lunch
[3:03:30.520 --> 3:03:34.160]  Usually she takes over on Wednesdays and watch the great guest. She gets on as well
[3:03:34.160 --> 3:03:37.360]  So I can't wait to hear what she has say and last week she had a lot of good news as well
[3:03:37.360 --> 3:03:41.360]  And the good news is this is gonna wake a lot of people up and the good news is that
[3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:45.760]  You know, this isn't going as well as the new Lord or wanted but the bad news is they don't give a damn and they're going
[3:03:45.760 --> 3:03:46.920]  to add with it
[3:03:46.920 --> 3:03:51.120]  Because they love death. They're not just doing this to make 65 billion at Pfizer
[3:03:51.840 --> 3:03:58.720]  They're doing it for total power and control because if they can inject people with really poisonous stuff and get away with it and get the
[3:03:58.720 --> 3:04:04.480]  Whole system and the lawyers and the doctors and nurses assigned on well, they've got full control those people are compromised
[3:04:04.640 --> 3:04:06.640]  Those people will go along with anything
[3:04:06.640 --> 3:04:13.200]  They'll go along with keeping babies alive and selling their body parts and all the rest of stuff that's coming out and yes
[3:04:13.440 --> 3:04:18.400]  It's good news in Virginia. Do we know yet of that horrid governor lost in New Jersey?
[3:04:19.400 --> 3:04:25.240]  That debt demon, of course, they're all losing but but is this a head fake like
[3:04:25.840 --> 3:04:30.560]  Folks over there we punter asking so that Republicans feel complacent coming up in the midterms
[3:04:30.560 --> 3:04:33.440]  And then they rolled out all the fraudulent ballots again
[3:04:33.440 --> 3:04:38.280]  They'll see but no doubt the New Jersey governor lost hell. They said he was 15 points ahead and all the polls
[3:04:38.560 --> 3:04:42.480]  And now they've been neck and neck so we'll watch that race as it unfolds as well
[3:04:42.480 --> 3:04:46.320]  So yeah, am I celebrating this from Republicans got elected? Yeah, I mean
[3:04:46.880 --> 3:04:52.440]  Well, I mean sure but they need to not be loyal opposition to the system and this guy's poll numbers exploded
[3:04:52.840 --> 3:04:55.140]  In Virginia when he said he was against the shots
[3:04:55.640 --> 3:04:57.640]  brain force plus
[3:04:57.640 --> 3:05:03.080]  If you only knew the power of the dark side
[3:05:04.080 --> 3:05:09.960]  Join Bill Gates and together we will defeat humanity
[3:05:10.880 --> 3:05:15.600]  Then our God see will reward us with eternal life
[3:05:16.880 --> 3:05:20.120]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists
[3:05:21.440 --> 3:05:23.800]  They must first play God. They must first
[3:05:23.800 --> 3:05:29.080]  Prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system
[3:05:29.080 --> 3:05:34.160]  And in a way, they're right if we let them lie to us and dump us down and poison us
[3:05:34.960 --> 3:05:41.400]  Destroy our children's futures. The evidence is overwhelming and out in the open. We really deserve what's happened to us
[3:05:42.080 --> 3:05:44.080]  So I asked you now
[3:05:44.080 --> 3:05:48.200]  Are you going to step up and expose the new order even more?
[3:05:48.200 --> 3:05:51.800]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts
[3:05:51.800 --> 3:05:55.760]  The front lines the fight is info wars.com
[3:05:55.760 --> 3:06:17.920]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones
[3:06:17.920 --> 3:06:29.160]  California dreams they're coming for the five-year-old say it's mandatory. They're an injector child
[3:06:31.280 --> 3:06:37.240]  But at the same time it's not even the long top of it and Biden's order is just hot air, but people bow down to it
[3:06:39.760 --> 3:06:43.800]  Incredible Kate Dally is about to take over, but I wanted to recap it and then break some new news here
[3:06:43.800 --> 3:06:51.880]  FDA knew about numerous adverse events for children related to Pfizer vaccine approved anyway
[3:06:51.880 --> 3:06:57.640]  Bombshell had the lawyer involved all of it coming out just such massive news in the first hour
[3:06:58.200 --> 3:07:03.080]  Falsified data Pfizer vaccine trial had major flaws but some lower tells peer-reviewed journal
[3:07:04.080 --> 3:07:07.280]  And now we've got this my government lied to me
[3:07:07.280 --> 3:07:15.840]  That it tells teen son's death from my co-carditis following vaccine the articles on info wars.com save other young people and save other children
[3:07:15.840 --> 3:07:19.160]  Get this article and share it like your life depends on it because God's watching
[3:07:19.600 --> 3:07:25.840]  Texas father gave heartbreaking testimony before I sent it panel detailing a 16-year-old son's death from heart complications following his first
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  Pfizer jab here's Ernest Ramirez
[3:07:29.040 --> 3:07:32.120]  Oh the father of a 60 year old son
[3:07:32.120 --> 3:07:40.080]  Single parent I raised my boy said he was a baby. He meant the world to be I
[3:07:44.880 --> 3:07:47.760]  Got the vaccine to protect my son and
[3:07:51.800 --> 3:07:53.800]  After in March April
[3:07:55.480 --> 3:07:58.480]  There are now teams out it was safe for teenagers
[3:07:58.480 --> 3:08:06.480]  Me and my son have never been apart. We're always together. He was my best friend
[3:08:09.280 --> 3:08:14.960]  Always told me it was being you guess the world he joined ROTC in high school
[3:08:16.040 --> 3:08:20.420]  He was always full of smiles anybody that knew my son would see
[3:08:20.420 --> 3:08:29.660]  He was happy. I wasn't rich, but I gave him everything he wanted. We didn't lack for anything
[3:08:32.420 --> 3:08:39.660]  We used to go fishing camping do everything we got to find the vaccine because I thought it was to protect him
[3:08:39.660 --> 3:08:41.660]  I thought it was
[3:08:42.060 --> 3:08:44.060]  The right thing to do
[3:08:44.060 --> 3:08:50.180]  It was like playing Russian roulette my government lied to me. They said it was safe
[3:08:53.220 --> 3:08:55.220]  They sweetest his birthday
[3:08:57.580 --> 3:08:59.940]  You know what I'm gonna celebrate his birthday at
[3:09:03.180 --> 3:09:10.100]  While everybody once we leave here they're gonna forget about what we're doing or what they talk about what we said here
[3:09:10.100 --> 3:09:14.940]  They're gonna be enjoying time with their family and kids
[3:09:16.460 --> 3:09:19.580]  They just gave them a spin at the cemetery
[3:09:20.540 --> 3:09:22.740]  Christmas at that cemetery
[3:09:26.540 --> 3:09:28.820]  They need to quit pushing the son of children I
[3:09:30.660 --> 3:09:33.460]  Lost mine. Yeah, I need to protect yours
[3:09:34.020 --> 3:09:35.620]  they
[3:09:35.620 --> 3:09:38.620]  They're trying to target the five to 12 year olds
[3:09:38.620 --> 3:09:46.460]  We're gonna have more death in our hands than they planned and they say it's worth the risk
[3:09:47.260 --> 3:09:49.060]  It wasn't worth the risk
[3:09:49.060 --> 3:09:52.140]  I was a father of a 60 year old son
[3:09:54.780 --> 3:10:01.540]  Now you can see the full testimony and in four wars calm the enemy is fighting to suppress this father and countless others
[3:10:01.540 --> 3:10:02.900]  But they will not
[3:10:02.900 --> 3:10:10.860]  Suppressed them FDA knew about numerous adverse events and children and covered it up in the Pfizer trials now a major internal whistleblower
[3:10:12.460 --> 3:10:16.700]  San Francisco becomes first city in the world a mandate covered injection for children five to 11
[3:10:16.700 --> 3:10:20.740]  It's all a fraud new major study out of the University of
[3:10:21.500 --> 3:10:26.260]  Stockholm government funded study finds massive attacks on DNA by the
[3:10:26.260 --> 3:10:33.500]  COVID-19 mRNA spike protein vaccine science hard vaccine spike protein enters cell nuclei
[3:10:34.060 --> 3:10:37.100]  Suppresses DNA repair will unleash explosion of cancer
[3:10:37.700 --> 3:10:40.340]  immunodeficiency autoimmune disorders and
[3:10:41.060 --> 3:10:45.340]  Accelerated aging that's all there you should read it's linked at info wars calm
[3:10:45.340 --> 3:10:48.380]  And it just goes on from there or even worse
[3:10:48.380 --> 3:10:55.340]  Oh, but don't worry the FDA approved first oral blood thinning medication for children ahead of vaccine rollout ages five to eleven
[3:10:55.340 --> 3:11:02.020]  And now you know the NIH is on website. It says that of the children that develop mycocarditis even mild mycorditis
[3:11:03.020 --> 3:11:06.580]  Between 25 and 56 percent will die within three to ten years
[3:11:07.060 --> 3:11:10.540]  So if you think it's bad at the number of young people that have already died
[3:11:10.820 --> 3:11:12.820]  12 and up just get
[3:11:13.140 --> 3:11:20.180]  Ready ladies and gentlemen here it is from the NIH website. That is the facts. All right with that she's got
[3:11:20.180 --> 3:11:24.460]  Forty-nine minutes and we really appreciate her hosting Kate Alley take over
[3:11:25.380 --> 3:11:27.740]  Thank you Alex you're on fire today. What a show
[3:11:28.820 --> 3:11:32.860]  All right, let's do this voting results are in and
[3:11:33.620 --> 3:11:41.260]  Although I'm happy to see some of the results. How happy am I really? I don't know because if three-fourths of the country is
[3:11:41.780 --> 3:11:43.700]  Identifiably
[3:11:43.700 --> 3:11:44.660]  conservative
[3:11:44.660 --> 3:11:48.180]  Then how are the races always this close?
[3:11:48.180 --> 3:11:49.820]  How's that possible?
[3:11:49.820 --> 3:11:56.860]  Hmm. One must wonder is it a little dominionitis the precursor to COVID-19? I think so
[3:11:57.620 --> 3:12:03.620]  You know what we have some problems going on in America. Both parties are part of this. I know you know this
[3:12:03.980 --> 3:12:05.980]  I'm preaching to the choir right now
[3:12:06.220 --> 3:12:10.820]  But one is driving the train and the other wants to look like a reluctant writer
[3:12:10.820 --> 3:12:16.980]  They're not very reluctant when they get in and we all know this. I feel like they handed us a little bone
[3:12:16.980 --> 3:12:22.420]  You know threw us a little bone and said that'll keep you guys complacent. You'll think you've won something
[3:12:22.420 --> 3:12:24.420]  What have we won Bob?
[3:12:24.660 --> 3:12:31.780]  This is how bad it's getting when I don't trust my vote. I don't trust the hospitals. I don't trust scientists
[3:12:31.780 --> 3:12:33.780]  I don't trust anyone anymore
[3:12:34.460 --> 3:12:39.780]  It is it is a far cry from where we need to be. This is a far cry
[3:12:39.780 --> 3:12:44.060]  From where we need to be this is absolutely ridiculous and both parties are part of it
[3:12:44.060 --> 3:12:49.860]  So Facebook is now saying when you hear those f Joe Biden chance, you're not really hearing that. Did you know that?
[3:12:49.860 --> 3:12:56.420]  Yeah, your ears they're deceiving you just like your eyes are deceiving you for all of the vaccine injuries that we have same thing
[3:12:56.780 --> 3:13:00.260]  So a listener. Yeah, you're supposed to just not hear what you're hearing
[3:13:00.300 --> 3:13:05.500]  So a listener to my daily live show asked me if I could sum up the news in five minutes
[3:13:05.500 --> 3:13:09.700]  Well, I could try I could definitely try who doesn't love a good challenge
[3:13:09.700 --> 3:13:14.060]  Um, the national walkout for America is happening next week
[3:13:14.060 --> 3:13:19.660]  The biggest strike in American history is going on next week. Are you gonna be part of it? You're gonna get your American card
[3:13:19.660 --> 3:13:23.460]  I think we all need to get our American card. You know, we haven't had to sacrifice
[3:13:24.100 --> 3:13:27.180]  We've enjoyed the dream, but we've never had to work for it
[3:13:27.180 --> 3:13:33.020]  And I think right now we're learning that even even making it very easy. We're having to work for it
[3:13:33.020 --> 3:13:36.100]  We already thought a bloody revolution. We don't need to do that again
[3:13:36.100 --> 3:13:40.580]  What we really need to do is show them that we are not putting up with this and so far
[3:13:40.940 --> 3:13:47.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, the biggest strike in American history has been going on under our noses. The media won't report on it
[3:13:47.740 --> 3:13:53.500]  No, but we all know it's happening because you have friends and relatives and neighbors that are all
[3:13:54.140 --> 3:13:57.940]  Leaving their jobs because of the mandate. So next Monday through Thursday
[3:13:58.300 --> 3:14:02.340]  America is gonna do the biggest walkout that's ever happened in American history
[3:14:02.340 --> 3:14:06.260]  Are you gonna be part of history? Are you gonna tell your kids and grandkids?
[3:14:06.260 --> 3:14:11.100]  What part of history you fell on because you're either going to be the Nazi tattletale?
[3:14:11.980 --> 3:14:16.020]  Administer not administer services to people and be on that side of it
[3:14:16.020 --> 3:14:19.480]  Or you can be on the side of it that says we're taking our liberty back
[3:14:19.740 --> 3:14:23.180]  And we're not gonna hand it over this easily so far
[3:14:23.180 --> 3:14:27.260]  We've handed over it easily and I saw a meme the other day that said, you know
[3:14:27.260 --> 3:14:33.900]  You know, if we were back in Daniel's time, God would say, you know, you know, people would people actually would say, you know
[3:14:33.900 --> 3:14:35.900]  Well, let's just hope it goes away
[3:14:36.620 --> 3:14:40.380]  And pray for all of it to go away. It's not going away. It's getting worse
[3:14:40.380 --> 3:14:46.380]  And now the FDA is of course talking about what they're going to be doing to kids and they switched out the
[3:14:47.100 --> 3:14:53.520]  Ingredient tris. It's in the FDA documents and tris is actually a blood thinner to stop heart attacks
[3:14:53.540 --> 3:14:55.540]  Do you want this in your kid?
[3:14:55.540 --> 3:15:01.020]  For all of you organic people out there that watch every little, you know, bit of corn syrup
[3:15:01.020 --> 3:15:08.300]  But that they'll jam a child full of tris because it's what the government says to do. Do you trust your government?
[3:15:08.300 --> 3:15:12.100]  Oh, I surely hope not. That's the difference between liberals and
[3:15:12.740 --> 3:15:19.100]  Conservatives most of the time if I go back in history and I and I tell you this is based on history and this is what I fear
[3:15:19.100 --> 3:15:22.580]  I fear my government what they'll say is they fear climate change
[3:15:22.580 --> 3:15:26.540]  They fear all these other things that are never part of history. You can't prove any of them
[3:15:26.540 --> 3:15:32.820]  I can prove what I fear and I fear my government. I fear my government. Isn't that sad?
[3:15:32.820 --> 3:15:36.460]  Oh, we need to take our country back. I'll be right back
[3:15:36.460 --> 3:15:41.860]  I have so much to tell you and I'll be right back on on the Alex Jones show
[3:15:41.860 --> 3:15:44.180]  I'm your co-host or your guest host
[3:15:44.180 --> 3:15:52.940]  I should say Kate Dally from the Kate Dally show I go live every day and I will be right back
[3:15:53.860 --> 3:16:00.300]  What if you climb to the top of the food chain with alpha power by info wars life
[3:16:00.780 --> 3:16:04.420]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels
[3:16:04.980 --> 3:16:08.220]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline
[3:16:08.220 --> 3:16:15.940]  Starting around 30 at a rate of about one to two percent per year. This drop can show signs such as fatigue
[3:16:16.060 --> 3:16:19.500]  Low energy low sex drive and muscle loss

[3:17:54.820 --> 3:18:00.620]  It was almost 15 years ago that I've released my seminal film in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[3:18:00.940 --> 3:18:06.860]  And then that documentary I predicted the globalist would establish world government by releasing a virus
[3:18:07.860 --> 3:18:14.340]  Demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society and now they've done it
[3:18:14.340 --> 3:18:21.900]  How did I know they would do it because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked
[3:18:22.660 --> 3:18:27.020]  You see then I was tracking the Bilderberg group who's head at the time was cloud swab
[3:18:27.460 --> 3:18:32.500]  And our sources inside were confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this great recent
[3:18:32.740 --> 3:18:37.100]  Well, we're now living in it the purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world
[3:18:37.380 --> 3:18:42.500]  None attached to the tyrannical corporate world government the total censorship no due process
[3:18:42.500 --> 3:18:49.740]  Destruction of the family and then incrementally more and more deadly injections of poison mass-creating these vaccines
[3:18:50.020 --> 3:18:54.700]  To poisonous the populace. This is what info wars is fighting. We're fighting for the future
[3:18:55.420 --> 3:19:01.500]  I'm sitting here. It's in the early morning hours, and I'm looking at mainstream news
[3:19:03.180 --> 3:19:07.460]  Reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said
[3:19:07.460 --> 3:19:14.180]  that the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because he in studies
[3:19:14.180 --> 3:19:17.940]  They did on children it caused myocarditis. That's heart swelling and heart attacks
[3:19:18.780 --> 3:19:24.140]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the Associated Press. It's not getting any circulation
[3:19:24.140 --> 3:19:29.620]  It's not on the national news, and it's very hard to even find on places like Instagram or Twitter. It's just crazy and then
[3:19:30.380 --> 3:19:34.620]  Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying there's no damage from the vaccines
[3:19:34.620 --> 3:19:37.780]  It doesn't hurt anybody your conspiracy theorist if you say it
[3:19:37.980 --> 3:19:44.260]  It's just crazy and then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said these vaccines are gonna cause heart problems
[3:19:44.260 --> 3:19:46.940]  They gave the exact reasons why and now it happened
[3:19:47.300 --> 3:19:52.340]  That's why info wars is on there because if we weren't on air they get away with even more of this crap
[3:19:52.340 --> 3:19:54.500]  This is just insane. These people are killers
[3:19:54.500 --> 3:20:01.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:20:11.500 --> 3:20:15.820]  Back here with you Kate Daly from the Kate Daly show your guest host appreciate
[3:20:16.540 --> 3:20:20.740]  This show and wow was Alex on fire today. Can I just say oh?
[3:20:20.740 --> 3:20:27.900]  Oh, it was a great show so let me just let me just start here a listener asked me to sum up the news and
[3:20:27.980 --> 3:20:34.100]  That's pretty difficult to do given that I have 50 screens up a day and try to even narrow it down to several
[3:20:34.100 --> 3:20:38.380]  And I'm sure Alex probably has the same issue. It's so many screens full of news
[3:20:38.380 --> 3:20:45.060]  In fact last week with Halloween. I could honestly I couldn't come up with anything scary, so I just did the news
[3:20:45.060 --> 3:20:47.060]  I mean it was that pathetic
[3:20:47.060 --> 3:20:53.140]  So let's start here for just a moment. I kind of want to give you a rundown of things to be very aware of and that are
[3:20:53.140 --> 3:20:59.220]  Coming because I think this is really important for you to sort of think outside the box a little bit to get prepared not to scare
[3:20:59.220 --> 3:21:02.140]  You but just get prepared and that's how I look at this
[3:21:02.340 --> 3:21:05.660]  So we have a national walkout next week Monday through Thursday
[3:21:05.660 --> 3:21:08.100]  Please be a part of it and get your American card
[3:21:08.100 --> 3:21:12.380]  It's time that we finally realize who we are and I want to be on that side of history
[3:21:12.380 --> 3:21:20.500]  I want to tell my kids and grandkids what I did as part of of what we did in America to try to restore and push back
[3:21:20.500 --> 3:21:25.820]  And I know many of you are pushing back right now and dealing with deaths and adverse reactions
[3:21:26.420 --> 3:21:28.540]  It's just getting more horrific by the day
[3:21:28.540 --> 3:21:34.220]  But so many people are behind that walkout from Charlie Cook to Robert Kennedy Jr. to General Flynn you name it
[3:21:34.220 --> 3:21:38.420]  They're all behind it. They want people to walk out if three-fourths of the country does it
[3:21:38.980 --> 3:21:41.140]  We can really make history next week
[3:21:41.140 --> 3:21:46.540]  And let's do that with the supply chain. Let's let them know that we're not going to have it as the masses
[3:21:46.860 --> 3:21:48.940]  They added the ingredient tris
[3:21:49.980 --> 3:21:52.940]  Tramethamine to the shot for the kids
[3:21:53.580 --> 3:22:01.980]  The experimental shot. Can you imagine something so catastrophic? I can't I can't I can't imagine parents doing this to their children
[3:22:01.980 --> 3:22:08.940]  I mean who is who is stupid enough to put your kids even in a trial and they only had so many kids in a trial
[3:22:08.940 --> 3:22:10.940]  I mean it was this big
[3:22:11.500 --> 3:22:18.420]  Ridiculous and so I what 86% had adverse reactions and one of the adverse reactions is of course death
[3:22:18.420 --> 3:22:23.660]  But they won't mention that they just say oh, it's a headache. It's a little mild sniffle. Yeah, okay. We believe them
[3:22:24.540 --> 3:22:27.340]  Anyway, I wanted to say this about agriculture
[3:22:27.340 --> 3:22:32.660]  Animal agriculture is going away if we haven't noticed and I've been talking to farmers boots on the ground lately
[3:22:32.660 --> 3:22:39.460]  Friends of mine that farm and and the farmers are panicking right now when farmers panic then and they're not talking
[3:22:39.460 --> 3:22:45.820]  But they're panicking then you know, it's bad. This is why Gates is trying to get a hold of most of the USA
[3:22:45.820 --> 3:22:50.500]  This is why the Conservation Act of 2014 which both parties absolutely
[3:22:50.620 --> 3:22:52.380]  went in on and and
[3:22:52.380 --> 3:22:54.380]  Conducted and made sure that went through
[3:22:54.740 --> 3:23:00.020]  At the end of the contract that they give the farmers when they take over their land and keep it in their family name
[3:23:00.020 --> 3:23:06.420]  It says we will give this land to the USA and its successor. Who do you think that successor is?
[3:23:06.460 --> 3:23:09.700]  I'm gonna go with UN my first option would have been China
[3:23:09.700 --> 3:23:14.380]  But you know what we're going into globalization like crazy with a Biden and so
[3:23:15.060 --> 3:23:16.340]  With King fraud a lot
[3:23:16.340 --> 3:23:21.380]  So I'm guessing that that's we're we're losing so much of America right now
[3:23:21.420 --> 3:23:28.620]  They'll start killing off the animals and telling you that this is what is best for America that we absolutely do away with
[3:23:28.620 --> 3:23:33.180]  The farming and the cow farting and everything else that's ruining us, right?
[3:23:33.180 --> 3:23:40.660]  I want to know who's stupid enough to believe after six decades of this six decades of being told that we're gonna die at
[3:23:40.660 --> 3:23:46.540]  The end of every single decade. How many decades will it take before we understand they're lying 10 20?
[3:23:46.540 --> 3:23:50.900]  I don't know how many decades I would have thought after like two we would have gotten it
[3:23:50.900 --> 3:23:56.140]  But I think it's going to take the seventh decade of telling us we're gonna die at the end of every single decade
[3:23:56.140 --> 3:24:02.620]  It's amazing that they keep selling this lie. They're gonna start destroying what is left of small farms and right now
[3:24:02.940 --> 3:24:08.020]  The farmers are panicking about wheat. This is this is a panic ladies and gentlemen
[3:24:08.020 --> 3:24:11.900]  They're also afraid of what's being sold to them in those nanoparticles
[3:24:12.460 --> 3:24:20.820]  The nanoparticles that are going into our food supply. So they sold this originally as something that would help maintain its freshness
[3:24:20.820 --> 3:24:27.740]  Mmm, yummy, right can't wait to get a hold and chomp on some veggies with good old nanoparticles on top
[3:24:27.860 --> 3:24:35.020]  But you know it is inside the food as they absolutely talked about last year in the FDA report that oh, yeah
[3:24:35.020 --> 3:24:39.100]  And we don't know of its safety. We're a little worried about it in the safety
[3:24:39.580 --> 3:24:44.180]  Section of the FDA document. It says we're a little worried about what it's what's gonna happen
[3:24:44.180 --> 3:24:50.100]  But let me tell you about those nanoparticles because of course Alex did breaking news on Saturday about this and it was important
[3:24:50.100 --> 3:24:56.000]  Everybody needed to know about nanoparticles in our food supply or what's been dropped on our heads for many years
[3:24:56.100 --> 3:25:00.540]  It's in us. It's all in our system. But why do you think they're so desperate to give it to the shot?
[3:25:01.180 --> 3:25:09.260]  What about the shot makes those nanoparticles work and that's the operating system in that software in that shot
[3:25:09.260 --> 3:25:11.660]  Is the operating system that makes it all work?
[3:25:11.660 --> 3:25:16.900]  It's like a battery for a car if you don't have that then you're lacking the key
[3:25:16.900 --> 3:25:24.460]  Ingredient to making all those nanoparticles light up in your body and give them the data that they need in the future
[3:25:24.460 --> 3:25:30.080]  We will not have hospitals and I hope people realize that in the future. I mean no one will trust them
[3:25:30.580 --> 3:25:36.980]  But you'll have a physician working off the data that they get that comes from inside your body in a telecall
[3:25:37.060 --> 3:25:38.580]  They will be able to do that
[3:25:38.580 --> 3:25:44.860]  They started envisioning this a decade ago and started writing about it in medical journals that this was the way it was gonna go. I
[3:25:44.860 --> 3:25:52.100]  Also wanted to mention water filters water filters are not gonna cover it in the 2010 Rockefeller report
[3:25:52.100 --> 3:25:54.100]  They say that they sectioned off waters
[3:25:55.060 --> 3:26:00.420]  Rivers and lakes by by fences and they did this because they would say well
[3:26:00.420 --> 3:26:03.940]  There was a bioterror attack and the water is not safe and it was a total lie
[3:26:03.940 --> 3:26:11.820]  And so I want you to know atmospheric water machines might be something that you need to go get and they do produce gallons of water a
[3:26:11.820 --> 3:26:17.500]  Day out of the atmosphere. This might be something that you want to get a hold of I don't trust that we'll need water filters
[3:26:17.500 --> 3:26:19.500]  If we can't find a water source
[3:26:19.620 --> 3:26:26.460]  Something is very wrong and and this is going on right now. So just make sure that you can get one right now while you still can
[3:26:27.180 --> 3:26:28.820]  also
[3:26:28.820 --> 3:26:36.700]  They have new laws on the books called the online safety bill over in the UK for making any kinds of
[3:26:36.700 --> 3:26:42.620]  Statements on on Facebook. You could actually you can actually go away for false information
[3:26:43.700 --> 3:26:46.980]  They're sort of false information the botten sold media
[3:26:47.580 --> 3:26:49.980]  The botten sold media and botten sold
[3:26:50.380 --> 3:26:58.580]  Government and so what happens is is you get to go to jail for possibly two years? Yeah, and also what does meta mean?
[3:26:59.300 --> 3:27:04.260]  Metaverse where they're changing the name of Facebook what this is going to be talking about is
[3:27:04.260 --> 3:27:13.100]  really coordinating and a new online reality a new online reality where anti-vaxxers are spreading false information and
[3:27:13.780 --> 3:27:20.540]  Yeah, you can't say a thing and then you also get a live in a reality where there's you can visit a baseball game and act like
[3:27:20.540 --> 3:27:24.220]  You're there, but you're not how fun, right? I love life and then also
[3:27:24.900 --> 3:27:27.180]  You can virtually go and spend money
[3:27:27.180 --> 3:27:33.620]  You can virtually have a world where mentally now you are pretty much unstable because you don't know the difference between
[3:27:33.620 --> 3:27:37.460]  Are you on Facebook or are you not do you have an avatar? Do you not?
[3:27:38.020 --> 3:27:45.020]  This is such a huge huge issue now. You know why both parties have been instrumental and basically
[3:27:45.620 --> 3:27:52.420]  You know coddling each other on each side of the aisle basically sitting on each other's laps while they pass mental health bills
[3:27:52.900 --> 3:27:56.140]  Up the wazoo and I wondered why this was coming
[3:27:56.140 --> 3:28:02.060]  I wondered why they were concentrating on mental health so fiercely not only is it to take away your second amendment rights
[3:28:02.060 --> 3:28:07.100]  But also to to declare you ripe for good old pharma medication
[3:28:07.700 --> 3:28:09.300]  Good old pharma medication
[3:28:09.300 --> 3:28:16.900]  They would love for you to take because now you're living in an alternate reality on Facebook and you don't really know what's real and what's not oh
[3:28:17.620 --> 3:28:24.380]  I can't even tell you. I hope we all get off Facebook quick. Um, we can't we can't stay there. There's no way we can stay there
[3:28:24.380 --> 3:28:29.860]  It's not going to work out for us very well. Is it all right? I'm gonna come back. I have so much to go through with you
[3:28:29.860 --> 3:28:36.700]  Can I do the news in five minutes? Not really. There's too many headlines. There's too many atrocious things happening
[3:28:36.700 --> 3:28:42.700]  I hope all of you are gonna be part of this national walkout. It's gonna be really important to show them that we're not gonna take this
[3:28:43.540 --> 3:28:48.020]  Let's let's show up. Let's be Americans. Let's show that we love this country
[3:28:48.540 --> 3:28:54.940]  All right, this is easy a walkout for a couple of days. We can all handle it be right back Kate Dally your guest host
[3:28:54.940 --> 3:29:00.780]  After being unavailable for more than two years ultimate bone broth is back at info wars life
[3:29:01.180 --> 3:29:07.980]  Ultimate bone broth is now ultimate bone broth plus because we've made it even stronger and reformulated it and listen

[3:29:25.060 --> 3:29:30.500]  Bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt and just on and on and on magnesium
[3:29:31.180 --> 3:29:36.780]  Potassium's added this is so good for information for your immune system for your whole body
[3:29:36.980 --> 3:29:39.340]  Grandma always gave you chicken soup when you were sick
[3:29:39.340 --> 3:29:46.100]  Remember that's a tiny amount of the same stuff that's in there that is now in here in a very large amount
[3:29:46.100 --> 3:29:51.020]  So again get the power of grandma's chicken soup with the power of turmeric and everything else
[3:29:51.300 --> 3:29:57.620]  With the new and improved bone broth at infowarstore.com you in run contact tracers aren't coming
[3:29:57.620 --> 3:30:02.860]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany
[3:30:02.860 --> 3:30:08.700]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[3:30:08.700 --> 3:30:16.500]  Taking people away into the night to their facilities and they're planning in the next year to expand their shield
[3:30:16.660 --> 3:30:21.700]  Process where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety
[3:30:21.700 --> 3:30:26.820]  This is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality
[3:30:26.820 --> 3:30:31.380]  Faraday cages many of which are made here in America and are very compliant meaning u.s.

[3:30:55.380 --> 3:30:59.060]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware
[3:30:59.060 --> 3:31:05.620]  That there's a war between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other
[3:31:05.780 --> 3:31:12.900]  Who are literally trying to create a post human world for the United States of Brazil and of course triggered by the bricks at the UK
[3:31:13.500 --> 3:31:15.660]  Nations were pulling out of the private corporate
[3:31:15.940 --> 3:31:21.660]  Fascist world government. That's why they launched their great reset and their program after collapsing us of
[3:31:22.500 --> 3:31:24.260]  build back better
[3:31:24.260 --> 3:31:26.260]  This is nothing more than a top-down
[3:31:26.260 --> 3:31:34.060]  Vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left
[3:31:34.540 --> 3:31:37.500]  Which is the ideology of this world government system couldn't win
[3:31:38.140 --> 3:31:45.100]  They released a biological weapon on us now. We know two years ago. We learned about it about 20 months ago
[3:31:45.460 --> 3:31:48.780]  It's that simple. They can't be because of our free speech and our guns
[3:31:48.780 --> 3:31:55.180]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest of history expose this paradigm and we win
[3:31:59.380 --> 3:32:01.380]  It's now becoming accepted
[3:32:01.660 --> 3:32:10.100]  Knowledge accepted fact that global government run by private corporations is taking over the United States and other formerly sovereign nations
[3:32:10.140 --> 3:32:13.220]  They're being destroyed. All the checks and balances are being annihilated
[3:32:13.220 --> 3:32:20.580]  Our borders are being destroyed our currencies being destroyed and the American people have been listed as terrorists by the rogue federal government
[3:32:21.180 --> 3:32:24.780]  Info wars is going to continue to fight on and there is a big awakening happening
[3:32:24.780 --> 3:32:26.140]  We have a good chance of beating these people
[3:32:26.140 --> 3:32:29.660]  But we're not going to be able to stay on air unless you support us and you've been doing it
[3:32:29.660 --> 3:32:32.660]  So spread the word about the broadcast pray for the broadcast

[3:32:54.940 --> 3:33:06.540]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:10.540 --> 3:33:14.180]  Back here with you. Kate deli your guest host today and
[3:33:15.460 --> 3:33:18.100]  Boy, there's so many there's so many things
[3:33:18.100 --> 3:33:24.900]  That we need to know that I know it can be overwhelming and I know it can be overwhelming to talk to those
[3:33:25.100 --> 3:33:28.700]  individuals in your life as you're probably going to do over the holidays to tell them about
[3:33:29.980 --> 3:33:35.420]  Why you believe what you believe to be happening what it's right in front of us. You would think people see it
[3:33:35.420 --> 3:33:41.140]  It's like a wrestling match. You either see that it's fixed or you don't there's going to be many many people with their heads in
[3:33:41.140 --> 3:33:46.060]  The sand and I've done a lot of shows on this to try to understand where we're going and why
[3:33:46.060 --> 3:33:53.380]  Why what's happening to our country and how we're allowing it by hoping that if we give in a little a little a little
[3:33:53.780 --> 3:33:58.780]  That will reclaim our our liberty somehow. That's never happened before
[3:33:59.580 --> 3:34:04.620]  But and I can go back into history and I can tell you all my fears are absolutely
[3:34:05.900 --> 3:34:07.900]  Substantiated by history itself
[3:34:07.980 --> 3:34:12.660]  Now a hard lefty can't tell you that a hard lefty cannot tell you that
[3:34:12.660 --> 3:34:15.940]  They believe in climate change is going to kill us every ten years
[3:34:15.940 --> 3:34:20.580]  They don't believe anything is wrong with government telling us about our health and telling us what to do with our health
[3:34:20.660 --> 3:34:27.260]  They believe at all but in the past you can go back to any civilization at any time at any time any
[3:34:28.180 --> 3:34:32.140]  Civilization I can go back to the Haldemar. I can go back to the Jews
[3:34:32.140 --> 3:34:37.740]  I can go back to the Assyrian Christians being marched around the death to their desert to their death
[3:34:37.740 --> 3:34:45.140]  And I can tell you that at every at any time during that a mainstream media person would have been available
[3:34:46.020 --> 3:34:48.620]  No matter what they were called at the time, okay?
[3:34:48.940 --> 3:34:51.780]  Town cry or whatever and they would have told you
[3:34:52.300 --> 3:34:55.540]  They would have told you because you would have asked well, what's the biggest headline of the day?
[3:34:55.780 --> 3:34:58.620]  Do you know what they would have said to you? They would have said to you
[3:34:58.620 --> 3:35:01.540]  well, the biggest headline of the day is the fact that
[3:35:01.540 --> 3:35:08.940]  Your your government has told you to do x y and z and this is the latest instruction rule mandate order
[3:35:08.940 --> 3:35:15.540]  And that you're going to follow it because King what's her bucket or what's his bucket has decided that this is going to be the thing
[3:35:15.540 --> 3:35:16.740]  You're going to do
[3:35:16.740 --> 3:35:24.060]  But if you found somebody on the ground somebody that was an honest journalist somebody that was saying the things that weren't said
[3:35:24.460 --> 3:35:26.260]  What would they say to you?
[3:35:26.260 --> 3:35:29.700]  Do you know what they would say to you in very hushed tones?
[3:35:29.700 --> 3:35:35.660]  They would say to you. There's a genocide going on and no one's talking about it
[3:35:36.380 --> 3:35:39.100]  It's exactly what's happening right now
[3:35:40.620 --> 3:35:47.420]  There's no difference you can go back to any century and I can tell you about a genocide going on when government had too much power
[3:35:47.940 --> 3:35:52.460]  That's exactly what's happening right now. There's a genocide going on with our shots
[3:35:52.540 --> 3:35:58.060]  There's a genocide that's going to be going on with children. There's a genocide that's going on in the hospitals
[3:35:58.060 --> 3:36:02.820]  People aren't dying of kovat. They're dying of remdesivir plus a ventilator
[3:36:03.380 --> 3:36:05.380]  That's what they're dying of
[3:36:05.380 --> 3:36:10.580]  So how do we stop this hopefully a nationwide walkout? We'll put a little bit of a stop to it
[3:36:10.580 --> 3:36:18.220]  That's what I'm hoping and that's next week Monday through Thursday, but you know, I was going through some of the dr. Richard day
[3:36:18.660 --> 3:36:19.940]  You know
[3:36:19.940 --> 3:36:26.340]  What do you call them predictions and these predictions happened back in 1969 right at a conference in Pittsburgh?
[3:36:26.340 --> 3:36:29.860]  It was for pediatricians actually, but dr. Day was planned
[3:36:29.860 --> 3:36:36.860]  He was the director of Planned Parenthood and he was invited to come and give what what what whatever his presentation was going to be
[3:36:36.860 --> 3:36:43.980]  And his presentation re-evolved and and revolved around all of these predictions that were going to happen over the next 30 years
[3:36:43.980 --> 3:36:47.460]  And one of them was that housing would no longer exist
[3:36:48.140 --> 3:36:52.140]  Housing as we know it as far as those who have their houses right now
[3:36:52.140 --> 3:36:57.920]  You get to keep those although the taxes would be raised and it would be harder and harder to you know meet the
[3:36:58.420 --> 3:37:00.300]  demand of those taxes
[3:37:00.300 --> 3:37:03.260]  But the interesting thing was was when they said, you know
[3:37:04.020 --> 3:37:07.980]  Dr. Day predicted and this good doctor or this pediatrician wrote down
[3:37:07.980 --> 3:37:13.940]  You know what he said after this meeting because he was so alarmed by it, but he also said look he said
[3:37:14.580 --> 3:37:18.220]  Housing will be a thing of the past you'll be living with strangers
[3:37:18.220 --> 3:37:24.540]  To just meet the minimum requirement of what is going to be located in apartments or condominiums
[3:37:24.540 --> 3:37:28.460]  If you can hang on to the house you have right now hang on to it
[3:37:28.460 --> 3:37:31.420]  So my advice to you would be I don't know if I'd sell
[3:37:31.420 --> 3:37:34.380]  I don't know if I would let these big
[3:37:34.940 --> 3:37:38.260]  Conglomerations buy up your home and jack up the prices to
[3:37:38.540 --> 3:37:41.180]  For rent to people that can't afford it
[3:37:41.180 --> 3:37:45.980]  We're gonna have a lot of people and a lot of youngsters that cannot I just said the word youngsters
[3:37:45.980 --> 3:37:53.100]  How old am I right now? Um, I but but young people will not be allowed to be able to have
[3:37:53.660 --> 3:37:57.260]  Housing because they won't be able to afford it. The prices are not gonna come down
[3:37:57.580 --> 3:38:01.500]  They're gonna keep them artificially high and there will be houses that sit
[3:38:02.540 --> 3:38:06.540]  We uh, so I would I would make sure that you hold on to your house
[3:38:06.940 --> 3:38:09.820]  I really would don't cash out. I would make sure you hold on to it
[3:38:10.140 --> 3:38:13.660]  And the other thing I would do too is to make sure you have sources of meat
[3:38:13.660 --> 3:38:17.820]  Make sure that you have sources of food. Make sure you're growing your own food
[3:38:17.900 --> 3:38:25.740]  If they're growing it with so many damaging herbicides right now and so many damaging products right now to extend its shelf life
[3:38:26.700 --> 3:38:29.740]  You know what? I don't want my shelf life extended. How about that?
[3:38:31.100 --> 3:38:37.180]  I'm good. I don't need I don't need a bunch of chemicals where you know, McDonald's hamburger sits on there for you know
[3:38:37.340 --> 3:38:41.260]  A hundred years and and it's pretty edible at a hundred years. I'm good
[3:38:41.260 --> 3:38:44.620]  I don't want that junk in my in my food and I don't want
[3:38:45.180 --> 3:38:48.860]  I don't want to take a shot that it's its operating system that lights it up later on
[3:38:48.940 --> 3:38:50.300]  So, you know what?
[3:38:50.300 --> 3:38:55.580]  Right now we got to make really careful good decisions about water supply food supply
[3:38:56.060 --> 3:39:00.620]  Housing supply as we go into agenda 30 and everything is cropping up as government housing
[3:39:01.340 --> 3:39:04.780]  You know what? This is a time when you need to be involved in your city government
[3:39:04.860 --> 3:39:07.580]  When you need to be a part of those decisions that do not
[3:39:07.580 --> 3:39:13.260]  Do not require you to take fed money that do not require you to build up more government housing
[3:39:13.580 --> 3:39:19.180]  And to be able to live in these smaller. I would say smaller communities that would allow you
[3:39:19.820 --> 3:39:21.420]  bartering systems
[3:39:21.420 --> 3:39:24.940]  You know in the future and it was predicted back in 1969
[3:39:25.500 --> 3:39:33.660]  You will live in a society that is uh, you'll be paid by impulses, right? The the computer impulse for digital currency
[3:39:33.660 --> 3:39:37.740]  You will not be able to get a paycheck. You won't know what that's like anymore
[3:39:37.820 --> 3:39:44.780]  It'll just be the little carrot hanging dangling right there for currency in general, which which will be added to your
[3:39:45.340 --> 3:39:47.340]  Um to your bank account
[3:39:47.580 --> 3:39:53.580]  But will you be going around the grocery stores and people be wondering why you have so much food in your cart?
[3:39:53.660 --> 3:39:57.020]  Will you be reported on instantly for having too much food?
[3:39:57.020 --> 3:40:03.820]  Let's say you feed some people that live in your home and you're going to need a substantial amount of food for people
[3:40:03.900 --> 3:40:07.900]  That aren't registered that live in your home. Have you thought about that?
[3:40:08.540 --> 3:40:14.300]  Have you thought about the fact that your gun might be locked up in a central vault and you'll only be allowed to take it out
[3:40:14.380 --> 3:40:20.700]  If you show a good credit score a credit score meaning I love the government score. That's what that is
[3:40:21.100 --> 3:40:25.180]  It's a it's a credit score. But you know, obviously I've been talking about this for six years
[3:40:25.180 --> 3:40:31.500]  People thought I was off my rocker six years ago until they realized that we're entering into the realm of social credit now
[3:40:31.820 --> 3:40:33.340]  Just like china
[3:40:33.340 --> 3:40:40.220]  There's a lot of things to be aware of and I hope that we're all thinking outside the box a little bit to prepare for it not to scare
[3:40:40.700 --> 3:40:43.740]  But absolutely feel a little bit more peace by preparing
[3:40:44.060 --> 3:40:49.820]  We're going to have to demonstrate a lot more faith too. It isn't going to be where we're just praying more
[3:40:49.820 --> 3:40:56.060]  I mean, yes, we need to pray more, but you also have to demonstrate faith and that's going to come from only sacrifice
[3:40:57.100 --> 3:41:01.660]  Every generation has required some sacrifice in order to keep liberty
[3:41:01.740 --> 3:41:04.220]  We just got off a little scot-free since the 50s
[3:41:04.300 --> 3:41:09.740]  We haven't really been working on it and that's going to be to our detriment because now we're going to have to play catch up
[3:41:10.140 --> 3:41:12.140]  And we're going to have to start sacrificing
[3:41:12.460 --> 3:41:17.420]  But I really don't think god can perform a miracle in anyone's lives or especially in a country
[3:41:17.420 --> 3:41:22.140]  If no one is sacrificing and everybody's just going along to get along
[3:41:22.620 --> 3:41:26.460]  This is not going to work in our country. We have to demonstrate pushback
[3:41:26.940 --> 3:41:32.140]  And if it's stay home from work for a few days to demonstrate that I don't think that's a very big deal
[3:41:32.620 --> 3:41:36.220]  We're going to have to do things. We're going to have to be uncomfortable
[3:41:36.940 --> 3:41:42.220]  Because all the things that dr. Day talked about from 1969. They're coming true
[3:41:42.220 --> 3:41:47.500]  And if we don't realize what's coming down the pike and we can't prepare for this properly
[3:41:48.220 --> 3:41:51.900]  Then we are just sitting ducks who continuously take it
[3:41:52.460 --> 3:41:54.060]  I'm not going to be
[3:41:54.060 --> 3:41:59.100]  A sitting duck, you know, he actually said back in 1969 people would just disappear
[3:41:59.340 --> 3:42:01.020]  Everyone would know
[3:42:01.020 --> 3:42:05.820]  Everyone would know that people were being disposed of but they didn't want martyrs
[3:42:05.900 --> 3:42:10.860]  They didn't want people to rally around but everybody would know they would be afraid to ask
[3:42:10.860 --> 3:42:15.900]  But people would just start disappearing that we're speaking up or pushing back
[3:42:16.620 --> 3:42:23.900]  You know what? I fear god a lot more than I fear these evil little bastards. So actually, you know what?
[3:42:24.460 --> 3:42:29.260]  Fine, let's go that route. But I will take a stand before something like that
[3:42:29.900 --> 3:42:36.620]  Before I ever give in let's just say that I'll take a stand before I ever give in because it's not okay to give in
[3:42:36.620 --> 3:42:41.580]  We have got to demonstrate more sacrifice in this country and we're gonna have to start really
[3:42:42.300 --> 3:42:44.940]  Pushing it doing things and saying absolutely no
[3:42:44.940 --> 3:42:50.380]  I'm so proud of all of you that are stepping out on their jobs and saying I will not comply. Good for you
[3:42:50.380 --> 3:42:52.380]  I'll be right back. Kate dally

[3:43:55.420 --> 3:44:04.460]  Granny do right granny do right. Thanks for holding her on the air glad challenge. First of all, let me say
[3:44:04.780 --> 3:44:07.180]  I love your products. I am a granny and
[3:44:07.740 --> 3:44:12.380]  For all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me
[3:44:12.540 --> 3:44:16.540]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called
[3:44:16.540 --> 3:44:24.540]  But since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old
[3:44:25.740 --> 3:44:29.180]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought you know
[3:44:29.340 --> 3:44:33.580]  Well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[3:44:33.660 --> 3:44:36.700]  But when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately
[3:44:36.780 --> 3:44:44.140]  But you know over a period of time I started noticing. Okay, you know, this is the ticket. This is working. This is wonderful
[3:44:44.140 --> 3:44:49.740]  You know, I don't I don't have to put on derma blend anymore. You know, so anyway
[3:44:49.900 --> 3:44:53.500]  It works wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[3:44:59.100 --> 3:45:01.100]  It's now becoming accepted
[3:45:01.180 --> 3:45:05.820]  Knowledge accepted fact that global government run by private corporations
[3:45:06.140 --> 3:45:10.700]  Is taking over the united states and other formerly sovereign nations. They're being destroyed
[3:45:10.700 --> 3:45:15.980]  All the checks and balances are being annihilated our borders are being destroyed our currencies being destroyed
[3:45:16.220 --> 3:45:19.980]  And the american people have been listed as terrorist by the rogue federal government
[3:45:20.620 --> 3:45:24.060]  Info wars is going to continue to fight on and there is a big awakening happening
[3:45:24.060 --> 3:45:25.820]  We have a good chance of beating these people
[3:45:25.820 --> 3:45:29.020]  But we're not going to be able to stay on air unless you support us and you've been doing it
[3:45:29.100 --> 3:45:34.780]  So spread the word about the broadcast pray for the broadcast but also buy great products and info warshore.com
[3:45:34.940 --> 3:45:38.780]  If you're shopping with the big corporations or the establishment, you're aiding the enemy
[3:45:38.780 --> 3:45:43.420]  If you're funding us and getting great products, you are helping lead the war effort
[3:45:43.500 --> 3:45:47.900]  I cannot express to you how important it is to buy your products and do your christmas shopping
[3:45:47.980 --> 3:45:54.380]  And do your black friday shopping at info warshore.com. We've got store-wide free shipping right now and double patreon points
[3:45:55.420 --> 3:46:03.100]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food
[3:46:03.180 --> 3:46:04.700]  It's all come out
[3:46:04.700 --> 3:46:11.260]  And they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator and we are powerful
[3:46:11.500 --> 3:46:14.060]  And the social engineers fear that so much
[3:46:14.700 --> 3:46:20.620]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy. Is it true?
[3:46:22.380 --> 3:46:27.740]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless
[3:46:28.220 --> 3:46:33.740]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because
[3:46:33.740 --> 3:46:40.540]  They know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on to god of this world who is a loser
[3:46:40.940 --> 3:46:46.380]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever because even you don't believe in god
[3:46:47.020 --> 3:46:50.220]  What the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe channel
[3:46:50.540 --> 3:46:54.540]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast. They just announced
[3:46:54.540 --> 3:47:00.780]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:11.980 --> 3:47:13.020]  Kate dally
[3:47:13.020 --> 3:47:17.660]  Uh guest host back here with you from the kate dally show. I go live right after this on my own show
[3:47:17.740 --> 3:47:21.900]  I'm on the dial, which is really rare not bought and sold media on the dial
[3:47:21.900 --> 3:47:25.420]  You know and it's it's there's only a few shows out there alex is one
[3:47:25.500 --> 3:47:30.620]  I'm when there's only a few shows out there that are truth and media and I really hope
[3:47:31.260 --> 3:47:34.060]  That uh that all of us I think get ready
[3:47:34.620 --> 3:47:36.860]  For what's coming and we also push back
[3:47:37.500 --> 3:47:40.860]  So back when they were doing the nazi experiments
[3:47:41.500 --> 3:47:43.500]  They did you ever wonder why
[3:47:43.740 --> 3:47:45.740]  Hitler didn't just kill
[3:47:46.140 --> 3:47:51.180]  All of the jews. Why did he want a certain segment of them to undergo experiments?
[3:47:51.180 --> 3:47:52.540]  Why was that?
[3:47:52.540 --> 3:47:54.140]  What was the point of that?
[3:47:54.140 --> 3:47:56.140]  He just wanted to kill them all anyway
[3:47:56.780 --> 3:48:01.260]  Uh this evil dictator then why not why I mean why do the the experiments?
[3:48:01.500 --> 3:48:04.700]  This is when pharma was just exploding and right after
[3:48:05.260 --> 3:48:13.180]  World war two pharma went through the roof pharma had an answer for everything and homeopathic medicines and all of these things were out the
[3:48:13.340 --> 3:48:16.540]  Out the door. They demonized them in the flexner report
[3:48:16.540 --> 3:48:22.300]  Um of I think it was around 1910 1913 in between that in 1920
[3:48:22.620 --> 3:48:27.740]  They actually demonized any good medication and now when we see what's going on right now
[3:48:28.380 --> 3:48:31.100]  We are entering into the world of transhumanism
[3:48:31.500 --> 3:48:38.240]  So as just as they entered into the world of pharma and they made uh, they made pharma explode due to human experimentation
[3:48:38.240 --> 3:48:45.760]  Right now. We're at the experimentation human level of being their guinea pigs on a massive
[3:48:46.320 --> 3:48:48.880]  Massive scale worldwide, right?
[3:48:49.520 --> 3:48:56.000]  And they're doing these human experiments on us right now as part of a trial right all the way up until 2028
[3:48:57.120 --> 3:49:01.600]  Now think about this anytime somebody was ever in a trial you were checked out daily
[3:49:01.760 --> 3:49:06.640]  You know you had to go in you have to get your all your stats taken all of these things not anymore
[3:49:06.640 --> 3:49:08.640]  You're given these shots
[3:49:09.440 --> 3:49:12.080]  They're full of everything dangerous under the sun
[3:49:12.960 --> 3:49:14.960]  They moved out the date
[3:49:15.120 --> 3:49:22.480]  To be 14 days after the second dose to even qualify you as listing you as a fully vaccinated person
[3:49:23.040 --> 3:49:25.040]  one shot not vaccinated
[3:49:26.160 --> 3:49:33.200]  Two days after you got your second shot not vaccinated you have a heart attack on day three after your after your second shot not vaccinated
[3:49:33.200 --> 3:49:40.000]  Not until the 14th day after your second dose and they did that for a reason so they wouldn't have to count everything
[3:49:40.720 --> 3:49:44.320]  We are the human experiment for the launch of transhumanism
[3:49:45.120 --> 3:49:47.040]  think about that
[3:49:47.040 --> 3:49:50.000]  We are the experiment. They've been telling us for a decade
[3:49:50.880 --> 3:49:52.880]  So it's not as if they haven't said
[3:49:53.040 --> 3:49:55.920]  Is it the law of the universe where they actually these little evil?
[3:49:55.920 --> 3:50:04.480]  People have to tell us what's coming and then grin while we while we try to say out loud what they're doing and get called a conspiracy theorist
[3:50:04.560 --> 3:50:06.560]  pretty amazing isn't it
[3:50:06.640 --> 3:50:08.640]  Because they're out there saying it
[3:50:08.880 --> 3:50:09.760]  so
[3:50:09.760 --> 3:50:14.960]  I would recommend that you take every supplement known to man and order lots of them
[3:50:15.120 --> 3:50:21.840]  I would say that you need the supplements that alex talks about on this show. I would say that you need to have a
[3:50:22.400 --> 3:50:23.840]  whole
[3:50:23.840 --> 3:50:25.520]  garage full of
[3:50:25.520 --> 3:50:26.720]  medical
[3:50:26.720 --> 3:50:28.560]  medical things that can help you
[3:50:28.560 --> 3:50:32.800]  Whether it's an oxygen machine whether it's something to take blood pressure
[3:50:33.120 --> 3:50:41.680]  Do you know when I when when I covered the story about the guy in bosnia who talked about what was popular when his government went to crap and everybody was
[3:50:42.400 --> 3:50:47.760]  Scrambling and he said, you know, he said nobody ever had medical supplies on them
[3:50:48.160 --> 3:50:52.560]  Nobody knew how to facilitate a problem in the medical world
[3:50:52.560 --> 3:51:00.000]  So those who actually knew what they were doing or those that had the skills or those that even had a single band-aid
[3:51:00.560 --> 3:51:07.120]  Were very popular in the trading community right in bartering because they were able to barter out what they needed in life
[3:51:07.600 --> 3:51:14.640]  Also lighters lighters were a very popular item. This was in the 90s. Okay. We're not talking about, you know, 1800s
[3:51:14.800 --> 3:51:16.800]  We're talking about the 90s
[3:51:16.800 --> 3:51:22.480]  Lighters if you had a barrel full of just anything you could fit in your pocket a lighter, you know
[3:51:22.880 --> 3:51:26.880]  Anything like this for trade or bartering. It was very very important to have on hand
[3:51:28.160 --> 3:51:29.680]  As much as
[3:51:29.680 --> 3:51:34.240]  As I think that america will push back because we do not want the things that are happening
[3:51:34.400 --> 3:51:37.040]  I also want to be very very prepared
[3:51:37.600 --> 3:51:39.920]  Going into this and knowing that they're
[3:51:40.560 --> 3:51:42.960]  I would say well equipped plans
[3:51:42.960 --> 3:51:45.920]  There there are plans that they have for us
[3:51:46.480 --> 3:51:47.680]  um
[3:51:47.680 --> 3:51:54.560]  They will uh outlaw supplements. They will outlaw anything homeopathic. They will outlaw these things
[3:51:55.600 --> 3:51:59.920]  So to have them, you know, I would say would be vitally important
[3:52:00.480 --> 3:52:03.760]  Liposomal C crosses the blood brain brain barrier
[3:52:03.760 --> 3:52:06.320]  You can take a lot of it without digestive problems
[3:52:06.720 --> 3:52:10.400]  Take the whole vitamin C because absorbic acid is only the outer shell
[3:52:10.400 --> 3:52:15.120]  These are things we all need to know. You want the whole vitamin C power
[3:52:15.600 --> 3:52:20.560]  Powder you or or capsules you want to have vitamin D supplements
[3:52:20.800 --> 3:52:26.880]  You want to have all of these things if we go into transhumanism and we're considered the normals
[3:52:27.280 --> 3:52:33.120]  And you've got all of these people that are being devoid of conscience because I actually think that's really what they're after
[3:52:33.120 --> 3:52:41.760]  That's really what they're after is to sort of remove your ability as they go into transhumanism the ability to listen to God
[3:52:42.640 --> 3:52:44.640]  That's truly what I think
[3:52:44.720 --> 3:52:47.680]  After studying this for 10 years and I'm talking
[3:52:48.960 --> 3:52:50.960]  27,000 hours now
[3:52:50.960 --> 3:52:52.960]  27,000 hours of study
[3:52:54.080 --> 3:52:56.080]  It's really studying
[3:52:56.560 --> 3:52:58.960]  Really uh the plans of evil
[3:52:59.760 --> 3:53:01.760]  That's what this is all about
[3:53:01.760 --> 3:53:06.720]  And so you have to think okay, if you were the most evil guy in the world, what would you want?
[3:53:06.880 --> 3:53:11.120]  You would not want people to have their health. You'd want to drive big profits of pharma
[3:53:11.360 --> 3:53:16.560]  You would not want people to have faith. You would not want people to be close to God their creator
[3:53:16.560 --> 3:53:18.560]  You would not want any of these things
[3:53:19.040 --> 3:53:25.440]  So what industries would you be in charge of if you were pure evil? What industries would you take?
[3:53:26.560 --> 3:53:28.080]  pharma
[3:53:28.080 --> 3:53:32.560]  The vaccine industry that we didn't need because we had great sanitation starting in the 50s
[3:53:33.760 --> 3:53:35.760]  And that's usually the reason you get plagues
[3:53:36.720 --> 3:53:38.720]  all of these things happen
[3:53:39.200 --> 3:53:43.360]  Because we're willing to just go along with it instead of pushing back on it
[3:53:44.000 --> 3:53:47.840]  And as these things are happening in in our society right now
[3:53:48.320 --> 3:53:50.320]  We have we can't underestimate evil
[3:53:50.880 --> 3:53:56.880]  And I think honestly that's what a lot of people have done up until now they underestimated. Oh, it can't happen here
[3:53:56.880 --> 3:54:01.360]  We're in america. We're free. We have liberty my my government loves me
[3:54:01.920 --> 3:54:03.920]  I feel like sally field, you know
[3:54:04.000 --> 3:54:07.920]  Getting the oscar. They like me. They really really like me. No, they don't
[3:54:08.720 --> 3:54:11.120]  They don't they don't like you at all
[3:54:12.080 --> 3:54:17.120]  They actually would like to erase you because they don't like people in general
[3:54:17.600 --> 3:54:22.880]  They look at us like cattle. We should all start walking around and mooing. That's how they view us
[3:54:22.880 --> 3:54:29.520]  So once you finally get how evil these people are and what they're willing to do to you
[3:54:30.080 --> 3:54:32.480]  You have to then take steps to shore yourself up
[3:54:33.120 --> 3:54:37.280]  You better have an atmospheric water machine or something that can deliver you water
[3:54:37.360 --> 3:54:41.360]  I don't care where it is or how you do it or you dig deep ladies and gentlemen
[3:54:41.920 --> 3:54:48.720]  Go to primarywater.org and start drilling down and get some neighbors and start drilling down because water is there
[3:54:48.720 --> 3:54:50.720]  It's right under our feet. It's everywhere
[3:54:50.720 --> 3:54:59.360]  Or you have your own sources of meat. You have you farmers local farmers that you know that you can absolutely buy their products
[3:55:00.240 --> 3:55:02.240]  That are not nano tainted
[3:55:02.960 --> 3:55:06.240]  I think the last thing we need are more nano particles in our systems, right?
[3:55:07.040 --> 3:55:12.240]  Light up like a christmas tree. Heck, we won't even need christmas trees following christmas's good heavens
[3:55:12.720 --> 3:55:16.800]  Luciferis is it in all is it in all of that? I've been researching that lately
[3:55:16.800 --> 3:55:20.000]  Is it in all the nano technology that they've been using in our foods?
[3:55:21.120 --> 3:55:25.440]  Anyway, I just want all of us to be very aware of what's coming and
[3:55:26.160 --> 3:55:31.760]  Transhumanism mental problems that they diagnose us with because of the reality of the world
[3:55:31.760 --> 3:55:36.000]  We're living in it's going to get harder and harder because what's up is down and down is up
[3:55:37.040 --> 3:55:44.800]  And the media is going to sell it like crazy. They're going to sell you the lie like you've never been lied to before
[3:55:44.800 --> 3:55:49.840]  They're even telling you when they say f joe biden that you're not actually hearing that
[3:55:50.560 --> 3:55:52.560]  Can you believe these guys?
[3:55:52.960 --> 3:55:59.600]  The audacity you didn't hear that. Well, it's just like uh with everything 9 11. You didn't see that see
[3:56:00.480 --> 3:56:07.600]  So they firmly count on the idea that they can show you pictures and tell you what you're seeing and what you're feeling
[3:56:08.320 --> 3:56:13.120]  And have you ignore the reality of what you're seeing hearing and feeling? That's pretty sad
[3:56:13.120 --> 3:56:15.120]  right
[3:56:15.840 --> 3:56:22.080]  So if you want to be prepared for what's coming make sure you have your food sources your water sources
[3:56:22.240 --> 3:56:26.640]  Your housing source all tied up with the bow and make sure that health wise
[3:56:27.360 --> 3:56:31.600]  That you have it covered that you're not having to visit our centralized
[3:56:32.160 --> 3:56:39.760]  Medicine hospitals anymore that you can stay away from that as much as you possibly can sure there might be instances where you have to go
[3:56:40.960 --> 3:56:42.160]  but
[3:56:42.160 --> 3:56:48.720]  I would trust I would trust your knowledge as you gain knowledge in the in the health world and know what to do
[3:56:49.200 --> 3:56:53.760]  Many many people solved problems for many many years in this country without pharma
[3:56:54.560 --> 3:56:58.160]  So the first time you think pharma for that pill you think is saving your life
[3:56:58.240 --> 3:57:02.400]  You might want to look at the homeopathic alternative for that and be very well
[3:57:03.040 --> 3:57:05.520]  advised and equipped in medicine
[3:57:06.000 --> 3:57:09.200]  As we come into this next seven eight years
[3:57:09.200 --> 3:57:16.480]  I hope we can all get prepared because preparing it brings peace. It really does. I feel a lot of peace right now
