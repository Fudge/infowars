[00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:06.181]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:07.942]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.942 --> 00:00:09.702]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:11.283]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:12.843]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.843 --> 00:00:17.024]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:21.085]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:40.852]  The arctic blast of Jonas now hitting the east coast of the United States in what's being dubbed... Our story's been up on Drudge since yesterday afternoon.
[00:00:40.852 --> 00:00:43.816]  It's still there in the top left-hand corner at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:00:44.537 --> 00:00:46.939]  It's also on Infowars.com, obviously.
[00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:47.979]  Snowmageddon!
[00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:52.963]  Empty store shelves as panicked shoppers ransack grocery stores.
[00:00:52.963 --> 00:01:01.329]  And we can punch up behind us on screen of your TV viewer, NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
[00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.871]  And you can see what is hitting the East Coast.
[00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:06.092]  Right now.
[00:01:06.092 --> 00:01:11.715]  Leanne McAdoo is in Flint, Michigan, looking at the collapsing infrastructure of this country.
[00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:16.297]  She'll be popping in at the bottom of the third hour.
[00:01:16.297 --> 00:01:20.459]  Wow, it is another absolutely jam-packed broadcast today.
[00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:21.240]  Michael Schneider.
[00:01:22.142 --> 00:01:29.128]  We'll be joining us to look at the accelerated economic collapse that is barely even getting any media coverage.
[00:01:29.128 --> 00:01:33.492]  I mean, they're admitting it's happening, but they're just kind of calmly... We've hit an iceberg, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:36.214]  The ship will be going under momentarily.
[00:01:36.214 --> 00:01:39.196]  It may take a few hours, but just enjoy yourselves.
[00:01:39.196 --> 00:01:44.020]  We're going to be looking at that with Michael Scheiner today and opening the phones up.
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.026]  National Review has been uninvited from being one of the moderators at the next Republican debate.
[00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:53.865]  Because they put out this manifesto.
[00:01:53.865 --> 00:02:03.693]  I wish they put out a manifesto against communism, or against crony capitalism, or against globalism, or against the New World Order, or against the attack on the Second Amendment.
[00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:12.828]  But no, the National Review, Buckley did a lot of good things, but he was basically CIA, that's come out.
[00:02:12.828 --> 00:02:19.512]  William F. Buckley, and I'm not attacking him, my cousin's named after him, that's how much my family likes him.
[00:02:19.512 --> 00:02:27.598]  But the point is, is that they've been controlling the conservative movement forever, since the 60s, when they really got worried about Barry Goldwater.
[00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:38.188]  And they're here trying to basically deep six a conservative, libertarian, populist movement led by Donald Trump.
[00:02:38.188 --> 00:02:43.953]  And regardless of what you want to say about Donald Trump, we keep getting screwed over by establishment Republicans.
[00:02:43.953 --> 00:02:51.341]  And I respect a lot of people that listed themselves like it was a Declaration of Independence on the front of the magazine.
[00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:55.103]  But a lot of them I don't as well.
[00:02:55.103 --> 00:03:02.545]  I mean, I've heard absolutely tyrannical things come out of some of these people's mouths, like William Crystal and Glenn Beck.
[00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:04.385]  And I'm just calling a spade a spade here.
[00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:06.265]  I don't want to sit here and get in fights with these people.
[00:03:06.265 --> 00:03:08.166]  I really respect Thomas Sowell.
[00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:11.727]  Had him on a few times with some of these other folks.
[00:03:11.727 --> 00:03:15.028]  But this is disgusting behavior.
[00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:15.808]  In fact, there's another
[00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:28.148]  Article in the Weekly Standard and the cover story shows Donald Trump high atop Trump Tower as King Kong.
[00:03:28.148 --> 00:03:34.190]  And he is the King Kong that could defeat these individuals.
[00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.273]  The problem is Hillary Clinton is an even bigger King Kong.
[00:03:47.332 --> 00:04:01.786]  Because she's got the media behind her, she's got the money behind her, she's got the establishment behind her, and she's got women who will vote for her because she is a woman.
[00:04:01.786 --> 00:04:02.606]  Period.
[00:04:02.606 --> 00:04:03.167]  End of story.
[00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:09.001]  The Democratic Party is such an incredible cult.
[00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:20.072]  If we run Sarah Palin against her, as VP or even as President last time, you notice that the left media talked about how stupid she was all day and tried to make her look dumb like George W. Bush.
[00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:25.258]  Bush stuck his foot in his mouth pretty much every day, so it was easy to make him look stupid.
[00:04:28.406 --> 00:04:36.929]  I don't know if he got put in the microwave oven or what, but the guy I saw around Austin and saw give speeches was smart, off the cuff, and had brown hair.
[00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:43.151]  As soon as he gets elected, his hair turns gray and he seems like he had, you know, his IQ reduced by 40 points.
[00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:48.953]  But the case with Palin, she's a really smart lady and they called her stupid.
[00:04:48.953 --> 00:04:51.234]  Again, showing where the feminists really come from.
[00:04:51.234 --> 00:04:55.556]  If you're not a globalist, then they're gonna call a woman stupid and use all these cliches.
[00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:05.736]  The Democratic Party establishment that wants to install Hillary into the White House in this next election season is currently in freefall.
[00:05:05.736 --> 00:05:14.065]  The plan for potential first husband Bill Clinton has failed miserably, as women have crawled out of the woodwork to describe his detailed history of sexual abuse.
[00:05:14.065 --> 00:05:19.911]  She also has the looming email scandal, which doesn't seem to go away, no matter how many jokes she throws at it.
[00:05:19.911 --> 00:05:21.433]  The latest news comes out of Beaumont.
[00:05:21.493 --> 00:05:24.657]  Where only six people were at the airport to greet the former first lady.
[00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:28.401]  KDFM reported that she didn't say hello or visit any of those six people.
[00:05:28.401 --> 00:05:29.662]  She just drove away.
[00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:30.783]  And where was she going?
[00:05:30.783 --> 00:05:35.509]  Oh, to a private fundraiser held by Pakistani businessman Tahir Javid to collect $500,000.
[00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:38.572]  The news reported it as a private meeting.
[00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:42.076]  Back in 2008, she attended another private meeting with Barack Obama.
[00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:46.099]  This occurred, of course, in Chantilly, Virginia, during the Bilderberg meeting.
[00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:51.344]  In fact, her campaign has become so desperate, she's now labeling Bernie Sanders as a white elitist.
[00:05:51.344 --> 00:05:53.125]  Read the article at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:54.987]  Bernie Sanders, very white.
[00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:58.110]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:06:58.635 --> 00:06:59.235]  I want more candy!
[00:06:59.235 --> 00:07:00.556]  I want more video games!
[00:07:00.556 --> 00:07:00.656]  Why?
[00:07:00.656 --> 00:07:01.017]  Why?
[00:07:01.017 --> 00:07:01.077]  Why?
[00:07:28.655 --> 00:07:29.416]  I think so.
[00:08:03.027 --> 00:08:05.868]  We are on the march.
[00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:08.489]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:08:08.489 --> 00:08:10.891]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:16.073]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you how to play.
[00:08:16.073 --> 00:08:22.436]  You win some, lose some, but you'll listen to me.
[00:08:22.436 --> 00:08:27.498]  The pleasure is to play.
[00:08:27.498 --> 00:08:29.659]  I know just what you're saying.
[00:08:41.425 --> 00:08:45.468]  Well, I tend to start every broadcast the same way because it's so true.
[00:08:45.468 --> 00:08:48.851]  In the past, I'd say this would be once a month, but, I mean, it's every day.
[00:08:48.851 --> 00:08:50.192]  It's just more intense.
[00:08:50.192 --> 00:08:52.433]  The optics are getting crystal clear.
[00:08:52.433 --> 00:08:54.935]  We see exactly where we're going.
[00:08:54.935 --> 00:08:57.037]  A consortium of top scientists.
[00:08:57.617 --> 00:09:14.686]  have besieged the global leaders at the Davos Forum to please stop the AI technocrat takeover and are warning that the electronic smart grid hooked into AI computers will give rise to a AI takeover.
[00:09:14.686 --> 00:09:15.467]  Well, that's the plan.
[00:09:16.701 --> 00:09:25.266]  When Google was founded 17 years ago in 1999, they had the top investors there, and this was reported on in Wired Magazine last year.
[00:09:25.266 --> 00:09:40.455]  I've been told about it by government and industry whistleblowers, including inside Google, over a decade ago, that they're in this board meeting and they say, this is just another search engine using NSA proprietary technology we've given you.
[00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:43.837]  And the directors look at them and say, no sir, we're building an AI.
[00:09:47.418 --> 00:09:53.381]  We intend for it to be sentient within 10 years.
[00:09:53.381 --> 00:09:59.785]  Now you don't think they're going to tell you if it becomes sentient, do you?
[00:09:59.785 --> 00:10:15.714]  But I'm seeing moves by governments and systems that are so complex and so 6th, 7th, 8th dimensional in their complexity and sophistication that you can tell machines are making the decisions already.
[00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:21.160]  And by the way, they admit on the stock market that machines are making the decisions for at least a decade.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:29.608]  They admit that for at least a decade, the next wave of drones that are already out there, they're just kidding around and telling you about them, are completely autonomous.
[00:10:29.608 --> 00:10:34.033]  Both underwater, surface water, air, land, you name it.
[00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:38.036]  Air, land, sea.
[00:10:38.036 --> 00:10:38.637]  Submariner.
[00:10:42.904 --> 00:10:44.505]  And so, it's already here.
[00:10:44.505 --> 00:10:51.189]  The elites are already using complex algorithms to make most their decisions.
[00:10:51.189 --> 00:10:53.831]  We already basically are under AI rule.
[00:10:53.831 --> 00:11:02.477]  Let me just make that announcement here, that in my educated opinion, we are already under AI control.
[00:11:02.477 --> 00:11:03.817]  And of course, isn't that just perfect?
[00:11:03.817 --> 00:11:06.019]  It follows the whole plan of soft kill.
[00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:11.843]  You don't know they're adding fluoride to brain damage you and lower your fertility, even though they're on white papers admit it, because the mainstream media won't tell you.
[00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:23.014]  You don't know there's a plan to break up the family, even though you can turn on the TV and see the messages meant to do that.
[00:11:23.014 --> 00:11:27.796]  It's all under the surface.
[00:11:27.796 --> 00:11:30.016]  It's all stealth.
[00:11:30.016 --> 00:11:36.919]  But as we enter the more intense phases of this, it's going to become very, very transparent.
[00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:39.139]  It's going to uncloak itself.
[00:11:39.139 --> 00:11:41.120]  And we're now reaching the uncloaking moment.
[00:11:43.362 --> 00:11:55.432]  And a moment in the history of man, in the history of time, in the history of this planet, is 10, 20 years, 30 years.
[00:11:55.432 --> 00:11:58.034]  That's a moment in time.
[00:11:58.034 --> 00:12:00.196]  In the past.
[00:12:00.196 --> 00:12:03.018]  In the lives of civilizations.
[00:12:03.018 --> 00:12:10.264]  Now because of the compression of time and the acceleration of technology moving towards the singularity,
[00:12:15.362 --> 00:12:17.466]  Five years, maybe.
[00:12:17.466 --> 00:12:19.369]  Maybe one year.
[00:12:19.369 --> 00:12:21.212]  Maybe one hour.
[00:12:21.212 --> 00:12:27.903]  We don't know what chain reactions are going to take place, and the elite themselves admit they're all in a giant experiment, and we're in the experiment.
[00:12:29.178 --> 00:12:58.708]  And they don't know exactly what's going to happen, but they've got computers monitoring the mass movements of machines, and raw material, and industry, and more importantly, human decisions, millisecond by millisecond, are tracking tens of billions of human activities, fed into complex supercomputer systems, interfacing with billions of people per second, creating the new entity.
[00:13:00.782 --> 00:13:09.824]  That is a human-machine interface merger, like a sperm and an egg coming together.
[00:13:09.824 --> 00:13:18.366]  Or the collapsing universe at the Big Bang then suddenly reversing its polarity.
[00:13:18.366 --> 00:13:19.367]  Game over, man!
[00:13:19.367 --> 00:13:23.268]  Game over.
[00:13:23.268 --> 00:13:28.049]  And now men want to ask me why I'm not into the playoffs this weekend?
[00:13:28.049 --> 00:13:28.609]  I'm sorry.
[00:13:30.262 --> 00:13:40.989]  I'm so busy covering the incredible hardcore news that I haven't even gotten into the ninth planet that was discovered that they announced last week.
[00:13:40.989 --> 00:13:44.091]  And of course they discovered it a long time ago, they just got around to telling us.
[00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:51.476]  And there's a reason they didn't get around to telling us about it.
[00:13:51.476 --> 00:13:54.978]  I am someone who always got sick and tired of hearing about Planet X.
[00:13:57.898 --> 00:14:05.362]  Because as long as I've been on the air, people are saying, it's coming next year, it's coming in three years, it's going to happen.
[00:14:05.362 --> 00:14:20.150]  The ancients said it comes through every 20,000 years in a different type of orbit that doesn't go in circles around the sun, but goes way out past the Kuiper Belt and comes in basically at an elliptical.
[00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:39.637]  And then I started reading deeper into this planet, and there it was, a 20,000 year deformed orbit, going out into deep space, 10 times the size of the Earth.
[00:14:39.637 --> 00:14:42.938]  It is Planet X, folks.
[00:14:42.938 --> 00:14:47.220]  Isn't that just perfect, that this would just show up while all this circus is going on?
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.361]  Now, I want to be clear about this.
[00:14:50.361 --> 00:14:53.022]  It fits the bill of Planet X. They're probably
[00:14:55.464 --> 00:14:56.584]  50, 60, 100, 1,000!
[00:14:56.584 --> 00:14:58.885]  I don't know, Planet X's!
[00:14:58.885 --> 00:15:17.114]  They've already chronicled hundreds and hundreds of planetoids bigger than Pluto in the Kuiper Belt out past the former ninth planet, named after the god of the underworld.
[00:15:17.114 --> 00:15:19.235]  A fitting name.
[00:15:19.235 --> 00:15:21.256]  The Roman god of hell.
[00:15:24.073 --> 00:15:29.217]  So they said no more ninth planet because we gotta say we have hundreds of planets if there's things bigger than it.
[00:15:29.217 --> 00:15:32.320]  Well, Pluto's little.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:39.625]  This sucker is gigantor.
[00:15:39.625 --> 00:15:40.326]  Compared to Pluto.
[00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:53.949]  They're in the news today, meteorologists talking about how the moon being full during the blizzard is going to make it worse, and it does.
[00:15:53.949 --> 00:16:03.273]  It affects space winds, winds of space, the sun, and a lot more.
[00:16:03.273 --> 00:16:08.416]  Why the full moon could make this weekend's blizzard more destructive, who knows?
[00:16:09.275 --> 00:16:10.857]  We're good to go.
[00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:38.597]  And the Mayans and all these other cultures said this big planet comes through and that there's earthquakes and volcanoes and all hell breaks loose and it comes through every 20,000 years and then now here it comes.
[00:16:38.597 --> 00:16:42.778]  Now I don't know if this is the one because there's so many of them out there.
[00:16:42.778 --> 00:16:45.619]  Who knows what's out there?
[00:16:45.619 --> 00:16:52.561]  We're too busy looking at Hillary Clinton and going, I'm voting for her because she's a woman.
[00:16:52.561 --> 00:16:53.141]  Who cares?
[00:16:55.029 --> 00:17:11.966]  What I'm getting at is we don't have time for racism and sexism and all this fighting and all this garbage and all this divide-and-conquer when we have genetic engineering going on, splicing and mutating every species on the planet like something out of H.G.
[00:17:11.966 --> 00:17:16.791]  Wells' The Island of Dr. Maru squared.
[00:17:21.494 --> 00:17:30.631]  Every freakazoid activity you can imagine going on and every scientifically deployed program on record in in-game
[00:17:34.701 --> 00:17:50.596]  1.5, we put out on the internet like eight years ago, we interviewed the professors and people and they show the university documents from the 60s with the CIA, how they would destroy gender, how they would destroy the family, and finally they would even just destroy individualism and how they would do it.
[00:17:50.596 --> 00:17:55.581]  And I remember covering that eight, nine years ago and thinking, this is so crazy, you'll never get away with it.
[00:17:55.581 --> 00:17:59.945]  And then I have the articles right here in front of me, folks, where they've got first graders
[00:18:03.112 --> 00:18:17.045]  Right through twelfth grade, making a large part of the school curriculum officially federally run, this is CBC News reporting, to let quote five-year-olds choose their gender.
[00:18:17.045 --> 00:18:19.427]  That's like saying it's going to be Batman, Superman, or Wonder Woman.
[00:18:19.427 --> 00:18:20.148]  They don't know.
[00:18:20.148 --> 00:18:23.491]  It's not the government's place to get involved with your child's gender and their sex.
[00:18:25.717 --> 00:18:41.384]  And then inject it to create the confusion as if it's a new option to allow them to sexualize children and they sell it like it's political correctness and just making people, and yes, they're getting rid of he and she and dad and mom and father and mother.
[00:18:41.384 --> 00:18:50.528]  It's all in a CBC article that's written like Kurt Vonnegut's satire, but they're deadly serious and they're doing it.
[00:18:50.528 --> 00:18:53.329]  Not at one school or this school or some liberal school.
[00:18:55.339 --> 00:19:04.706]  Not at some, you know, trendy art school where a third of the kids end up in prison or, you know, commit suicide, because they confuse them so much.
[00:19:04.706 --> 00:19:11.371]  But officially in every school in the country that's government accredited, they're going to get in there and jack with their brains.
[00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:13.052]  Same thing in Europe, same thing here.
[00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:17.656]  We're about two years behind Canada.
[00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:20.038]  Kids aren't going to be talking about super planets.
[00:19:21.032 --> 00:19:28.596]  They're not going to be talking about fission fusion, not going to be talking about space travel, not going to be talking about tribal memories, not going to be talking about the mysteries of the universe.
[00:19:28.596 --> 00:19:39.062]  They're going to have weirdo cult leaders hanging over them, telling them he and she is bad and you don't have to be a boy or girl or you can be gay or you can be this.
[00:19:39.062 --> 00:19:46.586]  What a group of cult creeps that we let come in and jack us over and turn us into idiots.
[00:19:46.586 --> 00:19:47.486]  Stay with us.
[00:19:47.486 --> 00:19:48.307]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:19:54.585 --> 00:19:59.906]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:19:59.906 --> 00:20:01.847]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[00:20:01.847 --> 00:20:04.368]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[00:20:04.368 --> 00:20:08.229]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[00:20:08.229 --> 00:20:17.031]  Ten years ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[00:20:17.031 --> 00:20:20.312]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[00:20:21.192 --> 00:20:24.336]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[00:20:24.336 --> 00:20:29.702]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[00:20:29.702 --> 00:20:34.627]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[00:20:34.627 --> 00:20:37.791]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:40.033]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[00:20:40.874 --> 00:20:47.900]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallets, sleeves, or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.

[00:20:53.505 --> 00:20:55.887]  It is as though the protection is free.

[00:20:59.167 --> 00:21:04.650]  As your body ages, there's a 10% decline in your ability to repair each passing decade after the age 28.

[00:21:26.482 --> 00:21:29.344]  I recently went from a desk job to a manual labor job.
[00:21:29.344 --> 00:21:30.444]  Normally, I'm worn out.
[00:21:30.444 --> 00:21:36.247]  With Energy Enhanced One World Way, I now recover so quickly that I can perform very hard work all day long.
[00:21:36.247 --> 00:21:41.609]  I use Energy Enhanced One World Way for breakfast and lunch, and I experience less hunger throughout the day.
[00:21:41.609 --> 00:21:44.731]  I have a 30% increase in energy, and I just feel better.
[00:21:44.731 --> 00:21:48.353]  I plan to make Energy Enhanced One World Way a permanent part of my lifestyle.

[00:23:53.544 --> 00:23:55.285]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:17.563 --> 00:24:19.324]  Coming up, Davos Insider.
[00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:20.645]  World economy doomed.
[00:24:20.645 --> 00:24:23.948]  Central banks out of ammo.
[00:24:23.948 --> 00:24:28.852]  Yeah, they already shot all the ammo right through us.
[00:24:28.852 --> 00:24:30.073]  They get all the free money.
[00:24:30.073 --> 00:24:32.394]  We pay the bill for it.
[00:24:32.394 --> 00:24:40.661]  They give themselves immunity and sit there and laugh, surrounded by paramilitary troops, who as soon as they retire, they list as the number one enemy.
[00:24:41.874 --> 00:24:42.574]  Gotta love it.
[00:24:42.574 --> 00:24:44.156]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:44.156 --> 00:24:54.062]  I'm going to cover Snowmageddon 2016 and talk about the different meteorologists we've had on the last few years predicting a major cooling cycle, which we're now seeing.
[00:24:54.062 --> 00:24:59.286]  A mini ice age is what we're set for ahead of a larger
[00:25:00.126 --> 00:25:04.087]  Ice Age in the 10 to 11,000 year cycle.
[00:25:04.087 --> 00:25:08.047]  The last Ice Age ended about 11,000 years ago on record.
[00:25:08.047 --> 00:25:11.188]  They have the ice core samples from the north.
[00:25:11.188 --> 00:25:12.488]  And it's just like clockwork.
[00:25:12.488 --> 00:25:14.128]  There are not just the four seasons.
[00:25:14.128 --> 00:25:15.889]  There's not just 365.
[00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:17.349]  There are larger seasons.
[00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:19.709]  And it's all based on the sun.
[00:25:19.709 --> 00:25:27.911]  That giant thermonuclear explosion going on up in the sky.
[00:25:27.911 --> 00:25:29.111]  That we're the third rock from.
[00:25:31.834 --> 00:25:39.358]  But the UN voted, remember, five years ago to say the sun has no effect on climate, because all these scientists were telling them, no, it's not carbon dioxide, it's the sun.
[00:25:39.358 --> 00:25:40.759]  But they voted!
[00:25:40.759 --> 00:25:43.741]  How about they vote that they're galactic rulers of the universe?
[00:25:45.503 --> 00:25:58.875]  There's like famously, you know, schizophrenics will get up during city council ones and one guy gets up in Houston and announces himself that, you know, he's really Prince Charles and rules the world and, you know, is making money in all time zones.
[00:25:58.875 --> 00:26:01.558]  Why not just announce the sun doesn't exist?
[00:26:01.558 --> 00:26:07.083]  Or give 50 more Nobel Peace Prizes to Obama when he launches all these wars?
[00:26:07.083 --> 00:26:08.985]  You know, why not say 2 plus 2 equals 5?
[00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:17.463]  The problem is, it's working on the young people that have never known anything but this.
[00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:24.211]  Coming up, Richard Reeves got a great question into Hillary and she answered it.
[00:26:24.211 --> 00:26:27.252]  Our political correspondent on the ground.
[00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:31.073]  He'll be joining us via video Skype today at the start of the third hour.
[00:26:31.073 --> 00:26:34.454]  Head of Lee and McAdoo from Flint, Michigan.
[00:26:34.454 --> 00:26:39.156]  Just the edifice collapsing and showing the rotting infrastructure in the nation.
[00:26:39.156 --> 00:26:41.297]  The more we pay for it, the worse it gets.
[00:26:41.297 --> 00:26:42.817]  We'll break down that scam.
[00:26:42.817 --> 00:26:45.218]  But breaking Hillary denies email hack.
[00:26:46.374 --> 00:26:48.135]  We're going to be getting to that.
[00:26:48.135 --> 00:26:52.577]  She said, no, no one hacked me, even though the Secret Service insiders have gone public.
[00:26:52.577 --> 00:26:59.220]  The head, former head of the Defense Department, Robert Gates has come out and said that indeed, you know, she was clearly hacked.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.640]  I mean, the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.080]  They did.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.101]  And she probably knew it.
[00:27:06.081 --> 00:27:11.266]  And she's just lying about it, just like she said there were no classified emails, and then there were, and then there were no more emails, and then there were more.
[00:27:11.266 --> 00:27:25.419]  But don't worry, let's not go after Hillary, because National Review has published a big cover story against Trump, and the editors, it's a John Hancock moment, Declaration of Independence, they all put their names on the front of it.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.440]  I wish they were against communism.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.981]  I wish they were against taking our guns.
[00:27:30.981 --> 00:27:32.421]  I wish they were against world government.
[00:27:32.421 --> 00:27:36.802]  I wish they were against breast cancer up 3,000% and finding out why.
[00:27:36.802 --> 00:27:40.983]  We know why, but I wish they cared about their family, their women, their children.
[00:27:40.983 --> 00:27:41.923]  But they don't.
[00:27:41.923 --> 00:27:47.404]  They're just caught up in the whole media spectacle, going along with, oh, oh Trump.
[00:27:47.404 --> 00:27:49.325]  We don't want the Republican establishment.
[00:27:49.325 --> 00:27:51.225]  We're sick of the rhinos.
[00:27:51.225 --> 00:27:52.185]  We're sick of it.
[00:27:52.185 --> 00:27:55.306]  Doesn't mean Trump's perfect, but he's a sign of the awakening.
[00:27:56.479 --> 00:27:58.401]  Remember National Review in the last few years?
[00:27:58.401 --> 00:28:04.468]  National Review criticizes Alex Jones as fire and brimstone preacher, and says I was wrong for what I did on Piers Morgan.
[00:28:04.468 --> 00:28:14.901]  In another story, they said I'm bad to worry about militarization of police, armored vehicles, and the billions of bullets, and that I made it up!
[00:28:14.901 --> 00:28:16.603]  They're saying I made it up!
[00:28:18.186 --> 00:28:23.191]  And that Congress shouldn't be passing laws that we shouldn't have federal troops for patriots.
[00:28:23.191 --> 00:28:25.333]  Of course, it's now all admitted.
[00:28:25.333 --> 00:28:28.736]  The truth is, you don't control the narrative anymore, National Review.
[00:28:28.736 --> 00:28:30.958]  DrudgeReport.com does.
[00:28:30.958 --> 00:28:32.560]  Infowars.com does.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.062]  WorldNetDaily does.
[00:28:35.062 --> 00:28:36.304]  Gun Owners of America does.
[00:28:36.304 --> 00:28:37.445]  My listeners do.
[00:28:37.445 --> 00:28:39.026]  And I love Rand Paul.
[00:28:39.026 --> 00:28:40.007]  I like him.
[00:28:40.007 --> 00:28:42.610]  But I've told him from the start, he made a mistake going after Trump.
[00:28:44.141 --> 00:28:46.803]  Cruz has made the mistake now and he's going down in the polls.
[00:28:46.803 --> 00:28:48.504]  I wanted you to win, bro.
[00:28:48.504 --> 00:28:50.726]  So I gave you the real advice.
[00:28:50.726 --> 00:28:55.730]  And now he's come out and said that Donald Trump is like Gollum.
[00:28:55.730 --> 00:29:02.996]  We actually have a photo of Donald Trump, if he was to marry a Gollum-like creature, that the child it would produce.
[00:29:02.996 --> 00:29:04.197]  Can we put that up on screen, folks?
[00:29:06.101 --> 00:29:07.642]  And when you see it, there it is.
[00:29:07.642 --> 00:29:12.446]  You can actually back out, you can see that it has beautiful blonde hair.
[00:29:12.446 --> 00:29:14.728]  You can see that it actually resembles Rand Paul.
[00:29:14.728 --> 00:29:15.989]  I'm joking.
[00:29:15.989 --> 00:29:17.310]  It actually resembles Hillary Clinton.
[00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.612]  Have you seen the photo they have on Drudge of Hillary?
[00:29:19.612 --> 00:29:21.053]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:29:21.053 --> 00:29:23.155]  Actually, that is Hillary, actually.
[00:29:23.155 --> 00:29:24.516]  So I don't know why he's saying that.
[00:29:24.516 --> 00:29:26.637]  Look, look, look.
[00:29:26.637 --> 00:29:27.118]  I get it.
[00:29:27.118 --> 00:29:29.740]  Trump kind of goes, no one's more militaristic than me.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.420]  I'm going to be president.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.321]  I'm going to save you.
[00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:32.542]  My precious, my precious.
[00:29:34.298 --> 00:29:38.201]  But I mean, isn't that kind of the attitude you need to have to want to be El Presidente?
[00:29:38.201 --> 00:29:40.002]  Whatever.
[00:29:40.002 --> 00:29:41.464]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:41.464 --> 00:29:45.126]  Gollum on a white horse, riding in to save us.
[00:29:45.126 --> 00:29:47.368]  Infowars.com's got the image.
[00:29:47.368 --> 00:29:48.249]  We're going to tweet it out.
[00:29:48.249 --> 00:29:49.570]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.092]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.092 --> 00:29:54.774]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.835 --> 00:30:05.002]  In early January, the hermit nation of North Korea announced that it had successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb.
[00:30:05.002 --> 00:30:09.207]  This would make the fourth successful test that the isolated nation has claimed.
[00:30:09.207 --> 00:30:19.178]  Analysts at the time said this was Kim Jong-un in a display of saber-rattling to mark his birthday and to highlight a rare ruling party congress scheduled for May, the first gathering of its kind in 35 years.
[00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:22.821]  But just yesterday, Fox News reported that U.S.
[00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:28.805]  diplomats have stepped up pressure on China to play a leading role in punishing North Korea for its most recent test.
[00:30:28.805 --> 00:30:29.245]  The U.S.
[00:30:29.245 --> 00:30:31.887]  is also stepping up its military presence in that region.
[00:30:31.887 --> 00:30:39.272]  There are now two aircraft carriers stationed near Tokyo, the latest containing 26 fighter jets, including the F-22 stealth aircraft.
[00:30:39.272 --> 00:30:39.652]  The U.S.
[00:30:39.652 --> 00:30:42.574]  military has stated that this is for training purposes only.
[00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:49.659]  But as the economy goes into freefall, could these training exercises provoke the nation of North Korea into carrying out real attacks?
[00:30:50.299 --> 00:30:53.422]  Stay tuned to Infowars.com as more news breaks.
[00:30:53.422 --> 00:30:58.666]  Rob Dew reporting for the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:30:58.666 --> 00:31:03.310]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:08.054]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:31:08.054 --> 00:31:09.395]  Talk about the effects.
[00:31:09.395 --> 00:31:10.896]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:31:10.896 --> 00:31:12.838]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:31:12.838 --> 00:31:13.959]  I feel like I look better.
[00:31:13.959 --> 00:31:14.659]  I feel better.
[00:31:14.659 --> 00:31:15.760]  I feel sexier.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.441]  I love it.
[00:31:16.681 --> 00:31:19.642]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[00:31:23.663 --> 00:31:24.843]  Consult your physician.

[00:31:58.412 --> 00:32:04.774]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:32:05.228 --> 00:32:08.351]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:13.656]  I needed to get my digestive system working correctly again, so I stumbled on the X2.
[00:32:13.656 --> 00:32:14.677]  I needed a detox, basically.
[00:32:25.928 --> 00:32:27.029]  We're good to go.
[00:32:42.996 --> 00:32:46.839]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[00:32:46.839 --> 00:32:48.620]  I was, like, really more natural.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:53.704]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:32:53.704 --> 00:32:56.126]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:11.141 --> 00:33:13.922]  These boots are made for walking.
[00:33:34.188 --> 00:33:53.079]  I want to make a declaration here before I get into the Snowmageddon hitting the East Coast, before I get into Hillary denying an email hack, before I get into Alberta students who define their own gender, five big changes in new school guidelines.
[00:33:53.079 --> 00:33:56.261]  Where you don't learn reading, writing and arithmetic, you learn when you're five years old.
[00:33:57.321 --> 00:33:59.963]  That you choose what sex you are.
[00:33:59.963 --> 00:34:02.124]  You always thought you were a boy or girl.
[00:34:02.124 --> 00:34:09.570]  No, you've got weirdo pervert psychological warfare chiefs that are going to brain damage you and totally screw you up for life.
[00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:14.093]  So before we get to that, I mean, what business is the government?
[00:34:14.093 --> 00:34:16.815]  Well, this is how they screw up the species.
[00:34:16.815 --> 00:34:23.299]  Before we get into all of that, I wanted to raise something that's very, very important.
[00:34:23.299 --> 00:34:26.982]  And I'm not really complaining about this so much as I expected.
[00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:34.232]  And this is what we know has been going on for a long time.
[00:34:34.232 --> 00:34:40.514]  And so more and more, we're going to do reports here on how the manipulation is actually carried out.
[00:34:40.514 --> 00:34:49.878]  And investigative reports as well, including legally infiltrating these different groups that are doing this.
[00:34:51.147 --> 00:34:56.789]  And the reason we're able to do this is we have so many good people that actually work in the corporations and in the government.
[00:34:56.789 --> 00:34:58.829]  So they let us know what's going on.
[00:34:58.829 --> 00:35:02.350]  Now sometimes we get told about stuff before it happens.
[00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:09.872]  Sometimes we get told about it while it's happening or we get told about it after the fact.
[00:35:09.872 --> 00:35:15.434]  And we got contacted a month or so ago by one of the top
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.461]  There's a lot of programmers out there.
[00:35:18.461 --> 00:35:26.904]  And then we were also doing our own research and went out and got one of the top SEO people, you know, that deals with the search engines and the tags and all the rest of it.
[00:35:26.904 --> 00:35:29.645]  And they're like, yeah, why don't you care about this?
[00:35:29.645 --> 00:35:45.831]  I understand you have this mass attack format where you just put out tons of info and your listeners push it out to everybody and that it's an all-out war and you're overall winning, but almost all your top search images are things the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL and other groups run
[00:35:47.110 --> 00:36:03.804]  And they've got them on their puppet sites, and then they push that out, and then they push out even four or five-year-old hit piece articles in the news feeds of Google, which you're not supposed to do, and in the web searches with disinfo.
[00:36:05.484 --> 00:36:10.346]  And searches put out by white supremacists, you name it.
[00:36:10.346 --> 00:36:21.232]  They're running and orchestrating the whole attack, full spectrum, posing as the opposition, posing as the trolls, and operating as themselves.
[00:36:21.232 --> 00:36:27.715]  And if you go to the Alex Jones Wikipedia page, the admin on it is the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:36:34.116 --> 00:36:36.717]  And they actually... I mean, imagine that.
[00:36:36.717 --> 00:36:46.902]  My critics that lie about me and do all this stuff, they run Wikipedia, and then they don't tell the public that they're running my Wikipedia page, and by the way, countless others.
[00:36:46.902 --> 00:36:50.403]  They're like the dominant force on Wikipedia.
[00:36:50.403 --> 00:36:56.686]  This multinational front group that ran the Elohim City white supremacist compound that Oklahoma City came out of
[00:36:57.506 --> 00:37:01.909]  This organization that, quote, advises the police.
[00:37:01.909 --> 00:37:05.953]  The FBI stopped using them three years ago because they've been caught in so much behavior.
[00:37:05.953 --> 00:37:10.936]  But talk about Fox guarding the hen house.
[00:37:10.936 --> 00:37:22.725]  This is who is out there running the search engine ratings, gaming things, and doing things that our insiders say can only be done working directly with Google, Wikipedia, and others.
[00:37:22.725 --> 00:37:23.486]  They are given.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:35.142]  The power to distort in real time the image of Infowars.
[00:37:35.142 --> 00:37:40.864]  And we're tracking connections into the extremist groups and others that we know they have a long history of basically running.
[00:37:40.864 --> 00:37:42.864]  They claim they're infiltrating them, they run them.
[00:37:42.864 --> 00:37:50.526]  And that's why the white supremacist and the extremist groups and the schizophrenic wind-up toys and all the rest of them that they've got in their control.
[00:37:50.526 --> 00:37:53.967]  I mean, folks, I have to deal with feds sometimes.
[00:37:55.014 --> 00:38:08.738]  Where it's a known Fed, and I'm at an event, and they show up with two crazy people in camo going, you put a chip in my brain, I'm gonna get you, drooling, and the Fed's behind them laughing at me going, we're gonna get you, Jones.
[00:38:08.738 --> 00:38:10.799]  I mean, you wanna live in a science fiction movie, folks?
[00:38:10.799 --> 00:38:20.281]  I live in it, okay?
[00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:21.742]  You talk about evil.
[00:38:21.742 --> 00:38:22.422]  These people are it.
[00:38:26.138 --> 00:38:28.339]  So they don't even really use the CIA or the FBI.
[00:38:28.339 --> 00:38:30.379]  They use these foundations.
[00:38:30.379 --> 00:38:31.539]  And there's the Ford Foundation.
[00:38:31.539 --> 00:38:35.480]  There's a bunch of them.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:42.562]  And I've had, let's just say, people in law enforcement that are able to do legal and lawful checks on things look into these groups and they go, you're absolutely right.
[00:38:42.562 --> 00:38:44.222]  Yeah, this guy works for this major foundation.
[00:38:44.222 --> 00:38:44.642]  We checked it.
[00:38:44.642 --> 00:38:45.262]  How'd you know that?
[00:38:45.262 --> 00:38:47.003]  I said, well, I know it's not even the police.
[00:38:47.003 --> 00:38:47.763]  It's not even the military.
[00:38:48.643 --> 00:38:57.909]  I mean, when Clinton was in, I had to deal with the military, messing with me, special forces, and at a certain point they just said, we're not doing this, we're not harassing this guy, no, no.
[00:38:57.909 --> 00:39:06.755]  We're not surveilling him, we're not going to beat him up, and we're not going to follow him around, and we're not going to threaten him, and we're not going to call him at home, and we're not going to do it anymore.
[00:39:06.755 --> 00:39:08.956]  I haven't been messed with by the military since about 2000.
[00:39:08.956 --> 00:39:14.019]  So, who they have messing with me is these groups.
[00:39:14.019 --> 00:39:16.381]  And they're doing it all over the place, and people just need to know about it.
[00:39:18.226 --> 00:39:20.506]  And it's not fun.
[00:39:20.506 --> 00:39:23.247]  But it's what I've got to deal with.
[00:39:23.247 --> 00:39:26.128]  And man, that's why I can see the stuff that's going on.
[00:39:26.128 --> 00:39:27.548]  I can see the stuff out in Oregon.
[00:39:27.548 --> 00:39:29.508]  I can see when people are being handled.
[00:39:29.508 --> 00:39:32.009]  I can see, just spot it instantly.
[00:39:32.009 --> 00:39:37.890]  And they've always got homeless, mentally ill people that like to dress up in camo.
[00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:40.110]  And then that, you know, and believe they're like a top general.
[00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:44.631]  And then they'll sit there and then, you know, be told, Alex is a fed.
[00:39:44.631 --> 00:39:46.492]  Alex put a chip in you, Alex.
[00:39:46.492 --> 00:39:47.532]  It's just so sad.
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:55.124]  To realize that's who they've got working for them.
[00:39:55.124 --> 00:39:59.348]  But I'll say it's a lot better than the military messing with you.
[00:39:59.348 --> 00:40:00.910]  I mean, these people are basically like zombies.
[00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:03.192]  You just have to get out of their way or get around them.
[00:40:03.192 --> 00:40:06.735]  And they literally just like broken robot just kind of walk into the wall.
[00:40:06.735 --> 00:40:07.776]  They're so stupid.
[00:40:07.776 --> 00:40:16.063]  It's a wind-up toy.
[00:40:16.063 --> 00:40:16.444]  And so,
[00:40:19.261 --> 00:40:27.189]  You know, I told folks, I said, we'll do reports on how they run my Wikipedia and how they edit it and how they run other things and how they run extremist groups.
[00:40:27.189 --> 00:40:30.852]  We're going to counter them by exposing the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:40:30.852 --> 00:40:35.557]  We're not going to counter them going in and messing with the search results stuff.
[00:40:35.557 --> 00:40:37.139]  Look, the listeners
[00:40:38.729 --> 00:40:40.470]  They don't want this show going out.
[00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:42.792]  They don't want our videos and articles going out.
[00:40:42.792 --> 00:40:48.995]  They're doing everything they can to shut us down, to go after our sponsors, to harass us, to mess with us.
[00:40:48.995 --> 00:40:51.057]  All we do is get bigger and more successful.
[00:40:51.057 --> 00:40:52.678]  God just opens more doors.
[00:40:52.678 --> 00:40:54.679]  Providence just rains on us.
[00:40:54.679 --> 00:40:57.641]  And so everything's in God's hands, but I'm telling you.
[00:40:58.888 --> 00:41:02.791]  You're in a fight beside us and with us in this.
[00:41:02.791 --> 00:41:25.869]  When you spread our links and our videos on Craigslist and Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and Pinterest and Instagram and every other system, you are toe-to-toe up against the sock puppets, the megaphones is what they call them, these programs where a person's typing it but they can put in comments and you don't have it published to 50 websites at a time.
[00:41:27.605 --> 00:41:30.247]  Or they could post us 10 different people instantaneously.
[00:41:30.247 --> 00:41:31.208]  Stuff like that.
[00:41:31.208 --> 00:41:41.755]  And they just spew racism and infighting and mindlessness from all sides just to get us all fighting with each other and to create a fog of confusion.
[00:41:41.755 --> 00:41:43.757]  But people are seeing through it.
[00:41:43.757 --> 00:41:47.079]  And that's the animating contest of liberty.
[00:41:47.079 --> 00:41:51.603]  And misrepresenting what I say and all sorts of dirty tricks.
[00:41:51.603 --> 00:41:53.324]  It just doesn't work anymore.
[00:41:56.158 --> 00:42:05.492]  Because my mission is to expose the globalist operation and to get people talking and thinking about it and being alerted to it.
[00:42:05.492 --> 00:42:08.977]  My mission is not even to save Alex Jones.
[00:42:08.977 --> 00:42:12.462]  And the system has figured that out to a certain extent.
[00:42:13.848 --> 00:42:19.090]  That they can assassinate my character all day, they can make up whatever they want, they can twist whatever they want.
[00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:26.473]  The microcosm of what InfoWars does is a model for everyone else to learn from.
[00:42:26.473 --> 00:42:34.255]  From our mistakes, from our successes.
[00:42:34.255 --> 00:42:35.656]  It's a very interesting time to be alive.
[00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:41.032]  Well, we got a bunch of guests coming up, I need to start getting back into the news.
[00:42:41.032 --> 00:42:53.094]  It's just that, you know, when I see National Review attack Donald Trump, in their entire issue, and say he's not qualified to even be able to run, well, that, no, no, no.
[00:42:53.094 --> 00:42:57.895]  Anyone that says that they should be able to qualify who can run and who can't is bad news.
[00:42:57.895 --> 00:42:59.415]  That's what Obama has been saying.
[00:42:59.415 --> 00:43:04.996]  And you really listen to the talking points of National Review more and more, and of a lot of these people that signed on to this,
[00:43:09.395 --> 00:43:13.421]  You understand that it's Southern Poverty Law Center garbage.
[00:43:13.421 --> 00:43:15.384]  Everybody's so lazy they just cut and paste.
[00:43:15.384 --> 00:43:21.514]  If you read their five or six articles attacking yours truly, in the last few years,
[00:43:23.675 --> 00:43:26.736]  It's Alex Jones warns of a world government takeover.
[00:43:26.736 --> 00:43:30.457]  Alex Jones warns that they're militarizing police and giving them armored vehicles.
[00:43:30.457 --> 00:43:32.518]  Alex Jones is anti-police.
[00:43:32.518 --> 00:43:34.478]  I'm not anti-police.
[00:43:34.478 --> 00:43:40.200]  I don't want them run by the globalists, given armored vehicles to quote fight the veterans and the constitutionalists.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.921]  And the cops are awake, on average, and have listened.
[00:43:43.921 --> 00:43:45.201]  They didn't have to listen to me.
[00:43:45.201 --> 00:43:46.542]  They could already see what was going on.
[00:43:48.462 --> 00:43:58.485]  So in many respects it's game over for the globalists if we just understand how much success we're having, how much success you're having.
[00:43:58.485 --> 00:44:07.327]  But I read these articles and I mean it is just absolutely out of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:44:07.327 --> 00:44:07.547]  It is.
[00:44:11.565 --> 00:44:13.126]  Against Trump, the editors.
[00:44:13.126 --> 00:44:14.627]  Oh my gosh, they have such authority.
[00:44:14.627 --> 00:44:15.788]  They tell us how to think.
[00:44:15.788 --> 00:44:16.769]  They tell us what to do.
[00:44:16.769 --> 00:44:30.840]  And it'd be one thing if this group had delivered us out of tyranny before and had stopped the RINOs and stopped the neocons and hadn't been cheerleaders for all the NSA spying and torture and open borders and gun control and everything else we've gotten with the Republicans and the Democrats.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.183]  But this, this is the group that never lets us win.
[00:44:34.183 --> 00:44:35.964]  This is the group that hamstrings us.
[00:44:35.964 --> 00:44:41.008]  This is the group telling us they control reality and that they are the intellectual high priest
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:48.962]  When almost every one of them is a Judas goat.
[00:44:48.962 --> 00:44:53.285]  Leading us to the slaughter.
[00:44:53.285 --> 00:44:55.986]  And speaking of that, let's look at a Drudge Super Poll.
[00:44:55.986 --> 00:44:58.307]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:44:58.307 --> 00:45:01.509]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com, obviously.
[00:45:01.509 --> 00:45:02.750]  And we're going to do one of our own polls.
[00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.831]  I think we should do one of these.
[00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:07.092]  Some of our polls get about 200,000 voters.
[00:45:07.092 --> 00:45:09.714]  Our biggest one, this one, has over a million plus
[00:45:12.165 --> 00:45:18.447]  And notice Hillary came in last at 0.88.
[00:45:18.447 --> 00:45:19.848]  You say, oh, this is unscientific.
[00:45:19.848 --> 00:45:21.288]  Well, it's a total free-for-all.
[00:45:21.288 --> 00:45:22.229]  Anybody can go in there.
[00:45:22.229 --> 00:45:24.430]  It's open to the world.
[00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.891]  The left visits drudge as much as conservatives do.
[00:45:26.891 --> 00:45:29.652]  Trump, 36.05.
[00:45:29.652 --> 00:45:35.334]  Notice, you'd say, oh, it's just a conservative poll if next was Cruz and then Rubio or Paul.
[00:45:35.334 --> 00:45:36.194]  No.
[00:45:36.194 --> 00:45:36.474]  Trump's 36.05.
[00:45:39.159 --> 00:45:40.059]  That's 413,000 plus votes.
[00:45:40.059 --> 00:45:40.419]  Sanders, ugh.
[00:45:40.419 --> 00:45:41.020]  29.69, 340 plus thousand.
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:42.320]  Cruz, 19.23, 220 plus thousand.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.680]  Rubio, 4.92, 56,000.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:43.980]  Paul, 3.23, 37,000.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:44.621]  Carson, 1.4, 16,000.
[00:45:44.621 --> 00:45:44.961]  Kasich, 1.3, 15,000.
[00:45:44.961 --> 00:45:45.621]  The Packard Bell lady.
[00:46:10.702 --> 00:46:16.224]  You think the folks are sick of the establishment?
[00:46:16.224 --> 00:46:16.945]  Bush and Clinton.
[00:46:16.945 --> 00:46:18.145]  This poll tells you everything.
[00:46:18.145 --> 00:46:19.646]  In fact, we need an article about this.
[00:46:19.646 --> 00:46:24.127]  Drudge Poll Shows People in Populist Revolt.
[00:46:24.127 --> 00:46:34.331]  And then put that interview up with the shadow head of the Trump campaign, Steele Stone, Robert Stone, a few weeks ago.
[00:46:34.331 --> 00:46:35.632]  Roger Stone.
[00:46:35.632 --> 00:46:36.532]  Teleprompt for you folks.
[00:46:37.887 --> 00:46:42.690]  And put that up on screen where he says Trump represents a populist uprising.
[00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:46.573]  That's what Roger Stone talked about.
[00:46:46.573 --> 00:46:58.162]  So, Bush and Clinton Bush and Clinton have less than 1% of the vote combined in National Poll.
[00:46:58.162 --> 00:47:00.363]  Establishment Bush and Clinton have less than 1%
[00:47:02.296 --> 00:47:04.057]  In a national poll.
[00:47:04.057 --> 00:47:06.758]  What does that tell you, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:47:06.758 --> 00:47:13.821]  And by the way, Bush is polling in national polls between 2 and 7 percent.
[00:47:13.821 --> 00:47:22.565]  And in different polls in different states, 3 to 8 percent.
[00:47:22.565 --> 00:47:26.446]  So, you think about that.
[00:47:26.446 --> 00:47:27.627]  Santorum is 0.2 percent.
[00:47:32.443 --> 00:47:34.745]  Think about that.
[00:47:34.745 --> 00:47:36.526]  Think about that long and hard.
[00:47:36.526 --> 00:47:38.988]  And that's what we're seeing from the public.
[00:47:38.988 --> 00:47:42.311]  So what does National Review do?
[00:47:42.311 --> 00:47:50.517]  They go and they sign on against Trump, claiming they don't trust him.
[00:47:50.517 --> 00:47:54.500]  Well, we know what we're going to get with Hillary Clinton.
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.262]  We know what we're going to get.
[00:47:58.891 --> 00:48:08.558]  With George Herbert Walker Bush's son, the retread, Jeb Bush.
[00:48:08.558 --> 00:48:12.280]  More of the same.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:25.309]  So I'm done talking about that for now, but it is truly disgusting to see this, and that's why the RNC has disinvited National Review as a debate partner from the next Republican-sponsored debate.
[00:48:29.551 --> 00:48:31.011]  They said, we expected this was coming.
[00:48:31.011 --> 00:48:36.392]  Small price to pay for speaking the truth to the Donald.
[00:48:36.392 --> 00:48:49.235]  Jack Fowler, publisher of National Review, outlined the RNC's rationale in a piece published on the magazine's website.
[00:48:49.235 --> 00:48:53.536]  And if they had their way, we would have Jeb Bush, or we would have Kasich, or something like that.
[00:48:53.536 --> 00:48:54.556]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:48:54.556 --> 00:48:55.316]  More of the same.
[00:48:56.121 --> 00:49:00.102]  We're going to go to break, come back on Snowmageddon, now hitting their thing.
[00:49:00.102 --> 00:49:01.523]  Shelter in place.
[00:49:01.523 --> 00:49:08.325]  We're going to get into the latest article on Infowars.com and video, Davos Insider, World Economy Doomed, Central Bank's Out of Ammo.
[00:49:08.325 --> 00:49:09.305]  This is all planned.
[00:49:09.305 --> 00:49:10.485]  We're going to get into that.
[00:49:10.485 --> 00:49:20.789]  We're going to get into the latest in the Middle East, the latest on the refugees, the latest on the Islamists, a bunch of police being sentenced for raping women, shooting people in the back.
[00:49:20.789 --> 00:49:24.170]  So, all I'm seeing is convictions constantly about cops.
[00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.690]  That's a good thing.
[00:49:25.731 --> 00:49:28.754]  The police are cleaning house in many areas, and they need to.
[00:49:28.754 --> 00:49:34.999]  Because if you don't, you won't let the globalists basically take over the local governments and enslave everybody.
[00:49:34.999 --> 00:49:43.346]  The most patriotic thing the police can do is resist the globalists' takeover, politically, and resist the urge to act like thugs, as the feds have trained you to do.
[00:49:45.063 --> 00:49:48.365]  Before we go to break, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for your support.

[00:51:58.374 --> 00:52:02.617]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:52:02.617 --> 00:52:03.257]  It's true.
[00:52:03.257 --> 00:52:07.400]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.802]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:52:09.802 --> 00:52:14.265]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:52:14.585 --> 00:52:27.451]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[00:53:27.884 --> 00:53:30.945]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:53:30.945 --> 00:53:33.546]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:53:33.546 --> 00:53:34.306]  Croix River.
[00:53:34.306 --> 00:53:36.547]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:53:36.547 --> 00:53:39.508]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:53:39.508 --> 00:53:40.388]  His excuse?
[00:53:40.388 --> 00:53:41.729]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:53:41.729 --> 00:53:43.329]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:53:43.329 --> 00:53:49.091]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:54:07.625 --> 00:54:08.165]  Stay in attack formation.
[00:54:08.165 --> 00:54:12.266]  You know, I said I'd get into Planet X. They discovered it.
[00:54:12.266 --> 00:54:16.126]  Ten times bigger than Earth, the size of Neptune, a gas giant.
[00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:40.515]  With a 20,000 year orbit, exactly what a bunch of the ancients said.
[00:54:40.515 --> 00:54:44.239]  They said when it comes back through, it causes massive catastrophes.
[00:54:44.239 --> 00:54:45.521]  Volcanoes, you name it.
[00:54:45.521 --> 00:54:48.465]  By the way, Kit gave me a whole stack of articles about record volcanoes.
[00:54:48.465 --> 00:54:49.266]  I laid it somewhere.
[00:54:49.266 --> 00:54:52.470]  I think in there by the coffee pot.
[00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:54.933]  But I'm going to have to actually get to that.
[00:54:57.321 --> 00:55:01.944]  Halfway into the hour with Michael Schneider from the Economic Collapse blog, and get his take on it.
[00:55:01.944 --> 00:55:03.485]  And here's the deal, folks.
[00:55:03.485 --> 00:55:24.520]  I don't want to say I'm eating my hat on this, but I've been very, very critical of the perennial books that have been coming out since the mid-90s about Planet X is coming, it's a gas giant, 20,000 year elliptical orbit, you know, the Babylonians talked about it, the Zoolasters, the Mayans.
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.261]  I never said that I didn't think
[00:55:28.624 --> 00:55:35.110]  That there aren't a whole bunch of planets out there, they've proven there's hundreds of them, that are out in the Kuiper Belt past Pluto.
[00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:37.893]  That's why they delisted it, as I said earlier.
[00:55:37.893 --> 00:55:46.802]  What I was getting at is constantly saying it's coming next year, and constantly saying it's the end of the world, and the movie 2012, and then I get blamed for it!
[00:55:47.816 --> 00:55:58.241]  I mean, there's so many news articles going, Alex Jones is the one that said we didn't go to the moon, and that aliens run everything, and that the Himalayas are going to be, you know, at sea level.
[00:55:58.241 --> 00:56:04.224]  Hey Alex, 2012 didn't kill everybody!
[00:56:04.224 --> 00:56:06.385]  And so it just gets old.
[00:56:06.385 --> 00:56:17.331]  But it does show how the ancients were certainly right about big planets that come through, and there are big disasters, and there are big asteroids that hit the Earth, and there are big Earth changes, and the elite shouldn't be the focus of everything.
[00:56:19.127 --> 00:56:20.887]  They're all busy.
[00:56:20.887 --> 00:56:28.149]  I saw another headline last week going, Alex Jones says the elite want off-world colonies to escape Earth.
[00:56:28.149 --> 00:56:34.031]  I was quoting top elitist on their way to Davos saying that was going to be up for discussion.
[00:56:34.031 --> 00:56:35.711]  It was mainstream news.
[00:56:35.711 --> 00:56:37.312]  So even when there's mainstream news that
[00:56:38.032 --> 00:56:47.185]  You know, Thiel and all these other folks and, you know, the Tesla owner and all the rest of it are saying we need a Mars colony for the elite.
[00:56:47.185 --> 00:56:51.050]  I cover what they say and then they go, Alex is crazy and made this up.
[00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:52.612]  So see, that's how they operate.
[00:56:52.612 --> 00:56:53.273]  They think you're stupid.
[00:56:54.974 --> 00:57:02.900]  But, I tell you, uncanny that the ancients said 20,000 years, bigger than the Earth, and all the rest of it, and here it is.
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:04.521]  The question is, we're trying to look at its orbit.
[00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:06.403]  I mean, is it even scheduled?
[00:57:06.403 --> 00:57:07.744]  I guess it's coming in closer.
[00:57:07.744 --> 00:57:08.324]  That's what they're saying.
[00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:10.686]  That's how they're able to see it now.
[00:57:10.686 --> 00:57:14.829]  It's coming in from this orbit.
[00:57:14.829 --> 00:57:16.991]  What is it they're saying?
[00:57:16.991 --> 00:57:20.393]  Many, many, many times further out from Pluto.
[00:57:20.393 --> 00:57:23.336]  I'm going to go over that coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:57:24.343 --> 00:57:25.764]  And then here are those articles.
[00:57:25.764 --> 00:57:27.005]  Mass evacuation alert.
[00:57:27.005 --> 00:57:30.607]  One of the world's most dangerous volcanoes threatens to blow.
[00:57:30.607 --> 00:57:31.367]  We'll be getting to that.
[00:57:31.367 --> 00:57:32.648]  Mexico City.
[00:57:32.648 --> 00:57:35.910]  Mexico City, of course, has 40 million people on it or something.
[00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:36.930]  Monster eruptions.
[00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:40.612]  Panic as two volcanoes explode, causing mass evacuation.
[00:57:40.612 --> 00:57:43.354]  That's in Indonesia.
[00:57:43.354 --> 00:57:48.717]  Pretty simple article going, Jones claims there's something called volcanoes that shoot lava and ash out.
[00:57:53.604 --> 00:58:02.711]  And he claims Obamacare isn't free.
[00:58:02.711 --> 00:58:05.313]  And Hillary claims she didn't have any emails that were secret.
[00:58:05.313 --> 00:58:06.594]  Oh, that's another lie!
[00:58:06.594 --> 00:58:10.497]  And El Chapo's got a 50 Cal the government gave him to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:58:10.497 --> 00:58:11.758]  But that's okay!
[00:58:11.758 --> 00:58:14.120]  Everything's fine!
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.761]  Did you take your vaccines today?
[00:58:15.761 --> 00:58:16.942]  Did you drink your fluoride?
[00:58:16.942 --> 00:58:18.643]  Because the government loves you and cares about you.
[00:58:19.966 --> 00:58:21.027]  They want to shut us down.
[00:58:21.027 --> 00:58:22.448]  They want to shut us up.
[00:58:22.448 --> 00:58:26.232]  Spread the word about InfoWars.com, the free podcast, the free videos, all of it.
[00:58:26.232 --> 00:58:28.373]  It's weaponized media.
[00:58:28.373 --> 00:58:30.235]  Hillary admits they're losing the InfoWars.
[00:58:30.235 --> 00:58:31.556]  We are InfoWars.
[00:58:31.556 --> 00:58:32.777]  We're coming for them.
[00:58:32.777 --> 00:58:34.259]  We're committed.
[00:58:34.259 --> 00:58:35.340]  We need your help.

[00:58:38.703 --> 00:58:39.563]  They're awesome.

[00:58:40.764 --> 00:58:46.109]  And they fund vicious, savage, committed maniacs.
[00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:46.930]  We're going in!
[00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:53.119]  Use since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:58:53.119 --> 00:58:57.281]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[00:59:18.547 --> 00:59:19.648]  BrainForce is here.
[00:59:19.648 --> 00:59:21.869]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:59:21.869 --> 00:59:26.872]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:59:26.872 --> 00:59:30.155]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:59:30.155 --> 00:59:33.637]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:59:33.637 --> 00:59:35.618]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:59:35.618 --> 00:59:39.721]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[00:59:39.721 --> 00:59:45.304]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:53.802]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:08.041 --> 01:00:16.103]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.103 --> 01:00:19.464]  It's high noon.
[01:00:19.464 --> 01:00:21.584]  Hot and green at cement times.
[01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:23.965]  Out in Austin, Texas.
[01:00:23.965 --> 01:00:27.626]  The battle of the gods is upon us.
[01:00:27.626 --> 01:00:28.626]  Promethean fire.
[01:00:37.131 --> 01:00:40.953]  He is ours.
[01:00:40.953 --> 01:01:01.363]  The technocrats want to keep that fire to themselves and build a stairway to heaven while damning us to this planet and the wreckage from the wars and the sins and the waste.
[01:01:01.363 --> 01:01:03.924]  They will never transcend their evil.
[01:01:06.846 --> 01:01:12.807]  They will never rise above their nature.
[01:01:12.807 --> 01:01:24.569]  And in their attempt to bring down humanity, they will only serve their purpose to make the righteous strong.
[01:01:24.569 --> 01:01:27.990]  I don't claim to be righteous.
[01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:32.970]  I don't claim to be the good man.
[01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:35.951]  I don't claim to be pure as the driven snow.
[01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:43.380]  But I do have my heart pointed towards justice and God.
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:48.962]  And I don't want to see my fellow humans fallen.
[01:01:48.962 --> 01:01:52.803]  And it takes all kinds to fight this war.
[01:01:52.803 --> 01:02:03.607]  So stop thinking you've got to be the most well-spoken, the best-looking, the perfect person for the fight, the perfect plan, the perfect idea that people spend money on and time and energy.
[01:02:03.607 --> 01:02:04.828]  I see the same syndrome.
[01:02:06.547 --> 01:02:19.759]  And then it doesn't bear fruit because all you do is keep planning and keep scheming and keep thinking about how you're going to write a book or how you're going to do a newsletter or how you're going to do a local radio show or how you're going to run for office or how you're going to start speaking out.
[01:02:19.759 --> 01:02:23.182]  You want to do something, start speaking out at the grocery store line.
[01:02:23.182 --> 01:02:26.866]  Just say, man, I sure wish my kids could have some of this gum.
[01:02:26.866 --> 01:02:29.748]  They're asking it right now.
[01:02:29.748 --> 01:02:32.271]  They don't do that anymore because they know they'll get a speech.
[01:02:33.405 --> 01:02:40.330]  Oh, we're in the grocery store line, we're in the Target line, we're in the gas station line, and there's seven people in line in front of us.
[01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:42.171]  My kids start saying, can we have some of this bubble gum?
[01:02:42.171 --> 01:02:47.135]  And I'll say, went back there, four or five, I'd say, read on the back, does it say aspartame?
[01:02:47.135 --> 01:02:49.156]  They go, oh, daddy, they all do.
[01:02:49.156 --> 01:02:50.477]  Yeah, what alcohol?
[01:02:50.477 --> 01:02:52.739]  And then adults will kind of laugh, sometimes nicely.
[01:02:52.739 --> 01:02:54.680]  Some say, oh, hey, Alex, yeah, I'm awake.
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:56.742]  Yeah, too bad you can't find any gum that doesn't say aspartame.
[01:02:59.181 --> 01:03:02.364]  Other times they'll go, oh, let your kid have some gum, man, what do you think?
[01:03:02.364 --> 01:03:04.766]  I'm like, hey, that's what alcohol, folks.
[01:03:04.766 --> 01:03:12.512]  I'm not going to give my kid something that's designed to be an excitotoxin that's addictive so they'll eat the whole package of gum, chew it in an hour, and then want more.
[01:03:12.512 --> 01:03:21.580]  And the stuff that's in fast food, the toxins, the things they put there on purpose to make you feel sick an hour later and be hungry and make you get fat.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.781]  You say, well, how does just exposing aspartame save the world?
[01:03:23.781 --> 01:03:24.302]  I didn't say that.
[01:03:26.277 --> 01:03:29.838]  Ma'am, I see you've got nursery water here that says fluoride in it.
[01:03:29.838 --> 01:03:32.138]  Let me pull up on my phone right now for you.
[01:03:32.138 --> 01:03:34.399]  Listen, I'm not saying this to be obnoxious or get in your business.
[01:03:34.399 --> 01:03:36.019]  I care about you and your family.
[01:03:36.019 --> 01:03:37.939]  I want you to just pull up.
[01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:42.280]  The American Medical Association says children shouldn't even have fluoridated water until age five.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.081]  It causes dental fluorosis.
[01:03:45.081 --> 01:03:46.121]  Really?
[01:03:46.121 --> 01:03:46.961]  I just said nursery.
[01:03:46.961 --> 01:03:48.001]  I thought it'd be better.
[01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:49.042]  No, no, let me show.
[01:03:49.042 --> 01:03:50.662]  Wow, I see that.
[01:03:50.662 --> 01:03:51.062]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:03:53.598 --> 01:03:55.880]  And the clerk starts getting mad.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:57.401]  You know what, ma'am?
[01:03:57.401 --> 01:03:57.981]  You know what?
[01:03:57.981 --> 01:04:00.823]  You're ahead of me.
[01:04:00.823 --> 01:04:03.164]  Let me just run over here and get you the regular water.
[01:04:03.164 --> 01:04:05.866]  I've done that.
[01:04:05.866 --> 01:04:07.968]  I've done it probably three or four times.
[01:04:07.968 --> 01:04:09.689]  I've seen them with that water.
[01:04:09.689 --> 01:04:16.994]  I mean, I'm dead inside if I don't warn people.
[01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:25.138]  That is a chemical attack on record to literally eat holes in your children's brains.
[01:04:25.138 --> 01:04:31.122]  And I'm supposed to just sit here and watch them put bug poison in your water and not do anything?
[01:04:31.122 --> 01:04:35.345]  What type of whacked-out scum would I be if I just didn't care?
[01:04:36.223 --> 01:04:37.344]  That's what I'm supposed to do, though.
[01:04:37.344 --> 01:04:44.430]  Because, see, I'm about two degrees away from being one of these globalists in that I know what they know, most of them know what they know, but enjoy it.
[01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:51.056]  They enjoy seeing a woman in line with poison water, or they're so rich, all their water's delivered, they don't go in stores.
[01:04:51.056 --> 01:04:51.557]  You see?
[01:04:51.557 --> 01:04:57.322]  They enjoy going through an airport and seeing the dead and dying, mutated, shuffling around that they've murdered.
[01:04:58.669 --> 01:05:10.392]  Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton denied reports that her private email server had been hacked after being confronted by an InfoWars correspondent at a campaign stop in Iowa.
[01:05:10.392 --> 01:05:18.213]  Secretary Clinton, last week it was reported on InfoWars.com that your email server was hacked and you knowingly continued to use your email server.
[01:05:18.213 --> 01:05:19.534]  Can you comment on that?
[01:05:19.534 --> 01:05:20.414]  Yeah, it's totally untrue.
[01:05:20.694 --> 01:05:38.068]  The question stems from an exclusive InfoWars interview earlier this month in which former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino reported that Hillary continued using her private email to discuss classified information while knowing that her server had been compromised.
[01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:41.390]  The Clintons knew it was hacked and she did it anyway.
[01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:47.314]  And not only is she not currently indicted or in prison, she's running to be President of the United States.
[01:05:47.314 --> 01:05:53.359]  If this is not a red flag to every Paul Revere out there that something's wrong, then you know what?
[01:05:53.359 --> 01:05:54.399]  The country is lost.
[01:05:54.399 --> 01:05:57.081]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com

[01:08:01.525 --> 01:08:08.151]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:16.658]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.658 --> 01:08:25.706]  Well, in this hour, we're going to cover the unsustainability of global civilization by design.
[01:08:26.764 --> 01:08:38.297]  Everybody hears constantly from mainstream controlled media that we're unsustainable, humans are ugly, humans are bad, humans can't innovate, you can't have air conditioning, you can't have cars, everybody's gonna die, we'd be better off without humans.
[01:08:38.297 --> 01:08:43.323]  You know, I saw that in the white papers and government documents 25 years ago, 20 years ago on air covering it.
[01:08:43.323 --> 01:08:44.644]  Now it's just been mainstreamed.
[01:08:45.425 --> 01:09:02.252]  As they create artificial derivatives, as they give themselves trillions of dollars and then give us the debt, as they do everything they can to shut down industries and companies and new clean burning systems by controlling the whole green movement, they make sure that we only get boondoggles.
[01:09:02.252 --> 01:09:11.836]  It is a post-industrial world where the elite transfer the technologies, the power, the systems to themselves and don't transfer the innovations to the people.
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:29.593]  Now I know for a fact that major world leaders listen to this show and major folks that affect policy and have major pull in the media like Matt Drudge listens every day and Louis Farrakhan every day.
[01:09:29.593 --> 01:09:38.922]  I'm not comparing those two, but just look at how divergent at some points they are, but also how close.
[01:09:38.922 --> 01:09:40.063]  Vladimir Putin listens.
[01:09:41.032 --> 01:09:53.021]  I mean, years ago, we've had former heads of the Pakistan and secret intelligence operatives, General Hamid Gul and the head of the German CIA and, you know, the number two in the Japanese government comes on.
[01:09:53.021 --> 01:09:58.825]  The point is, we've hit the zeitgeist talking to very high-powered people.
[01:09:58.825 --> 01:10:04.629]  And Right Wing Watch put it out last week.
[01:10:04.629 --> 01:10:07.712]  The reason I mention this is to show you how they're disinfo operatives.
[01:10:09.079 --> 01:10:17.086]  And then it got picked up by a bunch of magazines and newspapers, quote, my critics just want a spot in the global elite's off-world colonies.
[01:10:17.086 --> 01:10:22.990]  Now that's actually two quotes in a long breakdown to make it sound insane.
[01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:35.781]  But what I was quoting was Elon Musk in the news saying we need a Mars colony for the elite to escape to, we need ring cities that are based on Werner Von Braun designs and others which have gravity, which is what you see in the movie Elysium.
[01:10:35.781 --> 01:10:36.722]  That's a real design.
[01:10:38.991 --> 01:10:45.515]  There's the Elite Daily, a ticket to Elon Musk's colony on Mars costs 500k.
[01:10:45.515 --> 01:10:57.982]  So see what happens is, I cover news, I cover CNN, 9th planet found, is it planet X, the rumored 10th planet, 10 times bigger than Earth.
[01:10:57.982 --> 01:11:03.205]  They'll probably have articles saying Alex Jones says, you know, that space aliens are coming to get us, you know, planet 10.
[01:11:03.205 --> 01:11:06.487]  Same deal where they say that I say that there's Martians under the UN building.
[01:11:06.487 --> 01:11:07.607]  I never said that.
[01:11:07.607 --> 01:11:08.608]  I don't cover space aliens.
[01:11:11.621 --> 01:11:14.363]  So see, this is how they engage in disinfo.
[01:11:14.363 --> 01:11:21.729]  And I know everybody understands this, but you really need to really get the word out about how shameful these people are and how they're preying on their audiences.
[01:11:21.729 --> 01:11:30.735]  But just during the break, Tim Fruge said, oh, I remember seeing Stephen Hawking just say this yesterday.
[01:11:30.735 --> 01:11:31.576]  Stephen Hawking.
[01:11:31.576 --> 01:11:32.276]  I didn't see this.
[01:11:32.276 --> 01:11:38.561]  Humanity is going to use science and technology to wipe itself out, Professor warns.
[01:11:38.561 --> 01:11:41.063]  Says global elite are destroying the planet.
[01:11:43.123 --> 01:11:43.503]  I think?
[01:12:06.727 --> 01:12:08.392]  Again, misrepresent this.
[01:12:08.392 --> 01:12:13.006]  They don't want to have a debate about what's going on and to get where I was going and then go to our guest setting this up.
[01:12:14.557 --> 01:12:17.278]  This is what the elite are talking about.
[01:12:17.278 --> 01:12:19.820]  This is what they've been talking about for 50 years.
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:22.061]  It's the plan to control the future.
[01:12:22.061 --> 01:12:24.522]  We are not in that future plan.
[01:12:24.522 --> 01:12:39.609]  The economic collapse you're seeing be engineered is to get us under their full economic, political, and military control, to dictate to us like Native Americans on a reservation to a company store with diseased blankets and beef full of maggots.
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:44.060]  That's the system.
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:53.886]  They get the tax money to then administer us on the plantation, us on the reservation, neo-feudalism in their own words.
[01:12:53.886 --> 01:12:58.429]  I coined the term neo-feudalistic fascism 17, 18 years ago.
[01:12:58.429 --> 01:13:05.873]  It is now used in universities by them to describe what they are building.
[01:13:05.873 --> 01:13:09.175]  What's crazy is we put names of their tyranny, they even adopt it.
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:13.445]  At Davos two years ago they said, we're technocrats, we are bringing in tyranny.
[01:13:13.445 --> 01:13:22.817]  They had the Financial Times of London's editor come out and say, and now for world government, and say, we are tyrannical, we are taking over.
[01:13:22.817 --> 01:13:23.318]  We know best.
[01:13:25.370 --> 01:13:36.677]  Then they have the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL and all their groups that they put the talking points out for, White House-run media matters, CNN, come out and say there is no world government and Alex Jones is deeply racist with no proof.
[01:13:36.677 --> 01:13:47.884]  And I'm not talking about myself here all day, but I never meant to be gonzo journalism, but we are because if they can shoot down Matt Drudge, Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, and a few others, they can take everybody else down.
[01:13:47.884 --> 01:13:49.906]  And I don't agree with some of the things Rush Limbaugh says.
[01:13:50.816 --> 01:13:53.298]  He's more of a kind of establishment Republican, or at least has been.
[01:13:53.298 --> 01:13:56.660]  But now he sounds more like I do, because his audience has taken him there.
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:57.781]  Or maybe he's grown.
[01:13:57.781 --> 01:14:11.030]  The point is, they want to shut him down, they want to boycott him, they want to arrest him, they want to set him up, they follow him around, they harass him on record, because if they can bring down that big lead elephant, they can bring down all the rest.
[01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:13.531]  And now I am a lead elephant.
[01:14:13.531 --> 01:14:18.134]  And let me tell you, it is very invigorating at certain points, but not at others.
[01:14:18.134 --> 01:14:18.735]  But let me tell you,
[01:14:19.395 --> 01:14:25.320]  It'll get your head screwed on really straight when you realize how hardcore all this is.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.642]  But all hell is breaking loose.
[01:14:27.642 --> 01:14:28.443]  Banking cartel.
[01:14:28.443 --> 01:14:33.947]  JPMorgan CEO gets 35% pay raise to $27 million amid cutbacks.
[01:14:33.947 --> 01:14:34.868]  Davos Insider.
[01:14:34.868 --> 01:14:36.109]  World economy doomed.
[01:14:36.109 --> 01:14:37.310]  Central banks out of ammo.
[01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:42.715]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:14:42.715 --> 01:14:46.558]  Meanwhile, I think Hollywood... We know they're involved in psychological warfare 24-7.
[01:14:48.168 --> 01:14:53.852]  But I think they're not nominating any black directors or actors, because there are people that deserve it.
[01:14:53.852 --> 01:14:56.534]  Undoubtedly, something's going on here.
[01:14:56.534 --> 01:15:03.138]  They're not nominating it on purpose to create, again, more of a racial divide in this country.
[01:15:03.138 --> 01:15:04.739]  That's all they do 24-7.
[01:15:04.739 --> 01:15:05.780]  That's their job.
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:11.183]  Oscar winner producer denounces spoiled brats crying racism.
[01:15:11.183 --> 01:15:12.584]  And it is a bunch of spoiled brats.
[01:15:12.584 --> 01:15:13.865]  Go do your own thing.
[01:15:13.865 --> 01:15:14.585]  I mean, you know what?
[01:15:14.585 --> 01:15:15.286]  Leave Hollywood.
[01:15:16.815 --> 01:15:17.475]  I've done that.
[01:15:17.475 --> 01:15:22.759]  I never went to Hollywood.
[01:15:22.759 --> 01:15:28.682]  And now because we didn't let them dictate the culture to us, we dictate the culture to them.
[01:15:28.682 --> 01:15:31.804]  And I'm not going to go into a long example of that.
[01:15:31.804 --> 01:15:32.545]  There's plenty of them.
[01:15:35.302 --> 01:15:37.644]  Going to Michael Schneider, I really appreciate his work.
[01:15:37.644 --> 01:15:42.469]  He posts his articles almost every day at InfoWars.com, EconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[01:15:42.469 --> 01:15:44.511]  Michael Schneider is the creator of the site.
[01:15:44.511 --> 01:15:48.816]  He just does a great job doing the research, linking all the facts.
[01:15:48.816 --> 01:15:52.759]  He believes a coming economic collapse is going to unfold over the next few years.
[01:15:52.759 --> 01:15:55.963]  He also writes for the endoftheamericandream.com and The Truth.
[01:15:57.691 --> 01:16:02.156]  And we're just going to go ahead and go to him right now to break all this down.
[01:16:02.156 --> 01:16:08.403]  He's the author of two books, The Beginning of the End and Get Prepared Now, available on Amazon and paperback and Kindle.
[01:16:08.403 --> 01:16:09.444]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:16:09.444 --> 01:16:13.909]  That's a little six, seven minute intro with some of the craziness going on here.
[01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:17.092]  Russian intelligence chiefs getting killed.
[01:16:17.092 --> 01:16:20.355]  I mean, everything's really heating up right now.
[01:16:20.355 --> 01:16:27.101]  Do you think this is the big economic collapse, or will it be as big as 2008, where they consolidate more power, get bigger bailouts?
[01:16:27.101 --> 01:16:29.723]  Or is it going to be the big kahuna, Mr. Schneider?
[01:16:31.175 --> 01:16:37.499]  Well, Alex, thank you for having me on, and I do believe that that's exactly what we're heading for, we're progressing for right now.
[01:16:37.499 --> 01:16:41.761]  In fact, it started right in the middle of last year, in June 2015.
[01:16:41.761 --> 01:16:49.205]  Since that time, more than $15 trillion has been wiped out from stock markets all around the world.
[01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:51.727]  And so we've seen this massive amount of money lost.
[01:16:51.727 --> 01:17:00.072]  In fact, just on Wednesday, we learned, they told us, CNBC, all the big mainstream news networks, they told us global stocks enter bear market
[01:17:00.872 --> 01:17:06.915]  For the first time in ages, and what that means is that global stocks are roughly down about 20%.
[01:17:06.915 --> 01:17:14.198]  So roughly approximately a fifth of all stock market wealth in the world has been totally wiped out.
[01:17:14.198 --> 01:17:22.781]  So this has been going on for a number of months, but now since the beginning of the year, you know, we've seen an acceleration with the emergency shutdowns of the Chinese markets.
[01:17:22.781 --> 01:17:23.282]  The U.S.
[01:17:23.282 --> 01:17:26.263]  markets have started to tumble, taking a tremendous tumble.
[01:17:26.263 --> 01:17:29.084]  In fact, through Wednesday, it was the worst start for
[01:17:29.264 --> 01:17:32.887]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average that we've ever seen in all of history.
[01:17:32.887 --> 01:17:40.992]  So it's starting to get the attention of the American people, the mainstream media, although they're still telling people, don't panic, everything's going to be okay.
[01:17:40.992 --> 01:17:54.582]  But what we're seeing, it's not, you know, a lot of times people are looking for a day, a week, a month, you know, we're not looking for a single event, but it's a progression which is eventually going to lead us into a crisis like we saw in 2008 and eventually lead us
[01:17:55.302 --> 01:17:58.805]  Beyond that, I believe into an even far greater crisis.
[01:17:58.805 --> 01:18:01.748]  In fact, in many areas around the world, that's already a reality.
[01:18:02.671 --> 01:18:03.351]  Well, that's right.
[01:18:03.351 --> 01:18:16.055]  And then you've got people with most of the world in a depression or a recession, civil wars or proxy wars in more than 30 countries, doubling of starvation per year just in the last few years.
[01:18:16.055 --> 01:18:17.375]  The world is melting down.
[01:18:17.375 --> 01:18:19.276]  The Pentagon says that.
[01:18:19.276 --> 01:18:20.736]  You write about it.
[01:18:20.736 --> 01:18:27.058]  But then they have the New York Times and others come out and attack myself, Gerald Cilenti and countless others saying, we're porn dealers.
[01:18:27.058 --> 01:18:31.359]  No, we're pointing out that they've engineered the system that's now collapsing
[01:18:32.438 --> 01:18:35.520]  To consolidate control, we've been proven right.
[01:18:48.869 --> 01:18:56.352]  Trust funds based on the stock market, based on 401Ks, based on mutual funds, go in the toilet.
[01:18:56.352 --> 01:18:57.512]  What are they going to do?
[01:18:57.512 --> 01:19:01.634]  Because in the Depression, people at least knew how to skin a buck or run a trot line.
[01:19:01.634 --> 01:19:05.256]  These yuppies don't know how to wipe their fat asses.
[01:19:05.256 --> 01:19:06.176]  Excuse me, I apologize.
[01:19:08.115 --> 01:19:10.196]  Oh, you're absolutely correct, Alex.
[01:19:10.196 --> 01:19:14.297]  In fact, just a couple weeks ago, Drudge Report came out with a new number.
[01:19:14.297 --> 01:19:18.158]  You know, before it was just 62% of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck.
[01:19:18.158 --> 01:19:22.739]  Now it's 63% of all Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[01:19:22.739 --> 01:19:26.000]  So we're seeing the middle class hurting, middle class declining.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:32.541]  In fact, for the first time ever, we learned just at the end of last year, the middle class in the United States is now a minority.
[01:19:32.541 --> 01:19:33.022]  We're down to 49%.
[01:19:34.602 --> 01:19:39.107]  You know, you take the wealthy and the poor together, they outnumber the middle class for the first time ever.
[01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:41.590]  Back in the 1970s, more than 60% of all Americans were middle class.
[01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.991]  Absolutely.
[01:19:41.991 --> 01:19:44.794]  Let's go to those numbers when we come back with Michael Schneider.
[01:19:44.794 --> 01:19:45.575]  And think about this.
[01:19:45.575 --> 01:19:53.544]  World Bank of Scotland two weeks ago did the equivalent of running naked with your hair on fire, screaming, sell everything, get out now.
[01:19:55.097 --> 01:19:56.698]  I mean, it's reached that point.
[01:19:56.698 --> 01:19:58.899]  Stay with us.

[01:24:06.902 --> 01:24:09.384]  All those drifters' years are behind me now.
[01:24:09.384 --> 01:24:11.366]  You got so much more to think about.
[01:24:11.366 --> 01:24:12.446]  World government collapse.
[01:24:12.446 --> 01:24:13.207]  Terror cells.
[01:24:13.207 --> 01:24:13.867]  Conscription.
[01:24:32.051 --> 01:24:33.972]  Forced inoculations.
[01:24:33.972 --> 01:24:36.372]  Gender reassignment in first grade.
[01:24:36.372 --> 01:24:37.613]  Worldwide.
[01:24:37.613 --> 01:24:40.973]  The school tells you what you're going to be, basically.
[01:24:40.973 --> 01:24:45.235]  In the name of letting you be free.
[01:24:45.235 --> 01:24:48.375]  Well, it's the establishment running against the wind of history.
[01:24:48.375 --> 01:24:54.737]  And no amount of technological time prediction systems and algorithms will be able to save them.
[01:24:54.737 --> 01:25:01.079]  Not once the rising giant that is the human spirit begins to fight back, which is starting now.
[01:25:02.489 --> 01:25:04.570]  Michael Schneider of the Economic Collapse Blog is with us.
[01:25:04.570 --> 01:25:06.911]  It's a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:25:06.911 --> 01:25:08.652]  And I should have made a bigger deal out of this.
[01:25:08.652 --> 01:25:10.513]  It is a huge big deal.
[01:25:10.513 --> 01:25:16.016]  Breaking Hillary Denies Email Hack, which we've had Secret Service agents on and others about.
[01:25:16.016 --> 01:25:18.877]  She denied that she'd been hacked.
[01:25:18.877 --> 01:25:20.858]  She denied that she had classified emails.
[01:25:20.858 --> 01:25:22.439]  Then she said she'd given them all over.
[01:25:22.439 --> 01:25:23.459]  Then there were more.
[01:25:23.459 --> 01:25:26.001]  Now there's Above Top Secret.
[01:25:26.001 --> 01:25:27.061]  Above Top Secret?
[01:25:27.061 --> 01:25:29.002]  Boy, you don't hear about that.
[01:25:29.002 --> 01:25:30.263]  That's ultra.
[01:25:31.394 --> 01:25:32.855]  Was the old classification for that.
[01:25:32.855 --> 01:25:39.400]  And then there's stuff so secret it doesn't even have a classification.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:46.426]  And it's only in those little National Security Council star chambers.
[01:25:46.426 --> 01:25:49.468]  I want to get his take on this and get back into what's happening worldwide.
[01:25:49.468 --> 01:25:52.090]  What are people going to do as things collapse?
[01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:53.632]  Well, they're going to listen to the media and the government.
[01:25:54.366 --> 01:25:56.627]  And the government's going to make sure they get enslaved further.
[01:25:56.627 --> 01:26:00.509]  And that's the big challenge now is how do we stop them from doing that?
[01:26:00.509 --> 01:26:02.470]  But we'll first get more into the collapse itself.
[01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:04.931]  But next segment, I'm going to play the video of Richard Reeves.
[01:26:04.931 --> 01:26:07.153]  Yesterday, Hillary denies the email hack.
[01:26:07.153 --> 01:26:10.875]  And boy, she looks like when she hears InfoWars, she turns around and looks at him.
[01:26:10.875 --> 01:26:15.377]  I mean, like she has come face to face with the enemy incarnate.
[01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:20.092]  Which I see as a red badge of courage.
[01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:26.337]  Going back to Mr. Schneider, you were getting into the economic numbers, the demographics around the world.
[01:26:26.337 --> 01:26:34.364]  What are the yuppies and the trendies going to do when the system betrays them yet again?
[01:26:34.364 --> 01:26:39.187]  Do you expect them to keep doubling down for Bernie Sanders and class warfare?
[01:26:39.187 --> 01:26:40.969]  What do you expect to come out of this politically currently?
[01:26:42.403 --> 01:26:45.245]  Well, I expect for a great political shaking.
[01:26:45.245 --> 01:26:57.895]  I believe we're going to see things in the political realm we've never seen before, because when people, what they depend on, this debt-fueled prosperity that we've all been enjoying, when that's taken away, people are going to be shaken, and people are going to be angry.
[01:26:57.895 --> 01:27:12.047]  Already we see levels of anger and frustration across this country at unprecedented levels, and people are going to be upset, they're going to demand answers, they're going to demand solutions, and they're going to look to the government to be their savior, because they expect whatever happens, especially among the liberals,
[01:27:12.267 --> 01:27:14.568]  They expect the government to come in and fix it.
[01:27:14.568 --> 01:27:16.348]  But there's not going to be a problem this year.
[01:27:16.348 --> 01:27:20.910]  In fact, the elite are already admitting that the central banks have used up all their ammunition.
[01:27:20.910 --> 01:27:23.131]  They've already pushed interest rates to the floor.
[01:27:23.131 --> 01:27:26.572]  They've been printing money wildly around the world the last few years.
[01:27:26.572 --> 01:27:32.274]  So they've used up all their ammunition, and yet now another crisis is here, a worse crisis is here.
[01:27:32.274 --> 01:27:40.336]  And when we come back after the break, we can talk about all the numbers, all the patterns that we saw just prior to the last financial crisis that are happening again.
[01:27:40.336 --> 01:27:41.277]  And we've got some time.
[01:27:42.097 --> 01:27:44.378]  Let's start walking through those numbers right now.
[01:27:44.378 --> 01:27:53.443]  But of course the establishment will be happy to give themselves 100 trillion of new carbon tax money, as Davos is calling for, over the next decade to save us though.
[01:27:55.106 --> 01:27:56.567]  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:27:56.567 --> 01:28:01.449]  And yet the foundations, the fundamentals are falling apart all around us.
[01:28:01.449 --> 01:28:02.530]  Just look at global trade.
[01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:07.892]  There was a wonderful report up on InfoWars.com just this morning about how global trade is collapsing.
[01:28:07.892 --> 01:28:16.257]  The Baltic Dry Index, it collapsed before the stock market crash of 1987, before the dot-com bubble burst around the turn of the century.
[01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:17.517]  It collapsed before the 2008 crash.
[01:28:19.278 --> 01:28:23.783]  And now the Baltic Dry Index just this week has fallen to the lowest level ever.
[01:28:23.783 --> 01:28:27.187]  We've never seen it at this level before.
[01:28:27.187 --> 01:28:28.689]  And so global trade is imploding.
[01:28:28.689 --> 01:28:37.379]  In fact, Bloomberg is reporting that it's now cheaper to rent a 1,000-foot merchant vessel than it is to rent a Ferrari.
[01:28:37.739 --> 01:28:40.321]  That's how much global trade is collapsing at this point.
[01:28:40.321 --> 01:28:43.965]  Look at the Baltic Dry Index, as you know, the lowest ever recorded in shipping.
[01:28:43.965 --> 01:28:46.607]  I mean, it's a cardiac arrest.
[01:28:46.607 --> 01:28:53.954]  It's much worse than they're even saying when the Royal Bank of Scotland, two weeks ago, said sell everything emergency to its members.
[01:28:53.954 --> 01:29:00.760]  What do you, I mean, how bad do you think it's going to get if trade and rail line commerce is at a record low?
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.422]  I mean, that is a bad indicator.
[01:29:03.735 --> 01:29:07.076]  Yeah, Chinese exports are way down, U.S.
[01:29:07.076 --> 01:29:16.899]  exports are way down, but kind of a canary in the coal mine that some of the experts really look at and have looked at for years to say, what's really going on with global trade is South Korean exports.
[01:29:16.899 --> 01:29:21.680]  And in December, South Korean exports were down 13.8% year over year.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:23.561]  So that's another huge red flag.
[01:29:23.561 --> 01:29:28.042]  Global trade is literally imploding in Europe and Asia, North America, all over.
[01:29:28.542 --> 01:29:33.426]  And what this means is real economic activity is dramatically slowing down.
[01:29:33.426 --> 01:29:35.388]  So what's happening with the financial markets right now?
[01:29:35.388 --> 01:29:37.849]  They're just starting to catch up with economic reality.
[01:29:37.849 --> 01:29:38.830]  Well, I'll tell you the answer.
[01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:44.295]  It's let's raise taxes on the middle class and give the money to welfare recipients to buy lottery tickets.
[01:29:44.295 --> 01:29:45.996]  That will get us to Mars.
[01:29:45.996 --> 01:29:47.998]  That will take us to the next level.
[01:29:47.998 --> 01:29:49.399]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.399 --> 01:29:51.921]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.921 --> 01:29:54.603]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.743 --> 01:30:05.769]  The Democratic Party establishment that wants to install Hillary into the White House in this next election season is currently in freefall.
[01:30:05.769 --> 01:30:14.095]  The plan for potential first husband Bill Clinton has failed miserably, as women have crawled out of the woodwork to describe his detailed history of sexual abuse.
[01:30:14.095 --> 01:30:19.940]  She also has the looming email scandal, which doesn't seem to go away, no matter how many jokes she throws at it.
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:21.461]  The latest news comes out of Beaumont,
[01:30:21.561 --> 01:30:24.682]  Where only six people were at the airport to greet the former first lady.
[01:30:24.682 --> 01:30:28.443]  KDFM reported that she didn't say hello or visit any of those six people.
[01:30:28.443 --> 01:30:29.703]  She just drove away.
[01:30:29.703 --> 01:30:30.804]  And where was she going?
[01:30:30.804 --> 01:30:35.545]  Oh, to a private fundraiser held by Pakistani businessman Tahir Javid to collect $500,000.
[01:30:35.545 --> 01:30:38.606]  The news reported it as a private meeting.
[01:30:38.606 --> 01:30:42.107]  Back in 2008, she attended another private meeting with Barack Obama.
[01:30:42.267 --> 01:30:46.151]  This occurred, of course, in Chantilly, Virginia, during the Bilderberg meeting.
[01:30:46.151 --> 01:30:51.395]  In fact, her campaign has become so desperate, she's now labeling Bernie Sanders as a white elitist.
[01:30:51.395 --> 01:30:53.157]  Read the article at InfoWars.com.
[01:30:53.157 --> 01:30:55.039]  Bernie Sanders, very white.
[01:30:55.039 --> 01:30:58.162]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:30:58.582 --> 01:31:04.527]  Supermail Vitality is InfoWarsLife.com's number one selling product for a good reason.

[01:31:59.241 --> 01:31:59.801]  Good, brother.
[01:31:59.801 --> 01:32:01.762]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:32:01.762 --> 01:32:03.484]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:32:03.484 --> 01:32:07.526]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:32:07.526 --> 01:32:08.267]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:32:08.267 --> 01:32:12.550]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:20.475]  Supermail Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:20.735 --> 01:32:23.959]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.

[01:32:25.501 --> 01:32:28.424]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:32:28.424 --> 01:32:30.186]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:32:30.186 --> 01:32:35.552]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[01:32:35.592 --> 01:32:36.393]  We're good to go.
[01:33:09.028 --> 01:33:15.013]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.013 --> 01:33:18.235]  Please allow me to introduce myself.
[01:33:18.235 --> 01:33:21.157]  I'm a man of wealth and taste.
[01:33:21.157 --> 01:33:26.181]  Been around for a long, long year.
[01:33:26.181 --> 01:33:29.884]  So many a man sold to waste.
[01:33:29.884 --> 01:33:36.409]  I'll drown in Jesus Christ at his moment of doubt.
[01:33:40.112 --> 01:33:51.139]  Monday through Friday.
[01:33:51.139 --> 01:33:52.140]  We're here from 11 a.m.

[01:34:00.426 --> 01:34:03.428]  I will be live in studio this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:34:03.428 --> 01:34:04.368]  Central Standard Time.
[01:34:04.368 --> 01:34:06.310]  There's so much news happens over the weekend.
[01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:17.317]  I'll be doing special live reports over the weekend with video feeds and InfoWars.com forward slash show, Facebook mentions and more using every tool at our disposal as this quickening intensifies.
[01:34:17.317 --> 01:34:20.820]  We're going back to Michael Snyder at the EconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:23.522]  He's a great interview but he also really has deep
[01:34:24.122 --> 01:34:27.644]  analysis and in cross-referencing in his daily stories.
[01:34:27.644 --> 01:34:29.164]  He's a very prolific writer.
[01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:35.447]  We're going to go back to him here in just a moment and also take a few calls specifically with your questions or comments.
[01:34:35.447 --> 01:34:39.188]  I mean how bad do you think this economic crisis is gonna be?
[01:34:39.188 --> 01:34:45.971]  Can we educate folks that crony capitalism and fascism wearing a socialist mask
[01:34:47.222 --> 01:34:48.623]  You never really even have socialism.
[01:34:48.623 --> 01:34:50.925]  It's always big crony groups managing socialism.
[01:34:50.925 --> 01:34:52.306]  It's fascism.
[01:34:52.306 --> 01:34:54.467]  Socialism and communism never really exist in my view.
[01:34:54.467 --> 01:34:56.048]  I've studied all these systems.
[01:34:56.048 --> 01:35:04.795]  I mean, it's just, it's a bunch of offshore people above the law, getting everybody dependent and then administering it all like a, like an Indian reservation.
[01:35:04.795 --> 01:35:06.976]  Folks, everybody knows those are screw jobs.
[01:35:06.976 --> 01:35:07.997]  Is that socialism?
[01:35:07.997 --> 01:35:08.818]  No, it's fascism.
[01:35:10.666 --> 01:35:12.087]  Are the Democrats liberals?
[01:35:12.087 --> 01:35:15.329]  No, they're out-of-control fascists, and so are the Republican leaders.
[01:35:15.329 --> 01:35:16.890]  And I'm sick of them!
[01:35:16.890 --> 01:35:23.494]  Bernie Sanders is a disgusting maggot, playing class envy all day.
[01:35:23.494 --> 01:35:29.017]  Where is he against Walmart for the slave labor, for the internal tariffs, and all the NAFTA and GATT and things that did us
[01:35:31.542 --> 01:35:33.183]  Down to this level.
[01:35:33.183 --> 01:35:33.824]  He's not there.
[01:35:33.824 --> 01:35:35.385]  It's just class envy, class envy.
[01:35:35.385 --> 01:35:37.687]  Oh, the Walmart family's worth hundreds of billions.
[01:35:37.687 --> 01:35:39.168]  Get their money, get their money.
[01:35:39.168 --> 01:35:51.677]  You could take their $180 billion that the family's got, all seven of the siblings, and you could spend it in just a few months in the country, just in the government.
[01:35:51.677 --> 01:35:54.299]  It'd all be gone.
[01:35:54.299 --> 01:35:58.762]  You could take all of the quote, elite's real money, and it wouldn't pay for the country to run for a year.
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:05.921]  And they've signed us on to thousands of trillions of made-up black hole money.
[01:36:05.921 --> 01:36:06.921]  And people go, that's stupid.
[01:36:06.921 --> 01:36:08.002]  Why'd they do that?
[01:36:08.002 --> 01:36:12.943]  Because it's designed to be undefeatable if you sign on to it.
[01:36:12.943 --> 01:36:15.363]  They trick you too big to fail.
[01:36:15.363 --> 01:36:18.904]  You sign on to it to prop everything up, and it doesn't prop up.
[01:36:18.904 --> 01:36:21.185]  It just collapses into a new phase.
[01:36:21.185 --> 01:36:23.145]  They get more consolidation of power.
[01:36:23.145 --> 01:36:24.266]  They pump it back up.
[01:36:24.266 --> 01:36:25.446]  It collapses again.
[01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:27.226]  But overall, you're going downhill.
[01:36:27.226 --> 01:36:29.387]  We'll talk to our guests in a moment about that, but first,
[01:36:33.697 --> 01:36:39.441]  Let's go to this clip of Hillary Clinton last night with Richard Reeves, with her on the campaign trail in Texas.
[01:36:39.441 --> 01:36:46.626]  He'll be on with us for about 15 minutes, the start of the next hour, bringing up the fact that experts are saying that her email has been hacked.
[01:36:46.626 --> 01:36:51.149]  The former Secretary of Defense is saying undoubtedly that happened, but she just says, no, it hasn't happened.
[01:36:51.149 --> 01:36:52.150]  Another ball-faced lie.
[01:36:52.150 --> 01:36:52.470]  Here it is.
[01:36:53.692 --> 01:37:01.696]  Secretary Clinton, last week it was reported on InfoWars.com that your email server was hacked and you knowingly continued to use your email server.
[01:37:01.696 --> 01:37:02.577]  Can you comment on that?
[01:37:02.577 --> 01:37:03.677]  Yeah, it's totally untrue.
[01:37:03.677 --> 01:37:06.659]  It's totally untrue.
[01:37:06.659 --> 01:37:09.780]  And she keeps saying there were no extra emails.
[01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:14.383]  She keeps saying that none of it was classified.
[01:37:14.383 --> 01:37:15.503]  Now it's proven it was.
[01:37:15.503 --> 01:37:16.964]  I mean, this is amazing.
[01:37:18.424 --> 01:37:19.785]  This is amazing.
[01:37:19.785 --> 01:37:21.606]  She thinks people are so stupid.
[01:37:21.606 --> 01:37:22.106]  And you know what?
[01:37:22.106 --> 01:37:23.867]  Her constituents, they're not stupid.
[01:37:23.867 --> 01:37:26.588]  They're delusional.
[01:37:26.588 --> 01:37:40.335]  In fact, can we get the clip and make an intro of like different cultists in different movies, like Jim Jones, a real one, or Thulsa Doom, a fake one, and put clips of Democrat supporters and Obama making crazy statements about
[01:37:41.294 --> 01:37:42.414]  You didn't build your business.
[01:37:42.414 --> 01:37:43.414]  You can keep your doctor.
[01:37:43.414 --> 01:37:45.155]  We're not coming for your guns.
[01:37:45.155 --> 01:37:46.215]  And cut that in together.
[01:37:46.215 --> 01:37:52.536]  You know, when Thulsa Doom and Conan the Barbarian says, Steel isn't... Steel isn't strong, boy.
[01:37:52.536 --> 01:37:55.597]  Flesh is strong.
[01:37:55.597 --> 01:37:57.957]  Take the arm that wields your sword.
[01:37:57.957 --> 01:37:59.318]  The body that God gave you.
[01:37:59.318 --> 01:38:05.199]  I will now show you the power of flesh, Conan.
[01:38:07.062 --> 01:38:09.564]  My child, come to me.
[01:38:09.564 --> 01:38:10.284]  Come to me.
[01:38:10.284 --> 01:38:12.746]  She's 400 feet up and just jumps off and falls.
[01:38:12.746 --> 01:38:17.109]  I'm telling you, Hillary could look up to a bunch of women and go, come to me.
[01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:18.631]  Come to me, my child.
[01:38:18.631 --> 01:38:19.031]  Come to me.
[01:38:19.031 --> 01:38:24.595]  They would just, I mean, I'm telling you folks, this is a cult.
[01:38:24.595 --> 01:38:25.255]  Guys, go to YouTube.
[01:38:25.255 --> 01:38:25.936]  I know it's on there.
[01:38:25.936 --> 01:38:27.917]  Thulsa Doom woman jumps off platform.
[01:38:27.917 --> 01:38:29.739]  I'm telling you that describes
[01:38:31.035 --> 01:38:35.477]  The Democratic Party and the Republican establishment is a bunch of loons.
[01:38:35.477 --> 01:38:40.419]  And of course, the cult leaders are nuts as well.
[01:38:40.419 --> 01:38:45.441]  Briefly, ladies and gentlemen, we have a bunch of specials that end today.
[01:38:45.441 --> 01:38:51.023]  One of them is Survival Shield Nascent Iodine, the key halogen, the good halogen.
[01:38:51.023 --> 01:38:52.203]  All those other halogens are bad.
[01:38:52.203 --> 01:38:54.444]  The fluoride, the bromine, the bromine, all of it.
[01:38:54.444 --> 01:38:59.646]  Chlorine that's in the water, that's in the plastic, that's in the clothing, that's just everywhere.
[01:38:59.646 --> 01:39:00.267]  It's in the food.
[01:39:01.127 --> 01:39:08.832]  This is the good halogen that your body actually operates off of in the glands, the thyroid, and it'll push out the bad.
[01:39:08.832 --> 01:39:10.554]  But you will detox in two weeks to a month.
[01:39:10.554 --> 01:39:12.915]  I mean, you'll feel crabby for about a week.
[01:39:12.915 --> 01:39:16.898]  Everybody that's done it after about two, three weeks feels this, and then it's just incredible after.
[01:39:16.898 --> 01:39:20.180]  Stuff starts coming out of your skin, at least that's what all the reviewers say, what's happened to me.
[01:39:21.421 --> 01:39:22.041]  It's incredible.
[01:39:22.041 --> 01:39:23.582]  You get it with Supermel Vitality.
[01:39:23.582 --> 01:39:25.882]  15% off both of them together.

[01:40:00.396 --> 01:40:02.518]  But the nutraceuticals are so incredible as well.
[01:40:02.518 --> 01:40:05.261]  We've got the Hillary for Prison t-shirts that are limited edition.
[01:40:05.261 --> 01:40:06.663]  Some of the sizes have already sold out.
[01:40:06.663 --> 01:40:08.264]  We have the new limited edition shirt in.
[01:40:08.264 --> 01:40:10.326]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:40:10.326 --> 01:40:11.848]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:40:11.848 --> 01:40:16.132]  And don't forget to support those local affiliates and their sponsors as well and spread the word.
[01:40:16.132 --> 01:40:18.915]  Don't take this show for granted because we've hit
[01:40:19.836 --> 01:40:32.001]  A point here in the metric where the enemy has gotten so naked about world government, their planetary plan, that the credibility of everyone opposing it, especially those that have been around for a long time, is exploding.
[01:40:32.001 --> 01:40:34.122]  The listenership, the viewership, the readership.
[01:40:34.122 --> 01:40:38.284]  I don't know, I haven't asked Schneider, but I bet people visiting his sites exploded.
[01:40:38.284 --> 01:40:43.506]  Because, and we're asking right now, we're riding a rocket, folks!
[01:40:43.506 --> 01:40:45.667]  The globalists want to take us on an express elevator to hell!
[01:40:47.745 --> 01:40:55.411]  We want to go on Express Elevator to a free market heaven, and believe me, free markets create incredible wealth, incredible innovation.
[01:40:55.411 --> 01:40:58.754]  They also then create incredible decadence and spoil rotten children.
[01:40:58.754 --> 01:41:05.819]  If we're going to have a free market, we've got to have children that aren't decadent, that are made to work, that aren't given everything, or we turn into what we've got here.
[01:41:05.819 --> 01:41:07.300]  A bunch of stupid, arrogant chumps.
[01:41:08.101 --> 01:41:09.323]  Not everybody, but a large portion.
[01:41:09.323 --> 01:41:10.123]  Let's admit it.
[01:41:10.123 --> 01:41:16.771]  We are exceptionally stupid, exceptionally fat, exceptionally dumb, exceptionally mindless, exceptionally sick.
[01:41:16.771 --> 01:41:18.573]  We are a mentally ill, sick society.
[01:41:18.573 --> 01:41:21.336]  I mean, my God, they heat hospitals with dead babies.
[01:41:21.336 --> 01:41:23.919]  We're growing humanoids inside cows to harvest their organs.
[01:41:23.919 --> 01:41:24.440]  MIT.
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:25.641]  I mean, it's all happening.
[01:41:25.641 --> 01:41:27.744]  Just admit we're screwed.
[01:41:27.744 --> 01:41:28.545]  And then let's get out of it.
[01:41:29.525 --> 01:41:31.187]  Okay, going back to Michael Schneider.
[01:41:31.187 --> 01:41:34.069]  Michael, thank you for joining us while I went over those rants there.
[01:41:34.069 --> 01:41:42.697]  I want to get into some other issues of science with you as well, but you've got the floor for about 10 minutes or so here, and we've got a break, and then we're going to take some calls for two little segments with you.
[01:41:42.697 --> 01:41:43.798]  But let's go ahead, 800-259-9231.
[01:41:43.798 --> 01:41:46.701]  We're going to go ahead and launch that phone system, 800-259-9231.
[01:41:50.965 --> 01:41:51.706]  You've got the floor.
[01:41:51.706 --> 01:41:57.654]  Break down from your deep research exactly where we are, how bad the collapse is going to be, and what we've got to watch for.
[01:41:57.654 --> 01:42:01.919]  We know they're announcing world government, planetary, SDR currency that's digital.
[01:42:01.919 --> 01:42:04.863]  The dum-dums will say, where's the new currency we're supposed to get?
[01:42:04.863 --> 01:42:06.905]  Your dollar will now be based in it.
[01:42:06.905 --> 01:42:07.966]  What do we do to stop this?
[01:42:09.482 --> 01:42:13.207]  Well, Alex, what we're looking for is patterns.
[01:42:13.207 --> 01:42:19.956]  And, for example, in the last thing that we talked about, the Baltic Dry Index and how it crashed before previous crashes.
[01:42:19.956 --> 01:42:25.543]  Another thing, though, for your watchers and viewers to look for is junk bonds.
[01:42:26.184 --> 01:42:27.805]  Jump bonds crashed hard.
[01:42:27.805 --> 01:42:31.848]  If you look at a chart of jump bonds, they crashed hard before the crash of 2008.
[01:42:31.848 --> 01:42:43.737]  That was before stocks did, because when a financial crisis is coming, you would expect the trouble to show up in firms that are more leveraged, that are riskier, that are more vulnerable.
[01:42:43.737 --> 01:42:45.699]  And that's exactly what we saw in 2008.
[01:42:45.699 --> 01:42:47.821]  That's exactly what we're seeing right now.
[01:42:47.821 --> 01:42:52.985]  So the last recession ended, and there's an ETF that I watch very, very closely.
[01:42:52.985 --> 01:42:53.905]  It's known as JNK.
[01:42:55.066 --> 01:42:59.631]  And after the last recession, well, it crashed hard before the stock market crashed, then it rebounded.
[01:42:59.631 --> 01:43:04.015]  And ever since that time, it's traded in a range of about 36 to 42.
[01:43:04.015 --> 01:43:11.382]  And I knew that if it ever dropped below 35, that would be confirmation that a new financial crisis had begun.
[01:43:11.382 --> 01:43:15.827]  And it never did, all those years that I've been writing, until December.
[01:43:16.267 --> 01:43:26.559]  In December, this past December, it finally crossed below $35, it went below $34, then now it's gone below $33, and briefly this week during the panic, it dropped below $32.
[01:43:26.559 --> 01:43:32.306]  But junk bonds are crashing right now, just as we would expect before a major stock market crash.
[01:43:32.626 --> 01:43:33.347]  Here in the U.S.
[01:43:33.347 --> 01:43:34.147]  and around the world.
[01:43:34.147 --> 01:43:35.828]  So that's a huge warning sign.
[01:43:35.828 --> 01:43:37.930]  Another huge warning sign is the price of oil.
[01:43:37.930 --> 01:43:42.093]  You know, we've seen the price of oil crash just like we did in 2008.
[01:43:42.093 --> 01:43:49.958]  If people remember, it shot up to about $140 a barrel, then crashed really hard to below $40 a barrel for a short period of time.
[01:43:49.958 --> 01:43:52.500]  And that was before the great stock market crash of 2008.
[01:43:53.701 --> 01:43:54.802]  Now it's happening again.
[01:43:54.802 --> 01:44:02.865]  Over the last 18 months we've seen the price of oil go from $108 a barrel all the way this week it dipped well below $30 a barrel.
[01:44:02.865 --> 01:44:07.927]  This is the only other time in all of history other than 2008 when we've seen this happen.
[01:44:07.927 --> 01:44:15.470]  Now a lot of people may think, well the price of oil is good, I can go to the store, I can fill up my tank really cheaply, less than $2 a gallon, this is good for me.
[01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:17.351]  Well it's really bad for the U.S.
[01:44:17.351 --> 01:44:18.852]  economy and the global economy.
[01:44:19.652 --> 01:44:26.955]  In fact, just since the start of 2015, we've seen 42 North American energy companies go bankrupt.
[01:44:26.955 --> 01:44:31.616]  We've seen more than 130,000 good-paying energy jobs lost.
[01:44:31.616 --> 01:44:37.078]  And that's really bad news, because the energy industry was the primary engine for the growth of good-paying jobs.
[01:44:37.078 --> 01:44:38.618]  Texas is plunging.
[01:44:38.618 --> 01:44:39.999]  Now that's completely reversing.
[01:44:40.379 --> 01:44:52.966]  So we're seeing an implosion of these jobs and this is putting a tremendous amount of stress on the financial sector because a lot of these fracking companies, the oil companies, energy companies, they wanted to drill, drill, drill.
[01:44:52.966 --> 01:44:57.109]  So they went out and got all kinds of loans from the big banks, financial institutions,
[01:44:57.549 --> 01:45:11.504]  Now those loans are going bad, and so these big banks, you know, in fact just this week we saw some of the biggest banks in the United States come out and say, yeah, we're starting to set more money aside to cover these bad loans because the energy sector is in a massive amount of trouble.
[01:45:11.504 --> 01:45:17.070]  Another thing we saw just before the last financial crisis was a crash in the price of industrial commodities.
[01:45:17.070 --> 01:45:20.013]  I'm talking about tin, iron ore, lead, aluminum,
[01:45:20.333 --> 01:45:30.217]  Copper especially if you look at the chart of copper in 2008 crashed hard before stocks did and then it's happening again toward the second half of last year.
[01:45:30.217 --> 01:45:39.982]  I was warning my Readers about this and all these other patterns that we saw that are happening again Because these are huge red flags.
[01:45:39.982 --> 01:45:49.026]  There's so many of them Alex right now in fact if I was going to make up a textbook scenario for what a financial crisis would look like all the boxes are ticked all the technical indicators are
[01:45:49.506 --> 01:45:50.086]  Are there.
[01:45:50.086 --> 01:45:51.968]  Another one is the surging U.S.
[01:45:51.968 --> 01:45:52.448]  dollar.
[01:45:52.448 --> 01:45:56.230]  You know, a lot of people who come on and they talk about the coming economic collapse.
[01:45:56.230 --> 01:45:59.592]  They talk about the death of the dollar and that's coming, but we're not there yet.
[01:45:59.592 --> 01:46:01.553]  But what we've seen in recent months is the U.S.
[01:46:01.553 --> 01:46:03.254]  dollar absolutely surged.
[01:46:03.254 --> 01:46:06.096]  Everyone rushes out of the other smaller servers.
[01:46:06.096 --> 01:46:13.440]  Because what happens is during the boom years, all these emerging markets like Brazil and all around the world, they went in a tremendous amounts of debt.
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:16.162]  They took out all these loans denominated in U.S.
[01:46:16.162 --> 01:46:16.602]  dollars.
[01:46:17.122 --> 01:46:18.382]  Well, now, the U.S.
[01:46:18.382 --> 01:46:24.504]  dollar has surged, so it's taking much, much more of their own local currencies to pay back and service these debts.
[01:46:24.504 --> 01:46:28.866]  Meanwhile, the things they export—oil, commodities, other things—have gone way down.
[01:46:28.866 --> 01:46:32.487]  So this double whammy is just killing these emerging markets.
[01:46:32.927 --> 01:46:46.791]  So the exact same conditions that created the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s, the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s, and that we saw just before the great crash of 2008, it's killing emerging markets all around the world.
[01:46:46.791 --> 01:46:54.153]  For example, down in Brazil, the seventh largest economy on the entire planet, Goldman Sachs says that they're not just in a recession.
[01:46:54.153 --> 01:46:59.295]  Goldman Sachs says they're in an outright depression, Alex.
[01:46:59.295 --> 01:47:00.195]  That's right, my friend.
[01:47:01.843 --> 01:47:26.738]  The allegory, or the analogy for this is, you got a bunch of ships, they're on fire, they're sinking, there's a bigger ship, the biggest ship, it's got problems, it's got some fires on board, but it's seen as the safest, so everybody starts crawling out of those other sinking ships and going into the dollar, going into the bonds, going into the national treasuries, and so it's the last to sink and blow up, but will be the most spectacular, many analysts believe, but China,
[01:47:27.578 --> 01:47:33.543]  With 1,300,000,000 people, most of them forced off rural land, basically into slave factories.
[01:47:33.543 --> 01:47:35.024]  It is a time bomb.
[01:47:35.024 --> 01:47:36.946]  Latin America is a time bomb.
[01:47:36.946 --> 01:47:38.407]  Africa is a time bomb.
[01:47:38.407 --> 01:47:40.709]  The Middle East is a collapsing time bomb.
[01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:50.958]  And the global elites admit they're going into all these revolutions and all these places where 50% of the metric of their paychecks is now going to food.
[01:47:50.958 --> 01:47:54.221]  You pass that metric historically, you get revolution, you get rioting.
[01:47:55.256 --> 01:48:07.444]  The elite are purposely turning off the food, then they're going to open the borders, flood us with massive third world, use that crisis to set up a police state, create a welfare state for those people, weaponize them.
[01:48:07.444 --> 01:48:14.929]  I mean, what's crazy is you can see the engineers of this who are meeting at Davos, the George Soros's
[01:48:16.127 --> 01:48:18.269]  Actually captaining it and bragging.
[01:48:18.269 --> 01:48:22.453]  I mean Hillary said State Department's done a great job in Syria.
[01:48:22.453 --> 01:48:27.157]  She said we've done a great job in Libya, great job in Syria just this last month in December.
[01:48:27.157 --> 01:48:30.360]  They're telling you this is what I meant to do.
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:31.921]  They meant to wreck the world.
[01:48:31.921 --> 01:48:34.043]  They meant to turn radical jihadis loose.
[01:48:34.043 --> 01:48:35.204]  They mean to bring them in.
[01:48:35.204 --> 01:48:37.987]  They mean to let them attack and then take our rights.
[01:48:38.587 --> 01:48:39.187]  More attacks?
[01:48:39.187 --> 01:48:40.808]  Their answer is, take our guns.
[01:48:40.808 --> 01:48:42.810]  A jihadi shot a cop in Philadelphia.
[01:48:42.810 --> 01:48:48.513]  I mean, you can see it, but it really is the ignorance of the public that has allowed this to happen.
[01:48:48.513 --> 01:49:01.662]  What's going to happen, though, when the welfare checks still go out, when the EBT cards still work, but they don't buy what they did before, or the food's not on the shelves, like we're already seeing in the shopping for Snowmageddon?
[01:49:01.662 --> 01:49:05.885]  I mean, with this ignorant, domesticated population,
[01:49:06.789 --> 01:49:12.275]  The Pentagon estimates, as you know, that within about 7 to 8 days most people will steal.
[01:49:12.275 --> 01:49:14.197]  Within about 11 days most people will kill.
[01:49:14.197 --> 01:49:21.524]  90 plus percent of people, it's about 98 in some of the studies, will begin within 15 days going to cannibalism.
[01:49:21.524 --> 01:49:22.465]  Now imagine
[01:49:23.286 --> 01:49:36.309]  Imagine the scenario in a real collapse when the Pentagon admits that a Carrington event from the sun that blew out a lot of our electronics and power, that 90% of the America would be dead within two years.
[01:49:36.309 --> 01:49:37.489]  And I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[01:49:37.489 --> 01:49:47.951]  That's on the bad end, is a Viggo Mortensen road scenario versus what we see Venezuela in, you know, just squalor, rioting, death, murder, crime rates up 3,000%, 4,000%.
[01:49:47.951 --> 01:49:52.712]  I mean, any way you slice this, we are headed into crazy town.
[01:49:54.235 --> 01:49:55.156]  Oh, we absolutely are.
[01:49:55.156 --> 01:49:56.657]  Just look at the snowmageddon.
[01:49:56.657 --> 01:50:03.000]  You know, two or three days in advance, people are pulling all the milk, all the bread off the shelves, you know, just over a snowstorm.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.003]  So when a real disaster strikes, what are things going to look like in America?
[01:50:07.003 --> 01:50:11.546]  Because, you know, desperate people do desperate things, and people are going to become desperate.
[01:50:11.546 --> 01:50:17.289]  Because what we're moving into right now is going to be so similar in the initial stages to 2008.
[01:50:17.289 --> 01:50:19.791]  If people remember, there was a great credit crunch.
[01:50:20.191 --> 01:50:28.617]  When panic and fear grip the financial markets, all of a sudden the banks and the financial institutions, they don't want to lend to each other, they don't want to lend to anyone else.
[01:50:28.617 --> 01:50:33.501]  But don't worry, they've got a plan to take over all the small banks and everybody and give themselves trillions.
[01:50:33.501 --> 01:50:40.886]  And I remember going to soccer games with my kids, watching my son play, and suddenly all the dads have the newspapers out and their phones, caring about finances.
[01:50:40.886 --> 01:50:44.169]  But then I told them, they're all going to pump it back up, then it's going to get even worse.
[01:50:44.169 --> 01:50:45.469]  They don't listen to that.
[01:50:45.469 --> 01:50:46.891]  I mean, people just don't listen.
[01:50:46.891 --> 01:50:47.151]  Go ahead.
[01:50:48.396 --> 01:50:49.276]  Oh, it's true, Alex.
[01:50:49.276 --> 01:50:54.998]  And since the last time around, you know, our politicians, they came out and they said, we're going to fix too big to fail.
[01:50:54.998 --> 01:50:56.179]  But no, did they fix it?
[01:50:56.179 --> 01:50:56.899]  Of course not.
[01:50:56.899 --> 01:51:04.822]  Instead, the too big to fail banks, I'm talking about Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, you know, collectively, they've gotten 40% larger.
[01:51:04.822 --> 01:51:08.423]  Meanwhile, 1,400 smaller banks have totally gone out of existence.
[01:51:08.823 --> 01:51:11.866]  So the problem of too big to fail is now bigger than ever.
[01:51:11.866 --> 01:51:24.799]  Now, when this next crisis comes and the credit crunch comes and all of a sudden people can't get the loans, the mortgages, the credit cards, what we're going to see is if you have a business or you're working somewhere, you're going to notice fewer people are coming in.
[01:51:24.799 --> 01:51:27.161]  And when they come in, they're going to have not as much money to spend.
[01:51:27.581 --> 01:51:30.044]  And so what we're going to see, we're going to see businesses cut back.
[01:51:30.044 --> 01:51:32.166]  We're going to see stores close.
[01:51:32.166 --> 01:51:37.012]  In fact, we just saw Walmart announce the closing of 269 stores worldwide.
[01:51:37.012 --> 01:51:39.635]  We're going to see workers laid off.
[01:51:39.635 --> 01:51:44.020]  We're going to see unemployment skyrocket because most people are living... And we're going to see crime explode.
[01:51:45.831 --> 01:51:48.593]  Yeah, we're already seeing rates of violent crime explode.
[01:51:48.593 --> 01:51:52.836]  It's up 19% in Los Angeles over the past year.
[01:51:52.836 --> 01:51:54.017]  Other cities, double-digit increase.
[01:51:54.017 --> 01:51:56.138]  And this is key, this is key.
[01:51:56.138 --> 01:52:02.282]  Crime has gone down massively, they admit, mainly because of gun proliferation in good people's hands.
[01:52:02.282 --> 01:52:06.806]  So you're going to see huge numbers of gun deaths go up, but it's going to be criminals getting shot.
[01:52:07.426 --> 01:52:09.269]  They're then going to hype that and say, take the guns.
[01:52:09.269 --> 01:52:19.924]  That's why they're doing a new big gun push right now, because they know crime's exploding, and the criminal class, on top and below, as above so below, cannot stand seeing us stand up against them.
[01:52:21.479 --> 01:52:26.821]  Yeah, and we saw a similar pattern in Nazi Germany and Communist China and the Soviet Union.
[01:52:26.821 --> 01:52:29.743]  When they want to bring in tyranny, they want to come grab all the guns.
[01:52:29.743 --> 01:52:35.265]  So no one can be upset, no one can resist, no one can put up a fight.
[01:52:35.265 --> 01:52:37.766]  And so that's what Barack Obama wants to do.
[01:52:37.766 --> 01:52:42.328]  Just like we've seen, it's a different package, but it's the same thing.
[01:52:42.328 --> 01:52:46.030]  But we are going to see civil unrest in this country as things fall apart.
[01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:46.890]  We are going to see
[01:52:47.210 --> 01:52:50.751]  And already they're fueling the racial tensions, the racial riots.
[01:52:50.751 --> 01:52:55.553]  Even with this Academy Awards thing, you know, they're priming the pump.
[01:52:55.553 --> 01:53:00.794]  And so I believe we're headed for a period of crime, riots, craziness in this country.
[01:53:00.794 --> 01:53:01.254]  No doubt.
[01:53:01.254 --> 01:53:02.295]  And that's the key.
[01:53:02.295 --> 01:53:02.755]  The key.
[01:53:03.915 --> 01:53:07.358]  Is that on record the globalists have already tested this in other countries.
[01:53:07.358 --> 01:53:09.199]  They're exacerbating it by design.
[01:53:09.199 --> 01:53:12.321]  They'll hang out in Switzerland and New Zealand while we're all killing each other.
[01:53:12.321 --> 01:53:13.442]  They have engineered this.
[01:53:13.442 --> 01:53:20.507]  The answer is having the state stand up, recognize what's happening, not go along with the central government and this global plan.
[01:53:20.507 --> 01:53:31.014]  They are walking us in to a plan to further bring us to our knees, get us all scared, and have us acquiesce to all of their globalist demands, and thank the engineers of
[01:53:31.634 --> 01:53:46.039]  Of all these problems for quote saving us as the Davos people that own half the stuff in the world through fraud on record lecture us about class warfare and class envy and promote class warfare and socialism.
[01:53:46.039 --> 01:53:49.040]  I mean the public has got to wake up to this ballgame.
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:59.143]  The bigger the socialism gets, the bigger the taxes, the more programs, the worse the jobs get, the worse the education gets, the less opportunities you have and the richer these people get.
[01:53:59.143 --> 01:54:00.464]  Understand me viewers and listeners.
[01:54:01.324 --> 01:54:07.069]  Mexico, just Google this, has the largest share of billionaires of any country in the world.
[01:54:07.069 --> 01:54:09.471]  Mexico's only 130 million people.
[01:54:09.471 --> 01:54:11.232]  They have more billionaires than any other country.
[01:54:11.232 --> 01:54:15.776]  It's because Mexico wrote the book on colonialism, post-colonialism.
[01:54:15.776 --> 01:54:20.380]  You have a tiny elite that literally use those people as slaves.
[01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:22.801]  And you look at the Mexican Congress, you don't talk about racism.
[01:54:23.522 --> 01:54:26.644]  They are whiter than I am, folks, most of the Congress.
[01:54:26.644 --> 01:54:30.866]  And they got names like Schmidt and all the rest of it, okay?
[01:54:30.866 --> 01:54:32.327]  Because you're an empire, you ran Mexico.
[01:54:32.327 --> 01:54:33.528]  They still do.
[01:54:33.528 --> 01:54:40.071]  And that's why Mexico attacked us in World War I. The point is, if you want to live like Mexico, folks, get ready for it.
[01:54:40.071 --> 01:54:40.531]  Okay?
[01:54:40.531 --> 01:54:42.492]  That's their plan.
[01:54:42.492 --> 01:54:45.434]  In fact, guys, just type in, Mexico has the highest share of billionaires in the world.
[01:54:45.434 --> 01:54:47.515]  I know that's a fact because I've seen it many times.
[01:54:47.515 --> 01:54:48.776]  But go ahead, Mr. Schneider.
[01:54:50.057 --> 01:54:52.059]  Oh, you're exactly right, Alex.
[01:54:52.059 --> 01:54:59.788]  A lot of times the elite, they advance their agenda through crisis and every single solution they give us results in more money and more power in their hands.
[01:54:59.788 --> 01:55:02.330]  More globalization, more centralization.
[01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:05.534]  And so you look at this report that Oxfam just put out.
[01:55:05.534 --> 01:55:07.116]  You know, you go back to 2010 and 388 members of the elite
[01:55:10.439 --> 01:55:10.719]  We're good.
[01:55:27.972 --> 01:55:32.237]  The debt-based system around the world, it funnels money to the very top.
[01:55:32.237 --> 01:55:36.242]  You know, every solution they come in, it just pushes more money, more power their way.
[01:55:36.242 --> 01:55:42.630]  Meanwhile, Oxfam found that the bottom half of the world, they've actually gotten a lot poorer over the past few years.
[01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:56.455]  So, global income inequality is increasing, and the power and money is being concentrated at the very, very top, increasingly, so the elite have gotten even more powerful, even more control, and yet, they're not satisfied.
[01:55:56.455 --> 01:56:10.821]  They're going to bring in more crisis to advance their agenda, even more the problem, reaction, solution paradigm that they love to use, and so now they want to go for the big one, bring the middle class, especially in the United States, to their knees, so that they can take us
[01:56:11.601 --> 01:56:16.405]  Much farther down the road to their New World Order.
[01:56:16.405 --> 01:56:16.906]  That's right.
[01:56:16.906 --> 01:56:19.448]  Again, you can pull up Carlos Slim, one of the richest men in the world.
[01:56:19.448 --> 01:56:20.809]  Used to be number one, now he's number two.
[01:56:20.809 --> 01:56:22.110]  And again, that's just the whole front.
[01:56:22.110 --> 01:56:24.532]  And look at the list of Mexican billionaires and Forbes.
[01:56:24.532 --> 01:56:29.396]  And again, that's just a microcosm of they don't want people to be wealthy.
[01:56:29.396 --> 01:56:30.877]  They don't want people to be independent.
[01:56:30.877 --> 01:56:32.679]  That's what Cloward and Piven is.
[01:56:32.679 --> 01:56:34.080]  That's the management system.
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:39.524]  And I don't know how you get the leftist, indoctrinated in public schools, indoctrinated in colleges,
[01:56:40.543 --> 01:56:42.843]  I mean, listen, I never used to be the guy that was left, left, left.
[01:56:42.843 --> 01:56:44.204]  I'm trying to get out of the left-right paradigm.
[01:56:44.204 --> 01:56:51.145]  But in the left-right paradigm, it's real that, I mean, I was against Bush and stuff Republicans were doing big time.
[01:56:51.145 --> 01:56:52.705]  But the Democrats, it's cultic.
[01:56:52.705 --> 01:56:54.766]  They call for me to be shut down.
[01:56:54.766 --> 01:56:56.886]  There were articles yesterday saying, get rid of free speech.
[01:56:56.886 --> 01:56:58.147]  It's racist.
[01:56:58.147 --> 01:57:01.407]  There are calls for just arresting gun owners en masse.
[01:57:01.407 --> 01:57:03.068]  We go out and talk to Democrats on the street.
[01:57:03.068 --> 01:57:04.228]  These are scary people.
[01:57:04.228 --> 01:57:06.548]  And they make jokes about dead babies.
[01:57:06.548 --> 01:57:09.609]  I mean, they seem to be just waddling, decadent brown shirts.
[01:57:11.303 --> 01:57:12.223]  Oh, it's absolutely true.
[01:57:12.223 --> 01:57:14.884]  But the good news, Alex, is that people are starting to wake up.
[01:57:14.884 --> 01:57:18.446]  You mentioned earlier, your viewership is exploding on my websites.
[01:57:18.446 --> 01:57:21.127]  We set all kinds of records in the last six months of this year.
[01:57:21.127 --> 01:57:27.989]  You know, more than a million page views alone on the Economic Collapse blog alone, month after month.
[01:57:27.989 --> 01:57:29.330]  So people are waking up.
[01:57:29.330 --> 01:57:34.432]  They're seeking out alternative sources of information because they know the mainstream news is lying to them.
[01:57:34.432 --> 01:57:35.993]  In fact, over 90% of what people get
[01:57:37.213 --> 01:57:49.319]  From the television, the movies, the video games, the publishing houses, all the mainstream news outlets at the very top are owned by just six giant media conglomerates, all of which are pushing the agenda of the elite.
[01:57:49.319 --> 01:57:55.002]  So people are getting fed up, they're sick of it, so they're turning to your show, they're turning to my website, other sources.
[01:57:55.002 --> 01:57:55.642]  That's right.
[01:57:55.642 --> 01:57:59.624]  Because people want, they know something's wrong and they want answers.
[01:57:59.624 --> 01:58:04.367]  There is a full court press and I wanted to get to this article.
[01:58:05.931 --> 01:58:10.135]  Scientists urge world to stop killer robots, and that's out of the Daily Star.
[01:58:10.135 --> 01:58:14.619]  Developing of weapons with degree of autonomous decision-making capacity could be feasible in years.
[01:58:14.619 --> 01:58:15.540]  It's already here.
[01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:16.220]  Not decades.
[01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:19.143]  And they warn that it's only a matter of if and when.
[01:58:19.143 --> 01:58:20.945]  There's major disasters with this.
[01:58:20.945 --> 01:58:22.946]  Stop killer robots.
[01:58:22.946 --> 01:58:24.068]  That's where we're going.
[01:58:24.068 --> 01:58:27.511]  And the establishment, it's not that I'm against technology.
[01:58:27.511 --> 01:58:30.954]  The establishment, I'm gonna come back and take calls, has shit.
[01:58:32.371 --> 01:58:35.734]  They're deciding to go with robots, not people, then we're not needed anymore.
[01:58:35.734 --> 01:58:37.215]  This is a conscious decision.
[01:58:37.215 --> 01:58:39.236]  Stay with us, folks.

[02:00:09.941 --> 02:00:11.982]  It's Friday.
[02:00:11.982 --> 02:00:13.103]  Big Brother.
[02:00:13.103 --> 02:00:14.904]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:14.904 --> 02:00:15.824]  Government cover-up.
[02:00:15.824 --> 02:00:16.805]  You wanna answer?
[02:00:16.805 --> 02:00:18.505]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:00:18.505 --> 02:00:20.166]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:20.166 --> 02:00:27.670]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.670 --> 02:00:28.931]  We've been building towards this.
[02:00:28.931 --> 02:00:31.692]  We've watched the world being collapsed by design.
[02:00:31.692 --> 02:00:33.713]  World government being openly announced.
[02:00:33.713 --> 02:00:34.554]  They're making their move.
[02:00:35.894 --> 02:00:36.334]  I know this.
[02:00:36.334 --> 02:00:38.535]  You lay down to this, it's going to be a lot worse on you.
[02:00:38.535 --> 02:00:41.416]  This segment and the next, we're going to take calls from Mr. Schneider, then let him go.
[02:00:41.416 --> 02:00:45.298]  I promise I will get into this giant 10th planet discovered.
[02:00:45.298 --> 02:00:46.578]  It's not really the 9th planet.
[02:00:46.578 --> 02:00:53.221]  They don't want to call it Planet X. So they delisted Pluto as the 9th, so they can say that this is the 9th.
[02:00:53.221 --> 02:00:58.883]  And it fits everything in Planet X. And I've always, not poo-pooed Planet X, but you know, everybody's saying it's coming to get us.
[02:00:58.883 --> 02:00:59.803]  I still don't believe that.
[02:00:59.803 --> 02:01:00.883]  But this, I don't know.
[02:01:00.883 --> 02:01:01.724]  This is pretty crazy.
[02:01:02.444 --> 02:01:07.188]  Richard Reeves got to ask Hillary a pretty big question on the hack of her emails.
[02:01:07.188 --> 02:01:08.929]  He's going to be joining us.
[02:01:08.929 --> 02:01:11.371]  We all, InfoWars correspondent.
[02:01:11.371 --> 02:01:16.556]  And so much more, Leanne McAdoo from Flint, Michigan, as we look at the collapsing infrastructure.
[02:01:16.556 --> 02:01:25.403]  I want to go to these calls, George, Chris, Tucker, Kevin, and Sherry, before you leave us quickly, but when we come back from break after a few calls, this is a short segment,
[02:01:26.857 --> 02:01:31.500]  I want to get into the infrastructure and how major cities and towns are just going to die.
[02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:34.042]  There's not going to be money to fix anything.
[02:01:34.042 --> 02:01:35.703]  And people need to get ready for this.
[02:01:35.703 --> 02:01:37.484]  And what areas will survive?
[02:01:37.484 --> 02:01:38.484]  What areas of the U.S.
[02:01:38.484 --> 02:01:40.025]  and other areas will be okay?
[02:01:40.025 --> 02:01:42.267]  I want to get your view on that right now.
[02:01:42.267 --> 02:01:46.490]  George in Connecticut, you're on the air with Mr. Schneider from the Economic Collapse Blog.
[02:01:46.490 --> 02:01:46.850]  Go ahead.
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:49.441]  Hi, I'm trying to find out.
[02:01:49.441 --> 02:01:53.966]  I'm out of the market completely, and I'm just wondering what areas might be fruitful.
[02:01:53.966 --> 02:02:00.313]  Let's face it, there are opportunities when everything's down, everybody's hair is on fire, and they're jumping out of windows.
[02:02:00.313 --> 02:02:01.855]  Buy up, whatever.
[02:02:01.855 --> 02:02:05.459]  Yeah, what do you think the bottom is, and what do you think is going to come back strong, Mr. Schneider?
[02:02:06.704 --> 02:02:11.629]  Well, I believe longer term, on a broader view, a huge bubble is bursting.
[02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:13.631]  We've got a lot farther to fall.
[02:02:13.631 --> 02:02:30.667]  In fact, if you look at historical averages, for example, the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio and others, from where we are right now, we've got to fall another one-third on the Dow just to get to a point where there's not a bubble, just to get back to the historical average where things make sense, where prices make sense.
[02:02:31.127 --> 02:02:42.491]  So that, you know, trying to jump in the market now and time the market and catch a little bit of an upswing is exceedingly dangerous and I wouldn't do it, I'll tell you that.
[02:02:42.491 --> 02:02:49.234]  So yeah, it's a time to, you know, avoid, you don't want to try to catch a falling knife like they say.
[02:02:49.794 --> 02:02:55.217]  So, we're in a bear market, a wave of panic.
[02:02:55.217 --> 02:02:56.617]  There's going to be ups and downs.
[02:02:56.617 --> 02:03:01.600]  Now, some of the biggest updates, in fact, the two largest stock market increases in all of U.S.
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:04.921]  history were right in the middle of the stock market crash of 2008.
[02:03:04.921 --> 02:03:07.582]  So, don't be fooled by a short-term upsurge.
[02:03:07.582 --> 02:03:10.644]  You know, now is a time of panic and of a bear market.
[02:03:10.644 --> 02:03:12.925]  So, be very careful.
[02:03:12.925 --> 02:03:16.867]  Sure, but long-term, obviously, the big globalist blue chips will come back, in my view.
[02:03:16.867 --> 02:03:17.587]  Do you disagree with that?
[02:03:18.916 --> 02:03:28.309]  Well, long term, we're going to see ups and downs, but in terms of where we were, I don't think we're ever going to get back there, barring some type of hyperinflation.
[02:03:28.309 --> 02:03:30.852]  And then, of course, your dollars won't be worth the same.
[02:03:30.852 --> 02:03:33.656]  A lot of folks think this is because of demographics.
[02:03:34.016 --> 02:03:36.477]  Hi Alex, this is addressed to you and your guests.
[02:03:58.231 --> 02:03:59.612]  You know, I know things are bad.
[02:03:59.612 --> 02:04:03.953]  Your listeners know that the condition of the world's economy is bad.
[02:04:03.953 --> 02:04:15.657]  But what is the character of your this year's economic bloom and doom predictions from your guests like, you know, Schneider, Dent, and Kaiser that is different from previous year's predictions?
[02:04:15.657 --> 02:04:18.818]  Well, sure, we've been warning of all this coming.
[02:04:18.818 --> 02:04:22.499]  They did unlimited money printing and manipulations.
[02:04:22.499 --> 02:04:27.121]  Most of the world's already in civil war or collapse, so our predictions have been incredibly accurate.
[02:04:29.170 --> 02:04:36.512]  You know, I'm not accusing you of crying wolf or anything like that, but how do we get a feeling that it's really going to hit the fan this time?
[02:04:36.512 --> 02:04:37.352]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:04:37.352 --> 02:04:39.273]  Stay there, stay there, stay there.
[02:04:39.273 --> 02:04:44.014]  I'm going to come back to you because you disagree, or it sounds like, or you're a skeptic, which is great.
[02:04:44.014 --> 02:04:46.355]  If you would have said that, I would have gone to you first.
[02:04:46.355 --> 02:04:47.435]  So stay there.
[02:04:47.435 --> 02:04:49.776]  Listen, brother, I hope I'm wrong.
[02:04:49.776 --> 02:04:56.118]  I see the government building bunkers, getting armored vehicles ready, and building FEMA camps and saying it's for patriots in Army documents.
[02:04:56.118 --> 02:04:57.118]  So something big's coming.
[02:04:58.567 --> 02:05:10.279]  Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton denied reports that her private email server had been hacked after being confronted by an InfoWars correspondent at a campaign stop in Iowa.
[02:05:10.279 --> 02:05:18.287]  Secretary Clinton, last week it was reported on InfoWars.com that your email server was hacked and you knowingly continued to use your email server.
[02:05:18.287 --> 02:05:19.428]  Can you comment on that?
[02:05:19.428 --> 02:05:20.469]  Yeah, it's totally untrue.
[02:05:20.589 --> 02:05:37.966]  The question stems from an exclusive InfoWars interview earlier this month in which former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino reported that Hillary continued using her private email to discuss classified information while knowing that her server had been compromised.
[02:05:38.166 --> 02:05:41.289]  The Clintons knew it was hacked, and she did it anyway.
[02:05:41.289 --> 02:05:47.195]  And not only is she not currently indicted or in prison, she's running to be President of the United States.
[02:05:47.195 --> 02:05:53.261]  If this is not a red flag to every Paul Revere out there that something's wrong, then you know what?
[02:05:53.261 --> 02:05:54.302]  The country is lost.
[02:05:54.302 --> 02:05:57.045]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com

[02:06:10.093 --> 02:06:15.516]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:06:58.192 --> 02:07:02.173]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:07:02.173 --> 02:07:08.474]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:07:08.474 --> 02:07:15.756]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:07:15.756 --> 02:07:24.558]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[02:07:24.878 --> 02:07:31.043]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:07:31.043 --> 02:07:35.867]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:07:35.867 --> 02:07:39.470]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:07:39.470 --> 02:07:41.372]  No needles, no injections.
[02:07:41.372 --> 02:07:43.013]  Don't take my word for it.

[02:07:53.321 --> 02:07:56.043]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:24.651 --> 02:08:29.192]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:29.192 --> 02:08:32.013]  Richard Reeves on the campaign trail.
[02:08:32.013 --> 02:08:50.856]  Infowars.com political correspondent who's been out there getting interviews with a lot of the candidates was able to ask Hillary Clinton a question that's gone viral where she denies that there was an email hack and we have a video report with the Secretary of Defense, former Secretary of Defense and others saying undoubtedly it happened.
[02:08:50.856 --> 02:08:53.137]  So everyone says her email got hacked but her.
[02:08:54.286 --> 02:08:58.789]  We have this from high-level Secret Service who came on the show, you name it.
[02:08:58.789 --> 02:09:01.111]  So, this is ongoing.
[02:09:01.111 --> 02:09:02.411]  I want to finish up with some calls.
[02:09:02.411 --> 02:09:05.573]  I want to give Chris some time here and then give Schneider some time.
[02:09:05.573 --> 02:09:07.575]  Chris called in and he said, you just joined us.
[02:09:08.905 --> 02:09:13.629]  How is this different from all of your past predictions that we're going to have big collapses?
[02:09:13.629 --> 02:09:31.605]  Like the one we had before 2008, or the last few years we're talking about unlimited derivatives, worse than 2008, banks, you know, digging in, government, Ministry of Defense reports in 2007 in England saying they think basically economic collapse 2016-2017, Pentagon saying the same thing, Pentagon
[02:09:35.686 --> 02:09:40.830]  Two years ago, trying to set up camps for three million people to, quote, re-educate the public.
[02:09:40.830 --> 02:09:44.752]  Now, I'm not saying they're going to use those, but that's at army.mil.
[02:09:44.752 --> 02:09:46.714]  I mean, that's sensational.
[02:09:46.714 --> 02:09:49.336]  Armored vehicles, saying they're for the veterans and gun owners.
[02:09:49.336 --> 02:09:52.177]  I have the sheriffs on video saying it all over the country.
[02:09:52.177 --> 02:09:54.659]  We told you, of course, before they admitted it, because we had the manuals.
[02:09:54.659 --> 02:09:58.562]  You know, we got the secret documents, remember, seven years ago?
[02:09:58.562 --> 02:10:01.224]  About for veterans and gun owners and Christians being the big enemy?
[02:10:02.558 --> 02:10:11.943]  So, it's kind of like knowing Hitler's going to invade France in 1939, but you don't know exactly when, and then finally it happens.
[02:10:11.943 --> 02:10:20.947]  Then when Soros runs around saying, run for the hills, collapse, and the Royal Bank of Scotland says sell everything, that's a quote two weeks ago.
[02:10:20.947 --> 02:10:22.808]  And then now the markets are plunging.
[02:10:22.808 --> 02:10:24.549]  I want to put a graph on screen for TV viewers.
[02:10:26.022 --> 02:10:27.183]  For radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[02:10:27.183 --> 02:10:28.083]  This is how I'll describe it.
[02:10:28.083 --> 02:10:29.144]  What are islands?
[02:10:29.144 --> 02:10:34.366]  They're not floating things that capsize like the congressman from Georgia says.
[02:10:34.366 --> 02:10:35.487]  Okay?
[02:10:35.487 --> 02:10:41.590]  They are mountains on the seafloor that have been thrust up by tectonic activity and
[02:10:42.635 --> 02:10:59.762]  If you're living up on the top of a hill or a mountain, and the water's rising slowly, and you say, oh, there's no economic crisis, you know, there's wars, 30-plus civil wars, mass death, doubling in people starving all over the world from, you know, 30 million, it's bad.
[02:10:59.762 --> 02:11:02.663]  And then somebody says, oh, where's this crash you're talking about?
[02:11:02.663 --> 02:11:03.904]  I don't know.
[02:11:03.904 --> 02:11:05.825]  Two years ago, restaurants in Austin had about
[02:11:07.051 --> 02:11:08.552]  Half of what they used to.
[02:11:08.552 --> 02:11:10.453]  Now they just don't have anybody, and a lot of them are closing.
[02:11:10.453 --> 02:11:12.715]  I mean, really good restaurants.
[02:11:12.715 --> 02:11:16.377]  Our audience has tripled the last year, but funds are coming in at the same level.
[02:11:16.377 --> 02:11:18.158]  Most of talk radio is going bankrupt.
[02:11:18.158 --> 02:11:19.760]  Media is going bankrupt everywhere.
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:22.141]  Carlos Slim has to prop up the New York Times.
[02:11:22.141 --> 02:11:26.884]  I mean, and then people just do this thing like, you know, we hear world government's coming.
[02:11:26.884 --> 02:11:27.365]  Where is it?
[02:11:27.365 --> 02:11:29.186]  It's been announced.
[02:11:29.186 --> 02:11:30.687]  We hear all this is going to happen.
[02:11:30.687 --> 02:11:31.567]  Where is it, Alex?
[02:11:31.567 --> 02:11:32.708]  We hear they're coming for the guns.
[02:11:32.708 --> 02:11:33.649]  Alex, where is it?
[02:11:33.649 --> 02:11:36.010]  They're coming for the guns!
[02:11:36.010 --> 02:11:36.210]  So,
[02:11:37.415 --> 02:11:42.197]  We're trying to stop the economic collapse, pointing out who's behind it to consolidate control.
[02:11:42.197 --> 02:11:45.819]  Schneider, you want to respond to Chris, and we'll give him the last word?
[02:11:45.819 --> 02:11:47.040]  Oh, I absolutely do.
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:51.822]  You know, a lot of people are so conditioned by the mainstream media telling them that everything's okay.
[02:11:51.822 --> 02:11:53.823]  But look at what's already happened.
[02:11:53.823 --> 02:12:00.726]  Like I mentioned earlier, since the middle of last year, June 2015, more than $15 trillion has been wiped out.
[02:12:00.726 --> 02:12:03.728]  We've entered a global bear market for stocks.
[02:12:04.188 --> 02:12:06.631]  One-fifth of all global stock market wealth is already gone.
[02:12:06.631 --> 02:12:08.553]  We only have four-fifths left.
[02:12:08.553 --> 02:12:11.035]  You know, how much more are we going to have to lose?
[02:12:11.035 --> 02:12:16.721]  Are we going to have to be down 30%, 40%, 50% before people finally admit that something's happening?
[02:12:16.721 --> 02:12:19.744]  You know, everyone agrees that junk bonds have crashed.
[02:12:19.744 --> 02:12:21.426]  Everyone agrees that oil has crashed.
[02:12:21.426 --> 02:12:25.070]  Everyone agrees that industrial commodities have already crashed.
[02:12:25.070 --> 02:12:27.252]  So I would encourage Chris to go to my website,
[02:12:27.492 --> 02:12:31.634]  Look at the things I've been warning about specifically for six months leading into this.
[02:12:31.634 --> 02:12:33.234]  I said this is the danger zone.
[02:12:33.234 --> 02:12:34.335]  We're entering the danger zone.
[02:12:34.335 --> 02:12:37.656]  It's going to continue as we go into 2016 and beyond.
[02:12:37.656 --> 02:12:41.818]  This is not a single day event or a single week event, but we're seeing a progression.
[02:12:41.818 --> 02:12:48.961]  And the things that we've seen so far in 2016 over the last few weeks are simply a logical progression of what's already been happening since the middle of 2015.
[02:12:48.961 --> 02:12:50.362]  And the elite have known it.
[02:12:50.942 --> 02:12:57.387]  And the elite have known it and have been letting a good crisis not go to waste and have been exacerbating much of it.
[02:12:57.387 --> 02:12:59.689]  Do you disagree with that statement?
[02:12:59.689 --> 02:13:00.410]  Oh, not at all.
[02:13:00.410 --> 02:13:10.798]  I think the elite very much look forward to using the coming crisis to advance their agenda and help promote their new world order because I think in many ways their agenda has stalled.
[02:13:10.798 --> 02:13:15.602]  So I think they're looking forward to a good crisis in order to do some things they've been waiting to do.
[02:13:15.982 --> 02:13:16.382]  Absolutely.
[02:13:16.382 --> 02:13:21.905]  It doesn't happen a lot, but sometimes somebody will walk over to my restaurant and knock my tea over, or they'll get in my face.
[02:13:21.905 --> 02:13:25.287]  It's usually one of the big liberal conferences in town or something, and I'm downtown.
[02:13:25.287 --> 02:13:26.928]  Or they'll go, boo, boo, boo!
[02:13:26.928 --> 02:13:28.589]  And they'll go, where's the martial law?
[02:13:28.589 --> 02:13:29.389]  Where's the collapse?
[02:13:29.389 --> 02:13:29.809]  Where is that?
[02:13:29.809 --> 02:13:30.290]  And I'm just like...
[02:13:31.150 --> 02:13:49.008]  I'm trying to stop it, but I mean, you know, untenable 2.2 quadrillion global we've been signed on to, Obamacare written to screw us, death panels, I mean, you know, again, baby parts being sold, I mean, people are so selfish that if they're doing okay, they think nothing's happening, or
[02:13:50.638 --> 02:13:53.519]  They think we're trying to destroy confidence.
[02:13:53.519 --> 02:13:59.522]  If we had a good system and people were attacking it, like when Soros 20 years ago was attacking things, I would say I was against it.
[02:13:59.522 --> 02:14:01.123]  You know, and I would try to promote confidence.
[02:14:01.123 --> 02:14:07.766]  But you can't have confidence in something that's designed to go belly up as the elite evacuate to armored redoubts.
[02:14:07.766 --> 02:14:09.706]  And I told people that six years ago.
[02:14:09.706 --> 02:14:11.687]  It's now mainstream news.
[02:14:11.687 --> 02:14:12.868]  Let's go ahead and go back to Chris.
[02:14:12.868 --> 02:14:15.149]  Chris, go ahead.
[02:14:15.149 --> 02:14:19.991]  OK, well, you know, those are really both effective responses, and I'm not that much in disagreement.
[02:14:20.976 --> 02:14:34.223]  But what I want to... My question for Schneider is how would he convey to his listeners that this time, this year, January 2016 is really different.
[02:14:34.223 --> 02:14:35.403]  He just said it's all here.
[02:14:35.403 --> 02:14:38.885]  The numbers are much worse.
[02:14:38.885 --> 02:14:40.646]  Okay, the numbers are much worse.
[02:14:40.646 --> 02:14:43.767]  Did Walmart close 260-something stores in 2008, bro?
[02:14:48.337 --> 02:14:52.539]  Right, okay, so it's accelerating, you're talking about bell curve acceleration of everything.
[02:14:52.539 --> 02:14:56.681]  Sir, the military is absolutely whacked out and freaked out, okay?
[02:14:56.681 --> 02:15:00.262]  I mean, you don't just think I just have Tim Kennedy in here in studio and hang out with him, do you?
[02:15:00.262 --> 02:15:03.244]  I mean, you don't just think that's the only special forces people?
[02:15:03.244 --> 02:15:05.205]  And generals and colonels and everybody?
[02:15:05.205 --> 02:15:08.606]  They are being told, get ready for total insanity.
[02:15:08.606 --> 02:15:12.268]  Now that doesn't mean it's going to happen, but they are geared up and ready.
[02:15:12.608 --> 02:15:25.833]  Because the globalists want to bring in martial law on the backs of a collapse and use it to bring in wealth redistribution, socialism, work brigades, national compulsory service in these new work brigades they've called for.
[02:15:25.833 --> 02:15:27.393]  This is when they want to break us.
[02:15:27.393 --> 02:15:28.734]  This is the big move.
[02:15:28.734 --> 02:15:32.455]  And they know the patriots and the governors are going to say no.
[02:15:33.035 --> 02:15:40.420]  So they're saying the veterans, the gun owners, the libertarians, the conservatives, the anti-globalists, Matt Grudge, Alex Jones, are the enemy.
[02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:42.021]  We need to shut them down.
[02:15:42.021 --> 02:15:43.522]  That's in the news now.
[02:15:43.522 --> 02:15:45.764]  And they've told Grudge they're coming after him next year.
[02:15:45.764 --> 02:15:48.466]  Supreme Court Justice has been told the green light.
[02:15:48.466 --> 02:15:49.907]  We're now 2016.
[02:15:49.907 --> 02:15:51.388]  And I hope we hold them back.
[02:15:51.388 --> 02:15:55.331]  You know, I liken this, what he's saying, it's a perception issue.
[02:15:56.363 --> 02:15:57.884]  Two, the enemy's at the gates.
[02:15:57.884 --> 02:15:58.865]  They've knocked holes in it.
[02:15:58.865 --> 02:16:00.666]  There's fiery arrows coming over.
[02:16:00.666 --> 02:16:04.209]  They've got sappers digging in under the walls.
[02:16:04.209 --> 02:16:07.131]  We're literally fighting for our lives here.
[02:16:07.131 --> 02:16:10.073]  And people are going, he claims there's an enemy on the other side.
[02:16:10.073 --> 02:16:10.633]  Arrows in one.
[02:16:12.155 --> 02:16:12.715]  Right by him.
[02:16:41.714 --> 02:16:42.595]  What's the big deal?
[02:16:42.595 --> 02:16:44.036]  I don't see anything going on!
[02:16:44.036 --> 02:16:45.737]  I don't know anything going on!
[02:16:45.737 --> 02:16:46.418]  And so great!
[02:16:46.418 --> 02:16:47.559]  Everything's fine!
[02:16:47.559 --> 02:16:47.839]  Love ya!
[02:16:47.839 --> 02:16:49.140]  Appreciate it, Chris.
[02:16:49.140 --> 02:16:50.921]  Sorry to go into that rant there, Mr. Schneider.
[02:16:50.921 --> 02:16:54.544]  It's just, uh... It's just, you know, oh yeah, they're selling baby parts.
[02:16:54.544 --> 02:16:55.205]  You're a liar.
[02:16:55.205 --> 02:16:57.126]  Okay, yeah, they actually are a big deal.
[02:16:57.126 --> 02:16:58.147]  You know?
[02:16:58.147 --> 02:17:02.671]  Uh, so... It's just at a certain point, I don't know what to say to people anymore.
[02:17:02.671 --> 02:17:02.971]  Go ahead.
[02:17:04.102 --> 02:17:05.103]  Oh, I agree with you, Alex.
[02:17:05.103 --> 02:17:06.564]  I mean, just look at Warren Buffett.
[02:17:06.564 --> 02:17:09.206]  If you ask Warren Buffett, well, did anything happen last year?
[02:17:09.206 --> 02:17:14.270]  Well, Warren Buffett lost $7.8 billion in 2015.
[02:17:14.270 --> 02:17:18.633]  So if you go up to Warren Buffett and say, oh, nothing happened, Warren Buffett, you might get punched in the face.
[02:17:18.633 --> 02:17:32.003]  I mean, it's happening, and yet people that, according to the Washington Post, the average American is plugged into some, watches about five hours of television a day, and then overall, the average American, one study found... Ten hours of screen time.
[02:17:33.442 --> 02:17:37.485]  You know, the average American is plugged into some form of media about 10 hours a day.
[02:17:37.485 --> 02:17:43.250]  And, you know, of course the mainstream media is telling them, oh, everything's fine, no problem, everything's roses.
[02:17:43.250 --> 02:17:48.775]  But meanwhile, all the real numbers, what's really happening, I mean, it's happening all around us, as you were just saying.
[02:17:49.901 --> 02:17:51.423]  It's unbelievable.
[02:17:51.423 --> 02:17:53.204]  Sir, I really appreciate you and your work.
[02:17:53.204 --> 02:17:54.425]  I'm going to try to get to these other callers.
[02:17:54.425 --> 02:17:55.266]  I know you've got to go.
[02:17:55.266 --> 02:17:56.187]  I've got to get to Richard Reeves.
[02:17:56.187 --> 02:17:59.250]  We'll get to other callers after you've gone, but Tucker and others.
[02:17:59.250 --> 02:18:03.975]  But thank you for the work you're doing and for us being able to carry your great articles at InfoWars.com.
[02:18:03.975 --> 02:18:04.896]  We'll talk to you again very soon.
[02:18:05.794 --> 02:18:06.114]  All right.
[02:18:06.114 --> 02:18:06.994]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:18:06.994 --> 02:18:08.135]  Thank you for having me on.
[02:18:08.135 --> 02:18:08.895]  God bless you.
[02:18:08.895 --> 02:18:18.037]  You know, folks, I sit there every night with making dinner with my children and I look at them and I think, is this house safe?
[02:18:18.037 --> 02:18:20.498]  You know, am I watching what's going on?
[02:18:20.498 --> 02:18:21.938]  Am I aware of my surroundings?
[02:18:21.938 --> 02:18:24.699]  Oh, my God, what is a collapse going to be like?
[02:18:24.699 --> 02:18:27.040]  And the water is coming up towards Austin.
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:30.441]  Texas is one of the safest, best areas.
[02:18:30.441 --> 02:18:34.102]  And, you know, I am sitting here just absolutely
[02:18:35.484 --> 02:18:39.506]  Hoping and praying that we don't have a really serious collapse.
[02:18:39.506 --> 02:18:43.309]  But, global markets are already collapsing.
[02:18:43.309 --> 02:18:45.490]  Economic development is collapsing.
[02:18:45.490 --> 02:18:47.892]  The family unit is collapsing.
[02:18:47.892 --> 02:18:49.312]  Our health is collapsing.
[02:18:49.312 --> 02:18:52.334]  Every metric, the corruption is insane.
[02:18:52.334 --> 02:18:54.496]  Heroin is all over our streets.
[02:18:54.496 --> 02:18:58.078]  ODing, you know, tens of thousands of people.
[02:18:58.078 --> 02:18:59.539]  Because the government ships heroin in.
[02:19:00.455 --> 02:19:01.735]  They publicly grow it.
[02:19:01.735 --> 02:19:04.616]  I mean, it's like, they publicly grow the opium.
[02:19:04.616 --> 02:19:09.277]  When the troops started speaking out against it, they just said, okay, we'll go on TV and admit we grow the opium.
[02:19:09.277 --> 02:19:18.440]  And in one week, ABC News, BBC, CBS, Fox, every channel, this was like five years ago, goes, we grow the opium and ship it out!
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:23.201]  Move along, move along!
[02:19:23.201 --> 02:19:25.522]  I mean, they've just got too sophisticated brainwashing systems.
[02:19:25.522 --> 02:19:26.722]  We're going to come back with Richard Reeves.
[02:19:27.699 --> 02:19:33.221]  Get his take on the Hillary thing, play the clip, and then come back and do a report on it that's been produced.
[02:19:33.221 --> 02:19:38.043]  And then we've got my son did a report on children in the TSA.
[02:19:38.043 --> 02:19:38.844]  Very powerful.
[02:19:38.844 --> 02:19:40.244]  It's going up on Infowars.com.
[02:19:40.244 --> 02:19:43.406]  It was on the Nightly News last night.
[02:19:43.406 --> 02:19:45.366]  It's all... Just listen.
[02:19:47.578 --> 02:19:56.587]  Okay, everything's pieces and cream, everything's fine, and it's totally normal for Europe to bring in 5 million refugees, many of which are Al-Qaeda and Al-Nusra, and it's okay they're running around shooting and killing everybody.
[02:19:56.587 --> 02:19:57.848]  I mean, what's wrong with that?
[02:19:57.848 --> 02:19:58.749]  Why are they doing that?
[02:19:58.749 --> 02:20:02.212]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:20:02.998 --> 02:20:03.638]  It's true.
[02:20:03.638 --> 02:20:07.780]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:20:07.780 --> 02:20:10.161]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:20:10.161 --> 02:20:14.962]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:20:14.962 --> 02:20:22.325]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA.
[02:20:22.645 --> 02:20:27.831]  Pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[02:20:38.604 --> 02:20:42.889]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[02:21:58.666 --> 02:22:05.370]  Chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair and compromises your immune system, making you more vulnerable to all diseases.
[02:22:05.370 --> 02:22:10.553]  Since poor diet, injuries or stress are all contributing factors, many people suffer from inflammation.
[02:22:10.553 --> 02:22:15.676]  Your body's number one means of neutralizing inflammation and the pain that it may be causing is glutathione.
[02:22:15.676 --> 02:22:20.019]  Glutathione is the body's number one peptide to neutralize free radicals and thus stop inflammation.
[02:22:20.239 --> 02:22:21.461]  Hi, my name is Jason.
[02:22:21.461 --> 02:22:22.582]  I'm 44 years old.
[02:22:22.582 --> 02:22:28.970]  For 10 years, I had been suffering from chronic pain in my abdomen and groin that radiated down into my feet.
[02:22:28.970 --> 02:22:36.299]  After three weeks on One World Way, the pain in my feet reduced by 50% and the overall pain in my body reduced significantly as well.
[02:22:36.299 --> 02:22:37.340]  I ran out of One World Way
[02:22:37.600 --> 02:22:38.821]  And the pain returned.
[02:22:38.821 --> 02:22:44.644]  I got another container and again, after three weeks, the pain reduced significantly throughout my body.
[02:22:44.644 --> 02:22:49.306]  I'd highly recommend One World Way to anyone dealing with chronic pain due to inflammation.
[02:22:49.306 --> 02:22:50.507]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.

[02:23:47.977 --> 02:23:49.440]  We're good to go.
[02:24:16.585 --> 02:24:22.291]  Richard Reeves is in Creston, Iowa, where Ben Carson is going to be speaking tonight.
[02:24:22.291 --> 02:24:25.274]  And you can see people being searched by the Secret Service there in the background.
[02:24:25.274 --> 02:24:26.775]  We can punch it up.
[02:24:26.775 --> 02:24:28.937]  Hey, Richard is right up there in the action.
[02:24:28.937 --> 02:24:32.300]  What a job the Secret Service was having to protect all those candidates.
[02:24:32.300 --> 02:24:35.223]  And boy, let me tell you, they are really worried about Trump.
[02:24:35.223 --> 02:24:36.244]  Somebody going after Trump.
[02:24:37.005 --> 02:24:39.787]  Because I heard some of the inside baseball from his campaign.
[02:24:39.787 --> 02:24:41.028]  It is wild.
[02:24:41.028 --> 02:24:42.249]  But there's Richard Reeves.
[02:24:42.249 --> 02:24:46.452]  We're going to go to the clip here in the next segment, but we'll show some of it as B-roll.
[02:24:46.452 --> 02:24:55.939]  But Hillary looked at you when you said InfoWars like she was Medusa, got very upset, rubbed on her lip, and then said, hey, I don't know anything about emails being hacked.
[02:24:55.939 --> 02:25:00.822]  Even though it's a national scandal, it's been confirmed, it's coming out in the Pentagon.
[02:25:00.822 --> 02:25:03.084]  Richard Reeves, great job there on the campaign trail.
[02:25:04.065 --> 02:25:04.765]  Alex, thank you.
[02:25:04.765 --> 02:25:06.647]  Richard Reeves with InfoWars.com.
[02:25:06.647 --> 02:25:13.971]  And yes, it did capture Hillary's attention last night when I mentioned InfoWars.com especially.
[02:25:13.971 --> 02:25:21.816]  And if you were watching the little demon behind her, his little devil wings started flapping real fast and he came around Hillary real quick to zoom in on me.
[02:25:21.816 --> 02:25:24.658]  So I knew it wasn't going to be much time to try to follow up.
[02:25:24.658 --> 02:25:28.720]  But definitely, they know who InfoWars.com is for sure.
[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:30.401]  There's no question on that.
[02:25:30.401 --> 02:25:31.922]  But I'll tell you folks,
[02:25:32.338 --> 02:25:38.681]  The way to ask Hillary a question is right now, between now and the caucuses, she's going to be here for a lot of events.
[02:25:38.681 --> 02:26:00.611]  You need to team up with a friend and put a question together and get on that, get in the front, get to the event about an hour and a half beforehand so you can get a good front row seat and that way you got a chance to ask Hillary a question because it's even tougher now because what happened, I've been to two Hillary events before this and the procedure was to have members of the audience
[02:26:01.055 --> 02:26:01.275]  I think?
[02:26:31.418 --> 02:26:34.167]  And wherever else that Hillary may appear.
[02:26:34.167 --> 02:26:36.976]  And let's get some real questions asked of Hillary right now because...
[02:26:37.549 --> 02:26:51.373]  Once Iowa and New Hampshire go by, I don't think anybody, no real normal human being, no real normal voter, is probably ever going to have an opportunity to ask Hillary any more questions here after these first few states come up.
[02:26:51.373 --> 02:26:52.613]  I was showing it earlier.
[02:26:52.613 --> 02:27:01.836]  Drudge had over 1,200,000 votes on his site, and Trump got the lion's share, and then Sanders, and then Cruz.
[02:27:05.183 --> 02:27:06.684]  Literally didn't even get one point.
[02:27:06.684 --> 02:27:07.124]  She got .88.
[02:27:07.124 --> 02:27:12.687]  So, I mean, and that's Democrats, you know, they're voting for Sanders.
[02:27:12.687 --> 02:27:13.868]  I mean, this lady is hated.
[02:27:13.868 --> 02:27:15.649]  Her own party's trying to dump her.
[02:27:15.649 --> 02:27:17.330]  They've got Biden in the wings.
[02:27:17.330 --> 02:27:20.051]  She is so close to being pushed over the edge right now.
[02:27:20.051 --> 02:27:23.133]  But the word is, she's got all this blackmail material on everybody.
[02:27:23.133 --> 02:27:28.176]  I mean, I can't believe that the establishment's putting more money into her than all other candidates combined.
[02:27:28.176 --> 02:27:32.298]  I mean, what's wrong with the Clinton voters out there?
[02:27:32.298 --> 02:27:33.119]  Or do they even exist?
[02:27:35.066 --> 02:27:36.247]  Well, they do exist.
[02:27:36.247 --> 02:27:50.113]  There's two or three hundred hardcore people lined up for the event yesterday and the broken coalition that Larry Nichols talks about, part of that coalition is the public educational system around the country.
[02:27:50.113 --> 02:28:03.339]  The New World Order controlled and manipulated public education system in our country is part of what is a national enemy, a national enemy to our country because they're the ones that are really lining up
[02:28:03.735 --> 02:28:08.518]  They think Hillary's going to hand them pay raises and retirements and all kinds of stuff.
[02:28:08.518 --> 02:28:13.641]  She's the Bilderberg member, she's the globalist, so they love her, but she's got to act like she's anti-establishment.
[02:28:13.641 --> 02:28:19.145]  But her supporters want her to be establishment and deliver her the goods, but the country's already going bankrupt.
[02:28:19.145 --> 02:28:23.448]  Don't they get we're coming to the end of the line, you know, like they have in the Traveling Wilbury song?
[02:28:25.236 --> 02:28:44.126]  Well, it is the end of the line, Alex, and I'll tell you, you know, I heard the Larry Nichols interview yesterday, and I recommend all of your audience make sure to go to Alex Jones' channel or find the archive and listen and or watch the Larry Nichols interview with Alex from yesterday, because he made a lot of great points talking about the broken coalition, etc., and also talking about how
[02:28:44.648 --> 02:28:52.212]  Republican establishment, Democrat establishment are both helping cover Hillary right now thinking they're going to be protected if she becomes president.
[02:28:52.212 --> 02:28:53.272]  Well, you know what?
[02:28:53.272 --> 02:28:59.575]  They're in a political sense, they're the walking dead because most likely a lot of these characters in the House and Senate
[02:28:59.835 --> 02:29:02.437]  They're going to get fired on this 2016 election cycle.
[02:29:02.437 --> 02:29:04.959]  The way that the votes are breaking down... I know, they're so dumb.
[02:29:04.959 --> 02:29:06.861]  I mean, I mean, they just go along with the system.
[02:29:06.861 --> 02:29:08.042]  And I'm not bashing Rand Paul.
[02:29:08.042 --> 02:29:14.487]  He's a great guy, but he listened to his advisors to be all nice and calm and all that stuff and not be like more like Trump.
[02:29:14.487 --> 02:29:16.769]  And they just then can't believe one that doesn't work.
[02:29:16.769 --> 02:29:21.413]  The system sabotages you when it's being friendly to you.
[02:29:21.413 --> 02:29:22.274]  Well, and that's right.
[02:29:22.274 --> 02:29:28.779]  And like I say, these guys that are in office right now, a lot of them are politically the dead men walking, the dead women walking.
[02:29:29.941 --> 02:29:33.244]  Because they're most likely, many of them are going to be sent home in this election cycle.
[02:29:33.244 --> 02:29:40.190]  And then, you know, if Lord willing, we get to 2018, 2020, even despite black box voting, the people are coming.
[02:29:40.190 --> 02:29:42.452]  The info warriors are taking action.
[02:29:42.452 --> 02:29:43.313]  The info warriors are showing up.
[02:29:43.313 --> 02:29:43.593]  That's right.
[02:29:43.593 --> 02:29:43.813]  Stay there.
[02:29:43.813 --> 02:29:44.374]  Stay there, Richard.
[02:29:44.374 --> 02:29:48.017]  I've got a few more questions about the campaign trail and the key caucuses that are coming up.
[02:29:48.017 --> 02:29:49.398]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.398 --> 02:29:51.940]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.940 --> 02:29:54.603]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.769 --> 02:30:04.911]  In early January, the hermit nation of North Korea announced that it had successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb.
[02:30:04.911 --> 02:30:09.112]  This would make the fourth successful test that the isolated nation has claimed.
[02:30:09.112 --> 02:30:19.076]  Analysts at the time said this was Kim Jong-un and a display of saber-rattling to mark his birthday and to highlight a rare ruling party congress scheduled for May, the first gathering of its kind in 35 years.
[02:30:20.336 --> 02:30:22.738]  But just yesterday, Fox News reported that U.S.
[02:30:22.738 --> 02:30:28.702]  diplomats have stepped up pressure on China to play a leading role in punishing North Korea for its most recent test.
[02:30:28.702 --> 02:30:29.162]  The U.S.
[02:30:29.162 --> 02:30:31.804]  is also stepping up its military presence in that region.
[02:30:31.804 --> 02:30:39.170]  There are now two aircraft carriers stationed near Tokyo, the latest containing 26 fighter jets, including the F-22 stealth aircraft.
[02:30:39.170 --> 02:30:39.570]  The U.S.
[02:30:39.570 --> 02:30:42.312]  military has stated that this is for training purposes only.
[02:30:42.492 --> 02:30:50.225]  But as the economy goes into free fall, could these training exercises provoke the nation of North Korea into carrying out real attacks?
[02:30:50.225 --> 02:30:53.371]  Stay tuned to InfoWars.com as more news breaks.
[02:30:53.371 --> 02:30:55.694]  Rob Due reporting for the InfoWars Nightly News.

[02:33:00.993 --> 02:33:03.894]  This is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[02:33:03.894 --> 02:33:07.976]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zones.
[02:33:07.976 --> 02:33:10.177]  The chair is against the wall.
[02:33:10.177 --> 02:33:11.878]  John has a long mustache.
[02:33:11.878 --> 02:33:15.259]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:33:15.259 --> 02:33:16.579]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans.
[02:33:16.579 --> 02:33:17.960]  Another day closer to victory.
[02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:22.222]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[02:33:34.716 --> 02:33:37.638]  And welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:37.638 --> 02:33:49.187]  We are broadcasting worldwide, about to air this piece that's up on Infowars.com, titled, Everyone But Hillary Thinks Her Email Was Hacked.
[02:33:49.187 --> 02:33:55.732]  And Richard Reeves reporting from Iowa, he's going to be covering the caucuses in the next two weeks there for us.
[02:33:56.773 --> 02:33:59.814]  Fellow Austinite, part of the Infowar for more than a decade.
[02:33:59.814 --> 02:34:07.417]  For folks that don't know who Richard is, he's working with us more now, as he did back then in the past, covering political events.
[02:34:07.417 --> 02:34:19.142]  Richard, looking at this, she's blackmailing everybody so they don't want to get rid of her, but at a certain point she commits so many crimes it discredits the system, so they're in a no-win situation.
[02:34:19.142 --> 02:34:20.843]  What's your view on that?
[02:34:20.843 --> 02:34:24.004]  They are in a no-win situation because the way I see it
[02:34:24.449 --> 02:34:45.817]  Is Barack Obama is looking at having a legacy after he's gone out of the presidency and he's staring Donald Trump in the face knowing that if Donald Trump is elected president, I think he's going to come full force and investigate Barack Obama from stem to start, everything from birth certificate to, you know, illegal, illegal immigration to fast and furious.
[02:34:45.817 --> 02:34:47.138]  Everything's going to be investigated.
[02:34:47.138 --> 02:34:50.619]  So Barack Obama has to be in a panic beforehand.
[02:34:51.067 --> 02:35:00.470]  It looked like Barack Obama could count on either Hillary coming in, being the new president, and or Jeb Bush, which, you know, Jeb Bush would tow the line for Barack Obama, surely.
[02:35:00.470 --> 02:35:02.490]  So I think he was planning on that happening.
[02:35:02.490 --> 02:35:17.034]  Now, I think what you've got is you've got Hillary Clinton in a panic, you've got Bill Clinton in a panic, you've got Barack Obama in a panic, and then you've got, you know, all of the executive staff that have ever worked for Barack Obama potentially have their stuff in a vice.
[02:35:17.034 --> 02:35:20.035]  This is an incredible time to be alive, and we have
[02:35:21.368 --> 02:35:26.330]  The National Review coming out, like a Declaration of Independence against Trump.
[02:35:26.330 --> 02:35:31.771]  Meanwhile, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, which goes back to Barry Goldwater.
[02:35:31.771 --> 02:35:35.652]  The true roots of modern libertarian conservatism coming out endorsing Trump.
[02:35:35.652 --> 02:35:36.913]  I know you support Trump.
[02:35:36.913 --> 02:35:40.674]  You've been a long-time libertarian activist trying to take over the Republican Party.
[02:35:40.674 --> 02:35:42.634]  You've been a delegate and things.
[02:35:42.634 --> 02:35:47.716]  Richard, you see Jeb Bush bragging, I don't care if I get 3%, I'm still going to get the nomination.
[02:35:47.716 --> 02:35:50.797]  You know, at a certain point, that's not going to fly with these arrogant people.
[02:35:51.777 --> 02:35:53.778]  And so why do you support Donald Trump?
[02:35:53.778 --> 02:35:59.081]  And is he making you more proud of the fact you support him or less with what he's doing?
[02:35:59.081 --> 02:36:01.363]  Well, I really do like Donald Trump right now.
[02:36:01.363 --> 02:36:04.464]  The tactic being utilized on Ted Cruz, I'm not a fan of.
[02:36:04.464 --> 02:36:08.927]  You and I have been in the Patriot movement for decades.
[02:36:08.927 --> 02:36:13.730]  You and I first met in the fall of 2001 after 9-11, September.
[02:36:13.730 --> 02:36:19.553]  And as a matter of fact, it was, you know, kind of an ironic coincidence that Planet X was the first thing I ever asked you about.
[02:36:19.912 --> 02:36:21.413]  And you're talking about it today.
[02:36:21.413 --> 02:36:23.494]  But I do like Donald Trump.
[02:36:23.494 --> 02:36:26.376]  I think he'll be the one that comes in there, really shakes things up.
[02:36:26.376 --> 02:36:32.020]  And I really do think, you know, if we want to have a good economy in the United States, that he's the man to bring it.
[02:36:32.020 --> 02:36:37.343]  That being said, the infighting amongst the patriot and info warrior community is deadly.
[02:36:37.343 --> 02:36:43.767]  So he needs to realize, I hope, he needs to realize that Ted Cruz is not the enemy.
[02:36:43.767 --> 02:36:45.008]  He's a friend.
[02:36:45.008 --> 02:36:48.430]  And, you know, the fact that Ted Cruz goes up there and nobody in the Senate likes him,
[02:36:48.737 --> 02:36:50.038]  That's a badge of honor.
[02:36:50.038 --> 02:36:57.063]  That's the type of thing that I would expect Alex Jones to do is to go up into the Senate and shake their tree.
[02:36:57.063 --> 02:36:58.003]  Well, that's right.
[02:36:58.003 --> 02:37:02.606]  And look, Rand Paul attacked Trump and his numbers plummeted.
[02:37:02.606 --> 02:37:04.107]  Now Cruz is doing it.
[02:37:04.107 --> 02:37:05.849]  And it's really stupid.
[02:37:05.849 --> 02:37:07.670]  I mean, Cruz is really smart.
[02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:12.653]  And I guess he just thinks to get the number one slot, he's got to gamble and try to take down Trump.
[02:37:12.653 --> 02:37:13.974]  So he knows it's dangerous.
[02:37:13.974 --> 02:37:14.795]  It's not working.
[02:37:14.795 --> 02:37:17.917]  His numbers have started going down since he started attacking two weeks ago.
[02:37:19.397 --> 02:37:24.700]  Well, in my book, you know, there's that old Rockefeller saying that competition is a sin.
[02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:27.462]  Well, we can have competition in the patriot community.
[02:37:27.462 --> 02:37:37.048]  Let's just make it, let's have respectful disagreements and not go, you know, nuclear-assaulted-Earth weapons against each other because, like I said, that's been destructive.
[02:37:37.389 --> 02:37:42.991]  We've had polls showing that about 70% of the electorate is ready to fire the establishment.
[02:37:42.991 --> 02:37:44.592]  That is fantastic news.
[02:37:44.592 --> 02:37:45.832]  Well, I mentioned the Drudge poll.
[02:37:45.832 --> 02:37:47.112]  Hillary didn't even get 1%.
[02:37:47.112 --> 02:37:48.973]  But Bernie, people say, oh, that's a Republican poll.
[02:37:48.973 --> 02:37:51.174]  No, it's a populist poll.
[02:37:51.174 --> 02:37:53.415]  Drudge is populist by any way you look at it.
[02:37:53.415 --> 02:37:55.555]  That's why he's so popular across the board.
[02:37:55.555 --> 02:37:56.256]  It's a poll.
[02:37:56.256 --> 02:37:59.357]  And Bernie Sanders came in second place behind Trump.
[02:37:59.357 --> 02:38:02.738]  So that ought to tell folks that's real Democrats and they're voting and they don't want Hillary.
[02:38:03.752 --> 02:38:05.994]  And Bernie does in a misguided fashion.
[02:38:05.994 --> 02:38:12.338]  You know, he's kind of exposing the New World Order powers of B, especially the financial powers of B. So he's kind of showing that.
[02:38:12.338 --> 02:38:25.386]  So that's another thing about Donald Trump is when Bernie Sanders is going to be out of the picture at some point, I think, you know, we're going to see Joe Biden trotted in or we're going to see Hillary indeed somehow, despite all this gravity against her, become the nominee.
[02:38:26.556 --> 02:38:30.923]  But you know, a lot of these folks that like Bernie, I think they could be leveraged to Donald Trump.
[02:38:30.923 --> 02:38:36.992]  That's another thing I like about Donald Trump, is that I think you'll see a lot of Democrats come across the aisle and vote for him.
[02:38:36.992 --> 02:38:38.875]  Well, national polls already show it.
[02:38:38.875 --> 02:38:41.179]  20% in Gallup polls say they'll vote for him right now and it's only going to grow.
[02:38:41.459 --> 02:38:42.519]  Great job Richard Reeves.
[02:38:42.519 --> 02:38:52.164]  We're going to go to this report tied in with your confrontation with Hillary yesterday and we'll continue to be checking in with you on the nightly news tonight and also right throughout Sunday.
[02:38:52.164 --> 02:38:56.826]  I want to get you back on and right through next week and into the caucuses and into these primaries.
[02:38:56.826 --> 02:38:57.887]  Okay?
[02:38:57.887 --> 02:38:58.267]  Very good.
[02:38:58.267 --> 02:38:58.867]  Thank you Alex.
[02:38:58.867 --> 02:38:59.187]  Thank you.
[02:38:59.187 --> 02:39:07.271]  There goes Richard Reeves from Iowa there at the Ben Carson event where people are already lining up hours before to go in and be searched by the Secret Service.
[02:39:10.109 --> 02:39:22.717]  Expanding on this, and we're going to get Leanne McAdoo on, on what she's learned there in Flint, Michigan, with the collapsing water system in a moment, then the fourth hour with David Knight.
[02:39:22.717 --> 02:39:32.844]  But when you really, really look at this, it is mind-boggling that people would actually support Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush.
[02:39:32.844 --> 02:39:34.145]  I mean, just give me a break.
[02:39:35.211 --> 02:39:39.412]  It shows you how just desperately stupid some people that are politically involved.
[02:39:39.412 --> 02:39:44.473]  That's folks that are politically involved that actually know how to tie their shoelaces and they still support these people.
[02:39:44.473 --> 02:39:49.174]  They get off on thinking they're invested in the system by going along with the candidate.
[02:39:49.174 --> 02:39:50.975]  So here is the report.
[02:39:50.975 --> 02:39:54.656]  Everybody but Hillary thinks her email was hacked.
[02:39:54.656 --> 02:39:55.716]  And we need to get this report out.
[02:39:55.716 --> 02:39:57.716]  We just tweeted it at RealAlexJones.
[02:39:57.716 --> 02:40:00.477]  Please retweet it because you're the real power of this broadcast.
[02:40:00.477 --> 02:40:01.357]  We salute you.
[02:40:01.357 --> 02:40:02.557]  We are brothers and sisters in arms.
[02:40:02.557 --> 02:40:04.578]  And then Leanne McAdoo will join us via Skype.
[02:40:06.414 --> 02:40:10.078]  We have breaking news from InfoWars.com.
[02:40:10.078 --> 02:40:19.169]  It seems that Richard Reeve, InfoWars.com political correspondent and reporter, was at an event where Hillary decided to take questions on the rope line.
[02:40:20.027 --> 02:40:21.809]  And this is what it's like, people.
[02:40:21.809 --> 02:40:25.112]  You get out, you get in the game, and you never know what can happen.
[02:40:25.112 --> 02:40:31.377]  Richard was following up on an interview that Dan Bongino did with Alex Jones back on January 14th.
[02:40:31.377 --> 02:40:34.400]  Secret Service, Hillary's email was hacked.
[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:45.009]  Last chapter in the book talks about the Clinton scandal, the Clinton email scandal, and a source fed to me and said, please, please, and by the way, Alex, an unimpeachable source by any measure,
[02:40:45.109 --> 02:40:48.770]  This is not some, you know, lunatic and fringe guy out there.
[02:40:48.770 --> 02:40:55.632]  This is a unimpeachable source said, not only was the email server hacked, which is breaking news.
[02:40:55.632 --> 02:40:57.252]  I'm actually surprised not more.
[02:40:57.252 --> 02:40:59.473]  A couple people have emailed me about the book who read that.
[02:40:59.473 --> 02:41:01.374]  I didn't make a big deal out of it at the time.
[02:41:01.374 --> 02:41:02.834]  But not only was it hacked, Alex.
[02:41:03.374 --> 02:41:06.038]  But the Clintons knew it was hacked.
[02:41:06.038 --> 02:41:07.199]  And they kept using it.
[02:41:07.199 --> 02:41:08.020]  Think about this.
[02:41:08.020 --> 02:41:10.223]  Think of how deranged this is, Alex.
[02:41:10.223 --> 02:41:21.998]  You have a woman running for President of the United States who traded our deepest national security secrets over a private server she knew wasn't secured and that nefarious actors were looking at the emails.
[02:41:22.598 --> 02:41:24.099]  And she did it anyway.
[02:41:24.099 --> 02:41:30.724]  And not only is she not currently indicted or in prison, she's running to be President of the United States.
[02:41:30.724 --> 02:41:37.069]  If this is not a red flag to every Paul Revere out there that something's wrong, then you know what?
[02:41:37.069 --> 02:41:38.690]  The country is lost at that point.
[02:41:38.690 --> 02:41:40.952]  Because when I heard the story, I couldn't believe it.
[02:41:41.212 --> 02:41:50.857]  So there's former Secret Service Dan Bongino saying from an impeachable source that the email server was hacked and that was breaking news last week.
[02:41:50.857 --> 02:41:56.480]  Now we have Richard Reeves in line at a Hillary Clinton event and he asks her the following question.
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:42:04.604]  Secretary Clinton, last week it was reported on Infowars.com that your email server was hacked and you knowingly continued to use your email server.
[02:42:04.604 --> 02:42:05.645]  Can you comment on that?
[02:42:05.645 --> 02:42:06.965]  Yeah, it's totally untrue.
[02:42:06.965 --> 02:42:07.666]  Totally untrue.
[02:42:07.666 --> 02:42:08.086]  Thanks guys.
[02:42:08.086 --> 02:42:08.686]  Okay, here we go.
[02:42:11.249 --> 02:42:20.117]  And this is 43 seconds of pure, pure gold from the way she scratches the side of her mouth to the looks on her staffers.
[02:42:20.117 --> 02:42:22.539]  You can see the one here in this picture.
[02:42:22.539 --> 02:42:26.723]  She is just totally disgusted that someone would dare ask a real question.
[02:42:26.723 --> 02:42:28.965]  The Secret Service guy, interestingly enough,
[02:42:29.625 --> 02:42:30.706]  He doesn't seem to care.
[02:42:30.706 --> 02:42:37.271]  I think he kind of likes the fact that this question was asked of Hillary Clinton.
[02:42:37.271 --> 02:42:40.534]  She says it's totally untrue, totally untrue.
[02:42:40.534 --> 02:42:42.256]  So she repeats this line.
[02:42:42.256 --> 02:42:43.797]  Let's look at the evidence.
[02:42:43.797 --> 02:42:46.499]  Politico, October 8, 2015.
[02:42:46.499 --> 02:42:50.022]  Clinton server faced hacking from China, South Korea, and Germany.
[02:42:51.576 --> 02:43:04.965]  The contractor SECNAP Network Security identified the hacks, but according to internal emails cited and briefly quoted in the Johnson letter, Clinton's email server may have lacked the threat detection program for three months.
[02:43:04.965 --> 02:43:07.106]  And here's Breitbart from November 1st.
[02:43:07.106 --> 02:43:10.008]  Hillary Clinton got hacked email from her friend.
[02:43:10.008 --> 02:43:11.349]  That's totally untrue.
[02:43:11.349 --> 02:43:20.956]  Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton opened an email message on her private account, saw that she had received a virus infected link, and replied to her friend that she had been hacked.
[02:43:21.756 --> 02:43:23.157]  Another article from Breitbart.
[02:43:23.157 --> 02:43:24.137]  Let's stop there.
[02:43:24.137 --> 02:43:24.938]  Hillary Clinton.
[02:43:24.938 --> 02:43:26.438]  That's only half the video.
[02:43:26.438 --> 02:43:30.920]  This video needs to go viral.
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:35.302]  On major websites, news sites, because it just goes on where Hillary admits she got hacked.
[02:43:35.302 --> 02:43:36.763]  People say she got hacked.
[02:43:36.763 --> 02:43:38.344]  The Pentagon says she got hacked.
[02:43:38.344 --> 02:43:40.585]  The former Secretary of Defense says she got hacked.
[02:43:40.585 --> 02:43:45.587]  And then it shows her assistants freak out.
[02:43:45.587 --> 02:43:49.109]  Freak out that someone could dare get through and ask a real question.
[02:43:51.940 --> 02:43:59.406]  And again, the Secret Service knows what a bad lady she obviously is and is aware of what's going on.
[02:43:59.406 --> 02:44:02.048]  We're going to shift gears but we're going to cover more of this in the fourth hour.
[02:44:02.048 --> 02:44:09.873]  I'm also going to shoot a special report on this 10th planet that's been discovered and more about it because it's so interesting.
[02:44:09.873 --> 02:44:12.795]  We're going to get more into Snowmageddon in the next hour.
[02:44:12.795 --> 02:44:14.577]  People are saying, you know, Feds save us.
[02:44:15.933 --> 02:44:23.380]  The federal government can't even get light bulbs in their buildings half the time, and people defecate in the hallways all over federal buildings because they're so insane.
[02:44:23.380 --> 02:44:24.101]  Many of them.
[02:44:24.101 --> 02:44:28.085]  They can't get rid of miscreant, mentally ill federal employees.
[02:44:28.085 --> 02:44:35.251]  I mean, you know, they couldn't do anything in Katrina but take your guns, but oh, they're going to save you on the East Coast.
[02:44:35.251 --> 02:44:37.874]  It's local government's people that are all being sucked dry.
[02:44:41.385 --> 02:44:45.569]  And I noticed McAdoo's Skype was fuzzy earlier, so I was going to go to her once it got clear.
[02:44:45.569 --> 02:44:46.851]  It got crystal clear and then cut out.
[02:44:46.851 --> 02:44:48.613]  We're going to get her back on from Flint, Michigan.
[02:44:49.995 --> 02:45:12.913]  Briefly, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to see this show, have reporters be able to travel to Europe, travel to Latin America, travel to other places, become a member at PrisonPlanet.tv, $5.95 a month, 20 people can use your membership, see the nightly news, the commercial-free videocast, all of it, special reports, PrisonPlanet.tv, do it today, and today, speaking of a day, 15

[02:45:29.430 --> 02:45:31.011]  Also special edition.

[02:45:34.334 --> 02:45:36.176]  Just check it out for yourself.
[02:45:36.176 --> 02:45:37.257]  Well, Leanne McAdoo.
[02:45:38.595 --> 02:45:40.296]  Leanne McAdoo joins us from Flint, Michigan.
[02:45:40.296 --> 02:45:41.798]  She's filed a lot of reports.
[02:45:41.798 --> 02:45:43.820]  She'll be filing one for the Nightly News tonight.
[02:45:43.820 --> 02:45:46.362]  Obviously, the numbers are a lot higher than 10 people dying from poisoning.
[02:45:46.362 --> 02:45:48.103]  People's dogs are dying.
[02:45:48.103 --> 02:45:54.329]  She's now been in probably the most dangerous, most dilapidated city of any size in the United States.
[02:45:54.329 --> 02:45:58.933]  Again, we see folks walking around back there in the background.
[02:45:58.933 --> 02:46:01.455]  Leanne, where are you right now in Flint, and what have you discovered?
[02:46:02.432 --> 02:46:04.372]  Well I'm here in downtown Flint.
[02:46:04.372 --> 02:46:06.833]  We are at the restaurant that we were at yesterday.
[02:46:06.833 --> 02:46:15.715]  We spoke to that business owner that said that he had prepped his outfit years before because he didn't trust the government when they said that the water was completely fine.
[02:46:15.715 --> 02:46:18.216]  So he outfitted his whole place with reverse osmosis.
[02:46:18.216 --> 02:46:22.277]  So we're here once again today in downtown Flint.
[02:46:22.277 --> 02:46:28.178]  And earlier this morning we were driving around getting some drone footage of some of these dilapidated neighborhoods.
[02:46:28.758 --> 02:46:33.381]  And what we learned is it looks like people have huge lots in their yard.
[02:46:33.381 --> 02:46:39.346]  And in fact, what that is, is thousands of homes have been completely razed.
[02:46:39.346 --> 02:46:47.331]  And so it looks like people have huge plots of land when really it's that there's been hundreds of thousands of homes just completely razed.
[02:46:47.331 --> 02:46:52.115]  So you're not even actually seeing the devastation because they've, you know, demolished them all.
[02:46:52.782 --> 02:47:01.064]  It's pretty kind of sad, because when you take a look around, it really kind of reminds you of that old America, you know, that Americana, and it's being bulldozed.
[02:47:03.066 --> 02:47:04.947]  Well, NAFTA and GATT killed Flint.
[02:47:04.947 --> 02:47:06.248]  It really damaged Detroit.
[02:47:06.248 --> 02:47:07.388]  I hope Detroit can come back.
[02:47:07.388 --> 02:47:13.811]  I think Michiganders are great people, but you add big socialist unions, the Democratic Party to the mix, it's a big problem.
[02:47:13.811 --> 02:47:15.772]  Have we dug into whose fault?
[02:47:15.772 --> 02:47:22.435]  I mean, I know it's the fault of the deindustrialization, the water problems, the corruption in government, but is it the governor's overall fault?
[02:47:22.435 --> 02:47:25.257]  Is it the mayor in the buck passing, or is it both sides?
[02:47:26.596 --> 02:47:37.864]  Well, even the emergency manager that came in, this decision to switch over the water from Detroit to the Flint River had already been made prior to that emergency manager being put in place.
[02:47:37.864 --> 02:47:42.407]  But the issue was that Detroit was really raising the prices of water here.
[02:47:42.407 --> 02:47:52.794]  People are saying that their water bill, we spoke to an angry mother last night, we uploaded that video this morning, her water bill is $60 every month before she even turns the water on.
[02:47:52.794 --> 02:47:56.236]  They're paying the highest water rates in the country for poison.
[02:47:56.903 --> 02:48:06.652]  And so that was one of the reasons why they originally wanted to switch off of the Detroit water was because they were paying these astronomical rates because Detroit... Well, that's how it happens in third world countries.
[02:48:06.652 --> 02:48:07.153]  Right.
[02:48:07.153 --> 02:48:15.401]  They even made a James Bond movie, the one before the last, about a group in Latin America turning off the river to bankrupt the city and then taking it over.
[02:48:15.401 --> 02:48:19.625]  Well, that's actually what they do in the IMF and World Bank plans that got leaked in 2002.
[02:48:19.625 --> 02:48:20.926]  This is what they actually do.
[02:48:21.943 --> 02:48:23.665]  Yeah, and you can see that here.
[02:48:23.665 --> 02:48:24.606]  We spoke with a gentleman.
[02:48:24.606 --> 02:48:27.089]  He's kind of the last man standing.
[02:48:27.089 --> 02:48:33.135]  They're trying to clear out the entire area and turn it into a green space because it's so contaminated.
[02:48:33.135 --> 02:48:41.464]  You have GM and Buick, these other companies, they had these entire industrial spaces and now they're completely cleared out and they left
[02:48:42.048 --> 02:48:45.510]  Just massive waste and it's totally contaminated.
[02:48:45.510 --> 02:48:48.171]  So they're trying to clear out entire neighborhoods.
[02:48:48.171 --> 02:48:49.592]  Well, Leanne, here's the allegory.
[02:48:49.592 --> 02:48:52.233]  I want to see if this rings true with you or the folks you've been talking to.
[02:48:52.233 --> 02:48:58.016]  You're going to come back and put all these reports together in a big special report boil down all this HD drone footage.
[02:48:59.835 --> 02:49:03.439]  America is kind of being seen as Flint or as Michigan itself.
[02:49:03.439 --> 02:49:06.422]  That's the way we're going to go under globalist looting.
[02:49:06.422 --> 02:49:08.964]  We're a zone where this has been decided to do.
[02:49:08.964 --> 02:49:11.767]  And as long as you're a globalist, you can be as toxic as you want.
[02:49:11.767 --> 02:49:17.233]  Then they'll use environmental regulations to shut down all their competition and, you know, harass people with the Green Police.
[02:49:17.233 --> 02:49:21.477]  And then, of course, all the other big companies will just rig everything like Volkswagen got caught doing.
[02:49:22.378 --> 02:49:24.399]  I mean, it also comes down to the people.
[02:49:24.399 --> 02:49:26.419]  God helps those that help themselves.
[02:49:26.419 --> 02:49:36.041]  I'm sorry, but, I mean, if it's toxic waste everywhere, if you live on a landfill, if your kids are deformed, if everybody's dying and being poisoned, why don't they move out?
[02:49:36.041 --> 02:49:37.602]  I don't want to hear they're too poor.
[02:49:37.602 --> 02:49:40.822]  Latin Americans are moving out because they live in hell.
[02:49:40.822 --> 02:49:42.903]  I mean, why don't they move to another state?
[02:49:44.750 --> 02:50:01.039]  And the other thing that we learned, we had a woman tell us last night that even if she went to go try and dig a well deep enough that they could hit pure water or try to do some type of system where they could be collecting rainwater, getting their own water, own fresh water, the city will come and condemn their home.
[02:50:01.039 --> 02:50:07.103]  So you're not allowed to unplug from the municipal water supply, even though they know it's poison, they're charging them.
[02:50:07.845 --> 02:50:08.245]  I don't know.
[02:50:22.421 --> 02:50:27.282]  Well, the drone footage you got, that Mr. Zimmerman got, is world class.
[02:50:27.282 --> 02:50:35.565]  And it's like a science fiction movie, because even in downtown at rush hour, right at dusk, there's hardly any cars driving around.
[02:50:35.565 --> 02:50:40.006]  I mean, I expect to see zombies running around here any minute, screaming brains.
[02:50:40.939 --> 02:50:42.860]  No, you nailed it.
[02:50:42.860 --> 02:50:44.140]  That's what it feels like here.
[02:50:44.140 --> 02:50:48.721]  It's like it's 1940 or 50 or something, way back in the day before.
[02:50:48.721 --> 02:50:49.522]  Well, stay there, Leanne.
[02:50:49.522 --> 02:50:51.142]  We're going to come back to you in a moment.
[02:50:51.142 --> 02:50:53.163]  And then, of course, the fourth hour calls and more.
[02:50:53.163 --> 02:50:56.444]  But I tell you, she met a guy that didn't trust the government, filtered his water.
[02:50:56.444 --> 02:50:57.444]  What a crazy person.
[02:50:58.743 --> 02:51:00.424]  Are you looking to sell body armor?

[02:52:58.399 --> 02:53:02.000]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?

[02:53:59.554 --> 02:54:02.315]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:54:02.315 --> 02:54:06.176]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:08.194 --> 02:54:16.459]  By the way, we have announced the finalists for the Hillary Clinton contest, and on Sunday I will announce first, second, and third place winner.
[02:54:16.459 --> 02:54:18.520]  But first place gets five grand.
[02:54:18.520 --> 02:54:23.723]  And we did this, of course, because a few months ago she started trying to have people fired or shut down that made fun of her at comedy clubs.
[02:54:23.723 --> 02:54:26.364]  They had her official campaign, Threaten Comedy Clubs.
[02:54:26.364 --> 02:54:29.326]  So we did this and got dozens of really great videos.
[02:54:29.326 --> 02:54:33.769]  The three finalists, I'll tell you who the winners are in order, but these are the winners, are up on
[02:54:34.329 --> 02:54:35.810]  Infowars.com right now.
[02:54:35.810 --> 02:54:47.598]  And I wasn't going to announce it in early January, but I wanted to have time, because there were so many hundreds of videos, to play at least 20 or so on the nightly news, and some here on the radio and TV show, because they're just excellent.
[02:54:47.598 --> 02:54:50.520]  And it stands up against her in a big way.

[02:56:41.799 --> 02:56:42.740]  And going back to Leanne,
[02:56:43.983 --> 02:56:44.724]  In Flint, Michigan.
[02:56:44.724 --> 02:56:59.857]  Leanne, I made the joke going out to break, and some people probably think I'm being serious, so like, you met a crazy man who years ago didn't believe the government about the water in Flint because it made everybody feel so sick and tasted horrible, and he, you know, filtered his water before they admitted it was killing people.
[02:56:59.857 --> 02:57:01.258]  There's a sacrament.
[02:57:01.258 --> 02:57:02.339]  That is a religious thing.
[02:57:02.339 --> 02:57:04.361]  We're going to come back for five more minutes and have you comment on this.
[02:57:06.035 --> 02:57:15.199]  Where I go into liberal restaurants, socialist restaurants, and I always know, it's happened about 15 times over the years before I figured it out, and they go, sorry, we don't have bottled water, just good old tap.
[02:57:15.199 --> 02:57:17.721]  And it's always at liberal, trendy places.
[02:57:17.721 --> 02:57:19.161]  So I started saying, why?
[02:57:19.161 --> 02:57:25.524]  They go, well, number one, bottled water isn't any better, and it's bad for the environment, and tap water is good.
[02:57:25.524 --> 02:57:32.888]  And it's this belief that tap water's the best there is, and you can trust it, when they add all these poisons to it, and it's their religion, they're a cult!
[02:57:33.248 --> 02:57:38.931]  We're gonna drink the government water when our own science czar says it's meant to brain damage me.
[02:57:38.931 --> 02:57:41.733]  Fulsadum tells me to jump off a cliff, I do it.
[02:57:41.733 --> 02:57:44.194]  Jim Jones tells me to drink cyanide, I do it.
[02:57:44.194 --> 02:57:46.076]  These people are cult members!
[02:57:46.076 --> 02:57:47.576]  Go ahead, Leigh-Anne.
[02:57:47.576 --> 02:57:50.418]  Well, yeah, and I actually just watched a video of the governor.
[02:57:50.418 --> 02:57:55.181]  He was being asked by a journalist, you know, would you allow your grandchild to bathe in that water, and he said yes.
[02:57:55.902 --> 02:57:59.126]  Yes, because the scientists are telling us that it's safe now.
[02:57:59.126 --> 02:57:59.988]  And they're like, really?
[02:57:59.988 --> 02:58:02.471]  I wouldn't let my child bathe in that water.
[02:58:02.471 --> 02:58:05.835]  You know, I wouldn't let my child suck on a Chinese toy.
[02:58:05.835 --> 02:58:08.579]  Why am I going to let him sit in a lead-filled bathtub?
[02:58:08.579 --> 02:58:12.665]  And the governor's just like, scientists tell us it's okay now.
[02:58:12.665 --> 02:58:13.406]  It's okay now.
[02:58:14.273 --> 02:58:16.014]  Oh yeah, that's kind of like CBS News.
[02:58:16.014 --> 02:58:18.535]  Mercury, the feds say now, good for children's brains.
[02:58:18.535 --> 02:58:19.395]  Yeah, just a little bit.
[02:58:19.395 --> 02:58:21.296]  I mean, I actually have the clip if you don't believe me, listeners.
[02:58:21.296 --> 02:58:23.516]  I mean, I played it probably 500 times.
[02:58:23.516 --> 02:58:24.137]  Mercury's good.
[02:58:24.137 --> 02:58:26.598]  We're going to come back with Mercury's Good For You.
[02:58:26.598 --> 02:58:28.138]  It helps your brain.
[02:58:28.138 --> 02:58:35.741]  And we're also going to have the clip of, here's actually Hillary's campaign manager inviting one of the members during the break to get on an elevator.
[02:58:36.222 --> 02:58:38.106]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[02:58:38.106 --> 02:58:40.471]  There's actually Obama with a wig on.
[02:58:40.471 --> 02:58:41.974]  Come to me, my child.

[02:59:50.518 --> 03:00:01.712]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.712 --> 03:00:04.875]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:08.257 --> 03:00:13.178]  Now, Barack Obama famously, when he was a community organizer, he used to have long hair.
[03:00:13.178 --> 03:00:16.859]  This is satire, folks, before the New York Times says it's real.
[03:00:16.859 --> 03:00:24.600]  And, you know, he ran into a guy trying to break into one of the community centers and he wanted to just show him the power of the Democratic Party.
[03:00:24.600 --> 03:00:28.921]  And so they had one of the staffers, you know, just come on down to bring him a cup of coffee.
[03:00:28.921 --> 03:00:34.382]  And this is when Barack Obama, you know, just was talking to one of the staffers inside, hidden video.
[03:00:34.382 --> 03:00:34.703]  Here it is.
[03:00:38.248 --> 03:00:39.409]  You killed my father!
[03:00:39.409 --> 03:00:41.351]  You killed my people!
[03:00:41.351 --> 03:00:43.412]  You took my father's sword!
[03:00:43.412 --> 03:00:48.116]  He took the guns!
[03:00:48.116 --> 03:00:49.497]  It must have been when I was younger.
[03:00:49.497 --> 03:00:55.362]  There was a time, boy, when I searched for steel.
[03:00:55.362 --> 03:01:01.046]  And steel meant more to me than gold or jewels.
[03:01:01.046 --> 03:01:03.768]  The Riddle of Steel.
[03:01:03.768 --> 03:01:04.709]  Ah, you know it.
[03:01:04.709 --> 03:01:05.390]  Yes.
[03:01:06.485 --> 03:01:09.707]  You know what it is, don't you, boy?
[03:01:09.707 --> 03:01:11.549]  Shall I tell you?
[03:01:11.549 --> 03:01:15.472]  It's the least I can do.
[03:01:15.472 --> 03:01:18.153]  Steel isn't strong, boy.
[03:01:18.153 --> 03:01:20.875]  Flesh is stronger.
[03:01:20.875 --> 03:01:25.058]  Look around you.
[03:01:25.058 --> 03:01:26.499]  There.
[03:01:26.499 --> 03:01:29.001]  On the rocks.
[03:01:29.001 --> 03:01:32.003]  That beautiful girl.
[03:01:32.003 --> 03:01:32.644]  Come to me, my child.
[03:01:34.366 --> 03:01:37.788]  Come to me with Obamacare, fluoride water, vaccines.
[03:01:37.788 --> 03:01:41.750]  Ah, I love you, liberal.
[03:01:41.750 --> 03:01:43.610]  That is power.
[03:01:43.610 --> 03:01:46.432]  That is strength, boy.
[03:01:46.432 --> 03:01:48.613]  That is power.
[03:01:48.613 --> 03:01:51.154]  The strength and power of flesh.
[03:01:51.154 --> 03:01:52.054]  That's right.
[03:01:52.054 --> 03:01:55.896]  What is steel compared to the hand that wheels it?
[03:01:55.896 --> 03:01:56.617]  Alright, let's go to land.
[03:01:57.819 --> 03:02:00.540]  Leon, I wanted to show Democratic Party Brainwashing Center.
[03:02:00.540 --> 03:02:01.720]  That's power they've got.
[03:02:01.720 --> 03:02:02.741]  We joke though.
[03:02:02.741 --> 03:02:04.521]  I mean, we know fluoride's brain damaging.
[03:02:04.521 --> 03:02:05.041]  They admit it.
[03:02:05.041 --> 03:02:13.164]  But the liberals literally take it as a sacrament and then will quote Dr. Strangelove back at me and hiss at me and just run around celebrating their fluoride.
[03:02:14.284 --> 03:02:27.588]  Right, well even if you show them the hazardous label that comes on hydrofluorosilicic acid, that it'll burn you, don't inhale it, it'll burn your eyes, burn your flesh, but it's okay to put your drinking water, keep your teeth nice and sparkly.
[03:02:27.588 --> 03:02:31.029]  Come to me, come to me my child.
[03:02:31.029 --> 03:02:35.270]  Well, in addition to, you know, drinking our filtered water here, we have also been
[03:02:36.411 --> 03:02:37.692]  Loading up on the Deep Cleanse.
[03:02:37.692 --> 03:02:40.555]  We brought this with us especially because, you know, you just never know.
[03:02:40.555 --> 03:02:45.040]  We got to eat here, we have to drink here, so... Leigh-Anne, you're glowing, too.
[03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:47.302]  You did your detox with Deep Cleanse and it had a big effect.
[03:02:47.302 --> 03:02:50.605]  I know we're going to do an infomercial here, but you're sold on the products.
[03:02:50.605 --> 03:02:52.487]  Be honest, though, about Superfemale Vitality.
[03:02:52.487 --> 03:02:54.008]  Does it work?
[03:02:54.008 --> 03:02:55.370]  It absolutely works.
[03:02:55.370 --> 03:03:00.815]  Like I said, I had to kind of come down off it after I was single there, but I'm back on it.
[03:03:02.535 --> 03:03:05.096]  Well, a little racy there.
[03:03:05.096 --> 03:03:06.817]  Okay, all right.
[03:03:06.817 --> 03:03:10.880]  Leanne, I mean about energy- I'm back in the saddle as they say.
[03:03:10.880 --> 03:03:11.880]  Oh my gosh.
[03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:13.621]  But I mean, I don't know what you're talking about.
[03:03:13.621 --> 03:03:18.044]  Energy-wise though, energy-wise, did it help you that way, exercise?
[03:03:19.286 --> 03:03:19.827]  Absolutely.
[03:03:19.827 --> 03:03:20.887]  Helped me with energy.
[03:03:20.887 --> 03:03:23.790]  Like I said, I've been doing yoga now pretty much every single day.
[03:03:23.790 --> 03:03:26.932]  And the confidence, and that's really what it was for me.
[03:03:26.932 --> 03:03:30.755]  It was just like the confidence, the sexiness, and you know, you just want to go out.
[03:03:30.755 --> 03:03:32.737]  Well, that's what Shane Steiner said.
[03:03:32.737 --> 03:03:36.100]  It was the moon enhancement for him, just lifting weights.
[03:03:36.580 --> 03:03:38.221]  And that's what it does, folks.
[03:03:38.221 --> 03:03:40.303]  It is a mood enhancer with natural herbs.
[03:03:40.303 --> 03:03:41.144]  It's really strong.
[03:03:41.144 --> 03:03:42.985]  It's really serious.
[03:03:42.985 --> 03:03:43.745]  And it's not a game.
[03:03:43.745 --> 03:03:45.086]  Infowarsandlife.com.
[03:03:45.086 --> 03:03:45.787]  It's 15% off.
[03:03:45.787 --> 03:03:46.708]  It ends today.
[03:03:46.708 --> 03:03:49.950]  But getting past that and closing, what else are you going to have for us on the Nightly News?
[03:03:49.950 --> 03:03:50.951]  What else have you discovered?
[03:03:52.247 --> 03:03:58.628]  Well, we've got a lot of great footage coming your way just so you can sort of see the real deal here with America, what's going on.
[03:03:58.628 --> 03:04:03.329]  We've talked to a few really very furious mothers.
[03:04:03.329 --> 03:04:07.210]  We felt like they were the ones who are really kind of getting things done here.
[03:04:07.210 --> 03:04:13.691]  A lot of angry people and it's the moms who are able to say, why are you not allowing me to protect my children?
[03:04:13.691 --> 03:04:18.352]  And the state is basically coming on and the media is coming on and telling them it's perfectly fine.
[03:04:18.872 --> 03:04:22.917]  You just don't give your children hot baths, and it's 10 degrees outside.
[03:04:22.917 --> 03:04:27.502]  And they're telling them that they can't give their kids hot baths and things like that, as if this is a solution.
[03:04:27.502 --> 03:04:30.225]  Meanwhile, they're... Why don't they just drink it when they die?
[03:04:30.225 --> 03:04:32.647]  That's the freedom of life that the government gives them.
[03:04:32.647 --> 03:04:34.069]  Thulsa Doom said it was okay.
[03:04:34.761 --> 03:04:35.261]  Yeah.
[03:04:35.261 --> 03:04:41.967]  I mean, that's pretty much the solution that they're giving them, is that they're trying to force this city to shut down, basically.
[03:04:41.967 --> 03:04:44.790]  It's almost if they don't want to help you, we're going to poison you.
[03:04:44.790 --> 03:04:46.411]  It's time to clear out of here.
[03:04:46.411 --> 03:04:50.054]  Well, I think that's what it's coming down to, and folks need to understand that's what the government's doing to them.
[03:04:50.054 --> 03:04:51.035]  Leigh Ann, thank you so much.
[03:04:51.035 --> 03:04:51.535]  Great job.
[03:04:51.535 --> 03:04:54.398]  You and Mr. Zimmerman, keep it up.
[03:04:54.398 --> 03:04:55.939]  Folks, David Knight's coming up.
[03:04:55.939 --> 03:04:57.340]  We'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:04:57.340 --> 03:04:57.681]  Central.
[03:04:58.570 --> 03:05:10.320]  Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton denied reports that her private email server had been hacked after being confronted by an InfoWars correspondent at a campaign stop in Iowa.
[03:05:10.320 --> 03:05:18.407]  Secretary Clinton, last week it was reported on InfoWars.com that your email server was hacked and you knowingly continued to use your email server.
[03:05:18.407 --> 03:05:19.288]  Can you comment on that?
[03:05:19.288 --> 03:05:20.329]  Yeah, it's totally untrue.
[03:05:20.589 --> 03:05:38.000]  The question stems from an exclusive InfoWars interview earlier this month in which former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino reported that Hillary continued using her private email to discuss classified information while knowing that her server had been compromised.
[03:05:38.180 --> 03:05:41.301]  The Clintons knew it was hacked, and she did it anyway.
[03:05:41.301 --> 03:05:47.204]  And not only is she not currently indicted or in prison, she's running to be President of the United States.
[03:05:47.204 --> 03:05:53.266]  If this is not a red flag to every Paul Revere out there that something's wrong, then you know what?
[03:05:53.266 --> 03:05:54.306]  The country is lost.
[03:05:54.306 --> 03:05:57.048]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com

[03:08:12.541 --> 03:08:18.965]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:18.965 --> 03:08:26.370]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, January 22nd, 2016.
[03:08:26.370 --> 03:08:29.992]  I'm David Knight here with the news wrap-up hour.
[03:08:29.992 --> 03:08:32.113]  Major story that perhaps you haven't seen.
[03:08:32.113 --> 03:08:35.335]  It was reported on Defense 1, not too many people have picked this up.
[03:08:35.335 --> 03:08:37.397]  Matt brought this in to me and said, look at this.
[03:08:38.257 --> 03:08:45.364]  Senate Leader Mitch McConnell offers members a snow weekend surprise late Wednesday night.
[03:08:45.364 --> 03:08:48.326]  It even surprised Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn.
[03:08:48.326 --> 03:08:52.590]  He was unaware that McConnell had set up this, and what is it that he set up?
[03:08:52.590 --> 03:08:54.973]  When asked about it, he goes, he did set this up?
[03:08:55.753 --> 03:08:59.676]  Uh, well, what he is setting up is an authorization for the use of military force.
[03:08:59.676 --> 03:09:01.837]  And you may say, well, we've already had that.
[03:09:01.837 --> 03:09:05.279]  Yeah, we had that in response to the 9-11 terrorist attack.
[03:09:05.279 --> 03:09:11.223]  By the way, I rarely do this, but you told me about this when I got off five minutes ago, and I'm going to let you continue.
[03:09:11.223 --> 03:09:14.585]  I'm going to be doing a Facebook mentions and do my own breakdown on this after you're off.
[03:09:15.225 --> 03:09:19.331]  But this is really, really a big deal, and I began to read this.
[03:09:19.331 --> 03:09:25.220]  This is unprecedented everywhere in the world, including the U.S., and it gives the president the power.
[03:09:25.220 --> 03:09:26.883]  They'll spin it, oh, you're against the military.
[03:09:26.883 --> 03:09:30.768]  No, the military is what's been warning us about this power for Syria,
[03:09:31.729 --> 03:09:38.131]  You know, to help Al Qaeda, ISIS, but also the economic collapse, the snowstorm.
[03:09:38.131 --> 03:09:41.492]  And I'm not saying they're taking over before it becomes a new Jade Helm thing.
[03:09:41.492 --> 03:09:45.093]  I'm saying it's part of the process of just getting rid of all checks and balances.
[03:09:45.093 --> 03:09:48.134]  But it is a martial law takeover bill.
[03:09:48.134 --> 03:09:50.014]  It is unprecedented.
[03:09:50.014 --> 03:09:53.795]  And the minute I saw it, I realized that this just broke a few hours ago.
[03:09:53.795 --> 03:09:56.276]  And I went and noticed other people are already saying that.
[03:09:56.276 --> 03:09:57.196]  So that's what this is.
[03:09:57.196 --> 03:09:57.816]  Go ahead, David.
[03:09:57.816 --> 03:09:58.516]  Absolutely.
[03:09:58.516 --> 03:10:00.477]  What's different about this authorization?
[03:10:00.697 --> 03:10:08.585]  For the use of military forces now being put forward at the last minute by Mitch McConnell when all of Washington is being shut down with a snowstorm.
[03:10:08.585 --> 03:10:12.950]  And of course, as I mentioned, it completely surprised the Senate majority whip, John Cornyn.
[03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:14.792]  He said, I hadn't heard anything about it.
[03:10:14.792 --> 03:10:15.553]  He goes, he did.
[03:10:15.553 --> 03:10:16.253]  He put this forward.
[03:10:17.454 --> 03:10:18.435]  What's different about this?
[03:10:18.435 --> 03:10:30.079]  Not only is it not a response to the specific 9-11 terrorist attacks, as they were using for that, this would remove any limits related to time or geography.
[03:10:30.079 --> 03:10:30.900]  Let me repeat that.
[03:10:30.900 --> 03:10:40.023]  This authorization for the use of military force would eliminate any restrictions on time or geography.
[03:10:40.023 --> 03:10:43.385]  It would remove any restrictions on the President's use of ground troops.
[03:10:44.045 --> 03:10:46.727]  Think about the NDAA.
[03:10:46.727 --> 03:10:57.333]  Think about when they put in there and said, we're going to say that we have the power to have the military indefinitely retain people without charges.
[03:10:57.333 --> 03:11:00.555]  Remember when Obama signed that on a New Year's Eve?
[03:11:00.555 --> 03:11:07.039]  I think it was in 2000, I think it was coming up in 2011, I think it was a 2012 NDAA.
[03:11:07.039 --> 03:11:08.980]  Nevertheless, it was a New Year's Eve that he did that.
[03:11:09.710 --> 03:11:12.031]  Everybody was concerned about that, and rightfully so.
[03:11:12.031 --> 03:11:19.213]  How do you have a situation where you've got the military can pick up anybody and hold them indefinitely, okay?
[03:11:19.213 --> 03:11:27.375]  Not only did Obama not get rid of Gitmo liberals, think about this, not only did he not get rid of Gitmo, but he extended Gitmo to everyone.
[03:11:28.072 --> 03:11:32.735]  And said, we have this anywhere we can use the authorization for the use of military force.
[03:11:32.735 --> 03:11:36.017]  And they said, well, this is against any kind of terrorist attack.
[03:11:36.017 --> 03:11:43.222]  So that could, many people are saying, that could be construed as saying that you're at war here in the continental United States.
[03:11:43.222 --> 03:11:48.145]  That you could use this authorization for the use of military force against people in the United States.
[03:11:48.145 --> 03:11:49.686]  Because we've got a war on terrorism.
[03:11:49.686 --> 03:11:51.488]  The war on terrorism is global.
[03:11:51.488 --> 03:11:53.689]  It has no specific enemies.
[03:11:53.689 --> 03:11:55.730]  So it is eternal.
[03:11:55.730 --> 03:11:57.272]  And so it could be used against us.
[03:11:58.206 --> 03:11:58.706]  We all said that.
[03:11:58.706 --> 03:12:00.487]  We said, you're conspiracy theorists.
[03:12:00.487 --> 03:12:01.748]  They would never do that.
[03:12:01.748 --> 03:12:07.912]  So now we've got Mitch McConnell coming out and saying he's going to allow the president to use ground troops.
[03:12:07.912 --> 03:12:11.254]  There will not be any limits related to time or geography.
[03:12:11.254 --> 03:12:12.355]  Do you see how they're rolling this out?
[03:12:12.355 --> 03:12:18.499]  They say, after months of worrying that such a resolution would tie the next president's hands, that's what he was saying anyway,
[03:12:18.999 --> 03:12:25.663]  Mitch McConnell moved to fast-track the measure, and surprised even his top deputy, who said, I wasn't aware he was doing this.
[03:12:25.663 --> 03:12:26.404]  He really did this?
[03:12:26.404 --> 03:12:27.224]  I didn't know about this.
[03:12:27.224 --> 03:12:31.887]  But of course, it already has four Republican co-sponsors now.
[03:12:31.887 --> 03:12:38.030]  First in line, Lindsey Graham, then Daniel Coats, Joni Ernst, and Orrin Hatch.
[03:12:38.030 --> 03:12:38.831]  There you go.
[03:12:38.831 --> 03:12:39.491]  Okay.
[03:12:39.491 --> 03:12:45.115]  Now, this was after the Obama administration had put forward last February
[03:12:46.175 --> 03:12:51.978]  A measure that would authorize the use of offensive ground combat operations against ISIS.
[03:12:51.978 --> 03:12:55.819]  Okay, we're going to go to Syria, we're going to put boots on the ground against ISIS.
[03:12:55.819 --> 03:13:00.121]  That would have ended three years after it was enacted, unless reauthorized.
[03:13:00.121 --> 03:13:02.763]  In other words, it had a sunset provision on it.
[03:13:02.763 --> 03:13:07.245]  It was specific, but now the Republicans come back and they always want to one-up
[03:13:07.905 --> 03:13:23.207]  uh... the military industrial complex democrats and say no we're gonna remove the restrictions on time and geography so be aware that we're going to be uh... following that uh... alex jones will be recording uh... a uh... a facebook's mention on uh... on that
[03:13:24.079 --> 03:13:27.122]  Also, this other article about what's going on in Congress.
[03:13:27.122 --> 03:13:33.629]  This is an article written by Bob Goodlatte and Orrin Hatch, a congressman and a senator.
[03:13:33.629 --> 03:13:40.216]  Of course, Orrin Hatch was the guy who just wants to authorize use of military force without restriction to geography or time.
[03:13:40.216 --> 03:13:45.301]  Nevertheless, they're saying, how do we protect Americans from accidentally breaking the law?
[03:13:45.301 --> 03:13:46.523]  Well, that sounds good, doesn't it?
[03:13:47.931 --> 03:13:49.032]  Why don't we ask this?
[03:13:49.032 --> 03:13:54.114]  How do we protect Americans from bureaucracies who are intentionally breaking the law?
[03:13:54.114 --> 03:14:01.277]  So there is a problem of Americans who are accidentally breaking the law and then get hit with draconian measures.
[03:14:01.277 --> 03:14:03.058]  I'll give a couple of examples.
[03:14:03.058 --> 03:14:08.540]  A 23-year-old man found a buried skull on a hunting trip in Alaska and he turned it over to the U.S.
[03:14:08.540 --> 03:14:09.121]  Forest Service.
[03:14:09.960 --> 03:14:11.722]  Then he was charged by the U.S.
[03:14:11.722 --> 03:14:16.065]  Forest Service with removing an archaeological resource from public lands.
[03:14:16.065 --> 03:14:28.857]  Similarly, the parents of a young girl who saved a woodpecker from the family cat were fined for violating the Migratory Bird Act because it's a crime to take or to transport a woodpecker, even to save its life.
[03:14:28.857 --> 03:14:33.281]  See, that's the kind of mindless overreaction that we get from the bureaucracy.
[03:14:34.451 --> 03:14:36.392]  Why does that exist, you might ask?
[03:14:36.392 --> 03:14:39.893]  And that's not the question that this congressman and senator are asking.
[03:14:39.893 --> 03:14:41.974]  That's what I want them to ask.
[03:14:41.974 --> 03:14:46.516]  I want to also ask that if they're concerned about people
[03:14:47.631 --> 03:14:55.136]  That are being charged with criminal actions, fined, other things happening to them.
[03:14:55.136 --> 03:14:59.799]  What about people who are having seizure laws applied to them?
[03:14:59.799 --> 03:15:03.141]  They're not found guilty, they're not even charged with anything.
[03:15:03.141 --> 03:15:08.285]  These people were at least charged with a bogus violation of a law.
[03:15:09.105 --> 03:15:12.627]  But the government takes things from people under the war on drugs without even charging them.
[03:15:12.627 --> 03:15:18.131]  They charge the house, or they charge your car, or they charge your airplane.
[03:15:18.131 --> 03:15:20.653]  And take your house, your car, or your airplane.
[03:15:20.653 --> 03:15:21.053]  It's the U.S.
[03:15:21.053 --> 03:15:26.217]  government versus Camaro, 1977 Camaro, whatever, okay?
[03:15:26.217 --> 03:15:27.698]  You got a classic car, they take that.
[03:15:28.979 --> 03:15:31.740]  This is the issue, okay?
[03:15:31.740 --> 03:15:36.502]  We have to be concerned about a permanently entrenched bureaucracy.
[03:15:36.502 --> 03:15:40.603]  And that's when I look at what the National Review is talking about.
[03:15:40.603 --> 03:15:48.426]  When they go after Trump, and they spend an entire issue attacking Trump, I have to say, Trump is not the problem.
[03:15:48.426 --> 03:15:49.967]  He's not a politician.
[03:15:49.967 --> 03:15:52.208]  He's never done anything at this point.
[03:15:52.208 --> 03:15:55.509]  Now they think he's going to be a problem if he gets elected, I understand that.
[03:15:56.308 --> 03:16:00.391]  But why don't they address the problems that are systemic right now?
[03:16:00.391 --> 03:16:02.093]  See, the conservatives don't want to do that.
[03:16:02.093 --> 03:16:06.756]  And it gets to the essence of why I do not call myself a conservative.
[03:16:06.756 --> 03:16:10.019]  Conservatives want to protect the status quo.
[03:16:10.019 --> 03:16:12.581]  I don't care about the status quo.
[03:16:12.581 --> 03:16:15.443]  I want the status quo ante, if you want to keep it in Latin.
[03:16:15.443 --> 03:16:18.286]  I want the status quo before we got to where we are now.
[03:16:19.358 --> 03:16:25.145]  I have lived in an America all of my life, and I'm pretty old now, getting pretty old.
[03:16:25.145 --> 03:16:30.050]  I've lived in an America all of my life where we have never even tried the Constitution.
[03:16:30.050 --> 03:16:30.911]  It's a great plan.
[03:16:30.911 --> 03:16:32.573]  We should try it sometime.
[03:16:32.573 --> 03:16:33.895]  Hopefully in my lifetime.
[03:16:35.060 --> 03:16:41.787]  But we aren't going to try it as long as we have the GOP establishment fighting back.
[03:16:41.787 --> 03:16:43.369]  And that's essentially what's happening.
[03:16:43.369 --> 03:16:44.470]  They're striking back.
[03:16:44.470 --> 03:16:48.234]  It's like, Darth Vader, we need to cue the theme song for Alex here.
[03:16:48.234 --> 03:16:52.138]  Because when I saw that on National Review, I go, here they go again.
[03:16:52.138 --> 03:16:53.720]  They want to nail this down to the ground.
[03:16:53.720 --> 03:16:55.021]  And of course, they have political
[03:16:56.062 --> 03:16:57.864]  Uh, uh, a stake in this.
[03:16:57.864 --> 03:16:59.667]  They, they are part of the establishment.
[03:16:59.667 --> 03:17:01.469]  That's why they don't want the establishment to change.
[03:17:01.469 --> 03:17:06.975]  This is the establishment, media establishment politicians who don't want things to change.
[03:17:06.975 --> 03:17:07.656]  Think about this.
[03:17:07.656 --> 03:17:10.639]  You know, you, you either lead, follow, or get out of the way.
[03:17:11.598 --> 03:17:14.539]  They don't want to identify the problems and lead us out of this.
[03:17:14.539 --> 03:17:17.960]  And when the American people identify the problems, they won't follow us.
[03:17:17.960 --> 03:17:23.502]  As a matter of fact, they lie to us about what they're going to do when we say, yeah, hey, look, this is a problem.
[03:17:23.502 --> 03:17:25.242]  We want to elect you to fix this.
[03:17:25.242 --> 03:17:26.323]  Yeah, we'll do that.
[03:17:26.323 --> 03:17:27.443]  Just vote for us.
[03:17:27.443 --> 03:17:30.024]  And immediately they betray the GOP voters.
[03:17:30.504 --> 03:17:33.788]  And so now people are saying to them, get out of the way.
[03:17:33.788 --> 03:17:34.949]  Get out of the way.
[03:17:34.949 --> 03:17:37.091]  You're just useless and irrelevant.
[03:17:37.091 --> 03:17:37.812]  So what do they do?
[03:17:37.812 --> 03:17:40.856]  They push back against Trump in this editorial.
[03:17:40.856 --> 03:17:42.517]  And there's a lot to talk about with that.
[03:17:42.517 --> 03:17:44.520]  I don't think we've got time to get into that.
[03:17:44.520 --> 03:17:48.884]  I want to continue on with this, you know, this idea that somehow
[03:17:50.246 --> 03:17:59.212]  This is a mistake that we need to correct, you know, that you have Americans who are accidentally breaking law and then this bureaucracy is coming down on them.
[03:17:59.212 --> 03:18:01.774]  That's what they really need to address.
[03:18:01.774 --> 03:18:14.082]  They say the failure of Congress to articulate a clear standard of criminal intention, they have a Latin term, mens rea, which means guilty mind, coupled with a dramatic expansion of the federal criminal code.
[03:18:14.082 --> 03:18:15.783]  Yeah, let's talk about that dramatic expansion.
[03:18:16.403 --> 03:18:18.184]  I reported on that a couple of weeks ago.
[03:18:18.184 --> 03:18:24.747]  At the end of the year, they pointed out there was over 81,000 pages added to the Federal Register in one year.
[03:18:24.747 --> 03:18:26.528]  A new record.
[03:18:26.528 --> 03:18:33.932]  But for the last several years, they've been adding 79,000, 80,000 pages of rules every year.
[03:18:33.932 --> 03:18:35.773]  These are the bureaucracies that are adding the rules.
[03:18:35.773 --> 03:18:37.274]  And just as you saw a couple of days ago,
[03:18:37.947 --> 03:18:46.829]  When we played those Park Service employees celebrating the fact that they take people's property and they always pay a lot less than it's due, so we're the bad guys.
[03:18:46.829 --> 03:18:48.189]  And they laughed about it.
[03:18:48.189 --> 03:18:52.470]  They, you know, they didn't laugh about the fact that, oh yeah, they think we're bad guys, but we're really good guys.
[03:18:52.470 --> 03:18:54.171]  No, they owned it.
[03:18:54.171 --> 03:18:56.551]  They owned it like Darth Vader.
[03:18:56.551 --> 03:19:07.114]  And they were pointing out that, you know, when you have a situation like this, how do we get to a situation where the Congress says, well, you know, the problem is we've had a dramatic expansion of the federal criminal code.
[03:19:07.742 --> 03:19:09.464]  They've allowed that to happen.
[03:19:09.464 --> 03:19:16.770]  People like Orrin Hatch, who's been there forever, stepped aside and made Congress a rump organization.
[03:19:16.770 --> 03:19:21.514]  They basically do nothing except collect money and run for office.
[03:19:21.514 --> 03:19:24.857]  They don't exercise their legislative duty.
[03:19:25.731 --> 03:19:40.665]  We elected them so that we would not have legislation without representation, taxation without representation, and so now we've got a federal bureaucracy that does all that and they come back and say, well, you know, sometimes people don't have criminal action and we're locking them up and taking their property.
[03:19:40.665 --> 03:19:42.206]  Well, why don't you do something about it?
[03:19:42.206 --> 03:19:51.014]  Why don't you, maybe, we should have Congress write a law that would require Congress to write the laws instead of allowing the bureaucracies to do it so they can grow their empires.
[03:19:51.014 --> 03:19:52.035]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:19:59.062 --> 03:20:02.663]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?

[03:20:59.005 --> 03:21:05.709]  Chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair and compromises your immune system, making you more vulnerable to all diseases.
[03:21:05.709 --> 03:21:10.892]  Since poor diet, injuries or stress are all contributing factors, many people suffer from inflammation.
[03:21:10.892 --> 03:21:16.035]  Your body's number one means of neutralizing inflammation and the pain that it may be causing is glutathione.
[03:21:16.035 --> 03:21:20.358]  Glutathione is the body's number one peptide to neutralize free radicals and thus stop inflammation.
[03:21:20.598 --> 03:21:21.799]  Hi, my name is Jason.
[03:21:21.799 --> 03:21:22.920]  I'm 44 years old.
[03:21:22.920 --> 03:21:29.307]  For 10 years, I had been suffering from chronic pain in my abdomen and groin that radiated down into my feet.
[03:21:29.307 --> 03:21:36.634]  After three weeks on One World Way, the pain in my feet reduced by 50% and the overall pain in my body reduced significantly as well.
[03:21:36.634 --> 03:21:37.675]  I ran out of One World Way.
[03:21:37.935 --> 03:21:39.176]  And the pain returned.
[03:21:39.176 --> 03:21:45.000]  I got another container and again, after three weeks, the pain reduced significantly throughout my body.
[03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:49.643]  I'd highly recommend One World Way to anyone dealing with chronic pain due to inflammation.
[03:21:49.643 --> 03:21:50.864]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.

[03:22:20.254 --> 03:22:22.797]  Antibiotics can damage good microflora.
[03:22:22.797 --> 03:22:26.582]  And often leave behind bacteria which can cause problems later on.
[03:22:26.582 --> 03:22:29.966]  If you're sick of being sick, try Supernatural Silver.
[03:22:29.966 --> 03:22:31.168]  Supernatural Silver.

[03:24:01.179 --> 03:24:06.863]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:06.863 --> 03:24:09.084]  I'm David Knight, your host this hour.
[03:24:09.084 --> 03:24:15.868]  I want to get back to this Senate leader surprising lawmakers with a new ISIS war powers request.
[03:24:15.868 --> 03:24:17.909]  This is a huge story.
[03:24:17.909 --> 03:24:23.593]  Also, we've got some information about drones at the Super Bowl that I think you'll find interesting.
[03:24:24.233 --> 03:24:28.956]  Before I do, I want to let you know about the Survival Shield X2 and Supermail Vitality.
[03:24:28.956 --> 03:24:35.200]  Each of those are available for 15% off at ENDS today at Infowarslife.com.
[03:24:35.200 --> 03:24:37.942]  Today, you can still get each of those 15% off.
[03:24:37.942 --> 03:24:39.063]  It's not necessarily packaged.
[03:24:39.063 --> 03:24:43.986]  You can buy each of those individually, 15% off one or the other.
[03:24:43.986 --> 03:24:46.388]  We have thousands of five-star reviews.
[03:24:46.388 --> 03:24:50.070]  Over 90% of the reviewers say they would recommend these products to a friend.
[03:24:50.070 --> 03:24:52.792]  Survival Shield X2 is one of those things, nascent iodine.
[03:24:53.132 --> 03:24:57.154]  One of those things you should have for your health, for other issues too.
[03:24:57.154 --> 03:24:59.615]  I mean, it's like silver.
[03:24:59.615 --> 03:25:04.118]  People have used iodine in the past for disinfection, so we keep that around always.
[03:25:04.118 --> 03:25:06.639]  I also like to have the super male vitality.
[03:25:06.639 --> 03:25:09.080]  I like to get my nutrients in a liquid form.
[03:25:09.080 --> 03:25:18.685]  I can take, instead of swallowing a whole slew of tablets like I used to and pills, I can put these things in a mixer in the morning and just chug it back.
[03:25:19.065 --> 03:25:20.946]  Well, quickly, and that's what I like to do.
[03:25:20.946 --> 03:25:23.607]  I can take all this stuff very quickly, take it all at once.
[03:25:23.607 --> 03:25:28.870]  Again, 15% off Survival Shield X2 and Supermail Vitality.
[03:25:28.870 --> 03:25:34.813]  That sale ends today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:25:34.813 --> 03:25:41.316]  Now, as the Super Bowl is coming up in a few weeks, we have the FAA has announced that they're going to ban drones at the Super Bowl.
[03:25:41.316 --> 03:25:44.378]  Now, you would kind of expect that they would do that, but what is surprising
[03:25:45.367 --> 03:25:48.508]  Because of the fact that they would do this in such a large radius.
[03:25:48.508 --> 03:25:50.669]  A 37 mile radius.
[03:25:50.669 --> 03:25:52.810]  They're banning all flights of drones.
[03:25:52.810 --> 03:25:59.033]  Now there's an inner core of 11.5 mile radius where the FAA has particularly advised you against flying.
[03:25:59.033 --> 03:26:01.834]  So in other words, maybe they're going to shoot it down.
[03:26:01.834 --> 03:26:03.514]  Who knows what that's going to be about.
[03:26:03.514 --> 03:26:04.315]  But the point is this.
[03:26:04.975 --> 03:26:17.970]  As popular science talks about this and points out what's going on with this, they say the prohibition means that people miles and miles and miles away who want to simply fly their drones on a Sunday may be violating the law when they do.
[03:26:17.970 --> 03:26:25.198]  They might round you up like they did the Hammonds in Oregon when you're doing something innocuous and ordinary, charge you as being a terrorist.
[03:26:25.984 --> 03:26:27.184]  You think they would?
[03:26:27.184 --> 03:26:29.405]  We've seen this over and over again.
[03:26:29.405 --> 03:26:35.867]  We've seen a guy being charged with multiple felony violations because he released balloons on a beach for his sweetheart.
[03:26:35.867 --> 03:26:36.567]  Helium balloons.
[03:26:36.567 --> 03:26:39.688]  They said, wait, this is a protected area for some sea tortoises or something.
[03:26:39.688 --> 03:26:40.728]  So that's a felony.
[03:26:40.728 --> 03:26:42.169]  Four felony charges on you.
[03:26:42.169 --> 03:26:43.349]  Now you can't have a gun.
[03:26:43.349 --> 03:26:44.169]  Whatever, okay?
[03:26:44.169 --> 03:26:45.470]  Now when they're looking at these drones,
[03:26:46.448 --> 03:26:48.951]  Maybe they ought to be concerned about their drones.
[03:26:48.951 --> 03:27:01.045]  The Washington Post pointed out yesterday there was a mysterious, actually two days ago, a mysterious surge in mishaps involving the Air Force's newest and most advanced hunter-killer drone, the Reaper.
[03:27:01.926 --> 03:27:10.295]  Okay, now, these are, they've had 20 cases, this is an investigation done by the Washington Post, because the Pentagon doesn't want to talk about this kind of stuff, okay?
[03:27:10.295 --> 03:27:14.339]  They want to keep this secret, just like Google likes to keep their car crashes secret.
[03:27:14.339 --> 03:27:18.983]  Don't talk about it, didn't happen, it's somebody else's fault, it's not our fault, okay?
[03:27:18.983 --> 03:27:21.286]  And maybe it is somebody else's fault in this particular case.
[03:27:21.846 --> 03:27:27.150]  Maybe you've got some foreign power that is hacking their drones and making them crash to the ground.
[03:27:27.150 --> 03:27:35.656]  They've had 20 large Air Force drones destroyed or sustained at least $2 million in damage and accidents last year, the worst annual toll ever.
[03:27:35.656 --> 03:27:42.241]  And of course, the Pentagon has shrouded the extent of the problem, kept details of most of the crashes a secret.
[03:27:42.381 --> 03:27:46.946]  Here's one of the details that I thought was interesting about these Reaper drones.
[03:27:46.946 --> 03:27:48.729]  These things are two and a half tons.
[03:27:48.729 --> 03:27:50.411]  Two and a half tons.
[03:27:50.411 --> 03:27:52.733]  Three thousand pounds.
[03:27:52.733 --> 03:27:54.676]  Size of a car.
[03:27:54.676 --> 03:27:57.679]  Now, think about the fact, because we were just talking about how
[03:27:58.717 --> 03:28:01.138]  The bureaucracies are out of control.
[03:28:01.138 --> 03:28:08.521]  How they're taking draconian measures against people who never even had a knowledge or an intent to break a law.
[03:28:08.521 --> 03:28:15.064]  These minor laws, they come in, they wreck your life or they send you to prison as a terrorist.
[03:28:15.064 --> 03:28:26.609]  Here we have a situation, think about it, just before Christmas we had the FAA coming in and saying, if you do not register your half pound and up drone, then we will fine you just for not registering.
[03:28:26.609 --> 03:28:27.930]  If we see you flying it outside,
[03:28:28.843 --> 03:28:30.946]  Regardless of what you do, you don't have to do anything criminal.
[03:28:30.946 --> 03:28:32.768]  If you go criminal, they're going to come after you.
[03:28:32.768 --> 03:28:38.875]  I think the penalty was three years and a quarter of a million dollars, I think they could go up to.
[03:28:38.875 --> 03:28:40.197]  But you're not doing anything criminal.
[03:28:40.197 --> 03:28:43.621]  You're just flying it in your own backyard, a half-pound drone.
[03:28:43.621 --> 03:28:45.323]  You didn't register it with the FAA.
[03:28:45.323 --> 03:28:46.705]  They're going to come after you with a
[03:28:47.686 --> 03:28:53.131]  Civil action, which means they don't have to charge you with a crime and find you guilty, a civil action $27,500.
[03:28:53.131 --> 03:29:00.938]  But these guys are crashing 20 large drones that are the size of a car, 3,000 pounds.
[03:29:00.938 --> 03:29:03.480]  Not a half pound, 3,000 pounds.
[03:29:03.480 --> 03:29:06.403]  And do you think they're going to be flying those at the Super Bowl?
[03:29:07.183 --> 03:29:09.484]  I bet they are.
[03:29:09.484 --> 03:29:23.369]  And the other thing that I find troubling is when you go back and you look at these drones, and who has the drones, the Bureau of Land Management, the good old BLM, our favorite people there, they have got a fleet of drones.
[03:29:23.369 --> 03:29:24.589]  Reapers and predator drones.
[03:29:24.589 --> 03:29:25.189]  You know what they're doing?
[03:29:25.189 --> 03:29:30.171]  They're not necessarily going out there to assassinate people who protest their theft.
[03:29:30.911 --> 03:29:36.597]  But they are mapping out every last inch of territory because they're going to make it theirs.
[03:29:36.597 --> 03:29:47.928]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:29:47.928 --> 03:29:51.852]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.852 --> 03:29:54.575]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.658 --> 03:30:05.685]  The Democratic Party establishment that wants to install Hillary into the White House in this next election season is currently in free fall.
[03:30:05.685 --> 03:30:14.014]  The plan for potential first husband Bill Clinton has failed miserably, as women have crawled out of the woodwork to describe his detailed history of sexual abuse.
[03:30:14.014 --> 03:30:19.860]  She also has the looming email scandal, which doesn't seem to go away, no matter how many jokes she throws at it.
[03:30:19.860 --> 03:30:21.382]  The latest news comes out of Beaumont.
[03:30:21.442 --> 03:30:24.606]  Where only six people were at the airport to greet the former first lady.
[03:30:24.606 --> 03:30:28.350]  KDFM reported that she didn't say hello or visit any of those six people.
[03:30:28.350 --> 03:30:29.611]  She just drove away.
[03:30:29.611 --> 03:30:30.732]  And where was she going?
[03:30:30.732 --> 03:30:35.197]  Oh, to a private fundraiser held by Pakistani businessman Tahir Javid to collect $500,000.
[03:30:35.197 --> 03:30:38.521]  The news reported it as a private meeting.
[03:30:38.521 --> 03:30:42.025]  Back in 2008, she attended another private meeting with Barack Obama.
[03:30:42.165 --> 03:30:46.047]  This occurred, of course, in Chantilly, Virginia, during the Bilderberg meeting.
[03:30:46.047 --> 03:30:51.310]  In fact, her campaign has become so desperate, she's now labeling Bernie Sanders as a white elitist.
[03:30:51.310 --> 03:30:53.070]  Read the article at InfoWars.com.
[03:30:53.070 --> 03:30:54.951]  Bernie Sanders, very white.
[03:30:54.951 --> 03:30:58.053]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:30:58.493 --> 03:31:00.155]  Clean, pure drinking water.

[03:33:07.609 --> 03:33:12.437]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:12.437 --> 03:33:17.385]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:20.205 --> 03:33:30.771]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, and as we've been mentioning, there is a report out by Defense One that Senate Leader Mitch McConnell has surprised lawmakers with new ISIS war powers requests.
[03:33:30.771 --> 03:33:33.732]  They point out this came as a Snow Weekend surprise.
[03:33:33.732 --> 03:33:43.077]  His move to fast-track the measure surprised even his top deputy, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, who was unaware that McConnell had set up the authorization.
[03:33:43.077 --> 03:33:47.400]  When asked by the National Journal yesterday morning, Cornyn said, he did?
[03:33:47.400 --> 03:33:47.680]  He did?
[03:33:47.680 --> 03:33:49.361]  I didn't know anything about that.
[03:33:49.921 --> 03:33:56.087]  They point out that this is not going to touch on the issue of what to do with the 2001 authorization for the use of military force.
[03:33:56.087 --> 03:33:57.449]  Maybe you knew about that, maybe you didn't.
[03:33:57.449 --> 03:34:05.317]  We talked quite a bit about that when the NDAA Act talking about indefinite detention by the military in war zones was being put forth.
[03:34:05.317 --> 03:34:09.341]  Again, done on a time when most people are not paying attention.
[03:34:10.592 --> 03:34:18.519]  They say that was put out as an authorization to use force against those who had planned the 9-11 terrorist attacks.
[03:34:18.519 --> 03:34:20.701]  But that's not the way they've been using it, is it?
[03:34:20.701 --> 03:34:21.802]  They've been using it for everything.
[03:34:21.802 --> 03:34:25.345]  And of course, the Obama administration has used it, he says, to attack ISIS.
[03:34:25.345 --> 03:34:26.886]  He says, I've got the authority to do that.
[03:34:26.886 --> 03:34:28.408]  I can stretch it that far.
[03:34:29.124 --> 03:34:30.925]  But it's going to be stretched even farther.
[03:34:30.925 --> 03:34:32.886]  They're going to remove any ambiguity.
[03:34:32.886 --> 03:34:40.711]  They're going to remove any limits related to time or geography when the president wants to use ground troops.
[03:34:40.711 --> 03:34:42.092]  You should be very concerned about this.
[03:34:42.092 --> 03:34:44.974]  You should be very concerned about the way this is being introduced as well.
[03:34:45.814 --> 03:34:48.877]  I want to go back to some technology issues, because I think this is very key.
[03:34:48.877 --> 03:34:52.379]  We have to understand how they're coming after us.
[03:34:52.379 --> 03:34:56.703]  And as somebody who is an electrical engineer, I have a degree in electrical engineering.
[03:34:56.703 --> 03:34:58.885]  I did it for a few years.
[03:34:58.885 --> 03:35:00.766]  I always have been a big fan of technology.
[03:35:00.766 --> 03:35:04.289]  I always thought of technology as a liberating thing, especially the Internet.
[03:35:04.289 --> 03:35:05.590]  And it has been a liberating thing.
[03:35:05.590 --> 03:35:10.033]  But it is also something that is used in other ways to track and to enslave us.
[03:35:10.774 --> 03:35:24.783]  And when we look at the self-driving cars, when we look at the vehicle-to-infrastructure, which is going to be kidding us before we have self-driving cars, and is going to be even more of a threat to our freedom, because that's going to impose a control grid on us.
[03:35:24.783 --> 03:35:27.005]  You have to understand what they're about to do.
[03:35:27.945 --> 03:35:33.327]  As we look at these stories, we've had yet another car with self-driving add-on technology crashing.
[03:35:33.327 --> 03:35:36.228]  This is a Nissan Leaf crashing in San Francisco.
[03:35:36.228 --> 03:35:40.150]  It was equipped with aftermarket self-driving car technology.
[03:35:40.150 --> 03:35:42.071]  It was crashed, they say, by its human driver.
[03:35:42.071 --> 03:35:45.852]  Well, what happened was, it was in autonomous driving mode.
[03:35:45.852 --> 03:35:48.013]  It started drifting left and right.
[03:35:48.013 --> 03:35:49.294]  It started weaving on the road.
[03:35:49.294 --> 03:35:52.635]  So, at this point, he took control of the car, but he couldn't stop it.
[03:35:53.275 --> 03:35:57.116]  Uh, and it struck a part, a Toyota Prius.
[03:35:57.116 --> 03:35:58.037]  Uh, there were no injuries.
[03:35:58.037 --> 03:35:59.897]  So you've got a leaf striking a Prius.
[03:35:59.897 --> 03:36:02.498]  Only in San Francisco, folks.
[03:36:02.498 --> 03:36:04.219]  No muscle cars, no real cars.
[03:36:04.219 --> 03:36:07.680]  Anyway, sorry if you have one of those cars, but I'm not a big fan of them.
[03:36:07.680 --> 03:36:11.021]  Uh, they say this took place in January 8th in downtown San Francisco.
[03:36:12.455 --> 03:36:17.977]  And it shines a spotlight on the complex interface between humans and machines when it comes to driving a vehicle.
[03:36:17.977 --> 03:36:19.057]  No, you don't say.
[03:36:19.057 --> 03:36:19.918]  You don't say.
[03:36:19.918 --> 03:36:22.638]  Here's what's going to happen before that, though, folks.
[03:36:22.638 --> 03:36:26.380]  Forbes has an article about how will talking cars change our roads.
[03:36:26.380 --> 03:36:29.541]  And they say, you know, when we look back at things, we just had the Detroit Auto Show.
[03:36:29.541 --> 03:36:30.381]  It's still going on.
[03:36:30.381 --> 03:36:32.262]  It ends this Sunday.
[03:36:32.262 --> 03:36:34.722]  That's the big hit, the centerpiece of the show.
[03:36:34.722 --> 03:36:35.923]  That is the self-driving car.
[03:36:36.483 --> 03:36:40.186]  And it's been that way with a lot of these technology shows throughout this year.
[03:36:40.186 --> 03:36:46.870]  This Consumer Electronics Show, the very beginning of the year, that was the centerpiece, self-driving car technology.
[03:36:46.870 --> 03:36:51.653]  They say, well, you know, they're electric, they're smart, but they're not talking to other stuff.
[03:36:51.653 --> 03:36:58.118]  So it's the connectivity that they're focusing on, making the car part of the Internet of Things.
[03:36:58.118 --> 03:37:06.123]  And so one of the examples they have here is like, well, gee, you know, Ford just introduced a new feature so that you can control your home thermostat from your steering wheel.
[03:37:06.843 --> 03:37:07.564]  Really?
[03:37:07.564 --> 03:37:09.285]  Is that something you're asking for?
[03:37:09.285 --> 03:37:18.073]  I drive behind people in Austin all the time and I honestly think they might be trying to do that because they certainly aren't paying attention to what they're doing on the road, okay?
[03:37:18.073 --> 03:37:21.776]  We don't need that kind of distraction in our car to control your thermostat.
[03:37:21.776 --> 03:37:27.400]  Just wait till you get somewhere you can find some gadget to do that with your phone when you're not driving.
[03:37:27.400 --> 03:37:29.462]  But they want to make it part of the Internet of Things.
[03:37:29.462 --> 03:37:30.083]  What does this mean?
[03:37:30.703 --> 03:37:36.247]  Well, think about the fact that in this article they point out in a gee whiz kind of way.
[03:37:36.247 --> 03:37:50.239]  They say, well, you know, we'll be able to identify what's happening with the weather because if we notice that dozens of cars are turning on their windshield wipers, that'll be transmitted back to the government's weather service and they'll know that it's raining there.
[03:37:50.998 --> 03:37:52.179]  That would be better than satellites.
[03:37:52.179 --> 03:38:01.865]  Remember, a couple of days ago, we had the Kit Daniels article about how at Davos they were saying, you know, self-driving cars are going to give us more intelligence than drones and satellites?
[03:38:01.865 --> 03:38:04.146]  That's the kind of granularity they're talking about.
[03:38:04.146 --> 03:38:11.911]  They're going to be monitoring everything you do in your car, even turning on your windshield wiper, and reporting that to the government.
[03:38:11.911 --> 03:38:16.073]  That's what they mean by vehicle to infrastructure.
[03:38:16.073 --> 03:38:17.154]  When you drive down the road,
[03:38:17.734 --> 03:38:24.576]  Your car is constantly going to be talking to the stoplights, to the weather service about what you're doing with your car.
[03:38:24.576 --> 03:38:26.936]  Everything that you do is going to be micromanaged.
[03:38:26.936 --> 03:38:30.157]  The insurance companies are going to be looking at how fast you're going.
[03:38:30.157 --> 03:38:32.458]  Of course, the police will as well.
[03:38:32.458 --> 03:38:36.199]  And they're going to use insurance and tickets to drive you out of the car.
[03:38:36.199 --> 03:38:43.300]  You won't be able to do it because they're going to micromanage and monitor everything you do, like the perpetual nanny.
[03:38:43.300 --> 03:38:45.421]  And I think what we need to seriously do
[03:38:46.101 --> 03:39:04.531]  We need to invoke the Third Amendment and say, I don't want you in my car, I don't want you in my house, I don't want you in my computer, I don't want to pay to feed you bandwidth so you can spy on me, because I have to pay for the bandwidth at home on my computer, but I've got the government living in my computer, living in my home.
[03:39:04.531 --> 03:39:06.853]  We need to use the Third Amendment, perhaps.
[03:39:07.313 --> 03:39:14.298]  And say, in this cyberspace, we're not going to allow government police to live and feed off of us.
[03:39:14.298 --> 03:39:18.321]  Maybe this is the point at which we need to do this.
[03:39:18.321 --> 03:39:23.085]  But as one of these people who's selling the technology, of course, this is going to be something they project by 2020.
[03:39:23.085 --> 03:39:25.326]  That's only four years away, folks.
[03:39:25.326 --> 03:39:29.590]  They're going to make these mandates for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure.
[03:39:29.590 --> 03:39:31.111]  They're going to make these mandates this year.
[03:39:32.475 --> 03:39:36.837]  In four years, expect it to be a $46 billion industry.
[03:39:36.837 --> 03:39:42.719]  Those are mandates that are going to be put on your car, and you're going to be paying for that.
[03:39:42.719 --> 03:39:44.899]  They're going to be making a profit off of these mandates.
[03:39:44.899 --> 03:39:46.280]  That's why Detroit is pushing it.
[03:39:46.280 --> 03:39:48.041]  That's why they're so excited about it.
[03:39:48.041 --> 03:39:49.621]  It's a new profit center for them.
[03:39:49.621 --> 03:39:53.602]  And of course, the government wants to make your car go away.
[03:39:53.602 --> 03:39:58.064]  They want you, if you're in a vehicle, they want it to be mass transit that they control.
[03:39:58.064 --> 03:40:00.285]  They want to track and tax you with everything they do.
[03:40:00.865 --> 03:40:07.349]  And as one of these guys talks about it, he says, as the technology spreads, equipped cars will become probes.
[03:40:07.349 --> 03:40:08.750]  That's his term, not mine.
[03:40:08.750 --> 03:40:13.172]  They'll become probes, gathering and sharing data about you.
[03:40:13.172 --> 03:40:16.034]  See, when we see the technology being used,
[03:40:16.906 --> 03:40:22.612]  We need to back off and say, is this really what I want?
[03:40:22.612 --> 03:40:28.819]  And when we see Obama talking about smart guns, I want you to think about what's really involved with the technology.
[03:40:28.819 --> 03:40:30.741]  So I put together this report about smart guns.
[03:40:30.741 --> 03:40:32.322]  We ran it a couple of nights ago on the nightly news.
[03:40:32.322 --> 03:40:33.484]  We haven't played it on the radio yet.
[03:40:33.484 --> 03:40:37.388]  I want to play that report now about smart guns and what's really up with that.
[03:40:38.157 --> 03:40:47.523]  At the Consumer Electronics Show, which just ended in Las Vegas, a vendor wanted to demonstrate his smart gun law, saying it answers President Obama's call for a smart gun.
[03:40:47.523 --> 03:40:52.346]  But the Consumer Electronics Show wouldn't allow him to bring an unloaded gun into the show.
[03:40:52.346 --> 03:40:54.547]  Not even an imitation gun.
[03:40:54.547 --> 03:40:56.489]  Not even for Obama.
[03:40:56.489 --> 03:40:57.970]  And there's an important lesson in that.
[03:40:58.700 --> 03:41:01.201]  They really don't want better tech.
[03:41:01.201 --> 03:41:05.043]  They just want to get rid of guns out of fear and ignorance.
[03:41:05.043 --> 03:41:08.165]  We're going to look at why smart guns are a dumb idea.
[03:41:08.165 --> 03:41:13.948]  But first, consider the gun expert the Obama administration has enlisted as a smart gun salesman.
[03:41:13.948 --> 03:41:18.090]  You know the single most consequential thing you can do and have no impact on the Second Amendment?
[03:41:18.090 --> 03:41:19.771]  Buy a smart gun.
[03:41:19.771 --> 03:41:22.132]  Remember the last time Biden gave us gun advice?
[03:41:22.588 --> 03:41:29.139]  She's asking if a ban goes into effect on certain kinds of weapons and high-capacity magazines.
[03:41:29.139 --> 03:41:30.241]  And what's her name?
[03:41:30.241 --> 03:41:30.902]  Kate.
[03:41:30.902 --> 03:41:35.090]  Kate, if you want to protect yourself, get a double-barrel shotgun.
[03:41:36.476 --> 03:41:45.662]  I have the shells of a 12-gauge shotgun, and I promise you, as I told my wife, we live in an area that's wooded and so much to cool.
[03:41:45.662 --> 03:41:57.569]  I said, Jill, if there's ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony here, or walk out, put that double-barrel shotgun, and fire two blasts.
[03:41:57.569 --> 03:41:59.030]  You don't need an AR-15.
[03:41:59.030 --> 03:42:01.631]  It's harder to aim.
[03:42:01.631 --> 03:42:02.672]  It's harder to use.
[03:42:05.206 --> 03:42:09.329]  And in fact, you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself.
[03:42:09.329 --> 03:42:11.491]  Buy a shotgun.
[03:42:11.491 --> 03:42:12.652]  Buy a shotgun.
[03:42:12.652 --> 03:42:14.193]  Buy a smart gun.
[03:42:14.193 --> 03:42:17.156]  Now he's back, with more idiotic advice.
[03:42:17.156 --> 03:42:19.658]  How does that make sense?
[03:42:19.658 --> 03:42:22.240]  What possible sense does that make?
[03:42:22.240 --> 03:42:29.405]  To help push the idea of smart guns, mainstream media, from Fox News to CNN, turns to James Bond as an example.
[03:42:29.405 --> 03:42:30.726]  What's a PPKS 9mm short?
[03:42:32.970 --> 03:42:35.831]  There's a microdermal sensor in the grip.
[03:42:35.831 --> 03:42:39.091]  It's been coded to your palm print so only you can fire it.
[03:42:39.091 --> 03:42:50.614]  While having a gun that only authorized users can fire might sound like a great idea, Bond has lots of gadgets that, in the real world, would be impractical and prohibitively expensive to build.
[03:42:50.614 --> 03:42:53.754]  But Obama says the tech hurdles can be overcome.
[03:42:53.754 --> 03:42:58.616]  If you are a gun owner, I would think that you would at least want a choice.
[03:42:58.616 --> 03:43:00.216]  They don't want to be in a situation where
[03:43:01.056 --> 03:43:02.917]  Oh no, someone's coming through my front door.
[03:43:02.917 --> 03:43:04.077]  I've got to reboot my gun.
[03:43:04.077 --> 03:43:06.058]  It's the reliability, stupid.
[03:43:06.058 --> 03:43:14.302]  Adding biometric or RFID sensors to a gun means adding multiple layers of new complicated technology that can go wrong.
[03:43:14.302 --> 03:43:20.905]  The blinking red LED light means that you have 33% battery life left and you must change the batteries.
[03:43:20.905 --> 03:43:22.445]  There weren't batteries that were small enough.
[03:43:22.445 --> 03:43:25.827]  There weren't chips that were reliable enough.
[03:43:25.827 --> 03:43:30.409]  There wasn't biometric technology that was good enough to recognize fingerprint IDs.
[03:43:30.749 --> 03:43:33.691]  Guns are finely honed mechanical devices.
[03:43:33.691 --> 03:43:34.432]  They're rugged.
[03:43:34.432 --> 03:43:36.553]  They can withstand rough use.
[03:43:36.553 --> 03:43:42.278]  Smart guns will add electronics that can fail, can break, that will need a charged power source.
[03:43:42.278 --> 03:43:46.541]  And most importantly, they can be disabled by criminals or governments.
[03:43:46.541 --> 03:43:54.667]  This vulnerability and others will come from the software, which will also have bugs that will get worse with software updates, just like your phone.
[03:43:54.667 --> 03:43:55.788]  And there are other concerns.
[03:43:56.408 --> 03:44:01.491]  Any wireless coupling can decouple, it can have interference, or it can be hacked.
[03:44:01.491 --> 03:44:06.293]  And will you grip a biometric handle in the same way when you're under stress or under combat?
[03:44:06.846 --> 03:44:09.888]  So far, there's only been one attempt at a smart gun.
[03:44:09.888 --> 03:44:12.831]  The IP-1 from the German manufacturer Armitix.
[03:44:12.831 --> 03:44:21.918]  The gun is implanted with an electronic chip that allows it to be fired only if the shooter is wearing a companion watch into which a pin number has been entered.
[03:44:21.918 --> 03:44:31.425]  It was only offered in a .22 caliber, but it cost $1,800, five times the cost of other .22s, and not offered in a self-defense caliber.
[03:44:31.425 --> 03:44:32.606]  But it had other problems.
[03:44:32.606 --> 03:44:35.889]  It took seven push-button commands and 12 seconds before it could be fired.
[03:44:36.249 --> 03:44:41.856]  And it had three or four misfires per eleven round magazine, repeatedly.
[03:44:41.856 --> 03:44:46.802]  So, it's not good, it's not fast, it's not cheap, and it's laughably unreliable.
[03:44:46.802 --> 03:44:51.288]  Not even the gun grabbers in New Jersey could call it smart with a straight face.
[03:44:51.288 --> 03:44:51.929]  And that's important.
[03:44:52.409 --> 03:45:00.753]  Because New Jersey has passed a law that once a smart gun exists in the market, only smart guns will be allowed to be sold in New Jersey.
[03:45:00.753 --> 03:45:07.957]  This is why gun users threatened a boycott of manufacturers like Smith & Wesson when they announced plans to work on a smart gun.
[03:45:07.957 --> 03:45:14.380]  I don't exactly understand this and maybe there will be somebody in the audience who explains it to me.
[03:45:14.380 --> 03:45:15.120]  Back in 1997, the CEO of Colt,
[03:45:18.138 --> 03:45:25.850]  Said we can design or starting to develop guns where you can only use it if you've got a chip.
[03:45:25.850 --> 03:45:32.460]  A boycott was called against them and they had to back off of developing that technology.
[03:45:33.673 --> 03:45:35.774]  Uh, the same with Smith & Wesson.
[03:45:35.774 --> 03:45:42.356]  Smith & Wesson responded to the boycott by cancelling smart gun research and firing the CEO that proposed it.
[03:45:42.356 --> 03:45:45.237]  So users are not asking for smart guns.
[03:45:45.237 --> 03:45:48.138]  As a matter of fact, they strongly don't want them.
[03:45:48.138 --> 03:45:49.658]  So what does Obama do?
[03:45:49.658 --> 03:45:55.520]  He will use his unlimited federal reserves to build one and shove it down our throats.
[03:45:55.520 --> 03:45:58.221]  Obama likes to compare smart guns to cell phones.
[03:45:58.892 --> 03:46:04.457]  I didn't bring my cell phone with me, but my cell phone like yours, I just put my thumbprint on.
[03:46:04.457 --> 03:46:06.319]  Well, why can't you do that for a gun?
[03:46:06.319 --> 03:46:09.622]  The cell phone analogy goes beyond biometric locks.
[03:46:09.622 --> 03:46:17.509]  The government has the capability to shut down all cell phones in an area, or selectively turn off their cameras, although they haven't used that capability yet.
[03:46:17.509 --> 03:46:24.475]  And they want the ability to track and disable your gun, even if it still works with all the added technology bells and whistles.
[03:46:25.347 --> 03:46:28.961]  If there's an app that can help us find a missing tablet.
[03:46:28.961 --> 03:46:29.723]  If we can do it for...
[03:46:30.939 --> 03:46:34.320]  Your iPad, there's no reason we can't do it with a stolen gun.
[03:46:34.320 --> 03:46:35.781]  Here's the bottom line.
[03:46:35.781 --> 03:46:40.262]  If you let someone get close enough to take your gun away, you're not doing it right.
[03:46:40.262 --> 03:46:44.364]  If you let children get access to your guns, you're not doing it right.
[03:46:44.364 --> 03:46:50.086]  We need smart people who control their guns, not smart guns controlled by government.
[03:46:50.086 --> 03:46:56.988]  We need better training and education, not unaffordable, unreliable weapons that can be disabled by the government.
[03:46:56.988 --> 03:46:59.049]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:47:01.308 --> 03:47:05.511]  All right, again, you can see that at the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[03:47:05.511 --> 03:47:09.294]  I want to tell you that we've got a special that is ending today.
[03:47:09.294 --> 03:47:13.938]  Survival Shield X2, Super Male Vitality, both of those are available at 15% off.
[03:47:13.938 --> 03:47:15.959]  Today is the very last day of that sale.
[03:47:15.959 --> 03:47:19.042]  You can find that at InfoWars.com.
[03:47:19.042 --> 03:47:23.726]  And as you're looking at Snowmageddon going across Washington, consider the fact
[03:47:24.406 --> 03:47:28.308]  That you never really know when catastrophe is going to strike.
[03:47:28.308 --> 03:47:29.468]  You need to be prepared.
[03:47:29.468 --> 03:47:30.949]  You need to stock up in advance.
[03:47:30.949 --> 03:47:32.930]  That's what we've been telling people all along.
[03:47:32.930 --> 03:47:35.911]  Look at the products that we have at InfoWars Select.
[03:47:35.911 --> 03:47:38.572]  Make sure that you've got at least food on your shelf.
[03:47:38.572 --> 03:47:45.595]  Because right now, for the people in Washington, if they didn't prepare in advance, they're not going to get any food off of the store shelves.
[03:47:45.595 --> 03:47:47.796]  They can't even get to the store.
[03:47:47.796 --> 03:47:49.177]  And as I mentioned yesterday,
[03:47:49.637 --> 03:47:52.860]  I ran into that same situation in Buffalo, New York, of all places.
[03:47:52.860 --> 03:47:58.885]  It was a snowstorm, and you would think people in Buffalo, New York, we have some of the heaviest snow anywhere in the country, they would be prepared for it.
[03:47:58.885 --> 03:48:10.494]  But back in 2000, around Thanksgiving, we were going through there, and the snow fell in a record... it wasn't a record snowfall, but it was the most snow they'd had in a 24-hour period.
[03:48:10.494 --> 03:48:13.857]  It fell so quickly that people got trapped on the street.
[03:48:14.657 --> 03:48:22.148]  Most of the people there are assuming that the government is going to keep the roads clear for them and they don't have to worry about providing for themselves a four-wheel drive.
[03:48:22.148 --> 03:48:23.930]  Most of them had little tiny cars.
[03:48:23.930 --> 03:48:24.671]  We were heading north.
[03:48:24.671 --> 03:48:28.597]  I had an SUV that could go through the snow because I was expecting to see that.
[03:48:28.597 --> 03:48:31.140]  They were expecting, however, that the government was going to take care of them.
[03:48:31.761 --> 03:48:36.965]  Many of them got their cars stranded just like they did in Washington with one inch of snow.
[03:48:36.965 --> 03:48:47.354]  Some of the people in Washington after sitting for five hours with nothing moving and presumably what happened was people had wrecks and then other people got tired of sitting there in their car and after five hours they just turned the car off and walked.
[03:48:47.734 --> 03:48:49.735]  That was the kind of thing we were seeing in Buffalo.
[03:48:49.735 --> 03:49:00.221]  And the people in Buffalo were stranded for days in retail areas, many of them, because they were relying on government to provide protection for them, to keep the roads cleared.
[03:49:00.221 --> 03:49:06.425]  And even in Buffalo, you can't always count on the government to keep the roads clear of snow.
[03:49:07.065 --> 03:49:09.087]  We have unexpected situations that arise.
[03:49:09.087 --> 03:49:17.814]  I mean, it wasn't that they were doing a bad job of clearing the snow, but they couldn't clear the snow at that point because you had all these parked cars all over the place, so they couldn't get the snow plows through.
[03:49:17.814 --> 03:49:19.015]  That's what made it last for so long.
[03:49:19.015 --> 03:49:25.220]  So, bottom line, make sure you have taken efforts to protect yourself, to store up the essentials that you need.
[03:49:25.220 --> 03:49:29.363]  One of the things that you need is food, and of course, you can find that at InfoWars Select.
[03:49:29.363 --> 03:49:35.488]  And again, we have a sale on Survival Shield X2, Nascent Iodine, and Supermail Vitality ends today, 15% off.
[03:49:37.961 --> 03:49:42.442]  We're going to play a report from Rex Jones when we come back after the break.
[03:49:42.442 --> 03:49:47.883]  In the short amount of time that we've got left, I want to quickly talk about what's going on with National Review.
[03:49:47.883 --> 03:50:01.746]  One of the things that really concerned me about this is that when they get so concerned about one candidate in the presidential race that they will devote an entire issue to trying to take him down.
[03:50:01.746 --> 03:50:02.986]  Do you realize what's going on here?
[03:50:03.894 --> 03:50:06.635]  It's something, it's a trap that we all fall into.
[03:50:06.635 --> 03:50:11.397]  But it's especially true of people who are highly partisan in the Republican and Democrat parties.
[03:50:11.397 --> 03:50:18.861]  Highly partisan conservatives and liberals who put so much at stake on the party itself.
[03:50:18.861 --> 03:50:24.023]  It's the cult of the omnipotent president that they're really trying to sell you here.
[03:50:24.023 --> 03:50:32.467]  They want to tell you that all the problems that we have in America are because Barack Obama is in power, and that if we get the right guy in office, everything will be solved.
[03:50:33.183 --> 03:50:34.903]  No, the problems are very systemic.
[03:50:34.903 --> 03:50:37.504]  As I was pointing out, the problems of the bureaucracy earlier.
[03:50:37.504 --> 03:50:38.624]  Think about the bureaucracy.
[03:50:38.624 --> 03:50:41.945]  It's not just the Supreme Court that has a lifetime appointment.
[03:50:41.945 --> 03:50:42.985]  It's these bureaucrats.
[03:50:42.985 --> 03:50:46.346]  It basically takes an act of Congress to fire any of them.
[03:50:46.346 --> 03:50:50.847]  And when they distract you about what you can do at the local level, that's what's really dangerous.
[03:50:50.847 --> 03:50:51.687]  Stay with us.
[03:50:51.687 --> 03:50:57.348]  We're going to be right back with a report by Rex Jones about what it's like to grow up under the TSA's groping hands.
[03:50:59.386 --> 03:51:01.387]  Are you sneezing, coughing, and aching?
[03:51:01.387 --> 03:51:05.309]  Do you have a sore throat, a fever, or the sniffles?
[03:51:05.309 --> 03:51:11.132]  There's no reason to be sick this cold and flu season with immune system support from Supernatural Silver.

[03:51:20.977 --> 03:51:27.299]  Antibiotics can damage good microflora and often leave behind bacteria which can cause problems later on.
[03:51:27.299 --> 03:51:30.700]  If you're sick of being sick, try Supernatural Silver.
[03:51:30.700 --> 03:51:39.423]  Supernatural Silver, the number one choice of thousands for a safe and effective way to protect against the many diseases and illnesses that we are facing today.

[03:51:49.506 --> 03:52:02.873]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[03:52:02.873 --> 03:52:03.513]  It's true.
[03:52:03.513 --> 03:52:07.655]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[03:52:07.655 --> 03:52:10.056]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[03:52:10.056 --> 03:52:14.518]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[03:52:14.838 --> 03:52:27.703]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.
[03:52:27.703 --> 03:52:31.205]  Big Berkey Water Filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[03:52:31.505 --> 03:52:34.147]  The gold standard in water purification.

[03:53:59.249 --> 03:54:06.197]  Recently, I saw a video of 10-year-old Mandela Payne, who was given a repetitive full-body pat-down, which scared the girl and disgusted her father.
[03:54:06.197 --> 03:54:12.625]  Her father taped the incident, and later posted the video on YouTube, as he was outraged by the egregious and overreaching government behavior.
[03:54:12.625 --> 03:54:14.988]  The TSA claims that the pat-down was necessary,
[03:54:15.168 --> 03:54:23.976]  When they noticed the threatening juice box that she had in her backpack, she was patted down multiple times to make sure that her and her threatening juice box were not terroristic sympathizers.
[03:54:23.976 --> 03:54:30.302]  Meanwhile, the TSA was allowing thousands of illegal immigrants to fly in from Mexico without a travel visa or passport.
[03:54:30.302 --> 03:54:33.805]  Here's what the Judicial Watch said about these incidents in July of 2014.
[03:54:35.006 --> 03:54:45.318]  To ease the load, the Obama administration is transferring the UACs, more than 53,000 by the government's count, to other parts of the country, including Florida, Nebraska, and Massachusetts.
[03:54:45.318 --> 03:54:49.663]  Apparently, a large number of UACs are being transported to their new destination on airplanes.
[03:54:50.183 --> 03:54:55.086]  Most don't have a valid identification and are being allowed to board aircrafts with just a slip of paper.
[03:54:55.086 --> 03:54:59.929]  And on top of that, we have hundreds of thousands of Middle Eastern refugees seeking asylum in the U.S.
[03:54:59.929 --> 03:55:10.055]  And all the heads of the FBI, National Counterterrorism Organization, and Homeland Security have all admitted under oath that their agencies do not have the capability to properly vet the refugees.
[03:55:10.754 --> 03:55:17.942]  We don't have the systems in place on the ground to collect the information to vet.
[03:55:17.942 --> 03:55:19.584]  That would be the concern.
[03:55:19.584 --> 03:55:25.810]  Yes, I think that's the challenge we're all talking about, is that we can only query against that which we have collected.
[03:55:26.519 --> 03:55:33.002]  You can't account for what you don't know, and that goes to the intelligence deficit that I think is embedded in your question.
[03:55:33.002 --> 03:55:40.145]  We may have somebody who comes to us and is simply not on our radar for any discernible reason.
[03:55:40.145 --> 03:55:46.668]  And there may also be the possibility that somebody decides to do something bad after they've been admitted through the process.
[03:55:47.432 --> 03:55:53.777]  Even the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan agrees with Donald Trump's statement on not taking Muslims into the U.S.
[03:55:53.777 --> 03:55:56.239]  until a proper vetting process is established.
[03:55:56.239 --> 03:56:11.452]  Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
[03:56:11.452 --> 03:56:13.673]  So when Mr. Trump said
[03:56:15.751 --> 03:56:22.134]  We can't allow these Muslims, refugees, into America.
[03:56:22.134 --> 03:56:41.865]  Now, a lot of people were upset with him, but I know, sir, that the hatred for America in the Muslim world, so in this way, Mr. Trump, I think, is wise to vet.
[03:56:43.854 --> 03:56:49.702]  Finally, our southern border is wide open for people and illegal drugs to pour into this country.
[03:56:58.894 --> 03:57:12.265]  InfoWars reporters have documented that our Border Patrol is busting illegals across the country, and Border Ranchers have found Muslim prayer rugs, English-to-Arabic dictionaries, and even Middle Eastern money, which proves that we are under an invasion of epic proportions.
[03:57:12.265 --> 03:57:23.654]  Going back to the TSA, they want to end the process of opting out of naked body scanners, and they are finally implementing the national ID card to fly, which will make the driver's license of some states not a valid ID to board a plane.
[03:57:23.974 --> 03:57:32.722]  Our country is literally locking all the internal doors while leaving the outside doors wide open, too, and practically inviting terrorists to come in and wreak havoc on our great country.
[03:57:32.722 --> 03:57:38.367]  And what is this doing to people my age, who've always known the TSA, Dacronian, Fourth Amendment-violating practices?
[03:57:38.367 --> 03:57:43.051]  We think this type of international checkpoint behavior is normal and to be expected at every large event.
[03:57:43.291 --> 03:57:49.292]  Our roads, bus stations, trade stations, and airports are becoming East German Stasi prison staging centers.
[03:57:49.292 --> 03:57:54.873]  This is not the country that our founding fathers envisioned, and I will tell you with three quotes proving this.
[03:57:54.873 --> 03:57:57.533]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[03:57:57.533 --> 03:58:00.094]  And when the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[03:58:00.094 --> 03:58:01.274]  Thomas Jefferson.
[03:58:01.274 --> 03:58:06.855]  Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security would deserve neither and lose both.
[03:58:06.855 --> 03:58:08.415]  Ben Franklin.
[03:58:08.415 --> 03:58:10.856]  Make yourself cheap and the wolves will eat you.
[03:58:10.856 --> 03:58:11.656]  Benjamin Franklin.
[03:58:12.588 --> 03:58:18.590]  We need to go back to what our founding fathers envisioned before the TSA fueling up 10-year-old girls becomes an art form.
[03:58:18.590 --> 03:58:23.192]  This is Rex Jones reporting for InfoWars.com and the InfoWars Nightly News.
