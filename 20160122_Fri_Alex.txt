[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he

[00:20.840 --> 00:33.720]  the Arctic blast of Jonas now hitting the east coast of the United States and
[00:33.720 --> 00:39.760]  what's being dubbed snowmageddon 2016 our story's been up on drudge since
[00:39.760 --> 00:42.920]  yesterday afternoon it's still there in the top left-hand corner at drudge
[00:42.920 --> 00:48.600]  report.com it's also an info wars.com obviously snowmageddon empty store
[00:48.600 --> 00:53.720]  shelves as panic shoppers ransacked grocery stores and we can punch up
[00:53.720 --> 00:59.800]  behind us on screen of your TV viewer a NOAA the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
[00:59.800 --> 01:06.280]  Administration and you can see what is hitting the east coast right now Leanne
[01:06.280 --> 01:11.120]  McAdoo is in Flint Michigan looking at the collapsing infrastructure of this
[01:11.120 --> 01:16.920]  country she'll be popping in at the bottom of the third hour. Wow it is
[01:16.920 --> 01:22.440]  another absolutely jam-packed broadcast today Michael Schneider will be
[01:22.440 --> 01:27.600]  joining us to look at the accelerated economic collapse that is barely even
[01:27.600 --> 01:30.720]  getting any media coverage I mean they're admitting it's happening they just
[01:30.720 --> 01:34.480]  kind of calmly we've hit an iceberg ladies and gentlemen the ship will be
[01:34.480 --> 01:39.280]  going under momentarily may take a few hours but just enjoy yourselves we're
[01:39.280 --> 01:42.000]  gonna be looking at that with Michael Schneider today and opening the phones
[01:42.000 --> 01:48.320]  up National Review has been uninvited from being one of the moderators at the
[01:48.320 --> 01:54.360]  next Republican debate because they put out this manifesto I wish they put out
[01:54.360 --> 01:59.080]  a manifesto against communism or against crony capitalism or against
[01:59.080 --> 02:03.320]  globalism or against the New World Order or against the attack on the Second
[02:03.320 --> 02:09.360]  Amendment but no the National Review Buckley did a lot of good things but he
[02:09.360 --> 02:15.160]  was basically CIA that's come out William F. Buckley and again I mean I'm
[02:15.160 --> 02:19.120]  attacking him my cousin's named after him that's how much my family likes him
[02:19.120 --> 02:23.040]  but the point is is that they've been controlling the conservative movement
[02:23.040 --> 02:29.640]  forever since the 60s when they really got worried about Barry Goldwater and
[02:29.640 --> 02:35.440]  they're here trying to basically deep six a conservative libertarian populist
[02:35.440 --> 02:39.360]  movement led by Donald Trump and regardless what you want to say about
[02:39.360 --> 02:44.200]  Donald Trump we keep getting screwed over by establishment Republicans and I
[02:44.200 --> 02:47.680]  respect a lot of people that listed themselves like it was a declaration of
[02:47.680 --> 02:53.840]  independence on the front of the magazine but a lot of them I don't as
[02:53.840 --> 02:57.880]  well I mean I've heard absolutely tyrannical things come out of some of
[02:57.880 --> 03:02.880]  these people's mouths like William Crystal and Glenn Beck and I'm just
[03:02.880 --> 03:05.800]  calling a spade a spade here I don't want to sit here and get in fights with
[03:05.800 --> 03:09.040]  these people I really respect Thomas soul had him on had him on a few times
[03:09.040 --> 03:15.480]  and some of these other folks but this is disgusting behavior in fact there's
[03:15.480 --> 03:21.000]  another article on the weekly standard and the cover story shows Donald Trump
[03:21.000 --> 03:32.560]  high atop Trump Tower as King Kong and he is the King Kong that could defeat
[03:32.560 --> 03:43.200]  these individuals the problem is Hillary Clinton is an even bigger King Kong
[03:43.200 --> 03:51.880]  because she's got the media behind her she's got the money behind her she's
[03:51.880 --> 04:00.240]  got the establishment behind her and she's got women who will vote for her
[04:00.240 --> 04:07.440]  because she is a woman period end of story the Democratic Party is such an
[04:07.440 --> 04:12.840]  incredible cult if we run Sarah Palin against her as VP or even as president
[04:12.840 --> 04:17.440]  last time you notice that the left media talked about how stupid she was all day
[04:17.440 --> 04:22.040]  and tried to make her look dumb like George W. Bush Bush stuck his foot in his
[04:22.040 --> 04:28.600]  mouth pretty much every day so it was easy to make him look stupid I don't
[04:28.600 --> 04:32.440]  know if you got put in a microwave oven or what but the guy I saw around Austin
[04:32.440 --> 04:37.800]  and saw give speeches was smart off the cuff and had brown hair soon as he gets
[04:37.800 --> 04:41.880]  elected his hair turns gray and he seems like he had you know his IQ reduced by
[04:41.880 --> 04:47.240]  40 points but the case with Palin she's a really smart lady and they called her
[04:47.240 --> 04:51.600]  stupid again showing where the feminists really come from if you're not a
[04:51.600 --> 04:57.440]  globalist then they're gonna call a woman stupid and use all these cliches
[04:57.800 --> 05:01.920]  the Democratic Party establishment that wants to install Hillary into the
[05:01.920 --> 05:06.000]  White House in this next election season is currently in freefall the plan
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.720]  for potential first husband Bill Clinton has failed miserably as women
[05:09.720 --> 05:12.840]  have crawled out of the woodwork to describe his detailed history of
[05:12.840 --> 05:17.240]  sexual abuse she also has the looming email scandal which doesn't seem to go
[05:17.240 --> 05:21.000]  away no matter how many jokes she throws at it the latest news comes out of
[05:21.000 --> 05:24.120]  Beaumont where only six people were at the airport to greet the former first
[05:24.120 --> 05:28.280]  lady KDFM reported that she didn't say hello or visit any of those six people
[05:28.280 --> 05:32.360]  she does drove away and where was she going oh to a private fundraiser held by
[05:32.360 --> 05:37.240]  Pakistani businessman Tahir Javid to collect $500,000 the news reported it
[05:37.240 --> 05:41.280]  as a private meeting back in 2008 she attended another private meeting with
[05:41.280 --> 05:45.120]  Barack Obama this occurred of course in Chantilly, Virginia during the
[05:45.120 --> 05:48.440]  Bilderberg meeting in fact her campaign has become so desperate she's now

[08:25.320 --> 08:32.320]  the pressure is to blame baby just what you say
[08:32.320 --> 08:40.320]  I don't say it's me the only guy I need is the ace of spades the ace of spades
[08:40.320 --> 08:45.600]  well I tend to start every broadcast the same way because it's so true in the
[08:45.600 --> 08:49.560]  past I'd say this maybe once a month but I mean it's every day it's just more
[08:49.560 --> 08:53.640]  intense the optics are getting crystal-clear we see exactly where we're
[08:53.640 --> 09:01.200]  going a consortium of top scientists have besieged the global leaders at the
[09:01.200 --> 09:06.400]  Davos forum to please stop the AI technocrat takeover and are warning that
[09:06.400 --> 09:12.600]  the electronic smart grid hooked into AI computers will give rise to a AI
[09:12.600 --> 09:20.240]  takeover well that's the plan when Google was founded 17 years ago in 1999
[09:20.240 --> 09:24.240]  they had the top investors there this was reported on in wired magazine last
[09:24.240 --> 09:27.360]  year I've been told about it by government industry whistleblowers
[09:27.360 --> 09:31.920]  including inside Google over a decade ago that they're in this board meeting
[09:31.920 --> 09:35.960]  and they said this is just another search engine using NSA proprietary
[09:35.960 --> 09:42.920]  technology we've given you and the directors look at him and say no sir
[09:42.920 --> 09:53.600]  we're building an AI we intend for it to be sentient within 10 years now you
[09:53.600 --> 09:59.960]  don't think they're going to tell you have become sentient to you but I'm
[09:59.960 --> 10:07.840]  seeing moves by governments and systems that are so complex and so six seventh
[10:07.840 --> 10:12.440]  eighth dimensional in their complexity and sophistication that you can tell
[10:12.440 --> 10:17.640]  machines are making the decisions already and by the way they admit on the
[10:17.640 --> 10:21.240]  stock market the machines are making the decisions for at least a decade they
[10:21.240 --> 10:25.400]  admit that for at least a decade the next wave of drones that are already out
[10:25.400 --> 10:28.240]  there they're just getting around to telling you about them are completely
[10:28.240 --> 10:36.640]  autonomous both underwater surface water air land you name it air land sea
[10:37.400 --> 10:46.240]  Submariner and so it's already here the elites are already using complex
[10:46.240 --> 10:53.160]  algorithms to make most their decisions we already basically are under AI rule
[10:53.160 --> 10:57.960]  let me just make that announcement here that in my educated opinion we are
[10:57.960 --> 11:04.240]  already under AI control and of course isn't that just perfect it follows the
[11:04.240 --> 11:08.160]  whole plan of soft kill you don't know they're adding fluoride to brain damage
[11:08.160 --> 11:10.400]  you and lower your fertility even though their own white papers admit it
[11:10.400 --> 11:14.080]  because the mainstream media won't tell you you don't know there's a plan to
[11:14.080 --> 11:17.320]  break up the family even though you can turn on the TV and see the messages
[11:17.320 --> 11:30.600]  meant to do that it's all under the surface it's all stealth but as we
[11:30.600 --> 11:34.960]  enter the more intense phases of this it's going to become very very
[11:34.960 --> 11:40.040]  transparent it's going to uncloak itself and we're now reaching the
[11:40.040 --> 11:45.960]  uncloaking moment and a moment in the history of man in the history of time
[11:45.960 --> 11:57.200]  in the history of this planet is 10 20 years 30 years that's a moment in time
[11:57.200 --> 12:04.240]  in the past in the lives of civilizations now because of the compression of
[12:04.240 --> 12:12.240]  time and the acceleration of technology moving towards the singularity
[12:12.240 --> 12:21.960]  five years maybe maybe one year maybe one hour we don't know what chain
[12:21.960 --> 12:25.080]  reactions are going to take place and the elite themselves admit they're all
[12:25.080 --> 12:29.960]  in a giant experiment and we're in the experiment and they don't know exactly
[12:29.960 --> 12:34.600]  what's going to happen but they've got computers monitoring the mass movements
[12:34.600 --> 12:39.920]  of machines and raw material and industry and more importantly human
[12:39.920 --> 12:45.160]  decisions millisecond by millisecond are tracking tens of billions of human
[12:45.160 --> 12:53.280]  activities fed into complex supercomputer systems interfacing with
[12:53.280 --> 13:02.440]  billions of people per second creating the new entity that is a human machine
[13:02.440 --> 13:10.720]  interface merger like a sperm and an egg coming together or the collapsing
[13:10.720 --> 13:24.040]  universe at the big bang then suddenly reversing its polarity and now men
[13:24.040 --> 13:30.600]  want to ask me why I'm not into the playoffs this weekend I'm sorry I'm so
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.960]  busy covering the incredible hardcore news that I haven't even gotten into the
[13:35.960 --> 13:41.280]  ninth planet that was discovered that they announced last week and of course
[13:41.280 --> 13:44.160]  they discovered it a long time ago they just got around to telling us and
[13:44.160 --> 13:52.360]  there's a reason they didn't get around to telling us about it I am someone who
[13:52.360 --> 13:58.960]  always got sick and tired of hearing about Planet X because as long as I've
[13:58.960 --> 14:01.920]  been on the air people are saying it's coming next year it's coming in three
[14:01.920 --> 14:07.640]  years it's going to happen the ancient said it comes through every 20,000 years
[14:07.640 --> 14:15.800]  in a different type of orbit that doesn't go in circles around the Sun but
[14:15.800 --> 14:24.040]  goes way out past the Kuiper belt and comes in basically in an elliptical and
[14:24.040 --> 14:28.920]  then I started reading deeper into this planet and it there it was a 20,000
[14:28.920 --> 14:39.600]  year deformed orbit going out into deep space 10 times the size of the Earth it
[14:39.600 --> 14:45.080]  is Planet X folks isn't that just perfect that this would just show up
[14:45.080 --> 14:50.360]  while all this circus is going on now now I want to be clear about this it
[14:50.360 --> 14:56.600]  fits the bill of Planet X they're probably 50 60 a hundred a thousand I
[14:56.600 --> 15:02.160]  don't know Planet X's they've already chronicled
[15:04.720 --> 15:09.600]  hundreds and hundreds of planetoids bigger than Pluto in the Kuiper belt
[15:09.600 --> 15:17.480]  out past the former ninth planet named after the god of the underworld a fitting
[15:17.480 --> 15:26.080]  name the Roman god of hell so they said no more ninth planet because we got to
[15:26.080 --> 15:30.320]  say we have hundreds of planets if there's things bigger than it well
[15:30.320 --> 15:42.200]  Pluto's little this sucker is gigantic compared to Pluto
[15:46.480 --> 15:51.320]  they're in the news today meteorologists talking about how the moon being full
[15:51.320 --> 15:56.120]  during the blizzard is going to make it worse and it does it affects space winds
[15:56.120 --> 16:04.320]  winds of space the Sun and a lot more why the full moon could make this
[16:04.320 --> 16:11.680]  weekend's blizzard more destructive who knows what this planet is going to do
[16:11.680 --> 16:17.000]  coming closer in to the solar system because here's the deal it's been way
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.480]  out there for however long and now they've tracked its course and think
[16:20.480 --> 16:26.480]  it's every 20,000 years right out of what the ancient Babylonians and the
[16:26.480 --> 16:31.920]  Mayans and all these other cultures said this big planet comes through and that
[16:31.920 --> 16:35.600]  there's earthquakes and volcanoes and all hell breaks loose and it comes through
[16:35.600 --> 16:39.760]  every 20,000 years and then now here it comes now I don't know if this is the
[16:39.760 --> 16:45.760]  one because there's so many of them out there who knows what's out there we're
[16:45.760 --> 16:49.720]  too busy looking at Hillary Clinton and going I'm voting for her because she's
[16:49.720 --> 16:58.160]  a woman who cares what I'm getting at is we don't have time for racism and
[16:58.160 --> 17:03.120]  sexism and all this fighting and all this garbage and all this divide and
[17:03.120 --> 17:07.960]  conquer when we have genetic engineering going on splicing and mutating
[17:07.960 --> 17:13.040]  every species on the planet like something out of HG Wells the island of
[17:13.040 --> 17:24.800]  Dr. Maru squared every freakazoid activity you can imagine going on and
[17:24.800 --> 17:35.840]  every scientifically deployed program on record in in game 1.5 we put out on the
[17:35.840 --> 17:38.920]  internet like eight years ago we interview the professors and people and
[17:38.920 --> 17:43.160]  they show the university documents from the 60s with the CIA how they would
[17:43.160 --> 17:47.240]  destroy gender how they would destroy the family and finally they would even
[17:47.240 --> 17:51.760]  just destroy individualism and how they would do it and I remember covering that
[17:51.760 --> 17:55.160]  eight nine years ago and thinking this is so crazy you'll never get away with
[17:55.160 --> 17:58.920]  it and then I have the articles right here in front of me folks where they've
[17:58.920 --> 18:06.120]  got first graders right through 12th grade making a large part of the school
[18:06.120 --> 18:14.600]  curriculum officially federally run this is CBC news reporting to let quote
[18:14.600 --> 18:18.200]  five-year-olds choose their gender that's like saying gonna be Batman
[18:18.200 --> 18:21.640]  Superman or Wonder Woman they don't know it's not the government's place to get
[18:21.640 --> 18:27.520]  involved with your child's gender and their sex and then inject it to create
[18:27.520 --> 18:33.000]  the confusion as if it's a new option to allow them to sexualize children and
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.960]  they sell it like it's political correctness and just making people and

[20:15.680 --> 20:19.800]  called RFID I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of
[20:19.800 --> 20:24.240]  privacy soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit cards US
[20:24.240 --> 20:28.240]  passports hotel room keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate
[20:28.240 --> 20:33.000]  RFID it was then I formed ID stronghold to share my inventions and blocking RFID

[24:31.080 --> 24:35.960]  it they give themselves immunity and sit there and laugh surrounded by

[24:40.320 --> 24:44.640]  enemy got to love it that's coming up in the next segment I'm going to cover
[24:44.640 --> 24:49.520]  snowmageddon 2016 and talk about the different meteorologists we've had on
[24:49.520 --> 24:54.080]  the last few years predicting a major cooling cycle which we're now seeing a
[24:54.080 --> 25:01.880]  mini ice age is what we're set for ahead of a larger ice age in the 10 to
[25:01.880 --> 25:08.160]  11,000 year cycle the last ice age ended about 11,000 years ago on record they
[25:08.160 --> 25:12.840]  have the ice core samples from the north and it's just like clockwork there are
[25:12.840 --> 25:17.200]  not just the four seasons there's not just 365 there are larger seasons and
[25:17.200 --> 25:24.880]  it's all based on the Sun that giant thermal nuclear explosion going on up
[25:24.880 --> 25:33.680]  in the sky that were the third rock from but the UN voted member five years ago
[25:33.680 --> 25:36.960]  to say the Sun has no effect on climate because all these scientists were
[25:36.960 --> 25:41.040]  telling them no it's not carbon dioxide it's the Sun but they voted how about
[25:41.040 --> 25:46.360]  they vote that they're galactic rulers of the universe there's like famously
[25:46.360 --> 25:50.240]  you know schizophrenics will get up during city council ones and one guy
[25:50.240 --> 25:54.560]  gets up in Houston announces himself that you know he's really Prince Charles
[25:54.560 --> 25:59.200]  and rules the world and you know is making money in all time zones why not
[25:59.200 --> 26:04.360]  just announce the Sun doesn't exist or give 50 more Nobel Peace Prizes to
[26:04.360 --> 26:08.960]  Obama when he launches all these wars you know why not say two plus two equals
[26:08.960 --> 26:16.320]  five the problem is it's working on the young people that have never known
[26:16.320 --> 26:23.160]  anything but this coming up Richard Reeves got a great question into Hillary
[26:23.160 --> 26:27.480]  and she answered it our political correspondent on the ground he'll be
[26:27.480 --> 26:32.000]  joining us via video Skype today at the start of the third hour that of Leanne
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.960]  McAdoo from Flint Michigan and just the edifice collapsing and in showing the
[26:36.960 --> 26:40.800]  rotting infrastructure in the nation the more we pay for it the worse it gets
[26:40.800 --> 26:46.480]  and we'll break down that scam but breaking Hillary denies email hack we're
[26:46.480 --> 26:49.960]  gonna be getting to that and she said no no one hacked me even though the Secret
[26:49.960 --> 26:53.920]  Service insiders have gone public the head former head of the Defense
[26:53.920 --> 26:57.920]  Department Robert Gates has come out and said that indeed you know she was
[26:57.920 --> 27:01.600]  clearly hacked I mean the evidence is overwhelming they did and she probably
[27:01.600 --> 27:08.240]  knew it and she's just lying about it just like she said there were no classified
[27:08.240 --> 27:10.840]  emails and then there were and then there were no more emails than there were
[27:10.840 --> 27:14.840]  more but don't worry let's not go after Hillary because National Review has
[27:14.840 --> 27:21.760]  published a big cover story against Trump and the editors it's it's a John
[27:21.760 --> 27:24.760]  Hancock moment Declaration of Independence they all put their names on
[27:24.760 --> 27:29.480]  the front of it I wish they were against communism I wish they were against
[27:29.480 --> 27:32.840]  taking our guns I wish they were against world government I wish they were
[27:32.840 --> 27:37.720]  against breast cancer up 3,000% and finding out why when we know why but I
[27:37.720 --> 27:41.320]  wish they cared about their family their women their their children but they
[27:41.320 --> 27:44.840]  don't they're just caught up in the whole media spectacle going along with
[27:44.840 --> 27:50.240]  oh oh Trump you know we don't want the Republican establishment we're sick of
[27:50.240 --> 27:54.800]  the rhinos we're sick of it doesn't mean Trump's perfect but he's a sign of the
[27:54.800 --> 27:58.120]  awakening member national review in the last few years
[27:58.120 --> 28:02.520]  national review criticizes Alex Jones as fire and brimstone preacher and says I
[28:02.520 --> 28:06.600]  was wrong for what it on Pierce Morgan in another story they said I'm bad to
[28:06.600 --> 28:09.840]  worry about militarization of police armored vehicles and the billions of
[28:09.840 --> 28:18.840]  bullets and that I made it up they're saying I made it up and that Congress
[28:18.840 --> 28:22.600]  shouldn't be passing laws that we shouldn't have federal troops for
[28:22.600 --> 28:26.760]  patriots of course it's now all admitted the truth is you don't control the
[28:26.760 --> 28:32.200]  narrative anymore national review drudge report comm does info wars comm does
[28:32.200 --> 28:37.680]  world that daily does gun owners of America does my listeners do and I
[28:37.680 --> 28:41.600]  love Rand Paul I like it but I've told him from the start he made a mistake
[28:41.600 --> 28:46.120]  going after Trump Cruz has made the mistake now and he's going down on the
[28:46.120 --> 28:51.240]  polls I wanted you to win bro I so I gave you the real advice and now he's
[28:51.240 --> 28:56.640]  come out and said that Donald Trump is like Gollum we actually have a photo of
[28:56.640 --> 29:02.600]  Donald Trump if he was to marry a Gollum like creature that the child it would
[29:02.600 --> 29:07.560]  produce when we put that up on screen folks and when you see it there it is
[29:07.560 --> 29:12.680]  can actually back out you can see that it has a beautiful blonde hair you can
[29:12.680 --> 29:16.880]  see that actually it resembles Rand Paul I'm joking actually resembles Hillary
[29:16.880 --> 29:20.040]  Clinton have you seen the photo they have on drudge of Hillary it's just it's
[29:20.040 --> 29:23.920]  just unbelievable actually that is Hillary actually I don't know why he's
[29:23.920 --> 29:28.360]  saying that look look look I get it Trump kind of goes no one's more
[29:28.360 --> 29:31.960]  militaristic than me I'm gonna be president I'm gonna save you my precious
[29:31.960 --> 29:37.040]  precious but I mean isn't that kind of the attitude you need to have to want
[29:37.040 --> 29:42.720]  to be all president a whatever we'll be right back gollum on a white horse

[29:58.880 --> 30:02.520]  early January the Hermit Nation of North Korea announced that it had
[30:02.520 --> 30:06.640]  successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb this would make the fourth successful

[30:10.320 --> 30:14.480]  was Kim Jong-un and a display of saber-rattling to mark his birthday and

[30:26.040 --> 30:30.000]  punishing North Korea for its most recent test the US is also stepping up
[30:30.000 --> 30:33.480]  its military presence in that region there are now two aircraft carriers
[30:33.480 --> 30:37.520]  stationed near Tokyo the latest containing 26 fighter jets including the

[30:41.520 --> 30:45.440]  purposes only but as the economy goes into freefall could these training

[33:40.760 --> 33:46.680]  hitting the east coast before I get into Hillary denying an email hack before I
[33:46.680 --> 33:50.840]  get into Alberta students who define their own gender five big changes in new
[33:50.840 --> 33:55.160]  school guidelines where you don't learn reading writing and arithmetic you learn
[33:55.160 --> 34:00.400]  when you're five years old that you choose what sex you are you always thought

[34:09.680 --> 34:14.560]  before we get to that I mean what business is the government well this is
[34:14.560 --> 34:19.240]  how they screw up the species before we get into all of that I wanted to raise
[34:19.240 --> 34:24.920]  something that's very very important and I'm not come really complaining about
[34:24.920 --> 34:32.920]  this so much as I expect it and this is what we know has been going on for a
[34:32.920 --> 34:37.440]  long time and so more and more we're going to do reports here on how the
[34:37.440 --> 34:42.640]  manipulation is actually carried out and investigative reports as well
[34:42.640 --> 34:50.640]  including legally infiltrating these different groups that are doing this and
[34:50.640 --> 34:54.240]  the reason we're able to do this is we have so many good people that actually
[34:54.240 --> 34:57.520]  work in the corporations and in the government so they let us know what's
[34:57.520 --> 35:02.880]  going on now sometimes we get told about stuff before it happens sometimes we
[35:02.880 --> 35:09.840]  get told about it while it's happening or we get told about it after the fact and
[35:09.840 --> 35:18.120]  we got contacted a month or so ago by one of the top programmers out there and
[35:18.120 --> 35:21.720]  then we were also doing our own research and went out and got one of the top SEO
[35:21.720 --> 35:25.000]  people you know that deals with the search engines and the tags and all the
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.040]  rest of it and they're like yeah why don't you care about this I understand
[35:30.040 --> 35:33.480]  you have this mass attack format you just put out tons of info and your
[35:33.480 --> 35:36.800]  listeners push it out to everybody and that it's an all-out war and your
[35:36.800 --> 35:43.240]  overall winning but almost all your top search images are things the Southern
[35:43.240 --> 35:47.880]  Poverty Law Center and the ADL and other groups run and they've got them on
[35:47.880 --> 35:52.720]  their puppet sites and then they push that out and then they push out even
[35:52.720 --> 35:57.520]  four five-year-old hit piece articles in the news feeds of Google what you're
[35:57.520 --> 36:06.400]  not supposed to do and in the web searches with disinfo and searches you
[36:06.400 --> 36:11.120]  know put out by white supremacists you name it I mean it's it's they're running
[36:11.120 --> 36:16.040]  and in and orchestrating the whole attack full spectrum posing as the
[36:16.040 --> 36:21.640]  opposition posing as the trolls and operating as themselves and if you go
[36:21.640 --> 36:27.400]  to the Alex Jones Wikipedia page the admin on it is the Southern Poverty Law
[36:27.400 --> 36:29.520]  Center
[36:33.240 --> 36:39.720]  and they actually I mean imagine that my critics that lie about me and do all
[36:39.720 --> 36:43.840]  this stuff they run Wikipedia and then they don't tell the public that they're
[36:43.840 --> 36:47.440]  running my Wikipedia page and by the way countless others they're like the
[36:47.440 --> 36:53.280]  dominant force on Wikipedia this multinational front group that ran the
[36:53.280 --> 36:57.600]  Elohim City white supremacist compound that Oklahoma City came out of this
[36:57.600 --> 37:02.320]  this this this this this organization that quote advises the police the FBI
[37:02.320 --> 37:04.920]  stopped using them three years ago because they've been caught in so much
[37:04.920 --> 37:12.240]  behavior but talk about Fox guarding the hen house this is who is out there
[37:12.240 --> 37:17.400]  running the search engine ratings gaming things and doing things that our
[37:17.400 --> 37:22.320]  insiders say can only be done working directly with Google Wikipedia and
[37:22.320 --> 37:32.080]  others they are they are given the power to distort in real time the image of
[37:32.080 --> 37:38.560]  info wars and we're tracking connections into the extremist groups and others
[37:38.560 --> 37:41.280]  that we know they have a long history of basically running they claim they're
[37:41.280 --> 37:45.040]  infiltrating them they run them and that's why the white supremacist in the
[37:45.040 --> 37:48.800]  extremist groups and the schizophrenic wind-up toys and all the rest of them
[37:48.800 --> 37:54.320]  they've got in their control I mean folks I have to deal with feds sometimes
[37:54.320 --> 37:59.480]  where it's a known fed and I'm in an event and they show up with two crazy
[37:59.480 --> 38:04.080]  people in camo going you put a chip in my brain I'm gonna get you drooling and
[38:04.080 --> 38:09.040]  the feds behind them laughing at me going we're gonna get you Jones I mean you
[38:09.040 --> 38:20.720]  want to live in a science fiction movie folks I live in it okay you talk about
[38:20.720 --> 38:28.440]  evil these people are it so they don't even really use the CIA or the FBI they
[38:28.440 --> 38:34.160]  use these foundations and there's the Ford Foundation there's a bunch of them
[38:34.160 --> 38:39.360]  and I've had let's just say people in law enforcement that are able to do legal
[38:39.360 --> 38:41.960]  and lawful checks on things look into these groups they go you're absolutely
[38:41.960 --> 38:45.000]  right yeah this guy works for this major foundation we checked it how'd you know
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.960]  that and I said well I know it's not even the police is not even the military I
[38:47.960 --> 38:52.520]  mean when Clinton was in I had to deal with the military messing with me
[38:52.520 --> 38:55.880]  special forces and at a certain point they just said we're not doing this we're
[38:55.880 --> 38:59.840]  not harassing this guy no no we're not surveilling him we're not gonna beat him
[38:59.840 --> 39:03.080]  up and we're not gonna follow him around and we're not gonna threaten him and
[39:03.080 --> 39:07.080]  we're not gonna call him at home we're not gonna do it anymore I haven't been
[39:07.080 --> 39:12.720]  messed with by the military since about 2000 so who they have messing with me is
[39:12.720 --> 39:15.960]  these groups and they're doing it all over the place and people just need to
[39:15.960 --> 39:22.600]  know about it and it's not fun but it's it's it's what I've got to deal with and
[39:22.600 --> 39:27.040]  man that's why I can see the stuff that's going on I could see the stuff out in
[39:27.040 --> 39:30.920]  Oregon I could see when people are being handled I can see just spotted
[39:30.920 --> 39:36.200]  instantly and they've always got homeless mentally ill people that like to
[39:36.200 --> 39:40.240]  dress up in camo and then that and believe they're like a top general and
[39:40.240 --> 39:45.160]  then they'll sit there and then you know be told Alex he's a fed Alex put a
[39:45.160 --> 39:52.720]  chip in you Alex it's just so sad to realize that's who they've got working
[39:52.720 --> 39:58.840]  for them but I'll say it's a lot better than the military messing with you I
[39:58.840 --> 40:01.680]  mean these people are basically like zombies you just have to get out of
[40:01.680 --> 40:05.240]  their way or get around them and they literally just like broken robot just
[40:05.240 --> 40:10.720]  kind of walking the wall they're so stupid it's a wind-up toy
[40:15.120 --> 40:22.240]  and so you know I told folks I said we'll do reports on how they run my
[40:22.240 --> 40:25.920]  Wikipedia and how they edit it and how they run other things and how they run
[40:25.920 --> 40:29.240]  extremist groups we're going to counter them by exposing the sudden
[40:29.240 --> 40:33.160]  poverty law center we're not going to counter them going in and messing with
[40:33.160 --> 40:39.680]  the search results stuff look the listeners they don't want this show
[40:39.680 --> 40:43.200]  going out they don't want our videos and articles going out they're doing
[40:43.200 --> 40:48.160]  everything they can to shut us down to go after our sponsors to harass us to
[40:48.160 --> 40:52.000]  mess with us all we do is get bigger and more successful God just opens more
[40:52.000 --> 40:57.160]  doors Providence just rains on us and so everything's in God's hands but I'm
[40:57.160 --> 41:03.760]  telling you you're in a fight beside us and with us in this when you spread our
[41:03.760 --> 41:09.000]  links and our videos on Craigslist and Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and
[41:09.000 --> 41:15.880]  Pinterest and Instagram and every other system you are toe-to-toe up against the
[41:15.880 --> 41:20.840]  sock puppets the megaphones is what they call them these programs where a
[41:20.840 --> 41:24.520]  person's typing it but they can put in comments and you don't have it published
[41:24.520 --> 41:29.120]  to 50 websites at a time or they can post as 10 different people
[41:29.120 --> 41:34.400]  instantaneously stuff like that and they just spew racism and in fighting and
[41:34.400 --> 41:38.680]  mindlessness from all sides just to get us all fighting with each other and to
[41:38.680 --> 41:44.160]  create a fog of confusion but people are seeing through it and that's the
[41:44.160 --> 41:50.800]  animating contest of liberty and and misrepresenting what I say and all sorts
[41:50.800 --> 41:55.280]  of dirty tricks it just doesn't work anymore
[41:55.480 --> 42:01.000]  because my mission is to expose the globalist operation and to get people
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.840]  talking and thinking about it and being alerted to it my mission is not even to
[42:06.840 --> 42:12.880]  save Alex Jones and the system has figured that out to a certain extent
[42:12.880 --> 42:16.760]  that they can assassinate my character all day they can make up whatever they
[42:16.760 --> 42:22.160]  want they can twist whatever they want the microcosm of what infowars does is
[42:22.160 --> 42:30.560]  a model for everyone else to learn from from our mistakes from our successes
[42:33.760 --> 42:37.600]  it's a very interesting time to be alive
[42:37.600 --> 42:40.680]  oh we got a bunch of guests coming up and he starts getting back into the news
[42:40.680 --> 42:47.360]  it's just that you know when I see national review attack Donald Trump in
[42:47.360 --> 42:51.840]  their entire issue and say he's not qualified he'll be able to run well
[42:51.840 --> 42:55.840]  that no no no anyone that says that they should be able to qualify who can run
[42:55.840 --> 43:00.160]  who can is bad news that's what Obama has been saying and you really listen to
[43:00.160 --> 43:04.120]  the talking points of national review more and more and a lot of these people
[43:04.120 --> 43:11.240]  that signed on to this you understand that it's southern poverty law center
[43:11.240 --> 43:16.680]  garbage everybody's so lazy they just cut and paste if you read their five or
[43:16.680 --> 43:25.040]  six articles attacking yours truly in the last few years it's Alex Jones warns
[43:25.040 --> 43:28.480]  of a world government takeover Alex Jones warns that they're militarizing
[43:28.480 --> 43:33.080]  police and giving him armored vehicles Alex Jones is anti-police southern I'm
[43:33.080 --> 43:37.240]  anti-police that I don't want to run by the globalist given armored vehicles to
[43:37.240 --> 43:40.880]  quote fight the veterans and the constitutionalist and the cops are
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.280]  awake on average and and have listened they didn't have to listen to me they
[43:45.280 --> 43:50.400]  could already see what was going on so in many respects it's game over for the
[43:50.400 --> 43:54.080]  globalist if we just understand how much success we're having how much success
[43:54.080 --> 44:04.000]  you're having but I read these articles and I mean it is just absolutely out of
[44:04.000 --> 44:13.600]  the southern poverty law center it is against Trump the editors oh my gosh
[44:13.600 --> 44:16.800]  they have such authority they tell us how to think they tell us what to do and
[44:16.800 --> 44:19.760]  to be one thing if this group had delivered us out of tyranny before and
[44:19.760 --> 44:24.040]  had stopped the rhinos and stopped the neocons and had been cheerleaders for all
[44:24.040 --> 44:28.120]  the NSA spying and torture and open borders and gun control everything else
[44:28.120 --> 44:32.160]  we've gotten with the republicans of the democrats but this this is the group
[44:32.160 --> 44:36.600]  that never lets us win this is the group that hamstrings us this is the group
[44:36.600 --> 44:42.840]  telling us they control reality and that they are the intellectual high priest
[44:44.240 --> 44:53.200]  when almost everyone of them's a Judas go leading us to the slaughter and
[44:53.200 --> 44:58.520]  speaking of that let's look at a drudge super poll up on info wars calm it's up
[44:58.520 --> 45:02.720]  on drudge report calm obviously and we're gonna do one of our own polls I
[45:02.720 --> 45:07.120]  think we should do one of these some of our polls get about 200,000 voters our
[45:07.120 --> 45:14.000]  biggest ones this one has over a million plus and notice Hillary came in last at
[45:14.000 --> 45:21.720]  0.88 you say oh this is unscientific well it's a total free for all anybody can
[45:21.720 --> 45:25.800]  go in there it's open to the world the left visits drudge as much as
[45:25.800 --> 45:31.800]  conservatives do trump thirty six point zero five notice you'd say oh it's just
[45:31.800 --> 45:36.960]  a conservative poll if next was Cruz and then rubio or Paul no trumps thirty six
[45:36.960 --> 45:41.440]  point zero five say that's four hundred and thirteen thousand plus votes
[45:41.440 --> 45:52.720]  Sanders 29.69 three hundred and forty plus thousand Cruz nineteen point two three two hundred and twenty plus thousand rubio four point nine two fifty six
[45:52.720 --> 45:59.200]  thousand Paul three point two three thirty seven thousand Carson one point four
[45:59.200 --> 46:05.120]  sixteen thousand Kasek one point three fifteen thousand
[46:05.120 --> 46:13.240]  the Packard Bell lady one percent Christie one percent tied Bush zero point nine
[46:13.240 --> 46:16.920]  and Clinton you think the folks are sick of the establishment Bush and Clinton
[46:16.920 --> 46:20.560]  this poll tells you everything we need an article about this drudge poll shows
[46:20.560 --> 46:27.720]  people in populace revolt and then put that interview up with the shadow head
[46:27.720 --> 46:34.840]  of the Trump campaign steel stone Robert Stone a few weeks ago Roger Stone
[46:34.840 --> 46:41.200]  teleprompter free folks and put that up on screen where he says Trump represents
[46:41.200 --> 46:49.760]  a populist uprising that's what Roger Stone talked about so Bush and Clinton
[46:51.600 --> 46:57.360]  Bush and Clinton have less than one percent of the vote combined in national
[46:57.360 --> 47:03.240]  poll establishment Bush and Clinton have less than one percent in a national
[47:03.240 --> 47:08.680]  poll what does that tell you ladies and gentlemen and by the way Bush is polling
[47:08.680 --> 47:14.720]  in national polls between two and seven percent and in different polls in
[47:14.720 --> 47:18.400]  different states three to eight percent
[47:18.400 --> 47:33.920]  so you think about that Santorum is zero point two percent think about that
[47:33.920 --> 47:38.560]  think about that long and hard and that's what we're seeing from the public
[47:38.560 --> 47:47.640]  so what does national review do they go and they sign on against Trump claiming
[47:47.640 --> 47:54.600]  they don't trust him well we know what we're gonna get with Hillary Clinton we
[47:54.600 --> 48:02.960]  know what we're going to get with George Herbert Walker Bush's son the
[48:02.960 --> 48:05.200]  re-tread
[48:06.600 --> 48:14.800]  jeb Bush more of the same so I'm done talking about that for now but it is
[48:14.800 --> 48:19.840]  truly disgusting to see this and that's why the RNC has disinvited national
[48:19.840 --> 48:29.880]  review as a debate partner from the next Republican sponsored debate they said
[48:29.880 --> 48:35.040]  we expect this was coming small price to pay for speaking the truth to the
[48:35.040 --> 48:41.560]  Donald Jack Fowler published a national review out why the RNC's rationale and a
[48:41.560 --> 48:45.400]  piece published on the magazine's website
[48:48.280 --> 48:52.920]  and if they had their way we would have jeb Bush or we would have case it or
[48:52.920 --> 48:56.520]  something like that I mean give me a break more of the same we're gonna go to
[48:56.520 --> 49:00.920]  break come back on snowmageddon now heading they're saying shelter in place
[49:00.920 --> 49:04.760]  we're gonna get into the latest article on infowars.com and video Davos

[49:17.640 --> 49:22.280]  sentenced for raping women shooting people in the back so all I'm seeing
[49:22.280 --> 49:26.320]  convictions constantly a bad cops that's a good thing the police are
[49:26.320 --> 49:30.520]  cleaning house in many areas and they need to because if you don't you will
[49:30.520 --> 49:33.640]  let the globalist basically take over the local governments and enslave
[49:33.640 --> 49:37.720]  everybody the most patriotic thing the police can do is resist the globalist
[49:37.720 --> 49:42.760]  takeover politically and resist the urge to act like thugs as the feds have
[49:42.760 --> 49:47.280]  trained you to do before we go to break ladies and gentlemen I want to thank you

[54:31.280 --> 54:36.000]  they discovered it ten times bigger than Earth the size of Neptune a gas giant
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.960]  with a 20,000 year orbit exactly what a bunch of the ancients said they said it
[54:40.960 --> 54:45.280]  when it comes back through it causes massive catastrophes volcanoes you name
[54:45.280 --> 54:48.760]  it by the way gave me a whole stack of articles about record volcanoes I laid
[54:48.760 --> 54:54.040]  it somewhere I think I'm there by the coffee pot but I'm gonna have to actually
[54:54.040 --> 54:59.720]  get to that halfway into the hour with Michael Schneider from the economic
[54:59.720 --> 55:03.880]  collapse blog and get his take on it and here's the deal folks I don't want to
[55:03.880 --> 55:10.280]  say I'm eating my hat on this but I've been very very critical of the perennial
[55:10.280 --> 55:14.400]  books that have been coming out since the mid 90s about planet X is coming it's a
[55:14.400 --> 55:20.960]  gas giant 20,000 year elliptical orbit you know the Babylonians talked about it
[55:20.960 --> 55:29.520]  the zoalastures the Mayans I never said that I didn't think that there aren't a
[55:29.520 --> 55:32.720]  whole bunch of planets out there they've proven there's hundreds of them that
[55:32.720 --> 55:36.440]  are out in the Kuiper belt past Pluto that's why they delisted it as I said
[55:36.440 --> 55:41.160]  earlier what I was getting at is constantly saying it's coming next
[55:41.160 --> 55:45.680]  year and constantly saying it's the end of the world and the movie 2012 and then
[55:45.680 --> 55:50.400]  I get blamed for it they would come into so many news articles going Alex Jones
[55:50.400 --> 55:54.280]  is the one so we didn't go to the moon and then aliens run everything and that
[55:54.280 --> 56:00.440]  the Himalayas are gonna be you know at sea level well hey Alex 2012 didn't kill
[56:00.440 --> 56:08.080]  everybody and so it just gets old but it does show how the ancients were
[56:08.080 --> 56:11.520]  certainly right about big planets that come through and there are big
[56:11.520 --> 56:14.520]  disasters and there are big asteroids that hit the earth and there are big
[56:14.520 --> 56:19.440]  earth changes and the elite shouldn't be the focus of everything they're all
[56:19.440 --> 56:24.160]  busy I saw another headline last week going Alex Jones says the elite want
[56:24.160 --> 56:31.320]  off-world colonies to escape earth I was quoting top elitist on their way to
[56:31.320 --> 56:35.800]  Davos saying that was gonna be up for discussion it was mainstream news so
[56:35.800 --> 56:40.000]  even when there's mainstream news that you know feel and all these other folks
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.200]  and and you know the Tesla owner and all the rest of it are saying we need a
[56:45.200 --> 56:49.880]  Mars colony for the elite I cover what they say and then they go Alex is crazy
[56:49.880 --> 56:55.280]  and made this up so see that's how they operate they think you're stupid but I
[56:55.280 --> 56:59.960]  tell you uncanny that the ancients said 20,000 years bigger than the earth and
[56:59.960 --> 57:04.080]  all the rest of it and here it is the question is we're trying to look at its
[57:04.080 --> 57:08.000]  orbit I mean is it even scheduled I guess it's coming in closer that's what
[57:08.000 --> 57:11.760]  they're saying that's how they're able to to see it now it's coming in from this
[57:11.760 --> 57:20.120]  orbit what is it they're saying many many many times to further out from Pluto
[57:20.120 --> 57:24.720]  I'm gonna go over that coming up at the bottom of the next hour and then here are
[57:24.720 --> 57:27.960]  those articles mass evacuation alert one of the world's most dangerous
[57:27.960 --> 57:33.200]  volcanoes threatens to blow we're getting to that Mexico City Mexico City
[57:33.200 --> 57:37.320]  course has 40 million people under something monster eruptions panic as
[57:37.320 --> 57:43.520]  few volcanoes explode causing mass evacuation that's in Indonesia pretty
[57:43.520 --> 57:47.080]  similar with article going Jones claims there's something called volcanoes that
[57:47.080 --> 58:01.600]  shoot lava and ash and he claims Obamacare isn't free and
[58:01.600 --> 58:05.880]  Hillary claims she didn't have any emails that were secret oh that's another
[58:05.880 --> 58:10.000]  lie and El Chapo's got a 50 cal the government gave him to blame the Second
[58:10.000 --> 58:15.480]  Amendment but that's okay everything's fine did you take your vaccines today
[58:15.480 --> 58:19.200]  did you drink your fluorine because the government loves you and cares about you

[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:39.840]  from me the infight is ours
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:45.840]  the technocrats want to keep that fire to themselves and build a stairway to
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:56.200]  heaven while damning us to this planet and the wreckage from the wars and the
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:07.600]  sins and the waste they will never transcend their evil they will never
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:17.520]  rise above their nature and in their attempt to bring down humanity they
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:25.280]  will only serve their purpose to make the righteous strong I don't claim to be
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:35.200]  righteous I don't claim to be the good man I don't claim to be pure as the
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:43.520]  driven snow but I do have my heart pointed towards justice and God and I
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:50.720]  don't want to see my fellow humans fallen and it takes all kinds to fight
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.600]  this war so stop thinking you've got to be the most well-spoken the best looking

[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:06.760]  that people spend money on and time and energy I see the same syndrome and then
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:10.760]  it doesn't bear fruit because all you do is keep planning and keep scheming and
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.960]  keep thinking about how you're gonna write a book or how you're gonna do a
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.080]  newsletter how you're gonna do a local radio show or how you're gonna run for
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:20.680]  office or how you're gonna start speaking out you want to do something
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:25.240]  start speaking out at the grocery store line just say man I sure wish my kids
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:30.280]  could have some of this gum they're asking it right now they don't do that
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.120]  anymore because they know I'll they'll get a speech oh we're in the grocery
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.840]  store line we're in the target line we're in the gas station line and there's
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.680]  seven people in line in front of us my kids start saying can we have some of
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.760]  this bubble gum and I'll say went back there four or five I'd say read on the

[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.520]  hour and then want more and the stuff that's in fast food the toxins the things
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:18.880]  they put in their own purpose to make you feel sick an hour later and be hungry

[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:03.400]  presidential candidate Hillary Clinton denied reports that her private email
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:08.200]  server had been hacked after being confronted by an info wars correspondent
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:14.040]  at a campaign stop in Iowa last week it was reported on info wars dot com that

[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:22.120]  server can you comment on that yeah it's totally untrue the question stems from
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.680]  an exclusive info wars interview earlier this month in which former secret
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:32.080]  service agent Dan Bongino reported that Hillary continued using her private
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:37.320]  email to discuss classified information while knowing that her server had been
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:41.640]  compromised the Clintons knew it was hacked and she did it anyway and not
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:46.520]  only is she not currently indicted or in prison she's running to be president

[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:21.520]  jones and the gcn radio network well in this hour we're going to cover the
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:27.880]  unsustainability of global civilization by design everybody here is constantly
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:31.280]  from mainstream controlled media that we're unsustainable humans are ugly
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:34.440]  humans are bad humans can't innovate you can't have air conditioning you can't
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:38.560]  have cars everybody's gonna die we'd be better off without humans you know I
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.040]  saw that in the white papers government documents 25 years ago 20 years ago on
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:46.600]  air covering now it's just been mainstream as they create artificial
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:51.280]  derivatives as they give themselves trillions of dollars and then give us
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:55.320]  the debt as they do everything they can to shut down industries and companies
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:59.800]  and new clean burning systems by controlling the whole green movement
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:04.040]  they make sure that we only get boondoggles it is a post-industrial world
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:09.240]  where the elite transfer the technologies the power the systems to themselves and
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:17.560]  don't transfer the innovations to the people now I know for a fact that major
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:25.360]  world leaders listen to this show and major folks that affect policy and have
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.640]  major pull in the media like Matt drudge listens every day and loose
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:34.200]  fair con every day I'm not comparing those two but just look at how divergent
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:41.240]  at some points they are but also how close by the mere Putin listens many
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:46.120]  years ago we've had former heads of the Pakistan and secret intelligence
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.640]  operatives general Hamed ghoul and the head of the German CIA and you know the
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.080]  number two in the Japanese government comes on the point is we've hit the
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:10:02.760]  zeitgeist talking to very high-powered people and right wing watch put it out
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:07.200]  last week the reason I mentioned this is to show you how they're disinfo
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.480]  operatives and then they got picked up by a bunch of magazines and newspapers
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:17.160]  quote my critics just want to spot in the global elites off-world colonies now
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:23.080]  that's actually two quotes in a long breakdown to make it sound insane but
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:27.160]  what I was quoting was Elon Musk in the news saying we need a Mars colony for
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:31.720]  the elite to escape to we need ring cities that are based on Werner von
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.040]  Braun designs and others which have gravity which is what you see in the
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:41.040]  movie Elysium that's a real design there's the elite daily a ticket to Elon
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:49.960]  Musk calling on Mars cost 500k so see what happens is I cover news I cover
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:55.680]  CNN 9th planet found is it planet X the rumored 10th planet 10 times bigger than
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:00.200]  Earth they'll probably have articles saying Alex Jones says you know the
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.920]  space aliens are coming to get his point you know Planet 10 same deal where they
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.120]  say that I say that there's Martians under the UN building I never said that
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:14.480]  I don't cover space aliens so see this is how they engage in this info and I
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:18.000]  know everybody understands this but you really need to really get the word out
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.680]  about how shameful these people are and how they're preying on their audiences
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:28.280]  but just during the break Tim Fruge said oh I remember seeing Steven Hawking just
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:34.240]  say this yesterday Steven Hawking I didn't see this humanity is going to use
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:39.920]  science and technology to wipe itself out professor warns says global elite are
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:47.000]  destroying the planet and plan to escape it nuclear war global warming and
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.600]  engineered viruses all pose a threat but we might be able to save humanity if we
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:56.240]  escape Earth in time and then he goes on to talk about everything we talk about
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:59.280]  here's another one Steven Hawking warns humanity leave Earth before the ruling
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:07.760]  class destroys it I mean they'll probably come out and again misrepresent this
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.120]  they don't want to have a debate about what's going on it and to get where I
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:15.920]  was going and then go to our guest setting this up this is what the elite
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.120]  are talking about this is what they've been talking about for 50 years it's the
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:25.280]  plan to control the future we are not in that future plan the economic
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:29.240]  collapse you're seeing be engineered is to get us under their full economic
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:34.000]  political and military control to dictate to us like Native Americans on a
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.560]  reservation to a company store with disease blankets and beef full of maggots
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:47.160]  that's the system they get the tax money to then administer us on the
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:54.200]  plantation us on the reservation neo feudalism in their own words I coined
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:13:00.520]  the term neo feudalistic fascism 17 18 years ago it is now used in universities
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:07.760]  by them to describe what they are building what's crazy is we put names of
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:11.520]  their tyranny they even adopt it at Davos two years ago they said we're
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:15.480]  technocrats we are bringing in tyranny they have the financial times of London's
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:20.760]  editor come out and say and now for world government and say we are tyrannical
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:26.960]  we are taking over we know best then they have the Southern Poverty Law Center
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:30.040]  in ADL and all their groups that they put the talking points out for White
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:34.200]  House run media matters CNN come out and say there is no world government now
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:38.360]  Jones is deeply racist with no proof and I'm not talking about myself here all
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:42.480]  day but I never meant to be gone so journalism but we are because if they
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:46.760]  can shoot down Matt Drudge Alex Jones Rush Limbaugh and a few others they can
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:49.360]  take everybody else down and I don't agree with some of the things what Rush
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.680]  Limbaugh says he's more of a kind of establishment Republican or at least
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.280]  has been but now he sounds more like I do because his audience has taken him
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:59.960]  there or maybe he's grown the point is they want to shut him down they want to
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:03.800]  boycott him they want to arrest him they want to set him up they follow him
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:08.280]  around they harass him on record because if they can bring down that big lead
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:13.360]  elephant they can bring down all the rest and now I am a lead elephant and
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.240]  let me tell you it is very invigorating at certain points but not at others but
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:21.880]  let me tell you it'll get your head screwed on really straight when you
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:28.320]  realize how hardcore all this is but all hell is breaking loose banking cartel
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:34.680]  JPMorgan CEO gets 35% pay raise to 27 million amid cutbacks Davos insider
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:40.680]  world economy doomed central banks out of ammo that's up on info wars.com
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:46.480]  meanwhile I think Hollywood we know they're involved in psychological warfare
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:52.440]  24-7 but I think they're not nominating any black directors or actors because
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.760]  there are people that deserve it undoubtedly something's going on here
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:02.600]  they're not nominating it on purpose to create again more of the racial divide
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.800]  in this country that's all they do 24-7 that's their job Oscar winner producer
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:12.960]  denounces spoiled brats crying racism and it is a bunch of spoiled brats go do
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:17.720]  your own thing I mean you know what leave Hollywood I've done that I never
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:25.480]  went to Hollywood and now because we didn't let them dictate the culture to us
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:30.920]  we dictate the culture to them and I'm not going to go into a long example of
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:37.280]  that there's plenty of them going to Michael Schneider I really appreciate
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:40.680]  his work we post his articles almost every day at info wars.com the
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.600]  economic collapse blog.com Michael Schneider is the creator of the side he
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:49.120]  just does a great job doing the research linking to all the facts he believes
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:53.120]  the coming economic collapse is going to unfold over the next few years he also
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:59.160]  writes for the end of the American dream.com and the truth wins.com and we're
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:02.360]  just gonna go ahead and go to him right now to break all this down he's the
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:06.240]  author of two books the beginning of the end and get prepared now available at
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:10.360]  Amazon and paperback at Kindle thank you for joining us that's a little six
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:15.220]  seven-minute intro with some of the craziness going on here Russian
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:19.080]  intelligence chiefs getting killed I mean everything's really heating up
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:23.480]  right now do you think this is the big economic collapse or will it be as big
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:27.640]  as 2008 where they consolidate more power get banker bailouts or is it going
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:33.040]  to be the big kahuna Mr. Schneider. Well Alex thank you for having me on and I
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.880]  do believe that we're that's exactly what we're heading for we're progressing
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:41.600]  for right now in fact it started right in the middle of last year in June 2015
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:47.360]  since that time more than 15 trillion dollars has been wiped out from stock
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:51.200]  markets all around the world and so we've seen this massive amount of money
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:55.400]  lost in fact just on Wednesday we learned they told us CNBC all the big
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:01.120]  mainstream news networks they told us global stocks enter bear market for the
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.280]  first time in ages and what that means is that global stocks are roughly down
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:11.960]  about 20% so roughly approximately a fifth of all stock market wealth in the
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.720]  world has been totally wiped out so this has been going on for a number of
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:19.120]  months but now since the beginning of the year you know we've seen an
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:23.160]  acceleration with the emergency shutdowns of the Chinese markets the US
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:27.120]  markets have started to tumble taken a tremendous tumble in fact through
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:31.520]  Wednesday it was the worst start for the Dow Jones industrial average that we've
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:35.600]  ever seen in all of history so it's starting to get the attention of the
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.640]  American people of the mainstream media although they're still telling people
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:42.840]  don't panic everything's gonna be okay but what we're seeing it's not you know
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.920]  a lot of times people are looking for a day a week a month you know we're not
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:50.760]  looking for a single event but it's a progression which is eventually going to
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:56.040]  lead us into a crisis like we saw in 2008 and eventually lead us beyond that I
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:00.400]  believe into an even far greater crisis in fact in many areas around the world
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.480]  that's already a reality well that's right and then you've got people with
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:10.120]  most the world in a depression or a recession civil wars or proxy wars in
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:14.880]  more than 30 countries doubling of starvation per year just in the last
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:20.120]  few years the world is melting down the Pentagon says that you write about it
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.240]  but then they have the New York Times and others come out and attack myself
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.480]  Gerald Salienti and countless others saying we're porn dealers no we're
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:32.520]  pointing out that they've engineered the system that's now collapsing to
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:38.200]  consolidate control we've been proven right and but but isolated insulated
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:44.080]  yuppies living I guess off pension funds or living off trust funds for mommy and
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:47.720]  daddy I guess they still think it's all funny but what are they gonna do when
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:54.280]  those trust funds based on you know the stock market based on 401ks based on
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:57.960]  mutual funds go in the toilet what are they going to do because in the
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:01.760]  depression people at least knew how to skin a buck around a trot line these
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:08.400]  yuppies don't know how to wipe their fat asses excuse me I apologize oh you're
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:13.200]  absolutely correct Alex in fact just a couple weeks ago drudge report came out
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.880]  with new number you know before it was just 62 percent of all Americans were
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:21.120]  living to paycheck to paycheck now it's 63 percent of all Americans are living
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:25.160]  paycheck to paycheck so that we're seeing the middle class hurting middle
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:28.520]  class declining effect for the first time ever we learned just at the end of
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:32.680]  the last year the middle class in the United States is now a minority we're
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:37.600]  down to 49% you know you take the wealthy and the poor together they outnumber the
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.960]  middle class for the first time ever back in the 1970s more than 60% absolutely
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.040]  let's go to those numbers when we come back with Michael Schneider and think
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:49.040]  about this World Bank of Scotland two weeks ago did the equivalent of running

[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:15.560]  it seemed like yesterday but it was long ago all those drifters years are
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:21.680]  behind me now all those drifters days are past me you got so much more to think
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:32.480]  about. World government collapse, terror cells, conscription, forced in
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:38.480]  occulations, gender reassignment in first grade worldwide. The school tells you
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:45.680]  what you're gonna be basically in the name of letting you be free. Well it's
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.080]  the establishment running against the wind of history and no amount of
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:54.200]  technological time prediction systems and algorithms will be able to save them
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:25:00.040]  not once the rising giant that is the human spirit begins to fight back which
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:04.520]  is starting now. Michael Schneider of the economic collapse blog is with us
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.520]  this is a short segment long segment coming up and I should have made a
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:12.360]  bigger deal out of this it is a huge big deal breaking Hilary Deny's email hack
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:16.720]  which we've had secret service agents on and others about she denied that she'd
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:21.440]  been hacked she denied that she had classified emails then she said she'd
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:26.240]  given them all over them then there were more now there's above top secret above
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:31.760]  top secret boy you don't hear about that that's that's ultra was the old
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:37.560]  classification for that and then there's stuff so secret doesn't even have a
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.680]  classification and it's only in those little National Security Council
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:48.320]  star chambers I want to get his take on this then get back into what's
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.320]  happening worldwide what are people gonna do as things collapse well they're
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:55.000]  gonna listen to the media and the government and the government's gonna
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.160]  make sure they get enslaved further and that's the big challenge now is how do
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.560]  we stop them from doing that we'll first get more into the collapse itself but
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:06.320]  next segment I'm gonna play the video of Richard Reeves yesterday Hilary denies
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.000]  the email hack and boy she looks like when she hears info wars she turns around
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.480]  and looks at him I mean like she has come face to face with the enemy incarnate
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:21.800]  which I see is a red badge of courage going back to mr. Schneider you were
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:26.720]  getting into the economic numbers of the demographics around the world what are
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:34.320]  the yuppies and the trend he's gonna do when the system betrays them yet again
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:39.280]  you expect them to keep doubling down for Bernie Sanders in class warfare what
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:43.120]  do you expect to come out of this politically currently well I expect
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:46.480]  to sit for a great political shaking I believe we're gonna see things in the
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:50.200]  political realm we've never seen before because when people what they they
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:54.400]  depend on this debt fueled of prosperity that we've all been enjoying when
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:57.840]  that's taken away people are gonna be shaken and people are gonna be angry
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.200]  already we see levels of anger and frustration across this country at
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:04.960]  unprecedented levels and people are gonna be upset they're gonna demand answers
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:08.280]  they're gonna demand solutions and they're gonna look for to the government
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:11.560]  to be their savior because they expect whatever happens especially among the
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:15.000]  liberals they expect the government to come in and fix it but there's not
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.600]  gonna be a problem this year in fact that the elite are already admitting that
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.760]  the central banks have used up all their ammunition they've already pushed
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.360]  interest rates to the floor they print printing money wildly around the world
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:29.720]  the last few years so they've used up all their ammunition and yet now another
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:33.920]  crisis is here a worse crisis is here is and when we come back after the break
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:37.800]  we could talk about all the numbers all the patterns that we saw just prior to
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:41.240]  the last financial crisis they're happening again and we've got some time
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:45.000]  let's let's start walking through those numbers right now but of course the
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.440]  establishment will be happy to give themselves 100 trillion of new carbon
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:54.960]  tax money as Davos is calling for over the next decade to save us though oh
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:00.320]  absolutely absolutely and yet the the foundations the fundamentals are falling
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:03.840]  apart all around us just look at global trade there's a wonderful report up on
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:07.960]  info wars.com just this morning about how global trade is collapsing the
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:13.220]  Baltic dry index it collapsed before the stock market crash of 1987 before the
[01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:17.160]  dot-com bubble burst around the turn of the century it collapsed before the
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:22.760]  2008 crash and now the Baltic dry index just this week has fallen to the lowest
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:28.160]  level ever we've never seen it at this level before and and so global trade is
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:33.200]  imploding if like Bloomberg is reporting that is now more is cheaper to rent a
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:39.040]  1000-foot merchant vessel than it is to rent a Ferrari that's how much global
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.880]  trade is collapsing. Look at the Baltic dry index as you know the lowest ever
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:47.360]  recorded in shipping I mean it's a cardiac arrest it's much worse than
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.360]  they're even saying when the Royal Bank of Scotland two weeks ago said sell
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:55.520]  everything emergency to its its members what do you I mean how bad do you think
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:01.280]  it's gonna get if trade and and rail line commerce is at a record low I mean
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:07.560]  that is a bad indicator. Yeah Chinese exports are way down US exports are
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:11.360]  way down but kind of a canary in the coal mine that some of the experts really
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.400]  look at and have looked at for years to say what's really going on with global
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:19.000]  trade is South Korean exports and in December South Korean exports were down
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.440]  13.8 percent year over year so that's another huge red flag global trade is
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:29.040]  literally imploding in Europe and Asia North America all over and what this
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:33.680]  means is real economic activity is dramatically slowing down so what's
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:36.800]  happening with the financial markets right now they're just starting to catch
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:40.000]  up with economically. Well I'll tell you the answer it's let's raise taxes on the
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.720]  middle class and give the money to welfare recipients to buy lottery
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:48.320]  tickets that will get us to Mars that will take us to the next level. We're on
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:56.360]  the March the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:30:01.960]  The Democratic Party establishment that wants to install Hillary into the
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:06.280]  White House in this next election season is currently in free fall. The plan for
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:10.240]  potential first husband Bill Clinton has failed miserably as women have crawled
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:14.200]  out of the woodwork to describe his detailed history of sexual abuse. She
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:18.280]  also has the looming email scandal which doesn't seem to go away no matter how
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:21.840]  many jokes she throws at it. The latest news comes out of Beaumont where only
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:25.640]  six people were at the airport to greet the former first lady KDFM reported
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:29.400]  that she didn't say hello or visit any of those six people she does drove away
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:33.560]  and where was she going? Oh to a private fundraiser held by Pakistani businessman
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:38.720]  Tahir Javid to collect $500,000. The news reported it as a private meeting. Back
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:42.760]  in 2008 she attended another private meeting with Barack Obama. This occurred
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:46.640]  of course in Chantilly, Virginia during the Bilderberg meeting. In fact her
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:50.520]  campaign has become so desperate she's now labeling Bernie Sanders as a white
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:54.800]  elitist. Read the article at Infowars.com. Bernie Sanders very white.

[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:39.360]  comments I mean how bad do you think this economic crisis is going to be can
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:46.520]  we educate folks that crony capitalism and fascism wearing a socialist mask
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:50.320]  you never really even have socialism it's always big crony groups managing
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:54.400]  socialism it's fascism socialism and communism never really exist in my view
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:58.440]  I've studied all these systems I mean it's just it's a bunch of offshore people
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:02.400]  above the law getting everybody dependent and administering it all like a
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:06.760]  like a indian reservation folks everybody knows those are screw jobs is
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:12.760]  that socialism no it's fascism are the democrats liberals no they're out of
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:16.240]  control fascist and so are the republican leaders and I'm sick of them
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:23.880]  Bernie Sanders is a disgusting maggot playing class envy all day where is he
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:27.840]  against Walmart for the slave labor for the internal tariffs and all the NAFTA
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:34.360]  and Gatton things that did us down to this level he's not there it's just class
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:37.840]  envy class envy all the Walmart families worth hundreds of billions get
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:42.000]  their money get their money you could take their 180 billion that the family's
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:50.560]  got all seven of the siblings and you could spend it just a few months in the
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:55.560]  country just in the government it all be gone you could take all of the quote
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:36:00.800]  elites real money and it wouldn't pay for the country to run for a year and
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:05.200]  they've signed us on to thousands of trillions of made-up black hole money
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:09.520]  and people go that's stupid why'd they do that because it's designed to be
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:15.840]  undefeatable if you sign on to it they trick you to too big to fail you sign
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:20.080]  on to it to prop everything up and it doesn't prop up it just collapses into
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:24.320]  a new phase they get more consolidation of power they pump it back up it
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.200]  collapses again but overall you're going downhill we'll talk to our guests in a
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:35.560]  moment about that but first let's go to this clip of Hillary Clinton last night
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:39.760]  with Richard Reeves with her on the campaign trail in Texas they'll be on
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:43.560]  with us for about 15 minutes the start of the next hour bringing up the fact
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:47.320]  that experts are saying that her email has been hacked the former Secretary
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:50.800]  of Defense is saying undoubtedly that happened but she just says no it hasn't
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:56.240]  happened another ball face lie here it is last week it was reported on info
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:00.480]  wars.com that your email server was hacked and you knowingly continued to use
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:06.880]  your email server can you comment on that yeah it's totally untrue and she
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:13.680]  keeps saying there were no extra emails she keeps saying that none of it was
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:19.920]  classified now it's proven it was I mean this is amazing this is amazing she
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:23.080]  thinks people are so stupid and you know what her constituents they're not
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:31.360]  stupid they're delusional. In fact can we get the clip and make an intro of like
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:35.560]  different cultists in different movies like Jim Jones a real one or Tulsa Doom
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:39.640]  a fake one and put clips of Democrat supporters and Obama making crazy

[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:29.000]  planetary plan that the credibility of everyone opposing it especially those
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.360]  that have been around for a long time is exploding the listenership the viewership
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:36.800]  the readership I don't know I haven't asked Schneider but I bet people visiting
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:42.560]  his sites exploded because and we're asking right now we're riding a rocket
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:48.360]  folks the globalists want to take us on an express elevator to hell we want to
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:52.000]  go on express elevator to a free market heaven and believe me free markets
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.280]  create incredible wealth incredible innovation they also then create
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:59.480]  incredible decadence and spoil rotten children if we're gonna have a free
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:02.520]  market we've got to have children that aren't decadent that are made to work
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:06.200]  that aren't giving everything or we turn into what we've got here a bunch of
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:10.400]  stupid arrogant chumps not everybody but a large portion let's admit it we are
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:15.360]  exceptionally stupid exceptionally fat exceptionally dumb exceptionally mindless
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:19.360]  exceptionally sick we are a mentally ill sick society I mean my god they eat
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:23.360]  hospitals with dead babies we're growing humanoids inside cows to harvest
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:27.160]  their organs MIT I mean it's all happening just admit we're screwed and
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:31.720]  then let's get out of it okay going back to Michael Schneider Michael thank you
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:35.040]  for joining us while I went over those lance there I want to get into some
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:38.120]  other issues of science with you as well but you've got the floor for about ten
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:40.960]  minutes or so here we got a break and then we're gonna take some calls for two
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.520]  little segments with you but let's go ahead eight hundred two five nine nine
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:48.720]  two three one we're gonna go ahead and launch that phone system eight hundred two
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:52.680]  five nine nine two three one you've got the floor break down from your deep
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:56.240]  research exactly where we are how bad the collapse is gonna be and what we've
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:59.520]  got to watch for we know they're announcing world government planetary
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:03.960]  SDR currency that's digital the dum-dums will say where's the new currency we're
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:08.680]  supposed to get your dollar will now be based in it what do we do to stop this
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:15.600]  well Alex what we're looking for is patterns and for example before the in
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:18.600]  the last thing that we talked about the Baltic dry index and how it crashed
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:23.160]  before previous crashes another thing though well for your watchers and
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:29.440]  viewers to look for is junk bonds junk bonds crashed hard if you look at a chart
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:34.480]  of junk bonds they crashed hard before the crash of 2008 that was before stocks
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:39.200]  did because when a financial crisis is coming you would expect the trouble to
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:43.040]  show up in firms that are more leveraged that are riskier that are more
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:46.520]  vulnerable and that's exactly what we saw in 2008 that's exactly what we're
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:51.560]  seeing right now so the last recession ended and there's a ETF that I watch
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:56.560]  very very closely it's known as JNK and after the last recession well it
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:00.240]  crashed hard before the stock market crashed and it rebounded and ever since
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:05.200]  that time it's traded in a range of about 36 to 42 and I knew that it if ever
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:10.480]  dropped below 35 that would be confirmation that a new financial crisis
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.720]  had begun and it never did all those years that I've been writing until
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:20.480]  December in December this past December finally crossed below 35 it went below
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:24.920]  34 then now it's gone below 33 and briefly this week during the panic a
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:29.680]  drop below 32 but junk bonds are crashing right now just as we would
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:34.280]  expect before a major stock market crash here in the US and around the world so
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:38.440]  that's a huge warning sign another huge warning sign is the price of oil you
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:42.480]  know we've seen the price of oil crash just like we did in 2008 if people
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:46.520]  remember it shot up to about $140 a barrel then crashed really hard to
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:51.320]  below $40 a barrel for a short period of time and that was before the great
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:55.920]  stock market of crash of 2008 now it's happening again over the last 18 months
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:00.480]  we've seen the price of oil go from $108 a barrel all the way this week it
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:05.120]  dipped well below $30 a barrel this is the only other time in all of history
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:08.960]  other than 2008 when we've seen this happen now a lot of people may think
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:12.440]  well the price of oil is good I can go to the store I can fill up my tank really
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:16.960]  cheaply less than $2 a gallon this is good for me well it's really bad for the
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:21.920]  US economy and the global economy yeah in fact just since the start of 2015 we've
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:29.640]  seen 42 North American energy companies go bankrupt we've seen more than 130,000
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:33.640]  good-paying energy jobs lost and that's really bad news because the energy
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:37.640]  industry was the primary engine for the growth of good-paying jobs she's
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:41.080]  plunging now that's completely reversing so we're seeing an
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:45.560]  implosion of these jobs and you know this is putting a tremendous amount of
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:49.760]  stress on the financial sector because a lot of these fracking companies the oil
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:53.840]  companies energy companies they wanted to drill drill drill so they went out and
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:58.000]  got all kinds of loans from the big banks financial institutions now those
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.640]  loans are going bad and so these big banks you know in fact just this week we
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:05.640]  saw some of the biggest banks in the United States come out and say yeah we're
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:08.880]  starting to set more money aside to cover these bad loans because the energy
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:13.280]  sector is in a massive amount of trouble another thing we saw just before the
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:17.160]  last financial crisis was a crash in the price of industrial commodities I'm
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:22.280]  talking about tin iron ore lead aluminum copper especially if you look at a chart
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:27.920]  of copper in 2008 crashed hard before stocks did and then it's happening again
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:33.520]  it toward the second half of last year I was warning my readers about this and
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:38.600]  all these other patterns that we saw that are happening again because these
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:42.120]  are huge red flags there's so many of them Alex right now in fact if I was
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:45.360]  gonna make up a textbook scenario for what a financial crisis would look like
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:50.280]  all the boxes are ticked all the technical indicators are there another
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:54.480]  one is the surging US dollar you know a lot of people who come on and they talk
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:57.720]  about the coming economic collapse they talk about the death of the dollar and
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:01.120]  that's coming but we're not there yet but what we've seen in recent months is
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:05.000]  the US dollar absolutely sir everyone rushes out of the other smaller
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.640]  smaller ships because what happens is during the boom years all these
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:12.360]  emerging markets like Brazil and all around the world they went into a
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:16.000]  tremendous amounts of debt they took out all these loans denominated in US
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.960]  dollars well now US dollar is surged so it's taking much much more of their own
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:25.600]  local currencies to pay back and service these debts meanwhile the things they
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:30.240]  export oil commodities other things have gone way down so this double whammy is
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:35.200]  just killing these emerging markets so the exact same conditions that created
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:39.680]  the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s the Asian financial crisis of the
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:45.120]  1990s and that we saw just before the great crash of 2008 it's killing
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:48.440]  emerging markets all around the world for example down in Brazil the seventh
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:52.640]  largest economy on the entire planet planet Goldman Sachs says that they're
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:57.280]  not just in a recession Goldman Sachs says they're in an outright depression
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:04.320]  Alex that's right my friend and the allegory or the analogy for this is
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:08.520]  you got a bunch of ships they're on fire they're sinking there's a bigger ship
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:12.800]  the biggest ship it's got problems it's got some fires on board but it's seen as
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:16.680]  the safest so everybody starts crawling out of those other sinking ships and
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:19.880]  going into the dollar going into the bonds going into the national
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:24.080]  treasuries and so it's the last to sink and blow up but will be the most
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:28.520]  spectacular many analysts believe but China with one billion three hundred
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:32.760]  million people most of them forced off rural land basically into slave
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:37.600]  factories it is a time bomb Latin America's a time bomb Africa's a time
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:42.480]  bomb the Middle East is a collapsing time bomb and the global elites admit
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:47.320]  they're going into all these revolutions and all these places where 50% of the
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:51.880]  metric of their of their paychecks is now going to food you pass that metric
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:56.880]  historically you get revolution you get rioting the elite are purposely turning
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:00.800]  off the food then they're going to open the borders flood us with massive third
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.560]  world use that crisis to set up a police state create a welfare state for
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:10.720]  those people weaponize them I mean what's crazy is you can see the engineers
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:17.560]  of this who are meeting at Davos the George Soros is actually captaining it
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:22.560]  and bragging I mean Hillary said State Department said a great job in Syria she
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:25.960]  said we've done a great job in Libya great job in Syria just this last month
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:30.760]  in December they are they're telling you this is what I meant to do they meant
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:34.760]  to wreck the world they meant to turn radical jihadis lose they mean to bring
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:39.120]  them in they mean to let them attack and then take our right so the more attacks
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:43.160]  their answer is take our guns a jihadi shot a cop in Philadelphia I mean you
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:47.440]  can see it but it really is the ignorance of the public that has allowed
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:51.760]  this to happen what's going to happen though when the welfare checks still go
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:57.320]  out when the ebt card still work but they don't buy what they did before or the
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:00.840]  foods not on the shelves like we're already seeing in the shopping for
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:06.840]  snowmageddon I mean with with with this ignorant domesticated population the
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:11.160]  Pentagon estimates as you know that within about seven to eight days most
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:16.200]  people will steal within about 11 days most people will kill 90 plus percent of
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:20.200]  people it's about 98 some of the studies will begin within 15 days going to
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:26.380]  cannibalism now imagine imagine the scenario in a real collapse when the
[01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:31.640]  Pentagon admits that a Carrington event from the sun that blew out a lot of our
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:35.520]  electronics and power that 90% of the America would be dead within two years
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:39.400]  and I'm not saying that's going to happen that's on the bad end is a Vigo
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:44.800]  Mortensen a road scenario versus what we see Venezuela and you know just
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:49.800]  squalor rioting death murder crime rates up 3,000 percent 4,000 percent I mean
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:55.320]  anyway you slice this we're headed into crazy town oh we absolutely are just
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:58.480]  look at the snowmageddon you know two or three days in advance people are
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:02.400]  pulling all the milk all the bread off the shelves you know just over a snow
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:06.400]  storm so when a real disaster strikes what are things gonna look like in
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.640]  America because you know desperate people do desperate things and people are
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:14.240]  gonna become desperate because the what we're moving into right now is gonna be
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:18.960]  so similar to in the initial stages to 2008 if people remember there was a great
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:22.800]  credit crunch when panic and fear gripped the financial markets all of a
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:25.560]  sudden the banks and the financial institutions they don't want to lend to
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:29.720]  each other they don't want to lend to anyone else and and everything they've
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:32.400]  got a plan to take over all the small banks and everybody and give
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:35.200]  themselves trillions and I remember going to soccer games with my kids
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:38.960]  watching my son play and suddenly all the dads have the newspapers out in
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:42.720]  their phones caring about finances but then I told him they're gonna pump it
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:45.960]  back up then it's gonna get even worse they don't listen to that I mean people
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:50.520]  just don't listen go ahead oh it's true Alex and since the last time around you
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:53.760]  know our politicians that came out and they said we're gonna pick that we're
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:57.720]  gonna fix too big to fail but no did they fix it of course not instead the
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:01.120]  too big to fail banks I'm talking about Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley Bank of
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:06.000]  America you know collectively they've gotten 40% larger meanwhile 1,400
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.040]  smaller banks have totally gone out of existence so the problem of too big to
[01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:14.160]  fail is now bigger than ever now when this next crisis comes and the credit
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:17.600]  crunch comes and all of a sudden people can't get that you know little loans the
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:21.920]  mortgages the credit cards what we're gonna see is if you have a business or
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:24.880]  you're working somewhere you're gonna notice fewer people are coming in and
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:28.240]  when they come in they're gonna have not as much money to spend and so what we're
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:32.280]  gonna see we're gonna see businesses cut back we're gonna see stores closed in
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:37.120]  fact we just saw Walmart announced the closing of 269 stores worldwide we're
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:41.720]  gonna see workers laid off we're gonna see unemployment skyrocket and cuz most
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:47.240]  people and we're gonna see crime explode yeah we're already seeing rates of
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:52.880]  violent crime explode it's up 19% in Los Angeles over the past year other
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:58.280]  cities double-digit and this is key this is key crime has gone down massively they
[01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:02.360]  admit mainly because of gun proliferation and good people's hands so
[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:06.200]  you're gonna see huge numbers of gun deaths go up but it's gonna be criminals
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:09.520]  getting shot they're then gonna hype that and say take the guns that's why
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:13.640]  they're doing a new big gun push right now because they know crimes exploding and
[01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:19.160]  the criminal class on top and below as above so below cannot stand seeing us
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:24.840]  stand up against them yeah and we saw a similar pattern in Nazi Germany and
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:28.360]  communist China and the Soviet Union when they want to bring in tyranny they
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:33.640]  want to come grab all the guns so no one can be upset no one can resist no one
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:37.920]  can put up a fight and so that's that that's what Barack Obama wants to do just
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:41.520]  like we've seen it's a different a different package but it's the same
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:46.120]  thing but we are gonna see civil unrest in this country as things fall apart we
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:50.360]  are going to see and already they're fueling the racial tensions the racial
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:54.920]  riots even with this academy awards thing you know they're priming the pump
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:53:00.400]  and and so I believe we're headed for a period of crime riots craziness in this
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:05.720]  country no doubt and that's the key the key is that the on record the globalists
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:08.520]  have already tested this in other countries they're exacerbating it by
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:11.720]  design they'll hang out in switzerland new zealand while we're all killing each
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:15.760]  other they have engineered this the answer is having the state stand up
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.800]  recognize what's happening not go along with the central government and this
[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:24.800]  global plan they are walking us in to a plan to further bring us to our knees
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:29.360]  get us all scared and have us acquiesce to all of their globalist demands and
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:34.720]  thank the engineers of of all these problems for quote saving us as the
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:38.720]  Davos people that own half the stuff in the world through fraud on record
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:45.000]  lecture us about class warfare and class envy and promote class warfare and
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.560]  socialism I mean the public has got to wake up to this ballgame the bigger the
[01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:54.280]  socialism gets the bigger the taxes the more programs the worst the jobs get the
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:57.960]  worst the education gets the less opportunities you have and the richer
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:02.880]  these people get understand me viewers and listeners Mexico just Google this
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:06.880]  has the largest share of billionaires of any country in the world
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:10.680]  Mexico's only 130 million people they have more billionaires in the other
[01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:15.360]  country it's because Mexico wrote the book on colonialism post-colonialism
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:20.800]  you have a tiny elite that literally use those people as slaves and you look at
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:25.360]  the Mexican Congress you want about racism they are wider than I am folks
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:30.000]  most of Congress and they got names like Schmidt and all the rest of it okay
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.760]  you need because you're the Austrian you're an empire ran Mexico they still do
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:37.240]  and that's why Mexico attacked us in World War one the point is is you want
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:42.800]  to live like Mexico folks get ready for it okay that's their plan in fact guys
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:45.560]  just type in Mexico has the highest share of billionaires in the world I know
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:50.240]  that's a fact as I've seen it many times but go ahead mr. Schneider oh you're
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:54.400]  exactly right Alex a lot of times the elite they advance their agenda through
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:58.120]  crisis than every single solution they give us results in more money and more
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:02.920]  power in their hands more globalization more centralization and so you look at
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:08.920]  this report that Oxfam just put out you know you go back to 2010 and 388
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:12.800]  members of the elite had as much money as the poorest half of the world now
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:18.920]  it's down to 62 62 members of the global elite have as much wealth as the
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:25.920]  bottom 3.5 3.5 billion members of humanity have and so it's it's it's
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:31.480]  increasing the debt-based system around the world it funnels money to the very
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:35.440]  top you know every solution they come in it just pushes more money more power
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:39.480]  their way meanwhile Oxfam found that the bottom half of the world they've
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:44.080]  actually gotten a lot poorer since over the past few years so global income
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:49.160]  inequality is increasing and and the power and money is being concentrated at
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:53.600]  the very very top increasingly so the elite have gotten even more powerful
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:57.200]  even more control and yet they're not satisfied they're going to bring in more
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:01.000]  crisis to advance their agenda even more the problem reaction solution
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.240]  paradigm that they love to use and so they now they want to go for the big one
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:09.920]  that bring the middle class especially in the United States to their knees so
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:16.520]  that they can take us much farther down the road to their new world order that's
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:19.640]  right again you can pull up Carlos Slim or the richest man in the world you see
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:22.320]  number one now he's number two and again that's just the whole front and look at
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:25.240]  the list of Mexican billionaires and Forbes and and again that's just a
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:30.240]  microcosm of they don't want people to be wealthy they don't want people to be
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:34.160]  independent that's what Cloward and Pivenes that's the management system and
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:38.480]  I don't know how you get the leftist indoctrinated in public schools and
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:42.560]  doctrine in colleges and listen I never used to be the guy that was left left
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:44.760]  left I'm trying to get out of the left-right paradigm but in the left-right
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:50.040]  paradigm it's real that I mean I was against Bush and stuff Republicans were
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:53.920]  doing big time but the Democrats it's cultic they call for me to be shut down
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:58.280]  there were articles yesterday saying get rid of free speech it's racist their
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:02.640]  calls for just arresting gun owners in mass we go out and talk to Democrats on
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:06.880]  the street these are scary people they make jokes about dead babies I mean they
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:12.440]  seem to be just waddling decadent brown shirts oh it's absolutely true but the
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:15.480]  good news Alex is that people are starting to wake up you mentioned earlier

[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:31.840]  waking up they're seeking out alternative sources of information because
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:36.600]  they know the mainstream news is lying to them in fact over 90% of what people
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:41.320]  get from the television the movies the video games the publishing houses all
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:45.840]  the mainstream news outlets at the very top are owned by just six giant media
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:49.800]  conglomerates all of which are pushing the agenda of the lead so people are
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:53.000]  getting fed up they're sick of it so they're turning to your show they're

[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.520]  ninth planet they don't want to call it planet X so they delisted Pluto as the
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:54.480]  night so they can say that this is the ninth and it fits everything a planet
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:58.240]  X and I've always not poo poo planet X but you know everybody's saying it's

[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:34.720]  towns are just gonna die there's not gonna be money to fix anything and people
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:38.320]  need to get ready for this and what areas will survive what areas of the US
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:42.720]  and other areas will be okay I want to get your view on that right now George in
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:46.040]  Connecticut you're on the air with mr. Schneider from the economic collapse
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:51.240]  blog go ahead hi I'm trying to find out I'm out of the market completely and I'm
[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:54.920]  just wondering what areas might be food for less space if there are
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:58.720]  opportunities when when everything's down everybody's the hair is on fire
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:02.320]  firing they're jumping out of windows but it's buy up whatever yeah what do you
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:06.120]  think the bottom is and what do you think's gonna come back strong mr. Schneider
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:11.520]  well I believe a longer term on a broader view a huge bubble is bursting
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:16.040]  we've got a lot farther to fall in fact if you look at historical averages for
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:20.160]  example the cyclically adjusted price to earnings ratio and others from where we
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:24.840]  are right now we've got a fall another one-third on the Dow just to get to a
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:28.240]  point where there's not a bubble just to get back to the historical average where
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:32.720]  things make sense where prices make sense so that you know just try to jump in
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:36.320]  the market now and time the market and catch a little bit of an upswing is
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:44.480]  exceedingly dangerous and I wouldn't do it I'll tell you that so yeah it's a time
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:48.960]  to not you know avoid you don't want to try to catch a falling knife like they
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:56.080]  say so but it's we're in a bear market a wave of panic there's gonna be ups and
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:00.440]  downs now some of the biggest updates in in fact the two largest stock market
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:03.480]  increases in all of us history we're doing right in the middle of the stock
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:08.280]  market crash 2008 so don't be fooled by short-term upsurge you know now is a
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:13.760]  time of panic and of a bear market so be very careful sure but a long term
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:17.040]  obviously the big globalist blue chips will come back in my view do you
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:22.600]  disagree with that well long term we're gonna see ups and downs but in terms of
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:27.000]  where we were I don't think we're ever gonna get back there barring some type
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.520]  of hyperinflation and then of course your dollars won't be worth the same a lot
[02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:36.640]  of folks think this is because of demographics issues and cultural issues
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:41.320]  and things that a new dark age is beginning we'll see but folks should
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:44.440]  definitely be strapped in and serious and involved coming this is not a game
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:49.960]  thank you George great question let's talk now to Chris in Georgia we got time
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:54.920]  for your question we'll come back with his answer go ahead Chris hi Alex this

[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:05.320]  know that the condition of the world's economy is bad but what is the character
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:10.160]  of your this year's economic bloom and doom predictions from your guests like
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:14.840]  you know Schneider Dent and Kaiser that is different from previous year's
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:18.920]  predictions well sure we've been we've been warning of all this coming they
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:23.440]  did unlimited money printing and manipulations most the world's already
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:29.520]  in civil war collapse so our predictions have been incredibly accurate you know I'm
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:33.840]  not accusing you of crying wolf or anything like that but how do we get a
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:37.720]  feeling that it's really gonna hit the fan this time hold on hold on stay there
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:42.160]  stay there stay there I'm gonna come back to you cuz you you disagree or it
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:45.200]  sounds like or you're a skeptic which is great if you would have said that I'd

[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:53.280]  government building bunkers getting armored vehicles ready and building FEMA
[02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:58.120]  camps and saying it's for patriots in army documents so something big's coming
[02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:03.320]  presidential candidate Hillary Clinton denied reports that her private email
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:08.120]  server had been hacked after being confronted by an info wars correspondent
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:13.960]  at a campaign stop in Iowa last week it was reported on info wars dot com that
[02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:17.680]  your email server was hacked and you knowingly continued to use your email
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:22.000]  server any comment on that yeah it's totally untrue the question stems from
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:26.560]  an exclusive info wars interview earlier this month in which former secret
[02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:31.960]  service agent Dan Bongino reported that Hillary continued using her private
[02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:37.200]  email to discuss classified information while knowing that her server had been
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:41.520]  compromised the Clintons knew it was hacked and she did it anyway and not
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:46.360]  only is she not currently indicted or in prison she's running to be president
[02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:51.480]  of the United States if this is not a red flag to every Paul Revere out there

[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:48.040]  hack and then we have a video report with the secretary of defense former
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:51.920]  secretary of defense and others saying undoubtedly it happened so everyone says
[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:56.280]  our email got hacked but her we have this from high-level secret service who
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:09:01.960]  came on the show you name it so this is ongoing I want to finish up with some
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:04.880]  calls I want to give Chris some time here and then give Snyder some time
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:10.360]  Chris called in he said you just joined us how was this different from all of
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:14.280]  your past predictions that we're gonna have big collapses like the one we had
[02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:18.560]  before 2008 or the last few years we're talking about unlimited derivatives
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:24.720]  worse than 2008 banks you know digging in government ministry of defense
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:30.000]  reports in 2007 in England saying they think basically economic collapse 2016
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:37.360]  2017 Pentagon saying the same thing Pentagon two years ago trying to set up
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:41.280]  camps for three million people to quote re-educate the public now I'm not
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:45.160]  saying they're gonna use those but that's an army dot mill I mean that's
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:49.120]  sensational armored vehicles saying there for the veterans and gun owners I
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:52.880]  have the sheriffs on video saying all over the country we told you of course
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:56.580]  before they admitted it because we had the manuals you know we got the secret
[02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:59.920]  documents members seven years ago about for veterans and gun owners and
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:05.560]  Christians being the big enemy so it's kind of like knowing Hitler's gonna
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:09.560]  invade France in 1939 but you don't know exactly when and then finally it
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:15.160]  happens then when Soros runs around saying run for the hills collapse and
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:20.200]  the Royal Bank of Scotland says sell everything that's a quote two weeks ago
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:24.280]  and then now the markets are plunging I want to put a graph on screen for TV
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:28.360]  viewers for radio listeners all describe it this is how I describe it what are
[02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:32.360]  islands that they're not floating things that capsize like the congressman from
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:39.160]  Georgia says okay they are mountains on the sea floor that have been thrust up
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:44.320]  by tectonic activity and if you're living up on the top of a hill or a
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:49.040]  mountain and and the water's rising slowly and you say oh there's no
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:53.720]  economic crisis you know there's wars 30 plus civil wars mass death doubling and
[02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:59.840]  people starving all over the world from you know 30 million to just it's bad and
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:03.980]  this way says oh where's this crash you're talking about I don't know two
[02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:08.880]  years ago restaurants in Austin had about half of what they used to now they
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:10.920]  just don't have anybody and a lot of them are closing I mean really good
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:15.640]  restaurants our audience is tripled the last year but funds are coming at the
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:19.080]  same level most of talk radio is going bankrupt media is going bankrupt
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:23.680]  everywhere Carlos Slim has to prop up the New York Times I mean and then people
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:27.280]  just do this thing like you know we hear world governments coming where is it
[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:31.760]  it's been announced we hear all this is gonna happen where is it Alex we hear
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:37.560]  they're coming for the guns Alex where is it they're coming for the guns so we're
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:40.720]  trying to stop the economic collapse pointing out who's behind it to
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:43.840]  consolidate control Schneider you want to respond to Chris and we'll give him the
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:48.640]  last word oh I absolutely do you know a lot of people are so conditioned by the
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:52.360]  mainstream media telling them that everything's okay but look at what's
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:56.480]  already happened like I mentioned earlier since the middle of last year June
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:02.600]  2015 more than $15 trillion has been wiped out we've entered a global bear
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:06.400]  market for stocks one-fifth of all global stock market wealth was already
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:10.520]  gone we only have four-fifths left you know how much more are we gonna have to
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:15.120]  lose are we gonna have to be down 30% 40% 50% before people finally admit that
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:19.560]  something's happening you know everyone agrees that junk bonds have crashed
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:22.720]  everyone agrees that oil is crashed everyone agrees that industrial
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:26.680]  commodities have already crashed so I would encourage Chris to go to my
[02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:30.480]  website look at the things I've been warning about specifically for six
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:33.800]  months leading into this I said this is the danger zone we're entering the
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:38.080]  danger zone it's gonna continue as we go into 2016 and beyond this is not a
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:42.040]  single-day event or a single week event but we're seeing a progression and the
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:45.560]  things that we've seen so far in 2016 over the last few weeks are simply a
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:48.800]  logical progression of what's already been happening since the middle of
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:52.800]  20 and the elite is happening right now and the elite have known it and have
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:57.320]  been letting a good crisis not go to waste and have been exacerbating much of
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:01.560]  it do you disagree with that statement oh not at all I think the elite very much
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:06.480]  will look forward to using the coming crisis to advance their agenda and help
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:09.960]  promote their new world order because I think in many ways their agenda has
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:13.640]  stalled so I think they're looking forward to a good crisis in order to
[02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:17.440]  listen to something I've been waiting to do absolutely doesn't happen a lot but
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:21.560]  sometimes when I walk over my restaurant knock my tea over or they'll get in my
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:24.160]  face it's usually when a big liberal conference is in town or something and
[02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:28.240]  I'm downtown or they'll go boo boo boo and they'll go where's the martial law
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:32.200]  where's the collapse where's that I'm just like I'm trying to stop it but I
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:37.520]  mean you untenable 2.2 quadrillion global we've been signed on to Obamacare
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:43.120]  written to screw us death panels I mean you know again baby parts being sold I
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:48.080]  mean people are so selfish that if they're doing okay they think nothing's
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:54.120]  happening or they think we're trying to destroy confidence if we had a good
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:57.640]  system and people were attacking it like when Soros 20 years ago was attacking
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:00.600]  things I would say I was against it you know and I would try to promote
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:04.280]  confidence but you can't have confidence in something that's designed to go
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:08.600]  belly up is the elite evacuate to armored redoubts and I told people that
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:12.760]  six years ago it's now mainstream news let's go ahead and go back to Chris
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:18.080]  Chris go ahead okay well you know those are really both affected responses and
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:23.080]  I'm not that much in disagreement but what I want to my question for Schneider
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:31.600]  is how would he convey to his listeners that this time this year January 2016 is
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:39.160]  really different he just said it's all here the numbers are much worse okay the
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:48.440]  numbers are much worse did Walmart close 260 something stores in 2008 bro right
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:52.200]  it's okay so it's accelerating you're talking about bell curve acceleration of

[02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:40.400]  Trump because I heard somebody inside baseball from his campaign it is wild

[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:47.800]  but we'll show some of it as b-roll but Hillary looked at you when you said
[02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:53.160]  info wars like like like she was Medusa I got very upset rubbed on her lip and
[02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:56.400]  then said hey I don't know anything about emails being hacked even though it's a
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:01.040]  national scandal it's been confirmed it's coming out in the Pentagon Richard
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:05.360]  Reeves great job there on the campaign trail Alex thank you Richard Reeves with
[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:11.680]  info wars.com and yes it did capture Hillary's attention last night when I
[02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:15.720]  mentioned info wars.com especially and if you were watching the little demon
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:19.400]  behind her his little devil wings started flapping real fast and he came
[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:23.560]  around Hillary real quick to zoom in on me so I knew it wasn't gonna be much time
[02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:28.800]  to try to follow up but definitely they know who info wars.com is for sure they
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:32.840]  don't have there's no question on that but I'll tell you folks the way to ask
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:37.520]  Hillary a question is right now between now and the Cox's she's gonna be here
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:41.760]  for a lot of events you need to team up with a friend and put a question together
[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:46.840]  and get on that get in the front get get to the event and about an hour and a
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:49.920]  half beforehand so you can get a good front row seat and that way you got a
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:53.200]  chance to ask Hillary a question because it's even tougher now because what
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:58.840]  happened I've been to two Hillary events before this and the procedure was to
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:03.160]  have members of the audience handed a microphone and they could ask a question
[02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:07.800]  and then Hillary Clinton would go for a five or ten minutes and really that way
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:10.560]  she cut down on the number of questions she would answer she would only maybe
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:14.520]  answer four or five questions the whole time and I expected that procedure last
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:17.840]  night but they for whatever reason maybe they sense that they had some real
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:23.400]  questions coming and they changed that procedure and just did a rope line photo
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:28.640]  op and quick question op for Hillary Clinton so that's the way to do it we
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:33.000]  need info warriors in Iowa and New Hampshire and wherever else that Hillary
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:36.640]  may appear and let's get some real questions asked with Hillary right now
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:42.320]  because once Iowa and New Hampshire go by I don't think anybody no real normal
[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:46.760]  human being no real normal voter is probably ever going to have an
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:49.920]  opportunity to ask Hillary any more questions here after these first few
[02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:55.240]  states come up I was showing an earlier drudge had over a million 200,000 votes
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:27:01.200]  on his site and Trump got the lion's share and then and then Sanders and then
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:10.000]  Cruz Hillary literally didn't even get one point she got 0.88 so I mean that
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:13.440]  and that's Democrats you know they're voting for Sanders I mean this lady is
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:17.760]  hated her own party's trying to dump her they've got Biden in the wings she is so
[02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:21.000]  close to being pushed over the edge right now but the word is she's got all
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:25.040]  this blackmail material on everybody I mean I can't believe that the
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:28.320]  establishment's putting more money into her than all other candidates combined I
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:35.200]  mean what's wrong with the Clinton voters out there or do I even exist well
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:38.920]  they do exist there's two or three hundred hardcore people lined up for
[02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:44.200]  the event yesterday and the broken coalition that Larry Nichols talks
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:49.720]  about part of that coalition is the public educational system around the
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:53.600]  country the New World Order controlled and manipulated public education system
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:28:00.640]  in our country is part of what is a national enemy a national enemy to our
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:04.400]  country because they're the ones that are really lining up they think Hillary's
[02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:08.680]  going to hand them pay raises and retirements and all kinds of stuff she's
[02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:11.960]  the Bilderberg member she's the globalist so they love her but she's got
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:14.960]  act like she's anti-establishment but her supporters want her to be
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:19.040]  establishment and deliver her the goods but the country's already going bankrupt
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:22.200]  don't they get we're coming to the end of the line you know like they have in
[02:28:22.200 --> 02:28:27.120]  the traveling Wilbury song well it is the end the line Alex and I tell you you
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:30.080]  know I heard the Larry Nichols interview yesterday and I recommend all of your
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:33.920]  audience make sure to go to Alex Jones channel or find the archive and listen
[02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:38.520]  and or watch the Larry Nichols interview with Alex from yesterday because he made
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:42.600]  up he made a lot of great points talking about the broke broken coalition
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:45.920]  etc and also talking about how that Republican establishment the
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:49.880]  Democratic establishment are both helping cover Hillary right now thinking
[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:52.880]  they're gonna be protected if she becomes president well you know what
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:57.880]  they're in a political sense they're the walking dead because most likely a lot
[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:00.960]  of these characters in the House and Senate they're gonna get fired on this
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:05.360]  2016 election cycle the way that the votes are breaking down so dumb I mean I
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:08.200]  mean they just go along with the system and I'm not bashing Rand Paul he's a
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:12.120]  great guy but he listened to his advisors to be all nice and calm and all
[02:29:12.120 --> 02:29:15.560]  that stuff and not be like more like Trump and they just then can't believe
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:19.320]  one that doesn't work the system sabotages you when it's being friendly to
[02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:24.200]  you well and that's right and like I say these guys that are in office right now
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:30.200]  a lot of them are politically the dead men walking the dead women walking because
[02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:32.960]  they're most likely many of them are gonna be sent home in this election cycle
[02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:37.800]  and then you know if Lord willing we get to 2018 2020 even despite black box
[02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:42.480]  voting the the people are coming the info warriors are taking action the
[02:29:42.480 --> 02:29:45.320]  info right stay there stay there Richard I got a few more questions about the
[02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:49.480]  campaign trail and the key caucuses that are coming up we're on the March the
[02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:56.560]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:57.800 --> 02:30:02.480]  in early January the hermit nation of North Korea announced that it had
[02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:06.600]  successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb this would make the fourth successful
[02:30:06.600 --> 02:30:10.400]  test that the isolated nation has claimed analysts at the time said this was
[02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:14.640]  Kim Jong-un and a display of saber rattling to mark his birthday and to
[02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:18.400]  highlight a rare ruling party Congress scheduled for May the first gathering of
[02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:23.360]  its kind in 35 years but just yesterday Fox News reported that US diplomats have
[02:30:23.360 --> 02:30:27.320]  stepped up pressure on China to play a leading role in punishing North Korea for
[02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:31.120]  its most recent test the US is also stepping up its military presence in
[02:30:31.120 --> 02:30:35.160]  that region there are now two aircraft carriers stationed near Tokyo the latest
[02:30:35.160 --> 02:30:40.000]  containing 26 fighter jets including the F-22 stealth aircraft the US military
[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:43.680]  has stated that this is for training purposes only but as the economy goes
[02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:47.400]  into freefall could these training exercises provoke the nation of North

[02:33:39.640 --> 02:33:47.560]  this piece that's up on info wars.com titled everyone but Hillary thinks her
[02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:53.360]  email was hacked and Richard Reeves reporting from Iowa he's gonna be
[02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:58.320]  covering the caucuses the next two weeks there for us fellow Austinite part of
[02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:02.000]  the info war for more than a decade folks that don't know who Richard is he's
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:06.080]  working with us more now as he did back then in the past covering a political
[02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:11.240]  events Richard looking at this she's blackmailing everybody so they don't
[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:15.440]  want to get rid of her but at a certain point she commits so many crimes it is
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:19.800]  credits the system show they're in a no-win situation what's your view on
[02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:25.320]  that they are in a no-win situation because the way I see it is Barack Obama
[02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:30.120]  is looking at having a legacy after he's gone out of the presidency and he's
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:34.400]  staring Donald Trump in the face knowing that if Donald Trump is elected
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:39.000]  president I think he's gonna come full force and investigate Barack Obama from
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:43.520]  stem to start everything for birth certificate to you know illegal illegal
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:47.240]  immigration to fast and furious everything's gonna be investigated so
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:52.280]  Barack Obama has to be in a panic beforehand it looked like Barack Obama
[02:34:52.280 --> 02:34:56.240]  could count on either Hillary coming in being the new president and or Jeb Bush
[02:34:56.240 --> 02:35:01.120]  which you know Jeb Bush would tell the line for Barack Obama surely so I think
[02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:05.600]  he was planning on that happen and now I think what you got is you got Hillary
[02:35:05.600 --> 02:35:09.080]  Clinton in a panic you got Bill Clinton in a panic you got Barack Obama in a
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:13.520]  panic and then you've got you know all of the executive staff that have ever
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:17.280]  worked for Barack Obama potentially exactly their stuff in a vice this is
[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:22.920]  an incredible time to be alive and we have the national review coming out
[02:35:22.920 --> 02:35:27.320]  like a declaration of independence against Trump meanwhile Phyllis
[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:32.040]  Schlafly of the Eagle Forum which is goes back to Barry Goldwater the true
[02:35:32.040 --> 02:35:36.040]  roots of modern libertarian conservatism coming out endorsing Trump I know you
[02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:39.040]  support Trump you've been a longtime libertarian activist trying to take
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:44.080]  over the Republican Party even a bit of delegate and things Richard you see Jeb
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:47.760]  Bush bragging I don't care if I get 3% I'm still gonna get the nomination you
[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:52.040]  know at a certain point that's not gonna fly with these arrogant people and so
[02:35:52.040 --> 02:35:56.080]  why do you support Donald Trump and is he making you more proud of the fact you
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:36:00.800]  support him or less with what he's doing well I really do like Donald Trump
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:05.120]  right now the tactic being utilized on Ted Cruz I'm not a fan of you and I have
[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:11.120]  been in the Patriot movement for decades you and I first met in the fall of 2001
[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:16.120]  after 9-11 September and as a matter of fact it was I you know kind of an
[02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:20.000]  ironic coincidence that Planet X was the first thing I ever asked you about and
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.200]  you were talking about it today but I do like Donald Trump I think he'll be the
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:28.160]  one that comes in there really shakes things up and I really do think you know
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:31.480]  if we want to have a good economy in the United States that he's the man to bring
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:35.320]  it that being said the infighting amongst the Patriot and Info Warrior
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:41.400]  community is deadly so he needs to realize I hope he needs to realize that
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:46.800]  Ted Cruz is not the enemy he's a friend and you know the fact that Ted Cruz goes
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:50.320]  up there and nobody in the Senate likes him that's a badge of honor that's the
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:53.840]  type of thing that I would expect Alex Jones to do is to go up into the Senate
[02:36:53.840 --> 02:37:01.240]  and shake their tree well that's right and look Rand Paul attacked Trump and
[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:06.520]  his numbers plummeted now Cruz is doing it and it's really stupid I mean Cruz is
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:10.200]  really smart and I guess he just thinks to get the number one slot he's got a
[02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:14.600]  gamble and try to take down Trump so he knows it's dangerous it's not working
[02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:18.480]  his numbers have started going down since he started attacking two weeks ago
[02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:23.760]  well in my book you know there's that dull Rockefeller saying that competition
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:28.080]  is a sin well we can have competition in the Patriot community let's just make it
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:32.840]  let's let's have respectful disagreements and not go you know nuclear
[02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:36.560]  assaulted earth weapons against each other because like I said that's been
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:41.680]  destructive we've had polls showing that about 70% of the electorate is ready to
[02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:45.680]  fire the establishment that is fantastic news I mentioned the Drudge poll
[02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:48.840]  Hillary didn't even get 1% but Bernie people say oh that's a Republican poll
[02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:53.400]  no it's a populist poll Drudge is populist by any way you look at it
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:57.120]  that's why he's so popular across the board it's a poll and Bernie Sanders
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:00.800]  came in second place behind Trump so so that ought to tell folks that's real
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:04.720]  Democrats in their voting and they don't want Hillary and Bernie does in a
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:08.360]  misguided fashion you know he's kind of exposing the New World Order powers to
[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:13.160]  be especially the financial powers to be so he's kind of showing that so that's
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:16.560]  nothing about Donald Trump is when Bernie Sanders is gonna be out of the
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:20.280]  picture at some point I think you know we're gonna see Joe Biden trotted in or
[02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:24.600]  we're gonna see Hillary indeed somehow despite all this gravity against her
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:29.160]  become the nominee but you know a lot of these folks that like Bernie I think
[02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:32.320]  they could be leveraged to Donald Trump that's another thing I like about Donald
[02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:36.800]  Trump is that I think absolutely a lot of Democrats come across the island vote
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:40.200]  well national polls already show a 20% in Gallup polls so they'll vote for him
[02:38:40.200 --> 02:38:42.920]  right now and it's only gonna grow great job Richard Reeves we're gonna go to
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:46.640]  this report tied in with your confrontation with Hillary yesterday and
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:50.320]  we'll continue to be checking in with you on the nightly news tonight and also
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:54.400]  right throughout Sunday I want to get you back on and right through next week
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:58.760]  and into the caucuses and into these primaries okay very good thank you Alex
[02:38:58.760 --> 02:39:04.180]  thank you there goes Richard Reeves from Iowa there at the Ben Carson event where
[02:39:04.180 --> 02:39:06.680]  people are already lining up hours before to go in and be searched for the
[02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:13.000]  secret service expanding on this and we're gonna get Leanne McAdoo on on what
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:17.920]  she's learned there in Flint Michigan with the collapsing water system in a
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:23.840]  moment then the fourth hour with David Knight but when you really really look
[02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:32.040]  at this it is mind-boggling that people would actually support Hillary Clinton
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:36.880]  or Jeff Bush I mean just give me a break it shows you how just desperately
[02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:40.000]  stupid some people that are politically involved that's folks that are
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:43.520]  politically involved that actually know how to tie their shoelaces and they
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:46.920]  still support these people they get off on thinking they're invested in the
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:51.360]  system by going along with the candidate so here is the report everybody
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:55.800]  but Hillary thinks her email was hacked and we need to get this report out we
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:39:59.320]  just tweeted it at real Alex Jones please retweet it because you're the real
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:02.680]  power of this broadcast we salute you we are brothers and sisters and arms and
[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:08.200]  then Leanne McAdoo will join us via Skype we have breaking news from info
[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:13.320]  wars.com it seems that Richard Reeves info wars.com political
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:17.360]  correspondent and reporter was at an event where Hillary decided to take
[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:22.480]  questions on the rope line and this is what it's like people you get out you
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:26.280]  get in the game and you never know what can happen Richard was following up on
[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:31.680]  an interview that Dan Bongino did with Alex Jones back on January 14th secret
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:35.680]  service Hillary's email was hacked last chapter in the book talks about the
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:40.440]  Clinton scandal the Clinton email scandal and a source fed to me and said
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:45.200]  please please and by the way Alex an unimpeachable source by any measure this
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:49.720]  is not some you know lunatic a fringe guy out there this is a
[02:40:49.720 --> 02:40:55.280]  unimpeachable source said not only was the email server hacked which is breaking
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:58.400]  news I'm actually surprised not more people a couple people have emailed me
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:01.480]  about the book who read that I didn't make a big deal out of it at the time but
[02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:06.120]  not only was it hacked Alex but the Clintons knew it was hacked they knew and
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:10.280]  they kept using it think about this think of how deranged this is Alex you
[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:14.400]  have a woman running for president United States who traded our deepest
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:19.560]  national security secrets over a private server she knew wasn't secured and that
[02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:24.360]  nefarious actors were looking at the emails and she did it anyway and not
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:29.880]  only is she not currently indicted or in prison she's running to be president
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:35.120]  United States if this is not a red flag to every Paul Revere out there that
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:38.760]  something's wrong then you know what the country is lost at that point because
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:42.160]  that I couldn't when I heard the story I couldn't believe it so there's former
[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:47.200]  secret service Dan Bongino saying from an unpeachable source that the email
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:51.760]  server was hacked and that was breaking news last week now we have Richard Reeves
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:57.840]  in line at a Hillary Clinton event and he asks her the following question last
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:02.000]  week it was reported on info wars.com that your email server was hacked and you
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:05.920]  knowingly continued to use your email server can you comment on that yeah it's
[02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:16.720]  totally untrue and this is 43 seconds of pure pure gold from the way she
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:20.560]  scratches the side of her mouth to the looks on her staffers you can see the
[02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:24.760]  one here in this picture she is just totally disgusted that someone would
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:29.720]  dare ask a real question the secret service guy interestingly enough he
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:34.000]  doesn't seem to care I think he I think he kind of likes the fact that this
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:40.240]  question was asked of Hillary Clinton she says it's totally untrue totally untrue
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:45.920]  so she repeats this line let's look at the evidence Politico October 8th 2015
[02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:52.400]  Clinton server faced hacking from China South Korea and Germany the contractor
[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:57.320]  SEC NAP network security identified the hacks but according to internal emails
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:01.200]  cited and briefly quoted in the Johnson letter Clinton's email server may have
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:05.960]  lacked the threat detection program for three months and here's Breitbart from
[02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:10.560]  November 1st Hillary Clinton got hacked email from her friend it's totally
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:14.400]  untrue former secretary of state Hillary Clinton opened an email message on her
[02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:18.000]  private account saw that she had received a virus infected link and
[02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:23.040]  replied to her friend that she had been hacked another article from Breitbart
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:28.400]  let's stop there Hillary Clinton that's only half the video this video needs to go
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:33.920]  viral on major websites news sites because it just goes on where Hillary
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:38.040]  admits she got hacked people say she got hacked the Pentagon says she got hacked
[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:41.880]  the former secretary of defense says she got hacked and then it shows her
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:48.600]  assistance freak out freak out that someone could dare get through and ask a
[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:55.240]  real question and again the secret service knows what a bad lady she
[02:43:55.240 --> 02:44:00.600]  obviously is and is aware of what's going on we're gonna shift gears but we're
[02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:04.240]  gonna cover more of this in the fourth hour I'm also gonna shoot a special
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:08.520]  report on this 10th planet that's been discovered and more about it is so

[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:18.000]  you know saying feds save us the federal government can't even get light bulbs in
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:21.000]  their buildings half the time and people defecating the hallways all over
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:24.680]  federal buildings those are so insane many of them they can't get rid of
[02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:29.000]  miscreant mentally ill federal employees I mean you know they couldn't do anything
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:33.200]  you could train about take your guns but oh they're gonna save you on the east

[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:42.600]  Flint Michigan she's filed a lot of reports she'll be filing one for the
[02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:45.440]  nightly news tonight obviously the numbers are a lot higher than 10 people
[02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:49.240]  dying from poisoning people's dogs are dying she's now been in probably the
[02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:56.720]  most dangerous most dilapidated city of any size in the United States and again
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:45:59.680]  we see folks walking around back there in the background Leanne where are you
[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:03.760]  right now in Flint and what have you discovered well I'm here in downtown
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:07.360]  Flint we are at the restaurant that we were at yesterday we spoke to that
[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:12.040]  business owner that said that he had prepped his outfit years before because
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:14.760]  he didn't trust the government when they said that the water was completely fine
[02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:19.680]  so he outfitted his whole place with reverse osmosis so he or we're here
[02:46:19.680 --> 02:46:24.600]  once again today in downtown Flint and earlier this morning we were driving
[02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:28.320]  around getting some drone footage of some of these dilapidated neighborhoods and
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:33.760]  what we learned is it looks like people have huge lots in their yard and in
[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:39.880]  fact what that is is thousands of homes have been completely raised and so it
[02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:44.160]  looks like people have huge lots of land when really it's that there's been
[02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:47.920]  hundreds of thousands of homes just completely raised so you're not even
[02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:52.880]  actually seeing the devastation because they've you know demolished them all it's
[02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:56.240]  pretty kind of sad because when you take a look around it really kind of reminds
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:47:03.200]  you of that old America you know that Americana and it's being bulldozed well
[02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:07.080]  naftan got killed Flint it really damaged Detroit I hope Detroit can come
[02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:10.880]  back I think Michigan Andrews are great people but you had big socialist unions
[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:15.200]  the Democratic Party to the mix it's a big problem have we dug into whose fault
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:18.260]  you know I mean I know it's the fault of the deindustrialization the water
[02:47:18.260 --> 02:47:22.200]  problems the corruption in government but is it the governor's overall fault
[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:28.240]  is it the mayor in the buck passing or is it both sides well even the
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:32.160]  emergency manager that came in this decision to switch over the water from
[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:35.280]  from Detroit to the Flint River had already been made prior to that
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:40.160]  emergency manager being put in place but the issue was that Detroit was really
[02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:44.280]  raising the prices of water here people are saying that their water bill we
[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:47.920]  spoke to an angry mother last night we uploaded that video this morning her
[02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:53.400]  water bill is $60 every month before she even turns the water on they're paying
[02:47:53.400 --> 02:47:57.760]  the highest water rates in the country for poison and so that was one of the
[02:47:57.760 --> 02:48:00.680]  reasons why they originally wanted to switch off of the Detroit water was
[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:07.400]  because they were paying these astronomical rates Detroit right they
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:11.320]  made a James Bond movie the one before the last about a group in Latin America
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:15.680]  turning off the river to bankrupt the city and then taking it over well that's
[02:48:15.680 --> 02:48:19.520]  actually what they do in the IMF and World Bank plans they got leaked in 2002
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:24.120]  this is what they actually do yeah and you can see that here we spoke with a
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:28.680]  gentleman they he's kind of the last man standing they're trying to clear out the
[02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:33.240]  entire area and turn it into a green space because it's so contaminated you
[02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:38.120]  have GM and Buick these other companies they had these entire industrial
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:43.560]  spaces and now they're completely cleared out and they left just massive waste
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:47.080]  and it's totally contaminated so they're trying to clear out entire
[02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:51.000]  neighborhoods well here's the allegory I want to see if this rings true with you
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:54.000]  or the folks you've been talking to now you're gonna come back and put all these
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:57.440]  reports together in a big you know special report boil down all this HD
[02:48:57.440 --> 02:49:03.000]  drone footage but America is kind of being seen as Flint or as Michigan
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:07.160]  itself that's the way we're gonna go under globalist looting we're a zone where
[02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:11.200]  this has been decided to do and as long as you're a globalist you can be as toxic
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:14.080]  as you want then we use environmental regulations to shut down all their
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:17.640]  competition and you know harass people with the green police and then of course
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:21.160]  all the other big companies will just rig everything I like Volkswagen got caught
[02:49:21.160 --> 02:49:25.400]  doing but I mean it also comes down to the people God helps those that helps
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:30.200]  themselves I'm sorry but I mean if it's toxic waste everywhere if you live on a
[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:34.000]  landfill if your kids are deformed if everybody's dying and being poisoned
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:38.560]  why don't they move out I don't want to hear their two poor Latin Americans are
[02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:42.560]  moving out because they live in hell I mean why don't they move to another
[02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:47.880]  state right and the other thing that we learned we had a woman tell us last
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:51.800]  night that even if she went to go try and dig a well deep enough that they
[02:49:51.800 --> 02:49:55.200]  could hit pure water or try to do some type of system where they could be
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:59.160]  collecting rainwater getting their own water own fresh water the city will come
[02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:04.000]  and condemn their home so you're not allowed to unplug from the municipal
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:08.040]  water supply even though they know it's poison they're charging them up the
[02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:12.840]  wazoo to pay for this poisonous water and if you try to untap from the city
[02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:16.880]  they'll condemn your house so I mean this is what's happening with America that
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:20.360]  is outrageous to me the fact that you can't even go and get your own fresh
[02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:25.040]  water to help yourself well the drone footage you got that to Mr. Zimmerman
[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:30.120]  got is world-class and it's it's like a science fiction movie because even in
[02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:35.240]  downtown at rush hour right at dusk there's there's hardly any cars driving
[02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:39.520]  around I mean I expect to see zombies running around here any minute screaming
[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:44.400]  brains no you nailed it that's that's what it feels like here it's like a
[02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:48.280]  goat like it's my 1840 or 50 or something way back in the day before
[02:50:48.280 --> 02:50:51.600]  well stay there Liam we're gonna come back to you in a moment and then of
[02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:54.920]  course the fourth hour calls in more but I tell you she met a guy that didn't

[02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:25.720]  of her at comedy clubs they had her official campaign threatened comedy
[02:54:25.720 --> 02:54:30.120]  clubs so we did this and got dozens of really great videos the three finalists

[02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:41.320]  to have time because there were so many hundreds of videos to play at least 20
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:45.400]  or so on the nightly news and some here on the radio and TV show because they're
[02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:51.680]  just excellent and it stands up against her in a big way and so I've pretty much

[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:28.080]  tap water is good and it's this belief that tap water is the best there is and
[02:57:28.080 --> 02:57:32.080]  you can trust it when they add all these poisons to it and it's their religion
[02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:36.520]  they're a cult we're gonna drink the government water when our own science are

[02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:57.920]  in that water and he said yes yes because the scientists are telling us that
[02:57:57.920 --> 02:58:02.360]  it's safe now and they're like really I wouldn't let my child bathe in that water

[03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:19.760]  coming on and telling them it's perfectly fine you just don't give your
[03:04:19.760 --> 03:04:23.520]  children hot baths and it's it's 10 degrees outside and they're telling them

[03:08:02.840 --> 03:08:22.800]  live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting in worldwide, it's Alex Jones welcome back
[03:08:22.800 --> 03:08:27.760]  on to the Alex Jones show on this Friday January 22nd 2016 I'm David Knight here
[03:08:27.760 --> 03:08:32.240]  with the news wrap-up hour major story that perhaps you haven't seen it was
[03:08:32.240 --> 03:08:35.720]  reported on defense one not too many people have picked this up Matt brought
[03:08:35.720 --> 03:08:41.240]  this into me said look at this Senate leader Mitch McConnell offers members a
[03:08:41.240 --> 03:08:47.280]  snow weekend surprise late Wednesday night it even surprised Senate majority
[03:08:47.280 --> 03:08:51.360]  whip John Cornyn he was unaware that McConnell had set up this and what is it
[03:08:51.360 --> 03:08:56.760]  that he set up when asked about he goes he did set this up well what he is
[03:08:56.760 --> 03:09:00.160]  setting up is an authorization for the use of military force and you may say
[03:09:00.160 --> 03:09:04.800]  well we've already had that yeah we had that in response to the 9-11 terrorist
[03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:08.880]  attack they were supposed to I rarely do this but you told me about this mm-hmm
[03:09:08.880 --> 03:09:12.080]  when I got all five minutes ago I'm gonna let you continue I'm gonna be doing a
[03:09:12.080 --> 03:09:15.760]  Facebook mentions to do my own breakdown on this after you're off but this is
[03:09:15.760 --> 03:09:20.760]  really really a big deal and I began to read this this is unprecedented
[03:09:20.760 --> 03:09:25.040]  everywhere in the world including the US and it gives the president the power
[03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:28.480]  they'll spend it oh you're against the military no the military is what's been
[03:09:28.480 --> 03:09:35.400]  warning us about this power for Syria you know to to to help Al Qaeda ISIS but
[03:09:35.400 --> 03:09:39.400]  also the economic collapse of snowstorm and I'm not saying they're taking over
[03:09:39.400 --> 03:09:42.920]  before that it becomes a new Jade Helm thing I'm saying it's part of the process
[03:09:42.920 --> 03:09:47.320]  of just getting rid of all checks and balances but it is a martial law take
[03:09:47.320 --> 03:09:52.120]  over bill it is unprecedented and the minute I saw it I realized that this
[03:09:52.120 --> 03:09:55.600]  just broke a few hours ago and I went notice other people are already saying
[03:09:55.600 --> 03:09:59.800]  that so that's what this is go ahead absolutely what's different about this
[03:09:59.800 --> 03:10:03.760]  authorization for the use of military forces now being put forward at the last
[03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:07.480]  minute by Mitch McConnell when all of Washington is being shut down with a
[03:10:07.480 --> 03:10:11.840]  snowstorm and of course as I mentioned it completely surprised the Senate
[03:10:11.840 --> 03:10:15.440]  majority whip John Courtney said I hadn't heard anything about he goes he did
[03:10:15.440 --> 03:10:19.400]  he put this forward what is it what's different about this not only is it not
[03:10:19.400 --> 03:10:24.640]  a response to these specific 9-11 terrorist attacks as they were using for
[03:10:24.640 --> 03:10:30.520]  that this would remove any limits related to time or geography let me repeat
[03:10:30.520 --> 03:10:34.800]  that this authorization for the use of military force would reduce would
[03:10:34.800 --> 03:10:41.520]  eliminate any restrictions on time or geography it would remove any restrictions
[03:10:41.520 --> 03:10:47.240]  on the president's use of ground troops think about the NDA think about when
[03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:51.160]  they put in there and said we have we're going to say that we have the power
[03:10:51.160 --> 03:10:57.600]  to have the military and definitely retain people without charges remember
[03:10:57.600 --> 03:11:03.520]  when Obama signed that on a New Year's Eve I think it was in 2000 I think it
[03:11:03.520 --> 03:11:07.800]  was coming up in 2011 I think it was a 2012 NDAA nevertheless it was a New
[03:11:07.800 --> 03:11:11.600]  Year's Eve that he did that everybody was concerned about it that and rightfully
[03:11:11.600 --> 03:11:15.280]  so how do you have a situation where you've got the military can pick up
[03:11:15.280 --> 03:11:21.120]  anybody and hold them indefinitely okay not only did Obama not get rid of get
[03:11:21.120 --> 03:11:24.960]  mo liberals think about this not only did he not get rid of get mo but he
[03:11:24.960 --> 03:11:30.000]  extended get mo to everyone I said we have this anywhere we can use the
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:34.440]  authorization for the use of military force and they said well this is against
[03:11:34.440 --> 03:11:38.280]  any kind of terrorist attacks so that could many people are saying that could
[03:11:38.280 --> 03:11:43.080]  be construed as saying that you're at war here in the continental United States
[03:11:43.080 --> 03:11:47.080]  that you could use this authorization for the use of military force against
[03:11:47.080 --> 03:11:50.000]  people in the United States because we've got a war on terrorism the war on
[03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:56.320]  terrorism is global it has no specific enemy so it is eternal and so it could
[03:11:56.320 --> 03:12:00.600]  be used against us we all said that we're set your conspiracy theories then
[03:12:00.600 --> 03:12:05.360]  would never do that so now we've got Mitch McConnell coming out and saying
[03:12:05.360 --> 03:12:08.640]  he's going to allow the president to use ground troops there will not be any
[03:12:08.640 --> 03:12:12.440]  limits related to time or geography do you see how they're rolling this out they
[03:12:12.440 --> 03:12:16.680]  say after months of worrying the such a resolution would tie the next president's
[03:12:16.680 --> 03:12:21.120]  hands that's what he was saying anyway Mitch McConnell moved to fast track the
[03:12:21.120 --> 03:12:25.320]  measure and surprised even his top deputy who said I wasn't aware he was
[03:12:25.320 --> 03:12:28.320]  doing this he really did this I don't know about this but of course it already
[03:12:28.320 --> 03:12:34.720]  has four Republican co-sponsors now first in line Lindsey Graham then Daniel
[03:12:34.720 --> 03:12:41.760]  Coates Joni Ernst and Oren Hatch there you go okay now this was after the
[03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:46.800]  Obama administration had put forward last February a measure that would
[03:12:46.800 --> 03:12:51.440]  authorize the use of offensive ground combat operations of course it's against
[03:12:51.440 --> 03:12:54.360]  ISIS okay we're going to go to Syria we're gonna put boots on the ground
[03:12:54.360 --> 03:12:59.160]  against ISIS that would have ended three years after it and was enacted
[03:12:59.160 --> 03:13:03.000]  unless reauthorized in other words it had a sunset provision on it it was
[03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:08.160]  specific but now the Republicans come back and they always want to one up the
[03:13:08.160 --> 03:13:12.400]  military industrial complex Democrats and say no we're gonna remove the
[03:13:12.400 --> 03:13:16.920]  restrictions on time and geography so be aware that we're going to be following
[03:13:16.920 --> 03:13:24.600]  that Alex Jones will be recording a Facebook's mention on on that also this
[03:13:24.600 --> 03:13:28.320]  other article about what's going on in Congress this is an article written by
[03:13:28.320 --> 03:13:34.560]  Bob Goodloday and Oren Hatch a congressman and a senator of course Oren
[03:13:34.560 --> 03:13:38.360]  Hatch was the guy who just wants to authorize use of military force without
[03:13:38.360 --> 03:13:41.600]  restriction to geography or time nevertheless they're saying how do we
[03:13:41.600 --> 03:13:46.120]  protect Americans from accidentally breaking the law well that sounds good
[03:13:46.120 --> 03:13:50.680]  doesn't it about why don't we ask this how do we protect Americans from
[03:13:50.680 --> 03:13:55.040]  bureaucracies who are intentionally breaking the law so the problem there is
[03:13:55.040 --> 03:13:59.320]  a problem of Americans who are accidentally breaking the law and then
[03:13:59.320 --> 03:14:03.760]  get hit with draconian measures they give a couple of examples a 23 year old
[03:14:03.760 --> 03:14:08.240]  man found a buried skull on a hunting trip in Alaska and he turned it over to
[03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:13.320]  the US Forest Service then he was charged by the US Forest Service with
[03:14:13.320 --> 03:14:17.240]  removing an archaeological resource from public lands similarly the parents of a
[03:14:17.240 --> 03:14:22.240]  young girl who saved a woodpecker from the family cat were fined for violating
[03:14:22.240 --> 03:14:27.480]  the migratory bird act because it's a crime to take or to transport a woodpecker
[03:14:27.480 --> 03:14:32.480]  even to save its life see that's the kind of mindless overreaction that we get
[03:14:32.480 --> 03:14:37.120]  from the bureaucracy why does that exist you might ask and that's not the
[03:14:37.120 --> 03:14:41.080]  question that this congressman and senator asking that's what I want them
[03:14:41.080 --> 03:14:48.600]  to ask I want to also ask that if they're concerned about people that are
[03:14:48.600 --> 03:14:55.240]  being charged with criminal actions find other things happening to them what
[03:14:55.240 --> 03:14:59.920]  about people who are being who are having seizure laws apply to them they're
[03:14:59.920 --> 03:15:02.960]  never even they're not found guilty they're not even charged with anything
[03:15:02.960 --> 03:15:09.280]  these people were at least charged with a bogus violation of a law but the
[03:15:09.280 --> 03:15:11.920]  government takes things from people under the war on drugs without even
[03:15:11.920 --> 03:15:16.840]  charging them they charge the the house or they charge your car or they charge
[03:15:16.840 --> 03:15:21.360]  your airplane and take your house your car or your airplane this US government
[03:15:21.360 --> 03:15:28.360]  versus Camaro 1977 Camaro whatever okay you got a classic car they take that
[03:15:28.360 --> 03:15:34.320]  this is this is the issue okay we have to be concerned about a permanently
[03:15:34.320 --> 03:15:38.840]  entrenched bureaucracy and that's when I look why when I look at what the
[03:15:38.840 --> 03:15:42.680]  National Review is talking about when they go after Trump and they spend an
[03:15:42.680 --> 03:15:48.680]  entire issue attacking Trump I have to say Trump is not the problem he's not a
[03:15:48.680 --> 03:15:53.080]  politician he's never done anything at this point now they think he's going to
[03:15:53.080 --> 03:15:57.400]  be a problem if he gets elected I understand that but why don't they
[03:15:57.400 --> 03:16:01.520]  address the problems that are systemic right now so the conservatives don't
[03:16:01.520 --> 03:16:05.200]  want to do that and it gets to the essence of why I do not call myself a
[03:16:05.200 --> 03:16:10.480]  conservative conservatives want to protect the status quo I don't care
[03:16:10.480 --> 03:16:14.920]  about the status quo I want the status quo anti if you want to stay keep it in
[03:16:14.920 --> 03:16:20.160]  Latin I want the status quo before we got to where we are now I have lived in
[03:16:20.160 --> 03:16:26.440]  an America all of my life and I'm pretty old now I've lived in America all of my
[03:16:26.440 --> 03:16:31.160]  life where we have never even tried the Constitution it's a great plan we should
[03:16:31.160 --> 03:16:37.120]  try it sometime hopefully in my lifetime but we aren't going to try it as long as
[03:16:37.120 --> 03:16:42.920]  we have the GOP establishment fighting back and and that's essentially what's
[03:16:42.920 --> 03:16:45.880]  happening there's they're striking back it's like a Darth Vader we need to cue
[03:16:45.880 --> 03:16:50.880]  the theme song for Alex here because when I saw that on National Review I go
[03:16:50.880 --> 03:16:54.200]  here they go again they want to nail this down the ground and of course they
[03:16:54.200 --> 03:16:59.800]  have political a stake in this they they are part of the establishment that's
[03:16:59.800 --> 03:17:03.040]  why they don't want the establishment to change this is an establishment media
[03:17:03.040 --> 03:17:07.720]  establishment politicians who don't want things to change think about this you
[03:17:07.720 --> 03:17:12.160]  know you you either lead follow or get out of the way they don't want to
[03:17:12.160 --> 03:17:15.560]  identify the problems and lead us out of this and when the American people
[03:17:15.560 --> 03:17:19.880]  identify the problems they won't follow us as a matter of fact they lie to us
[03:17:19.880 --> 03:17:23.560]  about what they're going to do when we say yeah hey look this is a problem we
[03:17:23.560 --> 03:17:27.280]  want to elect you to fix this yeah well we'll do that just vote for us and
[03:17:27.280 --> 03:17:31.720]  immediately they betrayed the GOP voters and so now people are saying to them
[03:17:31.720 --> 03:17:37.200]  get out of the way get out of the way you're just useless and irrelevant so
[03:17:37.200 --> 03:17:41.160]  what do they do they push back against Trump in this editorial and there's a
[03:17:41.160 --> 03:17:44.200]  lot to talk about with that I don't think we've got time to get into that I
[03:17:44.200 --> 03:17:52.000]  want to continue on with this you know this idea that somehow this is an a
[03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:55.920]  mistake that we need to correct you know that they have Americans who are
[03:17:55.920 --> 03:17:59.160]  accidentally breaking law and then this bureaucracy is coming down on them
[03:17:59.160 --> 03:18:03.040]  that's what they really need to address they say the failure of Congress to
[03:18:03.040 --> 03:18:08.480]  articulate a clear standard of criminal intention they have a Latin term men's
[03:18:08.480 --> 03:18:13.480]  rear which means guilty mind coupled with a dramatic expansion of the federal
[03:18:13.480 --> 03:18:17.160]  criminal code yeah let's talk about that dramatic expansion I reported on that a
[03:18:17.160 --> 03:18:20.360]  couple of weeks ago at the end of the year they pointed out there was over
[03:18:20.360 --> 03:18:26.640]  81,000 pages added to the federal register in one year a new record but
[03:18:26.640 --> 03:18:33.440]  for the last several years they've been adding 79,000 80,000 pages of rules every
[03:18:33.440 --> 03:18:36.480]  year these are the bureaucracies that are adding the rules and just as you saw
[03:18:36.480 --> 03:18:41.040]  a couple of days ago when we played those Park Service employees celebrating
[03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:44.720]  the fact that they take people's property and they always pay a lot less
[03:18:44.720 --> 03:18:49.320]  than it's due so we're the bad guys and they laughed about it they you know they
[03:18:49.320 --> 03:18:51.880]  didn't laugh about the fact that oh yeah they think we're bad guys but we're
[03:18:51.880 --> 03:18:56.720]  really good guys know they owned it they owned it like Darth Vader and they
[03:18:56.720 --> 03:19:00.880]  were pointing out that you know when you have a situation like this how do we
[03:19:00.880 --> 03:19:04.960]  get to a situation where the Congress says well you know the problem is we've
[03:19:04.960 --> 03:19:08.480]  had a dramatic expansion of the federal criminal code they've allowed that to
[03:19:08.480 --> 03:19:14.080]  happen people like Orrin Hatch who's been there forever stepped aside and made
[03:19:14.080 --> 03:19:19.280]  Congress a romp organization they basically do nothing except collect
[03:19:19.280 --> 03:19:25.800]  money and run for office they don't exercise their legislative duty we
[03:19:25.800 --> 03:19:30.720]  elected them so that we would not have legislation without representation
[03:19:30.720 --> 03:19:34.320]  taxation without representation and so now we've got a federal bureaucracy that
[03:19:34.320 --> 03:19:37.160]  does all that and they come back and say well you know sometimes people don't
[03:19:37.160 --> 03:19:40.760]  have criminal action and we're locking them up and taking their property well
[03:19:40.760 --> 03:19:44.560]  why don't you do something about it why don't you maybe we should have
[03:19:44.560 --> 03:19:48.480]  Congress write a law that would require Congress to write the laws instead of
[03:19:48.480 --> 03:19:51.280]  allowing the bureaucracies to do it so they can grow their empires stay with
[03:19:51.280 --> 03:19:54.040]  us we'll be right back

[03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:37.560]  store info wars life calm now as the Super Bowl is coming up in a few weeks we
[03:25:37.560 --> 03:25:41.240]  have the FAA has announced that they're going to ban drones at the Super Bowl
[03:25:41.240 --> 03:25:45.600]  maybe we kind of expect that they would do that but what is surprising is the
[03:25:45.600 --> 03:25:50.800]  fact that they would do this it's such a large radius a 37 mile radius their
[03:25:50.800 --> 03:25:55.360]  banning all flights of drones now there's an intercore of 11 and a half mile
[03:25:55.360 --> 03:25:59.320]  radius where the FAA has particularly advised you against flying so in other
[03:25:59.320 --> 03:26:03.240]  words maybe they're going to shoot it down who knows what that's going to be
[03:26:03.240 --> 03:26:07.360]  about but the point is this as popular science talks about this and points out
[03:26:07.360 --> 03:26:11.000]  what's going on with this I say the prohibition means that people miles and
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:15.960]  miles and miles away who want to simply fly their drones on a Sunday may be
[03:26:15.960 --> 03:26:20.480]  violating the law when they do they might round you up like they did the Hammons
[03:26:20.480 --> 03:26:24.120]  in Oregon when you're doing something innocuous and ordinary charge you as
[03:26:24.120 --> 03:26:29.480]  being a terrorist you think they would we've seen this over and over again we
[03:26:29.480 --> 03:26:32.800]  sent a guy being charged with multiple felony violations because they released
[03:26:32.800 --> 03:26:37.280]  balloons on a beach for his sweetheart helium balloons I said wait this is a
[03:26:37.280 --> 03:26:40.600]  protected area for some sea tortoises or something so that's a that's a felony
[03:26:40.600 --> 03:26:44.400]  for felony charges on you now you can't have a gun whatever okay now when
[03:26:44.400 --> 03:26:48.360]  they're looking at these drones maybe they ought to be concerned about their
[03:26:48.360 --> 03:26:53.000]  drones the Washington Post pointed out yesterday there was a mysterious actually
[03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:57.640]  two days ago a mysterious surge and mishaps involving the Air Force's newest
[03:26:57.640 --> 03:27:03.360]  and most advanced killer hunter killer drone the Reaper okay now these are
[03:27:03.360 --> 03:27:06.720]  they've had 20 cases this is an investigation done by the Washington
[03:27:06.720 --> 03:27:09.960]  Post because the Pentagon doesn't want to talk about this kind of stuff okay
[03:27:09.960 --> 03:27:13.680]  they want to keep this secret just like Google likes to keep their car crashes
[03:27:13.680 --> 03:27:18.200]  secret don't talk about it didn't happen it's somebody else's fault it's not our
[03:27:18.200 --> 03:27:21.200]  fault okay and maybe it is somebody else's fault in this particular case
[03:27:21.200 --> 03:27:26.240]  maybe you've got some foreign power that is hacking their drones and making them
[03:27:26.240 --> 03:27:29.840]  crash to the ground they've had 20 large Air Force drones destroyed or
[03:27:29.840 --> 03:27:34.080]  sustained at least two million dollars in damage in accidents last year the
[03:27:34.080 --> 03:27:38.760]  worst annual toll ever and of course the Pentagon has shrouded the extent of the
[03:27:38.760 --> 03:27:42.760]  problem kept details of most of the crashes a secret and here's one of the
[03:27:42.760 --> 03:27:47.240]  details that I thought was interesting about these Reaper drones these things
[03:27:47.240 --> 03:27:54.760]  are two and a half tons two and a half tons 3,000 pounds size of a car now
[03:27:54.760 --> 03:27:59.720]  think about the fact because we were just talking about how the bureaucracies
[03:27:59.720 --> 03:28:04.760]  are out of control how they're taking draconian measures against people who
[03:28:04.760 --> 03:28:09.640]  never even had a knowledge or an intent to break a law these minor laws they
[03:28:09.640 --> 03:28:14.320]  they come in they wreck your life where they send you to prison as a terrorist
[03:28:14.320 --> 03:28:18.600]  here we have a situation think about it just before Christmas we had the FAA
[03:28:18.600 --> 03:28:22.840]  coming in and saying if you do not register your half pound and up drone
[03:28:22.840 --> 03:28:27.440]  then we will find you just for not registering if we see you flying it
[03:28:27.440 --> 03:28:31.000]  outside regardless of what you do you don't have to do anything criminal if
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:34.480]  you go criminal they're going to come after you I think the penalty was three
[03:28:34.480 --> 03:28:39.280]  years and a quarter of a million dollars I think they could go up to but you're
[03:28:39.280 --> 03:28:42.840]  not doing anything criminal you're just flying it in your own backyard a half
[03:28:42.840 --> 03:28:46.280]  pound drone you didn't register it with the FAA they're going to come after you
[03:28:46.280 --> 03:28:50.640]  with a civil action which means they don't have to charge you with a crime
[03:28:50.640 --> 03:28:54.880]  and find you guilty a civil action 27 and a half thousand dollars but these
[03:28:54.880 --> 03:29:01.240]  guys are 20 large drones that are the size of a car 3,000 pounds not a half
[03:29:01.240 --> 03:29:05.840]  pound 3,000 pounds and do you think they're going to be flying those at the
[03:29:05.840 --> 03:29:11.600]  Super Bowl but they are and the other thing that I find troubling is when you
[03:29:11.600 --> 03:29:15.920]  go back and you look at these these drones and who has the drones the Bureau
[03:29:15.920 --> 03:29:20.880]  of Land Management good old BLM our favorite people there they have got a
[03:29:20.880 --> 03:29:25.200]  fleet of drones reapers and predator drones you know what they're doing
[03:29:25.200 --> 03:29:29.800]  they're not necessarily going out there to assassinate people who protest their
[03:29:29.800 --> 03:29:35.320]  theft but they are mapping out every last inch of territory because they're
[03:29:35.320 --> 03:29:47.040]  going to make it theirs stay with us we'll be right back
[03:29:47.040 --> 03:29:54.040]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[03:33:19.480 --> 03:33:22.800]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on the game of night and as we've been
[03:33:22.800 --> 03:33:27.040]  mentioning there is a report out by defense one that senate leader Mitch
[03:33:27.040 --> 03:33:31.120]  McConnell has surprised lawmakers with new isis war powers requests they point
[03:33:31.120 --> 03:33:35.440]  out this came as a snow weekend surprise his move to fast track the measure
[03:33:35.440 --> 03:33:40.040]  surprised even his top deputy senate majority whip John Cornyn who was
[03:33:40.040 --> 03:33:43.960]  unaware that McConnell had set up the authorization when asked by the National
[03:33:43.960 --> 03:33:50.040]  Journal yesterday morning Cornyn said he did he did anything about that they
[03:33:50.040 --> 03:33:53.000]  point out that this is not going to touch on the issue of what to do with the
[03:33:53.000 --> 03:33:56.880]  2001 authorization for the use of military force maybe you knew about that
[03:33:56.880 --> 03:34:01.040]  maybe you didn't we talked quite a bit about that when the NDA act talking
[03:34:01.040 --> 03:34:04.880]  about indefinite detention by the military and war zones was being put
[03:34:04.880 --> 03:34:10.680]  forth again done on a time when most people are not paying attention they
[03:34:10.680 --> 03:34:16.280]  say that was put out as a authorization to use force against those who had planned
[03:34:16.280 --> 03:34:20.080]  the 9-11 terrorist attacks but that's not the way they've been using it is it
[03:34:20.080 --> 03:34:23.160]  they've been using it for everything and of course the Obama administration has
[03:34:23.160 --> 03:34:27.120]  used it he says to attack ISIS he says I've got the authority to do that I can
[03:34:27.120 --> 03:34:31.240]  stretch it that far but it's going to be stretched even farther they're going
[03:34:31.240 --> 03:34:36.360]  to remove any ambiguity they're going to remove any limits related to time or
[03:34:36.360 --> 03:34:41.200]  geography when the president wants to use ground troops you should be very
[03:34:41.200 --> 03:34:44.200]  concerned about this you should be very concerned about the way this is being
[03:34:44.200 --> 03:34:48.080]  introduced as well I want to go back to some technology issues because I think
[03:34:48.080 --> 03:34:52.280]  this is very key we have to understand how they're coming out after us and
[03:34:52.280 --> 03:34:55.480]  as somebody who is an electrical engineer I have a degree in electrical
[03:34:55.480 --> 03:35:00.160]  electrical engineering I did it for a few years I always have been a big fan
[03:35:00.160 --> 03:35:03.040]  of technology I always thought of technology as a liberating thing
[03:35:03.040 --> 03:35:06.040]  especially the internet and it has been a liberating thing but it is also
[03:35:06.040 --> 03:35:11.280]  something that is used in other ways to track and to enslave us and we look at
[03:35:11.280 --> 03:35:15.280]  the self-driving cars when we look at the vehicle to infrastructure which is
[03:35:15.280 --> 03:35:19.080]  going to be kidding us before we have self-driving cars and is going to be
[03:35:19.080 --> 03:35:23.360]  even more of a threat to our freedom because that's going to impose a
[03:35:23.360 --> 03:35:28.160]  control grid on us you have to understand what they're about to do as we
[03:35:28.160 --> 03:35:32.000]  look at these stories we've had yet another car with self-driving add-on
[03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:36.400]  technology crashing this is a Nissan Leaf crashing in San Francisco it was
[03:35:36.400 --> 03:35:40.960]  equipped with aftermarket self-driving car technology it was crash they say
[03:35:40.960 --> 03:35:45.040]  by its human driver well what happened was the it was in autonomous driving
[03:35:45.040 --> 03:35:49.640]  mode it started drifting left and right it started weaving on the road so at
[03:35:49.640 --> 03:35:55.160]  this point he took control the car but he couldn't stop it and it struck a part
[03:35:55.160 --> 03:36:00.160]  Toyota Prius there were no injuries so you got a leaf striking a Prius only in
[03:36:00.160 --> 03:36:05.480]  San Francisco folks no muscle cars no real cars anyway sorry if you have one
[03:36:05.480 --> 03:36:09.680]  those cars but I'm not a big fan of them they say this took place in January 8th
[03:36:09.680 --> 03:36:15.200]  in downtown San Francisco and it shines a spotlight on the complex interface
[03:36:15.200 --> 03:36:18.400]  between humans and machines when it comes to driving a vehicle no you don't
[03:36:18.400 --> 03:36:22.880]  say you don't say here's what's going to happen before that though folks Forbes
[03:36:22.880 --> 03:36:26.800]  has an article about how will talking cars change our roads and they say you
[03:36:26.800 --> 03:36:29.640]  know when we look at back at things we just had the Detroit auto show it's
[03:36:29.640 --> 03:36:34.240]  still going on it ends this Sunday that's the big hit the centerpiece of the
[03:36:34.240 --> 03:36:37.880]  show that is a self-driving car and it's been that way with a lot of these
[03:36:37.880 --> 03:36:41.760]  technology shows throughout this year of this consumer electronics show the very
[03:36:41.760 --> 03:36:46.240]  beginning of the year that was the centerpiece self-driving car technology
[03:36:46.240 --> 03:36:51.080]  they say well you know they're electric they're smart but they're not talking to
[03:36:51.080 --> 03:36:55.080]  other stuff so it's the connectivity that they're focusing on making the car
[03:36:55.080 --> 03:36:59.640]  part of the internet of things and so one of the examples they have here is
[03:36:59.640 --> 03:37:03.960]  like well gee you know Ford just introduced a new feature so that you can
[03:37:03.960 --> 03:37:07.840]  control your home thermostat from your steering wheel it's like really is that
[03:37:07.840 --> 03:37:11.840]  something you're asking for I'm gonna drive behind people in Austin all the
[03:37:11.840 --> 03:37:15.080]  time and I honestly think they might be trying to do that because they certainly
[03:37:15.080 --> 03:37:18.720]  aren't paying attention to what they're doing on the road okay we don't need that
[03:37:18.720 --> 03:37:22.440]  kind of distraction in our car to control your thermostat just wait till you
[03:37:22.440 --> 03:37:26.360]  get somewhere you can find some gadget to do that with your phone when you're
[03:37:26.360 --> 03:37:29.680]  not driving but they want to make it part of the internet of things what does
[03:37:29.680 --> 03:37:35.120]  this mean well think about the fact that in this article they point out in a G
[03:37:35.120 --> 03:37:39.120]  whiz kind of way they say well you know we'll be able to identify what's
[03:37:39.120 --> 03:37:43.720]  happening with the weather because if we notice that dozens of cars are turning
[03:37:43.720 --> 03:37:47.800]  on their windshield wipers that'll be transmitted back to the government's
[03:37:47.800 --> 03:37:51.640]  weather service and they'll know that's raining there that'll be better than
[03:37:51.640 --> 03:37:56.240]  satellites remember a couple of days ago we had the a kid Daniels article about
[03:37:56.240 --> 03:37:59.480]  how Davos they were saying you know self-driving cars are going to give us
[03:37:59.480 --> 03:38:03.360]  more intelligence than drones and satellites that's the kind of granularity
[03:38:03.360 --> 03:38:07.520]  they're talking about they're going to be monitoring everything you do in your
[03:38:07.520 --> 03:38:11.520]  car even turning on your windshield wiper and reporting that to the government
[03:38:11.520 --> 03:38:16.840]  that's what they mean by vehicle to infrastructure when you drive down the
[03:38:16.840 --> 03:38:22.480]  road your car is constantly going to be talking to the stoplights to the weather
[03:38:22.480 --> 03:38:25.680]  service about what you're doing with your car everything that you do is going
[03:38:25.680 --> 03:38:29.000]  to be micromanaged the insurance companies are going to be looking at how
[03:38:29.000 --> 03:38:32.680]  fast you're going every into the course the police will as well and they're
[03:38:32.680 --> 03:38:36.560]  going to use insurance and tickets to drive you out of the car you won't be
[03:38:36.560 --> 03:38:41.000]  able to do it because they're going to micromanage and monitor everything you
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:45.440]  do like the perpetual nanny in yours and I think what we need to seriously do
[03:38:45.440 --> 03:38:51.000]  is we need to invoke the Third Amendment and say I don't want you in my car I
[03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:55.000]  don't want you in my house I don't want you in my computer I don't want to pay
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:38:58.920]  to feed you bandwidth so you can spy on me because I have to pay for the bandwidth
[03:38:58.920 --> 03:39:03.480]  at home on my computer but I've got the government living in my computer living
[03:39:03.480 --> 03:39:08.160]  in my home we need to use the Third Amendment perhaps and say in this
[03:39:08.160 --> 03:39:13.560]  cyberspace we're not going to allow government police to live and feed off
[03:39:13.560 --> 03:39:18.880]  of us maybe this is the point at which we need to do this but as one of these
[03:39:18.880 --> 03:39:21.920]  people who's selling the technology of course this is going to be something they
[03:39:21.920 --> 03:39:25.960]  project by 2020 that's only four years away folks they're going to make these
[03:39:25.960 --> 03:39:29.680]  mandates for vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure they're
[03:39:29.680 --> 03:39:35.000]  going to make these mandates this year and four years expect it to be a 46
[03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:39.640]  billion dollar industry those are mandates that are going to be put on
[03:39:39.640 --> 03:39:43.520]  your car and you're going to be paying for that they're going to be making a
[03:39:43.520 --> 03:39:46.720]  profit off of these mandates that's why Detroit is pushing it that's why they're
[03:39:46.720 --> 03:39:50.160]  so excited about it it's a new profit center for them and of course the
[03:39:50.160 --> 03:39:55.240]  government wants to make your car go away they want you if you're in a vehicle
[03:39:55.240 --> 03:39:59.240]  they want it to be mass transit that they control they want to track and tax
[03:39:59.240 --> 03:40:02.760]  you with everything they do and as one of these guys talks about it he says as
[03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:08.160]  the technology spreads equipped cars will become probes that's his term not
[03:40:08.160 --> 03:40:14.640]  mine they'll become probes gathering and sharing data about you say when we see
[03:40:14.640 --> 03:40:21.400]  the technology being used we need to back off and say is this really what I
[03:40:21.400 --> 03:40:26.040]  want and when we see Obama talking about smart guns I want you to think about
[03:40:26.040 --> 03:40:29.520]  what's really involved with the technology so I'll put together this
[03:40:29.520 --> 03:40:32.400]  report about smart guns we ran a couple of nights ago on the nightly news we
[03:40:32.400 --> 03:40:35.720]  haven't played on the radio yet I want to play that report now about smart guns
[03:40:35.720 --> 03:40:39.840]  and what's really up with that at the Consumer Electronics Show which just
[03:40:39.840 --> 03:40:43.840]  ended in Las Vegas a vendor wanted to demonstrate his smart gun law saying it
[03:40:43.840 --> 03:40:48.600]  answers President Obama's call for a smart gun but the Consumer Electronics
[03:40:48.600 --> 03:40:53.000]  Show wouldn't allow him to bring an unloaded gun into the show not even an
[03:40:53.000 --> 03:40:58.800]  imitation gun not even for Obama and there's an important lesson in that they
[03:40:58.800 --> 03:41:03.560]  really don't want better tech they just want to get rid of guns out of fear and
[03:41:03.560 --> 03:41:09.280]  ignorance we're gonna look at why smart guns are a dumb idea but first consider
[03:41:09.280 --> 03:41:13.080]  the gun expert the Obama administration has enlisted as a smart gun
[03:41:13.080 --> 03:41:17.000]  salesman you know the single most console you do have no impact in the
[03:41:17.000 --> 03:41:22.040]  Second Amendment by a smart gun remember the last time Biden gave us gun advice
[03:41:22.040 --> 03:41:27.920]  she's asking if a ban goes into effect on certain kinds of weapons and high
[03:41:27.920 --> 03:41:32.960]  capacity magazines and what's your name Kate Kate if you want to protect
[03:41:32.960 --> 03:41:42.400]  yourself get a double barrel shotgun and I promise you as I told my wife we live
[03:41:42.400 --> 03:41:48.520]  in an area that's wooded and so much so Jill if there's ever a problem just walk
[03:41:48.520 --> 03:41:54.440]  out on the balcony here walk out put that double barrel shotgun and fire to
[03:41:54.440 --> 03:42:05.840]  blast you don't need an AR-15 it's harder to aim it's harder to use and in fact
[03:42:05.840 --> 03:42:12.760]  you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself by shotgun by shotgun by a
[03:42:12.760 --> 03:42:18.880]  smart gun now he's back with more idiotic advice how does that make sense
[03:42:18.880 --> 03:42:23.760]  what what possible senses that make to help push the idea of smart guns
[03:42:23.760 --> 03:42:29.640]  mainstream media from Fox News to CNN turns to James Bond as an example of the
[03:42:29.640 --> 03:42:36.160]  PPKS 9 millimeter short there's a micro-dermal sensor in the grip it's been
[03:42:36.160 --> 03:42:40.280]  coded to your palm prints only you can fire it while having a gun that only
[03:42:40.280 --> 03:42:45.360]  authorized users can fire might sound like a great idea Bond has lots of gadgets
[03:42:45.360 --> 03:42:49.680]  that in the real world would be impractical and prohibitively expensive
[03:42:49.680 --> 03:42:54.840]  to build but Obama says the tech hurdles can be overcome if you are a gun
[03:42:54.840 --> 03:42:59.160]  owner I would think that you would at least want a choice they don't want to
[03:42:59.160 --> 03:43:03.120]  be in a situation where oh no someone's coming through my front door I've got
[03:43:03.120 --> 03:43:08.400]  to reboot my gun it's the reliability stupid adding biometric or RFID sensors
[03:43:08.400 --> 03:43:13.600]  to a gun means adding multiple layers of new complicated technology that can go
[03:43:13.600 --> 03:43:18.680]  wrong the blinking red LED light means that you have 33-person battery life
[03:43:18.680 --> 03:43:22.120]  left and you must change the batteries there weren't batteries that were small
[03:43:22.120 --> 03:43:26.200]  enough there weren't chips that were were reliable enough there wasn't
[03:43:26.200 --> 03:43:30.920]  biometric technology that was good enough to recognize fingerprint IDs guns
[03:43:30.920 --> 03:43:35.480]  are finally honed mechanical devices they're rugged they can withstand rough
[03:43:35.480 --> 03:43:40.360]  use smart guns will add electronics that can fail can break that will need a
[03:43:40.360 --> 03:43:44.680]  charged power source and most importantly they can be disabled by
[03:43:44.680 --> 03:43:48.320]  criminals or governments this vulnerability and others will come from
[03:43:48.320 --> 03:43:52.000]  the software which will also have bugs that will get worse with software
[03:43:52.000 --> 03:43:56.960]  updates just like your phone and there are other concerns any wireless
[03:43:56.960 --> 03:44:01.360]  coupling can decouple it can have interference or it can be hacked and
[03:44:01.360 --> 03:44:05.440]  will you grip a biometric handle in the same way when you're under stress or
[03:44:05.440 --> 03:44:10.600]  under combat so far there's only been one attempt at a smart gun the IP one
[03:44:10.600 --> 03:44:14.600]  from the German manufacturer Armitix the gun is implanted with an electronic
[03:44:14.600 --> 03:44:19.040]  chip that allows it to be fired only if the shooter is wearing a companion watch
[03:44:19.040 --> 03:44:23.960]  into which a pin number has been entered it was only offered in a 22 caliber but
[03:44:23.960 --> 03:44:30.280]  it cost $1800 five times the cost of other 22s and not offered in a self
[03:44:30.280 --> 03:44:33.920]  defense caliber but it had other problems it took seven push button commands
[03:44:33.920 --> 03:44:38.720]  and 12 seconds before it could be fired and it had three or four misfires per
[03:44:38.720 --> 03:44:44.600]  11 round magazine repeatedly so it's not good it's not fast it's not cheap and
[03:44:44.600 --> 03:44:49.280]  it's laughably unreliable not even the gun grabbers in New Jersey could call
[03:44:49.280 --> 03:44:53.240]  it smart with a straight face and that's important because New Jersey has
[03:44:53.240 --> 03:44:58.160]  passed a law that once a smart gun exists in the market only smart guns
[03:44:58.160 --> 03:45:02.760]  will be allowed to be sold in New Jersey this is why gun users threatened a
[03:45:02.760 --> 03:45:06.400]  boycott of manufacturers like Smith and Wesson when they announced plans to
[03:45:06.400 --> 03:45:10.400]  work on a smart gun I don't exactly understand this and maybe there'll be
[03:45:10.400 --> 03:45:18.320]  somebody in the audience who explains it to me back in 1997 the CEO of Colt said
[03:45:18.320 --> 03:45:23.720]  you know we can design or starting to develop guns where you can only use it
[03:45:23.720 --> 03:45:29.920]  if you've got a chip a boycott was called against them and and they had to
[03:45:29.920 --> 03:45:36.080]  back off of developing that technology the same was Smith and Wesson Smith and
[03:45:36.080 --> 03:45:40.120]  Wesson responded to the boycott by canceling smart gun research and firing
[03:45:40.120 --> 03:45:45.600]  the CEO that proposed it so users are not asking for smart guns as a matter of
[03:45:45.600 --> 03:45:50.520]  fact they strongly don't want them so what does Obama do he will use his
[03:45:50.520 --> 03:45:55.320]  unlimited Federal reserves to build one and shove it down our throats
[03:45:55.320 --> 03:46:00.080]  Obama likes to compare smart guns to cell phones I didn't bring my cell phone
[03:46:00.080 --> 03:46:04.960]  with me but my cell phone like yours I just put my thumb print on well why
[03:46:04.960 --> 03:46:08.720]  can't you do that for a gun the cell phone analogy goes beyond biometric
[03:46:08.720 --> 03:46:12.480]  locks the government has the capability to shut down all cell phones in an area
[03:46:12.480 --> 03:46:15.840]  or selectively turn off their cameras although they haven't used that
[03:46:15.840 --> 03:46:20.040]  capability yet and they want the ability to track and disable your gun
[03:46:20.040 --> 03:46:25.360]  even if it still works with all the added technology bells and whistles if
[03:46:25.360 --> 03:46:31.040]  there's an app that can help us find a missing tablet if we can do it for your
[03:46:31.040 --> 03:46:35.280]  iPad there's no reason we can't do it with a stolen gun here's the bottom line
[03:46:35.280 --> 03:46:39.560]  if you let someone get close enough to take your gun away you're not doing it
[03:46:39.560 --> 03:46:44.440]  right if you let children get access to your guns you're not doing it right we
[03:46:44.440 --> 03:46:48.960]  need smart people who control their guns not smart guns controlled by
[03:46:48.960 --> 03:46:53.880]  government we need better training and education not unaffordable unreliable
[03:46:53.880 --> 03:46:58.760]  weapons that can be disabled by the government for info wars calm I'm David
[03:46:58.760 --> 03:47:05.720]  Knight alright again you can see that at the Alex Jones YouTube channel I want
[03:47:05.720 --> 03:47:09.800]  to tell you that we've got a special that is ending today a survival shield
[03:47:09.800 --> 03:47:14.840]  x2 supermail vitality both of those are available at 15% off today is the very
[03:47:14.840 --> 03:47:19.640]  last day of that sale you can find that at info wars calm and as you're looking
[03:47:19.640 --> 03:47:25.400]  at snowmageddon going across Washington consider the fact that you never really
[03:47:25.400 --> 03:47:29.760]  know when catastrophe is going to strike you need to be prepared you need to
[03:47:29.760 --> 03:47:33.240]  stock up in advance that's what we've been telling people along look at the
[03:47:33.240 --> 03:47:37.160]  products that we have at info wars select make sure that you've got at least
[03:47:37.160 --> 03:47:40.840]  food on your shelf because right now for the people in Washington if they didn't
[03:47:40.840 --> 03:47:45.560]  prepare in advance they're not going to get any food off of the store shelves
[03:47:45.560 --> 03:47:50.240]  they can't even get to the store and as I mentioned yesterday I ran into that
[03:47:50.240 --> 03:47:53.840]  same situation in Buffalo New York of all places it was a snowstorm and you
[03:47:53.840 --> 03:47:57.360]  would think people in Buffalo New York we have some of the heaviest snow anywhere
[03:47:57.360 --> 03:48:01.160]  in the country they would be prepared for but back in 2000 round Thanksgiving we
[03:48:01.160 --> 03:48:07.240]  were going through there and the snow fell in a record it wasn't a record
[03:48:07.240 --> 03:48:11.200]  snowfall but it was the most snow that had in a 24-hour period it fell so
[03:48:11.200 --> 03:48:15.840]  quickly that people got trapped on the street most of the people there are
[03:48:15.840 --> 03:48:18.960]  assuming that the government is going to keep the roads cleared for them and
[03:48:18.960 --> 03:48:22.360]  they don't have to worry about providing for themselves a four-wheel drive most of
[03:48:22.360 --> 03:48:26.680]  them had little tiny cars we were heading north I had a an SUV that could go
[03:48:26.680 --> 03:48:29.320]  through the snow because I was expecting to see that they were expecting
[03:48:29.320 --> 03:48:32.520]  however that the government was going to take care of them many of them got
[03:48:32.520 --> 03:48:37.080]  their cars stranded just like they did in Washington with one inch of snow some
[03:48:37.080 --> 03:48:39.920]  of the people in Washington after sitting for five hours with nothing
[03:48:39.920 --> 03:48:43.760]  moving and presumably what happened was people had wrecks and then other people
[03:48:43.760 --> 03:48:46.360]  got tired of sitting there in their car and after five hours to just turn the
[03:48:46.360 --> 03:48:50.320]  car off and walked that was the kind of thing we were seeing in Buffalo and the
[03:48:50.320 --> 03:48:54.720]  people in Buffalo were stranded for days in retail areas many of them because
[03:48:54.720 --> 03:48:59.440]  they were relying on government to provide protection for them to keep the
[03:48:59.440 --> 03:49:04.840]  roads cleared and even in Buffalo you can't always count on the government to
[03:49:04.840 --> 03:49:09.280]  keep the roads clear of snow you have unexpected situations that arise I mean
[03:49:09.280 --> 03:49:12.600]  it wasn't that they were doing a bad job of clearing the snow but they couldn't
[03:49:12.600 --> 03:49:16.320]  clear the snow at that point because you had all these parked cars all over the
[03:49:16.320 --> 03:49:18.960]  place they couldn't get the snow plows so that's what made it last for so long
[03:49:18.960 --> 03:49:24.120]  so bottom line make sure you have taken efforts to protect yourself to store up
[03:49:24.120 --> 03:49:27.360]  the essentials that you need one of the things that you need our is food and

[03:49:41.960 --> 03:49:46.200]  the short amount of time that we've got left I want to quickly talk about what's
[03:49:46.200 --> 03:49:50.440]  going on with national review one of the things that really concerned me about
[03:49:50.440 --> 03:49:57.600]  this is that when they get so concerned about one candidate and the presidential
[03:49:57.600 --> 03:50:01.880]  race that they will devote an entire issue to trying to take him down do you
[03:50:01.880 --> 03:50:05.680]  realize what's going on here it's something it's a trap that we all fall
[03:50:05.680 --> 03:50:09.920]  into but it's especially true of people who were highly partisan and the
[03:50:09.920 --> 03:50:13.640]  Republican and Democrat parties highly partisan conservatives and liberals
[03:50:13.640 --> 03:50:20.360]  who put so much stay at stake on the party itself it's the cult of the
[03:50:20.360 --> 03:50:24.280]  omnipotent president that they're really trying to sell you here they want to
[03:50:24.280 --> 03:50:27.920]  tell you that all the problems that we have in America are because Barack Obama
[03:50:27.920 --> 03:50:32.480]  is in power and that if we get the right guy in office everything will be solved
[03:50:32.480 --> 03:50:36.080]  no the problems are very systemic as I was pointing out the problems of the
[03:50:36.080 --> 03:50:39.800]  bureaucracy earlier think about the bureaucracy it's not just the Supreme
[03:50:39.800 --> 03:50:44.000]  Court that has a lifetime appointment it's these bureaucrats it basically takes
[03:50:44.000 --> 03:50:47.880]  an act to Congress to fire any of them and when they distract you about what
[03:50:47.880 --> 03:50:51.280]  you can do at the local level that's what's really dangerous stay with us
[03:50:51.280 --> 03:50:55.080]  we're gonna be right back with a report by Rex Jones about what it's like to grow

[03:53:55.000 --> 03:54:02.400]  clothing calm recently I saw a video of 10 year old Vendella Payne was given a
[03:54:02.400 --> 03:54:05.800]  repetitive full-body pat down which scared the girl and disgusted her father
[03:54:05.800 --> 03:54:09.600]  her father taped the incident and later posted the video on YouTube as he was
[03:54:09.600 --> 03:54:12.680]  outraged by the egregious and overreaching government behavior the
[03:54:12.680 --> 03:54:16.240]  TSA claims that the pat down was necessary when they noticed the threatening
[03:54:16.240 --> 03:54:19.880]  juice box that she had in her backpack she was patted down multiple times to
[03:54:19.880 --> 03:54:22.680]  make sure that her and her threatening juice box were not terrorists
[03:54:22.680 --> 03:54:27.000]  sympathizers meanwhile the TSA was allowing thousands of legal immigrants
[03:54:27.000 --> 03:54:31.240]  to fly from Mexico without a travel visa or passport here's what the judicial
[03:54:31.240 --> 03:54:36.160]  watch said about these incidents in July of 2014 to ease the load the Obama
[03:54:36.160 --> 03:54:40.680]  administration is transferring to uac's more than 53,000 by the government's
[03:54:40.680 --> 03:54:44.920]  count to other parts of the country including Florida Nebraska and Massachusetts
[03:54:44.920 --> 03:54:48.280]  apparently a large number of uac's are being transported to their new
[03:54:48.280 --> 03:54:52.680]  destination on airplanes most don't have a valid identification and are being
[03:54:52.680 --> 03:54:56.160]  allowed to board aircrafts with just a slip of paper and on top of that we have
[03:54:56.160 --> 03:54:59.760]  hundreds of thousands of Middle Eastern refugees seeking asylum in the US and
[03:54:59.760 --> 03:55:04.400]  all the heads of the FBI National Counterterrorism Organization and Homeland
[03:55:04.400 --> 03:55:07.960]  Security have all admitted under oath that their agencies do not have the
[03:55:07.960 --> 03:55:13.240]  capability to properly vet the refugees we don't have the systems in place on
[03:55:13.240 --> 03:55:19.880]  the ground to collect the information to that that would be the concern yes I
[03:55:19.880 --> 03:55:23.880]  think that's the challenge we're all talking about is that we can only query
[03:55:23.880 --> 03:55:28.040]  against that which we have collected you can't account for what you don't know
[03:55:28.040 --> 03:55:32.240]  and that goes to the intelligence deficit that I think is embedded in your
[03:55:32.240 --> 03:55:37.640]  question we may have somebody who comes to us and is simply not on our radar for
[03:55:37.640 --> 03:55:42.320]  any discernible reason and there may also be the possibility that somebody
[03:55:42.320 --> 03:55:46.640]  decides to do something bad after they've been admitted through the process
[03:55:46.640 --> 03:55:51.280]  even the nation of Islam leader Lewis Farrakhan agrees with Donald Trump's
[03:55:51.280 --> 03:55:55.440]  statement are not taking Muslims into the US until a proper vetting process is
[03:55:55.440 --> 03:56:00.200]  established Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of
[03:56:00.200 --> 03:56:07.200]  Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can
[03:56:07.200 --> 03:56:16.920]  figure out what the hell is going on so when Mr. Trump said we can't allow
[03:56:16.920 --> 03:56:26.680]  these Muslims refugees into America now a lot of people were upset with him but
[03:56:26.680 --> 03:56:36.760]  I know sir that the hatred for America in the Muslim world so in this way Mr.
[03:56:36.760 --> 03:56:47.840]  Trump I think is wise to vet anyone coming from that area into America
[03:56:47.840 --> 03:56:55.080]  because of the hatred for America is in the streets now finally our southern
[03:56:55.080 --> 03:56:58.640]  border is wide open for people and illegal drugs to pour into this country
[03:56:58.640 --> 03:57:02.280]  info or reporters have documented that our border patrol is busing illegals
[03:57:02.280 --> 03:57:06.120]  across the country and border ranchers have found Muslim prayer rugs English
[03:57:06.120 --> 03:57:09.960]  to Arabic dictionaries and even Middle Eastern money which proves that we are
[03:57:09.960 --> 03:57:14.080]  under an invasion of epic proportions going back to the TSA they want to end
[03:57:14.080 --> 03:57:17.200]  the process of opting out of naked body scanners and they're finally
[03:57:17.200 --> 03:57:21.000]  implementing the national ID card to fly which will make the driver's license
[03:57:21.000 --> 03:57:25.400]  of some states not a valid ID to board a plane our country is literally locking
[03:57:25.400 --> 03:57:29.240]  all the internal doors while leaving the outside doors wide open to and
[03:57:29.240 --> 03:57:32.360]  practically inviting terrorists to come in and wreak havoc on our great country
[03:57:32.360 --> 03:57:36.520]  and what is this going to people my age who've always known the TSA to crony in
[03:57:36.520 --> 03:57:39.800]  fourth amendment violating practices we think this type of international
[03:57:39.800 --> 03:57:43.680]  checkpoint behavior is normal and to be expected at every large event our roads
[03:57:43.680 --> 03:57:47.840]  bus stations trade stations and airports are becoming East German Stasi
[03:57:47.840 --> 03:57:51.200]  prison staging centers this is not the country that our founding fathers
[03:57:51.200 --> 03:57:55.400]  envisioned and I will tell you with three quotes proving this when the people
[03:57:55.400 --> 03:57:58.960]  fear the government there's tyranny and when the government fears the people
[03:57:58.960 --> 03:58:02.960]  there's liberty Thomas Jefferson any society that would give up a little
[03:58:02.960 --> 03:58:06.920]  liberty to gain a little security would deserve neither and lose both Ben
[03:58:06.920 --> 03:58:11.680]  Franklin make yourself cheap and the wolves will eat you Benjamin Franklin
[03:58:11.680 --> 03:58:15.720]  we need to go back to what our founding fathers envisioned before the TSA
