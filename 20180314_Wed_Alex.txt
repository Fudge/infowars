[00:00.000 --> 00:13.480]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:13.480 --> 00:26.120]  Alright, I'm going to have to be very, very disciplined today to cover all this news because
[00:26.120 --> 00:31.440]  I've got to get into the geopolitical news, the huge financial news, the military news.
[00:31.440 --> 00:37.200]  But at the center of all this, on this Wednesday, the 14th day, hard to believe, ladies and
[00:37.200 --> 00:44.640]  gentlemen, of March 2018, we are at the center of the news.
[00:44.640 --> 00:52.320]  There is a concerted public rollout worldwide from Communist China to Western Europe to
[00:52.320 --> 01:01.920]  the United States, from Canada to the UK, from South Africa to Paris, France, from
[01:01.920 --> 01:09.520]  Stockholm, Sweden to Berlin, Germany, to end nationalist, conservative, Christian, libertarian
[01:09.520 --> 01:11.760]  speech.
[01:11.760 --> 01:15.960]  People that are worried about radical Islam.
[01:15.960 --> 01:17.840]  It's all being banned.
[01:17.840 --> 01:22.400]  And I've got to the con two days ago at Austin saying to it, the Islamist mayor, I've got
[01:22.400 --> 01:27.200]  the head of YouTube here in Austin calling for banning free speech and placing their
[01:27.200 --> 01:32.400]  videos and info over us and, I mean, Google says Jesus didn't exist.
[01:32.400 --> 01:35.280]  Apples taken Easter off their calendar.
[01:35.280 --> 01:37.240]  And even Melania Trump's being sucked into it.
[01:37.240 --> 01:38.240]  This is really bad news.
[01:38.240 --> 01:44.480]  Melania Trump getting into social media companies to discuss cyberbullying, then they say, you
[01:44.480 --> 01:48.120]  hurt anybody's feelings by disagreeing with them or pointing out their Democratic Party
[01:48.120 --> 01:51.920]  operative at any tragic event, spinning things.
[01:51.920 --> 01:54.000]  Well, then you get sued.
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.520]  It doesn't even matter the lawsuits fraudulent because it's the PR they want.
[02:00.520 --> 02:05.560]  So this is the big push that Hillary was already planning once she got in.
[02:05.560 --> 02:09.560]  They're just going ahead with it and it is unbelievable.
[02:09.560 --> 02:15.640]  I spent about four hours yesterday on the phone with different lawyers who have read
[02:15.640 --> 02:22.600]  the 70 page lawsuit filed by Georgetown University with taxpayer money, the clinic's taxpayer
[02:22.600 --> 02:23.600]  funded.
[02:23.600 --> 02:30.160]  And you have these professors that sued me, defaming me all over the news, just having
[02:30.160 --> 02:35.680]  a big temper tantrum, lying about me saying things I never said, which isn't in the lawsuit.
[02:35.680 --> 02:43.280]  So it's out in the public area and we're getting the trigger ready on the final letter to Tom
[02:43.280 --> 02:44.280]  Brokaw.
[02:44.280 --> 02:48.400]  I guess I got to sue him for calling me a total racist with no proof because it doesn't
[02:48.400 --> 02:49.440]  matter if I'm a public figure.
[02:49.440 --> 02:52.600]  That is defamation on his face.
[02:52.600 --> 02:56.280]  And I'm getting ready to send the final letters to Pepe the Frog creator and everything else.
[02:56.280 --> 02:58.400]  And I've just got a fight for the First Amendment.
[02:58.400 --> 03:01.280]  I'm going to sue all these people.
[03:01.280 --> 03:07.720]  And it's just incredible how they go, oh, we're for free speech, we just want Alex Jones
[03:07.720 --> 03:09.520]  taken off the air.
[03:09.520 --> 03:12.720]  Back here are some of the headlines.
[03:12.720 --> 03:16.880]  YouTube Wikipedia conspiracy theory crackdown isn't enough, fortune, they just call for
[03:16.880 --> 03:20.640]  M4s and Alex Jones to be banned and they lie about what I've said.
[03:20.640 --> 03:27.200]  EU, more censorship to quote protect you, Yonker announces, Seth Rich's parents through
[03:27.200 --> 03:32.480]  Fox News for investigating his death, I'm not kidding, talked to lawyers about that
[03:32.480 --> 03:33.480]  this morning.
[03:33.480 --> 03:39.360]  They said it's just completely, the mother poor lady says, oh, after he died, I'm stressed
[03:39.360 --> 03:40.360]  out and can't work.
[03:40.360 --> 03:44.480]  And after media coverage, okay, but Fox Fox News didn't shoot your son and I'm sorry he's
[03:44.480 --> 03:49.800]  dead, but talking to lawyers in DC and others, they said, they always catch these random
[03:49.800 --> 03:54.440]  shootings or muggings except this time and nothing was taken and you got Debbie Wasserman
[03:54.440 --> 03:58.280]  and Solz that had the Democratic Party threatening the police about other laptops that got left
[03:58.280 --> 04:02.440]  showing Pakistani infiltration and you've got the former head of the NSA who's examined
[04:02.440 --> 04:09.400]  the files of the WikiLeaks information and it was downloaded at point blank range.
[04:09.400 --> 04:12.360]  It wasn't transferred over the internet.
[04:12.360 --> 04:17.720]  So it's totally normal to question, but they say, oh, no, it's a conspiracy theory.
[04:17.720 --> 04:24.040]  The Democratic Party came in and they had one of their top crisis operatives, not crisis
[04:24.040 --> 04:29.320]  factor, crisis managers, the Democratic Party come in to the family the week after, take
[04:29.320 --> 04:34.480]  control of the whole thing and now you question Seth Rich, you get sued.
[04:34.480 --> 04:37.960]  I mean, that's what's happening to us and so much of the media is going along with it.
[04:37.960 --> 04:42.040]  You better understand the Democrats say in this lawsuit against me that they want to
[04:42.040 --> 04:47.280]  create case law to overturn the Supreme Court on the First Amendment and allow them to prohibit
[04:47.280 --> 04:51.640]  the speech of anybody they want and basically ban investigative journalism.
[04:51.640 --> 04:55.440]  The lawyers I've talked to, they're top folks, they say this is one of the most historic
[04:55.440 --> 04:56.440]  cases ever.
[04:56.440 --> 05:00.920]  This is the end of the First Amendment.
[05:00.920 --> 05:01.920]  I'm so excited.
[05:01.920 --> 05:07.360]  The new product at infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to
[05:07.360 --> 05:12.040]  the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[05:12.040 --> 05:17.520]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[05:17.520 --> 05:20.520]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[05:20.520 --> 05:26.840]  Now, frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but
[05:26.840 --> 05:33.480]  it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae and I came
[05:33.480 --> 05:38.200]  up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made
[05:38.200 --> 05:44.040]  right here in America, 120 capsules and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglonone to
[05:44.040 --> 05:49.280]  it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[05:49.280 --> 05:53.760]  hormones in your glands, it is amazing.
[05:53.760 --> 06:15.960]  Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[06:15.960 --> 06:32.840]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance,

[32:59.920 --> 33:21.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:21.440 --> 33:51.200]  Coming up when I start the next hour, Scott Adams is joining us, Kevin McGinnis is joining
[33:51.200 --> 33:56.520]  us, Steve Pacenna is joining us with all his inside intel, I want to get Zach by the way
[33:56.520 --> 34:05.160]  on the next few days we can, one of our other great intel sources, old Zach from, old Zach
[34:05.160 --> 34:11.720]  from Cape Canaveral folks, I was, I'm not going to say what agency he's in, I was about
[34:11.720 --> 34:17.800]  to, I don't think he even minds but I'm not going to say it, I'm going to reveal at the
[34:17.800 --> 34:24.240]  start of the next hour the type of bomb that has been used three times in Austin causing
[34:24.240 --> 34:30.920]  one fatality and other serious injuries, two bombings on Monday, one bombing a week before
[34:30.920 --> 34:38.280]  during South by Southwest, two black families, one Hispanic family hit, some are saying it's
[34:38.280 --> 34:42.080]  racially motivated, some say it could be a false flag, you know a lot of the leftists
[34:42.080 --> 34:45.960]  attacked themselves, I'm not saying that's what it is but that happens a lot, you see
[34:45.960 --> 34:49.800]  all the cases where, you know the Air Force Academy, somebody's writing the N word everywhere
[34:49.800 --> 34:56.440]  on vending machines and it turns out it's a black cadet, or it could be anti-fud gentrification
[34:56.440 --> 35:06.800]  folks protesting, or it could be just a mentally ill person, it could be a teenager who's been
[35:06.800 --> 35:10.920]  radicalized and I think it could be a white supremacist, I mean I'm not saying that's
[35:10.920 --> 35:16.600]  what it is but I think that's now 30, 40% chance from what I know from law enforcement
[35:16.600 --> 35:26.240]  and I was told this information this morning from the source and it's an impeccable direct
[35:26.240 --> 35:40.600]  source and I wrote down notes then of course I left them at my house, so much is happening
[35:40.600 --> 35:46.760]  and so I'm going to go back over the notes which I'm going to get brought back to me
[35:46.760 --> 35:52.440]  and then I'm going to check with one of the other folks that I related to with their military
[35:52.440 --> 35:56.640]  and ordinance background to make sure the article that Adon Sattles are and I put out
[35:56.640 --> 35:59.840]  is accurate, so that's why I'm waiting to go to this because there's just so much going
[35:59.840 --> 36:06.920]  on, I was given bombshell info, pun intended, on the bombing and I mean it's the exclusive,
[36:06.920 --> 36:13.160]  it's the exclusive and it's again I'm not a munitions person so I understand a little
[36:13.160 --> 36:17.680]  bit about compression and things like that but I want to get the exact type of bomb right
[36:17.680 --> 36:25.400]  and I want to make sure that I relay it all properly but it is a very primitive bomb but
[36:25.400 --> 36:32.920]  it's also a very deadly bomb and again it's triggered by you opening it by the pressure
[36:32.920 --> 36:45.480]  of the I guess compounds then being mixed together and again the reason we're being
[36:45.480 --> 36:56.240]  given the information is so that well it's many things because folks know we're a credible
[36:56.240 --> 37:04.320]  news source we'll put it out, also the main reason is a lot of the folks on the ground
[37:04.320 --> 37:10.040]  and surrounding them right above them think that you need to tell the public what this
[37:10.040 --> 37:16.400]  bomb looks like and so you understand, everybody's focusing on packages and mail and they keep
[37:16.400 --> 37:21.720]  saying check all your mail, check all this, that's not what it is, you go out there and
[37:21.720 --> 37:31.800]  you're hmm what's in this crock pot basically take the lid off and blows you up so that's
[37:31.800 --> 37:37.240]  what's going on and you'll see that when it comes out the type of bomb that will be it
[37:37.240 --> 37:45.960]  because we don't make up sources.
[37:45.960 --> 37:52.240]  Business Stephen Hawking died at the age of 76, I think with the disease he had he made
[37:52.240 --> 37:57.240]  me the longest living person with that, renowned British scientist Stephen Hawking known for
[37:57.240 --> 38:01.760]  his breakthrough ideas in theoretical physics and space research has died at age 76 his
[38:01.760 --> 38:09.320]  family says and I'm not lessening Hawking's but so many of his theories were theories
[38:09.320 --> 38:16.600]  that had been put out by German and other theoretical physicists and quantum mechanics physicists
[38:16.600 --> 38:22.600]  50 years before, 60 years before and he was more like a pop character though interesting
[38:22.600 --> 38:29.160]  and then he said his earlier theories were wrong and things like that but the reason
[38:29.160 --> 38:35.400]  there's so many different energy systems they now know in physics and dark matter is way
[38:35.400 --> 38:40.960]  more energetic and powerful we just can't see it that's not been proven they've got
[38:40.960 --> 38:46.480]  all these different radio telescopes and giant magtometers and I'm not an engineer I just
[38:46.480 --> 38:52.160]  read about it I thought it fascinating and they're just like they basically see like
[38:52.160 --> 38:57.840]  scaffolding and structure just like the ancients would sit there and think stars that were
[38:57.840 --> 39:01.240]  you know thousands of light years apart were actually lined up and made the shapes of things
[39:01.240 --> 39:06.880]  but what's weird is there actually is interconnectivity and and and and it totally is flipping out
[39:06.880 --> 39:10.360]  the scientists and I'm not saying the ancients were seeing the proper connections it's just
[39:10.360 --> 39:19.800]  that it's there galaxy spin like clocks once every billion years astronomers say as above
[39:19.800 --> 39:32.440]  so below so said the ancients and so now it is so as it always was and always will be
[39:32.440 --> 39:46.280]  now now there it is gravitational waves ripples in space time Einstein was a mathematician
[39:46.280 --> 39:52.160]  he was he came up with more original stuff is even Hawking but still they were guys chosen
[39:52.160 --> 39:57.800]  by the media to kind of change other people's theories a little bit and get the credit and
[39:57.800 --> 40:02.440]  I'm not saying that to put Hawking down but it's kind of like everybody always builds
[40:02.440 --> 40:06.680]  up Alexander Graham Bell Alexander Graham Bell was very stick to it it's very dogged
[40:06.680 --> 40:18.480]  amazing inventor but he wasn't 10% as visionary as Nicola Tesla so that that's all I'm saying
[40:18.480 --> 40:25.000]  is Stephen Hawking was a pop character and I guess they thought it was fanciful you know
[40:25.000 --> 40:33.200]  that he had a disability so that made it more interesting but that's that's really it and
[40:33.200 --> 40:37.080]  then whatever the establishment wanted to put out the last 20 years we would get a communique
[40:37.080 --> 40:44.880]  from Stephen Hawking and it would basically just be recycled globalist press releases

[46:14.600 --> 46:20.240]  and then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance all to make them march make

[47:02.760 --> 47:09.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:32.760 --> 47:42.600]  all right we're back live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us let me just
[47:42.600 --> 47:45.320]  give you some of the headlines that we're going to be covering throughout the broadcast
[47:45.320 --> 47:51.640]  today now that we're 50 minutes in there are 47 minutes in to the transmission and we're
[47:51.640 --> 47:58.200]  in the middle of worldwide governments banning free speech and putting in internet controls
[47:58.200 --> 48:04.000]  and tracking systems it's just unprecedented we need president trump and his campaign head
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.560]  and others to move against this and again they package the whole thing is anti-bullying
[48:08.560 --> 48:13.840]  now they're suing fox news for bullying because they investigated seth rich the day after i've
[48:13.840 --> 48:19.560]  been sued for bullying it's a defamation suit but get rid of the first amendment because
[48:19.560 --> 48:25.000]  alex bullied people pointing out that a bunch of democratic party operatives were in charlotte's
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.080]  vaxville and used the tragedy to try to blame president trump they turned that into jones
[48:30.080 --> 48:37.480]  says no one died or jones alternately says the democratic activist actually killed the
[48:37.480 --> 48:42.120]  people are killed the woman i didn't say any of that and they know that and their lawsuit
[48:42.120 --> 48:47.620]  is 70 pages of fiction and the lawyers have never seen anything like it they say it's
[48:47.620 --> 48:55.840]  a pr stunt they said summary judgment thrown out even though the fourth district western
[48:55.840 --> 49:00.880]  district doesn't usually do that they now pass slapback provisions last year people
[49:00.880 --> 49:09.720]  don't know virginia now has slapped provisions so i hope that when we win this i i hope georgetown
[49:09.720 --> 49:17.400]  is paying your legal fees sir because we're being assaulted by lies and and we're there's
[49:17.400 --> 49:23.240]  a lynch mob of media trying to shut info wars off you got articles every day i just read
[49:23.240 --> 49:28.840]  something trying to shut down info wars you've got all this happening deplatform us we shouldn't
[49:28.840 --> 49:31.800]  be allowed to have shopping carts we shouldn't be allowed to have banking we shouldn't be
[49:31.800 --> 49:36.520]  allowed to have any media platforms we need to be just shut down because we're bad we're
[49:36.520 --> 49:45.960]  fake you say i economically and in my speech and be put in a black hole so it's not a virginia
[49:45.960 --> 49:52.760]  man suing us it's a virginia man being used as a pawn by the university and by the democratic
[49:52.760 --> 50:00.720]  professors the democrat professors who say they want to silence me over all the first
[50:00.720 --> 50:10.160]  minute just this guy lies and says every tragedy didn't happen well i didn't say that so what's
[50:10.160 --> 50:17.400]  good for the goose is good for the gander but i am going to georgetown and i am going
[50:17.400 --> 50:26.880]  to start contacting a public list of libertarian conservative and christian catholic pro free
[50:26.880 --> 50:32.160]  speech folks on the alumni list and i'm putting together a research team of about 10 people
[50:32.160 --> 50:36.600]  who are going to be calling alumni full time and sending them information packets so you
[50:36.600 --> 50:41.640]  want to fight you better believe you got one and maybe georgetown thinks they can get more
[50:41.640 --> 50:45.200]  taxpayer money because they're really a public university so we're going to have congressional
[50:45.200 --> 50:50.440]  hearings and one thing the lawsuit gets right is congress does introduce a lot of legislation
[50:50.440 --> 50:54.680]  based on research from our broadcast you know like the mayac report and stuff that was real
[50:54.680 --> 50:58.760]  saying gun owners of the main terror group and congress you know had legislation and
[50:58.760 --> 51:02.920]  they and they and they told all my security stop saying that and trump removed that as
[51:02.920 --> 51:07.880]  soon as he got in a lot of other stuff like that so i mean if georgetown wants congressional
[51:07.880 --> 51:14.600]  hearings we're going to push for them because we need to have hearings anyways what what
[51:14.600 --> 51:17.560]  the top lawyers told me and it's exactly what he did they've been listening actually it's
[51:17.560 --> 51:26.840]  exactly as you say put lawyers in la in austin in in in dc in florida and they all said the
[51:26.840 --> 51:32.320]  same thing reading it they said it's a pr stunt they they actually invert supreme court
[51:32.320 --> 51:35.960]  rulings and are trying to make new law they say they're trying to make new law in press
[51:35.960 --> 51:44.280]  releases these professors extremely grandiose it flies in the face of all case law and this
[51:44.280 --> 51:48.920]  is one of the biggest first amendment cases ever this this will this will go down with
[51:48.920 --> 51:58.400]  my name at the top of it as as big as anything and if they want if they win this all investigative
[51:58.400 --> 52:08.000]  journalism all commentary all speech all speculation is punishable by massive amounts of money
[52:08.000 --> 52:13.280]  and or being banned from the internet so i said i get the other news it's just the magnitude
[52:13.280 --> 52:17.640]  of this and the four or five hours of phone calls i had your statement lawyers and just
[52:17.640 --> 52:24.280]  going over all this it is stunning and it appeared to be death by a thousand cuts following
[52:24.280 --> 52:29.040]  all these fraudulent losses which were getting dismissed like like knocking bowling pins down
[52:29.040 --> 52:36.000]  but their statements and what they're saying is just wild eyed kind of like judges saying
[52:36.000 --> 52:41.880]  in the night circuit and others to uh trump you cannot block anybody from any country
[52:41.880 --> 52:45.760]  know it's in the constitution it's in federal law and it took it with the supreme court nine
[52:45.760 --> 52:50.440]  to zero trumps right and it's the same thing the lawyers look at this they go one hundred
[52:50.440 --> 52:58.280]  percent this is a publicity stunt this is fraudulent this is lies they had a whole teams of lawyers
[52:58.280 --> 53:03.840]  watching what they put as exhibits and you walk into the court you go all these exhibits
[53:03.840 --> 53:06.840]  are wrong this you show the judge the clips you're not going to five hour hearing the
[53:06.840 --> 53:15.040]  judge is going to be like and it's the same thing fox news the next day sued democratic
[53:15.040 --> 53:21.040]  party funded that's admitted for questioning seth rich's murder and saying he might be
[53:21.040 --> 53:29.720]  the source of the wiki league and then assigns says we don't give up sources but it should
[53:29.720 --> 53:36.200]  be investigated because he's a source but see it's this whole emotion thing well it's the
[53:36.200 --> 53:40.680]  parents and they're suing she says she can't work anymore after her son was killed because
[53:40.680 --> 53:46.040]  of the murder and coverage lady I'm sorry Seth got killed we're trying to find out who
[53:46.040 --> 53:51.880]  did it there still haven't been found and if we investigate that are you gonna sue me well
[53:51.880 --> 53:57.160]  I gotta keep speaking see I'm not here to get my own bacon out of things I'm here to
[53:57.160 --> 54:01.840]  try to get all our bacon out of the fire so people that are self-centered out there think
[54:01.840 --> 54:06.200]  oh jones man he's always lawsuits against him oh my god did you know that actually we're
[54:06.200 --> 54:12.560]  budgeting all this out it's always the same it's crazy as each suit comes in more money
[54:12.560 --> 54:17.120]  comes in and it's always what's budgeted for what we need it's it's it's biblical we're
[54:17.120 --> 54:23.440]  given exactly what we need it's crazy whoever's led in their heart or spirit is financially
[54:23.440 --> 54:28.000]  support us plus get great products and speaking of that then I'll get into the goal bigger
[54:28.000 --> 54:34.080]  move out of London and Trump and all the really huge news that I should have led the broadcast

[55:08.240 --> 55:12.280]  aren't even very good if you're going oh look this is so incredible they can make Putin
[55:12.280 --> 55:17.840]  say whatever he wants or Trump say whatever he wants and what they do is they take actors
[55:17.840 --> 55:21.680]  and then copy the actor they don't actually copy Putin but but they're saying this is
[55:21.680 --> 55:27.040]  cause world war three it's already going on and just distorting video is the same thing

[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:45.320]  knew he'd been leaking information and of course roger it has those all those amazing

[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.520]  it's the russians and then the guy's useless to the russians it only hurts the russians and now
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:56.600]  the british government wants to start a war with them and uh do all this it's it's just crazy
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:05.000]  the uh russifo stuff that's going on i mean it's the communist chinese it's the globalist it's
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.520]  hollywood it's a democratic party waging war it's george soros trying to overthrow every sovereign
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:20.280]  nation on earth and hungry and romania and the check republic and poland and russia and by the way
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.400]  poland and all those places don't like russia but they're all saying the same thing as russia
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:29.800]  because they're got soros in their business and they are angry and i haven't gotten into the special
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:33.560]  congressional election you know the big question is did the democrats cheat
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:39.240]  they the democrats only winning by in that congressional special election 641 votes
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:44.440]  they said he was 10 points ahead the whole time that's how they manipulate the population people
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:54.600]  have a bandwagon effect and he's already declared victory look at that another smiley faced establishment
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:02.440]  henchmen of the globalist and all of that's unfolding and the democrats organize people
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.920]  all over the place to get folks to vote in the names of dead people it's on record so if somebody
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:14.040]  loses in a big state by 600 you better believe they got it stolen the poll said roymor was 15
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:20.280]  points behind he lost by half a point and then oh some precincts had more people vote than were
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:28.920]  on the voter rolls for the democrat for mr jones but it is a warning for trump democrats are saying
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:34.440]  too close to call pencil vanya vote though they're saying it's the democrat because
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:42.360]  it took a giant landslide to get over the wall of cheating it took a tsunami to go over the
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:47.640]  seawall of democrat party cheating they stole at least five states tried to steal six others
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:51.720]  it all came out they had upwards of five plus a million people vote the names of dead folks
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.880]  i'm not giving illegal aliens a pass it's just it's not that big a part of it the democrats are
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:01.240]  trying to make it where illegals can have drivers license and vote and they're doing it now in
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:06.440]  california the states so that will be the big problem but it's it's winos it's it's it's mentally
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:11.480]  ill people because i know it's project veritas caught it um larry nickles used to do it in
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:16.520]  arkansas and they would go load up people on a bus and have them vote 10 times that was the goal
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:21.320]  in eight hours they would have them vote 10 times and they'd get pissed and have to give them more
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:27.160]  whiskey and then the homeless would crap all over the bus and and again project veritas i mean mad
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:31.560]  you got a busload of homeless people man you're giving them tastes as a beer they start getting
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:36.760]  pissed and they walk in the voting areas they don't even know what their name is but it's democrat
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:42.200]  cities so the people behind the desk know what's going on that's why if you're living in a city
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:46.920]  you've got to go work on a precinct that's liberal it's blue and you're gonna watch fraud like you
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:53.480]  never saw because this is a party of ruthless criminal betas that want to wreck society and

[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:08.600]  to unveil massive package of tariffs against china and that's because we had a 40 tax on
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:16.040]  corporations they had a 15 we went to 15 china went to zero that's a tariff on us okay and
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.200]  everybody's saying oh trump you shouldn't do this okay well why does china get to have the tariff
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:26.680]  well we'll get dillbert's take on that as well crater dillbert scott adams britain expels russian

[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:38.120]  roger stone joins us uh rand paul vows to block trump's nominee to run state and cia and i like
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:44.760]  rand paul but uh but because trump's honest about the torture and i agree with the the uh
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:50.040]  secretary of defense matters we don't we shouldn't be going on but the the point is it does go on
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:53.400]  he says he continues to support president trump but i can't support people who never understood
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:58.120]  american first and want to manipulate the president into sphere of neocons who never
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:04.280]  met a war they didn't want to star in and then continuing uh special congressional election
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:12.120]  pennsylvania the the the the seeing in others are saying it's one but there are 3 000 ballots
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.680]  still to be counted we're watching at 641 votes is what the democrats winning by the question is
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:21.320]  that the democrats cheat and have dead people vote in pennsylvania is the sky blue do bears live in
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:28.920]  the woods uh do birds fly in the sky uh is santa claus make believe and the answer is yes yes yes
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:34.440]  yes and that just didn't prep veritas us everywhere it's just total why now it's coming in uh
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:41.160]  famously voting i remember people went and voted in michael moore's name project veritas has done
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:45.000]  that kind of stuff i mean you just you can walk in it's kind of like escape from new york
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.240]  we're trying to find the president he goes down in the bottom of this old sunken theater and he
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:53.400]  finds a whina that's got the transceiver on his arm he goes are you the president mr president
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:59.640]  yeah i'm the president well it's like are you john doe yeah i'm john doe i've voted nine times already
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.200]  so the democrats go oh there's no election fraud that's why they got a bunch of states that passed
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.520]  laws to give drivers license to illegals and let them vote but let's stop there's only got scott adams
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:14.680]  for two segments and we got a skype up he's joining us best-selling author creator of dillbert uh and
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:19.800]  of course he's at scott adams says on twitter blog dot dillbert dot com's got a new best-selling
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:25.080]  book out as well you're you you've always got a lot to talk about but but up front what do you make
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:29.640]  of this pennsylvania race what is it for bow to the blue wave what do you make of just where
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:32.760]  trump is right now what do you make of the big push i don't know if you've noticed that they're
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:38.120]  saying i need to be banned off the internet and they claim i said things i didn't say uh with this
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:42.760]  prior constraint stuff what do you make all that dillbert creator of dillbert well that's a lot of
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:48.920]  stuff all at once let me start with pennsylvania and say that humans are terrible at pattern
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:55.640]  recognition but unfortunately that's what our brains are we we are pattern recognition machines
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:11:01.880]  biological machines and we think we see patterns all over the place when sometimes we do and sometimes
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:06.760]  we don't pennsylvania is another good example everybody's looking for where's the pattern
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:12.840]  and what what does this tell us about the future probably absolutely nothing because when it comes
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:17.880]  to a special race and the focus is on just a few people it does sort of become about those
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:23.960]  individuals far more than it becomes about the country or anything else but i would note as i
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:32.440]  noted on twitter that pennsylvania apparently has elected in a great repudiation to trump they've
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:40.280]  elected a tall white male with a lot of testosterone now you could say that policies matter and you
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:45.720]  could make a good argument for that but i don't think people are actually voting on policy most
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:51.240]  of the time people vote with their tribe they vote with how they feel they vote with how a
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:57.800]  candidate just makes them feel and you have this weird situation where the candidate who
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:05.160]  is the democrat in this case reminds me most of trump compared to the other guy just on a very
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.960]  visceral you just made a good point scott adams that i've been wanting to make it's trump appointing
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:14.920]  a woman to the cia it's trump that's getting all these uh minorities to run the republican parties
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:19.640]  more open to that now it seems and suddenly the democrats i was looking in a wiki leaks article
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:26.280]  about all the cia folks the democrats have running and they all look like cookie cutter father knows
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:31.960]  best archetypal wasp white guy so it looks like the democrats have panicked and think that the
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:36.360]  republicans really are racist and just wanted a white guy so okay we'll give the blue collar
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:41.160]  rustate folks what they want a white guy but i'm not even sure that's it i think because the same
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.400]  republicans that voted for obama are the ones that put trump over the top i think they want
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:51.320]  prosperity and change yeah you know people say they want stuff you know people will give you
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:56.760]  the rational argument why they want to do things but rarely do people actually act completely on
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:04.040]  rational uh on rational means if you look at the uh the best example is the uh the gun the gun
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:10.680]  control walkout of the kids we're seeing today um in society i think the one thing that all of
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:17.880]  society agrees on is that the dumbest members of society the least informed the least capable
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:24.040]  are the youth because everybody knows how they were when they were younger you know i was certainly
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:32.280]  far dumber when i was 14 that i am now so we have this weird situation where policy may in fact be
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:38.840]  quite influenced by literally what everyone would agree no matter what side you are on guns the people
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:43.480]  who were doing the protesting are the dumbest members of society and i say that with love
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:47.480]  because we were all young now it's true but if you put an image of the young people you're not
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:50.920]  demonstrating at the white house i mean are we going to put these folks to control the nuclear
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.920]  power plants right now i mean are we going to put them in control of nasa we put them in control
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:59.480]  you know having your knee worked on for surgery i mean this this is a bunch of young followers
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:07.240]  who are young and inexperienced being manipulated by the media yeah well the the media is certainly
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:12.280]  part of it but they're they're doing a good job of you know working themselves up as well so there
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:18.680]  are a lot of forces but one thing we can say with some amount of certainty is that there are very few
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:24.920]  people among the young who are leaving school today who would actually even claim to having a
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:31.000]  a good knowledge of the entire gun debate you know all of the elements of it enough to really have
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.320]  a you know a reasoned opinion sure they're really all out there to take selfies they're really out
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:41.800]  there to take selfies of themselves well i'm sure that that group has a whole lot of motivations
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:49.000]  some of them are pure some of them are getting out of school but certainly we shouldn't take all of
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:56.520]  our guidance from from youth and of course there are more demonstrations today where do you see
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:05.080]  all this going the trouble with gun control is that people pretend there's a right and ethical
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:10.600]  logical rational there's there's a good solution and if they can only talk the other side into it
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:16.280]  there we'd have something the reality i think is messier i think the reality is that each of us
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:22.760]  have a very specific gun risk so in my case and i think this would probably be true for you alex
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:30.360]  if you and i own a gun at home you and i not anybody else but you and i are probably safer
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:36.360]  now an average person who doesn't you know is not on the radar is not a public figure
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:42.200]  doesn't have people threatening to kill them on a daily basis maybe they are worse off with a lot
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:46.440]  of guns let's talk about that when we come back because that's fair and because nowadays you have
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:50.760]  a lot of quote celebrities who aren't wealthy but are well known to have enemies why can't we have
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:54.920]  the right to own a gun we can't afford bodyguards at least i can't uh at least not too many and we
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:59.480]  got the guys on the roof with the machine guns but you know tired of being censored by facebook

[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:31.160]  i have a selfish question i want to ask delbert creator scott adams
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.640]  and we're gonna get back on the gun thing here in a minute and any other subjects he wants to
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:39.640]  pop into anise new book i really appreciate how he pops in on a different broadcast folks love him
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:43.960]  because it is a good perspective doesn't mean it's absolutely correct because everybody has
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:50.600]  their own perspectives but i have been sued 12 times by the democratic party lawyers in
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:55.480]  four cases they're lawyers that work directly for hillary they admit this we keep knocking
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:01.240]  them down real quick they're not even good they're like press releases but they're calling for the
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:05.480]  end of the first amendment you've got youtube calling for it you've got sadeek khan calling for
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:12.440]  it in austin right now uh you've got fox news being sued now for investigating seth rich
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:17.800]  and i've talked to law enforcement in dc i mean they think that's dead on but the fox has said was
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:22.280]  he the wiki leaker and then he's being sued it's an attack on investigative journalism and then
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:27.960]  they misrepresent what we've said what we've done and i've talked to top uh first amendment lawyers
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:33.560]  that haven't that haven't engaged for years and they said they've never seen a case like
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:40.120]  they filed against myself and former congressman ellen west and then fortune says youtube wikipedia
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:44.680]  conspiracy 30 crackdown isn't enough info wars and alex jones need to be shut down that's fortune
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:51.720]  to date so just shut me down europe's doing it um we've got alex jones is finally in the defamation
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:58.840]  lawsuit he deserves alex jones is a menace to society i'm suing him brendan gilmore and all i
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:03.160]  said is this guy's a democratic spokesman worked for hillary worked with state department and you
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:07.880]  know he's the guy always on the media after after charlesville blaming trump and then they
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:13.080]  sue and say i say he did the attack i never said that and the lawyers went and reviewed
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:17.640]  their exhibits and i don't say anything near it and they say they've never seen anything like it well
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:22.920]  what what do you again there's a major attack on free speech we know that what is your take on this
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:28.360]  what do we do or do you disagree because i told everybody it's me today it's fox news tomorrow
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:32.920]  it's it's it's the death threat you you were talking about it i mean it's the left it's frothing
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:38.840]  it's the antifa that hits you in the head with bike locks yeah look at look at the common element
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:45.800]  with your situation and with the special councils these and any other ones the the trouble is that
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:51.320]  as soon as you know you have enough laws in your country everybody's breaking one of them
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:54.920]  or you can make an argument that somebody's breaking one of them and when you get to these
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:23:00.520]  things like defamation there's a lot of opinion in here that the law is not so clear there are
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:05.880]  a million different variations of it it feels like all you need is a lawyer who's willing to
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:10.360]  take your money and you can make a case about just about anyone so it's a super dangerous
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:16.920]  situation generally speaking now when you get down to any specific case let's say your specific
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:22.840]  cases i think most of us just look at it we're not lawyers and we go i don't know it doesn't seem
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:29.720]  right that somebody goes to or you know it has some legal trouble because they say they're wrong
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:34.520]  let's say you say something that you think is true but you're just wrong should that be
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:40.760]  should that be a crime in this country how about how about you mention the topic and you say well
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:45.000]  this might be something we should look at and then it turns out that maybe it's not true
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:51.720]  should that be illegal in this country so there's a lot of gray areas where if you have enough laws
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:55.720]  there's always going to be some well that's what the top lawyers say i'm really impressed that's
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:00.200]  what all four lawyers said they said alex it's malice of forethought intend to do harm almost
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:05.240]  everything you said is true work for a congressman work with soros got money work to the state
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:11.000]  department is a democrat guy is you know anti-conservative and we just said look at all these liberals
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.280]  they're using a spokespersons look at how soros funds antifa they didn't conflate that and say
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:20.600]  that i'm saying this guy funds antifa and then they don't even have that but they put it in the
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:28.120]  suit my lawyer said the defamation is the suit but it's protected because you can defame within a suit
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:33.880]  so i the new thing is to defame people with lawsuits that's crap have you heard of that
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:40.760]  no and you know i think i i would be with just about everybody who's not a lawyer working in
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:46.040]  this field who says i don't really even follow all that stuff but the fact that you could get in
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:53.800]  trouble for either being right or wrong seems problematic to me because obviously you think
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:58.840]  you're right there are obviously people who think on some topics i don't know if this is one of them
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:05.320]  but think that you're wrong but shouldn't you have the right to be wrong and the right to be right i
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:11.240]  don't know which of them is the bad one but the i my understanding of defamation is that there would
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:18.680]  have to be intent to defame and that's a pretty tough standard and i can't imagine that that would
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:25.640]  apply to somebody in your job because why would you like what would be your motivation to just
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:31.480]  defame unless you thought it was true they also put stuff in there like 12.5 million that's not
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:37.240]  even right never was right and then he would say where they it's like a fiction novel a 70 page
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:42.360]  fiction novel that used a fanatory says we're basically white supremacists and all this stuff
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:50.440]  with no proof i don't know what to do well um you know we live in a in a terrible world where
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:58.840]  maybe the guns are dangerous but the lawyers are worse so we're we're we're seeing we're seeing
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:06.840]  certainly attacks on opinion um and you know and certainly the controversy opinions more
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:12.040]  so than we ever seen before and who knows where the end of that is but it just feels like a lawyer
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:16.840]  can go after anybody at this point you know you just if you've done something in public
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:23.480]  somebody's got a case against you back to the gun situation that's what it always falls to how
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:28.760]  can the royalty have taxpayer paid armed guards how can uh diane feinstein have a revolver
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:32.600]  in her purse and a concealed carry but nobody else can get him in san francisco i mean how
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:37.560]  do how does pierce morgan have armed you know response vans he pays for out front of his house
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:42.440]  but then i finally pay for security around the office just as i have to for my crew it's it's
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:47.080]  hurting our expansion it is a good deal it's nice folks but it's expensive the average person can't
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:50.920]  do that and i don't have it at my house i really can't afford it i've got my own second amendment
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:55.480]  and it just seems obscene they're trying to blame me as an individual for owning guns for what some
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:02.680]  lunatic hopped up on prescription drugs or psychotropic does yeah that's i mean you've you've stated the
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:09.240]  problem perfectly we don't have the same risk profiles if you don't want to own a gun and you
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:14.200]  know your biggest problem is that there might be a crazy person in the neighborhood hood who can get
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:19.240]  one i would say that person who doesn't own a gun doesn't want to own a gun and doesn't want to be
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:26.040]  shot in a masculine by a crazy person that person has a legitimate self-interest in having fewer
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:35.320]  guns around but you and i don't our risk profile is different so what does the constitution
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:40.920]  constitution say when we just have different risk profiles and unfortunately you have to default to
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:48.840]  you know what the constitution says clearly which is there's some gun ownership rights now within
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:54.040]  within those rights i think reasonable people can say bazookas around and some things sure but the
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:58.840]  democrats admit they want them all i mean they're not wanting quote reasonable gun control now
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:05.080]  they're more and more admitting well we want to repeal the whole thing you know i don't i don't
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:10.760]  see that being a realistic possibility so i don't take that too seriously i i never get too worried
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:16.280]  about the slippery slope because if the slippery slope were a real thing in other words if the
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:22.680]  concept of a slippery slope sort of always work then everything would be wrong you know we would
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:27.960]  we would be taxing at 100 instead of having absolutely there is some equilibrium in closing
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:31.080]  do you think the democrats are going to retake the house or senate in the midterms
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:38.360]  i think they got a good shot i my prediction right now is that republicans will do better
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:43.880]  than whatever we expected a few months ago so the republicans will do better if it's good enough
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:48.920]  that's still too hard to say i agree i think they hold on but lose seats if people keep sleeping but
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:54.280]  we could gain if people wake up thank you very much uh for joining us scott adams blog dot delbert

[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:29.560]  donald trump's record out to everybody nobody should be fooled he proudly declared himself
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:39.080]  100 right to work he even hired a union busting firm to break up an organizing campaign at his
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:47.480]  hotel in los vegas where you are right now and he built up his wealth by stiffing small businesses
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:53.480]  and contractors that goes against everything we stand for as a country my dad was a small
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:57.000]  business i'm just businessman i'm just happy never to visit with trump
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:07.320]  your dad was a gangster in chicago the clinton's swindle billions of dollars the clinton stole
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:14.520]  97 percent of the Haitian money they they took control of all the charities that's all on record
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:20.920]  bono's even worse he has his one foundation because he gives exactly 0.8 percent then he
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:27.800]  got complained about he now gives 1.2 percent look it up that's mainstream news i just wanted
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:34.680]  to play that to remember what a kook and what a witch this lady is and now falling down three times
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:41.640]  having to be held up in india because it's in these lawsuits it's in the news that jones
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:46.680]  he's been taken off the air for saying hillary had health problems and that's why she lost the
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:53.080]  election well i mean she disappeared for a year in 2013 and we had little birdies
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:57.720]  we don't get people's health records of course not because he had a brain tumor removed and
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:01.320]  that's what they don't like because the little birdies in fact guys i forgot adan sallazar's
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:06.600]  written the article i asked earlier please print me the article put it on screen please about the
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:11.880]  the nature of the bomb in austin of the three bombs this is directly from law enforcement
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:16.200]  uh that were on the ground because i know about an hour ago he said his story was almost ready
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:22.920]  so was that upon informers dot com yet just give me a roger and i'll uh i'll know on that
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:28.840]  speaking of roger we're going to go to roger stone here in just a minute but let me just check
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:34.440]  okay well as soon as it's up let me know okay just keep printing me the new articles as they
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:38.840]  come off because that's one blind spot i've got is info wars dot com news wars dot com
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:43.480]  constantly has amazing breaking news at it and i just tend to just go with the stuff i already have
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:47.560]  or there'll be something big going on and i'm not on it's let's just stay focused on cnbc and the
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:52.600]  financials stay focused on the russia situation which you know i don't get it a whole fake russia
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:56.760]  gate deal and then counter their lies every time because they just make up more and then recycle them
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:01.960]  but hooten has come out with some really big news there's been some really big movements in england
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:07.560]  and this dead russian spy defector and all of it so
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.760]  that is coming up with a bunch of video clips about putin here in a moment but first i wanted to
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:20.360]  ask roger stone about rex tillerson's departure which he predicted six months ago and which he
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:24.120]  said that would be coming and be done by march but we got to find that this is about two months
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:29.080]  ago he said by march he'll be gone and of course he was really let go friday we didn't get told about
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:35.560]  it till a few days ago what's really behind that uh what is behind all the latest uh dis info
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:41.400]  taking place against him and the whole fake russia gate and what's really happening in pencilvania
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:45.640]  did the democrats steal that election only by a couple hundred votes but we know they have
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:49.720]  dead people voting everywhere they admit it so i would imagine they actually lost mightily roger stone
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:56.040]  well alex uh it's great to be with you um first of all that was a great clip of hillary clinton
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:02.920]  and it's amazing that her blame everyone else tour just seems to continue while she was in india
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:09.880]  she says that the reason she lost was because women had uh voted for trump on the orders of their
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:17.240]  husbands boyfriends fathers or brothers uh what an extraordinary opinion of american women
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:22.120]  and then she implied that the states that voted for donald trump did so because trump is a racist
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:29.000]  seeming to have forgotten her own admonition that black people need to be brought to heal or
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.960]  forgetting that it was her husband who went to the supreme court arguing that racial profiling
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:39.800]  pulling a guy over for driving while black should be perfectly all right uh so who are really the
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:47.000]  dog whistlers this woman has blamed the fbi uh bernie sanders uh the american people uh everybody
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:55.240]  but herself it's she's just she's comedy gold she continues to nettle and disrupt the democrats
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:39:03.640]  they just would like her to climb off the stage that was a great great clip roger as you know i'm
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:08.840]  being sued congress fenomenal west is being sued leon mackinill our report is being sued
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:14.840]  lee strana hands being sued by the bunch of others by georgetown university but nowhere
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:20.440]  in thousands of news articles does it tell you georgetown university which is taxpayer funded
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:25.080]  the school's private but the but the law school is like 80 uh public that by the way these have
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:28.920]  congressional hearing they need to have hearings about how the these schools are already these
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:33.560]  anti-free speech zones so now these are tentacles of the anti-free speech going out they lie and
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:40.440]  defame me in 70 pages they attack prompt they say i control congress it is not just a fiction
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:45.640]  it's like a hallucination and i called four different lawyers who read it two of which
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:53.000]  worked for me uh all four have done work uh and they they said exactly what i said they said we've
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:58.440]  never seen anything like this this is an attack on investigative journalism all you did was ask
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:04.680]  questions the democrats have been caught painting poop swastikas inwards burning crosses uh the
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:10.840]  babies out incubators bush senior uh you know all the fake things they've done but there's articles
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:15.160]  where there's hundreds of the listed false flags liberals pull on themselves we didn't even say it
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:18.920]  was a false flag we said sort of funded antifa then they had democrats there that worked for
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:23.320]  hillary who became the spokespersons now that person suing me saying i should be taken off the
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:29.880]  air and i'm a piece of crap but i'm a menace and then the washington post the new york times none
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:35.240]  of them call me for a quote the washington times did a few others i called them got one line quotes
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:42.440]  like five pages of the other bs so this is the press trying to roast itself and then the day after
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:51.000]  fox news gets sued over investigating seth riche and over guests that were on fox news when all
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.320]  the evidence points towards well this person's still out there and and and that seth riche
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:59.640]  was targeted but you're not supposed to even be able to have that opinion in a suspicious murder
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:06.280]  that make tom clancy you know books illegal or parry mason movies i mean this is next level
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:12.440]  this is an attack on speech this is an attack and this is the greatest attack on free speech
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:17.320]  these lawyers have ever seen they said if this went through the courts it would end the first
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:23.880]  amendment as we know it roger yeah now what this is alex is a new tactic of left called lawfare
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:29.960]  i think that term was coined by my attorney tyler nixon he's exactly right they file these
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:35.960]  extraordinarily expensive detailed lawsuits which are all based on falsehood lies and then they
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:42.840]  spin that in the mainstream media uh to your detriment now in the definition is only able
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:48.840]  to be done in the law because in the court it's protected and isn't and so that so they're the
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:56.280]  defamers number one number two though uh there's a new standard uh in the new journalism you no
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:03.160]  longer need proof or evidence you can just have hearsay a person said roger stone told them that
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:09.560]  he was going to uh to london do i dine with julie nissange that person doesn't require any
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:16.120]  corroboration but they can get on msnbc and they can repeat hearsay get media coverage but you were
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:21.480]  on air saying i'm trying to talk to assange the new york times and and cnn were interviewing him
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:25.560]  he did that but you you couldn't get the interview they go look he said he's trying to talk to
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:29.480]  assange i remember you saying i'm sending him all these emails trying to talk to him i know a
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:33.560]  talk show host that's talked to him he says it's bombshell about hillary you said all that on air
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:39.320]  they just uh i never had any dialogue with them they would respond to me i never asked him to come
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:44.120]  on look i've never met the man i've never spoke to him but speaking to him wouldn't be inappropriate
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:51.240]  because uh he's a journalist uh and well stay there let's come back and look at tell us and look
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:55.640]  at everything else and and more on this with roger stone and the special election in pennsylvania
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:02.920]  they use their media to assassinate real news they use their schools to teach children that their
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:08.840]  president is another hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:14.600]  to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex-president to endorse the
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:21.240]  resistance all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism and
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:27.480]  xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:33.960]  bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:40.120]  and stop the madness and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:47.320]  the only way we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:54.280]  violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth i'm the national rifle association of america

[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:32.120]  sing an end they're all actively calling for us to be shut off the radio tv and the internet

[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:43.000]  everybody else of the democrat side we can call for his death and my death and the president's
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.960]  death this is a temper tantrum big corporations working with others the censor it's here and
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:55.160]  it's the biggest assault we've ever seen and nowhere in the news is it georgetown university
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:49:01.640]  taxpayer funded law school the lawyer said we've never heard of a law school being antifree speech
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:07.880]  the clinic's always defended this is unprecedented and so you need to pull your money if you're an
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:15.000]  alumni we're going to start contacting the alumni we've got a database and we're just going to point
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:22.440]  this out um but roger is popping and he's so obsessed with this because you know they keep
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:27.560]  calling him a russian agent like they call me and roger saying you know i never said i reached out
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:32.920]  to usange it's like this this tar baby of it sucks all the air out of the room and all we talk about
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:38.200]  is how we're not russian agents and it's stupid i remember and i go from memory roger you on air
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:42.760]  what i'm saying is once all this stuff broke and once all this stuff was going on like a year and a
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:47.400]  half two years ago i remember you like even in july going of course the media talks to usange i'd
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:52.040]  love to talk to him and find out what he's got but i've never talked to him that's my point is that
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:57.560]  no i mean i had a back as you know i had a back channel a confirming source who was correct in
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:04.360]  every regard now alex as you know i never knew the content source or exact timing of the wiki leaks
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:10.440]  to uh uh disclosures we had an all night broadcast expecting them for october 1st because that's what
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:17.720]  my source had told me uh even though he didn't know the content the the exact timing uh or the
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:23.080]  source of the documents then on the first asange did not release anything we were told that his
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:28.040]  lawyers feared for his life and he delayed but only for three days roger don't you get that it
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:32.200]  doesn't matter all the media was trying to talk to him i know you had the back channel he testified
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:36.680]  to congress no matter how many times you tell the truth and set the story straight they don't care
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:41.320]  so the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again i don't disagree alex
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:49.880]  let me say this you now have a a a a a a wild bloodthirsty uh uh a pack of hyenas who try to
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:55.800]  parse every word they take a washington post interview in which a witness who is faceless
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:02.040]  and undefined says you told him something he says he has an email that proves it but no
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:07.560]  reporter at the post has seen said email and you're expected to respond to that and then when you do
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:14.360]  salon slate mother jones a hundred other lefty fronts recycle that as if you have done something
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:19.960]  wrong wanting to relitigate this because i'm being sued in new york this is important
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:25.560]  because the the underlying elements of those lawsuits are that donald trump and i worked
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:32.440]  together uh to uh with the russians to hack the the sure i understand and now that takes us into
[01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:36.760]  seth rich they want you distracted defending yourself that you're not a chinese jet pilot
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:44.440]  from pluto instead of seth rich and the and the uh islamic brothers from pakistan running the dnc stuff
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:50.280]  and the fact that it wasn't hacked that it was leaked according to the data card and and and the
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:55.000]  information and now they're suing the seth rich family is suing fox for investigating an open
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:01.080]  murder case i mean they the the democratic party is admittedly behind this with the family and is
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:05.240]  suing everybody that investigates anything so let's just get back on the offense let's talk about
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:10.680]  seth rich let's talk about debbie washerman schultz uh let's talk about hillary and and newness saying
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:15.880]  they found evidence of her collusion with russia and how uh the congress found no trump collusion
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:20.840]  let's get back on the offense right now let's do it go ahead and talk about it you know you're
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:26.280]  absolutely right uh we are spending too much time trying to clarify uh the smears and when
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:33.000]  the smears can't be clarified uh it's uh it's a mob mentality and very little that they say can be
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:38.520]  trusted but the democrats it meant in polls no one buys this crap that's all i'm saying they're the
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:44.280]  russian agents they're the chinese agents let's get on their ass well that's exactly the point what
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:48.040]  they're trying to distract from is that they've been caught red-handed in the biggest case of
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:53.800]  political espionage in american history that hillary is uh in bed with the russians and the
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:53:00.120]  chinese that she's basically for sale that they have subverted the constitution and the law to spy
[01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:06.840]  on the republican candidate for president the fbi and the doj are in on it they have used fabricated
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:13.240]  evidence to justify the spying uh they're you're absolutely right all of this russian nonsense
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:19.960]  this noise is meant as a distraction from their crimes thank god for devin newness thank god for
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:25.000]  the ongoing investigation into a corruption by the devin and notice there's no coverage there
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.240]  well well bottom line trump now is saying he'll do the interview but he wants to close to this
[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:33.400]  even s and l's attacking miller because miller never found anything now he's looking at chinese
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:38.920]  money and other stuff which we said yeah that that's in politics big time uh where is this going
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:46.040]  well uh look because there is no special counsel law miller has free range to go anywhere he wants
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:51.800]  meanwhile you have uh are not people inside the administration the president that's where i was
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:56.920]  going next how big a deal is this uh because you were the guy that called that said tillerson will
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:02.680]  be gone you broke that again uh you know remember our exact reporting i said he first did he be gone
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:06.520]  by the first of the year then at the first of the year reported that after a dinner with general
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:12.920]  mattis general kelly and the president it would be march and i called it yet again info wars
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:17.640]  tomorrow's news today and what day was that i want to find that because that's powerful i mean you
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:23.880]  did say by march yeah no we can find both the correction and the original prediction you know
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:28.120]  several months before the end of the year last year or actually i think it was at the end of
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:32.120]  you started saying in december he'll be gone in about a month and then you said no now it's march
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:38.520]  now the point of course is the president's entitled to his new appointees but richard
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:44.120]  pompeo pardon me michael pompeo is a he's a question mark there is a guy who in the house
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:49.640]  was in the freedom caucus was a cheerleader for wiki leaks and a sage and their incredible
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:56.200]  11-year record of being accurate and exposing the darkest secrets of the deep state but now
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:02.840]  as a cia director he seems to have been captured by the menderin's at langley he continues to say
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:08.600]  assange is a nation state agent the russians they they keep claiming over and over again
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:16.040]  and uh and pompeo and sessions want assange prosecuted in this country for publishing
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:20.680]  classified documents now even the obama administration's justice department figured out
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:26.280]  that if you prosecuted assange for publishing classified documents you'd have to publish the
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:30.840]  wash you'd have to prosecute the washington post and the deal sure they've all been doing it and
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:36.200]  they've also been using it to twist the documents not just release documents they then distort the
[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:42.360]  documents well in some cases they put it out there with their spin on it to further the agenda of
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:48.040]  the deep state but still this is what journalists do don't you think pompeo's feigning this so that
[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:52.280]  they don't get political heat and then uh you know we've seen in some of the federal rulings
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:56.680]  and when we've seen the white house lawyers arguing in cases uh that you know nothing should
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:04.120]  be done uh you know to assange uh as well well i mean i think this has to play out ultimately
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:10.200]  i don't know what law assange has violated uh he is seems to be getting steadily free of his
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:15.880]  legal problems in britain where an outstanding warrant uh you know it's the warrant itself
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:19.880]  it is now the issue not the understand we get rid of one problem and then there's still another
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:23.800]  i'm gonna go to break come right back i want to ask why tillerson's gone then what this whole blue
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:30.920]  state wave situation means we're going to talk about that with roger stone when we come right back
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:34.760]  after this break just briefly because i'm only doing one minute of plugging this hour and we need

[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:03.800]  was because they believe that they've got some evidence that it's it may be somebody right

[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:58.520]  say we're not even going to talk to you to say that we've never talked to you so we know that
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:01.960]  you got hillary getting hundreds of millions of dollars from the russians all the rest of it
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:07.400]  and i get now it's in the front of the paper you know stone in trouble stone caught and it's these
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:11.320]  hoaxes just like they did with general flinn with joy bayhar remember this here it is
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:21.320]  oh my god oh breaking news abc news brian ross is reporting michael flinn promised full cooperation
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:27.320]  to the Mueller team and is prepared to testify that as a candidate donald trump directed him to
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:35.080]  make contact with the russians yeah i um had people confront me in colorada and in austin the
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:40.520]  airport saying you're going to prison roger stone's going to prison uh you know flinn admits your
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:46.840]  russian agents and they still remember that and think it's real and because they put it out on
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:52.200]  every news channel in the country so i i get it roger here's the problem you're not gonna affect
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:57.800]  libtards that want to believe this stuff you understand no i don't know i fully understand
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:02.120]  but what it's interesting alex is that we're both under the same assault where they use the phony
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:09.160]  lawsuit to try to bankrupt you where they they use an army of lawyers you're being sued by obama's
[02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:13.800]  law firm he set up to take down trump they form a new national security group to counter us and
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:18.520]  they're i mean yeah so people should know the globalists who do they hate they hate us and why
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:24.920]  do they hate us well and john brenner and james clapper uh susan rice they filed an amicus brief
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:30.040]  in the in the case against me which says something innocuous like the russians often use political
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:35.640]  consultants to do their dirty work no evidence of course well that's it you're guilty and these are
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:40.760]  the people illegally spying on trump who got caught lying about it and then found no evidence but this
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:46.520]  is the new journalist extended a person can say alex jones said and they don't need any underlying
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:52.280]  proof for evidence that that is their case the whole eoc thing four years ago there were pictures
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:56.680]  of bodybuilders in an editing studio because they were editing a bodybuilder shoot for super
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:04:02.280]  male vitality and that's gay grooming headline jones is a gay groomer and then people read the
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:07.080]  art where they read the thing and it goes bodybuilders sorry go ahead no it's the same thing as when
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:12.200]  they say roger stone said he flew to london and met with julie nissan's when my passport shows
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:17.160]  nothing of the kind they can say anything about us and then that becomes their evidence and proof
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:22.360]  it's a new standard well we got to start striking back and so i told the lawyers i said because i'm

[02:08:10.520 --> 02:08:15.240]  and i really appreciate you joining us in closing i've been asking the questions here what other
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:20.600]  tidbits about the blue wave pennsylvania we know the democrats always have people vote the names of
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:25.000]  dead people if this republic it looks like it's only lost by less than a thousand votes that means
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:30.200]  they stole the election there i mean this this isn't we know democrats steal everywhere uh we
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:35.400]  they got caught in roy more with more votes in precincts than there are registered voters uh so
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:39.880]  that commission trumps god we've got to get that moving because i i think the republicans will keep
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:44.600]  the house of the senate but not if we let the democrats engage in massive election fraud well
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:49.720]  this was a republican district uh the president cared by 12 points our candidate was not that
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:54.920]  strongest candidate a good guy but not very telegenic their candidate was probably a better
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:09:03.000]  candidate special insurance soros the hard left for millions probably as much as 25 million dollars
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:10.040]  in this little rural relatively rural uh suburban i should say congressional district uh and uh
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:16.040]  trump has bucked the overall trend in special elections the historical trend is the party
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:22.280]  in power regardless of the situation loses special elections in the wake of a presidential campaign
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:26.760]  the president has won most of them i think virtually all of them this one appears to
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:33.480]  have been lost by a handful and yes it would be fair to suspect foul play it should certainly be uh
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:40.280]  examined in these lawsuits alex i know the costs my my costs are up to a half million
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:45.880]  dollars to fight the pony lawsuits you're looking at millions of dollars ultimately
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:50.760]  to fight the lawsuits against you and against info wars because they're designed to silence you

[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:44.680]  obama suing you saying you're a russian agent and they're suing us with all this frivolous stuff
[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:49.560]  we're winning is why they're targeting us but people need to know this is the war for this
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:53.880]  republic this is it uh so just briefly they're going to get them again as roger stone you're
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:57.720]  coming up in about 45 minutes or about 50 minutes the house of the fourth hour and you'll be on the
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:02.920]  war room with oan shroyer let me ask you this question what do you see in your crystal ball
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:07.880]  in 2018 and what do we need to do to make sure we keep a majority and keep keeping america great again
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:15.640]  well here is the key i still believe that uh sometime in september uh mr meuller will
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:22.440]  issue a report that says the president broke some law process whatever a perjury obstruction
[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:27.640]  something not russian collusion interestingly enough the democrats will then run on that in
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:33.960]  october they have no platform they have no program to restore prosperity or address the trade valence
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:42.040]  or make our country safer by fixing our immigration system or uh or a plan for economic revitalization
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:46.760]  or to rebuild the infrastructure they have no plan at all they're running on one simple plan
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:54.040]  we hate donald trump we want to remove him republicans have to run on jobs in prosperity
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:59.560]  and expanding economy country club republicans who run away from donald trump will do so at
[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:05.320]  their own peril run with the president we have the winning message they do not have the winning
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:12.920]  message i'm actually optimistic about 2018 with this exception if they strangle the access
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:19.080]  of the alternative media info wars first and foremost the daily caller breitbart town hall
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:26.920]  gateway pundit uh uh uh you know the the robust vibrant alternative media then that puts us at
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:31.560]  a disadvantage that's right roger stone thank you so much thank you i mean this is just an
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:35.320]  incredible time to be alive right now thank you roger now i want to go to gavin mcginnis who's
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:40.680]  going to be uh joining us until about 40 after so then dr steve pacenic is going to get into
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:46.760]  tellerson the cia uh these attacks on free speech uh how the globalists are trying to derail the
[02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:52.120]  country gavin mcginnis hosts to get off my lawn uh of course uh that goes out on the internet and
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:13:00.040]  some tv stations across the country at crtv.com and the great work uh they're doing and i also like
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:04.840]  to have he's wearing make frogs straight again uh so a little ode to the whole mean they've set up
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:08.840]  with us because i warn about the gender bending chemicals the water that's totally a bad fact
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:13.320]  but they say i should also be taken off the air for spreading uh that truth uh but gavin mcginnis
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:18.680]  i've got a lot of questions a lot of things to cover but what is first uh on uh in in in in in
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:28.600]  your rocket launcher today a comedian named matt leib did i actually discuss it on my show tonight
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:35.720]  and he's adamant that george soros is not a nazi all george soros did was lead the nazis
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:40.760]  to jewish homes so they could be exterminated and all he ever did was say that was the happiest
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:47.960]  time of his life but besides that he's not a nazi yet you have all these jewish i gotta stop
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:51.960]  because we didn't have your audio on for like five seconds i apologize start over my friend
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:57.560]  all right here's what i can't stop thinking about today so george soros according to aj plus
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:03.080]  according to some wash up comedian named matt leib that i just saw uh i did did a video about this
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:09.480]  george soros according to the left is not a nazi i know that he led the nazis to jewish homes where
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:14.680]  they were then exterminated i know in 60 minutes he said that was the happiest time of his life
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:19.320]  we know that he doesn't identify with judyism he's an atheist and his dad hated jews but he's not a
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:27.720]  nazi however anti-globalists such as alan dershowitz denis prager ben shapiro as lord levant levant
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:34.920]  all of these jewish anti-globalists well they are nazis you see and it's amazing the pretzel
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:40.840]  that they can twist their own logic into when it comes to this ridiculous nazi allegation
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:46.600]  you know i've got the compilations we'll play it when we come back from break of him saying it was
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:50.440]  the best time of his life he's not ashamed of it blah blah blah he wrote his autobiography one of
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:53.880]  the earlier ones he thought he was the messiah but didn't believe in god he's in the wiki leaks
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:59.880]  wanting to overthrow israel and turn it over to hamas and and and then we've got the young
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:05.560]  turd guy and we've got a CNN and all of them saying i'm a liar need to be taken off the air
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:12.200]  for attacking a holocaust survivor george soros yeah he's a holocaust survivor he was a holocaust
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:18.200]  survivor the way gobbles was a holocaust survivor he was not a survivor he was a facilitator and to
[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:22.680]  say that he reluctantly helped the nazis you might as well say that about half the nazis
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:28.680]  that you think they were all enthusiastically jumping into that war he is in the same boat as
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:32.840]  most nazis wait a minute are you gonna tell me that hitler wasn't a holocaust survivor
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:36.440]  pardon me i mean next they're gonna say hitler was a holocaust survivor
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:43.560]  yeah have you seen this now this video it's all about how globalist is an anti-semitic term
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:49.960]  and part of their argument is just you yelling about globalists there's no other rationale to

[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:18.120]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france notice that people who ate certain
[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:24.040]  quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:29.960]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast acting

[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:40.760]  effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:46.440]  acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory

[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:27.720]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:35.720]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones and we're talking to gavin mcginnis
[02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:43.480]  comedian reporter founder of ice television and i'm glad he brought this up because i
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:46.520]  usually ask a bunch of questions when he's on he just covers topics i bring up i'm glad he brought
[02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:52.680]  this up because they're saying that trump sandy's submitted when he talks about globalism when
[02:20:52.680 --> 02:20:58.760]  globalism is run by the communist chinese and unelected yucca in the e u who is the grandson
[02:20:58.760 --> 02:21:03.240]  of the richest nazi and nazi germany the yucca bombers the yucca industrial family
[02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:06.840]  they were the richest so so when it came from private citizens they were the top nazis
[02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:13.480]  his father was a nazi so you've got all these globalists and then they say it's anti-semitic
[02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:17.720]  to say globalism when george soros is one of the top globalists in the world and he wants to
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:22.360]  overthrow israel so this is the sick mind of the left where they're saying i deserve to be sued i
[02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:26.280]  deserve to be taken off the air because i'm bullying people but then they're saying i'm anti-semitic
[02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:30.680]  and tom brokaw says i'm a big racist so here's some of the clips that gavin um again this was
[02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:34.600]  talking about where soros said it was the best time of his life he's not ashamed at all you know
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:41.960]  he'd do it again and he helped round up jews here it is it's the claim that the uh the august protest
[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:46.120]  was some sort of left-wing plot who he might ask would say something so offensive an elected
[02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:51.160]  representative who's serving right now in the u.s congress and look at the background george soros
[02:21:51.160 --> 02:21:56.680]  is one of those people that actually helps you know back these individuals who is he my understanding
[02:21:56.680 --> 02:22:03.960]  is is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were uh is adopted god
[02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:10.120]  son yes went out in fact and helped him the confiscation of property from the jews that side
[02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:16.600]  was it difficult
[02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:25.560]  but not not at all do you think george soros funded the neo-nazis who marched in
[02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:29.880]  it's going to be interesting to find out these conspiracy theories were first spread by radio
[02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:37.640]  talk show host alex jones is this lost on anyone george soros is a famous nazi collaborator
[02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:46.520]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones all right so i got a bunch of
[02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:50.840]  topics to cover in this segment next with the gab before dr c patinic joins us but i'm glad he
[02:22:50.840 --> 02:22:54.440]  brought this up because i've gone during the break and watch the video he's talking about
[02:22:54.440 --> 02:23:01.720]  there's a huge pr campaign by msnbc cnn abc news the young turds uh with their you know genocidal
[02:23:01.720 --> 02:23:08.680]  name the young turds for genociding christians all of this and trump points out after they made
[02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:12.520]  it a controversy well you know mr cohn was a globalist he's not an nationalist so he's gone
[02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:16.600]  now you know we're america first we're not transferring power the tpp so now what do they
[02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:21.880]  do about world government that's in trouble they say we're anti-semitic but it's insane so what do
[02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:29.080]  you think of this pr campaign to give george soros a facelift well it is it's a bizarre move but
[02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:34.200]  soros is very powerful you know ezra levant called him out for this nazi thing many years ago
[02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:42.040]  and ezra has been in lawfare with i'm i'm convinced with soros funded people ever since but the irony
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:47.720]  of all this is you know where that 60 minutes reporter got his information from george soros
[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:54.280]  if you want to know about his nazi involvement check out his books he's the one who let the
[02:23:54.280 --> 02:23:58.680]  cat out of the bag i'm sure it's something he deeply regrets now but he let the cat out of
[02:23:58.680 --> 02:24:03.800]  the bag oh no no i've been told that's why i've been sued 12 times by democrats is that hillary's
[02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:07.800]  butt hurt and that you're and then leave george soros alone no i'm gonna start having giant
[02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:12.600]  conferences about the nazi collaborator george soros and i'm calling for his arrest so keep
[02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:18.120]  suing brother i'm never giving in i love it let's go you know if you get an argument for a 14 year
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:23.640]  old trying to survive okay i can get with that but how about the whatever that was the 65 year old
[02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:28.200]  75 year old talking about how he doesn't regret it i was just saying to my buddy today i beat up
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:34.120]  david mackintosh in fourth grade i threw in the creek that goes by our school i feel bad about that
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:42.920]  but david mackintosh lived and uh he received zero zyklon b in uh my my grade school george
[02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:49.240]  soros was responsible for i don't know how many does he was he was a collaborator and then said
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:54.760]  i feel good about it i do it over again someone else would have done it it's a very sociopathic
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:25:00.520]  statement if an enemy took over my country and said help us round up fellow americans will kill you
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:04.680]  i wouldn't do it but it just shows the leftist mentality and then now but you know next they're
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:08.840]  gonna say he did did you know it was actually george soros killed hitler fine i'll go go source
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:13.960]  what he wants soros is actually captain america and he actually fought hitler defeated the nazis
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:19.480]  you know what's really going on here once again it's their identity politics and you say something
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:23.960]  bad about a group like globalists and they go well a lot of globalists are jews so you hate jews and
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:31.960]  you go no no no no no no no i am an idea man we are ideas people and our idea is nationalism
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:37.640]  someone else's idea is globalism i don't care what group what kind of people are on either side i
[02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:43.400]  don't deal in that i don't deal identity politics i deal with ideas and my idea is the west is the
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:48.600]  best america is the greatest nation and i want to protect this nation i don't want open borders
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:54.600]  i don't care what color what religion what what what specifics other people have all i care about
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:26:00.680]  is those ideas western show if you're if you're pro america pro western pro success pro freedom
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:07.400]  you can be purple we love you come on in but instead the left are the ones selling racism and
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:13.400]  division and i'm sure you've seen an apple's taken uh easter off of their calendar and said yeah you
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:18.760]  bet we have and then it's just that they're going why do they hate christians why do they but then
[02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:23.080]  they always want to get into the countries that have the christian ethos yeah it's a bizarre
[02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:27.080]  thing i'm convinced his daddy issues you know these children are all the children of divorce
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:31.160]  they're mad at dad i mean they're adding they're mad at anti-semitism when it's a white male because
[02:26:31.160 --> 02:26:35.880]  white male reminds them of their dad they're not mad when it's reverend right or lewis ferrican
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:41.400]  or linda sarsour or basically all of islam they don't mind it then so they're not about ideas
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:45.720]  they're about who's saying the idea and the common thread seems to be guys who look like you and me
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:51.800]  and who else looks like that they're dad so we're dealing with petulant children who are still but
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:57.480]  hurt about a divorce that 50 percent of the country goes through grow up babies by the way i used to
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:01.800]  think you were wrong about this theory two years ago but now when leftists walk up to me and say
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:07.880]  f you they go f you why do you have so many kids f your family in front of me or they say oh where's
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:12.040]  your family about them by myself i would like you know my kids are with me 75 percent of the time
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:16.840]  uh and i'm glad they're you know with their mom some whatever fine the other point is is that
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:23.480]  they they're pissed i have a family and they are pissed and it's usually weird white males uh who
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:28.280]  are gay and again i'm not against gay people but it's like it's like half the time it's an old white
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:33.960]  woman or it's gay guys screaming f you nazi and f your family why do you have kids and i guess i
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:39.960]  understand i don't know what happened to these people well i i get so much so much so many attacks
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:44.760]  at my marriage and my wife and they talk about my imminent divorce they can't wait till i'm divorced
[02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:51.160]  and i think my wife's not political why do you care about my marriage why are you so vested in
[02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:57.160]  the idea that my family would fall apart they love that idea and look what they did to Pamela Geller
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:03.720]  two men died on their way to murder her she had her own security shot dead two men trying to kill
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:09.320]  her and then that chick whatever her name is taylor lorenz or something happily docks his
[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:15.000]  her children who are again apolitical and puts their lives in danger so now jihadists want to
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:20.440]  kill these two your lefts are total bullies and they use jihadis as their enforcers then they
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:25.000]  say we're bullies and call for our free speech to be shut down they are so why i'm gonna come back
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:30.200]  and ask you beyond the daddy issues it's like a cult of destroying the family it's a i mean
[02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:34.360]  it's what happened like five years ago i had three children then i'd be in whole foods just
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:38.440]  want to walk over and go you got too many kids it's hurting the earth and what it is is they're

[02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:49.000]  learn they're just deleting hundreds of videos a day of our 30 plus thousands so the numbers
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.160]  just going down from two and a half billion to one and a half billion youtube's blocking people
[02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:58.360]  being able to share our videos i mean uh but we're on 200 radio stations and over a hundred tv
[02:33:58.360 --> 02:34:04.600]  stations now and we've got more than 30 agreements back there of u h f v h f and cable stations where
[02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:09.240]  i'm not going from my own glamour channel we're at my own channel on cable like when back on
[02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:14.200]  others tried but where u h f v h f and cable stations that want to put us on basic cable because we're
[02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:19.080]  on a u h f then by law it ends up being on the basic cable uh we're getting huge response already
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:23.960]  from the affiliates it's really exciting and it and so you know the george soros lawsuits and the
[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:29.080]  democratic party lawsuits and all that they get thrown out the the the the their press release
[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:33.400]  stunts to defame us in the court because then that's protected that's the one place you can
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:37.880]  defame people you know we're suing the white supremacist jones because he says that no children
[02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:42.520]  died uh you know here and i've never said any of that and and and then it just sits there
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:47.480]  then it goes to the court and i pay the lawyers and it goes away but now's the new face where i
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:51.560]  do have to start suing the minions because you know you see the big globalist they just their
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:55.320]  money launders and do all other stuff they don't care but when you target the little minions they
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:35:01.720]  start learning that oh alex jones sues the minions uh master i know you're giving me money to do this
[02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:07.560]  and sign on to this but uh but what's going to happen to me and so that's the deal is you're going
[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:12.840]  to get counter counter punched uh gavin you're making such a good point because i remember reading
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:21.000]  ten years ago the uh textbook used to university of texas that um one of my listeners daughters had
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:25.080]  going to school to be a social worker and it said the family's bad it's arcane we're going to get
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:30.680]  rid of it well now they say that on the news now you know on on twitter uh and on msnbc their hosts
[02:35:30.680 --> 02:35:36.760]  say trump's bringing up family and churches and that stuff's all gone uh and and then the goals
[02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:41.080]  to get rid of the family the nuclear family's bad well that's the opposite of tolerance and that's
[02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:47.400]  going after it so the religion of the left the thing that binds them is they really do hate
[02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:53.320]  families and on average uh they're whether they're gay or straight liberals don't have children
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:57.320]  unless they're poor liberals that's more like just the people they control but the average left as
[02:35:57.320 --> 02:36:02.360]  we know almost no one in the eu that's a communist or socialist has children and so what is it because
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:06.360]  you you're the guy that really harps not on the fact that they hate families i know that but it's
[02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:12.920]  their religion and they really hate us for it well those people came up to you the mall the
[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:17.240]  grocery store and they said you have too many kids oh okay all right let's talk about ideas
[02:36:17.240 --> 02:36:23.160]  so your concern is over population okay let me look it up oh it turns out that the the american
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:28.840]  citizens that they tend to have a population that's stationary or going down the american population
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:35.400]  is going up but it's almost all immigrants mostly mexican going up so you must hate them then if
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:41.080]  you're against over population no no we love them and you look at time magazine and it'll have one
[02:36:41.080 --> 02:36:45.880]  month it'll say don't have babies we have too many babies and i've all white babies in the picture
[02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:51.560]  and then the next week it will say the new face of america or the new face of europe or the west
[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:56.360]  is turning brown and they'll talk about how great it is to have refugees and you realize oh you're
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:03.000]  all about identity politics and the individuals involved in what race they are we're involved
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:09.240]  in ideas and what's kind of fun about that is their stupid idea is not to breed and not to
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:16.440]  have families our stupid idea is to breed like rats and they are going to be extinct our children
[02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:21.880]  are not going to have to deal with these annoying childless lesbian feminists because they're all
[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:26.040]  going to be gone they're the dodo birds and by the way i have nothing of us lesbians i don't
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:31.160]  know my wife doesn't okay i'll be sitting there and that will be at a restaurant and you and it's
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:38.920]  just these four folks are so uptight why are lesbians so uptight i well you mean you look at
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:43.320]  this is a separate thing but i can't help but notice gay men are always dancing around in
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:49.240]  short shorts lesbians are always grumpy in ill-fitting denim pants exactly it's gotta be sex
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:54.920]  male gays get laid more and getting laid apparently makes you happy because there's no one grumpier
[02:37:54.920 --> 02:38:02.600]  than a lesbian well i'll just say it without getting to family show in my experience lesbians
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:08.520]  are people that have had a bad experience with men in their life and most women grow out of it
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:13.240]  and and that's just my experience and then they get real happy when they get a man and in fact what
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:16.040]  what would you say i mean you know a lot about this i know you've talked about it if you want
[02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:20.440]  to get personal but i mean how many men are married to a former lesbian i mean let's just get honest
[02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:25.640]  about it go ahead yeah you always say well we used to call it we used to call them lugs in college
[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:30.520]  lesbian until graduation and it's easy to be bisexual when you're young and gorgeous and female
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:35.240]  and all you gotta do is make out with another hot chick when you're drunk but but hanging out with
[02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:41.640]  an obese 40-year-old lesbian intending to your garden that's a little less rock and roll and uh
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:48.200]  yeah the numbers dwindle drastically but why does this tiny population these tiny group of sexless
[02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:54.680]  depressed old chubby dykes control so much of the political narrative why are entire elections
[02:38:54.680 --> 02:39:00.120]  dedicated to something as irrelevant as gay marriage we're really it's like uh the tyranny
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:05.000]  of the minority and by the way i'm not against hillary because she's a lesbian and has her daughter
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:09.880]  as a beard with wept her obel i don't like her because she's evil and corrupt and a warmonger
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:15.080]  and then you hear about the stories with her with the young women that don't like it and then she's
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:19.400]  climbing about chauvinism and stuff when she's way more chauvinistic and more abusive than probably
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:24.520]  even bill i mean the word on her is she smacks those chicks around she smacks men around secret
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:30.920]  service fbi you name it oh bill clinton bill clinton is it's bill clinton with the giant sunglasses
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:36.200]  saying i'm a real klutz she's hitting she's hitting with an ashtray in front of the secret
[02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:40.520]  service and knocked his ass down i mean i'll give it to her she's made her in hell and poorly she
[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:45.400]  just bulls into women and goes toots getting a bit bitch you know sorry go ahead as far as as far as
[02:39:45.400 --> 02:39:51.320]  lesbians go i i appreciate her taste umma evident is my cup of tea i like the way she ages i like
[02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:55.880]  her long hair big lips i think hillary and i have the same taste in chicks come on your wife does not
[02:39:55.880 --> 02:40:04.920]  look like a in a mace-eated goldfish i wish she will with enough plastic surgery we're gonna spend
[02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:11.240]  the money well the word is uh you know hillary smacks him around so i mean but i what is it about
[02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:14.760]  statistically lesbians there was a bunch of articles saying i'm making this up it's in the
[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:19.320]  crown statistics mill paglis talked about it why are lesbians the highest rate of suicide and the
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:26.440]  highest rate of domestic violence i think a lot of lesbians are playing house and so the the man
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:30.840]  of the relationship comes home with his wife beater and his pompadour he'd been working on his car
[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:35.400]  no no that's it they're lesbians because daddy beat her up he wasn't a good daddy but that's what
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:41.240]  she thinks daddy acts like right they're playing the role of dad and they're choosing this 1950s
[02:40:41.240 --> 02:40:46.600]  archetype this post-war tough that's a left created that isn't even real yeah some weird
[02:40:46.600 --> 02:40:52.840]  mechanic in a wife beaters like hey where's my dinner you better get the beer on my hand right now
[02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:57.480]  why don't i have a beer on my hand and you go uh that's a weird archetype that we never really
[02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:03.320]  were but okay you run with that while you play dress up you it's funny how they hate the family
[02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:10.520]  yet they can't wait to mimic it in some way and again cps kids taken from their parents so that
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:17.240]  the other gay couples can have your kid yeah it's almost like planet of the age like the families the
[02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:20.600]  poor families are running and here comes here comes the government especially in san francisco
[02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:24.920]  or places in the news and it's like nets over the families and these grab the kids and it's like
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:30.120]  we're just oh i guess but they're the new ruling class i guess well salt eliske laid all this out
[02:41:30.120 --> 02:41:37.960]  too it's always like uh make the make radical and weird and perverse normal then destroy gender
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:44.360]  then destroy the family then attack christianity all of this is well documented by papu canon
[02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:49.800]  it's all about chipping away at the west and destroying it so you can rebuild it from scratch
[02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:55.560]  in your own image just like george soros wants to do it all comes back to this globalist plan of
[02:41:55.560 --> 02:42:03.240]  be pro nazi be pro anti nazi be pro chaos get them all fighting burn america to the ground
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:08.360]  and now we can build it back up and i'll speak in esperanta like his dad always like his dad
[02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:13.560]  taught him to do by the way and we can all be one language one people where soros and his cronies
[02:42:13.560 --> 02:42:19.160]  decide who gets electricity who gets water what cell phone we use that's the way it is in the global
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:23.400]  you are on fire gabin mcginnis and that's right they couldn't get esperanza through though i saw a
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:27.640]  lot of that in seattle so now it's just they're attacking all language saying it's racist and
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:31.800]  then you can only use the language they say is okay and then sue all investigative journalists

[02:46:55.560 --> 02:47:17.560]  you're listening to the alex joneshow
[02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:31.000]  all right we're going to do this segment the next with dr. steve pacinic then we've got roger stone
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:34.840]  coming in but i think we may coastal bit with him i got so many questions for dr. steve pacinic
[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:38.920]  best-selling author wrote books with tom clancy produced big movies worked with state department
[02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:43.320]  did a lot of covert action stuff overthrowing governments you name it and he's giving us a
[02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:47.560]  lot of good intel i want to know about why tell us himself stone said it back in december then he
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:53.320]  said he'll be gone by march he actually gave you by by early march is what he said tellers is gone
[02:47:53.320 --> 02:47:58.520]  uh what does that mean what does it mean about Pompeo coming in and then i don't make about us but
[02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:03.800]  my god they are everywhere saying get rid of conservative libertarian free speech pre-control
[02:48:03.800 --> 02:48:08.760]  it people that question official narratives must be banned my lawyers some of them are some of the
[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:14.360]  best lawyers in the country on defamation they said this new thing filed by georgetown law probably
[02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:18.040]  will be thrown out these because you there should be congressional hearings and it's taxpayer funded
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:22.440]  at that law school it's a private school but the law school's taxpayer mainly funded and they said
[02:48:22.440 --> 02:48:28.120]  it's uh it's defamation in the suit on purpose and is a stunt and it calls for the end of the first
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:33.720]  amendment and prior constraint and inverts supreme court rulings so my lawyer said this if this past
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:38.520]  it would repeal uh i mean if they prevail it will repeal the first amendment and we've got
[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:42.600]  the head of youtube calling for it all of it's one about both those areas and where we are as a
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:48.440]  republic where do you want to start first where we as a republic we're doing quite well the fact
[02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:54.680]  that rex tillerson was leaving roger's correct we've known that for well over half a year to a year
[02:48:55.560 --> 02:49:02.280]  we've prepared for that in terms of providing uh pompeo who was number one at west point
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:09.720]  he was one of them number one at harvard and we knew that he could work with uh trump in a much
[02:49:09.720 --> 02:49:16.760]  better uh emotional alliance than rex tillerson but i must say uh secretary of state tillerson is an
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:24.520]  elegant man incredibly bright incredibly effective i i'm sorry to see him go and i'm sorry to see the
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:30.520]  way he was going because i would treat this man with the utmost respect uh he reminds me of james
[02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:38.200]  baker a very solid uh american and an incredible asset to this country i would hope that he would
[02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:45.000]  continue as being an advisor of some sort but i understand what trump is doing trump will be
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:52.040]  giving random McMaster soon the national security advisor and we in turn in uh the military in the
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:58.280]  intelligence world would appreciate if he picked uh lieutenant general napasoni who's head of cyber
[02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:05.240]  command and was a student and a deputy to uh general keith alexander and what would happen
[02:50:05.240 --> 02:50:10.120]  isn't that we would have more military we would have more effective technological advancement
[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:16.440]  at the national security level at the same time we have a new dci she's a woman i understand she's
[02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:22.600]  very highly regarded i don't know her personally jina has she has the history of being involved
[02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:28.280]  under clinton and rendition interrogation and torture i'm not for that i was against it
[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:36.200]  as you well know however having said that uh i will not stop her nomination on that basis because
[02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:41.160]  if you go after her then you have to go after her boss jose rodriguez who was head of the
[02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:46.120]  county terrorism office and if you go after him then you have to go after john brennan and if you
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:52.440]  go after john brennan then you have to go after obama and bush jr it's selective to burn a middle
[02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:58.280]  level person when they were following orders correct and and basically she was given a legal
[02:50:58.280 --> 02:51:05.080]  waiver on that i was told that it was legally uh allowed at that particular point of time from a
[02:51:05.080 --> 02:51:11.320]  point of view of effectiveness and morality i don't agree with it i i would hope she would explain it
[02:51:11.320 --> 02:51:17.480]  to the senate committee and explain why it was done and why she will not continue to do that uh
[02:51:17.480 --> 02:51:23.480]  torture and rendition is not effective ironically rendition came in under clinton bill clinton they
[02:51:23.480 --> 02:51:29.400]  never said anything about it and the torture interrogation came in by the biggest uh draft
[02:51:29.400 --> 02:51:35.880]  dodger i've ever met that was cheney and bush jr so you have all these powers who come forth
[02:51:36.440 --> 02:51:42.120]  and become a manifest a macho man at a time when we don't need it and it's not very effective
[02:51:42.760 --> 02:51:48.600]  but our moral stain will be cleaned if we keep on doing and and avoid the things we did in the past
[02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:54.840]  as for uh the economy it's doing well i think there are certain other people who will have to
[02:51:54.840 --> 02:52:01.560]  leave i i agree with trump uh david shulkin of the va has been a disaster for the past year
[02:52:01.560 --> 02:52:07.560]  i've complained about him i'm glad he may be picking rick perry to take over but the va has been
[02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:15.320]  poorly run very ineffectual 25 psychiatrists left the uh subpoena va he had no idea what he
[02:52:15.320 --> 02:52:22.040]  was doing this position shulkin and unfortunately a lot of the veterans uh now are going to be at
[02:52:22.040 --> 02:52:27.880]  the behest of people who really don't know how to treat ptsd they're shifting years out of that
[02:52:27.880 --> 02:52:31.400]  because i'm here just kind of giving a general rundown we think to how trump's doing what about
[02:52:31.400 --> 02:52:35.400]  i'm sure you've noticed seeing and going at their sponsor seeing and trying to get a shut off the
[02:52:35.400 --> 02:52:41.400]  internet uh hundreds of newspapers a day saying ban me i'm a nazi uh get me off prior constraint
[02:52:41.400 --> 02:52:47.720]  georgetown law the lawyers never seen this fall to suit they say to basically set a precedent
[02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:53.880]  to ban people that question official narratives they put all these lies in there uh i'm told
[02:52:53.880 --> 02:53:01.000]  soros is funding a bunch of this what do you make of this giant assault i i i think it's an absurd
[02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:06.600]  non-significant assault although it creates a lot of problems for you the the actual
[02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:13.320]  thrust of the assault has no basis in reality as you know anyone who would question 9 11
[02:53:13.320 --> 02:53:18.520]  would have to explain many things as they did sandy hook as they did out of the fit the things that
[02:53:18.520 --> 02:53:25.480]  came on in uh in florida the three false flags the truth of the matter is once they attack you
[02:53:25.480 --> 02:53:30.840]  they've attacked millions of us americans who've said look the official narrative or the narrative
[02:53:30.840 --> 02:53:38.280]  presented by cnn or msnbc in the new york times is is not correct and in fact what would happen
[02:53:38.280 --> 02:53:42.760]  is once they go into court and you do go to court people like myself would be happy to
[02:53:42.760 --> 02:53:49.000]  explain why technically it was impossible for the arabs to attack our country and why in fact this
[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:56.280]  was a 9 11 why in fact alex jones has been able to express its feelings of those in the intelligence
[02:53:56.280 --> 02:54:02.360]  community as well as the military community in other words what i'm saying to your adversaries
[02:54:02.360 --> 02:54:07.800]  beware of what you want because you may well end up with a real problem and a real headache
[02:54:07.800 --> 02:54:14.280]  it soros is what we call it in a utenorite he's a jew read we've had a lot of those people the
[02:54:14.280 --> 02:54:21.080]  hungarians overall the jewish hungarians were never really rounded up as much as the poles myself
[02:54:21.080 --> 02:54:27.800]  my family 96 of who were exterminated the the hungarians towards the end of the war all fled to
[02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:34.840]  switzerland and the guy like soros is classical a utenorite he's a he's a slime bag i've seen him
[02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:42.120]  at the council on farm relation he's the spickle individual and this is what happens in the world
[02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:48.760]  where you have the the rat the jew rat who comes to the forefront and makes the point of it all he
[02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:55.160]  does is to illustrate how disgusting he is and what happened to many jews who were in fact involved
[02:54:55.160 --> 02:55:01.240]  in the nazi holocaust one is hydric none of the germans and neither the israelis want to admit
[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:08.040]  that hydric was a jew his father was a famous musician hydric was a violinist he was very much
[02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:13.640]  of a jew uh the first town that they attacked in austria was where hydric lived and he was
[02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:20.040]  then in charge of the extermination of jews so you're talking about the blonde beast yes that's
[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:27.720]  exactly right and so this gets into a very serious problem where the the history of anti-semitism
[02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:33.000]  is distorted but more importantly what's not been brought up in that history is exactly what happened
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:39.720]  to you there's no mention of the fact that hitler first took out lutheran ministers the reason for
[02:55:39.720 --> 02:55:46.120]  that is the lutherans were the predominant voices of christianity in the north very little was ever
[02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:52.200]  said that lutheran ministers were exterminated in pokandalkow then he went after the catholic
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:58.120]  priests who in the south part of the varia and they were exterminated until popeius the 12th
[02:55:58.120 --> 02:56:04.520]  made a statement that's why you have the uh the sound of music that was not an accident you had
[02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:12.040]  catholic austrian nobility that was exterminated and no mention is made of that so christianity
[02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:17.960]  was also exterminated you have 30 million slugs sir hitler was big time anti christian he was an
[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:25.160]  occultist and in all sorts of other in insanity so so so looking at this so what i'm saying now is
[02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:30.840]  the fascism that you saw i i predicted what happened a year ago when the fascism of the left
[02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:36.360]  comes in or wherever you want to call it when suddenly political correctness becomes the
[02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:43.080]  norm of our speech and the norm of our thinking you already have the basis of fascism when we in
[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:49.400]  fact contradict that we are the opposite to fascism which is the liberalism the irony is
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:55.160]  there has been a total switch and positions between the so-called liberals who become the
[02:56:55.160 --> 02:57:01.080]  fascists and we who have been called the conservatives we believe in free speech we will
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:07.240]  not censor anybody on the basis of their religion their their color or any other state and they're
[02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:11.960]  now expanding off the universities with their laboratories of ending free speech to the rest
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:18.520]  of the country and admitting it it is such a bold launch such a bold attack and i don't think it's
[02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:24.120]  going to work because it's creating a strizing effect well let me tell you what happens having
[02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:31.640]  attended three different corn uh you know elite universities cornell university cornell medical
[02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:38.360]  school wasn't implicated in uh all kinds of sadistic activity hold on stay right there back
[02:57:38.360 --> 02:57:43.400]  in two minutes i want to get into this because georgetown which is the biggest cia recruiter is

[02:59:46.280 --> 02:59:56.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:59:56.280 --> 03:00:20.840]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:25.240]  all right i'm gonna go ahead and call some with roger stone coming up because there's a bunch of
[03:00:25.240 --> 03:00:29.080]  news i haven't gone through in a bunch of video clips i want to get to morning joe flipping out
[03:00:29.080 --> 03:00:33.640]  getting triggered when they see trump with the new border wall all of it but but dr pacenek you were
[03:00:34.920 --> 03:00:39.240]  author steve pacenek steve pacenek.com is with us looking at the transformation happening not
[03:00:39.240 --> 03:00:44.040]  just here but all over the world companies are going for populism they're going for free market
[03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:48.600]  because everybody knows that's the restaurant where the parking lot's full and that's where the
[03:00:48.600 --> 03:00:53.960]  good food's at and sure enough she won restaurant with five cars one with a hundred if you go to the
[03:00:53.960 --> 03:00:57.800]  one with five cars it tastes like crap you wonder why it's still open you go the other place you
[03:00:57.800 --> 03:01:04.120]  know why it has 500 cars or 200 cars and it's the same thing capitalism free market all the thousands
[03:01:04.120 --> 03:01:10.040]  of choices everything it's obviously so much better but it creates spoiled people who then convalesced
[03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:16.280]  into these liberal socialist collectivist armies to then make us their slaves how do we defeat that
[03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:21.080]  paradigm because you know half a millennial identifies communists are now reporting now
[03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:25.560]  generation z most of them identifies kind of libertarian they're rebelling against the indoctrination so
[03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:30.280]  what i'm getting at is they are getting so vicious they're getting so dangerous and i know you're
[03:01:30.280 --> 03:01:35.400]  being positive i'm positive too but it's just they have gotten them by successive approximation
[03:01:35.400 --> 03:01:41.880]  now the average leftist is a crazed maniac lunatic now i experience it i'm on the street i see it
[03:01:41.880 --> 03:01:47.880]  they are gone by successful approximation pretty soon you are jim jones kool-aid level i mean they
[03:01:47.880 --> 03:01:54.760]  are whacked out of their brains we now have a large part of the population that are radicalized
[03:01:54.760 --> 03:02:02.120]  mental patients let me put it this way what i've been doing for the past couple of years here in
[03:02:02.120 --> 03:02:08.840]  this area in the south i've been helping conservative men and women who are entering the political
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:16.520]  system at a very young age 30 31 each one of whom has served in our country mainly in the military
[03:02:16.520 --> 03:02:22.520]  and then they've decided to go on become lawyers or whatever teachers but they have decided to
[03:02:22.520 --> 03:02:29.320]  enter into the political mainstream you have to remember historically only four percent of our
[03:02:29.320 --> 03:02:35.880]  population at any given time has really been involved in the actual actions of the state
[03:02:35.880 --> 03:02:41.160]  or the nation the republic will remain strong it doesn't matter whether you have spoiled people or
[03:02:41.160 --> 03:02:46.280]  not for the most part if people are spoiled it's because they've had too much or there's very
[03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:54.200]  little demand on them in the case of universities i do agree they are spoiled most of these universities
[03:02:54.200 --> 03:03:00.280]  are really tenured institutions for geriatric professors many of whom don't belong there
[03:03:01.160 --> 03:03:06.600]  so they're allison wonderland false reality bubbles it's not just allison wonderland they're
[03:03:06.600 --> 03:03:12.840]  more lethal than that at the university level you have people who have tenure plus a union
[03:03:12.840 --> 03:03:18.680]  that's not just allison wonderland you have people who have used whatever knowledge they've had
[03:03:18.680 --> 03:03:24.120]  and they've regurgitated that knowledge 20 to 30 years and in fact if you went through the
[03:03:24.120 --> 03:03:31.160]  university i'll give any university including the ones i went to mit i could easily throw out 30
[03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:36.920]  percent of the faculty i could go through harvard medical school and i did and i predicted that their
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:43.160]  residency program at mass mental health would go under and that was easily 30 doctors i could go
[03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:48.760]  through Cornell medical school and easily go through any one of their departments and and
[03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:56.120]  call out 30 percent why because the university has become a scam it basically an instant it created
[03:03:56.120 --> 03:04:02.760]  a reality which said that if you come to us no matter what it was particularly the ivy league
[03:04:02.760 --> 03:04:11.080]  you will get a phenomenal future absolute nonsense the content was absolutely absurd half the time
[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:18.040]  most of that content wasn't relevant it was there to really the content and now and now
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:21.800]  they're they are filing thousands not just against me but they're doing it against

[03:06:26.680 --> 03:06:29.160]  all right i'm going to finish up daughter steve pacenic here then i'm going to get into this
[03:06:29.160 --> 03:06:34.760]  exclusive article on info wars dot com dealing with the type of bombs that have been used the
[03:06:34.760 --> 03:06:39.160]  last two weeks three different bombings been some fatalities some injuries and the very very
[03:06:39.160 --> 03:06:45.720]  mysteriousness surrounding that we have the exclusive information given to us by i'm not
[03:06:45.720 --> 03:06:49.480]  going to say state local or federal it's just people that were in the house dealing with the
[03:06:49.480 --> 03:06:59.160]  bombs this is directly from the horse's mouth and it's on info wars dot com sources law enforcement
[03:06:59.160 --> 03:07:05.160]  sources we should add that law enforcement sources austin packaged bombs pressure activated assembled
[03:07:05.160 --> 03:07:09.800]  on doorsteps law enforcement leaks information info wars protect the public similar to ied's
[03:07:09.800 --> 03:07:16.520]  used in the middle east and they are assembled on the doorsteps because you can't move them
[03:07:17.960 --> 03:07:25.240]  all right we've got images of the of the type of bombs you name it so uh i was like they want us
[03:07:25.240 --> 03:07:29.800]  to have this and you want me to put this out and this isn't going to mess with the investigation
[03:07:29.800 --> 03:07:35.240]  they go no this is going to let people know what it looks like and not to move the packages of
[03:07:35.240 --> 03:07:41.800]  their suspicious and it appears that they're also not putting packaging labels on it and of course
[03:07:41.800 --> 03:07:45.880]  the person could change that but the point is is that if you see a box especially doesn't have labels
[03:07:45.880 --> 03:07:51.480]  on it and you didn't order it don't touch it if you're in awesome texas three of these have gone off
[03:07:51.480 --> 03:07:56.600]  and that's what's going on so that's coming up dr steve i was talking about this during the break
[03:07:56.600 --> 03:07:59.560]  and i talked about this over the weekend but i haven't talked about it enough because julie
[03:07:59.560 --> 03:08:05.800]  massage we know is a good source uh warrants cia flooding a democratic party for 2018 midterms trying
[03:08:05.800 --> 03:08:11.320]  to steal elections trying to manipulate things deep state in league with dims says wiki leech founder
[03:08:11.320 --> 03:08:16.520]  and uh that articles on info wars dot com we're going to retweet that news wars dot com as well
[03:08:16.520 --> 03:08:21.320]  because it hasn't gotten the attention i mean i did get thousands of comments that go viral but um
[03:08:21.320 --> 03:08:25.000]  people say well wait you have cia sources that are good but now the cia is bad it's factions
[03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:29.160]  obviously i know you've worked with the cia quite a bit and run some of their operations why don't
[03:08:29.160 --> 03:08:34.760]  you explain to people what's going on here because you were saying no this is correct this is going
[03:08:34.760 --> 03:08:39.320]  on and then the other reason i raise it is you said just in your little neck of the woods you're
[03:08:39.320 --> 03:08:43.160]  getting people in the south and in florida and georgia military people that you know you know
[03:08:43.160 --> 03:08:47.640]  we're good and have good records to run for office themselves so there's a they're really
[03:08:47.640 --> 03:08:51.640]  always been doing this haven't they but now we're starting to do it and so they're now
[03:08:51.640 --> 03:08:56.680]  kind of doubling down is that an accurate statement that's correct what's happening you have to
[03:08:56.680 --> 03:09:02.920]  remember the the history of the cia was really at the os s starting in cambridge massachusetts
[03:09:02.920 --> 03:09:09.960]  and uh when it was created by donovan the os s converted to the cia you had the first leaders
[03:09:09.960 --> 03:09:15.080]  colby dollas the whole bunch of them you had pretty much what was considered the white
[03:09:15.080 --> 03:09:22.280]  anglosaxon protestant until the 1960s when uh jews and and catholics were allowed to come in
[03:09:22.840 --> 03:09:29.080]  what's happened over the era is that the cia really got out of control and eisenhower said
[03:09:29.080 --> 03:09:34.600]  correctly and this is the president i admire the most along with george marshal the man who
[03:09:34.600 --> 03:09:41.640]  appointed eisenhower is that this is the legacy of ashes and the cia has been a problem for many
[03:09:41.640 --> 03:09:48.840]  many decades i myself although i was trained by the cia at mit i did not belong to the cia per se
[03:09:48.840 --> 03:09:54.600]  i worked with them like anything else there was a good the bad and the ugly however over the period
[03:09:54.600 --> 03:10:00.200]  when jimmy carter was in i approved the fact that along with stanfield turner admiral turner
[03:10:00.200 --> 03:10:05.000]  they got rid of about 4 000 operatives we didn't need them the reason we didn't need them is we
[03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:11.000]  had military intelligence we had political officers so we have a reduplication of an entity
[03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:17.480]  kind of the equivalent of the fbi but not doing very well on the covert side the civilians were
[03:10:17.480 --> 03:10:24.200]  really a problem and so when you produce cia operatives like bill clinton who worked for the
[03:10:24.200 --> 03:10:30.920]  cia hillary clinton who worked for the cia you have obama the black baby of the cia incredible
[03:10:30.920 --> 03:10:39.640]  an american whose mother was a brilliant cia operative in in in far east and she was an
[03:10:39.640 --> 03:10:46.680]  anthropologist then you have infiltrated the cia along with an idiot like john brennan and tenon
[03:10:46.680 --> 03:10:53.560]  you have a incompetency that shifts to any side that the political wind was in so when you have
[03:10:53.560 --> 03:10:58.840]  the clinton's and you had obama they were shifting to the left when you had an idiot like bush jr
[03:10:58.840 --> 03:11:04.440]  they were basically acquiescing to everything when i went back into the cia and i threatened
[03:11:04.440 --> 03:11:10.120]  several cia officers with many things that i can do they admitted to me that there was a stand down
[03:11:10.120 --> 03:11:17.800]  there was a false flag uh the deputy to uh paul wolfowitz admitted it to me and the neocons were
[03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:24.520]  all co-opted by the cia so when i went through the entire pentagon all i saw was a cia then i went
[03:11:24.520 --> 03:11:30.840]  to my military officers keith alexander jerry boykin and others and explained to them that you
[03:11:30.840 --> 03:11:37.640]  are in the in the hands of an incompetent civilian structure which dreams of being paramilitary
[03:11:38.760 --> 03:11:45.240]  and taking over covert operatives in reality the cia has lost human it became absolutely
[03:11:45.240 --> 03:11:50.840]  dysfunctional organization but what it did exceedingly well it went to hollywood under john
[03:11:50.840 --> 03:11:59.320]  brennan and gave somebody like kathy bigelow a very seductive manipulative little director zero
[03:11:59.320 --> 03:12:07.560]  dark 30 a total bs story about how they killed osama ben laden and obama the biggest pathological
[03:12:07.560 --> 03:12:14.440]  liar along with bush jr and clinton said that he assassinated osama ben laden that's the kind of
[03:12:14.440 --> 03:12:21.400]  nonsense that came in the cia where you myself and others were half were able to kind of realign
[03:12:21.400 --> 03:12:26.680]  that and bring into the fold the military intelligence why was that a difference because
[03:12:26.680 --> 03:12:31.640]  in the military system we have accountability we have an oath to the country sure we're almost
[03:12:31.640 --> 03:12:35.240]  out of time i mean the point is at least people had to be in combat and be trained to do real things
[03:12:35.240 --> 03:12:41.640]  not just sit around in little black suits and say we're cia a bunch of white shoe uh fops and fakes
[03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:46.120]  that want to act tough and that had taken over most the country and so what i've seen with trump is
[03:12:46.120 --> 03:12:49.800]  he's got pompeo and other people in there and really they're trying to get back on mission back
[03:12:49.800 --> 03:12:56.280]  on free market and uh try to pare out all of the all of the little sycophants and that's why the
[03:12:56.280 --> 03:13:02.120]  sycophants are so pissed so they're all now rushing openly in a like a counter counter coup
[03:13:02.120 --> 03:13:06.360]  to try to overthrow everything but instead all they're doing is pissing everybody off even more
[03:13:06.360 --> 03:13:11.880]  and making everybody know they were right about this fifth column of snot-nosed weirdos like
[03:13:11.880 --> 03:13:16.840]  anderson cooper who are so insecure they want to mount america's head on the wall because they
[03:13:16.840 --> 03:13:21.320]  want to feel powerful and so now they've made the sleeping giants stand up and now they're in full
[03:13:21.320 --> 03:13:27.400]  panic mode he trained in the cia every summer he was a clerk he was one of the few homosexual
[03:13:27.400 --> 03:13:33.480]  clerks for the cia he doesn't deny it i mean basically he's not relevant no but is that an
[03:13:33.480 --> 03:13:37.800]  accurate statement then so so so describe the counter coup of trump and what's happening and
[03:13:37.800 --> 03:13:43.400]  why it's got the corrupt elements of the deep state so upset what what has happened since we
[03:13:43.400 --> 03:13:49.000]  came in and it was with your help as well a year and a half ago i said the military will be taking
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:53.800]  over the white house we will be taking over the defense department we won't have any more of these
[03:13:53.800 --> 03:13:59.880]  jerk civilians like panetta and we're going to take over intelligence as well so military
[03:13:59.880 --> 03:14:06.120]  intelligence became far more important than the cia the cia could no longer do human so we transferred
[03:14:06.120 --> 03:14:13.000]  a lot of human into the military aspects the cia barely can do cyber kinetics or cyber command
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:18.200]  and instead we have a guy who also the cia people are always trying to make money and run some scam
[03:14:18.200 --> 03:14:23.160]  or engage in criminal activity but but the military which i have seen remember remember four years ago
[03:14:23.160 --> 03:14:27.160]  when the military had a press conference separate from obama when they'd already broken with obama
[03:14:27.160 --> 03:14:31.480]  over the middle east and they said we're going to stop lying but we're also going to put the
[03:14:31.480 --> 03:14:35.640]  military in every town to engage with you and i said oh look that's going to be the takeover
[03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:40.120]  interface if they're actually lying but one way or the other that has now happened and the cia is
[03:14:40.120 --> 03:14:45.560]  too lazy to actually engage any humet they literally are like college fraternities that just
[03:14:45.560 --> 03:14:51.720]  stood around in smoking jackets well basically they're not qualified they don't have study psychology
[03:14:51.720 --> 03:14:56.760]  i know the farm i know what the capabilities they've lost that capability but it's the same time
[03:14:56.760 --> 03:15:02.840]  we have another structure which is incompetent dni that came out of 9 11 so if i were trump and i were
[03:15:02.840 --> 03:15:08.200]  Pompeo i would clean out the dni i don't need a directive national intelligence i would clean out
[03:15:08.200 --> 03:15:14.200]  the 18 different units of intelligence that we really don't need it's it's it's a duplication
[03:15:14.200 --> 03:15:19.640]  and trump is very good at firing at will that's exactly how private business is right now you
[03:15:19.640 --> 03:15:23.400]  always tell me lots of firing and bring people through and see what happens okay very interesting
[03:15:23.400 --> 03:15:27.400]  discussion the people should read the article about the left is flooding everything you don't have to
[03:15:27.400 --> 03:15:31.480]  be in the cia or be in the military to run for office either be a patriot you care about the
[03:15:31.480 --> 03:15:37.240]  country everybody needs to run for office speak at city council engage flood them with the truth

[03:19:51.880 --> 03:20:07.800]  info wars life dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:22.120 --> 03:20:26.920]  yeah well you know it recently emerged that hillary clinton
[03:20:28.760 --> 03:20:34.520]  openly bragged and and he was even pitching the idea that we don't care about the center of the
[03:20:34.520 --> 03:20:39.240]  country or we don't care about colorado we don't care about utah we don't care about texas we
[03:20:39.240 --> 03:20:42.920]  don't care about elandoy we don't care about indiana we don't care about oklahoma we don't care
[03:20:42.920 --> 03:20:47.960]  about mississippi louise anna we don't care about arkansas we don't care about south dakota north
[03:20:47.960 --> 03:20:55.800]  North Dakota. We don't care about Michigan. We don't care about any of it. Iowa, Ohio.
[03:20:55.800 --> 03:21:03.120]  We care about the coast and the GDP. Yeah, we know. Now, you put all the federal money
[03:21:03.120 --> 03:21:06.920]  and everything into the coast, and so you can all siphon it off. You've got the biggest
[03:21:06.920 --> 03:21:13.160]  poor populations as well. This was bad. Ex-Clinton Aides slam celebrate for Trashing Middle America.
[03:21:13.160 --> 03:21:20.080]  It seems to me she's still struggling with coming to terms how she lost and why she lost.
[03:21:20.080 --> 03:21:24.760]  Two-time failed presidential candidate Clinton went too far trashing Middle America and Trump
[03:21:24.760 --> 03:21:31.040]  supporters in her recent remarks as a former top Clinton aide. This was bad, says Patty
[03:21:31.040 --> 03:21:38.040]  Soles Doyle on Tuesday in an H&L interview. And here's the deal. You read the Wiki like
[03:21:38.040 --> 03:21:45.400]  she goes, I'm so sick of our supporters, pathetic baristas with nothing, no families. They're
[03:21:45.400 --> 03:21:49.600]  all saying they hate families. They know that's wealth. They don't want you to have a family.
[03:21:49.600 --> 03:21:53.120]  They want you all alone. But then they hate you because they don't want to give you anything
[03:21:53.120 --> 03:21:59.080]  and you're begging for it. And then the psych warfare head, one of the top Democrats at the
[03:21:59.080 --> 03:22:03.440]  university reaches out to her and he says, we'll keep them in the dark and desperate.
[03:22:03.440 --> 03:22:09.960]  And I suggest we use class warfare and Hillary's like, we already are. And he goes, intensify.
[03:22:09.960 --> 03:22:14.280]  And you've seen it, the race war narrative. Unbelievable. So let's play that clip and get
[03:22:14.280 --> 03:22:18.640]  Rodgers don'ts take on it. Here it is. Joining me now is CNN political commentator, a long
[03:22:18.640 --> 03:22:23.080]  time top aide to Hillary Clinton, Patty Soles Doyle. Patty, I'm sorry you are in a tough
[03:22:23.080 --> 03:22:28.560]  spot. I don't know Hillary like you do, but I always appreciate your honest analysis and
[03:22:28.560 --> 03:22:34.720]  insights. So based on the reaction of most people, I don't think I'm hearing this wrong,
[03:22:34.720 --> 03:22:39.480]  but you tell me, is this getting lost in translation? Cause it sounds really bad.
[03:22:39.480 --> 03:22:47.880]  Well, first, thank you so much for having me and I appreciate your honesty in how you
[03:22:47.880 --> 03:22:52.960]  feel about Hillary Clinton. Look, this, this was bad. Uh, you know, I can't, I can't sugar
[03:22:52.960 --> 03:22:59.960]  coat it. Uh, she was wrong. And clearly it's not helpful, uh, to Democrats, uh, going into
[03:22:59.960 --> 03:23:05.160]  the midterms and certainly not going into 2020. She's put herself in a position where,
[03:23:05.160 --> 03:23:10.480]  uh, Democrats are going to have to distance themselves from these remarks and distance
[03:23:10.480 --> 03:23:16.960]  themselves from her, particularly those Democrats that, uh, are running in the states that Donald
[03:23:16.960 --> 03:23:22.920]  Trump won, like Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Michigan. So I think the remarks
[03:23:22.920 --> 03:23:23.920]  were unfortunate.
[03:23:23.920 --> 03:23:27.920]  Oh, let's stop right there. By the way, I just like, I have the exclusive on type of
[03:23:27.920 --> 03:23:31.040]  bomb was used as the type of use in the Middle East. I haven't gotten to that stories on
[03:23:31.040 --> 03:23:36.320]  emphowers.com. I have the exclusive, let's get into medical record stuff, uh, about
[03:23:36.320 --> 03:23:42.920]  Hillary and the brain tumor was removed in 2013. She was gone for a year into 14, but
[03:23:42.920 --> 03:23:48.560]  reportedly the brain tumor has not grown back, but it caused damage in her middle ear and
[03:23:48.560 --> 03:23:53.320]  she has vertigo. Now people speculated that when she's wearing the anti-seizure glasses,
[03:23:53.320 --> 03:23:57.120]  but that's why when you walk, see her walk now, she has no one to give up. Man. I mean,
[03:23:57.120 --> 03:24:00.760]  even though she's tough gal, I'll give her that. I mean, she's like, whoa, on the deck
[03:24:00.760 --> 03:24:04.360]  of a boat. That's why when you see her walk out, if you ever had vertigo, never been sick
[03:24:04.360 --> 03:24:08.280]  or stuff I've had in that, you kind of like, that's how you walk. And I was in that video
[03:24:08.280 --> 03:24:11.560]  reminded me a few weeks ago, I got that from a very high level source that she's been treated
[03:24:11.560 --> 03:24:15.560]  for it and takes all sorts of medication. Uh, this is somebody from the campaign, but,
[03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:21.280]  but this is all when it plays for Roger, Roger Stone, former chief strategist and head of
[03:24:21.280 --> 03:24:24.320]  the Trump campaign. There's incredible source and obviously broke the teller should things
[03:24:24.320 --> 03:24:31.560]  said in January. He'd be out in March. Uh, he's about to take over here, but Roger, it
[03:24:31.560 --> 03:24:38.040]  just reminded me that suddenly Joy Bayharr is apologizing to the vice president for
[03:24:38.040 --> 03:24:43.920]  saying that Christians are mentally ill. Um, and suddenly everywhere they're apologizing,
[03:24:43.920 --> 03:24:46.800]  everywhere they're saying they're wrong. I think they realized they've wrecked their
[03:24:46.800 --> 03:24:51.240]  ratings so bad and that things are falling apart and they are losing and stealing elections
[03:24:51.240 --> 03:24:55.280]  isn't good enough for them unless it's Pennsylvania or, uh, you know, where they target everything
[03:24:55.280 --> 03:24:58.840]  Alabama or Pennsylvania, but then once a general election, they don't have the money, the power
[03:24:58.840 --> 03:25:02.880]  to steal it everywhere. Their, their, their donations are down. Everything's down. As
[03:25:02.880 --> 03:25:06.480]  long as we stay excited, we're going to win. So I see them kind of trying to rebuild their
[03:25:06.480 --> 03:25:11.680]  credibility now, criticizing the old Democrat guard and trying to get Hillary to fade away
[03:25:11.680 --> 03:25:17.280]  and go away, but she's so delusional. She won't go away like a horrible case of, uh,
[03:25:17.280 --> 03:25:23.160]  of, uh, syphilis or gonorrhea or herpes. Well, what's the real problem here, of course,
[03:25:23.160 --> 03:25:28.000]  is not, uh, Hillary's physicality, although that's entertaining enough. You and I were
[03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:33.880]  accused of inventing false rumors about her health when everything we said was based on
[03:25:33.880 --> 03:25:39.120]  our observations. The woman could barely walk down a flight of stairs constantly falling
[03:25:39.120 --> 03:25:45.760]  down, coughing fits, weird head agirations. This is clearly someone without the stamina
[03:25:45.760 --> 03:25:50.880]  to be president. What the real problem is, is her attitude, her elitist attitude that
[03:25:50.880 --> 03:25:56.080]  people in the middle of the country, working class people, people who aren't in LA or New
[03:25:56.080 --> 03:26:01.200]  York, couldn't possibly be right about anything. We're hillbillies. We're rednecks. We're
[03:26:01.200 --> 03:26:07.040]  nobodies or second class citizens to her. Uh, there's no, uh, money to rip off from
[03:26:07.040 --> 03:26:11.120]  us for the Clinton foundation. She has since the election,
[03:26:11.120 --> 03:26:15.040]  that's right. We're not, we're not good marks for her because I know nice folks from New
[03:26:15.040 --> 03:26:18.920]  York come down here and they think, where's the horses? I mean, they don't understand
[03:26:18.920 --> 03:26:24.320]  how sophisticated the Midwest, the South, the places are and the people. And it's really
[03:26:24.320 --> 03:26:30.640]  like a mentally ill behavior that they're so elitist. Uh, and, and, and think that Midwesterners
[03:26:30.640 --> 03:26:34.400]  and people, Midwesterners are the coolest people I know. And I love Texans, but I love
[03:26:34.400 --> 03:26:38.880]  my wife, grew up in Omaha, Nebraska. I love people from Michigan, man. I love people from
[03:26:38.880 --> 03:26:42.240]  all over this country. And I like a lot of Californians, but they're always fifth generation
[03:26:42.240 --> 03:26:46.000]  Californians. They're not the carpet baggers that, you know, tried to go there and be movie
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:50.000]  stars. I mean, you couldn't pay me to live in Los Angeles. These people have no idea,
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:54.000]  but you know, actually, Texas is horrible. Californians, you stay right there. You're
[03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:57.280]  right. We're all idiots here. There's, you know, we can't even wipe our asses. So you
[03:26:57.280 --> 03:26:58.720]  stay right there. Sorry, Roger. Go ahead.
[03:26:58.720 --> 03:27:04.560]  Uh, look, it's political snobbery. Hillary so far has blamed the FBI, Bernie Sanders,
[03:27:04.560 --> 03:27:08.800]  working people. She implies that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is a racist.
[03:27:08.800 --> 03:27:14.480]  She cannot see herself. She does understand that the voters realize that she is a mean-spirited,
[03:27:14.480 --> 03:27:22.320]  venal, greedy, selfish, entitled psychopath. And they didn't want her anywhere near the presidency.
[03:27:22.320 --> 03:27:27.120]  She's a thorn in the side to the Democrats. They would like her just to get off the stage and go
[03:27:27.120 --> 03:27:33.200]  away. She keeps reminding them of the foibles of she and her husband. She's lucky that they,
[03:27:33.200 --> 03:27:38.480]  the two of them aren't in prison. She wants to keep relitigating the last election. She cannot
[03:27:38.480 --> 03:27:46.160]  accept her defeat. But Alex, give her credit for dependability or, I should say, consistency.
[03:27:46.160 --> 03:27:51.680]  She called us deplorables before the election. She called us deplorables after the election.
[03:27:51.680 --> 03:27:58.000]  Uh, it's, it's the height of, uh, ultra left wing, bi-coastal elitism.
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:04.000]  I just can't believe she gets up in speeches and says stuff like this. And
[03:28:05.840 --> 03:28:10.480]  it's just maniac behavior. I mean, there's a lot of wonderful places all across this country,
[03:28:10.480 --> 03:28:13.600]  Northern California, one of those beautiful places in the world. And there's a lot of
[03:28:13.600 --> 03:28:17.920]  great Californians, but there's just no doubt wherever Democrats are in control,
[03:28:17.920 --> 03:28:22.880]  Detroit was the center of world industry until one Democrat got elected and it became
[03:28:22.880 --> 03:28:28.640]  a crap hole within 10 years. I mean, haven't people figured out? Collectivism really sucks, Roger.
[03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:36.000]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones show, stand by. That's right. I gotta say, Roger,
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:43.280]  you are a closed horse, but that particular suit is sharper than hell. We'll be right back. I still
[03:28:43.280 --> 03:28:45.920]  haven't gotten to the Mickey Presensky thing. I'll play that, then I'm gonna get out and let Roger
[03:28:45.920 --> 03:28:49.840]  take over and he's gonna be hosting the war room with our own own shroyer as well. Coming up,

[03:30:42.640 --> 03:30:46.880]  stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile

[03:30:50.640 --> 03:30:52.000]  against us, so we need your support.
[03:30:54.400 --> 03:30:59.680]  Infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[03:30:59.680 --> 03:31:05.040]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[03:31:05.040 --> 03:31:11.120]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:31:11.760 --> 03:31:17.760]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[03:31:17.760 --> 03:31:23.200]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[03:31:23.200 --> 03:31:29.200]  trials. And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[03:31:29.200 --> 03:31:34.880]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is
[03:31:34.880 --> 03:31:40.080]  not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the
[03:31:40.080 --> 03:31:45.280]  activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses
[03:31:45.280 --> 03:31:51.520]  in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a
[03:31:51.520 --> 03:31:58.400]  pack of our pollen block chewable tablets. I'm so excited, the new product at Infowarslife.com
[03:31:58.400 --> 03:32:05.040]  in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red
[03:32:05.040 --> 03:32:11.280]  pill. This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it,
[03:32:11.280 --> 03:32:17.600]  but boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw
[03:32:17.600 --> 03:32:22.800]  medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging
[03:32:22.800 --> 03:32:28.320]  people a hundred, two hundred dollars for the formulae. And I came up with our own formulae,
[03:32:28.320 --> 03:32:34.720]  working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:32:35.360 --> 03:32:40.640]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the
[03:32:40.640 --> 03:32:46.080]  hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands. It is amazing.
[03:32:46.080 --> 03:32:52.480]  Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:32:52.480 --> 03:33:12.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:12.880 --> 03:33:26.480]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:36.560 --> 03:33:39.280]  Every day when I get off here, I go look at infowars.com,
[03:33:39.280 --> 03:33:46.320]  prismplanet.com, newswars.com, and I go, what is your problem? You come in here,
[03:33:46.320 --> 03:33:49.600]  you've got hundreds of articles, they're all incredible. You might only cover 20 of them.
[03:33:50.240 --> 03:33:55.840]  And then look at all these big things that broke. Hey, infowars.com, newswars.com,
[03:33:55.840 --> 03:34:00.480]  go check it out. A lot of the original content at prismplanet.com and newswars.com that's not
[03:34:00.480 --> 03:34:05.920]  on infowars.com. People ask, why do you have multiple websites? Newswars is a lighter site,
[03:34:05.920 --> 03:34:10.640]  loads quicker. We're going to redesign infowars as well. Prismplanet is a very quick site.
[03:34:11.920 --> 03:34:15.680]  In the past, we got hack attacks every week and then every month and then we got bigger servers
[03:34:15.680 --> 03:34:19.600]  and better stuff. It takes money to run all this. I mean, people say, well, why don't you just leave
[03:34:19.600 --> 03:34:26.880]  YouTube if you're getting censored and Facebook? And yeah, we started putting videos up. We do
[03:34:26.880 --> 03:34:31.040]  live streams. The live streams cost us about, and I'm always haggling and getting better banned with
[03:34:31.040 --> 03:34:37.600]  about 40,000 a month just in video. I mean, when you're getting millions of people clicking on the
[03:34:37.600 --> 03:34:44.800]  streams every few days, it costs a lot of money. And then it gets worse. They censored those videos
[03:34:44.800 --> 03:34:49.760]  on YouTube. It had 4 million from the time they put it up Friday night till we came in in the
[03:34:49.760 --> 03:34:54.880]  morning. By the time I left, it was seven and a half million. And the last time I checked, it was
[03:34:54.880 --> 03:35:01.440]  like 14 million and something. And they said, do you want to, that was the next Monday. And I
[03:35:01.440 --> 03:35:07.520]  haven't looked. I just know I had to pay more than $10,000 extra just to, so sometimes that's what
[03:35:07.520 --> 03:35:13.920]  I'm saying. I'm not Google that's got access to all the backbones. I have to go through middlemen.
[03:35:14.560 --> 03:35:18.480]  And Google's hooked in with the CIA, the NSA. They basically get near free bandwidth.
[03:35:19.680 --> 03:35:23.840]  That's the big, just like Amazon gets $1.48 every package and a bunch of other goodies.
[03:35:23.840 --> 03:35:28.960]  That's how they built monopolies. They went and they got special deals. We don't have that.
[03:35:28.960 --> 03:35:34.320]  So when we do free shipping, the average package costs us about $5. We're really eating $5.
[03:35:37.280 --> 03:35:40.320]  I'm not going to belabor this. The point is, is they're trying to shut us down.
[03:35:42.160 --> 03:35:46.400]  And listeners finally get it. I mean, most of the listeners already did, but some now go,
[03:35:46.400 --> 03:35:52.080]  okay, we're now sure Jones is for real. They're everywhere saying shut him down. George Soros
[03:35:52.080 --> 03:35:57.120]  is funding lawsuits. All this stuff's happening. Georgetown is shooing him. Obama is shooing
[03:35:57.120 --> 03:36:02.880]  through a law firm he set up, Roger Stone, all hell's breaking loose. The world leaders are
[03:36:02.880 --> 03:36:10.400]  everywhere saying ban conservatives. It's here. And it feels so good to talk to the lawyers,
[03:36:10.400 --> 03:36:15.440]  to get a budget. Some of the lawyers are doing it at cost for the lawsuits I've got to file.
[03:36:15.440 --> 03:36:19.680]  They're doing it for lawsuits we're going to file or they're going to take it pro bono
[03:36:19.680 --> 03:36:26.400]  because they care and they're getting the ACLU wants to get involved and a bunch of others.
[03:36:26.400 --> 03:36:32.000]  So that's how big this is. Okay. That's how crazy this is. And you know,
[03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:35.120]  Thomas Jefferson center, all this stuff. So that's all happening.
[03:36:37.040 --> 03:36:43.520]  But this is going to take money to fight. This is a war. And I don't want to encourage them
[03:36:43.520 --> 03:36:47.360]  that these lawsuits will probably already hurt some of the new hiring and hurt some of the
[03:36:47.360 --> 03:36:53.520]  bonuses of this great crew in here. And I got other tricks up my sleeve, but I don't want to
[03:36:53.520 --> 03:36:58.320]  have to do private offerings. I don't want to have to go to my dad and say, let's sell the farm,
[03:36:58.880 --> 03:37:03.440]  which I can do. Because all it is, I love it. It's great. But it's an East Texas ever go there.
[03:37:03.440 --> 03:37:08.240]  And it's a hassle. And I need to pay taxes on it. And we don't, it's they've made it where
[03:37:08.240 --> 03:37:11.920]  agriculture isn't profitable. But it's got some minerals, which we don't get because they've
[03:37:11.920 --> 03:37:17.360]  driven them down, but you could sell it for a lot. And I'll just, I mean, I say this on air because,
[03:37:17.360 --> 03:37:21.680]  because I will get my dad to sell the farm. And I never got any money from my dad to run this
[03:37:21.680 --> 03:37:28.800]  operation. None. But he does work here because he's a really great guy and helps with the patents
[03:37:28.800 --> 03:37:31.840]  and all the rest of stuff. And I'm going to Roger. It's just, I needed to rant about this today.
[03:37:32.880 --> 03:37:39.120]  I'm totally committed because the country's the farm. And, and, and, and if we lose this,
[03:37:39.120 --> 03:37:43.440]  we'll lose everything. I'm never giving up. It's not like I go, Oh, they're tagging me. Oh God,
[03:37:43.440 --> 03:37:50.800]  I, I won't be able to stay in the nicest suite or fly first class. It's about not letting globalists
[03:37:50.800 --> 03:37:55.120]  run my life and run your life. So I need people to go to infowarstore.com and sign up for auto
[03:37:55.120 --> 03:37:58.720]  ship that these are all products. You need springs coming up with the biggest selection of non GMO
[03:37:58.720 --> 03:38:03.760]  heirloom seeds, the best selection of emergency radios, all sorts of tactical gear. We get,
[03:38:03.760 --> 03:38:08.160]  what is it, 20% off the sale of spikes tactical and all their gear. It's one of the best companies
[03:38:08.160 --> 03:38:15.840]  out there, promo code Alex. Just if you just shop with us, they're not going to be able to beat us.
[03:38:15.840 --> 03:38:20.000]  And I've already knocked out six of the 12 lawsuits, but those are just the really stupid ones.
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:25.680]  Some of these are going to cost a lot of money. And if you help us, we win. If you don't,
[03:38:26.400 --> 03:38:29.680]  they will knock us down as the lead elephant. And they're going to shut everybody else down,
[03:38:29.680 --> 03:38:33.600]  just like Matt dredge came here to warn you in the studio and here only two years ago.
[03:38:33.600 --> 03:38:40.480]  Okay. So this is it. infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one,
[03:38:40.480 --> 03:38:44.640]  three, nine. I pay Roger a salary for the great work he does. It's nothing near even his legal
[03:38:44.640 --> 03:38:48.800]  piece of peace with all the, he just wanted information suit against him in New York. Still
[03:38:48.800 --> 03:38:53.760]  cost him a ton of money. He's got Obama suing him. People say, Oh, well, you better get away
[03:38:53.760 --> 03:38:57.920]  from those guys. No, this is the fight. Just like my grandfather, you know, in the B17 or the
[03:38:57.920 --> 03:39:03.600]  Liberator before that flying in over in Italy and North Africa, and they knew where to go because
[03:39:03.600 --> 03:39:09.760]  the Germans would have their flak up and they'd see the big flak cloud of exploding shells and,
[03:39:10.400 --> 03:39:17.600]  you know, a debris falling at 300 miles an hour. And they'd fly into that flag and watch the other
[03:39:17.600 --> 03:39:21.280]  planes blow up their buddies dying everything, but they were all smiling the whole way because
[03:39:21.280 --> 03:39:26.640]  they were men. Well, then the least we can do is fly into these stupid lawsuits and George Soros
[03:39:26.640 --> 03:39:32.000]  them because here's the deal. It's going to blow up in their face. They're going to get counter sued
[03:39:33.120 --> 03:39:36.800]  and Soros can always overthrow another country and you steal their money. He has unlimited,
[03:39:37.360 --> 03:39:42.320]  but they're minions that want to be little celebs and all the rest. They're going to,
[03:39:44.400 --> 03:39:49.920]  you know, to win these things. It takes PIs. I mean, that's, we spend a lot on that. That's,
[03:39:49.920 --> 03:39:55.200]  that's how we clean people's clocks and we've got other things. Okay. So all legal and all
[03:39:55.200 --> 03:40:01.120]  lawful, but I need a bucket of money. I need, this is a war. This is 1776. I'm willing to be up here
[03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:04.640]  on the parapet though a hundred percent. I want to be here. I'm not bitching. I'm not complaining.
[03:40:04.640 --> 03:40:09.040]  I'm not saying you're not great. I'm saying I need your support because let me tell you something.
[03:40:09.040 --> 03:40:12.720]  The infiltration, the manipulation, you've all seen it in just the last month. They're letting
[03:40:12.720 --> 03:40:17.840]  me know the war is on back off and it's like, wow, I didn't have as much energy in the last decade.
[03:40:17.840 --> 03:40:22.000]  Thank you. But that's because I know we're better than them. We're going to win and I believe in
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:26.640]  you. Myco ZX plus, now stronger, now less price because we have a bigger contract with them.
[03:40:26.640 --> 03:40:30.800]  We're scaled up. So it's selling out for six months or whatever. It's very hard to procure
[03:40:30.800 --> 03:40:35.360]  organic forms of it. We've got it. It's there. A flush out them, all the different, you know,
[03:40:35.360 --> 03:40:41.280]  plant based stuff, the fungus, the mold, the yeast, get it at the back and for store.com
[03:40:41.280 --> 03:40:44.160]  and for his life.com or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[03:40:45.040 --> 03:40:48.560]  And of course we've got hundreds of other items. Just go there today and sign up for
[03:40:48.560 --> 03:40:56.080]  auto ship cancel anytime, cancel anytime. Well, I didn't know Michael ZX has a 100% recommended.
[03:40:56.880 --> 03:41:00.800]  None of other products have that. The average out of tens of thousands of reviews
[03:41:00.800 --> 03:41:05.520]  for all the products is 4.8 on power reviews and BuzzFeed did an investigation, checked it,
[03:41:05.520 --> 03:41:07.920]  put their own stuff through and found it was real and couldn't even publish the
[03:41:07.920 --> 03:41:11.920]  article I was told by power reviews. They thought it was even though they're one of the most
[03:41:11.920 --> 03:41:21.120]  respected sites, they thought somehow I'd paid them for this pathetic, pathetic from crap feed.
[03:41:21.760 --> 03:41:26.560]  So again, 25% off brain force, 25% off survival shield, 25% off secret 12,
[03:41:26.560 --> 03:41:30.880]  info or store.com, 50% off Michael ZX. Now we're going to go to break and have Roger take over here
[03:41:31.520 --> 03:41:35.040]  and he's going to take over in the war room as well. But just briefly, here's Mika Brzezinski
[03:41:35.040 --> 03:41:38.880]  freaking out seeing Trump review the wall that he's actually, she's the prototype
[03:41:38.880 --> 03:41:43.040]  and it's moving forward. So just more horror as they tell us he never wanted to be president,
[03:41:43.040 --> 03:41:46.800]  but he announces his run for 2020, keeping America great. Here it is.
[03:41:48.400 --> 03:41:53.920]  Who would think? Who would think? But getting over the top is easy. These are like professional
[03:41:53.920 --> 03:41:58.720]  mountain climbers. They're incredible climbers. They can't climb some of these walls. Some of
[03:41:58.720 --> 03:42:03.760]  them they can. Those are the walls we're not using. John, how about like mountain climbers?
[03:42:03.760 --> 03:42:07.520]  What is incredible climbers? I thought it was supposed to be see-through. Aren't they leaving
[03:42:07.520 --> 03:42:11.520]  more than they're coming? I mean, don't the numbers defy the logic of this?
[03:42:11.520 --> 03:42:16.000]  Did your daddy have some more crimination? Oh my god, I cannot believe you're going to
[03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:19.280]  kick your dad burning in hell. That was a... That's our president.
[03:42:19.280 --> 03:42:23.920]  That was a classically Trumpian spectacle of him as though he was picking out drapes
[03:42:23.920 --> 03:42:29.200]  for Taj Mahal walking down, looking at different pieces of the wall and deciding which one he
[03:42:29.200 --> 03:42:32.960]  wanted. How dare our country actually have a sovereignty? Oh my god. The ones that don't work,
[03:42:32.960 --> 03:42:37.760]  those are not the ones we're buying. Right. We're getting the ones that work, not the ones that don't work.
[03:42:37.760 --> 03:42:42.080]  Well, there you go. That's from the Third Blossoms at MSNBC who say they're not allowed
[03:42:42.080 --> 03:42:46.800]  to be criticized. It's bullying, but they call us Nazis. They're not Nazis. They're just
[03:42:46.800 --> 03:42:50.880]  cowardly little peacock scumbags. They are on the peacock, aren't they?

[03:44:58.160 --> 03:45:02.160]  you can rent any day of the week. Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and
[03:45:02.160 --> 03:45:08.400]  doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas
[03:45:08.400 --> 03:45:15.520]  as well. And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force,
[03:45:15.520 --> 03:45:19.760]  Anthroplex. My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex, too. Thank you.
[03:45:19.760 --> 03:45:23.680]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big
[03:45:23.680 --> 03:45:28.880]  normal toothpaste fans. The super blue is awesome. And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars
[03:45:28.880 --> 03:45:34.000]  Life products. They are quality. I can't wait to get some more. And thank you so much for doing
[03:45:34.000 --> 03:45:39.520]  that for us to keep us healthy. Absolutely. Because then we could all, as educated patriots,
[03:45:39.520 --> 03:45:44.880]  help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on. And if we
[03:45:44.880 --> 03:45:49.600]  can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:45:54.400 --> 03:45:59.520]  They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that
[03:45:59.520 --> 03:46:05.360]  their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award
[03:46:05.360 --> 03:46:10.880]  shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to
[03:46:10.880 --> 03:46:17.440]  endorse the resistance, all to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and
[03:46:17.440 --> 03:46:23.680]  sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and
[03:46:23.680 --> 03:46:30.000]  airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding until the only option left is for the police to do
[03:46:30.000 --> 03:46:36.000]  their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their
[03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:43.760]  outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight
[03:46:43.760 --> 03:46:51.120]  this violence of lies with the clenched fist of proof. I'm the National Rifle Association of America
[03:46:51.120 --> 03:46:53.440]  and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[03:46:57.760 --> 03:47:05.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:05.840 --> 03:47:15.040]  Let's get started.
[03:47:35.840 --> 03:48:00.160]  Welcome back, I'm Roger Stone and now sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[03:48:00.160 --> 03:48:08.240]  Well, great news out of the Trump White House today, the President will appoint CNBC Economist
[03:48:08.240 --> 03:48:16.360]  and Supply Side Apostle Larry Kudlow as the new head of the National Economic Council.
[03:48:16.360 --> 03:48:21.960]  This means that he replaces Goldman Sachs Gary Cohn.
[03:48:21.960 --> 03:48:31.240]  Now, Kudlow is a convert to the conservative cause, beginning as an aide to New York Senator
[03:48:31.240 --> 03:48:39.040]  Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Kudlow had a complete odyssey and has become the country's single
[03:48:39.040 --> 03:48:47.600]  most prominent advocate for monetary reform and tax reduction as tools for economic growth.
[03:48:47.600 --> 03:48:54.240]  It was Larry Kudlow and his associate Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation that helped
[03:48:54.240 --> 03:49:02.120]  candidate Trump formulate the single most dynamic pro-growth economic plan of any of the Republican
[03:49:02.120 --> 03:49:03.960]  candidates for president.
[03:49:03.960 --> 03:49:12.240]  Now, finally, the president has an advisor who shares his stated view for a boom economy
[03:49:12.240 --> 03:49:15.960]  through reduction of tax rates across the board.
[03:49:15.960 --> 03:49:25.240]  Now, while Kudlow is not an advocate for the president's tariffs or his talk of tariffs,
[03:49:25.240 --> 03:49:30.000]  he will not countermand his president in public as Cohn and others did.
[03:49:30.000 --> 03:49:36.400]  I think Kudlow understands that the president is using the cudgel of tariffs, the threat
[03:49:36.400 --> 03:49:41.080]  of tariffs to open the door for new negotiations.
[03:49:41.080 --> 03:49:45.760]  In fact, Kudlow knows that the president has already taken the single greatest step that
[03:49:45.760 --> 03:49:53.760]  he can take in terms of redressing the trade balance by lowering the tax rate on all businesses
[03:49:53.760 --> 03:50:01.520]  and all corporations big and small below that of the corporate tax rate in China, Mexico,
[03:50:01.520 --> 03:50:03.960]  Japan, and Canada.
[03:50:03.960 --> 03:50:05.760]  This is the true answer.
[03:50:05.760 --> 03:50:12.240]  Now, finally, we have a true blue Trumpite, someone who advocated his candidacy and helped
[03:50:12.240 --> 03:50:17.360]  with his election as the chief economic advisor to the president.
[03:50:17.360 --> 03:50:20.400]  This is extraordinarily good news.
[03:50:20.400 --> 03:50:26.920]  Now, if you've followed Infowars, you know that we were the first major news organization
[03:50:26.920 --> 03:50:32.000]  to tell you that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would be out.
[03:50:32.000 --> 03:50:37.040]  Initially, he reported that he would be out by the end of the year.
[03:50:37.040 --> 03:50:43.800]  Then I amended my report to say that after a dinner with General Mattis, General Kelly,
[03:50:43.800 --> 03:50:48.800]  and Mr. Tillerson, that the new Secretary of State would be named in March and that
[03:50:48.800 --> 03:50:51.720]  Tillerson would hold on until then.
[03:50:51.720 --> 03:50:58.200]  The firing of Tillerson gave way to perhaps the greatest headline of all time after the
[03:50:58.200 --> 03:50:59.200]  original.
[03:50:59.200 --> 03:51:05.880]  The New York Post says the worst Rex I ever had, a riff, of course, on their famous iconic
[03:51:05.880 --> 03:51:13.680]  headline regarding Donald Trump and his second wife, Marla Maples, who said it was allegedly
[03:51:13.680 --> 03:51:19.960]  the best sex she had ever had, a terrific riff there by the New York Post.
[03:51:19.960 --> 03:51:25.200]  The truth is that Tillerson and the president clashed over the Iran deal.
[03:51:25.200 --> 03:51:27.560]  The president is looking for the exit.
[03:51:27.560 --> 03:51:30.080]  He knows this is a lousy deal.
[03:51:30.080 --> 03:51:33.400]  He knows we have massively overpaid for it.
[03:51:33.400 --> 03:51:38.800]  He knows that there was cash going to the Iranians that were never made clear to the
[03:51:38.800 --> 03:51:41.920]  United States citizens, the taxpayers.
[03:51:41.920 --> 03:51:46.640]  He knows that the Iranians cannot be trusted not to cheat.
[03:51:46.640 --> 03:51:50.800]  In fact, they're most likely cheating as we speak.
[03:51:50.800 --> 03:51:55.560]  And therefore, I think the president, who knows a bad deal when he sees one, is committed
[03:51:55.560 --> 03:51:57.840]  to ending this one.
[03:51:57.840 --> 03:51:59.720]  Tillerson disagreed.
[03:51:59.720 --> 03:52:05.640]  They also clashed on the question of North Korea, where the president wants to engage
[03:52:05.640 --> 03:52:13.640]  in personal diplomacy, following it every day, carefully baiting the North Korean leader,
[03:52:13.640 --> 03:52:19.920]  alternately praising him and attacking him, but above all, bringing him to the table.
[03:52:19.920 --> 03:52:25.800]  This is a classic example of the use of what President Richard Nixon called the madman
[03:52:25.800 --> 03:52:30.800]  theory as recorded by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
[03:52:30.800 --> 03:52:33.720]  This is where your opponents fear you.
[03:52:33.720 --> 03:52:38.200]  They know that you are prepared to go to any length to smite them, and that they're better
[03:52:38.200 --> 03:52:46.480]  off negotiating than running the risk of endangering themselves by firing your ire.
[03:52:46.480 --> 03:52:52.480]  In this case, they knew that Barack Obama was a cream puff, a marshmallow, who said
[03:52:52.480 --> 03:52:56.720]  that we would draw a line in the sand and then stood back helplessly while our adversaries
[03:52:56.720 --> 03:52:58.480]  stepped over it.
[03:52:58.480 --> 03:53:06.280]  Not so Donald J. Trump, and therefore his personal diplomacy, is working.
[03:53:06.280 --> 03:53:12.560]  Those in the mainstream media, the rabid dogs now nipping at my heels with fake news about
[03:53:12.560 --> 03:53:20.080]  my association, or in this case, non-association with WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, they are
[03:53:20.080 --> 03:53:23.200]  apoplectic over the president's breakthrough.
[03:53:23.200 --> 03:53:28.240]  Only weeks ago, they were telling us about the danger of this saber-rattling, that Trump
[03:53:28.240 --> 03:53:34.480]  was trying to get us into World War III, that his policies and his approach to the North
[03:53:34.480 --> 03:53:37.960]  Koreans were too bellicose.
[03:53:37.960 --> 03:53:40.200]  Where are those carping critics now?
[03:53:40.200 --> 03:53:47.640]  Well, I'll tell you, they're busy impugning me with uncorrelated witnesses who can say
[03:53:47.640 --> 03:53:49.480]  anything they want.
[03:53:49.480 --> 03:53:53.800]  Sean Hannity is absolutely right about this.
[03:53:53.800 --> 03:53:55.640]  Journalism is dead in America.
[03:53:55.640 --> 03:54:02.080]  The idea of two sources, the idea of credibility, the idea of evidence and proof are out the
[03:54:02.080 --> 03:54:03.080]  window.
[03:54:03.080 --> 03:54:08.020]  We can file multi-million dollar lawsuits against Alex Jones in Info Wars, or against
[03:54:08.020 --> 03:54:13.680]  Roger Stone, or against Lee Strenahan, or against any number of conservative voices.
[03:54:13.680 --> 03:54:15.520]  We don't have to have evidence.
[03:54:15.520 --> 03:54:17.480]  We don't have to have proof.
[03:54:17.480 --> 03:54:21.400]  Our lawsuits can be frivolous harassment suits.
[03:54:21.400 --> 03:54:26.640]  But they're meant to endanger two engender negative headlines, and they're meant to be
[03:54:26.640 --> 03:54:33.440]  used as the rationale when the tech left tries to shut Info Wars down.
[03:54:33.440 --> 03:54:39.560]  This is why Alex Jones is being square when he tells you that this will be an extremely
[03:54:39.560 --> 03:54:41.800]  expensive fight.
[03:54:41.800 --> 03:54:49.520]  The far left has deep pockets, and the Googles, the Facebooks, the Twitters, these companies
[03:54:49.520 --> 03:54:52.560]  are awash in cash.
[03:54:52.560 --> 03:55:00.440]  Those who are suing us are backed with men like Soros and others who will finance the
[03:55:00.440 --> 03:55:02.560]  effort to try to shut us down.
[03:55:02.560 --> 03:55:05.960]  We, on the other hand, can only depend on you.
[03:55:05.960 --> 03:55:12.840]  Now, I can tell you, in my own lawsuit, where I'm being sued by an Obama backed group together
[03:55:12.840 --> 03:55:18.040]  with Donald Trump, and the acquisition is the same one that is being bandied about falsely
[03:55:18.040 --> 03:55:24.680]  in the mainstream media, that I worked with Donald Trump and the Russians to hack the DNC's
[03:55:24.680 --> 03:55:29.560]  emails and deliver them to both WikiLeaks and Donald Trump.
[03:55:29.560 --> 03:55:36.160]  Categorically, positively, false, but my legal costs are in a half million dollars today
[03:55:36.160 --> 03:55:37.660]  in increasing.
[03:55:37.660 --> 03:55:43.400]  Alex Jones and Info Wars are looking at many, many times that because they have multiple
[03:55:43.400 --> 03:55:49.560]  lawsuits that they have to beat back, which is why I implore you now to go to the InfoWars.com
[03:55:49.560 --> 03:55:50.560]  store.
[03:55:50.560 --> 03:55:58.800]  Whether it is our extraordinary products like Brain Force Plus or Immune Wall or Survival
[03:55:58.800 --> 03:56:06.040]  Shield, now at 25% off, or the Secret 12, or whether you buy a First Amendment-oriented
[03:56:06.040 --> 03:56:12.280]  t-shirt and join the t-shirt of the month club, or get a copy of my book, The Making
[03:56:12.280 --> 03:56:18.600]  of the President 2016, How Donald Trump Orchestrated a Revolution, or if you're not in the market
[03:56:18.600 --> 03:56:24.360]  for any of those things, but you want to gird us for the fight for freedom and the fight
[03:56:24.360 --> 03:56:30.120]  over the First Amendment, then go to the Donate button, which you can now find prominently
[03:56:30.120 --> 03:56:31.600]  at our website.
[03:56:31.600 --> 03:56:34.840]  Send us $25, $50, $100.
[03:56:34.840 --> 03:56:45.760]  Whatever you can send helps build our bankroll for defense, and for, as Alex Jones said earlier,
[03:56:45.760 --> 03:56:47.720]  getting on the offense.
[03:56:47.720 --> 03:56:52.960]  Let's stop defending and trying to explain away the Russian collusion question.
[03:56:52.960 --> 03:56:58.560]  Let's point out that the globalists in Hillary Clinton have engaged in enormous crimes to
[03:56:58.560 --> 03:57:05.920]  try to steal the last election and to put the neocons back in control of national policy.
[03:57:05.920 --> 03:57:11.920]  We can only count on you, and we need your help now more than ever.
[03:57:11.920 --> 03:57:17.520]  Not only do we have to pay for the expansion of our programming here at InfoWars, we must
[03:57:17.520 --> 03:57:22.040]  also pay for these enormous lawsuits.
[03:57:22.040 --> 03:57:23.640]  They're trying to bankrupt us.
[03:57:23.640 --> 03:57:25.600]  That is their strategy.
[03:57:25.600 --> 03:57:27.520]  You can help defeat them.
[03:57:27.520 --> 03:57:50.280]  Please go to the InfoWars store right now.

[03:58:15.280 --> 03:58:18.320]  every cell, tissue, and organ in the body.
[03:58:18.320 --> 03:58:23.000]  With inadequate thyroid hormones, you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight
[03:58:23.000 --> 03:58:26.040]  gain, and overall brain fog.

[03:58:45.520 --> 03:58:46.520]  Good, brother.
[03:58:46.520 --> 03:58:49.880]  Let me start using your products, everything you said about them is correct.
[03:58:49.880 --> 03:58:53.880]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:58:53.880 --> 03:58:57.320]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know
[03:58:57.320 --> 03:58:59.400]  I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:58:59.400 --> 03:59:05.200]  Supermal vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[03:59:05.200 --> 03:59:07.200]  of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:59:07.200 --> 03:59:12.360]  We do the supermal and the superfemale vitality, big changes, a lot of energy, we've gotten
[03:59:12.360 --> 03:59:16.880]  off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[03:59:16.880 --> 03:59:22.600]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated or
[03:59:22.600 --> 03:59:24.120]  maximum potency.
[03:59:24.120 --> 03:59:28.240]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a
[03:59:28.240 --> 03:59:32.680]  while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally
[03:59:32.680 --> 03:59:36.640]  going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[03:59:36.640 --> 03:59:42.320]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your supermal vitality and other powerful products
