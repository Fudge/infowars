[00:00.000 --> 00:27.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, my head is just spinning on this Friday edition.
[00:27.760 --> 00:34.000]  Look at these headlines on DrudgeReport.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:34.000 --> 00:43.320]  California plans to ban all gas cars, again that's meant to devastate our economy, shut
[00:43.320 --> 00:45.280]  down our industry.
[00:45.280 --> 00:50.200]  The electric cars take actually more energy to drive and operate and run, but the globalist
[00:50.200 --> 00:55.920]  want to cut off our gasoline and cut off our coal, then they can strategically manipulate
[00:55.920 --> 01:00.560]  the regulations and deploy only those technologies they wish to the public.
[01:00.560 --> 01:03.680]  It is a new dark age they're creating.
[01:03.680 --> 01:12.360]  Meanwhile, there's another story on DrudgeReport, Antifa plans civil war to overthrow government.
[01:12.360 --> 01:18.880]  And this isn't our words, this is video that Steven Crowder's undercover journalist got
[01:18.880 --> 01:23.440]  on the direction of the wonderful folks at Project Veritas, which by the way, that's
[01:23.440 --> 01:29.920]  the direction we're going as well, just going to let you know that on record.
[01:29.920 --> 01:39.640]  And public video and their own statements and remember a month ago, we had Mr. Hagman
[01:39.640 --> 01:44.640]  on, Doug Hagman, and he said we're doing what Veritas has done.
[01:44.640 --> 01:52.160]  We have embedded off duty and retired police officers and private detectives going to these
[01:52.160 --> 01:58.200]  meetings across the country, and they're handing out AK-47s, shanks, they're planning their
[01:58.200 --> 02:02.600]  attacks on public officials, police, and they're planning the attack coming up the next few
[02:02.600 --> 02:03.600]  months.
[02:03.600 --> 02:09.360]  Well, now we know the date, it's November 4th, and we have the videos.
[02:09.360 --> 02:19.760]  And we don't just have one or two, they're flooding in, I can't even watch them all.
[02:19.760 --> 02:24.240]  They mean business, and they're being funded by George Soros and others.
[02:24.240 --> 02:27.880]  And they think when a bunch of cops get shot in the back of the head or talk show hosts
[02:27.880 --> 02:32.680]  get attacked, or more congressmen get shot, that we're going to roll over to them and
[02:32.680 --> 02:36.880]  follow their political correctness and their globalism and gut the country, you people
[02:36.880 --> 02:39.280]  got another thing coming.
[02:39.280 --> 02:48.400]  See, we're winning politically, we're winning intellectually, and they want to overturn that.
[02:48.400 --> 02:53.000]  And they're hopping mad that the economy now is at 3.1, something they say can never happen
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.000]  again, and it's online, it current growth rate should be a 3.5 by the end of the year.
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.840]  They don't know what to do.
[03:00.840 --> 03:05.160]  And Trump gets these tax cuts through, the economy is going to roar.
[03:05.160 --> 03:07.160]  And what are they afraid of?
[03:07.160 --> 03:10.920]  They're afraid of the cornucopia of the free market.
[03:10.920 --> 03:18.040]  And they're afraid of that, and they're desperate to break this country's will now.
[03:18.040 --> 03:23.600]  These free media's dying, Democratic Party's dying, the Republican establishment's dying,
[03:23.600 --> 03:29.680]  anti-establishment candidates are winning across the board in every special election.
[03:29.680 --> 03:36.000]  Democrats are being defeated, and establishment Republicans are being routed by patriots.
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.960]  And suddenly the numbers are coming in from black groups, Hispanic groups, and others.
[03:40.960 --> 03:46.720]  They're shifting to conservative or libertarian in massive numbers as the awakening accelerates.
[03:46.720 --> 03:50.280]  The globalists push too hard.
[03:50.280 --> 03:52.560]  So what's going to happen?
[03:52.560 --> 03:57.920]  They're going to go to the violence card, and they're going to go to the false flag
[03:57.920 --> 04:00.840]  card.
[04:00.840 --> 04:03.420]  This is it.
[04:03.420 --> 04:04.920]  Get ready.
[04:04.920 --> 04:06.920]  Stunning report.
[04:06.920 --> 04:09.600]  When we come back, I'm going to go through these videos.
[04:09.600 --> 04:18.440]  I'm going to air large excerpts of Crowder's Excellent Report and his embedded journalist.
[04:18.440 --> 04:22.600]  But I really think we, folks want to work for M4 Wars, we need to vet journalists to
[04:22.600 --> 04:23.600]  get them hired.
[04:23.600 --> 04:27.400]  We've been working on it, and then deploy them to these major universities to just
[04:27.400 --> 04:35.400]  go into these meetings with Antifa, where there's men in suits and wealthy people that
[04:35.400 --> 04:36.400]  are directing this.
[04:36.400 --> 04:42.960]  I mean, this is like many other witnesses who had talked about the weathermen.
[04:42.960 --> 04:46.720]  You'd be in a room with people with PhDs, and they're calmly talking about how they're
[04:46.720 --> 04:51.160]  going to kill 25 million Americans and put another 50 million in internment camps.
[04:51.160 --> 04:52.760]  That was back in the 70s and 80s.
[04:52.760 --> 04:56.360]  And these same folks are now deeply embedded in our entire government, and they're about
[04:56.360 --> 05:01.280]  to make their move.
[05:01.280 --> 05:05.560]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes
[05:05.560 --> 05:14.680]  to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[05:14.680 --> 05:20.320]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in Info Wars live broadcasting.
[05:20.320 --> 05:26.680]  We are live weekdays from 3 to 6 PM central at infowars.com slash show, and this YouTube
[05:26.680 --> 05:29.280]  channel right here that you've landed on.
[05:29.280 --> 05:32.360]  Please subscribe to the channel for updates and notifications.
[05:32.360 --> 05:35.720]  You can follow us on Twitter at War Room Show.
[05:35.720 --> 05:39.440]  We are going to have the most powerful guest, the most powerful host, will he be hearing
[05:39.440 --> 05:44.000]  from Alex Jones regularly, as well as taking your phone calls.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.600]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[05:47.600 --> 05:50.720]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[05:50.720 --> 06:01.760]  This is The War Room.
[06:01.760 --> 06:06.120]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[06:06.120 --> 06:10.840]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[06:10.840 --> 06:12.360]  to detoxify the body.
[06:12.360 --> 06:17.200]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[06:17.200 --> 06:18.720]  It's made in the USA.
[06:18.720 --> 06:23.680]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[06:23.680 --> 06:25.480]  the body and it supports the Info War.
[06:25.480 --> 06:27.760]  It is a classical 360 win.
[06:27.760 --> 06:31.320]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[06:31.320 --> 06:36.200]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[06:36.200 --> 06:37.200]  you can possibly get.
[06:37.200 --> 06:41.120]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[06:41.120 --> 06:46.160]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[06:46.160 --> 06:51.400]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[06:51.400 --> 06:55.240]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[06:55.240 --> 06:56.240]  prayers together.
[06:56.240 --> 06:57.240]  We're changing the world.
[06:57.240 --> 07:02.240]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield InfoWarsLive.com.
[07:02.240 --> 07:07.800]  Protect Your Skin with SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion by EmRick's Essentials.

[07:12.360 --> 07:14.720]  day whenever you need sun protection.

[07:26.680 --> 07:28.880]  we do not use nanoparticles.
[07:28.880 --> 07:32.400]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.

[07:38.080 --> 07:41.000]  free sunscreen for the most sensitive skin.

[08:56.800 --> 09:02.800]  I'm rarely late getting in the chair here, but we're just revealing all this intel coming
[09:02.800 --> 09:09.360]  in and it's all directly from the enemy and it is just incredible how arrogant they are.
[09:09.360 --> 09:16.400]  It is amazing that they do not realize how criminal they are and that they believe they're
[09:16.400 --> 09:22.680]  going to be protected and they're making their move all across the United States.
[09:22.680 --> 09:28.880]  They are activating inside US intelligence, inside the US military, inside the FBI, inside
[09:28.880 --> 09:36.880]  local police, inside universities, inside factories, on farms, in schools.
[09:36.880 --> 09:42.080]  They are activating and openly coming out as communists and saying in the next few months
[09:42.080 --> 09:48.040]  they're going to start killing people en masse.
[09:48.040 --> 09:54.600]  And the president has to move against these folks.
[09:54.600 --> 09:58.400]  Reality winner, that was the name she changed as if they didn't know she was mentally ill
[09:58.400 --> 09:59.400]  and she did that.
[09:59.400 --> 10:04.760]  She had a top secret security clearance and was working with ISIS and Al Qaeda and said
[10:04.760 --> 10:08.640]  that she wanted to kill all white people.
[10:08.640 --> 10:12.480]  And then she finally was so public about it they had to arrest her.
[10:12.480 --> 10:19.360]  So what's happening is they're just leaving all these people in and all the Obama in-beds
[10:19.360 --> 10:28.000]  that are inside the government are protecting these stables of scum.
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.000]  What am I talking about?
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.120]  Here's the story on News Wars.
[10:31.120 --> 10:37.920]  Antifa Army Lieutenant radicalized under Islamist's West Point Advisor.
[10:37.920 --> 10:45.880]  South Communist planned revolution on US soil and then he announces it at West Point when
[10:45.880 --> 10:46.880]  he graduates.
[10:46.880 --> 10:55.920]  Now here's the big story, infowars.com, it's on dredgerport.com in the middle column.
[10:55.920 --> 11:05.000]  Antifa plans civil war to overthrow the government.
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.240]  Did you hear that?
[11:07.240 --> 11:13.440]  Antifa plans civil war to overthrow the government.
[11:13.440 --> 11:18.320]  And it's not Paul Watson's words, though he organizes it well.
[11:18.320 --> 11:24.640]  It's their words and a bunch of long videos from universities all over the country, Berkeley
[11:24.640 --> 11:32.320]  being of course central, saying we're getting the AK-47s, we've got the shotguns and handing
[11:32.320 --> 11:43.120]  out the knives to go stab Alan Dershowitz, anybody that tries to go speak at Berkeley.
[11:43.120 --> 11:46.880]  And they say we're not going to let you speak, we're going to kill people.
[11:46.880 --> 11:52.040]  It's not enough to walk up and hit women in the head with bike locks or men in the head
[11:52.040 --> 11:58.320]  with bike locks who just are randomly walking by, but if you look clean cut, got a book bag
[11:58.320 --> 12:02.600]  on your back, you're on a bicycle, you don't have devil tats all over you, you're going
[12:02.600 --> 12:06.720]  to get hit in the head, you're going to get shanked, you have your white by white people.
[12:06.720 --> 12:12.960]  They're almost all white people and they want to signal how much they hate white people
[12:12.960 --> 12:20.000]  so that's why they've got professors and everybody else from Baylor University at college, right
[12:20.000 --> 12:27.840]  here in Texas at Waco, to Berkeley in San Francisco, they're the radicalizers standing
[12:27.840 --> 12:34.760]  up saying whites need to be genocided, whites are inherently evil, they must be dealt with.
[12:34.760 --> 12:39.280]  And they are totally full of themselves and completely and absolutely violent.
[12:39.280 --> 12:42.680]  Now remember who was on almost a month ago, it was three and a half weeks ago, we're getting
[12:42.680 --> 12:49.520]  the video, Doug Hagman and they've launched a project Veritas type operation and he said
[12:49.520 --> 12:58.600]  we have detectives and retired police and others inside meetings in San Francisco and
[12:58.600 --> 13:11.200]  other areas and they are there saying to the world that they are preparing a violent overthrow
[13:11.200 --> 13:13.320]  sometime in November, October.
[13:13.320 --> 13:19.840]  Now why do you think the communists are suddenly uncloking themselves because after growing
[13:19.840 --> 13:24.240]  under the floorboards, they want to look like a legitimate government when they take over
[13:24.240 --> 13:28.400]  and when they call for the racial war and when they call for the uprising.
[13:28.400 --> 13:32.840]  This is a playbook and it's from them, they're saying this is happening and they're being
[13:32.840 --> 13:39.320]  allowed to prepare and gear up for it.
[13:39.320 --> 13:47.680]  What will it be in a month?
[13:47.680 --> 13:50.760]  What will it be in just a few weeks?
[13:50.760 --> 13:52.880]  What will it be?
[13:52.880 --> 14:00.800]  It's snuck up on us hasn't it, it's the October revolution that's stretched into November
[14:00.800 --> 14:08.640]  and December, it's the 100 year anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
[14:08.640 --> 14:13.280]  We're here, it's happening now.
[14:13.280 --> 14:15.160]  This is real.
[14:15.160 --> 14:16.160]  What are you going to do about it?
[14:16.160 --> 14:25.160]  It's a big question you've got to ask yourself because they mean business.
[14:25.160 --> 14:31.800]  We have to hold our fire but we have to be prepared and know they're coming over the
[14:31.800 --> 14:37.840]  line and we've got to be on target and ready.
[14:37.840 --> 14:44.560]  And everybody's got to start packing because when they strike, it'll be like fire ants
[14:44.560 --> 14:49.480]  where they crawl up over your legs, when they get in place, one of them that's leading
[14:49.480 --> 14:54.360]  and it's all genetically engineered by Mother Nature that way, stings you, releases a pheromone
[14:54.360 --> 14:57.280]  and all the others sting once they get in place.
[14:57.280 --> 15:01.680]  They communicate by pheromones and it's the same thing.
[15:01.680 --> 15:06.720]  They get all over you, they get in place and it's going to be boom, you wake up one morning
[15:06.720 --> 15:09.160]  and 300 cops are dead.
[15:09.160 --> 15:16.640]  You wake up and talk show host and members of Congress are wiped out.
[15:16.640 --> 15:24.440]  Trump towers from Chicago to New York are on fire so the police don't think they can
[15:24.440 --> 15:25.440]  respond.
[15:25.440 --> 15:31.400]  But there'll be something that happens right before that.
[15:31.400 --> 15:35.800]  A mass shooting at a school, a bombing of a federal building, maybe more, pinned on a
[15:35.800 --> 15:40.100]  right-wing patsy who's a listener of this show.
[15:40.100 --> 15:44.000]  That's why they're putting us all over the news and putting us on Comedy Central with
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.400]  all their drooling viewers to go, here's the bad guy, here's the terrorist, get ready
[15:48.400 --> 15:50.360]  for this.
[15:50.360 --> 15:52.680]  When it all happens, it's his fault.
[15:52.680 --> 15:54.600]  He made his followers do it.
[15:54.600 --> 16:03.640]  So they false flag and they'll blame Alex Jones and Donald Trump and Matt Drudge and
[16:03.640 --> 16:06.720]  Rush Limbaugh.
[16:06.720 --> 16:10.520]  And even a lot of other conservative talk show hosts will kind of halfway go along with
[16:10.520 --> 16:14.280]  it because they'll think, oh, my competition's about to get shut down.
[16:14.280 --> 16:17.120]  No idiot, you're about to get shut down.
[16:17.120 --> 16:18.120]  Bolshevik style.
[16:18.120 --> 16:19.120]  That's how it worked.
[16:19.120 --> 16:23.120]  The Bolshevik said, we've just seized Moscow, but if you turn in your guns and work with
[16:23.120 --> 16:28.720]  us as some of the other political parties, we'll let you rule with us and just help
[16:28.720 --> 16:33.160]  us get the white Russians, just help us get the Christian Russians, just help us get the
[16:33.160 --> 16:39.600]  pro-Zarist, just help us get that one group and then you're going to be fine.
[16:39.600 --> 16:43.560]  And then they just killed people with each new group of moron traders that lowered the
[16:43.560 --> 16:45.840]  drawbridge.
[16:45.840 --> 16:48.480]  So we're here.
[16:48.480 --> 16:54.720]  And I'm sure of it that this whole NFL thing was the activation of this and my sources concur
[16:54.720 --> 16:55.720]  with that.
[16:55.720 --> 16:57.840]  It's not gone well for them.
[16:57.840 --> 17:01.240]  Trump's approval rating, even with their skewed polls, is up five points.
[17:01.240 --> 17:02.960]  Some polls even higher.
[17:02.960 --> 17:04.840]  The economy's coming back on.
[17:04.840 --> 17:06.800]  They're really freaking out.
[17:06.800 --> 17:16.280]  So our revolution is funds and money and success and freedom and theirs is stabbing people
[17:16.280 --> 17:19.400]  and bombing people and shooting cops in the back of the head.
[17:19.400 --> 17:23.640]  And they think when this all happens, it'll be, oh, look, we just had our commie revolution
[17:23.640 --> 17:29.000]  because we've had enough after this white supremacist or whoever it is they set up went
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.240]  and did this horrible event.
[17:31.240 --> 17:34.800]  So now we're done, it's the uprising.
[17:34.800 --> 17:41.480]  So if there's a big terror attack that they blame on patriots or Christians or conservatives
[17:41.480 --> 17:47.480]  or independent media, that's what they want to shut down, not if, when, you'll have two
[17:47.480 --> 17:51.440]  or three days of them hyping it to get people to a fever pitch so they can make it look
[17:51.440 --> 17:52.680]  like it was organic.
[17:52.680 --> 17:57.240]  But by the second or third night, you've got to be, if you want to stop these folks, you
[17:57.240 --> 18:01.840]  got to be basically eyes and ears and they're going to hit at night.
[18:01.840 --> 18:04.600]  They're going to start at about 10 o'clock at night.
[18:04.600 --> 18:08.360]  You got to be waiting on them two to three days after.
[18:08.360 --> 18:10.080]  I don't think they're going to change their operation.
[18:10.080 --> 18:11.920]  This is too tried and true.
[18:11.920 --> 18:15.840]  You got to be waiting for them, ladies and gentlemen, because they're going to try to
[18:15.840 --> 18:19.080]  overwhelm the police forces in cities they don't control first.
[18:19.080 --> 18:22.600]  And they're going to lay them out.
[18:22.600 --> 18:25.840]  They may also do it in cities they control as they know the police chief will be involved
[18:25.840 --> 18:30.560]  in it and will order basically a stand down.
[18:30.560 --> 18:34.720]  So they're going to make their move.
[18:34.720 --> 18:38.560]  That's where everybody's on edge.
[18:38.560 --> 18:44.240]  And we've really tried to fix this as peacefully as we can.
[18:44.240 --> 18:50.200]  And if the attorney general who's completely surrounded, I know doesn't move on these forces,
[18:50.200 --> 18:55.560]  you need to understand the anti-fli idiots are just going to be the cover for the squads
[18:55.560 --> 19:02.120]  and some of the other specialized groups that they're going to be using to decapitate and
[19:02.120 --> 19:08.880]  they think intimidate and confuse Patriot government, but you better believe they're
[19:08.880 --> 19:11.720]  going to try to kill conservative Supreme Court justices.
[19:11.720 --> 19:15.200]  You better believe they're going to try to kill Judge Roy Moore, people like that.
[19:15.200 --> 19:21.040]  I mean, it's it's folks need to know they're coming for you.
[19:21.040 --> 19:29.480]  They're coming for you October is only a few days away.
[19:29.480 --> 19:35.160]  They're saying their operation launches November 4th.
[19:35.160 --> 19:41.040]  That's probably a diversion.
[19:41.040 --> 19:47.760]  I think the attacks coming in the middle of October, that's just looking at all the pieces.
[19:47.760 --> 19:53.760]  I'd say look for middle of October, but first look for a new Charlottesville, much bigger
[19:53.760 --> 19:55.720]  or a group of Charlottesville.
[19:55.720 --> 20:01.840]  That's going to be the cover for the detonation.
[20:01.840 --> 20:04.160]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[20:04.160 --> 20:09.920]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way, the bug assault,

[24:09.560 --> 24:37.120]  We're live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[24:37.120 --> 24:45.760]  On August 25th, over a month ago, a memory thought it was about three and a half weeks
[24:45.760 --> 24:53.720]  ago, Doug Hagman who runs a law enforcement training center in New Jersey has a lot of
[24:53.720 --> 24:59.720]  amazing contacts I've learned from experience in the decade plus I've been having him on
[24:59.720 --> 25:06.760]  told us that he was very concerned because from the east coast to the west coast to Illinois
[25:06.760 --> 25:15.160]  as well, they had retired police officers and private detectives that he had recruited
[25:15.160 --> 25:20.920]  through a law enforcement organization to go to hundreds of antifa meetings and that
[25:20.920 --> 25:27.360]  they were being centrally programmed by executives, very professional, high-ranking people in
[25:27.360 --> 25:35.880]  the community preparing them for a mass uprising with weapons, including open discussion of
[25:35.880 --> 25:49.960]  killing police officers, open discussion of overthrowing government, hashtag undercover
[25:49.960 --> 25:55.400]  antifa, MSM ignores video of antifa planning, stabbing and shooting attacks.
[25:55.400 --> 26:03.680]  Now that's louder with Crowder today, that's up on infowars.com but also what's happening
[26:03.680 --> 26:12.480]  is we searched antifa listed as terror organization just five minutes ago and Zach, one of the
[26:12.480 --> 26:16.920]  producers was able to recreate it so we're going to shoot a video later and upload this
[26:16.920 --> 26:23.800]  so radio listeners can see it but Google was trying to not let him go to it saying this
[26:23.800 --> 26:29.560]  is questionable information even though it was Politico that he was going to so they're
[26:29.560 --> 26:36.840]  even penalizing Politico kind of like they called up this year Forbes, Google executives
[26:36.840 --> 26:41.120]  called them and I've gotten Google calls before so as I didn't play ball I couldn't
[26:41.120 --> 26:48.560]  talk to their vice presidents anymore, I never did play ball but they said listen don't
[26:48.560 --> 26:55.440]  write articles critical of this or that or critical of antifa or you're going to be
[26:55.440 --> 27:03.880]  delisted as fake news so you have the big super internet companies, these giant monopolies
[27:03.880 --> 27:12.440]  now coming in and saying we don't even want you to get to this information, now they said
[27:12.440 --> 27:16.480]  that we're going to start doing this to restrict fake news or to tell you hey this is questionable
[27:16.480 --> 27:20.360]  content, it's not like you're on your phone and ask going to put in this number so we
[27:20.360 --> 27:25.960]  know you're a human not a bot, it's beyond that, it's keeping you from sharing virally
[27:25.960 --> 27:34.480]  and quickly even the links, there it is Google and Facebook take aim at fake news sites and
[27:34.480 --> 27:39.320]  so I guess that's Politico and the London Independent now, no they're going to cover
[27:39.320 --> 27:45.160]  for antifa just like they did in the Arab Spring covering for moracy overthrowing the
[27:45.160 --> 27:49.040]  government killing hundreds of thousands of people, they're going to protect it during
[27:49.040 --> 27:54.320]  the October revolution 100 years later but this time in America and then I've got the
[27:54.320 --> 28:00.840]  clip from Doug Hagman in late August saying we have our sources, they're embedded, we
[28:00.840 --> 28:06.640]  have this, it's been given to law enforcement and I now know he had this info and gave it
[28:06.640 --> 28:11.200]  to law enforcement and gave it to media, they wouldn't run it, same thing with Veritas,
[28:11.200 --> 28:18.000]  same thing with the great folks over at louder with Crowder, that's their big report that
[28:18.000 --> 28:24.120]  Paul reports on today, the media had this weeks ago, nightline all of them, they don't
[28:24.120 --> 28:28.200]  want to show you people saying we're handing out the weapons, we're getting ready to kill
[28:28.200 --> 28:35.560]  everybody, you're talking like real, helter-skelter, Charlie Manson level stuff nationwide, Zach
[28:35.560 --> 28:39.400]  tell folks what happened when you tried to visit mainstream news sites.
[28:39.400 --> 28:45.840]  Yes, so I was basically looking up the clip of what had happened just when the first time
[28:45.840 --> 28:50.280]  that CNN was starting to support Antifa and they were trying to ask a question about what
[28:50.280 --> 28:55.000]  it is before they were designated as a terrorist group and I remember in New Jersey, the Department
[28:55.000 --> 28:58.160]  of Homeland Security I believe was the one who did it so I went to go look it up on Google
[28:58.160 --> 29:04.200]  and I got a capture warning by Google basically saying hey there's some unusual activity on
[29:04.200 --> 29:09.880]  your Google searches, please verify if you are a robot or not, so it was very bizarre.
[29:09.880 --> 29:15.880]  And that's on a desktop computer, we're going to recreate that because it also happened to
[29:15.880 --> 29:21.640]  Ali earlier today, wow but boy was Hagman a month ago not dead on?
[29:21.640 --> 29:26.520]  No, he was absolutely dead on, he's been pretty, I mean there's been a lot that's been coming
[29:26.520 --> 29:30.760]  out slowly and subtly and you know Hagman's had a lot of good people he's been connected
[29:30.760 --> 29:35.080]  to that has been inside that he has talked to that I think the last time he was on he
[29:35.080 --> 29:39.680]  was showing documentation that he had gathered based on just meetings that they were having
[29:39.680 --> 29:46.120]  just in terms of just planning massive group rallies to block the cops from getting any
[29:46.120 --> 29:50.520]  support to right wing activists or people during any of the rallies or anything like
[29:50.520 --> 29:51.520]  that.
[29:51.520 --> 29:57.040]  It's incredible and planning violence, we'll be back with that clip.
[29:57.040 --> 30:19.920]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the second amendment must be considered
[30:19.920 --> 30:22.520]  more essential than the first amendment.
[30:22.520 --> 30:28.160]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated
[30:28.160 --> 30:33.920]  dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats, no it is just
[30:33.920 --> 30:38.680]  as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[30:38.680 --> 30:43.080]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain 10 of what the constitutional
[30:43.080 --> 30:48.760]  framers termed unalienable rights, the Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on, it doesn't
[30:48.760 --> 30:54.640]  recognize color or class or wealth, it protects not just the rights of actors or editors or
[30:54.640 --> 30:58.040]  reporters but extends even to those we love to hate.
[30:58.040 --> 31:00.720]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.

[31:18.360 --> 31:23.680]  We have now managed to secure these sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[33:56.160 --> 34:00.360]  scenes a lot is going on, a lot of intel is coming in.
[34:00.360 --> 34:06.080]  If you just joined us, Antifa plans civil war to overthrow the government.
[34:06.080 --> 34:11.920]  That's on DrudgeReport.com today right in the middle column, it's also on newswars.com.
[34:11.920 --> 34:16.800]  It's a Paul Joseph Watson article, we're going to get to that in a moment.
[34:16.800 --> 34:20.000]  You've got Stephen Crowder's undercover folks getting video.
[34:20.000 --> 34:26.080]  You've got the people at Veritas getting these similar videos.
[34:26.080 --> 34:30.920]  You've got our camera crews getting these videos out in the open, they're saying this.
[34:30.920 --> 34:38.960]  We have a flood of Antifa saying they are preparing with weapons, knives, guns to kill
[34:38.960 --> 34:43.120]  conservatives, patriots, and white people en masse.
[34:43.120 --> 34:46.840]  And ladies and gentlemen, when you go look at these crowds or these videos, 90% of the
[34:46.840 --> 34:47.840]  people are white.
[34:47.840 --> 34:52.600]  I don't want to even ask white people, I don't blame any group for what other people in the
[34:52.600 --> 35:00.720]  group do, but it's a fact that it is weird social justice warrior, crazed, self-hating
[35:00.720 --> 35:06.000]  white people that are trying to ignite a race war in America.
[35:06.000 --> 35:17.160]  Now here is Doug Hagman on August 26 on this broadcast a month ago, plus laying out his
[35:17.160 --> 35:22.360]  sources and the undercover audio and video they're getting, the full interviews an hour
[35:22.360 --> 35:23.360]  long.
[35:23.360 --> 35:31.160]  It's up on infowars.com, but it should be added to Paul Joseph Watson's article because
[35:31.160 --> 35:33.440]  this is just more proof.
[35:33.440 --> 35:37.760]  So here is a clip of Private Investigator Doug Hagman.
[35:37.760 --> 35:43.480]  Briefly, for those just joining him, essentially we have a handful of investigators across
[35:43.480 --> 35:49.200]  the country, specific cities infiltrating, investigating and infiltrating these fascist
[35:49.200 --> 35:50.200]  groups.
[35:50.200 --> 35:52.920]  They've successfully done so in many cases.
[35:52.920 --> 35:58.440]  The latest report early this morning, 410 Eastern time this morning saying, look, there's
[35:58.440 --> 36:04.640]  one particular meeting in San Francisco so well organized, the tactics, the training
[36:04.640 --> 36:12.680]  being very professional, the age of people there range from late 60s, perhaps early 70s,
[36:12.680 --> 36:15.160]  all the way down to late teens.
[36:15.160 --> 36:18.480]  This is the resist fascism movement.
[36:18.480 --> 36:21.280]  That's what they're calling themselves, but it's actually a fashion report says it's
[36:21.280 --> 36:22.520]  a lot of professionals.
[36:22.520 --> 36:24.680]  These aren't just the average method.
[36:24.680 --> 36:26.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[36:26.680 --> 36:32.000]  These are above the, these are the people who are sending out the cannon fodder.
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.000]  This the idiots you see in the street with the baseball or the bicycle helmets on and
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.000]  the baseball bats.
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.840]  I mean, those people are the useful idiots, the, you know, hire a stooge for a day or
[36:42.840 --> 36:45.200]  two and go out there and take a few wax.
[36:45.200 --> 36:46.200]  Okay.
[36:46.200 --> 36:47.440]  That's who those people are.
[36:47.440 --> 36:48.760]  These people are the planners.
[36:48.760 --> 36:51.720]  These people are the architects of the chaos that we're seeing the brains.
[36:51.720 --> 36:53.080]  And yeah, exactly.
[36:53.080 --> 36:57.240]  However, they're bringing in these, these professionals to teach.
[36:57.240 --> 37:02.680]  As you said, the weapons self-defense force multiplying a revolutionary group.
[37:02.680 --> 37:03.680]  Yep.
[37:03.680 --> 37:04.680]  Yeah.
[37:04.680 --> 37:05.680]  Yeah.
[37:05.680 --> 37:09.200]  So it goes on, he breaks it all down, the plans to use weapons.
[37:09.200 --> 37:12.840]  And now we have hours of video.
[37:12.840 --> 37:21.160]  So no one can say this is edited of just private meetings on the streets, just pouring in and
[37:21.160 --> 37:25.440]  you go out to these things and they run over and scream, die, F you.
[37:25.440 --> 37:27.200]  They pour coffee on you.
[37:27.200 --> 37:29.440]  They have their kids doing it.
[37:29.440 --> 37:31.080]  This is what they're doing out in the open.
[37:31.080 --> 37:37.320]  You imagine the frothing, insane hate and you think, well, so what if Tom Brokaw calls
[37:37.320 --> 37:38.320]  you a total racist?
[37:38.320 --> 37:39.440]  You know what he believes him?
[37:39.440 --> 37:40.440]  Yeah.
[37:40.440 --> 37:45.280]  90% of people know that's bull, but there's a good 10% that literally think they are Captain
[37:45.280 --> 37:47.640]  America fighting Red Skull.
[37:47.640 --> 37:53.560]  In fact, more and more, they're showing up, they've put real comics out showing Captain
[37:53.560 --> 37:57.800]  America beating up the Tea Party a few years ago and I'm one of the people Captain America
[37:57.800 --> 37:58.920]  beats up.
[37:58.920 --> 38:07.720]  And these people read it, they show up as live action roleplayers and they just start
[38:07.720 --> 38:14.640]  attacking men, women and children because they believe, take that Hitler.
[38:14.640 --> 38:18.400]  So three years ago, they'd all go out to a park and have simulated battle with each other
[38:18.400 --> 38:29.880]  with rubber swords and rubber spears dressed like elves and goblins, good fun, driven by
[38:29.880 --> 38:33.080]  and seen it at parks and got out and watched, it looks like they're having a good time.
[38:33.080 --> 38:34.080]  But see, here's the deal.
[38:34.080 --> 38:39.840]  They're not just playing Dungeons and Dragons, you know, in a field.
[38:39.840 --> 38:47.080]  They're now, ladies and gentlemen, believe they're battling Red Skull.
[38:47.080 --> 38:50.320]  Now we can make jokes about the chirping goblin that attacked me and the media even tries
[38:50.320 --> 38:51.320]  to spin it.
[38:51.320 --> 38:52.320]  Oh, it's fake.
[38:52.320 --> 38:55.200]  Oh, Jones just goes out there and it just happens.
[38:55.200 --> 39:00.160]  I shot more than 20 videos on the streets of Seattle when I was there for a week.
[39:00.160 --> 39:02.560]  I shot him live, a lot of you watched him.
[39:02.560 --> 39:07.680]  Every time I went out, somebody said F you or got in my face or threatened to attack
[39:07.680 --> 39:08.680]  me.
[39:08.680 --> 39:12.280]  One time when a camera went rolling, I walked out of a restaurant and the guy acted like
[39:12.280 --> 39:16.520]  he was going to hit me with his Range Rover.
[39:16.520 --> 39:19.720]  I had to jump out of the way and I thought, did that guy try to just hit me and rolls
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.440]  the window and goes, if you, and I couldn't help it, I just said, man, get out of the
[39:24.440 --> 39:25.440]  car.
[39:25.440 --> 39:27.520]  He goes, he thought he was real tough.
[39:27.520 --> 39:29.760]  I said, just get out.
[39:29.760 --> 39:30.760]  Just go ahead.
[39:30.760 --> 39:34.160]  So you know, you get folks with Tats, you know, had big muscles and Tats all over me.
[39:34.160 --> 39:35.160]  He was going to show off.
[39:35.160 --> 39:39.360]  I said, you're a coward thug punk just because your politics on your, you're not going to
[39:39.360 --> 39:40.360]  get out of that car.
[39:40.360 --> 39:43.880]  So I said, get out and say that to my face right now.
[39:43.880 --> 39:50.000]  So he drove down the street while I was walking, calling me a, all these names, calling me
[39:50.000 --> 39:51.000]  gay.
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.000]  Oh, I thought you're so liberal.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  Oh, I'm Alex's gay.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  So let's put him down.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.880]  He called me the pejorative terms.
[39:58.880 --> 40:05.560]  And of course my response to somebody does that's always say, I'm a Russian agent.
[40:05.560 --> 40:06.560]  Yeah.
[40:06.560 --> 40:07.560]  Or you say I'm gay.
[40:07.560 --> 40:08.560]  Okay.
[40:08.560 --> 40:09.560]  Yeah, I am.
[40:09.560 --> 40:10.560]  You say I'm Jewish and that somehow is bad.
[40:10.560 --> 40:11.560]  Okay.
[40:11.560 --> 40:12.560]  I'm Jewish.
[40:12.560 --> 40:13.560]  And let's just move forward.
[40:13.560 --> 40:14.560]  It doesn't matter though.
[40:14.560 --> 40:17.040]  I'd be proud of my was I'm going to go to Israel.
[40:17.040 --> 40:18.040]  I want to see Israel.
[40:18.040 --> 40:21.320]  They're going to say, I went there to get my orders.
[40:21.320 --> 40:26.040]  I can't live in this world of these mentally ill people where they want to dictate and
[40:26.040 --> 40:27.240]  try to bully me into submission.
[40:27.240 --> 40:30.680]  I'm not going to sit there and go along with it, but I'm digressing.
[40:30.680 --> 40:32.600]  They're planning a civil war.
[40:32.600 --> 40:33.960]  They're pushing it in the NFL.
[40:33.960 --> 40:39.240]  This is all being directed and they want to make it racially based where if you're not
[40:39.240 --> 40:44.560]  a liberal, that means you're a Nazi, so you deserve to be beat up, you deserve to be fired,
[40:44.560 --> 40:50.160]  you deserve to be thrown out by your landlord, you deserve to be killed.
[40:50.160 --> 40:52.960]  It's called a cultural revolution.
[40:52.960 --> 40:54.120]  It's a male model.
[40:54.120 --> 41:01.920]  You go to UT where they have the Red Guard that openly marched with AK-47s in Austin.
[41:01.920 --> 41:07.520]  They've told me to my face, you wait till revolution starts, you're dead, Jones.
[41:07.520 --> 41:12.520]  And they've been beavering away behind the walls like termites forever.
[41:12.520 --> 41:18.240]  And now they're just spilling out.
[41:18.240 --> 41:25.120]  Imagine you are an officer, just graduated from Army's West Point, and at graduation
[41:25.120 --> 41:30.000]  you have a hat saying communism will win.
[41:30.000 --> 41:35.400]  They've got the big banks, they've got the mainstream media, they've got everything.
[41:35.400 --> 41:39.720]  And they believe they're invincible.
[41:39.720 --> 41:43.680]  And that's why they're coming out in the open, because they're getting ready to D-day.
[41:43.680 --> 41:46.240]  They're getting ready to launch their attack.
[41:46.240 --> 41:53.480]  Antifa Army Lieutenant radicalized under Islamist's West Point advisor, Dan Lyman, newswars.com.
[41:53.480 --> 41:56.000]  What an important article.
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.320]  Developed communist planned revolution on US soil.
[41:58.320 --> 42:01.040]  He's saying violence, we're going to kill people.
[42:01.040 --> 42:02.440]  We're getting ready to do it.
[42:02.440 --> 42:04.280]  He's prepared to lead the attack.
[42:04.280 --> 42:09.600]  He's wearing a Shagovara shirt underneath his dress uniform.
[42:09.600 --> 42:14.840]  And he was taught this at West Point.
[42:14.840 --> 42:18.840]  The US Army Lieutenant exposed himself as a radical communist on Twitter last week, prompting
[42:18.840 --> 42:23.040]  a firestorm in the new media, and the deep dive into his background revealing that he
[42:23.040 --> 42:26.320]  was closely mentored by an Islamist's professor.
[42:26.320 --> 42:30.560]  Look at the former CIA director, look at the former intelligence director.
[42:30.560 --> 42:32.200]  All of them are Wahhabis.
[42:32.200 --> 42:37.360]  You can't make this up, sorry, a deep dive into his background revealing that he was
[42:37.360 --> 42:42.400]  a closely monitored by an Islamist's professor at West Point.
[42:42.400 --> 42:47.000]  Infowars was one of the first to break the story of Second Lieutenant Spencer Rapone
[42:47.000 --> 42:52.240]  who posted photos of himself in dress uniform flashing a sign that red communism will win
[42:52.240 --> 42:57.400]  and proudly bearing a Shagovara shirt beneath his military jacket, even though Shagovara
[42:57.400 --> 43:01.080]  said Mexican Indians were cockroaches.
[43:01.080 --> 43:03.760]  Rapone is now under a former military investigation.
[43:03.760 --> 43:08.040]  But not for what he was wearing, the stuff on his Facebook says the violence is coming,
[43:08.040 --> 43:12.520]  get ready, we're going to kill capitalists.
[43:12.520 --> 43:18.080]  It has been discovered that Rapone's cadet advisor was Dr. Rashid Hossin, a man with
[43:18.080 --> 43:20.520]  whom Rapone grew close.
[43:20.520 --> 43:26.440]  They reportedly traveled to India together, oh good lord.
[43:26.440 --> 43:30.800]  According to examinations of Rapone's online history, his metamorphosis into an anti-American
[43:30.800 --> 43:36.080]  revolutionary appears to sync with the development of the camaraderie with Hossin.
[43:36.080 --> 43:37.080]  I can't read anymore.
[43:37.080 --> 43:39.280]  Go read it for yourself and see all the evidence.
[43:39.280 --> 43:41.040]  It's up to you to get this out.
[43:41.040 --> 43:45.800]  And this is just a snapshot of one of these roaches, one of these termites coming out
[43:45.800 --> 43:53.360]  in the light, little arrogant demon, talking about how much he hates America, how much
[43:53.360 --> 43:58.680]  he wants to walk around in our blood.
[43:58.680 --> 44:02.400]  You know what really isn't good about this is that these people aren't even worth fighting,
[44:02.400 --> 44:10.520]  except we have to, but I mean there's no, if it comes to a shooting war it's like, they're
[44:10.520 --> 44:16.800]  not even a worthy opponent, they're just trash, but it's just taken out the garbage.
[44:16.800 --> 44:19.080]  Taken out the garbage.
[44:19.080 --> 44:22.800]  I mean let's take a look again, we can make jokes about this, but this is an actual chirping,
[44:22.800 --> 44:27.320]  gibbering goblin creature that attacked me with coffee, imagine when the green light
[44:27.320 --> 44:34.320]  comes for violence, what these chirping, hopping creatures will do, here it is.
[44:34.320 --> 45:00.320]  Yeah, I'm your mama, I'm your mama.
[45:00.320 --> 45:17.360]  This is, this is it right here, literal slave of the system, look at you, this is what they
[45:17.360 --> 45:40.240]  turned the people into, literal slave of the system, look at the slave.
[45:40.240 --> 45:44.680]  There's hours of this up on info wars dot com, but here's five minutes of the undercover
[45:44.680 --> 45:51.520]  report from lateralcrowder.com, antifa plans civil war, the government is where you find
[45:51.520 --> 45:57.120]  it on drugsreport.com, you gotta go read this because there's a bunch of videos, this is
[45:57.120 --> 46:01.480]  just one of them from around the country, the revolutionary communist website, the main
[46:01.480 --> 46:06.160]  socialist groups, all of them say November 5th and they're already blocking roads, we
[46:06.160 --> 46:13.800]  have video of that in California, in LA, another area saying get ready, it's coming.
[46:13.800 --> 46:19.080]  So they want violence, they want death, and remember no matter how many people they attack,
[46:19.080 --> 46:22.760]  whatever, you fight back, you're gonna be a horrible person in the news.
[46:22.760 --> 46:30.320]  So the scum of the earth is now coming out of their dungeons, out of their little minion
[46:30.320 --> 46:35.520]  holes, everybody should be aware of it, here is part of that report, remember this was
[46:35.520 --> 46:42.560]  all given to the media weeks ago, we reported it a month ago plus from our sources, this
[46:42.560 --> 46:47.000]  was all given to the media, just like all the election fraud news, all of it, and they
[46:47.000 --> 46:55.320]  chose not to run hours of this sensational stuff, and the police are doing nothing, because
[46:55.320 --> 47:01.600]  that's American pie now, is dirty communist and antifa fascists that want to go out and
[47:01.600 --> 47:04.960]  hurt people, and they're planning violence and mass murder.
[47:04.960 --> 47:10.760]  See nowadays, Charlie Manson wanted this back in the 60s, nowadays Charlie Manson would
[47:10.760 --> 47:14.360]  be a congressman, he'd get up there and talk about killing white people and how they're
[47:14.360 --> 47:18.600]  the devil, or black people, or vice versa, with a swastika between his crazy eyes, helter
[47:18.600 --> 47:25.040]  skelter, and they'd say, oh, make that man a congressman, here it is, the media is playing
[47:25.040 --> 47:30.320]  clothes, and some tactics, and I don't think they'll know how to, because they're not prepared
[47:30.320 --> 47:31.320]  for it.
[47:31.320 --> 47:34.320]  Okay, you're gonna take the knife, thanks.
[47:34.320 --> 47:38.880]  In order to get in with the antifa crowd, we had to infiltrate their private groups,
[47:38.880 --> 47:42.560]  their news broke that they were officially classified as a domestic terrorist organization,
[47:42.560 --> 47:45.600]  they pulled everything in much closer to the chest, they started vetting people, becoming
[47:45.600 --> 47:49.400]  paranoid about spies, they demanded we meet with them in person, installing a cryptic
[47:49.400 --> 47:52.320]  messaging app onto our phone, which they used to organize.
[47:52.320 --> 47:57.280]  So I just met with the guy, and he installed a super secret encrypted messenger app on my
[47:57.280 --> 48:04.240]  phone, and they immediately took roll call, using all pseudonyms, such as firebird, ski
[48:04.240 --> 48:09.120]  mask, Xevious, Xevious, yeah, everyone except for Will.
[48:09.120 --> 48:14.600]  Yes, Will, whom we immediately identified on Facebook, will also boast it of his sawed
[48:14.600 --> 48:18.920]  off shotguns, and armory in his trunk, at least that's what he said.
[48:18.920 --> 48:26.560]  I have a tool that looks like a bulls***, do you have a new gun?
[48:26.560 --> 48:35.720]  I have a, like, on the border between just a regular rifle and a sword weapon and a sawed
[48:35.720 --> 48:36.720]  off style shotgun.
[48:36.720 --> 48:37.720]  Yeah, like last ditch here?
[48:37.720 --> 48:43.880]  At least you were with the gun on the side, on the driver's side, that's the one.
[48:43.880 --> 48:49.200]  So remember, just as the local authorities will remember, this is Will, what happened
[48:49.200 --> 48:50.200]  to you, Will?
[48:50.200 --> 48:57.200]  Well, I've got, I've got a, yeah, I've got two AKs coming, if you go down to, like, the
[48:57.200 --> 49:00.400]  military, the Serpilstone, the Navy Serpilstone, whatever, you can get, like, a K-bar, for,
[49:00.400 --> 49:05.200]  like, 30, 40 bucks, and it's just a combat knife, it's a fixed blade, five inches or
[49:05.200 --> 49:08.400]  so, but it's just, you strap it on your leg, and you're good to go, which means this one's
[49:08.400 --> 49:10.520]  like, tiny, so you have to really stab them a little bit.
[49:10.520 --> 49:11.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[49:11.520 --> 49:14.880]  Yeah, like, last ditch is gonna be, or I'm down here.
[49:14.880 --> 49:19.480]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold, luring people to their cars with sawed off shotguns and handing
[49:19.480 --> 49:21.560]  out knives and shives.
[49:21.560 --> 49:25.400]  This went far beyond a goof, and we needed to get Nakajirid out of there.
[49:25.400 --> 49:26.680]  Good thing the man's got a quick mind.
[49:26.680 --> 49:28.680]  Is there a place to sh** around here?
[49:28.680 --> 49:29.680]  I don't know this campus.
[49:29.680 --> 49:30.680]  Into the right?
[49:30.680 --> 49:31.680]  All right, I'll be right back.
[49:31.680 --> 49:32.680]  You guys gonna be here in a few minutes?
[49:32.680 --> 49:35.120]  Yes, at the risk of being called to snitch, Nakajirid immediately turned the footage
[49:35.120 --> 49:39.000]  over to the authorities, who were already aware of our presence there, by the way.
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.960]  Turns out they'd been tracking this pansexual slash transgender queer with an axe to grind
[49:43.960 --> 49:46.720]  for a while, and they were grateful for our footage.
[49:46.720 --> 49:52.560]  The media, on the other hand, who you think would jump on a story like this, well, their
[49:52.560 --> 49:55.720]  response is what's most disturbing of all.
[49:55.720 --> 49:58.720]  He was just down there at President's Circle, and they were handing out sharp objects to
[49:58.720 --> 50:01.200]  stab people with, so they had someone coming with an AK.
[50:01.200 --> 50:06.200]  Why did it take two late night hosts, comedians, to find this out?
[50:06.200 --> 50:07.560]  You know what, I wish you guys luck.
[50:07.560 --> 50:12.760]  Even being shown the footage in the presence of police officers to confirm authenticity,
[50:12.760 --> 50:13.920]  they walked away.
[50:13.920 --> 50:18.320]  Also, I should note, this is Dan Harris from Nightline, National ABC News.
[50:18.320 --> 50:20.560]  He knew about the footage in the whole story, too.
[50:20.560 --> 50:23.480]  I offered it to him and asked for his card.
[50:23.480 --> 50:24.920]  He did not give it to me.
[50:24.920 --> 50:28.040]  We were delivering a story to local and national news.
[50:28.040 --> 50:30.520]  All right, folks, we're gonna come back with more of this.
[50:30.520 --> 50:35.920]  Again, this is amazing, and by the way, Crowder's a real comic who's actually doing real news.
[50:35.920 --> 50:39.720]  You've got all these fake comics that then poses myself every night to misrepresent what
[50:39.720 --> 50:45.200]  we stand for and call us racist so that mentally ill people that they're winding up then kill
[50:45.200 --> 50:46.200]  us.
[50:46.200 --> 50:47.200]  That's what this is.
[50:47.200 --> 50:52.880]  This is a build-up towards revolution, a build-up towards a new October revolution with a one-hundredth
[50:52.880 --> 51:00.160]  anniversary coming up in just a week.

[37:35.700 --> 54:41.440]  have Ted Malik who used to be the highest levels of the globalist system
[54:41.440 --> 54:46.480]  but from the American perspective believing America should be engaged globally to help
[54:46.480 --> 54:50.680]  the planet but for a long time, more than a decade, he's been actually speaking out
[54:50.680 --> 54:54.960]  against them and of course was basically thrown out of their ranks.
[54:54.960 --> 54:58.640]  He's going to be joining us for 30 minutes in the next hour.
[54:58.640 --> 55:02.960]  I'm the type of guy that really doesn't build stuff up, I always just cut right to the chase.
[55:02.960 --> 55:08.320]  I should have been saying this from the very beginning of the broadcast, Brandon Tatum
[55:08.320 --> 55:14.920]  who's got, I can't even count it all up, it was like 55 million views this week on a couple
[55:14.920 --> 55:24.720]  of his videos and he's an army veteran, he's a police officer, he's a former champion athlete,
[55:24.720 --> 55:30.920]  really smart guy and I mean he's a way better speaker than I am at just crystallizing it
[55:30.920 --> 55:37.680]  all down and we're excited about him going to be on the broadcast.
[55:37.680 --> 55:41.880]  In the third hour and we're flying him here next week, he's gonna be in studio with us
[55:41.880 --> 55:46.160]  so I'm telling you I'm sure he's a great cop but the guy needs to have a career on
[55:46.160 --> 55:53.680]  TV and radio and it's just amazing so he's got the video breaking down how ridiculous
[55:53.680 --> 55:59.200]  the NFL is and just in six minutes does what I do in like an hour, just boom, boom, boom,
[55:59.200 --> 56:04.920]  I mean it's like a perfect 10, he just lays it logically out calmly but focused with a
[56:04.920 --> 56:11.320]  little bit of anger, it's a hole in one and all his videos are great so he's gonna be
[56:11.320 --> 56:19.200]  joining us live coming up, that is quite a lineup for you today and then of course we
[56:19.200 --> 56:04.920]  have Jack
[56:04.920 --> 56:33.320]  the fourth hour.
[56:33.320 --> 57:01.720]  Don't you want to see that tonight?
[57:03.320 --> 57:09.840]  obviously. So please, buy a lot of products from InfoWarsStore.com. They're game-changing
[57:09.840 --> 57:18.080]  supplements and nutraceuticals. Really great. InfoWars.com, ball hats, shirts. But we got
[57:18.080 --> 57:21.960]  Molan Labe shirts, you know, so much more. If you want to make a stand for free speech
[57:21.960 --> 57:26.520]  and wear a Trump's My President shirt, then that's great. Or an InfoWars.com shirt. We've
[57:26.520 --> 57:30.800]  also got them that, you know, just say Molan Labe. And little communists won't know what
[57:30.800 --> 57:33.840]  that is because they're so stupid and won't stab you in the back. But they really are
[57:33.840 --> 57:38.400]  trying to intimidate everybody right now into submission. We've got CNN's fake new shirts.
[57:38.400 --> 57:45.000]  We have the new Daiglo Hunters InfoWars.com hats from Richardson. Best quality out there
[57:45.000 --> 57:51.280]  in my view. Everybody loves the hats. We've got the InfoWars.com hats also with the snake.
[57:51.280 --> 57:55.560]  In fact, I saw a match wearing one of them in there in the control room. You might show
[57:55.560 --> 58:00.760]  a camera shot of that. It's a very nice hat. I wear it myself. So again, InfoWarsLife.com

[58:48.680 --> 58:51.840]  We need your help.
[58:51.840 --> 58:56.880]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information. And in the
[58:56.880 --> 59:01.400]  last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the
[59:01.400 --> 59:06.920]  elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases
[59:06.920 --> 59:12.720]  had much better nutrition than we do today. And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[59:12.720 --> 59:18.040]  of the animals that they were hunting, killing and then processing. And so I set out to develop
[59:18.040 --> 59:24.560]  caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood
[59:24.560 --> 59:31.200]  ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time. InfoWars isn't
[59:31.200 --> 59:36.160]  just fighting the globalist. We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of
[59:36.160 --> 59:42.440]  the complete media assault and winning because of your support. Caveman is back in stock.

[59:47.600 --> 59:53.680]  by calling toll free, triple A 253-33139.
[59:53.680 --> 1:00:15.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex
[1:00:15.160 --> 1:00:26.000]  Jones on info wars.com. There's a live feed of the show up there, video feed. Look at
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:31.520]  the comments. They're just the best. NFL ratings are dropping faster than Bill Clinton's pants
[1:00:31.520 --> 1:00:38.920]  and Arkansas trailer part. And then look at this latest Ben Garrison. We got to get him
[1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:44.640]  back on. Here's the latest Ben Garrison cartoon. It's got the Equality Team San Francisco
[1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:53.240]  Pinky Niners, the Indianapolis Ingrates sitting on the American flag, the Tennessee Tantrums,
[1:00:53.240 --> 1:01:03.520]  the Denver Virtue Signalers, the Cleveland Reds, the Carolina Concussions, the Seattle
[1:01:03.520 --> 1:01:11.280]  Snowflakes. Ben Garrison is the best. And I've been a big fan of political cartoons.
[1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:16.800]  They even had in Roman times that they have imprints and paintings of. And they made some
[1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:20.920]  jokes back then. And then there were a lot of famous cartoons in our country's history.
[1:01:20.920 --> 1:01:25.760]  And I actually own quite a few books that are volumes of them. But I mean, Ben Garrison,
[1:01:25.760 --> 1:01:33.320]  I think, from what I've seen is the greatest editorial cartoonist in history. Not just
[1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:37.720]  because I agree with him. He's more prolific. We got better tools nowadays than pen and
[1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:41.320]  ink drawing and then having to print it out. I mean, granted, he's got better tools than
[1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:49.560]  they had before. But he's the best. And there's all these other amazing ones. But wow. Look
[1:01:49.560 --> 1:02:00.760]  at that. Indianapolis Ingrates. But you know, what's really funny is that they really thought
[1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:05.760]  they could force feet. Everybody go along with this. You know, it's not funny, though.
[1:02:05.760 --> 1:02:11.440]  The propaganda may be failing, but it's only meant to wind up their own minions to go out
[1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:20.240]  and start race wars. And to go out and start massive attacks. And to go out and start a
[1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:25.520]  cover for the deep state to move against Trump. So it looks like it's organic. So their plans
[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:32.040]  not going well. Looks like a monkey. You know what in the football is they used to say.
[1:02:32.040 --> 1:02:37.960]  Still, we shouldn't underestimate it and know they're planning on launching. Because it's
[1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:41.680]  not just idiot, you know, college folks, they're talking about how they're going to have got
[1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:46.720]  knives and weapons. It's our reports from folks embedded that it's far more than that.
[1:02:46.720 --> 1:02:53.200]  They are talking about stabbing people and, you know, and it's happened. The issue is
[1:02:53.200 --> 1:02:57.080]  they're trying to foment it as the cover. I'm not saying that they could actually overthrow
[1:02:57.080 --> 1:03:03.840]  the country. But they're used as the cover. This is a breaking report, Fox News. Trump
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:11.520]  delays Air Force One to call officer injured in motorcade crash. An officer got hit. President
[1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:15.560]  Donald Trump delayed Air Force One's departure from Indianapolis on Wednesday until after
[1:03:15.560 --> 1:03:19.720]  he was able to talk with the motorcycle officer who crashed in the motorcade. The airport
[1:03:19.720 --> 1:03:23.080]  initial reports said Trump called the officer during the flight back to Washington within
[1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:27.920]  Indianapolis. Metropolitan Police tweeted Thursday the president delayed the flight.
[1:03:27.920 --> 1:03:32.360]  The thing is, every time he does this, the media says either he didn't do it or he didn't
[1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:36.640]  care. Most of the time you don't know when Trump does stuff like this, the personal touch.
[1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:42.360]  The point is Obama didn't used to do stuff like this. I mean, he wouldn't even visit
[1:03:42.360 --> 1:03:48.520]  a hurricane hit area. Hillary wouldn't even do it. And then they go, oh, but you didn't
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:54.160]  go to Puerto Rico and you didn't send help when he had sent help. But granted, the military
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:04:00.960]  is completely Florida alone has it overtaxed. Texas, you don't hear about Texas anymore.
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:05.320]  Mexico's been hit by all these earthquakes. They couldn't send help anymore. Puerto Rico
[1:04:05.320 --> 1:04:10.640]  is a possession of the US. It's totally covered in water basically still in many areas and
[1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:17.160]  has no power. What are you going to do? That's why civilization is so tenuous. And if we
[1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:22.880]  have a civil war or something along those lines or a depression, 90% of people lived
[1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:28.160]  in rural areas in the Great Depression. Look it up. And about half of those were self-sufficient.
[1:04:28.160 --> 1:04:34.720]  So about 45% of folks were totally self-sufficient. Now it's less than 5% and 10% live rural.
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:41.360]  The numbers are basically flipped. You have a real depression. It will be a meltdown,
[1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:50.640]  crazy time event. Think about that. Think about that long. Think about that hard and
[1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:56.440]  why we should all be trying to prop civilization up while at the same time trying to get something
[1:04:56.440 --> 1:05:00.440]  ready.
[1:05:00.440 --> 1:05:05.480]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their
[1:05:05.480 --> 1:05:11.080]  Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright
[1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:16.400]  ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation. Those are the words of John Adams,
[1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:21.200]  the second president of the United States. Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[1:05:21.200 --> 1:05:26.240]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency? Do you understand how a private corporation
[1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:31.360]  has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it? What kind of leverage
[1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:36.200]  do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American people? Or for that matter,
[1:05:36.200 --> 1:05:41.040]  what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money? Will you be a slave or will you
[1:05:41.040 --> 1:05:46.040]  be free? Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among
[1:05:46.040 --> 1:05:51.040]  the people. Join the InfoWars. Spread the information. Educate yourself and others.

[1:08:24.320 --> 1:08:31.320]  Early on a freezing cold morning in 1776 in Philadelphia, a 47-page booklet was published
[1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:40.880]  that would go on to change world history. The publication was called Common Sense and
[1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:47.380]  its author was Thomas Paine. The pamphlet contained clear truths, clear to all right
[1:08:47.380 --> 1:08:53.360]  thinking rational persons, and the common sense uniting them into a useful whole. Like
[1:08:53.360 --> 1:09:00.360]  that powerful expression of American consciousness, today we need another jolt of common sense.
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:07.440]  This time in business, today, responsible purposeful business leaders are taking up
[1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:14.360]  this mantle in the laying claim to the phrase Common Sense Business. This book is about
[1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:21.360]  restoring faith in the market and wealth creation. It sets up a dramatic tension and then promises
[1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:28.360]  the reader a better way. The true secrets to enduring success and it does it in real life
[1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:35.120]  using dramatic case study examples. Will you join all those who are showing us how, why
[1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:42.120]  and where common sense business is being executed? More importantly, do you want to know how
[1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:51.320]  you can do it too? And that's the new book, already a best
[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:56.720]  seller common sense business by our guest Ted Malik. And again, Ted Malik is one of
[1:09:56.720 --> 1:10:01.000]  those names I remember 20 years ago going, look at the globalist at the Aspen Institute
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:05.600]  and look, he's one of the executive board of the World Economic Forum. But a lot of
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:09.800]  people have been in that system trying to promote Americana, trying to promote free
[1:10:09.800 --> 1:10:16.800]  market and for over a decade he's been one of the main leaders helping really expand
[1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:21.240]  the amount of people in the establishment you could say that realize the way globalism
[1:10:21.240 --> 1:10:26.800]  got set up is dead on arrival. You've seen Peter Thiel and many others say the tide is
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:32.520]  going out on globalism because it was authoritarian, it was crowning capitalist, it was centralized
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:38.600]  and it was greedy and wanted to create austerity for other groups and peoples to consolidate
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:43.560]  control, to create a world of renters instead of a world of owners. They could have ruled
[1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:48.360]  the world. They were in the position to do it. They were already doing it, but they killed
[1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:53.800]  the golden goose. That's my perspective, but it's great to get Ted Malik on with us, Ted
[1:10:53.800 --> 1:10:59.080]  Malik.com. I'm going to go over his entire bio and all those bestselling books and top
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:03.880]  advisor to top companies and CEOs and again, serve as the executive board of the World
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:08.560]  Economic Forum. That's the most important meeting in the world. I mean, it's like a
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:14.320]  public Bilderberg meeting, Bilderberg itself is even according to Ted, is just a joke these
[1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:19.440]  days. And of course, he's been a senior policy position, the U.S. Senate committee on farm
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:22.920]  relations in the U.S. State Department. I'm not going to go over his PhDs and all the
[1:11:22.920 --> 1:11:30.560]  books and the rest of it and how he is the spiritual enterprise research. He is the research
[1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:36.080]  professor at Yale University. He also co-directs the project Practical Wisdom for Management
[1:11:36.080 --> 1:11:40.800]  for the spiritual and philosophical traditions along with the, I'm not going to go over all
[1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:45.940]  the rest of it from Yale. The point is, he knows all the big kingpins and he's here telling
[1:11:45.940 --> 1:11:54.000]  you that globalism is falling apart. So what are the globalists doing right now then? Trying
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:12:00.240]  to create racial division, trying to create divide and conquer, trying to kill nationalism
[1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:06.680]  that's springing up from Catalonia to the United States from Brazil to the Middle East.
[1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:11.640]  Why are they trying to kill organic, free market awakening when that's what's always
[1:12:11.640 --> 1:12:16.600]  made us all wealthier, happier and better? I mean, they admit many of their elite publications,
[1:12:16.600 --> 1:12:22.800]  they're losing and that there's a total reversal. So why are they doubling down or am I wrong?
[1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:27.920]  Well, it's great to be with you, Alex, and to see you even from over here across the
[1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:33.640]  ocean. I wish I could be with you physically in Texas, but this is the next best thing,
[1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:39.640]  technology and the one that's technology. You are so right, so spot on. I said a few
[1:12:39.640 --> 1:12:46.240]  months ago that Davos Man is dead. He's certainly dying and we have to put some nails in that
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:52.440]  coffin. Peter Thiel who you mentioned says the tide of globalism is going out. So you
[1:12:52.440 --> 1:12:58.840]  see all over the world and I was really excited about Trump's speech at the UN where he talked
[1:12:58.840 --> 1:13:06.320]  about national sovereignty, literally I think 17 times in that one speech. The world is
[1:13:06.320 --> 1:13:12.160]  moving back. The pendulum is swinging back to free peoples and to the nations in which
[1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:19.960]  they participate. Wow. So from your own words, I said to me asking my noxious questions,
[1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:25.160]  where are we historically? How do we get there? Where are we going? Who are the players? What's
[1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:31.360]  this kind of look like? Well, I think we're in the throes of the storm. So by no means
[1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:38.720]  is this a determined, you know, reality. We don't have the next world yet. I think we're
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:46.320]  in a throw of great change. So you saw Brexit first as a barometer event and Nigel has been
[1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:50.680]  on your show. Of course, he's a very good friend of mine. That's Nigel Farage recently
[1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:57.920]  in Alabama celebrating another victory there. So you had that swing in Britain and then
[1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:04.480]  soon thereafter you had the, at least from some perspectives, the unbelievable and unexpected
[1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:10.200]  election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States. And then you had a number
[1:14:10.200 --> 1:14:17.760]  of elections in Europe where these nationalist parties did as well or better than many people
[1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:24.360]  expected. And just last week in Germany, you had an alternate political party basically
[1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:31.960]  transform the entire German political landscape such that we won't really have a Merkel power
[1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:38.080]  in Europe anymore. That new government will have to be put together on a coalition basis.
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:42.480]  And the AFD, which is the name of the party, the alternative for Deutschland, will be the
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:48.840]  opposition party. This is a altogether new reality. I'll predict here on your show today
[1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:52.960]  that next March we'll have a new nationalist government in Italy.
[1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:57.800]  Wow. And again, our media spun it, corporate media spun it that it was another win for
[1:14:57.800 --> 1:15:01.640]  Merkel. But right there, if you look at the demographics and you look at the numbers of
[1:15:01.640 --> 1:15:05.520]  a parliamentary system, I know most of our audience understands that, but you might explain
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:12.440]  to them that once she becomes fractional, now other fractional parties can now basically
[1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:17.720]  dictate a lot of change. So this is the beginning of the end of the current wave of, I would
[1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:23.920]  say anti Europe, anti West, really communists that have been running the EU.
[1:15:23.920 --> 1:15:28.840]  Well, we don't know what will happen in the EU yet. I think that don't you think if Germany
[1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:33.760]  starts falling to nationalism and free market again, won't that signal the whole EU?
[1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:39.720]  Well, one can only keep their fingers crossed and hope that's the case. So we have in France,
[1:15:39.720 --> 1:15:44.600]  someone who wants to double down on the EU bet. And certainly Merkel would have been
[1:15:44.600 --> 1:15:51.320]  his logical and likely partner to basically reintegrate the European countries to bring
[1:15:51.320 --> 1:15:56.600]  forward those institutions and make it not just a trading club, but a political entity
[1:15:56.600 --> 1:16:02.320]  threatening America on every front, by the way, that's less likely to happen today after
[1:16:02.320 --> 1:16:07.600]  the election in Germany, because she's going to be focused really on keeping Germany together
[1:16:07.600 --> 1:16:11.720]  and putting her coalition together. Exactly, not selling Germany out to prop up the euro,
[1:16:11.720 --> 1:16:16.200]  not selling Germany out to keep this failed deal. And so failing forward the EU, you might
[1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:21.760]  tell folks is you're the expert on it falling apart. So now it wants an EU army total control.
[1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:26.560]  Its answer to people trying to pull out of it is police state, just like Catalonia, but
[1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:31.800]  on a bigger scale, correct? Absolutely. Just a week and a half ago, we had the president
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:39.240]  Jan Klodzonker give a speech in Brussels where he basically gave his scenario for the future,
[1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:47.720]  which is a totally unified, totally integrated, totally statist, anti-capitalist, pro-socialist
[1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:55.600]  Europe, with an even closer unification than it has today. And clearly that is not something
[1:16:55.600 --> 1:17:02.160]  that certain players in Europe like Poland, possibly Spain, and most certainly the UK,
[1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:08.920]  which thankfully has voted to lead the European Union, wants to suffice. So we're going through
[1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:17.080]  the throes of the Brexit now and the negotiations, and the EU is being very punitive against
[1:17:17.080 --> 1:17:22.280]  our ally, the United Kingdom. So as they try to extricate themselves from this union, it's
[1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:28.560]  looking very difficult, very costly, and of course, there are many remainers still in
[1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:36.120]  the UK. What did you make of the arrogant Juncker, a literal top Nazi heir whose family
[1:17:36.120 --> 1:17:42.000]  took over Luxembourg? I mean, he still has these duchies that he controls. He's this
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:51.280]  fossil, this throwback to something even beyond royalty, but just a kleptocratic family that's
[1:17:51.280 --> 1:17:56.280]  been perched on Europe for centuries. And then he threatens Trump, threatens America,
[1:17:56.280 --> 1:18:01.760]  and makes statements about how the EU with Communist China will be able to stop America's
[1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:09.240]  recovery and get Trump back in line, dictating to us like he'd already captured us, like
[1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:13.520]  his grandfather and father captured Luxembourg. I mean, this is a guy that really thinks he
[1:18:13.520 --> 1:18:15.200]  owns the world.
[1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:23.520]  Well, he is the crony of the Germans and of Mrs. Merkel. So in a sense, this whole cabal
[1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:31.720]  in Europe is a German conspiracy. I have some difficulty saying this, but it is almost like
[1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:39.040]  Germany has gained, through the EU, what it couldn't obtain in the Second World War.
[1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:45.000]  So they're controlling Europe, they're controlling the currency, they're controlling the institutions.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:52.520]  Here is a crony of Merkel. And basically, it's an organization that works to benefit
[1:18:52.520 --> 1:18:57.920]  Germany and its interests, which are not the same interests, obviously, of other nation-states
[1:18:57.920 --> 1:19:03.160]  in Europe. And most certainly, and I say this, of course, as somebody who has been close
[1:19:03.160 --> 1:19:08.800]  to this over the last number of years, not something that the Americans should take lightly.
[1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:14.760]  We should look at this EU as a real challenger, and not just as a benign, friendly state.
[1:19:14.760 --> 1:19:17.040]  Here is actually a challenger.
[1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:21.720]  And people overuse the Nazi thing, but Junker really is the heir to the second most powerful
[1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:26.880]  family in Germany during World War II, top Nazis, the Junker aircraft that bombed England
[1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:31.120]  and Russia and everything else were made by his family. And he really is bringing forward
[1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:36.240]  a EU project that has been declassified, as you know, was a Nazi program. They wanted
[1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:42.800]  a European Union. So he's just carrying on the family project, second most powerful family,
[1:19:42.800 --> 1:19:48.520]  arguably the most powerful Nazi family in World War II. And they run the EU, folks.
[1:19:48.520 --> 1:19:52.480]  Now, he basically thinks he owns Europe. He thinks he owns America. And this is the type
[1:19:52.480 --> 1:19:58.000]  of scum that we're facing. But we have patriots like our guests from the inside that are dynamiting

[1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:40.800]  Ted Malik, tedmalik.com, is our guest. He's got a new book out. We're going to talk about
[1:24:40.800 --> 1:24:43.880]  coming up in the next segment. And if you want to talk to somebody that's been at the
[1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:48.400]  highest levels of the Davos Group, somebody that knows all the big world leaders, knows
[1:24:48.400 --> 1:24:53.360]  what the globalist plan was, and from the inside has been opposing it for over a decade,
[1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:57.080]  Ted's the guy to talk to, and it's just fascinating. We should have him on for like 3 hours someday
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:25:02.320]  if that doesn't exhaust him. But this is a short segment. What hits me so hard is for
[1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:07.040]  decades, going back to Barry Goldwater and Ron Paul and myself and many others, they
[1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:11.600]  would make jokes like, there's no globalism, there's no new world order, while they were
[1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:16.760]  teaching and at colleges, while they were preparing it, and now that hoax has collapsed,
[1:25:16.760 --> 1:25:21.160]  and as soon as that hoax collapsed, it's game over. But if they would have just been building
[1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:26.200]  a real global community with a future to empower everybody, everyone would be for it, because
[1:25:26.200 --> 1:25:31.200]  that's obviously the logical next step. And I just don't get that they're doubling down
[1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:36.160]  with violence and with Marxist in Europe and here and calling for violence and calling
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:42.400]  everyone Nazis that doesn't want to be part of this when literal Nazis launched their
[1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:49.720]  current EU-centric spoke to control globalism. So bottom line, there's a fight over who controls
[1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:54.920]  globalism, there's globalism in the economy that exists already, then there's globalist,
[1:25:54.920 --> 1:26:01.360]  two separate things in my view, but it's just such an amazing time to be alive and to realize,
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:05.600]  as you said, this is the beginning of the renaissance or the break away from it. I guess
[1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:11.120]  my question or my rant is this, can they still defeat us? Are we being arrogant about the
[1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:14.680]  total tide shift? What are they planning from your best research?
[1:26:14.680 --> 1:26:19.960]  Well, I don't think they're sitting on their hands. I think they have every intention to
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:27.160]  try to defeat us. You see that on the streets, you see that in the media, you see that in
[1:26:27.160 --> 1:26:32.080]  certain corporations who are captive to these globalists. So I don't think by any means
[1:26:32.080 --> 1:26:36.920]  they're going to go away, as Steve Bannon says, without putting up a fight. So we have
[1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:42.600]  to be equally adept in actual street fighters and take them on. And I think that we've been
[1:26:42.600 --> 1:26:46.360]  doing that and it scares the bejesus out of them.
[1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:49.680]  Okay, I've been asking the questions. We've got a few minutes left in this segment. We'll
[1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:54.880]  get into your book in the next. But what else is big on your radar as we see the collapse
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:26:58.440]  of the capsizing of globalism?
[1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:06.840]  Well, I think that you see them trying to take over all the institutions, of course,
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:12.400]  of our civic life, whether it's the schools, whether it's the culture, whether it's the
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:18.280]  media. I obviously spend most of my time with corporations as the corporate strategists.
[1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:24.880]  They've actually had an attempt over the last 20 odd years to have globalists as CEOs of
[1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:31.400]  all these companies, or many of these companies, such that they then have transnational corporations
[1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:37.440]  who have no attention then to the places where they do business. They're bigger and stronger
[1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:41.880]  and in their views better than the people who inhabit those places.
[1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:48.080]  So really a corporate coup through corporate governance, but not to even empower free market.
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:52.440]  What would you call the system they were building? Kind of a technocracy where they're exempt
[1:27:52.440 --> 1:27:55.440]  from the socialist hell they put us under?
[1:27:55.440 --> 1:28:01.360]  Well, they are elitists in every sense, and some of the rules that they make, they don't
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:06.840]  want to be bound by themselves a little bit like the US Congress. But yeah, they've built
[1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:12.800]  a system where they can fly around on their private jets, and at the same time talk about
[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:19.560]  climate change, and at the same time basically form a kind of crony capitalism pretending
[1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:28.040]  it could be philanthropists giving away other people's money. So it's a very nice lifestyle.
[1:28:28.040 --> 1:28:32.760]  Basically there are a bunch of crooks that have bought off the establishment media and
[1:28:32.760 --> 1:28:36.000]  built themselves as angels.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:40.480]  And that's why people like you, Alex, are so dangerous because you expose this. You and
[1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:45.640]  Drudge and all the other people on this side of the equation, and people who are in fact
[1:28:45.640 --> 1:28:52.560]  trying to defend free market capitalism, those people actually have to continue to make this
[1:28:52.560 --> 1:28:57.280]  case. And we have to, and I think there are more years listening to what you're saying
[1:28:57.280 --> 1:28:59.760]  day in and day out.
[1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:05.280]  Common sense business. We're going to break, but I certainly want to read this book just
[1:29:05.280 --> 1:29:09.920]  in 40 seconds. Why have you become, in the last 30 years behind the scenes, one of the
[1:29:09.920 --> 1:29:12.480]  top corporate advisors in the world?
[1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:19.080]  Well, I like to think that I'm trusted by people with some analytical capacities, some
[1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:25.080]  good character, and some ideas that actually have come to fruition. But I frankly have
[1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:29.200]  had the good luck and good fortune to be at the right place at the right time. I've had
[1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:34.440]  very good mentors, and I would like to say God has been on my side.
[1:29:34.440 --> 1:29:38.320]  I certainly don't want to be on the side. The globalists are on. What a sad group of
[1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:41.800]  people. Boy, I tell you, we're going to talk about it all. The book. Take a feel your phone
[1:29:41.800 --> 1:29:47.400]  calls of Mr. Malick straight ahead. I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com. We'll be right back.
[1:29:47.400 --> 1:29:54.960]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:54.960 --> 1:30:03.240]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, where an excess of power prevails,
[1:30:03.240 --> 1:30:08.520]  property of no sort is duly respected. No man is safe in his opinions, in his person,
[1:30:08.520 --> 1:30:13.160]  in his faculties, or in his possessions. Is there any question that we have an excess
[1:30:13.160 --> 1:30:17.760]  of power in Washington? The only question is, how do we contain it? And how do we remove
[1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:24.120]  that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual? That is the ultimate concern.
[1:30:24.120 --> 1:30:28.880]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the
[1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:33.240]  founders of this country. It was why the anti-federalists opposed the Constitution. They believed
[1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:37.240]  they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power, but as
[1:30:37.240 --> 1:30:42.040]  James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance. The people
[1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:47.280]  who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[1:30:47.280 --> 1:30:51.320]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints
[1:30:51.320 --> 1:30:56.320]  upon them are. Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.

[1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:04.280]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information. And in the
[1:32:04.280 --> 1:32:08.840]  last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the
[1:32:08.840 --> 1:32:14.360]  elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases
[1:32:14.360 --> 1:32:20.160]  had much better nutrition than we do today. And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:25.480]  of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing. And so I set out to develop
[1:32:25.480 --> 1:32:31.440]  Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other super
[1:32:31.440 --> 1:32:38.640]  food ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time. InfoWars isn't

[1:33:23.040 --> 1:33:32.200]  I remember it's by a year ago or so. Dr. Jerome Corsi, who's got a bunch of number one best
[1:33:32.200 --> 1:33:37.120]  selling books and has a lot of great connections, a great guy, really hardworking fellow. He's
[1:33:37.120 --> 1:33:41.080]  recent Trump even found out about Arpaio and he got the pardon was, of course, he wrote
[1:33:41.080 --> 1:33:46.960]  articles that Drudge picked up. He said, Yeah, I want to get Ted Malicon and you know, big
[1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:51.680]  heavy hitter advising corporations and part of the Davos group and all the rest of it.
[1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:55.400]  He's been fighting globalism from the inside for a long time. I remember going and looking
[1:33:55.400 --> 1:34:00.800]  on Ted Malik. I mean, that's got it like ran the big was an Aspen Institute. It was
[1:34:00.800 --> 1:34:05.000]  one of the main members organizing Davos that became the most powerful group in the world
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:09.400]  and connected to all the big heavy hitters. And I knew he'd always promoted free market
[1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:12.800]  and stood up for American sovereignty. And there were good people in the system because
[1:34:12.800 --> 1:34:16.280]  as we really begin to win, folks, we have to understand we're going to have a lot more
[1:34:16.280 --> 1:34:21.840]  folks in the system that once they're able to really stand up and do more are are going
[1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:22.840]  to appear.
[1:34:22.840 --> 1:34:27.200]  We're also going to see people who we think are our friends. They're going to turn on
[1:34:27.200 --> 1:34:30.220]  us because of their being blackmailed. They're being threatened. I mean, if you knew the
[1:34:30.220 --> 1:34:33.880]  stuff I've been through and I'm not complaining, I asked for this, but let me tell you, it's
[1:34:33.880 --> 1:34:38.400]  like a James Bond movie, except I'm not as good looking as James Bond. And you know,
[1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:42.520]  I follow my ass. I mean, the stuff they pulled the things they've done and a lot of people
[1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:47.160]  hear that and say, oh my gosh, I better not do anything. It's fine. Okay. And it's better
[1:34:47.160 --> 1:34:52.960]  than being a slave. But what I'm getting in here is as we get control of the government
[1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:57.960]  and as we turn the economy back around, that's we the people. As we go back to the Americana
[1:34:57.960 --> 1:35:01.720]  system where it's not about elitism, it's about what you actually do and what you produce
[1:35:01.720 --> 1:35:02.720]  and what you stand for.
[1:35:02.720 --> 1:35:09.160]  As we become more chivalrous again, we get ready to win, folks. This whole hoax, this
[1:35:09.160 --> 1:35:15.400]  whole spell we've been under is a good allegory of being under this control can be lifted
[1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:19.920]  and Trump's trying to lift it. He's real. They tried to demoralize us where we believed
[1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:24.600]  that there was nothing real. Let me tell you, it's been patriots in the Council on Foreign
[1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:30.200]  Relations and in the CIA and in the big universities that have known about this, who've been getting
[1:35:30.200 --> 1:35:38.120]  information out forever and that have basically made sure that globalism now is falling apart.
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:44.120]  And that's because globalism proved it was a fraud, the globalism of the globalists.
[1:35:44.120 --> 1:35:47.840]  Not global trade or global connections or global agreements. And so this whole system
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:54.600]  of secret TPP and screwing America over and dominating the host country is now coming
[1:35:54.600 --> 1:35:58.840]  to an end to a great extent. It doesn't mean things are going to be perfect. We're not
[1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:04.240]  like communists that offer some utopia, but I'm ranting. Let me stop now. It's just that
[1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:08.160]  this is a big crossroads. So before you get into your book and the toll-free numbers,
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:13.040]  you can take a few calls, 410 Malik specifically, 800, we don't screen on there, maybe some
[1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:23.400]  trolls, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, first-time callers, talk to a guy who academically and
[1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:28.760]  business-wise is at the highest levels and who has been strategically involved, according
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:34.600]  to all my sources, helping bring down this current authoritarian globalism. So you want
[1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:38.040]  to know who helped kick the switch. We the people, all of us together, one of the key
[1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:43.120]  people there helping kick the switch to reverse the tide is Ted Malik. And we have to understand
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:47.760]  that we need to want people to come from the inside and fight it. But he didn't just flip
[1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:53.280]  sides the last five years. I learned about what he was doing six, seven years ago. I
[1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:58.000]  just didn't know how extensive it was. And that from over a decade, he's been fighting
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:02.880]  the globalist plan. But if you talk to him, he's been doing it since the beginning. So
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:06.400]  thank God we've had folks that have been inside. So can you spend a few minutes just talking
[1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:12.320]  about your evolution, your awakening, how they sold globalism, when you went from just
[1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:18.560]  being somebody working inside that structure for American values to somebody that was actively
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:23.200]  fighting against it? What was that process like that happened overnight? Was it instantaneous
[1:37:23.200 --> 1:37:30.080]  or did it happen over a long period of time? Well, I think in my case, if we're talking,
[1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:36.680]  you know, and I have a personal memoir, so you know, you can read about it in all of
[1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:44.960]  its great detail. It's called Davos, Aspen and Yale, My Life Behind the Elite Curtain
[1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:53.480]  as a Global Sherpa. I basically, even as a young person and as an intellect growing up
[1:37:53.480 --> 1:38:01.280]  around Bill Buckley and Firing Line and National Review and the Great Books, was always inside
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:08.680]  the argument about conservative ideas, certainly about religion and culture, and about free
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:16.080]  market. So there was no turning point for me, no conversion. I happen to have had good
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:21.280]  fortune to be invited into a number of places that were prominent, I guess, establishment
[1:38:21.280 --> 1:38:28.920]  terrarium. But even in those places, I tried to be, as the Bible says, light and salt and
[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:35.200]  to try to bring them into some kind of reason. That was oftentimes a frustrating experience
[1:38:35.200 --> 1:38:40.080]  and there were certainly very strong countervailing forces. Sure, but as a critic, I mean, you
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:44.000]  became very, very prominent, I guess, as being a critic, which is an example to folks that
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:50.280]  are just yes men in a world of yes men. It's better to be a critic when something's corrupt.
[1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:55.560]  I think you have to. Otherwise, you have no moral character, no backbone whatsoever. So
[1:38:55.560 --> 1:39:01.840]  you have to be able either to say no or to stand up or to criticize something or if you're
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:05.680]  an academic. But you become more of an aggressive critic the last five, six years just from
[1:39:05.680 --> 1:39:10.880]  what I've seen on the radar screen. I mean, is that accurate? It is accurate that I have,
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:17.560]  I would say in the last 10 years, and thanks to some mentors and some foundations, been
[1:39:17.560 --> 1:39:22.640]  able to write books that are much, much more critical than at an earlier point in your
[1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:27.560]  career where, you know, you're frankly trying to make a buck or get promoted or get to the
[1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:33.840]  next round. So we're all guilty of that kind of careerism. But at this point, I mean, I'm
[1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:39.120]  able and willing. And of course, I've been doing this, both on shows like this and in
[1:39:39.120 --> 1:39:44.400]  print to tell the truth about where we are and how we got there.
[1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:46.200]  Have they tried to punish you?
[1:39:46.200 --> 1:39:54.600]  Well, I mean, they've tried to politically assassinate me. Certainly, there are people
[1:39:54.600 --> 1:40:00.560]  in the American system, but more in the European side who see me as their archenemy. They certainly
[1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:05.920]  didn't want me to be ambassador for Trump in the European Union because I would have taken
[1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:11.360]  them on and I would have made his case. What they want and still want, they don't have
[1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:17.320]  an ambassador yet, is someone who will make their case back to the Americans and to Trump
[1:40:17.320 --> 1:40:23.240]  as opposed to someone who will represent the American perspective and the American national
[1:40:23.240 --> 1:40:30.040]  opinion in Europe. So yeah, there are a lot of forces, particularly in the media, who
[1:40:30.040 --> 1:40:35.440]  take us on, who try to pigeonhole us and categorize us and make us out to say things that we're
[1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:42.240]  not saying. But they're particularly fearful of me because I know them from the inside.
[1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:47.880]  That's right. In fact, I mean, I've seen the horrified reports and then now, I mean, they
[1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:51.480]  wish he would just shut up, but the more they tell you to shut up, the more you speak. And
[1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:55.560]  it seems like the bullying, don't they get across the board, just the Trump supporters
[1:40:55.560 --> 1:41:01.120]  or nationalists or free market folks, that their no holds barred bullying has now only
[1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:06.120]  really gotten a lot of people off the couch and into a very, very aggressive stance. I
[1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:12.600]  think they took our kindness for weakness. Well, I mean, we have, I think fought back
[1:41:12.600 --> 1:41:19.680]  more so in this last period. And a lot of that I think is precipitated by the Brexit
[1:41:19.680 --> 1:41:28.440]  situation in the UK. And by Mr. Brexit himself, I've mentioned Nigel LeFarge, Nigel Farage
[1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:36.160]  here, but even more so in the world team by Donald Trump. So he is the persona, I think
[1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:40.800]  that has really transformed the landscape. So you're looking at my bookcase right behind
[1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:46.800]  me. I'm very proud to have in one of these frames a letter from the Socialist Party and
[1:41:46.800 --> 1:41:52.560]  the Communist Party of the European Parliament that says I should be made, Ted Malick should
[1:41:52.560 --> 1:41:59.040]  be made persona non grata, that I should not be able to have a political or a diplomatic
[1:41:59.040 --> 1:42:02.640]  appointment to their European Union. And that's what I remember. I was, I was stretching
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:06.680]  back in my memory that, that that major political parties as communists for a major party in
[1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:11.820]  Europe folks are like trying to have you banned saying you're not fit to serve basically
[1:42:11.820 --> 1:42:17.880]  banning you from public life. Oh, they would, they would enjoy it if we would go away and
[1:42:17.880 --> 1:42:23.360]  just go back and sit on our hands and if they could take you off the air and stop the publications
[1:42:23.360 --> 1:42:29.360]  of other publications and then they could just go back to business as usual. But that's
[1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:33.560]  not the case. You know, they've approached radio stations we're on and that offered
[1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:38.440]  them huge sums of money to take us off through other programs. And they go, oh, we don't
[1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:42.080]  want that show. They go, don't worry, any show, not even our show just get him off.
[1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:45.600]  And I've learned behind the scenes. They're doing stuff, you know, even at the network
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:50.240]  level, the sabotage to, to, oh, you don't want Alex anymore to carry, carry something
[1:42:50.240 --> 1:42:54.120]  else. Yes. Yes. I'm aware of that. I just let folks know. So it's, it's, it's definitely
[1:42:54.120 --> 1:42:59.000]  hit next level. It's so intense. And I think as libertarians or conservatives or just Christian
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:03.360]  patriots, we don't tend to want to whine and say, oh, look, we're under attack. It's almost
[1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:07.120]  like it's an honor to be under attack. It is. But the listeners and viewers need to know
[1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:11.240]  they don't want us speaking. They need to understand just getting our articles, our videos, your
[1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:16.760]  book, getting these materials out is a revolutionary act. Here's an example. This is up on newswars.com
[1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:22.400]  with Don Salazar, also prisonplanet.com. It's very important to get this out because we
[1:43:22.400 --> 1:43:25.360]  were just talking about how they want to ban him from service. There's a lot of folks want
[1:43:25.360 --> 1:43:31.400]  to try to have him be an advisor or an ambassador to the European Union via the United States.
[1:43:31.400 --> 1:43:38.400]  First talked about that. Speaking of his book, common sense business, we're talking about
[1:43:38.400 --> 1:43:42.800]  the moment. Librarian rejects racist Dr. Seuss book donated by Melania Trump. Yes, because
[1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:49.320]  she donated it at an event. They don't now want the book period. Even if it's not the
[1:43:49.320 --> 1:43:56.400]  book, she even donated. It's because she donated the book. It now by extension is racist and
[1:43:56.400 --> 1:44:01.080]  he had to ban colleges, you know, called Lynch or halls called Lynch, a Cambridge, Massachusetts
[1:44:01.080 --> 1:44:05.200]  librarian, refused several Dr. Seuss children's books donated by first letting Melania Trump
[1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:14.720]  claiming the content is steep in racist propaganda. And it's all the places you'll go where a
[1:44:14.720 --> 1:44:20.680]  bear like creature gets to visit the world and excites kids about the future of the world.
[1:44:20.680 --> 1:44:26.720]  So now cartoon characters are now racist. This this is mass insanity. What do you make
[1:44:26.720 --> 1:44:35.280]  of this Ted Malik? Well, this is clearly a political act. I mean, she was making a donation
[1:44:35.280 --> 1:44:40.560]  of children's book. I mean, innocent children's book. We all grew up reading these books and
[1:44:40.560 --> 1:44:45.240]  giving them to a library and this library. And I'm not saying she's an unqualified librarian,
[1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:49.920]  but she's, you know, she's a cultural Marxist and she's basically saying, we don't want
[1:44:49.920 --> 1:44:55.600]  any of these gifts because they're coming from you. And then she makes all these categorical,
[1:44:55.600 --> 1:45:00.080]  you know, comments and she wants the power to ban whatever she wants, when she wants.
[1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:04.520]  And that's why the so cultural Marxists, as you just said, pick asinine things because
[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:09.840]  if they can get away with banning loving, sweet, totally non racist books, they can
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:16.200]  ban anything. Well, and then they'd love to ban my book or your book or Jerome Corsi's
[1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:20.680]  books or any of the books that still are being published and people need to read and young
[1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:24.200]  people need to get their hands on Ted Malik. Let's talk about and I'll take a few calls
[1:45:24.200 --> 1:45:30.400]  here, common sense business principles for profitable leadership. This is what everybody
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:34.200]  should be reading, not learning how to be an SJW, not learning how to, if people don't
[1:45:34.200 --> 1:45:39.240]  know how to be successful, stop having chips on your shoulders, have good attitudes and
[1:45:39.240 --> 1:45:44.400]  then learn basic systems and then apply yourself and the world's looking for you. If you'll
[1:45:44.400 --> 1:45:49.520]  just be professional, nice, courteous, focused, dedicated, you won't be able to help being
[1:45:49.520 --> 1:45:55.880]  promoted and being successful. You agree with that statement Ted? I do, but I think we need
[1:45:55.880 --> 1:46:01.640]  this kind of jolt, as I say, of common sense business today. And in the past, it came from
[1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:06.600]  President Reagan today. It's coming from President Trump. We saw yesterday in the announcement
[1:46:06.600 --> 1:46:12.200]  of his tax plan. So we need policies both at the national level and at the corporate
[1:46:12.200 --> 1:46:19.360]  level that are prudent, principled, patient and practical. And most importantly, and this
[1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:24.680]  is something we underline in this book. It's all about this. We need to let markets work.
[1:46:24.680 --> 1:46:27.720]  We need to defend capitalism again.
[1:46:27.720 --> 1:46:34.000]  Now, now, Ted, before we go to some more of these phone calls, I haven't read the book
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:38.080]  yet, but I love it when books have actual great video trailers. I'm excited about it
[1:46:38.080 --> 1:46:42.160]  because I want to learn more about business myself. I just got into business to fund my
[1:46:42.160 --> 1:46:46.520]  political views. So I've never really went to any official school, but now I do read
[1:46:46.520 --> 1:46:50.120]  a lot of the better business people like yourself. And I've learned a lot from it and it's made
[1:46:50.120 --> 1:46:56.240]  us innumerably more successful. So just give us the basic gist of the book. And I want
[1:46:56.240 --> 1:47:00.720]  folks to know, don't think of this as too high-brow. So many people never want to read
[1:47:00.720 --> 1:47:04.040]  something like this thing. Oh, that's not for me. The basic principles you'll learn
[1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:09.080]  in something like this are transcendent. So just explain to people why they want to understand
[1:47:09.080 --> 1:47:12.680]  business. Because even if you're not officially yourself in your own business, understanding
[1:47:12.680 --> 1:47:17.800]  business and how businessmen think and women think is absolutely key to success.
[1:47:17.800 --> 1:47:24.280]  Well, this is for all business people. It's for small businesses, medium-sized businesses,
[1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:29.280]  large businesses for every sector, and frankly, for every country in the world. We need to
[1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:36.400]  learn how to do business on a prudent and principled basis. What we do is make this argument.
[1:47:36.400 --> 1:47:42.920]  We're very instructive, very informative. I co-authored this book with the former CDO
[1:47:42.920 --> 1:47:48.120]  and Chairman of the world's largest private company, Cargill. And in the book, we give
[1:47:48.120 --> 1:47:53.320]  away a lot of the secrets of companies that have been very successful and very doable
[1:47:53.320 --> 1:47:59.960]  over very long periods of time. So on a macro level, it's a defense of capitalism. And on
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:04.760]  a micro level, it's about all these great examples of companies who have been doing
[1:48:04.760 --> 1:48:07.000]  business. So you can learn from those companies.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:11.040]  Sorry, folks who don't know, Cargill is the biggest private company in the world. I've
[1:48:11.040 --> 1:48:16.200]  even seen Obama's regulators circulating around that one to get their fingers in there.
[1:48:16.200 --> 1:48:21.000]  And again, so many big globalist corporations that own slave factories in China, you name
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:26.440]  it, they'll always social justice, warrior justice signal, virtue signal, but they won't
[1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:30.800]  actually ever give people the tools to catch fish. They'll make you beg for fish and maybe
[1:48:30.800 --> 1:48:38.400]  give you one bite if you sell your soul. But to have Cargill's CEO giving out these mega-secrets,
[1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:43.560]  you can see capitalism, real capitals understand they're in a death battle with a collectivist.
[1:48:43.560 --> 1:48:47.640]  We've got to bring out the heavy weapons and make sure people are so successful we finally
[1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:52.200]  kill this vampire of collectivism once and for all. That's a big deal to have the CEO
[1:48:52.200 --> 1:48:57.320]  of Cargill give people the secrets because things like that could really be used by their
[1:48:57.320 --> 1:49:02.120]  enemies that haven't even figured those things out yet. So business secrets are really important
[1:49:02.120 --> 1:49:05.920]  and so for people to be given away the keys of the kingdom, I think it shows that capitalism
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:09.960]  that isn't evil understands that they've got to go to the thermal nuclear option.
[1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:15.760]  Well, we're talking about good capitalism. We're talking about the morality of the market.
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:23.160]  We're talking about how companies are extremely profitable over the long term based on these
[1:49:23.160 --> 1:49:28.040]  things that they do that in fact make them good companies just the opposite of what all
[1:49:28.040 --> 1:49:33.600]  these social professors have been preaching, not teaching in business schools around the
[1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:34.600]  world.
[1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:38.120]  That's right. They want to just tear everything down and then hand it out. It's like if you
[1:49:38.120 --> 1:49:42.320]  had a spaceship to go to a new planet, they want to tear down the spaceship and just for
[1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:46.600]  fun because it threatens them and then live like a bunch of sabbages instead of wanting
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:52.880]  to be part of this great experiment. They just hate success and want to conquer the engine
[1:49:52.880 --> 1:49:57.800]  of success even though they're going to destroy it so that they can claim that they're dominant
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:50:02.280]  when true dominance would be to simply empower humanity. There's no question for a market
[1:50:02.280 --> 1:50:06.680]  capitalism, even though only a fraction of it has been realized is thousands of times
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:08.240]  better than communism.
[1:50:08.240 --> 1:50:12.800]  Look at Venezuela, look at Cuba, look at all these countries. China's not communist. They've
[1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:18.280]  just adopted partial capitalism and it's taken them a long way. I mean before we go to calls,
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:24.720]  a few minutes just on why the elites who made their money through capitalism, so many of
[1:50:24.720 --> 1:50:30.120]  them, what percentage do you think it is? 60, 70 percent still want to push collectivism.
[1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:35.000]  Is it because now they've gotten to this level, they want to use it as a tool of control or
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:40.200]  is it really that they're bleeding heart fools and are guilty and so want to somehow deploy
[1:50:40.200 --> 1:50:45.320]  a system they think will lift everybody up even though all the science and history and
[1:50:45.320 --> 1:50:49.840]  business shows it does the opposite. I mean, are they useful idiots or are they authoritarians?
[1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:56.120]  Well, there are probably some that fit in each of those camps. What the problem is,
[1:50:56.120 --> 1:51:01.840]  the problem is that too many of them are redistributionists. So what they're really trying to do is a
[1:51:01.840 --> 1:51:07.840]  jury man to a system where they can get rich, but they use the state then to give away everyone
[1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:13.960]  else's wealth such that they can then pretend to be due gooders. There are way too many
[1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:22.280]  of those kinds of globalists operative in the global economy. What we need is more entrepreneurs.
[1:51:22.280 --> 1:51:27.280]  We need people who are innovative, who are actually trying to build great companies and
[1:51:27.280 --> 1:51:32.960]  I think frankly that operates first of all in the startups and in the medium-sized companies
[1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:38.000]  that America is famous for. 72 percent of jobs are created in those places. The tax
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:44.160]  code that we've been presented with yesterday is going to help incentivize that we have
[1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:49.400]  got to get back to economic growth. I want to take a few phone calls, but before we do
[1:51:49.400 --> 1:51:54.160]  in this last 10 minutes, Ted Malik, tedmalik.com, the new book, Common Sense Business, I'm going
[1:51:54.160 --> 1:51:59.560]  to read it, Principles for Prov�able Leadership, giving you really some stuff that smart folks
[1:51:59.560 --> 1:52:03.720]  have developed over the years that families have handed down to try to energize the economy
[1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:07.960]  and escape the clowered and pivoted folks that want to bankrupt things so they can control
[1:52:07.960 --> 1:52:11.280]  it. I mean that's their admitted paradigm. Any other little kernels of knowledge you
[1:52:11.280 --> 1:52:15.560]  want to impart to folks, any messages you want to give to the dug-in globalists, you
[1:52:15.560 --> 1:52:20.440]  know, the EU bureaucrats that exempt themselves from the very taxes they foist on their serfs?
[1:52:20.440 --> 1:52:27.680]  Well, it would be nice if they would give up their cause and just go back to real jobs,
[1:52:27.680 --> 1:52:31.840]  but they've got a cushy existence. I mean if you're making hundreds of thousands of
[1:52:31.840 --> 1:52:38.600]  dollars or euros a year on a tax-free basis and you spend half your day drinking beer
[1:52:38.600 --> 1:52:44.720]  and cocktails and then, you know, pushing around paper, maybe having a real job is just
[1:52:44.720 --> 1:52:47.720]  too difficult. And then they have to stain. I've always
[1:52:47.720 --> 1:52:52.360]  noticed parasites have to stain for the host. And I guess they have to stain for themselves
[1:52:52.360 --> 1:52:58.280]  so they're projecting it on us. Dan in Kentucky, Peter in Texas, Dan in Ohio, Kay in Georgia,
[1:52:58.280 --> 1:53:02.120]  Phil in New Hampshire. We're going to go to all of you guys and gals right now. Let's
[1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:06.880]  go to Kay first. Kay in the great state of Georgia, you're on the air.
[1:53:06.880 --> 1:53:12.280]  Hey, how are you guys doing? First, I wanted to read an Oscar Wilde book I found yesterday
[1:53:12.280 --> 1:53:14.960]  that's not relevant to your conversation. Sure.
[1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:21.720]  It's if you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh. Otherwise, they'll kill you.
[1:53:21.720 --> 1:53:27.240]  I was a, I'm a retired non-commissioned officer from the United States Army. I worked for
[1:53:27.240 --> 1:53:32.720]  many years in the intelligence community. And I've seen this whole thing go down over
[1:53:32.720 --> 1:53:39.360]  the past couple of years. I served for 10 years and I went to Afghanistan twice. And
[1:53:39.360 --> 1:53:45.800]  at every stop, there's somebody standing in your way. We know where the bad guys are.
[1:53:45.800 --> 1:53:50.320]  We know what they're doing, but it's just the will of the people to stand up to the
[1:53:50.320 --> 1:53:57.040]  government so they can get the country back. You know, that's what I've said and that's
[1:53:57.040 --> 1:54:02.480]  what Lou Dobbs is now saying that they're trying to break our will and our will is rising.
[1:54:02.480 --> 1:54:06.600]  Common sense will to be prosperous, to be upright, to be decent and not have a bunch
[1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:11.440]  of scum organize a system above us to siphon it off. And so I think we've, I think we're
[1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:15.120]  reaching the tipping point of humanity fighting their will again because this is happening
[1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:20.600]  in Africa, Latin America, Asia. Is it something in the air, Ted Malik? I mean, why is there
[1:54:20.600 --> 1:54:24.200]  such a, because you write about this, I'm not putting words in your mouth, such a global
[1:54:24.200 --> 1:54:31.640]  awakening. Well, I'd like to thank this caller, first of all, for his service, which we, we
[1:54:31.640 --> 1:54:37.640]  don't do often enough. He's absolutely right that we are in both an information war and
[1:54:37.640 --> 1:54:44.480]  I would say a spiritual war against these forces of darkness of evil and of globalism
[1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:50.120]  and more and more of us are rising up against it. And I think everywhere in the world, at
[1:54:50.120 --> 1:54:54.720]  least the places I'm traveling, I'm seeing that sentiment.
[1:54:54.720 --> 1:54:56.720]  Okay, anything else?
[1:54:56.720 --> 1:55:02.360]  Yes, sir. Well, the reason I gave that quote was because when I was in Afghanistan, I was
[1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:10.160]  embedded with the local police and the local army doing raids and such. And they could
[1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:12.680]  have killed us. I mean, there was, there was nothing standard between-
[1:55:12.680 --> 1:55:17.320]  But you made them, you were friends and you guys made jokes and you were friends, right?
[1:55:17.320 --> 1:55:23.200]  I learned their language. I spoke with them. I, I, you know, told them about America and
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:30.000]  evangelize based on our system. And people don't understand that all we need is this
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:33.920]  entrepreneurial spirit to take over back in the country and we're gonna go off. I mean,
[1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:41.640]  my dad didn't come here from Iran to see the country get destroyed in 1978. This place
[1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:43.760]  is going crazy. We need to take it back.
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:46.440]  That's right. We have to have the optimism and that's what Trump's done. That's his
[1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:50.640]  big crime. It's not that he's racist. They hate him because he's optimistic. He's make,
[1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:56.480]  he's, he's celebrating plumbers and firefighters and farmers and just average folks and, and,
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:55:59.600]  and making it about America again. That's what Alexander de Tocqueville talked about,
[1:55:59.600 --> 1:56:05.320]  is just celebrating our humanity, getting away from bowing down to elitism. Mr. Malik.
[1:56:05.320 --> 1:56:11.640]  The glass is never half empty. It's always half full. And I think that Trump has reignited
[1:56:11.640 --> 1:56:18.680]  this spirit, not just to make America great again, but to actually give the American people
[1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:26.480]  the power to be great in their own self awareness, in their self experience, in their self expression.
[1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:31.640]  And I would argue in the companies that they're going to build, because I'm, I'm really enthusiastic
[1:56:31.640 --> 1:56:34.400]  about the American economy looking into the near future.
[1:56:34.400 --> 1:56:38.440]  Okay. Thanks for the call. Maybe take a new five more minutes to the next hour, but then
[1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:41.000]  we've got the other big guests joining us, but I want to get to more of your calls, but
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:47.040]  I've got to say this. They said he'd never get 3.0 growth rate. It's 3.1. And to see
[1:56:47.040 --> 1:56:53.240]  the Democrats actively upset that the economy's turning back on, that's why Trump's approval
[1:56:53.240 --> 1:56:58.600]  ratings, even with skewed polls, are just going straight up is because the Democrats
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:04.000]  are, are, are literally like gremlins trying to sabotage your recovery. I mean, don't they
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  get how that looks? It's the most disappointing thing. I mean, to see these gripers, uh, who
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:20.640]  are, uh, either trying to, you know, you know, uh, stall the economy or to keep legislation
[1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:26.840]  from getting through or frankly, to resist Trump on every turn. All the president wants
[1:57:26.840 --> 1:57:33.240]  to do is to have the American people thrive again. So why can't we just, as Rush Limbaugh
[1:57:33.240 --> 1:57:38.720]  said last night, why can't we just for the next three or four months join arms together,
[1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:42.920]  pass this legislation and get on with it? And that's what Limbaugh said is key. They
[1:57:42.920 --> 1:57:46.960]  want the president to fail and, and, and, and they're public about it. And this is,
[1:57:46.960 --> 1:57:51.040]  he wants all of us to fail no matter what color we are. Bobby in Tokyo got about a minute
[1:57:51.040 --> 1:57:54.600]  and a half. We got a break. You're on the air with Mr. Mallick. Go ahead.
[1:57:54.600 --> 1:58:06.080]  All right. Great. Yes. Go ahead, Bobby. Yeah. So globalism is always kind of on the borderline,
[1:58:06.080 --> 1:58:12.080]  but there seems to be a good globalism, a bad one. Like my father is a heavily involved
[1:58:12.080 --> 1:58:18.840]  and I'm a lawyer myself in intellectual property and that we want to use it so that all of
[1:58:18.840 --> 1:58:25.240]  us can find a good way to develop new business. I tell you what, Bobby, stay there. I want
[1:58:25.240 --> 1:58:28.120]  to see you late. We're going to go to break. Ted, can you do five more minutes after this
[1:58:28.120 --> 1:58:33.560]  break? Absolutely. Okay, good. And then we've got a guest. I'm really Brandon Tatum, 50
[1:58:33.560 --> 1:58:37.200]  plus million views on his video about the NFL. He's joining us. This guy's amazing
[1:58:37.200 --> 1:58:40.560]  too. He's coming up in about six, seven minutes. We'll be back. I'm Alex Jones. Spread the
[1:58:40.560 --> 1:58:41.560]  word.
[1:58:41.560 --> 1:58:51.240]  Visit GCN live.com today, not a group. You developed living defense for us. It took
[1:58:51.240 --> 1:58:55.920]  you over a year to do it. Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the
[1:58:55.920 --> 1:59:01.360]  problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put
[1:59:01.360 --> 1:59:06.080]  toxins from food and water and beverages in my system. But right now we're dealing with
[1:59:06.080 --> 1:59:11.680]  massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host
[1:59:11.680 --> 1:59:17.100]  mechanism right now with all the refugees, uh, spreading disease around. We have biological
[1:59:17.100 --> 1:59:21.120]  warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that
[1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:24.520]  said there's so many things that are in it. You have the name in there. You have the organic
[1:59:24.520 --> 1:59:29.800]  clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice
[1:59:29.800 --> 1:59:32.880]  a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it
[1:59:32.880 --> 1:59:36.800]  today. It just came back in yesterday. Living defense info wars live.com and folks, you
[1:59:36.800 --> 1:59:41.920]  can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body. Period. And you support the broadcast
[1:59:41.920 --> 1:59:45.800]  info wars lives.com. Thank you doctor group from the global healing center. Thank you
[1:59:45.800 --> 1:59:53.120]  so much for all your work, sir. And this great product. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:59:53.120 --> 2:00:13.000]  show. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:31.000]  Look, if you go back 70, 80 years ago, they said the international man or the people that
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:35.760]  knew how to go to different countries, have different businesses, travel the world. That's
[2:00:35.760 --> 2:00:39.640]  that's a great thing. And then the globalist sold themselves is that as humans working
[2:00:39.640 --> 2:00:44.960]  together and all the rest of it, globalism is this global group of technocrats controlling
[2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:49.760]  everybody and then having secret agreements and secret groups and exempting themselves.
[2:00:49.760 --> 2:00:54.160]  That's the globalism we want to defeat. Bobby, I think you're getting at the point that we
[2:00:54.160 --> 2:00:58.080]  have to have copyright law where everybody's gonna sell each other's inventions and it
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:02.240]  has to be transparent has to be public. The countries have to be there as a units of that
[2:01:02.240 --> 2:01:07.000]  as firewalls to an authoritarian global government. That's where I'm going with this Bobby real
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:14.560]  quick comment and I'm gonna go back to Mr. Malik. Yeah, so I'm from Tokyo and I wish
[2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:20.840]  that Malik would be our minister of foreign trade and so far because we're so incompetent
[2:01:20.840 --> 2:01:27.400]  here. But the whole one of the main points that I'm concerned about, which I'm interested
[2:01:27.400 --> 2:01:33.320]  in is that with North regards North Korea and it's related to a steep the chin next
[2:01:33.320 --> 2:01:43.440]  point in that, you know, North Korea is already starving and nearly dead. And nobody seems
[2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:52.560]  to be interested in keeping that area alive. And why not? It wouldn't be an amazing feat
[2:01:52.560 --> 2:01:59.160]  for the United States is like Donald Trump would fly over there, say hello, rocket man
[2:01:59.160 --> 2:02:04.680]  and rock and man. No, I agree because as bad as I hate the communists, the people are slaves.
[2:02:04.680 --> 2:02:09.080]  They're totally brainwashed. It's a very let's ask Ted Mount. That's a great question. What
[2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:12.360]  would you do about North Korea? Because I mean, they're so belligerent. They're threatening
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:20.360]  all these attacks. I don't want a new war. But I mean, what do we do? Well, the problem
[2:02:20.360 --> 2:02:27.840]  is we've tried everything for more than 20 years. And we've given away the shop. Economic
[2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:34.360]  sanctions have for the most part either not been sufficient or have not worked. I mean,
[2:02:34.360 --> 2:02:39.880]  the allegation is that the Chinese and possibly the Russians control the economy. So you'd
[2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:46.560]  need their full cooperation in order to really put the screws to the North Korean situation.
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:51.960]  I'm not sure that there is a military scenario, but I think we have to keep that scenario
[2:02:51.960 --> 2:02:57.560]  on the table and hopefully come to a point where either they come to their senses. But
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:03:01.840]  because they're so irrational, I don't think that's likely. We'd have to hope that there
[2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:09.640]  could be and maybe in cent regime change. I agree with you and really sell a new plan
[2:03:09.640 --> 2:03:14.280]  with Russia and China and the North to economically build them up, but they have to give the weapons
[2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:20.160]  up, agree, stop having a 10 year, you know, re reunification plan. Instead, they just seem
[2:03:20.160 --> 2:03:25.080]  to be getting crazy and crazier with Kim Jong-un just firing missiles over Japan and threatening
[2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:29.480]  preemptive attacks. I got four children. I don't want nuclear war. I know the Russians
[2:03:29.480 --> 2:03:33.600]  and China are involved, but at the same time, this isn't like it's Iraq or something. This
[2:03:33.600 --> 2:03:41.880]  is a real lunatic threatening the Nukes. Well, that is in fact the case. And he actually
[2:03:41.880 --> 2:03:46.680]  has some of those weapons now and some of the delivery systems. So if he puts the two
[2:03:46.680 --> 2:03:51.720]  together, you can look at the circle or the arc of his possibility as soon as it's quite
[2:03:51.720 --> 2:03:57.240]  exciting. So we'll see this might all end rather badly in a fiery way as the president
[2:03:57.240 --> 2:04:03.360]  has said. But I do want to say that you're absolutely right and we're in total agreement
[2:04:03.360 --> 2:04:10.320]  and the caller I think has made this point. Globalism is the problem, not world trade,
[2:04:10.320 --> 2:04:16.800]  not relations between people, not the nature of give and take between nations. Globalism
[2:04:16.800 --> 2:04:22.680]  is an ideology. It's actually an immunitizing of the eschaton. It's trying to bring heaven
[2:04:22.680 --> 2:04:27.680]  on earth, which actually violates the first global redistribution by a bunch of pointy
[2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:34.720]  headed bureaucrats to become gods. So we need to call out globalism for what it is. And
[2:04:34.720 --> 2:04:38.440]  that's what I've been doing these last few years. An unelected authoritarian group of
[2:04:38.440 --> 2:04:42.360]  people on a power trip, Ted Malik, the new book, Common Sense Business Principles for
[2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:45.840]  probably leadership. Everybody should get it. Let's talk more often. Thank you so much
[2:04:45.840 --> 2:04:51.240]  for spending so much time with us. Get ready, Brandon Tatum. Tell everybody on Twitter and
[2:04:51.240 --> 2:04:56.600]  Facebook he's coming up.
[2:04:56.600 --> 2:05:02.200]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com with some patriotic quotes by Ron Paul. The most basic
[2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:07.720]  principle to being a free American is the notion that we as individuals are responsible
[2:05:07.720 --> 2:05:12.840]  for our own lives and decisions. We do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make
[2:05:12.840 --> 2:05:17.680]  up for our own mistakes. Neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how to
[2:05:17.680 --> 2:05:23.480]  live, so long as we aren't infringing on their rights. Freedom to make bad decisions is inherent
[2:05:23.480 --> 2:05:27.840]  in the freedom to make good ones. If we are only free to make good decisions, then we
[2:05:27.840 --> 2:05:33.400]  are not really free. Liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset when
[2:05:33.400 --> 2:05:39.960]  we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints, random searches, mandatory identification cards
[2:05:39.960 --> 2:05:46.360]  and paramilitary police in our streets. We have lost a vital part of our American heritage.
[2:05:46.360 --> 2:05:52.040]  America was born of protests, revolution and mistrust of government. Subservient societies
[2:05:52.040 --> 2:05:58.360]  neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long.
[2:05:58.360 --> 2:06:03.000]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:10.360]  drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[2:06:10.360 --> 2:06:15.560]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[2:06:15.560 --> 2:06:21.160]  of their own, air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for
[2:06:21.160 --> 2:06:26.840]  quiet war. Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy
[2:06:26.840 --> 2:06:32.840]  our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death. I personally
[2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:40.200]  counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated

[2:09:59.320 --> 2:10:05.640]  forward slash bt cruiser 34 but let's play a few minutes of the video that's got over 50 million
[2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:09.800]  views last time i checked you got a bunch of other viral videos as well here's a few minutes of it
[2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:22.440]  all right we're gonna talk but now y'all that made me talk so look this is this is this is my whole
[2:10:22.440 --> 2:10:29.320]  thing about this protesting and it's taking a knee on the flag for all you people who just seem to
[2:10:29.320 --> 2:10:38.040]  not understand let me clarify this for you okay it's not about the act of protesting it's not
[2:10:38.040 --> 2:10:46.040]  about the act of believing in something and pursuing it it's the way you're doing it i don't
[2:10:46.040 --> 2:10:51.560]  know how many times people have to say this listen what does the american flag have to do with your
[2:10:51.560 --> 2:10:58.360]  perceived oppression what what is the national anthem have to do with these issues that people
[2:10:58.360 --> 2:11:04.600]  are bringing up it is a separate issue the flag of the national anthem has nothing to do with what
[2:11:04.600 --> 2:11:11.400]  you're talking about you're you're talking about an anthem of hope and and in unity within this
[2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:17.880]  country that have made people become great that have made the poor become rich and give people
[2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:24.040]  opportunities you're you're just talking about a flag that represents hard work dedication blood
[2:11:24.040 --> 2:11:32.600]  sweat and tears sacrifice and the thing that makes me most upset is that you have these people
[2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:39.160]  who turn around and take a knee and want to attribute all the negativity to the flag and
[2:11:39.160 --> 2:11:44.760]  the anthem but don't want to attribute the positive listen if you feel that the american flag represents
[2:11:44.760 --> 2:11:50.680]  negativity and slavery and all this other stuff then you have to give credit and credence to a flag
[2:11:50.680 --> 2:11:56.360]  that have given you an opportunity to go from cornfields and picking cotton to being the president
[2:11:56.360 --> 2:12:03.720]  of the united states of america going from being being segregated can't go to proper schools can't
[2:12:03.720 --> 2:12:07.880]  vote taking you from bad points and then you're making millions of dollars to play sports and you
[2:12:07.880 --> 2:12:14.760]  know who's watching you white people i'm sick of y'all coming up with these lame excuses the reason
[2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:21.320]  why america isn't listening but marlo the king had support you could call it bipartisan support
[2:12:21.320 --> 2:12:25.720]  he had support on both sides from people in the movement and people outside of the movement
[2:12:25.720 --> 2:12:32.680]  because he did it with respect he did it with that rob and peter the paypal he did it with
[2:12:32.680 --> 2:12:40.280]  integrity he did it with the mission he did it with tangible goals that were achievable through
[2:12:40.280 --> 2:12:45.880]  hope faith education it's powerful but we've got him live right here so i'm gonna stop right there
[2:12:45.880 --> 2:12:49.480]  we've got some other videos i want to get to and it's confusing because you go to his channel it's
[2:12:49.480 --> 2:12:54.680]  got 13 million views on another channel it's got 41 million views last night and i still can't figure
[2:12:54.680 --> 2:12:58.360]  out facebook because i'll see one of my videos like a hundred thousand views and a million over here
[2:12:58.360 --> 2:13:03.160]  paul wastland 37 million over here and i've got a million over there i mean i it's crazy how it works
[2:13:03.160 --> 2:13:07.960]  but we've shown those to you actually with it 41 million views and then a bunch of others it is
[2:13:07.960 --> 2:13:13.400]  just absolutely crazy so let me just ask him out of the gate first off it's great to have you here
[2:13:13.400 --> 2:13:17.800]  and i love the internet age because i get to learn about all these cool people out there who are all
[2:13:17.800 --> 2:13:21.800]  one race the human race with red blood like martin Luther king talked about and all the
[2:13:21.800 --> 2:13:26.760]  eloquence of white people black people asian folks hispanics everybody and all the great food and
[2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:31.400]  all the great literature and all the great movies and just the true diversity that brings us all
[2:13:31.400 --> 2:13:36.280]  together instead of the left and the global is telling us how bad we are all day and trying to
[2:13:36.280 --> 2:13:41.720]  hijack football but people want to just go escape with their families i don't want to hear all this
[2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:46.120]  stuff when i'm watching football you know they're hijacking it they're taking it over like steven
[2:13:46.120 --> 2:13:51.560]  segal said just to have you there though it just makes me feel good randon and so many other
[2:13:51.560 --> 2:13:56.840]  incredibly eloquent people because you said in six and a half minutes what i've been trying to say
[2:13:56.840 --> 2:14:03.480]  just perfectly so uh it's amazing to have you here with us well thanks alex man i enjoy your show
[2:14:03.480 --> 2:14:08.920]  i love your energy and i'm excited to be here for sure and i know you're kind of getting ready to
[2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:13.240]  go on duty and stuff so you only got about 30 minutes with us instead of me asking the questions
[2:14:13.240 --> 2:14:18.360]  what finally got you to go public what finally got you to start speaking out like so many other
[2:14:18.360 --> 2:14:26.280]  silent majority people i don't know man i feel like that i have an obligation to to people i have
[2:14:26.280 --> 2:14:32.440]  an obligation to this country i have an obligation to my family to to just keep it 100 real and i
[2:14:32.440 --> 2:14:38.200]  felt like that when truth is revealed to me i mean i would be doing a disservice to people to not
[2:14:38.200 --> 2:14:43.880]  express that and and also the frustration is what caused me to start coming out because i
[2:14:43.880 --> 2:14:49.560]  couldn't hold it in anymore that i felt like i've been lied to and now the truth has been revealed
[2:14:49.560 --> 2:14:55.560]  i have to say something about it at all costs i don't mean to obsess over this but i spent hours
[2:14:55.560 --> 2:15:01.400]  the other day trying to count it up just because i was the same thing but the super bowl has like
[2:15:01.400 --> 2:15:06.600]  80 million views i counted up the copies of your video it was like 50 something million
[2:15:06.600 --> 2:15:12.920]  a day and a half ago do you know how many views it's got i don't have a clue i mean the last i
[2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:19.080]  think i've seen uh the the views that you spoke about i think a 41 million and then about 13 million
[2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:24.680]  on my page and i've seen a few other pages that have had a million here and there so i'm saying at
[2:15:24.680 --> 2:15:32.440]  least 60 million or 60 or 70 million views and one guy in his car what does that say to the entire nfl
[2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:40.760]  hollywood all of them cope air doesn't have 60 million views in a month i mean that's true that's
[2:15:40.760 --> 2:15:45.560]  true i think what it says is that this is i like i tell people it's not about me it's not that i'm
[2:15:45.560 --> 2:15:51.800]  such a great spokesperson it's that god is has put me in a position to have a platform to speak on
[2:15:51.800 --> 2:16:00.280]  behalf of other people and i think that america spoke by a guy sitting in the car you know spewing
[2:16:00.280 --> 2:16:07.720]  out his heart in millions and millions of shares of that one video it speaks to what america really
[2:16:07.720 --> 2:16:13.320]  feels well i'm not kissing your ass it's true excuse that i'm gonna start even using my old
[2:16:13.320 --> 2:16:18.520]  stuff folks i apologize the stations you just walked through it all perfectly i get so angry
[2:16:18.520 --> 2:16:23.560]  because there's so much i can't say at all but you were somehow able to just i start stuttering i
[2:16:23.560 --> 2:16:29.240]  get so angry i don't know how you just laid it out so smooth yeah i think you know the funny thing
[2:16:29.240 --> 2:16:35.800]  about it and people may call me crazy but i talk all the time i talk to myself i talk to other people
[2:16:35.800 --> 2:16:42.280]  who are available to listen to me so what happens is i ramble about this stuff all day long and then
[2:16:42.280 --> 2:16:47.960]  when i get on a video this is stuff that about i have already been saying to myself so i think it
[2:16:47.960 --> 2:16:53.240]  comes out smoothly after i'm on a video because i've been harping about it you know all day long
[2:16:55.320 --> 2:16:58.440]  it's incredible we just found another video where it's 42 million views
[2:16:59.560 --> 2:17:05.880]  i just i mean it's just crazy and again they have red carpets and oscars for movies that 10
[2:17:05.880 --> 2:17:11.160]  million people see and so i'm just showing how obsolete they are now that all this competition
[2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:16.280]  has come and then that's only one part of the story then there's the whole story about what you said
[2:17:16.280 --> 2:17:20.840]  and then the nfl is trying to double down even though that first they said okay we may back off
[2:17:20.840 --> 2:17:26.280]  now they want to double down and people are and they're trying to get black folks to get into
[2:17:26.280 --> 2:17:31.560]  this and this poll show they're not buying it what is the nfl thinking i don't know what they're
[2:17:31.560 --> 2:17:37.080]  thinking i don't know if this is some kamikaze mission or what i think what it is is it's
[2:17:37.080 --> 2:17:43.640]  deliver mentality i feel like that these people are being you know tricked into brainwashed into
[2:17:43.640 --> 2:17:49.480]  forced into shamed into acting this way i think a few players decided to do something
[2:17:49.480 --> 2:17:55.480]  and these owners are afraid of the backlash that they'll get from minority communities if they
[2:17:55.480 --> 2:18:00.360]  actually stand up it was right i i have no idea what they're thinking about this should not be
[2:18:00.360 --> 2:18:08.680]  happening in america you know it's funny you say that i was looking over here they're now reporting
[2:18:08.680 --> 2:18:14.280]  that the there wasn't one sack last year against the raiders quarterback but because he was the
[2:18:14.280 --> 2:18:19.640]  only guy that wouldn't take a knee that the defensive line let him get sacked over and over again
[2:18:19.640 --> 2:18:24.680]  and now the word is players are speaking out and saying yes they did let him get attacked that is
[2:18:24.680 --> 2:18:29.640]  next level if they did that because we saw this other army ranger fella who came out and put his
[2:18:29.640 --> 2:18:33.880]  hand over his heart but they threatened to fire him so he said i apologize i'm ashamed of america
[2:18:33.880 --> 2:18:39.480]  basically talk about i mean imagine the bullying they're going through that itself is so unamerican
[2:18:40.920 --> 2:18:46.280]  no it is man you know to be honest i've been in locker rooms before i know the the pressure
[2:18:46.280 --> 2:18:51.160]  of wanting to be a part of a team and you guys love each other you know as a team you fight for
[2:18:51.160 --> 2:18:57.400]  each other you work out together you have a season you have goals i understand that dynamic and this
[2:18:57.400 --> 2:19:02.440]  kid pretty much fell victim to that he wanted to stand up for something but this mob team like
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:08.600]  mentality you know forced him to stand okay you're the outcast man you're not with us and his love
[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:13.800]  for the game and love for the team he had to come out as shameful as it is he had to come out and
[2:19:13.800 --> 2:19:20.520]  apologize apologize that he did his own thing because that's separate from the game to go out
[2:19:20.520 --> 2:19:24.840]  and put his hand over his heart you can do anything you want now you can even one guy simulated
[2:19:24.840 --> 2:19:30.680]  piston on the president uh when he made a touchdown that's okay but you can't go out put your hand
[2:19:30.680 --> 2:19:38.440]  over your heart it's it's incredible brandon tatum is our guest police officer patriot the officer
[2:19:38.440 --> 2:19:44.920]  tatum on twitter facebook tatum bug 34 and that's where you go see 13 million views got other channels
[2:19:44.920 --> 2:19:50.360]  five million here two million there 42 million here uh i mean it's just crazy and again that's just

[2:24:33.320 --> 2:24:42.680]  uh notice the nfl commissioner last saturday when drump said stop disrespecting american our veterans
[2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:49.880]  he said no you disrespect the nfl the arrogance and there's this arrogance in hollywood and it's
[2:24:49.880 --> 2:24:55.640]  invaded television sports and it's it's really shameful that they're so disconnected thinking
[2:24:55.640 --> 2:25:02.840]  they want praise from mainstream media when the man we have on brandon tatum has over i agree with
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:09.560]  him 60 plus million views on one video he did tens of millions of others on the other videos he did
[2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:13.400]  that's bigger than all of them can buy but they don't care they have this arrogance it's like a
[2:25:13.400 --> 2:25:18.280]  force field they wear but they don't get we've woken up to them so they throw bigger and bigger
[2:25:18.280 --> 2:25:22.760]  fits the economy's coming back they're panicking they don't know what to do is another call for
[2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:27.880]  killing cops big article drudgereport.com anti-fuck plans civil war to overthrow the government
[2:25:27.880 --> 2:25:33.240]  they're meeting in these basements we've had undercover people inside them as well uh my concern
[2:25:33.240 --> 2:25:39.480]  is these crazy people think they're invincible and are about to throw a big violent charlie
[2:25:39.480 --> 2:25:44.200]  manson style temper tantrum and as a police officer brandon tatum what do you think of this
[2:25:45.640 --> 2:25:50.920]  i don't know you know in in situation like this which is obviously like a national security issue
[2:25:50.920 --> 2:25:55.880]  i think that uh our government should be able to handle these on the local level i mean we just
[2:25:55.880 --> 2:26:01.480]  have to be resilient you know we have to be you know watch our back keep each other safe make
[2:26:01.480 --> 2:26:06.520]  sure that we're up on our training you know where i'm from or where i patrol we haven't had any
[2:26:06.520 --> 2:26:11.800]  extreme activities so i don't anticipate that happening where we're at but we're always vigilant
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:17.480]  man because you just never know just like in dallas they're doing a protest and then a lunatic
[2:26:17.480 --> 2:26:23.800]  starts shooting people so i mean there's definitely a risk of some of these things we probably don't
[2:26:23.800 --> 2:26:28.040]  have the information to know where it's coming from but we always stay vigilant and prepared sure
[2:26:28.040 --> 2:26:32.920]  i was about to say but trump has only gotten a few levels below him in this is deep state running
[2:26:32.920 --> 2:26:37.400]  this against the president that's why i think it's so dangerous because you're saying yeah the higher
[2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:44.120]  ups the feds should be handling this but we had a month ago we had folks on that had investigators
[2:26:44.120 --> 2:26:48.680]  just privately doing it inside the events they're giving the feds the videos people handing out the
[2:26:48.680 --> 2:26:53.320]  guns saying we're gonna kill cops we're gonna launch this coming up the next few months and
[2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:58.840]  then nothing happens right that's that's a little concerning for me because i've seen some of the
[2:26:58.840 --> 2:27:03.400]  videos you know some people may want to act like it don't exist but i've seen the videos of them
[2:27:03.400 --> 2:27:08.120]  meeting basements of them having their little tactical plan of trying to train the fight and
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:14.600]  equip themselves i've seen videos of them coming with masks and batons and you know where's the
[2:27:14.600 --> 2:27:21.160]  funding coming from it's a huge issue and you just wonder at what point do we leave political
[2:27:21.160 --> 2:27:25.960]  correctness and we start really looking at these issues because these individuals although it may
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:31.400]  not be in the city i work in they're clearly an issue around the country and a lot of people
[2:27:31.400 --> 2:27:36.760]  pushing for them to be a hate group or terrorist group and i don't know why we haven't had that
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:42.440]  accomplished uh and had that wide wide spread and they keep calling everybody nazis when they dress
[2:27:42.440 --> 2:27:50.360]  like nazis right i mean these people they're terrorists they look like terrorists they dress
[2:27:50.360 --> 2:27:57.160]  like terrorists they suppress speech they burn buildings they burn property so you know i'm not
[2:27:57.160 --> 2:28:03.320]  an expert on this just as a regular basic citizen it i can tell with my own two eyes that there's
[2:28:03.320 --> 2:28:09.400]  obviously something going on here and it appears that the government isn't really taking it serious
[2:28:09.400 --> 2:28:13.480]  for political correctness i'll tell you what's going on i've talked to a lot of high-level sources
[2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:17.800]  and i've seen it my friend brandon they're going to use these people as the cover as an attempt
[2:28:17.800 --> 2:28:22.440]  at a violent overthrow that's what i got the nfl to do all this you have counter-strike bigger than
[2:28:22.440 --> 2:28:26.280]  all of us combined quite frankly except for the president he's had a bigger reach but you're like
[2:28:26.280 --> 2:28:30.280]  number two now fighting this and but you think you've been even more powerful because he just
[2:28:30.280 --> 2:28:35.720]  neutralizes all their propaganda but you look at this they're got they've got some special teams
[2:28:35.720 --> 2:28:39.400]  and people involved in this soros of others have done this other countries they want to use these
[2:28:39.400 --> 2:28:45.720]  idiots as their decoy cover for what they really do they're playing something big right now i agree
[2:28:45.720 --> 2:28:49.480]  with you i mean anybody can look at these videos that you're showing they've been spread around
[2:28:49.480 --> 2:28:54.680]  the internet i mean somebody would have to explain to me why are they covering their faces why are
[2:28:54.680 --> 2:29:00.760]  there any secret meetings i mean i've had the fbm secret service here like 10 times and i never
[2:29:00.760 --> 2:29:04.920]  called for violence asking me if i'm planning violence so why are these people still walking
[2:29:04.920 --> 2:29:09.400]  around calling for killing cops and beating people on the head with bike locks i mean why
[2:29:10.520 --> 2:29:15.320]  it's it's this it's this mentality of political correctness i mean i'm telling you you can go
[2:29:15.320 --> 2:29:20.040]  out and you can say i hate police officers you can say i hate white people it's almost as if you
[2:29:20.040 --> 2:29:25.640]  could go out and do that and it's it's kind of pacified like you get a pass and and at some
[2:29:25.640 --> 2:29:30.040]  point in this country and i think trump is doing a good job at trying to get it back in full circle
[2:29:30.040 --> 2:29:34.120]  at some point we're gonna have to get to the point where you say look if it's wrong we need to call
[2:29:34.120 --> 2:29:39.000]  it wrong if it's right we need to call it right and i'm telling you like i think that you have a
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:44.600]  lot more knowledge in this than i do but as a regular everyday person this is it's concerning to me
[2:29:44.600 --> 2:29:48.520]  it is hey there i want to ask you the empire i want to ask what martin was her king as you said
[2:29:48.520 --> 2:29:52.520]  would say about this jones and the gc because all you're saying is what he would say we'll be back
[2:29:56.360 --> 2:30:01.720]  prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even realtor.com is
[2:30:01.720 --> 2:30:05.960]  writing about it but the realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to
[2:30:05.960 --> 2:30:10.920]  set themselves apart from what they call uncle travis's guns and canned foods militia vision of
[2:30:10.920 --> 2:30:16.520]  preparedness well the ants may have the last laugh on the grasshoppers but the grasshoppers will
[2:30:16.520 --> 2:30:20.840]  still sing the tune if they can make money but maybe you don't have a hollywood mansion where
[2:30:20.840 --> 2:30:25.560]  you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation proof bunker there
[2:30:25.560 --> 2:30:31.640]  are still very effective low tech low cost things you can do to prepare in fact even realizing that
[2:30:31.640 --> 2:30:36.840]  there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of

[2:33:12.840 --> 2:33:19.960]  i am happy to join with you today
[2:33:22.520 --> 2:33:25.720]  in what will go down in history
[2:33:27.960 --> 2:33:33.320]  as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation
[2:33:33.320 --> 2:33:39.000]  i have a dream
[2:33:42.520 --> 2:33:44.520]  my four little children
[2:33:46.200 --> 2:33:51.560]  one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the
[2:33:51.560 --> 2:34:07.320]  content of their character i have a dream today with this faith we will be able to work together
[2:34:07.320 --> 2:34:13.400]  to pray together to struggle together to go to jail together to stand up for freedom together
[2:34:13.400 --> 2:34:20.600]  knowing that we will be free one day let freedom ring and when this happens
[2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:30.680]  when we allow freedom ring when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet from every
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:35.080]  state so as martin luther king that famously said you judge people by the character of their
[2:34:35.080 --> 2:34:40.120]  deeds and their conscience and what they do well that's how you judge clothing tell you judge cars
[2:34:40.120 --> 2:34:45.960]  it's how you judge food it's how you judge your mate it's off people's performance
[2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:50.920]  but they've turned that around now the democratic party in the globalist
[2:34:51.560 --> 2:34:56.120]  to make it about know what group you're in well we're americans and they want to attack that symbol
[2:34:56.120 --> 2:35:01.720]  that they know trump's using to unify people and it's in the wiki league since very very cold
[2:35:01.720 --> 2:35:06.200]  blooded so brandon tatum is with us another 10 minutes or so i really appreciate him joining us
[2:35:06.200 --> 2:35:11.720]  i'm very excited about him agreeing on his own dime i'm like no we want to pay for it
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:17.000]  he's a police officer to fly out here and be on the show in studio next friday
[2:35:17.800 --> 2:35:25.480]  follow him on facebook and on twitter uh at the officer tatum on facebook.com forward slash
[2:35:25.480 --> 2:35:33.320]  tatumbug34 youtube.com bt cruiser 34 now i want you to talk about what you want at the time we've
[2:35:33.320 --> 2:35:37.720]  got left here but during the break we were talking so one more question about anti-fub
[2:35:38.760 --> 2:35:44.120]  their plans for civil war we were getting more into that where you think it's going what's behind
[2:35:44.120 --> 2:35:49.640]  it and what you think they're going to do next and then separately just the nfl the players are
[2:35:49.640 --> 2:35:54.200]  being told to do this this is a big pr thing through holly what they think it's you know the only
[2:35:54.200 --> 2:35:58.120]  thing they have left they're so desperate and the left doesn't know when to stop they don't know
[2:35:58.120 --> 2:36:01.560]  when they're destroying themselves i want to get your take on all that just give you the floor
[2:36:01.560 --> 2:36:06.920]  uh brandon for the next 10 minutes thanks for joining us oh yeah i appreciate you have me on
[2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:12.520]  again no i i think that you know i'm kind of to a certain degree i'm kind of glad that that
[2:36:12.520 --> 2:36:17.400]  they're doing some of these things because they're they're digging their own grave i think that we
[2:36:17.400 --> 2:36:23.000]  can obviously see that the american people are starting to separate themselves from this foolery
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:29.160]  you know every five minutes you turn around they're calling somebody racist they're calling somebody
[2:36:29.160 --> 2:36:36.200]  homophobe to the point where now they're desensitizing the words and when people actively are homophobic
[2:36:36.200 --> 2:36:41.640]  when people are actively racist it's it's going to go overlooked you know we we can't even define
[2:36:41.640 --> 2:36:46.920]  the true racist and the true homophobic people and the true bigots of this country it because
[2:36:46.920 --> 2:36:54.280]  they're labeling good decent people as being bad so i mean you know like you like you talked about
[2:36:54.280 --> 2:37:00.280]  with the uh antifa and all this other stuff like at first it sound like it was working well for them
[2:37:00.840 --> 2:37:07.640]  but now it's starting to backfire now when antifa is showing up in gear i even saw on on CNN and
[2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:12.440]  some of the other stations that they're now condemning these people they're now saying no these
[2:37:12.440 --> 2:37:18.200]  people are violent these people are coming to these rallies looking for trouble so a part of
[2:37:18.200 --> 2:37:24.040]  me is is glad that this is happening because the liberals and these people who are far left
[2:37:24.040 --> 2:37:29.480]  are just eliminating themselves from ever getting elected ever having positions of power
[2:37:29.480 --> 2:37:35.000]  because they're just so engulfed in the foolery and i'm wondering and this is this is a thing
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:41.800]  that i wonder all the time i wonder what is stimulating this because some of these people
[2:37:41.800 --> 2:37:48.280]  who are politicians who are smart intelligent people with degrees life experience they're
[2:37:48.280 --> 2:37:56.360]  literally saying things in the public sphere that they know are not true these people know
[2:37:56.360 --> 2:38:01.000]  that donald trump is not a racist these people know that they were supporting him and they were
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:05.960]  friends with him and they were having drinks with him a long time ago and now that he is
[2:38:05.960 --> 2:38:11.160]  challenging the establishment now they want to come against them now they want to make claims
[2:38:11.160 --> 2:38:16.280]  against him now they want to lie about him now everything that he say they want to be
[2:38:16.280 --> 2:38:24.600]  um misconstrued on every level he can't even be a patriot he the man can't even say that he
[2:38:24.600 --> 2:38:29.400]  want america to be together on something because if he say that they're going to say oh this is
[2:38:29.400 --> 2:38:34.360]  this is the america that you want is the white supremacist america and i think people are getting
[2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:39.800]  fed up with it me i used to be a democrat a whole life i was taught to be a democrat i voted for
[2:38:39.800 --> 2:38:46.600]  brock obama his second term and i came to the realization that i had made a mistake when i
[2:38:46.600 --> 2:38:53.960]  started looking at my values of being a christian of being conservative um you know i'm not for
[2:38:54.920 --> 2:39:00.840]  you know gay marriage or or abortions and all this other stuff that's not what i'm for i stick
[2:39:00.840 --> 2:39:05.000]  with the principles of the bible it doesn't mean i don't love people i love everybody because that's
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:11.160]  what the bible teaches but to interject that stuff into society um without it being unchecked
[2:39:11.720 --> 2:39:15.960]  it's something i don't agree with exactly what especially when it's targeting children
[2:39:17.320 --> 2:39:22.600]  right right exactly i think let me i'm gonna add this part you know with the uh and i'm not
[2:39:22.600 --> 2:39:26.440]  trying to go down a rabbit hole but these things are really affecting our society no no go down a
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:31.640]  rabbit hole that's why we got you here yeah i know this is the perfect place uh but listen
[2:39:31.640 --> 2:39:41.240]  what what happened is is i've seen these people interject the gender confusion into young kids
[2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:47.560]  who i think is basically child abuse as a young kid you you don't even know how to stop peeing
[2:39:47.560 --> 2:39:52.600]  in the bed so how are you going to know what your gender is and who you love and who you identify
[2:39:52.600 --> 2:39:56.600]  they want an adult i mean i didn't my parents had talked to me about sex i'll hit puberty or other
[2:39:56.600 --> 2:40:02.360]  people and they got some teacher talking to my five-year-old about sex yeah it's crazy and like
[2:40:02.360 --> 2:40:07.400]  you said and you know and and i honestly this is this is me being completely honest i think people
[2:40:07.400 --> 2:40:12.920]  watch your show and they say oh man this guy's crazy he's but you make points that we need to
[2:40:12.920 --> 2:40:19.720]  actually look at because why all of a sudden it's acceptable to the interject that into the minds of
[2:40:19.720 --> 2:40:25.080]  a young kid why is it acceptable to be racist towards white people in this day and age we're
[2:40:25.080 --> 2:40:30.440]  like what's stimulating this because there is no leader no independent leader that i can point to
[2:40:30.440 --> 2:40:36.120]  other than barack obama to say that this person was leading us down in tollywood it's in tollywood
[2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:40.840]  it's in the wiki leaks they said the elites lose the control we need class warfare and the biggest
[2:40:40.840 --> 2:40:46.040]  way to have class is americans like wealth so that's kind of hard to do and the democrats are so rich
[2:40:46.040 --> 2:40:50.360]  they don't make about money they're gonna make it about race they're just getting us to fight with
[2:40:50.360 --> 2:40:55.880]  each other while they run off with the loot right right that's that's exactly what's happening
[2:40:55.880 --> 2:41:00.440]  because you can watch it these people are not affected by this but they then put this this
[2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:07.160]  energy they put this negativity on us like you and i they want me to believe that you hate me
[2:41:07.160 --> 2:41:11.960]  and i hate you so that we can't work together to establish something positive as long as we're
[2:41:11.960 --> 2:41:16.280]  hating each other we're not going to communicate with one another and then they can pan it to us
[2:41:16.280 --> 2:41:21.720]  separately and this is exactly what they're doing and if anybody was to deny that i would
[2:41:21.720 --> 2:41:27.400]  ask them to bring up some legitimate facts to to disprove kind of the the point of what we're
[2:41:27.400 --> 2:41:33.000]  saying here well they can't argue with you brandon and again i get back to this it's not about red
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:39.640]  carpets or kissing in anybody's rear end but you speak and it makes such sense you get 60 plus million
[2:41:39.640 --> 2:41:45.800]  views in what now is five six days and that's just one of your videos i didn't have time to count up
[2:41:45.800 --> 2:41:51.640]  all the others millions and millions there again we have to keep announcing we're the winners people
[2:41:51.640 --> 2:41:57.480]  agree with us it's common sense the real mark that the average person isn't racist it isn't addled
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:42:02.200]  by that and and handicapped by obsessing on other people all day and it's an excuse for them not to
[2:42:02.200 --> 2:42:08.520]  be successful be they black or white we all know losers that do it the big issue is that we should
[2:42:08.520 --> 2:42:13.880]  look at the fact that in the real realm of ideas you're the super bowl winner in the real area i
[2:42:13.880 --> 2:42:19.000]  mean but by this weekend you're gonna have more reviews than the super bowl dead last year i mean
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:23.800]  you know and you didn't get paid anything for that that's what's crazy is that what we say is
[2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:28.840]  what everybody knows and then they keep telling us no no no you're the minority of folks that don't
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:32.760]  want to buy into all this stuff no we're the majority and we're not black we're not white we
[2:42:32.760 --> 2:42:38.360]  got red blood we love god we want justice we want to live in peace we want to be able to watch a
[2:42:38.360 --> 2:42:44.040]  football game with about a without a bunch of craziness where my kids are going what is this i
[2:42:44.040 --> 2:42:48.680]  have my kids asking what did i do and it's it's just and again i go they want to put guilt on you
[2:42:48.680 --> 2:42:52.840]  so that you follow the government and these globalists and i said the people on the field
[2:42:52.840 --> 2:42:56.840]  are puppets and you know that's the point you've made they just want to do it to be trendy and
[2:42:56.840 --> 2:43:01.880]  then you learn imagine the bullying that went on in those games where you've got black players
[2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:07.720]  hispanic players white players and others in quarterbacks that are getting you know physically
[2:43:07.720 --> 2:43:12.680]  attacked you know not being protected because they did what was right imagine the stories we
[2:43:12.680 --> 2:43:19.000]  don't know imagine we don't know brandon tatum yeah yeah i couldn't i couldn't even imagine that
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:23.560]  this is this this is just i mean then you put in the fact that there's millions and millions of
[2:43:23.560 --> 2:43:27.880]  dollars i could i could only imagine a owner coming down in the locker room and telling
[2:43:27.880 --> 2:43:32.040]  the star quarterback hey you need to you need to promote this agenda you need to say this you
[2:43:32.040 --> 2:43:36.600]  need to say that you need to act like this or you will not have a job and i know collin cappernick
[2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:41.000]  is a perfect example of the fact that if they don't want to deal with you they will not hire you
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:46.280]  now deservingly so for him because he's a distraction well they used him to detonate it
[2:43:46.280 --> 2:43:52.760]  then threw him away right that's i mean that it's almost like they're they're passing out signals
[2:43:52.760 --> 2:43:58.600]  like listen this will happen to you we are in control here if we don't want you notice that
[2:43:58.600 --> 2:44:02.840]  quarterback said no and put his hand over his heart so they let him get more sacks than he had
[2:44:02.840 --> 2:44:10.040]  the last three years previous this in one game that's that's funny that's funny all right you know
[2:44:10.040 --> 2:44:15.640]  to be honest like i couldn't even imagine a person actually doing that but in this day and age with
[2:44:15.640 --> 2:44:21.960]  these this type of bizarre behavior i cannot disprove that unless i actually you know had some facts
[2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:25.320]  around in it i wouldn't i wouldn't say that that's not a true statement i was about to say it's not
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:30.120]  a hundred percent confirmed we know no sacks of the quarterback last year and the same offensive
[2:44:30.120 --> 2:44:34.840]  line let him get sacked i mean i've got the piece here since we said it let's just play it since we
[2:44:34.840 --> 2:44:41.000]  said let's play it did raiders throw nfl game over anthem arnstrong and yeti radio show this is the
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:48.040]  new report dealing with the game here's a clip so yeah so this is a scandal if it's true and we have
[2:44:48.040 --> 2:44:54.680]  it on pretty decent authority that it is this is one hell of a scandal with the nfl could ruin the
[2:44:54.680 --> 2:45:00.040]  league what are we talking about if it involves the whole kneeling thing stay tuned to the arnstrong
[2:45:00.040 --> 2:45:07.320]  and get issue so i'm quoting from the san jose mercury news talking about what each nfl team
[2:45:07.320 --> 2:45:13.640]  during did during sunday's national anthem during these troubled and divided times the entire offensive
[2:45:13.640 --> 2:45:19.000]  line of the oakland raiders the only line in the nfl made up entirely of african-american players
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:24.840]  was joined by virtually the entire team in kneeling or sitting during the anthem and one of the best
[2:45:24.840 --> 2:45:29.640]  offensive lines in the nfl we understand which is key to this story oh yeah they are amazingly
[2:45:29.640 --> 2:45:38.360]  effective derrick car was sacked once last year is an amazingly seldom i mean they did not let
[2:45:38.360 --> 2:45:44.200]  derrick car get tackled until he got his leg broken anyway um i've studied the photographic evidence
[2:45:44.200 --> 2:45:49.960]  there were a couple of black guys on the team who were not sitting but virtually the entire team
[2:45:49.960 --> 2:45:57.000]  was sitting head coach jack del Rio was standing quarterback derrick car standing while his offensive
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:46:02.920]  line was kneeling and the offensive line reportedly had led the whole we're going to sit thing
[2:46:02.920 --> 2:46:09.080]  football fans maybe ahead of us now the offensive line protects the quarterback the original plan
[2:46:09.080 --> 2:46:12.760]  by the way was to stay in the locker room but the nfl said no because the schedule were kicking
[2:46:12.760 --> 2:46:16.600]  off right after the anthem so you have to go out so the offensive line said we're going to sit
[2:46:17.720 --> 2:46:26.200]  so derrick car who's never sacked last year was sacked four times by the redskins back to back
[2:46:26.200 --> 2:46:32.120]  on the second series offensive series of the raiders the first series he threw almost immediately
[2:46:32.120 --> 2:46:38.440]  an interception so that series was over before it began so for the first full series he was sacked
[2:46:38.440 --> 2:46:48.920]  twice back to back plays and and i had said uh no sacks i guess it was one sack i mean that that
[2:46:48.920 --> 2:46:54.440]  to me is pretty obvious and it just shows the insanity of all this the people being used
[2:46:54.440 --> 2:47:02.200]  by this as this power play on the field when it's this field and these fans that are literally loving
[2:47:02.200 --> 2:47:08.120]  you and you think they hate you and that's a point you also may brandon tatum well yeah yeah
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:12.280]  the back to the story i mean that's that's that's definitely something i will have to look into
[2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:16.840]  and look at the film i think it can be verifiable this i mean it can either go one way or other
[2:47:16.840 --> 2:47:22.520]  we can verify if that is actually true if we actually have to film and you can look at blocking
[2:47:22.520 --> 2:47:27.800]  schemes and you can look at stunts and blitzes from the defense because there is a possibility
[2:47:27.800 --> 2:47:32.840]  that they just got the butch kick and they gave up sacks because they were getting wilts and you
[2:47:32.840 --> 2:47:38.760]  know what i won't unless i see the film i can't say that it wasn't a scheme and and they didn't let
[2:47:38.760 --> 2:47:44.280]  that happen people in the nfl take steroids and do all kinds of stuff so i'm not going to say that
[2:47:44.280 --> 2:47:49.400]  this is just far beyond the ethical values of sure absolutely i find it very hard i'd rather
[2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:55.160]  find it very hard to believe but before i take that stretch i will say i want to look at the film
[2:47:55.160 --> 2:48:01.320]  and and and see that they just get their butts kicked or were they maliciously doing something
[2:48:01.320 --> 2:48:08.120]  crazy well man i agree with my own eye you never took us out of rabbit trail i did today just
[2:48:08.120 --> 2:48:12.840]  because i thought it was so so interesting but we know it's the people pulling the strings that
[2:48:12.840 --> 2:48:18.600]  are behind this and what's it like for you to know that 60 plus million views of one video
[2:48:18.600 --> 2:48:23.960]  that you did and that now you other than trump are like the voice of the american people
[2:48:24.760 --> 2:48:31.560]  yeah on this issue i think it's funny but you know what this is this is an example like you said
[2:48:31.560 --> 2:48:37.480]  we're right and they're wrong that's it's the bottom line they they use media they use these
[2:48:37.480 --> 2:48:43.480]  big organizations to to to beat it in our heads that everybody hates trump that everybody loves
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:48.760]  this virtual signaling that's going on when in reality i mean i don't have to say nothing the
[2:48:48.760 --> 2:48:55.800]  views themselves speak for if if we were wrong and most americans believe that the nfl was doing
[2:48:55.800 --> 2:49:01.320]  the right thing or they believe that donald trump was a bad guy in the races if that was true i wouldn't
[2:49:01.320 --> 2:49:07.240]  have got 60 million views on a on a video that i made in my car in the garage and donald trump
[2:49:07.240 --> 2:49:13.160]  wouldn't be president today i'm just keeping it 100 real this is not you know no one can come back
[2:49:13.160 --> 2:49:19.400]  that and i think that as conservatives as people who are on our side i think that we have to start
[2:49:19.400 --> 2:49:25.560]  remembering look we're winning this game you know we're up by 30 points you know they're they're using
[2:49:25.560 --> 2:49:30.360]  trick plays and shenanigans and they're on a sideline cheering um kind of like hillary clinton
[2:49:30.360 --> 2:49:35.800]  was doing they're on a sideline cheering but they're losing exactly it's all games man i tell you

[2:54:38.200 --> 2:54:44.200]  you're being condescending no i mean more articulate than me a lot more so not no not patronizing the
[2:54:44.200 --> 2:54:50.520]  opposite like let people have success and then he's a listener for years it's humbling because it
[2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:55.240]  lets me know i see that everywhere where i don't do the best job sometimes but i'm the first a lot
[2:54:55.240 --> 2:54:59.560]  of times to get info out because i'm willing to be attacked and then people resonate they research
[2:54:59.560 --> 2:55:05.400]  it and we have victory so our greatest successes are the talking points which are based in reality
[2:55:05.400 --> 2:55:09.880]  and research speaking of that i'm not going to play it because the time constraints but uh doug
[2:55:09.880 --> 2:55:15.480]  hagman was on what the 26 25th we can put it on screen i forget the exact date we had it up earlier
[2:55:15.480 --> 2:55:20.520]  and said my sources around the country that he sent out and paid for that's how serious this is
[2:55:20.520 --> 2:55:26.280]  with his investigations group um around the country said they're getting weapons or planning
[2:55:26.280 --> 2:55:31.240]  violence they've got sophisticated folks handling them that now has all broke a month and three days
[2:55:31.240 --> 2:55:38.920]  later exactly as he said with louder with crowded info wars other reports and the police are thankful
[2:55:38.920 --> 2:55:44.200]  but aren't even allowed to arrest people and then the school officials cover it up on these
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:50.120]  universities so hagman uh what what you reported over a month ago here is now breaking and i'm sure
[2:55:50.120 --> 2:55:55.800]  you have a lot more info since the month past uh yeah alex and thanks yeah you know it's it's
[2:55:55.800 --> 2:56:01.400]  going to get even worse um what is taking place oh by the way in austin tomorrow there is a meeting
[2:56:01.400 --> 2:56:08.920]  of refused fascism um you know if i'm if i can say this from three to five p.m at genuine
[2:56:08.920 --> 2:56:14.280]  joe's coffee house right there in austin on uh west anderson lanes so if anyone wants to drop by
[2:56:14.280 --> 2:56:19.080]  just to see what refused fascism local group austin is doing there it is genuine joe's coffee
[2:56:19.080 --> 2:56:24.760]  house but we're seeing these meetings take uh these organizational meetings all over the country
[2:56:24.760 --> 2:56:29.800]  but what's most disturbing here in addition to of course the the funding that goes back to
[2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:36.760]  alliance for global justice in one case and of course all of the normal groups the sorrows
[2:56:36.760 --> 2:56:42.440]  connected groups we're seeing some funding that's a degree or two separation away from
[2:56:42.440 --> 2:56:49.960]  um the organizing for action obama's group um and i say that uh you know with with some
[2:56:49.960 --> 2:56:56.040]  reservation but when you start to unwind the the money trail here and that's what we do is follow
[2:56:56.040 --> 2:57:04.360]  the money we can see where uh the organizing for actions part of this as well as uh in in one case
[2:57:04.360 --> 2:57:10.360]  one of the very well known opposition research groups that that provided that the dnc in the
[2:57:10.360 --> 2:57:15.320]  democrats information about donald trump and and michael are specifically donald trump
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:21.640]  is actually sharing some office space with a local refuse fascism chapter oh yeah we know
[2:57:21.640 --> 2:57:26.760]  sorrows and obama are on record funding and protecting it and the question is what does
[2:57:26.760 --> 2:57:32.360]  trump do to deal with it or what do we do well we've been dealing with local police departments
[2:57:32.360 --> 2:57:37.960]  the federal under under sessions it's been very difficult to establish a beachhead
[2:57:37.960 --> 2:57:41.800]  where we can give them information with uh with the sessions justice department which
[2:57:41.800 --> 2:57:46.440]  i find very difficult to to comprehend so we've been dealing with the local and state authorities
[2:57:46.440 --> 2:57:51.080]  on this on the ground level and they've been very receptive taking our information because what
[2:57:51.080 --> 2:57:57.320]  we're seeing too is the training for uh for combat we're talking about weapons caches we're talking
[2:57:57.320 --> 2:58:03.240]  about uh and they're on videos now saying we're going to stab and shoot people very much yes
[2:58:03.240 --> 2:58:08.520]  yeah and they're holding webinars too which is which is just blows my mind uh we've been
[2:58:08.520 --> 2:58:13.400]  and they've been able to infiltrate those but the meetings themselves uh are difficult to
[2:58:13.400 --> 2:58:17.160]  sometimes that to really chase after because of the decentralization and the way they have
[2:58:17.160 --> 2:58:21.240]  they've got their planning but but you first report over a month ago you you had your guy
[2:58:21.240 --> 2:58:25.960]  in one of their meetings yes oh yes and we've got and that's gone and it wasn't just a bunch of
[2:58:25.960 --> 2:58:30.360]  method kids you were saying it was sophisticated operatives handling them that's that's really
[2:58:30.360 --> 2:58:35.000]  because the again i mean young young people are the cover i believe i'm gonna ask you about that
[2:58:35.000 --> 2:58:39.960]  when we come back four more sophisticated attacks which they say is the 100th anniversary of the

[3:00:11.560 --> 3:00:22.360]  so
[3:00:30.040 --> 3:00:35.000]  Doug hagman's our guest he first broke the news with his investigators across the country
[3:00:35.640 --> 3:00:40.760]  hagman and hagman is the radio tv show he owns an investigative training service for police
[3:00:40.760 --> 3:00:46.600]  great researcher looking at this well said to me asking the questions what what other
[3:00:46.600 --> 3:00:50.440]  big tidbits should we know because because it because it looks to me like they're getting ready
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:58.280]  for an october 100 year replay of the bolster revolution they say they are
[3:00:58.920 --> 3:01:03.640]  Doug hagman i have a big article here where paul watson links to a bunch of videos and their own
[3:01:03.640 --> 3:01:07.000]  statements that they're going to do it i mean they're saying we're getting ready for a violent
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:11.080]  overthrow we're going to kill a bunch of people you've got this army officer that just graduated
[3:01:11.080 --> 3:01:15.880]  west point saying he's getting ready to you know get violent and they're just walking around organizing
[3:01:15.880 --> 3:01:22.440]  violence exactly and paul joseph watson did a wonderful job on the article uh the links are
[3:01:22.440 --> 3:01:28.040]  important there and of course the uh the november 4th event is important but what they're planning
[3:01:28.040 --> 3:01:35.720]  subsequent to that event they're they're planning to um um and i want to be careful when i say this
[3:01:35.720 --> 3:01:43.400]  they're planning to disrupt all town halls that feature republican or um the conservative
[3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:52.600]  leaders they're planning to disrupt even events uh even well all school events uh campus events
[3:01:52.600 --> 3:01:59.000]  that is i should say but nobody ever disrupts all their hollywood crap exactly exactly now
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:03.560]  there's one thing that that's interesting we're finding in a couple of different instances where
[3:02:03.560 --> 3:02:12.280]  uh we we can actually verify that uh some of the uh especially on a city and or local levels
[3:02:12.280 --> 3:02:18.520]  many of some i shouldn't say many some of the city and local officials who work in positions
[3:02:18.520 --> 3:02:23.800]  of authority within city halls whether they're city managers or within the mayor mayoral staffs
[3:02:23.800 --> 3:02:29.240]  even in some of the uh coastal cities on both coasts but even within the uh within the heartland
[3:02:29.240 --> 3:02:35.800]  of america are actually assisting in providing information to refuse fascism and and so let's
[3:02:35.800 --> 3:02:39.560]  be clear we already know this but this is more confirmation they've got moles in government
[3:02:40.200 --> 3:02:43.960]  uh basically giving intel to their operatives and we know they give them safe harbor to commit
[3:02:43.960 --> 3:02:49.640]  crimes on these major universities to be able to extinguish uh free speech uh so this is and we
[3:02:49.640 --> 3:02:53.880]  know a lot of professors are getting arrested assaulting people dressed up with the mask on
[3:02:53.880 --> 3:03:00.520]  so what we know is they have some serious uh phd command and control well you're right and and
[3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:06.440]  they're also a um being assisted like i said by people that hold positions of authority within
[3:03:06.440 --> 3:03:12.760]  city governments and that's that's very uh uh disconcerting given the fact that you've got
[3:03:13.320 --> 3:03:18.600]  uh the possibility of the potential for uh actually these people being able to docks
[3:03:18.600 --> 3:03:24.760]  the consult or or to to unveil the names and addresses of for example some of the local
[3:03:24.760 --> 3:03:31.160]  leaders who are conservative who are anti fascism for real as opposed to this pseudo anti fascist
[3:03:31.160 --> 3:03:36.680]  movement and we're seeing that so the threat to the individuals who out there politically
[3:03:36.680 --> 3:03:41.400]  the political leadership um the conservative political uh conservative political leadership
[3:03:41.400 --> 3:03:45.960]  is incredible especially given the fact that they've got this automatic pipeline and and they're
[3:03:45.960 --> 3:03:51.480]  they're refining this pipeline of information through these seminars the local meet-ups and
[3:03:51.480 --> 3:03:57.720]  meet and greets as well as on social networking you've pointed this out but the danger in my
[3:03:57.720 --> 3:04:02.840]  view anyway and what we found the danger uh the dangerous period is not going to be necessarily
[3:04:02.840 --> 3:04:08.840]  november 4th it's going to be what happens after that and they are they've declared war on uh
[3:04:08.840 --> 3:04:14.680]  donald trump and and pence that's a given but they're they're going more local so i would urge
[3:04:14.680 --> 3:04:20.600]  anyone in a position a conservative uh politically conservative position on a local level and even
[3:04:20.600 --> 3:04:25.720]  some there's there's even some discussion about attacking um some evangelical churches
[3:04:26.520 --> 3:04:32.680]  and i you know okay now we saw that last weekend yeah well exactly but on let me just say this on
[3:04:32.680 --> 3:04:36.840]  a grander scale would that information stay there i want you to recap that and then i want to ask
[3:04:36.840 --> 3:04:40.600]  the big question because you know that sometimes they do some disinfo but i agree they have their
[3:04:40.600 --> 3:04:46.600]  political launch uh in november and then they build towards violence after that but then also
[3:04:46.600 --> 3:04:51.560]  october is the day of the revolution so i i see it all building up even earlier let's war game this
[3:04:51.560 --> 3:04:57.880]  when should we well we'll talk about it police departments across the country are now using
[3:04:57.880 --> 3:05:05.080]  an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls
[3:05:05.080 --> 3:05:12.840]  and text messages without warrants the technology comes courtesy of the fbi who have forced our
[3:05:12.840 --> 3:05:19.480]  nation's police departments into signing nondisclosure agreements forbidding them from publicly talking
[3:05:19.480 --> 3:05:25.240]  about the technology needless to say this is a direct violation of our fourth amendment and they
[3:05:25.240 --> 3:05:31.400]  have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying where we now know that police are collecting
[3:05:31.400 --> 3:05:38.280]  information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes once again
[3:05:38.280 --> 3:05:44.520]  more evidence that the police state isn't coming it's already here this is dara mcbreen and i invite

[3:08:22.760 --> 3:08:29.240]  it was the worst of times the tale of two cities the paradox it's always a paradox
[3:08:30.760 --> 3:08:37.320]  for the parallax view we see people waking up political correctness waking up to nationalism
[3:08:37.320 --> 3:08:43.000]  being the answer free market being the answer as if that's rocket science but if the historical
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:52.920]  examples we see the poisonous hollywood arrogance being exposed we saw hillary still arrogantly
[3:08:52.920 --> 3:08:58.520]  stomping around only digging her political hole deeper but then we have massive reports on info
[3:08:58.520 --> 3:09:04.120]  wars dot com on president planet dot com news wars dot com and of course on hagman and hagman
[3:09:04.120 --> 3:09:09.800]  dot com and all the other sites we'll put up his site the hagman report dot com he's got a bunch
[3:09:09.800 --> 3:09:14.520]  of sites northeast intelligence network you name it excellent website excellent shows you've got all
[3:09:14.520 --> 3:09:22.280]  this going on and they're not going to give up and so they say november fourth november fifth
[3:09:22.280 --> 3:09:27.800]  we have the videos in the story and if i plan civil war to overthrow the government they say
[3:09:27.800 --> 3:09:31.640]  number four they launched us they're already blocking roads we show you the video and saying
[3:09:31.640 --> 3:09:36.360]  it's begun it's beginning and then they say we're going to kill cops we're going to stab people we're
[3:09:36.360 --> 3:09:41.160]  going to kill white people it's mainly whites leading it usually i'm not against trannies but
[3:09:41.160 --> 3:09:46.600]  usually like tranny men say they're going to kill everybody i guess they're on prozac or something
[3:09:46.600 --> 3:09:53.720]  but i don't i don't know tranny men i can't handle the insanity anymore the point is tranny persons
[3:09:54.680 --> 3:09:59.960]  and it's not that i don't have problems with some corrupt police or i don't have problems with issues
[3:09:59.960 --> 3:10:05.320]  but it's like a full-on group of crazy people wanting a huge civil war when we actually have a
[3:10:05.320 --> 3:10:11.560]  president trying to turn the economy back on so in closing talking to doug hagman of the hagman
[3:10:11.560 --> 3:10:17.000]  report great investigative journals and private investigator the trains police in multiple states
[3:10:17.000 --> 3:10:21.880]  with all these great sources what are the other big points people should know and yes i tend to
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:26.200]  agree they do what they say they're going to do by launching this attack number fourth and then
[3:10:26.200 --> 3:10:33.000]  that's political and then it builds and they hope copycat violence hashtag hunt republicans
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:37.560]  like we saw democrat strategist putting out and then what a false flag or something to make them
[3:10:37.560 --> 3:10:42.040]  the victims like they're trying to have clashes hoping somebody does something violent to then you
[3:10:42.040 --> 3:10:45.800]  know they they heard a bunch of people kill a bunch of people at a church or whatever that's cute and
[3:10:45.800 --> 3:10:50.280]  funny but one one woman gets run over it's terrible but they say we're all guilty i mean it seems
[3:10:50.280 --> 3:10:55.000]  like they're going to add a false flag to this for it to then be a big enough blow-up to give the
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:11:01.640]  cover for the attempted removal of trump which all of muller's people and the cia globalists have said
[3:11:01.640 --> 3:11:06.840]  is coming they say now is the time they said two months two months ago that they would have him
[3:11:06.840 --> 3:11:13.720]  removed here we are two months later are they behind or uh what do you think i think it's a
[3:11:13.720 --> 3:11:20.280]  question from what we've seen it's a question of organization it was initially a matter of funding
[3:11:20.280 --> 3:11:26.120]  that seems to be taken care of via the alliance for global justice but now i think it's a matter of
[3:11:26.120 --> 3:11:32.280]  organization and which you mentioned about the false flag uh they have used in the past the
[3:11:32.280 --> 3:11:40.200]  phrase righteous beatings meaning to the applying that of course to their enemies now what they're
[3:11:40.200 --> 3:11:45.480]  saying is we're willing to take righteous beatings for the right publicity and we're seeing this and
[3:11:45.480 --> 3:11:52.040]  we're hearing this in these local chapter meetings that that they're dispersed so i think i think in
[3:11:52.040 --> 3:11:57.320]  order um they may be each other up because they saw the christian prayer group three weeks ago as
[3:11:57.320 --> 3:12:01.960]  you pointed out take the beatings black white you name it together that destroyed them that was
[3:12:01.960 --> 3:12:07.160]  their mohawk and gondi moment their martin Luther king or jesus christ moment so so now absolutely
[3:12:07.160 --> 3:12:13.240]  they would then what have their own people beat each other up well either that or put themselves
[3:12:13.240 --> 3:12:19.640]  in a position to to get wounded in some way some very public way and then of course that will
[3:12:19.640 --> 3:12:24.600]  allow them the righteous response which is another phrase that they're throwing about
[3:12:24.600 --> 3:12:31.480]  and we're seeing now as well the muslims um and i have to throw this out there this is not meant
[3:12:31.480 --> 3:12:37.320]  to be uh anything but but but the truth here where the some of the training manuals used by al-qaeda
[3:12:37.320 --> 3:12:42.280]  but used by for example for example the al-patar series and the inspired magazine which is written
[3:12:42.280 --> 3:12:47.960]  in english being actually used for instructional material for some of these local chapters and
[3:12:47.960 --> 3:12:53.320]  the all the leftists publicly adopted the flag the regalia they love it they think it's sexy right
[3:12:53.960 --> 3:12:59.720]  yeah and i mean you know from robert evalkian to carl dicks on on down evalkian of course
[3:12:59.720 --> 3:13:05.640]  founding refuse fascism what we're seeing at this point and i think that in this order and i don't
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:11.080]  know the timetable but i do suspect you're gonna see um uh essentially attacks on properties
[3:13:11.080 --> 3:13:17.320]  multiple cocktails and the targets will be churches police stations attacks on police themselves police
[3:13:17.320 --> 3:13:22.360]  officers of course you know that's and by the way just like al-qaeda like you said or inspired
[3:13:22.360 --> 3:13:27.960]  magazine they put out the propaganda hoping lone wolves activate just like the sudanese muslim
[3:13:27.960 --> 3:13:34.120]  that shot what nine people killing one he said i went there to kill white christians so i mean it's
[3:13:34.120 --> 3:13:42.440]  happening yes yes so the the uh any and the town halls especially those uh hosting uh political
[3:13:42.440 --> 3:13:49.720]  conservatives and any type of christian conservative uh but biased meeting group whatever or anti
[3:13:49.720 --> 3:13:56.040]  russian say anti but uh uh well anti sharia uh groups are targets those are the primary
[3:13:56.040 --> 3:14:02.200]  high list uh priority targets and then of course the just the supporters of donald trump anyone
[3:14:02.200 --> 3:14:07.880]  would they make a uh you know red magahat for example or wearing a trump shirt it's open
[3:14:07.880 --> 3:14:12.360]  season on everyone like that and i don't want to sound alarmist but this is what they're telling
[3:14:12.360 --> 3:14:15.960]  the uh foot and what do you think they're hoping maybe not blow up a federal building and blame
[3:14:15.960 --> 3:14:21.880]  it on us but they attack enough folks the media covers it up a few lone people fight back then
[3:14:21.880 --> 3:14:26.440]  that's billed as an attack on them like they tried with charlesville and then it blows up bigger
[3:14:26.440 --> 3:14:32.760]  yeah and i think i think the roman manual quote never let a crisis go to waste i think that that
[3:14:32.760 --> 3:14:39.480]  that's kind of the mantra here uh where looking at this let's make sure that we can engage cause
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:47.240]  chaos of course overwhelm the system and and really tax the um ems uh the police tax the the
[3:14:47.240 --> 3:14:55.560]  response uh even to the extent where uh well thank sds back in the 70s and 60s along with uh the
[3:14:55.560 --> 3:15:01.160]  revenue uh with the uh communist groups and the weathermen the the fact is they didn't do enough
[3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:06.360]  back then they're saying look we learned our lesson back then we didn't win then um now we're
[3:15:06.360 --> 3:15:10.920]  we're gonna have to do a little bit more and uh well not a little bit more much more so everyone's
[3:15:10.920 --> 3:15:14.840]  a target this is open season on everyone and again i don't want to sound alarmist but this is what
[3:15:14.840 --> 3:15:19.960]  they're saying in these groups and the tapes or the i call them tapes the recordings have been
[3:15:20.680 --> 3:15:24.520]  sure let me ask you this thing closing uh hagman report dot com's the main website
[3:15:24.520 --> 3:15:28.520]  want to go to i just threw out a few others out of memory hagman report dot com let me ask you this
[3:15:29.240 --> 3:15:32.920]  clearly it's a hundred year anniversary of the bolshevik revolution they admit that's their plan
[3:15:32.920 --> 3:15:37.000]  they're all activating they have these army officers decloaking saying yes we're communists
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:41.800]  we're gonna we're gonna get you they're not getting in trouble i mean this is just they've
[3:15:41.800 --> 3:15:46.440]  been breeding like termites underneath the floorboards here it looks like they're getting ready to
[3:15:46.440 --> 3:15:50.840]  launch their big physical assault they've lost politically the Mueller's an idiot everything's
[3:15:50.840 --> 3:15:55.160]  falling apart they're in trouble i think they're going to try something desperate and violent
[3:15:55.160 --> 3:16:01.480]  on an organized scale have the media phrase it like it's good claim it's all trumps fault and
[3:16:01.480 --> 3:16:07.240]  try to remove it that said their whole nfl launch to create this environment and turn up the pressure
[3:16:07.240 --> 3:16:13.800]  has gone flat so regardless even if this thing goes off as a dud or fails i i think it's clear to
[3:16:13.800 --> 3:16:19.160]  say we are in for some really dangerous crazy times i think everybody needs to be going into
[3:16:19.160 --> 3:16:23.960]  october into november november four as you said we're not out offensively looking for trouble
[3:16:23.960 --> 3:16:28.440]  but you see somebody ball of cocktails burning stuff shooting people have your firearm defend
[3:16:28.440 --> 3:16:33.480]  yourself and light them up because you know what everybody needs to know do not offensively do
[3:16:33.480 --> 3:16:37.880]  anything but you need to be ready especially of your cops and again people say oh you're just
[3:16:37.880 --> 3:16:41.880]  worship the police now they've used the cops escape go for political warfare there's some bad
[3:16:41.880 --> 3:16:46.760]  cops good cops it's one of our institutions they want to overthrow that bully into submission
[3:16:46.760 --> 3:16:50.440]  and yes they are shooting cops in the back of the head killing them patrol cars every week
[3:16:50.440 --> 3:16:55.000]  it's all the same group that's all a beta test to just get the cops used to it so when the main
[3:16:55.000 --> 3:16:59.560]  assault comes cops sit around i don't know what they've been hit by every one of these antifa
[3:16:59.560 --> 3:17:03.320]  every one of these communist groups every one of these congress people that push this they're all
[3:17:03.320 --> 3:17:07.720]  guilty because if they launch the real bolstering attack i think they may be we're talking hundreds
[3:17:07.720 --> 3:17:12.280]  of dead cops in the middle of the night shotting their cruisers they think the cops are going to
[3:17:12.280 --> 3:17:17.560]  then roll up send up the white flag and and you know kiss their ass that's already been the plan
[3:17:17.560 --> 3:17:22.920]  bring in the federal review boards say they're sorry seeing and said hey more cops are dying
[3:17:22.920 --> 3:17:29.160]  you better stop you know realizing you're bad you better go under loretta lynch's uh strong police
[3:17:29.160 --> 3:17:35.400]  strong communities act i mean this is really brazen bullying don't they get america was asleep
[3:17:35.400 --> 3:17:40.600]  not wimps they're starting to wake us up i think they better understand that well they don't know
[3:17:40.600 --> 3:17:44.120]  because they never actually got hurt i think this is a bunch of wimps trying to practice war
[3:17:44.840 --> 3:17:49.640]  and i don't think they understand that they're about to really get put in a woodchipper good
[3:17:49.640 --> 3:17:56.520]  points all and i believe that they have mischaracterized the right or the conservatives
[3:17:58.360 --> 3:18:05.400]  temperament or courteous lack of response or tolerance shall we say for acceptance and that's
[3:18:05.400 --> 3:18:13.240]  a wrong thing to do so well you know again when i see taking place here is is really
[3:18:14.440 --> 3:18:17.880]  the attacks against the buildings the attacks against the police the attacks against the
[3:18:17.880 --> 3:18:23.880]  political and social conservatives and it will gradually increase because they don't
[3:18:23.880 --> 3:18:29.640]  and this is another thing it's almost mentally that they believe that lynch or holder is still in
[3:18:29.640 --> 3:18:34.440]  the justice department and perhaps they have holdovers there but certainly they're not getting
[3:18:34.440 --> 3:18:38.840]  much resistance from at the federal level so they feel empowered where they can go off
[3:18:38.840 --> 3:18:46.520]  and do whatever they need to do without this without much potential for punitive consequences
[3:18:46.520 --> 3:18:54.760]  that's the attitude at least that we've seen well i see anybody in a black mass waving a gun around
[3:18:55.640 --> 3:19:02.200]  i mean these people apparent test its perch and they've been testing testing testing
[3:19:02.200 --> 3:19:06.840]  and they think they're just going to get away with all this and i'm a target you're a target
[3:19:07.400 --> 3:19:13.080]  and these people don't scare me america rolling over does and i you know what i know in my heart
[3:19:13.080 --> 3:19:17.960]  dog america is not going to roll over i know if they pull this i don't want them to do this but
[3:19:17.960 --> 3:19:23.720]  the macchiabelle in me you know the you know the devil in me almost hopes they do because
[3:19:24.840 --> 3:19:28.680]  then they're going to get back a hundred times what they did it's like the japanese attack
[3:19:28.680 --> 3:19:35.560]  in pearl harbor i mean i i just but they're so domesticated so cowardly but it doesn't mean
[3:19:35.560 --> 3:19:39.960]  they can't play video games practicing to kill people and can't kill a lot of folks uh but um
[3:19:41.000 --> 3:19:45.640]  it's a hell of a time to be alive anything else Doug uh no and you're right they've got strong
[3:19:45.640 --> 3:19:50.600]  thumbs from the video games but they've got no idea necessarily what uh what our response is
[3:19:50.600 --> 3:19:55.000]  going to be and i think that they're they're underestimating what the typical american
[3:19:55.000 --> 3:20:01.240]  response will be but that's not stopping them from planning and from uh promoting the uh at
[3:20:01.240 --> 3:20:05.800]  this point the righteous violence to fight the fascist donald trump and his agenda so
[3:20:05.800 --> 3:20:12.040]  i think i think we're going to see a ramp up in violence um perhaps as early as well around
[3:20:12.040 --> 3:20:17.000]  november fourth and i would be very very concerned in the time period between then and christmas
[3:20:17.000 --> 3:20:23.000]  by not the necessarily the islamic groups but by the domestic terrorist groups especially and
[3:20:23.000 --> 3:20:28.760]  including rev calm and tifa refuse fascism and indivisible well you know they're using islam as
[3:20:28.760 --> 3:20:33.640]  their muscle i i've really seen the tea leaves antifuzz the cover the media is already preparing
[3:20:33.640 --> 3:20:38.440]  to flush them by now okay yeah maybe they're terrorist then they use islamic groups really
[3:20:38.440 --> 3:20:46.280]  carry out the attacks and then basically then the antifa gets flushed well there you go yeah and
[3:20:46.280 --> 3:20:53.160]  that's a that's a great model uh and it's geographically it's not specific to any one geographical
[3:20:53.160 --> 3:20:58.600]  region yet but that's the model that we're seeing especially on the on the west coast because we've
[3:20:58.600 --> 3:21:03.000]  got investigators on the west coast east coast and a couple other places without getting too much
[3:21:03.000 --> 3:21:10.280]  in detail uh that have infiltrated these groups and uh actually we bumped into uh one um i'm not
[3:21:10.280 --> 3:21:15.160]  going to say a federally one state officer there who was working undercover it's kind of funny but
[3:21:15.160 --> 3:21:18.920]  the bottom line is to be again the interest doesn't doesn't appear to be in with the federal
[3:21:18.920 --> 3:21:24.280]  government but with the uh authorities in the state and and county and i can't believe the feds
[3:21:24.280 --> 3:21:28.920]  aren't watching this even if they're behind it because the deep state why would you just let
[3:21:28.920 --> 3:21:34.280]  this run rampant having even no idea what it's doing it's super dangerous all right doug hagman
[3:21:34.280 --> 3:21:39.160]  thank you so much god bless you thank you we're going to skip this break and the one at 50 so
[3:21:39.160 --> 3:21:44.920]  that jack possobeck has more time uh former current naval intelligence officer formerly in intelligence
[3:21:44.920 --> 3:21:48.920]  says the president likes him and retweets him he was he was banned because if you're a west point
[3:21:48.920 --> 3:21:52.600]  army officer graduate that says he wants a violent revolution hates america
[3:21:52.600 --> 3:21:58.200]  then you get promoted if you love america and have served your country uh you know then you're a bad
[3:21:58.200 --> 3:22:01.560]  person but it was great having you earlier this week jack we need to talk more on the phone the
[3:22:01.560 --> 3:22:06.600]  next few days about a lot of stuff we're working on a lot of big things coming up so good to have
[3:22:06.600 --> 3:22:09.720]  you here with us i'm gonna let you take over in about two minutes but i wanted to ask you a big
[3:22:09.720 --> 3:22:16.440]  story on drudgereport.com antifa plans civil war to overthrow the government link after link after
[3:22:16.440 --> 3:22:21.720]  link with videos of mainline leftist and communist saying now number four they're gonna start killing
[3:22:21.720 --> 3:22:29.080]  people uh stabbing people murdering police organized criminal activity here what do you think as a
[3:22:29.080 --> 3:22:33.960]  smart guy uh they're they're they're they're planning go ahead and take over alex what they're
[3:22:33.960 --> 3:22:39.480]  planning to do here with antifa with all of these organizations is they're attempting number one
[3:22:39.480 --> 3:22:46.280]  not necessarily to take over the us they know they can't overthrow the united states they know
[3:22:46.280 --> 3:22:49.720]  that they don't have the abilities they don't have the manpower they don't have the material the
[3:22:49.720 --> 3:22:57.880]  supplies that's not the real issue here the real issue for them is they want to make the impression
[3:22:57.880 --> 3:23:05.080]  they want to show that the trump presidency the trump administration is discredited they want to
[3:23:05.080 --> 3:23:10.520]  have this uh this new line and the media has tried lying i totally agree it's an intro to have him
[3:23:10.520 --> 3:23:17.400]  removed to say look america's in turmoil is your fault exactly it's a way to say he's illegitimate
[3:23:17.400 --> 3:23:21.640]  and if you remember you go back first it was well it wasn't the electoral vote it was the popular
[3:23:21.640 --> 3:23:25.640]  vote and then it was the electoral college was going to revolt against him well that didn't happen
[3:23:25.640 --> 3:23:29.560]  and then it was the recount he had the recount and then it was the russian collusion delusion
[3:23:29.560 --> 3:23:33.560]  which has now been completely debunked and so now they're turning back to antifa they're saying
[3:23:33.560 --> 3:23:38.200]  well he promised law and order he couldn't bring law and order he's still not a legitimate president
[3:23:38.200 --> 3:23:43.800]  it's trying to make america think that trump is to blame for all this division they're now blaming
[3:23:43.800 --> 3:23:49.080]  him for all the nfl stuff which actually happened under barack obama but they want americans to think
[3:23:49.080 --> 3:23:54.920]  that he's to blame for the division that he's to blame for i agree and here's my final question
[3:23:54.920 --> 3:23:59.240]  it's not working i mean disagree if you disagree it's all blowing up in their face
[3:23:59.240 --> 3:24:02.760]  from some pivotal ratings are up the economy starting to roar back they're getting more and
[3:24:02.760 --> 3:24:08.920]  more desperate don't they get it's not working they do get it then it's not working alex and that's
[3:24:08.920 --> 3:24:14.520]  why it's pushing them to become more and more brazen it's pushing them to become more and more
[3:24:14.520 --> 3:24:20.360]  desperate alex a year ago these people were using warrantless or uh you know very trumped up warrant
[3:24:20.360 --> 3:24:25.800]  wiretaps of the trump administered excuse me the trump campaign at the time that that was the level
[3:24:25.800 --> 3:24:29.880]  of lawlessness these people were planning to go to that they were able to take things to that level
[3:24:29.880 --> 3:24:35.080]  they assume nobody was going to do anything about it so when it comes to them saying are they going
[3:24:35.080 --> 3:24:39.080]  to commit crimes alex they already have committed crimes they've already gotten to the point where
[3:24:39.080 --> 3:24:43.240]  they've broken the law that we've seen them in that's why they're so dangerous because they've
[3:24:43.240 --> 3:24:48.760]  committed so many crimes they're desperate to get trump out not out of arrogance but out of absolute
[3:24:48.760 --> 3:24:59.080]  cornered rat necessity yes if they see a way to foment uh anger to foment division against the
[3:24:59.080 --> 3:25:06.200]  president if they start to see the politics uh of the american people so america's center of
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:11.720]  gravity has always been public opinion right the russians understood this the chinese understood
[3:25:11.720 --> 3:25:18.200]  this they understand that because we're a democracy we're beholden to the wishes of our people if our
[3:25:18.200 --> 3:25:23.320]  people start to lose faith in a government we lose faith in a president then it's time to strike this
[3:25:23.320 --> 3:25:28.440]  would happen under nixon uh some argue this is what happened under jfk they're trying to establish
[3:25:28.440 --> 3:25:33.160]  that this is definitely what happened with the vietnam war they're trying to establish the same
[3:25:33.160 --> 3:25:38.760]  type of circumstances the same type of information environment to take the president out either
[3:25:38.760 --> 3:25:45.640]  willingly or unwillingly shows yours my friend great points thank you very much alex well the
[3:25:45.640 --> 3:25:52.280]  one thing that i definitely wanted to cover today that we saw uh this actually was a massive report
[3:25:52.280 --> 3:25:57.400]  last night by by believe it or not cnn where i don't know if other people saw this but i've got
[3:25:57.400 --> 3:26:02.760]  the link up i'm showing it to other people we're now we've been talking about this russia
[3:26:03.480 --> 3:26:10.120]  collusion this russia did russia uh work with the trump administration was there any information
[3:26:10.120 --> 3:26:17.320]  any meetings any emails collusion with russia with vladimir putin what we saw now is that number one
[3:26:17.320 --> 3:26:24.600]  there were a couple of facebook ads not very much however facebook and twitter have now come forward
[3:26:24.600 --> 3:26:30.520]  and in a massive report believe it or not cnn they're kind of cutely dancing around the fact
[3:26:30.520 --> 3:26:36.920]  about this they're admitting that one of the major black lives matter accounts this account called
[3:26:36.920 --> 3:26:43.160]  black divists was actually run by the russian government now cnn is is basing this off of
[3:26:43.160 --> 3:26:47.640]  sources so i want everyone to take it with a grain of salt because again it's cnn and we don't know
[3:26:47.640 --> 3:26:52.840]  we've learned that cnn is willing to push fake news if it fits their narrative however the reason
[3:26:52.840 --> 3:26:57.960]  that this report specifically stuck out to me was because it goes in the face of the russia
[3:26:57.960 --> 3:27:02.760]  narrative it goes in the face of the narrative that russia and bladmer putin were the ones who
[3:27:02.760 --> 3:27:07.480]  were trying to get trump elected well obama had hundreds of big ngo spending billions of year in
[3:27:07.480 --> 3:27:11.560]  russia i said i turned over to you you're making a great point russia's half overthrown by the
[3:27:11.560 --> 3:27:15.400]  less so just because money comes out of a russian company it does something doesn't mean it either
[3:27:15.400 --> 3:27:20.760]  way exactly and alex when i was there in austin earlier this week we talked about this urian
[3:27:20.760 --> 3:27:26.200]  drop off all the other kgb directors before he was the party secretary back in the 60s and 70s
[3:27:26.200 --> 3:27:32.360]  they knew that that to break america up you had to push those racial fault lines you had to find
[3:27:32.360 --> 3:27:38.520]  those racial divisions and inflame those tensions and so this idea of fomenting a revolution or
[3:27:38.520 --> 3:27:43.720]  fomenting some sort of a racial division race war the kgb called it back in those days it's
[3:27:43.720 --> 3:27:50.040]  apparently the same tactics we're now seeing with the kgb well and their successful organizations
[3:27:50.040 --> 3:27:54.680]  in russian propaganda arms this is what actual disinformation looks like because if you look at
[3:27:54.680 --> 3:27:59.320]  some of this stuff and i've got it pinned at my twitter account it's all it's it's all saying that
[3:27:59.320 --> 3:28:06.440]  uh the kkk has taken over the u.s government it's anti police it's anti government anti authority
[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:11.720]  and there's basically calls for uh for african americans to rise up to throw off the chains of
[3:28:11.720 --> 3:28:17.560]  the u.s government that's what the this is calling for this is russian disinformation it falls very
[3:28:17.560 --> 3:28:21.720]  much in line with the same type of racial tensions that we're seeing from globalists from other
[3:28:21.720 --> 3:28:27.880]  organizations and to your point alex it's not just the idea that uh because it's coming from russia
[3:28:27.880 --> 3:28:34.040]  that means it must be vladimir putin we're not sure who exactly in russia is pushing this stuff
[3:28:34.040 --> 3:28:40.120]  so if you look at it yeah you've got it up now on the screen uh basically calling for the overthrow
[3:28:40.120 --> 3:28:46.280]  of police the attacks on police attacks on the government this is huge stuff but of course the
[3:28:46.280 --> 3:28:51.160]  mainstream media isn't going to have some major national outrage over it they're going to report
[3:28:51.160 --> 3:28:55.800]  it once and i i predict they're not going to bring it up again because it falls completely
[3:28:55.800 --> 3:29:01.080]  contrary to their narrative that the russians were doing everything they could to uh to push
[3:29:01.080 --> 3:29:05.880]  donald trump when in fact they were not doing that they were seeking chaos they were seeking division
[3:29:05.880 --> 3:29:12.040]  that is the traditional form of disinformation the traditional form of psyops that we've seen
[3:29:12.040 --> 3:29:18.440]  for many many times under uh under the russian government and so when i see all of this coming
[3:29:18.440 --> 3:29:25.880]  out it makes a lot more sense to me as a trained uh intelligence officer at my previous experience
[3:29:25.880 --> 3:29:29.800]  as to see what's coming out we've got a lot more coming up folks we're going to have
[3:29:29.800 --> 3:29:34.440]  journalists independent journalists jacob wall come up to talk more collusion between facebook
[3:29:34.440 --> 3:29:39.400]  and possibly the hillary clinton campaign that's right it's facebook leaks julia sondra's talking

[3:31:59.480 --> 3:32:04.520]  and in the last four or five years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the
[3:32:04.520 --> 3:32:10.600]  elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much
[3:32:10.600 --> 3:32:16.920]  better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that
[3:32:16.920 --> 3:32:22.520]  they were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just
[3:32:22.520 --> 3:32:30.360]  have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing
[3:32:30.360 --> 3:32:35.960]  and supercharging the body at the same time info wars isn't just fighting the globalist we're
[3:32:35.960 --> 3:32:42.120]  getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because

[3:33:06.360 --> 3:33:11.960]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen info wars big fourth hour jack posovic guest hosting
[3:33:11.960 --> 3:33:17.240]  really happy to be here very much appreciative we've got on the line jacob wall this amazing
[3:33:17.240 --> 3:33:23.160]  independent young journalist who's come out massive scoops massive analysis and one thing
[3:33:23.160 --> 3:33:30.200]  that i saw last night it was very interesting i was looking on twitter and i saw julien assange
[3:33:30.200 --> 3:33:35.240]  on his account started tweeting out some emails from john padesa and i said well it's julien
[3:33:35.240 --> 3:33:39.480]  assange and john padesa emails are certainly nothing new there but i started to look at them
[3:33:39.480 --> 3:33:44.040]  and i started to read more into what was going on and certainly read into the news cycles of the day
[3:33:44.040 --> 3:33:48.680]  where we're finding out now that mark zuckerberg has essentially admitted that he colluded with
[3:33:48.680 --> 3:33:55.000]  russia he ran russian disinformation ads both for trump against trump for bernie against bernie all
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:34:00.760]  sorts of stuff out there and we then i saw this report it was an email from zuckerberg and padesa
[3:34:00.760 --> 3:34:05.320]  essentially talking about colluding to rig the election so i was trying to figure out what's
[3:34:05.320 --> 3:34:10.280]  going on and i saw that jacob had written this excellent article up at offended america i want
[3:34:10.280 --> 3:34:15.160]  everyone to go and see it and i want to welcome jacob on the show on info wars to break that down
[3:34:15.160 --> 3:34:20.520]  for us jacob how's it going hey jack it's great to be here uh yeah i mean it's as clear as day it's
[3:34:20.520 --> 3:34:27.240]  all come out now uh russia wanted hillary clinton to win and you just were mentioning russia wants
[3:34:27.240 --> 3:34:33.880]  revolutionary forces in the united states they want to overthrow uh natural order law and order
[3:34:33.880 --> 3:34:38.200]  that's what they're into and what the media keeps getting wrong is that they think that
[3:34:38.200 --> 3:34:43.560]  trump is a revolutionary they think that trump represents an explosion in the american order
[3:34:43.560 --> 3:34:50.120]  and that's not what he is trump is pure americana he's traditional he's back to the constitution
[3:34:50.120 --> 3:34:54.600]  if you want to talk about revolutionaries look at hillary exactly so let's break down some of
[3:34:54.600 --> 3:35:00.680]  these emails what exactly was going on between marp zuckerberg and john padesa that julina signs
[3:35:00.680 --> 3:35:06.120]  wanted to call our attention to so just just a timeline here to start off okay the first thing
[3:35:06.120 --> 3:35:11.400]  that happened is that hillary's top lawyer for her campaign worked for facebook in 2011
[3:35:11.400 --> 3:35:15.880]  and got them a special letter from the federal election commission so that they would not have
[3:35:15.880 --> 3:35:20.680]  to disclose the spending that took place on political ads five years later that's this
[3:35:20.680 --> 3:35:26.440]  gentleman works for hillary clinton and what happens is charles sandberg in 2015 is sending
[3:35:26.440 --> 3:35:31.480]  direct emails to hillary clinton saying it was wonderful she met with me she was magical with
[3:35:31.480 --> 3:35:36.200]  my kids whatever that means so we're seeing a revolving door between facebook executives
[3:35:36.200 --> 3:35:40.520]  and facebook or excuse me and hillary clinton campaign going back and forth what now they're
[3:35:40.520 --> 3:35:44.440]  there now they're working for hillary it's essentially the exact same people going back
[3:35:44.440 --> 3:35:49.560]  and forth bringing their roll indexes bringing their connections and influence from them from
[3:35:49.560 --> 3:35:54.360]  organization to the other good right right and what this lawyer argued in front of the federal
[3:35:54.360 --> 3:35:59.320]  election commission is he argued that the reason they shouldn't have to disclose ad spending
[3:35:59.320 --> 3:36:03.640]  is because facebook ads are like a pin that you put on your shirt or a bumper sticker
[3:36:03.640 --> 3:36:09.160]  he said they're not a big deal so which one is it is the russian low budget hundred thousand
[3:36:09.160 --> 3:36:13.800]  dollar operation to buy facebook ads something that swings the election or is it a small thing
[3:36:13.800 --> 3:36:18.040]  because hillary's own people argued in front of the election commission that it doesn't make a
[3:36:18.040 --> 3:36:22.920]  difference so which one is it and the media what exactly what exactly there is that line
[3:36:22.920 --> 3:36:27.080]  that uh that that assigns call attention i thought was so important that charles sandberg said in
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:32.600]  her email so the facebook executive charles sandberg what did she say specifically to john
[3:36:32.600 --> 3:36:42.200]  pedesta she she said and i quote i want to help any way i can i still want hrc to win badly i mean
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:47.960]  you can hrc hillary rotham clinton that's right and a reminder charles sandberg is the c o o of
[3:36:47.960 --> 3:36:53.000]  facebook she's in the trenches every day she's a senior executive she reports directly to mark
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:58.520]  zuckerberg and then we've got zuckerberg in a very long memo to the clinton campaign begging
[3:36:58.520 --> 3:37:02.760]  and pleading for a for a meeting with hillary clinton he says i know you're busy but i need a meeting
[3:37:02.760 --> 3:37:07.000]  badly i want to help you out any way that i can talking specifically i know just ahead of the
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:13.240]  campaign but actually actually john pedesta so zuckerberg is specifically or uh asking requesting
[3:37:13.240 --> 3:37:19.160]  for a meeting with john pedesta chairman uh someone who as far as i can tell doesn't actually have
[3:37:19.160 --> 3:37:25.000]  much background in the tech community but what he does have a background is in is in the swamp and
[3:37:25.000 --> 3:37:30.360]  swamp tactics and linking together globalist politicians and uh other organizations there
[3:37:30.360 --> 3:37:36.760]  in washington dc that's right and so what they likely organized it's looking like is that they
[3:37:36.760 --> 3:37:42.360]  organized a russian ad by a very small one okay a hundred thousand dollars is nothing it's a drop
[3:37:42.360 --> 3:37:46.520]  in the bucket relative to all the ad spending but we have to remember russia's got the same gdp
[3:37:46.520 --> 3:37:51.000]  per capita actually slightly less than granada this is not a rich country that we're talking about
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:57.000]  and they did a low budget ad by the ads as we've mentioned were black lives matter ads they were
[3:37:57.000 --> 3:38:01.320]  pro hillary clinton ads and again hillary clinton's the revolutionary not trump she's the one that
[3:38:01.320 --> 3:38:07.480]  wants to shift us over to uh basically communism white and so that's what happened uh facebook
[3:38:07.480 --> 3:38:12.040]  together with the clinton campaign and we know that charles sandberg did meet with hillary it
[3:38:12.040 --> 3:38:17.960]  sounds like hillary came to her house because she said that hillary was magical with her kids that
[3:38:17.960 --> 3:38:24.360]  we know uh we don't know if the podesta zuckerberg meeting took place physically i'm sure they had
[3:38:24.360 --> 3:38:29.160]  correspondences we see the emails uh but we don't know that they met in person however facebook
[3:38:29.160 --> 3:38:34.440]  see what we're talking about multiple meeting potential multiple meetings between the hillary
[3:38:34.440 --> 3:38:40.040]  campaign john podesta and facebook one that they admit to which is specifically between
[3:38:40.040 --> 3:38:45.240]  hillary clinton there is another one i think was on hillary's um agenda her schedule when she was
[3:38:45.240 --> 3:38:50.040]  in new york city one day in i think march uh about research what was that kind of research what was
[3:38:50.040 --> 3:38:56.120]  that meeting well this dates back to 2015 and if anybody should be calling attention to these
[3:38:56.120 --> 3:39:01.240]  emails it's bernie sanders okay they were rigging the election for hillary clinton against bernie
[3:39:01.240 --> 3:39:06.040]  sanders this was only 2015 at the time and as we know there was tons of rigging that went on don
[3:39:06.040 --> 3:39:10.760]  and brazil of cnn gave the debate questions to hillary and didn't give them to bernie uh it
[3:39:10.760 --> 3:39:15.800]  was a completely rigged race against bernie sanders and now we know that that all dates back
[3:39:15.800 --> 3:39:21.480]  to facebook in 2015 having in-person meetings with hillary clinton having in-person meetings uh
[3:39:21.480 --> 3:39:25.960]  potentially between zuckerberg and podesta but at bare minimum having regular correspondences
[3:39:25.960 --> 3:39:31.480]  and saying i want hrc to win badly presumably that means against sanders it can also mean
[3:39:31.480 --> 3:39:35.080]  against whoever the republican candidate is but at the time they didn't know that the candidate
[3:39:35.080 --> 3:39:41.080]  would be trump important to remember timeline here but if the if the collusion happened in 2015 it
[3:39:41.080 --> 3:39:45.320]  certainly happened in 2016 in the general election there's no reason to believe that if they would
[3:39:45.320 --> 3:39:51.640]  stop and remember this we also know we know already and that since we're going back here to 2015
[3:39:51.640 --> 3:39:56.280]  we also have to remember that what came out during 2016 and i know i actually had a reporter
[3:39:56.280 --> 3:40:00.200]  reach out to me today and say jack why are you posting all this old stuff about facebook this
[3:40:00.200 --> 3:40:04.840]  stuff was reported this all came out and i said well hold on a second because we have to re-examine
[3:40:04.840 --> 3:40:11.160]  this information in the new light of what's coming out regarding the collusion between facebook and
[3:40:11.160 --> 3:40:16.520]  russia mark zuckerberg admitting to the russian ad buys what other ad buys were going on what
[3:40:16.520 --> 3:40:20.920]  else was going on so you have to re-examine this old information and other information that we saw
[3:40:20.920 --> 3:40:27.800]  very specifically uh during them was number one the that news ticker the trends on facebook it
[3:40:27.800 --> 3:40:32.920]  came out and this this was not in some sort of right wing uh uh magazine believe it was gizmodo
[3:40:32.920 --> 3:40:38.840]  that came out and said there actually were staffers at facebook that were changing the news trends
[3:40:38.840 --> 3:40:43.880]  whatever trending topics trending articles to be anti trump and to be pro hillary they were
[3:40:43.880 --> 3:40:52.760]  specifically and uh and demonstrably doing this then secondly we saw that facebook was censoring
[3:40:52.760 --> 3:40:57.320]  wiki leaks it came out and facebook essentially admitted it essentially admitted this was a new
[3:40:57.320 --> 3:41:02.680]  york post anyone can go and look at this that they were coming out and if you posted wiki leaks to
[3:41:02.680 --> 3:41:07.320]  facebook people remember this because every time they came out like a new drop they would trend all
[3:41:07.320 --> 3:41:12.440]  over twitter but facebook they didn't have the same kind of reach they admitted that they were
[3:41:12.440 --> 3:41:19.960]  blocking wiki leaks so now we when we look at all of this in totality when we look at all of this
[3:41:19.960 --> 3:41:24.840]  with the light of the new evidence in terms of zuckerberg admitting that there was russian
[3:41:24.840 --> 3:41:31.720]  involvement now we're seeing now we're seeing that it's potentially that the blocks to wiki leaks
[3:41:31.720 --> 3:41:38.120]  were to cover up their own tracks were to could it have been that they were blocking wiki leaks
[3:41:38.120 --> 3:41:44.760]  because they wanted to cover up the fact that they themselves as facebook were working with hillary
[3:41:44.760 --> 3:41:49.880]  clinton that they were working with the russians that they were spreading this this information
[3:41:49.880 --> 3:41:55.480]  that group russian groups like this black divists were were out there talking about uh fomenting
[3:41:55.480 --> 3:42:00.840]  revolution against the government well that's almost certainly police stuff exactly so that's
[3:42:00.840 --> 3:42:06.920]  almost certainly well how do you look at how do you look at that older evidence in light of this
[3:42:06.920 --> 3:42:11.000]  new evidence how do you look at that it was old reports in light of this new evidence jacob well
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:15.720]  i'll tell you why this new evidence is coming up and i'll tell you kind of why this is relevant
[3:42:15.720 --> 3:42:21.000]  again and that's because we are not the only ones examining what john pedesta was doing in the
[3:42:21.000 --> 3:42:27.880]  election with facebook cnn is not the only one doing that robert muller the special counsel
[3:42:27.880 --> 3:42:32.440]  subpoenaed the pedesta group which was started by john pedesta and during the election was run
[3:42:32.440 --> 3:42:38.120]  by his brother tony pedesta who became famous when he was inviting john pedesta to a spirit
[3:42:38.120 --> 3:42:42.360]  cooking dinner that's the first time i heard about tony pedesta but both of them were called
[3:42:42.360 --> 3:42:47.000]  in front of the special counsel to testify it's unclear whether that testimony was under oath
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:51.480]  but it did take place last week now when roger stone gets called to testify in front of a house
[3:42:51.480 --> 3:42:57.960]  committee it's cover to cover news for three days the media utterly ignored the fact that john
[3:42:57.960 --> 3:43:05.160]  pedesta and the pedesta group the entire political consulting group was subpoenaed by muller and called
[3:43:05.160 --> 3:43:11.720]  the testify why is that maybe muller's looking at pedesta collusion we don't know but it's extremely
[3:43:11.720 --> 3:43:15.400]  disturbing to look at and then there's new evidence that's going to come out every day
[3:43:15.400 --> 3:43:21.240]  because this muller investigation is perhaps the leakiest investigation we've ever seen and
[3:43:21.240 --> 3:43:25.640]  in every other respect it's like the kgb the only way it's not is because they leak non-stop
[3:43:27.000 --> 3:43:32.920]  you know one thing that i would like to see is when is muller now going to go and subpoena
[3:43:32.920 --> 3:43:39.080]  mark zuckerberg and charles sandberg so we're talking about election interference who interfered
[3:43:39.080 --> 3:43:44.120]  who meddled who bought ads who was running ads who was running disinformation campaigns
[3:43:44.120 --> 3:43:51.640]  doesn't now muller have not only the political opening but also the legal mandate in terms of
[3:43:51.640 --> 3:43:59.320]  the purview of his special counsel ship doesn't he now have the not only authority but mandates
[3:43:59.320 --> 3:44:05.480]  to go and issue a subpoena for mark zuckerberg's communications for mark zuckerberg to see now
[3:44:05.480 --> 3:44:10.520]  we remember the wiki leaks the john pedesta emails ended at a certain point they didn't go all the way
[3:44:10.520 --> 3:44:15.640]  through the election so we wouldn't know what other communications that mark zuckerberg may
[3:44:15.640 --> 3:44:19.720]  have had to collude with the hillbilly clinton campaign we don't know if they exist this would
[3:44:19.720 --> 3:44:23.960]  to my mind and i'm not a lawyer and i'm and you're not a lawyer but but i would like to run this
[3:44:23.960 --> 3:44:31.960]  by a lawyer to see does this grant essentially probable cause to show that mark zuckerberg
[3:44:31.960 --> 3:44:37.880]  and other executives at facebook other executives at big tech we're essentially putting their
[3:44:37.880 --> 3:44:44.200]  finger on the scales of the justice department what do you think well we don't we can't rely on
[3:44:44.200 --> 3:44:49.240]  muller to to be you know an ethical reliable investigator most of his team is top hillary
[3:44:49.240 --> 3:44:56.120]  clinton and barack obama donors however this evidence did provide probable cause to somebody
[3:44:56.120 --> 3:45:00.280]  not muller but the trump administration who we just learned in the new york post last night
[3:45:00.280 --> 3:45:04.920]  this is reported everywhere obtained a search warrant not a subpoena but a search warrant
[3:45:04.920 --> 3:45:10.600]  granted by a judge to gain access to the information of more than 6000 facebook accounts
[3:45:11.160 --> 3:45:14.440]  all we know about the accounts at this point is that they're anti trump that we know
[3:45:15.240 --> 3:45:22.040]  so some judge somewhere saw the mandate to investigate facebook and issued not a subpoena
[3:45:22.040 --> 3:45:26.920]  but a search warrant to do so and the trump administration actually this is actually massive
[3:45:26.920 --> 3:45:30.920]  but i want i want people understand this that what you're talking about is breaking news this
[3:45:30.920 --> 3:45:35.720]  hasn't been covered very much by mainstream media we're going to bring it up here but essentially
[3:45:35.720 --> 3:45:41.880]  that a judge has issued a search warrant for facebook accounts now break break down a little
[3:45:41.880 --> 3:45:47.240]  bit more of these accounts i haven't seen this report myself but is this are these bot accounts
[3:45:47.240 --> 3:45:51.880]  that we're seeing being anti trump or these private citizens on their personal accounts jacob
[3:45:52.520 --> 3:45:56.760]  well what we know is that there was one particular account that they looked at which was one of three
[3:45:56.760 --> 3:46:02.840]  kind of main accounts these were page accounts that lead to websites jeff sessions had previously
[3:46:02.840 --> 3:46:08.840]  obtained a warrant to get server data from the hosting company that runs the website that this
[3:46:08.840 --> 3:46:15.000]  page links to now he's obtained a warrant to go in and that was that was that was disrupt j20 right
[3:46:15.720 --> 3:46:20.200]  that's right disrupt j20 that was disrupt j20 so right so you're talking about and i know about
[3:46:20.200 --> 3:46:27.240]  this one uh i could actually tell a funny story about this um but i know about the disrupt j20 so
[3:46:27.240 --> 3:46:33.960]  sessions has been going after antifa websites is and disrupt j20 is essentially an antifa front
[3:46:33.960 --> 3:46:39.800]  group now i can actually uh uh talk a little bit more in depth about this one because i actually
[3:46:39.800 --> 3:46:47.080]  got a a a request a message from that in terms of the company because i actually had an account
[3:46:47.080 --> 3:46:53.000]  with one of those websites that i was using with disrupt j20 that i was using to monitor that what
[3:46:53.000 --> 3:46:57.560]  was going on to monitor their activity so because i had had that account with sort of an email that
[3:46:57.560 --> 3:47:03.960]  i had set up just for that purpose i actually was a lot was one of the people that got that got the
[3:47:03.960 --> 3:47:08.200]  message as well from them so yes i can you're actually i'm glad to hear that because that
[3:47:08.200 --> 3:47:11.720]  means that the investing i'm really happy to hear that because what that means is that these
[3:47:11.720 --> 3:47:16.200]  investigations are working i mean they're really getting to every last one of the accounts you're
[3:47:16.200 --> 3:47:21.960]  telling us that you just had a an account that was used to monitor it and even you got a notification
[3:47:21.960 --> 3:47:27.960]  from them so that tells us clear as day that jeff sessions is going after this and and going after
[3:47:27.960 --> 3:47:32.920]  it uh extremely aggressively which is important and we know that this these groups are associated
[3:47:32.920 --> 3:47:38.680]  with antifa uh they are violent groups they were declared domestic terrorist groups as far back as
[3:47:38.680 --> 3:47:44.600]  april 2016 before trump ever came into power uh and what we know is that there's as many as six
[3:47:44.600 --> 3:47:51.000]  thousand other accounts whose passwords usernames credit card information and anything else that
[3:47:51.000 --> 3:47:55.240]  facebook has is not going to be turned over but it's going to be taken a big difference between
[3:47:55.240 --> 3:47:59.880]  a subpoena and a search warrant is this is not a request this is a notification that we're coming
[3:47:59.880 --> 3:48:05.000]  in and we're getting the data uh on behalf of the doj is yeah there's basically been this big
[3:48:05.000 --> 3:48:10.360]  thing and i was i was reading very um last night about this and there's basically been a change right
[3:48:10.360 --> 3:48:15.240]  in the way that we view our technology companies the way that we view platforms it kind of you in
[3:48:15.240 --> 3:48:19.800]  the early days of the internet used to always be well whatever you know you're not responsible for
[3:48:19.800 --> 3:48:24.360]  the content you're only responsible for providing a platform right that was sort of the way things
[3:48:24.360 --> 3:48:30.040]  went with the internet but all of this changed after and if you go back it goes after charlottesville
[3:48:30.040 --> 3:48:34.120]  when charlottesville happened suddenly the game changed the rules changed and they said well we're
[3:48:34.120 --> 3:48:38.920]  going to clamp down on these hate groups and at first it was cracking down and they're rightfully
[3:48:38.920 --> 3:48:44.920]  so cracking down on these anti uh these these these races these white supremacist groups but now
[3:48:44.920 --> 3:48:51.400]  we're realizing that the same tools the same environment the same statistics the same uh
[3:48:51.400 --> 3:48:56.520]  constrictions the same circumstances can be used to go after other extremist groups and in this case
[3:48:56.520 --> 3:49:02.200]  the case of search warrants executed faithfully and constitutionally under the court amendment
[3:49:02.200 --> 3:49:06.600]  against antifa and here's that's an important difference between what we see here because
[3:49:06.600 --> 3:49:09.400]  i know some people are going to hear this you're going to say you know that sounds a little bit
[3:49:09.400 --> 3:49:13.720]  authoritarian to go after every facebook account that was associated with this i don't know about
[3:49:13.720 --> 3:49:18.920]  that but here's the big difference between what trump did and what obama did trump got a search
[3:49:18.920 --> 3:49:25.400]  warrant in a real court a public court in front of a real judge when obama was busy wiretapping
[3:49:25.400 --> 3:49:31.560]  trump tower he was getting fisa warrants which take place in a secret national security court
[3:49:31.560 --> 3:49:35.800]  and are traditionally only supposed to be used against foreign adversaries like al qaeda and for
[3:49:35.800 --> 3:49:40.600]  good reason you don't want al qaeda to know that we're that we're surveilling them but obama abused
[3:49:40.600 --> 3:49:46.520]  the fisa court and used it against american citizens i.e paul manifold so this is a big
[3:49:46.520 --> 3:49:51.480]  difference trump didn't use the fisa court he didn't use secret search warrants and kgb tactics
[3:49:51.480 --> 3:49:57.640]  like muller has used and like the fbi under comey used he's using legitimate tactics to exactly these
[3:49:57.640 --> 3:50:02.360]  are the tactics the law and order that we've talked about now a lot of people say hey i wish i knew
[3:50:02.360 --> 3:50:06.440]  there were more about it i wish i heard more about what was going on but obviously the justice
[3:50:06.440 --> 3:50:11.240]  department jeff sessions knows about opsec he knows that if you start telling people who is under
[3:50:11.240 --> 3:50:15.400]  investigation they're gonna that's when they start destroying evidence we got 30 seconds left jacob
