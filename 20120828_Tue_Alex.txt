[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:40.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.560 --> 00:46.560]  ladies and gentlemen get your engines started because it is another live
[00:46.560 --> 00:55.040]  worldwide transmission we are going to be here for the next three hours and we
[00:55.040 --> 01:02.040]  have joining us coming up in the second hour always informative Alfred Adask
[01:02.040 --> 01:10.640]  60 minutes calls him a super patriot a evil sovereign citizen type I find to
[01:10.640 --> 01:14.280]  be very articulate and informative we haven't had him on probably in six months
[01:14.280 --> 01:20.000]  we'll get a updated view from him on the status of the world and what's
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.240]  happening in his own battle with the globalist so that is coming up of the
[01:27.240 --> 01:32.600]  drudge report is now helping to make a story national that we have really been
[01:32.600 --> 01:36.360]  trying to focus on and no I'm not just talking about the case of Brandon Robb
[01:36.360 --> 01:42.320]  the Marine held for a week for absolutely no reason for his brother and
[01:42.320 --> 01:49.920]  sister in his own Facebook comments that were not calls to action or violent and
[01:49.920 --> 01:53.720]  that whole saga since then we have fleshed out the fact that they are
[01:53.720 --> 01:57.920]  grabbing veterans all over the United States for their political speech and
[01:57.920 --> 02:03.280]  grabbing people off their back porches cleaning their guns you name it they're
[02:03.280 --> 02:09.920]  using involuntary commitment to do that and now a Suzanne postal story from
[02:09.920 --> 02:13.920]  info wars comm is on the number one website in the world drug report comm
[02:13.920 --> 02:19.800]  US veterans forcibly sequestered in mental hospitals is indefinite detention
[02:19.800 --> 02:26.400]  so very good news that that is now out there and it's also up at info wars
[02:26.400 --> 02:37.520]  comm and we will certainly ask all of the listeners to get that out to everyone
[02:37.520 --> 02:45.320]  because only exposure will will be able to reveal what's happening also I've
[02:45.320 --> 02:52.200]  seen these actually driving around in Texas but it's in the news more and
[02:52.200 --> 02:57.480]  more that not just on the border but all over the United States these giant
[02:57.480 --> 03:04.280]  wheeled armored trucks different variants of them painted black are showing up
[03:04.280 --> 03:10.920]  with homeland security dressed up in these futuristic military outfits again
[03:10.920 --> 03:15.960]  just another sign of the ongoing incremental martial law system that is
[03:15.960 --> 03:21.120]  unfolding we're going to be going over some of that today there are two
[03:21.120 --> 03:27.760]  different reports it's in the Minneapolis Star Tribune and it's on local
[03:27.760 --> 03:31.520]  television there but we have two different reports by our reporters at
[03:31.520 --> 03:34.680]  info wars comm and prison planet comm curtain and more info lots and with
[03:34.680 --> 03:37.880]  different angles on this black Hawk helicopters over Minneapolis worry
[03:37.880 --> 03:42.520]  residents concerned observers call media police last night report choppers now
[03:42.520 --> 03:51.080]  when they would do these urban drills in 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 2000 the
[03:51.080 --> 03:55.920]  media even if you had footage of them blowing up a building they covertly
[03:55.920 --> 04:00.400]  leased they would come on the news and say it doesn't exist I have a news
[04:00.400 --> 04:05.000]  article hanging out there on the wall a news clipping with the Austin American
[04:05.000 --> 04:10.160]  Statesman saying that I was basically a conspiracy theorist and crazy that I
[04:10.160 --> 04:15.320]  talked about black helicopters next to an article about the black helicopter
[04:15.320 --> 04:19.600]  raids making people have heart attacks at a nursing home 300 feet away from the
[04:19.600 --> 04:26.720]  police station they blew up in Kingsville by the way we have footage of it
[04:26.720 --> 04:34.080]  they had MPs one time in San Antonio come over and say give us your tape and
[04:34.080 --> 04:40.920]  Mike Hansen wouldn't do it so the MP pulled his Beretta 9 millimeter up I
[04:40.920 --> 04:46.960]  mean it's all completely lawless that what they're doing but it's to acclimate
[04:46.960 --> 04:50.600]  and condition everybody we're gonna be going over that homeland security is
[04:50.600 --> 04:55.360]  expanding the sporting events TSA now rolling out they want to have the new

[08:19.520 --> 08:37.160]  Alex Jones
[08:37.160 --> 08:46.960]  ladies and gentlemen it is Tuesday the 28th day of what month is it I'm joking
[08:46.960 --> 08:53.680]  of August 2012 and we are going to be here for the next three hours today
[08:53.680 --> 09:02.200]  well before I plunge into all of the news here it makes my head spin how fast
[09:02.200 --> 09:07.520]  the world is moving how fast the years are moving how fast the time is flying
[09:07.520 --> 09:14.880]  I know everyone marvels at this but here we are right now spinning around on the
[09:14.880 --> 09:23.800]  surface of this globe and it seems like yesterday was just the year 2001 and
[09:23.800 --> 09:30.840]  it's already nearing the end before we know it we'll be into 2013 and you
[09:30.840 --> 09:37.120]  watch will all still be here after December 21st and the supposed end of
[09:37.120 --> 09:44.120]  the Mayan calendar it's amazing how people put stock in such baloney even if
[09:44.120 --> 09:49.960]  you believe in Mayan mysticism and astrology and astronomy you have to
[09:49.960 --> 09:56.280]  understand that their own tablets and religious analysis simply said it's the
[09:56.280 --> 10:06.640]  end of an age it's the end of an age in December of 2012 the end of an age the
[10:06.640 --> 10:16.120]  lighting of a new hearth a new fire will be set in the fireplace and of course
[10:16.120 --> 10:22.360]  the hearth is the seat of the Sun so is the Sun going to go dark and then light
[10:22.360 --> 10:30.640]  back up in some Luciferian exercise I'm just waiting for the quote mainstream
[10:30.640 --> 10:36.360]  dinosaur media and you better believe that they will do something like this to
[10:36.360 --> 10:43.600]  come out and blame the entire alternative media or promoting 2012 when
[10:43.600 --> 10:49.240]  it's actually the mainstream media and popular culture that has been basically
[10:49.240 --> 10:54.480]  force-fed on the public but I'm already digressing here thank you again for
[10:54.480 --> 11:01.200]  joining us on this Tuesday 28th of August 2012 edition I am Alex Jones your
[11:01.200 --> 11:06.340]  host and I am simply someone that wants liberty and freedom in my time I want
[11:06.340 --> 11:13.480]  my wonderful children to grow up in a free society and to enjoy some of the
[11:13.480 --> 11:19.040]  basic liberties that I had growing up that now to a great extent are on the
[11:19.040 --> 11:25.880]  ash heap of history no one can deny that our culture is being converted from a
[11:25.880 --> 11:33.480]  free society to an authoritarian society every authoritarian tyrannical
[11:33.480 --> 11:41.240]  oppressive centralized benchmark is being met and exceeded and the
[11:41.240 --> 11:46.880]  establishment itself admits that they want to convert not only to a political
[11:46.880 --> 11:53.520]  tyranny but a physical and economic tyranny by design so the ruling class
[11:53.520 --> 11:57.680]  the people that own the puppet presidents and prime ministers are on
[11:57.680 --> 12:03.360]  record in the Royal Society of England the United Nations the Club of
[12:03.360 --> 12:09.120]  Rome the Council on Foreign Relations at nauseam books published by German
[12:09.120 --> 12:13.800]  prime ministers and presidents and chancellors Germany as a president a
[12:13.800 --> 12:19.360]  chancellor president chancellor European prime ministers Asian prime ministers
[12:19.360 --> 12:25.360]  and presidents it's all promoted in our face knowing the general public does not
[12:25.360 --> 12:35.280]  read political white papers does not read economics text is not investigating it
[12:35.280 --> 12:48.000]  and so the establishment can operate basically as they please as if we are in
[12:48.000 --> 12:59.960]  a coma I liken to the analogy to we are all basically in comas in our beds and
[12:59.960 --> 13:06.800]  the people rocking the cradle are vampires and imagine a society where
[13:06.800 --> 13:13.080]  conscious focused intelligent vampires can get away with whatever they want
[13:13.080 --> 13:19.840]  however they want with a sleeping population and of course I'm not seeing
[13:19.840 --> 13:23.640]  their literal vampires but they might as well be because it's the same effect
[13:23.640 --> 13:39.240]  they have a disdain for the public they also work as hard as they can to keep us
[13:39.240 --> 13:50.000]  in this mind numbed position and I am simply here to try to get people to
[13:50.000 --> 13:57.840]  understand that our society is sliding towards absolute humiliating and
[13:57.840 --> 14:11.040]  saddening and denigrating of everything that is innocent and good and I am
[14:11.040 --> 14:16.560]  trying my best to not just reach out to the general public but to reach out to
[14:16.560 --> 14:22.440]  the substratum of the ruling intelligentsia of the planet to rediscover
[14:22.440 --> 14:31.440]  your humanity and rest control of the levers from the alpha psychos the alpha
[14:31.440 --> 14:41.640]  maggots that are currently in control of the ship that is humanity I thought
[14:41.640 --> 14:45.720]  long and hard today about the points I wanted to make on this subject and I
[14:45.720 --> 14:51.120]  always push it off because there's so much news in the first hour and then by
[14:51.120 --> 14:57.360]  the time I get to later in the third hour I am a bit more tired and it's hard
[14:57.360 --> 15:03.080]  to be able to summon all the different points and datum that I want to bring
[15:03.080 --> 15:18.120]  forward but there is a collective insanity in the ruling class they are
[15:18.120 --> 15:23.760]  not in control of themselves they're in control of almost everything else or
[15:23.760 --> 15:29.480]  attempting to get control of everything and will do anything to get the power
[15:29.480 --> 15:34.320]  and the argument is if they don't get it someone else will get it many of these
[15:34.320 --> 15:39.320]  delusional people actually think they're guardians of humanity when if you look at
[15:39.320 --> 15:49.160]  the fruits of what they've delivered and what they've deployed it is absolute
[15:49.160 --> 16:04.520]  stinking reeking ugly death the fruits of the new world order are abomination
[16:04.520 --> 16:12.840]  absolute total stinking ugliness and I have a large vocabulary but the only
[16:12.840 --> 16:20.680]  word that properly describes it is absolute reeking stench the stench of
[16:20.680 --> 16:33.320]  hell itself a spiritual stench that the soul can smell and you ask why do they
[16:33.320 --> 16:37.280]  do this why are they committed to evil because it is their essence it is their
[16:37.280 --> 16:42.040]  nature it's what they do and they're not going to be argued with they're not
[16:42.040 --> 16:47.960]  going to be convinced out of this but there are many people who are delusional
[16:47.960 --> 16:53.040]  and who are slaves to this system who have never gotten outside their
[16:53.040 --> 16:58.800]  compartmentalization and do not realize that there is a false reality being
[16:58.800 --> 17:05.640]  constructed and woven around them an artificial environment an artificial
[17:05.640 --> 17:14.120]  habitat that's a cross between one of the high-tech squares you see in a place
[17:14.120 --> 17:24.360]  like Times Square and a gulag and it seeks to destroy the very essence of
[17:24.360 --> 17:29.680]  creativity and the very essence of liberty and the very essence of
[17:29.680 --> 17:40.760]  everything good and wholesome and it seeks to create instability and
[17:40.760 --> 17:47.320]  destruction and destabilization all of the globalist policies being carried
[17:47.320 --> 17:50.840]  out in the Middle East to get the sea the Shiites and the Sunnis killing each
[17:50.840 --> 17:58.800]  other people say oh we'll let the Arabs kill each other that's how we'll
[17:58.800 --> 18:03.120]  dominate we'll dominate we don't dominate the Middle East we pay with our
[18:03.120 --> 18:09.320]  money with our blood with our treasure with our name with our bad reputation
[18:09.320 --> 18:16.200]  but but we aren't getting any of the spoils of the Middle East even if you
[18:16.200 --> 18:20.240]  wanted to be evil and and and and feel like you were dominating something and
[18:20.240 --> 18:25.840]  taking something over in fact the globalists want to do to the Middle
[18:25.840 --> 18:29.840]  East in every other country in every other region in every other culture
[18:29.840 --> 18:34.560]  exactly what they're doing to us as well I mean you look at it destroying the
[18:34.560 --> 18:40.120]  family by design on record adulterating and poisoning the food the water the
[18:40.120 --> 18:44.720]  air by design in all their major white papers I'm looking at one over there on
[18:44.720 --> 18:54.240]  the counter eco science written by the White House science are all of this is
[18:54.240 --> 19:00.560]  being done as a scorched earth policy to absolutely wreck society so if you're an
[19:00.560 --> 19:04.560]  Army officer listening and you're engaged in psyops and you know you've got
[19:04.560 --> 19:09.520]  hundreds of people under you engaged in whisper campaigns and disinfo
[19:09.520 --> 19:14.560]  campaigns and false flags and all sorts of other events you you feel pretty
[19:14.560 --> 19:19.400]  powerful you're you're seeing the power of your manipulation but you yourself
[19:19.400 --> 19:25.400]  are in another compartment of a psyop itself so you're living a delusion you
[19:25.400 --> 19:31.240]  don't serve America you serve the bankers who themselves are eugenicist who
[19:31.240 --> 19:38.920]  serve the devil himself but I've already digressed I will try to stay focused
[19:38.920 --> 19:42.440]  write some notes during the break as I wrote a bunch last night and then left
[19:42.440 --> 19:46.200]  them at home and I want to get into the nature of the new world order and really
[19:46.200 --> 19:52.080]  put a call out to everybody serving understand that you don't have a
[19:52.080 --> 19:58.160]  choice you'll either be enslaved and destroyed by the globalist and used or
[19:58.160 --> 20:03.760]  you'll fight back and join humanity Alex Jones here with a great way to beat
[20:03.760 --> 20:07.440]  the blackouts get off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical
[20:07.440 --> 20:10.720]  power folks with what's been going on in this country I don't have to tell you
[20:10.720 --> 20:14.160]  about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is that's in the mainstream
[20:14.160 --> 20:18.080]  news every day millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks
[20:18.080 --> 20:22.160]  because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its
[20:22.160 --> 20:26.440]  capacity I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts
[20:26.440 --> 20:30.640]  and if you don't have a backup system in place I've got a great opportunity for
[20:30.640 --> 20:34.480]  you right now our good friends at solutions from science are offering huge
[20:34.480 --> 20:39.280]  savings on their best-selling power hub unit in fact I think it's the best deal
[20:39.280 --> 20:44.200]  I've ever seen them make it's literally thousands of dollars in savings remember
[20:44.200 --> 20:47.880]  these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar powered that means

[24:38.120 --> 24:44.320]  trying to get jobs that'll actually put food on their family's table the federal
[24:44.320 --> 24:51.120]  government is dissolving in many cities the family unit itself is becoming a
[24:51.120 --> 25:00.240]  thing of the past and I was just thinking about a report yesterday that
[25:00.240 --> 25:05.560]  Paul Watson did that I need to cover talking about here in Austin Texas but
[25:05.560 --> 25:10.160]  it's also another areas the country the students are getting GPS tracker
[25:10.160 --> 25:16.960]  necklaces so the state can follow them around they're being given mentors by the
[25:16.960 --> 25:21.880]  state that check in on them they're called parole officers and of course
[25:21.880 --> 25:26.400]  they're encouraged also spy on their parents it is just such an incredible
[25:26.400 --> 25:31.360]  conversion from a free society and now they've bankrupted people so much and
[25:31.360 --> 25:35.440]  raise the property taxes so much that they're taking our property taxes all
[25:35.440 --> 25:39.480]  over the country and setting up pre-k training notice the more education you
[25:39.480 --> 25:44.360]  get more school days the more hours the more dumb down our children become
[25:44.360 --> 25:48.280]  because it's official policy to turn them into little politically correct
[25:48.280 --> 25:55.040]  adult of fools that can you know obsess over their race all day but can't
[25:55.040 --> 25:59.680]  engage in reading writing or arithmetic all of it by design and the worst the
[25:59.680 --> 26:04.680]  school systems get oh it doesn't matter the more government control is then
[26:04.680 --> 26:10.840]  offered as the solution and it's not insane the war on drugs when they say
[26:10.840 --> 26:14.040]  it's a failure no it's not they ship more drugs in they put more people in
[26:14.040 --> 26:18.800]  prison to go to college to be criminals and they put more money in the big
[26:18.800 --> 26:26.080]  megabanks and criminals go out and rob your houses show that they have money to
[26:26.080 --> 26:30.000]  buy the drugs that are overpriced because the government keeps them illegal
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.320]  and controls the black market I was seeing a statistic last night I was
[26:34.320 --> 26:38.040]  watching News 8 Austin again this is a story that affects everybody across the
[26:38.040 --> 26:46.680]  country and they were talking about Austin being seventh in the nation for
[26:46.680 --> 26:59.400]  home invasions and robberies and property theft and the police of course
[26:59.400 --> 27:03.840]  can't do anything to stop it because this is known as a happy hunting ground
[27:03.840 --> 27:09.440]  by the illegal aliens that's the predominant group but a lot of others as
[27:09.440 --> 27:15.440]  well because this is known where the liberals live and I was looking last
[27:15.440 --> 27:19.480]  night on the Austin Police Department's own crime maps and you can find them
[27:19.480 --> 27:24.640]  online the the crime hot spots it's all the liberal areas it's not even the
[27:24.640 --> 27:30.320]  ghettos in areas they go into the areas that are known to be super ultra liberal
[27:30.320 --> 27:35.200]  that have the bike lanes taken over the streets and everything and areas where
[27:35.200 --> 27:39.080]  if you're not a liberal you're not welcome and it's all the super trendy
[27:39.080 --> 27:44.680]  areas are a happy hunting ground of mugging and stealing and killing and
[27:44.680 --> 27:51.080]  carjacking and the other areas the areas where people are armed and where you
[27:51.080 --> 27:56.480]  have a more libertarian demographic the crime rate is very low Texas per capita
[27:56.480 --> 28:00.280]  has a very low crime rate compared to states like New York or Illinois or
[28:00.280 --> 28:04.680]  California and you can look at those numbers for yourself the unified crime
[28:04.680 --> 28:10.040]  statistics are online even at the Department of Justice but it's just
[28:10.040 --> 28:16.840]  interesting to know in a town where you've got the dingbat liberals who
[28:16.840 --> 28:20.120]  aren't real liberals at all they love torture they love secret arrest they
[28:20.120 --> 28:25.400]  love NDA they love world government they love all these wars as long as it's
[28:25.400 --> 28:29.440]  their guy doing it it's Bill Clinton blowing up Serbia bringing in al-Qaeda
[28:29.440 --> 28:32.840]  to destabilize the country and then attacking saying that Serbia was
[28:32.840 --> 28:39.360]  persecuting people they love it if it's putting al-Qaeda and Libby in Syria to
[28:39.360 --> 28:44.800]  line up the Christians and blacks and blow their heads off they love it I mean
[28:44.800 --> 28:50.320]  if it's corrupt and stinking they like it because it's gang politics where you
[28:50.320 --> 28:54.280]  just hey I'm gonna support my party no matter what they do and if Mitt Romney
[28:54.280 --> 28:57.320]  gets in it'll be the same thing suddenly all these conservatives that are
[28:57.320 --> 29:02.960]  worried about gun control laws and open borders and corruption suddenly when
[29:02.960 --> 29:06.440]  Mitt Romney's doing it they're gonna just sit down and shut up and go well
[29:06.440 --> 29:12.200]  he's our guy and that's what I hate about the two-party system and the left
[29:12.200 --> 29:16.480]  right paradigm because there are differences in the people that support
[29:16.480 --> 29:22.000]  Republicans and the people that support Democrats I generally like
[29:22.000 --> 29:26.720]  Republicans more because they're pro-gun anti-abortion national sovereignty at
[29:26.720 --> 29:34.320]  least on the surface on the surface but when you get down to policy it's it's
[29:34.320 --> 29:37.880]  the same deal because it's it's the globalist it's not the parties the
[29:37.880 --> 29:41.640]  parties are just management teams for slavery incorporated now we come back I
[29:41.640 --> 29:47.320]  have a challenge to Republicans and conservatives but to Democrats alike
[29:47.320 --> 29:54.680]  stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[33:44.080 --> 34:01.680]  the globalist from the planet they engineer the society they decide what
[34:01.680 --> 34:07.400]  backdoor technology to build in your cell phones or dishwashers or dryers or
[34:07.400 --> 34:13.800]  computers your thermostats they decide what to backdoor engineer into the
[34:13.800 --> 34:22.640]  corn and soybeans and wheat and beets and hundreds of other staple vegetables
[34:22.640 --> 34:30.080]  that you eat they decide what to add to your water under the name fluoride they
[34:30.080 --> 34:41.520]  decide what to spray in your skies they decide now 20 plus years ago to violate
[34:41.520 --> 34:49.480]  the Pentagon rule are not allowing troops to use depleted uranium in combat
[34:49.480 --> 34:55.960]  and it's it's depleted uranium and the story of depleted uranium that is a
[34:55.960 --> 35:00.960]  key in my mind to explaining the whole world to people and how it works
[35:00.960 --> 35:10.240]  because within that microcosm you can expand out to the macro and I've got a
[35:10.240 --> 35:17.760]  challenge here and just a moment for everybody but the establishment knows
[35:17.760 --> 35:25.440]  how to condition us they know the tricks that work best they know how to
[35:25.440 --> 35:30.200]  divide and conquer they know how to distract us but if you you know get on
[35:30.200 --> 35:34.640]  the air and talk about just the news that's happening that day it's
[35:34.640 --> 35:39.640]  interesting it's informative but only to a certain level because if there's not
[35:39.640 --> 35:45.880]  the backdrop around it of understanding the philosophy of the people that run
[35:45.880 --> 35:50.920]  this club nothing is ever going to make sense in context and we have no hope of
[35:50.920 --> 36:01.600]  ever changing the disastrous nightmare hellbound course that humanity and the
[36:01.600 --> 36:09.760]  elite themselves are hurtling towards now the story of DU there are army
[36:09.760 --> 36:14.400]  reports from 1947 we've had the guy that literally wrote the book dr. Doug Rocky
[36:14.400 --> 36:19.520]  on about this many times the whole history of DU but by the late 40s they
[36:19.520 --> 36:27.320]  had Lawrence Livermore laboratories and others putting out reports saying we can
[36:27.320 --> 36:32.880]  use DU in munitions it is the incredible battlefield weapon it'll cut
[36:32.880 --> 36:38.600]  through all the armor of the enemy even troops with small arms and it can use it
[36:38.600 --> 36:46.080]  it's the answer in Europe to the Soviets superiority of armor but it ignites in
[36:46.080 --> 36:58.160]  the barrel even if you jacket it in steel and when it leaves the barrel of
[36:58.160 --> 37:03.440]  either a tank or a small arm it it ignites and you get residue that's
[37:03.440 --> 37:08.960]  highly radioactive and poisonous and in lab studies is killing the rats and
[37:08.960 --> 37:13.920]  creating kidney failure lung cancer adrenal failure you name it we cannot
[37:13.920 --> 37:18.840]  use it and you can pull these reports up we've had dr. Rocky on going down you
[37:18.840 --> 37:23.160]  know through now this is how this works and I'll get into the news and the
[37:23.160 --> 37:29.080]  challenge so they they bought masses of this from the spent fuel rods from
[37:29.080 --> 37:34.040]  nuclear reactors and they stockpiled it so there'd be a market for it so that
[37:34.040 --> 37:37.840]  the insiders could make money and control the economy because for them
[37:37.840 --> 37:42.000]  making money is about dominating the economy they use taxes against their
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.440]  competition to shut them down they exempt themselves it's all about
[37:45.440 --> 37:51.360]  consolidation it's all about monopolies but things changed in the ruling class
[37:51.360 --> 37:55.040]  you see first they said we'll just stockpile it in case there's ever a war
[37:55.040 --> 37:59.120]  with the Russians to the globalists were funding at the same time to create the
[37:59.120 --> 38:04.080]  enemy create the crisis so they have a pretext to build up a police state and a
[38:04.080 --> 38:08.960]  surveillance grid and spy satellites and all of this stuff so it can really be
[38:08.960 --> 38:14.920]  used against the people domestically that's why the globalists created a
[38:14.920 --> 38:22.560]  bipolar or multipolar world or the illusion of it show that they could play
[38:22.560 --> 38:26.360]  the two off against each other geopolitically when the final equation
[38:26.360 --> 38:36.040]  they were arms of the same system but but finishing up with a du point because
[38:36.040 --> 38:39.520]  you see normally when I'm covering this the regular news of the day I'm not
[38:39.520 --> 38:43.280]  really even thinking about that news I'm thinking about things like this the
[38:43.280 --> 38:52.800]  big picture and so the ruling class in the 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s who were
[38:52.800 --> 38:57.000]  more than willing to shoot little kids up all over the world with live syphilis
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.880]  or shoot them up with live cancer viruses or shoot them up with you know
[39:03.880 --> 39:08.760]  tuberculosis chemical weapons biological weapons killing our troops
[39:08.760 --> 39:15.360]  horrible testing on prisoners more than happy to do that still there was enough
[39:15.360 --> 39:22.360]  culture in the military that you couldn't get the military scientists and
[39:22.360 --> 39:26.600]  weapons developers to sign off and agree to have the troops that use
[39:26.600 --> 39:31.480]  something like du in general that would debilitate all the troops that came in
[39:31.480 --> 39:36.200]  contact with it it was one thing with a mad scientist who'd been selectively
[39:36.200 --> 39:41.560]  psychologically profiled to say we're gonna take foster children in case
[39:41.560 --> 39:45.200]  America gets attacked by you know in a nuclear war we've got to know what
[39:45.200 --> 39:48.920]  happens with children radiation so we're gonna radiate thousands of them
[39:48.920 --> 39:54.760]  we're gonna kill them the injustice the means the few don't matter the many
[39:54.760 --> 39:58.760]  matter that collectivist idea but that was really just a test they could test
[39:58.760 --> 40:02.280]  it on mammals and know what it would do it was really just a test to build
[40:02.280 --> 40:07.840]  cadres of men that would do whatever they were told including grabbing kids out
[40:07.840 --> 40:12.400]  of schoolyards little kids and doing horrible experiments brain surgeries you
[40:12.400 --> 40:15.800]  name it on them and turning them into Manchurian candidates that was
[40:15.800 --> 40:23.040]  declassified in the 80s tens of thousands of us children were taken many
[40:23.040 --> 40:26.440]  of them it turned out from prominent families because they would want healthy
[40:26.440 --> 40:31.520]  good-looking children and would be turned into completely new people
[40:31.520 --> 40:35.040]  completely programmed dr. Ewing Cameron and others did that and this is all
[40:35.040 --> 40:40.000]  admitted if you want to look it up write these names down so this evil was
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.800]  festering really it was being done by the ruling class because they liked
[40:43.800 --> 40:47.800]  kidnapping little kids really it was being done because they liked
[40:47.800 --> 40:52.520]  trying children and the programs would usually come to an end you know after
[40:52.520 --> 40:57.720]  radiating 4,000 plus children in the US people got upset they said we thought
[40:57.720 --> 41:01.560]  you're only gonna kill so many well you're just killing kids for fun so
[41:01.560 --> 41:06.000]  those programs got shut down so they went overseas to the programs they got
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.240]  Israel to radiate 110,000 of their own kids in the ringworm children's study
[41:10.240 --> 41:15.360]  killing many of them and I've got all this news and I've got my challenge here
[41:15.360 --> 41:19.040]  for you and I know a lot of you don't want to hear this so this is scary stuff
[41:19.040 --> 41:24.200]  know what's scary is knowing this and not doing something about it not
[41:24.200 --> 41:29.800]  realizing hey this government hidden our government and if it takes us where it
[41:29.800 --> 41:33.880]  wants to go it's gonna do everything it's done behind closed doors and an
[41:33.880 --> 41:39.040]  underground bases on a mass scale because I talked about Trinity and beyond
[41:39.040 --> 41:42.760]  yesterday the documentary from the 90s where it showed the nuclear testing
[41:42.760 --> 41:46.360]  history and showed our so-called government trying to ignite the
[41:46.360 --> 41:50.480]  atmosphere with hydrogen bombs and trying to blow holes in the atmosphere
[41:50.480 --> 41:54.880]  and their studies out there showing that that's when the bigger ozone holes
[41:54.880 --> 41:59.240]  actually formed was them detonating our government nobody else did this
[41:59.240 --> 42:05.720]  detonated hundreds of weapons in the atmosphere the upper atmosphere to see
[42:05.720 --> 42:11.800]  if they could destroy the Earth's atmosphere again these are pit demons
[42:11.800 --> 42:16.680]  you know the best movie analogy would be the fifth element where that evil you
[42:16.680 --> 42:20.800]  know asteroids coming in and it's controlling the weapons salesman on
[42:20.800 --> 42:27.840]  earth psychically Zorg whatever his name is Zorg and they're like well what
[42:27.840 --> 42:30.600]  does it want he just wants to kill everybody but what's it gonna do it's
[42:30.600 --> 42:34.120]  gonna it's gonna kill the earth it's gonna get it wants to kill I mean it's
[42:34.120 --> 42:40.160]  basically these people might as well be Zorg or Zorg I mean that's that's
[42:40.160 --> 42:46.280]  art imitating life that's what they're like they get off on it the more evil
[42:46.280 --> 42:52.280]  the blacker the more destructive they're like maws to a satanic flame and
[42:52.280 --> 42:56.320]  we've got to stop them now now I'm sorry I've got my challenge in the news
[42:56.320 --> 43:06.240]  coming up the point is that we're beyond Caligula marrying his horse or Nero
[43:06.240 --> 43:10.040]  dressing up like a werewolf in ancient Rome and in murdering children at
[43:10.040 --> 43:14.680]  public manquets for his own enjoyment I won't go into how he murdered him it's
[43:14.680 --> 43:20.880]  pretty graphic if you go look it up the point is that we're beyond that now
[43:20.880 --> 43:25.360]  crazy people like that have antimatter weapons in the Air Force admitted in the
[43:25.360 --> 43:29.160]  San Francisco Chronicle about 10 years ago that they had antimatter weapons they
[43:29.160 --> 43:33.160]  just wanted to menace everyone with them and then the story got shut down but
[43:33.160 --> 43:37.280]  they do have antimatter weapons they are messing with strangelets black holes
[43:37.280 --> 43:42.360]  they're managed that they are creating these the end of the world is it coming
[43:42.360 --> 43:46.760]  December 21st I'll guarantee you that but it could be the end of the world
[43:46.760 --> 43:49.880]  any time with these crazies
[43:51.560 --> 44:00.320]  now imagine a military which wouldn't let the troops use DU and wouldn't even
[44:00.320 --> 44:10.800]  allow it to be fired from aircraft at enemies until 1990 and they let them use
[44:10.800 --> 44:15.380]  it and first it was in the Vulcan gun and the 810 war dogs and it was in the
[44:15.380 --> 44:19.400]  Bradley fighting vehicles and in the Sabos fired out of the Bradleys and the
[44:19.400 --> 44:25.560]  Abrams a1 Abrams a1 M1 and forget all the technical specifications the
[44:25.560 --> 44:29.240]  point is that then they just made a decision they just had to serve it out
[44:29.240 --> 44:35.680]  and 50 cal every other caliber have the troops move right into bases that have
[44:35.680 --> 44:40.640]  been bombed it shows that mindset where they say oh we'll just deploy it in case
[44:40.640 --> 44:46.240]  the Russians pour into Europe it was deployed by the 50s over in Europe but
[44:46.240 --> 44:50.360]  but just sitting there in an emergency of infantry's overrun then you get this
[44:50.360 --> 44:54.560]  out but by the way you wear a gas mask and you decontaminate yourself and you
[44:54.560 --> 44:58.920]  still may die you understand you're part of units that have volunteered to stay
[44:58.920 --> 45:02.680]  behind here in Germany if the Russians overrun special forces yes we
[45:02.680 --> 45:05.880]  understand this is deadly and it's basically we're going to be you know
[45:05.880 --> 45:12.520]  dying young if we use this we volunteer till 1990 they just say have them all use
[45:12.520 --> 45:18.960]  it so now they've got it it not just proving grounds hundreds of them in the
[45:18.960 --> 45:28.640]  US alone Hawaii places like Puerto Rico I mean I mean they use like a half mile
[45:28.640 --> 45:33.320]  from neighborhoods and people complain and get arrested and stuff this is the
[45:33.320 --> 45:38.360]  madness of these people I mean we have a ruling class that tried to blow up the
[45:38.360 --> 45:43.440]  atmosphere and set the atmosphere on fire and they admit they did I mean and
[45:43.440 --> 45:49.880]  it's on TV and it's it's it's funny and now they're trying to do it they're at
[45:49.880 --> 45:52.600]  the Hadron Collider
[45:56.160 --> 46:01.880]  and you've got all of this going on and they've got the troops using du and then
[46:01.880 --> 46:05.920]  they want me to salute the troops when I see them at a football game or they want
[46:05.920 --> 46:10.520]  me to get it and it's all tyrants that have attached the mantle of what our
[46:10.520 --> 46:14.600]  Republic was and it was never perfect but it was better than others at least
[46:14.600 --> 46:19.440]  the ideals were good what we were striving for was good they've now attached
[46:19.440 --> 46:25.640]  all their evil with this so it's an example of how they use a crisis to
[46:25.640 --> 46:29.240]  deploy something and then of course later start using it and it's the perfect
[46:29.240 --> 46:34.120]  weapon the globalist made the decision because it kills the enemy on both sides
[46:34.120 --> 46:39.320]  it they want to kill you as a veteran and I told you this over a decade ago
[46:39.320 --> 46:42.880]  now it's declassified the whole homeland security system the big armored
[46:42.880 --> 46:47.720]  vehicles the checkpoints the SWAT teams the cert teams the intelligence units
[46:47.720 --> 46:53.800]  they're not watching Al Qaeda in fact they're ordered not to they're watching
[46:53.800 --> 46:57.040]  you because the reason they're not allowed to watch Al Qaeda is because Al
[46:57.040 --> 47:02.960]  Qaeda is CIA MI6 and Mishad and Saudi intelligence it is
[47:02.960 --> 47:07.920]  in triplicate an absolute undisputed fact and so here's my challenge to all of
[47:07.920 --> 47:11.400]  you in the military and to the police and all of you this stuff's out in the
[47:11.400 --> 47:16.240]  open that's how God works this stuff's all out in the open people like me are
[47:16.240 --> 47:20.840]  here so you get to hear what's really going on I lay out the facts you get to
[47:20.840 --> 47:27.720]  make decisions and decide like Nineveh whether you're gonna repent or not and
[47:27.720 --> 47:30.280]  and by repenting that didn't mean just going to the church and giving a little
[47:30.280 --> 47:34.960]  glitter bug some money that doesn't mean you know going on these 501 C3s and
[47:34.960 --> 47:39.200]  hearing how you worship the corrupt government no no repenting means asking
[47:39.200 --> 47:43.960]  God if you don't believe in God whatever meditating on it saying hey I know we're
[47:43.960 --> 47:50.760]  in trouble as a culture God please guide me and what I should do to resist this
[47:50.760 --> 47:56.200]  and if you won't do that then you've made a decision because all of you know
[47:56.200 --> 48:00.040]  deep down we're in trouble you know evil's taken over and it's really getting
[48:00.040 --> 48:04.240]  ready to run wild see everybody thinks stuff's crazy right now this is only the
[48:04.240 --> 48:10.480]  preparation this is like an army lining up on our border or a SWAT team stacking
[48:10.480 --> 48:14.800]  up outside your house everything you've seen is just the enemy stacking up
[48:14.800 --> 48:26.960]  about to come in and and when the hammer drops and the crises expand it's going to
[48:26.960 --> 48:33.840]  be harder to shape the battlefield we need to shape the spectrum of debate
[48:33.840 --> 48:39.840]  now and inject as much truth as we can like the world is about to go into a
[48:39.840 --> 48:43.880]  crisis and we're not going to be able to communicate as easy we need to inject
[48:43.880 --> 48:52.920]  truth 24 7 right now so here's my challenge I want you to look up the
[48:52.920 --> 48:57.600]  call letters I want you to look up to your local affiliates TV radio print I
[48:57.600 --> 49:02.360]  want you to go to info wars calm but it's all over London Telegraph LA times
[49:02.360 --> 49:08.720]  BBC Associated Press New York Times and I want you to go down and see the
[49:08.720 --> 49:13.280]  program directors of the TV and radio or if you know them at your church or
[49:13.280 --> 49:18.920]  your gym or wherever and I want you to tell them listen our whole society's
[49:18.920 --> 49:23.080]  being overthrown our liberties are being taken the TSA is abusing our
[49:23.080 --> 49:29.760]  children because we're told Al Qaeda is going to attack us while it's in the
[49:29.760 --> 49:36.600]  news that Al Qaeda is being funded and trained by the CIA and MI6 and it's
[49:36.600 --> 49:41.800]  admitted that they started the Civil War and started the attack and it is a
[49:41.800 --> 49:45.200]  war crime what's happening they're taking families and say we're going to kill
[49:45.200 --> 49:48.520]  your kids if you don't drive this truck full of explosives into that police
[49:48.520 --> 49:55.520]  station I mean as folks this evil's gone on for a while but the fact that it can
[49:55.520 --> 50:03.400]  be out in the open the fact that this is going on the challenge is it's time to
[50:03.400 --> 50:07.000]  recognize this for what it is I mean I've got the articles right here now
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.520]  where it's totally admitted that the whole thing in Syria and Libya was
[50:11.520 --> 50:17.280]  started by our criminal government and NATO and they plan to do it all over the
[50:17.280 --> 50:22.640]  Middle East to put jihadis in and let Saudi Arabia take over the entire
[50:22.640 --> 50:29.640]  Middle East and it's just too rich it's too much for me to see TSA on the
[50:29.640 --> 50:34.520]  streets and regular army and giant black homeland security vehicles driving
[50:34.520 --> 50:41.560]  around and paramilitary police bugging their eyes out at you if you photo or
[50:41.560 --> 50:45.400]  videotape them acting like you're a terrorist in this whole dress-up play
[50:45.400 --> 50:50.120]  along thing which is really a martial law takeover system to start purges
[50:50.120 --> 50:53.720]  against the American people and they said it was for al-qaeda when their own
[50:53.720 --> 50:58.760]  documents say it's for us our government is in our government it runs al-qaeda it
[50:58.760 --> 51:03.720]  runs everything the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months
[51:03.720 --> 51:08.600]  of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is
[51:08.600 --> 51:12.880]  in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat
[51:12.880 --> 51:17.360]  are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers
[51:17.360 --> 51:21.040]  and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[51:21.040 --> 51:25.160]  counter this is to freeze your food cost in today's prices by getting your own
[51:25.160 --> 51:29.680]  supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases
[51:29.680 --> 51:33.320]  e-foods will have to raise prices to now is the time to get your supply I
[51:33.320 --> 51:36.800]  recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this
[51:36.800 --> 51:40.600]  was coming you know about their delicious long-term storeable foods the fact
[51:40.600 --> 51:44.360]  is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it stores for 25
[51:44.360 --> 51:47.840]  years they're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost don't

[54:04.000 --> 54:08.480]  Jones on the GCN radio network
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.720]  to quantify my challenge it's really this wake up to the fact that our
[54:20.720 --> 54:25.800]  government is not our government it is illegitimate and it is beyond criminal
[54:25.800 --> 54:30.960]  and it's becoming more criminal by the day and it's a lot bigger than Barack
[54:30.960 --> 54:39.520]  Obama we sent the guys out last night to do a review of the new 2016 Obama 2016
[54:39.520 --> 54:44.760]  and it's basically a neocon film and whereas I'm not a fan of Obama it
[54:44.760 --> 54:52.800]  basically says he's a secret Muslim who wants to hand everything over to Al-Qaeda
[54:52.800 --> 54:59.280]  in a way that's true but not in the way they're saying Al-Qaeda is publicly run
[54:59.280 --> 55:03.240]  by the banksters that use it everywhere to take over in these stabilized
[55:03.240 --> 55:07.760]  countries want to fight the Russians use them want to go out the Serbs use them
[55:07.760 --> 55:11.360]  want to take down Qaddafi use them want to take down these countries use them
[55:11.360 --> 55:16.080]  and then they get on the news and act all moral a shot out of the blue has the
[55:16.080 --> 55:21.680]  military shooting demonstrators it was on the news overseas they were blowing up
[55:21.680 --> 55:26.480]  government buildings our media called them peaceful protesters they had
[55:26.480 --> 55:31.680]  aircraft and tanks in Libya the first few months and they were calling them
[55:31.680 --> 55:36.520]  peaceful protesters that's how dumb they think you are and it's incredibly
[55:36.520 --> 55:41.960]  immoral just like it's immoral to have the troops on television BBC Fox News
[55:41.960 --> 55:45.320]  you name it when the troops started talking going hey we grow the opium we
[55:45.320 --> 55:50.080]  and so because it was kept secret and they were talking it was like ooh wow
[55:50.080 --> 55:53.680]  the troops say they're going opium well that's illegal but by just coming out
[55:53.680 --> 55:56.960]  you got to hand it to them they're slick and going yeah we grow the opium
[55:56.960 --> 56:00.920]  that's how we fight Al-Qaeda and if we catch you with it you're going to jail
[56:00.920 --> 56:05.400]  but we're going to ship it into America it's like okay we grow the opium but
[56:05.400 --> 56:11.400]  you'll go to jail if you use it so that's what I mean they're just yeah the
[56:11.400 --> 56:15.200]  DU kills our troops big deal yeah we're taking their pension funds and death
[56:15.200 --> 56:26.480]  benefits when they die big deal yeah we're running Al-Qaeda big deal it's just
[56:26.480 --> 56:30.880]  big deal well my challenge is it is a big deal because if they can get away
[56:30.880 --> 56:33.760]  with saying tortures good and torture of children is good in front of their
[56:33.760 --> 56:38.680]  parents and secret arrest is good and the NSA spying on us without warrants is
[56:38.680 --> 56:44.240]  good and forcibly inoculating children all over the country is good without
[56:44.240 --> 56:48.960]  parental consent no man this is a criminal government assaulting us and
[56:48.960 --> 56:54.000]  the challenge is start with something like Al-Qaeda I mean here are some of
[56:54.000 --> 56:59.720]  the articles today New York Times scrubs a mention of CIA arming Syrian rebels
[56:59.720 --> 57:04.480]  who they go on to admit are dominated by Al-Qaeda and who are blowing up
[57:04.480 --> 57:11.000]  churches and then people go well you know we got to get the Arabs killing each
[57:11.000 --> 57:17.240]  other we nothing we're not running any of this stop playing like you're a CIA
[57:17.240 --> 57:21.680]  black op commander and even if you are a CIA black op commander you're drinking
[57:21.680 --> 57:26.120]  fluoride you're taking vaccines you have no future you're playing to be removed
[57:26.120 --> 57:34.680]  any of you that serve this evil system you are idiots just because you can
[57:34.680 --> 57:39.520]  grasp the injustice the means in some Machiavellian way does it mean you're a
[57:39.520 --> 57:43.440]  rocket scientist it means you're a fool and I like it again to the ring of
[57:43.440 --> 57:50.160]  Mordor you cannot use evil for good you cannot do it it will always revert to
[57:50.160 --> 57:54.720]  evil you may get some big results up front but you will get far more evil out
[57:54.720 --> 58:04.040]  of it and it goes on to break down it's all over the British foreign press it's
[58:04.040 --> 58:07.760]  admitted there's US troops on the ground they've been shipping weapons in out of
[58:07.760 --> 58:13.600]  Turkey out of Jordan to shoot down aircraft blow things up this has been
[58:13.600 --> 58:18.200]  going on for eight months and our media is like that dirty Assad he and they're
[58:18.200 --> 58:21.960]  gonna put al-Qaeda in to kill the Christians and they think you're so
[58:21.960 --> 58:24.360]  stupid when they're killing the Christians if they take over in a year or
[58:24.360 --> 58:28.800]  so he'll be on the news that dirty al-Qaeda is killing Christians in Syria

[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:40.200]  public here print 2.0 the answer to the internet kill switch if you're picking up
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.760]  this publication for the first time and wondering what we're all about the
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.240]  answer is freedom you stand behind the Constitution the Bill of Rights and the
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:54.320]  concept of 1776 expanding worldwide the idea of liberty all over the planet we
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:02:00.400]  are a firewall standing between liberty and the tyranny of corporate system
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:05.280]  monopolist system that is diabolically opposed to freedom and the free market
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.800]  especially when it comes to media and unrestricted flow of information we
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:14.680]  oppose wireless NSA wiretapping and the secret arrest of Americans under the
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:22.760]  NDAA we oppose endless wars criminal proxy wars carried out in our names we
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:27.840]  oppose the persecution of people for religious or cultural reasons we are
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.520]  not left or right we are constitutionalist because Obama is currently the
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:37.920]  titular head of the global empire and the adjoining crime syndicate a lot of
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.480]  this publication will be about his actions in the past we were critical of
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:46.460]  Bush we will also examine Romney and others who may replace Obama and his
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:51.120]  administration as the new front puppets info wars.com and prison planet.com or
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.640]  flagship websites are rated by alexa.com similar metrics that gauge web
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:00.880]  traffic as the top alternative sites in the world info wars receives around four
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:06.960]  times that's a typo it says twice the traffic of MSNBC.com news via print is
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.240]  dying as a result of a perfect storm people are abandoning corporate
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:15.920]  newspapers and print publications and instead are flocking to the web as so
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.480]  called mainstream newspapers to just regurgitate corporate and government
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:24.880]  talking points mainstream news is also dying online this is why we are able to
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.000]  dominate them with film videos and our news websites and now hopefully this
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.280]  publication that is happening print is impervious to a great extent the
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.920]  government kill switch and any other electronic scheme designed to shut down
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:41.560]  areas of the web the government wants censored digital and network technology
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:46.120]  make it easy for corporate control freaks to track down dissonance delete
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:50.800]  their words and even kill audio files of their voices as they have done with my
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.080]  voice on YouTube in the past corporations have gone so far as to
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:59.680]  claim copyright on voices including that of Optimus Prime a character from the
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:03.520]  Transformers franchise to be specific that when the guy that does his voice
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.760]  does interviews they block that now saying you know the computer recognizes
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:11.360]  it that's right YouTube is now adhering to third-party claims of ownership many
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:15.280]  of them erroneous to people's own voices and using this as a pretext delete

[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:01.880]  one level it doesn't disturb me but I do the same thing myself sometimes I get
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:05.480]  news that's coming in on the internet and I'm sitting here in front of my
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:11.160]  computer and I tell you I get so angry I can hardly see straight it infuriates me
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.440]  it's I was talking a friend of mine the other day and I said it's like walking
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:19.200]  into a topless bar and finding your daughter dancing on the stage I don't
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.800]  want to be here I don't want to see what's going on something I love the
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.960]  United States of America is being destroyed right in front of my eyes and
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:33.320]  I'll tell you something it infuriates it drives me yeah you know you hear other
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:38.840]  people it's like driving you know if I'm driving and the traffic gets in my way
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:42.120]  I lose my temper somebody else's driving doesn't bother me a bit today you're
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:46.440]  driving it doesn't bother me the same way it does the stuff I'm reading up
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:51.120]  myself and I say God and I think may perhaps you understand maybe that makes
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:55.920]  some sense no it totally makes sense and and to watch the zombies laugh at us
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:00.400]  that are informed that can quote legal documents that can quote history that
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:06.600]  are informed people think being ignorant is like a mantle of power and
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:12.000]  instead everything's going to Hades in a handbasket yeah I understand and the
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.200]  way out is you have to learn some fundamentals and if you can learn them
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:19.800]  it's almost astonishing I'm sure you appreciate this we are dealing with
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:23.480]  forces that are they didn't just start up in the last five years or ten years or

[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:32.360]  all right Alfred Adas is our guest and he's done a lot of research into the
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:36.360]  globalist and the weird legalese they have why they have to tell you what
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:40.880]  they're gonna do to you first why they follow all these strange little little
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:44.680]  rules that they believe are spiritual it's like skull and bones of Bohemian
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:48.600]  Grove and we now know what type of rituals they do because I infiltrated
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:52.720]  and others have infiltrated skull and bones they take it very seriously
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:25:01.720]  basically like the old story of Faust and metastopheles how do you trick the
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:06.640]  devil and again you may not believe in the devil these people do and they
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.640]  believe they're doing all these bad things but they've got to somehow get
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:14.480]  around that so we're gonna break it down let's let's get into your first point
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:17.800]  you want to cover genocide committed by the US government against the American
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:21.920]  people well let's start there we've talked on the program before I was sued
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:25.200]  for twenty five thousand dollars a day that's nine million a year for
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:29.240]  manufacturing distribution of a controlled substance as fiduciary for a
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:33.600]  trust at least a couple of tables chairs and some computers to a company that
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:37.080]  manufactured colloidal silver and they brought me in as a defendant this is
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:41.320]  attorney general Texas and the key to it was whether or not colloidal silver was
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:47.080]  a drug and they defined drugs in the Texas health and safety code 431.002
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:54.120]  subsection 14 and also the federal code at 21 USCA 321 G1 and both of the
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:26:00.240]  definitions of drugs use the phrase man or other animals and they use that phrase
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:06.160]  twice they don't say man or animals they say man or other animals and that
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:11.400]  means they deem man to be an animal in the same sense if I said horses or other
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:15.080]  animals makes perfect sense and this isn't some new humanist thing they've
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:19.000]  been saying this for thousands of years they see themselves as men we're
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.760]  animals Frank Herbert's letting people know he's aware of that where they're
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:27.320]  gonna kill the young Duke of Trades if he's an animal and has fear and can be
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:31.880]  controlled but they don't killing because he shows he's human yeah and it goes
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:36.800]  all the way back to Genesis 126 through 28 where it says on the sixth day God
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:42.160]  created man in his image and gave man dominion over the animals under
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:47.880]  Genesis 126 through 28 I can't be an animal and they can't pass a law that
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:51.800]  declares me to be an animal without violating my freedom of religion and
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:55.400]  that was the essence of my defense in this case the attorney general had
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:59.720]  invested half a million dollars and six years in prosecuting this case there
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:03.120]  were six defendants ahead of me and three of them hired attorneys paid a
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.280]  hundred and sixty thousand dollars one of the best law firms in Texas got
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.200]  nowhere I put a religious freedom defense together and they dropped the
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:14.400]  case they don't want to tangle with the idea that the people are deemed by
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:18.120]  government to be animals and the reason this is significant they want you to
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:22.040]  opt in with all the liberals and say we don't have free will and we're an animal
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:27.480]  because then they go that's right now you're dead we have dominion legally and
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:31.520]  it goes to the Declaration of Independence and fundamental principles
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.520]  this country is based on we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:38.880]  are endowed by that are created equal and endowed by their creator with
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:46.400]  certain unalienable rights when they said that they meant no animals no animals
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:50.120]  are endowed with unalienable rights and the third sentence of the Declaration of
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:54.200]  Independence is that to secure these rights governments are instituted among
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.440]  men they're telling us the purpose of government as envisioned by the founding
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:02.840]  fathers was to secure to every man woman and even unborn child their God
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:07.480]  given unalienable rights these rights flow from God but they don't flow to
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:12.520]  animals they only flow to those of us who are made in God's image and when they
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:16.960]  pass laws they say no you're just other animal you're just another animal when
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:21.320]  they do that they deprive us of the fundamental God given unalienable rights
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:24.600]  that we find their Declaration of Independence this was the foundation for
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:29.080]  this country it was unprecedented and this they are stripping us of that
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:33.000]  spiritual foundation on which this country was built and you know what
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.920]  happened you were the judge was probably a high-level mason you brought in one of
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:43.000]  their seek secret high-level religious rights and said I am not an animal I
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.800]  declare that I'm allowed to do you know what I want I have freedom now you
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:52.840]  legally were again back under that basic covenant and if people don't believe in
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:57.560]  this the globalist believe in it they follow it and that's why then they now
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:00.880]  want to make us lower than animals with the animal rights people that are
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:04.480]  funded by the transhumanist and the globalist not that I'm against animals
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:08.160]  but the point is is that now they want to make it where the elite speak for the
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.160]  animals and say that they have more rights than humans and make us lower
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:16.600]  than animals I understand we've had people contact me we do our little
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:20.320]  program a little radio program it goes out over shortwave we have some people
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:23.640]  listening in foreign countries I've been contacted by one guy in England and
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:28.000]  another one in Australia New Zealand I don't remember one of them and they
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.920]  they check the laws in their country the definition of drugs and they found out
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:36.520]  those laws for England and either Australia New Zealand probably both
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:41.240]  of them no it's all the same pardon me it's all the same yeah they also presume
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:45.920]  the people to be animals this has to be a fundamental cornerstone for the New
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:49.760]  World Order we are going to be we've heard people say it for years stay there

[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:48.840]  released biological agent in 1968 in the New York subway death resulted details
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:52.880]  remain classified they put army doctors in the hospitals to see what it would do
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:57.960]  it was reportedly a bacteria this just came out at info wars.com and prison

[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:08.800]  assures public safety despite government history of dangerous biological
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:13.360]  testing on the American public that's at info wars.com and prison planet.com

[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:47.120]  says will test sensors designed to detect biological agents that could be
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:51.040]  released as part of a terrorist attack who knows what they're really gonna be
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:54.760]  releasing there I mean with their pension for putting cancer viruses in the

[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:02.400]  of course you don't let the slaves know that and the DHS has not been very
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:07.720]  forthcoming with information saying only that it is a non-infectious material
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:14.520]  that has been approved as a food supplement probably yeast the Boston

[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:31.200]  all part of this new fear of alarms going off but now they've turned off a
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:35.760]  lot of the country the radiation alarms when reactors leak now they just don't
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:39.840]  even turn the alarms on so it didn't scare people in places like San Diego and
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:42.560]  they just say oh we're gonna raise the radiation levels hundreds of percentage
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:46.200]  points just say it's good for you yeah let your hair fall out the seals are
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:51.080]  dying you know in on the West Coast but hey you know what they got a radiation
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:56.040]  you know what Diane's fine okay well we're gonna keep you safe from milk
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:01.360]  tie to who they publicly run there's a special invitation from Peter Thiel the
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:04.240]  Bilderberg group member trying to take a libertarian movement an event to be
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:10.120]  held the following date and location for the for the Ron Paul campaign we're
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:15.720]  gonna be talking about that boy that's that's interesting going back to Alfred
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:19.600]  a desk Alfred a lot of breaking news while you're here today but let's get
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:24.760]  into this now you were talking about how worldwide and I've looked it up in the
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:30.760]  Codex Alimentarius and all this it says it says humans and other animals now
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:34.720]  this is not just a theorem the Illuminati is obsessed with this the
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:41.120]  illuminated ones at degrees above 33rd degree most nations don't even know
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:45.600]  there's above a 33rd and I'm not saying this is even a Masonic conspiracy
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:49.400]  that's only one branch of this and a thing they use to like gather people who
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:53.560]  they think are well-meaning to control the good guys around them the evil once
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:56.720]  we protected by a bodyguard of good it's very sophisticated so they've got all
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:59.720]  these well-meaning men like George Washington you name it he found out
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.600]  about it wrote letters about it so they killed him folks just Google George
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:05.400]  Washington's letters on the Illuminati it's incredible that's the Library of
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:09.480]  Congress you can read it signed by him as he was battling them but the point is
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:15.160]  is that yeah he said that the Illuminati was taking over the Masons they
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.200]  yeah that yeah they took him over it's kind of like when Winston Smith pops in
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:22.880]  the door and and there's O'Brien to torture him he says O'Brien they got
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:26.480]  you too he goes yo they got me a long time ago but I'm ranting the point is
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:33.440]  is that it's all about how we are the animals or the profane we are seen as
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:40.040]  cattle and this even goes back into the Old Testament you know other tribes and
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:44.280]  groups that didn't follow what the Israelites were into were the Goyim so
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:49.760]  Goyim cattle chattel that's why the Constitution and Bill of Rights and as
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.200]  you know it's an it it is a title to those that were free if you understood
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:59.120]  the riddle they said you know free men no free man will be barred the use of
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:03.020]  arms or property well they set the precedent as you know at the end of the
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:07.100]  Civil War making us all slaves they didn't just say blacks weren't human or
[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:11.360]  two-thirds human so what you've hit isn't just your theory it is the essence
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:17.520]  of the truth of what we're facing and so they're dumbing us down poisoning us
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:21.760]  trying to deny us good education so they can fool us into thinking we're
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:25.840]  animals and that we're bad and need to be exterminated because humans are
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:31.080]  trash they do not want us to realize that we are not profane unless we drink
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:35.640]  from the fetid cup of the Illuminati the truth is to say you're illuminated
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:40.000]  they've stolen all the terms when you love Christ and God and want to do one
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.400]  to others and want to build people up that's when you're illuminated by the
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:46.840]  spirit of Christ but they call illuminated but they're not illuminated
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:51.440]  they're eliminated by the black sunshine by the dirty black summer by the devil
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:55.560]  under the black wings of death I'm ranting here but the whole point is look
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:59.680]  at how they said blacks weren't human so we're allowed to enslave them this is
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:06.080]  as old as the hills yep same thing with the the Nazis declared the Jews to be
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:08.760]  under mentioned before they marched them off into camps
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:14.160]  under mentioned means under man it means subhuman it means animals as soon as
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:17.840]  you're declared to be an animal then you can do anything you can be treated
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:22.120]  like livestock the farmer can butcher the cows and the pigs and the horses and
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:26.200]  sheep why because they're animals they're not made in God's image again you can
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:31.320]  look at Genesis 9 6 and it tells you why you can't murder a man and it
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:36.440]  expressly tells you because he's made in God's image that's why you can't do it
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:40.720]  if you will accept the status of an animal then there's what's to prevent
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.520]  you from being murdered or killed and that's why they have you swear an oath
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:48.280]  when you join the military and tell you're in it you that you're an animal
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:53.040]  and your garbage and crud so that you will accept it and sign the contract with
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:58.120]  the devil so they can kill you not just that I see this as spiritual war for and
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:02.360]  it took me a long time I didn't get to that until I was in my 50s before I
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:07.040]  even began to suspect it I see it now with what seems to be clarity the
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.920]  spiritual warfare is this they're not worried about your life they're not
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:13.400]  worried about your property or whatever gold you got or your land that's
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:18.360]  irrelevant to them they want your soul and you're not going to hell unless you
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:24.520]  consent they posted in the books if you can read it's there we deem you to be
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:30.920]  animals did you consent to be an animal they need your consent Satan can't come
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:35.520]  up with a pitchfork poke in the butt and make it go to hell it doesn't work
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:40.800]  that way you need to consent and that's why they had in my opinion that they
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:45.880]  have to put this out in law where if you're smart enough and you're diligent
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:49.160]  you can find it no it's illegal posting that's why they tell you before they
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:54.040]  stage a terror attack on television yeah they need your consent you need to
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:58.520]  consent say yeah I'm an animal sure I can send to that great you're headed for
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:02.720]  hell I think that's what's going on the Bible said before each culture fell
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:06.760]  everyone began marking themselves and hurting themselves I'm not saying
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:10.320]  somebody's bad if every person wants tattoos or whatever and piercings all
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:15.120]  over them the point is in every culture from the Aztecs to the Israelites when
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:21.400]  they went bad that's what begins this is all the signs yeah I understand I've
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:25.460]  got an article here from genocide watch you can find them at genocide watch
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:31.120]  org it was submitted to the Department of State back in 1996 and they'd
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:36.320]  identify eight stages of genocide and the third stage is dehumanization and
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:39.840]  the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:43.840]  of genocide and they go through and genocide is a crime under international
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:50.320]  law but need not include actual death the only thing that's required is that if
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:55.080]  you commit acts that with the intent to destroy and whole or in part national
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:59.400]  ethnic racial or religious groups such as causing serious bodily injury or
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:03.760]  mental harm to members the group or see deliberately inflicting on the group
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:07.160]  conditions of life calculated bring about its physical destruction and
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:11.240]  whole or in part that's what they're doing when they reduce you to animals
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:16.240]  this is an act of genocide perpetrated against the American people they are
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:20.200]  creating conditions where they define you and me and all of our children
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:23.160]  everybody ever loved and liked or admired they're all being defined as
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:27.840]  animals they are using that the same way the Nazis used it to march people off to
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:31.360]  and off and that's why all the environmentalists teach the kids you're
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.520]  scum you're bad you're hurting the earth so you will actually hate yourself and
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:40.560]  not realize your incredible destiny that's exactly right will you consent to
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:44.040]  be an animal and they teach us to do that it goes right to the theory of
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:48.800]  evolution theory of evolution versus creation is creation is they are that
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:53.640]  silly that's my course it turns out Darwin was a super luciferian occultist had
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:58.600]  these visions while while having a fever was into the occult believed that we
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:04.440]  were seated by aliens what's that term trans panspermia I mean this was a
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:10.200]  devil cult that came up with this to get us to consent to be their slaves to get
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:14.000]  us to opt in to think it's cool to say we don't have free will it is the
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.960]  ultimate joke they don't want you being spiritual folks because they are
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:24.800]  totally spiritual they traffic in men's souls as revelation says yeah I agree
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:29.960]  with that 100% I don't know it's it this is spiritual warfare and that's a very
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:33.480]  difficult concept to understand again I didn't even begin to suspect until I
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:37.680]  was in my 50s you find this late in life I wish I'd have known when I was 25 or
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:41.720]  30 years old it would have made an enormous difference in my life but I
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:45.120]  and I appreciate that if people hear this they saw a spiritual war for the
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:50.160]  guys crazy well maybe but I don't think so you look at this long enough you
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:54.600]  begin to see and you say oh my god and it's when you do see it's spiritual
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:44:01.040]  warfare it's encouraging it's empowering you begin to realize my god the Bible is
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:05.320]  real God is real these people really they believe in God more than most
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:10.320]  Christians the spiritual warfare is evidence that there's another life after
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:15.600]  this one it's not frightening it removes you from fear when you begin to see
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:20.280]  I'm fighting these guys but they're going nowhere next life they're angry they
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:25.240]  are angry next time they're screwed well I mean they take on the spirit of the
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:30.000]  god of this world they hate life they hate humanity well the devil hates
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.200]  God's creation and that's why these people burn with hate in our healthy
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:37.640]  families they burn with hate and everything that's why they poison our
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:43.640]  food in our water they love hurting God's creation and we are God's greatest
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:48.560]  creation now continuing here breaking this down I want to get into the other
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:51.560]  points we've covered this with you you know every time you've been on probably
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.120]  ten times the point you just made but you know that was very eloquently said
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:57.640]  let's move quickly now the organic law the United States significance of the
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:01.000]  national debt why the Bible says you can't kill a man already mentioned that
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.200]  world's first economists that's a great breakdown you engage in and if you
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:08.000]  really know what you're reading there yeah it makes perfect sense you know the
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.040]  seven good years seven bad the purpose of the Second Amendment the foundation
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:18.120]  for liberty and sovereignty hit it well sovereignty is the big deal sovereignty
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:22.520]  is the key and we hear if you follow I'm sure you've seen this where the FBI and
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:26.320]  people in government are concerned about the sovereignty movement oh my gosh the
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:31.200]  sovereigns are coming to get us this country was based on the idea that every
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:36.160]  man was a sovereign this is expressed in in this by the Supreme Court in the case
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:42.520]  of Chisholm versus Georgia year of our Lord 1793 that's only 15 18 years after
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:46.560]  the Declaration of Independence yeah about about 18 years if you're not
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:51.080]  sovereign then the king or the bureaucrat is God that's what it comes down to the
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:55.200]  question about sovereignty is who's the boss and if I'm a son that's why the
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:00.540]  Bible is so powerful the Old Testament it's not saying some king is is is is
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:06.080]  God it's saying God and then man it is you're in charge God in the American
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:09.960]  law form God is number one we the people as individuals are number two and
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:13.480]  government is number three in this hierarchy of authority government is
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:18.280]  intended to be our public servant because we are sovereigns compared to the
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:22.160]  English law form that existed at the time of the American Revolution God was
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:26.760]  number one King of England was number two government was number three served the
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.600]  king and the people were number four down at the bottom of the pecking order and
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:34.440]  the reason they were number four is because only the king of England
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:40.120]  received his rights directly from God all else were subjects because they did
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:44.880]  not receive their rights directly from God the government fears the sovereignty
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.720]  movement because if people ever understand the the spiritual foundation
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:52.680]  on which this country was built they're gonna have an argument that's gonna be
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:57.240]  almost irresistible it's a contract I mean in all cultures the devil deals and
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:02.000]  contracts well so does God we have a contract from God that we can execute
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:07.640]  yeah and we have turned our back much the same as Esau he turned his back on
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:11.240]  his birthright back in the Bible he sold his birthright for bull a
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:15.800]  potage and God later in the Bible he says twice he says Jacob I have loved
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:19.920]  but Esau I have hated and he doesn't explain in the Bible why he hates Esau
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:23.560]  but I believe it's because Esau turned his back on the birthright when he
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:28.120]  despised the birthright which ultimately emanated from God he expressed his
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:31.760]  contempt for God he didn't know what he was doing he was just a dumb and see
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:36.360]  let me let me raise this because it's such a great discussion I don't fear
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:42.400]  physical death I fear my bloodline and my family being good people dying I fear
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:47.680]  that my that I would have evil children I fear that that birthright would be
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:51.800]  would be desecrated I mean that's a spiritual understanding I have that no
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:55.320]  one even taught me but I feel the birthright stretching back into
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:59.760]  antiquity and I feel it stretching forward well it's the same thing with
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:03.000]  the unalienable rights that were declared in our Declaration of Independence
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:08.480]  that is unprecedented in Western history it's the first time any country at
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:11.920]  least since the time of judges in the Old Testament stood up and said no all
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:16.120]  men get their rights from God and by virtue of all of us getting our rights
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:20.320]  from God we are all elevated the status of sovereigns we are relieved from being
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:24.280]  subjects and we become sovereigns above government where other than subjects
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:28.880]  under government and that's what the battle is all about if you people can
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:33.840]  catch the idea of your sovereignty and understand it's a spiritual concept and
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:37.200]  understand that if you you can support this with the First Amendment for
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:40.800]  example you write a freedom of religion or article one section six of the
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:43.920]  Constitution the state of Texas or whatever state you're in there's a
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:48.320]  guarantee of freedom of religion you have access to these God-given
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:51.400]  unalienable rights you can also claim them under the Ninth Amendment which
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:54.600]  guarantees the rights that are not declared in the in the Constitution
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:58.320]  there's still if people still retain those rights declared right there in the
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:02.120]  Declaration of Independence those God-given unalienable rights they're
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:05.560]  right there if you know how that's right courts can't take them get up
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:09.840]  courts can say that black people aren't human but if folks stand up and say I am
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:13.880]  a human they are I mean so much of this is a bluff that's why they're so
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:19.120]  scared of it and again it has to be this way because they're fighting for in my
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:21.880]  opinion because they're fighting for our souls they don't care about your money
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:25.360]  they don't care about your house they want your soul you must consent that
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:31.440]  means you have a choice all right you can say yes you can say no choose this
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:35.120]  day who you will serve God or mammon where you going with this your choice
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:39.240]  you take responsibility for the choice and they're saying just because your
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:45.200]  ignorant is no excuse ignorance is no excuse the eyes the law might be eyes it
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:49.440]  might be an excuse in the eyes of the Christian faith but again ignorance
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:53.480]  certainly under the Old Testament didn't excuse anything well Christ did not come
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:58.320]  to abolish the law but to fulfill it I know it's it's it's it's it's you know
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:03.400]  it's a gray area or murky or whatever but nevertheless they need your consent
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:09.000]  they're not just gonna force you in you have to consent and if you have brains
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.760]  enough and you have sufficient courage and perhaps sufficient blessing you can
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:17.800]  you can make these arguments and perhaps they'll succeed in my case they did in
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:21.440]  one instance it doesn't mean that would I could try it again up my that's why we
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:24.680]  shouldn't just roll around like victims and say the whole world's corrupt there's
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:29.600]  nothing we can do yeah if we give up and let evil occupy everything but good has
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:33.600]  the real power that's why they want to keep us clamped down and tell us we have
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:39.280]  no power all day because truth and liberty and freedom is infectious and
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:44.480]  people desire it and and and once people get a taste of it it's what fulfills
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:49.600]  and once we start acting like sovereigns and have that confidence then we build
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:55.480]  up humans and humans then become stronger instead of this nanny state that
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:51:00.240]  seeks to make us nothing more than domesticated animals we'll be right back

[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:32.280]  information because we're not just here agreeing with each other we're
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:35.780]  affirming that yes that is what we discovered that is what we found but
[01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:40.240]  it's everywhere in culture it's in every culture this is the Illuminati secret
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:44.360]  they're saying they're humans we're animals well let me give you a newsflash
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:50.840]  I'm not an animal and they're trying to turn us into dumb down animals just so they can live this dream
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:56.760]  These are horrible people. I'm gonna break that down after Alfred leaves us and hit a bunch of the other news
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:01.080]  But they're setting the precedent to poison our food or water to do unspeakable things
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:05.560]  Tell the story quickly because it's so important of the world's first economist
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:11.120]  Joseph in Genesis. This is important. Yeah, Joseph. This is this is amazing thing
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:16.720]  I saw this probably about 10 years ago for the first time. I'm reading Genesis and I read chapter 47
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:21.920]  And you folks can go look chapter 47 in Genesis and it describes the story of Joseph
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:24.800]  He heard the Pharaoh had had a couple of dreams
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:28.760]  No one could interpret him Joseph interpreted the Pharaoh's dreams
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:32.840]  The Pharaoh was at seven great years followed by seven bad years
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:38.800]  He understood that's what the dreams meant and the Pharaoh was so impressed. He appointed Joseph to be his number two guy in Egypt
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:42.080]  The seven years came along and Joseph stored up grain
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:46.400]  We all hear in that story stored up brain and then he'd have grain to give the people during the seven bad years
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:50.920]  And that's the way the story was told me in Bible school. I remember it back when I was a little kid
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:52.920]  Oh, Joseph. He was such a great guy
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:59.800]  You read chapter 47 of Genesis and it tells you in the first year after they started the the
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:06.800]  The shortage of food I can't eat famine as soon as they started the famine first year the people came and they said why should we die?
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:11.240]  You got grain why should we die and Joseph said I will give you grain for a new year
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:16.280]  Provided you give me all of your money and the people did they gave him all of their money
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:20.840]  And then Joseph took all of the money and he put it into the Pharaoh's storehouse
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:22.520]  He didn't leave it in circulation
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:28.600]  He crippled the economy where the people were not able to work their way through the famine by
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:35.140]  Removing the money. This is interesting because they took the gold out of circulation in this country in 33 and the silver in
[01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:38.660]  1968 they removed our money too. It's an interesting coincidence
[01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:43.500]  Second year people come back in the famine and they say we're out of grain. We don't have anything to eat
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:46.140]  Why should we die and Joseph says I will give you grain
[01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:49.300]  But you got to give me all of your cattle and the people say okay
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:52.300]  We'll give you all of our cattle the means of production
[01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:55.620]  They gave all the production to Joseph. He gave it all to the Pharaoh
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:57:01.220]  Third year they come back and they don't have any food and they said why should we die and Joseph says I will give you
[01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:05.580]  I'll give you food and I'll give you grain to live for another year if you sell yourself
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:12.180]  You sell your land and yourselves into bondage to the Pharaoh and the people said what the heck such a deal
[01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:15.260]  Why should we die they sold themselves into bondage?
[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:22.900]  Joseph enslaved the Egyptian people to the Pharaoh prior to Joseph the Pharaoh was there kind of like a TV evangelist
[01:57:22.900 --> 01:57:30.020]  He had people to pay attention to him, but he didn't run and own the whole country Joseph put the whole country under
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:33.080]  ownership and control of Pharaoh and that's
[01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:41.020]  Very interesting when you hear the story of the Jews later on being put into bondage by the Egyptians and the just oh
[01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:43.020]  This was so unfair wait a second
[01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:49.820]  Joseph the first Hebrew down there into G in the into Egypt. He put the Egyptians into bondage
[01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:53.180]  But the point to this is Joseph understood
[01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:58.340]  Economics well enough three thousand years ago where he could put a whole nation into bondage
[01:57:58.340 --> 01:58:04.340]  It's right there in the Bible chapter 47 a Genesis read it
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:10.500]  And it's there and you'll see and I'm guaranteed that 99% of people in your audience have never heard this no no no
[01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:13.340]  That's why the Old Testament is a weapon system
[01:58:14.060 --> 01:58:20.540]  People perish for lack of knowledge. They don't know they think oh reading old old history stuff. They have no idea
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:24.700]  I talked to executives. I've talked to billionaires who aren't that smart
[01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:30.020]  They just gotten a niche and or or position there. It is incredible how dumb down people are
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:38.220]  They're like animals. They just don't have the ancient knowledge that the ancients developed. It's all waiting for us. We'll be back

[02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:36.060]  Alfred, I wanted to ask you that question. Why do you think everything's moving at high per speed now where they're just on the news going
[02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:42.060]  Hey, we're all government. You know what? We'll answer that after the break. Finish up in this brief short segment long segment coming up
[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:46.060]  With the story of Joseph any other tidbits you wanted to hit
[02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:55.060]  Well, Joseph, I don't know. We pretty much hit it. I mean, it's it's just a question. He took he captured a whole a whole nation and put them in bondage to the feral
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:02:04.060]  And the people consented all the way and they even cheered. They said, hooray, Joseph has saved us. No, he didn't. He took those people from
[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:12.060]  And that's the story now with the bankers engineering the collapse than posing as the saviors. Yeah, exactly. Exactly
[02:02:12.060 --> 02:02:20.060]  And it's 3000 years anyway since the time of Joseph and how many people have it's right there in the Bible. How many people know it?
[02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:30.060]  It's right there. It's almost everything you need to know about economics. You know, you can get a good economist and they understand all sorts of interesting things about the velocity of money and M1 M2 and 3
[02:02:30.060 --> 02:02:40.060]  But maybe all the average person needs to know about economics is right there in chapter 47 if you can read if you can see and you said, wow, what does this mean
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:46.060]  You can see this is happening now. We're doing it again. It's it's astonishing
[02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:56.060]  You know, I see the general public they're either really waking up or they're like in this giggling gibbering delusional childlike state. Have you noticed that?
[02:02:56.060 --> 02:03:03.060]  Yeah, I get what you people are afraid. You know, one thing I've seen over the years is you can bring a new idea to someone
[02:03:03.060 --> 02:03:12.060]  And that person understands the idea on an intuitive level before he understands this consciously and he'll understand that if I accept that idea
[02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:23.060]  It's going to put me in a position where one of these days I'm going to be forced to choose between what I know to be right based on this new idea and just getting along in life
[02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:35.060]  And I don't know that I have the courage to make that choice. I would prefer to look in the mirror every day and think of myself as a good man because I haven't made any difficult choices or refused to make those choices
[02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:46.060]  I know I'm trying to make that very clear but people can understand beautifully said they will reject them if they understand this thing's going to cause it's going to make me have to make a very big choice one of these days
[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:49.060]  And I don't want to make that choice. I don't want to be put in that position. So they have
[02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:54.060]  But as soon as I started living like that I was suddenly so fulfilled it's like hard to even handle
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:04:06.060]  I mean these people are so empty that live in cowardice and they think hype and trendiness will empower them so they get deeper and deeper into trendiness but they fill out surveys and say they're the most unhappy people in the world
[02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:13.060]  Just the trendiness that conformity it's just a place to hide. It's a place to appear that you're getting along fine
[02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:22.060]  But I'll tell you something I'm sure you understand you know this is a lifestyle that is dangerous you become a dissident you become a thorn in the side
[02:04:22.060 --> 02:04:33.060]  But you have meaning in your life and I know I have meaning in my life and I look at other people and I understand I'm not making much money I'm not a wealthy man
[02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:40.060]  But I'm living better than most people in this world will ever know I have meaning
[02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:51.060]  Well you have your mind you're not being chumped you're aware you know what how things work it's just spiritually it's fulfilling that's what matters is you're satisfied
[02:04:51.060 --> 02:05:01.060]  Stay there I want to come back and get into that question why are they accelerating their program of enslavement with Alfred Adash, I'm Alex Jones

[02:07:57.060 --> 02:08:00.060]  This is Alex Jones for www.survivalseedbank.com
[02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:04.060]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk
[02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:07.060]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:19.060]  All right, one more segment with the always informative Alfred Adask
[02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:25.060]  He joins us right now for a final segment, Adask.wordpress.com
[02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:31.060]  Again, I am Alex Jones, your host, we've got big news coming up in the next segment after he leaves us
[02:08:31.060 --> 02:08:37.060]  I want to break down why no one should serve the New World Order
[02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:47.060]  I mean, even if you're an evil person, you're crazy to serve this New World Order, this global corporate anti-free market government that is eugenics based
[02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:56.060]  Alfred, the question, studying this, publishing the anti-shyster for over a decade, researching and having 60 minutes demonize you
[02:08:56.060 --> 02:09:00.060]  I mean, you've got your finger on the pulse out there of what's going on over the years
[02:09:00.060 --> 02:09:07.060]  I see a huge awakening, either people are getting more awake and speaking out or seeing it everywhere
[02:09:07.060 --> 02:09:14.060]  Or they're getting more dumbed down, but how do people, national news, come out and say, Jones is crazy
[02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:17.060]  He thinks there's a global government being established by megabanks
[02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:23.060]  When all of the news they say, global governments being established by megabanks, aren't we lucky they're taking over
[02:09:23.060 --> 02:09:28.060]  But simultaneously, the Southern Primary Law Center ADL says it doesn't exist and I'm evil
[02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:32.060]  Why do you think they're moving so quick right now?
[02:09:32.060 --> 02:09:42.060]  They're desperate, when during the invasion of Iraq, Bush Jr. got bogged down
[02:09:42.060 --> 02:09:47.060]  They went in and they gave him a dose of shock and awe and they thought this whole thing would be over 90 days
[02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:52.060]  We had mission accomplished out there on the aircraft carrier and so on
[02:09:52.060 --> 02:09:56.060]  It turned out we got caught up in there for eight or nine years
[02:09:56.060 --> 02:10:03.060]  Zignu Brzezinski, early on, he was, I saw him, I believe was on the Charlie Rose program
[02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:09.060]  And he was criticizing George Bush and he said, the new world order has been, or global government
[02:10:09.060 --> 02:10:12.060]  I don't remember which one he said, but the new world order is what he meant for sure
[02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:17.060]  Has been set back 20 years and he was angry, he was pissed, alright
[02:10:17.060 --> 02:10:24.060]  That tells us that their plan was not to really impose themselves upon us for another 20 years
[02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:27.060]  They had another 20 years going on, which would be 10 years from now
[02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:32.060]  10 years, 20 years from the beginning of the Iraq war and he said it's been set back 20 years
[02:10:32.060 --> 02:10:37.060]  They're not doing that anymore, I think in large measure because of the internet programs like your own
[02:10:37.060 --> 02:10:42.060]  People are awakening, not everybody but a percentage, you don't need them all
[02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:48.060]  But if you can get a big enough, you hit critical mass and all of a sudden the world just might go the other way
[02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:54.060]  So I see the new world order as acting openly and aggressively as an act of desperation
[02:10:54.060 --> 02:11:00.060]  The truth of the matter is, if they are really in control, they will shear the sheep
[02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:04.060]  And the sheep won't even notice that their fur has been taken
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:07.060]  It's when they have to become overt
[02:11:07.060 --> 02:11:11.060]  I mean, TSA is not evidence that the system is growing more powerful
[02:11:11.060 --> 02:11:14.060]  From my perspective, it's evidence that they're growing more powerful
[02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:18.060]  They're crazy, it's unifying everyone
[02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:22.060]  It's one of the issues that's unifying people across the spectrum
[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:27.060]  I know it's self-destructive on their part, it really is almost absurd
[02:11:27.060 --> 02:11:31.060]  But it's evidence they're desperate, they're grasping for straws
[02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:35.060]  What are they going to do other than kick people around? They've got nothing left
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:39.060]  They're getting hundreds and hundreds of giant black armored wheeled vehicles
[02:11:39.060 --> 02:11:43.060]  That look like something out of a science fiction movie, they're telling us the drones are coming to get us
[02:11:43.060 --> 02:11:46.060]  They really think that we're intimidated like they are
[02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:52.060]  Now that may work on some of the cowards, but a lot of people who wouldn't even speak out are actually getting mad
[02:11:52.060 --> 02:11:55.060]  Because they see the systems trying to intimidate them
[02:11:55.060 --> 02:11:57.060]  Yep, that's exactly right
[02:11:57.060 --> 02:12:00.060]  Plus, they don't have enough corn cobs to deal with us
[02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:05.060]  The truth of the matter is, the mighty American military could barely handle Iraq
[02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:08.060]  Which is about the size and population of Texas
[02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:15.060]  What are they going to do with not just one state like Texas, what are they going to do if they have to contend with 50?
[02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:18.060]  They can bluff us into submission
[02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:21.060]  But they don't have the power to push us into submission
[02:12:21.060 --> 02:12:24.060]  If they bluff us, we consent, and that's what they're looking for
[02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:28.060]  Oh, they're going to huff and puff and blow our house down if we don't do what they say
[02:12:28.060 --> 02:12:30.060]  Yeah, well, maybe yes and maybe no
[02:12:30.060 --> 02:12:34.060]  It depends on how many people stand up on their hind legs and say, no, we're not going along with this
[02:12:34.060 --> 02:12:39.060]  Plus, we've got tens of millions of armed Americans in this country
[02:12:39.060 --> 02:12:45.060]  This is not, I don't care if you are, right now the police make up 3 tenths of a percent of the population
[02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:47.060]  They're outnumbered 300 to 1
[02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:50.060]  The military is about the same thing, 3 tenths of a percent
[02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:54.060]  Even if you put them both together, they are outnumbered somewhere in the neighborhood of 100
[02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:58.060]  Oh, I know, people all the time say you can't fight the military if it goes to blows
[02:12:58.060 --> 02:13:04.060]  I mean, it'll be like trying to get a hunting permit for unicorns
[02:13:04.060 --> 02:13:10.060]  I mean, it would be so hard if everybody tried to go out and bag one, you couldn't even find one
[02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:12.060]  Yeah, they'd be fighting amongst themselves
[02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:15.060]  No, I get to shoot though, I get to shoot, you know, I mean
[02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:19.060]  If you're outnumbered 100 to 1, I don't care what kind of weapon you have
[02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:23.060]  If you're 100 adversaries, if all they have are bricks
[02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:29.060]  You get 100 bricks coming in on your position at the same time, and I don't care if you've got a 50 caliber machine gun
[02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:36.060]  You may get a bunch of that 100 people, but you're going to die under an onslaught of bricks and stones and bottles
[02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:38.060]  You can't deal with that
[02:13:38.060 --> 02:13:43.060]  Well, number one, they want to get the military and police fighting with the American people
[02:13:43.060 --> 02:13:48.060]  They're now saying the enemy is in Al Qaeda, it's the sovereign citizens, it's the returning veterans
[02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:53.060]  I see us winning the Info War with police and military now in a big way
[02:13:53.060 --> 02:14:00.060]  Because everything you talked about 20 years ago, everything I talked about 17 years ago, it's all come true
[02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:04.060]  So we have a lot of credibility, they're not stupid, they see what's happening
[02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:11.060]  And now this new army report where they're teaching the military that the Tea Party is going to link up with Al Qaeda
[02:14:11.060 --> 02:14:17.060]  I mean, the criminal bankers are trying to now say the Tea Party's Al Qaeda, the police know that's ridiculous
[02:14:17.060 --> 02:14:25.060]  They know, so it's tiny foreign offshore bankers, only a few thousand of them total, trying to get us to kill each other
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:27.060]  That's how they're going to try to win
[02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:32.060]  I understand, and the truth of the matter is the police have far more in common with the people than they do with the government
[02:14:32.060 --> 02:14:37.060]  They've read they are functioning as knee breakers for the mob that runs this country, that's what they're being encouraged to do
[02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:42.060]  But the truth is they have far more in common with the ordinary people than they do with the people that they're taking orders from
[02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:47.060]  And in the end, they're masters, people giving orders, saying why don't you and them fight, why don't you get killed
[02:14:47.060 --> 02:14:50.060]  We'll wait over here, you go get killed
[02:14:50.060 --> 02:14:57.060]  You know, I mean, as a police officer, you got to look at some of this stuff and say to yourself, you know, this is crazy
[02:14:57.060 --> 02:15:05.060]  They're asking me to fight against hundreds of American people, and I don't really have a personal gripe with them
[02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:12.060]  Well, that's right, and expanding on that, that's why they're racing to autonomous drones and autonomous robots
[02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:17.060]  Basically an 18-wheeler that pulls up at your house and dumps a bunch of robots out of the back, that's what they've already got
[02:15:17.060 --> 02:15:24.060]  They want to go to an automated system, but that's a decade off till that's really totally feasible
[02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:28.060]  And even in the end, it's not like we're going to run out and fight the robots on their turf
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:34.060]  You know, this is going to go into a guerrilla war if we get to that point, and I'm trying to avert that
[02:15:34.060 --> 02:15:41.060]  What do you think about the attempts of the globalist to track everything, to digitize, to predict the future with their computers
[02:15:41.060 --> 02:15:47.060]  Which they already admit they can do to a great extent when we use their systems and they can track us, and to go to the machine-based system
[02:15:47.060 --> 02:15:50.060]  So they don't have humans that can refuse orders
[02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:55.060]  Well, here's the problem, they're going to have central control systems on this
[02:15:55.060 --> 02:16:02.060]  If you've got all these robots or whatever it is you're going to put out there, drones, I guarantee you, you put drones up over Dallas, Texas
[02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:08.060]  There's going to be one place where half a dozen or fifty people sit down and control the drones
[02:16:08.060 --> 02:16:14.060]  There's going to be one target, all right? They're going to have centralized control on these things
[02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:17.060]  The drones don't think for themselves, neither do the robots
[02:16:17.060 --> 02:16:23.060]  Somebody's sitting back in a room full of computers and they've already got autonomous, they're going to be satellite-based
[02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:29.060]  And that brings us to the next deal, they can launch false flags with these drones and blame other governments or people with it
[02:16:29.060 --> 02:16:33.060]  It's a nightmare situation, that was a drone attack on 9-11
[02:16:33.060 --> 02:16:40.060]  Well, I understand, airplanes allegedly did things that airplanes can't do
[02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:43.060]  What can you say?
[02:16:43.060 --> 02:16:50.060]  Well, I mean, all the calls that were real off-airphones, not the fake ones the FBI admit were never made by the solicitor, General's wife
[02:16:50.060 --> 02:16:54.060]  I mean, it turned out that it was fake, that's like Associated Press
[02:16:54.060 --> 02:16:58.060]  The real calls were, there's gas, I can't breathe, they just had guys that were in a drill
[02:16:58.060 --> 02:17:02.060]  We know they worked for the government, they nerve-gassed everybody on board and a computer took over
[02:17:02.060 --> 02:17:06.060]  And it's just incredibly diabolical that they did that
[02:17:06.060 --> 02:17:10.060]  Well, every bit of this is diabolical, you look back on this, for example
[02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:13.060]  We talked about this man or other animals thing I harp on it on a regular basis
[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:17.060]  First instance we found was the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act
[02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:22.060]  They defined food and drugs in terms of man or other animals
[02:17:22.060 --> 02:17:27.060]  This is not an accident, this is evidence, this has been going on for a century
[02:17:27.060 --> 02:17:30.060]  It's been in our law
[02:17:30.060 --> 02:17:34.060]  They said black people weren't humans and that's why they could kill them or use them as slaves
[02:17:34.060 --> 02:17:38.060]  This is thousands of years old, this is 4,000 years old
[02:17:38.060 --> 02:17:40.060]  Yeah, that's exactly right
[02:17:40.060 --> 02:17:43.060]  And again, this is spiritual warfare, that's war engagement
[02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:47.060]  And I say, hooray, once you get that you understand this is great
[02:17:47.060 --> 02:17:48.060]  I mean, this is great
[02:17:48.060 --> 02:17:51.060]  But you're not going to get the ammo you need at the 501c3 churches
[02:17:51.060 --> 02:17:56.060]  No, it's going to be a dangerous time, but if you really believe, if you think there's another life coming
[02:17:56.060 --> 02:17:59.060]  Hey, spiritual warfare is fun
[02:17:59.060 --> 02:18:03.060]  I know it's scary, I don't mean to understate, I don't mean to misstate
[02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:07.060]  No, I understand, when you actually tap into God, this all becomes fun
[02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:10.060]  I mean, even bad stuff becomes fun because you're doing the right thing
[02:18:10.060 --> 02:18:13.060]  That's exactly right
[02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:18.060]  And it removes that sense of doubt, it removes that sense of personal fear and anxiety
[02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:20.060]  And all of a sudden, hey, I'm good to go
[02:18:20.060 --> 02:18:24.060]  Well, the globalists in the videos we've gotten from Homeland Security Training, they go
[02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:26.060]  And these people are committed and they're never going to back off
[02:18:26.060 --> 02:18:29.060]  So you better watch them and they're all scared of us in these meetings
[02:18:29.060 --> 02:18:33.060]  They believe, they stand for something
[02:18:33.060 --> 02:18:35.060]  I mean, what do you guys believe in?
[02:18:35.060 --> 02:18:39.060]  You serve a bunch of foreign banks that want to abort little kids and stuff?
[02:18:39.060 --> 02:18:40.060]  I mean, that's sick
[02:18:40.060 --> 02:18:42.060]  You know how stupid this is?
[02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:45.060]  There are reports from Southern Poverty Law Center that estimate
[02:18:45.060 --> 02:18:51.060]  There's 300,000 members of the sovereignty movement, whatever that is, in the United States
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:58.060]  And the FBI says there have been six homicides since 2000, in 12 years
[02:18:58.060 --> 02:19:01.060]  There have been six homicides that have been linked to sovereigns
[02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:03.060]  I didn't even say that these sovereign people
[02:19:03.060 --> 02:19:04.060]  But we're the number one threat
[02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:06.060]  Well, here's the problem
[02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:10.060]  The homicide rate in this country is 17 per 100,000
[02:19:10.060 --> 02:19:17.060]  If there are 300,000 sovereigns, we should be killing at least 17 people
[02:19:17.060 --> 02:19:20.060]  Three times that, 50-some people every year
[02:19:20.060 --> 02:19:24.060]  And in fact, they can only point to six in 12 years
[02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:30.060]  It indicates that we are orders of magnitude less violent than the ordinary people
[02:19:30.060 --> 02:19:32.060]  That's the implication, and these are the numbers they put
[02:19:32.060 --> 02:19:34.060]  That's right, but we're smarter, yet we're smarter
[02:19:34.060 --> 02:19:37.060]  And know how to navigate with our words is what's happening
[02:19:37.060 --> 02:19:38.060]  That's the problem
[02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:39.060]  I'm a dangerous man
[02:19:39.060 --> 02:19:40.060]  Do you know why?
[02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:42.060]  I've got a dozen dictionaries
[02:19:42.060 --> 02:19:45.060]  I've got seven copies, seven different versions of the Bible
[02:19:45.060 --> 02:19:48.060]  And that's hard copy, plus what I've got on the computer
[02:19:48.060 --> 02:19:49.060]  That makes me a dangerous man
[02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:52.060]  I can read, I can write, I am dangerous
[02:19:52.060 --> 02:19:54.060]  Well, you've got the Bible, man
[02:19:54.060 --> 02:19:56.060]  And right there, like you said, it's all right there
[02:19:56.060 --> 02:19:58.060]  That's why they make fun of it all day
[02:19:58.060 --> 02:20:20.060]  They're scared you're going to get in it
[02:20:28.060 --> 02:20:30.060]  As the price of raw ingredients increases
[02:20:30.060 --> 02:20:32.060]  E-Foods will have to raise prices too
[02:20:32.060 --> 02:20:34.060]  Now is the time to get your supply
[02:20:34.060 --> 02:20:36.060]  I recently increased my supply from E-Foods Direct

[02:21:00.060 --> 02:21:03.060]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book
[02:21:03.060 --> 02:21:05.060]  Cancer Step Outside the Box
[02:21:05.060 --> 02:21:08.060]  I want you to know some very important information
[02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:11.060]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that
[02:21:11.060 --> 02:21:14.060]  Carnivora be sent directly to the White House
[02:21:14.060 --> 02:21:17.060]  At a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer
[02:21:17.060 --> 02:21:21.060]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivore capsules are used around the world
[02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:23.060]  To keep people healthy
[02:21:23.060 --> 02:21:25.060]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones
[02:21:25.060 --> 02:21:29.060]  In this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds
[02:21:29.060 --> 02:21:32.060]  That instinctively respond to abnormal cells only
[02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:34.060]  Without harming a single normal cell
[02:21:34.060 --> 02:21:37.060]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally
[02:21:37.060 --> 02:21:40.060]  Wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders
[02:21:40.060 --> 02:21:42.060]  That don't belong in your body

[02:22:05.060 --> 02:22:07.060]  Could get me in a lot of trouble
[02:22:07.060 --> 02:22:09.060]  I just created a free video presentation
[02:22:09.060 --> 02:22:12.060]  At 123coverup.com
[02:22:12.060 --> 02:22:14.060]  That exposes the electricity monopolies
[02:22:14.060 --> 02:22:16.060]  And government agencies for what they really are
[02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:19.060]  Incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance
[02:22:19.060 --> 02:22:22.060]  And fear to keep your power bills criminally high
[02:22:22.060 --> 02:22:24.060]  Some have called this a conspiracy
[02:22:24.060 --> 02:22:26.060]  Others have called it a cover-up
[02:22:26.060 --> 02:22:30.060]  And you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes
[02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:34.060]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth
[02:22:34.060 --> 02:22:36.060]  And shows you the secret of how I beat them
[02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:38.060]  And how you can beat them too

[02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:44.060]  Have already seen in the last three months

[02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:32.060]  I am the man of constant sorrow
[02:24:32.060 --> 02:24:36.060]  I've seen trouble all my days
[02:24:36.060 --> 02:24:40.060]  I've been fairway
[02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:42.060]  Coming up in the next segment
[02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:44.060]  I'm going to get into the panopticon of technology control
[02:24:44.060 --> 02:24:46.060]  And the globalist master plan
[02:24:46.060 --> 02:24:51.060]  All of us have the responsibility to stand up against it and speak out against it immediately
[02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:55.060]  Also up at drudgerport.com on the left-hand side
[02:24:55.060 --> 02:24:58.060]  U.S. veterans forcibly sequestered in mental hospitals
[02:24:58.060 --> 02:25:01.060]  Is in definite detention and it's happening everywhere
[02:25:01.060 --> 02:25:07.060]  And it's one of these creeping operations that they're running against the people
[02:25:07.060 --> 02:25:11.060]  But again, coming up, scientists successfully hack brain to obtain private data
[02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:13.060]  I'll give you my take on that
[02:25:13.060 --> 02:25:17.060]  Right now, police outnumber convention protesters 4 to 1 in Tampa
[02:25:17.060 --> 02:25:19.060]  The Hill newspaper is reporting
[02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:22.060]  They have the TSA on the street searching people
[02:25:22.060 --> 02:25:24.060]  All over the city, including many miles away
[02:25:24.060 --> 02:25:26.060]  We have videos and articles
[02:25:26.060 --> 02:25:29.060]  People with cameras are being grabbed by the police and put in databases
[02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:31.060]  I mean, it's just all an exercise of the police day
[02:25:31.060 --> 02:25:35.060]  Because a bunch of Republican establishment people are meeting
[02:25:35.060 --> 02:25:37.060]  I mean, whoop-de-doo
[02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:42.060]  It's so ridiculous how they use any event now as a pretext to totally take over
[02:25:42.060 --> 02:25:45.060]  Like Katrina, they use that to take the guns
[02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:49.060]  Heaven forbid there be another flood in Louisiana
[02:25:49.060 --> 02:25:51.060]  They'll come to get the guns there
[02:25:51.060 --> 02:25:54.060]  Even in rural areas, you're high and dry on a house in Stilts
[02:25:54.060 --> 02:25:56.060]  They pull up, you've got a generator
[02:25:56.060 --> 02:25:58.060]  They go, we're coming in to take your guns
[02:25:58.060 --> 02:26:00.060]  I mean, since when did the government do that?
[02:26:00.060 --> 02:26:02.060]  I mean, they just want the precedent
[02:26:02.060 --> 02:26:04.060]  They want to set it
[02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:08.060]  What they don't want you to know about is on WOKV television
[02:26:08.060 --> 02:26:12.060]  And I see these in local news every day
[02:26:12.060 --> 02:26:15.060]  In fact, they have websites that show people that are involved in self-defense
[02:26:15.060 --> 02:26:19.060]  We should create a whole subsection of infowars.com or prisonpunnet.com
[02:26:19.060 --> 02:26:22.060]  I'm going to do that just on these stories
[02:26:22.060 --> 02:26:25.060]  Because, I mean, what, over 20 times more often
[02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:29.060]  The FBI's own crime statistics show that guns are used to stop crime
[02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:31.060]  Then they're used for crime
[02:26:31.060 --> 02:26:34.060]  I mean, look at the areas where they've taken all the guns
[02:26:34.060 --> 02:26:36.060]  That's where you have the crime
[02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:40.060]  Customer shoots Robert Dead, Jacksonville, Florida
[02:26:40.060 --> 02:26:43.060]  Instead of saving money, a Northside dollar store
[02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:48.060]  A 57-year-old grandfather ends up saving the day
[02:26:48.060 --> 02:26:54.060]  The man was doing some late night shopping at the Dollar General Store in Dunn Avenue
[02:26:54.060 --> 02:26:57.060]  All of a sudden, two men stormed and tried robbing it
[02:26:57.060 --> 02:27:01.060]  Unfortunately for them, the man appears to have a concealed weapons permit
[02:27:01.060 --> 02:27:07.060]  Said Lieutenant Rob Schoonover with the Jacksonville Sheriff's Department
[02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:09.060]  That's Jacksonville, Florida
[02:27:09.060 --> 02:27:11.060]  Hey, go for the police to not demonize the guy
[02:27:11.060 --> 02:27:14.060]  Usually they demonize somebody when they defend themselves
[02:27:14.060 --> 02:27:16.060]  As I can tell you, you've got a better police department
[02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:18.060]  If they go, oh good, the citizen took them out
[02:27:18.060 --> 02:27:21.060]  If they demonize it, you get rid of that police chief
[02:27:21.060 --> 02:27:24.060]  Unfortunately for them, one of the men happens to have had a concealed weapons permit
[02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:29.060]  Said Lieutenant Rob Schoonover with the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office
[02:27:29.060 --> 02:27:33.060]  Says the man wasted no time springing into action
[02:27:33.060 --> 02:27:37.060]  Yeah, have you watched all these countless videos of the woman in the jewelry store
[02:27:37.060 --> 02:27:40.060]  The guy, you know, a few weeks ago, all these cases
[02:27:40.060 --> 02:27:43.060]  In the internet cafe where the people come in with their shotguns
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:46.060]  I mean, these are citizens' second amendment
[02:27:46.060 --> 02:27:49.060]  You know, grew up with guns, they're boom, they aim right at them
[02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:51.060]  You know, just like police training, that's just basic training
[02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:54.060]  Boom, boom, boom, they shoot them, guys fall over dead
[02:27:54.060 --> 02:27:56.060]  Or, you know, start bleeding and run off
[02:27:56.060 --> 02:27:59.060]  And the untrained crooks always just drop their weapons and run
[02:27:59.060 --> 02:28:01.060]  Because they grew up watching television where that's what you do
[02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:04.060]  You know, when your gun's out of bullets, you just throw it down
[02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:07.060]  Or if somebody shoots at you, you just run in fear
[02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:09.060]  Because most of these criminals are just complete idiots
[02:28:09.060 --> 02:28:12.060]  Smart ones go and join government or join big corporations
[02:28:12.060 --> 02:28:15.060]  You know, they don't come in in even case places
[02:28:15.060 --> 02:28:20.060]  They just walk in in places like Texas and Florida where every other person's got a gun
[02:28:20.060 --> 02:28:23.060]  I saw an article a few weeks ago where a woman was jogging at a 25
[02:28:23.060 --> 02:28:26.060]  I see that all the time, guys try to rape her, she shoots them
[02:28:26.060 --> 02:28:30.060]  But no, it's feminist though, Gloria Steinem says to not have a gun
[02:28:30.060 --> 02:28:34.060]  And just try to call a cop whose average response time's 11 and a half minutes
[02:28:34.060 --> 02:28:37.060]  I mean, my daughters are learning how to shoot guns
[02:28:37.060 --> 02:28:40.060]  And they're going to have guns, and when they go away
[02:28:40.060 --> 02:28:43.060]  There's even college when they get that age, or even a country left
[02:28:43.060 --> 02:28:45.060]  You know, you try to come hurt them, they're not good
[02:28:45.060 --> 02:28:48.060]  I mean, number one, my eight-year-old can already beat me up
[02:28:48.060 --> 02:28:50.060]  She's just a gymnast and everything else
[02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:55.060]  And she likes to wrestle in box and stuff, she's meaner than the rattlesnake
[02:28:55.060 --> 02:28:59.060]  And pretty is, I can't say what, but just beautiful
[02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:03.060]  But I just love the fact that my women are really empowered and strong
[02:29:03.060 --> 02:29:06.060]  Not this whole fake feminist thing, but that's the side issue
[02:29:06.060 --> 02:29:08.060]  Here's the big issue I want to make
[02:29:08.060 --> 02:29:11.060]  Here's what nobody's pointing out
[02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:17.060]  The New York police could sure get some training from citizens that know how to use guns
[02:29:17.060 --> 02:29:23.060]  Because all over the place, people come in to arm rob and the citizens just draw down and take them out
[02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:28.060]  And in all these hundreds of cases I've seen the last year, they never shoot anybody else
[02:29:28.060 --> 02:29:35.060]  That's because they relax, raise their firearm, and start pumping rounds into people
[02:29:35.060 --> 02:29:40.060]  And even if you've grown up around guns and think you're good, go take a class, I've done that
[02:29:40.060 --> 02:29:45.060]  Go take a refresher, go to a shooting school, the police are doing it, you never can get enough training
[02:29:45.060 --> 02:29:48.060]  The New York police could learn from citizens
[02:30:15.060 --> 02:30:20.060]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices
[02:30:20.060 --> 02:30:24.060]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices
[02:30:24.060 --> 02:30:27.060]  By getting your own supply of foods from E-Foods Direct now
[02:30:27.060 --> 02:30:31.060]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, E-Foods will have to raise prices too
[02:30:31.060 --> 02:30:33.060]  Now is the time to get your supply
[02:30:33.060 --> 02:30:37.060]  I recently increased my supply from E-Foods Direct because we've all known this was coming
[02:30:37.060 --> 02:30:40.060]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods
[02:30:40.060 --> 02:30:45.060]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today, and because it's stored for 25 years
[02:30:45.060 --> 02:30:48.060]  You're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost

[02:33:04.060 --> 02:33:20.060]  It's Alex Jones
[02:33:34.060 --> 02:33:39.060]  Human potential is almost unlimited
[02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:45.060]  Because we are made in the image of the creator of the universe
[02:33:45.060 --> 02:33:49.060]  And the establishment knows that and they want to dominate the future
[02:33:49.060 --> 02:33:52.060]  They want the spoils of human development and human culture
[02:33:52.060 --> 02:33:56.060]  And they don't want physical biological slaves anymore
[02:33:56.060 --> 02:33:59.060]  They want to get rid of us and be served by machines
[02:33:59.060 --> 02:34:02.060]  And have a tiny technocratic servant group
[02:34:02.060 --> 02:34:08.060]  And they write endless books and publications and literature on this subject
[02:34:08.060 --> 02:34:13.060]  And are declaring that they're already waging war on us by means of siege
[02:34:13.060 --> 02:34:17.060]  Shutting down our resources, our infrastructure, our culture
[02:34:17.060 --> 02:34:22.060]  Poisoning us, cheating us, so that they can dominate us
[02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:25.060]  Trying to breed us for stupidity and weakness
[02:34:25.060 --> 02:34:32.060]  It is truly disgusting that all of this is happening and all of this is going on
[02:34:32.060 --> 02:34:38.060]  And I want to have a message to everybody and a message to the establishment as well
[02:34:38.060 --> 02:34:45.060]  Here in just a moment and go over more of the news
[02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:49.060]  The toll-free number to join us on the subjects that you heard Alfred Adas talk about
[02:34:49.060 --> 02:34:52.060]  Or what I've talked about, we'll have time to take a few calls here
[02:34:52.060 --> 02:34:55.060]  I do have Steve Quayle with a big in-depth interview
[02:34:55.060 --> 02:34:59.060]  Coming up tonight on M4 Wars Nightly News
[02:34:59.060 --> 02:35:03.060]  Aaron's doing the news, I'm doing an in-depth hour-long interview with Steve Quayle
[02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:06.060]  Tonight he'll be on the radio with us tomorrow
[02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:08.060]  Just a program note there
[02:35:08.060 --> 02:35:20.060]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-2599231
[02:35:20.060 --> 02:35:25.060]  Briefly, we are two hours and 35 minutes into this global transmission
[02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:30.060]  I would also like to add that, remember, this broadcast is listener-supported
[02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:33.060]  We're not like Media Matters that gets money from George Soros
[02:35:33.060 --> 02:35:37.060]  That got his money from taxpayers worldwide in banker bailouts
[02:35:37.060 --> 02:35:43.060]  We're not like MSNBC that on record got jobs program money from the White House
[02:35:43.060 --> 02:35:45.060]  What was it, 500 million?
[02:35:45.060 --> 02:35:50.060]  They got another billion roughly at NBC Total out of banker bailout money
[02:35:50.060 --> 02:35:53.060]  Your taxpayer money
[02:35:53.060 --> 02:35:55.060]  We are not supported by that
[02:35:55.060 --> 02:35:59.060]  In fact, the system fights tooth and nail to keep us from even being able to get to you
[02:35:59.060 --> 02:36:04.060]  But despite that, because there are a lot of people that love freedom and truth worldwide
[02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:08.060]  We've been able to get on over 115 AM and FM stations
[02:36:08.060 --> 02:36:10.060]  Global shortwave
[02:36:10.060 --> 02:36:17.060]  Number one when it comes to audio streams and podcasts for talk radio at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[02:36:17.060 --> 02:36:19.060]  And on XM166
[02:36:19.060 --> 02:36:25.060]  So it's a big deal that we've been able to crawl and scrape over 17 years up to this point
[02:36:25.060 --> 02:36:28.060]  And if we were able to have the same growth rate continuing
[02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:35.060]  It would spell just unbelievable curtains for the globalist
[02:36:35.060 --> 02:36:40.060]  They understand that if they destroy me wrong or try to destroy this operation incorrectly
[02:36:40.060 --> 02:36:44.060]  It could turn us into a cause celeb
[02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:47.060]  That's why they try to exterminate us
[02:36:47.060 --> 02:36:51.060]  Going after our character and going after our name
[02:36:51.060 --> 02:36:54.060]  They want to assassinate our name
[02:36:54.060 --> 02:36:56.060]  Instead of assassinating you physically
[02:36:56.060 --> 02:36:59.060]  Because they understand everything is an infowar
[02:36:59.060 --> 02:37:01.060]  Until the final blow that's physical
[02:37:01.060 --> 02:37:10.060]  We are cheerfully marching forward into incredible danger
[02:37:10.060 --> 02:37:13.060]  But I will be honest with you that is incredible excitement
[02:37:13.060 --> 02:37:15.060]  Because the road is a good road
[02:37:15.060 --> 02:37:19.060]  It's an honorable road and honor is all that matters
[02:37:19.060 --> 02:37:24.060]  And I don't say that because I am this absolutely wonderful perfect person
[02:37:24.060 --> 02:37:26.060]  But my heart is good, I want to be good
[02:37:26.060 --> 02:37:28.060]  I want to help people
[02:37:28.060 --> 02:37:30.060]  I want humanity to succeed
[02:37:30.060 --> 02:37:33.060]  And I want to thank all of you for getting us to this point
[02:37:33.060 --> 02:37:36.060]  We wouldn't have been this successful and couldn't have done anything
[02:37:36.060 --> 02:37:43.060]  If people didn't see past my idiosyncratic nature
[02:37:43.060 --> 02:37:49.060]  And understand with your discernment that my heart is good
[02:37:49.060 --> 02:37:52.060]  Because our hearts are good and we're turned towards the Creator
[02:37:52.060 --> 02:37:58.060]  And love everything that is good and recoil from that
[02:37:58.060 --> 02:38:01.060]  That is bad including our own selves
[02:38:01.060 --> 02:38:05.060]  The aspects of us are lesser angels as they say
[02:38:05.060 --> 02:38:07.060]  But we are in a epic struggle
[02:38:07.060 --> 02:38:12.060]  And the fact that someone of my background and skill
[02:38:12.060 --> 02:38:14.060]  Which is not that great
[02:38:14.060 --> 02:38:16.060]  But I have a wide range of gifts
[02:38:16.060 --> 02:38:17.060]  We all have gifts
[02:38:17.060 --> 02:38:22.060]  But compared to many my gifts are not nothing to write home about
[02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:24.060]  Other than the fact that I've been dedicated
[02:38:24.060 --> 02:38:28.060]  And that I have been tireless and that I have been committed
[02:38:28.060 --> 02:38:30.060]  Those are some of my better traits
[02:38:30.060 --> 02:38:33.060]  And the oratory that the good Lord gave me
[02:38:33.060 --> 02:38:36.060]  The memory, the vocabulary
[02:38:36.060 --> 02:38:41.060]  And the willingness to go forward against bullies
[02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:45.060]  All of that has brought me to the point I am today
[02:38:45.060 --> 02:38:50.060]  And I am here just wanting to thank all of you for your support
[02:38:50.060 --> 02:38:56.060]  And thank you for everything you've done in the fight for liberty
[02:38:56.060 --> 02:38:58.060]  And I know you want to thank me as well
[02:38:58.060 --> 02:39:01.060]  But I would imagine those of you out there hearing me thank you
[02:39:01.060 --> 02:39:02.060]  You're like, why are you thanking me?
[02:39:02.060 --> 02:39:05.060]  We're in this together, we're under attack
[02:39:05.060 --> 02:39:07.060]  We've got to build a future for our children and their children
[02:39:07.060 --> 02:39:10.060]  We've got to wrestle with the darkness
[02:39:10.060 --> 02:39:12.060]  And that's why I don't like being thanked
[02:39:12.060 --> 02:39:13.060]  So we're on the same page
[02:39:13.060 --> 02:39:17.060]  But nevertheless, I do want to thank you
[02:39:17.060 --> 02:39:21.060]  Because it's important that we understand we're doing something epic here
[02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:23.060]  This is epic
[02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:25.060]  And the system knows it's epic
[02:39:25.060 --> 02:39:28.060]  The system knows this broadcast is for real
[02:39:28.060 --> 02:39:31.060]  The system knows I'm for real
[02:39:31.060 --> 02:39:37.060]  The system knows that more people are waking up exponentially
[02:39:37.060 --> 02:39:41.060]  And they're panicking
[02:39:41.060 --> 02:39:43.060]  And they're afraid
[02:39:43.060 --> 02:39:47.060]  Because most of the minions of the system are not completely evil
[02:39:47.060 --> 02:39:49.060]  They're ignorant
[02:39:49.060 --> 02:39:52.060]  They're following peer pressure, they're compartmentalized
[02:39:52.060 --> 02:39:56.060]  And they think they're engaged in the Cyop on us
[02:39:56.060 --> 02:39:59.060]  But in truth, they are in the heart of the Cyop
[02:39:59.060 --> 02:40:06.060]  And no one is as deceived as those that sit at the center of a spiderweb
[02:40:06.060 --> 02:40:11.060]  Of dehumanization and death and think that they're winning
[02:40:11.060 --> 02:40:16.060]  You never win in an offensive war
[02:40:16.060 --> 02:40:24.060]  The type of societal and cultural mode that allows you to offensively go out
[02:40:24.060 --> 02:40:30.060]  And attack and enslave or destroy innocents that did nothing to you
[02:40:30.060 --> 02:40:37.060]  That attitude and that worldview will come back on you
[02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:40.060]  Just like people are like, yeah, kill all the Arabs, take their rights
[02:40:40.060 --> 02:40:44.060]  It was always shut up for the very good old boys that were tribal
[02:40:44.060 --> 02:40:47.060]  And were felt threatened by foreigners
[02:40:47.060 --> 02:40:53.060]  And who the globalists manipulated into going for torture and war and secret arrest
[02:40:53.060 --> 02:40:55.060]  As if that was America
[02:40:55.060 --> 02:41:03.060]  And the whole time, the weapons system, the control grid was being shut up for you
[02:41:03.060 --> 02:41:07.060]  And so many of these people in the system
[02:41:07.060 --> 02:41:11.060]  Even though they have more courage than couch potatoes or welfare people
[02:41:11.060 --> 02:41:17.060]  They still are cowards because they may physically be willing to face a little bit of danger
[02:41:17.060 --> 02:41:22.060]  But it's mainly for their ego and for the power trip
[02:41:22.060 --> 02:41:31.060]  But you're not willing to face peer pressure degradation to gain liberty for yourself and your progeny
[02:41:31.060 --> 02:41:38.060]  That is why you fail and that is why you're not fulfilled and that is why you will be destroyed
[02:41:38.060 --> 02:41:46.060]  If this system is fully birthed, which has now been birthed
[02:41:46.060 --> 02:41:50.060]  And now it's growing and now it's getting up on its legs
[02:41:50.060 --> 02:41:57.060]  If it comes to maturity, what's been built?
[02:41:57.060 --> 02:42:04.060]  There will be no flesh left on this earth. That's the goal
[02:42:04.060 --> 02:42:09.060]  There will be no flesh left. This is an attack on the flesh
[02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:14.060]  The New World Order is a flesh-eating demon
[02:42:14.060 --> 02:42:23.060]  The New World Order is a life-destroying force
[02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:31.060]  This circle of hell is described spiritually as being subzero
[02:42:31.060 --> 02:42:40.060]  It's cold, like the depths of dead space
[02:42:40.060 --> 02:42:44.060]  Or the dead spaces between dimensions
[02:42:44.060 --> 02:42:49.060]  The empty spaces. Death is emptiness
[02:42:49.060 --> 02:42:55.060]  And we face the spirit of emptiness that seeks to empty out this planet
[02:42:55.060 --> 02:43:03.060]  The New World Order who claims that they want to save the earth by getting rid of humanity are the ones actively trying to kill the ocean
[02:43:03.060 --> 02:43:08.060]  Putting genetically modified organisms into it at every level of the food chain
[02:43:08.060 --> 02:43:13.060]  They are actively trying to kill the foliage of the planet
[02:43:13.060 --> 02:43:17.060]  They are actively diseaseing the genetic code of humanity
[02:43:17.060 --> 02:43:21.060]  The DNA is becoming mutated
[02:43:21.060 --> 02:43:25.060]  The sperm counts are down over 87% in the western world
[02:43:25.060 --> 02:43:29.060]  The cancer rates are exploding. Our children are dying and sick all around us
[02:43:29.060 --> 02:43:40.060]  We are a cursed people who march our children up in the morning to the top of the Aztec Temple to have our children gutted in front of us
[02:43:40.060 --> 02:43:46.060]  But we do it slower with a Gardasil shot or a Factor 8 injection
[02:43:46.060 --> 02:43:49.060]  My dad's a dentist
[02:43:49.060 --> 02:43:55.060]  And I was talking about how my grandmother's oldest high school and college friend
[02:43:55.060 --> 02:44:00.060]  Who's a registered nurse, you know, she's retired obviously, my grandmother's almost 90
[02:44:00.060 --> 02:44:04.060]  But both women are still intelligent
[02:44:04.060 --> 02:44:08.060]  Always is pushing for everyone to take vaccines
[02:44:08.060 --> 02:44:11.060]  She totally, you know, was a nurse in World War II
[02:44:11.060 --> 02:44:16.060]  She totally believes in, you know, USA
[02:44:16.060 --> 02:44:20.060]  She mails us little dolls and things with USA shirts on
[02:44:20.060 --> 02:44:28.060]  She mails my kids USA shirts, okay, I mean, this is somebody like, you know, USA, you know, you know
[02:44:28.060 --> 02:44:31.060]  You know, the type of women they shipped over to be in, you know, the tents
[02:44:31.060 --> 02:44:33.060]  Well, people were dropping bombs on them
[02:44:33.060 --> 02:44:35.060]  Just the government's good, I'm USA
[02:44:35.060 --> 02:44:38.060]  And if they say take a vaccine, I'm taking them
[02:44:38.060 --> 02:44:41.060]  And so she took the shingles shot
[02:44:41.060 --> 02:44:43.060]  And it's basically over the last year almost killed her
[02:44:43.060 --> 02:44:49.060]  She's still got shingles
[02:44:49.060 --> 02:44:54.060]  And my dad said, yeah, all the time patients come in hobbling and incredible pain
[02:44:54.060 --> 02:44:56.060]  People I've known for years and I'll say what's wrong
[02:44:56.060 --> 02:44:59.060]  And they'll say, I have shingles
[02:44:59.060 --> 02:45:04.060]  And my dad, after three or four times said, he starts asking them, per se
[02:45:04.060 --> 02:45:08.060]  Did you get this after you took a shingles shot?
[02:45:08.060 --> 02:45:13.060]  And they always go, well, yes, I got it about a week after I took it
[02:45:13.060 --> 02:45:19.060]  Got the shot right up there at Walgreens, next door
[02:45:19.060 --> 02:45:23.060]  My dad looks at him and he goes, did you ever think you got it from that?
[02:45:23.060 --> 02:45:27.060]  And they're like, I don't know, I don't, I mean
[02:45:27.060 --> 02:45:29.060]  It'd be kind of like if you walked down the street and a truck hit you
[02:45:29.060 --> 02:45:32.060]  And it broke ten of your bones and, you know, the ambulance pulls up
[02:45:32.060 --> 02:45:35.060]  Because the truck hit and ran and they go, what hit you?
[02:45:35.060 --> 02:45:38.060]  And you go, I don't know, I mean, I'm in a road
[02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:44.060]  I saw a truck, but, you know, I don't know what hit me, you know
[02:45:44.060 --> 02:45:48.060]  I mean, if you eat a piece of fish and you get food poisoning from it
[02:45:48.060 --> 02:45:51.060]  You go home and you vomit for two days
[02:45:51.060 --> 02:45:55.060]  Gee, you think you might have got it at that restaurant?
[02:45:55.060 --> 02:46:01.060]  Go into the doctor, they say food poisoning?
[02:46:01.060 --> 02:46:06.060]  I mean, this is all just cause and effect here
[02:46:06.060 --> 02:46:09.060]  And we've got all the statistics where the big companies knew that the
[02:46:09.060 --> 02:46:14.060]  Whooping Cough epidemic that they called, it was a few hundred cases in California
[02:46:14.060 --> 02:46:18.060]  Was caused by the vaccine and it turned out they knew it and did it on purpose
[02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:21.060]  And that even came out in the news, but back of the paper
[02:46:21.060 --> 02:46:25.060]  And it should be all over every paper that they're knowingly giving you shots
[02:46:25.060 --> 02:46:30.060]  Giving you the flu, giving you the whooping cough, giving you the measles, mumps, rubella
[02:46:30.060 --> 02:46:35.060]  Giving you everything and it just stacks up and stacks up
[02:46:35.060 --> 02:46:38.060]  I said I'd go to your calls and I got this message to the New World Order
[02:46:38.060 --> 02:46:42.060]  I mean, I guess the whole show is a message to the people running this
[02:46:42.060 --> 02:46:45.060]  And to those of you that are victims
[02:46:45.060 --> 02:46:48.060]  Will you save yourselves? Will you do anything?
[02:46:48.060 --> 02:46:53.060]  Is there anything you're concerned about?
[02:46:53.060 --> 02:46:58.060]  I mean, they know it's a death sentence to all the troops they have used dehumanitions
[02:46:58.060 --> 02:47:02.060]  They know it's a death sentence to give you these vaccines
[02:47:02.060 --> 02:47:07.060]  They know it's a death sentence when they ship out the tons of opium into the United States
[02:47:07.060 --> 02:47:09.060]  The U.S. military brings it directly in now
[02:47:09.060 --> 02:47:12.060]  They just put it on the news like it's no big deal
[02:47:12.060 --> 02:47:17.060]  You understand that we are, we've killed 52 million American babies
[02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:19.060]  And we just say oh, that's just a choice
[02:47:19.060 --> 02:47:23.060]  Oh, come on, come on, don't judge people that had an abortion
[02:47:23.060 --> 02:47:28.060]  A lot of people did it through ignorance just like an Aztec bringing their kid up to be chopped up, you know, thought it was okay to do
[02:47:28.060 --> 02:47:30.060]  But see, it's this peer pressure
[02:47:30.060 --> 02:47:39.060]  You can't just do something because the world and the entity that runs it tells you it's good, tells you it's okay
[02:47:39.060 --> 02:47:43.060]  That's why I saw someone while I was waiting at a restaurant to pick up food someday
[02:47:43.060 --> 02:47:46.060]  Pick up our free magazine
[02:47:46.060 --> 02:47:49.060]  There was a couple copies left there, very excited, all got picked up just a few days
[02:47:49.060 --> 02:47:52.060]  There's almost none left around town
[02:47:52.060 --> 02:48:00.060]  And they picked it up and went oh, Alex Jones, oh, oh, oh, no
[02:48:00.060 --> 02:48:02.060]  And dropped it like it was a snake
[02:48:02.060 --> 02:48:04.060]  And you know what, it is like a big rattlesnake
[02:48:04.060 --> 02:48:07.060]  There's somebody that wants to be destroyed
[02:48:07.060 --> 02:48:11.060]  They see, they see the cure as venom
[02:48:11.060 --> 02:48:16.060]  They don't want to be, I mean it's kind of like in that movie to use an analogy, The Omega Man
[02:48:16.060 --> 02:48:22.060]  Which is a redo of The Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price, great movie
[02:48:22.060 --> 02:48:29.060]  And they've released a bio weapon that kills most people but turns others into these basically undead zombies
[02:48:29.060 --> 02:48:36.060]  And at the end he's like I found the cure, I've given it to myself, here's my blood, you know, I'll cure you
[02:48:36.060 --> 02:48:40.060]  And they said no, and they throw a spear into him and kill him
[02:48:40.060 --> 02:48:44.060]  And they don't want, they want to die of cancer
[02:48:44.060 --> 02:48:48.060]  My dad was talking about a 36 year old office manager
[02:48:48.060 --> 02:48:52.060]  My dad manages a bunch of dental officers who's, you know, attractive, smart
[02:48:52.060 --> 02:48:55.060]  She had brain surgery, trying to get the tumor out
[02:48:55.060 --> 02:48:59.060]  The same tumor killed one of my dad's friends when he was young
[02:48:59.060 --> 02:49:02.060]  And another woman at their office is a brain tumor
[02:49:02.060 --> 02:49:10.060]  And I mean, I've gone, look, look, they talk about statistics where they've gotten better at making you survive a cancer
[02:49:10.060 --> 02:49:14.060]  But they're not discussing the fact that cancers are up depending on the type
[02:49:14.060 --> 02:49:16.060]  Some of them over 10,000 times
[02:49:16.060 --> 02:49:23.060]  I mean, they are killing us and it's all just this normalcy bias of oh, they're having a run for cancer
[02:49:23.060 --> 02:49:30.060]  Like I've got a copy of, it's very offensive, you know, when you see Time Magazine
[02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:33.060]  And it's got ads all through it because that's the new thing
[02:49:33.060 --> 02:49:36.060]  You know, everywhere I go I see these jugs of money at the gas station
[02:49:36.060 --> 02:49:40.060]  Give money to this, you know, 40 year old mother, she's got ovarian cancer
[02:49:40.060 --> 02:49:43.060]  She's got breast cancer, and I put money in it
[02:49:43.060 --> 02:49:47.060]  But no one will even tell them there's charity care that only the illegal aliens get
[02:49:47.060 --> 02:49:50.060]  No one will tell the woman, hey, people in the office didn't believe me
[02:49:50.060 --> 02:49:53.060]  And I've sent them to get, you know, they're supposed to pay for it
[02:49:53.060 --> 02:49:56.060]  Well, the hospitals are charities, they're tax-free, most of them
[02:49:56.060 --> 02:50:00.060]  And I see an ad in here
[02:50:00.060 --> 02:50:04.060]  Stand up, tune in, the fight against cancer continues
[02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:09.060]  And it's all these people about, in memory of, or oh, we're survivors
[02:50:09.060 --> 02:50:13.060]  And it's just so sexy about cancer and we're all going to deal with it together
[02:50:13.060 --> 02:50:16.060]  This is to lead you into the pit so you can be killed
[02:50:16.060 --> 02:50:19.060]  It's all about, oh, let's learn how to cure it
[02:50:19.060 --> 02:50:21.060]  Instead of find out why everybody's getting it
[02:50:21.060 --> 02:50:26.060]  And I'm not saying these stars are bad, but you'll never see anything about why is it increasing
[02:50:26.060 --> 02:50:28.060]  They want to keep that quiet, let me tell you why
[02:50:28.060 --> 02:50:31.060]  I've had the scientists in here, the researchers
[02:50:31.060 --> 02:50:35.060]  Because my dad remembers when he was at UT, they talked about how cancer was viral
[02:50:35.060 --> 02:50:37.060]  And it had been discovered in the 30s
[02:50:37.060 --> 02:50:39.060]  They put it in your shots
[02:50:39.060 --> 02:50:42.060]  That's my message, this thing's killing everybody
[02:50:42.060 --> 02:50:45.060]  We're run by eugenics, psychopaths
[02:50:45.060 --> 02:50:47.060]  And we better turn it around
[02:50:47.060 --> 02:50:51.060]  And they're putting a police state in place to forcibly inject us
[02:50:51.060 --> 02:50:53.060]  And they're already doing it illegally with school kids
[02:50:53.060 --> 02:50:56.060]  The government is already lawless, okay?
[02:50:56.060 --> 02:51:01.060]  And it wants to kill you, I mean, that's the message, it wants you dead
[02:51:26.060 --> 02:51:31.060]  You've got to life straw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go

[02:54:33.060 --> 02:54:34.060]  I just can't do justice to it
[02:54:34.060 --> 02:54:37.060]  I'll have to do it when I only know Senator Marr on the radio
[02:54:37.060 --> 02:54:40.060]  Scientists successfully hack brain to obtain private data
[02:54:40.060 --> 02:54:45.060]  Cyborg tissue is half living cells, half electrons
[02:54:45.060 --> 02:54:48.060]  And again this is all going to be used against us
[02:54:48.060 --> 02:54:51.060]  All this technology is having backdoors built into it the globalist admit
[02:54:51.060 --> 02:54:53.060]  Nothing is given to us that's any good
[02:54:53.060 --> 02:54:56.060]  Anything they give us is going to have microwaves coming out of it to kill us
[02:54:56.060 --> 02:54:58.060]  Or to be tracking us
[02:54:58.060 --> 02:55:01.060]  It's all done to enslave us
[02:55:01.060 --> 02:55:03.060]  So horrible
[02:55:03.060 --> 02:55:05.060]  Let's go to Charles and Louisiana
[02:55:05.060 --> 02:55:09.060]  You're getting ready to get hit by another hurricane my friend
[02:55:09.060 --> 02:55:12.060]  Do you think they're going to come for your guns again?
[02:55:12.060 --> 02:55:13.060]  News for you
[02:55:13.060 --> 02:55:17.060]  Two days I've been on the phone two days
[02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:22.060]  But anyway they said they're not going to use the dome stadium as a FEMA camp this time
[02:55:22.060 --> 02:55:25.060]  They're going to bring you someplace else
[02:55:25.060 --> 02:55:28.060]  They already got military on the street
[02:55:28.060 --> 02:55:31.060]  They're already talking about salt water is going to be in the water
[02:55:31.060 --> 02:55:34.060]  This thing here they're so happy this happened Alex
[02:55:34.060 --> 02:55:37.060]  They are thrilled to death that this happened
[02:55:37.060 --> 02:55:40.060]  Well they love the excuse to take over
[02:55:40.060 --> 02:55:44.060]  Well yeah well they say the levities didn't fix all the pumps like they told us to
[02:55:44.060 --> 02:55:48.060]  $5 million missing they gave them $15 million
[02:55:48.060 --> 02:55:51.060]  No they only used what 60% of the money for levies
[02:55:51.060 --> 02:55:54.060]  But hey you know what government needs to steal it they're good people
[02:55:54.060 --> 02:55:59.060]  The levies probably ain't going to hold it go underneath from the news here
[02:55:59.060 --> 02:56:02.060]  But they let them know they're going to bring them someplace else
[02:56:02.060 --> 02:56:05.060]  They bring them to the dome stadium where they can see the women get raped
[02:56:05.060 --> 02:56:06.060]  No no no
[02:56:06.060 --> 02:56:10.060]  Where are they bringing them to be raped this time while the military is busy confiscating all the guns
[02:56:10.060 --> 02:56:14.060]  And the police wouldn't help anybody inside the dome stadium and just sat there laughing
[02:56:14.060 --> 02:56:17.060]  Or busy robbing the different stores
[02:56:17.060 --> 02:56:22.060]  Where are they going to take the slaves this time that they shoot if they try to walk out on the highways
[02:56:22.060 --> 02:56:23.060]  They won't tell us
[02:56:23.060 --> 02:56:26.060]  Oh that's even better that's a big news item
[02:56:26.060 --> 02:56:29.060]  You know Charles you reported for us then I'm going to have to get your number
[02:56:29.060 --> 02:56:32.060]  I had it years ago but I want to get a report from you
[02:56:32.060 --> 02:56:36.060]  Get you on the phone with Curt and Emma or Don Salazar
[02:56:36.060 --> 02:56:41.060]  So you can tell them what's going on as our reporter and full name and all that
[02:56:41.060 --> 02:56:46.060]  Because I can I mean you were the first to tell us they've been shooting people trying to walk out on the bridges
[02:56:46.060 --> 02:56:49.060]  Because you were there when it was happening as one of the emergency people
[02:56:49.060 --> 02:56:53.060]  You're saying FEMA says we're going to take you somewhere secret that sounds good
[02:56:53.060 --> 02:57:01.060]  They didn't say FEMA they said the governor of New Orleans said they ain't going to use the dome stadium no more
[02:57:01.060 --> 02:57:04.060]  They're going to go somewhere they're going to find some other place
[02:57:04.060 --> 02:57:06.060]  He got on the news and said this
[02:57:06.060 --> 02:57:11.060]  Well listen I'm going to put you on hold I had it years ago but I'm going to get your number
[02:57:11.060 --> 02:57:15.060]  Full name and number so we can have one of my reporters call you

[02:59:55.060 --> 02:59:59.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[02:59:59.060 --> 03:00:05.060]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation
[03:00:05.060 --> 03:00:10.060]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[03:00:10.060 --> 03:00:18.060]  We should pray for everyone in New Orleans and surrounding areas with the hurricane coming
[03:00:18.060 --> 03:00:22.060]  Not so much with the hurricane but the military and police will be
[03:00:22.060 --> 03:00:27.060]  If it's bad we'll be robbing everything and taking guns and raping women and killing people
[03:00:27.060 --> 03:00:29.060]  Who try to walk out with their families
[03:00:29.060 --> 03:00:32.060]  So get ready for government to absolutely have a heyday with you
[03:00:32.060 --> 03:00:35.060]  Because they're so ready to attack you
[03:00:35.060 --> 03:00:37.060]  The military will try to save people most of them
[03:00:37.060 --> 03:00:42.060]  But the special brand of police they have there in New Orleans will certainly be enjoying themselves
[03:00:42.060 --> 03:00:45.060]  The military will be getting the guns, that's how they help you
[03:00:45.060 --> 03:00:50.060]  Okay, let's go to callers that have been holding Judy in Florida than Daniel and Kathy
[03:00:50.060 --> 03:00:56.060]  Judy, welcome to the airwaves, what's your take on all the happy news we've been covering?
[03:00:56.060 --> 03:00:59.060]  Well, Alex, thanks for talking with me
[03:00:59.060 --> 03:01:04.060]  I've been thinking a lot about what you and Alfredo Desk were talking about over the weekend
[03:01:04.060 --> 03:01:09.060]  I mean, just because I was having such a lovely time with normal, healthy people
[03:01:09.060 --> 03:01:13.060]  And I was thinking about, heck, we are human beings
[03:01:13.060 --> 03:01:20.060]  And that's something that I don't think people think on a conscious level that that's what they are
[03:01:20.060 --> 03:01:29.060]  And that they really are being manipulated and being just broken as far as, you know, what the globalists are trying to do to us
[03:01:29.060 --> 03:01:33.060]  And the Stockholm syndrome that they seem to be locked in
[03:01:33.060 --> 03:01:39.060]  I don't know how you break through having people, you know, I don't know why
[03:01:39.060 --> 03:01:41.060]  They trust government still, I don't know why
[03:01:41.060 --> 03:01:45.060]  Well, look, victims, I mean, these people take shots and get sick right after it
[03:01:45.060 --> 03:01:49.060]  Their kid has a convulsion at the doctor five minutes after the shot
[03:01:49.060 --> 03:01:52.060]  And then they never figure out it was the shot
[03:01:52.060 --> 03:01:54.060]  I mean, they want to be destroyed
[03:01:54.060 --> 03:01:58.060]  And the globalists argue that's the survival of the fittest social Darwinism
[03:01:58.060 --> 03:02:01.060]  That if you can't figure it out, they deserve to kill you
[03:02:01.060 --> 03:02:03.060]  And so they just love it
[03:02:03.060 --> 03:02:07.060]  It's too scary to admit that there's criminals over them
[03:02:07.060 --> 03:02:10.060]  So they will do anything because they're delusional
[03:02:10.060 --> 03:02:13.060]  And they're just sad victims in a trance
[03:02:13.060 --> 03:02:16.060]  And we've got to pray for them and try to help them
[03:02:16.060 --> 03:02:21.060]  But even those I know that I've tried to speak up to doctors because I've had a couple of friends
[03:02:21.060 --> 03:02:25.060]  One particularly at which went to the, you know, doctor, she got a flu shot
[03:02:25.060 --> 03:02:28.060]  She was debilitated within hours
[03:02:28.060 --> 03:02:31.060]  Her arm was swelling, she could not move her arm
[03:02:31.060 --> 03:02:34.060]  I mean, you know, this happened to another person also
[03:02:34.060 --> 03:02:39.060]  And she, you know, completely changed as far as her ability to move around after that
[03:02:39.060 --> 03:02:42.060]  No, but she likes that though, that's the fun part
[03:02:42.060 --> 03:02:46.060]  I mean, it was like a, people get excited like, I'm going to the doctor and it's like a little treat
[03:02:46.060 --> 03:02:48.060]  And they get sick and die
[03:02:48.060 --> 03:02:51.060]  It's like, oh, my husband went in for minor surgery, he's dead
[03:02:51.060 --> 03:02:54.060]  But it's, oh, it's cute though
[03:02:54.060 --> 03:02:56.060]  You understand, it's a sacrament
[03:02:56.060 --> 03:03:00.060]  It's a sacrifice to have government hurt them, they like it, I appreciate your call
[03:03:00.060 --> 03:03:03.060]  And so government's going to give them what they beg for
[03:03:03.060 --> 03:03:06.060]  Kathy in New Orleans, you're on the air, go ahead
[03:03:06.060 --> 03:03:08.060]  Hi, how are you, Alex?
[03:03:08.060 --> 03:03:10.060]  Go ahead, tell us what's happening there
[03:03:10.060 --> 03:03:13.060]  Okay, well, let me just say this, yesterday I was in Tampa
[03:03:13.060 --> 03:03:15.060]  For the Republican National Convention
[03:03:15.060 --> 03:03:20.060]  Where all of our duly, almost all of our duly elected delegates were disenfranchised
[03:03:20.060 --> 03:03:26.060]  So we got our group, drove back to New Orleans to bunker down for the storm
[03:03:26.060 --> 03:03:29.060]  It hasn't hit yet, we're waiting to see what's going on
[03:03:29.060 --> 03:03:36.060]  We are very familiar with the police state, we actually did our whole info, reporter contest on that
[03:03:36.060 --> 03:03:38.060]  However, it was never shown
[03:03:38.060 --> 03:03:44.060]  But anyway, I just wanted to say we went to see Dr. Paul's last speech
[03:03:44.060 --> 03:03:48.060]  And it was fabulous, they had over 10,000 people in the audience
[03:03:48.060 --> 03:03:54.060]  It's really, really sad what's going down there, people have stayed even with their houses in danger
[03:03:54.060 --> 03:03:56.060]  And they're just not listening to them
[03:03:56.060 --> 03:03:58.060]  But I do want to say some good news
[03:03:58.060 --> 03:04:04.060]  You know, we have a radio talk show in New Orleans and we've always listened to you
[03:04:04.060 --> 03:04:08.060]  Gary King, who is one of the delegates that was disenfranchised
[03:04:08.060 --> 03:04:16.060]  He is running for a congressional race in two months against a very popular incombinant
[03:04:16.060 --> 03:04:21.060]  Who has voted against everything that Ron Paul stands for
[03:04:21.060 --> 03:04:23.060]  Well, we're out of time, you've got to send me some info on that
[03:04:23.060 --> 03:04:26.060]  I've got to jump, but stay in touch as the hurricane hits
[03:04:26.060 --> 03:04:30.060]  And look out for government coming to take your guns and your property
[03:04:30.060 --> 03:04:32.060]  And to rob the Walmarts and everything else
[03:04:32.060 --> 03:04:34.060]  And to shoot everybody in New York
[03:04:34.060 --> 03:04:39.060]  But citizens, when they take on criminals, don't ever shoot anybody that I haven't seen lately
[03:04:39.060 --> 03:04:41.060]  Citizens, total precision shooting crooks
[03:04:41.060 --> 03:04:43.060]  Police, shoot nine people
[03:04:43.060 --> 03:04:45.060]  Doesn't matter, they're the police
[03:04:45.060 --> 03:04:49.060]  Take vaccines, drink fluoride water, GMO, mass cancer deaths
[03:04:49.060 --> 03:04:52.060]  Thank you for the blessings government, thank you, oh you love us
[03:04:52.060 --> 03:04:54.060]  I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I love the world government
[03:04:54.060 --> 03:04:57.060]  I love them, I trust them, I trust Big Pharma
[03:04:57.060 --> 03:05:02.060]  Others are loving, others so good
