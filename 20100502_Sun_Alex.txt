[00:00.000 --> 00:09.040]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:09.040 --> 00:14.560]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14.560 --> 00:18.720]  We're live my friends, thank you for tuning in on this Sunday edition.
[00:18.720 --> 00:23.840]  The second day of May 2010, we're going to be live here for the next two hours, of course
[00:23.840 --> 00:32.000]  we're also live Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern, back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m. Central
[00:32.000 --> 00:38.640]  or 5 to 7 p.m. Eastern. Again, thank you for joining us. The news websites are infowars.com
[00:38.640 --> 00:44.800]  and prisonplanet.com and we also have folks watching the slash radio show, TV show at
[00:44.800 --> 00:52.960]  prisonplanet.tv. Obama has given two speeches in the last few days, one at a commencement
[00:52.960 --> 01:01.440]  and another at a correspondence dinner, making fun of anti-government people and spending that
[01:01.440 --> 01:07.680]  saying that the government is the people, so no matter what they do, it's the people that are
[01:07.680 --> 01:14.960]  doing it. No, that's not the case. We're going to break that down today. Also, he's making fun of
[01:14.960 --> 01:21.360]  Berthers and the fact that he will not release his full birth certificate. Hey, forget the
[01:21.360 --> 01:28.080]  birth certificate. We know he gave up his U.S. citizenship when he was in Indonesia. We know
[01:28.080 --> 01:31.840]  his real name is Barry Sataro, so we're going to be talking about that. Also, the National
[01:31.840 --> 01:37.680]  Enquirer, which is right about John Edwards and many others. In fact, they've got a better track
[01:37.680 --> 01:44.480]  record than CNN or Fox. They're saying Obama's been out cheating on his wife. That's a political
[01:44.480 --> 01:49.280]  distraction to a certain point. It may be coming out because so many reports are servicing about
[01:49.280 --> 01:57.440]  his bisexuality, so they may be trying to bolster his heterosexual image. But Obama cheating scandal,
[01:57.440 --> 02:04.560]  shocking new reports, the Enquirer says this is confirmed and they have got their spies on the
[02:04.560 --> 02:10.640]  case. And when it comes to cheating, my politicians, I've never seen them be wrong. Of course, the
[02:10.640 --> 02:16.640]  Enquirers, the company that owns the Enquirer, got weaponized U.S. government anthrax mailed to them
[02:16.640 --> 02:22.880]  when they showed photos of the Bush daughters falling down, stinking, drunk. So we'll see what
[02:22.880 --> 02:28.720]  unfolds with the National Enquirer and their parent company, American Media, on that front.
[02:28.720 --> 02:33.280]  The situation in Greece is going exactly like Bob Chapman and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and other
[02:33.280 --> 02:40.720]  economists that we have on predicted. And they're saying that this will be a second round of bailouts
[02:40.720 --> 02:48.160]  that will now be needed to the private offshore banks. Greece erupts as men from IMF prepare
[02:48.160 --> 02:55.600]  to wield acts. And I was actually listening to CNN on XM radio on the way in to the station.
[02:56.320 --> 03:03.280]  And they had different bank chiefs on saying, yes, we've got to take the pension funds of
[03:03.280 --> 03:07.120]  the Greek people. And they've got to be reasonable and give us their pension funds.
[03:07.120 --> 03:14.240]  As if it's the people's pension funds that caused the economic collapse when Goldman
[03:14.240 --> 03:22.240]  Sachs again piloted and ran the entire operation. And obviously, we're going to talk about the
[03:22.240 --> 03:28.960]  Dodd bomb in New York City in Times Square. When we come back, we'll get into the latest
[03:28.960 --> 03:36.000]  developments with Obama dispatching SWAT teams to the oil rigs and a lot more today.
[03:36.000 --> 03:43.760]  And we'll also open the phones up. And then I've got another report here that I covered it briefly
[03:43.760 --> 03:52.720]  on Friday, but I want to spend some more time on it today. And that is Fox News whitewashing
[03:52.720 --> 04:00.240]  the fact that our government is growing and producing the opium inside Afghanistan and record
[04:00.240 --> 04:06.880]  levels of the opium that is produced and other opiates like heroin are flooding out into the
[04:06.880 --> 04:12.000]  world. And they just admit, well, we've got to grow the opium and protect the people growing
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.960]  in there. Al Qaeda will get America. Well, if you wanted to get Al Qaeda that's growing the opium,
[04:18.960 --> 04:23.520]  if you believe that fairytale, you would decriminalize it and the price would go down
[04:23.520 --> 04:29.680]  by close to 99%. And then you wouldn't be able to finance terrorism with it. But we know the real
[04:29.680 --> 04:35.760]  terrorist financers are. And so we're going to break this down on the other side. When you
[04:35.760 --> 04:40.560]  make something illegal, it creates a very lucrative black market in it, especially when it's addictive.
[04:40.560 --> 04:48.080]  So a incredibly full plate in front of us today will attempt to cover it all. I'm Alex Jones.
[04:48.080 --> 04:54.880]  This is the one of the only GCN radio network, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[04:54.880 --> 05:02.400]  We appreciate you joining us today. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite
[05:02.400 --> 05:07.200]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that
[05:07.200 --> 05:11.920]  in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true,
[05:11.920 --> 05:16.000]  seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country. And it's possible that could even
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.800]  happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of
[05:20.800 --> 05:27.440]  non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[05:27.440 --> 05:31.920]  dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically
[05:31.920 --> 05:37.680]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit
[05:37.680 --> 05:47.120]  them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[05:47.120 --> 05:56.160]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[05:56.160 --> 05:58.720]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[06:05.280 --> 06:12.560]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[06:12.560 --> 06:21.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[06:24.480 --> 06:31.840]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen. It is Sunday, the second day of May 2010. Yesterday was May 1st.
[06:32.800 --> 06:39.440]  May 1st. That's the Communist World Government Day, where they call for Communist Revolution.
[06:39.440 --> 06:44.720]  But when I was driving in, I was flipping around on talk radio on both AMFM, XM,
[06:45.600 --> 06:51.280]  and I heard several different reports talking about May Day rallies by the illegal aliens and
[06:51.280 --> 06:59.360]  May Day rallies by anarchists. Nothing about May Day and Communist. May Day is the International
[06:59.360 --> 07:08.080]  Workers' Communist Day. And I find it very suspicious that this dud bomb in Times Square
[07:08.080 --> 07:15.760]  in the middle of New York City last night happened on May Day. But I listened to the entire, from
[07:15.760 --> 07:21.680]  home, the entire press conference with the police commissioner and the police chief,
[07:22.560 --> 07:30.160]  nothing about May Day, nothing about Communist, nothing about the fact that this happened on May
[07:30.160 --> 07:38.160]  1st, nothing about illegal aliens rioting in Arizona for a week straight, nothing about the
[07:38.160 --> 07:43.200]  San Francisco Chronicle reporting that illegal aliens are beating up citizens that dare come
[07:43.200 --> 07:49.280]  out and demonstrate for securing our borders, nothing about that. Now, I'm not saying that an
[07:49.280 --> 07:57.040]  illegal alien group with a stolen car created this moron bomb with firecrackers and things.
[07:57.040 --> 08:01.920]  This could be a staged event, it could be a schizophrenic, it could be a fruit loop. I don't
[08:01.920 --> 08:08.080]  know. Again, I'm not somebody that gets up here on air and says, I know what happened 24 hours
[08:08.080 --> 08:14.480]  into something unless I have bona fide evidence. Just like for a week back after Christmas, I said,
[08:14.480 --> 08:19.520]  I don't know if the underwear bombing is real. I don't know whether this is a real terrorist that
[08:19.520 --> 08:25.200]  does exist. And then I found out that witnesses on the plane saw the US government get the
[08:25.200 --> 08:29.760]  underwear bomber on the plane and argued that it didn't even have a passport or visa and they got
[08:29.760 --> 08:34.560]  him on and that it was all part of a government drill. And that came out later in a few major
[08:34.560 --> 08:39.520]  newspapers but ever became a big national story. And that was as staged as it gets. That was as
[08:39.520 --> 08:45.680]  staged as a WWF wrestling match to sell the naked body scanners and the expansion of the TSA on the
[08:45.680 --> 08:53.680]  streets of America. I don't know what's going on with this situation in Times Square. But the
[08:53.680 --> 09:01.200]  day before that in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a bomb went off at the end of a marathon, a race.
[09:02.320 --> 09:09.120]  Somebody else on Thursday, the New York Times is reporting, got caught in New York City in the
[09:09.120 --> 09:16.480]  uniform and hard hat of a train worker, of a subway worker with a huge can of cyanide. The
[09:16.480 --> 09:22.080]  police confirm it's cyanide. But then they said, oh, don't worry. He was just somebody wanting to
[09:22.080 --> 09:28.800]  commit suicide with road flares and other devices and a can full of weapons-grade cyanide, which
[09:28.800 --> 09:34.720]  you just don't find without help. That, see, when there's a real terror attack being prepared, it
[09:34.720 --> 09:41.120]  gets covered up from experience and research. When it's a fake terror attack, they hype it.
[09:42.720 --> 09:51.440]  So a lot of crazy stuff going on. And if you ask me, it's 50-50 that government staged this as a
[09:51.440 --> 09:55.840]  pretext to get more funding. That's normally what happens. Not even plus percent of the time, that's
[09:55.840 --> 10:02.960]  the case. But this doesn't have those earmarks. It's 50-50. I'm undecided. Or it's a communist group
[10:02.960 --> 10:08.640]  of illegal alien supporters or illegal aliens. I mean, imagine all over the United States,
[10:08.640 --> 10:14.080]  we've got illegal aliens protesting in our country and telling us what to do and attacking police
[10:14.080 --> 10:18.960]  in Phoenix, beating people up in San Francisco. And when that happens, the police just let them
[10:18.960 --> 10:22.640]  hit them in the head with bottles. They let them attack them. But when citizens try to peacefully
[10:22.640 --> 10:28.080]  protest the G-20 and the private banking takeover, they get attacked by police dogs. They get beat
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.880]  up and the media says, good job, police. But the police are scared to defend themselves
[10:32.880 --> 10:38.000]  when illegal aliens are attacking them. You've got to ask yourself, why is that the case? Why are
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.680]  citizens treated like absolute trash and why are the illegals left alone? Well, because the big central
[10:43.680 --> 10:49.440]  banks that gave you NAFTA and GAF that have deindustrialized this nation, they have a policy
[10:49.440 --> 10:54.960]  of getting rid of our borders as part of the North American Union. And that is on record.
[10:55.680 --> 11:02.880]  I will say this, though, because some of the supposed fertilizer mixed in with this ridiculous
[11:02.880 --> 11:08.800]  bomb that had firecrackers in it and other things. And the police have now released photos of the
[11:08.800 --> 11:18.240]  haphazard, wily coyote bomb. I mean, it looks like a ball of spaghetti or something that,
[11:18.240 --> 11:23.920]  by the way, started smoking and didn't detonate. Kind of like the underwear bomber in that staged
[11:23.920 --> 11:30.560]  event. I was listening to the press conference, and again, this just ended about an hour ago.
[11:30.560 --> 11:35.360]  You can go pull it up if you want. It went on for a long time with a commissioner and then you had
[11:35.360 --> 11:45.200]  the police chief in New York, and they were saying that they didn't know if Al Qaeda was involved or
[11:45.200 --> 11:50.960]  the Taliban was involved, even though Pakistan Taliban claims responsibility for Times Square
[11:50.960 --> 11:59.520]  bombing. That is the headline on Fox News and many other online publications out there.
[11:59.520 --> 12:05.200]  Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility, report claims, Times Square bomb plot, revenge,
[12:05.200 --> 12:10.080]  grip says. Now, the New York police commissioner says there's no evidence of a Taliban link
[12:10.080 --> 12:14.640]  to the failed bomb found in an SUV parked in Times Square, but said he couldn't rule them out.
[12:15.440 --> 12:20.320]  And then you read the source of this. It's a message board. Remember two weeks ago,
[12:20.320 --> 12:25.440]  Fox News, AP headline, I mean, they all were on the same headline. Osama bin Laden has a Facebook
[12:25.440 --> 12:32.560]  account, and then it said or someone posing as him. Elvis has got a few thousand Facebook accounts.
[12:32.560 --> 12:40.000]  I've looked it up. Elvis is dead, by the way. He died in the late 70s. John Wayne's got Facebook
[12:40.000 --> 12:45.680]  accounts, but John Wayne's dead. I'll assure you. There are thousands of Facebook accounts
[12:45.680 --> 12:50.480]  of Alex Jones. Only a couple of them are actually mine. People have a lot of fun with those, by the
[12:50.480 --> 12:55.840]  way. They start a Facebook and then say horrible things in my name. But it did turn out a few
[12:55.840 --> 13:02.320]  days later that this was not Osama bin Laden's Facebook. So many times on a message board or an
[13:02.320 --> 13:08.960]  audio tape and then linguists listen to it, it's not Osama bin Laden. They make these claims.
[13:09.520 --> 13:14.160]  Remember a few years ago, some college student in San Francisco did a fake beheading and for
[13:14.160 --> 13:21.600]  two weeks, it was on the news, it was a real beheading. The point is that the Taliban taking
[13:21.600 --> 13:30.240]  credit for this or al-Qaeda, Al-CIA, set up by the CIA, if they set a bomb off, folks, it's going
[13:30.240 --> 13:36.320]  to detonate. It's going to be destructive. Okay. I mean, there are some real terrorist elements
[13:36.320 --> 13:41.280]  out there, but to simplify it, the media just calls it Taliban al-Qaeda. And some of its government,
[13:41.280 --> 13:45.920]  some of its provocateur, some of its real. I mean, there are Muslim extremists that exist out there.
[13:46.640 --> 13:52.160]  That's clearly evident from the information that we've researched over the years. But
[13:53.440 --> 13:58.720]  as I was listening to the press conference, I knew it was coming, because there was all this talk
[13:58.720 --> 14:07.440]  about propane. You can pull up to Safeway or HEB or Target or gas stations and buy a tank of Rhino
[14:07.440 --> 14:13.520]  gas, I know, because I barbecue occasionally when I have time. I knew it was coming and it did happen.
[14:14.080 --> 14:20.880]  They're now calling for registering propane. And of course, there was also gasoline, so they're
[14:20.880 --> 14:25.200]  calling for registering gasoline. You've got to have a special license and sign paperwork to pump
[14:25.200 --> 14:30.480]  your car full of gas. I'm not joking. And of course, they want to ban firecrackers now because
[14:30.480 --> 14:35.920]  somebody might use them in a terror attack. Well, this is the same lunacy where people call for
[14:35.920 --> 14:41.920]  banning guns because someone might use a gun and a crime. It's the criminal's fault. I mean,
[14:41.920 --> 14:47.440]  are you going to ban cars? Every year in this country, I see press reports. Every week or two,
[14:47.440 --> 14:53.600]  I see articles out of India, Spain, Russia, where some crazy person runs over a crowd of people,
[14:53.600 --> 14:58.800]  killing and wounding people with an automobile. I mean, how do you, I guess you ban automobiles.
[14:58.800 --> 15:05.440]  You ban gasoline. You ban propane. They were obsessing over that some of this
[15:05.440 --> 15:12.800]  explosives material was packed inside a gun case. And the reporters were getting all excited about
[15:12.800 --> 15:19.760]  that and twittering about it and getting all, oh my gosh, since when has the land of the free
[15:19.760 --> 15:25.680]  home of the brave been scared to death of people bombing us since the media hyped it and the police
[15:25.680 --> 15:30.800]  hyped it as a pretext to control and run our lives and have laptops watching kids at home,
[15:30.800 --> 15:35.040]  you know, the school watching parents at home and having the public train to spy on their
[15:35.040 --> 15:40.320]  neighbors and everyone in this, oh, we've got to go attack a couple more nations or people might
[15:40.320 --> 15:45.360]  bomb us. You got a better chance of being struck by lightning, of drowning. You've got thousands
[15:45.360 --> 15:50.800]  of better chance of dying of cancer, dying in a car wreck. Stop being afraid of terrorism.
[15:50.800 --> 15:57.440]  It's a buggy man. It is a projected hoax and you can't ban the propane tanks and that won't keep
[15:57.440 --> 16:05.520]  you safe, okay? They helped to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order,
[16:05.520 --> 16:11.360]  a new world order based upon collective action. Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the
[16:11.360 --> 16:16.640]  globalist through their own words and documents. The new world order really is a tool for addressing
[16:16.640 --> 16:21.920]  a new world of possibilities. It means all the world under their control. The United Nations
[16:21.920 --> 16:28.320]  would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire chronicles
[16:28.320 --> 16:33.360]  how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[16:33.360 --> 16:38.400]  world government. I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution
[16:38.400 --> 16:43.040]  for the global financial system. Global governance with the establishment of the G20. So it's going
[16:43.040 --> 16:48.720]  to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I've got news for you. You're everyone else.

[18:01.040 --> 18:05.600]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[18:05.600 --> 18:09.440]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[18:09.440 --> 18:14.800]  My answer would be all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[18:14.800 --> 18:20.080]  food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle
[18:20.080 --> 18:24.800]  starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any
[18:24.800 --> 18:29.520]  food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will
[18:29.520 --> 18:34.400]  you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a
[18:34.400 --> 18:40.240]  good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you
[18:40.240 --> 18:45.600]  need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you
[18:45.600 --> 18:53.680]  good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at
[18:53.680 --> 19:04.000]  eFoodsDirect.com. Again that number 1-800-409-5633. With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius,
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.320]  it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health
[19:08.320 --> 19:14.480]  preferences are concerned. As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the
[19:14.480 --> 19:20.080]  European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal
[19:20.080 --> 19:25.440]  silver. We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves
[19:25.440 --> 19:30.080]  and our families. Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the
[19:30.080 --> 19:35.600]  privacy of your own home. Colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200
[19:35.600 --> 19:40.720]  years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[19:40.720 --> 19:48.480]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing
[19:48.480 --> 19:53.840]  your own colloidal silver right from home. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[20:18.960 --> 20:27.440]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded. Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[20:28.160 --> 20:36.240]  Everybody knows the war is over. Everybody knows the good guys lie.
[20:36.240 --> 20:41.520]  The good guys are down, but they're not out, ladies and gentlemen. And what I've learned after years
[20:41.520 --> 20:51.360]  and years of research is that you can't believe a word the government tells you about any event.
[20:51.360 --> 20:55.840]  And more often than not, the government has staged it or allowed it to happen.
[20:57.200 --> 21:03.120]  But I don't know what has happened in New York. I just know that in the press conferences I've
[21:03.120 --> 21:08.240]  heard with the commissioner and the police chief and others, the media is there calling
[21:08.240 --> 21:16.080]  for restricting and registering whoever rents propane cans. So now you'll go to jail
[21:17.920 --> 21:22.640]  if you don't register your propane and butane if they, I guess Hank Hill's going to prison,
[21:23.200 --> 21:29.520]  the fellow from King of the Hill. I mean, it's over for him. And they're calling for banning
[21:30.080 --> 21:33.760]  or restricting fireworks, which many states have already banned or restricted down to the
[21:33.760 --> 21:38.480]  point where you can't even get them because somebody might use some fireworks. Oh, and I forgot.
[21:38.480 --> 21:47.440]  Gasoline. Gasoline is evil now. We got 310 million people in this country. There's 6.8
[21:47.440 --> 21:53.040]  billion people worldwide. Are we all going to be prisoners because somebody might pick up a baseball
[21:53.040 --> 21:58.160]  bat and beat somebody's brains out? Somebody might run over a crowd of people for no reason
[21:58.160 --> 22:05.840]  at some public event. Somebody might shoot someone. Somebody might detonate some gasoline
[22:05.840 --> 22:13.440]  canisters. It goes on and on and on. Somebody does something illegal with something. So everyone
[22:13.440 --> 22:17.360]  else has to lose their freedom because we've been trained that, oh, we've got to be safe.
[22:17.920 --> 22:23.760]  And only the government can keep us safe. The government can't keep you safe. All it can do
[22:23.760 --> 22:32.080]  is write the living daylights out of you. And coming up, Obama takes digs at Berthers and GOP
[22:32.080 --> 22:36.240]  at the Correspondents' Dinner. We'll be playing clips without the next hour. And at a commencement
[22:36.240 --> 22:43.840]  speech, Obama takes direct aim at anti-government rhetoric and says that the government is the
[22:43.840 --> 22:48.560]  people. Well, not when the government violates the Bill of Rights and Constitution. He said,
[22:48.560 --> 22:53.600]  what troubles me is when I hear people say that all government is inherently bad, said Obama, who
[22:53.600 --> 23:02.560]  received an honorary degree of law. When our government is spoken of as menacing, threatening
[23:02.560 --> 23:09.040]  foreign entity, it ignores the fact that it's our democracy, that government is us. Well, number one,
[23:09.040 --> 23:20.320]  Obama or Barry Sitaro, your real name from Indonesia, the republic states that if 51% vote to enslave
[23:20.320 --> 23:24.960]  49%, that doesn't happen. As Thomas Jefferson said, what's democracy? Two wolves in a sheet
[23:24.960 --> 23:31.600]  voting on what's for dinner. We're a republic, Barry Sitaro, a.k.a. Barack Obama. And you know
[23:31.600 --> 23:37.520]  that. So that is coming up. We'll explain the difference between a democracy and a republic
[23:37.520 --> 23:43.520]  in the next hour and play those clips. And I will get into Greece erupts as men from IMF
[23:43.520 --> 23:50.960]  prepared to wield acts. And what are they announcing? Everybody's got to give their pension funds to
[23:50.960 --> 23:58.880]  the bankers. And I've got Bloomberg and others reporting. They're preparing to take your pension
[23:58.880 --> 24:04.960]  funds to give to the private banks for bonuses. That's supposedly getting your financial house
[24:04.960 --> 24:10.320]  in order when the Goldman Sachs emails that we told you about a year and a half ago now have
[24:10.320 --> 24:16.160]  made mainstream news where they premeditatedly set up what is currently happening. The banks
[24:16.960 --> 24:22.400]  get countries in debt. It's all fiat. It's manufactured. They're on the hook for it.
[24:22.400 --> 24:31.840]  Then they take over society. So that is coming up as well. But getting back to all the strange
[24:31.840 --> 24:39.840]  goings on. I'm going to talk more about the mystery, the who done it, who is behind the
[24:42.320 --> 24:49.840]  haphazard clown bomb that detonated as a flash of smoke, no fire, none of the
[24:51.760 --> 24:58.960]  crock pots or alarm clocks or firecrackers ignited the gasoline and propane. But again,
[24:58.960 --> 25:03.280]  if we ban gasoline and propane, we're going to be safe. Everything's fine.
[25:06.080 --> 25:13.200]  In other strange goings on, last Thursday, Obama said he was, or Barry Sotaro, excuse me,
[25:13.200 --> 25:20.880]  that he was dispatching SWAT teams to quote all oil rigs. And so I went ahead and looked it up
[25:20.880 --> 25:26.640]  over the weekend. There are 3,000 plus off the coast of Louisiana. And there are over 9,000 rigs
[25:26.640 --> 25:34.800]  in the Gulf of Mexico that are in U.S. territorial waters or in their jurisdiction. They claim an
[25:34.800 --> 25:43.040]  area even further out. So the magical, I guess kind of like magic elves or magic
[25:45.120 --> 25:51.920]  leprechaun SWAT teams are going to go to these 9,000 plus oil rigs or 3,000, which is off the
[25:51.920 --> 25:57.040]  coast of Louisiana. And they're going to make sure everything's okay. I mean, even if the government
[25:57.040 --> 26:00.880]  thinks there may have been a terror attack a week and a half ago against this British petroleum
[26:01.680 --> 26:06.960]  drilling platform now pumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude oil into the
[26:07.840 --> 26:17.840]  Gulf, even if there is a terror threat, why wouldn't you send FBI out to investigate this
[26:17.840 --> 26:24.880]  particular rig for foul play? No, no, no, no. He is dispatching them everywhere. And Mark Levin,
[26:24.880 --> 26:32.560]  a former Reagan advisor to the cabinet, is concurring with my suspicions Friday. He concurred
[26:32.560 --> 26:40.160]  over the weekend that this could be a pretext to nationalize oil. And we know that the White House
[26:40.160 --> 26:46.160]  has been promoting that. Well, guess what? The Obama for political points a month ago said,
[26:46.160 --> 26:50.560]  okay, I'm going to open certain areas of the Atlantic off the east coast and the Gulf of
[26:50.560 --> 26:55.600]  Mexico that have been off limits. I'm going to open those up to drilling. Now those are in
[26:55.600 --> 27:00.480]  international waters further than 12 miles out. So Obama really doesn't have jurisdiction, but
[27:00.480 --> 27:05.840]  they've claimed it over US companies. And the Russians and Chinese in the last six months had
[27:05.840 --> 27:12.560]  begun massive multi-billion dollar exploration operations to extract oil that US companies
[27:12.560 --> 27:20.720]  were barred from getting at. And so Obama said, I am going to allow some exploration
[27:21.600 --> 27:25.840]  of this because he's our God and our king and our savior. And he makes the decision,
[27:25.840 --> 27:32.000]  you know, what leg we put on, you know, we're putting our pants on what leg we put on, which
[27:32.000 --> 27:40.000]  leg first. And I had said on Friday that I believe he was going to then invoke a ban
[27:40.000 --> 27:49.520]  on offshore drilling. And here is the BBC today. Oil spill sparks new drilling ban. The US
[27:49.520 --> 27:55.440]  administration has banned oil drilling in new areas of the US coast while the cause of the oil spill
[27:55.440 --> 28:04.240]  off Louisiana is being investigated. So he announced that in six months he would take the
[28:04.240 --> 28:10.160]  ban off. So he never really took the ban off. And then now before that actually kicks in,
[28:10.160 --> 28:16.960]  he bans it again. White House advisor David Axelrod told ABC TV it wanted to know exactly what led
[28:16.960 --> 28:26.560]  to last week's explosion on BP operated rig in the Gulf of Mexico. So the ban on oil drilling
[28:26.560 --> 28:35.360]  in these areas of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic has been put back into place yet again.
[28:36.240 --> 28:42.880]  All right, let me come back. US Army trains to take on the Tea Party. Friday we broke this
[28:42.880 --> 28:47.200]  information nationally. We have internal Army training memos where they're saying the number
[28:47.200 --> 28:53.840]  one threat to America is the Tea Parties and their training to militarily take on the Tea
[28:53.840 --> 28:58.480]  Parties. We'll talk about that and get into the global financial meltdown. Stay with us.
[29:00.800 --> 29:05.440]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[29:05.440 --> 29:09.520]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[29:09.520 --> 29:14.080]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have all performed
[29:14.080 --> 29:18.240]  even gold and silver before in this country. And it's possible that could even happen again.
[29:18.240 --> 29:23.520]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[29:23.520 --> 29:29.440]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[29:29.440 --> 29:34.000]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in
[29:34.000 --> 29:39.120]  any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them
[29:39.120 --> 29:48.400]  today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[29:48.400 --> 29:57.440]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[29:57.440 --> 30:03.760]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com. When you're out on the road, the last place
[30:03.760 --> 30:10.560]  you want to be is on the road. But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were

[32:21.520 --> 32:26.160]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[32:26.160 --> 32:30.720]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[32:30.720 --> 32:35.440]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[32:35.440 --> 32:40.880]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[32:40.880 --> 32:46.240]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live
[32:46.240 --> 32:54.960]  to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[32:54.960 --> 32:58.960]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[32:58.960 --> 33:14.880]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:14.880 --> 33:30.160]  We have red mainstream news articles here on air out of the New York Times, the Wall
[33:30.160 --> 33:38.400]  Street Journal, Reuters, where the Pentagon itself is tattling on their own operations
[33:39.040 --> 33:43.760]  as a way to kind of let it just slip out quietly, kind of like you pass gas in church.
[33:43.760 --> 33:50.160]  They just let it slip out there and hope that nobody notices. That way, when it comes out in
[33:50.160 --> 33:56.640]  mainstream news later, they don't get in political trouble. And that is heroin dealing.
[33:57.680 --> 34:02.320]  Heroin is a scourge. It's a horrible, dirty, extremely addictive drug, one of the most
[34:02.320 --> 34:08.880]  addictive out there. And before 2001, there was almost no opium coming out of Afghanistan.
[34:08.880 --> 34:14.560]  Now, over 90% of world opium production comes out of Afghanistan. That's an official
[34:14.560 --> 34:25.040]  State Department number. Around $500 billion a year of unaccounted cash. So the banks
[34:25.040 --> 34:32.400]  with fractional reserve banking can leverage that at least 10 to 1. So what's 10 times $500
[34:32.400 --> 34:44.800]  billion? Well, we know that's $5 trillion. 10 times $500 billion is $5 trillion a year.
[34:45.600 --> 34:52.880]  We had the CIA take over the United States in 1947 with the National Security Act,
[34:54.400 --> 35:00.160]  and they've been operating in total secrecy without anyone able to even investigate them
[35:00.160 --> 35:11.440]  since then. The Pentagon budget is at $1.9 trillion on budget, $1.1 trillion on the official books,
[35:11.440 --> 35:16.400]  another $800 billion they get in supplemental, not counting black ops funding. So let me ask,
[35:16.400 --> 35:22.240]  does a group that gets close to $2 trillion a year, are they involved in narcotics trafficking?
[35:23.120 --> 35:26.720]  Well, we know it came out in Congress that for the 10 years, the Vietnam War,
[35:26.720 --> 35:31.040]  or they were flying inside, this is declassified, this is submitted, if you haven't looked it up,
[35:31.040 --> 35:38.240]  please do, heroin into this country. There's only a few places you can grow opium in the world,
[35:38.240 --> 35:43.760]  one of them the Golden Triangle, the other Afghanistan, and now it's more than a 12-fold,
[35:43.760 --> 35:50.240]  more than 12, that was a year old number, opium production. And because all this is coming out,
[35:50.240 --> 35:57.840]  the CIA last week had a little production on Fox News where they had an army commander on
[35:57.840 --> 36:07.520]  saying, yes, we helped the Taliban grow opium poppies. And that's coming up in the next hour.
[36:08.480 --> 36:13.040]  Now, I've told you this for years, and I've heard local talk show hosts who are police officers,
[36:15.200 --> 36:18.560]  one of them is a really nice guy, I've met him, I know him, he's not a bad guy,
[36:18.560 --> 36:24.800]  he's a good conservative libertarian, just say, I can't believe the government is bringing drugs in.
[36:24.800 --> 36:31.840]  What was declassified in 1996 and the CIA Solicitor General's investigation, I watched the
[36:31.840 --> 36:36.880]  televised hearings that most of the cocaine in the 1980s was shipped in by the CIA, I mean,
[36:36.880 --> 36:44.080]  that's on record, and it's been an Esquire, New York Times, you name it. And so, I thought I
[36:44.080 --> 36:49.520]  just covered this coming up in the next hour, because they know this info's out there, so they
[36:49.520 --> 36:55.120]  say, well, we're helping grow the opium to find al-Qaeda. So I'm going to break down exactly how
[36:55.120 --> 37:00.480]  the drug war works coming up in the next hour. Kurt Nemo's got a story, an association with his
[37:00.480 --> 37:08.880]  Fox News piece, Fox News makes excuse for CIA's Afghan opium cultivation. So our 60,000 troops,
[37:08.880 --> 37:16.320]  and another 100,000 contractors, that's 160,000, that you're paying for as taxpayers in Afghanistan,
[37:16.320 --> 37:24.160]  that's for the $500 billion, before they launder it and leverage it, that's $5 trillion. So $5
[37:24.160 --> 37:30.480]  trillion total in overall opium profits, that's why we're in Afghanistan, one of the biggest
[37:30.480 --> 37:36.560]  reasons, so we'll be going over that coming up in the next hour. And also, here's another report
[37:36.560 --> 37:42.080]  out of InfoWars.com, US Army trains that take on the Tea Party, we got more on top of the big
[37:42.080 --> 37:48.480]  stack of secret Army training manuals, where they are drilling to quote, take on the Tea Party.
[37:48.480 --> 37:53.120]  And you've seen the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL manuals out, even saying that Judge Andrew
[37:53.120 --> 38:01.040]  Napolitano, Ron Paul, myself, countless others are terrorist enablers. Yes, we're, we're criticizing
[38:01.040 --> 38:05.280]  our government, and as Americans, we're supposed to sit down and shut up, that's what landed the
[38:05.280 --> 38:09.680]  free home of the brave means, and we're not supposed to talk about that. So that's some of the other
[38:09.680 --> 38:15.200]  news I want to go over in the next hour, plus Obama's speeches, demonizing the Tea Parties,
[38:15.200 --> 38:20.000]  Berthers, and people that quote, criticize the government, you're not supposed to do that in
[38:20.000 --> 38:26.640]  America, according to Barack Hussein, Barry Sotaro, Obama. But coming back in the next segment,
[38:26.640 --> 38:30.800]  the segment after that, I want to take your phone calls, the toll free number to join us,
[38:30.800 --> 38:38.080]  on this Sunday, live May 2nd, you know, yesterday was May 1st, when the communists and illegals
[38:39.440 --> 38:44.480]  protested and rioted and beat people up in Arizona and California. And by the way,
[38:44.480 --> 38:48.560]  I couldn't find that article. Will you reprint me that San Francisco Chronicle article about a
[38:48.560 --> 38:55.360]  beaten pro sovereignty grips up? I'm sorry, it's not in my stack here. We'll come back with that.
[38:55.360 --> 39:02.880]  Notice it was May day when you saw the bombing in, in Times Square yesterday, but I'm sure,
[39:02.880 --> 39:08.400]  because I listened to the hour long press conference in New York, and there was nothing
[39:08.400 --> 39:15.680]  about this being commie day. So I'm sure none of this has anything to do with communist day.
[39:16.560 --> 39:23.120]  So let's not discuss that. Just little idea out there that this isn't some staged event
[39:23.120 --> 39:27.360]  to use a police state against the American people as most stage terror has been in the past.
[39:28.480 --> 39:33.680]  It happened on commie day, but some mainstream media is saying, well, we should look at the
[39:33.680 --> 39:39.360]  American people and the tea parties. Well, they may find some passy, they bust, they've been saying
[39:39.360 --> 39:43.280]  the tea parties are going to carry out terror attacks. Bill Clinton has said, give up all your
[39:43.280 --> 39:48.000]  rights, don't criticize what the government's doing, or you're going to cause another Oklahoma
[39:48.000 --> 39:54.000]  city. So this could be a staged event along those lines, but it could be a real event.
[39:55.600 --> 40:02.400]  It could be a real event. So we will continue to look at that today as well. But the toll free
[40:02.400 --> 40:08.720]  number to join us on air. We'll talk about any of these issues that we've discussed today is
[40:08.720 --> 40:22.080]  888-201-2244 888-201-2244 or locally in central Texas, 512-646-1776 again, 512-646-1776
[40:22.080 --> 40:32.480]  or 888-201-2244. And we will take your calls. Now they say hindsight is 2020. I don't know what
[40:32.480 --> 40:37.600]  happened with the bombing at this. They didn't kill anybody. Thank God, but a device detonated at the
[40:37.600 --> 40:48.960]  end at the finish line of a marathon there on Friday last night. Some type of smoke bomb went off
[40:48.960 --> 40:53.920]  with a bunch of gasoline firecrackers and butane and propane. So we've got to ban all that now.
[40:53.920 --> 40:59.840]  The media is saying again, people are using cars as weapons, got to ban those, got to all be slaves
[40:59.840 --> 41:06.080]  or won't be safe. I don't know what's happened with this, but we can certainly get your view on it.
[41:06.080 --> 41:10.640]  Don't worry though, the next few weeks it always comes out once the newspapers have had their
[41:10.640 --> 41:17.200]  headlines, once the sheeple have decided what they think went on. Later what actually happened
[41:17.200 --> 41:26.640]  almost always unfolds, almost always develops. Separately on the illegal aliens running around
[41:26.640 --> 41:35.120]  protesting in our country, I've got Reuters, AP and the Washington Times reporting that Mexico
[41:35.120 --> 41:43.040]  last week massacred a bunch of native Mexicans. They're Indians and in Mexico they're very racist
[41:43.040 --> 41:49.760]  against people who aren't of Spanish descent and they cut off several towns, they cut their
[41:49.760 --> 41:55.200]  electricity and water off and then some UN workers were going in and they machine gunned them on the
[41:55.200 --> 42:01.120]  road and I have other reports of Mexican troops coming into the United States and I wanted to
[42:01.120 --> 42:07.920]  ask the question to listeners out there. If you're a U.S. citizen and try to go to Mexico with an
[42:07.920 --> 42:12.720]  anchor baby, that is you go into a hospital right when your wife's about to give birth and demand
[42:12.720 --> 42:20.640]  that you be given free healthcare, you are thrown out on your behind. So and of course Mexico was
[42:20.640 --> 42:26.320]  also on the news Thursday of last week saying we apologize for abusing immigrants because they beat
[42:26.320 --> 42:31.760]  them up, they enslave them, they put them in work camps when they come in from Guatemala into
[42:31.760 --> 42:36.080]  southern Mexico. So I just wanted to point that out. I mean why are we supposed to kiss the butt
[42:36.640 --> 42:41.200]  of all these illegal aliens that are bankrupting our country and why is the government using them
[42:41.200 --> 42:47.680]  as a political tool, a weapon against the American people when Arizona just simply says if police
[42:47.680 --> 42:52.960]  pull an illegal, some alien over who's drunk driving and they happen to already be an illegal
[42:52.960 --> 42:58.080]  alien and we find the sound, we're gonna bring them to the police on that matter as well.

[44:17.120 --> 44:23.280]  possibilities. It means all the world under their control. The United Nations would take over America
[44:23.280 --> 44:29.040]  the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power
[44:29.040 --> 44:34.240]  and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government. I
[44:34.240 --> 44:38.640]  believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[44:38.640 --> 44:43.200]  financial system. Global governance with the establishment of the G20. So it's going to be an
[44:43.200 --> 44:49.200]  inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else. Invisible

[45:03.520 --> 45:08.160]  now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that
[45:08.160 --> 45:12.960]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true
[45:12.960 --> 45:16.640]  seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that
[45:16.640 --> 45:21.760]  could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of
[45:21.760 --> 45:28.400]  non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient

[47:26.240 --> 47:31.040]  speeches in the last few days where he talks about the birth certificate issue and demonizes
[47:31.040 --> 47:35.600]  anyone that disagrees with government policy. He basically says as an American you're supposed
[47:35.600 --> 47:41.680]  to sit down and shut up because the government represents the people. No that's not how it works.
[47:41.680 --> 47:51.920]  We'll be explaining that coming up. Also Greece erupts as men from IMF prepare to wield acts.
[47:51.920 --> 47:56.960]  Anger is intensifying over cuts to be made as part of the EU deal to save the economy.
[47:56.960 --> 48:01.760]  Then you read the Times of London article it says they're going to be taking people's pension funds.
[48:02.480 --> 48:08.080]  The federal government in Bloomberg and AP in the last month and a half has been proposing taking
[48:08.080 --> 48:16.720]  your 401k, your pension fund. See the banks want to bankrupt society and then every time society
[48:16.720 --> 48:21.440]  collapses they say okay now we get your savings accounts, now we get your bank accounts. This
[48:21.440 --> 48:27.920]  has happened in every other major country on the planet. Now it's about to happen here in the United
[48:27.920 --> 48:33.040]  States. But let's go to your phone calls right now. Brandon in Missouri you're on the air thanks
[48:33.040 --> 48:40.560]  for holding. Yes thank you for having me on air Alex Jones it's been I've been actually
[48:41.600 --> 48:49.040]  been on the website on info wars.com. I've been really you have been an amazing figure
[48:49.040 --> 48:53.680]  in what you're doing and I just want to thank you very much for definitely standing up for our
[48:53.680 --> 48:59.840]  rights, definitely standing up for our country. Being as that said some of the questions I've been
[48:59.840 --> 49:05.920]  meaning to ask you for quite a while is that pretty much when do you think this might go down?
[49:05.920 --> 49:12.240]  I mean a lot of people asking me and I'm just trying to get information to others who are
[49:12.240 --> 49:16.400]  trying to gather information. Okay well it's going down now the government's taken over healthcare
[49:16.400 --> 49:21.280]  to loot it and rob it. Obama made a joke in fact I've got the transcript of it coming up in the
[49:21.280 --> 49:27.680]  next hour we're going to play the audio. He said that all the jokes are tonight are brought to you
[49:27.680 --> 49:32.320]  by our friends at Goldman Sachs. Don't worry because they make money whether you laugh or not
[49:32.320 --> 49:36.400]  so that's just in your face. He said some Republicans have suggested that the healthcare
[49:36.400 --> 49:41.600]  bill contained a few secret provisions. This is untrue there are hundreds well that that's
[49:41.600 --> 49:47.280]  actually true so he's just making a joke. They've taken over the car industry they're taking over
[49:47.280 --> 49:56.000]  all of our power supplies where I live just past 2.6 billion in taxes to be to be sucked out of the
[49:56.000 --> 50:02.560]  people the next three years. It's all happening now they're launching new wars they're taking our
[50:02.560 --> 50:11.200]  freedoms. People ask when is this all coming down it's happening now and so this is an undeclared
[50:11.200 --> 50:17.440]  quiet corporate takeover of America just like we're seeing in Iceland and Greece and so many
[50:17.440 --> 50:22.960]  other countries but if you're talking about a hot takeover the the federal government has said
[50:22.960 --> 50:28.480]  they believe terrorists will detonate nukes if a nuke goes off imagine the power that will give
[50:28.480 --> 50:34.080]  the globalist to further rape the nation they're they're hyping everywhere that tea parties are
[50:34.080 --> 50:38.800]  going to stage terror attacks they're training the army to take on the tea party so you see the
[50:38.800 --> 50:45.040]  the the preparation here to sell the military and police on the fraudulent fact that the American
[50:45.040 --> 50:56.240]  people are supposedly terrorists so this is all happening now. Yeah which is which is definitely
[50:56.800 --> 51:01.920]  which definitely I think it's a lot of propaganda that they're pumping into society and also the
[51:01.920 --> 51:06.640]  the whole New York thing with the supposedly car bombing that they disarmed and stuff like that
[51:07.440 --> 51:12.960]  the whole Chicago thing of what's going on there with talking about enforcing the National Guard
[51:12.960 --> 51:17.520]  martial law pretty much there I've heard of checkpoints being in Kansas City already
[51:18.480 --> 51:26.480]  sending they've sent 30 SWAT teams down to combat supposedly the Gulf with the oil. Yeah since when
[51:26.480 --> 51:32.000]  does a SWAT team clean up an oil spill I appreciate your call yeah if you just joined us we have the
[51:32.000 --> 51:38.640]  state police in California the state police in Tennessee the state police in New York the state
[51:38.640 --> 51:44.880]  police in Michigan the state police in Illinois I covered this last week in the Chicago Tribune
[51:45.760 --> 51:52.240]  in the mainstream news saying we're running checkpoints to look for illegal guns searching
[51:52.240 --> 51:58.240]  everyone and they have Marines doing it they have troops of the Kentucky Derby just all to
[51:58.240 --> 52:03.760]  continually condition the public that troops being all over the street is normal and we have army
[52:03.760 --> 52:11.600]  times coming out repeatedly in the last two years and saying we're preparing to put troops on the
[52:11.600 --> 52:18.080]  streets and so yes last week two different state reps called for martial law in Illinois
[52:19.120 --> 52:24.880]  the mayor of Schenach to New York called for martial law and I'm here years ago saying
[52:24.880 --> 52:30.080]  they're acclimating you to troops on the streets they're preparing look Mexico doesn't announce
[52:30.080 --> 52:34.800]  they're under martial law they're just under martial law and so basically for all intents
[52:34.800 --> 52:41.840]  and purposes we're under martial law now and yes if you actually look at Kansas look at Missouri
[52:41.840 --> 52:47.200]  look at Tennessee look at a bunch of other states but those all border each other and
[52:48.240 --> 52:54.800]  just search local news channels for troops running checkpoints it's everywhere but our border
[52:54.800 --> 52:59.280]  which is actually in trouble so there's an acclimation going on you have to ask yourself
[52:59.280 --> 53:03.920]  why are you being conditioned to accept troops on the street because they're getting ready
[53:03.920 --> 53:08.880]  to bankrupt the dollar they're seriously considering and it's fact i'm gonna cover that next hour it's
[53:08.880 --> 53:14.640]  in the news and to take your pension funds and then if you get angry about that they're training
[53:14.640 --> 53:19.840]  the military to physically take you on as a terrorist this has happened in third world
[53:19.840 --> 53:25.760]  countries over and over and over again now it's happening here criminal interests get control
[53:25.760 --> 53:33.440]  the government they rob everyone they're offshore they're safe it's only the police and the military
[53:33.440 --> 53:39.040]  that have got to enforce this dangerous job and the citizens that have to be robbed until we wake
[53:39.040 --> 53:45.200]  up to that and indict the bankers and get america back and reinstate the bill of rights none of us
[53:45.200 --> 53:53.360]  are safe this is what we've been talking about for 15 years on air and now it's unfolding let's
[53:53.360 --> 53:58.720]  talk to mark in texas mark you're on the air hey great to hear you get to hear y'all talking about
[53:58.720 --> 54:06.720]  some of these things alex go ahead okay yes i can i was wondering uh if you think that uh if
[54:07.760 --> 54:13.760]  just an idea out of the air if god wants this thing these things to or wants us once the right
[54:13.760 --> 54:18.800]  thing's done and he's written it but that's the way he wants it do you think that we would find that
[54:18.800 --> 54:25.120]  that some way happening if we just keep plugging away at some of the things i'm trying to learn of
[54:25.120 --> 54:29.280]  what he says and i think i found a couple of things that that helped me get the whole picture
[54:29.280 --> 54:35.440]  of the whole thing one of them is in hebrew's chapter nine and um it's just very interesting
[54:35.440 --> 54:39.840]  talking about a will and testament four times meaning that you know maybe i have something
[54:39.840 --> 54:43.920]  there i can go back to i don't know what other people might think of that but it was in hebrew's
[54:43.920 --> 54:49.280]  nine thirteen through seventeen well let me say this justice be done may the heavens fall
[54:49.920 --> 54:52.560]  we have a job to just stand up against corruption
[54:55.360 --> 55:00.240]  without even thinking about the consequences we have to do the right thing and then whatever
[55:00.240 --> 55:09.840]  comes from that it is what it is uh but in the larger picture the destiny of this planet is in
[55:09.840 --> 55:16.000]  god's hands but if we stand up and we speak out and we get involved we can reverse this tyranny
[55:16.000 --> 55:23.840]  i appreciate your call let's talk to steven illinois steve you're on the air hi uh say i was i was

[57:10.160 --> 57:15.120]  of their money then they have their real investments then they always have the budget go under so they
[57:15.120 --> 57:22.080]  can raise taxes for essential services this is the basic mafia tech uh technique uh that's being used

[1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:13.120]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:24.320]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones coming up i'm
[1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:29.920]  going to get into cia narcotics traffic and what that means to our society but right now let's take
[1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:39.920]  your phone calls let's talk to reno 76 in north carolina you're on the air let's talk to reno
[1:00:39.920 --> 1:00:46.560]  76 and work yeah that color i try to take calls but they won't even they won't even hang their phones
[1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:51.840]  up i mean they keep the radio up they don't even pay attention it's like they're not even like
[1:00:51.840 --> 1:00:57.200]  like when i call someone on the phone i'm ready to talk to them i guess reno 76 in there we'll
[1:00:57.200 --> 1:01:01.360]  just go ahead and try another one uh pete in south carolina you're on the air go ahead p
[1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:09.120]  i got a question for you when they uh plan to disarm us do you think that it would be a good idea
[1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:15.280]  for everybody to be prepared by some book learning ahead of time because i've ordered some books
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:21.360]  through desert publications they're called uh cia improvise munitions black books one two and three
[1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:27.840]  and uh also uh some books called improvised weapons of the american underground all through
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:33.840]  desert publications and i feel more comfortable if they do come take my weapons i could possibly
[1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:40.720]  make my own well i think the most important thing to do is to reach out to our city government
[1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:47.120]  county state and federal and try to get the bill of rights reinstated so that we don't have to just
[1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:53.200]  wait at our homes to have some shootout with the government it's more important to reach out to the
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:58.000]  military and police to educate them how they're being brainwashed how they're being controlled
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:02.880]  how they're being manipulated instead of just waiting and i'm not saying you're doing that pete
[1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:07.040]  pete but some people are just waiting for some big battle with the government
[1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:12.560]  yeah i wouldn't say that i'm waiting for that but i just feel a lot more comfortable that if
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:16.000]  because if they take away all our weapons and we don't know how to make our own
[1:02:16.560 --> 1:02:19.920]  then we're hopeless and helpless you know i think it's great for people to know how to
[1:02:19.920 --> 1:02:24.800]  defend themselves and i think the point you you raise is uh well taken anything else
[1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:30.720]  well yeah there's also another book called long term survival in the coming dark age
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:36.480]  by james baloo and like i said you can go to an internet website called alibis dot com
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:41.920]  and you can get all these books really cheap and the black books the improvised munitions black
[1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:48.240]  books one two and three their cia special ops stuff it's excellent reading and you know if they
[1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:52.880]  come take my guns i know i'll be able to be a MacGyver and and put something together that
[1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:56.880]  well i mean you end up i mean they can't take your guns you should have some of your house and
[1:02:56.880 --> 1:03:02.640]  some that are buried well yeah i've i've done all that but i mean i just found out a year ago

[1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:23.440]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with yourself
[1:05:23.440 --> 1:05:29.520]  produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano particles instantly into the
[1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:35.280]  bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now
[1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:41.440]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow

[1:06:00.800 --> 1:06:07.120]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a
[1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:19.120]  war on for your mind there is a private worldwide banking takeover happening these banks create
[1:06:19.120 --> 1:06:26.000]  tens of trillions of dollars of fiat imaginary currency and all they've got to do is buy off
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:32.640]  our governments to get them to accept it and they achieve global domination it's like ken layer
[1:06:32.640 --> 1:06:37.200]  bernie made off to the next power and of course we've been telling you for several years well
[1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:42.000]  actually more than a decade but several years intensely that goldman sacks and others shapey
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:47.360]  morgan and others are engineering a financial collapse it's now come out in congress last week
[1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:52.240]  that the internal emails that indeed it was engineered they knew it was going to happen
[1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:57.520]  they told their investors to invest in it they knew what they were doing and that they plan to
[1:06:57.520 --> 1:07:06.240]  destroy their competition through that crisis so we're going to be covering that coming up after
[1:07:06.240 --> 1:07:14.960]  i cover this story now i hate to talk about something like this without engaging in several
[1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:21.920]  hours of on-air preparation going over all the evidence i mean you read about cia aircraft
[1:07:21.920 --> 1:07:29.200]  crashing full of pure cocaine in roiders you see the congressional reports in 1996
[1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:36.320]  where the cia solicitor general admitted that the cia was responsible for the crack cocaine epidemic
[1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:42.240]  in the 1980s and early 1990s and i've interviewed of course one of their chief dealers freeway
[1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:48.880]  ricky ross and others here live on air that is part of the public record but this particular case
[1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:57.360]  deals with more than just government drug dealing it reveals the program of mind control i talked
[1:07:57.360 --> 1:08:06.080]  about six eight months ago hearing bbc radio on xm and almost running off the road i actually
[1:08:07.520 --> 1:08:11.840]  started to pull off the side i i couldn't believe i was hearing this i mean i knew this
[1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:19.520]  but the fact that the system would get to a point of where they came out in the open and just
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:27.280]  admitted the truth was incredible but they did it because their activities are so public now
[1:08:27.280 --> 1:08:34.240]  that all they can do is hide in plain sight it's a psychological uh tactic they use and on that bbc
[1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:41.200]  radio report they said well the taliban al-qaeda will take over afghanistan because they'll be more
[1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:48.320]  popular with the people if the us and british forces don't protect the opium and help the tribes
[1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:56.560]  ship it out to market now pre-911 the taliban the real taliban not the cia taliban was almost
[1:08:56.560 --> 1:09:03.360]  letting no opium out of the country it it was in single digits the amount of global production
[1:09:03.360 --> 1:09:09.360]  that was coming out was it was less than 10 percent fast forward eight years later eight and a half
[1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:17.440]  years later and more than 90 percent of global opium pouring into europe pouring into china
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:24.160]  pouring into asia pouring into the united states pouring into japan pouring into africa pouring
[1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:32.000]  into latin america it's admitted that most of it 90 plus percent is coming out of afghanistan
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:40.720]  one little country where these poppies tend to grow very very easily now i've covered roiders with
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:46.960]  the headline nato rebuffs russia's call for eradicating poppies and the new york times headline
[1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:52.960]  where they came out and said yes the u.s is protecting opium production that's all come out
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:58.240]  in the last few months and so they're normalizing this i remember talking to pat tilman's brother
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:05.600]  who was also in afghanistan and he was sitting letters home the nfl star saying look i joined
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:11.120]  up to fight terrorists we're protecting opium this war is a fraud i'm gonna come back and speak out
[1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:17.680]  against this war of the people only knew and then he got fragged he got assassinated and the army
[1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:22.480]  covered that up and then it came out that they had indeed killed him that's the army reports he was
[1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:30.400]  killed up close and by friendly fire but then i see heraldo revera and fox news do a piece with an
[1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:37.040]  army commander at a base and they say oh it's just this one village we've taken it over but we've
[1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:44.080]  got a problem if we destroy their fields they're not going to be our friends and so we're even
[1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:52.880]  helping them grow it you're about to hear and see this right now we're gonna help them grow it ladies
[1:10:52.880 --> 1:11:02.240]  and gentlemen if you study the u.s history in 1834 the british east india company came in this is
[1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:09.760]  mainstream abc news and they set up skull and bones as a private intelligence agency with the wealthiest
[1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:17.120]  children of the elite at yale and it was to run opium into the u.s and to gain control the u.s
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:22.880]  government to set up tariffs against other companies that were shipping in opium later
[1:11:22.880 --> 1:11:28.880]  turned into heroin in the 1860s when they developed that system of purifying it uh because this was
[1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:34.960]  one of the biggest industries in the united states snake oil salesmen they mainly sold opium you
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:41.120]  got a headache you're depressed you got a toothache drink this you'll feel fine and so the cia out of
[1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:49.200]  the os s in the late 1940s set up the cia almost exclusively out of yale graduates that's covered
[1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:54.960]  in the film the good shepherd that robert devol directed and produced the point is this is main
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:12:00.640]  line history that i'm giving you here today but to have them just calmly come out and say this
[1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:06.160]  commander doesn't like it but it's what he's got to do to beat the terrorist we are shipping in
[1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:12.560]  the drugs we are producing the drugs and so we've gone from them denying it to saying yeah we help
[1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:17.680]  grow it and ship it but if you get caught using it we're going to put you in prison for 30 years
[1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:24.080]  so here is the fox news clip we'll go to break i'll come back and analyze this but
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:31.280]  but we've got an article breaking it down fox news makes excuse for cia afghan opium cultivation
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  it's the same thing with cocaine it's the same thing with many other illegal drugs and you've
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:41.440]  got the same big corporations pushing synthetic drugs like prozac riddling and others that are
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:47.360]  even more dangerous look drugs are a big business and when you make them illegal or by prescription
[1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:52.800]  it jacks up the price that's why government keeps them illegal you want to cut off the
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:57.680]  taliban and al-qaeda as if they're the ones producing the drugs why don't you decriminalize
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:01.920]  well then that gets rid of the black market it gets rid of the mystique it gets rid of the
[1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:07.920]  profit our government's run by banks the biggest money launderers on earth and they're shipping
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:14.000]  the smack in here it is biggest obstacles in front of the u.s troops there in afghanistan
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:19.200]  is the opium trade the taliban is using it to intimidate the population joining us from
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:25.040]  helma province is heraldo reverend good morning to you heraldo tell us what you've seen during
[1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:32.640]  your days there in afghanistan hi allison david playton yes in some ways the marines brilliantly
[1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:39.040]  executed invasion of marja this town in the middle of helman process province was the easy
[1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:44.320]  part the hard part now is governing this province of province as you suggest that has become
[1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:51.280]  addicted to opium in many many ways that is the principal crop that is being grown here the taliban
[1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:57.040]  lend the farmers the money they are indebted to the taliban they have to grow the opium now the
[1:13:57.040 --> 1:14:03.840]  marines in their success are in a sense a victim of their success because now the population is
[1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:09.040]  you know if they have these opium fields and we are tolerating it we are tolerating the cultivation
[1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:14.240]  of the opium because we know that if we were to destroy it now the population would turn against
[1:14:14.240 --> 1:14:18.640]  the marines and it would be a real security risk let me introduce lieutenant colonel brian christmas
[1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:24.400]  he's the commanding officer of the third battalion six marines really a wonderful group of marines
[1:14:24.400 --> 1:14:30.720]  here i know that you care deeply about this this contradiction the fact that here you have one of
[1:14:30.720 --> 1:14:36.880]  the best fighting forces in the world ever mounted and in a sense you're watching as this opium is
[1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:42.160]  being grown i know it it grinds at your gut how do you deal with it what are you doing about it
[1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:47.440]  well frankly this is part of their culture so while it might grind in my gut and it's what they do
[1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:52.880]  we provide them security we're providing them resources and we're providing them alternatives
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:57.120]  the alternatives are different crops to grow they're getting the seed and the fertilizer to do it
[1:14:57.920 --> 1:15:01.680]  they can they can rotate any of their crops that they want if they want to get rid of their wheat
[1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:04.880]  and grow cotton for the winter they can do that and we're going to help them do it so the same
[1:15:04.880 --> 1:15:09.520]  thing goes for the pot so you think that you know we were at the market and everywhere we go they're
[1:15:09.520 --> 1:15:14.640]  selling these little devices take a shot of this great they're hand carved these are the little
[1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:21.840]  devices they use to scrape the opium sap off the off the plant and i watched as you bought everyone
[1:15:21.840 --> 1:15:27.200]  that was for sale because you care so deeply why did you do that well i'm off the street the idea is
[1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:31.360]  that we don't want to harvest the poppy you want to you know hopefully turn the poppy over and put
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:37.200]  some wheat cotton watermelon cucumber it's all great stuff they grow out here we just want to see

[1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:16.400]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network
[1:20:17.520 --> 1:20:25.680]  so you got a 500 billion dollar a year industry record amounts of albium coming out
[1:20:25.680 --> 1:20:31.600]  it's been leaking the last few years the us forces are guarding the opium the russian government
[1:20:31.600 --> 1:20:37.120]  comes out and says you're guarding it you're shipping it into russia 30 000 plus people a year
[1:20:37.120 --> 1:20:45.200]  are dying from it eradicate it and our government says okay in ap and the new york times and fox
[1:20:45.200 --> 1:20:53.680]  news we are helping them grow it but we don't like it but if we don't let them grow it they'll
[1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:58.960]  join the taliban and al qaeda and so we've got to ship it into america
[1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:06.560]  that's how they seduce people in vietnam and that's been declassified they said
[1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:11.360]  we've got to ship the opium out or the communists will do it and they'll make all the profits so
[1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:16.000]  we've got to go ahead and ship the cocaine in from central and south america or the commies
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:19.840]  will get the money and we've got to ship the opium in or the commies will get the money
[1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:25.360]  this is the psychology then you drive up to some checkpoint and cops are out there searching cars
[1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:33.200]  looking for marijuana what a sick disgusting joke i mean i know the big banks don't want the
[1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:39.040]  500 billion they can leverage the five trillion i mean i know they don't want to deal drugs and
[1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:45.520]  make all this money of course i've interviewed big drug dealers on air they don't want drugs
[1:21:45.520 --> 1:21:51.920]  decriminalized either does the government you decriminalize drugs all the money goes out of it
[1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:57.120]  go back to 80 plus years ago during prohibition alcoholism more than tripled
[1:21:59.440 --> 1:22:07.440]  crime bosses had all this new money to corrupt police the mafia swole in size to epic proportions
[1:22:07.440 --> 1:22:12.880]  look at mexico fully collapsing in a drug war between the government that controls narcotics
[1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:18.080]  and their competition that's all that is is a drug war over who controls that money by the way it's
[1:22:18.080 --> 1:22:25.440]  500 billion in opium coming out of afghanistan it's more than 500 billion in opium and cocaine
[1:22:25.440 --> 1:22:33.520]  and marijuana shipped in you decriminalize that well then all the police and intelligence agencies
[1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:39.280]  and fbi and everybody getting a big fat juicy cut they don't get that money anymore do they
[1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:46.160]  and so that's why drugs are illegal because you make them legal the money leaves the market
[1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:52.320]  this stuff is dirt cheap then it's looked on as a pathetic thing losers do and it's controlled
[1:22:52.320 --> 1:22:59.040]  and taxed but you keep it illegal and then only armies can control it and who runs the armies
[1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:05.920]  the big governments and so there it is it's one thing you read in new york times or bbc news
[1:23:05.920 --> 1:23:11.280]  article on air where they admit our government's producing the opium and protecting it and it's
[1:23:11.280 --> 1:23:18.160]  come out that big contractors are involved shipping it out they fly cocaine heroin in every day at
[1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:24.240]  major airports under u.s. diplomatic protection and then they sell it to drug dealers and then
[1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:30.960]  they put it on your streets and then they bust low-level nobodies the denial's over you just saw
[1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:38.320]  fox news talking to an army commander saying we protect and help them grow it gee we don't like
[1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:43.520]  it then they use the double think of but we do go into town of the local area and try to buy up
[1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:49.760]  the knives they use to extract it and they do this in front of all the troops because see they've
[1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:54.240]  had a rebellion by the troops they got british and us troops on television hearing all this with
[1:23:54.240 --> 1:23:59.520]  heraldo the troops are wondering why are we here guarding opium fields why have we been ordered
[1:23:59.520 --> 1:24:06.000]  and there's photos of this to help grow it why are we ordered as farmers to help produce it
[1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:12.320]  well men if we don't do this al-qaeda is going to come here and get the money now you're getting
[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:18.320]  paid 12 dollars an hour with your army salary you just loaded on this c 130 over there and
[1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:25.440]  this is how we fight al-qaeda youngster and by the way the big banks at launder this junior

[1:34:39.200 --> 1:34:43.200]  this is on fox news now this is not we're not just going off colonel six here he could be anybody
[1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:50.480]  but specifically your years in the military how big of an open secret is this a and b what
[1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:57.120]  does the military know about pat telman go ahead the military man people in the military that are
[1:34:57.120 --> 1:35:04.800]  that are would say you know it's not getting any organization uh there's certain players on the
[1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:10.960]  gas cowboy there's no thing that that almost don't uh but everybody see killing was shot with three
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:16.480]  shots right here in a tight square right in the middle of it now you do you are telling the truth
[1:35:16.480 --> 1:35:21.760]  exactly that's in the army's own report he was shot first begged for help and they walked right up
[1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:29.680]  with an m16 and shot him three times in the face oh the autopsy pictures in my files and and uh let me
[1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:38.160]  tell you let me tell you real quick you go to colonel the one called the number six dot com
[1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:46.560]  i'm putting up everything that i know that's not that's fine okay and uh like i say killing was shot
[1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:55.520]  in a tight three three-footed circle that's right a three inch grouping three shots what does that
[1:35:55.520 --> 1:36:04.800]  mean with an m16 he was shot within feet you can have one of your own feet uh eight foot
[1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:12.320]  you know the world within your feet certainly not yards and uh it's certainly not unintentional
[1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:18.720]  but like i said you have to get out to the left back and seriously people understand who's standing
[1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:25.680]  in the crystal is and the connection between him and obama and the crime syndicate that i call the
[1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:32.960]  the satanic obama crime family and i'm not gonna say that it sounds funny at first but when you
[1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:41.360]  think about it and you analyze what is happening contaminate with the weather and the economy
[1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:49.600]  this is not a joke you have been wake up stop watching american idol american idiot
[1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:55.600]  and understand where you live where it's going on and understand that this name that you're
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:37:00.480]  listening to right now is for the last 15 years and now you said you must be the one in there to
[1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:06.480]  say that to me okay because i don't think that i don't have a view look it up let me tell y'all
[1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:11.920]  to you what the gentlemen troops are about to re-vote they have already had an actual medical
[1:37:11.920 --> 1:37:18.880]  why aren't we here and that is in what's in play well let me say this when you watch the fox news
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:24.480]  piece you can tell and i've seen this in the news there's a near mutiny over the fact the troops
[1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:29.120]  are ordered to guard the opium and ship it out and you look at the troops they look angry and
[1:37:29.120 --> 1:37:34.320]  look ashamed while their commander is explaining why they help grow the opium and ship it out for
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:39.920]  those who just joined us fox news new york times ap they all admit our own government
[1:37:39.920 --> 1:37:44.720]  is producing the opium at record levels and shipping it out and those troops look upset
[1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:50.000]  because they have to be out there again hiding this out in the open because this information
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:56.640]  is now out they've just got to come out and say it's no big deal right and the thing about it is
[1:37:56.640 --> 1:38:02.720]  what you have now is you really have a breakdown in command you have uh like ryan christians with
[1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:09.360]  telecom that was there was the interview he's a marine not the army unfortunately but you know
[1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:16.960]  that group is really demoralized it's to the point where guys are saying you when orders are
[1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:24.720]  given down they're saying says who got him says who i got two months left make me well let me
[1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:30.480]  ask you this question because you're calling on on a skype phone aren't you no i'm calling from
[1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:35.600]  about ten on texas okay because your phone's breaking up a bit but specifically give us the
[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:39.680]  website you're saying you're going to post these photos on and then tell us how long
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:48.480]  oh yeah i knew that i thought these phones i wouldn't put up no that's something i wouldn't
[1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:52.000]  do to the tibetan family no but what's the website we should what's the website again
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:39:00.480]  just a word colonel clm on email the number six dot com colonel six dot com well stay in touch
[1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:06.640]  we'll check out your information we appreciate your call but again regardless of what colonel six is
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:11.040]  saying and that sounded legit folks people are starting to get a lot of courage they're sick
[1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:17.280]  of the lies they're going public fox news if you just tuned in and i covered this friday new york
[1:39:17.280 --> 1:39:24.240]  times roiders bbc ap they go yeah the u.s governments help and grow the opium protected
[1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:29.280]  but that's how we beat the taliban because if we don't do that the locals won't side with us
[1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:36.160]  drug production is off the charts the cia has been caught over and over again shipping this in
[1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:42.800]  and they've used the phony drug war as a pretext to set up a police state in this country
[1:39:42.800 --> 1:39:50.640]  so if the government's growing it why is it illegal because that keeps the price up
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:59.200]  let's talk to brian in colorado brian you're on the air hi mr jones welcome thank you very much
[1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:06.000]  for all you've done for this country and humanity in general i wanted to touch on what happened to
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:13.280]  me in kansas last week i was driving through and um uh i about a hundred miles into it off of i-70
[1:40:13.280 --> 1:40:18.320]  i was going from florida to colorado let me guess a big checkpoint because that's in the news
[1:40:19.360 --> 1:40:25.120]  it even had it labeled a huge just it just said drug checkpoint and there was a huge
[1:40:25.120 --> 1:40:30.400]  patty wagon well imagine the genius though you ship in the drugs then you set up checkpoints
[1:40:30.400 --> 1:40:36.320]  everywhere to stop it to train your slaves the public to submit go ahead it's truly disgusting
[1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:40.720]  and i'm sure a hundred years from now people will look back at us and think we're just blatant idiots
[1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:45.200]  but uh what happened after that was even more interesting i had a long hair i live in the
[1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:48.880]  mountains of colorado doesn't mean i'm a drug addict but i just i have long hair that's a
[1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:55.360]  dip and uh i got a cop pulled up alongside of me waited until i made eye contact with him
[1:40:55.360 --> 1:41:01.200]  slanted on his brakes got behind me and pulled me over and then he didn't give me a ticket or
[1:41:01.200 --> 1:41:05.280]  anything he just he just wanted to make sure that i was okay that i he said i look tired
[1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:10.160]  even though i have my sunglasses on well that's part of the new freedom is having random cops and
[1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:15.280]  federal checkpoints and troops on the streets just letting all the slaves know we're getting ready
[1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:21.040]  to take your pension funds and this is for your own good and don't criticize the federal reserve
[1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:28.240]  or you may be a terrorist i thought it was a random thing i'd hoped but about 150 miles after
[1:41:28.240 --> 1:41:34.640]  that incident it happened again so they're using the license plate reading systems to identify and
[1:41:34.640 --> 1:41:41.040]  profile people i had a real car you know i don't know i don't know what they were doing well just
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:46.080]  welcome welcome to roam they are just robbing everybody brian i appreciate your call again i
[1:41:46.080 --> 1:41:54.240]  just played fox news saying our government helps grow and ship the opium okay it's not even hidden
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:41:59.840]  because they can't hide it because the troops are going we're growing opium this is illegal and they

[1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:16.160]  see i'm on fox men that means it's okay see it's out in the open we're allowed to be doing this
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:23.520]  it's freedom we're allowed to let goldman sack steal trillions it's freedom we're allowed to let
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:29.440]  obama nationalize health care it's freedom just sit down and shut up everything's all right
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:36.080]  let's talk to ronnie in texas ronnie what's on your mind thank you sir this is about one thing

[1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:49.680]  latin america and central asia then it begins to come out in bbc roiders ap that our troops
[1:47:49.680 --> 1:47:56.000]  are guarding the opium fields and helping ship it out what do you do you come out in the open
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:00.640]  like it's no big deal and go yeah we're helping grow it but we don't like it but we've got to do it
[1:48:02.640 --> 1:48:07.920]  that is what you heard from fox news on the ground with the army commander admitting it
[1:48:07.920 --> 1:48:12.240]  with the troops with their heads looking down at the ground they're not stupid they know this is a
[1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:20.080]  fraud they know this is a joke afghanistan's a small country with our military and our spray
[1:48:20.080 --> 1:48:24.960]  planes they could have wiped that out and eradicated it and a few months ago the russians said look
[1:48:24.960 --> 1:48:31.440]  we're losing 30 000 plus people a day a year this was in roiders and they said you could eradicate
[1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:39.200]  this stuff and stop 30 000 a year kill the poppy fields and nato said no so you remember that
[1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:43.920]  when they're brainwashing your kids to spawn you're looking for drugs in public school when
[1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:49.120]  they're running anti drug ads you remember that that our government has been caught over and over
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:54.320]  and over again in this business and they keep drugs illegal to keep the price up and so they
[1:48:54.320 --> 1:49:01.280]  can go after their competition the drug war is about being able to go after their competition
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:09.200]  and separately we told you a year ago with the former father of reaganomics the former
[1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:15.280]  head of the treasury dr paul craig roberts and cowl's other economist that first greece would go
[1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:23.840]  under then portugal then spain and then 16 other countries in the last week now spain and portugal
[1:49:23.840 --> 1:49:30.160]  are going under and driving in i mean i already knew this was in the news but driving into the
[1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:41.760]  office i was listening to cnn on my xm and there they were saying oh those evil greeks they owe
[1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:50.000]  money oh really to who they won't give up their pension funds and they said germans only get 44
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:57.040]  percent a year of what their yearly salary was greeks get 80 plus percent they didn't tell you
[1:49:57.040 --> 1:50:03.760]  that more money's taken out of their check and they said they've got to stop being greedy evil
[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:09.280]  citizens and they've got to pay the imf and world bank which are collecting money for jp morgan
[1:50:09.280 --> 1:50:15.600]  chase and goldman sacks the same group and now we've got jp morgan chase and goldman sacks and
