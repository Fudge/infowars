[00:29.240 --> 00:33.320]  you have our once a week visit with Bob Chapman coming up in the third hour to
[00:33.320 --> 00:38.480]  talk about the economy and world events I'm gonna cover just huge amounts of
[00:38.480 --> 00:42.080]  vital news and information then we of course are going to be taking your
[00:42.080 --> 00:45.680]  phone calls throughout the full transmission and I'll be back this
[00:45.680 --> 00:52.400]  Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. central for the abbreviated Sunday broadcast as well
[00:52.400 --> 00:58.040]  look at the strange stack I would call it today of news this is out of the
[00:58.040 --> 01:06.840]  Associated Press radioactive boars on the rise in Germany radioactive boars on
[01:06.840 --> 01:14.000]  the rise in Germany from Chernobyl they forage and eat different types of
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.320]  plants and things and tuberous roots and mushrooms and then it bio accumulates
[01:20.320 --> 01:24.600]  in their bodies something out of a science fiction movie but here it is
[01:24.600 --> 01:29.680]  here's another one one must take shorter showers says Prince Charles Prince
[01:29.680 --> 01:33.920]  urges British families to snub the bathtub and of course the New York
[01:33.920 --> 01:37.800]  Times has reported how great it is that school children all over the United
[01:37.800 --> 01:42.360]  States are taught to write fake tickets that the school issues them to their
[01:42.360 --> 01:46.400]  parents for taking baths or leaving the water on while they brush their teeth
[01:46.400 --> 01:51.040]  with their brain damaging sodium fluoride so we're being trained to be good
[01:51.040 --> 01:56.080]  little serfs while Prince Charles has more than 10 jet aircraft in his own
[01:56.080 --> 02:02.760]  private train and more than 20 palaces it's kind of like Ted Turner says you
[02:02.760 --> 02:07.120]  shouldn't be able to have more than one child he has five children study
[02:07.120 --> 02:12.240]  touts horse tranquilizers ketamine as a magic antidepressant they want to give
[02:12.240 --> 02:16.600]  your children that's out of the French news agency here's another one of back
[02:16.600 --> 02:19.280]  in the news we told you about this years ago but here it is the London
[02:19.280 --> 02:23.680]  Telegraph pregnant women should avoid diet soft drinks it causes premature
[02:23.680 --> 02:28.480]  birth miscarriages low birth weights you name it of course then they mentioned
[02:28.480 --> 02:35.840]  later in the article it's the aspartame but the headline is diet soft drinks no
[02:35.840 --> 02:39.640]  there's many types of diet out there that haven't been proven to be dangerous
[02:39.640 --> 02:47.040]  like aspartame the fecal matter excreted by E. coli bacteria genetically
[02:47.040 --> 02:50.560]  engineered bacteria that's what aspartame is there's lots of things that
[02:50.560 --> 02:54.160]  taste sweet that aren't good for you tell you know that to your kitty cat of
[02:54.160 --> 02:58.480]  your dog when it drinks the antifreeze we had a cat my wife and I that drinks
[02:58.480 --> 03:01.360]  some neighbors antifreeze and died a painful death we had to put it to sleep
[03:01.360 --> 03:05.880]  when it was in a coma but again soon they'll be telling you aspartame's
[03:05.880 --> 03:11.840]  nutritious continuing seasonal H1N1 flu vaccine to be combined this fall
[03:11.840 --> 03:17.720]  they've admitted that the last push last year in this year was a hoax and the
[03:17.720 --> 03:23.840]  British government admits a tenfold ten time increase in convulsions seizures
[03:23.840 --> 03:27.600]  for under five year olds to take it but their answer is hey we're going to
[03:27.600 --> 03:32.960]  combo it mix it with a regular flu shot this year and go ahead and push the
[03:32.960 --> 03:41.800]  entire fraud again on everyone so we'll be discussing some of that as well to
[03:41.800 --> 03:49.120]  today in economic news social security cuts weighed by panel a white house

[04:03.160 --> 04:10.280]  immigration legislation continuing Moscow on security alert after North
[04:10.280 --> 04:17.360]  Caucasus bombings and we will continue with some of the other Orwellian news of
[04:17.360 --> 04:25.480]  the day headline Orwell in charge Kucinich compares Iraq exit to Bush's
[04:25.480 --> 04:30.000]  mission accomplished and that's what it is they've removed some of the troops
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  to send them to Afghanistan but they've increased the contractors and are still
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.720]  have us troops in combat operations but the media is all hailing the end of the
[04:38.720 --> 04:43.600]  war didn't bush just three months into the invasion dressed up in a fighter
[04:43.600 --> 04:48.360]  pilot outfit with a cod piece like something out of spinal tap going to the
[04:48.360 --> 04:54.320]  metal detector and say that mission was accomplished well now we've seen this

[07:05.840 --> 07:09.880]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[07:09.880 --> 07:13.800]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[07:13.800 --> 07:17.800]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[07:17.800 --> 07:22.360]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[07:22.360 --> 07:26.360]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[07:26.360 --> 07:30.160]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[07:30.160 --> 07:33.840]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[07:33.840 --> 07:38.160]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[08:15.960 --> 08:28.000]  Jones it is Friday 20th the day of August 1 to 10 I'm gonna get into the
[08:28.000 --> 08:34.560]  news in detail from around the planet as we track the scientific dictatorship the
[08:34.560 --> 08:38.360]  private corporate takeover that is taking place and we'll take your phone

[08:50.920 --> 08:55.840]  toll-free number to join us on this live Friday broadcast and again I'll be
[08:55.840 --> 09:02.000]  back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. with the abbreviated Sunday transmission let's
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.240]  just start right here hi-tech carts will tell on Cleveland residents who don't
[09:08.240 --> 09:16.000]  recycle and they will face a $100 fine per infraction and of course all of the
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.680]  major retailers and suppliers are building the tags in by design for
[09:21.680 --> 09:27.600]  worldwide distribution where everything you will be by and sell will be tracked
[09:27.600 --> 09:31.560]  and if you don't properly recycle it that's just the cover story to fund the
[09:31.560 --> 09:36.080]  program you will be fined so it's total surveillance with another report an
[09:36.080 --> 09:40.800]  entire city is installing retina scanners to buy and sell in a quote
[09:40.800 --> 09:46.640]  test I remember 12 years ago reading the Pentagon documents that were public
[09:46.640 --> 09:52.040]  MIT documents where they said every product in the world will have RFID in
[09:52.040 --> 09:56.640]  it everything you do will be tracked it will basically allow you to the
[09:56.640 --> 10:04.320]  government to do a Google type search of the real world not just the internet or
[10:04.320 --> 10:08.640]  cyberspace or that dimension but the third dimension that we actually live
[10:08.640 --> 10:13.720]  in and so this is the total surveillance system and I would come on air and warn
[10:13.720 --> 10:18.560]  people that they're going to use these RFID tags and all your products and then
[10:18.560 --> 10:23.520]  you'll have to sort them in very complex ways in your bins and they're going to
[10:23.520 --> 10:28.080]  have spies digging through your trash cans but also they're going to have
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.840]  special meter reading systems on the trash trucks that will scan all of this
[10:32.840 --> 10:38.800]  and now it is here of course England implemented it about seven years after
[10:38.800 --> 10:43.840]  we learned of it five years ago they're now implementing it here the total grid
[10:43.840 --> 10:48.880]  of control and then they force you to pay for the RFID along with your purchase
[10:48.880 --> 10:54.080]  of the products and then don't even give you an opportunity what was it in 2002
[10:54.080 --> 10:57.520]  Walmart and the Defense Department teamed up according to the Associated
[10:57.520 --> 11:02.400]  Press to demand that all of their suppliers put these government approved
[11:02.400 --> 11:07.800]  chips in and this is worldwide worldwide and Prince Charles is in the news
[11:07.800 --> 11:11.920]  saying you shouldn't be allowed to take a bath you should only be allowed to
[11:11.920 --> 11:16.920]  sponge yourself off because there's no water water isn't renewable another
[11:16.920 --> 11:20.880]  complete lie it's all about training you to have nothing with controlled
[11:20.880 --> 11:24.240]  austerity they're going to take your pension funds they're going to take
[11:24.240 --> 11:29.440]  your social security and several waves of cuts down to nothing the tiny amount of
[11:29.440 --> 11:33.960]  chicken feed you get will be tied to government-run eugenics death panels that
[11:33.960 --> 11:38.240]  will cut all of the real treatments and care that can actually cure or treat
[11:38.240 --> 11:43.280]  serious illnesses while they introduce the chemical and bio weapons to the food
[11:43.280 --> 11:50.280]  and water to cause seriously degenerative and death-causing diseases this is
[11:50.280 --> 11:55.320]  their master plan so high-tech carts will tell on Cleveland residents who
[11:55.320 --> 12:00.280]  don't recycle and they face a hundred dollar fine it would be a stretch to
[12:00.280 --> 12:04.320]  say big brother will hang out in Cleveland's trash cans well no it
[12:04.320 --> 12:07.800]  wouldn't be a stretch what do they say in England all the flights will have
[12:07.800 --> 12:14.960]  cameras that watch you in every seat the back seat of the person sitting in
[12:14.960 --> 12:18.240]  front of you will have a camera and a microphone recording everything you do
[12:18.240 --> 12:23.360]  all cars by law they're trying to set these regulations will have cameras that
[12:23.360 --> 12:27.320]  watch you real-time dialed into the police AI computers will be listening
[12:27.320 --> 12:30.880]  for keywords it'll pick up on you screaming at your children will
[12:30.880 --> 12:34.640]  immediately dial the health department CPS will be dispatched you will all be
[12:34.640 --> 12:40.080]  prisoners under 24-hour total surveillance over 22,000 homes in
[12:40.080 --> 12:44.520]  England according to BBC and they say it's good at birth the parents now have
[12:44.520 --> 12:48.120]  cameras installed in the home to watch them if they don't change the diaper
[12:48.120 --> 12:53.760]  right or the baby coughs or or the baby rolls off the bed your child is gone into
[12:53.760 --> 12:58.120]  government control naked body scanners going in everywhere they're saving the
[12:58.120 --> 13:02.960]  images blasting your body with radiation total control forced inoculations are
[13:02.960 --> 13:08.080]  now being promoted it's all happening worse than 1984 totally criminal
[13:08.080 --> 13:12.480]  government face scanning cameras are in Austin where I live license plate
[13:12.480 --> 13:17.240]  reading cameras are going up everywhere microphones went up 13 years ago they
[13:17.240 --> 13:20.080]  called them gunshot detectors as the cover story they now admit they're
[13:20.080 --> 13:24.000]  listening to us it's all a big joke at the higher echelons of the police
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.600]  department I even had the police chief in here during a break joking with the
[13:27.600 --> 13:31.320]  commander he brought along one time about it the command the commander started
[13:31.320 --> 13:35.840]  talking the police chief said you're here to be with me and watch my back not
[13:35.840 --> 13:42.320]  to talk not to tell this slave what we're doing it's so much fun to be a
[13:42.320 --> 13:46.680]  federally appointed judge police chief you had a federal board tell the city
[13:46.680 --> 13:49.400]  they'd give them money if they appointed this police chief it's the same in
[13:49.400 --> 13:55.080]  every major city so here is the total surveillance bondage system and the
[13:55.080 --> 14:00.240]  establishment is laughing at all of you laughing all the way to their eugenics
[14:00.240 --> 14:05.400]  bank with it but it says it would be a stretch yeah it's a stretch to have
[14:05.400 --> 14:09.040]  everything you're putting in your trash track you know it's a stretch to have
[14:09.040 --> 14:12.520]  everything you do in your home being listened to by Google over the
[14:12.520 --> 14:16.320]  microphones in your computer and they admitted it four years ago yeah it's a
[14:16.320 --> 14:20.440]  stretch to say that the schools are training kids to come home and boss their
[14:20.440 --> 14:24.240]  parents around about the environment and to write reports at school about how
[14:24.240 --> 14:28.080]  bad their parents are training them to be spies against the family that's not
[14:28.080 --> 14:33.360]  big brother yeah it's a stretch no it's total big brother it would be a stretch
[14:33.360 --> 14:37.360]  to say that big brother will hang out in Cleveland's trash cans but the city
[14:37.360 --> 14:42.280]  plans to sort through curbside trash to make sure residents are recycling and
[14:42.280 --> 14:49.000]  find them $100 if they don't this was always the stated plan and I would talk
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.760]  about it on the radio and get little emails and calls going you're a cook
[14:52.760 --> 14:57.360]  you know the NSA doesn't exist oh yeah just 10 years ago the media said it
[14:57.360 --> 15:03.600]  didn't even exist NSA didn't exist that's what they do oh there's no world
[15:03.600 --> 15:08.680]  government there's no Bilderberg group there's no trilateral Commission there's
[15:08.680 --> 15:12.360]  no the banks aren't stealing money you know what happened when whistleblowers
[15:12.360 --> 15:15.800]  for 11 years went to the Securities and Exchange Commission with all of the
[15:15.800 --> 15:20.320]  fraud of made-off robbing upwards of $100 billion they just said it doesn't
[15:20.320 --> 15:27.160]  exist sit down and shut up it's a class of criminals at every level going
[15:27.160 --> 15:33.760]  completely hog wild continuing here the move is part of a high-tech collection
[15:33.760 --> 15:37.480]  system the city will roll out next year with new trash and recycling carts
[15:37.480 --> 15:41.680]  embedded with radio frequency identification chips and barcodes yes
[15:41.680 --> 15:46.120]  and they share the fines with the mafia trash companies you didn't know the big
[15:46.120 --> 15:49.160]  trash companies are some of the most mafia connected groups well you better
[15:49.160 --> 15:53.800]  do some research the chips will also allow city workers to monitor how often
[15:53.800 --> 15:57.680]  residents roll carts the curb for collection if a chip shows a recyclable
[15:57.680 --> 16:00.920]  cart hasn't been brought to the carbon weeks a trash supervisor will sort
[16:00.920 --> 16:05.000]  through the trash for recyclables that's right they're gonna send an agent a
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.280]  code enforcer out to your house you're going to do this and they're gonna come
[16:09.280 --> 16:13.600]  and do home inspections under the carbon tax law and in one week if you don't
[16:13.600 --> 16:16.760]  make changes to your house the government without a court forfeits your
[16:16.760 --> 16:20.960]  home and evicts you and takes it that's in the bill that passed the house not the
[16:20.960 --> 16:29.280]  Senate this is total tyranny and they've got huge train SWAT teams that if you

[18:18.920 --> 18:22.280]  every day I read this stuff in the afternoon the day before I read it at
[18:22.280 --> 18:26.240]  night I read it at the morning I come in the guys have found a bunch of news I
[18:26.240 --> 18:30.520]  hadn't even seen I sit here for about 30 minutes going back over it and then I
[18:30.520 --> 18:35.600]  just get freaked out and upset because I just scanned over probably about 75 80
[18:35.600 --> 18:39.080]  100 I don't have it counted them articles and I just see pure evil everywhere

[18:51.680 --> 18:55.960]  seizures and if it's a little baby it's even better when the little baby goes to
[18:55.960 --> 18:59.680]  the clinic and gets the shot and has a convulsion in the car and has blood
[18:59.680 --> 19:03.040]  running out their nose as tens of thousands do every time this happens
[19:03.040 --> 19:07.000]  when they come back the CPS comes with the cops and they take all the woman's

[19:23.200 --> 19:26.520]  way with them because they love it they love it and they know full well their

[32:50.720 --> 33:08.000]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www dot silver lungs dot com
[33:08.000 --> 33:16.480]  we are on the march the empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[33:16.480 --> 33:28.960]  network Google is now publicly admitted to be a CIA NSA creation but then the
[33:28.960 --> 33:34.800]  private individuals that run it they get to then profit from the government
[33:34.800 --> 33:38.920]  protection they're given the government seed money they were given to create
[33:38.920 --> 33:45.120]  Google I was listening to MSNBC two days ago and they were saying why doesn't
[33:45.120 --> 33:49.920]  Google spend more money on the divisions that it has like web search and
[33:49.920 --> 33:54.880]  advertising that is making over 90% of its profit why is it branching out to
[33:54.880 --> 33:59.240]  take over every area of the web and they said it's almost like the analyst was
[33:59.240 --> 34:03.960]  saying they're aggressively waging war on every other company and wanting to
[34:03.960 --> 34:07.120]  dominate the web itself well congratulations you figured it out
[34:07.120 --> 34:13.200]  their stated goal is to take over the internet and to be the internet and then
[34:13.200 --> 34:17.840]  to be able to censor and control the web just like the Pentagon when they were
[34:17.840 --> 34:21.160]  ramming tanks and running over people and shooting people at Waco they said
[34:21.160 --> 34:26.400]  this is not an assault and then people will come up with their hands up they'd
[34:26.400 --> 34:32.120]  shoot them that's on record it's the same thing Google's name don't be evil
[34:32.120 --> 34:37.120]  it's slogan it's the opposite now people say well why do you use Google then why
[34:37.120 --> 34:41.000]  do you use YouTube because that's where the war is to a great extent now that's
[34:41.000 --> 34:47.040]  the internet that's the web federal courts will rule for Google in cases
[34:47.040 --> 34:51.440]  when they're clearly violating people's copyright doing whatever they want but
[34:51.440 --> 34:55.520]  then separately even other big companies the courts will rule against it's just
[34:55.520 --> 35:01.280]  like Tyson chicken has a global oligopoly near monopoly not just here
[35:01.280 --> 35:06.320]  but in Asia over chicken and they're allowed to have in some cases hundreds
[35:06.320 --> 35:11.320]  of times violations per packing plant that their competition is because they
[35:11.320 --> 35:16.600]  are the consolidator they have been chosen same thing with BP they have had
[35:16.600 --> 35:21.320]  more violations in Houston and Texas City alone in the last decade than all
[35:21.320 --> 35:27.280]  other oil company refinery violations combined because they are owned by the
[35:27.280 --> 35:32.160]  Dutch and British Royal family and they are the top echelon they're funding the
[35:32.160 --> 35:36.720]  global carbon tax they bullied the other oil companies in the last five years
[35:36.720 --> 35:42.480]  into accepting that so it's a vertical integration and we saw an amazing
[35:42.480 --> 35:49.240]  illustration of this yesterday you did it again we're 11 for 11 couple times
[35:49.240 --> 35:52.760]  we've done two search terms so we're actually 14 for 14 but we've long but
[35:52.760 --> 35:56.680]  sometimes we've done this 11 times but a few times I've given out two search
[35:56.680 --> 36:03.440]  terms in one day so technically we're 14 for 14 I've counted them up we're now
[36:03.440 --> 36:09.720]  14 for 14 we put out two search terms yesterday kill web and bombshell
[36:09.720 --> 36:14.520]  Barack that linked to articles that we've written about Barack Obama being a
[36:14.520 --> 36:19.440]  known CIA operative asset literally from the time he was a child his entire
[36:19.440 --> 36:26.120]  family on both sides that became the number one search term literally hundreds
[36:26.120 --> 36:33.400]  of blogs and news sites reported on it big success they didn't delist that as
[36:33.400 --> 36:38.160]  Google news as the big aggregator those links were still available though they
[36:38.160 --> 36:44.240]  did remove it as the number one search term it became number one kill web was
[36:44.240 --> 36:47.600]  number two then became number one then got pushed number three that was totally
[36:47.600 --> 36:54.240]  erased dealing with Google and it stated plans with Verizon and others to begin
[36:54.240 --> 37:00.600]  phasing out the open free internet as we know it now kill web for about ten
[37:00.600 --> 37:06.440]  minutes when it was the top search term was linked to our story when people saw
[37:06.440 --> 37:12.440]  that term the top link was the prisonplanet.com article by Paul Joseph
[37:12.440 --> 37:16.920]  Watson that had the headline Google's plan to kill the internet part of
[37:16.920 --> 37:20.840]  consolidation of the internet or Google's plan to kill the web part of
[37:20.840 --> 37:28.000]  consolidation of the internet they didn't just delist the term kill web
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.880]  suddenly the Wall Street Journal in live time came out with a blog with the
[37:33.880 --> 37:41.240]  term kill web separately that replaced it and they removed the prisonplanet.com
[37:41.240 --> 37:47.440]  article from searchability on Google news we have never seen that in live
[37:47.440 --> 37:55.200]  time Google did not want you reading that article by Paul Joseph Watson we
[37:55.200 --> 37:58.920]  are effectively challenging the globalist the listeners are our power
[37:58.920 --> 38:03.920]  you're taking action info wars and prisonplanet are rising stratosphericly
[38:03.920 --> 38:12.200]  in their ratings info wars now in the top 500 sites in the world and if it
[38:12.200 --> 38:16.600]  continues to grow it'll be in the top 100 within a year a year after that it
[38:16.600 --> 38:20.920]  will be in the top 50 I mean this is incredible this has got the system
[38:20.920 --> 38:24.480]  worried ladies and gentlemen they've hacked us they've attacked us they've
[38:24.480 --> 38:28.160]  harassed us they've done things I don't even get into on air because that would
[38:28.160 --> 38:34.280]  feed into their operations the point is we're having a real effect and that's
[38:34.280 --> 38:37.800]  why they've intensified their attacks and they're only going to intensify the
[38:37.800 --> 38:43.960]  more now the video analysis that it's 15 minutes long that goes along with the
[38:43.960 --> 38:50.800]  articles Paul Watson has written about this subject is it prisonplanet.tv get
[38:50.800 --> 38:54.720]  it share it burn to death give it to everyone you know because in 15 minutes
[38:54.720 --> 38:59.200]  we boil down the Google slash government Verizon takeover of the web that
[38:59.200 --> 39:03.520]  they're now attempting and the name of the video is Google plans to kill web
[39:03.520 --> 39:08.080]  and internet takeover agenda and I like to give these videos first prisonplanet.tv
[39:08.080 --> 39:13.200]  members but what we're going to do is we are going to have it uploaded in the
[39:13.200 --> 39:18.720]  next hour to the Alex Jones channel at YouTube as well for viral spread so
[39:18.720 --> 39:22.520]  please get it when you get behind a video we can get tens of millions of
[39:22.520 --> 39:27.880]  views routinely over a half million another serious strike using their
[39:27.880 --> 39:32.200]  system to expose what's happening now the average Google workers compartmentalized
[39:32.200 --> 39:35.760]  it's like the average cop is good in this compartmentalized or the average
[39:35.760 --> 39:40.680]  CPS workers compartmentalized and isn't that bad just like the average you know
[39:40.680 --> 39:46.360]  person working for the CIA is compartmentalized or the FBI but there's no
[39:46.360 --> 39:50.480]  doubt Google's a government front that's admitted and there's no doubt it is not
[39:50.480 --> 39:54.520]  even running a business plan it is running a full spectrum dominance
[39:54.520 --> 39:59.920]  takeover of the web operation so get the video from prisonplanet.tv get it out
[39:59.920 --> 40:05.040]  to everyone Google plans to kill web and internet takeover agenda that's the name
[40:05.040 --> 40:09.200]  of the video and the name of the censored article and great job to
[40:09.200 --> 40:12.600]  everybody making both those search terms number one now I want to get into
[40:12.600 --> 40:17.280]  economic news but I want to get into this first yesterday I noticed that
[40:17.280 --> 40:21.840]  organically the number three and number six search terms when I happen to look
[40:21.840 --> 40:27.840]  at it were Bilderberg group and Bilderberg club because Fidel Castro
[40:27.840 --> 40:34.520]  read Daniel Estlund's book which is excellent club Bilderberg with the
[40:34.520 --> 40:40.840]  Bilderberg club and talked about how yes there's this global group of elitist
[40:40.840 --> 40:44.360]  running the planet I noticed Fidel didn't talk about the fact that
[40:44.360 --> 40:51.920]  communist in China and Russia to a full extent funded the communist operation to
[40:51.920 --> 40:56.720]  create a false bipolar enemy to fight against I agree with Joel Scalcin
[40:56.720 --> 41:01.960]  yesterday they didn't run the Soviets they didn't run the Nazis it's on record
[41:01.960 --> 41:06.760]  they created them and funded them as an enemy they could then destroy and had
[41:06.760 --> 41:12.640]  intelligence operatives from their founding throughout their hierarchies so
[41:12.640 --> 41:17.040]  that they always had an intelligence upper hand but the leadership they didn't
[41:17.040 --> 41:22.360]  control the very top leadership I mean here's an example Saddam Hussein 1958 he's
[41:22.360 --> 41:27.440]  18 years old it's declassify your mainstream Washington post that he was
[41:27.440 --> 41:32.000]  hired and trained for four years in Egypt by the CIA he was sent in to commit
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.520]  assassinations a decade later they were so scared of the teams he was leading
[41:36.520 --> 41:41.240]  they that the US and England said make Saddam Hussein the head of Bathis
[41:41.240 --> 41:45.160]  security and we will stop killing your leaders they made him the head of
[41:45.160 --> 41:53.240]  Bathis security in 69 no 68 and then in 1979 he staged a coup and became the
[41:53.240 --> 41:57.360]  Bathis leader then they gave him 35 to 40 billion dollars to launch an attack on
[41:57.360 --> 42:02.800]  Iran then they double-crossed him but once they double-crossed him almost all of
[42:02.800 --> 42:08.040]  his officer corps had been trained for decades in the United States on record
[42:08.040 --> 42:15.080]  that's why when the 91 war ended 5,000 plus Iraqi officers were brought back to
[42:15.080 --> 42:21.680]  the US LA Times Washington Post because they had been trained previously here
[42:21.680 --> 42:25.920]  now they're used for black up terror attacks they're a sabotage army the
[42:25.920 --> 42:30.400]  government can use it they'll burn a couple of them the leadership understands
[42:30.400 --> 42:33.160]  they'll burn some of their underlings if they ever launch that terror attack but
[42:33.160 --> 42:38.600]  that's a secret brigade or above brigade strength Iraqi terror force now that
[42:38.600 --> 42:43.040]  we've identified inside the US that does not work for Saddam Hussein he's he's
[42:43.040 --> 42:48.640]  dead as you know at the end of a rope it works for the CIA that created them but
[42:48.640 --> 42:56.200]  you notice that Fidel Castro didn't talk about that in his article he wrote but
[42:56.200 --> 43:04.000]  the fact is that he's elevated even more but we've gone from ten years ago no
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.360]  one maybe one out of a hundred know what the Bilderberg group is to the vast
[43:07.360 --> 43:10.720]  majority of people knowing about shadow government world government
[43:10.720 --> 43:15.440]  Bilderberg group the New York Times the Financial Times of London they've gone
[43:15.440 --> 43:19.480]  from denying it existed when Jim Tucker was exposing it 34 years ago and
[43:19.480 --> 43:24.840]  Westbrook Peggler 60 years ago wrote two stories about it he didn't even know
[43:24.840 --> 43:30.040]  the name of it then then he died Tucker picked up on it now they admit it's real
[43:30.040 --> 43:33.760]  and admit they want world government but say it's a good idea to have the
[43:33.760 --> 43:37.200]  bankers run a world government and you'll pay all your environmental and
[43:37.200 --> 43:43.080]  carbon taxes to them so we've done an article here at prisonplanet.com that
[43:43.080 --> 43:47.400]  just launched in the last 20 minutes that is so incredibly important we're
[43:47.400 --> 43:53.000]  gonna get it posted up on info wars.com as well this is gonna be the stop the
[43:53.000 --> 43:58.960]  top story throughout the weekend two films that blue Bilderberg wide open
[43:58.960 --> 44:03.160]  most people aren't gonna read they're not gonna read the Financial Times of
[44:03.160 --> 44:05.960]  London with the Bilderberg group admitting their authoritarian and taking
[44:05.960 --> 44:09.960]  over for our own good but they will watch in-game blueprint for global
[44:09.960 --> 44:14.160]  enslavement they will watch the Obama deception and see Obama meeting secretly
[44:14.160 --> 44:18.040]  with Hillary at the Bilderberg meeting while the media had been told he'd gone
[44:18.040 --> 44:22.280]  somewhere else and that's just a small part of the film but very close to the
[44:22.280 --> 44:26.760]  start and then exposes their full agenda you get these two films to people
[44:26.760 --> 44:30.720]  and they're free did I mention they're free yes I sell the DVDs of in-game I
[44:30.720 --> 44:35.880]  sell the DVDs of Obama deception we have at the highest quality at prisonplanet.tv
[44:35.880 --> 44:42.280]  but my goal here is not to make money as long as we can fund our operation
[44:42.280 --> 44:45.840]  which we're doing okay at probably have a money bomb soon to get past some
[44:45.840 --> 44:49.760]  shortages undridges we've had we need to expand we could keep going where we're
[44:49.760 --> 44:53.480]  at we've got to grow in the face of the enemy we've got to intensify we've got
[44:53.480 --> 44:59.200]  to adapt we've got to overcome but but getting back to what I'm saying if we
[44:59.200 --> 45:02.080]  make this the number one search term I'm not gonna do another search term for a
[45:02.080 --> 45:05.200]  few weeks I think I'm gonna lay off of it for a while but I want this to be our
[45:05.200 --> 45:18.680]  biggest ever our biggest ever I want to search the term Bilderberg films Bilderberg

[45:37.320 --> 45:42.840]  awakening to the new world order and when they go to this article they will
[45:42.840 --> 45:46.320]  get the full spectrum of Bilderberg and what its plans are for world

[46:34.080 --> 46:41.600]  having a huge sustained effect right now and the people are now ready to hear

[47:19.280 --> 47:24.120]  in game blueprint for global enslavement almost three hours long and just under
[47:24.120 --> 47:29.800]  two hours the Obama deception the Obama deception has had seven million views on
[47:29.800 --> 47:37.480]  one channel alone it's approaching 30 million views on YouTube Google blip TV
[47:37.480 --> 47:42.840]  and the file-sharing networks just the numbers we can see 30 million views in a
[47:42.840 --> 47:47.760]  year and a half that is a devastating effect on the enemy because it's not
[47:47.760 --> 47:52.040]  Obama being politically exposed and politically destroyed as a liberal
[47:52.040 --> 47:55.480]  because then they'll just put in a fake Republican it's exposing the entire
[47:55.480 --> 48:00.200]  paradigm and how the Bilderberg group and other globalist interlocking systems

[56:41.480 --> 56:45.080]  everything's moving up in price and that's because of the fact that the

[56:48.600 --> 56:52.760]  states dollar they're going to gold we know that we're going to see inflation
[56:52.760 --> 56:55.640]  because the government's resorting to printing press
[56:55.640 --> 56:59.480]  to solve its economic and the fall is always when gold runs up the most so
[56:59.480 --> 57:03.400]  they can try some manipulation in the interim but all the charts show clearly

[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.800]  doing checkpoints here if you would allow me just to explain that go over
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.360]  what happened eventually and then a couple other things i wanted to mention
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:16.200]  wait then are are are are are you the newspaper reporter that interviewed me
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.720]  yes that's me i'm a freelance writer a freelance reporter from los angeles
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.920]  yeah but that was for a major newspaper that you wrote that for i don't remember
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.520]  the name but we had the press releases about the marines
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.040]  running drunk driving checkpoints uh yeah tell us about it
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.480]  right okay so what happened was this happened in december 2008 the actual
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:37.320]  incident i reported on it in early 2009 and it was for the inland empire
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.800]  weekly which is a you know weekly newspaper out in the
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:43.240]  inland empire which is a part of southern california just outside of la
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:47.400]  uh... so basically what happened was i confirmed by the marines
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.680]  uh... gunnery sergeant at the marines that military police were there there
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:54.360]  was even a photo of it uh... i never got uh... hold up the person who was
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.480]  arrested although i know that they did arrest with least one person and i
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:01.080]  never got hold of uh... the attorney that i spoke to that was involved
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:05.080]  but i'll have an email that uh... the one of the gunnery sergeant sent me uh
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:08.360]  it was from february of last year where he was actually transferred to japan
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.320]  after you know i was trying to contact him for a month
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.680]  uh... gunnery sergeant chris cox he sent me an email uh
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.640]  from february of 2009 basically and he was no longer
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.080]  in the country he got trapped well what's happening is from tennessee to
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:25.160]  california to florida to texas michigan you name it
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.560]  they have regular army and marines actually arresting citizens everywhere
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.960]  and they just do it to see if they can get away with it
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.400]  and when the governor said don't do it last year in tennessee
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.360]  they just went ahead and did it anyway shutting down highways
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:42.440]  i mean this is the takeover of this country

[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.560]  from the home by the way the washington post admitted in 2002 they do torture
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:45.880]  people's children and wives in front of them that's what the good guys do
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:49.640]  and if people think that the globalist don't want to do this to citizens
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:54.760]  or do it to the american people almost all their training is for us go ahead
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.280]  uh... yeah it's it's just unbelievable i can't believe uh... you know
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.640]  where the world is going uh... and mentioning uh... you know the war in
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.680]  iraq basically wanted to mention all of you caught up to you and yesterday they
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.560]  had a report with our david gurgen he's a known builder burger
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.720]  he was on the situation room with uh...
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:13.320]  wolf blitzer basically in one minute uh... wolf blitzer was you know parading
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.920]  the fact that the war is over but
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.560]  in the same segment he's talking about there's going to be fifty thousand
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.520]  troops there and they made a big deal about how it could be a business boom
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:24.600]  for private security forces uh... basically i have the ap with the
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.640]  government admitting they're going to increase the security forces
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:31.080]  the private mercs and but this is what they do
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:35.080]  they kept the oil well ninety-something days in there's fishers everywhere it's
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.600]  still leaking and they just say there's no more oil
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:43.160]  problem solved it's not true obama says core exits good for you
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:46.360]  there's no health problems there's no world government

[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.440]  they just use the military tactic of denial we're their enemy
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.440]  they're the offshore bankers they hate america we'll be right back

[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:27.000]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.840]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:34.040]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose

[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:03.880]  voters are fed up with our lawmakers inability to take action when it comes
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:08.040]  to reducing this country's 1.5 trillion federal deficit
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.640]  as the wall street journal reports it's the voters who appear to be more
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:15.720]  willing to take drastic steps to do something about the nation's mounting
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.280]  red ink the newspaper talked to voters in
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:22.680]  virginia a swing state who say they're willing to make the tough cuts
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:27.480]  from a national sales tax to budget cuts to higher medicare co-pays and
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:30.760]  deductibles the voters get it even if the federal
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:34.360]  government doesn't and washington really doesn't get it
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:39.000]  our leaders worry about being attacked in an election year if they even suggest
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.560]  spending cuts or tax increases the american people just want their leaders
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:47.080]  to lead on this issue too much to ask that's why they were elected
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:51.000]  remember one independent voter in richmond virginia told the journal
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.480]  quote here i wish the politicians would be hard asses and be like
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:59.240]  you know what it's going to be horrible for the next few years but you've got to
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.680]  shut up unquote wouldn't that be refreshing
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.800]  meanwhile we await the results of president obama's
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:10.680]  bipartisan deficit reduction commission which are conveniently scheduled for
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:14.600]  release after the november election and when the recommendations
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:19.800]  finally do come most if not all of them will have to be approved by congress
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:24.200]  which will likely render the entire exercise meaningless
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.640]  some are suggesting a popular uprising is perhaps the only way to get this
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.000]  country back on track there's a piece on info wars dot com
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.320]  suggesting without a revolution americans are history
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:39.080]  here's the question then if voters want the deficits addressed
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:43.480]  why does washington continue to ignore them go to cnn.com slash
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.400]  kafity file and post comment on my blog
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.840]  jack kafity thanks very much
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:10:03.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:10.200]  you want answers well so does he live from austin texas broadcasting
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:15.080]  worldwide it's alex jones
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:19.080]  we are back live going to your phone calls and a ton of vital news here in the
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:24.360]  second hour on this live friday edition yeah a couple days ago kafity of uh
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:28.520]  seeing in plug the info wars dot com i didn't really know what to make of that
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:32.040]  so i i analyzed it and of course he was quoting a dr paul
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:37.080]  craig robert's article that went mega viral uh on the web uh
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:41.960]  dealing with the fact uh well the actual headline was the ecstasy of empire
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:45.960]  the article ended with if americans don't have a revolution americans are
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.640]  finished you know i don't call for a physical
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.240]  revolution here and we had dr roberts on that day he's not calling
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.280]  for that either he's just saying that if we don't somehow
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:00.600]  revolution means change get back to our constitution and bill of rights
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:04.440]  it's over but i think cnn went with that piece
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.600]  to make it look like popular sentiment for revolution would be
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.800]  tax increases that's not what the american people want
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:17.160]  they want government cut not tax increases so they're selling it as a
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:21.320]  revolutionary idea to raise taxes when that actually lowers
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.480]  overall tax receipts every major economist admits that
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:29.320]  when i even tune into cnbc they admit that they know that but they want the
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.160]  control over who they tax and then who they give corporate
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:36.760]  welfare to it's a way to consolidate the economy to
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.880]  a planned economy like they have in communist china
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:45.880]  now we need a revolution of ideas and a revolution at the state level
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:50.120]  peacefully taking our legislatures back and then taking control of our federal
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.000]  government itself has been seized by offshore banks
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.720]  corporations that's what the new world order is
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:59.320]  they're converting everything to private contractors and private takeovers
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.360]  of highways and water and infrastructure that we as
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.480]  taxpayers paid for and then they jack up the prices
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:09.320]  once they've been basically given the infrastructure it isn't privatization
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:14.040]  it's robbery it's the corporations becoming government
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:20.280]  and being unaccountable uh let's talk to vernon in chicago you're on the air
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:24.840]  hey hey alexa i'm actually enjoying listening to your show um but i do have a
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:30.200]  quick question though um well actually on on one of your films i
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.720]  forgot which one it was towards i don't know if it's towards the end of the film
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.880]  but it's but it mentioned something about a higelian dialectic
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:41.800]  and i've seen and before i've seen a youtube video that
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:45.080]  i guess it explains a little bit of it but i don't know
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:50.200]  exactly or clearly of what that tactic is or what media tactic is are you
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:54.600]  talking about the the uh it was a rant i did about
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:58.600]  two three years ago and then we took it and animated it
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:03.160]  uh in the film as an extra i believe it's the obama deception it may be fall
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:06.440]  the republic i forget but it's an extra where i exposed the
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:11.240]  left right paradigm and show how if the system could control the republicans
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.520]  and the democrats that they can lean on each other
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:19.080]  because even if one gets taken out of power
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:22.280]  they still share power on the other side of the structure
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:26.200]  so they basically prop each other up and that was just a
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.520]  analogy that i was giving oh okay well actually well i just wanted to add this
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.080]  to since you answered a question uh what was it
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:36.920]  is was the same thing with uh when beck brought in
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:41.720]  i forgot he brought in somebody for a show i guess this was another extra
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:45.480]  or this might have been a towards the end of uh the police state for
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:49.080]  about glenn beck and i guess this was about uh the i guess the phony
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.560]  femicamps that he was going to bring up old videos
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:57.240]  was that part of it well no that's a straw man argument uh where
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:01.720]  someone will say alex jones says kill cops
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.760]  and everybody says man that alex jones is bad
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:09.640]  that's a straw man i didn't say kill police i said the opposite
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:13.720]  but they put media reports out saying alex likes joe stack
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.160]  flying the plane into the building uh you know alex
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:21.640]  influence the guy that killed the cops in pittsburgh that's a straw man instead of
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.360]  attacking alex jones they create a fake alex jones
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:31.000]  and put statements in his mouth as a way of demonizing me and what glenn beck
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.600]  does is of the hundreds of admitted femicamps the congressional reports
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:40.760]  the model states health emergency powers act which is trying to get funding for
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:43.880]  what has already been built i mean you read that report you see the full
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:47.000]  architecture it's exactly what we analyzed years ago
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.680]  instead he goes and shows the famous you know train station that isn't a femicamp
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:58.280]  and then discredits the entire movement by looking at that piece of disinfo
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:03.080]  so that's a straw man system okay so i get it so i guess what this has come to
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:07.080]  um because it was another interview i guess this is from someone you had on
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.240]  this show that you know i don't know if it was a
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.160]  sheriff uh from arizona that you put that you had on recently
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.800]  he was on a local show and i guess the um the anchor
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:21.960]  said it oh you've been on a you've been on a wife supremacist show you've been
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:25.240]  on a alex jones show just to try to um
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:29.240]  put the word if that's another straw man that's exactly what they did on
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:33.480]  national news and on two different tv stations in arizona
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.680]  interviewing him we played that a few weeks ago they would say you're on
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:40.200]  white supremacist shows you're on alex jones show
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:44.200]  so technically they're talking about a separate white supremacist show because
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.920]  he's done hundreds that he went on and didn't know
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:50.760]  but then they say you've been on white supremacist you've been on alex jones
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:55.080]  so semantically what they said is true this is two different shows
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:16:01.800]  but they're now implying i'm a white supremacist that's a straw man
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:05.480]  i would like to appreciate your help me answer my questions though keep up the
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:09.080]  good work verna and i appreciate your call i mean i mean look it's another
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:13.080]  straw man to send democratic party operatives
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:16.280]  who've organized in public in washington state
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:20.680]  and texas and kentucky and new york they've all been caught in the last year
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.520]  over and over again every couple of weeks new groups get caught
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.880]  where conservatives libertarians patriots go to their meetings
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.560]  they have meet-up groups and others and they say meet us at this coffee shop
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.920]  and and then there'll be five or six or ten depending on the meeting people and
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.320]  they go okay we're going to the to the tea party
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:41.160]  and we're going to dress up uh you know like tea party people we're going to
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.800]  call black people in hispanic's names and we're going to act real stupid
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:49.080]  and then they've been caught in albuquerque new mexico is another big
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.400]  case with swastika signs saying we are the tea party
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:17:00.120]  we hate black people we hate inwards inward inward inward inward inward inward
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.600]  so that and then the news will go with them and show it
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:09.480]  and then say on the news that was the tea party and that's another straw man
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:14.760]  and they just do this over and over and over and again but now because of the
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:19.560]  internet they're getting caught they're getting exposed
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:22.760]  and so that's why they want to start shutting down alternative media because
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:25.640]  we can point out their lives now they're still playing the old game from
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.520]  decades ago when there was an internet and there was no real alternative
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.320]  media to counter them all right let's go to uh

[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:09.560]  just a program note that i'm going back to your calls a bunch of news coming up
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:12.920]  the next segment with your calls later in the next hour i'm going to play a
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:16.520]  six and a half minute clip that just surfaced on youtube
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:20.840]  and i know where it came from because it's an interview of yours truly
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:24.760]  back in january of this year they said chris mathews wants to come interview you
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:29.240]  in your office and i said okay bring it bring it on
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:33.240]  and then the day before they showed up they said well he is in houston but
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:36.520]  he's not going to come now he basically chickened out
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:40.600]  so they sent his producer and i was sitting right here
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:44.040]  being interviewed their camera was there they interviewed me for about an hour
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:48.440]  and a half she saw in the drawer over here a 357 magnum
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:52.280]  this is my office i own it i'm going to defend my staff
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:55.560]  we got a couple concealed carry people that work here i encourage them to
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.920]  you know wear their side arms because we're not slaves
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:04.520]  armed men are free men but that isn't the video clip maybe they'll release more
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:08.520]  but they've released six minutes and it's not from msnbc
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:13.000]  it says msnbc on it but it's like somebody leaked it or something
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.160]  because they only took a few clips out of context to kind of make me sound crazy
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:20.600]  they weren't too effective but you'll actually get to see and hear
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:23.800]  what at least six and a half minutes of an hour and a half
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:27.880]  of what i really said to him but i the woman was sitting right here
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.720]  i'm facing her you'll see the shot later when we play it next hour
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:35.640]  and i'm not kidding she began to get tears in her eyes and start having
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:39.240]  trouble breathing like she'd seen freddie krueger and
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:43.720]  i thought she was about to pass out i said are you okay hun and she said is that
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:51.320]  a good good good she was british is that a good good good good good gun
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:54.600]  and i said oh yeah right over here it's a revolver it's a best firearm even if
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.680]  you're good with a more complex handgun a
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.600]  more high-capacity semi-auto a revolver's best when you're under stress
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:06.600]  it's a seven-shot 357 magnum ruger and and she was
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:13.400]  oh i'm sorry i just you'll see one i wish they'd release that
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:16.520]  you know to have a record i always record interviews with mainstream media with
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:19.880]  an audio recorder we've got that file on erin's
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.080]  computer we ought to play that someday but i was only going to play it if they
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.960]  really butchered what i had to say or really twisted it and they
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:29.320]  they did to a certain extent but we'll play that six and a half minute clip
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:32.120]  coming up in the next hour we're going to post that particular youtube video that
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:36.360]  we just discovered matt ryan found it i just came out yesterday at
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:39.960]  info wars dot com and prison punnet dot com right now i just gave it to curtain
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:44.280]  him on a post but let's go to tom in connecticut
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:50.040]  you're on the air tom it was great here in that last caller running for sheriff
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:55.240]  back in 1991 when i was 27 years old i decided that i was going to run for
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:59.640]  congress so in 1992 i got my name on the ballot
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:05.080]  i ran as an independent and i actually got 16 39 000 votes
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:08.920]  campaigning against the builder burgers in the trial hour commission in the
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:13.080]  council on foreign relations in the federal reserve
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:16.280]  so anyway it's it's more important to run for local office though
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:20.280]  we definitely need to take our local offices back look if we get the patriots
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:25.080]  to stop obsessing on sarah palin's uh fishnet stockings
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:30.040]  and take our eyes off of her well i'll just leave it at that
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:34.760]  and focus on really getting involved locally we'll take this country back
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:39.320]  yeah it starts at at the bottom our local offices we got to take all our
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.880]  local offices back and work our way up
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:45.800]  now um i want to talk about the issue of gold
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:52.600]  and money and i sometimes like last couple weeks with bob chatman was on it
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:56.120]  he said that we need a gold backed monetary system and that's not true at
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:59.240]  all and i i know you agree with that but i wish you'd be
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:05.240]  well look i want to be clear here's the deal we'll have somebody on who's pro-israel
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:09.480]  uh you know the most extreme policies it doesn't mean i agree with them
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:14.120]  or i'll have general hamed gul on uh you know that doesn't mean i'm a muslim
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:17.400]  we're getting a high powered guest view on things
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:21.000]  or i'll have somebody on who's bashing israel to the hilt
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.280]  uh that doesn't mean i agree with you know some of their extreme views i'm
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:31.000]  here to bring a lot of different ideas in but i really respect bob chatman
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  and he's saying if we have a gold back currency that the government controls
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.640]  that and that's what we had until you know the the federal reserve took over
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.240]  that you wouldn't allow these money changers to manipulate things
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:46.280]  but i understand the other argument that the central banks
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:49.800]  have used paper money to hoard most the gold they know it's really valuable
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:53.160]  that they're the biggest owners of it by far and so they're going to be able to
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:56.520]  manipulate that system so why get rid of one fiat system
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:00.360]  to replace it with a hard currency system that they can manipulate
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:04.520]  my point is let's get rid of the federal reserve put it back under congress
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.440]  where it's supposed to be under the constitution and then have a big debate
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:11.640]  about that and that's why i promote the film
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:15.240]  let me find it here uh the secret of ours
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:19.320]  uh by bill still who also made the money masters
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:24.120]  and you know i i like his federal fiat money system
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:27.560]  because it's highly controlled and transparent stay there i want you to
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:31.800]  be able to finish your point tom then i'm gonna hurry to daniel tom
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:35.640]  victor frank and others but stay there tom and connect with tom and michigan
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:39.400]  and others but by the way uh this this film has your perspective and really
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:42.040]  well thought out so we're just putting all the alternative
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:45.880]  ideas out there to have a larger debate dvds available

[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:26.760]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:30.680]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:33.800]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose

[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:27.800]  11 times total but several times we've done multiple search terms
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:33.800]  for a total of 14 number one and number two search terms yesterday
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:38.440]  kill web that linked our story about the plan to kill the internet as we know it

[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.880]  headline began about him being a cia creation and asset
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:50.280]  today because bilgerberg's back in the news with fidel castrow talking about
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:53.480]  the new world order and world government and it being in time magazine and
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:57.000]  every a whole bunch of other publications literally scores of them

[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:22.040]  another way to feed this into the search engines is to take this article by

[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:31.640]  both the prison planet and info war link and in it

[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:23.960]  castro talking about it i mean this is becoming really
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:28.600]  mainstream but in our films we shadow the left right paradigm and show how
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:33.080]  fascism on the far false right and communism on the control false left
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:36.920]  are controlled by the globalist so search the term

[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:36.440]  and we got bob chappan coming up uh going back to tom in connecticut
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:39.640]  tom i'll i'll raise your question to bob chappan
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:43.000]  who i really respect about whether it should be a gold back currency or a
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:46.280]  fiat back currency regardless congress should control it
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.480]  they are respond you know they are elected by the people
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:52.520]  that's our constitution we've gotten in trouble for getting away with it
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:56.440]  uh so uh and you know allowing them to get away with all of this and allowing
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:00.120]  them uh to to to control the private system
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:03.480]  we've got to take control and not let them get away
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:07.240]  we're taking control of our side uh our society so tom in connecticut
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:13.480]  what is the question that you want to be asked of bob chappan specifically
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:17.880]  well not that i really have a specific question but webster tarpoli on his show
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:21.720]  about three or four weeks ago uh mentioned
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:26.440]  that all money is fiat in fact if you go to youtube you can hear this clip
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:32.360]  just put in all money is fiat in youtube and you'll hear webster on his show
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:36.280]  well i don't specifically totally agree with that i mean if you really
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:41.240]  limit it to just gold that's not fiat it's a commodity that has an intrinsic
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:47.720]  industrial and uh jewelry value but money is an invention of humans and
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:51.960]  webster sums it up in that clip on youtube all money is fiat well i agree to a
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:55.960]  certain extent that's true yeah gold is just a rock you can't eat it
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:59.720]  you can't make clothes out of it you can't use it for shelter which
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:02.840]  you know food clothing and shelter of three basics of human survival
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:06.200]  yeah well money's been good and bad i mean it gets us past barter allows people
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:09.720]  to engage in trade it's when you allow money to be manipulated you have the
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:13.400]  problem well george wikersberry show that comes on just
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:17.240]  before your show on genesis mere um
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:19.800]  ellen brown with her book the web of debt
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:23.480]  and bill still with his movies those three people right there are
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:28.120]  right at the very tip of the spear of how we attack
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.720]  the debt money bankers no tom tom listen i hear you and i appreciate your call i
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:34.040]  gotta move along i'll bring it up to bob Chapman
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.720]  i've had that lady on calling for the dakota style bank
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:43.880]  uh and of course i've had mr still on and we're just we know we don't want the
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:47.640]  private fellow reserve with undue trade advantage running our whole
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:50.840]  society and getting us into debt by design
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:55.480]  and goldman sacks selling timber wool stock knowing it's pure
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:59.000]  well they called it a cuss word pure sh
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:06.040]  bleep tea we know that but the issue here is i'm just having a full spectrum
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:10.280]  debate about it and and and people get hung up on this a lot they're like
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:14.600]  well you had a guest on saying that the flu isn't going to be a crisis in
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:17.320]  april but then a month later you had a guest on
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:23.000]  thinking it was going to be a crisis exactly this is a
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.440]  three-hour radio show weekdays two hours on sundays
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:31.240]  this is not like i religious uh where everything is one way and i i tell
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:34.680]  guests before they come on this is what you can and can't talk about
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:38.280]  we don't do that we just have larger debates about it
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:40.920]  uh but i do understand the points you're making and we'll bring it up to bob
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.960]  Chapman hey you want to see what bill still has to say we got the movie it's
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:46.920]  incredibly well produced a lot of people been getting this the
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:50.920]  secret of us solutions for a broken economy available at info wars dot
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:53.160]  com in fact let me just read from the back
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:56.760]  could it be that symbols of monetary reform were embedded in the most beloved
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:59.960]  children's story of all time by the way bill still said on air i didn't know
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:02.760]  this that i told him about this he didn't know about it he didn't really
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.960]  believe it he went and looked it up and found that it was all true
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:11.000]  so see we're doing good work here and if i didn't go on on a limb to explain to
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  him that this was a best-selling play best-selling book
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.320]  uh a decade before the fellow reserve took over he wouldn't have known that
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:23.800]  the average person that sounds crazy that the uh wizard of Oz is about the
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:26.840]  fellow reserve and the private bankers before they even call it the fellow
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:29.640]  reserve but i know it was true so i said it
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:33.080]  he went and researched it and found that it was real truth is stranger than
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:37.640]  fiction could it be that symbols of
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:43.080]  monetary reform were embedded in the most beloved children's story of all time
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:47.000]  the wonderful wizard of Oz could it be that there were symbols point the way
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.400]  of our economic troubles today and of course the silver slippers
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:55.160]  are what save you from the gold monopoly because it's more plentiful
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:44:01.800]  and a better um metals-backed currency historically than gold
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:06.200]  what's the secret behind the wizard of Oz nations don't have to borrow money
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.360]  that's a right no more national debt it's the interest on the debt that's
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:13.480]  killing the the economy the solution is nothing radical
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:18.280]  abraham lincoln used it to win the civil war colonial america became prosperous
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:21.960]  by this method director bill still focuses on the populist movement
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:25.480]  of the late 1800s with williams jennings brian era
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:28.600]  when the monetary reformers were strongest right when the wonderful
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:32.760]  wizard of oz was written he offers the best solutions from these experts
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:37.960]  ellen browne byron dale joseph ferra professor michael hudson
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:42.600]  james robertson peter schiff professor quentin taylor and more
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:46.280]  very important film available at info wars dot com
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:52.040]  okay so yes i'm promoting that idea i tend to agree with you
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:56.360]  but at the same time i know that in the inflationary economy
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:45:02.280]  in the depreciation of currency gold is king so i believe in owning gold and
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:06.440]  it's gone up from 260 to 1200 and something right now i mean you can see
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:09.640]  in the last eight years good advice let's go now
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:14.520]  to daniel in washington dc daniel you're on the air
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:18.440]  hello there to you alex uh happy friday and thanks again for having me on
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:21.720]  having me back on how you feel that's great to have you sir what's on your
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:26.440]  mind well uh i just um i wanted to just really briefly
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:30.040]  just touch on the uh this this whole my situation really quick
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:35.000]  uh a good friend of mine she had uh posted an article from new york daily news
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.480]  dot com that and the and the headline appears to be
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:43.240]  they won't build it hard hats down not to work on controversial
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:46.120]  yeah i've gotten the story of the local unions are saying
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:49.640]  that mosque isn't getting built there and and and this is a big blow to property
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:51.960]  rights regardless of what you think about this
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:56.760]  this is a dangerous precedent uh and that's how it started in nazi germany
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:00.840]  where they wouldn't let jews have businesses and and and other groups
[01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:07.640]  and it's very very dangerous attack on uh the first amendment and property rights
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:10.680]  and i'm concerned but i but i'm telling this imam
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:14.360]  it's not going to help him that i now have found a video clip of him
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:19.000]  and i'm going to cover it later saying that america is sharia compliant
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.680]  uh and and and that's going to really make people even more angry
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:26.440]  uh and upset and i think he needs to know this is a fight
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:31.000]  he's going to lose and he's giving his attackers a lot of ammo
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.080]  he ought to look for another location because pragmatically they're going to
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:39.800]  lose this thing but go ahead you know absolutely and i think i
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:43.320]  i didn't go as in depth as you as you just did but i mean i just pretty much
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:46.760]  i left her a comment on it on on the post or whatever and i pretty much
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:50.440]  succinctly sort of went through it if i can just briefly it's not very long
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:54.120]  go ahead just wanted to okay um so i commented i said
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:56.920]  i don't think the federal government has the right to interfere with private
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:59.080]  property amongst the myriad of other things they
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:03.720]  interfere with in this country and we do still have freedom of religion here
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:07.160]  and quite frankly i i think we all need to grow up and do some research
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:10.680]  educate ourselves and stop being afraid start talking about
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:14.920]  and and and ask us some serious questions about 9-11 anyway
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:18.120]  on the other side of the coin since it appears most of our country citizens
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:22.200]  have not awoke to these truths yet then i do feel it is very provocative to do
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:25.480]  this with little regard to people's sensitivities about this issue
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:29.400]  it needlessly stirs unnecessary tension and infighting among we the people
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:32.840]  and provides a divisive and convenient socio-political distraction for the
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:36.360]  owners of this country to capitalize on and the owners of this country alex
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:39.720]  you know as you know you you being a fellow carlin fan i believe
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:42.760]  you are you know that's actually referred to to these
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:45.960]  to these global sensitive owners of this country
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.320]  because the owners of this country don't want you to be educated that's why
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:53.080]  education will never be fixed the more money we spend the dumber we get
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:57.400]  because the owners once you dumb down and and and barely treading water
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:02.520]  i appreciate your call great points uh from daniel in washington dc
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:06.440]  give me a document cam shot gentlemen since he raised this issue i'll cover
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:10.440]  it briefly now and then go back to calls uh here it is ground zero
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:14.280]  emom says america is sharia compliant
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:18.120]  country and we have that video clip uh it's from
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:21.080]  c-span will play that next hour when bob Chapman's on
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:24.920]  and get his take on it uh here's another one the ground zero mosque and
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:27.800]  property rights excellent article out today by curtain
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:31.960]  emo that really breaks down the fact that the majority of americans in a
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:34.760]  poll say they don't want it built there and want it to be stopped
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:39.160]  well you don't want your rights either then do you look i don't like white
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:43.160]  supremacist in their free speech but i've got to defend it or all lose mine
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:47.640]  i don't like mecha and la raza saying for those in our race everything for
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:51.400]  those outside the race nothing but they're allowed to say that
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:55.320]  i don't like some of those new black panther party people that make the old
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:58.120]  black panther party that did some good actually in the 60s really heard what
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:03.640]  they said about about freedom uh they make um
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:06.920]  the old black panthers look bad you know they're out saying you know get the
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:10.840]  whiteies kill the whiteies that borders on the fire in a theater when you start
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:14.440]  saying kill a group then they need to be questioned because now you're you know
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:17.640]  i mean if i got up here and said go after and kill somebody i should get in trouble
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:21.560]  so that that group's going a little overboard but if you don't support
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:24.120]  somebody's free speech for them you're not going to have it
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:28.200]  here's the surreal law clip this is why
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:32.360]  the third chapter in my book is what is right with america
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:35.480]  and to show that what's right with america what's right with islam
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:42.760]  are in fact very much in sync seven centuries ago one of the most important
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:48.600]  jurists said all of sharia law is basically the fulfillment of five
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:52.360]  fundamental human rights the right to life
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:55.960]  the right to freedom of religion the right to family
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:00.440]  the right to property and the right to what is called and the muslim law
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:06.600]  mental well-being now how similar is this to the american declaration of
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:10.600]  independence which declares that we were created
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:16.040]  equal all men meaning men and women were created equal
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:20.440]  endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:24.120]  among which among which not all but among which
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:29.720]  are life liberty and pursuit of happiness which was originally property
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:34.440]  now when you look at when you unpack the concepts and ideas this way
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:38.440]  you will see this is why i call america a sharia compliant
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:43.160]  state okay that is going to be used against
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:47.320]  him because if you look at sharia law the way it's interpreted in saudi arabia
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:53.000]  or in sudan i don't i'm definitely against that so
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:51:00.840]  this guy really isn't a lot of trouble now okay we'll be right back
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:04.360]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:07.720]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:11.480]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:14.120]  than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:17.160]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:19.880]  even happen again so our friends at solutions from

[02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:55.960]  an hour before and then twenty five minutes before on two bbc channels
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:04:00.840]  and cnn uh... we know that norad stood down there were drills of the exact same
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:04.840]  targets being attacked that day we know the supposed hijackers were us double
[02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:08.600]  agents trained at military bases newsweek ap roiders
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:12.120]  and every time we know six of the ten commissioners say it's a cover-up three
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:13.640]  of the five lawyers
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:17.640]  on the commission so we know they had the pre-tax we know peenak
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:21.000]  called for terror attacks as a pre-tax we know our government staged terror
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.320]  attacks before but specifically
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:28.920]  in any black op they've got all the smoke screens so they can get away with it
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:32.360]  they've got all the confusion they've got drills running so in case their agents
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:35.240]  get caught by other branches of the government they say it's part of the
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:38.440]  drill it's part of that artificial fog of war
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:41.960]  so we don't know but there was some chicanery in pennsylvania
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:45.960]  at at nasa bases and planes being switched with the same tail numbers

[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:38.120]  know where it came from a listener sent it to us
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:43.160]  on facebook of the behind the scenes interview from msnbc's cameras they
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:46.760]  edited it all together in that tea party special where they try to do a hit piece
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:50.120]  on myself and ran paul but this is six minutes of the hour and a half
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:52.600]  interview we actually get to hear what i really said
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:55.640]  and i don't know where this came from or who got it
[02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:59.000]  probably somebody inside msnbc so that'll be interesting

[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:53.240]  in the info war okay uh going to bob bob you had just called in we're on hold
[02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:57.160]  while the guy was talking i bleeped over uh to the uh network and said is bob
[02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:00.120]  there and they said yeah so you obviously heard the guy's question
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:05.320]  about why would gold dealers sell gold and but i want to answer this my own way
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:09.960]  and to see what you say why would gold dealer sell gold for paper if it's
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:13.240]  worthless and i'm not mad at the listener but it's so
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:17.640]  elementary that it frustrates me i mean let's say if i was a
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:20.920]  stockbroker and i had some gold that had gone from two hundred and sixty five
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:24.360]  dollars an ounce eight years ago to one thousand two hundred and forty something
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:28.200]  today well if i wanted to be a stockbroker
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:31.640]  could spend the time doing that and i'm not stupid i learned how markets work i
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:34.280]  could probably do okay i mean you actually study the globalist
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:37.640]  what they do rather than what their pundits say it's it's a piece of cake
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:43.000]  many experts have explained to me but i could then
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:47.080]  estimate and and read the trade publications and figure out that
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:50.920]  uh there's going to be higher earnings say for apple
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:55.400]  and this is just speculation i mean they're not even speculation this is
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:59.160]  just a case point example or or let's say the stock's going to go up in john
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:02.760]  doe company you know totally hypothetical
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:07.160]  and then i could buy the stock knowing it was going up to make a profit
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:10.680]  and then get paper back from that and then go buy gold
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:14.600]  what i'm saying is i physically hold gold
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:17.560]  and and i have gold's you know sponsor mitis
[02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:21.240]  and i take a little bit of that sponsor money that i end up getting most of it
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:24.360]  probably 95 percent goes into this operation and i end up buying a few
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:28.280]  coins here and there every few months mainly silver but some gold
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:32.280]  so it's crazy to not understand this we're in this
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:39.240]  fiat system and so we exchange fiat for gold but the way the gold broker makes
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:42.760]  money is they're smart and buy gold when it's low
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:46.200]  and then sell it when it's high just like it's the stock market
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:49.960]  but what ted does he isn't greedy that's why he's grown so much
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:55.480]  is he buys when it's low knowing the stock market manipulations and plunge
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:58.600]  protection team manipulations he buys when it's low
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:01.240]  i mean he knew it was only going to go up like a beach ball you can't hold it
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:04.600]  down three weeks ago when it went down he bought a bunch of gold and silver
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:09.720]  now it goes back up he sells it at the low price he bought it
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:13.480]  with his little markup involved and it's an incredible deal
[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:18.040]  now in the market because it's gone way up i mean it's so elementary and then
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:21.960]  ted himself i know as a gold bug he then takes profits he makes puts it in the
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:25.800]  network puts it in his gold company but also spends on his house his car
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:29.960]  you know buying his son who's in the army of you know a iphone
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:33.560]  like he told me he did i mean it's it's it's so elementary
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:37.800]  but people don't seem to understand that bob can you explain it to him
[02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:42.120]  i'm speechless you've done the whole thing
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:46.360]  well there's nothing for me to add i i was thinking of the extension
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:48.920]  of what does the deal would do with the money that
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:55.000]  species that fdr the fed reserve note and you explain that and he
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.720]  takes it he buys more inventory so he's back into gold and silver again
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:02.920]  and then he puts money in his pocket for his salary and the salary of his
[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:07.400]  employees and they in turn spend the money within the economy because it's
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:13.240]  legal tender and so i think we've really really covered it
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:16.680]  well i mean it's it's so simple also see
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:22.760]  last night in the coffee room they had ms nbc with keith overman on and he was
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:27.640]  doing a whole segment demonizing people that sell gold as if it's dirty and
[02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:31.240]  bad they're the ones pushing the fiat currency
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:34.760]  that's competing against a real commodity a real
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:39.000]  asset that has intrinsic value and it's completely backwards
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.760]  for them to be demonizing gold it's it's just like how they demonize
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:46.840]  the bill of rights it's good they're bad
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:50.680]  well this just shows you the propaganda arm
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:55.640]  that the major networks are it's just as simple as that it's just like the 95
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:13:59.800]  percent truth and the five percent uh... misdirection
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:05.880]  propaganda mind blowing mindwashing uh... brainwashing
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:10.440]  and that's what it is and that's what he's up to and we've discussed this
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:15.080]  about others including glenn beck they mislead people and the people say well
[02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:19.480]  gee that must be right because mom was everything i heard him say
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:24.360]  seemed okay and proper for me so maybe he's telling us the truth about gold
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:28.520]  i just saw the same thing on cnbc while i was waiting for you
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:32.520]  they had a trade of their attacking gold
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:37.080]  unbelievable but you you have to expect that
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:41.160]  because they're running scared you talked earlier about
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:47.560]  the bill de berger films okay well fidel castro
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:51.480]  came out today well maybe it was yesterday but today they i got the piece on
[02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:56.200]  it and said the bill de berger berger group is bad
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:01.000]  he's going to great detail but he said he read danie eslin's book
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.720]  unbeknownst to everybody out there fidel castro is a subscriber
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:11.880]  to the international forecaster that's how he knows
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:18.440]  well i tell you i don't like communist but of all the communist out there
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:21.880]  fidel castro has definitely been the one that the bankers don't like
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:24.840]  it looks like he's the one that got away i mean we it's admitted that they
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:28.840]  helped put him in power then they wanted to use that as a pretext to invade
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:33.080]  and fully take over and he got away from him
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:36.920]  now i think that's true and uh... uh...
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:40.920]  i i know for sure that how it all started out
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:44.600]  was and i don't know whether these were instructions from
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:49.800]  the central intelligence agency or not but i do know from the players themselves
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:53.000]  that the mob was the ones that financed him
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:58.200]  and got him his guns and etc etc because they were disturbed with batista
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:01.880]  and they weren't they were being cheated out of their cut
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:05.240]  and uh... i get the straight from people who were involved
[02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:08.840]  well it's it's been declassified partially i don't know
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:13.320]  i mean it's been partially declassified that the west did help him get into power
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:17.560]  and then he basically double-crossed them
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:21.960]  now that's what they've said we do we we really don't know the innards but
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:25.960]  um... it certainly wasn't the way it was presented
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:28.760]  it's just like your commentary on nine eleven
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:32.920]  just a few minutes ago not the way it was presented they're lying
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:36.600]  they're all lying and when you lie you have something to cover up you've
[02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:40.360]  done something that you shouldn't have done
[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:44.440]  well said bob uh... i i want to get into the latest economic developments and
[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:47.320]  the mosque at ground zero and get your take on a bunch of issues and take some
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:51.240]  more calls but briefly we had a caller last hour who called in and he said
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:55.720]  alex i'm confused you got bob Chapman on and i could
[02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:59.960]  add ron paul who promote goldback currency controlled by congress
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:04.760]  but then you promote bill still who i really respect as well the secret of
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:09.080]  us saying we could have a fiat currency that congress
[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:12.520]  control like abraham lincoln and george washington and others had
[02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:16.920]  and i simply said look this is a college of ideas we all want liberty we all
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:19.880]  want freedom we want to get rid of the bernie made off
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:24.120]  ken lay types that run the federal reserve uh... but
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:27.080]  the point is it's for the people in the congress to decide
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:31.480]  what the monetary system is but regardless in this fiat system
[02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:34.040]  you want to be in gold and silver because it can protect you more than
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:37.640]  anything else uh... so i just don't understand how people get confused by
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:41.240]  different ideas being put out here but in a nutshell in about two minutes
[02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:44.840]  as we got a break you've got the floor uh... what is your position on the
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:48.600]  monetary system that we should have
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:52.280]  we should have a system where the united states government
[02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:56.680]  issues currency that is backed by either gold or silver or both
[02:17:56.680 --> 02:18:00.840]  and the reason why is every time you have a fiat currency
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:04.600]  the people within the system particularly wall street and banking
[02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:09.240]  abuse it they're greedy there's not enough power for them out there
[02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:13.640]  they have to have more they have to control people they need a new world
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:16.200]  order they need a one-world government
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:19.720]  and we don't need any of that and if you make
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:23.560]  the currency backed by gold in particular and it doesn't have to be a
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:27.480]  hundred percent it can be fifteen or twenty five percent
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:33.080]  i mean when the euro started out it was fifteen percent is down to about seven
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:39.560]  now when you issue money that is based
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:44.200]  on the history of monies that have been
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:49.080]  put out before like us notes first of all
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:54.440]  when they use continental during the late 1700s
[02:18:54.440 --> 02:18:58.360]  they fell into disuse uh... there was a saying
[02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:01.800]  uh... as worthless as a continental or something like that
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:05.880]  it was unbacked money and every time you have unbacked money you get a problem
[02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:10.280]  it caused a lot of instability runs on banks things like that
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:14.440]  but it allows the bankers in this case the fed reserve
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:20.600]  to issue as much money as you please and you've just seen this in spades
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:24.040]  here in the last three years and then they want to back it with your tax money
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:27.720]  to give it some value and then you have to turn around and pay
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:31.480]  all the debt they created well i tell all their
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:35.480]  inside friends what's going on and they beat people to death in the stock
[02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:37.800]  market yeah it's a very complex issue and there's
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:39.880]  definitely two different ways to look at it
[02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:42.920]  and i see your point i respect dr paul's point
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:46.520]  i see ben still's point if we had true transparency in control of our government
[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:51.480]  and a limited fiat currency would be okay but that money power always gets taken
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:55.720]  over by private interest finish up on that point then phone calls the economy
[02:19:55.720 --> 02:20:01.160]  they're announcing we want to go out for social security it's all coming up

[02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:08.200]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:21:08.200 --> 02:21:12.120]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:15.560]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:18.440]  it's true total government control of electricity
[02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:21.960]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[02:21:21.960 --> 02:21:25.560]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:29.480]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:33.080]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:36.120]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:11.400]  the information war continues it's alex jones
[02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:20.440]  and the gcn radio network
[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:24.200]  okay bob you got interrupted by the break there did you have anything else to add
[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:28.680]  about monetary policy because the issue is and i agree
[02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:32.440]  with you if you have a fiat currency it's open for manipulation and history
[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:36.440]  always is but bill still and others points
[02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:41.720]  about the money changers in in europe in the middle ages
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:45.560]  developing their original fraud system with gold
[02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:49.240]  but those were receipts on gold so maybe you should explain that to people so
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:53.640]  it's it's like darned if you do darned if you don't
[02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:58.040]  well i think you can stop that by not having a fractional banking system
[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:03.160]  and banks lending from what they have and if government wants more money in
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:08.120]  circulation they can do that if there's no federal reserve
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:11.960]  so they can create money and credit if they want to
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:17.000]  being backed by the currency itself so the currency is not leveraged
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.520]  it's the government that's leveraged well i agree with ron poll and i want to
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:24.200]  see what you say about this i think it should be a free for all
[02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:27.720]  any companies anybody they want can issue whatever they want
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:31.080]  junk bonds you name it but it's not going to be government backed
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:34.920]  and if you cheat people you're going to be civilly and criminally responsible to
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:37.800]  the grand juries of the states and then you'll have
[02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:43.080]  a competition of currencies gold silver paper
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:46.600]  asset backed and and and then what is truly
[02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:49.800]  bonafide like the swiss frank has always been for so long
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:54.440]  will come to the surface well that's another way of handling it and it's a
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:59.160]  good way uh we had that going on in america
[02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:02.920]  but uh the bankers uh were too powerful
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:10.040]  and uh the state's species uh disappeared and they the state used to
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:15.000]  issue their own currencies and they can be in any a combination of things
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:18.760]  um and as far as currency backing is concerned
[02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:24.680]  it does not have to be gold or silver it could be a basket of commodities
[02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:29.000]  so that's another thought people have put that idea forward over the
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.160]  over the years and so there's more more ways to approach it and
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:36.680]  so if we're going to do something along those lines
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:39.800]  we'll have a congress discuss what they want to do
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:44.120]  and input from the american people and hopefully what they will come up with
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:48.440]  would be very workable but take the power out of the hands
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:53.960]  of the federal reserve its owners the bankers and wall street
[02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:57.240]  good point bob i want to come back and take calls and get into some other news
[02:26:57.240 --> 02:27:00.760]  but on your radar screen since we talked last friday
[02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:04.680]  what is most pressing right now for me it's the wall street journal social
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:08.040]  security cuts weighed by panel and if you read the article basically they're
[02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:11.000]  getting ready to raise the retirement age and cut payments
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:15.160]  with the inflation that's going on boy this is going to make folks angry
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:20.040]  it surely is and i can see them uh raising the retirement age
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:24.440]  but i certainly don't think that they should cut back because
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:28.680]  they spent all the money and that started in 1935
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:32.520]  uh if the money has never been there they issued bonds which are worthless
[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:35.960]  and the bonds sit in some file cabinet someplace and
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:40.280]  Cincinnati and there's a couple of re repositories for them
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:46.280]  but you know it was an exercise in nothing i mean they created nothing they
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:51.560]  just took all the money and spent it so you know it was it was designed
[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:55.560]  as a security system but in fact was really a tax
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:59.320]  and the question is is the the other people going to put up with it
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:03.880]  and they can't put up with it i mean it's so that probably 60 70 percent
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:12.440]  of the population must say over 67 now is all totally dependent
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:16.840]  on their social security check and what are we going to do
[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:21.960]  have millions of people dying of starvation
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:25.160]  no they're going to raise taxes on the productive people
[02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:29.640]  steal most the money and then give a pittance to the old folks
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:33.720]  well as you saw they they for uh they have uh
[02:28:33.720 --> 02:28:41.480]  frozen the uh cola on uh social security for three years
[02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:45.320]  uh now it's two more years it was frozen during this years and we'll
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:48.760]  assume this year is relatively over and for those that don't know cola is
[02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:52.920]  cost of living increase and it's also used in private
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:57.720]  pensions and government pensions state pensions
[02:28:57.720 --> 02:29:01.800]  and it's very very misleading because it comes from
[02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:07.560]  the cpi figures and uh the cpi figures are so
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:11.640]  doctored they're meaningless i mean right now they're talking about
[02:29:11.640 --> 02:29:15.560]  a half or percent of one percent inflation when it's over seven percent
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:19.720]  john williams says it's eight and a quarter and he's probably right
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:24.520]  and so you know the people on social security and other pensions
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:27.240]  have been getting getting screwed for a long time
[02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:30.440]  bob when we come back i want to get into what's on your mind i brought up the
[02:29:30.440 --> 02:29:32.840]  points i wanted to raise then we'll take some phone calls

[02:32:03.400 --> 02:32:07.560]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:32:07.560 --> 02:32:11.800]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:32:11.800 --> 02:32:14.520]  much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:32:14.520 --> 02:32:18.760]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:23.240]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:32:23.240 --> 02:32:26.840]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:32:26.840 --> 02:32:30.680]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:34.040]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[02:32:34.040 --> 02:32:37.800]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:40.680]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:43.720]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:33:03.880 --> 02:33:23.080]  coming out alive live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:38.520]  all right going back to bob chatman bob i wanted to get
[02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:42.120]  your take on the mosque we've got a key report
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:46.200]  up at prison planet dot com and info wars dot com where steve watson really did
[02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:49.320]  deep research this guy's definitely a top globalist
[02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:52.920]  stooge uh and uh this looks like this whole thing
[02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:56.920]  was contrived as a way to at a primitive level make
[02:33:56.920 --> 02:34:00.280]  americans feel like you know the evil muslims at stage
[02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:05.560]  911 you know quote have revisited the scene and we need to head i ran
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:09.320]  uh just just just hyping this this islamophobia
[02:34:09.320 --> 02:34:12.920]  uh what's your view on it exactly the same and
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:18.920]  and i i think that it's also from a social viewpoint
[02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:22.520]  uh designed to drive a wedge between the muslim
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:28.280]  and the non muslim community and yes uh there are some things that
[02:34:28.280 --> 02:34:32.920]  they're asking for or demanding uh that are unreasonable and on the other
[02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:36.600]  hand uh other religions do the same thing and so
[02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:40.600]  uh there's no there's no question in my mind
[02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:44.840]  it was set up to be another reason why
[02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:49.240]  we should be in iran killing people
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:54.040]  so where do you see it going bob i don't think it's going to go much of
[02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:58.840]  anywhere i think a lot of people uh realize what they're up to
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:01.640]  uh people are getting more and more sophisticated because they're listening
[02:35:01.640 --> 02:35:05.560]  to these radio programs and reading the internet
[02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:09.800]  and they're getting a much different view than they had previously previously
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:13.320]  in things that they've been presented by the
[02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:18.280]  mainline meteor if you may and uh so they're taking a second look
[02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:22.040]  and and i think the situation was aggregated
[02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:25.640]  aggravated by all the different comments that were made
[02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:30.600]  and and that's it for the people who set this whole thing up in the first place
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:36.040]  another reason to go and start a war against iran
[02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:38.840]  bob i want to take a few calls and get into the economy with you and give
[02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:41.640]  folks the toll free number to get a free hard copy or digital copy of the
[02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:45.560]  international forecaster 30 40 pages several times a week and valuable
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:49.720]  intel but briefly any other key news on the economy
[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:53.160]  uh or the iran front that you want to comment on
[02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:56.920]  well as we broke the story six to seven weeks ago here
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:00.680]  uh when nobody else did uh i said that the
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:05.080]  the fed reserve uh because the congress wouldn't allocate any more stimulus
[02:36:05.080 --> 02:36:08.760]  money would spend probably five trillion dollars over
[02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:12.520]  the next two years uh taking the economy sideways because if
[02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:16.360]  they didn't the whole thing had collapsed and it's turning out that way
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:19.640]  uh they've already admitted that they're going to go in and
[02:36:19.640 --> 02:36:24.360]  buy uh treasuries as well as agencies the agencies of the bonds of
[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:30.520]  fanny freddy uh jenny and fha and they're going to be doing a lot of
[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:33.000]  other things that they're not going to tell you about
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.880]  because they don't tell the truth either and if you ask
[02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:41.720]  they say that um it's secret and uh and uh the united states government
[02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:45.720]  doesn't have to tell you that and they make like they're part of the government
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:52.120]  i thought was interesting uh and this is a just a side to that whole thing
[02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:59.640]  uh timothy geithner the treasury secretary uh
[02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:06.360]  has been told it has been told that he was a former member of goldman's tax
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:10.120]  and so now he swears up and down he wasn't but
[02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:13.720]  when asked what he was doing during that period with when he was supposed to be
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:17.720]  with goldman and the reason it's brought up because goldman's a revolving
[02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:21.480]  door for the treasury and other departments in government
[02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:27.240]  uh he was working for henry kissing uh which is probably worse
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:31.160]  i mean these people are dumber than dumb i mean they they must think we don't
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:37.320]  know anything out here but anyway um uh we see lots of
[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:41.800]  you know inflation coming because they're going to have to pump like mad
[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:45.160]  uh europe's gone in the opposite direction for the moment
[02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:48.200]  uh they're going to find out that once the
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:51.320]  euro stabilizes that they're going to have problems
[02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:56.040]  and i do expect more problems in greece uh i have a
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:38:00.600]  conglomeration of information uh in tomorrow's issue
[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:06.200]  on greece and i think we're probably several weeks away from rioting
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:11.160]  uh maybe even next week and next month which is like two weeks away
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:14.920]  and the reason why is the lots and lots of people are going to get laid off
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:21.320]  and permeant and uh in pyraeus uh unemployment 70 percent i mean it's
[02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:24.200]  astronomical and they've done everything wrong
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:28.040]  but it was done wrong deliberately and that's the globalist i mean i mean this
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:31.000]  is what they're going to do here if we let them get away with it
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:34.200]  you know who's running the country prime minister
[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:39.080]  popindrao who is he he's a bill de berger and he's an aluminist
[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:42.840]  and so they want to take the country down and this is a proving ground
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:46.200]  and i have an article for next wednesday i'm doing now
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:49.880]  just like spain was a proving ground for the nazis
[02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:54.360]  during the late 1930s during the civil war greece is going to be a proving
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:57.960]  ground for what they want to do to everybody else
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:02.360]  financially like an echo well said bob i i need to play this six minute clip
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:05.560]  because i promise to do it and i want to have you come back and comment on it

[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:32.360]  oh i already called him before but uh i didn't know that i'll let you go then
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:34.680]  frank i thought that that's who was on hold there
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:39.320]  sorry uh michael in south carolina michael you're on the air
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:42.920]  um or michelle i can't get anything straight today so
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:46.760]  hi alex you're my knight in shining armor you're a hero
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:54.040]  and stay healthy for us we need you um regarding mr chatman
[02:39:54.040 --> 02:39:58.760]  for people that live paycheck to paycheck and can't afford to
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:02.440]  buy gold and so on and so forth um what would
[02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:06.200]  mr uh chatman say to them regarding
[02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:10.200]  preparing themselves for the coming crisis
[02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:13.400]  and on something i want to touch on something that you were talking about
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:17.720]  earlier when you were talking about uh just briefly
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:22.600]  about you know um help me out here empire
[02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:28.040]  your movie um invisible empire far speech by
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:32.600]  james jones of the nsa um i tried to link that
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:36.760]  speech uh to some people on youtube that were
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:40.360]  arguing with me about that and it was not it was blocked
[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:43.720]  off of facebook there was a mention in that at
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:49.080]  the end of the article where uh mr jones said that his top priority above
[02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:51.320]  terrorism but everything else is going to be
[02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:54.840]  cyber security yeah that's taken the web over that's
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:58.760]  a bob chat and any comments on what michelle's saying
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:04.200]  no no i i'm i i'm not up to speed on what she's talking but she's also asking
[02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:07.000]  what can somebody paycheck to paycheck do
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:11.080]  well i can answer that very very quickly um you should put
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:15.240]  away canned goods that you normally use and rotate them
[02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:18.440]  so that you have an inventory of things to eat
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:22.120]  in case things get difficult if you can afford to
[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:26.440]  buy dehydrated and freeze dried foods and get a water filter it's very
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:30.120]  important and of course hopefully in your household
[02:41:30.120 --> 02:41:34.680]  you have some sort of a device that you can defend your family with
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:38.120]  and those are the fundamental most important things
[02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:42.040]  that you can do and people all over the country are doing it
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:45.720]  and particularly people in florida yeah that way you're not dependent on this
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:47.560]  florida that way you're not dependent on the system of it and
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:50.920]  blows um michelle god bless you thanks for calling

[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:03.000]  only had one question but um as far as economy and
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:06.760]  what's valuable probably the only valuable assets
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:11.080]  commodity and whole planet is people and that's my opinion
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:15.160]  and whatever it were has control over the money has control over the people
[02:42:15.160 --> 02:42:19.560]  we already know that but my question was

[02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:38.840]  which then created the federal government but according to the federal
[02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:43.720]  definitions i would be one of their u.s citizens
[02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:50.360]  yeah u.s citizen has no rights american has all the rights and as those

[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:05.560]  oppress you we've got to take our government back to block them from
[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:09.240]  using the leverage and the mechanisms of government to engage in their
[02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:16.280]  raping without question
[02:43:16.280 --> 02:43:20.120]  well that was a brief response to it bob let's jam
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:22.920]  one more call and then i've got to quickly go to this video clips we have
[02:43:22.920 --> 02:43:28.600]  time to play it uh this missing uh msnbc video where they
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:31.320]  interviewed me and it's now service on the web we don't know where it came from
[02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:33.480]  but this is what didn't make it in the tv show
[02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:38.680]  what i really said uh quickly uh billy in vegas quick comment or question
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:41.640]  hello alex yeah i just want to let you know what's happening here in vegas
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:44.920]  and excuse me i'm making sandwiches in my sub job while i'm talking to you
[02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:48.360]  but uh we had a deal we had a nine eleven truth meetup group
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:52.600]  about six months ago we dropped the ball and some guy came in took it over the
[02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:56.280]  website never no one ever heard of them no one ever saw them never came to a
[02:43:56.280 --> 02:43:59.320]  meeting and uh right away he puts up he's
[02:43:59.320 --> 02:44:02.440]  there to make sure that no one falls for conspiracy theories
[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:06.680]  yeah that happened in austin they they they send operatives in to
[02:44:06.680 --> 02:44:09.800]  try to take over the nine eleven truth groups so just go start a new website
[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:12.440]  a new group and don't fall for it again
[02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:15.720]  oh i didn't listen i i wrote out an idea to everybody
[02:44:15.720 --> 02:44:19.000]  and that says dear nine eleven truth member it is apparent to me and others
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.400]  that matt chris and blur are guardians and
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:24.840]  protectors of the government's official conspiracy theory and lie
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:28.600]  as these traders listen i gotta let you go i i i don't know about these local
[02:44:28.600 --> 02:44:30.360]  issues so i can't confirm what you're saying
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:34.920]  here he is the video clip it's up on info wars dot com and full will come back
[02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:39.880]  with bob Chapman stay with us self as an aggressive constitutionalist that means
[02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:42.200]  that i believe in the constitution the bill of
[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:46.280]  rights liberty and freedom and justice and i've studied history i've
[02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:49.640]  studied the writings the founding fathers and it's clear you need to
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:53.320]  aggressively defend liberty and freedom or you'll lose it i mean how many times
[02:44:53.320 --> 02:44:56.280]  did george washington and thomas jefferson say that
[02:44:56.280 --> 02:45:00.440]  and so that's why i described myself as an aggressive constitutionalist
[02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:03.720]  uh people try to describe me as a libertarian and i do agree with a lot of
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:08.280]  libertarian ideas and thoughts but again that is
[02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:12.200]  another label that the media can twist and stereotype
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:15.400]  i really am somebody who believes in limited government
[02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:19.480]  private property and freedom and the bill of rights and constitution so that's
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:22.280]  why i describe myself as an aggressive constitutionalist
[02:45:22.280 --> 02:45:25.720]  is because i aggressively defend the bill of rights and constitution
[02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:29.800]  because it's very goldwater said extremism and defensive liberty is no
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:32.520]  vice my entire work is about shattering the
[02:45:32.520 --> 02:45:36.680]  left-right paradigm uh 150 years ago people didn't talk
[02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:40.680]  about left or right they talked about freedom versus tyranny
[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:45.480]  and tyranny all its forms and how the people as populist
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:49.080]  need to take control of their own destiny by controlling their governments
[02:45:49.080 --> 02:45:52.200]  and so i describe myself as a follower of the magna carta
[02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:55.480]  of the declaration of independence the bill of rights and constitution
[02:45:55.480 --> 02:45:59.720]  the left-right system is a way to artificially divide the people
[02:45:59.720 --> 02:46:03.800]  and play them off against each other while the real power structure continues
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:07.080]  on with their policies of world government
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:11.400]  and so i'm against the global corporate state known as the new world order
[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:16.280]  that has been set up that uses the left-right paradigm
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:19.640]  to control the population to keep the population from ever really having a
[02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:23.880]  serious debate it's the people versus the power
[02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:26.360]  structure it's been like that throughout history
[02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:29.960]  so that's how i describe myself is someone trying to get the people
[02:46:29.960 --> 02:46:33.560]  to open up their minds to get outside the box to get outside the whole left
[02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:36.840]  right debate and really look at the power structure in america
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:40.840]  and worldwide and the systemic continued
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:45.560]  loss of freedom that we see happening so i don't describe myself as a right
[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:50.600]  winger or as a left winger big government enslave
[02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:55.560]  big government destroys and big government annihilates the individual
[02:46:55.560 --> 02:46:58.280]  i mean even with a small government it's hard for the individual to have
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:00.200]  liberty and freedom but if you have a big government
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:04.280]  history is conclusive it always tramples on the weak
[02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:08.520]  and empowers the strong the general public was told none of this exists just
[02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:12.200]  go to sleep stand down let the experts run things
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:15.800]  nobody's going to take your sovereignty nobody wants your guns
[02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:19.400]  you know nobody wants socialism which is what the big banks want because they
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:22.680]  get to line share the money and then i would actually read the
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:25.720]  publications put out by the establishment
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:29.560]  to each other it wasn't secret but it was academic
[02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:33.640]  and it was all admitted and so i said whoa there's something going on here
[02:47:33.640 --> 02:47:36.920]  i better learn more about this the united states has been turned into an
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:41.560]  engine of global corporate tyranny and the people see right through it
[02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:44.600]  and they know that their paychecks don't go as far they know they're losing
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:47.960]  their jobs or getting their hours cut or they're working two or three jobs
[02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:51.160]  and they know everywhere they go there's new fines and fees and regulations and
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:54.360]  more police squeezing them and more rules and they know
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:58.600]  they're being socially engineered into slaves and they also know the gmo
[02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:01.560]  foods killing them they know the chemicals they put in the water
[02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:04.520]  killing them they know their neighbors are getting sick and dying all around
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:07.960]  them people know we're in a huge eugenics system and they know we're being
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:11.240]  killed the democrats and republicans are teamed
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:15.160]  up together at the leadership levels sharing power
[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:18.680]  they do fight with each other over who gets to have the levers of power but
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:21.880]  they don't fight with each other over their overall agenda of corporate
[02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:24.680]  looting and raping and they work for the same interest
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:28.360]  and so republicans are playing the part of anti-establishment right now
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:32.280]  but as soon as they get into office the banker bailouts will continue
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:35.880]  the patriot act will continue the corporate welfare will continue
[02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:39.880]  the entire agenda will continue just like obama broke all of his promises
[02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:43.400]  because they're all bought and paid for by the same people
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:47.160]  one of the most common questions i get is are we inevitably headed towards
[02:48:47.160 --> 02:48:51.720]  armed revolution and my answer is i certainly hope not
[02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:57.400]  and that's why i'm fighting as hard as i can uh to educate the public about
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:01.560]  how they're being manipulated by the false left right paradigm
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:05.480]  but if we are unable to
[02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:11.160]  to get the government to back off and to
[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:14.600]  convince special interests to take their foot off the gas
[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:17.800]  of tyranny and oppression it's it's going to explode
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:22.280]  and the system from all their preparations and all their statements
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:26.360]  uh actually wants it to become violent and wants to use that
[02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:29.560]  as the excuse to clamp down and have a real police state in america
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:37.000]  and so no i don't uh i don't want armed conflict in this country
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:41.880]  and i unfortunately think it's probably going to come to that because the
[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:45.240]  system wants that and the system has been caught provocaturing and
[02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:49.400]  supporting and promoting groups that do do that
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:52.600]  i support the militia movement the real militia movement that is in the
[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:55.800]  constitution uh and bill of rights and most of the
[02:49:55.800 --> 02:49:59.480]  militias that are out there are really good hardworking people who are
[02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:02.840]  concerned about the government and realize the tyrannical threat
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:06.680]  and uh who a lot of them are former military who are ready and willing to
[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:11.000]  defend their families just like the founding fathers in 1776 were
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:15.400]  uh there are also some colorful people and some unstable people
[02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:18.760]  out there like strut around in uniforms and and there are some extremist
[02:50:18.760 --> 02:50:22.280]  you know nutjobs out there but nine times out of ten when you actually study
[02:50:22.280 --> 02:50:25.240]  one of those groups it's founded and run by feds
[02:50:25.240 --> 02:50:29.160]  who are not just infiltrating a group they go out and create them
[02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:33.880]  and try to get them to do something radical uh so that uh they can then
[02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:38.040]  demonize the general movement of citizens being armed so i
[02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:42.120]  i a hundred and i support the militia a hundred percent because it's in the
[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:45.240]  constitutions and the bill of rights it's the second amendment
[02:50:45.240 --> 02:50:49.000]  but the media has created a distorted image of what the militia is
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:55.720]  uh show that uh they can try to uh demonize the entire idea
[02:51:01.080 --> 02:51:04.840]  attention this is a special alert to all americans who owe ten thousand dollars
[02:51:04.840 --> 02:51:08.600]  or more in back taxes to the irs the irs is now accepting reduced
[02:51:08.600 --> 02:51:12.040]  settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts
[02:51:12.040 --> 02:51:15.160]  owed due to the financial crisis in america the irs has
[02:51:15.160 --> 02:51:18.040]  announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers financial
[02:51:18.040 --> 02:51:21.240]  troubles in today's economy if you owe ten thousand dollars or more in

[02:52:01.320 --> 02:52:05.880]  the question is where should the american people draw their line in the
[02:52:05.880 --> 02:52:09.640]  sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy
[02:52:09.640 --> 02:52:13.640]  a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not
[02:52:13.640 --> 02:52:16.920]  democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on
[02:52:16.920 --> 02:52:19.320]  what's for dinner so they think they own our land

[02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:27.240]  we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate
[02:52:27.240 --> 02:52:31.000]  somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the patriot uprising

[02:54:20.760 --> 02:54:24.920]  we don't know where it came from it's the msnbc shoot they did some of the raw
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:27.560]  footage that that they never put on television they
[02:54:27.560 --> 02:54:31.480]  put a few clips out of context of me in there in their rise of the new
[02:54:31.480 --> 02:54:35.080]  right piece but the headlines alex jones on msnbc hit
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:38.600]  piece the lost footage info wars.com when everybody

[02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:53.000]  and i want to bring ted anderson in here briefly again
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:56.520]  two weeks ago when gold was down 50 something bucks you said
[02:54:56.520 --> 02:55:02.600]  i look for it to go up another you know 30 to 60 dollars in the next two weeks
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:06.840]  and you just always keep calling it briefly how did you know
[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:11.800]  that that was going to happen how i thought the market was oversold
[02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:15.560]  i saw that the u.s government was starting to back off they probably
[02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:19.400]  ran out of ammo and uh and we did have a rally
[02:55:19.400 --> 02:55:23.240]  and now we're going sideways to slightly lower
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:26.760]  it's to be expected as we enter into next week
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:30.600]  which on thursday is gold and silver option
[02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:34.840]  expiration day and the criminals on the comics
[02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:39.640]  the banks who write these options like the night knife and not the price of the
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:44.280]  long calls down by knocking the price of gold and silver down
[02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:48.680]  and they do it and when thursday's over the the gold and silver go right back
[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:51.640]  up again for another three or four weeks okay well what ted did
[02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:54.840]  three weeks ago is he bought a bunch of gold and silver when it was 50 something
[02:55:54.840 --> 02:55:57.320]  dollars less knowing it go up he's passing
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:01.320]  those savings on quickly ted give folks today's incredible specials and you
[02:56:01.320 --> 02:56:04.040]  told me off air you can say this on air if you'd like
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:07.480]  this is over sunday because you're guaranteed to sell out looks like you
[02:56:07.480 --> 02:56:10.600]  may already do it but you'll cover it you've got some incredible deals and
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:14.920]  you've got a year subscription when you buy one frank that makes the frank
[02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:17.000]  basically have price but if you want a bunch of
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:22.120]  franks you have it six seven dollars lower than what it was uh
[02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:25.960]  what it's selling for right now so quickly tell folks the offer we'll get
[02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:30.360]  uh Chapman's take on how good a deal it is yeah sure the frank
[02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:34.840]  with the international forecasters at 265 so really when you take off the
[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:38.520]  $159 for the subscription it gets you down to about
[02:56:38.520 --> 02:56:42.600]  $500 an ounce because the frank the is a fifth of an ounce of gold
[02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:49.080]  i also have that british sovereign at 333 the frank right now is trading at 271
[02:56:49.080 --> 02:56:55.080]  and the british sovereign right now is at 340 so both of those are steeply
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:56:58.600]  discounted in the marketplace based upon what gold was back
[02:56:58.600 --> 02:57:03.160]  a week ago when it was at 1180 so yeah it's a good time to be buying right now
[02:57:03.160 --> 02:57:06.920]  gold's up about 75 bucks and there's two different offers they can call and get
[02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:09.960]  a free one-time hard copy or digital copy of the latest
[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:13.000]  international forecaster or they can call and get a free
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:16.840]  subscription when they buy one frank at an already discounted price
[02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:20.200]  that is an insanely good deal do you agree bob
[02:57:20.200 --> 02:57:24.520]  fluidly there's nothing better and they're really getting it cheap and
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:28.200]  ted anderson's paying for it and ted is is running out of this
