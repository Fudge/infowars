[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:33.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.880]  welcome my friends welcome and thank you for joining us it is the first day of
[00:37.880 --> 00:44.960]  September 2010 we're just 10 days away from the ninth anniversary of the
[00:44.960 --> 00:50.680]  Black Ops staged attacks of 9-11 that have been used to convert our country
[00:50.680 --> 00:58.160]  into a Orwellian system of oppression and control and the controllers are just
[00:58.160 --> 01:03.600]  getting started and remember it was the Republican Party who was in power when
[01:03.600 --> 01:11.360]  that hoax that black op false flag self-inflicted inside job operation was
[01:11.360 --> 01:16.280]  carried out and Obama is controlled by the very same offshore corporate
[01:16.280 --> 01:26.880]  interest and now of course we have the beauty queen Sarah Palin traveling to
[01:26.880 --> 01:32.700]  Iowa basically already preparing the ground there for her run for the
[01:32.700 --> 01:39.560]  presidency coming up in 2011 for the 2012 election and you better believe that
[01:39.560 --> 01:45.400]  Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh are going to line up in support
[01:45.400 --> 01:53.520]  of Sarah Palin over Congressman Ron Paul and you just better get ready for that
[01:53.520 --> 01:58.360]  Ron Paul to be attacked because he comes on this radio show Ron Paul to be
[01:58.360 --> 02:02.680]  attacked because he says the CIA deals drugs Ron Paul to be attacked because he
[02:02.680 --> 02:06.480]  wants to audit the private Federal Reserve and audit the Fort Knox and
[02:06.480 --> 02:10.920]  New York Federal Reserve gold vaults that are reportedly empty they won't
[02:10.920 --> 02:15.480]  allow Congress or anybody else to look at it for more than 50 years so stay
[02:15.480 --> 02:20.200]  tuned for that we'll be talking some about that today we're gonna have wide
[02:20.200 --> 02:26.040]  open phones here in the broadcast and when we come back from break I'm gonna
[02:26.040 --> 02:30.400]  just skim over some of the news and I'm going to go to your calls in the next
[02:30.400 --> 02:37.000]  segment on any issue any news item any question any comment you've got for us
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.480]  just please be focused and ready to make your point so I can move to the next
[02:40.480 --> 02:43.640]  person quickly I'm gonna probably be at light speed today we'll probably take
[02:43.640 --> 02:48.840]  at least two calls this hour in fact jaren had a good idea for an Alex Jones
[02:48.840 --> 02:55.560]  ringtone what was it jaren yeah I told you I was gonna go to your calls we're
[02:55.560 --> 02:59.360]  going to go to your calls imagine that of a phone ringing saying I told you I'm
[02:59.360 --> 03:04.480]  gonna go to your calls but we're going to attempt we sell them are successful
[03:04.480 --> 03:09.360]  it'll probably be a mother saying I'm here in Austin the CPS stole my child for
[03:09.360 --> 03:13.240]  no reason and didn't even put my name correctly on the form or somebody will
[03:13.240 --> 03:17.080]  call in and say I'm here during a military checkpoint help me then they'll
[03:17.080 --> 03:20.920]  send us photos from their cell phone of it actually happening and I mean it's
[03:20.920 --> 03:28.120]  always crazy but 1-800-259-9231 we'll try not to get bogged down with one
[03:28.120 --> 03:36.040]  caller or with my long babbling answers 800-259-9231 and as you know I love

[04:38.640 --> 04:44.440]  put in to this operation what we could do even mainstream media yesterday wrote
[04:44.440 --> 04:47.720]  some new stories showing that my ratings are as high or higher than Glenn

[08:28.360 --> 08:32.640]  okay we're gonna have wide open phones throughout the full three hours of
[08:32.640 --> 08:37.520]  transmission today for 30 minutes in the second half of the next hour we're
[08:37.520 --> 08:42.320]  gonna have G Edward Griffin expert on the Federal Reserve on the missing gold
[08:42.320 --> 08:48.560]  at Fort Knox joining us to talk about all the strange goings-on we have Ron
[08:48.560 --> 08:51.720]  Paul coming out saying not only is he going to reintroduce his legislation
[08:51.720 --> 08:56.240]  that passed the House was defeated in the Senate to audit the private run for
[08:56.240 --> 09:00.880]  profit dictators of this country known as the Federal Reserve but now he's
[09:00.880 --> 09:05.040]  going to introduce legislation to call for an audit of the gold at Fort Knox
[09:05.040 --> 09:08.680]  and at Federal Reserve banks in the United States like the Bank of New
[09:08.680 --> 09:13.560]  York because for more than 50 years they will not let anybody in to see the
[09:13.560 --> 09:17.440]  gold or allow an audit even though Congress has requested it shows how out
[09:17.440 --> 09:21.920]  of control these criminals are and so of course they created derivatives of
[09:21.920 --> 09:26.440]  course they created thousands of trillions thousands 1.5 thousand
[09:26.440 --> 09:34.400]  1500 trillion of fake fiat instruments to buy up the real assets of course
[09:34.400 --> 09:39.600]  they're waging war against the real economy this is economic domination so
[09:39.600 --> 09:43.880]  we'll talk to G Edward Griffin about that I will also get his take on this
[09:43.880 --> 09:48.040]  bizarre story that started breaking yesterday and we have detailed analysis
[09:48.040 --> 09:55.280]  with the graphs from mainstream news where this was evidenced investors
[09:55.280 --> 10:06.320]  spooked as glitch sins gold to $3400 an ounce and this was reported by the
[10:06.320 --> 10:11.000]  comics this was reported by Kitco this was reported on the live graphs on
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.040]  Wall Street and in the other major global stock markets and mercantiles
[10:16.040 --> 10:22.200]  tracking this and so you talk about a rigged market and this is on the heels
[10:22.200 --> 10:30.840]  of Bloomberg reporting gold rallying to 1,500 as Soros bubble inflates and it
[10:30.840 --> 10:34.080]  goes on to report that the big bankers have decided they can't suppress gold
[10:34.080 --> 10:42.920]  any longer and that the majority of the options on gold for the month of
[10:42.920 --> 10:51.520]  December are $1,500 an ounce of course that signifies serious illness of the
[10:51.520 --> 10:57.560]  country's financial standing and serious inflation and dollar devaluation
[10:57.560 --> 11:05.440]  down the road monetization of debt so I'm going to be covering that also the
[11:05.440 --> 11:11.800]  British government the EU and the US government have invested tens of
[11:11.800 --> 11:17.600]  billions of dollars of taxpayer money in starting climate exchanges at the
[11:17.600 --> 11:24.120]  Chicago mercantile the climate carbon exchange at Gore and blood the other
[11:24.120 --> 11:29.120]  climate exchange in London England there in the city of London within London
[11:29.120 --> 11:36.160]  and with other carbon exchanges in Japan and the continent of Europe and they
[11:36.160 --> 11:40.640]  would take billions of dollars of taxpayer money and give it to Al Gore
[11:40.640 --> 11:47.720]  give it to Barack Obama give it to BP give it to Exxon mobile there's Enron
[11:47.720 --> 11:51.840]  was involved at the inception of this and that's on record mainstream news not
[11:51.840 --> 11:58.960]  denied with Al Gore in the mid-1990s but to cash out on those they've just been
[11:58.960 --> 12:03.720]  sitting there basically gaining value after the government seed money was put
[12:03.720 --> 12:08.480]  in and to really get the system rolling that they needed to then get this this
[12:08.480 --> 12:12.920]  new derivative backed up with taxpayer money and that's why they're hell bent
[12:12.920 --> 12:18.760]  on getting all of these different carbon taxes through not only does it
[12:18.760 --> 12:23.440]  control every faster your life government can then basically selectively
[12:23.440 --> 12:28.160]  enforce on who gets taxed and who doesn't so their cronies won't get taxed
[12:28.160 --> 12:32.120]  or their cronies will get the green jobs investment money and that turns out
[12:32.120 --> 12:37.480]  Al Gore Bill Clinton Queen of England Prince Philip Ted Turner I mean they're
[12:37.480 --> 12:42.000]  all heavily invested in this Bill and Melinda Gates so basically they just
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.080]  come in takeover government and then have government mandate that everybody
[12:47.080 --> 12:52.520]  buy not just carbon credits from them but also new appliances new light bulbs
[12:52.520 --> 12:57.520]  new wind turbines new water turbine systems that they've gotten patented
[12:57.520 --> 13:01.280]  the government says you've got to buy this this is approved this is just one
[13:01.280 --> 13:06.400]  way that they run major scams on us but the incredible news is even the United
[13:06.400 --> 13:13.280]  Nations new panel set up last year remember in November hackers released
[13:13.280 --> 13:18.760]  what the media turned out BBC AP Reuters New York Times had had for at least
[13:18.760 --> 13:23.920]  eight months thousands of pages of internal emails with the head of the
[13:23.920 --> 13:30.080]  UN program fixing the numbers on man-made climate change and lying and
[13:30.080 --> 13:34.520]  hiding the decline over the last decade and that the and that the increase in
[13:34.520 --> 13:38.280]  temperature had stopped 15 years ago and actually been declining if you
[13:38.280 --> 13:41.960]  average the global temperatures together sure they'll be record hot here record
[13:41.960 --> 13:45.320]  cold there in the thousands of microclimates on the planet but you've
[13:45.320 --> 13:49.680]  got to look at it in the aggregate sum total there's been a marked temperature
[13:49.680 --> 13:54.560]  decrease in the last decade and they knew this and they tried to stonewall for
[13:54.560 --> 14:00.560]  a month but the alternative media ran the blockade and got the information out
[14:00.560 --> 14:07.480]  that it was as phony as a $3 bill or as phony as an Enron Al Gore derivative so
[14:07.480 --> 14:11.680]  all of that happened all of that began to unfold and they said oh it's no big
[14:11.680 --> 14:15.280]  deal ignore it well they lost total credibility by stonewalling so the
[14:15.280 --> 14:19.520]  United Nations created a whitewash committee and they had several other
[14:19.520 --> 14:23.280]  committees in the EU and Britain that came out and said there is nothing wrong
[14:23.280 --> 14:28.880]  it was all innocent mistakes but now the UN has been forced to come out because
[14:28.880 --> 14:32.960]  nobody bought that and said okay there's a high-level inquiry into the
[14:32.960 --> 14:36.440]  intergovernmental panel on climate change found there was little evidence for
[14:36.440 --> 14:40.480]  its claims about global warming and admitted as Lord Moncton and others had
[14:40.480 --> 14:45.760]  said recently that this was literally from undergraduates and media reporters
[14:45.760 --> 14:50.160]  articles where they would just claim the earth had increased by five degrees they
[14:50.160 --> 14:54.080]  would just claim the Himalayas had melted they would just claim that the
[14:54.080 --> 14:57.800]  Easter Bunny was real you know basically and they go on to admit it's a total
[14:57.800 --> 15:03.280]  fraud and in one day and the Chicago climate exchange had already plunged by
[15:03.280 --> 15:10.760]  more than half but but but but the value they had left plunged by another 50% to
[15:10.760 --> 15:17.320]  a new record low yesterday and we're watching it closely today so we're
[15:17.320 --> 15:23.880]  going to get into the strange case of gold going to $3,400 yesterday we'll
[15:23.880 --> 15:29.800]  also get into a Senate to sneak through internet kill switch bill so they're
[15:29.800 --> 15:33.120]  they're moving ahead with trying to block us because we're cleaning their
[15:33.120 --> 15:38.760]  clocks with the internet the alternative media we're also going to get into two
[15:38.760 --> 15:44.880]  new videos that we've launched at our YouTube channel for maximum effect that
[15:44.880 --> 15:48.960]  we need to go mega viral to everyone I'm going to play those later in the
[15:48.960 --> 15:57.320]  transmission today and one of them has the headline vaccine deaths vaccine
[15:57.320 --> 16:03.680]  deaths and in fact we'll just go to info wars dot com right now for prison
[16:03.680 --> 16:07.680]  planet dot TV viewers and we'll pull that up for people it's vaccine death
[16:07.680 --> 16:14.040]  cover-up in plows worldwide and that of course hooks into the report we put out
[16:14.040 --> 16:18.160]  two days ago and thanks to you it was the number one Google search term vaccine
[16:18.160 --> 16:22.560]  deaths was the number one search term well now we have a video set to go
[16:22.560 --> 16:27.560]  mega viral that will save lives if you send it out to everyone you know posted
[16:27.560 --> 16:32.240]  on your Facebook your MySpace if you Twitter it out please get vaccine
[16:32.240 --> 16:37.280]  death cover-up in plows worldwide it is a 10-minute video it breaks everything
[16:37.280 --> 16:45.240]  down in detail admitting all over the world from Australia to India to Finland
[16:45.240 --> 16:54.200]  to many other nations they are admitting brain damage epilepsy narcolepsy
[16:54.200 --> 16:59.320]  guion beret deaths and suspending it the problem is they're back with another
[16:59.320 --> 17:06.680]  H1N1 we've got to get this word out and then finally will machete release
[17:06.680 --> 17:11.120]  spark racial violence I haven't commented on machete in several months it's set to
[17:11.120 --> 17:16.040]  come out Friday we've learned some very serious news concerning that that is all
[17:16.040 --> 17:23.000]  coming up today and we'll also get into Sarah Palin now going to Iowa clearly
[17:23.000 --> 17:28.680]  she is getting ready to run for president and we'll be discussing that as
[17:28.680 --> 17:34.360]  well but right now as promised I said I'd get to some calls in this segment
[17:34.360 --> 17:39.200]  let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in Virginia Jeff thanks for holding thank
[17:39.200 --> 17:43.240]  you sir our pleasure to talk to you this morning I'm just a quick question that I
[17:43.240 --> 17:49.360]  wanted to kind of ask you in light of Barack Obama's speech last night with
[17:49.360 --> 17:53.280]  regards to bringing the troops home quote unquote from Iraq I was I was
[17:53.280 --> 17:58.680]  reading this morning Ron Paul answered to that and I what I what I what I want to
[17:58.680 --> 18:02.320]  try to get up but the main point I want to try to get across the people who I
[18:02.320 --> 18:06.960]  reach out to I try to wake up is the difference between that a legitimate
[18:06.960 --> 18:12.440]  declaration of war and what we have with these phony wars including the
[18:12.440 --> 18:16.880]  yeah I have a blank check even though the Constitution says Congress declares
[18:16.880 --> 18:21.600]  war and instructs the president in how to prosecute it and to carry it out
[18:21.600 --> 18:25.520]  Congress controls the issuance of currency and credit private banks run
[18:25.520 --> 18:31.000]  that now and they now since Korea just issue a blank check to the president the
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.480]  National Security Council right but what I want to know what I'm hoping maybe
[18:35.480 --> 18:39.200]  you can help me out with is how can I explain the difference to between a
[18:39.200 --> 18:45.480]  legitimate declaration of war and a authorization by Congress to use force
[18:45.480 --> 18:48.960]  which is what we have in the case of Iraq well it's a fraud we never had it
[18:48.960 --> 18:54.200]  until the 1950s with the Korean War and they call them police actions and it's
[18:54.200 --> 18:58.960]  under the United Nations and it's unconstitutional it is treason by the
[18:58.960 --> 19:02.880]  Congress they should all be impeached those that vote for it and it turns the
[19:02.880 --> 19:07.600]  president into Julius Caesar and that's why our founders said that you don't have
[19:07.600 --> 19:12.480]  the president being able to bring his troops into the country to deal with the
[19:12.480 --> 19:18.360]  citizens that Caesar crossing the Rubicon and expanding on that you don't
[19:18.360 --> 19:24.200]  allow the Caesar to declare a war or to prosecute a war only the Roman Senate
[19:24.200 --> 19:28.760]  can levy war because if you let the Caesar do that you live in a
[19:28.760 --> 19:33.040]  dictatorship and now it's a dictatorship of the office of the president
[19:33.040 --> 19:37.480]  controlled by these offshore interest but yes Ron Paul has pointed out that
[19:37.480 --> 19:43.280]  there's 50,000 plus US troops 150,000 contractors so they took some troops
[19:43.280 --> 19:47.240]  out since some home since some to Afghanistan sent more troops to
[19:47.240 --> 19:52.200]  Afghanistan hired more contractors in both countries it's all CIA run it's all
[19:52.200 --> 19:55.960]  smoke and mirrors and Obama says mission accomplished like Bush said seven

[24:10.600 --> 24:19.120]  okay I hope I answered the last caller's question but I did intend to get into
[24:19.120 --> 24:23.360]  that later in the broadcast a bush walking around in his codpiece in his
[24:23.360 --> 24:28.760]  fighter pilot outfit and then declaring military operations are over it's the
[24:28.760 --> 24:33.120]  same thing with Obama he said he would bring all the troops home immediately
[24:33.120 --> 24:38.760]  then it was a year then it was 18 months and now that's not all the troops
[24:38.760 --> 24:44.080]  home immediately and they built permanent bases there they've trained the
[24:44.080 --> 24:48.200]  Iraqi military they brought in hundreds of thousands of contractors it's a
[24:48.200 --> 24:53.760]  fully occupied nation and many of the political parties in Iraq are on their
[24:53.760 --> 24:59.280]  own television stations and newspapers saying look leave you you've put in a
[24:59.280 --> 25:03.920]  total infrastructure you've got snatch and grab squads running around killing
[25:03.920 --> 25:09.840]  people get out of here so the model of paramilitary contractor control that
[25:09.840 --> 25:17.120]  Iraq is under is the same top-secret USA spy takeover covert takeover shadow
[25:17.120 --> 25:22.720]  takeover that we're under here let's go to Jeff in Virginia Jeff you're on the
[25:22.720 --> 25:29.120]  air oh we went to Jeff I thought he was still there okay Bobby in California
[25:29.120 --> 25:33.760]  yeah people need to be outraged at the fact that retail workers haven't found
[25:33.760 --> 25:40.240]  to have on average 30% more BPA in their system due to holding that dealing with
[25:40.240 --> 25:43.640]  BPA receipts all day yeah I saw that in Reuters in fact I meant to cover that a
[25:43.640 --> 25:51.080]  few days ago that retail workers have higher levels of BPA and they say
[25:51.080 --> 25:55.320]  according to in fact print these up I don't want to just say they say that
[25:55.320 --> 26:02.200]  that even light exposure to BPA in receipts is sterilizing and reducing
[26:02.200 --> 26:05.280]  men's fertility it can either reduce fertility or completely sterilize you
[26:05.280 --> 26:09.440]  and I did see that report I believe it was even in the statesman this weekend
[26:09.440 --> 26:15.120]  about BPA hurting retail workers and there's no reason the printer ink has
[26:15.120 --> 26:20.120]  to have that in it and to show how I'm conditioned to just accept this we need
[26:20.120 --> 26:24.600]  to go look at the at the printer ink we're using and find out if this is BPA
[26:24.600 --> 26:30.240]  because I'm touching this stuff every day in here and I'm trying to drink my
[26:30.240 --> 26:35.840]  topo Chico Mexican mineral water that is in you know good glass container and
[26:35.840 --> 26:41.000]  taste delicious to stay away from a basfine all a that's of course in the
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.240]  receipts but maybe I'm getting a type of printer ink that has it as well my god
[26:46.240 --> 26:51.960]  this stuff's everywhere I'm sorry Bobby please continue about where did you see
[26:51.960 --> 26:56.280]  that report about the bisfine all a couple I think that was on one of the
[26:56.280 --> 27:00.320]  yahoo news but it was all you know when all the when it showed all the store you
[27:00.320 --> 27:05.000]  know one study showed 40% of store receipts had BPA but another study
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.680]  showed 80% and the majority of the thermal printed receipts the ones that
[27:09.680 --> 27:12.720]  if you make a let's say you take a coin to make a line it makes a black mark the
[27:12.720 --> 27:16.600]  majority of those have have BPA they're just covered with it and and Whole Foods
[27:16.600 --> 27:20.640]  Whole Foods was able to switch in the last month May the store they ordered BPA
[27:20.640 --> 27:23.880]  free receipts due to the outrage and all other stores can do that too all they
[27:23.880 --> 27:27.720]  have to do is order BPA free you know thermal paper that's all they have to do
[27:27.720 --> 27:32.880]  yeah here's an a but here's an ABC news one study finds high BPA levels on store
[27:32.880 --> 27:37.760]  receipts I mean we've been covering that the last few months the issue that I saw
[27:37.760 --> 27:42.320]  in the paper was that they did blood test on workers and found it was just
[27:42.320 --> 27:48.880]  way higher than what it was in the general public but but again what have
[27:48.880 --> 27:52.720]  I been saying for at least a decade because I read the globalist documents I
[27:52.720 --> 27:57.480]  just covered Rockefeller documents in the last two weeks here that they
[27:57.480 --> 28:04.160]  knowingly of thousands of different plastic formulas thousands they chose
[28:04.160 --> 28:11.520]  between all a to be widely adopted and promoted to do this it's in our food
[28:11.520 --> 28:17.600]  packaging it's in the lining of 10 cans the aluminum cans it's it's in
[28:17.600 --> 28:23.960]  everything and that's why men are so feminine and that's why women are and
[28:23.960 --> 28:27.320]  of course they admit the studies breast cancer obesity and women it makes
[28:27.320 --> 28:32.280]  women really robust with just wild levels of estrogen which then gives them
[28:32.280 --> 28:36.600]  breast cancer and then it makes the men effeminate and it's all part of the
[28:36.600 --> 28:41.520]  admitted plan where they said we'll put things in products and water and food to
[28:41.520 --> 28:46.960]  reduce fertility in men and make them passive and anything else you want to
[28:46.960 --> 28:51.280]  know about this Bobby yeah if people go to YouTube and type in BPA contaminating
[28:51.280 --> 28:54.040]  their food they'll see a Fox News report and they'll watch how the chemist
[28:54.040 --> 28:56.680]  completely freaks out that they're putting a sex hormone in the food and
[28:56.680 --> 29:00.560]  he has a whole family drinking out of glass and it's just every chemist that
[29:00.560 --> 29:03.600]  studies is the whole family drinks out of glass I mean because they find just
[29:03.600 --> 29:09.840]  tiny amounts tiny amounts you know it's like having an estrogen pill
[29:09.840 --> 29:13.840]  taking an estrogen pill every day well it bio accumulates and I appreciate your
[29:13.840 --> 29:18.800]  call and also they've been telling everybody oh drink soy products now
[29:18.800 --> 29:24.280]  there are types of organic soy where they basically prepare it properly where
[29:24.280 --> 29:30.840]  it doesn't have massive levels of plant sterols that are estrogen mimicers but
[29:30.840 --> 29:36.480]  even in normal soy there's a reason that there's that cliche of Asian men you
[29:36.480 --> 29:40.400]  know not being as big or robust or a little more effeminate but you take
[29:40.400 --> 29:44.000]  Asians and put them in the United States start feeding them meat stuff they're
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.880]  like seven feet tall it's cuz they've been eaten for thousands of years we'll

[31:18.240 --> 31:22.800]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[31:22.800 --> 31:26.840]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[31:26.840 --> 31:30.640]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[31:30.640 --> 31:34.240]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[31:34.240 --> 31:38.560]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[33:11.760 --> 33:15.520]  gonna continue with your phone calls in a moment then when I start the second
[33:15.520 --> 33:21.440]  hour I'm gonna spend about 30 minutes on news then Gia McGriffin's gonna join us
[33:21.440 --> 33:25.680]  on the fact that Ron Paul wants to not just audit the Federal Reserve but on it
[33:25.680 --> 33:31.480]  Fort Knox and other gold depositories this is a very dangerous bold move this
[33:31.480 --> 33:34.800]  could bring the globalist down I mean how are they gonna get on the news and
[33:34.800 --> 33:40.920]  say oh you're not allowed to look at the gold no no extremist no one Congress is
[33:40.920 --> 33:45.120]  not allowed to audit the gold you just trust us private banks with it we all
[33:45.120 --> 33:48.960]  of course no they've already stolen it they won't allow that because they're
[33:48.960 --> 33:55.560]  total mafia crooks and they get away with anything in 1913 the Federal Reserve
[33:55.560 --> 33:59.520]  took the nation's finances over since then in the last 97 years they've been
[33:59.520 --> 34:05.680]  expanding their stranglehold and in 1933 Roosevelt got up on the radio and said
[34:05.680 --> 34:09.720]  look you turn your gold in we're gonna give you paper and then they gave it to
[34:09.720 --> 34:13.160]  the private banks and they swindled it then they took even more gold from the
[34:13.160 --> 34:17.840]  citizens and put it in these gold depositories and then they stole that
[34:17.840 --> 34:22.800]  they're a pack of criminals you think they just stole 28 trillion dollars and

[37:23.160 --> 37:29.840]  quipped all politics are local and for anybody to think that we can vote these
[37:29.840 --> 37:35.080]  bums out that allows these corporations to offer all this legislation and they
[37:35.080 --> 37:38.760]  sit on their hands for the people's business it's got their head in the
[37:38.760 --> 37:43.560]  sand there's no electronic voting record you don't know who you voted for like I
[37:43.560 --> 37:47.720]  say they're absolutely in control and when Houston got caught engaged in
[37:47.720 --> 37:51.600]  fraud they just they just fire bombed the giant facility with all voting
[37:51.600 --> 37:55.120]  machines and ballots and records and that's just how it works that's how the
[37:55.120 --> 38:02.320]  mafia rolls that's right and see so you're these boys are all local like he
[38:02.320 --> 38:07.960]  said they have satellite offices in each district where they originate from and
[38:07.960 --> 38:14.080]  people need to go down to these offices and have a protest peaceful protest two
[38:14.080 --> 38:18.760]  to three persons at a time we have five here in my district but see instead
[38:18.760 --> 38:23.680]  everybody's gonna get into the pageant of Obama who's gonna save us and have
[38:23.680 --> 38:31.120]  60% voter turnout or the pageant of the little beauty queen up there flashing
[38:31.120 --> 38:36.400]  her cleavage at everyone Sarah Palin wearing leather dominatrix outfits and
[38:36.400 --> 38:40.960]  they'll all obsess over it and and oh there'll be a big battle and then we'll
[38:40.960 --> 38:45.680]  have 8% turnout locally and the mafia will still control things or we could
[38:45.680 --> 38:49.520]  take our states our sheriffs our counties back and we could route them
[38:49.520 --> 38:55.200]  town by town just like it was Iwo Jima taking every square inch of that rock
[38:55.200 --> 39:00.560]  it's we're gonna have to route them out at point blank range you're absolutely
[39:00.560 --> 39:05.440]  right going to all their town halls all their meetings but Republicans were
[39:05.440 --> 39:09.800]  being booed a year ago a year and a half ago by the Tea Party everywhere Ron
[39:09.800 --> 39:14.000]  Paul true constitutionalist so the left came out and said oh my gosh it's right
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.920]  wingers that run it they're only protesting Democrats to work with the
[39:17.920 --> 39:23.680]  Republicans in the hoax that that all opposition is Republican so the Tea
[39:23.680 --> 39:30.520]  Party Express and Dick Army and Sarah Bam Bam Palin and Glenn Kochhead Beck and
[39:30.520 --> 39:37.720]  all of them could could come rushing in to run their operation and now be the
[39:37.720 --> 39:43.120]  lead the opposition right into a rat hole just like Obama did and the suckers
[39:43.120 --> 39:46.480]  are gonna love it all these old Republicans are gonna sit there licking
[39:46.480 --> 39:50.680]  their lips looking at Sarah Palin in her inner in her little hooker boots
[39:50.680 --> 39:55.720]  her little hooker outfits just drooling over her and they love slavery and
[39:55.720 --> 39:58.240]  they're gonna lose everything they got and they're gonna love it and they're
[39:58.240 --> 40:01.720]  gonna love the new wars the Republicans launch and they're gonna love it I'm
[40:01.720 --> 40:08.240]  sorry go ahead well I will finish up in closing and say we are at an absolute
[40:08.240 --> 40:13.360]  economic standstill in this country and if I three to four weeks I don't go
[40:13.360 --> 40:17.480]  program have a country love saving Alex doesn't matter Sarah Palin's in Iowa
[40:17.480 --> 40:21.200]  she's gonna save us Henry Kissinger completely controls her she's wonderful
[40:21.200 --> 40:26.360]  she's gonna save us yes you see her she wears dominatrix outfits they like her
[40:26.360 --> 40:29.280]  it's over I can't I can't see her very long to the
[40:29.280 --> 40:33.920]  screeching voice hers drives me up the world so how they're running her I have
[40:33.920 --> 40:37.800]  no idea but Alex I thank you for the time but people get out of your houses
[40:37.800 --> 40:41.240]  because you ain't gonna have a house left if you don't thank you God bless you
[40:41.240 --> 40:47.440]  great points Steve and what he said is completely central to everything if you
[40:47.440 --> 40:51.600]  don't wake up that they control the Republicans and Democrats at the highest
[40:51.600 --> 40:58.200]  levels it's over okay the Republicans have better rhetoric at least until the
[40:58.200 --> 41:01.160]  last few years you know suddenly we saw the Republican leadership get behind
[41:01.160 --> 41:10.880]  cap and trade until Patriots exposed it now they're kind of on the fence and you
[41:10.880 --> 41:15.960]  see them expanding government expanding wars I mean we're going bankrupt you
[41:15.960 --> 41:19.720]  could take all the welfare checks away from the welfare queens and that wouldn't
[41:19.720 --> 41:25.360]  put a dent even a nick in hell in debt we are with a two trillion a year in
[41:25.360 --> 41:30.800]  defense spending it's a trillion 100 billion on budget another 800 billion or
[41:30.800 --> 41:36.600]  so and supplemental then another 800 billion or so in black ops that we know
[41:36.600 --> 41:43.320]  about in intelligence funding so what's 1.9 trillion and 800 trillion 2.7 trillion
[41:43.320 --> 41:49.560]  excuse me 2.7 trillion a year and every time I read articles it's the Pentagon
[41:49.560 --> 41:53.400]  says they may have to preemptively strike the internet to protect the web and
[41:53.400 --> 41:58.760]  preemptive attacks to defend America defend America these are globalist that
[41:58.760 --> 42:03.040]  run our military have you figured that out yet that they want to end this
[42:03.040 --> 42:07.320]  country and that they got the average person in the military going along with
[42:07.320 --> 42:10.080]  all this thinking they're fighting for the red white and blue and while you're
[42:10.080 --> 42:14.280]  at football games crying when they run up the American flag and the and the fat
[42:14.280 --> 42:18.680]  lady sings the national anthem that that what America really is the Bill of
[42:18.680 --> 42:22.200]  Rights the Constitution and the free market had its throat slit a long time
[42:22.200 --> 42:29.080]  ago and bled out down the road it's a dead corpse down the road with maggots
[42:29.080 --> 42:38.720]  coming out of it I'm sorry I'm ranting we can restore the Republic but it
[42:38.720 --> 42:42.560]  isn't going to be restored by Fox News that told us how good it would be to get
[42:42.560 --> 42:45.320]  rid of Glass-Steagall and have derivatives that told us how great the
[42:45.320 --> 42:48.720]  Federal Reserve was that told us we should not at the Fed that told us the
[42:48.720 --> 42:53.960]  banker bailout was good O'Reilly back all of them by what people are saying
[42:53.960 --> 42:58.840]  well Beck has apologized for being for the banker bailout oh really I every time
[42:58.840 --> 43:04.960]  I tune in he's promoting a VAT tax on top of the income tax and in fair taxes
[43:04.960 --> 43:07.760]  that it's just gonna be a new federal tax they're not gonna get rid of the
[43:07.760 --> 43:12.740]  other ones I told you 12 years ago that was the Republican plan I mean if you
[43:12.740 --> 43:19.480]  think a new tax on top of other taxes and if you think 2.7 trillion dollars in
[43:19.480 --> 43:24.200]  defense spending is good and you think the Republicans with George W. Bush
[43:24.200 --> 43:27.720]  trying to open the borders up I mean if you think all that's good you think
[43:27.720 --> 43:31.520]  O'Reilly promoting global warming is good and Newt Gendrich promoting it and
[43:31.520 --> 43:38.200]  who's the head of the 700 Club Pat Robertson telling you global warming's real
[43:38.200 --> 43:42.680]  I mean if you think these people are gonna save you well then good you might
[43:42.680 --> 43:46.560]  as well go lick Obama's boots I had to sit here and tell all you idiot liberals
[43:46.560 --> 43:50.960]  that Obama was gonna sit there and lie to you and gonna hire lobbyists and
[43:50.960 --> 43:54.920]  continue banker bailouts to continue deindustrialization and continue all
[43:54.920 --> 43:58.640]  of this and I read the health care bill written by the insurance companies owned
[43:58.640 --> 44:03.560]  by the banks to raise your taxes make 30 million people get insurance and then
[44:03.560 --> 44:07.720]  lower the standard of care cut Medicaid Medicare and you said shut up
[44:07.720 --> 44:11.120]  Republican and stuck your thumb in your mouth part of the left right paradigm
[44:11.120 --> 44:14.560]  and now you're finding out you're not gonna get it care now you're finding out
[44:14.560 --> 44:17.840]  it doesn't cover pre-existing conditions now you're finding out there are death
[44:17.840 --> 44:25.640]  panels and it's gonna be the same thing with all you neocon supporters the
[44:25.640 --> 44:31.120]  neocons have listened to my show repackage themselves as patriots you
[44:31.120 --> 44:35.920]  don't think Fox News notices when prison planet.com and info wars.com are
[44:35.920 --> 44:40.000]  bigger than Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck sites combined you don't think that
[44:40.000 --> 44:45.200]  doesn't scare them and so they come along with their hundreds of millions of
[44:45.200 --> 44:49.880]  dollars next to our couple million a year to fund what we're doing they come
[44:49.880 --> 44:53.960]  along with their hundreds of millions just on back alone and they sit there
[44:53.960 --> 45:00.360]  and deploy him against you and they're already lining up Sarah Palin to be
[45:00.360 --> 45:05.560]  president by the way I could already see this happening last few months in her
[45:05.560 --> 45:09.440]  dominatrix outfits psychologically designed to get all the old blue-haired
[45:09.440 --> 45:15.600]  Republican men to well you know to do you know what will they watch her on TV
[45:15.600 --> 45:19.560]  they like to be whipped and beaten they like to be robbed they like to be scammed
[45:19.560 --> 45:22.600]  and Sarah Palin's gonna do it for them they're getting her ready as their new
[45:22.600 --> 45:30.360]  dominatrix and in this sickening psychological joke and it's gonna be
[45:30.360 --> 45:34.760]  just like Obama with the liberals when they're bought and paid for by the same
[45:34.760 --> 45:43.960]  interest and one of my employees is you know did did work for MTV and some
[45:43.960 --> 45:47.000]  other folks he hadn't written the article yet he says he's going public with it
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.120]  but I don't want to get into it until he wants to talk about it he may write an
[45:51.120 --> 45:54.480]  article today but I knew he was going last week to visit friends and family in
[45:54.480 --> 45:59.480]  Los Angeles he got invited to a Hollywood party there were some top you know
[45:59.480 --> 46:03.160]  we're talking guys that have been in the business 40 years top music producers
[46:03.160 --> 46:10.360]  and movie producers there and they were laughing yeah we put Obama in to destroy
[46:10.360 --> 46:15.800]  all hope and create racial division and to continue the left-right paradigm to
[46:15.800 --> 46:21.920]  keep people in the box and this went on for hours and you know they were and you
[46:21.920 --> 46:24.800]  know the fellow here in the office was saying I can't believe you're like this
[46:24.800 --> 46:28.040]  they said hey that's how we win they said it's all eugenics it's all
[46:28.040 --> 46:32.640]  environmental takeover now we're gonna put in Sarah Palin to really bring in
[46:32.640 --> 46:37.640]  the tyranny and you know and and that terror is coming to America and that
[46:37.640 --> 46:43.120]  everybody's gonna learn the power of the New World Order and that's how it is in
[46:43.120 --> 46:45.800]  Hollywood either the people are totally awake because they're around these
[46:45.800 --> 46:55.440]  psychopaths or they're involved in it and so Sarah Palin's being lined up the
[46:55.440 --> 47:01.520]  lady that enjoyed endorses John McCain the lady who says that Henry Kissinger
[47:01.520 --> 47:07.680]  is her mentor and yeah she poses with a rifle and she wears dominatrix outfits
[47:07.680 --> 47:12.720]  so everything must be okay if I can find a full shot of her it's
[47:12.720 --> 47:17.760]  you know with the motorcycle boots and the kind of the Nazi boots and the
[47:17.760 --> 47:22.220]  rest of it and hey people sell their families out their future out for a
[47:22.220 --> 47:26.360]  slick Harvard lawyer read not the teleprompter they'll do it for a beauty
[47:26.360 --> 47:31.560]  queen tart I mean they'll do it and then Americans like to be suckered it's an
[47:31.560 --> 47:36.880]  enjoyment and don't worry you're gonna lose everything you got and you know I
[47:36.880 --> 47:41.960]  got these idiot Democrats sending me emails oh and look Obama kept a promise
[47:41.960 --> 47:45.160]  sure he hired nothing but lobbyist continued tortures and expanded other
[47:45.160 --> 47:49.440]  wars and sure he did the banker bail out and the healthcare thing is a scam but
[47:49.440 --> 47:53.520]  he did in the war oh yeah just like Bush did seven and a half years ago up
[47:53.520 --> 48:01.760]  there in the aviator cod piece outfit you mean that I mean it's all theater
[48:01.760 --> 48:06.120]  with bad actors and he said military operations are over what's Obama say
[48:06.120 --> 48:11.000]  last night military operations are now over 50,000 troops they renamed combat
[48:11.000 --> 48:17.040]  brigades combat assistance brigades doing the exact same job with 150,000
[48:17.040 --> 48:23.600]  contractors upped by 50,000 they pull 50,000 troops out and put 50,000 more
[48:23.600 --> 48:27.240]  contractors paid double triple or quadruple what the troops are they're
[48:27.240 --> 48:31.240]  just troops that became contractors unaccountable to Congress or anybody
[48:31.240 --> 48:37.000]  and Obama gets up there and tells you he's a big piece from it all right let's
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.640]  go back to your calls Joe in Florida you're on the air hey everybody how you
[48:41.640 --> 48:45.720]  doing it's been a while since I talked to you last I just want to thank you
[48:45.720 --> 48:49.720]  again for all the late work you do and just getting the information out and
[48:49.720 --> 48:55.440]  just basically helping the American people become educated which we talked
[48:55.440 --> 48:58.880]  about last time I talked to you but a couple things I just wanted to talk
[48:58.880 --> 49:06.040]  about one is is that the I want to talk to you about is like about the
[49:06.040 --> 49:11.200]  occupations and sterilizations and all that the thing I have a hard time
[49:11.200 --> 49:17.480]  understanding is is every college university mandates that you'll be you
[49:17.480 --> 49:24.960]  have to take vaccinations in order to actually attend the classes now I find
[49:24.960 --> 49:29.280]  that to be a little bit worrisome because we're learning so much now about
[49:29.280 --> 49:35.120]  how these vaccinations that are supposed to help us are in fact giving us
[49:35.120 --> 49:40.840]  convulsions and mental diseases and all such but that is helping you the UN
[49:40.840 --> 49:47.680]  openly says reductions in IQ is a cognitive enhancement making you submit
[49:47.680 --> 49:53.880]  soft killing you damaging you is a loving thing they give you I mean they
[49:53.880 --> 50:01.520]  actually say this but remember it's lies within lies that's another fraud there
[50:01.520 --> 50:07.120]  is no law that you have to take a vaccine to go to college it is a policy
[50:07.120 --> 50:14.240]  that they tell you is a law but by law they have to give you a vaccine waiver
[50:14.240 --> 50:20.120]  form let me expand they tried to make nurses and police take it nationwide
[50:20.120 --> 50:25.840]  last year most of them said no over 95% that imploded they lied and said

[55:44.880 --> 55:49.280]  really shows how the globalist stage 9-11 and how they control the radical

[1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:39.760]  what's on your mind hey just a quick comment and just a quick question um
[1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:47.560]  I'm a veteran I was stationed in South Korea in 97 and basically the first time
[1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:51.400]  that I realized there was a huge discrepancy and what the official story
[1:00:51.400 --> 1:00:57.520]  is and what the real story is when stationed up by the DMZ and my friend
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:01.440]  stationed a little bit closer than me but we were both up there and now we
[1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:06.000]  have Madeline Albright come over and she visited the base and he didn't have
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:09.320]  heat and it was the beginning of the it was starting to get cold in the winter
[1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:14.080]  season and he didn't have he and she came right his base and was supposed to be
[1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:17.720]  over there to make sure troops are doing okay and everything was going well and
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:22.760]  I remember he told me I talked to me said you know she came and left and and went
[1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:25.240]  to the United States that everything's going great I choose to be well taken
[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:28.000]  care of and he still didn't get heat the whole winter he was freezing his tail
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:34.280]  off out there just hilarious but anyway just well you know that sounds like a
[1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:41.160]  small thing but it's a culture of lying a culture of big giant obelisk like
[1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:45.800]  marble buildings of the banks and the government and we're just the little
[1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:51.400]  people and they're God and they know best when at the end of the day they're
[1:01:51.400 --> 1:01:57.160]  just a bunch of crooks who are afraid of justice that's why they're setting up a
[1:01:57.160 --> 1:02:01.520]  police state to suppress the people in case we ever try to bring them to
[1:02:01.520 --> 1:02:08.280]  justice Madeline Albright in 2008 came driving in to the Bilderberg meeting and
[1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:13.040]  got so scared by people recognizing her and bullhorning her that she panicked
[1:02:13.040 --> 1:02:19.160]  and fled and left and later she admitted that to news cameras so it just shows
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:23.920]  they're a bunch of goblin like cowards who are all on a bunch of heart
[1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:28.120]  medication who are scared to death of us they're a bunch of swindlers but only
[1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:32.560]  because we don't have respect in ourselves can they get away with all
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:37.000]  their crimes go ahead exactly no I appreciate what you're saying and but
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:40.720]  I brought that up just because you know since that time I mean I've always kind
[1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:45.240]  of tucked it in the back of my mind I always knew something was not right but
[1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:49.160]  it just kind of laid dormant until really a lot of your films and a lot of
[1:02:49.160 --> 1:02:53.440]  things that I've heard people just bring up and I just you know you go down that
[1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:57.040]  rabbit hole you just find out all bunch of stuff but I've been away for about
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:00.320]  three years and and I really appreciate you and all the work you do and
[1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:05.360]  everybody else that's working hard but my question is you know with with the
[1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:10.320]  gold thing I was just wondering is it possible because I haven't heard anybody
[1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:15.920]  address this but is it possible that we should be concerned about another FDR
[1:03:15.920 --> 1:03:21.840]  situation with the confiscation of all that you should be concerned but I mean
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:26.400]  they only again you should be concerned about dying in a car wreck today you
[1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:30.480]  should be concerned about you know getting cancer if you smoke two packs of
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:33.360]  cigarettes a day or getting a liver failure if you drink a bottle of Jack
[1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:38.800]  Daniels every night they devalued the currency they bankrupted the society and
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:44.480]  then three years later came and took the gold but most people refused to turn it
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:48.240]  in so yeah we should be worried about the government passing a draft and
[1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:52.440]  saying all our kids have got to go fight for the New World Order but you know that
[1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:57.040]  doesn't keep you from having a child just because they may try to draft them it
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:00.400]  doesn't keep you from getting on the highway just because you might die in a
[1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:04.360]  car wreck it doesn't keep you from getting the best thing there is to
[1:04:04.360 --> 1:04:07.640]  protect yourself doesn't mean it's perfect doesn't mean thieves can't
[1:04:07.640 --> 1:04:11.640]  steal it doesn't mean they can't manipulate it downward doesn't mean the
[1:04:11.640 --> 1:04:15.160]  government can't try to make you turn it in at a certain point we've got to
[1:04:15.160 --> 1:04:19.160]  start saying I'm not taking your shot when you say it's mandatory they tried
[1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:25.000]  that last year I'm not going to give you my gold you little criminal creatures at
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:30.760]  a certain point you've got to say no to these swindlers do you see what I'm
[1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:36.960]  saying well and I appreciate that and I guess you know when we're trying to do
[1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:40.600]  what's best for our families and we're trying to move our savings into
[1:04:40.600 --> 1:04:43.800]  something that's a little bit more dependable I you know it's just I was
[1:04:43.800 --> 1:04:47.120]  trying to make the best decision and I didn't want to do that if that might you
[1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:51.080]  know I mean I guess anything can happen so sir exactly hedge your bets be
[1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:56.520]  invested in as many things as you can number one invest in God invest in

[1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:30.080]  2010 seems like this year just started a few months ago but here we are it's
[1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:35.400]  already long in the tooth and has a long white beard old man fall and winter is
[1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:43.080]  right around the corner okay I'm looking at all this news I'm gauging at
[1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:50.560]  financial news police state news great news on the climate change fraud really
[1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:54.840]  continuing its freefall its implosion is even more devastating than I first
[1:08:54.840 --> 1:09:03.040]  thought remember back in November the media tried to stonewall the fact that
[1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:08.160]  the climategate emails were devastating showing the premeditated fraud and then
[1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:13.560]  it was a eugenics end of industrial civilization program of criminal
[1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:19.200]  feudalism and consolidation and I pop champagne on air I've never done that
[1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:25.240]  before or since I I told my crew and I'm not a big drinker but I said you go to
[1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:30.600]  the store and buy $50 bottles of champagne that may be nothing for Al
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:35.040]  Gore or Sarah Palin but that's a pretty fancy champagne for us around here you
[1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:42.240]  know $8 bottles pretty fancy and we had two bottles the crew of about five
[1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:47.920]  people and myself we all had a couple of glasses of champagne when that first
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:51.760]  broke and it took about three weeks for the media to finally admit it was real
[1:09:51.760 --> 1:09:56.960]  but I know something devastating when I see it and this was a great victory for
[1:09:56.960 --> 1:10:00.360]  my family it was a great victory for your family I mean if they get this
[1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:07.840]  carbon tax dictatorship through it means one-child policy for sterilizations
[1:10:07.840 --> 1:10:13.360]  worldwide it means the end of family farms the end of small factories you
[1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:17.160]  think naft and gat have killed our business and our industry he ain't seen
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:24.880]  nothing yet and let me tell you I described those documents being leaked
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:30.400]  like the Death Star plans being stolen by Bothan spies but they still had to
[1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:34.280]  get them to Princess Leah who tried to get him to Obi-Wan Kenobi who got him
[1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:38.080]  to Luke Skywalker and they still had to get in their X wings and they had to go
[1:10:38.080 --> 1:10:42.400]  blow up the Death Star about a month after those documents got leaked the
[1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:47.760]  Death Star blew up but there was still a giant imperial fleet of super star
[1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:53.560]  destroyers out there causing problems well the super star destroyer
[1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:58.720]  executor has been destroyed and the emperor at least the emperor of climate
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:04.760]  fraud Al Gore has been thrown down a mineshaft and has blown up so I mean I
[1:11:04.760 --> 1:11:11.760]  it's just I mean it's time for Ewoks to be dancing around and singing and I know
[1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:15.160]  this can't get any more cheesy but I'm just going with it and I expect to see
[1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:20.400]  Obi-Wan Kenobi's spirit and Anakin Skywalker over here now you know the
[1:11:20.400 --> 1:11:24.840]  fight isn't over because there's still a lot of other globalist scams going but
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:28.800]  this is this is bigger than George Washington beating the Hessians at
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:33.200]  Trenton his first major victory that showed that they could be beaten this
[1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:43.800]  is this is unspeakably good oh look I'm already rambling that's coming up to you
[1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:46.960]  know I get bummed out one day looking at all the evil but I also got to get
[1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:51.880]  positive because if we just stand up and get up off our butts and stand up to
[1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:56.720]  these bullies it's always scary when the bully comes down on you and he's a lot
[1:11:56.720 --> 1:12:00.560]  bigger than you and he goes ahead and swings at you and connects and you kind
[1:12:00.560 --> 1:12:04.280]  of you know but as soon as he connects with you as soon as he punches you
[1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:08.040]  you're not scared anymore you're gonna beat the living daylights out of them
[1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:11.520]  and pretty soon that bully's on the ground with blood coming out their
[1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:15.840]  ears and nose begging for you to stop and you know what we are gonna stomp the
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:19.840]  living Hades out of the New World Order if you'll just get up off your butt and
[1:12:19.840 --> 1:12:23.240]  just say you know what I didn't start this fight government but you're looking
[1:12:23.240 --> 1:12:26.680]  for it I'm gonna go out and warn everybody and I'm gonna boldly expose
[1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:32.680]  you and it's over you understand scum just get just open the can up of you
[1:12:32.680 --> 1:12:37.440]  know what just open it up politically and see through the neocons and the
[1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:42.240]  Democrats and say we're done with you if you were real you'd be saying audit the
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:46.200]  Federal Reserve and audit Fort Knox you'd be saying bring all the troops home
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:13:00.240]  now period you'd be Ron Paul we're done we're done we need to get aggressive
[1:13:00.520 --> 1:13:07.800]  all right Northing in Ohio you're on the air how you doing good I'm great good
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:12.160]  first thing I'd like to know and once I'm done you'll hopefully understand my
[1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:16.040]  question is I'd like to be able to get the number to Joel as well as your off
[1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:21.480]  line number and the reason being is I studied forensics in college with
[1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:24.800]  government and the minor in Soviet studies I went into the military as an
[1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:31.760]  officer in the Air Force where I witnessed personally chem gear NATO
[1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:36.360]  alliances were taking out a critical piece of the chem gear before we went
[1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:42.600]  to the first Gulf War I stepped up and stopped it and ultimately went on to work
[1:13:42.600 --> 1:13:48.760]  at Grummond where I witnessed the F-14 was getting defective chips into the
[1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:53.520]  weapons box of the F-15 at F-14 which is the leading jet and this is again
[1:13:53.520 --> 1:13:59.440]  before the first Gulf War before the so and it made the F-14 virtually like a
[1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:03.760]  Cessna that could be shot down I challenged it wrote reports up to the
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:07.040]  Air Force and the Air Force tried to fire me out of the United States Air Force
[1:14:07.040 --> 1:14:14.440]  this is all before the first Gulf War I witnessed as an officer and a commander
[1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:18.960]  which mean I had legal authority and no mind you I'd studied Ohio law before
[1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:24.320]  going in I read the UCMJ every year I witnessed the human sexual trafficking
[1:14:24.320 --> 1:14:29.480]  of women children and men inside the military I reported it up to the to
[1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:34.320]  the leadership to the wing commanders to the Jag to OSI no one would stop it I
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:39.120]  have since discovered something called the McDowell rape checklist that was
[1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:45.840]  put in place in the 1970s and in 1985 it was educated through Congress and
[1:14:45.840 --> 1:14:52.440]  trained across the country to throw out rape victims testimonies the intention
[1:14:52.440 --> 1:14:56.320]  of all this was for human sexual trafficking well actually man everything
[1:14:56.320 --> 1:14:59.800]  you said has come out congressional hearings separately with my own research
[1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:07.120]  that anyone can find that Dinecore Halliburton arms of the Pentagon run not
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:11.600]  just women and children for sexual slavery known as white slave every time
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:16.360]  I say white slavery I get emails saying what black slavery isn't bad if a black
[1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:21.300]  woman is kidnapped and forced into sexual service that's white slavery white
[1:15:21.300 --> 1:15:26.720]  slavery just means sexual slavery folks and that's all come out and there's
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:30.880]  congressional hearings where Rumsfeld said Dinecore is allowed to do this we
[1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:34.320]  we've decided it's also come out the Chicago Tribune that Halliburton and
[1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:39.280]  Dinecore also kidnapped men worldwide and take them to slave facilities all
[1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:46.040]  over the world at brick factories textile plants so in China does this
[1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:52.720]  Israel does it Saudi Arabia does it our government works with Mexico with sex
[1:15:52.720 --> 1:16:00.400]  slaves and textile slaves as well this is what globalism is and we can give you
[1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:04.840]  a number here man but the thing is if you will email Joel Scalson this world
[1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:08.200]  affairs briefs he said he wants to hear from whistleblowers and give him your
[1:16:08.200 --> 1:16:12.520]  number I mean I would imagine if you put in your email what you've told me and
[1:16:12.520 --> 1:16:15.560]  that you'd like to talk about it I'll guarantee it Joel likes to talk to you
[1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:21.400]  but specifically were you overseas and what saw them using military flights to
[1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:29.200]  fly out women and children to you know third-party countries like Indonesia like
[1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:34.320]  Thailand like Israel Saudi Arabia places like that or I mean what were you
[1:16:34.320 --> 1:16:40.120]  witnessing I was at Keeser Air Force Base where the wing commander in 1983 was
[1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:45.040]  trafficking his own women on the base I walked into the officers club and
[1:16:45.040 --> 1:16:50.480]  thought and before I left my training they literally retired him and this was
[1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:54.720]  the way I was he just running whores or or or were these third-world women they
[1:16:54.720 --> 1:16:59.720]  brought in as slaves these were American military women who have been groomed
[1:16:59.720 --> 1:17:04.440]  raped groomed and turned out for the base population oh yeah well I mean that
[1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:07.880]  was general hooker that's why they call hookers hookers because general hooker
[1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:12.200]  on the northern side we would would you know bring the women along in the wagon
[1:17:12.200 --> 1:17:16.960]  trains hookers girls as they were people think hookers put their hooks in you
[1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:20.800]  know it's from general hooker in the civil war and I know that there's
[1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:24.560]  articles every day I see about homeland security using the women and homeland
[1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:28.800]  security is sex slaves but I'm sorry go ahead well this was this was on three
[1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:33.280]  different bases that I was at and I witnessed as secrets were being sold
[1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:37.400]  at rape Patterson I was a headquarters section commander down there and while
[1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:41.080]  women were being raped and beaten and I could not get it stopped as a commander
[1:17:41.080 --> 1:17:47.640]  there one of the guys who was raping and beating his children was a foreigner
[1:17:47.640 --> 1:17:51.800]  who'd become an American citizen they gave him direct access to the missiles
[1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:56.960]  and he went on to sell the secrets and the missiles or missile secrets to China
[1:17:56.960 --> 1:18:01.520]  he was Chinese national and I ended up even in the Washington Post there's
[1:18:01.520 --> 1:18:05.640]  over 3,000 Chinese front companies they're allowed to operate just like
[1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:09.720]  they were given the Panama Canal they're given everything but then the main
[1:18:09.720 --> 1:18:13.560]  focus of homeland security is going after the American people much of what you
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:17.800]  said I've separately seen confirmed military is also used to traffic
[1:18:17.800 --> 1:18:21.440]  narcotics into the country that's why they're recruiting in third world
[1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:26.600]  countries are recruiting from gangs and then making gang commanders commanders
[1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:30.440]  in the military to then command the gangs and it's all part of their dark
[1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:36.040]  side takeover but ma'am I'll put you on hold to try to give you one of our more
[1:18:36.040 --> 1:18:39.640]  private emails but I would suggest you go to hold a Joel Scalcin I appreciate
[1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:42.040]  your calls since you wanted to get a hold of him just emailing thank you
[1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:47.920]  Dorothy let's talk to a Tim in Michigan Tim you're on the air hey mr. Jones
[1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:54.040]  hey buddy how you doing man I figured out a regular caller at this point I
[1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:59.400]  got a couple things I like you reflect on you know I watched I know you've been
[1:18:59.400 --> 1:19:04.320]  trying to not bash back you know and there's this guy that has a website the
[1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:08.640]  young Turk and he's always bashing back he's got several videos up there but he
[1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:12.880]  does that from a liberal perspective and he and I know I said about a week ago I
[1:19:12.880 --> 1:19:16.960]  was sent the clip we played this years ago where Glenn Beck says you know don't
[1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:21.120]  go to ground zero no Muslim should be near it but then Glenn Beckson all these
[1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:25.360]  shows saying there's no one I hate more than families of 9-11 victims and
[1:19:25.360 --> 1:19:32.480]  surviving 9-11 victims but the Turk makes fun of me because I talk about CPS
[1:19:32.480 --> 1:19:36.320]  kidnapping kids and then he did a show and said I don't even know what CPS is
[1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:39.920]  and somebody said child protective services he said oh that's what my
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:46.600]  wife is so you know he's an airhead with an MSNBC show so I mean you know in the
[1:19:46.600 --> 1:19:50.480]  turd filled punch bowl I mean he's an even bigger turd in the making than
[1:19:50.480 --> 1:19:54.520]  Glenn Beck but I appreciate your call Tim I'm sorry to use an analogy like that
[1:19:54.520 --> 1:19:59.960]  I apologize that's wrong but the young Turk is a young turd we'll be right back

[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:19.160]  start getting to the financial news right now investors spooked as glitch sins gold
[1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:25.040]  the three thousand four hundred dollars an ounce yesterday this was on the heels
[1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:30.360]  of Bloomberg reporting gold rallying to one thousand five hundred as Soros
[1:24:30.360 --> 1:24:36.160]  bubble inflates reporting that the majority of future options that are
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:44.760]  held for the month of December are at one thousand five hundred dollars an ounce or more so we have all of that going on we have
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:50.600]  counties and cities and states going bankrupt all of this is unfolding right
[1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:53.640]  now because they're announcing that the Federal Reserve is going to begin
[1:24:53.640 --> 1:25:00.880]  monetizing more debt or going the Weimar Republic or Zimbabwe African model the
[1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:07.080]  German 1920s model 1930s model or the current model of Zimbabwe and of course
[1:25:07.080 --> 1:25:12.320]  I showed you yesterday a 50 or was it five trillion dollar it's actually in my
[1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:17.720]  wallet we guys give me my wallet it's over there thank you five trillion or
[1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:22.080]  was it 50 trillion note that it takes the British reporter was here said he
[1:25:22.080 --> 1:25:26.160]  just been in Africa and that that's what it takes to buy basically a bowl of
[1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:34.520]  soup and a drink yes here it is here it is 50 trillion dollars Reserve Bank of
[1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:43.760]  Zimbabwe hmm and you can get a little meal with that 50 trillion Bank of Zimbabwe
[1:25:43.760 --> 1:25:48.280]  so we've got that coming up with G. Edward Griffin really expert on the
[1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:51.960]  Federal Reserve author creatures like a island also gold rallying to one thousand
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:56.200]  five hundred is Soros bubble inflates I talked about that I briefly wanted to
[1:25:56.200 --> 1:26:01.080]  get Ted Anderson on because he said they got a lot of calls yesterday and that in
[1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:05.600]  fact near record amount of phone calls and people are really excited about the
[1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:10.080]  fact that Ted bought gold over a month ago when it was close to 80 dollars it's
[1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:14.640]  gone up over 13 dollars more today under what it is now and that Ted still got
[1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:18.560]  Frank's and sovereigns and a few other coins in plentiful supply though they're
[1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:22.680]  starting to run out that he can pass on the savings of when gold was a lot lower
[1:26:22.680 --> 1:26:27.800]  to you now you're not gonna find a better deal anywhere out there that you're
[1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:32.560]  gonna find with this radio special today Ted give people today's offer then I
[1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:36.560]  want to ask you about this bizarre thirty four hundred dollars spike yesterday
[1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:40.840]  and gold yeah well let's talk about the offer then the Frank is currently right
[1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:45.680]  now at 270 that's the same price I offered it to for the audience yesterday
[1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:52.160]  the prices climbed over 275 now on that particular coin gold hit a high today of
[1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:59.200]  1256 so far markets are still open so that is only four dollars away from the
[1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:03.320]  last market peak plus also it blows right through the resistance level which
[1:27:03.320 --> 1:27:08.800]  is at 1255 which means that it could go a heck of a lot further even through the
[1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:13.000]  the rest of this week you're talking about what happened in the spike in the
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:16.960]  marketplace it's just one of those glitches but you if you take a look at
[1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:20.800]  what's going on out there in the market people are very interested in gold not
[1:27:20.800 --> 1:27:24.960]  here and just in the United States but across China and India and all over the
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:28.960]  well Congress admits that there's massive gold manipulation by the big
[1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:34.920]  private central banks and what Bob Chapman and Kaiser and others have been
[1:27:34.920 --> 1:27:38.920]  saying is that they haven't been watching what's going on that's why we've
[1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:43.320]  seen really weird gyrations in the markets over the weekends and things and
[1:27:43.320 --> 1:27:47.800]  that they probably weren't there to hold it down for a little while so it raced
[1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:52.480]  up speculatively before they put the clamps on it yep that's that's that
[1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:56.680]  does happen you know and and so there's like you said Alex there's so much
[1:27:56.680 --> 1:28:00.480]  manipulation going on by the central banks of the world I mean they're
[1:28:00.480 --> 1:28:04.480]  fighting tooth and nail to keep people in their fiat money and when gold goes
[1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:09.160]  up that drives people away from fiat money into gold I mean gata was you know
[1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:12.560]  that when they when Bill Murphy did that lawsuit against the central banks
[1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:16.800]  that's what that was all about now I got a long as we're talking about banks
[1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:22.760]  problem bank list climbed to 829 that's at a market peak never seen before it
[1:28:22.760 --> 1:28:26.920]  used to be just two years ago that only 90 banks were in trouble now we've got
[1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:33.280]  829 on the list and FDIC which is the insurance company that guarantees your
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:39.760]  deposits at the banks has 15.2 billion dollars short on making that obligation
[1:28:39.760 --> 1:28:44.280]  work so that bottom line Ted you got great deals on gold and silver you bought
[1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:47.680]  it when it was cheaper you're selling it still with that debt a discount in this
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:54.480]  pistol hot firecracker hot red hot market the brokers are there how long can
[1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:58.520]  you hold the price on these gold and silver coins well I can tell you I'm
[1:28:58.520 --> 1:29:02.560]  gonna hold them till midnight tonight and depending upon where my supply is I'll
[1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:06.800]  take it through tomorrow but we will see because right now like you said Alex
[1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:10.720]  there's a lot of people buying a lot of interest in gold and silver it's not
[1:29:10.720 --> 1:29:15.080]  difficult to find customers to buy this stuff that's the easy part getting the
[1:29:15.080 --> 1:29:18.680]  material is getting tough again just like it was you know just a few years
[1:29:18.680 --> 1:29:27.440]  past all right let's fire out the number 800 686 2 to 3 7 800 686 2 to 3 7 but
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:32.840]  you've got the Frank's the Buffalo's and the British sovereigns you still got
[1:29:32.840 --> 1:29:39.760]  those at the lower price correct yep sure do 800 686 2 to 3 7 you've also got
[1:29:39.760 --> 1:29:44.240]  that freaking rational report on the fact that we are bankrupt by design 800
[1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:55.400]  686 2 to 3 7 thank you Ted we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:33.160]  saying conclusively the vaccines are killing people and causing brain damage
[1:34:33.160 --> 1:34:37.080]  and the government's back trying to push them again and they're suspending the
[1:34:37.080 --> 1:34:43.000]  old H1N1 but they're coming out with a new one we've got to warn people we had
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:47.120]  a big effect last year they're back with the fraud again this is a serious
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:54.000]  serious issue that is coming up but in the rest of this hour we're joined by G
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:59.600]  Edward Griffin G Edward Griffin and is an American filmmaker producer author
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:03.000]  and political lecturer he then began his career producing documentaries and
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:07.080]  books and is often debated topics like cancer the Federal Reserve and
[1:35:07.080 --> 1:35:12.640]  libertarian views the US Supreme Court terrorism subversion foreign policy
[1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:15.960]  he's the best-selling author of the Creeks from Jekyll Island and of course
[1:35:15.960 --> 1:35:20.080]  he also started Freedom Force International about taking control of
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:24.960]  our local state governments the long view of history you know we need the shock
[1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:28.760]  troops to be out there waking folks up and taking action but also just plotting
[1:35:28.760 --> 1:35:34.200]  forward every square inch of territory we take back from the globalist but on
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:39.240]  short notice I asked jaren to get him on today just to pop in because we need to
[1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:44.480]  be praying for Ron Paul I mean that's my view he says he wants an audit of not
[1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:48.000]  just the Federal Reserve and he's gotten very close to that and exposed that
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:52.800]  they're hiding something but he also wants them to audit the New York feds
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:59.520]  gold vaults a lot of secrecy there and Fort Knox we know there's been a lot of
[1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:03.240]  hanky-panky there and the gold confiscations of 33 and it being shipped
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:07.680]  overseas and they've been very secretive about this you talk about a stroke of
[1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:12.200]  genius to really expose the bankers demand that audit that they've always
[1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:17.440]  fought and say why can't we see the people's gold hmm of course they'll try
[1:36:17.440 --> 1:36:21.960]  to have a staged audit or something but the point is this is very exciting and
[1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:26.680]  also where he sees gold going where he sees the awakening going I just
[1:36:26.680 --> 1:36:30.920]  mentioned this with Ted Anderson investors spooked as glitch sins gold
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:36.560]  the 3400 an ounce yesterday I mean you've got Bloomberg reporting that most
[1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:42.280]  of the futures for the month of December the most popular future is 1500
[1:36:42.280 --> 1:36:48.420]  an ounce so you've got that going on so an expert on gold the free market the
[1:36:48.420 --> 1:36:51.440]  Federal Reserve all of it gee ever Griffin good to have you here with us
[1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:55.600]  well thanks Alex good to be back so much going on what do you want to tackle
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:36:59.480]  first of the subjects I raised I don't know I was just overwhelmed by the whole
[1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:04.120]  list thinking well what can what can I say that you you probably haven't already
[1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:11.120]  said ten times over I certainly agree that we need to pray for Ron Paul I mean
[1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:14.760]  that's this fellow's got more courage in his little fingernail that most people
[1:37:14.760 --> 1:37:19.640]  have in their whole body I mean here's a fellow that's not only doing all the
[1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:24.040]  things you mentioned but calling for a getting rid of the CIA now that takes
[1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:30.880]  some courage I would say so yeah but but more than prayer I think Ron Paul needs
[1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:36.240]  some support some good strong mass action support and some political support
[1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:42.480]  and probably financial support who doesn't need that but more to the to the
[1:37:42.480 --> 1:37:48.640]  issues Alex I think that the the calling for an audit of the gold supply is a
[1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:54.440]  brilliant maneuver I think Congressman Paul knows as well as you and I that
[1:37:54.440 --> 1:38:00.000]  there is no gold of any substance or any quantity in Fort Knox otherwise they
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:04.120]  would have displayed it long ago they've got some soldiers I understand
[1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:09.480]  guarding the gates around Fort Knox and that you can't get you know can't get
[1:38:09.480 --> 1:38:13.520]  into it it makes it look like they're guarding something but congressmen over
[1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:17.400]  the decades as you know and people can pull up these cases have wanted to go
[1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:21.520]  look at it and they're told no no no I mean you talk about brazen how this is
[1:38:21.520 --> 1:38:25.400]  just right out in the open yeah right out in the open and you know it's
[1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:29.800]  amazing to me how people like our neighbors down the street you can tell
[1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:33.240]  them about this and they'll look at this that well yeah that's interesting they
[1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:36.560]  don't get it you know they don't understand how these things really
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:40.720]  impact their own personal lives their own future their own security their own
[1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:45.400]  freedom and yet I mean it is serious is a heart attack do we what does the
[1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:51.080]  government have to back up it's you know economic power is it just military is
[1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:55.880]  that the only reason that the people accept American dollars is because of
[1:38:55.880 --> 1:38:59.600]  they don't they're gonna be bombed or because the police are gonna come and
[1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:05.160]  put them in prison but it also reveals how this shadow government confiscated
[1:39:05.160 --> 1:39:09.800]  the gold in 33 publicly ship most of it to Europe increase the price a year
[1:39:09.800 --> 1:39:13.960]  later enrich themselves we had all these national gold reserves we were
[1:39:13.960 --> 1:39:19.320]  partially gold back and now for what is it 60 years no one can look at it but
[1:39:19.320 --> 1:39:24.440]  they just say don't worry it's there and then act very suspicious you know the
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:28.440]  swindlers have run out the back door with it they may wheel in a you know a
[1:39:28.440 --> 1:39:32.720]  small portion of it or something if we do force an audit but it illustrates how
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:38.200]  how they just operate in total secrecy yeah and they really become less and
[1:39:38.200 --> 1:39:41.520]  less concerned about what the public thinks you know the public be damned
[1:39:41.520 --> 1:39:46.080]  they're just gonna do it anyway and it kind of reminds me as you were just
[1:39:46.080 --> 1:39:52.240]  saying that Alex remember during the the historic period in America where the in
[1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:56.200]  the days where the frontier was rapidly expanding they had what they called
[1:39:56.200 --> 1:40:01.200]  wildcat banks because there were banks opening up in territories where they
[1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:05.040]  didn't have too many people but they had lots of wildcats and they call them
[1:40:05.040 --> 1:40:09.760]  wildcat banks and there was a time in those days when you know banks were
[1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:14.640]  being exposed as being fraudulent because people were committed demand
[1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:19.760]  their money and their gold and in those days money was gold and what the banks
[1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:24.160]  would do is they put the out there in the lobby where people could see it and
[1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:29.840]  they had guards there they put the cakes of the nails out there and they cover
[1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:35.800]  the tops of the cakes with about two or three inches of gold coins and that they
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:39.440]  the people committed say oh they got a whole cake full of gold coins you know
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:43.600]  it's all everything's fine they go back and they continue to accept the the
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:47.440]  bank's paper notes I have a feeling that if they ever get around to the audit of
[1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:51.280]  the gold at Fort Knox we're probably gonna see a lot of cakes of nails in
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:55.080]  there with maybe some bars of gold that's another good point and she ever
[1:40:55.080 --> 1:40:58.360]  Griffin you talk about Ron Paul's courage I mean I'm not just here going oh
[1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:03.320]  Ron Paul so great oh he's so wonderful I say this about very few people he gets
[1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:08.280]  up and give speeches on television now saying the CIA has had a coup they're
[1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:12.280]  bringing in the drugs we need to abolish them I mean that gets people killed
[1:41:12.280 --> 1:41:16.160]  routinely I mean these people kill foreign leaders run the drugs the white
[1:41:16.160 --> 1:41:22.200]  slaves everything he's saying abolish the private Federal Reserve audit Fort
[1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:27.440]  Knox in the New York Fed's gold I mean these are swindler criminal murdering
[1:41:27.440 --> 1:41:33.200]  mafia who launched global wars who were eugenicist and I just hope people
[1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:41.400]  realize that Ron Paul it just quietly with dignity is literally a George
[1:41:41.400 --> 1:41:45.120]  Washington type character doesn't mean he's perfect but let me tell you he's
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:49.000]  for real and that's why Cass Sunstein and others have come out and admitted now
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:53.320]  we have this from the mainstream British news same paradigm there posing as
[1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:58.840]  patriots they say they're coming out posing as anti-New World Order people to
[1:41:58.840 --> 1:42:03.160]  attack real activist and that's why we see G. Edward Griffin being attacked Ron
[1:42:03.160 --> 1:42:07.880]  Paul myself and others because we're real so that's the attack from below and
[1:42:07.880 --> 1:42:10.960]  you're an expert on subversion for more than 50 years I want you to talk about
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:15.400]  that from the congressional hearings how they do this they're attacking us from
[1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:18.640]  the activist level because they think that has credibility because the
[1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:22.760]  mainstream media is discredited but they're also sitting in Sarah Palin and
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:28.880]  Glenn Beck to literally mimic what I'm doing and what others are doing to try
[1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:34.400]  to co-opt the Tea Party movement that Ron Paul and others were the
[1:42:34.400 --> 1:42:39.760]  progenitors of can you speak to that well somewhat yes because over the years I
[1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:44.720]  have studied how these people work and I do know of pretty much this is
[1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:50.080]  strategy that has worked repeatedly over decades and that they if they have
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:54.920]  opposition such as we're just talking about here whether it's Ron Paul or you
[1:42:54.920 --> 1:42:59.640]  or me or some little guy coming along just to speaking up with his local
[1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:03.760]  community they they know exactly how to deal with them and there are certain
[1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:08.680]  steps the first one is to ignore the opposition because usually it'll go away
[1:43:08.680 --> 1:43:11.600]  on its own you don't have to do anything don't have to attack it or anything
[1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:17.200]  just ignore it most people speaking out against this this collectivist empire
[1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:21.400]  the evil empire they have no funding they have no following they have no
[1:43:21.400 --> 1:43:25.200]  communicate way to communicate their ideas so they may make a little splash
[1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:28.520]  here and there and then they just sort of wither away you never hear from them
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:32.360]  again so the first step is to ignore them now if that doesn't work then they
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:39.720]  decide to discredit them they'll use their their media power to great extent
[1:43:39.720 --> 1:43:45.240]  to demonize people to make the average person consider that they are they're
[1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:49.160]  they're doing something illegal or something immoral or that they're a
[1:43:49.160 --> 1:43:54.080]  wacko or something like that just demonize them to peel off their support
[1:43:54.080 --> 1:43:58.280]  so they no longer have this financial support this following or this means of
[1:43:58.280 --> 1:44:03.480]  communication now if that doesn't work and it almost always that works but it's
[1:44:03.480 --> 1:44:08.920]  a few that make it through that barrier then the next step is to to buy them off
[1:44:08.920 --> 1:44:15.960]  to entice them with offers of employment or financial support sometimes
[1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:19.600]  these people don't even know they're being bought off I I have seen a couple
[1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:27.480]  of efforts in my life where people have had great wealth and and they have set
[1:44:27.480 --> 1:44:32.760]  up boards of directors and they've accepted money from compatriots that
[1:44:32.760 --> 1:44:37.040]  look I'll put a million dollars into your program I'll add to your money and you
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:41.200]  need more money I like what you're doing and then first thing and I said well
[1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:44.640]  how about being on your board of directors well sure you just gave us five
[1:44:44.640 --> 1:44:48.240]  million dollars that entitles you to be on the board then somebody else comes
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:50.800]  along and they're on the board of directors and I've seen this happen
[1:44:50.800 --> 1:44:55.920]  where it after about six or eight years all of a sudden the organization is
[1:44:55.920 --> 1:45:00.920]  completely dominated by the very people that they started off to oppose and
[1:45:00.920 --> 1:45:04.480]  sometimes don't just buy people off that said look we'll get you a nice villa
[1:45:04.480 --> 1:45:08.360]  we'll get you a yacht and you just go down to the Caribbean someplace and enjoy
[1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:12.240]  life and just get out of the way and then if that doesn't work finally they
[1:45:12.240 --> 1:45:16.480]  can bring in the jackals that they can start to play rough they can arrange a
[1:45:16.480 --> 1:45:21.400]  suicide or something like that this is a very known structured plan it has
[1:45:21.400 --> 1:45:26.400]  always worked in the past and anybody like Ron Paul or you Alex who stands up
[1:45:26.400 --> 1:45:30.880]  against these people we know that that's what we're facing and it's just some
[1:45:30.880 --> 1:45:34.720]  people said well why do you do that aren't you afraid well hell yes I'm
[1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:38.240]  afraid but that doesn't mean you stop you know I think every man that's ever
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:43.080]  gone into battle you know fighting for his country has been afraid there's
[1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:46.840]  nothing wrong with being afraid but you don't stop just because you're afraid
[1:45:46.840 --> 1:45:52.680]  and that's one of the reasons I salute Ron Paul well I mean when you really
[1:45:52.680 --> 1:45:56.800]  study the globalist plan they're not going to give us any quarter they're
[1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:00.280]  not going to just domesticate us and of course that's something I'd fight to the
[1:46:00.280 --> 1:46:05.880]  death to resist this is a scientific tyranny and I can't look at my children
[1:46:05.880 --> 1:46:10.240]  G. Abergryphon and not want to fight against tyranny with everything I've
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:14.440]  got or other people's children I mean liberty and freedom and being a free
[1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:20.560]  human is all that there is and I've gone way past being afraid I'm afraid of
[1:46:20.560 --> 1:46:25.160]  them killing me so I can't finish my work I'm afraid of being worldly and
[1:46:25.160 --> 1:46:29.760]  and stumbling or being manipulated or them setting something up to look like
[1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:34.320]  I sold out and because this is a devilish world and and the system sets a
[1:46:34.320 --> 1:46:40.560]  lot of pitfalls but the sickest thing is seeing my work terms I've coined things
[1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:47.520]  I've done taken and kind of twisted by Glenn Beck Sarah Palin to know from
[1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:53.200]  high-up people in Fox News who are patriots that Glenn Beck does tell
[1:46:53.200 --> 1:46:56.880]  other big radio shows that are involved with Fox News or Clear Channel don't
[1:46:56.880 --> 1:47:01.280]  have Alex Jones on and that he does have a team of people taking what I say and
[1:47:01.280 --> 1:47:06.240]  do and then twisting it what's your view of Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin cuz now
[1:47:06.240 --> 1:47:10.640]  she's going to Iowa it looks like she's gonna run for president and some
[1:47:10.640 --> 1:47:14.040]  pretty high-powered Hollywood insiders that we've been talking to say that the
[1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:19.080]  establishment wanted to energize the left-right paradigm with Obama get a
[1:47:19.080 --> 1:47:23.040]  bunch of the agenda through and that they are planning to try to put Palin in
[1:47:23.040 --> 1:47:28.360]  what's your view on that well I don't have any inside information but to me
[1:47:28.360 --> 1:47:36.200]  just looking at the outside these people fit the of the model perfectly of
[1:47:36.200 --> 1:47:41.960]  controlled opposition we know that the opposition has always tried I mean our
[1:47:41.960 --> 1:47:45.960]  opposition has always tried to control their own opposition whether it be left
[1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:51.160]  or right you know this has always been a favorite tactic and it usually works I
[1:47:51.160 --> 1:47:56.480]  think in terms of when the Federal Reserve System was created a little
[1:47:56.480 --> 1:48:01.880]  little example of that little microcosmic example the very people who
[1:48:01.880 --> 1:48:06.980]  were astride the banking system the the great financial powers that were
[1:48:06.980 --> 1:48:11.640]  supposed to be controlled by the Federal Reserve Act are the ones that wrote
[1:48:11.640 --> 1:48:16.640]  the Federal Reserve Act so that was bad enough but then having written it and
[1:48:16.640 --> 1:48:20.560]  during the debate period before it was passed by Congress these very people
[1:48:20.560 --> 1:48:25.040]  then went to the press began giving statements and speeches condemning their
[1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:28.940]  own act and saying this is bad for America this is going to be bad for
[1:48:28.940 --> 1:48:33.640]  business so that people would say oh yeah these bankers you know they they
[1:48:33.640 --> 1:48:38.200]  don't like this bill very much it must be pretty good these people are masters
[1:48:38.200 --> 1:48:43.120]  at manipulation their psycho politicians and this has been going on for
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:48.040]  almost for the very beginning well at least since the Woodrow Wilson
[1:48:48.040 --> 1:48:52.720]  administration so yeah we know what's going on today so who are the ones well
[1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:56.920]  you look around and it's pretty obvious I I agree with you Alex that you know
[1:48:56.920 --> 1:49:02.040]  that went back in Sarah Palin fit that pattern pretty well but that all you
[1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:07.560]  need to do and if you're a skeptic or let's say a cynic like I am an informed
[1:49:07.560 --> 1:49:11.520]  one you know what the political party system is the two-party system is
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:16.480]  completely controlled by the international globalist they're both the
[1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:21.600]  same and and so why would you think that anybody that has the blessing of the
[1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:26.880]  Republican Party would be you know able to break rid of that out of it it's
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:32.400]  impossible and they know that otherwise they would be part of the of the group
[1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:37.840]  exactly but not only is Glenn Beck trying to take on my political colorations
[1:49:37.840 --> 1:49:43.920]  of a patriot a constitutionalist your colorations Ron Paul's but at the same
[1:49:43.920 --> 1:49:50.080]  time they're also trying to block us and make us look bad and throwing stones
[1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:55.120]  at us occasionally and it's just very very frustrating because they have
[1:49:55.120 --> 1:49:59.480]  children too and I guess they just think they're on the winning team gee
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:04.360]  Edward Griffin well I guess that's it and and right now if you're going to be
[1:50:04.360 --> 1:50:08.640]  perfectly objective about it they are on the winning team at least for the
[1:50:08.640 --> 1:50:12.320]  short term not in the long term but right now you know we're looking at the
[1:50:12.320 --> 1:50:17.800]  next in a couple of years maybe the next two elections or so yeah these guys
[1:50:17.800 --> 1:50:22.960]  are coming up smelling like roses because they've got the mainstream media and
[1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:26.680]  unfortunately we're still at this point in America where people follow their
[1:50:26.680 --> 1:50:32.680]  their media opinion leaders so that's it right now and so what else is new let's
[1:50:32.680 --> 1:50:37.640]  get back into the battle and change it and that's why your long-term view where
[1:50:37.640 --> 1:50:43.800]  you get 60% turnouts for the Dominatrix Palin our 60% for the Harvard
[1:50:43.800 --> 1:50:49.920]  drughead Obama why don't we get 60% turnout locally why don't we take the
[1:50:49.920 --> 1:50:53.960]  counties and cities over and when you study the global collectivist they're
[1:50:53.960 --> 1:50:57.780]  putting almost all their energy into local takeovers we've got to take it
[1:50:57.780 --> 1:51:03.760]  back stay with us hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are
[1:51:03.760 --> 1:51:07.880]  now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did
[1:51:07.880 --> 1:51:11.480]  you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[1:51:11.480 --> 1:51:15.320]  than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in
[1:51:15.320 --> 1:51:19.240]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at
[1:51:19.240 --> 1:51:23.680]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they

[1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:24.520]  get him on with all that's happening in the economy you know G. Evergryphon I
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:29.320]  don't think we're good enough at tooting our own horn I mean we're good at
[1:54:29.320 --> 1:54:34.440]  tooting Ron Paul's horn and he deserves it I try to me you know point out the
[1:54:34.440 --> 1:54:39.880]  great work you've done for half a century and but I mean we've been right
[1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:44.520]  about everything collectivism the central bankers the world government the
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:48.760]  exact formula of world government how it would be announced what it would look
[1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:52.520]  like because we were reading their documents and we know what the next
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:57.600]  act is in the play if we don't stop them and so I just want to say here to you
[1:54:57.600 --> 1:55:03.040]  that I think we need to point out more just how right we've been and that we're
[1:55:03.040 --> 1:55:06.000]  so busy you know covering the latest info we don't have time to go back to
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:11.360]  our old films or books or shows we did 10 years ago but I think listeners should
[1:55:11.360 --> 1:55:15.640]  go through all of those and put them on YouTube and point out to people just how
[1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:19.760]  right we've been isn't that our ace in the hole that the system tried to deny
[1:55:19.760 --> 1:55:23.120]  that we were right but now people are really listening to us because they
[1:55:23.120 --> 1:55:27.560]  remember us laying out what was going on well right on target Alex I think
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:32.080]  they're quite right and I know I'm probably the worst promoter the worst
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:37.880]  marketer for my own stuff it's kind of a combination of being a little bit
[1:55:37.880 --> 1:55:43.240]  shy about it and also being pretty stupid I think because you know we do
[1:55:43.240 --> 1:55:48.280]  have to do that I I think one of the strongest reasons that my book on the
[1:55:48.280 --> 1:55:52.280]  federal reserve system is selling better now than it ever has it just the
[1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:56.200]  sales just I can't believe it it just continuing upward upward upward one of
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:59.840]  the reasons is because when when I wrote the thing and it was published back in
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:05.120]  1994 I had a chapter in there called the you know a look into the future of
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:11.040]  pessimistic scenario and I sort of was a whimsical view of what could happen if
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:14.440]  we stayed on the track we're on it's that we're looking for a certain place
[1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:19.680]  and this is where we're going to go and I laid out literally everything that has
[1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:24.040]  happened since I wrote the book all of this meltdown all of the bailouts all
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:29.040]  of the all of these incredible expansion of the money supply and everything
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:32.680]  including some of even the language I just dreamed it up I thought if I were
[1:56:32.680 --> 1:56:37.680]  if I were a slime bag politician trying to cover this up for a banker what
[1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:41.520]  language would I use to make it sound good how can I spin it to make it sound
[1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:45.960]  good so I just invented phrases and things like that and I'll be darned if
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:50.400]  these guys today aren't using the same the same phrases and words that I
[1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:55.560]  dreamed up so people think I must I had a crystal ball not so just use that a
[1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:59.800]  moment ago it's because we read their stuff we know what they do and so we
[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:04.160]  also know what they're going to do yet in the future and if that doesn't scare
[1:57:04.160 --> 1:57:07.880]  that kind of you and get you off the couch and get busy I don't know what
[1:57:07.880 --> 1:57:12.680]  we got a lot going for us in the pro-human pro-liberty movement something
[1:57:12.680 --> 1:57:16.640]  going against us though is there's now the internet has empowered us to get our
[1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:20.000]  message out like never before but it's also created billions of different
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:24.840]  voices everybody claims they've got the truth but look at who really has it look
[1:57:24.840 --> 1:57:29.400]  who's been right and look who has the giant audiences without government or
[1:57:29.400 --> 1:57:33.080]  Fox News backing it's G. Edward Griffin it's Alex Jones it's people like that
[1:57:33.080 --> 1:57:36.440]  because I mean I've got Rockefeller documents that we just found this week
[1:57:36.440 --> 1:57:41.000]  where they admit they create vaccines with a tetanus shot to sterilize women
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:45.800]  I've been talking about that since the mid 90s I mean we really do have their
[1:57:45.800 --> 1:57:49.640]  documents and something else going against us is this stuff is just so
[1:57:49.640 --> 1:57:55.240]  over-the-top crazy but isn't history stranger than fiction I mean as they've
[1:57:55.240 --> 1:58:01.120]  said well I can't think of anything more bizarre and more dramatic than the
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:06.880]  recent history of the world I mean when I say recent I mean since well since I
[1:58:06.880 --> 1:58:11.640]  was born I mean it's been a wild Mr. Toad's ride and I can't imagine any
[1:58:11.640 --> 1:58:16.440]  sci-fi author dreaming of anything more dramatic than the reality it has been a
[1:58:16.440 --> 1:58:20.360]  wild Mr. Toad ride and the globalist would have us believe that weasels
[1:58:20.360 --> 1:58:24.160]  haven't taken over Toad Hall but we know they have and G. Edward Griffin and
[1:58:24.160 --> 1:58:28.480]  myself and many others are together to retake Toad Hall now that he's doing a
[1:58:28.480 --> 1:58:32.840]  win-in-the-willows parable let me say bye to you during the break your phone

[2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:43.160]  hour of worldwide transmission and I know we've had callers holding and I've
[2:00:43.160 --> 2:00:47.560]  got a ton of news and several video clips that I've got to get to so I'm
[2:00:47.560 --> 2:00:52.480]  gonna talk to Desmond, TAC, Brad, John and Andrew at least then I'm gonna get
[2:00:52.480 --> 2:00:56.720]  into the news and then more calls we have time in this hour but Desmond in
[2:00:56.720 --> 2:01:01.000]  New York you're on the air thanks for holding yeah how you doing Alex good
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:04.840]  sir I want to thank you a lot for everything you've done educating the
[2:01:04.840 --> 2:01:10.120]  public there's a few things I want to get to last couple months I've been
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:14.560]  hearing am I loud enough yes sir you hear me all right last couple months I've
[2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:18.680]  been hearing you know about the sterility and the vaccines and everything
[2:01:18.680 --> 2:01:22.440]  and really thinking about you know I'm calling you right now on my cell phone
[2:01:22.440 --> 2:01:26.280]  and all this radiation that we're pumping through our bodies every day with
[2:01:26.280 --> 2:01:29.720]  these cell phones we got them in our pockets next to our genitals all day
[2:01:29.720 --> 2:01:33.920]  like I was just really thinking that's got to be something with the
[2:01:33.920 --> 2:01:39.440]  sterility to you know and well that's a good point the cell phones are active
[2:01:39.440 --> 2:01:44.080]  while they're not transmitting they're being pinged by the GPS locator
[2:01:44.080 --> 2:01:50.200]  towers that the triangulation system they also use them to surveil but if
[2:01:50.200 --> 2:01:53.800]  people are gonna have cell phones and be using them I'm gonna use the free iPhone
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:57.560]  app to reach them in the matrix I want to get them out of the matrix but I do
[2:01:57.560 --> 2:02:03.040]  have phones I'm not on my phone a lot I keep it away from me I make quick calls
[2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:10.240]  when I need to and the studies show that it's after several minutes that it
[2:02:10.240 --> 2:02:16.960]  really starts causing DNA problems and that after an hour or so of a long cell
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:22.000]  phone call it even heats the brain so yes that that is another big part of it
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:27.360]  Desmond I've just been waiting on about an hour you know waiting to get on our
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:31.120]  worth of radiation going straight to my brain but well you know that's another
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:34.000]  point let me interrupt you because I always mean to make this we have phones
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:39.600]  for everybody in my office we have IP phones work great everybody's got one
[2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:45.360]  almost no one uses them they all the sales guys everyone use their iPhones
[2:02:45.360 --> 2:02:48.880]  and I go in and I tell them please use the company phone I don't want you on
[2:02:48.880 --> 2:02:51.920]  your cell phone I don't want you to have to pay for the calls you're making and
[2:02:51.920 --> 2:02:55.020]  they just will not listen and they say look I'm going to use my cell phone it's
[2:02:55.020 --> 2:03:00.640]  mine I like it Jaren will you actually use the company phone but I mean it's
[2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:07.200]  just an example of how insane it is go ahead sorry no I heard you about one
[2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:12.040]  month or two ago you're talking with man cow about how you know kids these days
[2:03:12.040 --> 2:03:16.840]  are just really they won't approach women they won't talk to them at all you
[2:03:16.840 --> 2:03:21.200]  know and I was really thinking cell phone like with texting these days kids
[2:03:21.200 --> 2:03:25.360]  they're kids are too afraid to talk it's more than that studies have come out the
[2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:30.480]  language is being destroyed young people use about half the words that the
[2:03:30.480 --> 2:03:34.720]  previous generation used the previous generation uses less words than
[2:03:34.720 --> 2:03:38.680]  generation before them have you tried to read a mainstream just common man's
[2:03:38.680 --> 2:03:46.000]  newspaper from 1778 I mean it's like reading poetry or something and long
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:51.800]  complex words go go try it and they weren't trying to be show-offs then they
[2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:57.320]  were into language they weren't drinking bisphenol a and fluoride they weren't
[2:03:57.320 --> 2:04:00.760]  texting and I try to talk to young people now and they just literally go
[2:04:00.760 --> 2:04:07.640]  and and and or or like poopy I mean that's about as much talker or like I
[2:04:07.640 --> 2:04:14.960]  like the movies and and and and and so that's why the system not like new
[2:04:14.960 --> 2:04:20.760]  video game and and you know I mean either the guys are laughing at this
[2:04:20.760 --> 2:04:24.480]  either now they're some young people that are really awake really smart know
[2:04:24.480 --> 2:04:28.720]  what's going on but yes I mean I have the same problem my office that's smart
[2:04:28.720 --> 2:04:34.960]  folks but text messaging and I am's don't relay all the info and so there's
[2:04:34.960 --> 2:04:39.320]  constant misunderstandings disinformation mistakes I go use the
[2:04:39.320 --> 2:04:46.000]  telephone to call each other the telephone the telephone talk to humans
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:50.520]  it's just like people 20 30 years ago the average person was real good at you

[2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:26.120]  finally speak to you buddy it is a pleasure to talk to you I hope I live
[2:10:26.120 --> 2:10:31.320]  up to it you know I'm not like a dirt sandwich one of these days I truly believe
[2:10:31.320 --> 2:10:34.120]  your name is gonna be in the hefty books from the man responsible for saving
[2:10:34.120 --> 2:10:41.600]  America I can just save us from eugenics extermination I'd be happy I just want
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:44.520]  to tell everybody there's a good you know everybody's probably having the same
[2:10:44.520 --> 2:10:49.240]  problem that I had trying to get people to believe but when you tell people doing
[2:10:49.240 --> 2:10:51.680]  they don't want to believe it they're putting poisons in the food and the
[2:10:51.680 --> 2:10:55.000]  water and the vaccines and kidnapping children there's too much for them to
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:59.320]  believe but there's where we can make chemtrails work for us what I do I go
[2:10:59.320 --> 2:11:03.080]  out to I do a lot of road trips on a motorcycle so I go to a lot of motorcycle
[2:11:03.080 --> 2:11:06.840]  rallies we'll go to any place soccer events or little league games where
[2:11:06.840 --> 2:11:10.200]  there's a lot of families when there's chemtrails in the sky and you point up
[2:11:10.200 --> 2:11:12.760]  and you say because people don't look up in the sky you say do you know what
[2:11:12.760 --> 2:11:16.280]  that is and I'll tell you know you tell them you give them a little card that
[2:11:16.280 --> 2:11:20.600]  says it has a URL for the chemtrails video on Google they go home and watch
[2:11:20.600 --> 2:11:23.240]  that because your kid's life you'd explain a little bit what about what's
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:26.560]  about and they can see the proof with their own eyes they look up there and
[2:11:26.560 --> 2:11:29.920]  they know that's not something that should be in the sky and once they watch
[2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:33.240]  that video then they can believe that you're trying to kill everybody and that
[2:11:33.240 --> 2:11:38.600]  really works like a champ absolutely great points anything else that's it
[2:11:38.600 --> 2:11:42.960]  I just want to keep up the good work buddy God bless you tack let's talk to
[2:11:42.960 --> 2:11:48.400]  Brad and Idaho hey Alex hey buddy and honor to talk to you honor to talk to
[2:11:48.400 --> 2:11:54.280]  you yes I can you're a hero of mine you know in the in the actual histories of
[2:11:54.280 --> 2:12:00.920]  the time in the court records and in even the newspapers a hooker arrested
[2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:05.240]  about a hundred prostitutes to bring discipline to the army so what you said
[2:12:05.240 --> 2:12:09.920]  about hooker is absolutely easy to prove false well then the pbs documentaries
[2:12:09.920 --> 2:12:16.520]  and things I've seen about hookers girls I'm going from memory but I believe it
[2:12:16.520 --> 2:12:21.200]  became such a big scandal that then he staged some bust but but I mean let me
[2:12:21.200 --> 2:12:24.600]  just look at the origin of the word hooker guys will you search engine that
[2:12:24.600 --> 2:12:34.480]  let me see origin of the word hooker but okay we'll see if I'm corrected go
[2:12:34.480 --> 2:12:38.680]  ahead starts with general hooker because he arrested some prostitutes to bring
[2:12:38.680 --> 2:12:44.080]  discipline to the army in Washington DC you know the sad thing about the
[2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:50.040]  patriot movement is to this day they still slander the north incredibly bad
[2:12:50.040 --> 2:12:56.800]  it's really sad and the north were great great brave men and so was the south
[2:12:56.800 --> 2:13:01.480]  but but it's not I've been in the patriot movement for over 20 years and all
[2:13:01.480 --> 2:13:05.880]  sir listen listen I mean I'm not going to you know to confederate meetings or
[2:13:05.880 --> 2:13:10.920]  anything and I've just pointed out the facts that British intelligence financed
[2:13:10.920 --> 2:13:16.840]  the south the south had real grievances over taxes being unduly put on
[2:13:16.840 --> 2:13:22.480]  agriculture not industry and I understand that that was a manipulated
[2:13:22.480 --> 2:13:27.240]  contrivancy and that then the British put troops in Canada and Toronto and
[2:13:27.240 --> 2:13:37.080]  threatened to invade but again I'm not here slandering the north that's what
[2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:40.920]  I've read and seen you may have a different historical interpretation but
[2:13:40.920 --> 2:13:45.640]  I'm not obsessed with it neither am I but the root cause even though the
[2:13:45.640 --> 2:13:49.200]  bankers took advantage of it the root cause was the aristocrats did not want
[2:13:49.200 --> 2:13:53.320]  to give up their slaves and the real name of the war should be called the war
[2:13:53.320 --> 2:13:59.120]  to stop new slave states so and I love southern people don't get me wrong but
[2:13:59.120 --> 2:14:04.280]  it is sad that we slander so much that we and then same with like Alexander
[2:14:04.280 --> 2:14:10.080]  Hamilton he was a great man he just disagreed he wanted George Washington to
[2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:17.960]  be a king well he wanted he wanted a a bank similar to North Dakota now as far
[2:14:17.960 --> 2:14:21.160]  as him wanting George Washington to be a king I think that should be analyzed
[2:14:21.160 --> 2:14:25.840]  also listen I gotta jump I gotta jump Brad I appreciate your call they're
[2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:29.200]  pulling up encyclopedias they're pulling up a bunch of stuff all saying
[2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:33.240]  hookers are called hookers because general hooker allowed the women to stay
[2:14:33.240 --> 2:14:37.720]  in camp and I do remember that he then got in trouble for it and staged a bust
[2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:44.840]  for the media but I mean it's just it's just amazing I mean you know the fact
[2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:48.320]  is the south was out number two to one the south didn't have a single cannon
[2:14:48.320 --> 2:14:52.400]  factory the south one most of the battle so they got worn out and beat most of
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:57.440]  the north didn't want to be in the war Abraham Lincoln said he that that the
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:01.440]  war was not about slavery my issue is what we're told about the Civil War is
[2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:07.920]  a lie okay here it is origin of the word hooker this is Yahoo answers and the
[2:15:07.920 --> 2:15:10.760]  US Civil War the armies were generally followed by contingent of camp
[2:15:10.760 --> 2:15:14.480]  followers including prostitutes general hooker was particularly lenient about
[2:15:14.480 --> 2:15:18.520]  allowing them in camp and they came to be called hookers army of hooker girls
[2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:23.120]  now that's what I've seen on PBS and everywhere else that made it beat not be
[2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:27.160]  true I mean it hell it won't be the first time I've bought mainstream media
[2:15:27.160 --> 2:15:31.440]  saying something but we're looking high and low for this thing about hooker
[2:15:31.440 --> 2:15:35.240]  fighting hookers and so he's called they're called hookers but that's not
[2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:40.360]  what I know historically man I've been coughing all day I don't know what's
[2:15:40.360 --> 2:15:45.800]  going on here hmm let's go ahead I gotta move quicker I'll never get to all
[2:15:45.800 --> 2:15:51.040]  this I want to talk to everybody though John in Minnesota you're on the air
[2:15:51.040 --> 2:15:56.560]  sorry today good buddy good I just wanted to call and express
[2:15:56.560 --> 2:16:01.280]  agreements here it's your tax settlement sponsors are very repulsive and
[2:16:01.280 --> 2:16:07.640]  they do pollute your message okay my sponsors are very repulsive and it
[2:16:07.640 --> 2:16:11.560]  dilutes my message well I hear the sponsors and I appreciate your call and
[2:16:11.560 --> 2:16:19.000]  a lot of other shows and I I know Genesis refuses a lot more ads than most
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:24.280]  other radio networks and things it's like we had Kramer running ad packages
[2:16:24.280 --> 2:16:29.400]  all over the country and for his Wall Street tips and people complained about
[2:16:29.400 --> 2:16:34.080]  it and Ted refused their money because you complained but then I hear the ad on
[2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:37.440]  rush Limbaugh and everywhere else and I'm sure that's just fine with his listeners
[2:16:37.440 --> 2:16:43.120]  so you know I'm certainly you know here's the deal there is no way to be
[2:16:43.120 --> 2:16:49.080]  lily pure in this world okay there's no way to be to be perfect I have turned
[2:16:49.080 --> 2:16:53.760]  out bona fide sellouts to the New World Order repeatedly that would have made me
[2:16:53.760 --> 2:16:57.680]  as fabulously rich as Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh okay I've been offered those
[2:16:57.680 --> 2:17:02.280]  deals I'm every much as good a talk show host or better than they are and I was
[2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:06.200]  offered to be the Glenn Beck the Glenn Beck is today before Glenn Beck was even
[2:17:06.200 --> 2:17:10.000]  on the radar screen okay repeatedly I've been told you'll be all over the
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:13.840]  country you'll have tens of millions in book deals tens of millions a year you'll
[2:17:13.840 --> 2:17:19.000]  have TV shows you know you're gonna be the next rush Limbaugh by the the system
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:25.160]  and I said no but then I do it my way so I can have my own radio show and really
[2:17:25.160 --> 2:17:31.080]  say what I think and really what I believe but Ted Anderson has sales guys
[2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:37.080]  and has ads and then I have my ads and I tend to like all the Ted sponsors I
[2:17:37.080 --> 2:17:42.720]  think they're pretty good and I believe in all of my sponsors and we turn down
[2:17:42.720 --> 2:17:47.840]  most people that come to us most folks don't do that I've been in I've been in
[2:17:47.840 --> 2:17:51.600]  radio for 15 years let me tell you something there's a nobody more moral
[2:17:51.600 --> 2:17:57.440]  than this radio network and myself when it comes to this type of stuff but at the
[2:17:57.440 --> 2:18:01.720]  end of the day I do hear ads and things that like you know with ridiculous
[2:18:01.720 --> 2:18:08.160]  voices going into the world better buy this and it sounds like big birds doing
[2:18:08.160 --> 2:18:12.760]  the ad but so what okay at the end of the day I believe in preparedness so let
[2:18:12.760 --> 2:18:18.320]  them have big bird voice their ad or Oscar the Grouch voice their ad I mean
[2:18:18.320 --> 2:18:23.080]  it's just it's insane okay again the whole new world order is coming down on
[2:18:23.080 --> 2:18:27.320]  us I just read Rockefeller documents in the last two weeks to you and where
[2:18:27.320 --> 2:18:31.040]  they came from with links to the Rockefeller Foundation where they
[2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:35.800]  develop vaccines to sterilize you to be added to regular vaccines we know this
[2:18:35.800 --> 2:18:39.360]  is going on we know they're putting poison in the water we know they're
[2:18:39.360 --> 2:18:42.920]  gearing up all these new wars we know we're going into a depression and the
[2:18:42.920 --> 2:18:49.200]  guy calls in complaining about my sponsors I don't know I'll tell you
[2:18:49.200 --> 2:18:55.040]  this if somebody gave me three million dollars a year no strings attached I
[2:18:55.040 --> 2:19:01.960]  could do my radio show and my websites in my films and everything I do and not
[2:19:01.960 --> 2:19:06.280]  have advertisers or sponsors or sell anything I could produce films give them
[2:19:06.280 --> 2:19:12.080]  out free everything but I couldn't be on talk radio because the format of talk
[2:19:12.080 --> 2:19:17.360]  radio is commercials for the local station let me explain to you who has

[2:24:25.480 --> 2:24:34.640]  racial violence and they're definitely going with the racial uprising selling
[2:24:34.640 --> 2:24:38.760]  angle here in the United States and in Latin America when they got caught doing
[2:24:38.760 --> 2:24:42.720]  it here in the US they backed off and played dumb but now they're back at it
[2:24:42.720 --> 2:24:46.120]  and I'm really worried thinking Rodriguez may have lied when he said he was
[2:24:46.120 --> 2:24:49.240]  going to cut the race war stuff out of his movie so we're going to find out this
[2:24:49.240 --> 2:24:55.720]  Friday very serious this isn't a joke in Mexico they're now having thousands of
[2:24:55.720 --> 2:25:03.400]  murders a month they'll dig up 25 bodies 72 bodies 60 something bodies and the
[2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:09.280]  Hispanics from Latin America who are coming into Mexico the police rob them
[2:25:09.280 --> 2:25:13.720]  and kill them they are the Los Zetas that's just their cover name and they
[2:25:13.720 --> 2:25:17.120]  just murder men women and children if they don't pay their cut a lot of the
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:22.480]  rich Hispanics that run the Southwest are the El Hefe's on our side and then
[2:25:22.480 --> 2:25:27.120]  they're involved in sucking off of the Mexicans and the Latin Americans and
[2:25:27.120 --> 2:25:32.800]  we've done the study of it and the big banks are financing it this video that
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:37.360]  Aaron Dykes put together is really detailing all of this but I wanted to
[2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:43.520]  finish up with this attack on bar in Cancun leaves eight dead and this is in
[2:25:43.520 --> 2:25:48.040]  the tourist district and the gang showed up said pay us protection money we're
[2:25:48.040 --> 2:25:51.800]  going to burn your place down and they didn't so they burned it down with
[2:25:51.800 --> 2:25:58.280]  tourists in it and one society goes corrupt this is just how it is and of
[2:25:58.280 --> 2:26:02.640]  the mayor or anybody tries to do anything they'll just kill them and then
[2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:06.920]  this is what this is what our country's turning into me Mexico is literally like
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:13.280]  a road warrior right now it is road warrior it is road warrior and areas that
[2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:17.960]  were safe are now road warrior more mayors killed yesterday more mass
[2:26:17.960 --> 2:26:22.640]  murder more death I mean and you hear a little Metsha and La Raza all hooked in
[2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:27.000]  with these with these pimp groups complaining about Mexico murdering
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:30.720]  Hispanic children and mass and killing men women and children no no that's not
[2:26:30.720 --> 2:26:36.960]  talked about it's all mythical gringo minute men are crucifying Catholic
[2:26:36.960 --> 2:26:41.160]  priests and murdering Hispanic children none of its real but it's in Robert
[2:26:41.160 --> 2:26:47.480]  Rodriguez's Fox news core that's who made the movie that's who produced it just
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:51.320]  like they're funding the mosque through the through the through the co-owner of
[2:26:51.320 --> 2:26:55.720]  Fox News and the rest of its Rockefeller money they run it all they run the
[2:26:55.720 --> 2:26:59.960]  white supremacist they run the black supremacist they run the Mexican
[2:26:59.960 --> 2:27:06.080]  supremacist they finance and radicalize Islam I mean this is a fact and they've
[2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:10.400]  really got it figured out attack on bar in Cancun leaves eight dead eight people
[2:27:10.400 --> 2:27:15.240]  were killed when a gang burned down a bar in the resort city of Cancun and it
[2:27:15.240 --> 2:27:22.440]  goes on to say a commando of at least ten armed men attacked Castillo del Mar a
[2:27:22.440 --> 2:27:27.200]  nightclub he goes on the blaze quickly spread overwhelming six women who
[2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:31.040]  worked in the establishment two male customers according to el denaro
[2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:36.640]  newspaper and that says that the man was detained for trying to extort 40,000
[2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:41.120]  pesos or $3,000 from the bar in exchange for protection it's kind of like
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:46.200]  government you know we want to protect you so pay us taxes meanwhile that they're
[2:27:46.200 --> 2:27:50.320]  the criminals and it goes on to say how they cartels expanding just robbing
[2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:55.160]  everyone and of course I'm sure it's gringo's fault probably my fault right
[2:27:55.160 --> 2:28:00.000]  well in a way it is the gringo's fault it is the big banks in the US and Aaron's
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:05.280]  article has all those documents Arizona governor says the first they learned of
[2:28:05.280 --> 2:28:08.880]  the UN investigating them was from the internet now they've confirmed Obama is
[2:28:08.880 --> 2:28:14.080]  seeking the UN a foreign power on Arizona because Arizona doesn't want
[2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:19.160]  they're already the capital of kidnappings in the US and they're
[2:28:19.160 --> 2:28:22.080]  imploding and falling apart and they've already pulled the border patrol out of
[2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:27.760]  the border areas that's mainstream news and it's not enough again Obama's part
[2:28:27.760 --> 2:28:31.920]  of the criminal mafias that are all part of this and so they're gonna
[2:28:31.920 --> 2:28:35.920]  continue it and that's just the way it is yeah and then they want this whole
[2:28:35.920 --> 2:28:39.200]  Mexican mafia system here in the future you don't hand your business over to
[2:28:39.200 --> 2:28:42.040]  government they'll just claim the law said has came by and killed you they're

[2:28:46.240 --> 2:28:49.560]  course we had cellicastello DEA agent on six years ago saying this was all
[2:28:49.560 --> 2:28:53.320]  coming and being shut up and of course it all came true and just when it works
[2:28:53.320 --> 2:28:57.000]  good the government hates it you still got guns though they love it that
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:01.400]  Mexicans are disarmed so the El Hefe's and the gangs and the cops and the mob
[2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:06.960]  can just rape your wife kill your kids murder you rape you in the town square

[2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:15.480]  procedure and then the cops don't do anything because they're on the take a
[2:29:15.480 --> 2:29:20.240]  lot of times it's the cops doing it and we're all gonna live like they do in

[2:34:07.680 --> 2:34:11.560]  that vaccine science doesn't have some truth to it I'm not an anti-technology
[2:34:11.560 --> 2:34:16.640]  guy I'm telling you big farmers a bunch of murder and eugenesis on records
[2:34:16.640 --> 2:34:23.520]  contracting with the Rockefellers and others in the UN to hurt you bad we've
[2:34:23.520 --> 2:34:27.400]  got mainstream government documents all of it up on info wars and prison
[2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:31.440]  planets today so that's coming up then some other news but here is Machete
[2:34:31.440 --> 2:34:36.000]  where I break down the history of this movie how it's coming out and it's more
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:41.880]  than just the movie it shows how Fox News news core is the company putting this
[2:34:41.880 --> 2:34:46.120]  movie out and at first their neocons attacked it then found out it was their
[2:34:46.120 --> 2:34:53.040]  property Fox pulled the articles and then Rodriguez played dumb and said you
[2:34:53.040 --> 2:34:57.280]  don't have the script you know this isn't real then later he admitted okay it
[2:34:57.280 --> 2:35:01.240]  might cause race violence I'm cutting out the violent stuff now he's had the
[2:35:01.240 --> 2:35:07.240]  producer come out and say that I'm basically a liar and so I don't know
[2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:11.600]  what is going on with this but we're gonna find out when this movie comes out
[2:35:11.600 --> 2:35:16.240]  all right let's go ahead and play the clip here it is that this video is up on
[2:35:16.240 --> 2:35:21.000]  info wars calm and prison planet calm and the headline on it is will machete
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:26.640]  real release will machete release spark racial violence and it could cause some
[2:35:26.640 --> 2:35:31.680]  good old boys you know to get violent with Hispanics that's what Hispanics are
[2:35:31.680 --> 2:35:37.160]  concerned about I mean this is a this is dangerous if it's being put out the way
[2:35:37.160 --> 2:35:41.800]  the script says it is and the Arizona trailer we didn't cross the border of
[2:35:41.800 --> 2:35:45.840]  the border crossed us and the images of illegals hacking whitey up with machetes
[2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:48.560]  here it is
[2:35:53.080 --> 2:35:58.320]  it's August 31st 2010 three days from now machete is gonna premiere in theaters
[2:35:58.320 --> 2:36:03.920]  across North America going back about three months ago Hispanic members of
[2:36:03.920 --> 2:36:08.280]  Robert Rodriguez's film crew here in Austin Texas contacted me and said they
[2:36:08.280 --> 2:36:11.480]  were really concerned about the film's message and then it was very very
[2:36:11.480 --> 2:36:15.960]  divisive and then it would reflect badly on Hispanics not just create racial
[2:36:15.960 --> 2:36:20.800]  division then I got a copy of the script the script that they used for the
[2:36:20.800 --> 2:36:28.200]  film and it is a race war that bills white people as the devil and mr. Trejo
[2:36:28.200 --> 2:36:33.640]  the star machete or machete as a folk hero who they then pray and worship at
[2:36:33.640 --> 2:36:39.040]  the end of the film and it's got gringos out sacrificing crucifying Catholic
[2:36:39.040 --> 2:36:43.840]  priests killing Hispanic children it's over the top it's like a Hispanic version
[2:36:43.840 --> 2:36:55.280]  of birth of the nation I mean this is really dangerous stuff and then
[2:36:55.280 --> 2:37:00.160]  Rodriguez told a cool news that okay I had too much tequila and I am gonna cut
[2:37:00.160 --> 2:37:04.680]  some stuff out of the film it could cause some problems and I thought wow you
[2:37:04.680 --> 2:37:08.520]  know that was my job was just simply to point out to him that people on his own
[2:37:08.520 --> 2:37:11.960]  crew were concerned and that he should think about what he's doing because this
[2:37:11.960 --> 2:37:15.760]  could cause racial conflict I'm all for his first amendment but I have my first
[2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:19.000]  amendment right to criticize it and I said let's wait and see what comes out
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:24.200]  when the film's released well then I happen to be in a hamburger place with
[2:37:24.200 --> 2:37:28.880]  my kids Saturday and I see the front page of the statesman dealing with the
[2:37:28.880 --> 2:37:35.200]  film machete commission must decide a machete qualifies for funds and they've
[2:37:35.200 --> 2:37:39.560]  got yours truly Alex Jones quoted in here and the producer of the film is in
[2:37:39.560 --> 2:37:44.040]  the newspaper saying that we made it up that we have the script really we made
[2:37:44.040 --> 2:37:49.480]  up the Arizona trailer with all those big stars saying those things we made up
[2:37:49.480 --> 2:37:53.200]  that we got the script we made it up that Robert Rodriguez told in it cool
[2:37:53.200 --> 2:37:58.280]  news that he did cut stuff out because it was racially incendiary the special
[2:37:58.280 --> 2:38:09.000]  cinco the mile message to Arizona I don't know what film is being released on
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:14.160]  Friday but I am concerned about the fact that it's gonna hype people up to go
[2:38:14.160 --> 2:38:18.000]  out and commit acts of violence with all the stuff going on in Arizona so we're
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:23.040]  gonna find out this weekend whether or not Rodriguez has put out his race war
[2:38:23.040 --> 2:38:27.840]  film and we're gonna find out if this guy is a total opportunist because what
[2:38:27.840 --> 2:38:34.080]  this does is it plays on fears of immigrants it tries to export America
[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:39.600]  phobia that does go on in Mexico to the rest of Latin America all over central
[2:38:39.600 --> 2:38:43.880]  and South America and on the island of Puerto Rico they are putting up these
[2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:49.160]  big posters with an image of a bloody machete in a hand dripping with blood
[2:38:49.160 --> 2:38:55.160]  saying everyone with machete like it's a political uprising and if you know
[2:38:55.160 --> 2:38:59.800]  Central and South America and Mexico's history the machete is the symbol of the
[2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:03.640]  peasant uprising because they've been disarmed they're not allowed to own guns
[2:39:03.640 --> 2:39:07.880]  so they use their farm implements and the machete is kind of like the pitch
[2:39:07.880 --> 2:39:12.960]  fork in European lore because they were disarmed and so here's Rodriguez with a
[2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:17.200]  worldwide promotion of this in the streets of Latin American cities with an
[2:39:17.200 --> 2:39:21.080]  image of a blood-dripping machete and then when you go see the film at least
[2:39:21.080 --> 2:39:25.280]  from what the script says it's all about evil gringos that must die because
[2:39:25.280 --> 2:39:30.320]  they're oppressing the Raza or the race and it's also come out that the Ford
[2:39:30.320 --> 2:39:33.760]  Foundation the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation the Rockefeller Foundation
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:38.800]  and others have given billions of dollars total to this liberation theology at
[2:39:38.800 --> 2:39:42.680]  the universities not just here in the United States but all over the world so
[2:39:42.680 --> 2:39:46.880]  the system wants Hispanics whites and blacks to beat each other's throats and
[2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:50.880]  they don't want Hispanics to feel like they're Americans and become pro-second
[2:39:50.880 --> 2:39:56.480]  amendment no it's got to be a machete do you get the anti-gun message here in
[2:39:56.480 --> 2:40:00.480]  so many horror movies and films the people are always you know preyed upon
[2:40:00.480 --> 2:40:04.280]  by the criminals of the zombies because they don't have guns Hollywood will not
[2:40:04.280 --> 2:40:08.000]  show that image of people with guns defending themselves so we've got
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:12.760]  Robert Rodriguez blurring the lines between politics and his race war film
[2:40:12.760 --> 2:40:18.240]  and then having his surrogates of the producer in the statesman saying there's
[2:40:18.240 --> 2:40:22.480]  none of this in the script none of this is going on this is crazy when his own
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:26.840]  people contacted me and I have the script and we have the Arizona trailer
[2:40:26.840 --> 2:40:31.000]  and Rodriguez is out there saying yeah I cut this stuff out it goes a little
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:37.040]  too far so I'm seeing a lot of deception from their camp and for their sake I
[2:40:37.040 --> 2:40:40.440]  hope they have cut the really hardcore race war stuff out because of that
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:44.520]  actually showed in theaters around the country I'd say 99% chance you're
[2:40:44.520 --> 2:40:47.640]  gonna get some stabbings and some killings my final point is this I've
[2:40:47.640 --> 2:40:51.880]  really been researching Mexico in depth for more than 15 years reading what
[2:40:51.880 --> 2:40:57.280]  anthropologists sociologists say from Mexico and the United States and just
[2:40:57.280 --> 2:41:01.440]  over the weekend I talked to a lot of my Hispanic friends some of which actually
[2:41:01.440 --> 2:41:06.160]  grew up in Mexico and they said Alex we know that the big foundations are
[2:41:06.160 --> 2:41:10.240]  teaching that the United States belongs to Mexico to create division we
[2:41:10.240 --> 2:41:14.360]  understand what's going on and they said immigrants like these 72 that were
[2:41:14.360 --> 2:41:19.120]  just murdered right up at the Texas border in Mexico come up from Latin
[2:41:19.120 --> 2:41:23.880]  America and are held by Los Zetas and the Mexican mafia and men women and
[2:41:23.880 --> 2:41:29.600]  children are gutted and killed and in many cases raped first as part of an
[2:41:29.600 --> 2:41:35.720]  act of terror against these people and the rich Mexicans in the United States
[2:41:35.720 --> 2:41:41.480]  they're just like poverty pimps just like Obama using racial politics to
[2:41:41.480 --> 2:41:47.520]  exploit and to basically fire up Hispanics to kind of buy into this whole
[2:41:47.520 --> 2:41:55.480]  narco terrorist el jefe worldview and that it is really a lot of Hispanic
[2:41:55.480 --> 2:42:00.320]  Americans who are feeding and using the immigrant community and that's why
[2:42:00.320 --> 2:42:05.240]  they're teamed up with the big fortune 100 companies who also want cheap labor
[2:42:05.240 --> 2:42:09.840]  and to allow Mexico to export its revolution to the United States and so
[2:42:09.840 --> 2:42:16.000]  it's just sickening elitism the same way Mexico has used anti-Americanism as a
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:20.480]  distraction from its own internal problems for the last hundred years
[2:42:20.480 --> 2:42:24.440]  this is now just an exporting of that to the United States and I've seen in the
[2:42:24.440 --> 2:42:28.960]  news countless cases of mayors and others who are Hispanic who it turns
[2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:34.000]  out are coyotes who have Hispanic immigrants as slaves they bring them
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:38.120]  over here they hold their families in Mexico they make them do drug runs for
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:42.480]  them over and over again and so really we have to realize that especially
[2:42:42.480 --> 2:42:46.800]  central and South American immigrants coming up through Mexico are completely
[2:42:46.800 --> 2:42:53.280]  abused and are being used by the corrupt el jefe types that run Mexico and now
[2:42:53.280 --> 2:42:57.160]  much of the Southwest and I guess that you know that's who he's rich and
[2:42:57.160 --> 2:43:00.320]  powerful he's made hundreds of millions of dollars that's who he hangs out with
[2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:04.760]  is the Carlos Slim types that dominate Mexico and it looks like Robert
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:08.800]  Rodriguez is really a cold-blooded guy exploiting a lot of people and creating
[2:43:08.800 --> 2:43:14.240]  a racial division in the process but we'll see what film he releases but you
[2:43:14.240 --> 2:43:19.880]  know this isn't a joke Mexico has fully collapsed every week mayors are taken
[2:43:19.880 --> 2:43:23.840]  in front of their families and murdered in some cases they're raped first as an
[2:43:23.840 --> 2:43:27.320]  act of dominance immigrants by the hundreds every week are tortured and
[2:43:27.320 --> 2:43:32.360]  murdered and have money extorted out of them and you never hear lo raza or
[2:43:32.360 --> 2:43:37.560]  matcha or all these big race groups talking about that they want to
[2:43:37.560 --> 2:43:41.400]  distract Hispanics with boogie men of the minute men who've never killed any
[2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:46.160]  immigrants but but in this movie do you know they'll give them that myth of
[2:43:46.160 --> 2:43:49.760]  who's killing them when really who's killing them is the CIA funded Los
[2:43:49.760 --> 2:43:54.120]  Zetas and the Mexican Mafia and the rest of them that are killing US embassy
[2:43:54.120 --> 2:43:58.760]  staff kidnapping citizens our police are being paid off by them rolling over and
[2:43:58.760 --> 2:44:03.000]  Robert Rodriguez just gets to glorify it and be the big king up there and and
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  you know create all this racial division and have movie posters put up in
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:10.400]  Puerto Rico and everywhere else you know saying everybody get with machete
[2:44:10.400 --> 2:44:14.880]  with a symbol of Latin American Revolution dripping with blood and
[2:44:14.880 --> 2:44:18.560]  meanwhile the big banks are funding the whole thing because after the US falls
[2:44:18.560 --> 2:44:22.800]  will all be like Mexico or Guatemala nowhere to run and that's just their
[2:44:22.800 --> 2:44:26.200]  plan where we're all killing each other I don't know if Rodriguez has played
[2:44:26.200 --> 2:44:30.000]  into this I often is being used or whether he's a really a cold-blooded
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:35.400]  person but I've seen a lot of doublespeak out of him and his crew and I just
[2:44:35.400 --> 2:44:38.560]  hope that they have thought about what they're releasing I mean I know
[2:44:38.560 --> 2:44:42.920]  supposedly in the script that machetes fled to the US because a drug cartels
[2:44:42.920 --> 2:44:48.680]  come after him but but but then he finds the ultimate evil is the gringos the
[2:44:48.680 --> 2:44:53.600]  good news is Hispanics worldwide are sophisticated and intelligent and they
[2:44:53.600 --> 2:44:57.440]  have discovered that the major foundations are funding all of this to
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:01.080]  create division and we're going to stand together against the big central banks
[2:45:01.080 --> 2:45:05.280]  against the drug traffickers against this entire global crime syndicate that's
[2:45:05.280 --> 2:45:10.280]  getting rich off of the blood sweat and tears of immigrants and other people and
[2:45:10.280 --> 2:45:15.360]  we're going to decriminalize drugs and take away your main funding mechanism
[2:45:15.360 --> 2:45:20.720]  that has empowered this criminal takeover of society Rodriguez you decided to go
[2:45:20.720 --> 2:45:25.720]  forward with this Mexican exploitation film with a radical revolutionary edge
[2:45:25.720 --> 2:45:29.080]  and when people freaked out about it you pulled it back and denied it even
[2:45:29.080 --> 2:45:33.160]  existed but now we know you've got posters going up all over Latin America
[2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:38.320]  with bloodstained hands with a bloody knife and let's just hope that what
[2:45:38.320 --> 2:45:42.160]  you're invoking whether consciously or unconsciously doesn't come true because
[2:45:42.160 --> 2:45:47.040]  you will have literal blood on your hands and you will be liable but maybe
[2:45:47.040 --> 2:45:54.720]  that's the top of famer looking for to learn more about this and other vital

[2:48:22.720 --> 2:48:25.960]  food and water with stuff and slow killing us because your control freak
[2:48:25.960 --> 2:48:30.080]  demons from hell now here's the proof of what you're doing get it out to
[2:48:30.080 --> 2:48:40.600]  everybody stop the murderers here it is save lives my friends we've got a
[2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:45.880]  chance this year to save a lot of lives the good news is we went public last
[2:48:45.880 --> 2:48:50.200]  year with millions of other truth tellers and pointed out that the vaccine
[2:48:50.200 --> 2:48:54.760]  insert for the h1n1 flu shot admitted that it could cause neurological
[2:48:54.760 --> 2:49:00.520]  disorders gion berets you name it and people actually went out and read the
[2:49:00.520 --> 2:49:05.840]  vaccine insert instead of believing the corporate media paid off by big pharma to
[2:49:05.840 --> 2:49:11.360]  lie to you since then the head of the EU Commission Wolfgang Wudarg medical
[2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:15.560]  doctor has come out and said that they found all the evidence showing that
[2:49:15.560 --> 2:49:20.280]  vaccine makers had paid off politicians in Europe in the United States to hype
[2:49:20.280 --> 2:49:26.000]  this dangerous vaccine and that it had serious health ramifications the British
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:29.560]  Medical Journal has come out with a major report I've interviewed the editor of
[2:49:29.560 --> 2:49:36.400]  the journal saying yes you know clearly this was hyped to sell vaccines since
[2:49:36.400 --> 2:49:40.600]  then the British government has had to suspend giving the h1n1 shot to under
[2:49:40.600 --> 2:49:45.400]  five-year-olds admitting that it caused a tenfold increase in violent
[2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:51.160]  convulsions in children the government of Finland has come out and said it's
[2:49:51.160 --> 2:49:56.240]  causing all sorts of neurological disorders like narcolepsy all over the
[2:49:56.240 --> 2:50:01.800]  world people are waking up also last year we saw a record low numbers of
[2:50:01.800 --> 2:50:06.640]  people taking the regular seasonal shot and the h1n1 so now they're combining
[2:50:06.640 --> 2:50:10.960]  both the shots together and because we had record low numbers of people taking
[2:50:10.960 --> 2:50:15.760]  the vaccines worldwide we had a record low flu season because the real study
[2:50:15.760 --> 2:50:20.800]  show that it's the flu vaccine in most cases that's causing the flu you've
[2:50:20.800 --> 2:50:23.880]  seen the anecdotal evidence that your friends and family or yourself saying
[2:50:23.880 --> 2:50:28.840]  yeah I never got the flu tell took the flu shot it almost killed me same thing
[2:50:28.840 --> 2:50:32.640]  happened to my mother ladies and gentlemen we have the United Nations
[2:50:32.640 --> 2:50:36.240]  documents we have the Rockefeller Foundation documents from the 60s 70s
[2:50:36.240 --> 2:50:43.080]  80s 90s and right through admitting they developed vaccines for flu or tetanus
[2:50:43.080 --> 2:50:47.640]  where they add chemicals and hormones that reduce your fertility or sterilize
[2:50:47.640 --> 2:50:52.000]  you they admit they're doing this so it's not that there couldn't be a clean
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:57.360]  safe vaccine developed I'm not arguing about that science the point is they've
[2:50:57.360 --> 2:51:02.160]  been caught spiking vaccines all over the world as part of these United Nations
[2:51:02.160 --> 2:51:06.720]  World Health Organization programs for covert sterilization and we even have
[2:51:06.720 --> 2:51:12.040]  the Rockefeller Foundation documents this is even mainstream news now but on
[2:51:12.040 --> 2:51:17.160]  top of all of that 90 plus percent of the vaccines that we're using here in the
[2:51:17.160 --> 2:51:21.680]  United States and Europe are made in China China was a signatory to the one
[2:51:21.680 --> 2:51:25.840]  child policy they were a signatory to the United Nations agreements to use
[2:51:25.840 --> 2:51:30.160]  food and medicine as weapons to forcibly reduce their population they're the
[2:51:30.160 --> 2:51:35.600]  folks that give you melamine tainted milk and bisphenol a coated plastics I
[2:51:35.600 --> 2:51:40.280]  mean this is a nightmare situation so the globalists have contracted with these
[2:51:40.280 --> 2:51:45.200]  dehumanizing tyrants to produce not just our vaccines but most of our medicines
[2:51:45.200 --> 2:51:50.200]  this is so horrifying and I know it's hard for people to be able to admit this
[2:51:50.200 --> 2:51:53.880]  to themselves but if you'll just go research the facts it's all there and
[2:51:53.880 --> 2:51:58.000]  the good news is record numbers of people are refusing to take the vaccines
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:02.280]  and record numbers of people are reading the literature and finding out how
[2:52:02.280 --> 2:52:06.680]  deadly this is and government after government after government from England
[2:52:06.680 --> 2:52:13.240]  to Australia from Finland to India is having to totally suspend or restrict
[2:52:13.240 --> 2:52:18.640]  giving these shots because people now understand how dangerous it is because
[2:52:18.640 --> 2:52:23.680]  there's such a wide swath of death and destruction in its wake we're starting to
[2:52:23.680 --> 2:52:28.200]  win we're starting to have an effect and that's why the Bill and Melinda Gates
[2:52:28.200 --> 2:52:31.720]  Foundation has given money to Monsanto and others to come up with
[2:52:31.720 --> 2:52:37.080]  pharmacological crops that grow the vaccines inside of the food so there's
[2:52:37.080 --> 2:52:40.960]  no way for you to escape it that's why Bill Gates is looking at releasing
[2:52:40.960 --> 2:52:45.800]  genetically engineered mosquitoes to quote inoculate you there's new drug
[2:52:45.800 --> 2:52:50.000]  discovery going on our foundation is back to vaccine that's going into phase
[2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:54.680]  three trial that starts in a couple months literally releasing bugs that
[2:52:54.680 --> 2:52:59.680]  come out and inject you with these things they're not playing games they
[2:52:59.680 --> 2:53:04.760]  want to force you to go under this eugenics system every time the global
[2:53:04.760 --> 2:53:08.720]  elite meet and they set up these philanthropic organizations all they
[2:53:08.720 --> 2:53:14.040]  talk about is population control this is what they're obsessed with they don't
[2:53:14.040 --> 2:53:18.080]  like going to the Grand Canyon and seeing big crowds they want all the science
[2:53:18.080 --> 2:53:23.280]  and technology for themselves not for the general population it's the ultimate
[2:53:23.280 --> 2:53:29.240]  form of greed and envy and control it's a scorched earth policy of total
[2:53:29.240 --> 2:53:35.560]  monopoly over humanity you are being slowly killed cancers are off the charts
[2:53:35.560 --> 2:53:40.280]  every other forms generative diseases off the charts and they know that the
[2:53:40.280 --> 2:53:44.880]  vaccines the sodium fluoride the bisphenol a and all of these chemicals are
[2:53:44.880 --> 2:53:50.840]  doing it and we have their own documents admitting it so in closing warn
[2:53:50.840 --> 2:53:57.840]  everyone you know send them the vaccine inserts they're online where it says it
[2:53:57.840 --> 2:54:02.360]  can cause cancer where it says it can cause neurological disorders where it
[2:54:02.360 --> 2:54:06.520]  admits that it's even caused deaths send them all the mainstream news articles
[2:54:06.520 --> 2:54:09.880]  that we're gonna link below where major governments are having to suspend the
[2:54:09.880 --> 2:54:14.280]  shots because it's causing so much carnage and warn them that the regular
[2:54:14.280 --> 2:54:19.320]  seasonal flu shots this year are going to have this h1n1 and whatever else
[2:54:19.320 --> 2:54:25.240]  they're adding to it warn everyone you know this is incredibly serious bear
[2:54:25.240 --> 2:54:30.200]  pharmaceutical admitted in court that for over a decade they knowingly sent
[2:54:30.200 --> 2:54:34.800]  out factor 8 blood product to hemophiliacs knowing it was a death
[2:54:34.800 --> 2:54:39.760]  sentence of hepatitis and HIV they did it cold bloodedly as part of a eugenics
[2:54:39.760 --> 2:54:46.600]  program the crimes of big pharma are legion and they need to be prosecuted
[2:54:46.600 --> 2:54:49.960]  they need to be brought to justice but there's a revolving door between big
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:54.760]  pharma GMO and the government almost every major federal regulator not just
[2:54:54.760 --> 2:54:59.680]  here but in every other major country is a former alumni of these companies who
[2:54:59.680 --> 2:55:02.480]  own stock and then they leave the government and go back into those
[2:55:02.480 --> 2:55:07.160]  companies and move up that ladder of power for selling out their fellow
[2:55:07.160 --> 2:55:12.640]  humans this is part of the eugenics agenda and when you see car washes
[2:55:12.640 --> 2:55:18.440]  getting IRS visits over four cents of unpaid money you understand that the
[2:55:18.440 --> 2:55:24.200]  system has its investigators going after petty stuff like Roger Clemens so
[2:55:24.200 --> 2:55:29.760]  what if he reportedly did steroids he supposedly lied to Congress that's not
[2:55:29.760 --> 2:55:35.160]  good using steroids isn't good but compared to the former Treasury
[2:55:35.160 --> 2:55:39.640]  lying to Congress about where the bailout money went then later admitting it
[2:55:39.640 --> 2:55:43.720]  didn't go to the mortgages that's trillions of dollars of taxpayer money
[2:55:43.720 --> 2:55:48.720]  what about the millions of brain damaged kids from all these vaccines why are
[2:55:48.720 --> 2:55:54.280]  we hearing about Roger Clemens why are we hearing about four cents of unpaid
[2:55:54.280 --> 2:55:59.000]  taxes at a car wash why are there investigators involved in this because
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:03.760]  it's ways to spend all the investigators resources on petty things that get the
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:07.480]  government's name in the papers to make it look like they're tracking down crime
[2:56:07.480 --> 2:56:12.760]  when they are the main source and progenitor of the crime expose the
[2:56:12.760 --> 2:56:19.320]  vaccines to learn more about this and other vital topics visit info wars.com

[2:56:44.040 --> 2:56:49.040]  public is noticing the death and disease caused by the vaccines and is waking up
[2:56:49.040 --> 2:56:53.640]  so the system's trying to make a mandatory now. Paul Watson and Kurt
[2:56:53.640 --> 2:56:58.560]  Nemo we were able because it's not on the archive it's it's it's it's not on the
[2:56:58.560 --> 2:57:03.920]  way back machine we were able to save this nutballs website this guy that
[2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:07.560]  supposedly took over the Discovery Channel facility they're panicking
[2:57:07.560 --> 2:57:11.800]  because their global warming hoax has been fully exposed as a complete fraud
[2:57:11.800 --> 2:57:18.480]  to carry out eugenics so he's reportedly taken hostages with a bomb and a gun and
[2:57:18.480 --> 2:57:25.960]  his manifesto is going up on info wars.com and prison planet.com right now
[2:57:25.960 --> 2:57:29.760]  we're getting all his writings thank God we saved them right before it went down
[2:57:29.760 --> 2:57:34.360]  it's all going up on info wars.com and prison planet.com if you want to see
[2:57:34.360 --> 2:57:37.880]  this stuff it's going up right now Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson are putting it up
[2:57:37.880 --> 2:57:42.480]  look at his manifesto number seven develop shows that mentioned the
[2:57:42.480 --> 2:57:46.800]  Malthusian sciences about how food production leads to the overpopulation
[2:57:46.800 --> 2:57:51.040]  of the human race talk about evolution talk about Malthus and Darwin until it
[2:57:51.040 --> 2:57:54.880]  sinks into the people's brains until they get it and he goes on to talk about
[2:57:54.880 --> 2:58:02.200]  babies being a little degenerate parasites that must be dealt with I mean
[2:58:02.200 --> 2:58:07.480]  this is it so they are so angry and sure humans do cause some problems but we're
[2:58:07.480 --> 2:58:10.960]  also the people that brought you Beethoven and the Bible and and and and
[2:58:10.960 --> 2:58:17.560]  rockets and and nanotech we need to have a debate about this stuff not let the
[2:58:17.560 --> 2:58:21.840]  elites in here and coldly quietly start reducing our numbers while they are
[2:58:21.840 --> 2:58:25.800]  releasing genetically engineered crops other things that truly endanger the
[2:58:25.800 --> 2:58:29.880]  entire planet you know the global leader using DU all this other stuff that's not
[2:58:29.880 --> 2:58:32.920]  a problem of the environmentalist they just want to kill people because their
[2:58:32.920 --> 2:58:37.920]  control freaks we'll have it all posted at info wars.com and prison planet.com
[2:58:37.920 --> 2:58:53.360]  right now get it out to everybody expose these criminals
