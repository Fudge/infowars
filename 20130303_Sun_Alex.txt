[00:29.180 --> 00:35.560]  chance just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take
[00:35.560 --> 00:41.960]  our lives but they'll never take our freedom
[00:41.960 --> 00:50.680]  rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex Jones
[00:50.680 --> 01:00.160]  ladies and gentlemen it is Sunday the third day of March 2013 I am your host
[01:00.160 --> 01:04.120]  Alex Jones I want to thank you all for tuning in on this Sunday worldwide
[01:04.120 --> 01:10.600]  transmission coming up today we've got the encore presentation for you with
[01:10.600 --> 01:15.520]  some key information but we're also gonna have some new info today as well
[01:15.520 --> 01:19.880]  but coming up right after the break my interview with Congressman Ron Paul
[01:19.880 --> 01:23.840]  earlier in the week it's so important we're gonna re-air that on this Sunday
[01:23.840 --> 01:29.560]  broadcast and then we've got the Michael Savage interview and whether you love
[01:29.560 --> 01:32.160]  Michael Savage or hate Michael Savage he's definitely interesting and
[01:32.160 --> 01:35.800]  informative makes a lot of good points and the fact that we can get the second
[01:35.800 --> 01:38.640]  biggest to third biggest depending on who you look at it might be George
[01:38.640 --> 01:41.720]  Norie might be Michael Savage but he's right about most groups of the second
[01:41.720 --> 01:45.960]  biggest radio talk show host in the United States that we could get Michael
[01:45.960 --> 01:50.560]  Savage on and you know communicate with him and and and and hopefully wake him
[01:50.560 --> 01:55.880]  up to some of the things he's not aware of and also get his audience more awake
[01:55.880 --> 02:00.560]  and to tune into what we're doing that is a win-win-win-win-win and then we've
[02:00.560 --> 02:05.400]  got some big excerpts of not last Sunday when he called in live but from the
[02:05.400 --> 02:10.640]  Thursday broadcast with the one the only Ted Nugent so please call your friends
[02:10.640 --> 02:13.360]  and family and tell him to tune into this Sunday broadcast remember the
[02:13.360 --> 02:18.080]  system doesn't want you to be aware of this information that's why they
[02:18.080 --> 02:21.680]  stonewall you and say there are no drones when the drone program is even
[02:21.680 --> 02:26.600]  admitted that's why they engage in all these activities Watson did an article
[02:26.600 --> 02:29.480]  about Sarah Palin you know talking about two billion rounds of ammo they're
[02:29.480 --> 02:34.640]  admitted in the federal government's own purchase orders and online in in in
[02:34.640 --> 02:39.960]  public filings and a bunch of publications so-called liberal
[02:39.960 --> 02:45.360]  publications authoritarian publications came out and said that she was insane
[02:45.360 --> 02:49.640]  that it was just totally made up and an internet rumor giving no proof I mean
[02:49.640 --> 02:54.840]  just a new level of propagandizing the public like there's some foreign
[02:54.840 --> 02:58.880]  occupying army which they are the foreign occupying army of the globalist
[02:58.880 --> 03:03.880]  so pretty incredible those articles are up in info wars calm and prison planet
[03:03.880 --> 03:08.120]  calm and also a story from Thursday that I want to talk more about is breaking
[03:08.120 --> 03:12.320]  Texas moves to forcibly inoculate children that's what it is
[03:12.320 --> 03:17.880]  SB 63 and there's another draconian bill that we'll get to in a moment in fact
[03:17.880 --> 03:20.440]  I'll cover it at the first little five-minute segment of the second hour
[03:20.440 --> 03:24.880]  I'm gonna get back into this exclusively they come out and are saying you know
[03:24.880 --> 03:27.880]  just like California we're gonna have your ten-year-old just give us consent
[03:27.880 --> 03:32.000]  to give them any shots or basically drugs we want but this is inoculations
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.440]  ladies and gentlemen a child can't walk in and buy a car a child isn't allowed
[03:36.440 --> 03:39.040]  to have sex with some pervert and the pervert can't say well they gave
[03:39.040 --> 03:44.240]  consent now this is absolutely incredible so breaking Texas moves to
[03:44.240 --> 03:50.840]  forcibly inoculate children the bill is SB 63 has a good chance of passing got
[03:50.840 --> 03:54.320]  big vaccine money behind it remember governor Perry lied and said it was the
[03:54.320 --> 03:58.280]  law to take Gardasil well now they're actually trying to make it the law where
[03:58.280 --> 04:02.640]  they can just say to your kid wants some candy hey get in the get in the van kid
[04:02.640 --> 04:07.120]  come on I got a puppy dog now it's like hey want some candy want to be able to
[04:07.120 --> 04:11.200]  get extracurricular you know prizes we'll take these shots is what they do
[04:11.200 --> 04:16.280]  in California they say they sign the law last year so that's SB number 64 in
[04:16.280 --> 04:21.600]  Texas look in your state it's happening all over the country that's an SB 64 is

[04:31.840 --> 04:35.160]  quote mandatory now they've never been mandatory but they hoax and said they
[04:35.160 --> 04:38.400]  were now that you're finding out it's not mandatory they're going okay we'll
[04:38.400 --> 04:41.920]  pass a law to make it mandatory first it's the nurses then it's the medical
[04:41.920 --> 04:45.080]  workers then it's the people that carry the trash out at the medical facility
[04:45.080 --> 04:49.400]  and then it's everybody in child health care and then it's everybody period all

[06:01.120 --> 06:09.080]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones former
[06:09.080 --> 06:14.560]  congressman Ron Paul best-selling author joins us I wanted to get him on because
[06:14.560 --> 06:19.720]  he's been writing and speaking and posting articles at campaign for Liberty
[06:19.720 --> 06:24.560]  breaking down the bubble is really getting big the QE unlimited and the
[06:24.560 --> 06:29.560]  global currency crises with the very authors of the currency crises posing as
[06:29.560 --> 06:34.240]  our saviors and just last week more proposals by the g20 for a bank of the
[06:34.240 --> 06:40.200]  world SDR that's global government to back it all up Ron Paul dr. Ron Paul
[06:40.200 --> 06:45.680]  thank you for coming on sir thank you good to be with you can you give us the
[06:45.680 --> 06:49.800]  latest on your analysis on what's happening with the economy and this big
[06:49.800 --> 06:53.920]  event you've been talking about last few years how how close are we right now how
[06:53.920 --> 07:00.080]  serious is this currency war I think in many ways we're in the middle of it I
[07:00.080 --> 07:04.240]  think the evidence to the general public is still not there and there's not been
[07:04.240 --> 07:10.080]  a panic but the people in Washington and even our central bankers don't face up
[07:10.080 --> 07:15.120]  to the real truth of the matter net is we're totally bankrupt and yet just
[07:15.120 --> 07:20.200]  putting more money and running up more debt seems to settle the markets they
[07:20.200 --> 07:26.400]  don't dump their stocks they they don't dump their bonds but we're in the middle
[07:26.400 --> 07:32.000]  of some unwinding I think that this is so much different than anything we've
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.480]  gone through you know since World War two and especially even since 1971 with
[07:37.480 --> 07:42.160]  the breakdown of Bretton Woods but one of these days we'll wake up some
[07:42.160 --> 07:46.840]  morning and realize that the whole world has given up on the system just as we
[07:46.840 --> 07:50.720]  woke up one day and the world and especially the Soviets gave up on the
[07:50.720 --> 07:54.960]  Soviet Union because the system we have the monetary system we have in the
[07:54.960 --> 08:00.080]  economic system is not viable it can't work and you can't solve the problem of
[08:00.080 --> 08:04.880]  debt with more debt and when that particular day comes I don't think
[08:04.880 --> 08:08.480]  anybody knows the exact day but we're certainly getting very close to it
[08:08.480 --> 08:12.600]  congressman getting into specifics and your research there with the Von Mies
[08:12.600 --> 08:16.820]  Institute pretty much everything you predicted in the last 30 years is now
[08:16.820 --> 08:20.960]  unfolding from all my research and even with the establishment saying and the
[08:20.960 --> 08:25.560]  way they're behaving it's all coming to a head now it's two billion rounds of
[08:25.560 --> 08:29.640]  bullets and hollow points that are illegal under the Geneva Convention we've
[08:29.640 --> 08:33.600]  got a new report out where Homeland Security is funding domestic drones and
[08:33.600 --> 08:38.160]  I'm not making this up to quote track gun purchases that just broke at
[08:38.160 --> 08:43.520]  infowars.com now we see military drills expanding everywhere we see the new
[08:43.520 --> 08:48.520]  Justice Department memo saying hey let's just ban guns and confiscate them it's
[08:48.520 --> 08:52.560]  like I've woken up in an Orwellian nightmare and we've got this this
[08:52.560 --> 08:58.000]  normalcy bias this mass Stockholm syndrome where even mainline
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.440]  conservatives I had Ted Nugent on yesterday you know he said look the
[09:01.440 --> 09:04.840]  green lights been given on Benghazi the green lights been given on all this
[09:04.840 --> 09:08.920]  other tyranny Fast and Furious nobody got in trouble and so I think we've
[09:08.920 --> 09:13.200]  reached that point where the tyrants figure out that if they can take us an
[09:13.200 --> 09:18.280]  inch why not take us a million miles. I've been getting away with it but don't you
[09:18.280 --> 09:22.580]  think this has started a while back and it's just accelerating if you go if you
[09:22.580 --> 09:27.720]  go back to what happened at Waco if you go back to what happened at Ruby Ridge I
[09:27.720 --> 09:31.560]  mean if they can get away with it they do it and nobody ever got punished for
[09:31.560 --> 09:35.440]  those mistakes that were made and now nobody gets punished at all matter of
[09:35.440 --> 09:39.960]  fact the Congress goes along with it that Congress doesn't really resist and
[09:39.960 --> 09:44.120]  put restraints on the president when it comes to kill this and the use of drones
[09:44.120 --> 09:50.760]  and assassinations and the funding continues so it's it's a very dangerous
[09:50.760 --> 09:56.240]  time that we live in. Undoubtedly specifically with all the
[09:56.240 --> 10:01.200]  paramilitary buildup the the arms race going on domestically what do you think
[10:01.200 --> 10:05.000]  the feds are planning what do you think they're preparing for Dr. Paul? Well I
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.280]  think they prepare for everything and they themselves you know go with the
[10:10.280 --> 10:15.960]  flow they don't know exactly what will happen but they're prepared they don't
[10:15.960 --> 10:19.400]  know that in two months from now there's riots in the street but they know that
[10:19.400 --> 10:26.400]  there could be in the same way with the monetary system they argue academically
[10:26.400 --> 10:30.140]  that oh yes it's okay to print money and debt doesn't matter you know the Paul
[10:30.140 --> 10:34.840]  Krugman argument but I think they know exactly what can happen the consequence
[10:34.840 --> 10:39.440]  that we warn about and try to prepare for so they make their preparations like
[10:39.440 --> 10:42.760]  I think you mentioned in your introduction about what what they do at
[10:42.760 --> 10:48.480]  the international level under the UN and the IMF and the you know these group of
[10:48.480 --> 10:53.960]  20 and all these they do plan so we we know what would be the answer that is
[10:53.960 --> 10:59.160]  sound money and honest money and have a commodity money they want to maintain
[10:59.160 --> 11:03.880]  their power so they're laying their plans too but I don't think they know
[11:03.880 --> 11:08.740]  the day they're going to use it they plan for all contingencies because the
[11:08.740 --> 11:15.640]  action of human beings are not predictable but when certain events come
[11:15.640 --> 11:21.080]  about they're laying their plans in their network so and it's really scary
[11:21.080 --> 11:28.160]  when you think about the drone the drone thing should you know wake up everybody
[11:28.160 --> 11:32.160]  on what they can do how much surveillance how many weapons can they
[11:32.160 --> 11:37.000]  carry when when they pretend that they can target any one individual thousands
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.760]  of miles away from the United States with people who maneuver those things
[11:41.760 --> 11:45.620]  even here what can they do if they decide well we're going after this drug
[11:45.620 --> 11:50.080]  dealer we're going after this guy that owns an illegal weapon who knows what
[11:50.080 --> 11:58.340]  and we do know is in spite of their fantastic you know ability you know the
[11:58.340 --> 12:02.640]  advancement in these weapons we do know that they make a lot of mistakes there's
[12:02.640 --> 12:08.520]  a lot of collateral damage and they just write it off and so I would expect that
[12:08.520 --> 12:14.160]  the people in charge know that there's trouble ahead and they're laying their
[12:14.160 --> 12:18.840]  plans sure to react in any way they need think necessary undoubtedly and I want
[12:18.840 --> 12:23.040]  you to break this down in your own words but you've spoken to it before but I
[12:23.040 --> 12:26.560]  marvel we've had big government we've had tyrannies before around the world
[12:26.560 --> 12:32.360]  but the the socialist collectivist clash funded by the big special interest that
[12:32.360 --> 12:37.080]  won a monopoly obviously of power to write health care of course you know
[12:37.080 --> 12:42.360]  about this being a retired medical doctor but my dad's a dentist oral
[12:42.360 --> 12:46.120]  surgeon he's also in medical management and he said to me said son I knew it
[12:46.120 --> 12:51.360]  when I read the bill but he's watching it happen making people erasing payroll
[12:51.360 --> 12:57.800]  taxes on poor people taxes on investments doubling premiums this year
[12:57.800 --> 13:01.560]  I mean this is designed to kill the American economy that's competing with
[13:01.560 --> 13:06.160]  China Obama shutting down the power plants that they are clearly trying to
[13:06.160 --> 13:10.320]  shut down the economy so that everybody goes on welfare and and basically
[13:10.320 --> 13:13.920]  bankrupts this is an economic takeover can you do you agree with that or can
[13:13.920 --> 13:21.680]  you speak to that I don't know if I have an absolute insight on all the
[13:21.680 --> 13:26.720]  motivations because there's a mixture up there I mean there are evil people who
[13:26.720 --> 13:29.960]  have evil motives and they want to do exactly what's happening there are
[13:29.960 --> 13:34.240]  others though who are intellectually totally bankrupt and actually believe
[13:34.240 --> 13:39.600]  this stuff you know I think Paul Krugman doesn't sit down and conspire to blow up
[13:39.600 --> 13:44.520]  the world and financially I think he sits down and he is dedicated to
[13:44.520 --> 13:49.600]  proving his philosophy on money and credit are the correct ones and then
[13:49.600 --> 13:52.680]  there's a lot of other people who are very gullible out there you know how
[13:52.680 --> 13:57.360]  many people did Obama lose the election oh I mean sure but I mean Obama said he
[13:57.360 --> 14:02.200]  was gonna give poor people free stuff he's literally raping them so there's
[14:02.200 --> 14:06.920]  the people are naive enough to believe that so you put all that together and
[14:06.920 --> 14:12.520]  you end up with this calamity because they do not deal with the world as we
[14:12.520 --> 14:16.360]  would like to deal with it and that is concentrating on the individuals who
[14:16.360 --> 14:19.400]  have a right to their own life have a right to the keep the fruits of their
[14:19.400 --> 14:24.720]  labor have property rights and contract rights and sound money and get the
[14:24.720 --> 14:28.600]  government out of our way so they don't work on that they work on the opposite
[14:28.600 --> 14:33.480]  but sure but dr. Paul here's my question trying to figure out exactly their
[14:33.480 --> 14:37.520]  scheme and their plan and who did what when has to be counteracted by us
[14:37.520 --> 14:42.320]  getting out in front and saying there is a better way in that way is something
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.040]  that we had a taste of in this country and we're losing it we need to wake up
[14:46.040 --> 14:50.080]  the American people that the answers the answers are there for is we just want to
[14:50.080 --> 14:54.600]  look and I think I think in many ways that is happening a lot more people are
[14:54.600 --> 14:59.920]  waking up but it's going to be a terribly tough struggle sure I want to
[14:59.920 --> 15:02.640]  get into the Second Amendment I don't know if you've seen this it broke Friday
[15:02.640 --> 15:07.360]  but you you're always on to the news I bring up summary of select firearms
[15:07.360 --> 15:11.880]  violence prevention strategies for the White House by the Department of Justice
[15:11.880 --> 15:16.440]  actually says basically just outlaw almost all guns and make people turn
[15:16.440 --> 15:21.140]  them in if they try to take the guns congressman are they trying to start a
[15:21.140 --> 15:24.640]  civil war you know that's once again is trying to interpret everything that
[15:24.640 --> 15:28.560]  they're thinking in their planning they're liable to start a civil war by
[15:28.560 --> 15:33.120]  doing it and for whatever reason they are but they don't believe that people
[15:33.120 --> 15:35.560]  should have gone they believe the government should have guns and they
[15:35.560 --> 15:42.520]  believe this very sincerely as as a philosophy so yes they're whether they
[15:42.520 --> 15:48.000]  that exactly what they want it's hard to say but I know one thing is they don't
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.320]  want the people to have the guns but you know I don't it's one thing I I think a
[15:53.320 --> 15:57.280]  lot about these problems but I just don't think that the people are going to

[20:46.000 --> 20:50.280]  coming up with Michael Savage Obama saying again you don't do things
[20:50.280 --> 20:54.760]  alone in America that's how our system works you didn't build that a new clip
[20:54.760 --> 20:59.160]  live on CNN 25 minutes ago I was just telling Michael Savage about it during
[20:59.160 --> 21:02.600]  the break he's like you're kidding he did it again yes we're gonna be playing
[21:02.600 --> 21:06.760]  that clip but the reason I wanted to get Michael Savage on is a time for war
[21:06.760 --> 21:12.360]  Michael Savage many number one New York Times bestsellers 30-something books
[21:12.360 --> 21:16.160]  multiple doctorates I'm not gonna go over his whole bio most of you know who
[21:16.160 --> 21:20.480]  he is in the talk radio world or you're hiding under a rock somewhere but he
[21:20.480 --> 21:24.240]  also writes for World Net Daily they are censoring this and you know this is a
[21:24.240 --> 21:30.000]  big subject I've talked about you noticed that red dawn was held up red
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.920]  dawn 2 for two years as the Chinese government demanded and threatened
[21:33.920 --> 21:38.480]  Hollywood because it was Chinese as the bad guys attacking America that was
[21:38.480 --> 21:43.040]  re-edited and made to North Koreans costing a millions of dollars to reshoot
[21:43.040 --> 21:48.240]  and re-edit now Michael Savage breaking WorldNetDaily.com China lobby
[21:48.240 --> 21:54.720]  censoring new book and we'll get this story linked up at Infowars.com as well
[21:54.720 --> 22:01.160]  and this is not a ploy to sell books Michael Savage arguably the number two
[22:01.160 --> 22:04.720]  number one talk show host in the country doesn't usually do this because I
[22:04.720 --> 22:09.360]  listen to the show and followed it to sell books this is in a news blackout
[22:09.360 --> 22:13.920]  because across the board China owns our fraudulent debt China has thousands of
[22:13.920 --> 22:17.640]  front companies Al Gore's on the board of Apple with Fox com and the suicide
[22:17.640 --> 22:22.140]  nets they are the liberal tyrants and they are the new globalist muscle
[22:22.140 --> 22:26.920]  Michael Savage joins us with this breaking news and Michael it is so
[22:26.920 --> 22:32.320]  exciting to get you on the broadcast well it's always good to be honest
[22:32.320 --> 22:37.240]  especially someone who kicked the limeys behind on air as you as you well know
[22:37.240 --> 22:42.360]  you know what I think of of the the spineless side of the Brits I always
[22:42.360 --> 22:47.160]  admire was always an Anglo file until this thing came along where this slime
[22:47.160 --> 22:51.820]  the socialist slime slanted me and said I said things I didn't say and I'm the
[22:51.820 --> 22:56.120]  only American broadcaster Alex not allowed to enter Britain I'm on a list
[22:56.120 --> 23:02.120]  with murderers and terrorists and nobody in the media with the exception of Alex
[23:02.120 --> 23:05.440]  Jones right now dares even talk about how is that possible
[23:05.440 --> 23:10.240]  why is my State Department not lobbying on my behalf but let's not go into the
[23:10.240 --> 23:14.040]  England thing it's great to be on your show it's great to have you here as long
[23:14.040 --> 23:17.800]  as we can keep you know you got your own show coming up tonight let's first plug
[23:17.800 --> 23:23.360]  that because you now are on cumulus and exploding across the country well that's
[23:23.360 --> 23:26.480]  pretty good number one they're the best company in the business and I'm not just
[23:26.480 --> 23:29.160]  saying it because I work with them they are the best company in the business
[23:29.160 --> 23:33.400]  number one number two I'm on the best stations in the country for example Alex
[23:33.400 --> 23:38.520]  I finally got on in New York City on W ABC nine o'clock at night now what
[23:38.520 --> 23:43.040]  happened Michael Savage who's he I exploded within two months to number one
[23:43.040 --> 23:47.440]  amongst younger listeners mainly males I mean women as you well know are not a
[23:47.440 --> 23:51.040]  big listenership in talk radio in general I always joke I say have eight
[23:51.040 --> 23:54.520]  listeners eight women listeners across the country they're busy not having kids
[23:54.520 --> 23:58.080]  as the whole West dies well the men listen but here's the question Alex
[23:58.080 --> 24:02.240]  because you have a younger demo and guys mainly why are they listening to you why
[24:02.240 --> 24:06.400]  why did they find Michael Savage an older guy on W ABC I beat other talk
[24:06.400 --> 24:10.800]  stations I beat all new stations I beats because young people are looking for men
[24:10.800 --> 24:15.560]  role models in the age of crucifying John Wayne they understand they're
[24:15.560 --> 24:19.060]  having their testicles chopped off and they want to fight back and have a
[24:19.060 --> 24:23.920]  future well first they have their their testicles cut off chemically they're
[24:23.920 --> 24:27.380]  chemical eyes to destroy their masculinity right and if they survive
[24:27.380 --> 24:32.900]  the chemical castration the next thing is the educational castration if they
[24:32.900 --> 24:36.880]  survive the chemical and educational crash castration I mean what's left for
[24:36.880 --> 24:40.920]  them they don't know which way to turn in this country you know Alex last week
[24:40.920 --> 24:44.920]  I started my show by saying I saw a kung fu movie when I was out on vacation
[24:44.920 --> 24:48.480]  last week I was watching a lot of television and there was a picture of a
[24:48.480 --> 24:52.880]  kung fu Academy in China with thousands of young Chinese being taught by a
[24:52.880 --> 24:58.000]  really tough mean kung fu teacher and he's saying to them no weakness no pain
[24:58.000 --> 25:03.280]  no mercy and he says what do we learn here the Chinese scream back in Chinese
[25:03.280 --> 25:09.360]  no weakness no pain no mercy and I say look at my sad sack country we have a
[25:09.360 --> 25:13.320]  government and an educational establishment teaching our children to
[25:13.320 --> 25:18.920]  say I'm weak I'm in pain this hurts that hurts I need the government to help me
[25:18.920 --> 25:23.640]  now who wins this battle in the long run Alex that doesn't take a genius to
[25:23.640 --> 25:28.680]  figure out what's happening does it no okay so that's where we're at so now we
[25:28.680 --> 25:33.600]  know that China has lobbied very effectively in Hollywood the Hollywood
[25:33.600 --> 25:37.600]  sewer pipe as I've called it affectionately for 20 years now the
[25:37.600 --> 25:42.280]  Hollywood sewer pipe is controlled by many different factors but the number
[25:42.280 --> 25:46.280]  one factor is money since China controls the money flow to the banks and the
[25:46.280 --> 25:50.040]  banks control Hollywood we don't have to figure out who controls Hollywood do we
[25:50.040 --> 25:54.720]  so my agent said to me when I told him my book is being sabotaged from the top
[25:54.720 --> 25:59.740]  and I'll explain it in a minute my agent called me he said this and I'm
[25:59.740 --> 26:03.920]  quoting Alex this is a top New York literary agent he said from the
[26:03.920 --> 26:08.280]  government to mainstream media oh no that's him but here he said from the
[26:08.280 --> 26:12.100]  government to mainstream media there is a petrifying fear of China and the
[26:12.100 --> 26:15.640]  potential loss of their hypothetical business the agent said to savage he
[26:15.640 --> 26:18.020]  was reminded of a conversation he had with the top Hollywood executive who
[26:18.020 --> 26:22.400]  said to him they wouldn't produce any films that were anti-china for fear of
[26:22.400 --> 26:25.920]  being blackballed in their market basically letting the Chinese government
[26:25.920 --> 26:29.920]  censor our movies in this country then he said to me savage there must be a way
[26:29.920 --> 26:33.940]  to galvanize conservative media behind the time for war as the only book
[26:33.940 --> 26:38.320]  willing to take on China the agent told savage well guess what Alex aside from
[26:38.320 --> 26:45.600]  you nobody will discuss this book and its premise well let's break down what
[26:45.600 --> 26:50.240]  they're censoring here but to tie in Obama shutting down dozens of power
[26:50.240 --> 26:55.040]  plants a week they're not letting new plants open they're totally clean coal
[26:55.040 --> 26:59.080]  power plants about 51% of our power this is brand new this just happened at the
[26:59.080 --> 27:04.540]  end of the last hour Obama is in Newport Virginia at one of the shipyards talking
[27:04.540 --> 27:08.880]  about getting America going and I saw this on CNN during the break earlier I
[27:08.880 --> 27:11.920]  couldn't believe it now let's get into your book here that they're trying to
[27:11.920 --> 27:15.760]  censor the premise of the book that I'm holding in my hand a time for war with
[27:15.760 --> 27:21.840]  Michael Savage well if the premise is quite simple which is that okay it
[27:21.840 --> 27:27.960]  starts with a helicopter in Afghanistan a Chinook carrying a squad of Navy SEALs
[27:27.960 --> 27:32.680]  plummeting to the earth in Afghanistan remember when that happened in 11 when
[27:32.680 --> 27:36.760]  our great commander-in-chief was never blamed for the loss of more Navy SEALs
[27:36.760 --> 27:40.640]  in one incident than in a than in the entire history of the knee of the SEALs
[27:40.640 --> 27:44.880]  unit how come there's never been an investigation of who put all those Navy
[27:44.880 --> 27:49.280]  SEALs in a single old flying helicopter and flew them into a hot zone who did
[27:49.280 --> 27:53.200]  that who in the military made that decision or worse yet was a decision
[27:53.200 --> 27:55.960]  made by someone other than in the military why has there been no
[27:55.960 --> 28:00.120]  Republican outcry that's how my book begins but the question is what happens
[28:00.120 --> 28:05.080]  next well I fictionalized that story in order to make America wake up to the
[28:05.080 --> 28:09.800]  fact that maybe just maybe someone will ask who killed all our Navy SEALs and
[28:09.800 --> 28:15.000]  number two my allegation meaning through my fiction it's a novel a time for war
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.800]  is that there's a Chinese agent in Afghanistan who brings it down with an
[28:19.800 --> 28:25.880]  EMP attack and the whole book is basically about a lethal conspiracy to
[28:25.880 --> 28:32.000]  not only neutralize our military but also a two-pronged attack that will
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.840]  disarm the American military through EMP blasts and then release a deadly toxin
[28:36.840 --> 28:40.920]  killing hundreds of thousands of civilians and my hero Jack Hatfield and
[28:40.920 --> 28:46.520]  Dover a young lady race to locate this new ground zero and save it on suspecting
[28:46.520 --> 28:50.800]  country that's the theme of a time for war in my novel it's a novel it's a

[33:07.640 --> 33:10.920]  network network
[33:15.120 --> 33:21.160]  so Alex the question is where do I come up with the theory that I am being
[33:21.160 --> 33:25.000]  manipulated or they're doing it all over the place I mean the government's owned
[33:25.000 --> 33:30.440]  by China now the the globalists signed us on to communism and use NAFTA and
[33:30.440 --> 33:34.000]  all these rules to shut down our industry so only China could thrive
[33:34.000 --> 33:38.240]  they got their population jumping off suicide nets I mean this is how they
[33:38.240 --> 33:41.920]  brought America down yeah but let me let me answer the question people gonna say
[33:41.920 --> 33:46.360]  savage still didn't answer the fact that he's making a great charge here that the
[33:46.360 --> 33:50.080]  China Lobby is censoring his new book where is the proof right well let me
[33:50.080 --> 33:54.080]  give you one piece of evidence because I'm trained as a scientist and the only
[33:54.080 --> 33:57.760]  proof is a series of evidence evidentiary facts it's like a court of
[33:57.760 --> 34:02.080]  law right we can't definitively show you a video of Chinese agents sitting and
[34:02.080 --> 34:05.800]  talking and saying kill the book I can show you facts and let people draw the
[34:05.800 --> 34:09.160]  conclusions for themselves when this book first came out there was an ad
[34:09.160 --> 34:13.800]  campaign that was leading with is China already at war with the US okay that was
[34:13.800 --> 34:18.040]  the lead line is China already at war with the US by the time the book
[34:18.040 --> 34:23.720]  appeared that ad line was dropped and it became it became a book about terrorism
[34:23.720 --> 34:28.840]  generic okay a generic book about terrorism secondly we had an ad
[34:28.840 --> 34:32.760]  campaign planned for the day of launch which was last week on a Tuesday it was
[34:32.760 --> 34:36.200]  supposed to be on the top of some major websites that will not mention which I
[34:36.200 --> 34:40.360]  woke up early in the morning looking forward to seeing the ads they didn't
[34:40.360 --> 34:45.320]  appear I was screaming and yelling all day long finally a word came back that
[34:45.320 --> 34:50.200]  it was bumped because of this it was bumped because of that it was a mistake
[34:50.200 --> 34:53.880]  and the ads that were made meant to run was suddenly running on Sunday morning
[34:53.880 --> 34:56.960]  and in Sunday midnight they were never appearing where they were supposed to
[34:56.960 --> 35:01.560]  appear it didn't happen by accident Alex money was paid contracts were signed
[35:01.560 --> 35:06.160]  this was shafted from the top down can I prove it no but I could offer some
[35:06.160 --> 35:09.580]  evidence and the publisher is owned by a German holding company by the way
[35:09.580 --> 35:13.720]  without smearing the publisher for obvious reasons there's hardly an
[35:13.720 --> 35:17.880]  American publisher left that isn't owned by an international publisher this one
[35:17.880 --> 35:20.700]  is owned by the biggest publishing group in the world which happens to be
[35:20.700 --> 35:24.060]  headquartered in Germany we all well know that the Germans are interested in
[35:24.060 --> 35:26.440]  penetrating the Chinese market is that correct
[35:26.440 --> 35:31.240]  absolutely well I mean as the CFR has said in the New World Order everything's
[35:31.240 --> 35:35.160]  being positioned to China to leverage everybody out of the lowest common
[35:35.160 --> 35:39.640]  denominator to bring in this system well the one good news about it all is I've
[35:39.640 --> 35:43.240]  always liked Chinese food so maybe I can look forward to that but the thing is
[35:43.240 --> 35:47.080]  you know I you know that wouldn't be the bad that would be the only good news of
[35:47.080 --> 35:50.160]  the whole thing is it's not a bad cuisine if you if you don't get low low
[35:50.160 --> 35:54.720]  salt low fat Chinese food which is impossible fine in San Francisco you
[35:54.720 --> 35:58.680]  know is this sinophobia Alex because we're gonna be accused you look you're a
[35:58.680 --> 36:02.560]  renegade broadcaster I'm somewhat of a renegade broadcaster you know that we're
[36:02.560 --> 36:06.000]  sort of outcast and we love it because that's what we are we don't want to be
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.720]  one of these old men sitting on the boardwalk with our pants legs rolled up
[36:09.720 --> 36:13.640]  complaining like bill planted yesterday from CBS did you hear that sound clip
[36:13.640 --> 36:17.680]  you got to hear this one bill plant complains to his friend Howie kites of
[36:17.680 --> 36:24.600]  the major media you know Howie kites and bill plant and bill says this he says
[36:24.600 --> 36:28.520]  we've gotten used to being called whiny lap dogs I've heard it for 30 years but
[36:28.520 --> 36:32.000]  he said this is about access to the president and access to the president's
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.200]  been cut and pushed and curtailed over every administration I've covered but
[36:36.200 --> 36:39.880]  here's the nub of it Howie this administration has the tools to reach
[36:39.880 --> 36:43.840]  people on their own now they don't need us that much and to the extent that
[36:43.840 --> 36:47.320]  they're able to do that Howie they're undercutting the First Amendment which
[36:47.320 --> 36:51.080]  guarantees a free press through many voices isn't that hilarious that's right
[36:51.080 --> 36:55.840]  this these idiots sold out repeated and regurgitated what the establishment said
[36:55.840 --> 36:59.760]  and now they're being totally cut off and they're complaining yeah that a free
[36:59.760 --> 37:03.240]  press through many voices as long as they're all liberal voices certainly
[37:03.240 --> 37:06.960]  you've never been on the free press I've never been heard from by the free press
[37:06.960 --> 37:11.800]  we don't exist Alex our large audiences don't exist they're the ultimate sensors
[37:11.800 --> 37:15.960]  legends in their own mind who sit up there on a mountain telling us what
[37:15.960 --> 37:20.000]  exists and doesn't exist did you see Gibbs regardless where you stand on the
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.440]  drone program saying he was told to say the program didn't exist like the Wizard
[37:24.440 --> 37:29.680]  of Oz even when the program was public did you see that yeah I'm not a big fan
[37:29.680 --> 37:33.680]  of Gibbs I happen to like drones I know you and I disagree on this I'd rather
[37:33.680 --> 37:37.960]  see a drone go and kill a real terrorist than sending an American platoon over
[37:37.960 --> 37:41.320]  there to do I know I'm talking about him being domestically used against us or
[37:41.320 --> 37:44.880]  against drones in America you know the only drone I would approve of would be a
[37:44.880 --> 37:48.600]  drone manned by a government official remember Hitler used the first drones
[37:48.600 --> 37:52.320]  they were called v1s and v2s remember the unmanned rockets that he sent on
[37:52.320 --> 37:56.720]  England what now our own government is using v1s against us absolutely and in
[37:56.720 --> 37:59.720]  fact Michael Savage here with us the crews doing a great job trying to
[37:59.720 --> 38:05.320]  capture stuff live off TV we do drumroll please have the clip of Obama at a
[38:05.320 --> 38:10.120]  shipbuilding factory in Virginia just about 30 minutes ago he said this this
[38:10.120 --> 38:17.080]  is breaking you didn't build it statement number two from CNN here it is
[38:17.360 --> 38:23.400]  but in order for us to make that happen I'm gonna need you you know the the one
[38:23.400 --> 38:28.720]  thing about being president is after four years you get pretty humble maybe
[38:28.720 --> 38:32.320]  you wouldn't but actually you become more humble you don't know you realize
[38:32.320 --> 38:37.040]  yeah you know all the mistakes you make but you also realize you can't do things
[38:37.040 --> 38:41.160]  by yourself that's not how our system works you've got to have the help and
[38:41.160 --> 38:47.440]  the goodwill of Congress and what that means is you've got to make sure that
[38:47.440 --> 38:51.840]  constituents of members of Congress are putting some pressure on so again that's
[38:51.840 --> 38:55.520]  a backhanded way he's saying oh I can't be a dictator but what he's really
[38:55.520 --> 39:00.000]  saying the factory is you can't do things by yourself well I think what
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.360]  he's saying is I need you to run to Congress and make them cave in and make
[39:03.360 --> 39:07.560]  sure I can give increases in taxes again is what he's really saying of course he
[39:07.560 --> 39:10.560]  doesn't believe anyone does anything without the government's help this is
[39:10.560 --> 39:16.280]  how statists think this is how status have been brainwashed from childhood to
[39:16.280 --> 39:21.000]  believe that for example Picasso didn't paint his painting by himself he'd argue
[39:21.000 --> 39:24.680]  that he had to go buy the paints he had to buy the paintbrush he had to buy the
[39:24.680 --> 39:29.200]  easel and he had to rent the model but other individuals contributed to make a
[39:29.200 --> 39:34.560]  better choice and more variance in society the idea of collectivism all it
[39:34.560 --> 39:38.560]  creates is nightmares but we understand that but Alex listen to how they think
[39:38.560 --> 39:42.840]  you know as well as I do how they think why do you think that in the Soviet
[39:42.840 --> 39:47.280]  Union of the past and in China today there is no individual art the art has
[39:47.280 --> 39:51.280]  to be state-approved art is that correct how different is that then state
[39:51.280 --> 39:54.280]  approved art in America today where there are very few creative artists who
[39:54.280 --> 39:57.640]  are ever seen unless they're working through the National Endowment for the
[39:57.640 --> 40:01.600]  humanities National Endowments for the Arts or they're in a university tenured
[40:01.600 --> 40:06.280]  position you don't see or hear from them because they're not state-sponsored we
[40:06.280 --> 40:11.300]  are becoming increasingly like a Soviet state we understand that Alex and we're
[40:11.300 --> 40:17.200]  fighting against it the question to you Alex is people are screaming what the
[40:17.200 --> 40:22.400]  heck can I do about it I've tried look what they gave us in the last election a
[40:22.400 --> 40:27.280]  choice between mr. miltoast and the communists the naked Marxist then the
[40:27.280 --> 40:32.200]  naked Marxist Obama floods America with illegal aliens three months before the
[40:32.200 --> 40:36.040]  election by granting amnesty through the quote dream act without congressional
[40:36.040 --> 40:40.840]  approval there wasn't a peep a peep out of the drunks called Republicans well
[40:40.840 --> 40:44.600]  Michael that was my next point is that isn't it time for impeachment it was a
[40:44.600 --> 40:50.760]  long time ago he says our military's under NATO control he goes on to say
[40:50.760 --> 40:57.200]  that he can have cybersecurity shut down a free speech if Congress doesn't act he
[40:57.200 --> 41:01.240]  says now he can legalize the illegal aliens by fiat well you and I can't go
[41:01.240 --> 41:05.220]  to Mexico and have babies for free and everything paid for they're taking
[41:05.220 --> 41:09.720]  American hospitality and using it to literally bankrupt this country and
[41:09.720 --> 41:14.320]  isn't that their goal is to bankrupt things to collectivize it I'm not sure
[41:14.320 --> 41:17.560]  that they want to bankrupt the country I think they just simply are into
[41:17.560 --> 41:21.720]  controlling it and remember Alex my analogy is different than yours there
[41:21.720 --> 41:25.200]  was a TV show called the Sopranos you probably don't watch much TV I've seen
[41:25.200 --> 41:28.640]  it yeah the monster so it's when the mobsters from New Jersey they run a
[41:28.640 --> 41:32.360]  gambling private gambling den right they get a guy and was a friend of theirs by
[41:32.360 --> 41:36.040]  the way owns a huge sporting goods store and they tell him don't gamble you're a
[41:36.040 --> 41:40.120]  sick degenerate gambler he gambles anyway he loses all of his money so the
[41:40.120 --> 41:44.080]  Mafia gets their hands into his sporting goods store right now the next scene is
[41:44.080 --> 41:47.520]  they already move into the store they get in the back room and they're taking
[41:47.520 --> 41:51.920]  stuff out of the back door they now own the guy not only they busting out the
[41:51.920 --> 41:56.040]  store by selling things in the back out of trucks now they're getting they're
[41:56.040 --> 41:59.800]  taking a line of credit Alex that the store has and they're running up
[41:59.800 --> 42:03.320]  first-class airline tickets to the tune of millions of dollars what does that
[42:03.320 --> 42:07.080]  sound like to you it sounds like we've been taken over by the same gang that
[42:07.080 --> 42:10.320]  took over the sporting goods store and they're busting us out by running up our
[42:10.320 --> 42:13.600]  credit taking our credit line I totally agree with you that's that's my
[42:13.600 --> 42:18.640]  analysis exactly it's like a gang took over America how dumb do you have to be
[42:18.640 --> 42:22.680]  not to snow it's government anarchy as you call it it is government anarchy and
[42:22.680 --> 42:26.880]  that's a phrase I was using but people don't understand what I say Alex maybe
[42:26.880 --> 42:30.960]  some do have a big audience let me bring this up why do all of the major
[42:30.960 --> 42:35.400]  conservative libertarian hosts talk crap about each other or start fights I don't
[42:35.400 --> 42:39.280]  do that and but when I'm listening to talk radio they're constantly sniping at
[42:39.280 --> 42:43.200]  you and then acting like you're sniping at them when they're starting it and
[42:43.200 --> 42:47.960]  then I've got you know mr. mr. Beck behind the scenes always trying to make
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.040]  stuff up why don't they get there's gonna be no country in the future if we
[42:52.040 --> 42:55.400]  don't Alex here's the answer when you delete sled dog the other dogs are

[47:00.840 --> 47:07.640]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting
[47:07.640 --> 47:17.240]  network network defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic it's Alex
[47:17.240 --> 47:22.280]  Jones what about Dorner yeah the whole system was paralyzed for a week over one
[47:22.280 --> 47:25.960]  guy how do they think they're gonna start a civil war by the way he was a
[47:25.960 --> 47:32.240]  pro gun guy who then I mean an anti gun guy who was then out there using guns to
[47:32.240 --> 47:37.520]  reportedly shoot police that was a crazy case and what the media did the vermin
[47:37.520 --> 47:42.040]  in the media and I'll say it until I until people hear me okay I won't use a
[47:42.040 --> 47:45.200]  word that's so charged the cilantro rates in the media the worms in the
[47:45.200 --> 47:50.640]  media the worms in the media how's that the worms in the media refused to report
[47:50.640 --> 47:56.720]  that that mad crazed cop Dorner who was killing people his first two victims
[47:56.720 --> 48:01.800]  were a couple of a young woman who was of Chinese African American descent and
[48:01.800 --> 48:06.840]  her fiancee who was African American they wouldn't show their picture Alex we
[48:06.840 --> 48:10.520]  had a search for it and put it up on Michael Savage calm why did the media
[48:10.520 --> 48:15.400]  not show that donors first victims were a black man and a Chinese black woman
[48:15.400 --> 48:18.680]  because then it wouldn't have fit their agenda they wanted to make it about
[48:18.680 --> 48:24.760]  racial division that's right this the rats the cilantro rates the worms the
[48:24.760 --> 48:29.200]  worms in the media are trying to destroy us they've destroyed this country the
[48:29.200 --> 48:33.360]  very same worms that Obama's now saying I don't need you anymore are now crying
[48:33.360 --> 48:36.280]  that he doesn't need them anymore but it's those worms never forget who
[48:36.280 --> 48:41.280]  destroyed this country so what is the endgame then if he's even raising taxes
[48:41.280 --> 48:46.360]  on the payroll of the poorest people I guess drive them into pure bankruptcy to
[48:46.360 --> 48:49.760]  get on welfare and make them totally dependent wreck the country but but
[48:49.760 --> 48:52.800]  you're saying you don't think that's the total plan well that's what they're
[48:52.800 --> 48:57.800]  doing no that's not the plan I think people think that mistakenly let's look
[48:57.800 --> 49:01.960]  at who doesn't pay taxes in America let's look at General Electric I keep
[49:01.960 --> 49:06.080]  using that as a prime example for a couple of reasons GE had reportedly an
[49:06.080 --> 49:11.000]  income of five some billion dollars u.s. income they paid zero taxes because of
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.640]  the rigged system who is the president of General Electric Jeffrey Immelt what
[49:15.640 --> 49:20.600]  else does General Electric own NBC and MSNBC why else would they take a street
[49:20.600 --> 49:28.000]  slime an uneducated dope a street slime rabble-rousing uneducated rat like Al
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.560]  Sharpton and give him a million dollars a year or more to be on MSNBC because he
[49:32.560 --> 49:37.160]  keeps the mobs the rent the mobs that are used for years away from Jeffrey
[49:37.160 --> 49:40.840]  Immelt's General Electric headquarters isn't it cheaper to pay a rat like him a
[49:40.840 --> 49:43.760]  million dollars right and then Obama made the head of GE the head of the
[49:43.760 --> 49:48.200]  Economic Council where they selectively can keep their coal power plants open
[49:48.200 --> 49:51.960]  they get a waiver but everybody else gets shut down it's classic mafia
[49:51.960 --> 49:57.240]  tactics so well Alex listen if GE paid their fair share and Google paid their
[49:57.240 --> 50:00.920]  fair share and all the other corporations who are tied into the Obama
[50:00.920 --> 50:04.160]  administration and now let's go to another one Alex that no one talks about
[50:04.160 --> 50:09.120]  why are Indian gambling casinos tax-free why don't they pay their fair share
[50:09.120 --> 50:13.720]  if you're an insider and support the mafia your tax exempt and then they say
[50:13.720 --> 50:18.520]  people making two hundred some thousand dollars a year are rich dirty rats who
[50:18.520 --> 50:23.120]  aren't paying enough federal taxes at 40% you add all the rest of it's like
[50:23.120 --> 50:28.080]  that golfer pays 65% and bitched about it and California said how dare you you
[50:28.080 --> 50:33.480]  should pay more if GE and the other tax evading corporations paid their fair
[50:33.480 --> 50:38.720]  share if Indian gambling casinos paid their fair share this budget would be
[50:38.720 --> 50:43.440]  balanced but nobody will talk about the sacred cows will they because they are
[50:43.440 --> 50:46.720]  the government in other words they're not separate from the government they
[50:46.720 --> 50:50.720]  are the government who do you think put this guy in the way how do we stop them
[50:50.720 --> 50:55.240]  how do we stop them I don't have an answer other than talking about it free
[50:55.240 --> 51:01.360]  speech has tremendous power it's the proverbial pebble in the compound Alex
[51:01.360 --> 51:05.240]  if we keep throwing these pebbles into the pond and the rivulets go out to the
[51:05.240 --> 51:11.040]  edges eventually people will wake up eventually they will act up there is no
[51:11.040 --> 51:16.200]  other answer that I have Alex I agree with you if we roll over we're in deep
[51:16.200 --> 51:19.760]  trouble and the problem is the same insider financial interest that are
[51:19.760 --> 51:25.040]  crony monopolist who want tyranny and a organized command and control economy
[51:25.040 --> 51:30.200]  they are funding both parties and now you see the mainline Republican Party
[51:30.200 --> 51:34.600]  demonizing the more hardcore tea party that are our listeners who are actually
[51:34.600 --> 51:38.800]  just Americans what do you think about the establishment Republicans claiming
[51:38.800 --> 51:43.160]  that Obama is a mandate for socialism and that Republicans should have open
[51:43.160 --> 51:48.760]  borders abortion tyranny everything else what do you say to that that attempted
[51:48.760 --> 51:53.560]  capitulation I say it's a hoax well it's either you want socialism on a fast
[51:53.560 --> 51:59.160]  track with Obama or socialism on a local train with with the Republicans they're
[51:59.160 --> 52:02.560]  no different I call them the demakins for for 20 years in radio or the
[52:02.560 --> 52:05.240]  republic rats what's the difference we have a one-party system it's an
[52:05.240 --> 52:08.760]  oligarchy we all understand that so the Republican Party is irrelevant it's
[52:08.760 --> 52:12.000]  become a totally irrelevant party there are some great people in a Ted Cruz
[52:12.000 --> 52:15.920]  happen to be a big fan of Ted Cruz will they come on the show absolutely not did
[52:15.920 --> 52:19.280]  Rubio ever want to come on my show absolutely not so they're all
[52:19.280 --> 52:22.600]  establishment types I understand that but I don't hold it against well here's
[52:22.600 --> 52:26.880]  an example of style then okay let me just throw this at you I was mad I was
[52:26.880 --> 52:31.400]  angry I was in a bad mood he was playing factoid games I blew up at Piers Morgan
[52:31.400 --> 52:35.680]  it was huge news he's scared to have me back they claimed I defeated gun owners
[52:35.680 --> 52:39.080]  but the truth is it scared them and I met with Morgan later I saw him in
[52:39.080 --> 52:41.920]  Houston and he said oh we don't want you back on we don't want to make you too
[52:41.920 --> 52:45.840]  prominent when my audience and your audience dwarfs his by a factor of you
[52:45.840 --> 52:50.600]  know 10 15 20 times but the issue is we actually I actually kicked their butt
[52:50.600 --> 52:55.800]  because I actually said get out of your coma wake up they say it's discrediting
[52:55.800 --> 52:59.520]  to get angry and aggressive the truth is that's one of the only hopes we've got
[52:59.520 --> 53:03.120]  you agree with that thousand percent get in their face they're a bunch of cowards
[53:03.120 --> 53:07.560]  every last one of them they're terrified of real men if you can spit in their
[53:07.560 --> 53:12.240]  face and tell them I said so you have no idea what contempt I have for these
[53:12.240 --> 53:17.340]  people the media is destroying America and guys like Piers Morgan are the
[53:17.340 --> 53:21.160]  epitome of everything wrong with the media the fact is Alex you did a great
[53:21.160 --> 53:25.880]  job I admire you for it and you should keep doing it I myself don't go on any
[53:25.880 --> 53:29.760]  shows I haven't for years I learned my lesson a long time ago they're snakes
[53:29.760 --> 53:33.920]  they're the lowest form of well they'll tell you it's live and then do a tape
[53:33.920 --> 53:37.600]  show while they're taping you while the show's already on but they'll tape it in
[53:37.600 --> 53:41.040]  a segment and then edit it they're incredibly deceptive and expanding on
[53:41.040 --> 53:44.560]  that I didn't bring that up to inject myself into the story for listeners I
[53:44.560 --> 53:49.320]  brought it up to say I believe and I've seen being aggressive with the truth is
[53:49.320 --> 53:53.440]  the only dog we've got in the fight look you did a great job someone's got a
[53:53.440 --> 53:56.680]  fight back if more in Congress did what you did we'd be in better shape why
[53:56.680 --> 54:00.800]  don't you run for office since I have declared it's time for war a time for
[54:00.800 --> 54:05.160]  war why don't you go to war and run for Congress I'll put it back to you why
[54:05.160 --> 54:08.240]  don't you run for Congress Michael I thought about it for many years and I'll
[54:08.240 --> 54:12.600]  give you one answer I don't have the personality for it I can't I can't mince
[54:12.600 --> 54:16.960]  words I don't have the patience to sit politely with my hands folded and say
[54:16.960 --> 54:22.360]  mm-hmm mm-hmm I don't want to do any fundraising moreover I really don't want
[54:22.360 --> 54:26.480]  to pander for votes I agree I absolutely got involved in some campaign stuff in
[54:26.480 --> 54:30.600]  the begging for money and the questionnaires and the and just all the
[54:30.600 --> 54:34.480]  weirdness and the sycophants that worship the political class totally sick
[54:34.480 --> 54:38.080]  now you've talked a lot about this the 2 billion bullets I want to specifically
[54:38.080 --> 54:43.600]  get into that the domestic drones the Homeland Security training I mean that
[54:43.600 --> 54:47.400]  has captured the public's attention that the military-industrial complex is being
[54:47.400 --> 54:51.880]  converted over as a system to control us I think that's something they're really
[54:51.880 --> 54:56.320]  scared of us covering that well it's obvious what they're doing they're
[54:56.320 --> 55:00.160]  drying up the supply of ammunition if they couldn't control the guns what
[55:00.160 --> 55:03.380]  they're doing is controlling the ammo supply that's very obvious I had an
[55:03.380 --> 55:07.160]  expert on the Michael Savage show last week who called it from WMAL in
[55:07.160 --> 55:11.200]  Washington he said he's a he's a he's a manufacturer of weapons and bullets and
[55:11.200 --> 55:15.080]  he said that's exactly what they're doing not only you don't know this Alex
[55:15.080 --> 55:19.160]  but not only did they buy all of the available ammo they've put in advance
[55:19.160 --> 55:22.440]  orders to give them priority for any ammo that's manufactured in the future
[55:22.440 --> 55:26.800]  what they've done is completely dry up the supply they're very clever don't
[55:26.800 --> 55:32.200]  ever underestimate your enemy Alex I agree if they are very clever they're
[55:32.200 --> 55:36.760]  very angry they're very frightened and that makes for very dangerous enemy so
[55:36.760 --> 55:39.800]  they can't get you on the Second Amendment so they cleverly said okay so
[55:39.800 --> 55:44.200]  we can't take the guns away from the cracker let's take the bullets away from
[55:44.200 --> 55:48.840]  the cracker that's what they're doing here Alex and that's exactly what needs
[55:48.840 --> 55:53.440]  to be exposed to the general public you said this about three years ago and
[55:53.440 --> 55:56.920]  after you said it there was a Financial Times of London article official
[55:56.920 --> 56:00.960]  Democratic Party fundraiser letter to the millionaires that said don't worry
[56:00.960 --> 56:05.520]  even he's gonna get reelected and there's gonna be big events that help
[56:05.520 --> 56:11.120]  Obama take over there's gonna be crises and we're gonna blame it on the right
[56:11.120 --> 56:14.800]  wing radio now you said that before they even came out and said it I've been
[56:14.800 --> 56:19.120]  saying that what about the false flag Reichstag event Michael Savage I see
[56:19.120 --> 56:24.120]  that as basically all the cornered rats have left stage stuff or let stuff
[56:24.120 --> 56:27.880]  happen and blame it on us well there are people who are saying that these recent
[56:27.880 --> 56:32.360]  shootings from Sandy Hook onward were staged by the government in some way I
[56:32.360 --> 56:36.200]  can't accept that as a reality I don't know how they could brainwash that
[56:36.200 --> 56:41.160]  idiot Lanza to go kill innocent school children sorry I'm sorry I'm go right
[56:41.160 --> 56:46.160]  down the list right to Donor are they all government brainwashed lunatics I
[56:46.160 --> 56:50.280]  mean I don't know if you believe that I personally don't but it's interesting to
[56:50.280 --> 56:54.480]  me as an epidemiologist that they all seem to come within a short period of
[56:54.480 --> 56:57.600]  time isn't it I mean they've all occurred in a very short period of time
[56:57.600 --> 57:01.920]  just as the gun grabbers have raised their rhetoric about taking away our
[57:01.920 --> 57:05.600]  Second Amendment rights so yeah I mean it's easy to say it's fits but is it
[57:05.600 --> 57:10.240]  true I don't know well a lot of it is they just I mean look at the Batman
[57:10.240 --> 57:14.560]  shooter in Aurora where he gets DARPA funding and is protected and the
[57:14.560 --> 57:18.800]  psychiatrist is top Air Force assigned to him I mean even the police in LA
[57:18.800 --> 57:23.120]  said Sirhan Sirhan wasn't the shooter of RFK and you know about amnesiac drugs
[57:23.120 --> 57:28.440]  dr. Savage I really don't know that side of it you're so more deep so much more
[57:28.440 --> 57:33.240]  deeply involved in this whole side of things that I am Alex I don't think we
[57:33.240 --> 57:38.400]  need to even go there to understand that the enemy of our freedoms exists it's
[57:38.400 --> 57:42.000]  real it has names regardless they're using the crisis to take our liberties
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.160]  like Rahm Emanuel said well that's right but why would they let a crisis go to
[57:46.160 --> 57:48.440]  waste
[57:50.120 --> 57:55.760]  it's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria viruses moles and fungus can

[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:27.900]  again thank you for joining us on this worldwide Sunday edition the third day
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:34.760]  of March 2013 hard to believe we're already into 2013 and the broadcast is
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:39.320]  exploding in the face of the bizarre tyranny we're seeing but that's not
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.680]  enough I don't want to just have a popular radio show folks this isn't a
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.480]  game or an act Howard Stern last week was asking me is this an act no I really
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.760]  am passionate I really am upset over secret testing on the public that's been
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.660]  declassified where this government for 80 years has killed tens of thousands of
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:02:00.400]  Americans military black white old young foster children in secret test that gets
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:05.240]  to me that upsets me that makes me want to get justice not just so the evil are
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.080]  punished but so that the good are protected let me tell you something
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:15.000]  nationwide as you just heard in that obsolete man back from the 60s socialist
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.040]  communist fascist systems say you are obsolete and we're now being told by the
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.720]  globalists were obsolete because of computers and robots and all the rest of
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.760]  this and I don't want to just punish the guilty I want to protect the innocent
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.720]  and and move forward into a better world in the future and that's what I'm
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:36.040]  talking about here today and I'm gonna be covering this more next week and I
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.000]  know Mike Adams is gonna be sitting in one day and so is Aaron Dykes I'm gonna
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.560]  take some time off with the family but I'm gonna be shooting some videos about
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.680]  this as well all over the country and all over the world they are moving with
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:48.200]  forced inoculations for decades they said it was the law and lied about it
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.080]  ran hoaxes about it now they're actually trying to pass laws where they can get
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.440]  your kid to sign a form and they can give consent well that was the case
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.440]  again children could sign contracts to buy cars children could have sex with
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:03.080]  adults children could you know go by firearms ten-year-olds could join the
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:09.600]  military you every culture doesn't give children consent this is so over the top
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:14.440]  show in the face and as the state trying to take over children they passed this
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:18.040]  last year in California it's passed in other states are trying to pass it in
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:24.240]  Texas now check your stakes it's in a bunch of them SB 64 is to make all
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:29.560]  anybody that works around children public schools YMCA toddlers take all
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.920]  these deadly vaccines that don't even protect you and actually spread the
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:35.240]  disease in many cases and now they're pushing pregnant women to take tetanus
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:39.240]  shots it's known to cause them to have miscarriages and then there's SB 63 the
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:43.440]  really big one where child may consent to the child's own immunization of the
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:47.600]  child in Part D a health care provider or facility may rely on the written
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.880]  statement of the child containing the grounds of which the child has the
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.320]  capacity consent the child's immunization under this section
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:59.360]  unbelievable I mean this is beyond outrageous but the globalist are bum
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:04.560]  rushing us on a thousand fronts with all this tyranny so we just give up and
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:08.440]  going to learn helplessness or some baloney Stockholm syndrome where we love
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:12.760]  our abusers well I don't love our abusers I want to win the future I want
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:16.040]  the good guys to stand up and take action and that's what this broadcast

[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.880]  chance to talk to him off-air about some of the other topics he wanted to come on

[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.880]  black Americans and they're demonizing that in the media I mean there's nothing
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.720]  that Ted Nugent can't do right because he's pro Liberty and the Marxist
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:09.280]  Decepticons are out there trying to divide and conquer this country we're
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:12.200]  gonna talk about that we're gonna talk about how he's been persecuted by the
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:15.840]  feds we're gonna talk about how he's got one of the most popular ammo lines in
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.560]  the country we're gonna talk most importantly about taking America back
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:24.280]  we've got him for the full hour you want Ted Nugent I had to do some serious
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:37.120]  begging but we've got him uncle Ted great to have you back with us wow where
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.280]  should we start you heard some of the topics I threw out well where should we
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:44.200]  begin let's talk about your big rock and roll tour coming up and the media trying
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:55.320]  to a lot of people my band won the Battle of the Bands we actually opened
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:58.680]  up for the Supremes and the boat troubles with the brand-new Cobo Hall
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:04.520]  back in 1962 or 63 Wow you know I just don't have any white musical influences
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:07.680]  I thought Pat Boone was weird and I thought little Richard was God you know
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:20.800]  what I mean I mean my music has a life of its own really after 50 years of
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:26.320]  touring the audiences still are so intense and passionate and high energy
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:31.920]  and let's let's morph into when I discovered the culture war you know this
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:37.600]  this tour is called Ted Nugent black power 2013 because I'm bringing forth
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:43.160]  the celebration that there really is a black thing and the black thing that
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:48.520]  inspired me from the very beginning was James Brown's work ethic little
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:55.320]  Richards work ethic Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley's their work ethic you can't
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:09:00.680]  become the fathers the gods of thunder of rhythm and blues and rock and roll
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:06.760]  unless you really put your nose to the grindstone and you work your ass off my
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:12.360]  dad and mom forced us kids to do that that was the battle cry of the American
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:17.840]  dream in the 1950s and 1960s until they until the beatniks turned into the
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:23.960]  drooling puking idiot hippies and I was always attacked in the media even the
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:28.480]  beginning when I was just a teenager because I I was a hunter because I ate
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:33.360]  venison and I carried a gun and I believed in self-defense and this new
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:39.440]  curse of leftism this Mao Tse tongue ugliness was metastasizing across
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:44.000]  America so at first Alex when I did these interviews and they would attack
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.160]  me because I spent the weekend at the shooting range with my dad or I spent
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:53.920]  the weekend with my family up north deer hunting I like squinted and furrowed my
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:58.880]  brow and went wait a minute you're condemning what is obviously perfect
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.520]  self-defense is perfect so you woke up early on just because you were being
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:11.160]  yourself and being demonized and it's so incredibly simple that that this country
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:15.360]  was founded on the Second Amendment but they try to act like it's so incredibly
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:20.160]  alien I'm tired of calling them liberals or even leftists even though that's as
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:25.080]  they're known these are as you said Maoist these are hardcore authoritarian
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:30.480]  pigs who know they're authoritarian pigs they're not environmentalists wackos
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:35.480]  they're not ignorant they're not stupid they're criminals that want to run our
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:38.600]  lives and make us their slaves I couldn't have said it better they really
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.360]  are criminals I don't care if it's a Hillary Clinton refusing to provide
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:46.640]  security on the anniversary of 9-11 the most dangerous areas in the world and
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:51.480]  then getting upset because we asked her why or that the Attorney General is
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.800]  running guns to Mexican drug gangs than trying to blame mom-and-pop gun shops
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:02.520]  further for the criminality of his directive and his program it really is
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:06.500]  like I don't know if it's one flew over the cuckoo's nest and Soylent Green or
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:10.040]  Planet of the Apes and the insanity running amok in this country right now
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:16.400]  can only be described as evil people with an evil agenda I am sick and tired
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:21.200]  I figured like way back in the 1970s when people go well they're well
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.560]  intentioned but they're misinformed that's not true at all their intentions
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:30.800]  are evil and they know exactly what we're doing may I quote Nancy you don't
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:36.400]  have to read this you need to sign it Pelosi yes you get any more anti-american
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:41.600]  and anti-constitution anti we the people than that insanity no you can't and I
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:44.920]  apologize for interrupting you and getting you off into the tyrants I just
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:48.800]  want to you have are so prominent and know so many other prominent people I
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.720]  think it's time to start a campaign to say we're really the Liberals Thomas
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:57.520]  Jefferson was a liberal saying more freedom George Washington was a liberal
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:03.000]  meaning more freedom I think they've stolen the term liberal or or even
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.080]  progressive saying let's build our country up it's time to call them what
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:12.080]  they are a cult a gang of criminals that want a managed organized economy
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:16.460]  controlled by them and their cronies and that they have basically occupied this
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:20.780]  country and there's no living with them we either take this country back and win
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:25.400]  the war or we're going to be slaves no more win the battles and just let the
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:30.840]  enemy keep launching attacks it's time to go on the total offense as the gun
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.480]  manufacturers are doing as you're doing as I'm doing that's why they're scared
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:38.800]  of us let's talk about Ted Nugent taking America and then the world back how do
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:43.080]  we get on the offense and do you agree there's no more quarter they're not
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:48.200]  giving us quarter we either take it all back or we're gonna lose
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:18.400]  people are unaware that in the Rolling Stone cover stories on the cover of
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:23.160]  Rolling Stone with a Wal-Mart PPK that I actually had on me in New York City
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:28.640]  during the photo shoot celebrating the Second Amendment for the entire front
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:35.240]  page feature story in Rolling Stone magazine in 1978 if you go back to my
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:44.040]  interviews in 1968 1965 I have always promoted and celebrated never defended
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:50.120]  the obvious and unambiguous right to keep and bear arms I have been on the
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:54.080]  front line that's why the left in the medium what you could wear you're
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:59.720]  accurately identifying is the cult of denial when you have a Valerie Jarrett
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:04.000]  who is the communications are for the president who actually publicly quotes
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.760]  mouth say tongue are you kidding me so I have been on the front line so the
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.140]  answer to the big question how do we take our country back how do we get on
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:18.080]  the offensive all you have to do is study what you and I do study what I've
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:24.320]  done since the 1960s you'll never apologize you take the face-to-face
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:29.440]  hand-to-hand close-quarter combat with the evidence from history that when
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.560]  there's power abuse like President Obama and Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton and
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:38.840]  all the SARS and all his communist buddies when they abuse the power and
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:44.600]  they create such a depth of corruption if we don't communicate adamantly firmly
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:49.640]  and politely but consistently with our elected officials every chance we get
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:54.560]  which we have to make the opportunity every week and demand accountability
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:15:05.880]  which hears it in a nutshell look in a person's eye do you believe that the
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:12.320]  government can steal from families after-tax savings when mom or dad died
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:19.160]  do you believe the government can steal after-tax savings from a family and that
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:23.360]  that should be the law of the land because if the person says yes I believe
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.080]  in it you're looking at the enemy of freedom the enemy America of America and
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:33.000]  a thief if a person wants to get rid of the death test if you want to compromise
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.240]  gun rights you're looking at the enemy no more compromise when I was on Capitol
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:43.120]  Hill last week for the recently for the State of the Union address I shook every
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.040]  Republican's hand and I wouldn't let go and I tried to shake it like chesty
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:57.040]  puller looked him in the eye and went quick with the compromise we have compromised ourselves into a corner of communism. Cut it out!

[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:18.240]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all

[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.760]  I still believe
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.760]  It feels like a crime to turn down a Ted Nugent song whenever I'm in the car
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:02.760]  stranglehold probably one of the greatest if not the greatest
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:06.760]  yeah I gotta ask you here before we get back into the news and some really hard
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:11.760]  core stuff how did you come up with stranglehold I mean were you channeling
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.760]  you know the almighty or something I mean that that is that song is so
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:18.760]  perfect how did you do that Ted Nugent?
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.760]  It is a powerful lick you should see it from where I'm sitting
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:27.760]  when I play that lick every night my bands too Alex I've got to give a big
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:32.760]  salute to the greasiest blackest gods of thunder in the world
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:36.760]  Dick Brown on drums Greg Smith on bass guitar and Derek St. Holmes on
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:41.760]  vocals and guitar I have every guitar player's dream every concert
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:46.760]  every song every audience this year we're going on the tour and with Sticks
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:50.760]  and Ariel Speedwagon we call the tour Ted Nugent Black Power because we're
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:55.760]  inspired the stranglehold lick is a variation of all those black heroes
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:59.760]  whether Bo Diddley Chuck Berry Little Richard James Brown Wilson Pickett Sam
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:04.760]  and Dave Stax Bolt all things Motown and Funk Brothers there's a grind factor
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:08.760]  that I was weaned on as a little kid in Detroit and when I pick up I could go
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:13.760]  across the room right now and grab one of my guitars if they're all plugged
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:18.760]  into amplifiers right now and I could just pick it up and whip out a lick that
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:24.760]  would make you grind like an animal during the rut I have I've been cleaning
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:29.760]  sober for 64 years and when you're cleaning sober you really tune in when
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:33.760]  you get to jam with Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and play with BB King are you
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:39.760]  kidding me you pick up you kind of sponge the essence of that soul and
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:43.760]  let's identify what that black music ultimately represented in its origins
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:51.760]  defiance defiance against slavery defiance against oppression defiance
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:57.760]  against your own black people tackling you and selling you as a slave that's
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:02.760]  where that unbelievable James Brown work ethic came from they all rose up and
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:07.760]  went yeah you think you could keep me down listen to this mother and I'm gonna
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:11.760]  play some licks that everybody's gonna dance to and that's what we do to this
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:16.760]  day so I'm very inspired by freedom that uppity black spirit of my original
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:21.760]  inspirations and we pay homage to it every night on stage and I name them by
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:26.760]  name and I've been doing it for 50 years and by the way you you mentioned this to
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:30.760]  me earlier but I just punched it in black power Ted Nugent the media is
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:34.760]  freaking out you've been saying this for 40-something years that this is what
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:39.760]  inspires you your band all of it but the so-called left the tyrants who say you
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:43.760]  don't like socialism don't like gun control it's racism has no connection to
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:47.760]  reality not even any facts they just throw the word out there they're the
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:51.760]  real race pimps Margaret Sanger saying we've got to become liberals and take
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:56.760]  over to abort the black babies what do you say to the media freaking out over
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:01.760]  your black power 2013 I mean from my research the so-called left are really
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:08.760]  the proto Nazis the left in America and England created the eugenics that Hitler
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.760]  picked up the truth is they claim that they're the anti-racist because they're
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:16.760]  the racist well I think the biggest racist in the world would either be
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:20.760]  President Obama I mean when you see Trayvon Martin could have been my son
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:25.760]  well with all due respect mr. president Brian Terry could have been my son and
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:29.760]  your Eric Holder sold the guns to the gangs that killed him try that
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:35.760]  oversized Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson Louis Farrakhan number one cause of
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:41.760]  black death in America not the not the subhuman Ku Klux Klan black Americans
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:49.760]  kill black Americans on a weekly basis than the Klan ever did in a year it's
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:54.760]  incredible and then and then you can't even have a tour paying homage to your
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:58.760]  music roots it just shows shows how sick these people are they never want people
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:02.760]  to really come together under freedom now expanding on this you mentioned the
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:06.760]  fact that the NRA is getting on the offense when we have the memos that they
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:12.760]  want to confiscate our guns when it's on record you use the truth to defeat them
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:16.760]  and during the break we were talking you know you described as Republicans are
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:20.760]  more worried about adjusting their tie than actually you know being Patriots
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.760]  expand on that I mean look it's time to stop debating all their fake arguments
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:29.760]  about the children they want our guns because they want a monopoly of power
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:32.760]  and I think that's the key to the offense is pointing that out
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:38.760]  well when I criticize the failures of the GOP I'm only the guilty need to feel
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:43.760]  guilty we have some incredible leaders in this country right now especially
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:50.760]  which is why I came to Texas ten years ago because the wonderful glorious work
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:54.760]  at the center of Detroit that I grew up in turned in the hell zone of pimp's
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:58.760]  horse and welfare brats because of liberal Democrats like mayor Coleman
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:03.760]  young and mayor Kwame Patrick and Jennifer Granholm so I came to Texas
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:08.760]  where we have genuine statesmen genuine Patriots who understand they serve we
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:12.760]  the people in the US Constitution governor Perry is the best governor in
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:18.760]  America Greg Abbott is the best attorney general in America Ron Paul Ted Cruz
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:24.760]  John Cronin there's so many great great constitutional representatives here in
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:30.760]  Texas in South Dakota Mike Rogers up in Michigan even Scott Walker now in
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:36.760]  Wisconsin we see an improvement or return to the common sense exactly so
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:40.760]  let me ask you this in their their guiding light that they have to make an
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:45.760]  oath to to become elected officials match the US Constitution the Bill of
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:53.760]  Rights so the once again I can't repeat this often enough so many people who
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:57.760]  set their alarm clocks and bust their ass to be the best that they can be they
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.760]  work they work they make ends meet they risk safe for a rainy day they demand
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.760]  accountability and productivity by their sons and everybody in their family
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:10.760]  that's how the Nugent family operates that's how the Alex Jones family
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:14.760]  operates but a lot of those people don't vote a lot of those people don't
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:18.760]  communicate they don't even know who their senator their congressman is so
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:23.760]  we the people who want upgrade and return to a US constitutionally driven
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:27.760]  America we have got to communicate with our elected officials because that some
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:32.760]  of the elected officials that I just named by name there are some of those in
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:37.760]  every state even California New Jersey in New York and Illinois they got these
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:43.760]  people but they don't hear from us so until you are an actual participant in
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:48.760]  the secret experiment self-government I'd like to thank you for nothing I
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:53.760]  agree with you and and look at the areas like Chicago and LA and the areas that
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:57.760]  these authoritarians that call themselves liberals are in control they
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:01.760]  bankrupt and destroy every city every county every state every country they
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:06.760]  run because they are con-artist criminals and again it's time for us to
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:11.760]  stop apologizing about the fact that we're right it's time for us to stand up
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:16.760]  and call these crooks out and that's why they say oh you're discredited yelling
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:20.760]  appears Morgan or or Ted Nugent you know you know told him get off people's backs
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:26.760]  and shut the hell up and you know that you're basically full of crap Oh Ted's
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:31.760]  discredited no we're the only people waking people up out of their coma and
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:36.760]  the fact that the so-called left is saying don't get angry that shows
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:41.760]  they're scared of us getting angry I've been in every media I do media every day
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:47.760]  and anybody that has ever messed with me has lost because I have all the evidence
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:51.760]  to support what I stand for because I stand for the self-evident truth and
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:59.760]  being the best that you can be

[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.760]  Ted Nugent joins us Ted Nugent.com if you're just now
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:25.760]  tweeting in again I'm Alex Jones with mfallwars.com Ted where do you think
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:30.760]  America will be if people don't stand up and don't take action which is starting
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:34.760]  to happen but if people don't stand up and really get in the face of this
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:38.760]  tyranny and back it off because by getting aggressive politically with the
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:44.760]  First Amendment we won't have to use the second but what is your concern because
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.760]  again as I said earlier I had Ron Paul on a few days ago and he's concerned
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:51.760]  about civil war it appears to a lot of sociologists and people that study this
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:57.760]  that the leftists want to start some type of conflict and then brand the
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:00.760]  Patriots as the Homeland Security documents under Obama's state that
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:04.760]  al-qaeda is not the threat now it's gun owners conservatives returning veterans
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:09.760]  they're clearly trying to brand it a article came out yesterday where
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:13.760]  Homeland Security is buying drones and in the training video they're they're
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:18.760]  going around looking for people selling guns to their neighbors so we see that
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:23.760]  the Patriot American is the new target of Homeland Security what can you say
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:27.760]  about that and how it segues into some of the persecution you've gone through
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.760]  tell us tell us what's been happening to you the last few months
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:35.760]  well there's so many issues there number one thank you for bringing these things
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:38.760]  up because now people can Google and they go to your website and if you go to
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:43.760]  Ted Nugent.com I would welcome you I would love to have you part of our Ted
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:49.760]  Nugent.com talkback we have some hardcore gung-ho great American families on my
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:54.760]  talkback on my website and we get all this latest update too and we make sure
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:59.760]  that we review it we got people inside the deepest security in the United
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:03.760]  States government that are on my talkback we have friends in most federal
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:09.760]  agencies and in every department of every political activity in every state
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:16.760]  and we're looking with a genuine spirit of concern and a genuine duty to
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:21.760]  participate as we the people to ask questions and demand answers and we got
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:26.760]  this far down there down the totem pole we've gotten this bad off and we've been
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:30.760]  abused and the the corruption has gotten this outrageous because so many
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:34.760]  Americans were disengaged they bent over and they couldn't believe that a
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:38.760]  government would hurt someone I'll never forget the interview with the lady who
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:42.760]  was in Rwanda checking out some gorillas or something and I mean they're the real
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:47.760]  gorillas not the guerrilla fighters the gorillas in the mist and she was crying
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:53.760]  because the gangsters in Rwanda who had attacked their bus and killed everybody
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:59.760]  she actually went I can't believe that a human being would intentionally hurt
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:07.760]  another human being. It's so naive. That kind of brain dead soullessness has
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:13.760]  horribly taken place and taken root and metastasized here in America so I know
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:18.760]  about the drones I know about the militarization of law enforcement but
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:24.760]  I'm not gonna guess what might happen if Obama's dream of tyranny comes true I
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:29.760]  believe that more and more people are waking up I believe that more and more
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:33.760]  people are communicating these serious issues about accountability and what
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:39.760]  happened in Benghazi and Fast and Furious the crime of Obamacare the abuse
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:44.760]  of power and the corruption the absolute proven lies of every word out of this
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:49.760]  president's mouth at the last State of the Union address I believe that we are
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:53.760]  going to vote these bastards out that we're going to demand accountability
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:57.760]  like they did in the ultra liberal hell zone of Michigan with the governor Rick
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:01.760]  Snyder now we've got a Republican he's not a conservative but he's way better
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:06.760]  than Jennifer Granholm Scott Walker huge upgrade in Wisconsin I travel and I
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:10.760]  still rock and roll and my tour will take me to every state in every major
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:16.760]  city across America again 50 years in a row now and when I communicate with
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:21.760]  people Alex I'm here to bring great great upgrade to your attention people
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:25.760]  are waking up and we are going to take this country back at the voting booth
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:29.760]  that's how we're going to do it well listen I'm not bragging about this when
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:33.760]  I tell these stories it's because it's important for people to know I could now
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:37.760]  go anywhere in the country and can't walk 10 feet down a street without
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:42.760]  listeners stopping and I'm just you know a little guy in all this and I went to a
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:48.760]  restaurant in Wimberley Texas Saturday and there were only about 10 tables and
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:53.760]  almost every table came over and wanted photos and we're listeners and I know
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:58.760]  you get the same response it's what you're saying it's exponential how many
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:02.760]  people are awake of every race color and creed it's exciting and I think the key
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:07.760]  to all this is saying look they want our guns to enslave us they're liars they're
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:12.760]  tyrants just calling it like it is people are so hungry for that and we just go
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:18.760]  past the hoax that oh we're supposed to stand down and compromise the other side
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:22.760]  never gives in they just tell us to compromise then as you said we bend over
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:25.760]  but let's talk about this I talked to you off air when you called in on the
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:29.760]  Sunday show you said oh man next time I come on I'll tell you about the crap
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:33.760]  I've been going through I think it's important to talk about how they spun
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:37.760]  what you said some of the things you know that have happened to you and how
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:41.760]  they're trying to go after you because if they can take down Ted Nugent somebody
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:46.760]  who's actually alive whose heart is beating and if they can demonize that if
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:49.760]  we don't stand behind Ted Nugent even if people don't a hundred percent agree
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:52.760]  with you out there they've got to stand behind you in the First Amendment because
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:56.760]  if they can take you down kind of the guy up there on the point I mean little
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:00.760]  Second Amendment you think of Ted Nugent and George Washington and then down the
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:04.760]  road maybe Alex Jones and Ron Paul and the NRA but I mean let's say you're Mr.
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:08.760]  Second Amendment I mean buddy I know you got the Second Amendment but I hope you
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:13.760]  got bodyguards you really are front and center have you realized that yes I have
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:19.760]  over the years I realized that when it comes to absolutely defining the God
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:23.760]  given right to keep and bear arms I've been on the forefront forever and now
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:27.760]  people are realizing that the reason I'm considered an extremist to sell it is
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:32.760]  because the concept of having a free people was very extreme in 1775 yeah the
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:36.760]  system demonizes the founders the system demonizes the founders so I'm saying
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:41.760]  you're Mr. Second Amendment tell us about the persecution well you know I've
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:44.760]  been a hunter my whole life my dad raised me to be law-abiding I've been a
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:50.760]  sheriff deputy for over 30 34 years now I conduct federal raids here in Texas
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:55.760]  with the FBI the ATF the DEA the Texas Rangers and the federal marshals I've
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:00.760]  been I've been very active hands-on in law enforcement for over 30 years now my
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:04.760]  point being is that you don't become a sheriff deputy you're not invited on the
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:09.760]  federal you know fugitive felony raids if you're a questionable guy you have to
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:12.760]  prove yourself and I proved myself during my training and I've proven
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:17.760]  myself during these raids well I'm solidly in the asset column but I've
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:21.760]  always been a legal hunter my dad said you don't dare break a law I've never
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:25.760]  hunted out of season with the wrong weapon I've always bought every tag and
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:29.760]  every license and every permit and really watched my P's and Q's well a
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:33.760]  number of years ago I was hunting in California our Ted Nugent spiritual wild
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.760]  show on outdoor channel had been the number one show an outdoor hunting show
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:42.760]  for over 26 years now every year we become the viewers favorite because I do
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:46.760]  it honestly I do a documentary to style real down-to-earth natural or
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:52.760]  organic killing your own food I don't play games I don't apologize well the US
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:58.760]  Fish and Wildlife Service has been so infested with anti hunting anti wildlife
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:03.760]  anti Ted Nugent idiots that in California hunting an apple orchard on
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:07.760]  our TV show on spirit of the wild we showed it on the air I had bought my
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:11.760]  licenses and double-checked all the legalities with the director of
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:18.760]  California Fish and Game James Fong long story short after the show aired US
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:27.760]  Fish and Wildlife jackbooted thugs subhuman punks had a 36 man guns drawn
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:34.760]  pre-dawn raid on my three hunting buddies homes in California based on the
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:41.760]  allegation equal to a jaywalking ticket that I was hunting over bait Alex they
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:47.760]  kicked down doors they confiscated guns and bows and video cameras and
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:54.760]  telephones and computers photographs they abused these poor families 100%
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:58.760]  law-abiding never broke a law in their lives
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:02.760]  upstanding members of the community and then they ran and they tried to charge
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:09.760]  me with felonies claiming that somehow in the apple orchard I had placed a bait
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:15.760]  which they did all kinds of forensic soil sample tests and they came up with
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:22.760]  nothing but because the allegations were such a scam it was such a trumped up
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:27.760]  railroad a witch hunt that the attorneys in California said I could beat it no
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:31.760]  question but it would cost me between a quarter and a half million dollars and
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:40.760]  remember a jackbooted 36 man guns drawn pre-dawn raid based on a jaywalking
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:45.760]  ticket it just shows what crazy authoritarians they are and how they use
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:50.760]  regulations to harass people but then exempt themselves when Obama's given a
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:43:01.760]  half billion dollars to his buddies to a fake energy company
