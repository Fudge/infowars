[00:00.000 --> 00:04.040]  a rice is praising the Iraqi government for its assaults on radical
[00:04.040 --> 00:08.680]  militias. In an unannounced visit to Baghdad, Rice met with top Iraqi official
[00:08.680 --> 00:12.600]  and said there is tremendous political opportunity that Iraq's government needs
[00:12.600 --> 00:17.160]  to seize. The United States military says at least 12 militants have been
[00:17.160 --> 00:21.520]  killed during fierce clashes in Baghdad-Sauder city district. The fighting
[00:21.520 --> 00:25.600]  broke out despite a warning from cleric Mutala el-Sauder who says he will declare
[00:25.600 --> 00:30.600]  war if a crackdown against his followers persists. An official in Nepal says
[00:30.600 --> 00:34.200]  Nepalese soldiers and police guarding the slopes of Mount Everest are
[00:34.200 --> 00:39.680]  authorized to shoot to stop any protests during the Olympic torch run. Chinese
[00:39.680 --> 00:43.440]  climbers are planning to take to the summit in May. Other climbers are being
[00:43.440 --> 00:47.680]  banned from the high revolutions during that time. And Pope Benedict's US trip is
[00:47.680 --> 00:54.400]  in its final day. This is IRN, USA Radio News. Hi my name is Jerry. Hi and this is
[00:54.400 --> 00:57.880]  Nikki. We've been working Andy Willoughby's three-step plan. Before the
[00:57.880 --> 01:02.280]  three-step plan I had a high stress job and then whenever I would come home it
[01:02.280 --> 01:07.040]  was difficult to leave my day at work. I wasn't there for my family the way I
[01:07.040 --> 01:11.040]  knew God wanted me to be and the way that I wanted to be. We missed out so much on
[01:11.040 --> 01:14.880]  our children's lives and it just really began to break my heart that I was
[01:14.880 --> 01:18.220]  missing things and pretty soon it was going to be too late and I just didn't
[01:18.220 --> 01:22.400]  want to miss anymore. So what this has done for me I'm working at home I'm not
[01:22.400 --> 01:26.840]  putting in 60 hours a week and I'm truly here for my family not just in body but
[01:26.840 --> 01:30.600]  mentally and emotionally. Andy Willoughby's three-step plan has just made a huge
[01:30.600 --> 01:34.400]  difference in our family. We've been very happy with the three-step plan. Hi how
[01:34.400 --> 01:38.080]  in the world are you anyway? This is Andy Willoughby with the three-step plan
[01:38.080 --> 01:41.960]  home business system. To find out how you could make more money working from home

[01:54.680 --> 01:58.720]  Tuesday's Pennsylvania primary Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama are scrambling
[01:58.720 --> 02:02.480]  for votes in the Keystone State. Pennsylvania's primary is the first in a
[02:02.480 --> 02:07.040]  month and with 158 delegates it's the biggest single prize left in the battle
[02:07.040 --> 02:11.480]  for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. Senator John McCain responds
[02:11.480 --> 02:15.840]  to Democrats comments that his health care tax credit plan would not come
[02:15.840 --> 02:19.120]  close to covering everybody. We're not gonna have a big government takeover and
[02:19.120 --> 02:23.920]  mandates they they've tried that in other countries. Both of the Senator
[02:23.920 --> 02:27.640]  Obama and Senator Clinton's plans are big government solutions. McCain spoke on
[02:27.640 --> 02:32.400]  ABC's this week. Danica Patrick can drive as well as the guys. She's become the
[02:32.400 --> 02:36.840]  first female winner in IndyCar history winning the Indy Japan 300. There was a
[02:36.840 --> 02:41.640]  huge crowd around the winners podium where Patrick was presented with the
[02:41.640 --> 02:45.760]  winners trophy. Her family was in attendance and her husband and of course
[02:45.760 --> 02:49.120]  she was happy to have them here. Correspondent Jim Armstrong for news online

[03:22.320 --> 03:26.840]  Today marks a ninth anniversary of one of the deadliest school shootings in US
[03:26.840 --> 03:31.080]  history. Columbine High School in Littleton Colorado became the scene of a
[03:31.080 --> 03:37.880]  violent shootout April 20 1999. Students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebowl killed 12
[03:37.880 --> 03:42.600]  classmates and a teacher before taking their own lives. A CNN reporter has been
[03:42.600 --> 03:46.680]  busted on drug possession charges in New York City which had quest arrested
[03:46.680 --> 03:51.920]  Friday morning around 345 Eastern Time after police stopped him in Central Park
[03:51.920 --> 03:56.840]  for violating Park Curfew. The New York Times reports cops found meth amphetamine
[03:56.840 --> 04:00.920]  in his pocket. The two-year-old boy who survived being blown by a gust of
[04:00.920 --> 04:04.720]  wind into Lake Michigan is said to be doing better. The child's grandfather had
[04:04.720 --> 04:08.320]  been pushing the boy in a stroller along the lakeside Friday when the
[04:08.320 --> 04:12.520]  stroller went into the 40 degree water. Witnesses called 911. The Chicago Fire
[04:12.520 --> 04:16.080]  Department sent the helicopter and our dive truck to the scene. They suited up,
[04:16.080 --> 04:19.800]  got into the water in about two minutes and found the boy for only about a minute
[04:19.800 --> 04:22.920]  of searching since they had a good idea where he was. The child was under water
[04:22.920 --> 04:27.840]  for at least 15 minutes before he was pulled out unconscious but alive. In
[04:27.840 --> 04:31.480]  Florida, I'd already say a group of children playing ball at a beach
[04:31.480 --> 04:35.760]  discovered a human skeleton in the backyard of a home near Port Orange.
[04:35.760 --> 04:39.000]  The Sheriff's Office in Volusia County since yesterday's find is being
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.680]  investigated as a suspicious death. The person had been dead for a few months.
[04:42.680 --> 04:47.040]  It's not clear if the remains belong to a man or a woman. Port Orange is six miles
[04:47.040 --> 04:51.920]  south of Daytona Beach. I'm Pete LaValle. I'm an USA Radio News.

[06:12.120 --> 06:25.120]  Alex Jones show. Call Alex now toll free at 877-590-5525. Now live from Austin, Texas.
[06:25.120 --> 06:29.120]  Here's Alex Jones.
[06:33.120 --> 06:40.320]  I got a copy of Leigh Iacocca's new book scanning through it. He says the US is
[06:40.320 --> 06:45.320]  turning into a martial law police state. The criminals run the government in both
[06:45.320 --> 06:52.040]  parties. The country is probably gonna fall completely. That's Leigh Iacocca, not
[06:52.040 --> 06:57.240]  Alex Jones. Jesse Ventura said the same thing on my show. Willie Nelson, former
[06:57.240 --> 07:02.160]  German defense minister last week said that on my show. The Italian former
[07:02.160 --> 07:07.800]  president is saying that anyone who is studying what's happening is completely
[07:07.800 --> 07:12.560]  and totally freaked out. If you love your family, if you care about the economy,
[07:12.560 --> 07:17.360]  your future, not just your children's future, you better be aware that some
[07:17.360 --> 07:22.080]  very evil people are in control of our government, control of our dominant
[07:22.080 --> 07:30.120]  media, and that we are in a serious crisis. It's simple. The military industrial
[07:30.120 --> 07:34.800]  complex was basically founded and created by private foreign banking
[07:34.800 --> 07:40.280]  institutions. They have now gotten full control of state, local, and the federal
[07:40.280 --> 07:46.720]  government. They are selling off the entire infrastructure of the nation, too
[07:46.720 --> 07:51.840]  far in interest for pennies on the dollar right now. There are thousands of times
[07:51.840 --> 07:55.760]  the level of debt that could physically be paid off by government, corporate,
[07:55.760 --> 08:01.440]  private, local, municipal, state. It is all by design and official IMF and
[08:01.440 --> 08:06.000]  World Bank documents that I have been covering with terror on air for six
[08:06.000 --> 08:10.080]  years since they were leaked by Joseph Stiglitz, chief economist at the World
[08:10.080 --> 08:16.800]  Bank Nobel Prize winner. The police are having martial law takeover drills all
[08:16.800 --> 08:22.000]  over the Western world for several years. They are now intensifying. They're
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.960]  now publicly admitting they're doing this because they know that what the
[08:26.960 --> 08:29.240]  globalists are planning and they've been ordered to do this. They've been
[08:29.240 --> 08:31.800]  federally trained to do this. They don't have all the pieces of the puzzle of
[08:31.800 --> 08:36.280]  exactly why they're doing it. Four complete lockdown, mass arrest, FEMA
[08:36.280 --> 08:41.600]  camps, hell on earth in this country. This is a very intelligent psychopathic
[08:41.600 --> 08:45.360]  elite. If you take criminology, and I only took a few courses in it, but I've
[08:45.360 --> 08:50.120]  since read quite a few graduate level textbooks on the subject, and I've
[08:50.120 --> 08:55.640]  interviewed many criminologists, top criminal psychologist, psychiatrist on
[08:55.640 --> 09:03.040]  serial killers, you will learn that intelligent psychopaths, controlled
[09:03.040 --> 09:09.240]  psychopaths gravitate towards two places, government jobs and law
[09:09.240 --> 09:13.240]  enforcement. That's why you've had tyranny throughout history. That's why
[09:13.240 --> 09:17.760]  government, as the founding fathers said, is wicked, bad, corrupt, very, very
[09:17.760 --> 09:22.600]  dangerous, but a limited necessary evil. That's why all the founding fathers
[09:22.600 --> 09:27.000]  said, watch it, control it, keep it tiny. Don't let the government take control
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.280]  of you. They'll invent lots of reasons of how they're doing it for your own good.
[09:30.280 --> 09:35.440]  Watch out. Tyranny will come. They will oppress you. Go read the Declaration of
[09:35.440 --> 09:38.200]  Independence, ladies and gentlemen, what King George III was doing, and they
[09:38.200 --> 09:42.880]  compare it to what's happening now. And that's it, that tyranny is the norm.
[09:42.880 --> 09:47.840]  Tyranny happens nine times out of ten, or even I'd say 99 times out of a hundred.
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.400]  It's not even 10% of the time you have liberty in history. When you do have a
[09:52.400 --> 09:56.920]  little bit of liberty, you have milk and honey, free market, good jobs, happiness.
[09:56.920 --> 10:02.720]  When you don't, you have India, China, Communist Russia, you have the
[10:02.720 --> 10:07.760]  Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, you have squalor, people in dirt floors like Mexico,
[10:07.760 --> 10:14.880]  with a tiny elite ruling over them. It's very sad that this is happening to our
[10:14.880 --> 10:18.920]  country, but that's what this show is about, is exposing it and fighting it.
[10:18.920 --> 10:24.680]  Okay, what do I have in front of me today? I have some Leigh Iacoco quotes I want to
[10:24.680 --> 10:32.120]  go over from his book. Where have all the leaders gone? Very respected, best time
[10:32.120 --> 10:36.320]  selling a business author ever, guy that brought the Chrysler back from the brink
[10:36.320 --> 10:40.280]  and several other big corporations. Also, I want to show you the corruption. IRS
[10:40.280 --> 10:45.960]  audits of big corporations drop to 20 year low. IRS corporate tax audits fall.
[10:45.960 --> 10:50.640]  Wall Street Journal, you see, if you're big and corrupt, there was a big CEO two
[10:50.640 --> 10:55.320]  weeks ago who stole $34 million from a big brokerage firm and the feds just
[10:55.320 --> 10:59.400]  said, you know, pay a fine, you're not going to get in trouble, but then they'll
[10:59.400 --> 11:03.440]  persecute an innocent Martha Stewart because she's not part of the real
[11:03.440 --> 11:08.360]  corrupt guild that runs things. For her dumping some of her own stock,
[11:08.360 --> 11:13.880]  thinking the company was going down, completely normal, but they've now made
[11:13.880 --> 11:18.640]  data crime. For the first time ever, they just convicted on racketeering in a
[11:18.640 --> 11:24.120]  prostitution case, the DC madam. And now they're going after Elliott Spitzer who
[11:24.120 --> 11:28.720]  did expose a lot of corruption for racketeering. The first conviction ever
[11:28.720 --> 11:32.480]  for racketeering first time and now that's a second case. See, things that are
[11:32.480 --> 11:36.960]  nonviolent, things that were petty before, they throw the book at you if
[11:36.960 --> 11:40.960]  you're a good guy, but got some problems. But if you're out and out part of the
[11:40.960 --> 11:45.880]  really corrupt guild, there's no audits, there's no investigations. And that's
[11:45.880 --> 11:50.600]  what Lee Iacocca is saying. I mean, we're in trouble, folks. We're in big
[11:50.600 --> 11:56.240]  trouble because we've always had corruption and good old boy, boss hog
[11:56.240 --> 12:01.280]  behavior. And that's not good, but that at least can sustain society. But when
[12:01.280 --> 12:08.120]  you get wild strip mining, wild looting, I mean, picture the United States as a
[12:08.120 --> 12:12.040]  beautiful palace. And before they would just steal a little bit out of the
[12:12.040 --> 12:15.880]  till or run off with some of the firewood or maybe still a spoon here or
[12:15.880 --> 12:21.160]  a silver ladle there. Now the thieves in government have ripped out all the
[12:21.160 --> 12:25.440]  furniture, all the mirrors, all the chandeliers, the wood paneling, the
[12:25.440 --> 12:32.880]  porcelain bathrooms, the marble floors, the main columns, the roof is falling
[12:32.880 --> 12:37.240]  in and they're busy pulling up the cobblestones and loading up their flat
[12:37.240 --> 12:42.680]  beds with it. I mean, they're just grabbing and snatching everything up.
[12:42.680 --> 12:48.040]  Politicians, just corruption is rampant. The local environmental groups openly
[12:48.040 --> 12:51.640]  own their own banks for stolen property here in Austin, where I live, openly
[12:51.640 --> 12:55.960]  involved in just upfront embezzlement and mass fraud right out in front of
[12:55.960 --> 13:01.840]  everyone that nothing happens. I mean, it's scary, ladies and gentlemen. It is
[13:01.840 --> 13:07.760]  absolutely horrifying. What's scary is that they're not just evil, but they're
[13:07.760 --> 13:11.000]  not even in control. That's what's even more scary. It's just not like there's
[13:11.000 --> 13:17.440]  some king boss, some benevolent or beneficent dictator up there who does
[13:17.440 --> 13:21.240]  bad things but doesn't allow other mid-level people to steal a lot because
[13:21.240 --> 13:26.360]  it hurts the overall system. This is just a gang of pirates running around
[13:26.360 --> 13:35.120]  doing whatever they want. I mean, the Federal Reserve is private run-for-profit.
[13:35.120 --> 13:38.520]  It changed all the banking rules so they could buy insurance companies, buy
[13:38.520 --> 13:43.840]  brokerage houses, buy up the mortgage companies, and then they changed all the
[13:43.840 --> 13:47.840]  rules so they could give loans to people that had no job, no money. Then they sold
[13:47.840 --> 13:56.360]  that as investments as triple-A gold-rated bonds and stocks, and then now
[13:56.360 --> 13:59.640]  they're saying, oh, because we're in such a crisis due to this, give us unlimited
[13:59.640 --> 14:03.560]  federal power and get rid of the three federal regulatory agencies and just give
[14:03.560 --> 14:07.720]  us the private banking families, the private stockholders of the Private
[14:07.720 --> 14:15.000]  Federal Reserve, unlimited control over the economy. These are bold individuals.
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.600]  They have issued total liquidity to get everybody in debt off a fiat. They then
[14:20.600 --> 14:24.720]  grabbed every commodity, every raw material, every piece of infrastructure.
[14:24.720 --> 14:29.640]  They then bought up all the police agencies, all the private contractors, all
[14:29.640 --> 14:38.240]  of the different mechanisms and the whole string of different apparatus that run
[14:38.240 --> 14:42.600]  all of this and now they own it and it's all multinational outside government.
[14:42.600 --> 14:48.440]  No one can stop them, basically, and they are preparing for total implosion of the
[14:48.440 --> 14:52.960]  economy, martial law, and if we get up and they'll detonate a few nukes or
[14:52.960 --> 14:57.760]  release bird flu or have some guy in a turbine in a computer animated video tell
[14:57.760 --> 15:02.600]  us he's gonna get us and, God Almighty, and they've been gearing up with one
[15:02.600 --> 15:07.160]  tenth of the college graduates to be in Homeland Security related, just guilty
[15:07.160 --> 15:11.200]  until proven innocent, martial law, terror training going on in every major
[15:11.200 --> 15:18.400]  department, just the worst scenario in history. Criminal enterprise running an
[15:18.400 --> 15:24.200]  international anti-terror mechanism. I mean, these are hardcore psychopath
[15:24.200 --> 15:28.800]  criminals who like death and destruction, like looting, who like third-world
[15:28.800 --> 15:34.680]  destruction. We're gonna come back in and all the news did. The New World Order
[15:34.680 --> 15:38.920]  murder a local activist in Austin. Are they covering it up? We'll talk about that.
[15:38.920 --> 15:44.800]  We'll get into the economy. Massive transmission. Stay with me, m4wars.com
[15:44.800 --> 15:50.200]  and prismplanet.com are the websites. This is not a game. This is not a drill.
[15:52.200 --> 16:02.200]  It is a big idea. A New World Order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[16:02.200 --> 16:07.800]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Don't their objective be world domination?
[16:07.800 --> 16:13.000]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the
[16:13.000 --> 16:20.600]  New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[16:20.600 --> 16:25.440]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is
[16:25.440 --> 16:29.800]  blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order
[16:29.800 --> 16:33.520]  agenda. Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government. Most
[16:33.520 --> 16:36.320]  people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[16:36.320 --> 16:42.000]  They're after power. Yes, they're after music. Order in-game on DVD at prismplanet.com or

[16:49.160 --> 16:56.680]  enslaved. You have been warned. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks,
[16:56.680 --> 17:02.400]  stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA? That's right. Gold has
[17:02.400 --> 17:08.360]  been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still, the financial industry refuses
[17:08.360 --> 17:13.800]  to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement. The truth be told, gold
[17:13.800 --> 17:18.840]  and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no
[17:18.840 --> 17:24.400]  word about IRAs. Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by
[17:24.400 --> 17:32.000]  keeping you in paper. If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.520]  Think it left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments. Call
[17:36.520 --> 17:53.200]  800-686-2237. Make sure that you secure your future. Call 800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[17:53.200 --> 17:59.080]  Greetings. My name is Dr. Buell Bonchite with the White Paper Chronicles from the main polluted
[17:59.080 --> 18:05.040]  stream media. I'm here to expose a fraud and an all-around un-American stinker. His
[18:05.040 --> 18:10.360]  name is Steve Schenck. His radio show called Fearless Radio. He says solution to all the
[18:10.360 --> 18:15.480]  craziness in America is just get independent and healthy so you can be fearless of all
[18:15.480 --> 18:20.760]  of the scary stuff you're not supposed to know about. Stay away from this stinker on
[18:20.760 --> 18:30.400]  website eFoodsDirect.com. I warn you, don't do eFoodsDirect.com. Don't dial 800-605-5868
[18:30.400 --> 18:37.520]  for this dangerous program. 800-605-5868. You've heard what happens to a brain on drugs. Can
[18:37.520 --> 18:42.480]  you imagine what happens to a brain that has been shanked? This is Steve. We take your
[18:42.480 --> 18:49.760]  independence very seriously. Come and find me on Fearless Radio. Call 800-605-5868. We're
[18:49.760 --> 18:55.200]  on the web eFoodsDirect.com. It's a fact. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve
[18:55.200 --> 19:00.240]  in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single
[19:00.240 --> 19:04.080]  loan they issue. With never ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher
[19:04.080 --> 19:08.880]  interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of
[19:08.880 --> 19:13.720]  us slaves to our creditors. The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed
[19:13.720 --> 19:18.160]  program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit and other
[19:18.160 --> 19:22.040]  unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks. We can terminate your
[19:22.040 --> 19:26.280]  unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing
[19:26.280 --> 19:29.880]  on your credit report. Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of
[19:29.880 --> 19:33.840]  relief because they have legally eliminated their debt. Instead of living each day in
[19:33.840 --> 19:38.000]  fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around. Call the Federal
[19:38.000 --> 19:47.280]  Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600. That's 877-943-8600 or visit FDRS.org. Find out how you can
[19:47.280 --> 19:55.560]  break the cycle of debt slavery. Visit FDRS.org today.
[19:55.560 --> 20:00.880]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[20:00.880 --> 20:09.840]  Sheriff's deputies, drug agents, the FBI and even the Coast Guard all working together
[20:09.840 --> 20:14.840]  targeting terrorists. Weeks of planning came down to action this weekend when Operation
[20:14.840 --> 20:19.920]  Sudden Impact hit the streets and the waterways. Law enforcement officials were looking for
[20:19.920 --> 20:25.160]  drugs, gangs and fugitives, but that's not all. April Thompson is here with how terrorism
[20:25.160 --> 20:31.120]  came into play, people. Part of your law officers say sometimes drugs, gangs and fugitives point
[20:31.120 --> 20:36.640]  to something else. Another crime, terrorism. That's why for the first time they're changing
[20:36.640 --> 20:46.480]  how they go about searching for those who are searching for trouble.
[20:46.480 --> 20:51.400]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. It is the 20th day of April 2008. Your calls are coming up.
[20:51.400 --> 20:58.840]  Toe free at 877-590-5525, listening in Texas. From the station I transmit from, that we
[20:58.840 --> 21:09.600]  originate from, the syndicated broadcast, 836-0590, Ford News Radio 590, KLBJ.
[21:09.600 --> 21:15.360]  You just heard a little clip from a newscast out of Memphis, Tennessee, all over the country
[21:15.360 --> 21:23.880]  from California to New Jersey, from Texas to Ohio, from Oregon to Florida. They had
[21:23.880 --> 21:28.400]  a federally funded program, which is a violation of the Tenth Amendment, but they were able
[21:28.400 --> 21:35.200]  to do this saying it was anti-terror. Thousands of officers per city in hundreds of different
[21:35.200 --> 21:41.520]  cities across the country, and this particular operation was a three-state area in Tennessee
[21:41.520 --> 21:46.200]  and surrounding areas, fanned out and randomly stopped cars, searched people on the sides
[21:46.200 --> 21:51.760]  of streets, went into shopping malls. They were also in the Mississippi searching people's
[21:51.760 --> 21:59.000]  boats, and the headlines here says, law enforcement agencies joined together for anti-terrorism
[21:59.000 --> 22:04.400]  initiative. This is out of the Memphis Daily Paper, the commercial appeal. I want to say
[22:04.400 --> 22:11.600]  how several am affiliates that we do have in Tennessee, like WBCR and Knoxville. I like
[22:11.600 --> 22:14.640]  to hear from folks in Tennessee. What do you think about this? Law enforcement agencies
[22:14.640 --> 22:19.800]  joined together for anti-terrorism initiative, and it says that the Shelby County Sheriff's
[22:19.800 --> 22:25.360]  deputies arrested 71 people, including 31 fugitives during a 24-hour street sweep that
[22:25.360 --> 22:31.240]  ended about half an hour after sunrise Sunday. The Sheriff's Office and 50 federal, state
[22:31.240 --> 22:35.920]  and local law enforcement agencies pulled over cars, climbed on boats, and served fugitive
[22:35.920 --> 22:40.800]  warrants as all part of an anti-terrorism initiative called Operation Sudden Impact,
[22:40.800 --> 22:45.880]  and it says that the military helped them. You can go on and read that article up on
[22:45.880 --> 22:52.200]  PrisonPlanet.com. We have a link to it. Now, remember that in Section 802 of the Patriot
[22:52.200 --> 23:01.440]  Act, all misdemeanors, Section 802 of H.R. 3162, all U.S. citizens are terrorists, and
[23:01.440 --> 23:09.000]  so they say that, well, people who don't want to be searched, they are told that they don't
[23:09.000 --> 23:14.000]  have any rights because this is an anti-terror operation. Oh, there's no Fourth Amendment,
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  no Fifth Amendment, no due process. You're a terrorist until told otherwise. Let me
[23:19.000 --> 23:26.000]  read an excellent article by Steve Watson from infowars.net. And again, every paragraph,
[23:26.000 --> 23:31.280]  every comment, every statement he makes has a link to mainstream news or law enforcement
[23:31.280 --> 23:37.520]  agencies. Notice mainstream media doesn't do that. We do. Everything we say, we back
[23:37.520 --> 23:45.280]  up, okay? State Fusion Centers and Pentagon run FBI programs to spy on Americans. Now,
[23:45.280 --> 23:51.880]  that article integrates with the other story by Steve from infowars.net, three states subjected
[23:51.880 --> 24:00.320]  to martial law sweeps. Now, that's what the police are saying. Now, remember, I told you
[24:00.320 --> 24:06.560]  a year before, year and a half before it came out in the news, I got secret FEMA documents
[24:06.560 --> 24:11.600]  where they had recruited tens of thousands of pastors at major churches to say, hand
[24:11.600 --> 24:18.360]  in your guns, go to FEMA camps, let them take your children, go to camps. It's of the Lord.
[24:18.360 --> 24:23.680]  Now they've recruited 26,000 preachers. Now it's been declassified in its public. We
[24:23.680 --> 24:27.840]  have links to those newscasts. The preachers, you wonder why your pastor suddenly gives
[24:27.840 --> 24:35.480]  you weird sermons about how submitting and turning guns in and going to camps is good
[24:35.480 --> 24:41.800]  and doing what government says is of the Lord and misquoting Romans 13. Let me just explain
[24:41.800 --> 24:46.760]  something before I read this article. This attack pattern, I mean, let's say men in caves
[24:46.760 --> 24:51.960]  are real, men with turbans and hats are real. You got a better chance of dying by being struck
[24:51.960 --> 24:58.120]  by lightning in the World Almanac than you do of being killed by terrorists. But let's
[24:58.120 --> 25:03.720]  just say they're real and it's totally deadly and they're hiding under every bread cupboard,
[25:03.720 --> 25:10.680]  under every bed, they're going to kill you. Do you find Al Qaeda Muslim terrorist by randomly
[25:10.680 --> 25:17.840]  just having people line up in Miami or Austin, Texas or Houston and randomly searching people?
[25:17.840 --> 25:22.960]  Or do you do that by targeting the community's terrorists come from listening to their phones,
[25:22.960 --> 25:26.560]  tracking them, not letting them come in the country, arresting people with connections
[25:26.560 --> 25:34.320]  to it and interrogating them? No. No, no, they don't do that. And I use the analogy
[25:34.320 --> 25:43.320]  during the weekday show of if I wanted a bottle of crown royal whiskey, would a Canadian whiskey,
[25:43.320 --> 25:49.160]  if I was having a party, would I randomly drive around in my car and pull up in a farm
[25:49.160 --> 25:54.440]  and just randomly run up to a creek bed and run around in the creek bed looking for crown
[25:54.440 --> 26:02.560]  royal? Or would I go to a liquor store and buy crown royal? If I was looking for Adidas
[26:02.560 --> 26:09.760]  tennis shoes, would I randomly jump out of an airplane with a parachute into the middle
[26:09.760 --> 26:17.560]  of Albuquerque and then randomly start searching a backyard for it for Adidas tennis shoes?
[26:17.560 --> 26:21.840]  Now, I would go where Adidas tennis shoes are, where you get Adidas tennis shoes. This
[26:21.840 --> 26:28.920]  is ridiculous. The so-called anti-terror training and operations in one-tenth of college graduates,
[26:28.920 --> 26:35.320]  I mean, billions of years spent on all the new big, you know, grants they give people
[26:35.320 --> 26:41.880]  to go to school. The scholarships is to learn how to data mine, spy on neighbors. They have
[26:41.880 --> 26:46.160]  law enforcement training in thousands of school districts in sixth and seventh grade. We've
[26:46.160 --> 26:52.480]  put the curriculum and interviews in my films, like police state to the takeover before 9-11,
[26:52.480 --> 26:57.360]  where they would put, where they put BATF and FBI, deputized local police at the cost
[26:57.360 --> 27:01.680]  of hundreds of thousands a year in taxpayer money, in the schools and they tell them,
[27:01.680 --> 27:07.400]  they teach them, they write essays on what their parents do on computer for files. Do
[27:07.400 --> 27:13.560]  your parents, what's in the medicine cabinet? This is mainstream news. That's fighting
[27:13.560 --> 27:19.160]  terror, ladies and gentlemen, is having your kids spy on you. This is East German Stasi.
[27:19.160 --> 27:24.160]  Our government is criminal. It hired the former head of the Stasi, Marcus Wolfe, six years
[27:24.160 --> 27:32.240]  ago to help set all this up. He just died last year, by the way. The East Germans, the Stasi,
[27:32.240 --> 27:37.320]  the attack pattern is against everyone. It is about enslaving us. It's about swarming
[27:37.320 --> 27:42.280]  us. It's federal funds, you know, they call it roundups and swarms and you'll see it
[27:42.280 --> 27:46.400]  just random cops everywhere, just randomly pulling people over. I wasn't speeding last
[27:46.400 --> 27:50.520]  week because I happen to be looking at my speedometer. Cop still pulled me over, searched
[27:50.520 --> 27:55.840]  my car, shined his light in and said, you can go. I was pulled over. You understand,
[27:55.840 --> 28:03.520]  in Austin and everywhere, I saw the cherries that night. They were just swarming. The country
[28:03.520 --> 28:08.360]  is completely gone. We've got to somehow get it back. You understand, this isn't to keep
[28:08.360 --> 28:15.160]  you safe. The borders are wide open. The illegal aliens don't get arrested for DWI or no ID.
[28:15.160 --> 28:20.840]  The police admit that in the news. This is for you, the slave. I'm going to read this
[28:20.840 --> 28:26.400]  article in its entirety. Three states subjected to martial law sweeps. When we get back, did
[28:26.400 --> 28:32.160]  Palestinian activist Raid Hamad commit suicide or was he murdered in Austin, Texas and thrown
[28:32.160 --> 28:38.520]  in Lake Austin, now known as Lake Lady Bird. We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen
[28:38.520 --> 28:44.600]  on KLBJ here in Austin, syndicated across the country from Kansas City to San Diego.
[28:44.600 --> 28:48.240]  And your calls, of course, are coming up. I got a bunch of other news, a big hour and

[33:28.580 --> 33:39.120]  you from a pay phone in Pennsylvania who's got close to 1,000 people in his church. Volunteers
[33:39.120 --> 33:48.740]  at the hospital telling you, yeah, the FEMA recruited me. There's 13,000 of us. Now there's
[33:48.740 --> 33:54.460]  6,000. It's a year and a half later. They recruited me into this. It's a secret program
[33:54.460 --> 34:00.260]  to get everybody ready for martial law and to go into camps to have their firearms taken.
[34:00.260 --> 34:06.060]  And I said, well, go ahead and just fax those over to me. And he faxed them over. We put
[34:06.060 --> 34:11.780]  them on the web and I'm under surveillance. So they came to him and kicked him out of
[34:11.780 --> 34:15.500]  the program and threatened him. And then another preacher sent me similar stuff. And then a
[34:15.500 --> 34:19.660]  year later it came out in the news and they said, yeah, we've recruited preachers nationwide
[34:19.660 --> 34:23.940]  to get you ready for martial law. We've played some of those newscasts here. And the newscasts
[34:23.940 --> 34:31.540]  say it's a good thing. You know what it's like to know there's a huge Pentagon program
[34:31.540 --> 34:36.580]  and that Northcom openly calls the U.S. a war zone and to know that they're just waiting
[34:36.580 --> 34:41.060]  to take this country completely over. And I'm not talking about the local grunts, the
[34:41.060 --> 34:47.220]  local military people, the local police. They have no idea what they're a part of. It's
[34:47.220 --> 34:51.900]  very sad to know that. Very, very sad to know that they're gearing up this whole martial
[34:51.900 --> 34:54.860]  law grid because they know you're going to freak out when they take everything you've
[34:54.860 --> 35:03.020]  got. Land of the free home of the brave overnight is disappearing. And overnight when they decide
[35:03.020 --> 35:10.100]  to engage this, they're going to take everything most of you've got. Why? Because they can.
[35:10.100 --> 35:15.900]  Because it's called empire. It's called control. It's called domination. It isn't about Republican
[35:15.900 --> 35:19.860]  or Democrat. It's about the foreign banks that own this country. Let's read what Steve
[35:19.860 --> 35:24.740]  Watson had to say. You know, we could wake up and stop all this now. That's why I tend
[35:24.740 --> 35:30.060]  to freak out yelling scream on air, get belligerent, get arrogant, get angry because frankly, I
[35:30.060 --> 35:35.220]  got to psych myself up just to deal with this. Do you imagine the fact that number one, this
[35:35.220 --> 35:40.740]  is real. This is true even if you're in denial or not. And then number two, imagine being
[35:40.740 --> 35:45.100]  the most vocal person against it and getting death threats and knowing you're under surveillance
[35:45.100 --> 35:53.700]  and dealing with that every day. Dealing with that. I have a lot of resentment for these
[35:53.700 --> 35:58.900]  people. I have a lot of anger at them. And I am freaked out. And this is a government
[35:58.900 --> 36:03.700]  that writes memos now admitted and confirmed where they say that the sexual torture of
[36:03.700 --> 36:09.100]  children is good to make quote, terror suspects answer questions and the army's own reported
[36:09.100 --> 36:16.860]  midst. They did do that. It freaks me out. I'm freaked out right now and I'm going to
[36:16.860 --> 36:22.340]  try to be calm and cover this and to know that they're training police who mean well,
[36:22.340 --> 36:28.500]  but are dumbed down and who are ignorant. I mean, cops, can't you look around you? Can't
[36:28.500 --> 36:35.620]  you understand what you're part of? Can't you see that this is all ridiculous prescription
[36:35.620 --> 36:41.540]  drugs kill 300,000 plus people a year. Cars kill close to 200,000 terror kills a few dozen
[36:41.540 --> 36:45.440]  a year on average, but our whole life, our whole way of life has to change. You've got
[36:45.440 --> 36:49.660]  to violate my rights. You've got to run warrantless checkpoints. You've got to arrest people.
[36:49.660 --> 36:53.740]  You've got to have SWAT teams and all this because there's terrorist. Can't you see it's
[36:53.740 --> 37:01.660]  a fraud? Listen to this. Three states subjected to martial law sweeps. Local police and sheriff's
[37:01.660 --> 37:08.860]  office joins feds for terror sweep that results in hundreds of citations for traffic violations.
[37:08.860 --> 37:13.780]  That's terror now is, but see, they did it all without warrants or without probable cause
[37:13.780 --> 37:19.260]  searching people on the street. First it's the airports, then it's the bus terminals
[37:19.260 --> 37:25.780]  and the subways. Oh, we don't need a warrant to search your bags. Then it's the streets.
[37:25.780 --> 37:29.260]  Then it's your home. Now they're doing gun confiscation door to door, forcing their
[37:29.260 --> 37:35.460]  way in. Federal law enforcement agencies co-opted sheriff's offices as well as state and local
[37:35.460 --> 37:40.740]  police forces in three states last weekend for a vast roundup operation. That's what
[37:40.740 --> 37:46.300]  they call it. The one sheriff's deputy was describing as martial law training. We have
[37:46.300 --> 37:50.980]  the documents. That's what it is. Law enforcement agencies in Tennessee, Mississippi and Arkansas
[37:50.980 --> 37:55.900]  took part in what was described by local media as an anti-crime and anti-terrorism initiative
[37:55.900 --> 38:00.820]  involving officers of more than 50 federal state and local agencies. Feds involved in
[38:00.820 --> 38:06.380]  local policing, which has always been a big no-no, and doing it without warrants and
[38:06.380 --> 38:11.140]  searching people without probable cause because it's anti-terror.
[38:11.140 --> 38:15.380]  Given the military style name Operation Sudden Impact, the initiative saw officers from six
[38:15.380 --> 38:19.260]  counties rounding up fugitives, conducting traffic checkpoints, climbing on boats in
[38:19.260 --> 38:24.900]  the Mississippi River, and doing other crime abatement programs. That's a quote. All under
[38:24.900 --> 38:30.300]  the label of anti-terrorism. WREG, Memphis News Channel 3, we played a few seconds of
[38:30.300 --> 38:34.220]  earlier. It's up on prison plan. Everyone will read the whole thing, reported that sheriff's
[38:34.220 --> 38:40.220]  department arrested 332 people, 142 of whom were fugitives, and they went on to call them
[38:40.220 --> 38:44.220]  terrorists in the newscast as they now seem to be known. It said we have arrested the
[38:44.220 --> 38:48.580]  terrorists. You understand how they're, notice they've announced the last six months that
[38:48.580 --> 38:54.100]  there's thousands of blonde-haired blue-eyed al-Qaeda. See, they're now, they say give
[38:54.100 --> 38:59.140]  up all your rights to fight the guys in caves. Everybody's like America, oh yeah. And then
[38:59.140 --> 39:06.980]  overnight it's, oh by the way, it's misdemeanors, it's white terrorists, they're everywhere.
[39:06.980 --> 39:10.620]  Hundreds of dollars were seized, this is from their own news report, and drugs were covered.
[39:10.620 --> 39:16.300]  At 1,292 traffic violations were handed out to speeding terrorists and illegal parking
[39:16.300 --> 39:23.140]  terrorists. It says that in the news articles. And this went on nationwide, by the way. This
[39:23.140 --> 39:27.660]  is just a three-state area article recovering. And I was pulled over during this operation
[39:27.660 --> 39:31.900]  last week in Austin, and the guy just wanted to shine his light in my car and go, okay,
[39:31.900 --> 39:36.900]  you can go, and the car's pulled over everywhere. Just randomly pulling us over, habitualizing,
[39:36.900 --> 39:41.540]  training the cops to violate the Fourth Amendment and to take federal orders. Most cops don't
[39:41.540 --> 39:45.220]  even know, by the way, these are federal operations. They're just told, go out and stop, start
[39:45.220 --> 39:51.300]  stopping everybody. The authorities even raided businesses and store owners, confiscating
[39:51.300 --> 39:55.220]  computers and paperwork and never to quote, track down possible terrorists before something
[39:55.220 --> 39:59.340]  big happens. That's a quote. The Sheriff's Department is determining if and when they
[39:59.340 --> 40:06.060]  can plan another quote, roundup. See, they call these warrant arrest systems roundups,
[40:06.060 --> 40:11.140]  get used to real political roundups that we just had in Tibet. Night of the Long Knives
[40:11.140 --> 40:15.700]  like Nazi Germany, Kristallnacht. The Sheriff's Department is determining if and when they
[40:15.700 --> 40:20.340]  plan another roundup. The operation which involved police departments, the FBI, drug
[40:20.340 --> 40:24.500]  agents, gang units, and even Coast Guard, as you see, working with the military, is
[40:24.500 --> 40:29.740]  just one example of how far law enforcement at the state and local levels is being co-opted
[40:29.740 --> 40:34.300]  and centralized by the Department of Homeland Security via mass federal grants. It also
[40:34.300 --> 40:39.260]  highlights how the distinction between crime and terrorism is becoming irrelevant. Thus
[40:39.260 --> 40:45.020]  your bill of rights is. An info wars reader called in the Alex Jones show to alert us
[40:45.020 --> 40:49.700]  to the show, I mean to the story, and explain, that's how he found it, that he had gleaned
[40:49.700 --> 40:54.140]  the information from his friend, the Sheriff's Deputy, in Memphis who had described the operation
[40:54.140 --> 40:58.660]  as training for martial law in America. And then we link to documents where they admit
[40:58.660 --> 41:03.900]  this is for martial law. Forget innocent until proven guilty, you are now a terrorist suspect
[41:03.900 --> 41:10.380]  until you were told otherwise. It is now the norm to consider everybody equally likely
[41:10.380 --> 41:17.420]  to be guilty of something than innocent. This is the protective policing or proactive policing,
[41:17.420 --> 41:24.700]  not preventative or reactive policing, and is widely indicative of a society that is
[41:24.700 --> 41:33.660]  not free. This form of proactive policing is a phenomenon that indicates a once free
[41:33.660 --> 41:40.860]  state rapidly declining into an authoritarian police state. If there was a real terror threat
[41:40.860 --> 41:45.380]  in these states, it would surely make sense for law enforcement agencies to target known
[41:45.380 --> 41:51.140]  trouble areas and follow up on already existing leads. Instead, we are seeing local police
[41:51.140 --> 41:56.860]  and Coast Guard being recruited to randomly target anyone in the area as possible terrorist.
[41:56.860 --> 42:01.700]  It's just swarming over the population. Surely, if there was a real terror threat, this activity
[42:01.700 --> 42:07.580]  would harm the effort to combat it. Of course, such activity is clearly not related to real
[42:07.580 --> 42:12.300]  or tangible terror threat. It is related to the ongoing effort to vastly increase the
[42:12.300 --> 42:17.180]  size and scope of federal government and increase the power it has over American citizens as
[42:17.180 --> 42:22.060]  the feds push to totally open the borders. We'll finish up with this article, go to a
[42:22.060 --> 42:28.860]  bunch of your calls. Then, was a local Austinite murdered or the police covering it up? Reminds
[42:28.860 --> 42:34.700]  me of the Clinton murders where they cut the guy's head off, arms, leg off, pour gasoline
[42:34.700 --> 42:38.980]  on them, and then claim they committed suicide. They have the Arkansas Medical Examiner, Family
[42:38.980 --> 42:43.500]  Malick said they committed suicide. They may kill me in a firing squad, have video of them
[42:43.500 --> 42:49.500]  shooting me and say it wasn't, that I committed suicide. We'll be right back.
[42:49.500 --> 42:57.300]  Hi, neighbor. No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single
[42:57.300 --> 43:02.060]  one of us who have prepared will have two regrets. Even those who haven't wasted a single penny
[43:02.060 --> 43:07.060]  on Christmas birthdays and vacations in order to store all the food possible. Even those
[43:07.060 --> 43:11.660]  who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food. Even those who have traded
[43:11.660 --> 43:17.340]  their gold while it will still buy food. Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and
[43:17.340 --> 43:22.540]  foolish. When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount
[43:22.540 --> 43:28.340]  of money. We will still have two regrets. We will regret that we didn't get more serious
[43:28.340 --> 43:34.380]  about more food sooner. We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food. Putting off
[43:34.380 --> 43:39.100]  emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision
[43:39.100 --> 43:52.420]  that some of us will ever make. Call 800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com. 800-409-5633.
[43:52.420 --> 43:56.820]  My cracked heels were always my nemesis. All my life I've had dry heels and rough, thick
[43:56.820 --> 44:01.900]  and skin on the soles and sides of my feet. Then my podiatrist told me about callix ointment.
[44:01.900 --> 44:06.860]  I am amazed how fast and efficient this product is at softening the hard spots. Since using
[44:06.860 --> 44:11.740]  callix, the split and cracked skin on my heels is gone, leaving them smooth and healthy looking.
[44:11.740 --> 44:16.260]  I am so grateful and no longer embarrassed in sandals. If you have dry cracked feet,
[44:16.260 --> 44:20.620]  I recommend callix ointment. You'll find it in the foot care section at drugstores, mass
[44:20.620 --> 44:26.660]  retailers and super centers. Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven? Mine
[44:26.660 --> 44:33.660]  found it in precious metals. Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession. It is liquid,
[44:33.660 --> 44:40.340]  it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt and it maintains its purchasing power.

[44:53.180 --> 44:57.780]  It's a fact. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United
[44:57.780 --> 45:02.100]  States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue, with never ending
[45:02.100 --> 45:06.500]  late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically
[45:06.500 --> 45:11.380]  impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors. The Federal Debt
[45:11.380 --> 45:15.980]  Relief System has created a successful attorney backed program to legally eliminate credit
[45:15.980 --> 45:20.260]  card debt, personal loans, lines of credit and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently
[45:20.260 --> 45:24.540]  created by the banks. We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much
[45:24.540 --> 45:28.420]  lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report. Join the thousands
[45:28.420 --> 45:32.300]  of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated
[45:32.300 --> 45:36.220]  their debt. Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action
[45:36.220 --> 45:42.140]  and turn your life around. Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600. That's

[46:52.620 --> 47:00.620]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[47:00.620 --> 47:09.500]  All right, your call is coming up in a moment, but I've got to finish up with all over the
[47:09.500 --> 47:14.780]  country, the police announcing, we're fighting terror. And they just start walking up on the
[47:14.780 --> 47:20.420]  sidewalks up against the wall. Starts shaking everybody down, black, white, Hispanic, old,
[47:20.420 --> 47:27.900]  young, marching around in black masks, police dogs, helicopters. They're jumping the shark.
[47:27.900 --> 47:31.980]  They're jumping the American people. They're letting us know we're the boss. We're under
[47:31.980 --> 47:37.220]  federal control. We're in it all for your safety and all over the country from Dallas,
[47:37.220 --> 47:41.260]  Texas, Tucson, Arizona to Oakland, California. They're coming to your door and knocking and
[47:41.260 --> 47:47.020]  saying, we want to look at your guns. We want to inspect them. Let us in. I mean, it is
[47:47.020 --> 47:51.260]  all under federal grants. I mean, they're coming at us big time, ladies and gentlemen.
[47:51.260 --> 47:54.860]  And police need to say, we don't want to be part of this. I know a lot of police are against
[47:54.860 --> 47:59.980]  this. In fact, the majority of police have been polled to our pro second amendment. Surely
[47:59.980 --> 48:04.180]  if there was a real terror threat, this activity would harm the effort to combat it. Of course,
[48:04.180 --> 48:08.260]  such activity is certainly not related to the real or tangible terror threat. It is related
[48:08.260 --> 48:12.220]  to the ongoing effort to vastly increase the size and scope of federal government and increase
[48:12.220 --> 48:16.860]  the power it has over American citizens. The information and intelligence from the operation
[48:16.860 --> 48:21.460]  will be collated and routed through the federally funded state run fusion centers, which are
[48:21.460 --> 48:25.820]  really FEMA command centers, which they admit the CIA is over. We have links to mainstream
[48:25.820 --> 48:30.140]  articles on that, which are working in conjunction with the military arm of the Department of
[48:30.140 --> 48:35.620]  Homeland Security and Northcom. Yeah, I mean, they had secret military programs with police
[48:35.620 --> 48:39.380]  20 years ago. That's in my film road to tyranny. Now it's just coming out. And this is a long
[48:39.380 --> 48:45.380]  term plan. Very cold blooded treason. Such information will soon include the DNA and
[48:45.380 --> 48:49.540]  other biometric information from every person arrested. That's right, even if you're not
[48:49.540 --> 48:54.180]  convicted, everyone, which DHS head Michael Chertoff has declared is no longer your personal
[48:54.180 --> 48:58.700]  information. Don't worry, folks. Everybody at birth for 35 years has had their blood
[48:58.700 --> 49:02.260]  taken. You were told it was for a blood test. It's now admitted. I told you a decade ago
[49:02.260 --> 49:07.460]  now mainstream news that it's been in an international DNA database, Homeland Security now has all
[49:07.460 --> 49:12.780]  of your blood 35 and younger illegally. They can also frame you with it and they will continuing.
[49:12.780 --> 49:16.400]  We recently, of course, that's illegal what they're doing. But do you think they care?
[49:16.400 --> 49:20.140]  We recently reported on the fact that after 9 11, the Justice Department advised the Bush
[49:20.140 --> 49:23.660]  administration that it was able to effectively suspend the Fourth Amendment, where domestic
[49:23.660 --> 49:27.980]  counterterrorism operations were concerned. We have a link to that White House memo. So
[49:27.980 --> 49:34.340]  see now all crime, including no seatbelt is terrorism. We have a link to that in light
[49:34.340 --> 49:39.380]  of this. And given the government has begun to class any crimes, terrorism, a set local
[49:39.380 --> 49:44.700]  and state police to work in anti terror operations. It is clear that the predictions provided
[49:44.700 --> 49:48.580]  the protections, the protections provided by the Bill of Rights and the Constitution
[49:48.580 --> 49:52.460]  are under direct threat. I'm not a good newsreader. If I read fast, folks, that's why I'm bumbling
[49:52.460 --> 49:57.220]  here. I'm going to read slow. We have seen how new provisions will effectively nullify
[49:57.220 --> 50:04.380]  the US Constitution and a recent spat of executive orders, a particular PDD 51, which outlines
[50:04.380 --> 50:09.100]  preparations for the implementation of open martial law in the event of a declared national
[50:09.100 --> 50:15.340]  emergency for any reason, including insurrection by governors or citizens, public declarations
[50:15.340 --> 50:20.700]  for martial law. Read it. We have debates in Congress how they admit it's martial law.
[50:20.700 --> 50:24.620]  You can go watch the video clips of Congress talking about it. Centralized and federally
[50:24.620 --> 50:30.060]  coordinated law enforcement programs, compliment nationwide FEMA programs to train pastors
[50:30.060 --> 50:35.940]  and other religious representatives. Again, we have a link to video of them emitting it
[50:35.940 --> 50:40.020]  to become secret police enforcers who teach their congregations to obey the government
[50:40.020 --> 50:45.140]  in preparation for the implementation of martial law, property and farm seizures, mass vaccinations
[50:45.140 --> 50:49.340]  programs and forced relocation and the split up of families. The effects of this particular
[50:49.340 --> 50:54.060]  program have already been witnessed. We have a link to that. This is not a joke. This is
[50:54.060 --> 51:00.300]  not a game. Police, this is going to ruin your future. It's going to ruin my future.
[51:00.300 --> 51:06.780]  Hard core criminal banks have overthrown hundreds of third world countries. They go in for decades,
[51:06.780 --> 51:12.060]  buy off the police, buy off the military. They buy up the parliaments, they run people
[51:12.060 --> 51:18.060]  for office, grabbing corporations, grabbing infrastructure, doing deals while they're
[51:18.060 --> 51:23.060]  at it, but always moving towards what they call the IMF riot. They have a hundred point
[51:23.060 --> 51:29.860]  plan for this. This came out in 2002 and they said they wanted to do it in the US and Europe.
[51:29.860 --> 51:35.180]  They then engineer a terror attack or an economic implosion or both. They then turn off the
[51:35.180 --> 51:40.220]  water and power, cause mass riots, have the police already trained for martial law, have
[51:40.220 --> 51:45.260]  them ride everybody down the streets on horseback, microwave gun people, sonic cannon people,
[51:45.260 --> 51:50.180]  the cops think they're maintaining order, stocks crash to almost zero, the foreign banks
[51:50.180 --> 51:56.940]  then buy up whatever's left of it and they just issue the liquidity out of nothing.
[51:56.940 --> 52:02.500]  You understand they're planning that here. May day, this is an emergency. They have got
[52:02.500 --> 52:08.260]  the final pieces going into place right now for this. Remember, I told you months before
[52:08.260 --> 52:12.460]  that they probably attacked the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[52:12.460 --> 52:16.860]  That is the level of my understanding of the enemy attack program. I can literally see
[52:16.860 --> 52:24.380]  a three dimensional map of it in my mind because I study and think about this 18 hours a day.
[52:24.380 --> 52:29.140]  I mean, I can't enjoy a movie. I can't play video games. I can't go for a walk with my
[52:29.140 --> 52:34.540]  family without thinking about it. I think about it all the time. It's all I do. Okay,
[52:34.540 --> 52:37.940]  but it's not even hard now. Listen to what Lee Iacocca said. Then we're going to your
[52:37.940 --> 52:42.300]  calls his new book, where have all the leaders gone and it gets worse gets into the police
[52:42.300 --> 52:46.660]  state. Everything, but am I the only guy in the country who's fed up with what's happening
[52:46.660 --> 52:52.860]  where the hell is our outrage? We should be screaming bloody murder. We've got a gang
[52:52.860 --> 52:59.020]  of bozos steering our ship of state over a cliff. We've got corporate gangster stealing
[52:59.020 --> 53:03.980]  us blind and we can't even clean up after a hurricane, much less build a hybrid car.
[53:03.980 --> 53:07.700]  But instead of getting mad, everybody sits around and nods their heads with the politicians
[53:07.700 --> 53:13.940]  saying stay the course. Well, that's not what everyone says, Lee. Stay the course. You've
[53:13.940 --> 53:18.820]  got to be kidding. This is America, not the damn Titanic. I'll give you a sound bite.
[53:18.820 --> 53:23.540]  Throw the bums out. He goes further to say someone has to speak up. I can hardly recognize
[53:23.540 --> 53:26.860]  this country anymore. The president of the United States by the way, I Iacocca is a big
[53:26.860 --> 53:32.380]  Republican. The president of the United States is given a free past to ignore the Constitution,
[53:32.380 --> 53:38.140]  tap our phones, lead us to war on a pack of lies. Congress responds to record deficits
[53:38.140 --> 53:43.220]  by passing a huge tax cut for the wealthy. Thanks, but I don't need it. The most famous
[53:43.220 --> 53:48.580]  business leaders are not the innovators, but the guys in handcuffs. Why are we fiddling
[53:48.580 --> 53:53.460]  in the Middle East? The Middle East is burning and nobody seems to care about it or know
[53:53.460 --> 53:57.300]  what to do. And the press is waving pom-poms instead of asking hard questions because they're
[53:57.300 --> 54:02.180]  owned by the military industrial complex. But that's not the promise of America. My
[54:02.180 --> 54:07.140]  parents and yours started and traveled across the ocean for I've had enough. How about you?
[54:07.140 --> 54:10.700]  I'll go a step further. You can't call yourself a patriot if you're not outraged. This is
[54:10.700 --> 54:14.500]  a fight I'm ready and willing to have. And he goes on to talk about how we're a police
[54:14.500 --> 54:20.340]  state. Okay, I said I'd go to your calls, folks. That they San Francisco Chronicle,
[54:20.340 --> 54:25.740]  Houston Chronicle, they've built camps. They're brainwashing the police. They're saying they're
[54:25.740 --> 54:32.460]  banning protest nationwide. Red level emergency. Even if you don't believe that elements of
[54:32.460 --> 54:37.700]  the government carried out the attacks, they certainly used them to take our freedoms and
[54:37.700 --> 54:43.180]  to attack us. They're certainly building their whole police state system for the general
[54:43.180 --> 54:49.460]  public. And the illegal aliens get free healthcare, free welfare, get passes on getting tickets.
[54:49.460 --> 54:53.260]  I've had Austin cops tell me. I've had New York cops tell me. I've read it in the news
[54:53.260 --> 54:59.420]  where police chiefs go, I arrest illegals and the judges let them go without fines. And
[54:59.420 --> 55:09.620]  the INS now ice won't come get them. And again, I'm not even bashing the illegal aliens.
[55:09.620 --> 55:14.660]  The whole point is it's not real. Ladies and gentlemen, I said I go to your calls. Who's
[55:14.660 --> 55:19.580]  up first here? Neil and Memphis, the side of martial law drills. Go ahead. You're on
[55:19.580 --> 55:30.100]  the air. Go ahead, Neil. Okay, go ahead, sir. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, how's it going? Good.
[55:30.100 --> 55:35.900]  What do you think about all this? If police are to come into my house and take our guns,
[55:35.900 --> 55:41.700]  I will shoot them on site. That's how I feel about it. Well, that happened in New Orleans.
[55:41.700 --> 55:45.580]  And what they do is they then burn your house down or gun you down. There were thousands
[55:45.580 --> 55:48.780]  of dead bodies in New Orleans. And that was all a drill to see if they could cover it
[55:48.780 --> 55:53.020]  up. They didn't bring food and water. They went in the high and dry $15 million homes
[55:53.020 --> 56:00.380]  and up took their video. We can play the audio of the gun confiscation in New Orleans. And
[56:00.380 --> 56:03.900]  they will they will burn your house down. They will kill you. I accept the fact that
[56:03.900 --> 56:08.340]  I'll die. No, I understand. I understand. Well, you're evil like the founding fathers
[56:08.340 --> 56:13.380]  who when the when the British came to confiscate the guns in 1775, election and concord, they
[56:13.380 --> 56:18.220]  fought back. And that's why I have FEMA on tape saying the founding fathers are bad
[56:18.220 --> 56:23.940]  to a classroom of cops and firemen in Kansas City. Have you ever seen that video I have?
[56:23.940 --> 56:30.140]  I don't think I have in my film road to tyranny. That's one of them that I haven't seen yet.
[56:30.140 --> 56:34.740]  It was given to me by a firefighter. I have 18 hours of the footage. I'll make sure I
[56:34.740 --> 56:40.060]  see that then. Yep, the founding fathers are bad. Hey, that's nothing. Did you see the
[56:40.060 --> 56:45.220]  statesman? I made a big deal about it last week. Mr. Bobbitt, Philip Bobbitt grandson
[56:45.220 --> 56:51.900]  of LBJ, runs some of the political affairs at UT department. The front page of the statesman
[56:51.900 --> 56:56.660]  had the Constitution being burned. I want to go back to him. Is he still there? We're
[56:56.660 --> 57:00.100]  going to hold you over, sir. The Constitution being burned and they said it's good. And
[57:00.100 --> 57:04.220]  they said we need to get rid of the Constitution to quote, keep America safe. Anything else
[57:04.220 --> 57:09.900]  you want to add, sir? I mean, did you see these FEMA takeover drills? It happened in
[57:09.900 --> 57:17.140]  Memphis. Did you see it? No, sir. I did not see it. I didn't see anything. I lived just
[57:17.140 --> 57:21.060]  south of Memphis in Mississippi. Okay, so you're not in Memphis where this happened?
[57:21.060 --> 57:25.580]  No, sir. I'm not. Anything else you want to add? I've been talking over you. Anything
[57:25.580 --> 57:30.500]  else you want to add? I'm wondering if you have studied religion to the point at how
[57:30.500 --> 57:33.740]  it's involved in our government. Okay, I'll come back and comment on that on the other
[57:33.740 --> 57:38.180]  side. Appreciate your call. More calls straight ahead. Important news straight ahead. And then

[59:54.820 --> 1:00:03.700]  Sounds from New York where Pope Benedict's U.S. trip is in its final day. This morning
[1:00:03.700 --> 1:00:09.740]  Benedict melt in silent prayer at the site of the September 11 terrorist attacks. He
[1:00:09.740 --> 1:00:14.700]  also lit a memorial candle at the World Trade Center site where he asked God to bring peace
[1:00:14.700 --> 1:00:19.620]  to our violent world. And the U.S. military says 12 militants have been killed and what's
[1:00:19.620 --> 1:00:24.860]  being described as an uptick in fighting in Baghdad's Satter City District. U.S. military
[1:00:24.860 --> 1:00:29.700]  spokesman Patrick Driscoll says redevelopment will be hard to achieve as long as Satter
[1:00:29.700 --> 1:00:34.900]  City isn't safe for workers. To get to the larger reconstruction projects,
[1:00:34.900 --> 1:00:39.100]  all the things, you know, fixing and building hospitals, electrical power, water, things
[1:00:39.100 --> 1:00:44.100]  like that, that's going to take time. But you've got to have security first before
[1:00:44.100 --> 1:00:51.260]  you can get the people in, in order to do those things. This is IRN, USA Radio News.
[1:00:51.260 --> 1:00:55.940]  Soriasis, the itching, flaking and irritation is painful, but the emotional suffering can
[1:00:55.940 --> 1:01:00.340]  be even more devastating. My body was so sore, my mind was so worn out, I could not sleep
[1:01:00.340 --> 1:01:02.900]  at night. I felt self-conscious, nobody knows what that
[1:01:02.900 --> 1:01:06.580]  flaking is. And people say, ew, it just made me feel like you're dirty. Oh, people know
[1:01:06.580 --> 1:01:09.820]  when I have this, embarrassing. Of course I felt self-conscious, not very attractive
[1:01:09.820 --> 1:01:15.060]  to look at. The solution is new and improves SkinZinc Advanced, the number one OTC treatment

[1:01:52.020 --> 1:01:56.260]  Democratic rivals Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton are today in Pennsylvania, where
[1:01:56.260 --> 1:02:02.580]  158 delegates are up for grabs in Tuesday's primary. Obama has led in overall delegates,
[1:02:02.580 --> 1:02:07.500]  but Clinton is hoping Pennsylvania will help her make up ground in the popular vote.
[1:02:07.500 --> 1:02:12.500]  Meanwhile, on the Sunday talk shows, Senator John McCain responds to Democrats' comments
[1:02:12.500 --> 1:02:17.140]  that his health care tax credit plan would not come close to covering everybody.
[1:02:17.140 --> 1:02:22.340]  We're not going to have a big government takeover and mandates. They've tried that
[1:02:22.340 --> 1:02:26.660]  in other countries. Both of those, Senator Obama and Senator Clinton's plans, are big
[1:02:26.660 --> 1:02:27.860]  government solutions.
[1:02:27.860 --> 1:02:32.500]  Officials in Afghanistan say one civilian has been killed in a gun battle between Afghan
[1:02:32.500 --> 1:02:37.620]  police and Iranian forces at the southwestern border between the two countries. Officials
[1:02:37.620 --> 1:02:43.020]  say the incident happened yesterday after an Iranian patrol entered Afghanistan. Police
[1:02:43.020 --> 1:02:51.220]  dispatched a unit and a firefight began. For more news and analysis, log on to IRNNews.com.
[1:02:51.220 --> 1:02:55.980]  With a word about Israel, here's best-selling author and Bible teacher Kay Arthur.
[1:02:55.980 --> 1:03:04.460]  If you could only visit one country, one nation on the face of this earth, it should be Israel,
[1:03:04.460 --> 1:03:07.260]  because then you'll never be the same.

[1:03:26.300 --> 1:03:28.420]  Tribune. Here's Nick D'Alesso.
[1:03:28.420 --> 1:03:33.860]  He said that he felt the victimization was because of his sensitivity and he felt that
[1:03:33.860 --> 1:03:39.260]  he would be an altruistic social worker, mainly due to his past experiences.
[1:03:39.260 --> 1:03:44.540]  Danica Patrick says winning the first IndyCar race of her career has been a long time running.
[1:03:44.540 --> 1:03:50.420]  Patrick earned the win in her 50th career start by taking the lead on the 198th lap
[1:03:50.420 --> 1:03:53.820]  in the 200 lap race. Here's Jim Armstrong.
[1:03:53.820 --> 1:03:59.340]  It was a historical race. Danica Patrick came from behind in the IndyJapan 300 to become
[1:03:59.340 --> 1:04:02.180]  the first female winner in IndyCar history.
[1:04:02.180 --> 1:04:07.740]  The Democratic presidential candidates are wooing the coal vote in the upcoming primaries.
[1:04:07.740 --> 1:04:09.140]  Here's Sandy Cozell.
[1:04:09.140 --> 1:04:13.380]  According to the National Mining Association, there are 47,000 coal workers in Pennsylvania
[1:04:13.380 --> 1:04:18.420]  and West Virginia and 21,000 in Kentucky. All three states have yet to hold primary
[1:04:18.420 --> 1:04:19.420]  elections.
[1:04:19.420 --> 1:04:24.780]  The bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City 13 years ago was remembered yesterday.
[1:04:24.780 --> 1:04:30.300]  Those attending the ceremony at the Oklahoma City National Memorial observed 168 seconds
[1:04:30.300 --> 1:04:33.060]  of silence for each of the bombing victims.
[1:04:33.060 --> 1:04:36.220]  Jack Poe is chaplain of the Oklahoma City Police Department.
[1:04:36.220 --> 1:04:43.220]  May we all leave here knowing the impact of violence and may this memorial offer comfort,
[1:04:43.220 --> 1:04:46.540]  strength, peace, hope, and serenity.
[1:04:46.540 --> 1:04:50.460]  I'm Jody Jordan and that's news from the Information Radio Network.
[1:04:50.460 --> 1:04:51.460]  It's a fact.
[1:04:51.460 --> 1:04:55.380]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States
[1:04:55.380 --> 1:04:58.900]  create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[1:04:58.900 --> 1:05:02.580]  With never ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates,
[1:05:02.580 --> 1:05:07.060]  it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to
[1:05:07.060 --> 1:05:08.060]  our creditors.
[1:05:08.060 --> 1:05:12.340]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney backed program to legally
[1:05:12.340 --> 1:05:16.540]  eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts
[1:05:16.540 --> 1:05:18.820]  which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[1:05:18.820 --> 1:05:22.980]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment
[1:05:22.980 --> 1:05:25.020]  ending with nothing on your credit report.
[1:05:25.020 --> 1:05:28.940]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally
[1:05:28.940 --> 1:05:30.260]  eliminated their debt.
[1:05:30.260 --> 1:05:34.220]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life
[1:05:34.220 --> 1:05:35.220]  around.
[1:05:35.220 --> 1:05:44.220]  The Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600, that's 877-943-8600, or visit FDRS.org.
[1:05:44.220 --> 1:05:46.860]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[1:05:46.860 --> 1:05:49.860]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[1:05:49.860 --> 1:06:03.860]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio experience, like no other, like no other.
[1:06:03.860 --> 1:06:30.820]  Live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[1:06:30.820 --> 1:06:35.620]  Under the guise of the term infrastructure protection, I discovered more than a decade
[1:06:35.620 --> 1:06:43.060]  ago, 12 years ago, secret military plans under the executive for martial law in the U.S.
[1:06:43.060 --> 1:06:49.500]  and an incremental martial law, a phasing in of tyranny, secret army, Marine Corps programs
[1:06:49.500 --> 1:06:53.860]  of local police going on since the mid-1980s.
[1:06:53.860 --> 1:06:58.460]  We have video documents from Marine Corps officers that took part in the openly illegal
[1:06:58.460 --> 1:07:05.220]  program then, then we discovered they recruited preachers, half a million truck drivers, that's
[1:07:05.220 --> 1:07:10.700]  now public, but with the preachers, they told them be secret, don't tell anybody, but prepare
[1:07:10.700 --> 1:07:14.940]  your flock for this, now 26,000 of them.
[1:07:14.940 --> 1:07:17.580]  Let's go ahead and play part of this newscast.
[1:07:17.580 --> 1:07:22.060]  This is in New Orleans, a year plus after we broke this and got the secret documents,
[1:07:22.060 --> 1:07:27.340]  they admitted this, since then other cities have admitted it, and they use Romans 13,
[1:07:27.340 --> 1:07:30.380]  Hitler's favorite quote about do whatever the government tells you, doesn't matter if
[1:07:30.380 --> 1:07:34.700]  the Bible is about the prophets being killed for not listening to the government, or Jesus
[1:07:34.700 --> 1:07:39.260]  not doing what the government told him, or the founding fathers, or this is saying all
[1:07:39.260 --> 1:07:45.220]  authority is God, and I have a preacher saying follow Hitler, he is authority, just do whatever
[1:07:45.220 --> 1:07:49.580]  authority tells you, the opposite of liberty and freedom, the opposite of the Bible, but
[1:07:49.580 --> 1:07:53.380]  this is what's taught, here's the newscast telling you martial law is good.
[1:07:53.380 --> 1:07:59.860]  While ever become a reality in America, some fear any nuclear, biological, or chemical
[1:07:59.860 --> 1:08:06.140]  attack on U.S. territory might trigger just that, and as KSLA News 12 Jeff Beall discovered,
[1:08:06.140 --> 1:08:11.060]  the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[1:08:11.060 --> 1:08:14.220]  What my cold dead hand.
[1:08:14.220 --> 1:08:20.260]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value, the overarching desire
[1:08:20.260 --> 1:08:25.420]  to protect our freedoms, but gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state
[1:08:25.420 --> 1:08:31.140]  of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, U.S. troops also arrived, something
[1:08:31.140 --> 1:08:38.260]  far easier to do even now thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act,
[1:08:38.260 --> 1:08:43.580]  that forbid U.S. troops from policing on American soil.
[1:08:43.580 --> 1:08:48.020]  If martial law weren't acted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing
[1:08:48.020 --> 1:08:52.780]  public fears and quelling dissent would be critical, and that's exactly what the clergy
[1:08:52.780 --> 1:08:56.420]  response team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[1:08:56.420 --> 1:09:00.140]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's cooperate and get this thing over
[1:09:00.140 --> 1:09:03.780]  with, and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[1:09:03.780 --> 1:09:08.460]  Such clergy response teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus
[1:09:08.460 --> 1:09:10.100]  the wishes of the public.
[1:09:10.100 --> 1:09:14.780]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're
[1:09:14.780 --> 1:09:17.220]  helping to diffuse that situation.
[1:09:17.220 --> 1:09:21.380]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public
[1:09:21.380 --> 1:09:28.580]  down or obey the law is the Bible itself, specifically Romans, Romans 13.
[1:09:28.580 --> 1:09:32.300]  Because the government has established all the law, you know, and that's what we believe
[1:09:32.300 --> 1:09:34.780]  in the Christian faith, that's what's stated in the scripture.
[1:09:34.780 --> 1:09:40.060]  Civil rights advocates believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on how
[1:09:40.060 --> 1:09:44.540]  long they expect the suspension of their rights might last.
[1:09:44.540 --> 1:09:47.340]  Jeff Farrell, KSLA News 12, reporting.
[1:09:47.340 --> 1:09:50.820]  According to Tuporville, during Hurricane Katrina, the clergy response team provided
[1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:55.140]  38 chaplains a day around the clock at eight different camps.
[1:09:55.140 --> 1:10:02.860]  Okay, now, this program is in every state, Alaska, Hawaii, Texas, 26,000 preachers as
[1:10:02.860 --> 1:10:03.860]  of last year.
[1:10:03.860 --> 1:10:06.460]  They plan to double it to 52,000 this year.
[1:10:06.460 --> 1:10:07.660]  It is a secret program.
[1:10:07.660 --> 1:10:14.300]  The secret documents are on infowars.com, and it's taking your children from you forcibly
[1:10:14.300 --> 1:10:17.740]  inoculating you, taking your guns, taking you to camps, labor camps.
[1:10:17.740 --> 1:10:19.860]  It's been in executive orders for decades.
[1:10:19.860 --> 1:10:23.340]  Remember, I'm the crazy that said they get rid of Posse Comintatus.
[1:10:23.340 --> 1:10:27.860]  You'd laugh at me and say, Posse Comintatus, and I'm the weirdo on the radio all these
[1:10:27.860 --> 1:10:32.020]  years reading PDD 51 and having emergency managers on.
[1:10:32.020 --> 1:10:33.420]  You know, I'd have emergency managers on.
[1:10:33.420 --> 1:10:37.460]  I'd have police chiefs on San Antonio, where they'd come to them with big bags of cash
[1:10:37.460 --> 1:10:41.540]  saying, go along with us, we'll pay you off, and the police chief at San Antonio kicked
[1:10:41.540 --> 1:10:42.540]  them out.
[1:10:42.540 --> 1:10:47.620]  They learned about that in 1998.
[1:10:47.620 --> 1:10:50.460]  This is a giant illegal criminal martial law.
[1:10:50.460 --> 1:10:54.340]  You ever hear about third world countries where some, you know, thug, president or general
[1:10:54.340 --> 1:10:56.820]  takes over?
[1:10:56.820 --> 1:10:59.300]  Pinochet, Hitler, the list goes on and on.
[1:10:59.300 --> 1:11:01.060]  It's the same thing here.
[1:11:01.060 --> 1:11:02.060]  They're doing it here.
[1:11:02.060 --> 1:11:06.020]  Can you imagine what a big prize this is?
[1:11:06.020 --> 1:11:07.500]  But it's a decades long.
[1:11:07.500 --> 1:11:11.380]  America's a big country to take down with the history of freedom and armed population.
[1:11:11.380 --> 1:11:15.140]  They had to brainwash the cops, militarize them, get them used to shooting at us with
[1:11:15.140 --> 1:11:17.460]  rubber bullets, so they'll do the real thing.
[1:11:17.460 --> 1:11:21.980]  I know we got loaded lines, and I want to hear from you from the rest of the show on
[1:11:21.980 --> 1:11:26.660]  this and then did Palestinian activists, Raeed Hamad, was he murdered here in Austin?
[1:11:26.660 --> 1:11:27.900]  We're going to go over that.
[1:11:27.900 --> 1:11:30.460]  But I mean, this is a big deal.
[1:11:30.460 --> 1:11:31.460]  This is a huge deal.
[1:11:31.460 --> 1:11:35.140]  I'm going to play one more clip more to come back, and I promise to do nothing but calls
[1:11:35.140 --> 1:11:39.180]  until I cover what was this gentleman murdered in the last segment.
[1:11:39.180 --> 1:11:43.660]  So stay there, Jason and Chris and Ned and JD and Robert, we'll get to all of you and
[1:11:43.660 --> 1:11:44.660]  more.
[1:11:44.660 --> 1:11:45.660]  But listen to this clip.
[1:11:45.660 --> 1:11:50.420]  Now, this is Bob Woodward, the guy that later got his really hurt very bad in Iraq.
[1:11:50.420 --> 1:11:55.260]  Now, when you watch the video, just type New Orleans gun confiscation into Google, and
[1:11:55.260 --> 1:11:57.660]  you'll get the video of this and a bunch of others.
[1:11:57.660 --> 1:12:02.660]  Now, this is video of them going into the richest part of New Orleans, the high and
[1:12:02.660 --> 1:12:09.060]  dry area, and slamming people's heads on the ground, taking their guns.
[1:12:09.060 --> 1:12:13.580]  But then the audio you're going to hear is all a lie, and this is all psychological warfare.
[1:12:13.580 --> 1:12:16.500]  ABC is the worst we found, even worse than Fox.
[1:12:16.500 --> 1:12:19.660]  They're saying, well, they didn't want to get violent, or they didn't take guns.
[1:12:19.660 --> 1:12:24.100]  They just asked for them, but then it shows them taking guns.
[1:12:24.100 --> 1:12:29.100]  So the piece is a psych warfare piece where they show one thing, but then say another.
[1:12:29.100 --> 1:12:35.060]  But go watch the video, and there's hundreds of others, just you'll see other compilations
[1:12:35.060 --> 1:12:37.940]  of videos and interviews with those that never got their guns back.
[1:12:37.940 --> 1:12:41.620]  OK, go ahead and play that clip.
[1:12:41.620 --> 1:12:42.620]  That's true, Elizabeth.
[1:12:42.620 --> 1:12:43.620]  And good evening from New Orleans.
[1:12:43.620 --> 1:12:48.140]  Here, the police and the National Guard find themselves in a very difficult position tonight
[1:12:48.140 --> 1:12:58.180]  to try to carry out an order to force people from the city without actually using force.
[1:12:58.180 --> 1:13:03.140]  Today in New Orleans, they got a lot tougher on the holdouts.
[1:13:03.140 --> 1:13:10.740]  Not only the flooded areas, but New Orleans' driest and wealthiest neighborhoods, too.
[1:13:10.740 --> 1:13:16.140]  The police and National Guard going street by street, house to house.
[1:13:16.140 --> 1:13:21.020]  We need to make sure, too, that whenever we knock on doors, people usually need to make
[1:13:21.020 --> 1:13:23.540]  note, call again.
[1:13:23.540 --> 1:13:27.140]  They say there are no orders to use force, just strong persuasion.
[1:13:27.140 --> 1:13:29.140]  Pimpaw, sometimes entering open houses.
[1:13:29.140 --> 1:13:30.820]  All right, back it up a little bit.
[1:13:30.820 --> 1:13:31.820]  Total lie.
[1:13:31.820 --> 1:13:35.100]  Now, this is double things, psych warfare.
[1:13:35.100 --> 1:13:39.260]  And I got a big article today where they admit hundreds of the pundits on TV or Pentagon
[1:13:39.260 --> 1:13:40.260]  paid.
[1:13:40.260 --> 1:13:44.340]  We told you that years ago, but it's now mainstream news today.
[1:13:44.340 --> 1:13:48.380]  Woodward is sitting there telling you that they don't use force while they show video
[1:13:48.380 --> 1:13:50.460]  of slamming rich people.
[1:13:50.460 --> 1:13:54.060]  My point is, this is going to happen to everybody in Westlake when they pull this.
[1:13:54.060 --> 1:13:58.340]  This is going to happen to everybody in the Hamptons, in New York, where you're listening
[1:13:58.340 --> 1:13:59.340]  right now.
[1:13:59.340 --> 1:14:03.460]  This is going to happen to people listening in Beverly Hills on KCAA.
[1:14:03.460 --> 1:14:07.940]  This is going to happen to people in the rich areas of Kansas City listening right now.
[1:14:07.940 --> 1:14:09.580]  This is what they're drilling for.
[1:14:09.580 --> 1:14:10.900]  They don't bring food and water.
[1:14:10.900 --> 1:14:11.900]  They come for your guns.
[1:14:11.900 --> 1:14:12.900]  Play the rest of it.
[1:14:12.900 --> 1:14:16.220]  To use force, just strong persuasion.
[1:14:16.220 --> 1:14:23.180]  Sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn and instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[1:14:23.180 --> 1:14:24.980]  You said guns will be taken.
[1:14:24.980 --> 1:14:25.980]  No one will be able to be armed.
[1:14:25.980 --> 1:14:28.060]  We will take all weapons.
[1:14:28.060 --> 1:14:31.940]  What happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to
[1:14:31.940 --> 1:14:35.260]  protect their mansions?
[1:14:35.260 --> 1:14:37.220]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[1:14:37.220 --> 1:14:40.900]  In the end, police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes.
[1:14:40.900 --> 1:14:45.460]  They were a little bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than their weapons.
[1:14:45.460 --> 1:14:49.740]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American
[1:14:49.740 --> 1:14:50.740]  city.
[1:14:50.740 --> 1:14:51.860]  Yeah, it's treason.
[1:14:51.860 --> 1:14:54.900]  This guard unit occupied a church using it as a base camp.
[1:14:54.900 --> 1:14:56.900]  They had to leave a note because that's enough.
[1:14:56.900 --> 1:14:57.900]  It just gets worse.
[1:14:57.900 --> 1:15:00.340]  I can't play anymore when I come back and take your calls.
[1:15:00.340 --> 1:15:04.100]  The point here is you can go watch scores of newscasts even worse.
[1:15:04.100 --> 1:15:09.180]  Old women being slammed to the ground, crying as their dogs are left to die when they're
[1:15:09.180 --> 1:15:10.820]  in piles of food.
[1:15:10.820 --> 1:15:16.660]  I have a book on architecture, the finest homes in the U.S. In that book is the neighborhood
[1:15:16.660 --> 1:15:18.700]  they're rating on this video.
[1:15:18.700 --> 1:15:23.060]  One house looks like the Lincoln Memorial.
[1:15:23.060 --> 1:15:25.420]  I mean, it's a house worth hundreds of mill.
[1:15:25.420 --> 1:15:27.980]  It doesn't matter, it's worth hundreds of mill.
[1:15:27.980 --> 1:15:29.900]  We love coming in your house and looting it.
[1:15:29.900 --> 1:15:31.400]  And they did loot, by the way.
[1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:32.900]  We'll be right back.
[1:15:32.900 --> 1:15:36.300]  Yeah, they're trained to take your guns and ask for seconds.
[1:15:36.300 --> 1:15:50.620]  We'll be right back.
[1:15:50.620 --> 1:16:05.460]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:16:05.460 --> 1:16:08.580]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:16:08.580 --> 1:16:13.580]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[1:16:13.580 --> 1:16:22.100]  80% of humanity is at hand, or the first time in history, the elite's plan for world
[1:16:22.100 --> 1:16:23.940]  government is blown wide over.
[1:16:23.940 --> 1:16:28.260]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:16:28.260 --> 1:16:30.940]  The old America is making great progress toward a world order.
[1:16:30.940 --> 1:16:34.060]  Most people have no idea they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[1:16:34.060 --> 1:16:35.060]  They're after power.
[1:16:35.060 --> 1:16:36.060]  That's their after-easy.

[1:16:44.700 --> 1:16:45.700]  You have been warned.
[1:16:45.700 --> 1:16:53.820]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[1:16:53.820 --> 1:16:57.900]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth and those crows feet
[1:16:57.900 --> 1:16:59.420]  over by my eyes.
[1:16:59.420 --> 1:17:03.300]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those
[1:17:03.300 --> 1:17:04.300]  wrinkles.
[1:17:04.300 --> 1:17:06.500]  Then I heard about a product called Tottenall.
[1:17:06.500 --> 1:17:11.220]  Tottenall is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the
[1:17:11.220 --> 1:17:13.980]  appearance of wrinkles, and it works.
[1:17:13.980 --> 1:17:15.940]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[1:17:15.940 --> 1:17:17.180]  Now it's your turn.
[1:17:17.180 --> 1:17:19.900]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tottenall.
[1:17:19.900 --> 1:17:23.580]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those
[1:17:23.580 --> 1:17:24.580]  wrinkles.
[1:17:24.580 --> 1:17:27.620]  See what Tottenall can do for you and your confidence.
[1:17:27.620 --> 1:17:30.140]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[1:17:30.140 --> 1:17:35.340]  For your risk-free bottle of Tottenall, call 1-800-457-9914.
[1:17:35.340 --> 1:17:38.260]  That's 1-800-457-9914.
[1:17:38.260 --> 1:17:42.140]  Tottenall is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[1:17:42.140 --> 1:17:43.140]  Guaranteed.
[1:17:43.140 --> 1:17:46.140]  Call 1-800-457-9914.
[1:17:46.140 --> 1:17:50.700]  That's 1-800-457-9914.

[1:18:51.860 --> 1:18:53.780]  Hi, neighbor.
[1:18:53.780 --> 1:18:55.940]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[1:18:55.940 --> 1:18:59.700]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[1:18:59.700 --> 1:19:04.940]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[1:19:04.940 --> 1:19:07.460]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[1:19:07.460 --> 1:19:11.180]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from
[1:19:11.180 --> 1:19:13.740]  all-time record water shortages.
[1:19:13.740 --> 1:19:18.340]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[1:19:18.340 --> 1:19:22.700]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[1:19:22.700 --> 1:19:26.980]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan
[1:19:26.980 --> 1:19:28.420]  for America.
[1:19:28.420 --> 1:19:33.060]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose
[1:19:33.060 --> 1:19:43.260]  to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose, call 800-409-5633 on the web, eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:19:43.260 --> 1:19:52.580]  Call 800-409-5633.
[1:19:52.580 --> 1:20:05.100]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[1:20:05.100 --> 1:20:09.580]  Yeah, I didn't hear it through the grapevine that almost every society in history falls
[1:20:09.580 --> 1:20:15.340]  to military takeovers by internal elites that want to rob the rest of the rich people.
[1:20:15.340 --> 1:20:18.900]  You see a lot of you rich people think you're part of the elite, but you're going to find
[1:20:18.900 --> 1:20:25.260]  out like Rome and Russia and thousands of other civilizations that you are the real
[1:20:25.260 --> 1:20:26.260]  target.
[1:20:26.260 --> 1:20:29.260]  You're going to find out real good.
[1:20:29.260 --> 1:20:32.700]  All the blue-collar, middle-class people are going to find out everything's bankrupt,
[1:20:32.700 --> 1:20:36.900]  tens of thousands of times debt compared to all the assets.
[1:20:36.900 --> 1:20:39.780]  It's just total black-op, total economic fraud.
[1:20:39.780 --> 1:20:42.500]  All right, let's go to your calls as promised.
[1:20:42.500 --> 1:20:47.260]  Jason and then Chris, Ned, JD, Robert.
[1:20:47.260 --> 1:20:50.220]  Jason in Kansas City, a KCXL listener.
[1:20:50.220 --> 1:20:51.220]  You're on the air.
[1:20:51.220 --> 1:20:52.220]  Go ahead.
[1:20:52.220 --> 1:20:57.380]  You know, I'm so used to the weekday show now where they air the calls for me.
[1:20:57.380 --> 1:21:00.260]  I'm so out of my mind I'm not even hitting the button to put them on air.
[1:21:00.260 --> 1:21:01.260]  Go ahead.
[1:21:01.260 --> 1:21:02.260]  You're now on the air, Jason.
[1:21:02.260 --> 1:21:03.260]  Hey, how are you doing?
[1:21:03.260 --> 1:21:04.260]  Good, man.
[1:21:04.260 --> 1:21:09.900]  I just wanted to say that those are gun rays that can get sick in my stomach.
[1:21:09.900 --> 1:21:17.860]  A lot of my friends listen to musicians like Immortal Technique, and he has a lot of good
[1:21:17.860 --> 1:21:22.100]  messages, but one of his messages that I don't agree with is that he's trying to push a violent
[1:21:22.100 --> 1:21:26.980]  revolution on the street, and this nation's public is no match for the supersonic weapons
[1:21:26.980 --> 1:21:28.420]  of this nation's military.
[1:21:28.420 --> 1:21:31.700]  Well, I mean, let's just say this.
[1:21:31.700 --> 1:21:34.900]  It's something we want to try to avoid at all costs.
[1:21:34.900 --> 1:21:35.900]  Anything else?
[1:21:35.900 --> 1:21:36.900]  Yes.
[1:21:36.900 --> 1:21:38.900]  I mean, don't get me wrong.
[1:21:38.900 --> 1:21:44.500]  I am willing to die for my unborn kids here, but I don't think...
[1:21:44.500 --> 1:21:48.500]  Listen, I hear you, and I understand what you're saying.
[1:21:48.500 --> 1:21:50.900]  Let me break down some strategic here.
[1:21:50.900 --> 1:21:56.500]  I'm not bashing Arabs, but they say themselves they're not known for military prowess.
[1:21:56.500 --> 1:21:59.500]  They're known for courage, but not military organization.
[1:21:59.500 --> 1:22:03.500]  There's a saying over there back 100 years ago with the British troops, thank God, you
[1:22:03.500 --> 1:22:07.620]  know, they can't shoot straight, because they sure are brave.
[1:22:07.620 --> 1:22:13.340]  We've only got maybe 50,000 combatants in Iraq, most of those foreigners, and our military
[1:22:13.340 --> 1:22:17.100]  can't even hold the green zone now, they're evacuating out of that.
[1:22:17.100 --> 1:22:22.740]  In the United States, you have 400 million guns, you've got 150 million gun owners.
[1:22:22.740 --> 1:22:30.180]  If 1% of 150 million gun owners fights back, that's 1,500,000 combatants.
[1:22:30.180 --> 1:22:36.300]  Also a guerrilla force, or a hit and run force, or a lone wolf force, a total resistance force
[1:22:36.300 --> 1:22:41.260]  like the French resistance, or the Swiss, you know, others.
[1:22:41.260 --> 1:22:42.260]  It's unstoppable.
[1:22:42.260 --> 1:22:45.540]  Now, that said, I do not want a war with the military.
[1:22:45.540 --> 1:22:51.460]  You know that over 70%, close to 80% of all military contributions were given to Ron Paul.
[1:22:51.460 --> 1:22:56.380]  You got 95% in national polls of the police are against gun control.
[1:22:56.380 --> 1:22:59.980]  The average cop's actually pretty good, the person in the military is very good.
[1:22:59.980 --> 1:23:05.900]  But they, it's evil on top, okay, and then you got some federal agencies that are pure
[1:23:05.900 --> 1:23:10.220]  evil like the BATF, the FBI is a mixed bag, they're compartmentalized, got good men and
[1:23:10.220 --> 1:23:11.860]  women in one area, bad in another.
[1:23:11.860 --> 1:23:15.740]  See, all these things are done on a need to know basis, so there's evil cadres in every
[1:23:15.740 --> 1:23:20.180]  group at the top, and then they've got servant groups within the pyramidal strata that do
[1:23:20.180 --> 1:23:21.380]  their dirty work.
[1:23:21.380 --> 1:23:26.060]  And then if they get busted or caught, the higher-ups cut them loose.
[1:23:26.060 --> 1:23:29.820]  It's now come out the direct-wirehouse orders for torture.
[1:23:29.820 --> 1:23:33.460]  But three years ago, that didn't come out, so they sent a bunch of people in Afghanistan
[1:23:33.460 --> 1:23:35.820]  and other places to prison.
[1:23:35.820 --> 1:23:39.620]  One guy tried to use the memo, contractor who tortured people to death.
[1:23:39.620 --> 1:23:44.220]  He tried to use the memo, and they declared Patriot Act on him and gagged him.
[1:23:44.220 --> 1:23:48.020]  That's a U.S. citizen who was ordered to torture and killed people under orders, and I'm not
[1:23:48.020 --> 1:23:50.680]  saying he did good, he did bad.
[1:23:50.680 --> 1:23:55.140]  But then it came out, he was ordered to, and now it turns out the military refused,
[1:23:55.140 --> 1:23:59.300]  the conductors refused, it took a direct order from Bush.
[1:23:59.300 --> 1:24:02.100]  Not just the memos, there's a direct executive order.
[1:24:02.100 --> 1:24:05.500]  That just broke last week, ordering it.
[1:24:05.500 --> 1:24:09.460]  But then when they got caught, Bush sent them to prison for following orders.
[1:24:09.460 --> 1:24:12.580]  That's another thing you got to remember out there.
[1:24:12.580 --> 1:24:20.300]  Now, if the military tries to make a move, if they try to, they'll stage an attack to
[1:24:20.300 --> 1:24:26.780]  get the military to patriotically believe they have to do this, you understand, it'll
[1:24:26.780 --> 1:24:34.340]  be packaged propaganda, or bird flu's been released, or terrorist nuke some cities.
[1:24:34.340 --> 1:24:38.540]  I said that last week on air and got an email saying, you wiped that from the TV show Jericho.
[1:24:38.540 --> 1:24:40.900]  I've never seen the TV show Jericho.
[1:24:40.900 --> 1:24:45.140]  I've been going off global as documents and battle plans for decades.
[1:24:45.140 --> 1:24:49.300]  There is a plan for the new world order to detonate nukes in this country, claim LCA to
[1:24:49.300 --> 1:24:51.940]  did it, and take all your freedoms.
[1:24:51.940 --> 1:24:56.460]  Then reorganize this into a fascist military state and invade the planet, have conscription,
[1:24:56.460 --> 1:24:58.460]  develop a 10 million man army.
[1:24:58.460 --> 1:25:00.020]  That's what they're planning to do.
[1:25:00.020 --> 1:25:03.820]  Nukes get us all mad, turn us into Nazi Germany, and have us invade.
[1:25:03.820 --> 1:25:07.060]  This time the 4th Reich will win.
[1:25:07.060 --> 1:25:08.060]  That's the plan.
[1:25:08.060 --> 1:25:09.060]  Period.
[1:25:09.060 --> 1:25:10.060]  You understand?
[1:25:10.060 --> 1:25:11.060]  That's what they're planning to do.
[1:25:11.060 --> 1:25:12.060]  Period.
[1:25:12.060 --> 1:25:13.060]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls.
[1:25:13.060 --> 1:25:14.060]  Let's move fast here.
[1:25:14.060 --> 1:25:16.860]  Oh, man, there's just points they're bringing up.
[1:25:16.860 --> 1:25:17.860]  Let's go ahead.
[1:25:17.860 --> 1:25:20.900]  They planned to let the first wave of military and police be chewed up in martial law.
[1:25:20.900 --> 1:25:22.420]  Then they're going to bring in foreign troops.
[1:25:22.420 --> 1:25:24.660]  That's now public.
[1:25:24.660 --> 1:25:26.660]  Go ahead.
[1:25:26.660 --> 1:25:27.660]  You're on air.
[1:25:27.660 --> 1:25:28.660]  Chris and Austin.
[1:25:28.660 --> 1:25:29.660]  Hey, I'm Alex.
[1:25:29.660 --> 1:25:30.660]  This is Christopher up in Cedar Park.
[1:25:30.660 --> 1:25:35.660]  I could totally see a scenario where the U.S. military would start some type of operation
[1:25:35.660 --> 1:25:44.820]  against Iran after a staged event, and then a byproduct of that would be advertised as
[1:25:44.820 --> 1:25:49.900]  the Middle East finally taking more type of offensive strike here in the U.S. They'd light
[1:25:49.900 --> 1:25:51.500]  off a nuke or something.
[1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:55.860]  That's why Bill Clinton and George Bush Sr. brought in 5,000 Iraqis trained here by the
[1:25:55.860 --> 1:26:01.380]  CIA in the 70s and 80s in every major city ready to wreak havoc, and then if they get
[1:26:01.380 --> 1:26:04.020]  killed or captured, they're Arab and it's perfect.
[1:26:04.020 --> 1:26:08.220]  By the way, what you just heard, ladies and gentlemen, is declassified.
[1:26:08.220 --> 1:26:09.220]  Go ahead.
[1:26:09.220 --> 1:26:10.220]  That's public.
[1:26:10.220 --> 1:26:11.220]  Go ahead.
[1:26:11.220 --> 1:26:15.620]  Yeah, and then definitely, they could say, well, obviously, with the offensive action
[1:26:15.620 --> 1:26:18.060]  we took in Iran, then, obviously...
[1:26:18.060 --> 1:26:23.260]  I didn't hang up on you, sir.
[1:26:23.260 --> 1:26:28.140]  And then use that as the excuse to implement martial law.
[1:26:28.140 --> 1:26:34.340]  No, sir, that's one of their plans, or they release bird flu, or, or, or, or, or.
[1:26:34.340 --> 1:26:35.700]  I mean, what do you think we should do?
[1:26:35.700 --> 1:26:37.420]  I'm just trying to warn everybody.
[1:26:37.420 --> 1:26:44.300]  Actually, people really... Obviously, you're doing an excellent job of informing people,
[1:26:44.300 --> 1:26:51.420]  but I think every citizen of this country that listens to you and is, you know, and sees
[1:26:51.420 --> 1:26:56.900]  this type of plan, how obvious it is, really needs to make a point of it every day of their
[1:26:56.900 --> 1:27:02.020]  life to start talking to all their friends and family, you know, in a concerted effort
[1:27:02.020 --> 1:27:06.660]  in a passionate way, saying, look, this is a possibility.
[1:27:06.660 --> 1:27:08.460]  What are you guys doing about it?
[1:27:08.460 --> 1:27:13.620]  And if you're not taking any action, what is the, what is the cost to us if you never
[1:27:13.620 --> 1:27:19.740]  took any action, never spread the word, and this great country were to fall or be taken
[1:27:19.740 --> 1:27:23.140]  over, you know, towards more of a total martial law...
[1:27:23.140 --> 1:27:24.140]  I agree.
[1:27:24.140 --> 1:27:28.940]  What do you think with Jesse Ventura, Lea Iacocca, German former defense ministers,
[1:27:28.940 --> 1:27:34.460]  all... Ron Paul, I mean, really Naomi Wolfe, thousands of prominent people, Bob Woodward,
[1:27:34.460 --> 1:27:38.580]  are saying what, what I've been saying for 12 years, only because I found the documents
[1:27:38.580 --> 1:27:41.460]  and found out it was... I mean, I experienced it here in Texas.
[1:27:41.460 --> 1:27:45.780]  I had police chiefs tell me, emergency managers who were Vietnam vets and intelligence, tell
[1:27:45.780 --> 1:27:47.180]  me they were approached for this.
[1:27:47.180 --> 1:27:49.700]  I mean, this is a long-term plan.
[1:27:49.700 --> 1:27:58.180]  Actually, the more that prominent type figures come out and say this, I do think that, in
[1:27:58.180 --> 1:28:04.620]  one aspect, accelerates the time in which they will initiate their major operation,
[1:28:04.620 --> 1:28:07.180]  which would eventually lead to martial law.
[1:28:07.180 --> 1:28:12.580]  So, I mean, people really have to think out of the box and start acting out of the box
[1:28:12.580 --> 1:28:17.820]  and doing things different, and be willing to do things they've never done before, and
[1:28:17.820 --> 1:28:22.460]  I'm not talking, you know, violence, but I mean, as far as really passionately talking
[1:28:22.460 --> 1:28:26.260]  to people and trying to get them to see what potentially...
[1:28:26.260 --> 1:28:27.260]  Absolutely.
[1:28:27.260 --> 1:28:28.260]  Absolutely.
[1:28:28.260 --> 1:28:29.260]  Absolutely.

[1:28:30.260 --> 1:28:31.260]  More calls.
[1:28:31.260 --> 1:28:32.260]  Straight ahead.
[1:28:32.260 --> 1:28:33.260]  Stay with me.
[1:28:33.260 --> 1:28:34.260]  This is for real.
[1:28:34.260 --> 1:28:35.260]  This isn't a drill.
[1:28:35.260 --> 1:28:36.260]  The republic's on her knees.
[1:28:36.260 --> 1:28:38.340]  The enemy is wrapping itself in the flag.
[1:28:38.340 --> 1:28:39.340]  See through there.
[1:28:39.340 --> 1:28:40.340]  Camouflage.
[1:28:40.340 --> 1:28:41.340]  Defend the republic.
[1:28:41.340 --> 1:28:44.340]  I'm risking my life to warn you.
[1:28:44.340 --> 1:28:45.340]  Listen.
[1:28:45.340 --> 1:28:55.740]  A terror storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, loose change, final cut, in-game blueprint
[1:28:55.740 --> 1:29:00.740]  for global enslavement, the true story of the Bilderberg group, the late-grade USA, America
[1:29:00.740 --> 1:29:02.220]  Freedom to Fascism.

[1:29:50.500 --> 1:29:53.780]  Someday cancer, diabetes, and poor health may disrupt your life.
[1:29:53.780 --> 1:29:56.700]  Are you going to be the one and four who gets cancer in their lifetime?
[1:29:56.700 --> 1:30:00.620]  Well, now you can set aside your worries and offset that chance with Alcavita.
[1:30:00.620 --> 1:30:05.260]  Alcavita is a pure elemental liquid silicon that is high in oxygen and highly alkaline
[1:30:05.260 --> 1:30:07.740]  to help balance our acidic lifestyles.
[1:30:07.740 --> 1:30:11.900]  Fast food and unhealthy habits contribute to excess acid and undesirable effects that
[1:30:11.900 --> 1:30:14.140]  lay foundations of disease and poor health.
[1:30:14.140 --> 1:30:18.020]  Do you remember the old saying, an apple a day keeps a doctor away, those words of wisdom
[1:30:18.020 --> 1:30:19.020]  are true.
[1:30:19.020 --> 1:30:22.540]  Your body heals itself when eating well, rather than fighting the effects of chemicals like
[1:30:22.540 --> 1:30:26.540]  corn syrup, sugar, preservatives, and other unpronounceable ingredients.
[1:30:26.540 --> 1:30:31.060]  Your body is the best pharmacy in the world and with Alcavita it can help your body naturally
[1:30:31.060 --> 1:30:35.460]  neutralize excess body acid and help hydrate your body promoting the energized healthier
[1:30:35.460 --> 1:30:36.460]  you.
[1:30:36.460 --> 1:30:50.100]  Go to AlcavitaHealth.com that's A-L-K-A-V-I-T-A Health.com or call 800-651-4011 that's 800-651-4011.
[1:30:50.100 --> 1:30:51.100]  It's a fact.
[1:30:51.100 --> 1:30:55.020]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States
[1:30:55.020 --> 1:30:58.540]  create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[1:30:58.540 --> 1:31:02.220]  With never ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates,
[1:31:02.220 --> 1:31:06.660]  it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to
[1:31:06.660 --> 1:31:07.660]  our creditors.
[1:31:07.660 --> 1:31:11.980]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney backed program to legally
[1:31:11.980 --> 1:31:16.180]  eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit and other unsecured debts
[1:31:16.180 --> 1:31:18.460]  which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[1:31:18.460 --> 1:31:22.620]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment
[1:31:22.620 --> 1:31:24.620]  ending with nothing on your credit report.
[1:31:24.620 --> 1:31:28.580]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally
[1:31:28.580 --> 1:31:30.100]  eliminated their debt.
[1:31:30.100 --> 1:31:33.860]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life
[1:31:33.860 --> 1:31:34.860]  around.
[1:31:34.860 --> 1:31:43.860]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600 that's 877-943-8600 or visit FDRS.org.
[1:31:43.860 --> 1:31:46.500]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.

[1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:54.460]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history comes the
[1:31:54.460 --> 1:32:00.580]  long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely
[1:32:00.580 --> 1:32:02.980]  destroys the official fable forever.
[1:32:02.980 --> 1:32:07.340]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which
[1:32:07.340 --> 1:32:12.140]  family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[1:32:12.140 --> 1:32:14.060]  crime are brought to justice.
[1:32:14.060 --> 1:32:17.540]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[1:32:17.540 --> 1:32:21.980]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change
[1:32:21.980 --> 1:32:25.300]  Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[1:32:39.940 --> 1:32:40.940]  other titles.
[1:32:40.940 --> 1:32:43.540]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[1:32:43.540 --> 1:32:48.220]  The truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back
[1:32:48.220 --> 1:32:51.980]  to Big Brother.
[1:32:51.980 --> 1:32:55.140]  You are listening to GCN.
[1:32:55.140 --> 1:32:59.140]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:32:59.140 --> 1:33:13.340]  Well, if the New World Order tries to hit us, does a false flag, and 1814 we took a
[1:33:13.340 --> 1:33:14.340]  little...
[1:33:14.340 --> 1:33:15.340]  You know, this is what's going to happen.
[1:33:15.340 --> 1:33:16.340]  Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[1:33:16.340 --> 1:33:20.860]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans, and we caught the bloody British in
[1:33:20.860 --> 1:33:21.860]  a town in New Orleans.
[1:33:21.860 --> 1:33:27.340]  We fired our guns and the British kept becoming, there wasn't as many as there was a while
[1:33:27.340 --> 1:33:28.340]  ago.
[1:33:28.340 --> 1:33:35.460]  We fired once more and they began to run on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[1:33:35.460 --> 1:33:39.740]  We looked down a river and we see the British come, and there must have been a hundred of
[1:33:39.740 --> 1:33:43.780]  them beaten on the drum, they stepped so high and they made their bugles ring.
[1:33:43.780 --> 1:33:47.820]  We stood beside our cotton veils and didn't say a thing, but we fired our guns and the
[1:33:47.820 --> 1:33:48.820]  British...
[1:33:48.820 --> 1:33:52.660]  You see, ladies and gentlemen, if you don't wake up and realize the tactics that the
[1:33:52.660 --> 1:33:57.180]  multinational corporations that control our government use, false flag being their favorite,
[1:33:57.180 --> 1:34:02.180]  it's over.
[1:34:02.180 --> 1:34:04.540]  Very, very simple.
[1:34:04.540 --> 1:34:10.100]  False flag terror, the globalists say in their own documents, like the PNAC documents, the
[1:34:10.100 --> 1:34:14.700]  Vigna Brzezinski's grand chess board and others, that they want terrorist attacks to mobilize
[1:34:14.700 --> 1:34:19.580]  us to go dominate the world for their financial interest, not the interest of this country.
[1:34:19.580 --> 1:34:20.580]  They're globalists.
[1:34:20.580 --> 1:34:23.780]  Dick Cheney's bought a house in Dubai, they've moved to Aliburton there.
[1:34:23.780 --> 1:34:27.500]  They still get no bid contracts against U.S. companies.
[1:34:27.500 --> 1:34:32.780]  Then they fool you and say, it's American company, it deserves no bid contract against
[1:34:32.780 --> 1:34:33.780]  Frenchies.
[1:34:33.780 --> 1:34:38.740]  Frenchies were never allowed to bid, other American companies weren't.
[1:34:38.740 --> 1:34:42.660]  Lee Iacocca is coming out saying we're going into a police state and the U.S. is falling.
[1:34:42.660 --> 1:34:46.020]  Do you understand that anyone with half a brain knows this?
[1:34:46.020 --> 1:34:51.100]  Now, they want to set off nukes, release bird flu, say terrorists did it, to nuke a whole
[1:34:51.100 --> 1:34:56.420]  string of countries, use the weapons they've got, have force conscription, this is in government
[1:34:56.420 --> 1:35:03.340]  documents, they're all linked on InfoWarsandPrisonPlanet.com, and then get us all hyped up and basically
[1:35:03.340 --> 1:35:05.180]  be a militarized society.
[1:35:05.180 --> 1:35:09.780]  They're shifting out of manufacturing, out of trade, their own strategic documents say
[1:35:09.780 --> 1:35:16.660]  it's going to be law enforcement domestically, one in ten, and the rest, military, and we're
[1:35:16.660 --> 1:35:20.300]  going to be a military camp for attacking the world.
[1:35:20.300 --> 1:35:24.780]  We're going to be the bad guys, basically, and you're going to get nothing, by the way,
[1:35:24.780 --> 1:35:27.740]  you're not going to get pension funds, money, nothing.
[1:35:27.740 --> 1:35:32.180]  The only jobs you're going to be able to have are either weapons makers or siege forces
[1:35:32.180 --> 1:35:34.140]  or domestic police.
[1:35:34.140 --> 1:35:39.100]  This is all, we're under the period of exploitation by the New World Order, where they take over
[1:35:39.100 --> 1:35:45.420]  one country, then use it as an engine to take over other nations.
[1:35:45.420 --> 1:35:50.820]  They need to trick you by staging terror attacks, so you accept martial law, and you accept
[1:35:50.820 --> 1:35:52.540]  going around and attacking the whole planet.
[1:35:52.540 --> 1:35:58.020]  I mean, I heard a Fox News clip earlier where Al Sodder is a Shiite, the news keeps saying
[1:35:58.020 --> 1:36:03.180]  he's Al-Qaeda, he's a Shiite, folks, it's the opposite group.
[1:36:03.180 --> 1:36:07.060]  This is the group they funded in the mid-90s to attack Saddam and then didn't give them
[1:36:07.060 --> 1:36:09.420]  any support, actually, to knock them out.
[1:36:09.420 --> 1:36:13.020]  They have been doing sneak attacks on them the last month, Al Sodder said, if you don't
[1:36:13.020 --> 1:36:17.980]  quit attacking us, we're going to fight back against you, and the media spins this like
[1:36:17.980 --> 1:36:21.620]  he's threatening to attack the U.S. for no reason.
[1:36:21.620 --> 1:36:26.060]  When he did a peace deal, and now they've tried to assassinate him, they admit they
[1:36:26.060 --> 1:36:29.740]  broke the deal, are trying to kill him and everybody else, so they can't be part of the
[1:36:29.740 --> 1:36:33.620]  election because they're going to get elected.
[1:36:33.620 --> 1:36:38.700]  Then our media says he is Al-Qaeda, when they're using Al-Qaeda, a Wahhabi forces to attack
[1:36:38.700 --> 1:36:39.700]  him.
[1:36:39.700 --> 1:36:45.500]  I mean, listen to this, they admit here that, oh, he's attacking, and then at the end they
[1:36:45.500 --> 1:36:50.460]  kind of just softly mentioned, because we've been attacking him.
[1:36:50.460 --> 1:36:55.100]  The treachery of the New World Order, they've broken three ceasefires with him, and he still
[1:36:55.100 --> 1:36:57.660]  comes back and signs them and won't fight back.
[1:36:57.660 --> 1:37:02.100]  Then every time he fights back, evil devil attacks for no reason, evil wicked devil at
[1:37:02.100 --> 1:37:03.900]  the end of it, because we attacked him.
[1:37:03.900 --> 1:37:10.100]  Here it is, it's absolutely incredible.
[1:37:10.100 --> 1:37:16.260]  Government halts a crackdown against Shi'ite militias, or face, quote, open war until liberation.
[1:37:16.260 --> 1:37:20.660]  But fighting continues in any case in Sodder's Baghdad stronghold, with dozens killed or
[1:37:20.660 --> 1:37:25.780]  wounded overnight, despite repeated crackdowns against Shi'ite militia criminal gangs, opposition
[1:37:25.780 --> 1:37:29.500]  to Iraqi and American forces is widespread in some areas.
[1:37:29.500 --> 1:37:34.180]  A truce declared by Sodder last summer is credited in helping with a general reduction
[1:37:34.180 --> 1:37:35.460]  in violence.
[1:37:35.460 --> 1:37:37.820]  In Baghdad, David McDougall, Fox News Radio.
[1:37:37.820 --> 1:37:41.020]  Oh, that's not the same one, there was like 50 clips.
[1:37:41.020 --> 1:37:45.940]  It's the one where Rice was laughing at him and teased him, when Sodder said, you know,
[1:37:45.940 --> 1:37:51.860]  stop trying to kill me, and then understand, he does the ceasefire, and then they sneak
[1:37:51.860 --> 1:37:56.820]  attack him over and over again, and then they call him Al Qaeda, I mean, it's just, it's
[1:37:56.820 --> 1:37:58.060]  okay, that was a good clip anyways.
[1:37:58.060 --> 1:38:00.380]  All right, I'm just going to rampage through calls now.
[1:38:00.380 --> 1:38:01.380]  Who is up first here?
[1:38:01.380 --> 1:38:03.380]  JD in Mississippi, you're on the air.
[1:38:03.380 --> 1:38:05.380]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[1:38:05.380 --> 1:38:06.380]  Good.
[1:38:06.380 --> 1:38:07.780]  Look, I wanted to run a few things past you.
[1:38:07.780 --> 1:38:11.700]  First of all, we've got me and some friends of mine here trying to make some effort to
[1:38:11.700 --> 1:38:13.620]  get the sodium fluoride out of the water.
[1:38:13.620 --> 1:38:19.860]  We're dumping, I think it's 0.8 mg L milligram per liter into the water here in Ripley, Mississippi.
[1:38:19.860 --> 1:38:22.020]  Yeah, that'll give you a 20 point IQ reduction.
[1:38:22.020 --> 1:38:23.940]  Oh yeah, probably worse than that.
[1:38:23.940 --> 1:38:26.380]  Well, that's what the federal studies admit, yeah, it's chemical weapons.
[1:38:26.380 --> 1:38:31.540]  Oh yeah, we've got doctors locally here that know about sodium fluoride, we're trying to
[1:38:31.540 --> 1:38:32.540]  get them together.
[1:38:32.540 --> 1:38:36.100]  We're going to go before the city and get them to take it out, and if they don't, we're
[1:38:36.100 --> 1:38:39.100]  going to blow it up in the press, and they're going to receive all kinds of...
[1:38:39.100 --> 1:38:42.860]  Yeah, Google government studies, bringing the Pulitzer Prize winning book about World
[1:38:42.860 --> 1:38:45.300]  War II, where the Nazis put it in the camp water.
[1:38:45.300 --> 1:38:48.300]  Oh, of course, I know all about it.
[1:38:48.300 --> 1:38:52.380]  The second thing I wanted to run past you, I think it was the last caller of the first
[1:38:52.380 --> 1:38:56.540]  hour, I very much agree with that guy.
[1:38:56.540 --> 1:39:03.180]  I just recently bought an SKS, myself, you can get them legally, 10 round clip, 7.62
[1:39:03.180 --> 1:39:06.860]  by 3.9 ammo, really durable gun.
[1:39:06.860 --> 1:39:07.860]  150 bucks.
[1:39:07.860 --> 1:39:12.020]  Oh yeah, you can get them for 150, 200, 300 bucks, depending on what you...
[1:39:12.020 --> 1:39:14.260]  They used to be about $60, 10 years ago.
[1:39:14.260 --> 1:39:15.900]  Oh yeah, the ammo is dirty.
[1:39:15.900 --> 1:39:19.260]  Listen, you can get them with bigger clips, 30 round clips, very nice weapon.
[1:39:19.260 --> 1:39:20.260]  Oh yeah, the...
[1:39:20.260 --> 1:39:22.620]  You can shoot bulls-eyed 100 yards every time with them.
[1:39:22.620 --> 1:39:25.740]  Oh yeah, the 20 rounds are the most reliable from what I hear.
[1:39:25.740 --> 1:39:31.060]  The stock one I had was 10 rounds, but that is the best weapon probably to defend your
[1:39:31.060 --> 1:39:32.060]  family with.
[1:39:32.060 --> 1:39:34.060]  It's a semi-automatic, AK-47 variant.
[1:39:34.060 --> 1:39:35.060]  Exactly.
[1:39:35.060 --> 1:39:38.300]  They bust down the door, they threaten my family, they're going to get what's coming
[1:39:38.300 --> 1:39:39.300]  to them.
[1:39:39.300 --> 1:39:42.740]  Well, the book of Solomon says there's a time to kill, a time to heal, a time for war, and
[1:39:42.740 --> 1:39:44.860]  a time for peace, and I'm not going to put up with them.
[1:39:44.860 --> 1:39:50.060]  Well, you're anti-American, America is about being surveilled, having open borders, turning
[1:39:50.060 --> 1:39:55.300]  your guns in, America is about having poison, putting your family's water, and the founding
[1:39:55.300 --> 1:39:57.500]  fathers are bad, and how dare you.
[1:39:57.500 --> 1:40:00.460]  That's why I have FEMA on tape saying the founding fathers are bad, and I agree with
[1:40:00.460 --> 1:40:02.580]  them, and I think you're evil.
[1:40:02.580 --> 1:40:06.820]  Listen to these evil people saying they would defend their freedom.
[1:40:06.820 --> 1:40:07.820]  You're with Al-Qaeda.
[1:40:07.820 --> 1:40:09.700]  Al-Qaeda attacked us to get our freedoms.
[1:40:09.700 --> 1:40:12.900]  That's why you've got to give up all your freedoms, and Al-Qaeda and Al-Caeda won't
[1:40:12.900 --> 1:40:13.900]  attack anymore.
[1:40:13.900 --> 1:40:15.780]  Look, I know most police agree with you.
[1:40:15.780 --> 1:40:19.300]  That's why they need to stop violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[1:40:19.300 --> 1:40:23.340]  My parents just got back from Germany, and they gave me this big blown-up photo, famous
[1:40:23.340 --> 1:40:29.180]  photo of an East German soldier just a few months after they put up the barbed wire, wouldn't
[1:40:29.180 --> 1:40:35.060]  let people go across Checkpoint Charlie to get to West Germany, and it's this young East
[1:40:35.060 --> 1:40:39.220]  German officer, and there's this little toddler, and the dad and mother have gotten through,
[1:40:39.220 --> 1:40:42.660]  and the toddler got left behind, and the toddler's putting his hands up to the East
[1:40:42.660 --> 1:40:45.820]  German soldier, and the East German soldier went ahead and opened the bar bar and let
[1:40:45.820 --> 1:40:46.820]  him go through.
[1:40:46.820 --> 1:40:49.900]  He was trying to stop the family, but once they got through, he went ahead and picked
[1:40:49.900 --> 1:40:51.460]  the toddler up, put him through.
[1:40:51.460 --> 1:40:55.260]  They took him and tortured him to death.
[1:40:55.260 --> 1:40:58.140]  You see, and that's the question you got to ask yourself, military and police.
[1:40:58.140 --> 1:41:01.460]  Would you help that toddler, or would you send him to a FEMA camp?
[1:41:01.460 --> 1:41:04.100]  Are you going to say, I'm just going to follow orders?
[1:41:04.100 --> 1:41:08.700]  Are you going to – I guess you'll probably gun the toddler down or something.
[1:41:08.700 --> 1:41:09.700]  That's what they would do.
[1:41:09.700 --> 1:41:12.420]  They'd shoot you if you tried to go out, and you'll call yourself an American.
[1:41:12.420 --> 1:41:14.700]  Well, that's shame on you then.
[1:41:14.700 --> 1:41:15.700]  Not me, man.
[1:41:15.700 --> 1:41:18.340]  They may kill me or whatever, but I'm not going along with this.
[1:41:18.340 --> 1:41:19.500]  Let's talk to Ned in New York.
[1:41:19.500 --> 1:41:20.500]  You're on the air.
[1:41:20.500 --> 1:41:21.500]  Go ahead.
[1:41:21.500 --> 1:41:22.500]  Hey, Alex.
[1:41:22.500 --> 1:41:24.020]  A quick question about fluoride.
[1:41:24.020 --> 1:41:26.020]  Actually, I was at the dentist.
[1:41:26.020 --> 1:41:31.260]  I've been going to the NYU School of Dentistry to save money, and I'm having a crown put
[1:41:31.260 --> 1:41:33.260]  on.
[1:41:33.260 --> 1:41:39.620]  I had complained about the fluoride already, and I explained to them that, you know, it
[1:41:39.620 --> 1:41:42.460]  was used in concentration camps and Gulags.
[1:41:42.460 --> 1:41:46.660]  I explained, you know, it's in the – it's the main ingredient in rat poison.
[1:41:46.660 --> 1:41:48.180]  Obviously, the students don't know.
[1:41:48.180 --> 1:41:52.780]  They have it in their textbook, but I had overheard a teacher tell the student, you
[1:41:52.780 --> 1:41:58.260]  know, due to ethical issues, they couldn't administer it to me after that.
[1:41:58.260 --> 1:42:02.220]  And then the next time I went in, they offered me canvasside, which, if you know a little
[1:42:02.220 --> 1:42:07.340]  Latin, side is what kills homicide, suicide, pesticide, well, canvasside is supposed to
[1:42:07.340 --> 1:42:08.340]  kill cavities.
[1:42:08.340 --> 1:42:09.340]  It's a blue liquid.
[1:42:09.340 --> 1:42:10.840]  It's basically the fluoride.
[1:42:10.840 --> 1:42:14.140]  So I was wondering, since I know your dad is a dentist, you know, I'm not sure.
[1:42:14.140 --> 1:42:17.580]  My dad – my dad now knows it's deadly.
[1:42:17.580 --> 1:42:19.820]  Tell you what, I'll try to explain when we get back.
[1:42:19.820 --> 1:42:20.820]  Stay there.
[1:42:20.820 --> 1:42:28.420]  Then we'll go to George, Robert, Gary, Tom, everybody else.
[1:42:28.420 --> 1:42:30.980]  And was this local Palestinian activist murdered?
[1:42:30.980 --> 1:42:31.980]  The police say no.
[1:42:31.980 --> 1:42:35.180]  He had his arms, legs, mouth, face bound.
[1:42:35.180 --> 1:42:37.580]  I hope they don't throw me in the river and say I committed suicide.
[1:42:37.580 --> 1:42:39.580]  Folks, I'm not committing suicide.
[1:42:39.580 --> 1:42:50.460]  Ha, we'll be right back.
[1:42:50.460 --> 1:42:52.420]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[1:42:52.420 --> 1:42:56.100]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[1:42:56.100 --> 1:42:58.500]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[1:42:58.500 --> 1:43:01.300]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:43:01.300 --> 1:43:05.740]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the
[1:43:05.740 --> 1:43:07.340]  New World Order master plan.
[1:43:07.340 --> 1:43:11.620]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[1:43:11.620 --> 1:43:16.820]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[1:43:16.820 --> 1:43:19.900]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[1:43:37.780 --> 1:43:40.860]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[1:43:40.860 --> 1:43:42.980]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:43:42.980 --> 1:43:44.860]  Burn the Info Bombs to disc.

[1:43:49.140 --> 1:43:50.140]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:43:50.140 --> 1:43:51.140]  Hi, neighbor.
[1:43:51.140 --> 1:43:54.020]  This is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[1:43:54.020 --> 1:43:57.460]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[1:43:57.460 --> 1:44:02.260]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately
[1:44:02.260 --> 1:44:07.460]  to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[1:44:07.460 --> 1:44:11.780]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is
[1:44:11.780 --> 1:44:17.060]  all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only
[1:44:17.060 --> 1:44:21.900]  chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[1:44:21.900 --> 1:44:25.580]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest
[1:44:25.580 --> 1:44:30.540]  of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[1:44:30.540 --> 1:44:35.580]  Decide it's food now or probably never, but can you afford to be wrong?
[1:44:35.580 --> 1:44:36.580]  Decide now.
[1:44:36.580 --> 1:44:38.220]  Place your bet.
[1:44:38.220 --> 1:44:39.900]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[1:44:39.900 --> 1:44:45.780]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:44:45.780 --> 1:44:50.900]  Call 800-409-5633.
[1:44:50.900 --> 1:44:51.900]  Storable food.
[1:44:51.900 --> 1:44:52.900]  Storable food.
[1:44:52.900 --> 1:44:56.900]  HempUSA.org has an inexpensive, nutritionally dense, high-frequency food.

[1:45:10.420 --> 1:45:12.180]  pancakes, cookies, you name it.
[1:45:12.180 --> 1:45:14.980]  The entire planet should make this a staple food in their diet.
[1:45:14.980 --> 1:45:19.060]  The seeds will scrape the colon wall, the powder will feed the body vital minerals, and the
[1:45:19.060 --> 1:45:21.820]  oil will clean the arterial walls and feed the brain.
[1:45:21.820 --> 1:45:23.900]  Try our powder seeds and oil today.
[1:45:23.900 --> 1:45:28.700]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempUSA.org.

[1:45:32.820 --> 1:45:36.580]  Remember, vacuum packaging this food will have at least a five-year shelf life stored
[1:45:36.580 --> 1:45:38.180]  in a cool, dark, dry place.
[1:45:38.180 --> 1:45:41.460]  Holidays are coming, and this would make a perfect gift for friends and family.
[1:45:41.460 --> 1:45:46.140]  Call today 908-691-2608 at hempUSA.org.
[1:45:46.140 --> 1:45:50.700]  And remember, let your food be your medicine, and your medicine be your food.
[1:45:50.700 --> 1:45:54.820]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that
[1:45:54.820 --> 1:45:58.820]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[1:45:58.820 --> 1:45:59.820]  the water?
[1:45:59.820 --> 1:46:03.460]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed
[1:46:03.460 --> 1:46:04.620]  into the skin.
[1:46:04.620 --> 1:46:09.300]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to
[1:46:09.300 --> 1:46:14.860]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold,
[1:46:14.860 --> 1:46:15.860]  algae and fungus.
[1:46:15.860 --> 1:46:21.020]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever
[1:46:21.020 --> 1:46:22.020]  comes first.
[1:46:22.020 --> 1:46:26.140]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[1:46:26.140 --> 1:46:28.260]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[1:46:28.260 --> 1:46:29.260]  What about you?

[1:46:58.900 --> 1:47:05.860]  All right, I'm getting all these phone calls, emails.
[1:47:05.860 --> 1:47:09.020]  We have written a story for Infowars.com Friday about this.
[1:47:09.020 --> 1:47:13.700]  See, the man you investigate, you know, he was murdered, we're looking into it.
[1:47:13.700 --> 1:47:18.100]  I called four or five members that had his last name today, couldn't get in touch with
[1:47:18.100 --> 1:47:19.100]  him.
[1:47:19.100 --> 1:47:23.780]  If anybody knows this gentleman's family, Palestinian activists that mailed schoolbooks
[1:47:23.780 --> 1:47:29.700]  to Palestinian children, and so he was raided and investigated by the FBI for it, please
[1:47:29.700 --> 1:47:34.700]  email Trey with an E, t-r-e-y, at Infowars.com.
[1:47:34.700 --> 1:47:37.380]  We want you on the weekday show, come up in the next few days.
[1:47:37.380 --> 1:47:41.540]  Palestinian activists, Raid Hamid, commit suicide.
[1:47:41.540 --> 1:47:45.260]  And he was found a few days ago in Lake Austin, which is really the Colorado River, they now
[1:47:45.260 --> 1:47:49.100]  call it Lady Bird Lake, they change the name every five minutes.
[1:47:49.100 --> 1:47:51.620]  But he was found dead floating in it.
[1:47:51.620 --> 1:47:56.420]  And actually, Paul, who helps take the phone calls and run the show here, on the Sunday
[1:47:56.420 --> 1:48:00.060]  show, he does lights and camera for K.I.
[1:48:00.060 --> 1:48:02.140]  Television, he actually broke the news.
[1:48:02.140 --> 1:48:05.660]  He was listening to the scanner when they found the body, when the police found it.
[1:48:05.660 --> 1:48:09.060]  And he was telling me that at first, of course, they thought it was a murder, they reported
[1:48:09.060 --> 1:48:11.540]  that at first, and then it changed to suspicious death.
[1:48:11.540 --> 1:48:17.380]  And now the police have put out a press release saying that his hands, feet were bound, that
[1:48:17.380 --> 1:48:21.980]  his mouth, you know, eyes were bound, but that that's consistent with someone staging.
[1:48:21.980 --> 1:48:24.740]  So this guy did a false flag on himself.
[1:48:24.740 --> 1:48:28.220]  Governments never staged terror attacks on themselves and then blaming on somebody else,
[1:48:28.220 --> 1:48:29.860]  though they admit they do.
[1:48:29.860 --> 1:48:34.780]  But no, no, this guy did this, I guess, to make the police look bad or the FBI look bad.
[1:48:34.780 --> 1:48:36.300]  No evidence of that.
[1:48:36.300 --> 1:48:39.340]  In days, they just say, that's it, case closed.
[1:48:39.340 --> 1:48:42.500]  And Paul, you broke the story.
[1:48:42.500 --> 1:48:46.180]  What was said at first?
[1:48:46.180 --> 1:48:51.420]  Anything that I heard that was, when I was on the scanner, it was just the police, you
[1:48:51.420 --> 1:48:55.460]  know, trying to hunt, you know, chase down the body because it was floating down there.
[1:48:55.460 --> 1:48:59.900]  And then the next day when I heard it on the news that my other job, they pretty much alluded
[1:48:59.900 --> 1:49:05.980]  to the fact that, you know, they stated that he was bound and gagged and they had an interview
[1:49:05.980 --> 1:49:09.020]  with the girl that pretty much discovered it, you know, called the police.
[1:49:09.020 --> 1:49:11.180]  I was trying to get that clip before I got out here.
[1:49:11.180 --> 1:49:13.100]  And what did she say about the body?
[1:49:13.100 --> 1:49:14.100]  From memory?
[1:49:14.100 --> 1:49:15.100]  We'll play it tomorrow.
[1:49:15.100 --> 1:49:19.220]  But it just said that looked like he was in, I believe she said it looked like he was
[1:49:19.220 --> 1:49:23.660]  in agony or something like that, like he was in pain or something, didn't really look
[1:49:23.660 --> 1:49:24.660]  that good.
[1:49:24.660 --> 1:49:26.180]  You know, and I, well, here's the deal.
[1:49:26.180 --> 1:49:30.460]  Famine Malik, the Arkansas Medical Examiner ruled close to 100 deaths of suicide with
[1:49:30.460 --> 1:49:35.020]  heads cut off, arms cut off, gasoline, burnt, they'd walk up on burned bodies dismembered
[1:49:35.020 --> 1:49:37.260]  and he would rule at suicide.
[1:49:37.260 --> 1:49:40.700]  Gary Webb, who got the Pulitzer Prize for exposing CIA drug dealing, had a new book
[1:49:40.700 --> 1:49:42.740]  coming out proving it all.
[1:49:42.740 --> 1:49:45.580]  He had said he was getting threats, guys had been in his house, they double tapped him
[1:49:45.580 --> 1:49:49.740]  in the head, blew his jaw off with the first shot, then shot him in the back of the head.
[1:49:49.740 --> 1:49:53.180]  And the police said, oh, this is quite normal to shoot yourself twice in the head.
[1:49:53.180 --> 1:49:54.680]  I want it known now.
[1:49:54.680 --> 1:49:57.940]  Somebody shoots me in the head, I get drowned and I'm bound.
[1:49:57.940 --> 1:50:01.780]  Cop of the year, he called his partner, he exposed Oklahoma City, Terrence Gehke is an
[1:50:01.780 --> 1:50:03.140]  inside job.
[1:50:03.140 --> 1:50:05.300]  And he called his partner and said, I'm being followed by Feds.
[1:50:05.300 --> 1:50:09.300]  He had the files, you know, proving it that he'd been told stand down or something bad
[1:50:09.300 --> 1:50:10.300]  was going to happen.
[1:50:10.300 --> 1:50:14.060]  He said, I got Feds following me, he was found in a field tortured to death, shot twice in
[1:50:14.060 --> 1:50:15.060]  the back of the head.
[1:50:15.060 --> 1:50:16.540]  I've had the cops on who exposed it.
[1:50:16.540 --> 1:50:17.540]  They said it was a suicide.
[1:50:17.540 --> 1:50:19.980]  I mean, this is starting to get really sick, Paul.
[1:50:19.980 --> 1:50:20.980]  Yeah.
[1:50:20.980 --> 1:50:24.020]  I mean, it just kind of, it took a while for me to register when you were talking about
[1:50:24.020 --> 1:50:27.740]  the guy that was bound and I'm like, hold up, that was the guy that I had heard about
[1:50:27.740 --> 1:50:29.300]  on Wednesday.
[1:50:29.300 --> 1:50:32.060]  And then, you know, when we ran the story on Thursday and then you're saying that it
[1:50:32.060 --> 1:50:38.220]  was a suicide, I'm like, no, not while he was bound, while his hands were duct taped
[1:50:38.220 --> 1:50:39.220]  behind.
[1:50:39.220 --> 1:50:40.220]  Yeah.
[1:50:40.220 --> 1:50:41.220]  They say that's how he, they say that's how he committed suicide.
[1:50:41.220 --> 1:50:42.220]  Yeah.
[1:50:42.220 --> 1:50:43.220]  He was pretty much hogtied.
[1:50:43.220 --> 1:50:47.420]  Listen, I need that newscast when you define that woman that was first interviewed by now
[1:50:47.420 --> 1:50:48.420]  they'll call him.
[1:50:48.420 --> 1:50:51.540]  Now we'll tell them this is a, they'll call and tell her to shut up if they've told,
[1:50:51.540 --> 1:50:55.980]  they also, when they killed Gary Webb, they had his family say, yeah, he'd been depressed,
[1:50:55.980 --> 1:50:56.980]  not suicide.
[1:50:56.980 --> 1:50:59.380]  The family gets threatened to keep their mouth shuttered.
[1:50:59.380 --> 1:51:00.380]  Go ahead.
[1:51:00.380 --> 1:51:02.220]  I'm just going to go find the clip for you real quick.
[1:51:02.220 --> 1:51:03.220]  Okay.
[1:51:03.220 --> 1:51:04.220]  Okay.
[1:51:04.220 --> 1:51:05.540]  And if not, we'll have it tomorrow on the weekday show.
[1:51:05.540 --> 1:51:06.540]  This is unbelievable.
[1:51:06.540 --> 1:51:09.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, God, they killed this guy.
[1:51:09.700 --> 1:51:10.700]  There's no doubt who killed him.
[1:51:10.700 --> 1:51:11.700]  I don't know.
[1:51:11.700 --> 1:51:16.500]  Israel, UPI and AP reported six years ago, reported they were going to kill people inside
[1:51:16.500 --> 1:51:19.500]  the U S who were involved with the Palestinians.
[1:51:19.500 --> 1:51:20.500]  That was reported.
[1:51:20.500 --> 1:51:22.260]  We have links to that in the article we wrote.
[1:51:22.260 --> 1:51:23.260]  Was it Israel?
[1:51:23.260 --> 1:51:24.260]  Was it the FBI?
[1:51:24.260 --> 1:51:26.340]  Oh, they never kill anybody.
[1:51:26.340 --> 1:51:27.660]  Was it the police?
[1:51:27.660 --> 1:51:29.660]  Was it another Arab group?
[1:51:29.660 --> 1:51:30.820]  Who knows?
[1:51:30.820 --> 1:51:35.380]  But the point is, is that when they say, oh, no, it's a, it's a suicide, you know, something
[1:51:35.380 --> 1:51:36.380]  stinks to high heaven.
[1:51:36.380 --> 1:51:41.300]  I mean, did he, did he want to make the cops look bad and then kill himself?
[1:51:41.300 --> 1:51:46.940]  That's a very small chance, but, um, he'd gone on national TV and talked about it.
[1:51:46.940 --> 1:51:47.940]  He was suing him.
[1:51:47.940 --> 1:51:49.140]  Well, he's dead now.
[1:51:49.140 --> 1:51:50.380]  Man, I hope they don't kill me.
[1:51:50.380 --> 1:51:54.300]  And it's kind of like they said that Dr. David Kelly that headed up the bio weapons program
[1:51:54.300 --> 1:51:55.300]  in England.
[1:51:55.300 --> 1:51:59.300]  Uh, they said he killed himself and later it came out, police showed up and five guys
[1:51:59.300 --> 1:52:03.300]  in black uniforms ran away and it turned out he wrote memos saying, I've been threatened.
[1:52:03.300 --> 1:52:06.060]  They're going to kill me and put me in the woods.
[1:52:06.060 --> 1:52:08.700]  Princess Diana told everybody that Prince Charles told her face to face.
[1:52:08.700 --> 1:52:11.740]  I'm going to kill you in a fake auto accident three months before.
[1:52:11.740 --> 1:52:12.740]  That's now admitted.
[1:52:12.740 --> 1:52:15.060]  I mean, they kill you now.
[1:52:15.060 --> 1:52:16.060]  They slit his wrist.
[1:52:16.060 --> 1:52:17.060]  No blood at the scene.
[1:52:17.060 --> 1:52:18.420]  He blooded death with no blood.
[1:52:18.420 --> 1:52:20.260]  Then they said he took pills.
[1:52:20.260 --> 1:52:23.220]  There was 300 undigested pills in his belly.
[1:52:23.220 --> 1:52:25.900]  I mean, they do this over and they kill cops.
[1:52:25.900 --> 1:52:26.900]  They kill everybody.
[1:52:26.900 --> 1:52:29.500]  And then they say you committed suicide.
[1:52:29.500 --> 1:52:30.500]  Nope.
[1:52:30.500 --> 1:52:34.500]  I mean, they'll probably cut my head off and stick it on a pike over London Bridge and
[1:52:34.500 --> 1:52:36.140]  say I committed suicide.
[1:52:36.140 --> 1:52:39.700]  You can't cut your own head off your own arms and legs off.
[1:52:39.700 --> 1:52:43.420]  I'm giving each caller a minute, Robert in bull Verde, Texas.
[1:52:43.420 --> 1:52:44.420]  You're on the air.
[1:52:44.420 --> 1:52:45.420]  Thanks for holding.
[1:52:45.420 --> 1:52:49.700]  Hey Alex, I'm calling because my neighbors and I need your help regarding the globalist
[1:52:49.700 --> 1:52:55.900]  money that is flooding into Texas and buying up rural water companies just as fast as they
[1:52:55.900 --> 1:52:56.900]  can.
[1:52:56.900 --> 1:52:57.900]  Yeah.
[1:52:57.900 --> 1:53:01.500]  Dutch, Swiss, German, British, Spanish, buying the roads for pennies on the dollar with
[1:53:01.500 --> 1:53:04.500]  sweetheart deals, local politicians, mass corruption.
[1:53:04.500 --> 1:53:11.540]  Hey, we were just bought out here locally and the ink was barely dry on this globalist
[1:53:11.540 --> 1:53:17.180]  purchase and they immediately increased our rates 85.5%.
[1:53:17.180 --> 1:53:23.100]  Have you have you looked at the leaked IMF World Bank documents 2002?
[1:53:23.100 --> 1:53:25.860]  I'm still in shock over my 85%.
[1:53:25.860 --> 1:53:26.860]  Okay.
[1:53:26.860 --> 1:53:27.860]  That's nothing.
[1:53:27.860 --> 1:53:28.860]  They're going to triple it by the time they're done.
[1:53:28.860 --> 1:53:29.860]  Well, I know.
[1:53:29.860 --> 1:53:36.380]  And if I have to appeal it, if my subdivision appeals it, they can spend millions of dollars
[1:53:36.380 --> 1:53:40.420]  on legal fees and the rate payers have to pay their legal cost.
[1:53:40.420 --> 1:53:41.420]  No, I hear you.
[1:53:41.420 --> 1:53:42.420]  Look, look, look.
[1:53:42.420 --> 1:53:43.580]  This is a huge subject.
[1:53:43.580 --> 1:53:45.180]  This is globalization.
[1:53:45.180 --> 1:53:48.980]  When they set the nukes off or bioattacks and then set the police state up, it's going
[1:53:48.980 --> 1:53:51.140]  to be 100 times worse, sir.
[1:53:51.140 --> 1:53:57.500]  Tap into Google, IMF documents consume Argentina and then that's a headline that'll link to
[1:53:57.500 --> 1:53:58.500]  the documents.
[1:53:58.500 --> 1:54:01.660]  It's all done by design, total, like Leacocas said.
[1:54:01.660 --> 1:54:03.280]  We're being corporately raped.
[1:54:03.280 --> 1:54:04.780]  This is mafia government.
[1:54:04.780 --> 1:54:07.500]  Do you have the clip?
[1:54:07.500 --> 1:54:09.980]  We able to find the clip, Paul?
[1:54:09.980 --> 1:54:13.340]  Can we just play the clip where she talks about him being an agony?
[1:54:13.340 --> 1:54:15.660]  I want to take a few more calls here.
[1:54:15.660 --> 1:54:19.620]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Belton, Texas.
[1:54:19.620 --> 1:54:21.220]  Here on the air, Robert.
[1:54:21.220 --> 1:54:22.220]  Hello?
[1:54:22.220 --> 1:54:23.220]  Yes, sir.
[1:54:23.220 --> 1:54:24.220]  Go ahead.
[1:54:24.220 --> 1:54:25.220]  Yeah.
[1:54:25.220 --> 1:54:28.060]  I just started listening to talk radio.
[1:54:28.060 --> 1:54:29.060]  Yes, sir.
[1:54:29.060 --> 1:54:32.420]  I think you guys are great.
[1:54:32.420 --> 1:54:35.100]  There's about 10 of you that I listened to.
[1:54:35.100 --> 1:54:38.220]  Well, thank you.
[1:54:38.220 --> 1:54:44.180]  The only thing I don't hear is a plan, something I can get behind.
[1:54:44.180 --> 1:54:45.180]  I hear you all.
[1:54:45.180 --> 1:54:46.180]  I could serve.
[1:54:46.180 --> 1:54:47.300]  There's so much crime they're engaged in.
[1:54:47.300 --> 1:54:49.980]  I can't even tell you about 10% of it.
[1:54:49.980 --> 1:54:53.660]  It's just wall-to-wall, every type of evil you can imagine.
[1:54:53.660 --> 1:54:56.300]  Well, I don't.
[1:54:56.300 --> 1:55:00.340]  My plan is trying to warn you and for you to come up with plans, believe me, call me back
[1:55:00.340 --> 1:55:01.820]  next week or during the weekday.
[1:55:01.820 --> 1:55:02.820]  We'll talk more about it.
[1:55:02.820 --> 1:55:03.820]  I understand.
[1:55:03.820 --> 1:55:05.860]  Here's a little clip from KI talking about it.
[1:55:05.860 --> 1:55:06.860]  Here it is.
[1:55:06.860 --> 1:55:15.860]  It's a man with a bald spot and he has duct tape across his mouth, wrapped up.
[1:55:15.860 --> 1:55:19.260]  The police said that he was warned by the FBI.
[1:55:19.260 --> 1:55:23.660]  He was the person from yesterday that they were trying to find.
[1:55:23.660 --> 1:55:26.940]  The fact that there's a body floating in town lake is you don't see that every day
[1:55:26.940 --> 1:55:30.900]  and it's unusual, so it does make us suspicious.
[1:55:30.900 --> 1:55:31.900]  And it goes on.
[1:55:31.900 --> 1:55:32.900]  Okay, well, we'll play more of that.
[1:55:32.900 --> 1:55:33.900]  We'll post that on the website.
[1:55:33.900 --> 1:55:34.900]  A link to that.
[1:55:34.900 --> 1:55:35.900]  Just amazing.
[1:55:35.900 --> 1:55:36.900]  Okay, let's jam in one or two more here.
[1:55:36.900 --> 1:55:39.900]  Let's talk to Gary in California, you're on the air worldwide.
[1:55:39.900 --> 1:55:40.900]  Hi, Alex.
[1:55:40.900 --> 1:55:41.900]  Hi.
[1:55:41.900 --> 1:55:44.100]  I got an answer to your last call as a question.
[1:55:44.100 --> 1:55:45.100]  Yeah.
[1:55:45.100 --> 1:55:46.100]  What do we have to do?
[1:55:46.100 --> 1:55:50.100]  Expose false flag terror and the globalist in game terror storm.
[1:55:50.100 --> 1:55:51.100]  Terror storm.
[1:55:51.100 --> 1:55:55.100]  You got to get it out to the police and military so they know what's happening right now so
[1:55:55.100 --> 1:55:57.140]  they won't pull the martial law stuff in the future.
[1:55:57.140 --> 1:55:58.140]  I agree.
[1:55:58.140 --> 1:55:59.140]  It's life and death.
[1:55:59.140 --> 1:56:00.140]  Believe me, folks.
[1:56:00.140 --> 1:56:01.140]  This isn't a joke.
[1:56:01.140 --> 1:56:02.140]  I realize my life's in danger.
[1:56:02.140 --> 1:56:04.220]  I mean, I realize this isn't a game.
[1:56:04.220 --> 1:56:05.780]  I can't believe it's this bad.
[1:56:05.780 --> 1:56:07.820]  I can't believe they're doing this to our country.
[1:56:07.820 --> 1:56:12.460]  I believe red, white and blue and I know our troops and military and police aren't bad
[1:56:12.460 --> 1:56:17.580]  either but they're being brainwashed and incrementally trained to do this, you know, quote, cave dwellers
[1:56:17.580 --> 1:56:21.020]  and then meanwhile they're running martial law drills against the citizenry.
[1:56:21.020 --> 1:56:22.020]  Hey, Alex.
[1:56:22.020 --> 1:56:23.020]  Yeah.
[1:56:23.020 --> 1:56:24.620]  Do you want a timeline for terror storm and special edition?
[1:56:24.620 --> 1:56:25.620]  Yes.
[1:56:25.620 --> 1:56:26.620]  Did you do the timeline for?
[1:56:26.620 --> 1:56:27.620]  Yes.
[1:56:27.620 --> 1:56:28.620]  In game, yes.
[1:56:28.620 --> 1:56:32.100]  Well, for those that don't know, you did a great bibliography and Curtis said it was
[1:56:32.100 --> 1:56:33.100]  a listener.
[1:56:33.100 --> 1:56:34.100]  I double checked it.
[1:56:34.100 --> 1:56:35.180]  It's a great bibliography.
[1:56:35.180 --> 1:56:39.420]  You did for my film, In Game, where everything we claim is done and you did, well, what's
[1:56:39.420 --> 1:56:40.420]  your name?
[1:56:40.420 --> 1:56:41.420]  I really appreciate your help.
[1:56:41.420 --> 1:56:42.420]  I'm Gary.
[1:56:42.420 --> 1:56:43.420]  You're just awesome.
[1:56:43.420 --> 1:56:44.420]  Yes, sir.
[1:56:44.420 --> 1:56:49.300]  The thing is, Alex, you have to understand, all of the stuff you talk about is out there
[1:56:49.300 --> 1:56:52.820]  has been declassified, large portions of it for about 10, 15 years.
[1:56:52.820 --> 1:56:53.820]  I know.
[1:56:53.820 --> 1:56:54.820]  They want to deny it.
[1:56:54.820 --> 1:56:55.820]  They're just doing willful denial.
[1:56:55.820 --> 1:56:56.820]  Well, yeah, we're so busy.
[1:56:56.820 --> 1:57:00.100]  We make the film that we can't make a bibliography like a book.
[1:57:00.100 --> 1:57:06.100]  We had a fellow do that out of Michigan, a great job for martial law, martial law 911.info.
[1:57:06.100 --> 1:57:09.420]  Every second of the film is documented with links to all of it.
[1:57:09.420 --> 1:57:15.340]  You did that for In Game at WhatIsTheInGame.com, and now you're singing it for TerrorStorm.
[1:57:15.340 --> 1:57:16.660]  I salute you and thank you.
[1:57:16.660 --> 1:57:17.660]  No problem.
[1:57:17.660 --> 1:57:20.940]  Yeah, the videos are free on Google Video, TerrorStorm and In Game.
[1:57:20.940 --> 1:57:25.100]  We want them in high quality DVD, infowars.com, but this isn't about money.
[1:57:25.100 --> 1:57:27.700]  We have no future if we don't fight these people.
[1:57:27.700 --> 1:57:28.860]  Defend America.
[1:57:28.860 --> 1:57:30.700]  Find out who's behind the terrorists.
[1:57:30.700 --> 1:57:32.220]  Find out the Black Ops did it.
[1:57:32.220 --> 1:57:33.220]  They're ruthless.
[1:57:33.220 --> 1:57:34.660]  All right, great job to the crew.
[1:57:34.660 --> 1:57:36.740]  Great job to Trey and Paul.
[1:57:36.740 --> 1:57:39.300]  We'll see you next week and back tomorrow on The Week They Show.
[1:57:39.300 --> 1:57:45.060]  Hi, this is Ted Turbulizard, and I am inviting you to the Great Freedom Rally on the West
