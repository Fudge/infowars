[00:53.320 --> 00:57.120]  saw it all through the 20th century and now in the 21st century it's time to
[00:57.120 --> 01:00.880]  stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this
[01:00.880 --> 01:05.520]  rat maze we should not submit to dehumanization I don't know about you
[01:05.520 --> 01:09.120]  but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world I'm concerned with the
[01:09.120 --> 01:13.400]  structure I'm concerned with the systems of control those that control my life
[01:13.400 --> 01:19.000]  and those that control even more I want freedom that's what I want and that's
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.080]  what you should want it's up to each and every one of us to turn this just some
[01:23.080 --> 01:27.680]  of the three the hatred the envy and yes the insecurities because that is the
[01:27.680 --> 01:33.080]  central mode of control make us feel small so we'll willingly give up our
[01:33.080 --> 01:38.120]  sovereignty our liberty our destiny we have got to realize that we're being
[01:38.120 --> 01:42.980]  conditioned on a mass scale start challenging this corporate slave state

[02:34.720 --> 02:39.880]  and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit well that's it that's all I've
[02:39.880 --> 02:43.360]  got to say it's in your court
[02:46.480 --> 02:53.880]  we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will
[02:53.880 --> 03:01.480]  enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude
[03:01.480 --> 03:09.680]  people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which by any decent standard they
[03:09.680 --> 03:15.360]  ought not to enjoy perhaps you'd better start from the beginning
[03:15.360 --> 03:29.720]  perhaps you're better start from the beginning too many kids are what's
[03:29.720 --> 03:33.920]  making planet worse a lot of these kids come from bad gene pools they don't have

[04:05.240 --> 04:11.200]  spend time in the shadows any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of
[04:11.200 --> 04:15.720]  the devil will join me and I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to say there's

[08:28.400 --> 08:34.800]  Jones your host I have been attempting in vain for quite a long time to actually
[08:34.800 --> 08:39.120]  take a large amount of phone calls but I'm gonna cover some of the news
[08:39.120 --> 08:42.160]  headlines and then give the number out and I will go to your calls throughout
[08:42.160 --> 08:48.280]  this hour at the bottom of the hour our frequent financial news contributor to

[08:52.080 --> 08:55.920]  Kaiser will be popping in working on another financial guest as well the
[08:55.920 --> 09:02.800]  third hour today Jesse Ventura could be on the day or tomorrow I called him this
[09:02.800 --> 09:06.240]  morning obviously you heard him on air Friday say call him again over the
[09:06.240 --> 09:09.920]  weekend that he come on this week and give us his full breakdown on the TSA
[09:09.920 --> 09:13.480]  situation that's coming to a head but I did call him this morning so I could get
[09:13.480 --> 09:18.920]  a call anytime so be today tomorrow you name it so he could be popping in as
[09:18.920 --> 09:23.400]  well but I do want to take your phone calls because obviously a lot is
[09:23.400 --> 09:30.160]  happening in the world and I'm also settling in to not sleeping I actually
[09:30.160 --> 09:35.280]  feel good I guess it's my second wind I didn't really sleep much for whatever
[09:35.280 --> 09:39.720]  reason Wednesday night then in the 27-hour broadcast I slept about three
[09:39.720 --> 09:45.640]  hours on a couch and then I went to East Texas with family and one of my
[09:45.640 --> 09:48.960]  children was throwing up for whatever reason didn't have a fever though and
[09:48.960 --> 09:52.440]  was up much of the night I didn't get much sleep then then the next night my
[09:52.440 --> 09:55.720]  daughter who has teeth coming in at a toothache and was up crying all night
[09:55.720 --> 10:00.520]  something she's never done before while you're camping remember that I'm not
[10:00.520 --> 10:05.080]  complaining that's just funny and then I got back and finally got sleep Sunday
[10:05.080 --> 10:09.200]  night and then last night was on coast to coast a.m. and was so sleepy before I
[10:09.200 --> 10:12.680]  went on the show I drank a bunch of coffee then I couldn't go to bed went to
[10:12.680 --> 10:16.920]  bed at 5 a.m. couldn't sleep children woke up at 6 30 at an hour and a half of
[10:16.920 --> 10:22.120]  sleep and I feel great actually but we'll see what happens we'll see what
[10:22.120 --> 10:27.640]  happens here because this is getting ridiculous I mean if I didn't have
[10:27.640 --> 10:32.640]  raccoon-looking eyes before like Rahm Emanuel or something big black Joker
[10:32.640 --> 10:36.520]  circles around my eyes I'm certainly gonna have them of this continues I mean
[10:36.520 --> 10:41.880]  this is a that is that is a ugly-looking creature right there on your TV screen
[10:41.880 --> 10:50.240]  okay that said Max Kaiser is coming up and joining us let's go ahead now and go
[10:50.240 --> 10:58.480]  over some of the news I have here in my stacks ABC news is running the headline
[10:58.480 --> 11:03.160]  foreign policy experts agree with Ron Paul's foreign policy and say that the
[11:03.160 --> 11:08.840]  military expenditures are bankrupting us and paying for military occupation and
[11:08.840 --> 11:14.480]  and forces and all these different wealthy nations is basically bankrupting
[11:14.480 --> 11:23.160]  our society so we're gonna be going over that report also we are going to talk a
[11:23.160 --> 11:26.200]  little bit more I keep saying I'll talk about it I covered it some last night
[11:26.200 --> 11:29.880]  but I do have some comments I want to make about the Herman Cain situation and
[11:29.880 --> 11:34.320]  this first public accuser who reportedly now a month ago was seen whispering in his
[11:34.320 --> 11:43.400]  ear and hugging on him according to the Sun Times and so we'll be looking at
[11:43.400 --> 11:45.880]  that and breaking that down but but but quite frankly the reason I'm going to
[11:45.880 --> 11:55.520]  talk about Cain is that whether it's true or not Herman Cain should be
[11:55.520 --> 12:01.840]  politically unviable because of his support for the private Federal Reserve
[12:01.840 --> 12:07.280]  his support for a new taxing system on top of what we've got the 9999 it's
[12:07.280 --> 12:14.080]  there's another nine they're not talking about the payroll tax that all
[12:14.080 --> 12:21.360]  employees business owners you name it pay and of course Herman Cain has been
[12:21.360 --> 12:25.600]  caught lying and saying that Ron Paul that's why this stuff may be true
[12:25.600 --> 12:30.480]  because he was with a straight face looked at Ron Paul in the debate a few
[12:30.480 --> 12:35.280]  debates ago and said how dare you say that I called Ron Paul supporter stupid
[12:35.280 --> 12:38.080]  people don't want to audit the Fed stupid you're listening to that internet
[12:38.080 --> 12:40.280]  you shouldn't believe everything you read on the internet and then there was
[12:40.280 --> 12:45.360]  canned applause basically haha he got you that internet Ron Paul looked at him
[12:45.360 --> 12:48.960]  look down on his notes and look back up with that alley looks and we'll look
[12:48.960 --> 12:53.800]  into that now obviously it's in Cain's book and there's all these audio clips
[12:53.800 --> 12:57.760]  of him saying it when he's hosting the Neil Bort's program and all the rest of
[12:57.760 --> 13:03.400]  it so that's what's happening there that's what's happening on that front but
[13:03.400 --> 13:09.600]  I I will later get into that a bit now the the larger issue is that is
[13:09.600 --> 13:15.840]  distracting right now from a war with Iran that will put the economy into an
[13:15.840 --> 13:20.880]  even deeper depression but be a political distraction and political cover
[13:20.880 --> 13:25.120]  for the those globalist puppets that are instituting this right as Europe
[13:25.120 --> 13:31.120]  implodes by design into the New World Order we also have all over the country
[13:31.120 --> 13:33.480]  the last two weeks police announcing they're going to get tough with
[13:33.480 --> 13:36.640]  protesters they're going to shoot you with rubber bullets in the faces there's
[13:36.640 --> 13:39.560]  no videos coming out they're going to tear gas you for no reason they're
[13:39.560 --> 13:45.360]  going to Billy club you have a camera including mainstream media they've gone
[13:45.360 --> 13:49.080]  from the darlings that government said oh here's the park for you let the
[13:49.080 --> 13:55.240]  unions bring you some pizzas here's some porta-potties to go away and that's
[13:55.240 --> 13:58.240]  because they thought this would be part of the Democratic Party reelection
[13:58.240 --> 14:05.160]  campaign 2012 as a way to rebrand the Democrats as anti-establishment that
[14:05.160 --> 14:08.840]  didn't work and so Occupy Wall Street is going to be getting the rubber bullet
[14:08.840 --> 14:12.120]  upside the head their first amendment people are like they're honoring the
[14:12.120 --> 14:17.320]  first amendment what's happening oh acorn is helping George Soros is helping
[14:17.320 --> 14:22.200]  Michael Morris helping Nancy Pelosi says they're great Ben Bernanke says they're
[14:22.200 --> 14:27.640]  wonderful Obama loves them Goldman Sachs is loving them oh they're calling for
[14:27.640 --> 14:31.600]  redistribution of wealth and communism to take the middle-class money and give
[14:31.600 --> 14:37.160]  it to the bankers they tried to get Occupy Wall Street to go along with that
[14:37.160 --> 14:42.280]  first the Democratic Party Foundation operatives no revolution is coming it's
[14:42.280 --> 14:46.160]  important to define this they put out the call months before it starts on this
[14:46.160 --> 14:50.320]  date in early October come out it's the corruption of Wall Street the big banks
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.000]  no longer bunch of people across the political spectrum would show up then
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.880]  the operatives go in and don't let patriots organize anything saying no
[14:57.880 --> 15:05.200]  politics allowed only collectivism and acorns are to help so and you know run
[15:05.200 --> 15:08.480]  in the Fed is out run Ron Paul supporters out don't talk about crony
[15:08.480 --> 15:11.800]  capitalism insider elites using big government to control people that's not
[15:11.800 --> 15:17.160]  allowed so they tried to control it on record now it's admitted that they tried
[15:17.160 --> 15:20.600]  to take control of it and did to a certain extent but it just didn't work so
[15:20.600 --> 15:27.560]  now it's time for clobbering and again I'm against the attack on the First
[15:27.560 --> 15:32.640]  Amendment and these police really are shameful across the country people are
[15:32.640 --> 15:37.040]  like wow they're they're telling people come on out the police are or are saying
[15:37.040 --> 15:42.040]  they're gonna be there to provide you with security it's a friendly all over
[15:42.040 --> 15:45.120]  the country the word went out from the feds to their federalized local police
[15:45.120 --> 15:48.640]  departments that are much nothing more than little prostitutes of the of the
[15:48.640 --> 15:54.080]  federal globalist Gestapo they were you are honored we appreciate you so
[15:54.080 --> 15:57.720]  everybody who was scared to go out and protest the last decade watching
[15:57.720 --> 16:01.720]  families with babies being pepper sprayed Billy Club for no reason cop
[16:01.720 --> 16:05.640]  spraying pepper spray in Portland other areas point blank in baby's faces and
[16:05.640 --> 16:10.080]  laughing at a mama don't like it Billy Club in the teeth because the message
[16:10.080 --> 16:14.680]  was you don't come out and demonstrate you understand us you shut up you scum
[16:14.680 --> 16:19.000]  you have no First Amendment and they hired Delta Force all the major papers
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.360]  were reported in Seattle in 99 was there running airplanes full of anarchist
[16:24.360 --> 16:30.000]  communists that they flew in and they were it's all my film the takeover police
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.280]  admitting it they were ordered to let them loot then they were housed in a
[16:33.280 --> 16:36.800]  government building and protected by police this is how they do it but now
[16:36.800 --> 16:42.200]  it's like you're our friends Obama likes you you want higher taxes to pay it in
[16:42.200 --> 16:49.400]  banker bailouts austere come on come on you love the October Revolution come on
[16:49.400 --> 16:54.240]  the mega banks that funded marks and Ingalls and then and then linen and
[16:54.240 --> 16:59.440]  then Stalin love you here's your communist armband oh you're not gonna do
[16:59.440 --> 17:04.200]  what we say officers open fire and the cops are lucky better believe we're
[17:04.200 --> 17:07.240]  ready because they've been taught the cops have been taught they're a bunch of
[17:07.240 --> 17:12.760]  communists because the other globalist have basically spoken for them so it's
[17:12.760 --> 17:16.480]  it's a left-right paradigm example where a lot of these cops I've heard them on
[17:16.480 --> 17:20.720]  talk radio run into them on the street they're like I'm gonna can't wait to
[17:20.720 --> 17:24.880]  crack the heads of these dirty commies because you they're listening to
[17:24.880 --> 17:28.240]  conservative talk radio that's telling them part of the truth that yeah they're
[17:28.240 --> 17:31.880]  collectivist they're anti-gun a lot of cops are actually conservative but the

[24:39.680 --> 25:07.120]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[25:07.120 --> 25:13.040]  Okay folks I was a little bit late getting back on air there I apologize for that
[25:13.040 --> 25:19.560]  because Governor Ventura called me right as I was going into the live
[25:19.560 --> 25:25.960]  segment he is going to give us an exclusive breakdown on what's happened
[25:25.960 --> 25:30.400]  since the ruling on Friday we need to move Max Kaiser if he can do it to one
[25:30.400 --> 25:33.840]  he got always on a 1230 I really need Kaiser on but I asked Ventura I said you
[25:33.840 --> 25:36.720]  want 30 minutes per hour and he said he'd do an hour I'm gonna call him back
[25:36.720 --> 25:40.160]  during the break because I'd be still talking when I hung up because the liner
[25:40.160 --> 25:43.680]  was over and I do want to go to your phone call so you look I mentioned some
[25:43.680 --> 25:48.720]  of the news the Iran situation all of it we're gonna be getting to it I want to
[25:48.720 --> 25:59.640]  hear from you 800-259-9231-1800-259-9231 let me ask you this question I mean now
[25:59.640 --> 26:03.320]  everything we've talked about is unfolding it's all happening what do you
[26:03.320 --> 26:07.360]  think's coming next in this whole New World Order situation I mean if it's
[26:07.360 --> 26:12.360]  already gotten this crazy what's coming next criminals took over the government
[26:12.360 --> 26:18.360]  they robbed all of the investments mega banks are openly taking houses they
[26:18.360 --> 26:23.480]  don't even own that aren't even in debt totally paid for homes that's all over
[26:23.480 --> 26:28.640]  the news no one gets in trouble they're stealing the veterans pension funds
[26:28.640 --> 26:32.240]  they're announcing they're getting ready to cut the veterans pensions what's
[26:32.240 --> 26:38.480]  left of them it's just a totally criminal government it's not our government
[26:38.480 --> 26:48.560]  what do you think about all of this and where it's going 800-259-9231-1800-259-9231
[26:48.560 --> 26:56.800]  Jesse Ventura coming up you heard him right after he'd been at that press
[26:56.800 --> 26:59.680]  conference and of course the media distorted what he was saying he was
[26:59.680 --> 27:02.800]  saying basically what do I have to do either leave the country or I have to
[27:02.800 --> 27:07.920]  become president to stop this and so he was and so now they're trying to spin
[27:07.920 --> 27:13.360]  it I'm just talking to him that he's unpatriotic what's the Teddy Roosevelt
[27:13.360 --> 27:17.080]  quote about love your country fear and hate your government what did Thomas
[27:17.080 --> 27:20.680]  Jefferson say that guys pull me a bunch of quotes about loving your country but
[27:20.680 --> 27:25.560]  hating your government there's the old Irish saying that patriotism is loving
[27:25.560 --> 27:30.000]  your country but trying to keep your government in line basically it's
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.480]  common sense our country's been hijacked by criminal by criminal elements and
[27:35.480 --> 27:39.640]  and and they're also trying to spin this Ventura was telling me well he's got a
[27:39.640 --> 27:43.840]  bunch of breaking news in fact Jeremy I sent you articles a few days ago I don't
[27:43.840 --> 27:46.840]  know if you had him in the stacks but if you type in Jesse Ventura love it or
[27:46.840 --> 27:52.680]  leave it in into Google news and click news or start page whatever you want to
[27:52.680 --> 27:57.200]  go to it'll bring up a bunch of articles with headlines love it or leave it like
[27:57.200 --> 28:00.920]  in America love the street lights listening to you by the way homeland
[28:00.920 --> 28:04.720]  security is on deputy director saying it's great no one will know they're
[28:04.720 --> 28:10.520]  being listened to and there there's some of the articles yeah print those for me
[28:10.520 --> 28:19.360]  thanks or bring those up to him they are putting out this idea that as a citizen
[28:19.360 --> 28:23.200]  you just do whatever government and special interests say and you don't
[28:23.200 --> 28:28.360]  have any right to any opinion or anything and that is unpatriotic and if
[28:28.360 --> 28:32.080]  you don't like the TSA sticking their hands down your pants groping your
[28:32.080 --> 28:35.000]  wife your children putting you in a microwave oven if you don't like them
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.600]  having the borders wide open and the government being caught dealing drugs
[28:37.600 --> 28:41.760]  and shipping guns out of the country then leave it that become a viewer in
[28:41.760 --> 28:46.000]  Mexico and don't like the 60,000 dead keep saying 40 it's 60,000 in three
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.560]  years plus no I guess it's like leave Mexico then I guess that's what the
[28:49.560 --> 28:53.680]  illegals are doing but you know the point here is that you can't just leave
[28:53.680 --> 29:00.240]  it you got to fix it in fact a most sociologist and political scientist have
[29:00.240 --> 29:04.680]  shown in common sense proves that if you just look at it you got 30 plus million
[29:04.680 --> 29:08.240]  people from Mexico here and there's a hundred million there and they in Mexico
[29:08.240 --> 29:13.080]  use the US as a steam valve imagine if those 30 million people have been made
[29:13.080 --> 29:16.440]  to stay there and fight they would have overthrown that corrupt oligarchy they
[29:16.440 --> 29:21.840]  got down there and you know it's the same thing here I don't want Jesse Ventura
[29:21.840 --> 29:25.160]  to leave the United States I don't want anybody to I've talked a lot about this
[29:25.160 --> 29:28.760]  I'm going down with the ship because there's nowhere else to run what runs
[29:28.760 --> 29:32.280]  somewhere in five years later the New World Order gets there I mean I've been
[29:32.280 --> 29:34.240]  to other parts of the world I've talked to people that have lived in other parts
[29:34.240 --> 29:38.240]  of the world it's bad you know Mike Adams went down to South America and had
[29:38.240 --> 29:42.440]  to punch out because you people were threatening the extorting or kidnap or

[35:11.080 --> 35:16.800]  over the US basically and they all suddenly cancelled when he goes on

[35:26.280 --> 35:32.680]  enough to know that like he's trying to get publicity I have witnessed Ventura
[35:32.680 --> 35:37.680]  in a controlled rage over this I have been in a controlled rage I am sick of
[35:37.680 --> 35:43.280]  it and when Miss USA cried about the Dallas Airport literally going in her
[35:43.280 --> 35:48.440]  panties and touching her genitals and she cried they they said oh she just wants
[35:48.440 --> 35:51.640]  attention oh I guess when you run into highway check points down they want to
[35:51.640 --> 35:56.000]  search your car you shouldn't get upset you shouldn't get upset about federally
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  funded blood draws all over the country our homeland security announced that we
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.680]  want to start setting up forced quarantines and roundups you shouldn't
[36:03.680 --> 36:09.160]  get upset about taxes so high it's bankrupting many people or naftan got
[36:09.160 --> 36:13.840]  deindustrializing the country now it's weird to be involved it's weird to be
[36:13.840 --> 36:21.080]  upset and they almost ended Ventura show because of the budget issues of him
[36:21.080 --> 36:26.000]  saying he wouldn't fly and they couldn't afford to have private jets so he
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.600]  drives around his own personal RV all over the country and I mean I just you
[36:30.600 --> 36:36.000]  know being behind the scenes and watching them how they turn this around and
[36:36.000 --> 36:42.600]  how they operate and how these whore talk show host think it's cute to to see
[36:42.600 --> 36:48.040]  total classical police state in our face and make excuses for it I mean I got an
[36:48.040 --> 36:53.520]  article up at info wars.com headline DHS official you never know when street
[36:53.520 --> 36:57.120]  lights are listening to you and they're making announcements yes no one knows when
[36:57.120 --> 37:01.800]  we're surveilling him I mean directly out of 1984 federal street lights listening
[37:01.800 --> 37:09.320]  to us without warrants I mean it's beyond 1984 and what's happened is a lot
[37:09.320 --> 37:14.160]  of these yuppies and sellouts and people who've bought it a system they will make
[37:14.160 --> 37:19.440]  whatever excuses they need once you buy into corruption once you buy into big
[37:19.440 --> 37:24.120]  brother you can't admit as it gets worse and worse that you were wrong no
[37:24.120 --> 37:32.080]  that's not what these cowards do instead they just sit there and make excuses for
[37:32.080 --> 37:36.600]  no matter what happens and that's the thing about tyranny in every society
[37:36.600 --> 37:41.200]  if you study the sociology the psychology the certain groups that go along
[37:41.200 --> 37:46.280]  with the system will then put up with anything whether it was crazy Roman
[37:46.280 --> 37:52.400]  emperors of the Aztecs it doesn't matter and there's always a ruling class that
[37:52.400 --> 37:56.880]  is about the exercise of power people build up the Japanese and certainly was
[37:56.880 --> 38:01.040]  a gentile culture compared to many admirable in many ways I'm not putting
[38:01.040 --> 38:05.640]  down the culture but it's on record you can pull this up that the Japanese
[38:05.640 --> 38:13.080]  samurai would routinely test a new blade on a villager and these are groveling
[38:13.080 --> 38:19.120]  stooping slaves who bowing and doing whatever they're told working long
[38:19.120 --> 38:24.040]  hours 12 hours or more out in the rice paddies and they would just you know to
[38:24.040 --> 38:29.160]  maintain discipline and exercise power they would go out and find somebody that
[38:29.160 --> 38:33.520]  looked at them wrong and chop them up with a new blade you can look that up
[38:33.520 --> 38:39.120]  type and samurai had right to kill for no reason it'll come up and every
[38:39.120 --> 38:43.000]  culture did that you there naive and ancient France going back a thousand
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.000]  years ago you there you looked at me wrong time up one of the favorite ways
[38:48.000 --> 38:54.240]  was just to tie them up against a tree and just slit the throat it's about the
[38:54.240 --> 39:03.720]  exercise of power of all the cultures it was the Anglo-Saxon culture that
[39:03.720 --> 39:08.560]  developed the Magna Carta that took the common law to the next level that chopped
[39:08.560 --> 39:13.120]  the heads off of kings and demanded basic liberties that grew was it perfect
[39:13.120 --> 39:18.080]  the system always attacks it but it grew like an acorn into what we have today
[39:18.080 --> 39:22.760]  the first society where commoners could own private property in no other
[39:22.760 --> 39:31.480]  culture could you a non-royal and in all of their sub lords and legates you
[39:31.480 --> 39:36.520]  could not own private property and the elites latched on over a hundred years
[39:36.520 --> 39:40.960]  ago to eugenics because they already believe they were different species in
[39:40.960 --> 39:44.960]  the general public that's why they called the poor people every culture the
[39:44.960 --> 39:49.360]  little people because under feudalism practiced in every culture the elite
[39:49.360 --> 39:54.600]  sit back in giant armored palaces with a royal guard and the slaves are kept out
[39:54.600 --> 39:58.680]  there on purpose and their food is confiscated to a point of where they're
[39:58.680 --> 40:02.360]  almost starving to death and I've had Marines and others described fighting
[40:02.360 --> 40:08.040]  Iraqis and after 15 years of sanctions no medicine no nothing they said that
[40:08.040 --> 40:12.640]  they had no energy most the country isn't even getting enough food and so the
[40:12.640 --> 40:16.560]  multiple Marines have described how you're fighting an American black white
[40:16.560 --> 40:21.000]  it whatever they've got muscles on them they're they're well fed these are
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.760]  people malnourished millions of which starved to death over that 15 years they
[40:25.760 --> 40:29.760]  estimate they went from 25 million to about 21 million total war famine you
[40:29.760 --> 40:33.120]  name it and you can just shove the Iraqis aside because they've been starved
[40:33.120 --> 40:39.480]  to death one good line they have in silence of the lambs I don't recommend
[40:39.480 --> 40:43.920]  if it's a family movie but where the evil you know psycho killer who's a
[40:43.920 --> 40:49.080]  genius is talking to the FBI serial killer expert and he says oh I see you
[40:49.080 --> 40:53.320]  Clarice I see your cheekbones I see your bones I see you know would you come
[40:53.320 --> 40:56.880]  from sharecroppers is this your background if she starts crying because
[40:56.880 --> 41:01.520]  he knows who she is by looking at her body and see that's the elite just kind
[41:01.520 --> 41:06.400]  of throwing in your face how they operate what they do as they ride by on
[41:06.400 --> 41:09.320]  big war horses and everybody's like starving to death bury in their kid
[41:09.320 --> 41:13.600]  and if they caught you taking one rabbit in ancient England even your family
[41:13.600 --> 41:16.920]  starving to death in the winter one rabbit you're kept on this tiny tract
[41:16.920 --> 41:19.680]  of land and you're in there freezing all winter and you get a rabbit to feed
[41:19.680 --> 41:23.840]  your children and the lords bust in the sheriff bust in and pulls out a sword
[41:23.840 --> 41:29.280]  and goes get him outside walk him outside and run him through you don't take
[41:29.280 --> 41:36.960]  our property I mean that's that's how every society has operated and that's
[41:36.960 --> 41:43.160]  the feudal system that we're now going under in this country that's what's
[41:43.160 --> 41:48.000]  happening to our society and what the elites have done to the human race all
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.360]  the strong smart people they've killed out of domination the truth is eugenics
[41:53.360 --> 41:56.760]  is not trying to build up society it's trying to wreck all that's good in us
[41:56.760 --> 42:01.880]  so these parasites can dominate us I'm gonna go to your phone calls but it
[42:01.880 --> 42:06.040]  just makes my head spin all the things that are happening oh look magic
[42:06.040 --> 42:11.560]  Johnson still beating HIV 20 years later oh but their average person gets it
[42:11.560 --> 42:14.640]  and they put you on the drugs and you're dead in about three years because the
[42:14.640 --> 42:21.600]  drugs are what kill you HIV is a bio weapon a race specific bio weapon very
[42:21.600 --> 42:26.760]  hard to kill Caucasians with it let's see he got behind the whole HIV money
[42:26.760 --> 42:30.280]  raising movement and he even slipped up an interview remember over a decade ago
[42:30.280 --> 42:34.040]  and said yeah I've been given the cure and boy then they clamped down on him
[42:34.040 --> 42:44.520]  fast yeah I've been given the cure I've been given the cure and he sure was but
[42:44.520 --> 42:48.720]  only cuz he kept his mouth shut as for those hundreds of millions of Africans
[42:48.720 --> 42:52.280]  that have died from it or related to it no you're not gonna get the cure you're
[42:52.280 --> 42:56.520]  gonna go in a hole in the ground you got that death is what you get because
[42:56.520 --> 42:59.000]  it's trendy
[42:59.520 --> 43:07.160]  continuing here appeals court upholds Obama health care law so unconstitutional
[43:07.160 --> 43:10.480]  make your head spin but these courts are now bought and paid for a
[43:10.480 --> 43:15.920]  conservative leaning panel a federal pellet judges is upholding President

[43:18.960 --> 43:24.040]  Court fight oh conservatives because it was written by the insurance companies

[43:27.960 --> 43:31.160]  trendy you know it's fun can't let the left and right wake up the fact that
[43:31.160 --> 43:36.680]  it's a scam so just oh the US Court of Appeals for the district of Columbia
[43:36.680 --> 43:40.280]  issued a split decision Tuesday upholding the law the court agreed to

[46:33.560 --> 46:38.160]  dominant theme in the 1949 dystopian novel that depicted a salutary and state
[46:38.160 --> 46:42.200]  under which the population has kept under constant surveillance but see I'm
[46:42.200 --> 46:50.600]  getting to realize here we were mentally ill I was bad you were bad 1984 is a book

[48:24.840 --> 48:28.040]  I'm hearing emergency alert system taking over every hour or so I heard it
[48:28.040 --> 48:31.920]  last night and this morning taking over oh they're they're really getting ready
[48:31.920 --> 48:38.080]  for the freedom Jerry in Texas then Dean Hector Barbara Danny and others go
[48:38.080 --> 48:43.800]  ahead Jerry you're on the year I want to poke at the first I just want to say
[48:43.800 --> 48:47.080]  I really respect what you're doing I don't think people realize the amount
[48:47.080 --> 48:51.200]  of hostility and indifference you're met with when you try and spread the truth
[48:51.200 --> 48:55.640]  it just goes to show you know how brainwash the general populace is right
[48:55.640 --> 49:00.880]  now but I wanted to ask I'm not real sure how much you know about this but
[49:00.880 --> 49:06.800]  these smart meters for those people in Texas trying to continue to grow the
[49:06.800 --> 49:13.400]  cure you know how much will this affect on us you know your small-scale you know
[49:13.400 --> 49:20.360]  indoor farmers are you talking about well no no sure they admit that the smart
[49:20.360 --> 49:26.000]  meters can detect the wattage usage with an algorithm precisely if you've got a
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.400]  marijuana grow light and they also do SWAT team people when they're using too
[49:30.400 --> 49:32.960]  much power they use that as the evidence it can even tell what you're
[49:32.960 --> 49:39.560]  watching on television off of the system that I mean that was mainstream news two
[49:39.560 --> 49:44.120]  days ago because it can tell because a TV uses power depending on the spectrum
[49:44.120 --> 49:47.440]  of the beam it's firing so they can even decode that and tell what you're
[49:47.440 --> 49:52.120]  watching and they admit smart meters access your house 10,000 times a day
[49:52.120 --> 49:57.040]  tracking everything you're doing all the new appliances are having tracker chips
[49:57.040 --> 50:01.000]  built into them with data over power lines so even if you don't have it the
[50:01.000 --> 50:07.800]  power lines come in and the fluorescent lights are now flicker rate code key
[50:07.800 --> 50:11.720]  accessors to take control of your computers and all the new computers are

[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.600]  Let's go to Dean in New York then Barbara

[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.360]  Let's go to Dean. Do you you're on the air welcome?
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.080]  Oh, thanks, Alex. How are you?
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:47.880]  I'm a member. I watch your DVDs. He kind of woke me up and I called in mostly to address the
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.480]  Jesse Ventura could see up the governor
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:57.320]  But governor treated this way not only by TSA, but also by the court system
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:02.240]  I just I just have to say something okay, and it's quite simple Alex
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.120]  Under the 14th amendment
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:10.080]  If you are a US citizen, this is gonna be hard for a lot of people to accept
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.540]  But it's a truth and like you said research research research it check it out
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:22.720]  Under 14th amendment if you claim that you're a US citizen, you no longer have rights under the Constitution privileges bill rights are gone
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:28.160]  It's gone. Okay, so Jesse is a citizen you're a citizen because we're all citizens
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:34.400]  You can just kiss the Constitution the bill rights, but it doesn't apply to us anymore. Okay, it's just that simple
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.680]  Sad fact, but it is a truth
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:42.720]  now there's a someone that you probably should have to explore this issue further because this is like a
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:47.360]  This is very explosive information, and I almost had a think to myself
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:53.720]  Chiefs I go on a medium like the Alex Jones show reaching millions of people with this information
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.800]  But I felt compelled to because I own an obligation
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:03.120]  Basically to you and your organization for what you've done to wake me up. There's a man called LB Bork
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:10.240]  He wrote a book. He's called the Red Amendment tell Jesse to get a copy of that book called the Red Amendment by LB Bork
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.160]  Okay, and he'll explain to you because you don't have to believe me
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.800]  You do your research
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:22.520]  He'll explain to you how when you take US citizenship how they trick us they fool us
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:25.440]  It's similar like when you were going across the border just to be clear
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.760]  Before you were a state citizen
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:33.840]  They were a confederation that created the federal government our senators were sent to Washington. They were elected by the legislature
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.360]  They were creatures of the States
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.440]  They didn't want to actually make black people
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:45.340]  You know free men so instead they made them wards of the District of Columbia, and yes, that's all true
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:50.000]  They made all of us war. No, I know sir. I know I know sir
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.560]  I'm not telling you what they said they were doing with the creation of that amendment the reason
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.640]  They said they created that amendment and yes, that's what it did to everyone
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.200]  I've been aware of that for 16 years, and I'm glad you called it and brought that up
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:08.720]  It is true. Let's go ahead and take another call here. Let's talk to Hector in Texas Hector. You're on the air
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.680]  Yeah, I wanted to ask a question about Occupy Wall Street
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.760]  You mentioned that they're gonna clamp down on it
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:20.080]  and I wanted to know if they're going if that action is gonna backfire on them and I mean
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:26.920]  I went last Friday to knock up Occupy Houston, and I noticed the overwhelming majority of people there are you know
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.160]  Democrats and they blame capitalism and stuff like that
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:37.000]  But there's reasonable people also there who you know want to talk about re-intending class ego act and really know what it is
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:44.560]  The problem we're having so I was also putting a call out there to the you know info words to at least try to educate people go to the
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.040]  Occupy movement and try to equip it. Oh, this is a golden opportunity
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:57.800]  To reach people that are politically waking up every person you wake up is a devastating blow against the globalist in the feathers
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:04.120]  Get in there people that want to get rid of the the the abolition of the grass of the glass teagle act and bring it back
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:09.960]  To stop these megabanks engaging in all this fraud. We've got to be in there talking to these groups
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:17.060]  That's why I traveled around and went to the fellow reserve locations. Yeah, I'm also
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:24.280]  Wondering what's going on with the the federal reserve protest. I haven't heard any anything from you any update
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:29.520]  I know about a week or two into it people were still up there, and we actually interviewed some of them on the nightly news
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.080]  And I don't think there's anybody up there now
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:37.960]  But it got a lot of attention on the fellow reserve and really scared the system and there's protest off and on at fellow reserves everywhere
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:42.280]  So great job everybody out there. All right, we're gonna get governor Jesse Ventura on the line
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:48.120]  The system wants to misrepresent his case and what's happened to him so they can violate all of our rights
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:53.000]  This is a watershed event. Jesse Ventura is like Rosa Parks, ladies and gentlemen
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:58.640]  He's had his civil rights violated and they're trying to demonize him in the horror media stay with us
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:06.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:14.040]  Could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company

[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:14.720]  He's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:26.640]  If you just joined us, I have likened Jesse Ventura to Rosa Parks
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.920]  I've likened miss
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:36.880]  USA who went to the Dallas airport and they went in her panties and and touched her genitals
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.640]  She broke down and cried and then they made fun of her
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:46.240]  They had to settle with a woman in Amarillo where they pulled her blouse off and made comments about her breast. They put
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:52.080]  Notes in people's bags saying hey, I'd like to basically have sex with you
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.720]  Hey, you know get your freak on girl
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.920]  I've had TSA make fun of me and make little snide comments
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:05.200]  I've watched Jesse Ventura in Atlanta where they went up between his legs Ron Paul says the same thing to him
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.760]  He's a medical doctor. I've had medical exams
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:14.400]  It's and quite frankly, it's it's disturbing even when it's your doctor and you're like a cow. They're checking
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.960]  To have them, you know check for hernias and things and and and do what they do and
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.360]  Last year we had airline pilots
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.200]  Who said that's it our union. We're gonna boycott. We're not gonna fly
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:34.560]  They reported that former combat pilots would have to go home and would throw up in their parking lots in some cases
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.040]  after they were groped
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:42.760]  Because you know, they say get tough take it get tough. This is about humiliating people
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:45.800]  This is about getting in your space and I've watched governor Ventura
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.640]  Well, they laughed and giggled said it's the governor and you know
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:54.680]  Basically wanted autographs and stuff in Atlanta as he said this country's like East Germany now
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.680]  This is why I go to Mexico part of the year and and it was all a big joke to them
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:03.600]  It's all very funny TSA two weeks ago when I was flying out of Vegas for meeting with governor Ventura
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:10.080]  They you know the guy said to me. He said I have administrative rights. You basically don't have rights
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:17.280]  And now the TSA is announcing checkpoints in America and I want governor Ventura to continue to elaborate on this martial law situation
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.280]  his own words but now
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:26.960]  He's got breaking news today. He's now learned exactly what went down and and and how the judge sat on it
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:30.240]  For a certain period so it couldn't even go to the court of appeals
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:37.160]  Even if he wanted to go to the star chamber now notice under this federal law that gives the TSA all this martial law power
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:41.480]  You don't get a jury trial now. It goes right to the court of appeals
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.720]  So this is a new system of government. He got the star chamber
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:52.960]  Super Congress now that originates the spending bills all of this centralization of power is happening and he's gonna cover
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:58.760]  The waterfront here with us a there's been a national media blackout be when he does local news
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.680]  He's gonna tell you what happens to him
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:03.680]  They misconstrue what he says take it out of context
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.280]  It's incredible. So he's got a whole raft of things we'll cover in the next hour
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:14.040]  And we will open the phones up specifically for people that have a question for Jesse Ventura as well
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.680]  But governor chin up. We appreciate you taking action
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.160]  We appreciate your boycotting the airlines and taking a stand for everybody
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:24.320]  But Rosa Parks was being made to sit at the back of the bus
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:30.680]  Imagine if they were saying well, we don't we're gonna grab your brass and stick our hands down your pants and put you in a
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.800]  Microwave oven. This is far more than that
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:39.040]  This is a civil rights issue of our fourth amendment of the 10th amendment states rights
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.680]  I mean you're a governor. I want you to speak to that governor. You've got the floor here. Tell us what's happening
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:49.780]  Well, thank you first of all, it seems I'm running into a brick wall with the media
[01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:58.620]  Mainstream media won't discuss the case. They don't think it's relevant at all. In fact, I was due to do CNN yesterday
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:04.660]  And I was bumped because of course the big trial verdict was coming down in the Michael Jackson case
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:12.100]  You know and so that has more importance than I said to the person via second person to CNN
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:17.580]  I said, well, I completely understand after all mine's simply a constitutional issue
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.580]  Why would that take
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:25.400]  Preference over, you know, Michael Jackson's verdict on his drug overdose
[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:29.540]  You know, but that's that's our pop culture media
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:39.380]  locally I did a radio show yesterday where the local guy Williams on WCCO TV or radio in Minnesota
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:42.940]  Equated me to being Kim Kardashian
[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:47.620]  And then I was doing all this simply for publicity for my television show
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:55.420]  This entire court case incredible, you know, I guess my children have never flown and my wife hasn't flown in nine years
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:59.620]  Just because of the searching not not much less the groping now
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:02.580]  I guess we never get to fly anywhere and visit places
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:09.540]  Because we want publicity as well. I don't know, you know, but that that's what I'm going up in excuse my voice
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:12.040]  Alex I'm battling a bit of a source road, but uh
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:16.960]  That's what I'm going up against in the media. You're really my only outlet right now
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:22.640]  I you know, I laughingly kidded you about it last week, but it's it's actually come true that uh, I
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:29.640]  Think I'm going on tomorrow with Judge Napolitano on Fox. He's one of the decent guys out there
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.960]  You know, and he's gonna have me on tomorrow
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:37.160]  And I'm sure the judge will want to talk about this and we'll get his opinion because he's a legitimate judge
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.200]  Or was before he took his TV show, you know
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:43.760]  So uh, we'll get his opinion on what just went down on it
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:49.840]  But other than Judge Napolitano and you I really have no media at all because they're avoiding this
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:53.720]  Like the plague because I have to believe they're part of it, too
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:58.920]  Well, it's the same media that told us Iraq had WMD's governor
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:05.520]  Yeah, exactly. It's the same media that is wide to us constantly the same media that you know
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:11.240]  Uh, takes our news and puts it to to political whatever way it needs to go
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:16.200]  It's the same media that won't take pictures of our dead bodies coming home
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:22.040]  But they will happily show you multiple pictures of more market coffee getting shot in the head
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:29.320]  But they won't show any of our troops that come home and body bags or American flags on the caskets because
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.440]  Naturally
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:38.240]  There's a place that we're paying also for these wars. There is now now you dropped a bombshell on me
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.240]  This is this is newsworthy
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.720]  You've had time to flesh this out with your lawyer now
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:53.120]  Specifically talk about the setup talk about what the judge did you explained to me earlier how she sat on this because I was
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:58.160]  Gov even if it's a star chamber go ahead and still take it to the star chamber and say okay
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.760]  Let's see what the star chamber is going to do and you said no, I can't tell fucks
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:07.920]  Well, because apparently there's a statute of limitations that when you file the case
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:12.000]  You have 60 days in which to take it to the court of appeals
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:19.320]  Well that I filed the case last January and the judge didn't even rule on it till a week or so ago
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:27.800]  So my statute of limitations my attorney took explained it best to me. It's a catch 22 and
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.080]  So this is how they're avoiding
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.240]  Anyone going and having a jury trial what they're telling and I'm speaking to all your listeners Alex
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.840]  What they're telling you is this that you as citizens?
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:49.760]  Cannot perform like the elitist that they are that you are not capable of making a constitutional decision
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:57.040]  So therefore they will not let any constitutional decision go to a jury. I
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.840]  Cannot have a jury trial
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.360]  They're not allowing me
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:07.680]  They threw me out of court and they did it in in a non-timely fashion
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:14.440]  They waited 10 months so that my 60 days after filing to go to the court of appeals
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:17.720]  Would then expire as I understand it
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:24.440]  You know while I'm waiting for her to do the decision now if your listeners want a voice
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.160]  Opinion about judge Nelson feel free to do so. It's judge Nelson in the St. Paul
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:38.120]  Uh district of the federal court. He's the same woman that initially did the same judge that handled the national football league
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.880]  The first one to make a ruling on it
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:47.200]  So, you know, if they want to email her call it right? I'm actually Alex
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:52.680]  You know, I've gone down four times now with the picket Wall Street people in Minneapolis
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:59.160]  No, and but I'm gonna switch I'm not going down there anymore in my spare time now
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:05.480]  I'm going to go over to the St. Paul federal courts building and I'm gonna walk by myself with my own sign
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:10.680]  And my sign is going to say I could get equal treatment in Cuba
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:18.640]  Well, it's true and you know because I feel that way I feel that if I were in Cuba
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.640]  I couldn't be treated any worse
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:27.880]  Than what I'm being treated here in not being allowed to go in front of a tree of my peers of
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:32.920]  Citizens because that's all I am now. I am Jesse Ventura citizen
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:39.720]  And I can't go in front of a tree of my peers and have them decide
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:44.400]  Whether my constitutional bill of rights for the amendment is being violated
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:47.480]  Because the government won't let me
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.920]  Now that's oppression
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.920]  That is not freedom
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:57.680]  That is not our founding fathers. I couldn't imagine what they would think about this decision
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:04.920]  Well, you're right and now they're announcing hey, we've been using on start listen to you without warrants
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:09.440]  Hey, those smart meters they can track what you're watching on television that that's mainstream
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.760]  What about the Viper teams now in Tennessee?
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:21.120]  I just thought on the internet the TSA Viper teams Tennessee just passed at the state of Tennessee apparently
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:28.320]  Where these TSA people are going to be out on the highways now? Yeah, they're codifying and they're using the old
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:33.640]  They're using you know the old busway or the old truckway in spots that you know those places
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.640]  They always used to weigh the trucks
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:39.760]  Yeah, they're using those those are going to be the new operational things
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:45.240]  Where the TSA is going to operate so get ready people if you sit back
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:53.640]  Oh, well, it's just us airport people. It's just those people that fly that are going to be stepped on by this TSA
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:58.080]  Gestapo type living that they're putting upon us
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.640]  Well, it's not now. It's going to the highways
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:06.960]  Now they're now don't be surprised if you get pulled over and they said they're gonna have
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:15.240]  Sniffing dogs out there too. Oh, they've it at all over the Texas coast hundreds of miles from the border
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:18.680]  You take any little ferry over they search your whole car pull you out
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:22.240]  But now as you said all over the US in the middle of the country
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:27.520]  Sheen on the news they pull families out and now they say they're gonna start groping
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.000]  They've got federal grants
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.800]  Where they start taking blood at checkpoints now they now admit Kathleen civilians admits they're gonna merge
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:41.960]  The the Department of Health and Human Services with Homeland Security and do forced inoculations gov
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.080]  That's what this is really all about
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:46.760]  You know used to well
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:54.000]  I'm gonna keep it at my level Alex simply that they did the fact is that we I have to fight it at this level
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:20:01.080]  The fact that they will not allow me to to take my freedom into a courtroom
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:08.680]  And to to have a ruling on my fourth amendment of reasonable search and seizure and that's why I'm sticking with mine
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:15.680]  I'm you know, I got a focus on what I can focus on and what directly affects me the most and what I can do about it
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:20.920]  So that's all I'm gonna focus on I can't get into the inoculations and all that type of stuff
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:25.600]  Although it wouldn't surprise me because as I said, let me clear up a few things
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.560]  You know that the press has been miscoating me
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:36.000]  Saying how I'm going to give up my US citizenship. I never once stated that I simply stated
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:43.080]  I was going to apply for Mexican citizenship my wife and I over the fact that we live half the year down there anyway
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.800]  I might as well have dual citizenship
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:54.160]  And yet the media has twisted it meaning but I did absolutely say that I will never stand for the national anthem again
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:58.880]  And then if I do I will take the pose of Tommy Smith and John Carlos
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:06.960]  The two Olympians and 68 if you were old enough who shocked the world when they won Golden Bronze and
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:13.440]  Stood up with the fist a closed fist and with a black glove in the air and bowed their heads in shame
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:18.880]  That they were winning a gold medal for a country that wouldn't even give them their civil rights
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.600]  And that's kind of how I feel
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:28.280]  Right now. I live in a country that won't even give me my rights my constitutional rights
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:33.000]  Well, I bow my head in shame and raise a black fist into the air
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:40.200]  Well, it will certainly get their attention and I think this is breaking news here that
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.440]  that
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:47.040]  Because I searched and searched and finally found one person who put your whole
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:53.440]  Speech on the internet of the the Associated Press and others edited it and then when I talked to you
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.600]  You weren't saying I'm giving up my US citizenship
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:59.680]  you were saying that well, I'll just try to get dual citizenship and
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:07.280]  You know at least so I have some place to go to sometimes and spend more time in Mexico or I can totally fight it and and you know
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.520]  run for president and
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:12.040]  And and so I think that's a major issue
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:19.560]  And because they've tried to demonize you now and claim that you hate America. No, no, these are the people destroying what America
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:27.360]  Stands for the Bill of Rights and Constitution. So they turn it around and now try to say you're the anti-american and I have all these headlines
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:33.960]  Here's one. I am Alex. I am anti-america when my country won't let me go to court. Yes
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:39.680]  Well, let's be specific and I think the first if the first amendment is still out there
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.680]  Is that even exist?
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.960]  Don't I have the right to be able to say it?
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:47.880]  Yeah, you do but just to be specific
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:56.880]  This is a foreign banking cartel that is absorbing the Republic. You mean you love your country. You you just like your government, correct?
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.920]  Exactly. It's like my t-shirt on the internet. I love my country not my government
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:07.680]  So that's what you're saying, but I mean specifically because this will get quoted
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:12.800]  Great folks like you know drudge and people out there have actually carried what you really said
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:17.560]  But but but I mean just to correct anything else that the mainstream media got wrong
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:25.120]  Well, it's simply the fact that you know, I never said that I'm giving up by US citizenship that that's a lie
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:34.240]  Right there and and and I don't know you know how they're gonna spin everything. They don't even focus on what the case is about
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:42.240]  They focus because I may say some provocative things and that's what they focus in on is my provocative mouth
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.800]  for lack of better terms
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:52.080]  But you notice none of them are actually getting into the meat and potatoes of why was he denied and
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:57.080]  And you know one of the reporters had to laugh he looked at me and he goes well
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:00.600]  He said if you're not gonna fly how you're gonna get to Mexico now
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:06.800]  And I looked at him and said I haven't flown to Mexico yet. I said I drive it every year
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.080]  I said 3,000 miles one way I
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:14.480]  Said it'll have no effect on me going to Mexico and he was kind of stunned
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.040]  You know that you drive it
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:24.000]  You know, well, I drive it every I drive everywhere now and I'm trying to wake people up to the fact that you know
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  It's out on our highways now
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.040]  You know border patrol is no longer at the border
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:37.720]  Border patrol is now 200 200 300 miles in from the border on our interstate highways
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.880]  And I'm trying to tell these reporters
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:47.840]  Don't you realize in a matter of years you're gonna have to show an ID to go to Iowa if you live in Minnesota
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:54.200]  Well, it's worse than that two years ago in Tennessee they started this in five other states and
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:59.280]  The governor said don't it was in the news. He said don't do this
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:06.040]  They had the army out there under TSA command in quote a drill pulling over whole shutting down whole highways for hours
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.540]  And they told the governor basically go to hell
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:16.460]  I can't believe that, you know, we've we've allowed excuse me. We've allowed our federal government to become far far too powerful
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:23.420]  Then what our forefathers had in mind for it. Let me raise this governor. What do you because it's all over the news now
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:30.060]  They're now announcing FEMA is ordering in the Ozarks all over the country people who've had houses for upwards of 80 years
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:36.540]  To to that the government's gonna do well ordering them to demolish their house at their expense
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:43.460]  And they're just ordering people's lake houses moved. I mean, I mean this this government is just it's beyond North Korea
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:45.460]  It's it's it's like cancer
[01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:47.860]  Well, you know
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:55.260]  That part is is that our citizens out there many of them think it's just fine because they're being protected I
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:02.780]  Said to a guy yesterday on the radio this character in Minneapolis that called me Kim Kardashian
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:10.300]  I said to him, don't you listen to Ben Franklin when Ben Franklin said those who will give up their liberty for security
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:14.780]  Deserve and she'll have neither. You know what his response to me was
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:22.420]  That was 300 years ago what Ben Franklin said Ben doesn't apply to today. It was 230 years ago
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:26.460]  Whatever sure. He's an idiot, but I mean that's this guy's on the airwaves
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:33.860]  This guy is broadcasting what seems to me what mainstream America believes today
[01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:39.180]  No, sir, by the way, I do need to get a message out a coded message
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:44.180]  And I'll take time to do it right now Alex on your show. Okay. Go ahead
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:47.740]  He and Boston, please call me
[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:55.300]  KG and Boston who I know listens to Alex's show. I need to talk to you. Call me at home KG. Is
[01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:59.900]  That a famous sports person
[01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:03.180]  It's just a person
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:07.500]  Anyway, we'll move on if he's listening, he'll know
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:13.500]  Well, he told me he listens all the time, but anyway Alex. I
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:22.660]  I'm so frustrated right now. I have to go how come people in America. I don't even care that my case was thrown out
[01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:29.060]  Governor that is not what's happening here. I hope not, but you know, nobody's
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:33.100]  Here's the other thing to Alex that I question
[01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:38.620]  Where was the ACLU on my case? I spoke to my attorney yesterday
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:46.220]  And I said David did any of these organizations come forward to offer any type of help in this case?
[01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:51.460]  I brought forward. He said nobody. No, it's called an amicus brief. But let me stop you gov
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:55.340]  You've got a great lawyer in one cases before but let's just go back here
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:28:00.580]  I want to be specific the polls show over 90% are against the TSA
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:05.500]  Most talk show hosted against it. Most listeners are against it. They know it's a fraud
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:09.660]  I've talked to local TV reporters who are told to go out at the Austin Airport
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:16.780]  They'll interview 40 50 people before they get one person who likes to be groped and then they're told to put that on the news
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:20.940]  So if this is the system desperately trying to sell
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:30.580]  Something that's totally unconstitutional and you brought a lot of light to this it's because what you're doing is so honest and true
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:37.740]  That the system either is going to demonize you not talk about the case or ignore you just like Ron Paul
[01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:44.260]  They've done scientific studies and he's still number two or number three in all the major polls that he gets the least amount of
[01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:47.220]  Coverage and what he does get is negative. It's a badge of honor
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:55.260]  If you had the devilish system, you know this whole corrupt Nazi system liking you that would be that would be a problem governor
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.260]  I
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:29:05.220]  Stand back, but I guess I just I you have more faith in the people I guess than I do today because I'm not seeing or hearing anything
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:09.260]  I'm not seeing or hearing any outrage. I
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:18.660]  Mean other than you Alex and a handful of people of my inner sanctum. I haven't even had nobody tell me
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:21.860]  Hey, thanks for doing what you're doing. Not that I need it
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:27.100]  but I would just would like to feel that this country isn't I
[01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:30.380]  For lack of better term
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:36.260]  Drinking the Kool-Aid of the floor right in the water and they just don't kill a damn. Well, that's why that's it sir
[01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:41.260]  You've done you've done investigations on that. We have a drug to brain damage public. These are victims
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:45.700]  We've got to continue to wake them up. Stay there. Well, they're right back with Jesse Ventura. Stay with us
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:56.660]  We're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:05.540]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:10.340]  This is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:17.900]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home have turned members influence on our president in Congress
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:20.180]  And they really are calling the shots
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:28.740]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:36.300]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:42.420]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today?
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:45.940]  Seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, DC
[01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:54.020]  We have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:59.260]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot TV

[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:16.980]  Number one study the past history really does repeat itself
[01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:21.300]  Number two learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends
[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:28.420]  Number three take decisive action a perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:33.580]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book rising prices empty shelves
[01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:37.300]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:45.300]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits. This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com

[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:07.300]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years
[01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:10.300]  He says it will change everything about our lives
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:15.300]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own family
[01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:18.300]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:21.300]  The crazy part is he's usually right
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:23.300]  You see he predicted the collapse of GM
[01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:27.300]  Panny Mae, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner, general growth properties
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:30.300]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:36.300]  Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:38.300]  And it's a real eye-opener
[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:39.300]  I can't stress this enough
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:42.300]  You should at least watch this free video online today
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:46.300]  He explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:51.300]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:53.300]  That's End of America, the number 3.com

[01:32:57.300 --> 01:33:19.300]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
[01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:27.300]  All right, Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest and we're going to go to him in a moment
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:29.300]  But I can tell you unequivocally
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:33.300]  Just like those airline pilots said we're not doing this
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:35.300]  You trust us with a giant plane
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:39.300]  But you're going to have some potbellied person grab our genitals and microwave us not happening
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:41.300]  We've got to say no like they did
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:42.300]  And here's another issue
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:44.300]  This is the federalization of transportation
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:48.300]  They're now estimating it was 20 billion, now 40 billion a year
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:52.300]  40 billion dollars a year
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:55.300]  40 billion dollars a year
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:58.300]  That the hotels are losing
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:00.300]  That the restaurants are losing
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:01.300]  The theme parks are losing
[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.300]  Remember last year when this all kind of peaked
[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:06.300]  Because Drudge, the number one news website in the world
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:09.300]  Was posting our articles every day
[01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:12.300]  And my own employee, I'm trying to grope her small daughter and all that
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:13.300]  That kind of kicked it all off
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:15.300]  And then lying and saying they weren't
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:17.300]  And video coming out of it
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:21.300]  They came out at that point
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:24.300]  And basically tried to deny they were doing all this
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:26.300]  And then the restaurant association
[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:27.300]  The hotel association
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.300]  The travel association came out and said
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:31.300]  Stop it, don't do it, we don't want this
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:34.300]  So Governor Ventura is just a prominent person
[01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:36.300]  Who had the courage to speak out and say no
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:38.300]  And not fly
[01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:42.300]  The reason they're engaged in a blackout of him right now
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:44.300]  Is because they're scared of it
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:46.300]  They know we're reaching critical mass
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.300]  They know this is a bipartisan, transpartisan issue
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:53.300]  That brings black, white, Hispanic, liberal, conservative, libertarian
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:58.300]  Atheist, Christian, Muslim, Jew, agnostic, Buddhist together
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:00.300]  This is a unifying issue
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:02.300]  Everybody knows it's a joke
[01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:04.300]  And the borders are basically wide open
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:06.300]  But then they're using this like Ron Paul said
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:08.300]  The walls are to keep us in
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:10.300]  We're going back to Jesse Ventura
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:12.300]  But I just want to point out
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:14.300]  If you go to infowars.com
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:16.300]  We've got all three of his latest books
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:18.300]  American conspiracies, incredibly powerful
[01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:20.300]  Super discounted right now
[01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:23.300]  Six, three documents the government doesn't want you to read
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:27.300]  New York Times bestseller with Dick Russell and Jesse Ventura
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:29.300]  Don't start the revolution without me
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:32.300]  All three of these books discounted at infowars.com
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.300]  Get them out to people
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:36.300]  And Jesse, I've got to say to you
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:38.300]  And I want you to have the floor here
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:40.300]  And then really break down where you stand
[01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:42.300]  But I have seen you fly
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:44.300]  I've seen you happy when we got to the airport
[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:46.300]  Literally beside yourself
[01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:48.300]  Angry in a controlled fashion
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:49.300]  After they grove to you
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:51.300]  Ron Paul has come on and said it's disgusting
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:52.300]  And an enrages him
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:54.300]  He has to fly like twice a week
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:55.300]  He hates it
[01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:57.300]  All these other congress people
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:59.300]  I've had state reps on where they intimidate them
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:01.300]  And grope their children and scream at them
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:03.300]  Everybody's getting sick of this
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:05.300]  So that's why they're scared
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:07.300]  But why not run for president
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:10.300]  To really say I want the bill of rights
[01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:12.300]  I want my country back
[01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:14.300]  I want my country back
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:16.300]  And there's no way they can ignore you
[01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:17.300]  If you do that
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:19.300]  This is the best way to fight these bastards
[01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:22.300]  It's like Rosa Parks running for president
[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:23.300]  Governor Ventura
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:24.300]  Well, thanks Alex
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.300]  But the difficulty would be this
[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:29.300]  I don't have any money
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:31.300]  I won't accept PAC money
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:33.300]  I don't accept corporate money
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:34.300]  I never did
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:36.300]  Let me repeat to people
[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:38.300]  When I ran for governor's Minnesota
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:41.300]  I only raised $300,000
[01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:45.300]  I actually made more money doing the job
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:47.300]  Than I did to get the job
[01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:51.300]  I made $120,000 a year for four years
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:53.300]  That's what the governor has paid
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:55.300]  And so I made $480,000
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:58.300]  And I only spent $300,000 to get it
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:00.300]  The problem is Alex
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:02.300]  I don't have ballot access
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:03.300]  I can say all I want
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:05.300]  I'll run for president
[01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:09.300]  But I won't have ballot access in any state
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:12.300]  So therefore they'd have to write me
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:15.300]  And there's no way you stand any chance
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:16.300]  Okay, I got that
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:17.300]  But look at Ron Paul
[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:19.300]  His average donation is about $40
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.300]  And he's the number three razor
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:22.300]  I think you could do it
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:24.300]  Regardless, you're saying you've told me privately
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:26.300]  I won't run unless I think I can win
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:28.300]  You win by fighting these creatures
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:30.300]  And forcing your way into the media
[01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:31.300]  And I agree
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:33.300]  I think it's time for the libertarians
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:34.300]  Aaron Russo was great
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:35.300]  Michael Bagnarant great
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:36.300]  Come on, folks
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:37.300]  They're great guys
[01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:38.300]  But Jesse Ventura
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:39.300]  You are head and shoulders
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:41.300]  More as a personality
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:43.300]  The libertarians need to call for you
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:45.300]  I know they're waiting for Ron Paul off record
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:47.300]  I mean, that's well known in the media
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:49.300]  Paul said he might run third party
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:50.300]  If he doesn't get the nomination
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:51.300]  But I'm telling you, Gov
[01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:53.300]  I mean, you put your hat in the ring
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:55.300]  You're waiting on it
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:59.300]  You know, what can I do?
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:00.300]  What am I supposed to do?
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:03.300]  Call the libertarians and say here I am
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:04.300]  Well, that's what happens
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:06.300]  They've got people already lobbying
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:07.300]  Or they've got that caucus
[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:09.300]  I mean, I think it's here
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.300]  I think that it would require the libertarians
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:13.300]  To come to me
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:16.300]  And say, look, we have ballot access
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:18.300]  In 4850 states
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:20.300]  We would like you to be our nomination
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:22.300]  For president
[01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:24.300]  Oh, it's sensational
[01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:26.300]  Because I just don't think it's right
[01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:29.300]  For me to, I think they're the organization
[01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:32.300]  They're the ones that have the ballot access
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:33.300]  Well, I know this
[01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:35.300]  You're very libertarian on every front
[01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:38.300]  I passed your test with flying collars
[01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:40.300]  Yeah, well, I mean, there's no doubt
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:41.300]  Compared to Bob Barr
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:42.300]  I mean, you're a much bigger
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:44.300]  And more powerful and constitutional figure
[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:45.300]  You didn't vote for the Patriot Act
[01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:46.300]  Like he did
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:48.300]  And I'm not, he said he voted for it
[01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:49.300]  To get a sunset in it
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:51.300]  But, I mean, I'm not saying Barr
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:52.300]  Barr's even a bad guy
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:54.300]  The point is, you are light years ahead of him
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:56.300]  I remember something too though, Alex
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:57.300]  Let me explain this
[01:38:57.300 --> 01:39:00.300]  When you hold those public offices
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:03.300]  You know, when you leave 10 years later
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:05.300]  You realize that there are quite a few things
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:07.300]  You voted for that you probably
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:10.300]  In hindsight would not have done
[01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:12.300]  That can happen to you
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:13.300]  You know, and it can happen
[01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:15.300]  And I'm not making excuses for Bob Barr
[01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:16.300]  On the Patriot Act
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:18.300]  But it can happen
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:21.300]  And it's okay to change your mind
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:24.300]  If you voted for something 10 years ago
[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:26.300]  And then you realize through educating yourself
[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:29.300]  And seeing the results of it that you were wrong
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:31.300]  And simply come out and admit it
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:32.300]  I'm going to say this right
[01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:35.300]  I made a mistake when I voted for that 10 years ago
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:37.300]  I agree, I think he's done that now
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:38.300]  But what I'm saying here is
[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:39.300]  It shows a judgment issue
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:40.300]  But I understand what you're saying
[01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:42.300]  I'm saying this right now
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:44.300]  If the Libertarian Party
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:48.300]  Does not approach you now
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:50.300]  And does not seriously entertain
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:51.300]  Asking you to go to their caucus
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:52.300]  And try to win it
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:53.300]  Because that's how it works
[01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:54.300]  It's Libertarian
[01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:56.300]  You undoubtedly won it hands down
[01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:58.300]  Because you've got the background, everything
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:00.300]  You dwarf Bob Barr
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:04.300]  You would bring absolute lightning power
[01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:06.300]  To this whole thing
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:08.300]  And the fundraising they would get
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:10.300]  The amount of attention they
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:12.300]  A lot of people have said at the hierarchy
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:13.300]  They're infiltrated
[01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:15.300]  And I'm saying right now
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:17.300]  If they don't approach you
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:20.300]  They are 100% infiltrated
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:22.300]  Unless they come out and say
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:23.300]  We're waiting for Ron Paul
[01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:26.300]  Then they throw the gauntlet down in front of him
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:28.300]  He doesn't pick it up and then have you as VP
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:29.300]  Because that's even
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:31.300]  I mean that's a royal flush right there
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:33.300]  That's power packed
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:34.300]  But I mean definitely
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:36.300]  You need to get in the mix now
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:37.300]  And people who are Libertarians
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:39.300]  Need to call them up and say
[01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:41.300]  Listen, we need Jesse Ventura in there
[01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:44.300]  Don't try another Bob Barr on us or something
[01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:45.300]  I mean I'm sorry
[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:46.300]  Not trying to make Bob Barr angry
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:47.300]  As he comes on the show
[01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:49.300]  But I'm sorry Bob
[01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:50.300]  You're no Jesse Ventura
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:52.300]  Well, you know I'm not going to say
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:53.300]  One or the other that way
[01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:55.300]  You know I'm Mr. Barr
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:57.300]  You know that's the status of it
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:41:00.300]  And then again you know
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:02.300]  Before I would do anything like that
[01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:04.300]  I would have to consult my wife and my family
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:08.300]  Because I don't know if they're up for it
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:11.300]  You know and I'll be honest with you Alex
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:12.300]  Before any elected job
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:14.300]  I put my wife in front of it
[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:15.300]  That's one of the reasons
[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:16.300]  I did not seek re-election
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:19.300]  For a second term as governor
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:20.300]  You know I could have won
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:21.300]  There's no doubt in my mind
[01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:23.300]  I could have been re-elected
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:24.300]  Probably as many times
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:25.300]  As I would have desired
[01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:27.300]  The Republican Speaker of the House
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:29.300]  Even off the record told me that
[01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:30.300]  When I was in office
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:32.300]  He said there's nobody
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:34.300]  That in Minnesota that will be too
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:35.300]  He said you can be governor
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:36.300]  As long as you want
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:38.300]  But I'm not that way
[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:40.300]  You know I'm a throwback
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:42.300]  I believe that when you go and serve
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:43.300]  You go and serve
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:44.300]  And then when you're done serving
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:46.300]  Go back to what you used to do
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:49.300]  That you should not make a career out of it
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:50.300]  That's one of the downfalls
[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:51.300]  Of our country
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:53.300]  Is that all of these elected people
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:55.300]  They're all career politicians
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:58.300]  And when one becomes a career politician
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:00.300]  Then you're making decisions
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:02.300]  To benefit your career
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:04.300]  Which may not be the right decisions
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:06.300]  To benefit the country
[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:07.300]  And that's the situation
[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:09.300]  We're into the course with the Democrats
[01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:10.300]  And Republicans
[01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:12.300]  They don't give a damn about the country
[01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:13.300]  All they care about is their party
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:16.300]  Their power and whoever they serve
[01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:17.300]  Which is of course
[01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:19.300]  Their corporate donors and big money
[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:21.300]  Let me go over a few of those numbers
[01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:22.300]  Governor
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:24.300]  The article 12 facts about money in Congress
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:25.300]  That are so outrageous
[01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:27.300]  It's hard to believe they are true
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:28.300]  Up at infowars.com
[01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:30.300]  We have links in this article
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:33.300]  To all of the mainline statistics
[01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:36.300]  The collective net worth of the members of Congress
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:39.300]  Increased by 25% between 08 and 010
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:42.300]  As the rest of the collective wealth went down
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:43.300]  Number two, the collective net worth
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:44.300]  Of all members of Congress
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:46.300]  Is now slightly over $2 billion
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:48.300]  That is a billion with a B
[01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:49.300]  Number three
[01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:50.300]  Hey, wait a minute
[01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:52.300]  State government employees
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:54.300]  How could their wealth go up
[01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:56.300]  If they're on a fixed salary
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:58.300]  Well, that's why they'll spend 50 times
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:00.300]  What it pays to get the job
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:03.300]  Gee, are they getting money on the side somehow?
[01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:04.300]  Yeah, let's continue
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:05.300]  Okay
[01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:06.300]  Number three
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:07.300]  This happened during a time
[01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:09.300]  When the net worth of most American households
[01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:10.300]  Was declining rapidly
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:11.300]  According to the Federal Reserve
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:13.300]  The collective net worth of all Americans
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:15.300]  Decreased by 23%
[01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:16.300]  During the same period
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:19.300]  So there's one up more than
[01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:21.300]  Let me add this to it too
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:23.300]  All you hear about
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:25.300]  From Republicans and Congresses
[01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:27.300]  Is government
[01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:29.300]  Obamacare, right?
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:30.300]  Yes, sir
[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:33.300]  Well, then here's what I propose
[01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:36.300]  I propose that every citizen
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:37.300]  In the United States
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:39.300]  Should have the identical health care
[01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:41.300]  As the Congress gets
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:42.300]  Oh, that's right
[01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:44.300]  They're exempt from all their own laws
[01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:45.300]  And get their own health care
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:46.300]  Yeah, and what is it?
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:48.300]  It's government-run health care
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:51.300]  So when you hear Michelle Bachman
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:53.300]  Screaming about Obamacare
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:56.300]  Remember, she has government-run health care
[01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:59.300]  That serves her family just fine
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:01.300]  Sir, Ron Paul has refused it, by the way
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:04.300]  Well, okay, you know, Ron's an honorable man
[01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:05.300]  Exactly, no, I was just...
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:06.300]  But the point is
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.300]  There's your fine example
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:12.300]  That the Congress gets benefits you don't get
[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:14.300]  They get health care
[01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.300]  You think they're worried at all
[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:19.300]  That half of this country can't even go to the doctor
[01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:20.300]  Because they have no health care
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:22.300]  What do they care for?
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:23.300]  They have theirs
[01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:25.300]  And theirs is government-run
[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:28.300]  So when you hear all these Republicans
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:30.300]  Sitting and condone
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:33.300]  Or berate government-run health care
[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:34.300]  When they have it
[01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:36.300]  That's the height of hypocrisy
[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:37.300]  You're right
[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:38.300]  Here's a couple more
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:39.300]  I won't read them all
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:40.300]  Number four
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:42.300]  The average death worth of a member of Congress
[01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:44.300]  Is now approximately 3.8 million
[01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:45.300]  Number five
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:47.300]  The net worth of House Minority Leader
[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:50.300]  Nancy Pelosi increased 62%
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:52.300]  From 09 to 010
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:54.300]  Boy, talk about cashing in
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:57.300]  The top Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell
[01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:59.300]  Saw his net worth grow by 29%
[01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:00.300]  From 09 to 010
[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:03.300]  He is now approximately worth 9.8 million
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:04.300]  Number seven
[01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:06.300]  More than 50% of the members of the U.S. Congress
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:07.300]  Are millionaires
[01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:09.300]  It just goes on, but enough of that
[01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:12.300]  That doesn't necessarily make them bad
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:13.300]  No
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:14.300]  I mean, that's what America's about
[01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:16.300]  Let me be clear on that, you know
[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:17.300]  But the point is
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:19.300]  If it's a level playing field
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:20.300]  Yes
[01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:22.300]  And if they're acquiring their money
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:24.300]  In an honest manner
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:26.300]  And they're not selling their souls
[01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:27.300]  To rock and roll
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:28.300]  Which is what these people
[01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:31.300]  You know, the first thing that I would do
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:34.300]  If I became president of the United States
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:37.300]  You know what I would do, attempt to do
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:40.300]  I would take away retirement
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:43.300]  Because when you do public service
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:48.300]  You should not get a retirement for it
[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:50.300]  That's what you ought to look into too, Alex
[01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:54.300]  Look into the retirement of these congressmen
[01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:58.300]  And the huge parachutes they get
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:02.300]  There are some small town people
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:03.300]  In small town government
[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:06.300]  Getting 800 thou a year in California
[01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:09.300]  Gov, there's so much to cover
[01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:10.300]  We're running out of time
[01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:13.300]  I want to go back to during the break
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:14.300]  You were really
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:16.300]  I don't think that would be a good idea as president
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:18.300]  Take away all retirement
[01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:21.300]  You're supposed to be doing public service
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:23.300]  When you do public service
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:25.300]  There shouldn't be a retirement plan
[01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:28.300]  Well, I know it's certainly turned the government
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:29.300]  Into a mafia
[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:31.300]  But Gov, going back to during the break
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:32.300]  You were really on fire
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:34.300]  Talking about what the TSA is
[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:35.300]  Where this country's going
[01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:37.300]  The media lying about what you said
[01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:39.300]  Throw down the gauntlet
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:40.300]  You've got the floor
[01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:43.300]  The TSA to me
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:46.300]  The workers out there
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:49.300]  These are $10 an hour workers
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:52.300]  These are people that are not highly trained
[01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:55.300]  They're not highly trained at all to do what they do
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:57.300]  And it's a complete abuse
[01:46:57.300 --> 01:46:59.300]  People that work at the airports
[01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:02.300]  They don't have to go through this screening
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:04.300]  It's only the passengers that do
[01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:08.300]  And I would love to see people boycott the airlines
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:11.300]  I would encourage people
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:13.300]  If you get the chance, don't fly
[01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:17.300]  Don't participate in this martial law
[01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:19.300]  That's going on at our airports
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:22.300]  Because if you want to know what martial law is
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:24.300]  Go to an airport
[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:26.300]  Go to an airport
[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:30.300]  All you're going to see are armed guards
[01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:32.300]  Walking everywhere
[01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:34.300]  And you being pristine padded down
[01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:37.300]  And treated like a prison asylum
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:39.300]  And that's what our airports
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:41.300]  I live in Mexico half a year
[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:43.300]  And I have a lot of friends down there
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:45.300]  That come from Europe
[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:48.300]  They avoid the United States like the plague
[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:52.300]  They avoid it because it's like going into East Berlin
[01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:54.300]  They tell me that
[01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:57.300]  Is that what our country should stand for?
[01:47:57.300 --> 01:48:00.300]  We the bastion of freedom
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:03.300]  And we're supposed to stand for this lockdown
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:08.300]  You know, all over the pretense that they're keeping us safe
[01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:10.300]  Keeping us safe from who?
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:14.300]  I would say we need to be kept safe from them
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:17.300]  Well said, that's what I told the TSA guy
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:19.300]  I'm like, how do I know you're not a terrorist
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:22.300]  You guys get caught stealing and doing all this stuff constantly
[01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:25.300]  I'm not going to get into individual things the TSA does
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:29.300]  The TSA is there because our elected officials
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:34.300]  And government George Bush and the Patriot Act put them there
[01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:35.300]  You're right
[01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:38.300]  And the TSA and Homeland Security
[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:41.300]  Homeland Security is a federal agency
[01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:44.300]  That has the power of the Gestapo
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:47.300]  I mean, when I went out to do Plum Island
[01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:51.300]  None of the fishermen would take me on a legal ride in their boat
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:55.300]  Because they were afraid Homeland Security would pull their license
[01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:58.300]  And they would lose their livelihood
[01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:00.300]  That's what our government is supposed to be
[01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:02.300]  Oppressive like that
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:06.300]  Our government is supposed to rule us with fear
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:12.300]  I don't think that's what the United States of America should stand for at all
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:16.300]  And that's what our government, in my opinion, has turned into today
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:17.300]  Well, you're right
[01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:20.300]  I mean, the whole world looks at us in horror
[01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:23.300]  And thinks of us as a police state
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:27.300]  Well, Alex, why do we need bases all throughout the world?
[01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:30.300]  What have we done to the rest of the world
[01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:34.300]  Where we have to need to protect ourselves to such extreme?
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:38.300]  Obviously, we're not a very good neighbor
[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:41.300]  Because if you've got to barricade your house
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:47.300]  And put up armament and electric fencing and dark dogs and everything else in the world
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:50.300]  Obviously, you don't trust your neighbors at all
[01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:54.300]  Or you don't have a good relationship with the people around you
[01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:58.300]  And that's what it seems like the United States of America has turned into today
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:03.300]  We were looked at at one time as the bastion of freedom
[01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:08.300]  I don't know how anybody could look when we want to put walls up at our borders
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:10.300]  We got stopped
[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:14.300]  It's like driving around Nazi Germany now
[01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:18.300]  They got stops all over the country when you drive places
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:23.300]  And the people of this country, many of them sit back and say, oh, that's wonderful
[01:50:23.300 --> 01:50:26.300]  Well, you're right on that
[01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:28.300]  The vast majority are upset about it
[01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:34.300]  But they don't have any respect for themselves to follow lawsuit or boycott or speak up like you've done
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:35.300]  And they don't understand
[01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:39.300]  Remember Obama at his last day of the union said, we'll put up trains nationwide
[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:42.300]  And don't worry, you won't get groped like the airport and people laughed
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:45.300]  And they were already doing it at train stations
[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:47.300]  He knew he was lying
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:49.300]  I mean, this is insane
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:54.300]  And what's crazy is I go fishing a few times a year in Port Aransas and other areas
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:55.300]  I've been doing it my whole life
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:51:01.300]  And now when Coast Guard or Homeland Security now out there drives within 500 yards
[01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:05.300]  People stop the boats and bow their heads basically groveling
[01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:06.300]  And I said, why are you doing that?
[01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:09.300]  And they said, if you look at them and if you don't stop your boat
[01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:11.300]  They jump on board and scream and yell at you
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:12.300]  And I said, really?
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:15.300]  And they said, oh yeah, this isn't America anymore
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:17.300]  And we're talking hundreds of miles from the border
[01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:20.300]  And they literally, this morning I was driving into work
[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:22.300]  And I saw a bunch of police out doing some higher work
[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:26.300]  And they were like bugging their eyes out and strutting around looking crazy
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:32.300]  The bottom line is, Alex, is that we don't need Homeland Security
[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:36.300]  Homeland Security was put in place, in my opinion
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:42.300]  We need to cut down the power of the federal government and give power back to the states
[01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:43.300]  And face the danger, as you've said
[01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:47.300]  I mean, I'm much more afraid and history shows a big corrupt government
[01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:49.300]  Than some guy with a turban on his head
[01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:52.300]  Meanwhile, they just gave Libya to al-Qaeda
[01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:56.300]  Well, you know, let's remember what they did to Iraq
[01:51:56.300 --> 01:52:01.300]  Iraq now belongs, Iraq was what, Sunni, and now it's the other way
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:08.300]  When we took Saddam out, we put Iraq right in line to be with Iran
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:12.300]  Now, why would we do that? That makes no sense to me
[01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:15.300]  I guess they know more than I do about what they're trying to accomplish
[01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:17.300]  Now, it's a radicalization program
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:20.300]  That they're creating the next enemy to blow up 10 years from now
[01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:24.300]  Well, you know, again, I stand with Ron Paul
[01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:27.300]  Bring the troops home, end the wars
[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:29.300]  Let's take care of our own infrastructure
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:33.300]  Let's build highways, let's put our money into our country
[01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:37.300]  Instead of putting money into the rest of the world
[01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:40.300]  Unbelievable, I want to take a few calls, Governor, but...
[01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:42.300]  Okay, real quick, and then I got another call
[01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:44.300]  I actually got to do it in a few minutes
[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:46.300]  No, I understand, oh, you got to go right at the end here
[01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:49.300]  And you want me to put you in touch with Coast to Coast A.M.?
[01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:51.300]  Yeah, please do
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:54.300]  Yeah, because I want you to get this information out to the widest audience
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:56.300]  I'll call George Nore at the other show and get it hooked right up
[01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:57.300]  Okay
[01:52:57.300 --> 01:52:59.300]  Because I'm sure they want to get you on
[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:02.300]  Let's go ahead, because he was bringing you up last night when I was on
[01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:03.300]  Let's go to Danny and Georgia
[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:06.300]  Thanks for holding her on the air with Governor Ventura
[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:07.300]  Hi, guys, how are you doing?
[01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:08.300]  Hi, Barry
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:10.300]  It's an honor to talk to you both
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:15.300]  I'm a big fan of the show as well as your work that you've done for all of us as Americans
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:17.300]  But I wanted to say, you know, I mean, you're completely right
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:20.300]  It's been a great interview, and you're completely right
[01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:25.300]  You know, people need to get behind your work, Ventura, and, you know, really support you
[01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:27.300]  And, you know, they need to start speaking up
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:30.300]  Because I haven't flown ever since I was 10 years old
[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:32.300]  I was about 11 years ago
[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:35.300]  And, you know, I refuse to do it now
[01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:37.300]  Because of all the groping and everything
[01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:42.300]  So I just wanted your take on that, but, you know, what do you think about, you know, people getting behind you
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:46.300]  And starting some kind of movement to get the hotels, the media
[01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:49.300]  Everybody to start boycotting and all that kind of stuff
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:51.300]  I would love, here's what I would love
[01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:55.300]  I would love to pick out one day, just one day
[01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:59.300]  And have no one in this country fly that day
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:00.300]  I think we picked that
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:07.300]  The airport's down in protest for one day
[01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:11.300]  Yeah, you had said next Fourth of July, but that's a ways off
[01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:14.300]  I mean, I would say, we did it last year
[01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:17.300]  We had, you know, no fly on Thanksgiving
[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:19.300]  The day before, the day of, the day after
[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:21.300]  Or if you have to, opt out
[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:24.300]  And they basically turned the scanners off for two weeks
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:27.300]  Because they didn't want to give people a chance to revolt
[01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:33.300]  Well, you know, to me, until, as long as people continue to put up with it
[01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:36.300]  And like I said, there's a huge crowd of people out there
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:40.300]  Like the one guy said to me, well, I'm all for it
[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:44.300]  Because no one's hijacked any planes and attacked us since 9-11
[01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:47.300]  Well said, let's take another call here
[01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:51.300]  Let's talk to Barbara in Ohio, you're on the air with Jesse Ventura
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:52.300]  Hello
[01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:53.300]  Hi Barbara
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:57.300]  Hi there Alex, first of all, we need to pray
[01:54:57.300 --> 01:55:00.300]  Heavenly Father, I just thank you for my brother
[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:03.300]  Barbara, Barbara, I don't mean to interrupt you, but we're almost out of time here
[01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:06.300]  I don't leave that Barbara, unfortunately I'm an atheist
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:08.300]  It doesn't do me any good
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:11.300]  Well, Jesse, on your show, you're investigating spiritual stuff
[01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:13.300]  You really don't know what's going on out there
[01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:18.300]  No, I certainly don't, you know, but I belong to no religion
[01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:23.300]  And I don't, I belong to the same religion George Carlin did
[01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:26.300]  But listen Barbara, I appreciate your prayer though
[01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:29.300]  I know you want Barbara, don't get me wrong
[01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:31.300]  I don't stand in anyone's way
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:35.300]  If you desire to pray, you pray to your heart's content
[01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:37.300]  But Barbara specifically, do you have a quick question or comment?
[01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:41.300]  Yes, we do have a way out of this evil
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:43.300]  It's all in the Word of God
[01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:45.300]  If God before you who can be against you
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:49.300]  Noah was sheltered, Lot was taken to the mountains
[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:52.300]  Where did Jesus go when he was persecuted?
[01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:55.300]  Well, then I guess we got a vote for Rick Perry
[01:55:55.300 --> 01:55:59.300]  Because Rick Perry said that God came to him and told him he had to be president
[01:55:59.300 --> 01:56:01.300]  Barbara, I appreciate your call
[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:06.300]  Yeah, what's to me disqualifies him, Alex
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:08.300]  Well, that's when he's not visiting me
[01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:09.300]  No, no, no, it disqualifies him
[01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:13.300]  Because I challenge Rick Perry to prove to me he talked to God
[01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:17.300]  Well, he must have talked to God when he was at the transvestite bar
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:19.300]  What I'm saying is prove it
[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:22.300]  He can't prove it, he can only say it
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:25.300]  Let's go to Brad in Canada with Jesse Ventura
[01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:27.300]  Last caller, I'm going to say bye to him here
[01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:30.300]  I know you got that next call, but I need to talk to you right at the end here
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:32.300]  Go ahead, Brad in Canada, then I'll get to others
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:33.300]  Go ahead
[01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:36.300]  Well, Governor, I thank you and I salute you, my friend
[01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:40.300]  I must confess, I wasn't surprised with the ruling
[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:45.300]  What I'm most surprised with is the fact there's no reaction from anybody
[01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:47.300]  I have mentioned this to everybody up here
[01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:52.300]  Maybe I have a differences perspective because I'm on the outside looking in for the U.S.
[01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:56.300]  But no one knew about it, no one knows about it, and no one seems to care
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:57.300]  Exactly
[01:56:57.300 --> 01:57:00.300]  I'm going to stop you, I had people
[01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:04.300]  I've had people all over come up to me and say, thank Jesse Ventura
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:08.300]  I mean, I've had every guest I have on rock stars, you name it, say thank him
[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:11.300]  I had people this weekend come up and say thank the Governor
[01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:15.300]  I had a friend I haven't seen in a year show up down at our
[01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:19.300]  Alex, these are all the people that listen to you
[01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:24.300]  And as big as your show is, there's still a lot of people out there that don't
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:26.300]  No, no, I totally agree with you
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:29.300]  My point is we got a lot of people starting to wake up and we don't have a choice
[01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:31.300]  We got to beat this enemy
[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:33.300]  I agree
[01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:35.300]  Caller, I appreciate your call, but in the minute
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:38.300]  I appreciate it too, but he's exactly correct
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:39.300]  In the minute
[01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:44.300]  Extreme media didn't touch it, half the country doesn't even know that I brought the lawsuit
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:48.300]  Well, let's have all the listeners call talk radio, call national media, tell them cover this
[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:51.300]  This is a big deal, do we have a right to a jury trial?
[01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:57.300]  Either that or have them all call Judge Nelson and ask why I can't have a jury trial
[01:57:57.300 --> 01:57:59.300]  Why she has no courage
[01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:03.300]  Because she's a political minion, a political sellout
[01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:06.300]  Governor, we've only got about 45 seconds left
[01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:08.300]  Look, you've thrown down the gauntlet
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:12.300]  You're telling the media get the story straight correct about giving up your US citizenship
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:16.300]  Oh, absolutely, I did not ever once say I was giving up my citizenship
[01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:22.300]  I merely said I was going to apply for Mexican citizenship and have dual citizenship
[01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:24.300]  There is nothing wrong with that
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:28.300]  Considering that I do spend a great deal of time in Mexico
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:33.300]  And what's the matter with being a dual citizen?
[01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:34.300]  Nothing

[02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:27.300]  By the way, folks, I am working with Governor Jesse Ventura
[02:00:27.300 --> 02:00:32.300]  He's got a good heart, he's a good man, he's woken up in the last six years in the New World Order
[02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:37.300]  In a show this season, he's starting to investigate kind of the occult and things
[02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:47.300]  And I think he'll come around on the fact that he just doesn't like organized religion telling him what to do and all the hypocrisy
[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:51.300]  But he's a good guy and I appreciate Barbara trying to pray for him, but I knew he wasn't going to want that
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:55.300]  Because he's tired of all these Christians launching wars and all this
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:58.300]  But that's the system doing that in Christians' names
[02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:04.300]  And I think that, I've seen Ventura really grow by light years
[02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:08.300]  And he's grown in ways I haven't grown, I'm not up here on some high horse saying
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:14.300]  But look how far he's come, he's really standing up and we appreciate that
[02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:22.300]  I've got Bill in Connecticut, Justin in, I don't know where Justin's calling from, but he didn't tell us so that's fine
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:28.300]  And we've got 1310 AM New York listener Daniel, we'll get to him, Chris in Florida and others
[02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:32.300]  We'll get to everybody here coming up with Max Kaiser
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:38.300]  But that's big news, I mean he's a big political figure, he's got a lot of political weight and name recognition
[02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:44.300]  He's very libertarian and conservative when it comes to fiscal issues, I don't agree with some of the issues
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:48.300]  But the point is he'll take on the New World Order, he'll take on their police state
[02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:55.300]  And he can really be informed that if I had more time to really work on Ventura, he'll always look at information
[02:01:55.300 --> 02:02:02.300]  If I had more time, that's somebody I could really fully, I think, get around to our way of thinking
[02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:09.300]  I don't want to get into it all on air, but Ventura does not associate with a lot of people personally
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:15.300]  He doesn't give hardly anybody his home phone number, he doesn't really, he's kind of a loner
[02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:23.300]  And he likes me for whatever reason and we actually have discussions and talks and our friends and debates about things
[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:27.300]  And he's a good guy, I can tell you he's got a good heart
[02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:35.300]  And I don't want to compare him to Saul Atarsus and the Saul moment because he's not hunting down good people, he is a good person
[02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:41.300]  But I think he's going to have a Saul of atarsus on the road to Damascus moment
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:44.300]  In fact I know he is in my heart
[02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:49.300]  And so I pray for Jesse Ventura, I pray for Ron Paul, I pray for other people
[02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:53.300]  Who I know have good hearts, who I've met and I've talked to and I've watched for a long time
[02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:57.300]  Obviously Ron Paul is somebody who I'm about 100% lined up with
[02:02:57.300 --> 02:03:00.300]  About 99%
[02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:03.300]  I know Ron Paul is really smart and knows the truth about 9-11
[02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:07.300]  I mean I know he knows about Moza Deck, he knows about stage stuff, but he's said before and he's been asked
[02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:11.300]  Why don't you get into this, he goes, I haven't had time to fully get into it, I'm covering a lot of other issues
[02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:17.300]  And I understand why he's doing that, it's a strategic decision to not get into that tar baby
[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:20.300]  But you just can't get better than Ron Paul
[02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:23.300]  I would support Ron Paul over Jesse Ventura for president
[02:03:23.300 --> 02:03:27.300]  But you notice Ventura defers and says, I'll be his VP, I'm ready
[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:30.300]  I mean that's what you want
[02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:36.300]  Just because he would add so much pizazz and electricity to everything
[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:40.300]  And would bring all the libertarians and a lot of liberals and people over
[02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:43.300]  Ron Paul though doesn't compromise much
[02:03:43.300 --> 02:03:48.300]  And I don't know if he would probably sit down with Ventura
[02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:52.300]  If he did choose him as VP and go over a lot of issues
[02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:55.300]  You know, you're going to support me on this, this and that, right?
[02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:03.300]  It's a complex issue, but I know Ventura and I know he's good
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:07.300]  And there's a lot of goodness in him
[02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:11.300]  And I don't want to get off in a long discussion about it, it's just
[02:04:11.300 --> 02:04:16.300]  That's big news because I finally found the full, and I should have even had one of my writers have a story on it
[02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:19.300]  I finally found the full press conference, he didn't say that he said
[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:24.300]  Well, I guess I'll spend more time in Mexico or I could just try to get citizenship down there
[02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:28.300]  And be a dual citizen, but things are pretty wild down there
[02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:31.300]  But at least I get as bad as Mexico is, I don't have to go through all these checkpoints
[02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:35.300]  Or I can run for president and he wants to fight
[02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:38.300]  But he's sitting there as a realist saying, okay, support me
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:42.300]  And because he doesn't have a political organization under him, it's, I mean
[02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:45.300]  You're looking at something powerful that could happen here
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:49.300]  The libertarians need to at least start talking to him right now
[02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:53.300]  People should call the libertarian party, I mean, if they don't at least talk to him
[02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:56.300]  Something's going on, something's going on
[02:04:56.300 --> 02:05:00.300]  We'll be right back with Max Kaiser, your phone calls and a lot more, stay with us
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:04.300]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action
[02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:09.300]  Tyranny is here, the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality
[02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:12.300]  It really says that the state is God
[02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:17.300]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth
[02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:22.300]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:24.300]  Now being expanded nationwide
[02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:30.300]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state
[02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:34.300]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen
[02:05:34.300 --> 02:05:39.300]  Repair to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship
[02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:45.300]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner
[02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:48.300]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan
[02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:51.300]  The police state isn't coming, it's here

[02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:29.300]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:07:29.300 --> 02:07:32.300]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:07:32.300 --> 02:07:36.300]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:41.300]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:07:41.300 --> 02:07:45.300]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:46.300]  One of my old sponsors

[02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:39.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live
[02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:46.300]  It, of course, is the 8th day of November 2011
[02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:52.300]  Jesse Ventura has now revealed, specifically, he said the software, I never even got to it on there
[02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:57.300]  They said national security on why it couldn't go to a regular jury
[02:08:57.300 --> 02:08:59.300]  You can't be trusted with that
[02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:05.300]  And the rules of the TSA that are secret, and why they're violating our rights, is national security
[02:09:05.300 --> 02:09:07.300]  That's another word for martial law
[02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:11.300]  He said on air, he's ready for libertarians to approach him, who have ballot access
[02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:13.300]  I mean, he would give so much attention to libertarians
[02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:17.300]  That something's going on if they don't approach him immediately to seek the nomination
[02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:20.300]  Because then he'll have to run against some other folks, but he's ready to do it
[02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:27.300]  Big news from Ventura, his lawyer confirmed that the judge sat, listen to this
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:35.300]  Sat on the ruling from January into November
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:44.300]  So 10 plus months, knowing that they only had 50-something days, a certain period, just less than two months
[02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:46.300]  For it to be filed up to the appeals
[02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:50.300]  So they put it into a penalty box and sat on it
[02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:53.300]  I mean, it's just incredible, so he couldn't get a jury trial
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:10:01.300]  He talked about the TSA now setting up checkpoints at the truck weighing stations, and now this is martial law
[02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:08.300]  That is a major newsmaking interview, and I'm telling you, the prospect of Jesse Ventura running for president
[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:14.300]  He would educate people, he would inject real issues, and he would go after the TSA and the police state and the Patriot Act
[02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:16.300]  That's what we need
[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:19.300]  Bob Barr, who was their last person, really turned off a lot of libertarians
[02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:23.300]  I know a lot of folks that left the libertarian party over that when they had Bob Barr, who voted for the Patriot Act
[02:10:23.300 --> 02:10:25.300]  Now he said he did it to get the sunset in, fine
[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:32.300]  I'm not even saying Bob Barr's a bad guy, we have him on as a guest, but compared to Ron Paul, he is, you know
[02:10:32.300 --> 02:10:36.300]  He's no Ron Paul, and he's no Jesse Ventura
[02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:39.300]  Jesse Ventura is no Ron Paul, but Ron Paul's no Jesse Ventura
[02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:43.300]  You know, they're both interesting in their own ways, and men who believe they're doing the right thing
[02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:47.300]  Ron Paul is more of a master of understanding
[02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:52.300]  Ventura is coming into that now, and I'm telling you, he's a powerful asset in the fight against the globalist
[02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:56.300]  Big things can happen here, big things
[02:10:56.300 --> 02:10:59.300]  He can really capture the public's attention, that's why they're giving it no attention
[02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:02.300]  There's been a media blackout, now guess what happened?
[02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:08.300]  I talked to Ventura, suddenly he had the AP newspapers calling him
[02:11:08.300 --> 02:11:13.300]  Calling his other line, calling his manager
[02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:16.300]  Calling the press number
[02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:20.300]  As soon as he went on the show, the blackout broke
[02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:25.300]  And by the way, I told him, you want to go on Coast to Coast A.M. and he said, I'm ready
[02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:31.300]  So I need to call Norrie up, because I'm surmising that Norrie will probably want him on
[02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:35.300]  I don't know, I hate to even call up somebody like that and say, hey do you want him on
[02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:40.300]  But obviously I think they will, because he was bringing up Ventura last night when I was with him for three hours
[02:11:40.300 --> 02:11:45.300]  Paul Watson is sitting here on hold, because the show was just live and streamed out audio and video
[02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:48.300]  We don't have an archive of it yet, we're going to race to get that to Paul
[02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:53.300]  So we don't get scooped by the media, by the AP and others that are calling Ventura
[02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:58.300]  Notice none of them would talk to him, he was booked on CNN, you name it, it all got cancelled
[02:11:58.300 --> 02:12:06.300]  Okay, because this is a hot issue, people are mad about this man, I want to fly to the Bahamas with my kids
[02:12:06.300 --> 02:12:11.300]  They've never flown, my son's nine and wants to, I can't march him into Austin Berkstrom to be grabbed
[02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:16.300]  And then to be taken away from me and have a shirt taken off and men start grabbing his genitals
[02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:22.300]  I mean, I'm upset about this and they have the nerve to say, oh love it or leave it Ventura, you just want attention
[02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:26.300]  He doesn't want attention, he has to be begged off record to do that TV show
[02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:32.300]  He wants to retire, that's all he wants to do, he's 60 years old
[02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:39.300]  And he lived a rough life, folks, he doesn't want to, he's told me privately, I don't want to run for president
[02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:43.300]  No, no, no, now he's like, I want to, I don't want to get into them, I don't want to be defeated by them
[02:12:43.300 --> 02:12:45.300]  I don't want to be dominated by them
[02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:52.300]  But the big breaking news is, he said the media are lying and I've gone and seen the full interview
[02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:57.300]  Online in pieces because nobody would put it up in one, he never said I'm going to give up my US citizenship
[02:12:57.300 --> 02:13:00.300]  They spun it like that, AP and others did
[02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:04.300]  He said, well, I guess I'll go for dual citizenship so I can stay down there more of the year
[02:13:04.300 --> 02:13:09.300]  Or I could do the other thing and run for president to fight these people, maybe that's what I'll do
[02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:14.300]  But they spun it like, oh, he doesn't like America, and then Ventura's like, well, my government, I don't have patriotism for it anymore
[02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:17.300]  He's a Navy guy, he means the system
[02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:22.300]  But America's still here, even if the globalists have taken over and I brought that up to him and he got it
[02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:26.300]  He said, yes, I love my country, I hate my corrupt government
[02:13:26.300 --> 02:13:29.300]  That's another quote from Ventura, I know you're listening, Paul, we're going to Max Kaiser
[02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:32.300]  So Paul will try to get you that MP3 as quickly as possible
[02:13:32.300 --> 02:13:35.300]  But obviously the media is listening and it's not that big of a deal
[02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:38.300]  But the point is, I don't want to, AP is so sniveling and others are
[02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:41.300]  They'll always take my interviews and not even give us credit because they're so scared of us
[02:13:41.300 --> 02:13:45.300]  So that's fine, but I want to get another three-pointer in the basket here on them
[02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:49.300]  So just hit them and hit them hard, I've just given you the data transmission
[02:13:49.300 --> 02:13:54.300]  You can go with that now, that was all said, you know, say, you know, Rush Report audio video coming
[02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:59.300]  But that's what happened here on the air, Watson, are you ready?
[02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:06.300]  Okay, good job, Watson, I'll call you back, we're working on stopping the recording in there and starting a new one
[02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:09.300]  And then crunching an MP3 as fast as we can off the audio
[02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:12.300]  Guys, make sure when they come in there, I'm not saying crunch the video and put it up now
[02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:16.300]  Just crunch the audio, strip it and do it, okay, good job
[02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:19.300]  All right, I'll talk to you soon, Watson
[02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:23.300]  Thank you, okay, and again, here I am with about an hour and a half of sleep
[02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:26.300]  I'm totally animated, it's the animating contest of liberty
[02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:30.300]  I hardly even sleep now, all I have the aid of is coffee
[02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:34.300]  I feel like I can run up the side of a mountain right now, we are going to fight these people
[02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:38.300]  And I got to sit there and boost Ventura's morale, but that's good, that's what he needs
[02:14:38.300 --> 02:14:41.300]  I'm here to boost your morale, I'm here to boost everybody's morale
[02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:45.300]  That's what I'm here for, I know we can win, we don't have a choice
[02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:49.300]  Let's go ahead and we'll get to all your calls
[02:14:49.300 --> 02:14:54.300]  This has been all the longest here, after we get to Kaiser Chris, Justin, Mark, Daniel, Bill, get to everybody
[02:14:54.300 --> 02:15:00.300]  Max Kaiser invented the Hollywood Stock Exchange System, which is one of the models of virtual trading systems today
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:05.300]  He has really chronicled beforehand much of what's unfolded with precision
[02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:09.300]  Including the fact that as soon as the Greek debt deal was done, Italy would be the next to implode
[02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:13.300]  That's now happening all by design, global bank, world government openly announced
[02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:17.300]  Ventura and I are criticized for even talking about it because people can hold two thoughts
[02:15:17.300 --> 02:15:23.300]  World government, openly being announced, but we're bad saying it exists in our FBI manuals is terrorist
[02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:26.300]  Insane people believe it exists, but it does exist and it's good
[02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:31.300]  By the way, the street lamps are listening to you, they have the deputy, Homeland Security had actually saying
[02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:34.300]  You'll never know which one has the microphone in giggling on the news
[02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:39.300]  I mean, we have reached just absolute globalist frothing level
[02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:45.300]  By these people, just entering into just them doing victory dances
[02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:50.300]  On us, spitting in our face, groping our women and children, just laughing and snickering
[02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:55.300]  I've got the article right here, DHS official says you will never know if street lights were spying on you
[02:15:55.300 --> 02:16:02.300]  I mean, you never know what Big Sis is watching, this is just entered total insanity, Nero, suicide banker
[02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:06.300]  Destroying the whole system as Max Kaiser says, he joins us to break down everything that's happening
[02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:10.300]  But before we get into what's happening in Europe and how this affects us, you're over in France
[02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:13.300]  We appreciate you Max Kaiser, MaxKaiser.com
[02:16:13.300 --> 02:16:20.300]  What is your view on the whole TSA situation, killing $40 billion a year in travel?
[02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:25.300]  The restaurant, the travel associations, the hotel associations for a year
[02:16:25.300 --> 02:16:28.300]  Begging the scum government to stop this since last November
[02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:33.300]  And their answer is, we're setting it up on the highway and we're going to grop your wife's breast there
[02:16:33.300 --> 02:16:36.300]  And if you don't like it, a SWAT team will slaughter you and your family
[02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:39.300]  I mean, it's just like beyond insanity
[02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:42.300]  Yeah, hey Alex, thanks for having me on the show
[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:46.300]  Yeah, this TSA thing has gone global, you know, I've been doing a lot of traveling around Europe
[02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:51.300]  And the same kind of groping, you've been talking about in the States
[02:16:51.300 --> 02:16:54.300]  You see it all over the world now, wherever you go
[02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:59.300]  So the US is now the exporter of every form of vile evil
[02:16:59.300 --> 02:17:03.300]  Yeah, well I've been having some fun with it lately in Europe
[02:17:03.300 --> 02:17:09.300]  Because I went online and I ordered from a site called CrabRevenge.com
[02:17:09.300 --> 02:17:13.300]  They send you crab, pubic lice in the mail
[02:17:13.300 --> 02:17:17.300]  And I've been putting it down the paths to these people who are groping me at the airport
[02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:19.300]  Giving them essentially crabs
[02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:23.300]  So as they grope me, I've been putting this basically wet sand
[02:17:23.300 --> 02:17:26.300]  I just kind of let that loose in their direction
[02:17:26.300 --> 02:17:28.300]  And I give them lice
[02:17:28.300 --> 02:17:31.300]  So when they get home that night, they have pubic lice
[02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:33.300]  So now I look forward to getting groped
[02:17:33.300 --> 02:17:36.300]  You can go to crabrevenge.com
[02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:40.300]  They send you for 20 bucks on pubic lice in the mail
[02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:43.300]  And you just use it at the airport and sprinkle it on the groper
[02:17:43.300 --> 02:17:45.300]  Is this a joke?
[02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:49.300]  This is what I've been doing, this is how I roll
[02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:53.300]  You know, when somebody is going to grope me, I'm going to give you lice
[02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:55.300]  I mean, if we're going to have sex, you're going to get crabs
[02:17:55.300 --> 02:17:58.300]  I was about to say, why is Herman Cain, if it's true, groping women
[02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:01.300]  He should be given a national security job
[02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:04.300]  Herman Cain on a work at the airport
[02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:05.300]  Exactly, so like
[02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:07.300]  Maybe he was checking her for a bomb
[02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:09.300]  How did he know she didn't have a weapon in there?
[02:18:09.300 --> 02:18:12.300]  You could see a CSA agent of your local
[02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:14.300]  He may have to do a proctology exam
[02:18:14.300 --> 02:18:17.300]  Maybe she's got a hand grenade in the upper, you know
[02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:21.300]  Yeah, so that's the way I've been responding to all this
[02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:26.300]  And, you know, it's cheap, it's a good little thank you note
[02:18:26.300 --> 02:18:30.300]  To the agents that are into this, and it's pretty effective
[02:18:32.300 --> 02:18:36.300]  Okay, I mean, what do you do then, delouse yourself when you get home?
[02:18:36.300 --> 02:18:41.300]  Oh, no, you know, it comes in a little plastic container
[02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:44.300]  So, and it's eggs, they haven't hatched yet
[02:18:44.300 --> 02:18:49.300]  So they're called nits, and they will hatch into pubic lice
[02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:51.300]  And it's a very little thing, they hardly have noticed it
[02:18:51.300 --> 02:18:54.300]  So they're just sloppy, they're not focusing on themselves
[02:18:54.300 --> 02:18:55.300]  They're focusing on me
[02:18:55.300 --> 02:18:57.300]  They're busy getting off on groping, and you just kind of open your hand
[02:18:57.300 --> 02:18:59.300]  And project them onto them?
[02:18:59.300 --> 02:19:01.300]  Yeah, just kind of let that slip, you know
[02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:04.300]  In any kind of open pocket or something
[02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:07.300]  And those pubic lice, they'll find their way to the pubic area
[02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:09.300]  And they'll have a case of crabs the next month
[02:19:09.300 --> 02:19:13.300]  Man, you're out of your mind, man
[02:19:13.300 --> 02:19:14.300]  Oh, god
[02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:17.300]  It's cheap, it's only 20 bucks, you got a crab revenge dot com
[02:19:17.300 --> 02:19:19.300]  Okay, stop it
[02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:23.300]  Kaiser, you're out of control, something tells me you're really doing this
[02:19:23.300 --> 02:19:25.300]  Well, you know what, they make everybody take their shoes off
[02:19:25.300 --> 02:19:27.300]  I never get athlete's foot since I played football
[02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:29.300]  Even at gyms I've worked out at
[02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:31.300]  I don't usually take a shower there, so I never get athlete's foot
[02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:33.300]  I go home and take a shower
[02:19:33.300 --> 02:19:34.300]  Back when I used to work out all the time
[02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:37.300]  The point is, I work out at home now, not much as you can tell
[02:19:37.300 --> 02:19:41.300]  The point is that now, every time I fly, I get athlete's foot
[02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:44.300]  I've got to put desinex on my feet when I get home
[02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:47.300]  Or I get athlete's foot, I got it flying through Vegas
[02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:49.300]  Thousands of people, it's filthy
[02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:51.300]  And the little creature, I forgot it
[02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:54.300]  I didn't even have him change his gloves when he was coming at me
[02:19:54.300 --> 02:19:57.300]  The MRSA, all of it, holy mackerel
[02:19:57.300 --> 02:20:08.300]  Here Max Kaiser, oh my gosh
[02:20:08.300 --> 02:20:11.300]  Greetings again, this is John Swenson at Midas Resources
[02:20:11.300 --> 02:20:13.300]  Your source for gold and silver
[02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:17.300]  You know, I have the same crystal ball you have when it comes to what's just around the corner
[02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:22.300]  But we both know that there's nothing on the financial horizon that looks very good
[02:20:22.300 --> 02:20:25.300]  The single measure of good news is that precious metals
[02:20:25.300 --> 02:20:28.300]  Continue to outperform everything else out there
[02:20:28.300 --> 02:20:30.300]  Right now is a time to take a hard look
[02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:33.300]  Pricing is more attractive now than it's been in many months
[02:20:33.300 --> 02:20:37.300]  Historically and traditionally, this is when prices rise the fastest
[02:20:37.300 --> 02:20:40.300]  They haven't, and opportunities knocking
[02:20:40.300 --> 02:20:45.300]  Please give me a call, 800-686-2237 extension 128

[02:20:58.300 --> 02:21:23.300]  Just make that call, thanks

[02:24:26.300 --> 02:24:28.300]  I mean, this has always been a planned implosion
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:33.300]  And every time they take down another country and get $5 trillion, as you said last week
[02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:35.300]  Now they need tens of trillions more
[02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:37.300]  And I guess there's just no end to it
[02:24:37.300 --> 02:24:42.300]  Now they've announced giant new taxes all over the US, all over Europe
[02:24:42.300 --> 02:24:46.300]  EU Gestapo going into the country, shaking people down
[02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:48.300]  I mean, this is a military takeover
[02:24:48.300 --> 02:24:50.300]  Yeah, well, a couple of points
[02:24:50.300 --> 02:24:55.300]  First of all, Crab Revenge was featured on the Jonathan Ross show in the UK
[02:24:55.300 --> 02:24:57.300]  He, it's very real
[02:24:57.300 --> 02:25:00.300]  And this has been around for a number of years
[02:25:00.300 --> 02:25:03.300]  It's also, there's a site called Dog Poop
[02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:08.300]  Where you can have vacuum packed dog poop sent to somebody as an act of revenge too
[02:25:08.300 --> 02:25:10.300]  That's enough
[02:25:10.300 --> 02:25:15.300]  No, there's a lot of these different sites that people can use to enact revenge
[02:25:15.300 --> 02:25:19.300]  But anyway, getting onto the economy in Europe
[02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:22.300]  As you can readily see
[02:25:22.300 --> 02:25:28.300]  In Greece, they've now put in a new leader who's in bed with the IMF and the bankers
[02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:32.300]  To allow the austerity to be imposed unimpeded
[02:25:32.300 --> 02:25:36.300]  And so this will just be the way
[02:25:36.300 --> 02:25:38.300]  I just came back from Ireland, Alex, as you know
[02:25:38.300 --> 02:25:41.300]  And the people there are really suffering
[02:25:41.300 --> 02:25:46.300]  The government, they're passing a new $3.8 billion austerity package
[02:25:46.300 --> 02:25:48.300]  They're getting rid of social services
[02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:53.300]  The people are, can't compete their homes and they're starving
[02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:55.300]  They can't feed themselves
[02:25:55.300 --> 02:26:00.300]  And then the government on the same week, they said they discovered $3.6 billion in an accounting error
[02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:04.300]  That they just found magically from some error they committed last year
[02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:06.300]  But the people don't get to keep that
[02:26:06.300 --> 02:26:08.300]  That's going into the pockets of the bankers
[02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:13.300]  And then of course, Ireland has closed, it's kind of an unrelated topic
[02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:19.300]  Ireland closed all of their embassies at the Vatican as part of a major pedophile scandal
[02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:21.300]  Involving Irish priests
[02:26:21.300 --> 02:26:23.300]  So everyone's quite upset about that
[02:26:23.300 --> 02:26:26.300]  So the country has really gone through a difficult time
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:29.300]  From both the Catholic Church and from the bankers
[02:26:29.300 --> 02:26:31.300]  Who believe they're doing God's work
[02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:35.300]  And the people are left both spiritually impoverished and financially impoverished
[02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:37.300]  Same thing in Greece
[02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:40.300]  The people are being absolutely hoodwinked
[02:26:40.300 --> 02:26:44.300]  To accepting austerity measures and leaving them without enough food to eat
[02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:46.300]  And now it's rolling into Italy
[02:26:46.300 --> 02:26:48.300]  And of course Spain, Portugal
[02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:50.300]  And now even in France where I live
[02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:53.300]  There's a new austerity package being announced
[02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:56.300]  And this isn't going over well at all
[02:26:58.300 --> 02:26:59.300]  So where does it go?
[02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:02.300]  I mean, the banksters who created the crisis are just going to steal everything
[02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:04.300]  And the police are going to stand by
[02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:07.300]  I have an article where police are telling protesters
[02:27:07.300 --> 02:27:09.300]  There is no constitution
[02:27:09.300 --> 02:27:12.300]  In court cases where they say, don't bring the constitution to my courtroom
[02:27:12.300 --> 02:27:16.300]  I mean, just because cops say driving or owning a gun is a privilege
[02:27:16.300 --> 02:27:20.300]  Or they say they have a right to grab your testicles for no reason
[02:27:20.300 --> 02:27:23.300]  I mean, does that just mean that they can do it?
[02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:27.300]  It's about this incredible level of debt
[02:27:27.300 --> 02:27:31.300]  That is never paid down
[02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:35.300]  Every new austerity measure and every new bailout
[02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:39.300]  Is accompanied by a new revelation of even more debt
[02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:43.300]  And this is what keeps going on and on
[02:27:43.300 --> 02:27:46.300]  And we know from other guests on your show
[02:27:46.300 --> 02:27:49.300]  That the total debts around the world are in the hundreds of trillions of dollars
[02:27:49.300 --> 02:27:52.300]  And most of those haven't even been revealed yet
[02:27:52.300 --> 02:27:56.300]  So this game of accept a austerity measure today
[02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:59.300]  To help the problem and then next week saying, oh wait a minute
[02:27:59.300 --> 02:28:02.300]  There's more debt so you have to accept more austerity measure
[02:28:02.300 --> 02:28:06.300]  This is just continuing and it can continue for several more years now
[02:28:06.300 --> 02:28:10.300]  Because there are literally hundreds of trillions of debt that have yet to be revealed
[02:28:10.300 --> 02:28:14.300]  And so the people are basically left with no recourse
[02:28:14.300 --> 02:28:17.300]  Because every time they introduce more austerity measures
[02:28:17.300 --> 02:28:21.300]  They also strip civil rights, they also, especially in the United States
[02:28:21.300 --> 02:28:22.300]  You see that all the time
[02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:25.300]  My god, I gotta stop you Curt Nimmel just came out with an article
[02:28:25.300 --> 02:28:29.300]  And they're announcing states all over the country, TSA is to be everywhere
[02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:32.300]  And they're so arrogant and they've got cops with guns
[02:28:32.300 --> 02:28:35.300]  And you pull up and they look at you like you're scum
[02:28:35.300 --> 02:28:36.300]  And I just can't handle it anymore
[02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:40.300]  I can't handle roid head, scum, anti-American filth
[02:28:40.300 --> 02:28:43.300]  Helping the government ship in narcotics and guns to Mexico
[02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:46.300]  A bunch of Nazi criminals everywhere
[02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:48.300]  Mike, what are they getting ready for?
[02:28:48.300 --> 02:28:52.300]  I guess the total collapse with a bunch of arrogant idiots
[02:28:52.300 --> 02:28:54.300]  Let me ask you kind of a thought exercise here
[02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:57.300]  I mean, Jesse Ventura was on about him leaving the country
[02:28:57.300 --> 02:29:00.300]  And forsaking or renouncing his US citizenship
[02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:04.300]  And this became, you know, a topic of discussion
[02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:07.300]  But my question is, what if Jesse Ventura had said
[02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:09.300]  I'm renouncing my US citizenship?
[02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:11.300]  Why is that controversial? Why?
[02:29:11.300 --> 02:29:13.300]  Tell me why that's controversial
[02:29:13.300 --> 02:29:15.300]  I don't get it, why is that controversial?
[02:29:15.300 --> 02:29:17.300]  No, no, they use it as a way to say he's not American
[02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:18.300]  But she didn't say that
[02:29:18.300 --> 02:29:20.300]  The point is these people are un-American
[02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:22.300]  Why would anyone want to be American?
[02:29:22.300 --> 02:29:26.300]  Why would anyone want to associate themselves with what's going on over there?
[02:29:26.300 --> 02:29:27.300]  In other words, you've got...
[02:29:27.300 --> 02:29:28.300]  It's where our families live
[02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:30.300]  It's where our...
[02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:33.300]  Nazi Germany, people said, oh, the Jews said, oh my God
[02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:34.300]  You know, it can't get any worse
[02:29:34.300 --> 02:29:37.300]  But like you said, Max, it's the New World Order
[02:29:37.300 --> 02:29:39.300]  Taking over America
[02:29:39.300 --> 02:29:41.300]  And stay there, stay there, we gotta go to break
[02:29:41.300 --> 02:29:42.300]  Alex, they got it
[02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:43.300]  We gotta go to break
[02:29:43.300 --> 02:29:46.300]  It's like the New World Order, that's why it's happening everywhere
[02:29:46.300 --> 02:29:47.300]  They're taking over
[02:29:47.300 --> 02:29:49.300]  The globalists are invading America
[02:29:49.300 --> 02:29:53.300]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run
[02:29:53.300 --> 02:29:57.300]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:30:01.300 --> 02:30:03.300]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones
[02:30:03.300 --> 02:30:08.300]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognized risk

[02:30:19.300 --> 02:30:22.300]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[02:30:22.300 --> 02:30:24.300]  That contain no useless dyes
[02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:27.300]  Perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials
[02:30:27.300 --> 02:30:30.300]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[02:30:30.300 --> 02:30:35.300]  That give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint
[02:30:35.300 --> 02:30:36.300]  If you want something better
[02:30:36.300 --> 02:30:38.300]  If you want something you've never had before
[02:30:38.300 --> 02:30:40.300]  You have to do something you've never done before

[02:31:05.300 --> 02:31:08.300]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:10.300]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[02:31:10.300 --> 02:31:14.300]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[02:31:14.300 --> 02:31:17.300]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[02:31:17.300 --> 02:31:20.300]  And they really are calling the shots
[02:31:20.300 --> 02:31:25.300]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[02:31:25.300 --> 02:31:28.300]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:31:28.300 --> 02:31:30.300]  The criminal offshore cartel
[02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:32.300]  Hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:31:32.300 --> 02:31:35.300]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[02:31:35.300 --> 02:31:37.300]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists
[02:31:37.300 --> 02:31:39.300]  They're asking for more matches
[02:31:39.300 --> 02:31:41.300]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:41.300 --> 02:31:43.300]  Today seems like nobody does care
[02:31:43.300 --> 02:31:48.300]  And right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic

[02:33:21.300 --> 02:33:23.300]  We have the news article
[02:33:23.300 --> 02:33:29.300]  More states accept TSA Viper teams at transportation hubs
[02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:33.300]  Accept them that they're just doing it
[02:33:33.300 --> 02:33:38.300]  The effort by the Department of Homeland Security and the TSA to expand their operations
[02:33:38.300 --> 02:33:41.300]  From airports to state roads and beyond
[02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:45.300]  Is being accepted by the states and local governments
[02:33:45.300 --> 02:33:48.300]  Actually they've told them no and they just say shut up we have weapons
[02:33:48.300 --> 02:33:51.300]  I mean federal police on the streets of America
[02:33:51.300 --> 02:33:55.300]  And they literally bug their eyes out and run around in a crazed manner
[02:33:55.300 --> 02:33:56.300]  It's really sick
[02:33:56.300 --> 02:33:58.300]  I'm not even intimidated by them
[02:33:58.300 --> 02:34:00.300]  I want to vomit a bunch of cowardly scum
[02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:04.300]  Working for a murdering narcotics trafficking banking cartel
[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:09.300]  The effort by the Department of Homeland Security and the TSA to expand their operations
[02:34:09.300 --> 02:34:11.300]  From airports to state roads and beyond
[02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:13.300]  Man the crooks are scared folks
[02:34:13.300 --> 02:34:15.300]  They know they brought the country down
[02:34:15.300 --> 02:34:18.300]  And they're really getting ready to clamp down and stop us bringing them to justice
[02:34:18.300 --> 02:34:21.300]  Basically a bunch of Bernie Madoff, Ken Leys were on the country
[02:34:21.300 --> 02:34:23.300]  What would you do if you'd done all the stuff they've done
[02:34:23.300 --> 02:34:26.300]  And they're taking houses on waterfronts that have been there 80 years
[02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:28.300]  They're taking homes they don't own
[02:34:28.300 --> 02:34:32.300]  Bank of America's taking houses they never had a deed to that are paid for
[02:34:32.300 --> 02:34:35.300]  And it's like look we got cops with weapons
[02:34:35.300 --> 02:34:37.300]  I mean that's what tyranny is
[02:34:37.300 --> 02:34:40.300]  But even few third world countries are this bad
[02:34:40.300 --> 02:34:42.300]  I mean this is crooks
[02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:45.300]  But all over the country cops take old ladies money out of their purse
[02:34:45.300 --> 02:34:47.300]  I mean why not it's just pure evil
[02:34:47.300 --> 02:34:49.300]  God this country is gone
[02:34:49.300 --> 02:34:53.300]  The effort by the Department of Homeland Security and the TSA to expand their operations
[02:34:53.300 --> 02:34:55.300]  From airports to state roads and beyond
[02:34:55.300 --> 02:34:57.300]  Is being accepted by state and local governments
[02:34:57.300 --> 02:34:59.300]  Around the country according to allgov.com
[02:34:59.300 --> 02:35:02.300]  The website covering government activity
[02:35:02.300 --> 02:35:05.300]  Allgov reports today that other states are quote
[02:35:05.300 --> 02:35:07.300]  Expecting to follow and accept
[02:35:07.300 --> 02:35:09.300]  Viper-visible intermodal prevention
[02:35:09.300 --> 02:35:12.300]  And response at their transportation hubs
[02:35:12.300 --> 02:35:14.300]  That means highways, bus stations, train stations
[02:35:14.300 --> 02:35:16.300]  Following recent operations in Tennessee
[02:35:16.300 --> 02:35:18.300]  They've had them for about five years all over the country
[02:35:18.300 --> 02:35:21.300]  They had Marines at these with firearms
[02:35:21.300 --> 02:35:24.300]  I've had US Army run up to me screaming at me
[02:35:24.300 --> 02:35:26.300]  I just said go ahead do whatever you're going to do punk
[02:35:26.300 --> 02:35:28.300]  They're like don't videotape me in the middle of New York
[02:35:28.300 --> 02:35:32.300]  The unconstitutional operations were not in response to any particular threat
[02:35:32.300 --> 02:35:34.300]  But rather you like always going to like that
[02:35:34.300 --> 02:35:38.300]  Designed to act as visible deterrence and detection security presence
[02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:41.300]  Across Tennessee as if terrorists that they've given Libya
[02:35:41.300 --> 02:35:43.300]  Are going to care about this
[02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:45.300]  They're going to look for these people to go after them
[02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:47.300]  Doesn't exist it's all staged
[02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:49.300]  In other words the operation was an effort
[02:35:49.300 --> 02:35:52.300]  To acclimate Tennesseans to militarize TSA units
[02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:54.300]  At checkpoints around the state
[02:35:54.300 --> 02:35:57.300]  And then it just goes on to break that down
[02:35:57.300 --> 02:36:00.300]  So Kurt Nemo's article is so important
[02:36:00.300 --> 02:36:04.300]  Okay you were getting into a fracas there
[02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:07.300]  As you were going up into the break and I was interrupting you
[02:36:07.300 --> 02:36:10.300]  Max Kaiser go ahead
[02:36:10.300 --> 02:36:15.300]  Oh yeah well we were discussing the merits
[02:36:15.300 --> 02:36:21.300]  Or lack thereof of leaving or renouncing the US citizenship
[02:36:21.300 --> 02:36:25.300]  And you know I really believe this is heading toward the incinerators
[02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:28.300]  There's going to be the final solution for poverty
[02:36:28.300 --> 02:36:30.300]  With 50 million people on food stamps
[02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:34.300]  You got more than 120 million Americans now at or below the poverty line
[02:36:34.300 --> 02:36:36.300]  That's a lot of bodies to feed
[02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:39.300]  Maybe Morgan can only print up so many food stamps
[02:36:39.300 --> 02:36:41.300]  So you're going to start incinerating people
[02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:43.300]  And of course after they skip out these people
[02:36:43.300 --> 02:36:45.300]  The poor people they'll say that they're evil
[02:36:45.300 --> 02:36:48.300]  They're terrorists they love getting grew up with the TSA
[02:36:48.300 --> 02:36:49.300]  And they're going to incinerate them
[02:36:49.300 --> 02:36:51.300]  It's that simple that's happened before
[02:36:51.300 --> 02:36:54.300]  The same people who are in charge then are in charge now
[02:36:54.300 --> 02:36:57.300]  And they know that it worked then and it'll work now in America
[02:36:57.300 --> 02:37:01.300]  And they're like oh we did build the emergency centers act
[02:37:01.300 --> 02:37:03.300]  We're trying to get more funding for it
[02:37:03.300 --> 02:37:06.300]  And Tura in the interview is like well why are there kids inside there
[02:37:06.300 --> 02:37:08.300]  And he goes they're happy children
[02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:13.300]  Well you know IBM was instrumental in the concentration camps in Germany
[02:37:13.300 --> 02:37:17.300]  JP Morgan funded the Nazi rise to power
[02:37:17.300 --> 02:37:22.300]  Coca-Cola created an orange flavored drink for the Nazis called Fanta
[02:37:22.300 --> 02:37:26.300]  That was Coca-Cola's orange Nazi drink at the time
[02:37:26.300 --> 02:37:29.300]  So American companies are well versed in incineration
[02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:32.300]  Well versed in mass execution and pogroms
[02:37:32.300 --> 02:37:35.300]  And when they can't feed anymore of these poor people in America
[02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:37.300]  They're going to burn them and that's as simple as that
[02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:41.300]  It worked before it'll work again if you don't want to get burned to death leave
[02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:44.300]  But you're saying and I've read it the same stuff's happening in Europe
[02:37:44.300 --> 02:37:47.300]  The same global banksters run it all
[02:37:47.300 --> 02:37:50.300]  Yeah, Europe's in bad shape
[02:37:50.300 --> 02:37:54.300]  But I believe countries like Brazil are probably interesting to look at
[02:37:54.300 --> 02:37:58.300]  Chile but he's definitely want to get out of the worst offenders
[02:37:58.300 --> 02:38:00.300]  And that would be the US and the UK
[02:38:00.300 --> 02:38:03.300]  These two countries have Nazi envy
[02:38:03.300 --> 02:38:08.300]  You know they go sit down every night and worship their Nazi gods
[02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:11.300]  And when they start burning people in these incinerators
[02:38:11.300 --> 02:38:13.300]  It'll be a total satisfaction for them
[02:38:13.300 --> 02:38:17.300]  So I don't feel like I'd like to get burned in an incinerator too
[02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:19.300]  For JP Morgan's bonus pool
[02:38:19.300 --> 02:38:21.300]  That's not what I'd like to do
[02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:24.300]  I'm trying to stay as far away as I possibly can
[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:27.300]  I was in New York for the first time in 15 years
[02:38:27.300 --> 02:38:32.300]  A few months ago and that was about as much time as I'd like to spend over there
[02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:34.300]  It's just too dangerous
[02:38:34.300 --> 02:38:37.300]  You know if you love your family you should protect them
[02:38:37.300 --> 02:38:41.300]  And that probably means getting the heck out of dodge
[02:38:41.300 --> 02:38:45.300]  Well they are setting up checkpoints and I remember going to urban warfare drills
[02:38:45.300 --> 02:38:48.300]  Right when they were getting rid of Glass-Steagall and gearing up for this
[02:38:48.300 --> 02:38:51.300]  And watching Marines training to take our guns
[02:38:51.300 --> 02:38:54.300]  And watching them train to take US citizens put them on their knees
[02:38:54.300 --> 02:38:56.300]  And shoot them in the back of the head
[02:38:56.300 --> 02:38:59.300]  And saw them police stay 2000 and people saw that
[02:38:59.300 --> 02:39:03.300]  And were so freaked out they accused me of having fake aircraft carriers land
[02:39:03.300 --> 02:39:06.300]  And hiring thousands of troops
[02:39:06.300 --> 02:39:09.300]  And people just couldn't believe it was real
[02:39:09.300 --> 02:39:14.300]  But the good news is the military is woken up
[02:39:14.300 --> 02:39:18.300]  The problem is they pick the crazies and the ones that want to pull triggers on Americans
[02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:21.300]  They psychologically test them and make them cops
[02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:27.300]  And it's weird I mean it's like somebody in make believe like one of my kids dresses up like a Superman or something
[02:39:27.300 --> 02:39:29.300]  And is running around jumping off the furniture
[02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:33.300]  I see these feds and cops now and they're like running around like they're in a movie
[02:39:33.300 --> 02:39:36.300]  Strutting and staring and bugging their eyes out at everyone
[02:39:36.300 --> 02:39:41.300]  And it's like hey lunatic you work for the people that bring the drugs in at stage 9-11
[02:39:41.300 --> 02:39:46.300]  You work for the terrorists I mean they just I can't I can't have punk coward scum
[02:39:46.300 --> 02:39:50.300]  Looking at me like I'm bad all day when they work for the murdering criminals and I know it
[02:39:50.300 --> 02:39:55.300]  Murdering scum, murdering film, murdering trash, terrorist killers of 9-11
[02:39:55.300 --> 02:39:59.300]  Setting up checkpoints everywhere I indict you, I indict you
[02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:03.300]  And if you're not evil and you're a cop then speak out against it like the police that have sent us
[02:40:03.300 --> 02:40:11.300]  The internal stuff where they say the homeland security thing is for veterans, gun owners, libertarians, conservatives in the fetters
[02:40:11.300 --> 02:40:15.300]  Of course it is, of course it is, I'm sorry go ahead Max
[02:40:15.300 --> 02:40:20.300]  No it's just going to be it's going to be very difficult to leave the United States
[02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:26.300]  Especially when everyone has a lien on them, when the debts are formally transferred
[02:40:26.300 --> 02:40:30.300]  Every American has a $300,000 debt hanging over their head
[02:40:30.300 --> 02:40:35.300]  And they will formalize that relationship legally in the courts so that you are personally responsible
[02:40:35.300 --> 02:40:39.300]  And you will not be able to leave that country until you do something about that $300,000
[02:40:39.300 --> 02:40:42.300]  By the way they're already starting the capital controls
[02:40:42.300 --> 02:40:48.300]  Now if you even have a couple silver coins they pull you over, scream at you, you're a Ron Paul supporter, they flip out
[02:40:48.300 --> 02:40:51.300]  I mean these are the new federal Gestapo
[02:40:51.300 --> 02:40:55.300]  Then they're just beginning the process of pinning you in
[02:40:55.300 --> 02:40:58.300]  So less than 10% of Americans even have a passport
[02:40:58.300 --> 02:41:03.300]  So if you're listening and you don't have even a passport, get yourself a passport
[02:41:03.300 --> 02:41:08.300]  So at least you can get on a plane and leave if you have to or need to
[02:41:08.300 --> 02:41:12.300]  And then from there there are things you should do like get a second passport
[02:41:12.300 --> 02:41:15.300]  Like Governor Jesse Ventura is talking about dual citizenship
[02:41:15.300 --> 02:41:18.300]  At least he has some protection there with two passports
[02:41:18.300 --> 02:41:21.300]  Everybody can do that if you put the work into it
[02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:24.300]  If you value your family and you value your life
[02:41:24.300 --> 02:41:29.300]  You need to have an exit strategy before they start turning the ovens on
[02:41:29.300 --> 02:41:35.300]  And marching people into the incinerator because they can't afford to keep the food stamps going anymore
[02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:38.300]  And I guess they just psychologically test these guys because I see Feds now
[02:41:38.300 --> 02:41:41.300]  And they literally are like a joke
[02:41:41.300 --> 02:41:44.300]  They're bugging their eyes out, strutting around in black uniforms
[02:41:44.300 --> 02:41:47.300]  Trying to intimidate you and I just instantly am like
[02:41:47.300 --> 02:41:50.300]  As a man like this is a criminal, this is a threat
[02:41:50.300 --> 02:41:53.300]  I mean I'm immediately, my instinct's like criminal, criminal
[02:41:53.300 --> 02:41:57.300]  I mean it's like a dog when it knows somebody's bad, it's like
[02:41:57.300 --> 02:42:00.300]  Who are, but they actually think they're good guys, it's real weird
[02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:05.300]  They think that they're Jack Bauer and your wife is the terrorist
[02:42:05.300 --> 02:42:10.300]  Look as you know every study going back many years shows that
[02:42:10.300 --> 02:42:12.300]  If you give people just a little bit of authority
[02:42:12.300 --> 02:42:17.300]  They tend to run with it and become a megalomaniacs very quickly
[02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:21.300]  And this is what happens when you give people who are not adequately trained
[02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:23.300]  A gun and a little bit of authority
[02:42:23.300 --> 02:42:27.300]  For now they're suddenly think that they are all powerful
[02:42:27.300 --> 02:42:32.300]  All knowing megalomaniacs and the obvious results are in place
[02:42:32.300 --> 02:42:35.300]  So this is not the way to build an economy
[02:42:35.300 --> 02:42:37.300]  It's not the way to secure a nation
[02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:41.300]  It's not the way to build good will and it's not the way to compete
[02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:46.300]  Nobody wins except the contractors and the mercenaries who finance the Gestapo in America
[02:42:46.300 --> 02:42:51.300]  And this is playing out in real time and nobody can doubt it at this point
[02:42:51.300 --> 02:42:56.300]  So again, if you value your life you need to figure out an exit strategy
[02:42:56.300 --> 02:43:01.300]  I'm going to stay with my wife and children and I'm going down with it
[02:43:01.300 --> 02:43:04.300]  And I'll be here warning people to the last minute
[02:43:04.300 --> 02:43:07.300]  And this is not Nazi Germany, this is not Russia
[02:43:07.300 --> 02:43:09.300]  And these people will be
[02:43:09.300 --> 02:43:11.300]  The Jews said the same thing Alex, all the way to the end
[02:43:11.300 --> 02:43:14.300]  They all were convinced that it couldn't get any worse
[02:43:14.300 --> 02:43:18.300]  And that somebody would save the day and it didn't work
[02:43:18.300 --> 02:43:21.300]  And 6 million were burned and slaughtered and killed
[02:43:21.300 --> 02:43:23.300]  Gypsies and Jews and homosexuals
[02:43:23.300 --> 02:43:27.300]  Now in America we've got about 30 or 40 million people on the chopping block
[02:43:27.300 --> 02:43:29.300]  They've got to go, we can't feed them anymore
[02:43:29.300 --> 02:43:31.300]  We don't have the money, too much debt
[02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:34.300]  And we need the final solution so they're going to get rid of them
[02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:36.300]  And if the same people in charge then are in charge now
[02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:39.300]  If you value your family you need to get out
[02:43:39.300 --> 02:43:42.300]  Now they're actually going to go after the middle class and rob everybody
[02:43:42.300 --> 02:43:44.300]  That's actually what the Nazis did
[02:43:44.300 --> 02:43:46.300]  Well that's the beginning though
[02:43:46.300 --> 02:43:49.300]  First these middle class people are in the new poverty
[02:43:49.300 --> 02:43:51.300]  They were middle class last year
[02:43:51.300 --> 02:43:53.300]  Now they're the poverty stricken
[02:43:53.300 --> 02:43:56.300]  And then they'll be called, you know, they're a biscuit to go to them
[02:43:56.300 --> 02:43:58.300]  Like, they're the terrorists, you're the terrorists
[02:43:58.300 --> 02:44:00.300]  You know, they get the propaganda machine running
[02:44:00.300 --> 02:44:04.300]  And then they get the people who are not yet being marched into the incineration camp
[02:44:04.300 --> 02:44:06.300]  To hate them, hate, hate
[02:44:06.300 --> 02:44:08.300]  And of course it'll all be for the greater good
[02:44:08.300 --> 02:44:12.300]  But I mean it's such a joke when you pull up to a checkpoint in the middle of the country
[02:44:12.300 --> 02:44:16.300]  And there's troops and cops and TSA potbellies directing them
[02:44:16.300 --> 02:44:18.300]  And they're bugging their eyes out of you
[02:44:18.300 --> 02:44:22.300]  State police have got drill sergeant hats on with their eyes all slit
[02:44:22.300 --> 02:44:24.300]  Looking at you like, like they're gun slingers
[02:44:24.300 --> 02:44:27.300]  You know, they're with your kids and they march over and order you around
[02:44:27.300 --> 02:44:29.300]  And I'm just, I can't take it anymore
[02:44:29.300 --> 02:44:33.300]  I'm like, no, you're drug dealers, the government's criminal, I don't care anymore
[02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:35.300]  I can't take it anymore
[02:44:35.300 --> 02:44:39.300]  I can't take it, I can't take it, I can't take them anymore
[02:44:39.300 --> 02:44:43.300]  They're terrorists, they're murderers, they're drug traffickers
[02:44:43.300 --> 02:44:47.300]  They're scum, they're Nazi commie absolute filth
[02:44:47.300 --> 02:44:50.300]  I see them and I'm calling them out
[02:44:50.300 --> 02:44:51.300]  That's what I'm saying
[02:44:51.300 --> 02:44:55.300]  Now I predict this, that with a very short period of time
[02:44:55.300 --> 02:44:59.300]  You're gonna find people tagged with the GPS monitor
[02:44:59.300 --> 02:45:02.300]  Which will be the equivalent of the Star of David
[02:45:02.300 --> 02:45:05.300]  Remember in Nazi Germany, they had to wear the yellow Star of David
[02:45:05.300 --> 02:45:08.300]  They've already tagged your cell phone, your name, your face scan
[02:45:08.300 --> 02:45:10.300]  That's right, so isn't that the exact same thing
[02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:13.300]  As being tagged by Nazi Germany with the yellow Star of David
[02:45:13.300 --> 02:45:17.300]  They have tagged you on your GPS monitor as undesirable
[02:45:17.300 --> 02:45:20.300]  That's another major step toward marching people into the investigation
[02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:22.300]  Listen, I was flying to Austin a few weeks ago
[02:45:22.300 --> 02:45:25.300]  And I thought it was a joke, a gray-haired TSA guy goes
[02:45:25.300 --> 02:45:27.300]  One guy goes, hey, Alex, like your show
[02:45:27.300 --> 02:45:28.300]  And I'm going, okay
[02:45:28.300 --> 02:45:30.300]  And the other guy goes, this guy's a troublemaker
[02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:31.300]  And tried to intimidate me
[02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:33.300]  And it was like a little kid, but they're acting tough
[02:45:33.300 --> 02:45:34.300]  This guy's a troublemaker
[02:45:34.300 --> 02:45:35.300]  And he did this look at me
[02:45:35.300 --> 02:45:37.300]  He could tell the guy was just a sack of wheat garbage
[02:45:37.300 --> 02:45:39.300]  And I just, I thought it was a joke
[02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:40.300]  And I was like, huh?
[02:45:40.300 --> 02:45:42.300]  And he was like, yeah, where you going?
[02:45:42.300 --> 02:45:44.300]  And I was just like, ha, ha, ha, ha
[02:45:44.300 --> 02:45:46.300]  You are a sack of trash
[02:45:46.300 --> 02:45:48.300]  You are a cowardly worm
[02:45:48.300 --> 02:45:50.300]  You must have a hellish life
[02:45:50.300 --> 02:45:52.300]  You can't get a woman, I guarantee it
[02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:53.300]  You're a loser
[02:45:53.300 --> 02:45:55.300]  You'll always be a loser no matter what
[02:45:55.300 --> 02:45:57.300]  Anybody says you were born a loser
[02:45:57.300 --> 02:45:58.300]  And you are a loser
[02:45:58.300 --> 02:46:00.300]  And you're an American filth
[02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:01.300]  And we're going to take this country back
[02:46:01.300 --> 02:46:03.300]  And you're going to be brought to justice
[02:46:03.300 --> 02:46:05.300]  Along with your banker bosses
[02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:09.300]  Well, you know, the victims, again, of Nazis
[02:46:09.300 --> 02:46:11.300]  Were citizens of Germany
[02:46:11.300 --> 02:46:13.300]  They were full-fledged citizens
[02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:17.300]  With a huge long-term history
[02:46:17.300 --> 02:46:19.300]  Adding to society
[02:46:19.300 --> 02:46:21.300]  Fighting in the wars
[02:46:21.300 --> 02:46:23.300]  Being part of the community
[02:46:23.300 --> 02:46:26.300]  But suddenly because the powers that be
[02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:28.300]  Needed a bunch of money to fund
[02:46:28.300 --> 02:46:30.300]  Their overseas military adventures
[02:46:30.300 --> 02:46:32.300]  It wasn't Afghanistan or Iraq
[02:46:32.300 --> 02:46:34.300]  Or Bahrain or another
[02:46:34.300 --> 02:46:38.300]  It was Poland and France and other kind of time
[02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:39.300]  And they needed that money
[02:46:39.300 --> 02:46:42.300]  So they said, you know, we're going to seize all your money
[02:46:42.300 --> 02:46:45.300]  We're going to put you a little star on your arm
[02:46:45.300 --> 02:46:46.300]  Or on your arm
[02:46:46.300 --> 02:46:48.300]  And then when we can't feed you anymore
[02:46:48.300 --> 02:46:49.300]  And get the slave labor from you
[02:46:49.300 --> 02:46:51.300]  We can't feed our prisons anymore
[02:46:51.300 --> 02:46:53.300]  We're going to incinerate you
[02:46:53.300 --> 02:46:54.300]  Now that's the exact progression
[02:46:54.300 --> 02:46:55.300]  We're going to see in the US
[02:46:55.300 --> 02:46:57.300]  By the way, they admit homeland security
[02:46:57.300 --> 02:46:59.300]  Has actually ordered giant body incinerators
[02:46:59.300 --> 02:47:01.300]  That's been in the news
[02:47:01.300 --> 02:47:03.300]  It was in the, it was in the, it was in the
[02:47:03.300 --> 02:47:04.300]  For a weenie roast?
[02:47:04.300 --> 02:47:05.300]  Were they going to cook their weenies out there
[02:47:05.300 --> 02:47:07.300]  And have a marshmallow roast?
[02:47:07.300 --> 02:47:09.300]  I'm not, I'm not joking
[02:47:09.300 --> 02:47:10.300]  It was in the Rocky Mountain News
[02:47:10.300 --> 02:47:11.300]  Before it closed down
[02:47:11.300 --> 02:47:12.300]  It was about eight, nine years ago
[02:47:12.300 --> 02:47:13.300]  That Homeland Security
[02:47:13.300 --> 02:47:15.300]  They said for doing bio attacks
[02:47:15.300 --> 02:47:20.300]  Has ordered a bunch of big industrial incinerators
[02:47:20.300 --> 02:47:22.300]  Look, there's too many people
[02:47:22.300 --> 02:47:24.300]  On food stamps in America
[02:47:24.300 --> 02:47:27.300]  So 50 million, J.P. Morgan runs the program
[02:47:27.300 --> 02:47:29.300]  They funded through deficit spending
[02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:31.300]  But as you know, J.P. Morgan's balance sheets
[02:47:31.300 --> 02:47:32.300]  About to blow up
[02:47:32.300 --> 02:47:34.300]  And the same thing with Goldman Sachs
[02:47:34.300 --> 02:47:36.300]  Is about to blow up this company
[02:47:36.300 --> 02:47:38.300]  That's global, that was run by an ex-Goldman
[02:47:38.300 --> 02:47:40.300]  Sachs guy, John Corzine
[02:47:40.300 --> 02:47:42.300]  He leveraged the company up 50 to 1
[02:47:42.300 --> 02:47:43.300]  Blew it up
[02:47:43.300 --> 02:47:45.300]  Yeah, but America's waking up
[02:47:45.300 --> 02:47:46.300]  Europe's waking up
[02:47:46.300 --> 02:47:48.300]  Burlesone had to resign
[02:47:48.300 --> 02:47:50.300]  I don't see them getting away with all of this
[02:47:50.300 --> 02:47:52.300]  I think we should have faith here
[02:47:52.300 --> 02:47:53.300]  And stare them down
[02:47:53.300 --> 02:47:54.300]  Who's going to prison?
[02:47:54.300 --> 02:47:55.300]  Who's going to prison?
[02:47:55.300 --> 02:47:57.300]  Nobody, Bernie Madoff
[02:47:57.300 --> 02:47:58.300]  You know, he went to prison
[02:47:58.300 --> 02:48:00.300]  But other than that, unlike the 1980s
[02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:04.300]  Over 1500 bankers went to prison
[02:48:04.300 --> 02:48:07.300]  William Black's investigation
[02:48:07.300 --> 02:48:09.300]  Putting those bankers behind bars
[02:48:09.300 --> 02:48:12.300]  This time, the situation is 60 times worse
[02:48:12.300 --> 02:48:14.300]  And so far we've had maybe one guy
[02:48:14.300 --> 02:48:16.300]  Go to prison, Bernie Madoff, that's it
[02:48:16.300 --> 02:48:19.300]  There's no FBI staffing doing this
[02:48:19.300 --> 02:48:21.300]  When they were pursuing the S&L crisis
[02:48:21.300 --> 02:48:24.300]  They had over 2000 FBI agents here
[02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:26.300]  They've got less than 20 FBI agents
[02:48:26.300 --> 02:48:28.300]  Something on the order of that, a scale
[02:48:28.300 --> 02:48:30.300]  They're not even going after these guys
[02:48:30.300 --> 02:48:32.300]  There's no retribution for these guys
[02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:34.300]  They are laughing, you know, the traders in Chicago
[02:48:34.300 --> 02:48:35.300]  Stick their head out the window
[02:48:35.300 --> 02:48:37.300]  What the Occupy Chicago movement
[02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:39.300]  They throw applications to McDonald's
[02:48:39.300 --> 02:48:41.300]  Down on their protest
[02:48:41.300 --> 02:48:43.300]  Not signaling that the CME
[02:48:43.300 --> 02:48:45.300]  And the Chicago Board of Exchange
[02:48:45.300 --> 02:48:46.300]  Were caught last week red-handed
[02:48:46.300 --> 02:48:49.300]  Defrauding customers, co-mingling accounts
[02:48:49.300 --> 02:48:52.300]  Manipulating markets, stealing
[02:48:52.300 --> 02:48:54.300]  Aggregiously from the system
[02:48:54.300 --> 02:48:55.300]  And from all their accounts
[02:48:55.300 --> 02:48:57.300]  And these are the people
[02:48:57.300 --> 02:48:59.300]  That are telling the Occupy Wall Street movement
[02:48:59.300 --> 02:49:00.300]  On the street to go get a job
[02:49:00.300 --> 02:49:02.300]  These people are committing massive fraud
[02:49:02.300 --> 02:49:03.300]  Every single day
[02:49:03.300 --> 02:49:05.300]  I know, but now they're announcing
[02:49:05.300 --> 02:49:06.300]  They're going to crack down
[02:49:06.300 --> 02:49:08.300]  He's a major fraudster
[02:49:08.300 --> 02:49:10.300]  Gary Gensler at the CFTC
[02:49:10.300 --> 02:49:11.300]  This SEC is caught
[02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:13.300]  And basically engaged in massive fraud
[02:49:13.300 --> 02:49:14.300]  Every single day
[02:49:14.300 --> 02:49:15.300]  What about the announcement today?
[02:49:15.300 --> 02:49:17.300]  Let me stop you for a minute
[02:49:17.300 --> 02:49:20.300]  It's coming out here in Reuters
[02:49:20.300 --> 02:49:22.300]  Bank of America preparing for Chapter 11
[02:49:22.300 --> 02:49:25.300]  And they say it looks like they may be preparing for it
[02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:27.300]  And they've moved that $79 trillion in derivatives
[02:49:27.300 --> 02:49:29.300]  Over to the FDIC
[02:49:29.300 --> 02:49:31.300]  So I guess we're going to have to pay for that
[02:49:31.300 --> 02:49:32.300]  But that's not welfare
[02:49:32.300 --> 02:49:33.300]  That's $79 trillion
[02:49:33.300 --> 02:49:34.300]  That's right
[02:49:34.300 --> 02:49:35.300]  That's $79 trillion in debt
[02:49:35.300 --> 02:49:37.300]  That's moved from the Investment Bank
[02:49:37.300 --> 02:49:39.300]  Merrill Lynch that took these outrageous bets
[02:49:39.300 --> 02:49:40.300]  That lost
[02:49:40.300 --> 02:49:41.300]  They put it on to the taxpayer
[02:49:41.300 --> 02:49:42.300]  And now it's to bail that out
[02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:43.300]  That's what I'm saying, Alex
[02:49:43.300 --> 02:49:44.300]  That's $79 trillion
[02:49:44.300 --> 02:49:47.300]  The entire GDP of America is $13 trillion
[02:49:47.300 --> 02:49:49.300]  How is the population of $310?
[02:49:49.300 --> 02:49:50.300]  And the cops don't care
[02:49:50.300 --> 02:49:51.300]  The bureaucrats don't care
[02:49:51.300 --> 02:49:53.300]  They think they're going to squeeze enough money
[02:49:53.300 --> 02:49:55.300]  Out of the public to keep this going
[02:49:55.300 --> 02:49:56.300]  And then they're going to wake up
[02:49:56.300 --> 02:49:58.300]  In a destroyed country
[02:49:58.300 --> 02:49:59.300]  They won't care
[02:49:59.300 --> 02:50:01.300]  They're still going to have that uniform
[02:50:01.300 --> 02:50:02.300]  And get to waddle around
[02:50:02.300 --> 02:50:04.300]  They can't squeeze until they can't squeeze anymore
[02:50:04.300 --> 02:50:05.300]  And then they're going to burn them
[02:50:05.300 --> 02:50:06.300]  That's the end game
[02:50:06.300 --> 02:50:07.300]  By the way, that's in the news
[02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:09.300]  Guess what's happening with this TSA?
[02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:10.300]  They're announcing
[02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:12.300]  They're going to lay off federal marshals
[02:50:12.300 --> 02:50:14.300]  And all these other people that are, from my experience
[02:50:14.300 --> 02:50:16.300]  More professional, kindly and trained
[02:50:16.300 --> 02:50:18.300]  And people are actually commenting on this in the article
[02:50:18.300 --> 02:50:20.300]  But I've already seen it in the news
[02:50:20.300 --> 02:50:23.300]  And they're actually hiring Goon Brownshirt TSA
[02:50:23.300 --> 02:50:25.300]  But they're going to give them machine guns
[02:50:25.300 --> 02:50:27.300]  They're not even sworn officers
[02:50:27.300 --> 02:50:30.300]  They're going to start arming these little punks
[02:50:30.300 --> 02:50:34.300]  Well, I'd go along, you know, machine gun manufacturers
[02:50:34.300 --> 02:50:35.300]  And prison operators
[02:50:35.300 --> 02:50:36.300]  Like Corrections Corps of America
[02:50:36.300 --> 02:50:37.300]  On your show last year
[02:50:37.300 --> 02:50:39.300]  I said buy the stock in the low teens
[02:50:39.300 --> 02:50:40.300]  I think it's doubled since then
[02:50:40.300 --> 02:50:43.300]  You want to take advantage of the casino Gulag
[02:50:43.300 --> 02:50:44.300]  That is America
[02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:47.300]  Buy these stocks that profit directly
[02:50:47.300 --> 02:50:49.300]  From the concentration camp
[02:50:49.300 --> 02:50:51.300]  Well, that's the next thing
[02:50:51.300 --> 02:50:53.300]  They're going to fire most the cops
[02:50:53.300 --> 02:50:54.300]  So just get ready for that
[02:50:54.300 --> 02:50:55.300]  They're going to have just nothing
[02:50:55.300 --> 02:50:57.300]  Just psycho guns running around
[02:50:57.300 --> 02:50:58.300]  Well, they ride back
[02:50:58.300 --> 02:51:27.300]  Calls straight out with Max Geyser
[02:51:29.300 --> 02:51:31.300]  And helps with weight loss
[02:51:31.300 --> 02:51:33.300]  Is non-toxic, caffeine free
[02:51:33.300 --> 02:51:35.300]  100% natural, 100% organic
[02:51:35.300 --> 02:51:38.300]  And comes with a 100% money back guarantee
[02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:40.300]  Waiting for the side effects disclaimers
[02:51:40.300 --> 02:51:43.300]  With MDS Forte, there are none
[02:51:43.300 --> 02:51:45.300]  Order a 25-day treatment of MDS Forte
[02:51:45.300 --> 02:51:49.300]  By calling 213-405-5355
[02:51:49.300 --> 02:51:53.300]  213-405-5355
[02:51:53.300 --> 02:51:55.300]  Or visit bestbloodsupport.com
[02:51:55.300 --> 02:51:57.300]  That's bestbloodsupport.com
[02:51:57.300 --> 02:52:00.300]  For MDS Forte, a diabetes breakthrough
[02:52:27.300 --> 02:52:30.300]  The video on 123survivalplan.com
[02:52:30.300 --> 02:52:33.300]  Has crucial information you and your family need
[02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:36.300]  To prepare for any disaster, natural or man-made
[02:52:36.300 --> 02:52:39.300]  And you won't have to be afraid of going hungry
[02:52:39.300 --> 02:52:41.300]  For being sent to a FEMA refugee camp
[02:52:41.300 --> 02:52:44.300]  See the video that over one million other smart patriots
[02:52:44.300 --> 02:52:47.300]  Have already seen in the last four months
[02:52:47.300 --> 02:52:48.300]  Prepared now
[02:52:48.300 --> 02:52:50.300]  Go to 123survivalplan.com
[02:52:50.300 --> 02:52:54.300]  And learn which 37 food items you should hoard
[02:52:54.300 --> 02:52:57.300]  To remember 123survivalplan.com
[02:52:57.300 --> 02:53:00.300]  Again, that's 123survivalplan.com
[02:53:03.300 --> 02:53:05.300]  Folks, have you lost your power
[02:53:05.300 --> 02:53:07.300]  And wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:10.300]  If so, this is going to be the most important message
[02:53:10.300 --> 02:53:11.300]  You'll ever hear
[02:53:11.300 --> 02:53:13.300]  Because there's never been a better time
[02:53:13.300 --> 02:53:15.300]  To get ready for the winter power outages ahead
[02:53:15.300 --> 02:53:16.300]  Here's why
[02:53:16.300 --> 02:53:19.300]  Solar power generators are now available
[02:53:19.300 --> 02:53:21.300]  From our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:53:21.300 --> 02:53:22.300]  One of our oldest sponsors
[02:53:22.300 --> 02:53:24.300]  Their emergency backup systems
[02:53:24.300 --> 02:53:26.300]  Provide life-saving electrical power
[02:53:26.300 --> 02:53:27.300]  When you need it most
[02:53:27.300 --> 02:53:30.300]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly
[02:53:30.300 --> 02:53:33.300]  Amids no fumes and produces electricity from the sun
[02:53:33.300 --> 02:53:35.300]  It's like having an electric power plant
[02:53:35.300 --> 02:53:37.300]  Running quietly in your own own
[02:53:37.300 --> 02:53:40.300]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts
[02:53:40.300 --> 02:53:43.300]  You'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again
[02:53:43.300 --> 02:53:45.300]  When the power goes out this winter
[02:53:45.300 --> 02:53:47.300]  You'll be ready with a solar power generator

[02:54:05.300 --> 02:54:08.300]  Folks, they cunningly sold the good old boys
[02:54:08.300 --> 02:54:11.300]  On the fact this whole police state was for Arabs
[02:54:11.300 --> 02:54:14.300]  And manipulated them through racial issues
[02:54:14.300 --> 02:54:17.300]  Behind the scenes, it was always for the American people
[02:54:17.300 --> 02:54:19.300]  It was a receivership takeover
[02:54:19.300 --> 02:54:21.300]  Our more than five minutes of overdrive with Max Keiser
[02:54:21.300 --> 02:54:23.300]  As we go to a few of your calls
[02:54:23.300 --> 02:54:26.300]  We did the money bomb last week
[02:54:26.300 --> 02:54:28.300]  It's still running a little bit today
[02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:29.300]  I want to hit a 400,000
[02:54:29.300 --> 02:54:31.300]  I want to thank all of you that have done what you've done
[02:54:31.300 --> 02:54:33.300]  I look at Red Macones giving $6 million
[02:54:33.300 --> 02:54:35.300]  To a local college football team
[02:54:35.300 --> 02:54:37.300]  So they can have better equipment
[02:54:37.300 --> 02:54:39.300]  I don't want little old ladies who don't have money donating to us
[02:54:39.300 --> 02:54:41.300]  We can hire more reporters and do more here
[02:54:41.300 --> 02:54:43.300]  In the face of this risk in our lives
[02:54:43.300 --> 02:54:45.300]  It's middle class and wealthy people
[02:54:45.300 --> 02:54:47.300]  I don't know about what's happening
[02:54:47.300 --> 02:54:49.300]  There's no better place to support us by buying the books
[02:54:49.300 --> 02:54:51.300]  The videos are just flat out donating at

[02:54:53.300 --> 02:54:55.300]  And this is all about a mission
[02:54:55.300 --> 02:54:57.300]  I mean, I slept an hour and a half last night
[02:54:57.300 --> 02:54:59.300]  I was on Coast to Coast AM
[02:54:59.300 --> 02:55:01.300]  Didn't go to sleep till 5
[02:55:01.300 --> 02:55:03.300]  Got about 6.37 kids jumping on me
[02:55:03.300 --> 02:55:05.300]  Coming to the bedroom and stuff, you know how they do
[02:55:05.300 --> 02:55:07.300]  I'm not complaining
[02:55:07.300 --> 02:55:09.300]  We'll have the nightly news tonight at 7 o'clock
[02:55:09.300 --> 02:55:11.300]  Presentplanet.tv
[02:55:11.300 --> 02:55:13.300]  You heard Keiser, you hear everybody else
[02:55:13.300 --> 02:55:15.300]  Everybody knows this is not a game
[02:55:15.300 --> 02:55:17.300]  I mean, they're announcing world government
[02:55:17.300 --> 02:55:19.300]  Max, I want to go to calls here with you
[02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:21.300]  And I appreciate all your time, Max Keiser.com
[02:55:21.300 --> 02:55:23.300]  But what do you make of the Vatican
[02:55:23.300 --> 02:55:25.300]  Coming out and calling for world government
[02:55:25.300 --> 02:55:27.300]  World currency
[02:55:27.300 --> 02:55:29.300]  And then meanwhile we get demonized
[02:55:29.300 --> 02:55:31.300]  If we talk about the internal documents that are public
[02:55:31.300 --> 02:55:33.300]  Where these corporations that engineered
[02:55:33.300 --> 02:55:35.300]  All those want world government
[02:55:35.300 --> 02:55:37.300]  A global private banking dictatorship
[02:55:37.300 --> 02:55:39.300]  Well, the Pope's got penis on me
[02:55:39.300 --> 02:55:41.300]  Alex, because Lloyd Blackfine
[02:55:41.300 --> 02:55:43.300]  And if Goldman Sachs came down and said that
[02:55:43.300 --> 02:55:45.300]  He's doing God's work
[02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:47.300]  The Pope immediately said, wait a minute
[02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:49.300]  No, I'm the Vatican, I should be doing God's work
[02:55:49.300 --> 02:55:51.300]  So he's going to start a global bank
[02:55:51.300 --> 02:55:53.300]  And a global hedge fund to complete
[02:55:53.300 --> 02:55:55.300]  With Lloyd Blackfine, so it's a weenie-waving contest
[02:55:55.300 --> 02:55:57.300]  Between the Vatican
[02:55:57.300 --> 02:55:59.300]  And Goldman Sachs
[02:55:59.300 --> 02:56:01.300]  Because at the heart of all these scandals
[02:56:01.300 --> 02:56:03.300]  Are a couple of inadequate little boys
[02:56:03.300 --> 02:56:05.300]  Playing with their peonies
[02:56:05.300 --> 02:56:07.300]  That's enough, Keiser Family Show
[02:56:07.300 --> 02:56:09.300]  Give them a big kiss
[02:56:09.300 --> 02:56:11.300]  That's enough, come on man
[02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:13.300]  You're a serious stockbroker
[02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:15.300]  Financial guy, you're out of...
[02:56:15.300 --> 02:56:17.300]  Let's call up a major scandal in Ireland
[02:56:17.300 --> 02:56:19.300]  For pedophilia
[02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:21.300]  The Irish government had to take their embassies out of the Vatican
[02:56:21.300 --> 02:56:23.300]  They're caught up in this global pedophilia scandal
[02:56:23.300 --> 02:56:25.300]  The Pope says nothing
[02:56:25.300 --> 02:56:27.300]  The Murphy report is clear that they're
[02:56:27.300 --> 02:56:29.300]  Engaging in pedophilia all over the world
[02:56:29.300 --> 02:56:31.300]  That Vatican says nothing
[02:56:31.300 --> 02:56:33.300]  Then they're going to start a world bank
[02:56:33.300 --> 02:56:35.300]  And a world currency, why? Because Lloyd Blackfine
[02:56:35.300 --> 02:56:37.300]  Said he was doing God's work
[02:56:37.300 --> 02:56:39.300]  Maybe that Pope is
[02:56:39.300 --> 02:56:41.300]  He should be put over somebody's lap
[02:56:41.300 --> 02:56:43.300]  And spanked
[02:56:43.300 --> 02:56:45.300]  All right, Keiser, you're out of control
[02:56:45.300 --> 02:56:47.300]  I apologize for Keiser's activities
[02:56:47.300 --> 02:56:49.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, please
[02:56:49.300 --> 02:56:51.300]  Plug your ears, we try not to
[02:56:51.300 --> 02:56:53.300]  Okay, let's take a call here
[02:56:53.300 --> 02:56:55.300]  Thanks for holding, we'll go to Daniel
[02:56:55.300 --> 02:56:57.300]  But let's go to Jim in Washington
[02:56:57.300 --> 02:56:59.300]  No, no, no, Justin in Washington
[02:56:59.300 --> 02:57:01.300]  You're on the air, go ahead sir
[02:57:01.300 --> 02:57:03.300]  I'm on the air with Max Keiser
[02:57:03.300 --> 02:57:05.300]  Hey, what's up? Alex, love your show
[02:57:05.300 --> 02:57:07.300]  I heard a word out to Jesse Ventura
[02:57:07.300 --> 02:57:09.300]  We love you, man, we appreciate what you're doing
[02:57:09.300 --> 02:57:11.300]  And I just thought of a
[02:57:11.300 --> 02:57:13.300]  Campaign ad for TSA
[02:57:13.300 --> 02:57:15.300]  To hurt against them, but
[02:57:15.300 --> 02:57:17.300]  TSA stops groping people, the Vatican hits
[02:57:17.300 --> 02:57:19.300]  Competition
[02:57:19.300 --> 02:57:21.300]  Okay
[02:57:21.300 --> 02:57:23.300]  All the day, okay, go ahead sir
[02:57:23.300 --> 02:57:25.300]  Yeah
[02:57:27.300 --> 02:57:29.300]  The whole TSA situation is
[02:57:29.300 --> 02:57:31.300]  I've been on for hours
[02:57:31.300 --> 02:57:33.300]  Over an hour now, I'm kind of
[02:57:33.300 --> 02:57:35.300]  Just a bit interesting
[02:57:37.300 --> 02:57:39.300]  What more can we do to help
[02:57:39.300 --> 02:57:41.300]  Get the movement going against the TSA
[02:57:41.300 --> 02:57:43.300]  Of course they're one of the
[02:57:43.300 --> 02:57:45.300]  You should call restaurant association
[02:57:45.300 --> 02:57:47.300]  The hotel associations, everybody
[02:57:47.300 --> 02:57:49.300]  And say, I'm not traveling
[02:57:49.300 --> 02:57:51.300]  To your town, I'm not going on
[02:57:51.300 --> 02:57:53.300]  Your trip, and by the way
[02:57:53.300 --> 02:57:55.300]  They've doubled the amount of people on buses now
[02:57:55.300 --> 02:57:57.300]  Now the TSA is like, no, we're going to grab
[02:57:57.300 --> 02:57:59.300]  Your daughter's genitals and your wife's
[02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:01.300]  Genitals and your son's genitals
[02:58:01.300 --> 02:58:03.300]  You're not escaping us
[02:58:03.300 --> 02:58:05.300]  We're here to force our ourselves on you
[02:58:05.300 --> 02:58:07.300]  We're scum
[02:58:07.300 --> 02:58:09.300]  It's just such a joke
[02:58:09.300 --> 02:58:11.300]  Anybody who doubts the government
[02:58:11.300 --> 02:58:13.300]  Stages the terror attacks, look at it
[02:58:13.300 --> 02:58:15.300]  Look what they've done
[02:58:15.300 --> 02:58:17.300]  It's incredible
[02:58:17.300 --> 02:58:19.300]  But
[02:58:19.300 --> 02:58:21.300]  Let everybody know, they know 40
[02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:23.300]  Billions being lost, but keep poking
[02:58:23.300 --> 02:58:25.300]  At industries that are dying
[02:58:25.300 --> 02:58:27.300]  You heard Max, you heard Ventura
[02:58:27.300 --> 02:58:29.300]  It's in the news, Europeans won't
[02:58:29.300 --> 02:58:31.300]  Come here, I can, I have to
[02:58:31.300 --> 02:58:33.300]  I'm trying to make Paul Watson come here
[02:58:33.300 --> 02:58:35.300]  For a business meeting, and he keeps begging
[02:58:35.300 --> 02:58:37.300]  Please no, don't make me, don't make me go through it
[02:58:37.300 --> 02:58:39.300]  Don't make me go there, they're so
[02:58:39.300 --> 02:58:41.300]  It's like Nazi Germany
[02:58:43.300 --> 02:58:45.300]  Thank you for listening to GCN
[02:58:45.300 --> 02:58:47.300]  Visit GCNlive.com
[02:58:47.300 --> 02:58:59.300]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:58:59.300 --> 02:59:01.300]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:59:01.300 --> 02:59:07.300]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:59:07.300 --> 02:59:10.300]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:59:10.300 --> 02:59:12.300]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:59:12.300 --> 02:59:18.300]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:59:18.300 --> 02:59:22.300]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:59:22.300 --> 02:59:29.300]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:59:29.300 --> 02:59:33.300]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:59:33.300 --> 02:59:37.300]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:59:37.300 --> 02:59:43.300]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America.
[02:59:43.300 --> 02:59:51.300]  The number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:59:51.300 --> 02:59:59.300]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:59.300 --> 03:00:16.300]  Look, I liken it to one of those old 1930s or 40s action-adventure movies that Indiana Jones is a redo of.
[03:00:16.300 --> 03:00:29.300]  Where the archaeologists explore are stuck in the pyramid and the sand's coming in, or the water's coming in, and it's going up, and it was at our feet, and I'm like, we better get out of here now.
[03:00:29.300 --> 03:00:36.300]  It's at our chest and at our necks. Now, we're up in a little corner trying to get air. I'm like, folks, I assure you, this is historic.
[03:00:36.300 --> 03:00:42.300]  Max, is that a good analogy for the tyranny level we're going into?
[03:00:42.300 --> 03:01:01.300]  Right, it's the Boiling Frog Syndrome. The Boiling Frog is sitting in the pot with the water, and the heat goes up, and he thinks about jumping out, and the heat gets a little hotter, and he thinks about jumping out, and before he knows it, he's cooked. He never jumped.
[03:01:01.300 --> 03:01:08.300]  Yeah, but listen, I've been around the world. You've been around the world more than I have, I would imagine. I mean, it's bad all over, and this is a global system.
[03:01:08.300 --> 03:01:17.300]  This is global banks, as you've said, setting this up. They're going to do it everywhere. There's nowhere to run.
[03:01:17.300 --> 03:01:27.300]  Without all of the major, the G20 nations, the major cities, major nations, this is a global problem, but it's a big, bad, big, big world out there, Alex.
[03:01:27.300 --> 03:01:41.300]  There are areas of the world that one can go to to ride out this storm. Everyone should do their research on this, but I think you need to have that exit plan in your back pocket in case you need to do it.
[03:01:41.300 --> 03:01:49.300]  In case you need to move, you can move quickly, and you should definitely get a passport, and you should try to get a second passport just to have that safety measure.
[03:01:49.300 --> 03:02:06.300]  Otherwise, you might find yourself unable to escape in an economy that's collapsing beyond anyone's current projection, and the authorities being run by these clockwork, orange-like thugs who just roam the countryside with sticks and guns and rape and beat people,
[03:02:06.300 --> 03:02:11.300]  and you want to get out of there. You got to leave that option open.
[03:02:11.300 --> 03:02:20.300]  Oh, it's just so sad. Let's talk to Daniel in New York, listening on 1310 a.m. and we're up in the Rochester Buffalo area. Daniel, thanks for holding on here with Max Kaiser.
[03:02:20.300 --> 03:02:31.300]  Hey, thank you, Alex. I just want to say I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore. And Max, I just want to say thanks for all the information that you're putting out as well.
[03:02:31.300 --> 03:02:34.300]  Is it all right if I give out my website?
[03:02:34.300 --> 03:02:36.300]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:02:36.300 --> 03:02:54.300]  At anti-NewWorldOrderParty.com, we're trying to build a global network to help support patriots that want to run for constitutional law and also want to restore America, and I would just encourage your listeners to come out and support us at anti-NewWorldOrderParty.com.
[03:02:54.300 --> 03:03:00.300]  And I just thank you, Alex, for all you've done in 1310 a.m. as well in Rochester, New York.
[03:03:00.300 --> 03:03:09.300]  Yeah, they're great people. Been on there like over 12, 13 years, great people. Old Dr. Wolfe was a great guy. I guess his son still runs at wonderful people. Thank you.
[03:03:09.300 --> 03:03:18.300]  Well, I tell you, it makes me want to throw up where this country is going. We are in so much trouble. I look at my children every day, but for the betterment of society, I stay here.
[03:03:18.300 --> 03:03:24.300]  I mean, I could run to Argentina, Costa Rica, but it's a limited deal.
[03:03:24.300 --> 03:03:34.300]  I'm going to stay here where I've got my maximum amount of awake people, and then whatever they do, I'm ready. I'm going to deal with it. I'm going to take it. The setup, the torture, the killing, whatever that just, I'm going head up against them.
[03:03:34.300 --> 03:03:44.300]  Somebody's got to go head up against them. And I'm like, I don't want to like myself to Colonel Travis, but I'm going down with the Alamo here. Max Kaiser, closing comments.
[03:03:44.300 --> 03:03:55.300]  Well, yeah, this has come down to the big choice one has to make. I think, you know, you're making your choice. I think other people will make a different choice.
[03:03:55.300 --> 03:04:09.300]  But it's unfortunate that the situation has gotten so bad that for the vast number of people in the U.S., the best choice that they can make is to leave the country as a way to save themselves and their families.
[03:04:09.300 --> 03:04:17.300]  It's unfortunate. It's come to that. But, you know, there's no, there's no pride in being marched into the incinerator and being burned to death.
[03:04:17.300 --> 03:04:26.300]  Yeah, no, I'm not going to be, I'm not going to be marched anywhere. We're trying to fix things peaceful, Max. We're here alerting the people to get ready to defend themselves. We're here.
[03:04:26.300 --> 03:04:35.300]  You're always saying, look at history. Look at history. That's what I'm saying. That the same people that happened to 50, 80, 70 years ago, they thought the same thing as what you're saying.
[03:04:35.300 --> 03:04:40.300]  It can't happen. But it did. And the same people aren't charged. So why would it be any different?
[03:04:40.300 --> 03:04:45.300]  Incredible interview, Max Kaiser. God bless you. We'll talk to you soon.
[03:04:45.300 --> 03:04:46.300]  All right, buddy.
[03:04:46.300 --> 03:04:55.300]  There he goes. Hard to other callers. Great job with the crew. 7 o'clock tonight. Prismplanet.tv. Spread the word. This isn't a game. This isn't a joke.
[03:04:55.300 --> 03:05:05.300]  Retransmission starts now.
