[00:00.000 --> 00:20.220]  This perfect storm, the debate is over around climate change.
[00:20.220 --> 00:24.720]  Just come to the state of California, observe it with your own eyes.
[00:24.720 --> 00:28.040]  It's not an intellectual debate, it's not even debatable.
[00:28.040 --> 00:32.200]  The debate is over around climate change.
[00:32.200 --> 00:38.400]  California's rogue governor says the fires are due to climate change.
[00:38.400 --> 00:45.000]  But anyone with a modicum of awareness knows that this is an outrageous lie.
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.400]  We know exactly what causes the California wildfire.
[00:48.400 --> 00:54.440]  It is the result of two factors, dry seasons and people.
[00:54.440 --> 01:00.640]  Central state records have only been kept since the 1950s and 2020 has been the most
[01:00.640 --> 01:03.480]  destructive season on record.
[01:03.480 --> 01:09.040]  But this isn't a new phenomenon and the fires of the past were more destructive than the
[01:09.040 --> 01:11.120]  modern era.
[01:11.120 --> 01:16.120]  Through studies of tree rings and other natural evidence, researchers have documented multiple
[01:16.120 --> 01:22.000]  droughts in California during the past thousand years, including one that began in the year
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.760]  850, which lasted two and a half centuries.
[01:26.760 --> 01:32.680]  Before European settlers arrived in California, indigenous peoples used controlled burns to
[01:32.680 --> 01:37.520]  manage the dry season and to increase and improve their harvest.
[01:37.520 --> 01:43.240]  It is estimated they would burn 4.4 million acres of forest each year.
[01:43.240 --> 01:46.560]  And that is twice as much as 2020.
[01:46.560 --> 01:52.280]  Studies have shown that 97% of all forest fires are caused by humans.
[01:52.280 --> 01:57.800]  Smoking, campfires and other accidents have always been a problem.
[01:57.800 --> 02:02.920]  Experts blame the recent wildfires on fire suppression and an overabundance of wood
[02:02.920 --> 02:04.200]  fuel.
[02:04.200 --> 02:08.800]  One of the reasons why the indigenous people burned so much forest was to keep this under
[02:08.800 --> 02:10.840]  control.
[02:10.840 --> 02:17.080]  Aside from human accidents, there is also arson, and we have seen plenty of arson in
[02:17.080 --> 02:18.080]  2020.
[02:18.080 --> 02:20.160]  It's been sort of the theme.
[02:20.160 --> 02:26.440]  If this country doesn't give us what we want, then we will burn down this system and replace
[02:26.440 --> 02:27.440]  it.
[02:27.440 --> 02:32.640]  Several people have been arrested for starting fires along the entire West Coast.
[02:32.640 --> 02:36.440]  Homeowners are catching arsonists on their property.
[02:36.440 --> 02:41.840]  There are reports of people throwing Molotov cocktails out of moving vehicles on the freeway.
[02:41.840 --> 02:54.960]  And there are videos of arsonists setting people's homes on fire.
[02:54.960 --> 03:00.280]  We know for certain that at least one of the arrested arsonists is directly involved with
[03:00.280 --> 03:03.400]  the BLM ANTIFA movement.
[03:03.400 --> 03:09.720]  And the rest certainly seem to fit the bill.
[03:09.720 --> 03:11.120]  Local news is reporting on it.
[03:11.120 --> 03:14.600]  A man has been arrested accused of starting this fire.
[03:14.600 --> 03:19.400]  One of two men accused of intentionally setting fire to fields along freeways.
[03:19.400 --> 03:24.200]  But the FBI and the mainstream media are in full denial.
[03:24.200 --> 03:30.280]  A Clackamas County Sheriff's deputy was placed on administrative leave after warning locals
[03:30.280 --> 03:32.240]  about coordinated arson attacks.
[03:32.240 --> 03:35.840]  What I'm worried about is that there's people stashing stuff, right?
[03:35.840 --> 03:36.840]  Right.
[03:36.840 --> 03:40.080]  It means that they're going to go in preparation.
[03:40.080 --> 03:44.400]  And I don't want to sound like some doomsdayer, but it's getting serious.
[03:44.400 --> 03:48.560]  And the Democrat Party is telling you it is all climate change.
[03:48.560 --> 03:50.360]  Mother Earth is angry.
[03:50.360 --> 03:55.200]  She's telling us whether she's telling us with hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, fires
[03:55.200 --> 04:00.960]  in the West, whatever it is that the climate crisis is real and has an impact.
[04:00.960 --> 04:06.800]  And telling you that the fires will soon come to your town if you don't vote for climate
[04:06.800 --> 04:07.800]  change.
[04:07.800 --> 04:13.400]  What we're experiencing right here is coming to a community all across the United States
[04:13.400 --> 04:16.960]  of America unless we get our act together on climate change.
[04:16.960 --> 04:23.040]  Which is a pretty nasty threat considering how many cities across America have burned
[04:23.040 --> 04:27.560]  by the hands of radical leftists over the summer.
[04:27.560 --> 04:34.440]  The 2006 film Apocalypto beautifully illustrated how the ancient Mayans' advanced knowledge
[04:34.440 --> 04:40.160]  of astronomy could have been used to frighten the superstitious masses into offering their
[04:40.160 --> 04:47.040]  own to be sacrificed on the altar of false idols who had the power to blacken out the
[04:47.040 --> 04:48.880]  sun.
[04:48.880 --> 04:51.840]  And there is nothing new under the sun.
[04:51.840 --> 04:56.720]  People today will throw away their children's birthright because of ignorance, faith in
[04:56.720 --> 04:57.720]  false idols.
[04:57.720 --> 05:03.240]  I know I say it all the time but I mean it from the bottom of my heart and I want to
[05:03.240 --> 05:08.000]  thank you, the listeners, viewers, this broadcast and all the stations and all the affiliates
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.040]  and sponsors and my family and the crew and just everybody out there, the listeners and
[05:14.040 --> 05:18.560]  viewers that have just said, this is such an epic struggle and we've all been proven
[05:18.560 --> 05:19.560]  dead on.
[05:19.560 --> 05:21.560]  We've been proven we're right because we're being led by God.
[05:21.560 --> 05:24.000]  We have a spirit and we're very humble about that.
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.520]  This is not us, this is God working through us but man now it's so precious to stay on
[05:28.520 --> 05:29.520]  air.
[05:29.520 --> 05:32.720]  I used to think you know maybe I'll wake a bunch of people up and I can kind of recede
[05:32.720 --> 05:37.320]  into the background because fighting this thing 18 hours a day gets a little bit old
[05:37.320 --> 05:41.600]  but now with the evil so out in the open and everything we've said being vindicated I never
[05:41.600 --> 05:45.520]  questioned what I was saying because I knew it was true but I did question where they'd
[05:45.520 --> 05:47.400]  ever actually try to carry it all out.
[05:47.400 --> 05:50.960]  Well now we know they're going to carry it out and then some so we got to fight and
[05:50.960 --> 05:54.760]  I just really appreciate you and we're in this together and praise God and pass the ammunition
[05:54.760 --> 05:55.760]  of the info war.
[05:55.760 --> 06:19.120]  Again take action folks this is it.
[06:19.120 --> 06:23.000]  Ladies and gentlemen it is Sunday September 13th the year is 2020.
[06:23.000 --> 06:28.200]  I'm your host Alex Jones coming to you live on this Sunday show and we're going to be
[06:28.200 --> 06:32.760]  here live for the next two hours then Owen Schroyer comes in with the new Sunday show
[06:32.760 --> 06:37.880]  live called Sunday Live 6 to 8 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[06:37.880 --> 06:42.520]  Roger Stone is out in Reno, Nevada where President Trump is and while Trump speaking
[06:42.520 --> 06:47.280]  Roger Stone is going to be joining us via video Skype from very nearby getting into
[06:47.280 --> 06:55.200]  the big national headlines that Roger Stone's calling for martial law and a military coup.
[06:55.200 --> 07:01.280]  No Roger Stone on this show last Wednesday said if they're calling for a coup against
[07:01.280 --> 07:06.200]  the president and against the election and the people Trump has to take action against
[07:06.200 --> 07:09.600]  them but that's how they reverse reality.
[07:09.600 --> 07:12.840]  Former head of the Treasury Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has the headline from Zero Hedge
[07:12.840 --> 07:18.280]  It's Up on InfoWars.com Paul Craig Roberts the U.S. and its constitution have two months
[07:18.280 --> 07:25.840]  left the deep state is trying to remove President Trump.
[07:25.840 --> 07:30.760]  Continuing ladies and gentlemen here's the false headlines out of Forbes Roger Stone
[07:30.760 --> 07:39.080]  calls on Trump to seize total power and assert martial law but could he here's the one independent
[07:39.080 --> 07:44.360]  Roger Stone tells Trump to bring martial law if he loses election did not say that there
[07:44.360 --> 07:49.160]  is no quote it's made up Roger Stone calls on Trump to seize total power it's in the
[07:49.160 --> 07:55.200]  London Guardian it's in the New York Times it's in the Washington Post it's everywhere
[07:55.200 --> 08:00.120]  and it's our response to the headlines of General Mattis plotted secret coup against
[08:00.120 --> 08:05.880]  Trump that was all over the news this week so he comes on air and responds to that responds
[08:05.880 --> 08:13.520]  to Democrats Joe Biden Nancy Pelosi Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton all calling for the military
[08:13.520 --> 08:18.960]  including the former Attorney General Eric Holder to remove Trump we say man that's illegal
[08:18.960 --> 08:23.160]  if you try military coup we'll have to have you arrested the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
[08:23.160 --> 08:27.080]  of Staff General Milley comes out and says it's illegal what Democrats want and just
[08:27.080 --> 08:36.320]  like that they distort reality yet again one more time for everybody and they tell you
[08:36.320 --> 08:47.280]  that Roger Stone wants martial law that's how they operate over and over and over and
[08:47.280 --> 08:55.720]  over again and now we're 50 days out from the historic election and the Democrats are
[08:55.720 --> 09:02.760]  planning their next move if you go to info wars.com you'll see the live show feed headline
[09:02.760 --> 09:13.240]  tonight and it's quite the headline quite the headline when you go up to info wars.com
[09:13.240 --> 09:20.800]  and you see the name of the show this evening confirmed deep state arsonist behind record
[09:20.800 --> 09:36.040]  breaking west coast wildfires plus new coup plot against Trump goes mainstream and if
[09:36.040 --> 09:40.840]  you look at what the environmental protection agency did but particularly what the Democrats
[09:40.840 --> 09:46.920]  did out in particularly the west coast but all over the country in the 70s and 80s they
[09:46.920 --> 09:51.560]  got laws and regulations passed California has the most accounting of any state where
[09:51.560 --> 09:59.840]  you cannot cut fire breaks into wilderness and you can't clean out the underbrush and
[09:59.840 --> 10:04.880]  everywhere the lefts in control like here in Austin millions of trees have tags on
[10:04.880 --> 10:09.720]  them even little trees and if you get caught cutting them down or doing something they
[10:09.720 --> 10:15.160]  throw you in jail now there's many photos you just type it into a search engine examples
[10:15.160 --> 10:20.320]  of fire breaks stopping fires I'll do that for your next segment and you can see famous
[10:20.320 --> 10:30.080]  cases of where a road will stop a major fire this is all just basic science it's what
[10:30.080 --> 10:35.680]  humans have done for thousands of years but since the 70s California is not allowed any
[10:35.680 --> 10:42.120]  brush to be cut any kindling to be removed so it's giant piles of debris that when there's
[10:42.120 --> 10:49.200]  a lightning strike or arson or high winds all hell breaks loose will be covering all
[10:49.200 --> 10:54.920]  of that coming up next segment when I can show you some photos of just the the amazing
[10:54.920 --> 10:59.840]  information of what happens with fire breaks there's all these famous photos of you'll
[10:59.840 --> 11:05.160]  see a big long road and we're a fire burn right up to the road and then stops because
[11:05.160 --> 11:11.000]  the road acts as a natural fire break it's amazing to see what happens and the Democrats
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.360]  know full well what they're doing China builds fire breaks North Korea builds fire breaks
[11:17.360 --> 11:22.280]  we're not allowed to it's all part of the sabotage default just like they want the dam
[11:22.280 --> 11:27.240]  was blown up and they want men not to be men and women not to be women and they want fuzzy
[11:27.240 --> 11:31.920]  math to be taught common core two plus two equals five people thought that was a joke
[11:31.920 --> 11:36.760]  that's real and now they're just getting rid of standardized testing altogether this is
[11:36.760 --> 11:45.040]  how you collapse the civilization this is how you collapse the society now coming up
[11:45.040 --> 11:52.080]  at the bottom of the hour I'm going to get to the shocking footage that's some of the
[11:52.080 --> 11:57.480]  most shocking yet of when two sheriff's deputies are assassinated we're going to play that
[11:57.480 --> 12:03.200]  video or their their their attempted assassination ambush both shot both in critical condition
[12:03.200 --> 12:08.000]  in Los Angeles for no reason but for being police then black lives matter showed up trying
[12:08.000 --> 12:13.520]  to enter the hospital screaming we hope you all die and then there was some other police
[12:13.520 --> 12:18.640]  officers that were killed another area and the media is celebrating their random execution
[12:18.640 --> 12:25.040]  and their death as well so that is all coming up today and then Roger Stone will be joining
[12:25.040 --> 12:32.560]  us coming up in the second hour from Reno, Nevada but what an incredible time to be alive
[12:32.560 --> 12:41.080]  and watching all of this unfold separately there's a meme going around the internet saying
[12:41.080 --> 12:49.360]  one day after California legalizes pedophilia and then it just shows this image of the famous
[12:49.360 --> 12:59.120]  Bay Area skyline with the big pyramidal travelers insurance building and it looks like an image
[12:59.120 --> 13:04.640]  of Dante's Inferno and that's the headline News of Science Bill removing automatic penalty
[13:04.640 --> 13:11.840]  for consensual sex acts involving minors but children don't have the age of consent that's
[13:11.840 --> 13:16.720]  why they can't sign contracts that's why they can't join the military that's why they can't
[13:16.720 --> 13:23.920]  have sex until they're 18 is because people don't want their children being tricked like
[13:23.920 --> 13:27.840]  they do in Eastern Europe young girls and put them on a plane flying them into sex slavery
[13:27.840 --> 13:34.880]  and say Saudi Arabia they've also changed the age of consent to 11 for abortions and vaccinations
[13:34.880 --> 13:40.080]  where your 11 year old can be talked into by the counselor to school to kill their baby
[13:40.080 --> 13:45.920]  or take deadly vaccines that's the state coming in and becoming the parents and it is so incredibly
[13:45.920 --> 13:51.360]  evil California still carries out secret sterilizations has come out in the news so does Oregon
[13:51.360 --> 13:58.800]  it's all eugenics and it's all about power it's all about control so they want this dystopic
[13:58.800 --> 14:02.720]  future that's why all the big movies are like Blade Runner and show this hellish future that's
[14:02.720 --> 14:09.280]  coming by 2018 supposedly the skies would look like San Francisco's dude back in that 1980s film
[14:09.280 --> 14:17.440]  Blade Runner yeah a few years late but now it's here all because they knowingly will not allow any
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.560]  fire breaks to be repaired or built they've all grown back up over 30 40 years there's now
[14:22.560 --> 14:30.160]  kindling and dead trees everywhere oh but also facebook banned facebook banned anyone
[14:32.720 --> 14:39.520]  criticizing the fact that it was arsonist being arrested and saying that's fake news that it's
[14:39.520 --> 14:43.760]  climate change because when democrats say something it's the law even though they just arrested a
[14:43.760 --> 14:49.120]  bunch of arsonist who shot video of them setting the main fires in Oregon in california they're
[14:49.120 --> 14:55.200]  arresting arsonist who just so happened to be antifa and blm and that's in local abc cbs nbc knows
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.120]  so that's all coming up today oh you're a medical doctor say hydroxychloroquine here's your patients
[15:03.120 --> 15:09.040]  boom you're taking off youtube oh you're the head of a hospital they fire you and who first reports
[15:09.040 --> 15:14.480]  you big tech they're the minders they're the controllers this is going to be one hell of a
[15:14.480 --> 15:18.560]  sunday transmission want to thank you all for tuning in please remember the only way we reach more
[15:18.560 --> 15:25.120]  people the only way we counter all this corruption is when you spread the word about that local
[15:25.120 --> 15:28.400]  tv station or radio station you're listening to and even if you have friends of family outside
[15:28.400 --> 15:32.800]  the area they don't have a local station tell folks about info wars dot com ford slash show
[15:32.800 --> 15:38.960]  and band out video and share the live link confirmed deep state arsonist behind record breaking west
[15:38.960 --> 15:42.800]  coast wall fires they set up the climate for it they set up not allowing the cutting down to the
[15:42.800 --> 15:48.400]  trees or the dead wood or the kindling and then they hype it all up and then their leftist agitators
[15:48.400 --> 15:52.720]  go out and start burning things down and they blame it on you and tell you it's all your fault
[15:52.720 --> 15:55.600]  because your middle class while they fly around in jumbo jets stay with us
[15:55.600 --> 16:04.640]  ever wondered why big tech acts in unison to create monopolies and aren't so incredibly
[16:04.640 --> 16:10.880]  anti-human love to censor people love to cover up for corrupt authoritarian regimes and dictatorships
[16:10.880 --> 16:15.600]  well it's very simple the first computers ever created were created by thomas watson the founder
[16:15.600 --> 16:20.640]  and owner of ibm to carry out eugenics and they helped run the death camps in nazi germany that's
[16:20.640 --> 16:25.920]  what the tattoos were on the slaves arms they would decide who lived and who died so from the beginning
[16:25.920 --> 16:31.920]  it's been about creating monopolies cornering markets and making humans obsolete the same people
[16:31.920 --> 16:36.320]  brought us baby formula that doesn't have enough protein fat in it to make your child's brain small
[16:36.320 --> 16:41.040]  the same people that said put babies in cribs separate from their mothers the lowers IQs about
[16:41.040 --> 16:46.880]  20 points on average as well these are hardcore eugenics survival of the fittest social Darwinist
[16:46.880 --> 16:52.640]  grow-up world admit the truth with being soft mucked at letting these locals run your lives
[16:52.640 --> 17:01.120]  they are your mortal enemies they want you dead do you understand that in germany in australia
[17:01.120 --> 17:09.600]  in canada and now even in ohio every blue state every blue city is announcing that they are
[17:09.600 --> 17:16.000]  establishing emergency covid centers for people that refuse to be tested or people that are tested
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.440]  but refuse to stay in place while the results are coming back or those that supposedly break
[17:21.440 --> 17:27.600]  quarantine this of course is all based on the tests that are over 90% fraudulent and were designed
[17:27.600 --> 17:35.120]  to be so this is a power grab the world government globalist system is in trouble all over the
[17:35.120 --> 17:41.680]  planet free peoples are trying to pull out of it and every blue area i use the term blue as if
[17:41.680 --> 17:47.440]  in the u.s for blue for democrats red for republicans is basically globalist or communist and
[17:47.440 --> 17:52.800]  authoritarian and they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian takeover because
[17:52.800 --> 17:57.280]  they know the world's waiting to them it's a very simple equation it's illegal we must resist it
[17:59.440 --> 18:06.320]  i don't want to be right about this prediction in fact it's it's not a prediction it is a
[18:06.320 --> 18:12.960]  forecast and we continue down the economic road we're on globally with the ongoing covid 19 lockdowns
[18:12.960 --> 18:17.520]  and the structure of productivity it will continue to accelerate these ripple effects that are
[18:17.520 --> 18:22.640]  breaking down supply chains that will starve tens of millions of additional people in the third world
[18:22.640 --> 18:28.640]  and destroy decades of human infrastructure that's been built it will annihilate the funding of that
[18:28.640 --> 18:33.680]  and put the entire first world in even deeper debt which we're being maneuvered into so
[18:33.680 --> 18:40.000]  i really think the smart move is to end all these lockdowns immediately and prosecute the people that
[18:40.560 --> 18:46.160]  launched the giant covid scam the giant covid con game this really used to be power grab
[18:46.720 --> 18:49.760]  but in case we can't reverse all this we better start digging in and getting
[18:49.760 --> 18:53.280]  storable food and getting prepared to be self-sufficient because that's the name of their
[18:53.280 --> 18:58.960]  game is to make us dependent on them so get self-sufficient now in full wars dot com it was in the
[18:58.960 --> 19:05.920]  telecommunications act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your gps location i read from
[19:05.920 --> 19:11.760]  the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-american now the media
[19:11.760 --> 19:17.280]  admits that almost every app and every company that are on apple and androids don't just track
[19:17.280 --> 19:24.240]  your location but your surfing history where you go who you talk to your relationships and they all
[19:24.240 --> 19:29.120]  share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well including having apps
[19:29.120 --> 19:35.600]  turn on and listen to what you're saying just like siri or alexa do and then putting databases
[19:35.600 --> 19:40.640]  transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever your phone is
[19:40.640 --> 19:45.360]  buying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information
[19:45.360 --> 19:50.880]  this is the global chinese communist social credit score get your protection privacy pockets at
[19:50.880 --> 19:56.880]  info war store dot com and cut big brother off dead in his filthy tracks info war store dot com
[20:01.440 --> 20:04.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:04.160 --> 20:12.160]  oh
[20:15.920 --> 20:17.760]  well tucker carlson knocks it out of the park
[20:25.840 --> 20:29.840]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[20:29.840 --> 20:38.080]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones you know i'm gonna come back next
[20:38.080 --> 20:42.000]  segment and get into what's really happening with the fires and the rest of the story hucker covers
[20:42.000 --> 20:46.080]  about 90% of it i'll give you the rest of it on the other side then i'll get into the police being
[20:46.080 --> 20:49.680]  hunted down and killed and what's really behind that and more 50 days out from the election but
[20:49.680 --> 20:53.840]  here's part of hucker carlson just a few days ago laying out what's really happening with their
[20:53.840 --> 20:58.320]  claim that it's all climate change when in reality it's their own actions on purpose premeditatedly
[20:58.320 --> 21:01.040]  uh to destroy civilization as we know it here it is
[21:04.800 --> 21:09.200]  good evening and welcome to a special edition of tucker carlson tonight you probably didn't
[21:09.200 --> 21:14.320]  see it live not many people did but last month a former republican member of congress called
[21:14.320 --> 21:19.840]  susan mullinari spoke at the democratic national convention if you thought about it it was an odd
[21:19.840 --> 21:25.200]  moment susan mullinari is a very nice person actually people who know her like her but it
[21:25.200 --> 21:29.840]  wasn't really clear what she was doing speaking at the democratic convention most democratic voters
[21:29.840 --> 21:34.880]  probably never have heard of susan mullinari and her whole speech lasted just a moment so what was
[21:34.880 --> 21:40.800]  the point of it exactly well here's the point susan mullinari was a top lobbyist for google she
[21:40.800 --> 21:46.720]  was a senior executive at google until 2018 she wasn't at the dnc to speak to anyone watching
[21:46.720 --> 21:52.960]  from home on tv she was speaking to the democratic party itself her message to them was very clear
[21:52.960 --> 21:58.880]  silicon valley is on your side will help you win this thing by inviting susan mullinari democrats
[21:58.880 --> 22:04.960]  also sent a message back to silicon valley you have nothing to fear from us elect joe biden and
[22:04.960 --> 22:11.040]  you can keep your monopolies you can extend your control over american life this was a bargain a
[22:11.040 --> 22:16.800]  long time in the making immediately after donald trump was elected in 2016 executives at google
[22:16.800 --> 22:21.120]  held a company-wide meeting really it was more of a group therapy session the company's chief
[22:21.120 --> 22:26.960]  financial officer ruth porat broke down in tears as she spoke she asked how google could quote
[22:26.960 --> 22:32.800]  use the great strength and resources and reach we have to continue to advance really important
[22:32.800 --> 22:39.440]  values and quote what are those values they're not your values google co-founder serje brand was
[22:39.440 --> 22:45.600]  also devastated by trump's victory he found the election quote deeply offensive watch brand go full
[22:45.600 --> 22:54.880]  encounter group in front of his employees most people here are pretty upset and pretty sad for
[22:56.160 --> 23:04.320]  uh because of the election as an immigrant and a refugee i'm i certainly find this election
[23:04.880 --> 23:09.120]  deeply offensive is there anything positive you see from this election result
[23:09.120 --> 23:15.200]  uh boy that's that's a really tough one right now
[23:16.240 --> 23:21.840]  mm another oppressed billionaire at the same meeting brand suggested that google changed
[23:21.840 --> 23:26.880]  its algorithm the very core of its search business to promote quote better quality of
[23:26.880 --> 23:34.160]  governance and decision-making what does that mean in other words they want to subvert democracy
[23:34.160 --> 23:38.800]  and everyone in the room knew exactly what he was saying and they got to work doing it two years later
[23:38.800 --> 23:43.760]  video of that company wide meeting leaked any other company would have been ashamed of it the head
[23:43.760 --> 23:51.360]  of america's most powerful corporation caught on camera planning to manipulate voting in elections
[23:51.360 --> 23:55.440]  but google was not embarrassed they didn't stop either no one made them stop so they continued
[23:56.080 --> 24:00.800]  last year a new video emerged this video showed a woman called jen jenai who works in the artificial
[24:00.800 --> 24:06.640]  intelligence unit at google confessing to trying to manipulate the 2020 election the one underway
[24:06.640 --> 24:13.840]  now jenai said quote we all got screwed over in 2016 so we're rapidly been like what happened there
[24:13.840 --> 24:20.640]  and how do we prevent it from happening again once again she's speaking about the results
[24:20.640 --> 24:25.520]  of a free and fair democratic election that google the most powerful company in the world
[24:25.520 --> 24:32.080]  didn't like so they're trying to make sure it never happens again it's brazen but they're doing it
[24:32.080 --> 24:37.920]  why are they doing it well imagine you're them imagine we're back in 2016 and you're a tech
[24:37.920 --> 24:41.760]  executive in northern california you're in your 30s you're not particularly impressive though you
[24:41.760 --> 24:46.960]  have all the right credentials and yet somehow you are now worth hundreds of billions of dollars
[24:46.960 --> 24:51.280]  and you look on as donald trump wins the white house he's running on the most populous republican
[24:51.280 --> 24:56.960]  platform since teddy roosevelt on the other side openly socialist candidates are elected to congress
[24:56.960 --> 25:02.960]  people are tired of oligarchs like you you have not improved america you know this could be very bad
[25:02.960 --> 25:07.920]  for you someone might tax your stock options or seize your private island so what do you do next
[25:08.560 --> 25:13.840]  well silicon valley had a few ideas first they boosted democrats who were aligned with wall
[25:13.840 --> 25:19.840]  street and multi billion dollar companies like theirs as long as people were distracted by identity
[25:19.840 --> 25:24.720]  politics as long as they were fighting about unresolvable issues like race and gender you might
[25:24.720 --> 25:29.760]  be able to distract them long enough that you could pull this off you won't talk about the fact
[25:29.760 --> 25:34.800]  that you don't pay taxes if you're busy attacking cops and other powerless members of the working
[25:34.800 --> 25:41.440]  class so there's a reason kamala harris and joe biden are now the standard bears of the democratic
[25:41.440 --> 25:45.760]  party it's not because democratic voters love them so much they didn't it's because they're
[25:45.760 --> 25:50.480]  compliant joe biden has trouble formulating sentences clearly he's not posing a threat to
[25:50.480 --> 25:56.320]  tech monopolies of course not after 50 years of shilling for corporations and no politician has
[25:56.320 --> 26:01.120]  demonstrated more clearly her ability to use race tension to divide this country more effectively
[26:01.120 --> 26:08.720]  than kamala harris has kamala harris has applauded the riots watch i want to make clear that i i know
[26:08.720 --> 26:12.640]  that there are protests still happening in major cities across the united states i just not seeing
[26:12.640 --> 26:17.200]  the reporting on it that i that i had that's right for the first few weeks um but they're not
[26:17.200 --> 26:21.920]  now they're not going to stop and that's they're not this is a movement i'm telling you they're
[26:21.920 --> 26:26.560]  not going to stop before election day november and they're not going to stop after election day
[26:26.560 --> 26:31.360]  and that should be everyone should take note of that on both levels that this isn't they're not
[26:31.360 --> 26:38.080]  going to let up and they should not the rioters aren't going to let up and they should not says
[26:38.080 --> 26:43.280]  kamala harris right this is the same kamala harris who tweeted that michael brown was murdered by
[26:43.280 --> 26:48.800]  cops in fergus in missouri he wasn't murdered that's not speculation barack obama's own justice
[26:48.800 --> 26:54.080]  department concluded he wasn't murdered that's a lie but harris repeated anyway and her allies
[26:54.080 --> 26:59.680]  at twitter allowed her to disseminate that line nationwide they didn't pull that tweet down so
[26:59.680 --> 27:04.880]  silicon valley is doing all it can to help the biden harris ticket and this is just the beginning
[27:04.880 --> 27:09.200]  this year for example linkedin found a read hoffman and other billionaires through major
[27:09.200 --> 27:15.440]  financial support behind an organization called acronym reportedly acronym has set up bogus news
[27:15.440 --> 27:21.200]  sites and swing states to portray democrats in a positive light oh kind of like the propaganda
[27:21.200 --> 27:26.320]  they claimed russia was propagating in the last election right this is the party that loves to
[27:26.320 --> 27:31.360]  complain about the death of local journalism but they are funding a propaganda network
[27:32.400 --> 27:37.120]  to change people's opinions before an election and the goal of course isn't just to make democrats
[27:37.120 --> 27:41.760]  look good it's to make you terrified because scared populations are easier to control and
[27:41.760 --> 27:46.000]  that's why facebook blocked a video featuring the president pointing out an obvious scientific
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.760]  truth and no scientist disagrees with this children are mostly not at risk from the effects of the
[27:51.760 --> 27:57.520]  corona virus according to the scientific journal the lance of the virus is quote generally a mild
[27:57.520 --> 28:04.000]  disease in children including infants fatal outcomes are quote rare if you knew that you
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.720]  might have real questions about the lockdowns joe biden and the teachers unions and so many other
[28:08.720 --> 28:13.840]  institutions in this country are pushing so you can't know it facebook decided you should not be able
[28:13.840 --> 28:19.680]  to see those data from the lancet twitter went a step further and had their 27 year old liberal
[28:19.680 --> 28:25.600]  arts majors locked down the president's campaign account until the campaign deleted video of them
[28:25.600 --> 28:29.920]  so all right folks we're a live show a lot of crazy stuff happens that's part of the fun of it
[28:29.920 --> 28:35.680]  but they played the wrong clip but that's actually more important tocker on silicon valley the part
[28:35.680 --> 28:39.760]  i wanted to get to which is how he lays out the history with their own clips of them saying the
[28:39.760 --> 28:43.360]  world's gonna end if you don't give total power over to all of them and then showing how they
[28:43.360 --> 28:47.760]  change the law to not let you cut any of the fire breaks that are needed this is this is simple
[28:47.760 --> 28:51.520]  folks this is like this is like not grounding the electricity in your house you're gonna get
[28:51.520 --> 28:55.200]  struck by lightning and burn down the democrats know exactly what they're doing it's shutting
[28:55.200 --> 29:01.360]  america down well they're right back it sounds over the top when i go on air and i explained
[29:01.360 --> 29:07.120]  that the controllers of the planet want to carry out the extermination of the entire human population
[29:07.120 --> 29:12.560]  except for a few of what they call their new transcendent silicon gods but that's really
[29:12.560 --> 29:17.200]  what they're now externalizing they're now taking what was in their textbooks and white papers 30
[29:17.200 --> 29:22.880]  years ago and actually openly announcing it everywhere they're going from beta to operational
[29:22.880 --> 29:26.480]  and think about all these major corporations they tell you humans are horrible they tell you
[29:26.480 --> 29:30.240]  humans are a parasite they tell you that we've all got to be gotten rid of and then
[29:30.240 --> 29:34.480]  they won't let people see their old folks in nursing homes and then ship in covid to kill them
[29:34.480 --> 29:40.720]  that's all organizing as a beta test for larger operations and everything is a microcosm and a
[29:40.720 --> 29:46.560]  laboratory test of larger scalability of what they are now beginning to roll out look at how
[29:46.560 --> 29:51.040]  they're banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics they're absolutely essential to
[29:51.040 --> 29:57.440]  stop viral infections like covid 19 this is all absolute information control this is beyond 1984
[29:59.120 --> 30:05.440]  it couldn't have been scripted any better that's because it was completely scripted and we even
[30:05.440 --> 30:11.920]  know the names of the united nations rockefeller foundation bill mullin decades and john hotkins
[30:11.920 --> 30:18.560]  top us we have the script just like you'd have for a hollywood movie and it's designed to free
[30:18.560 --> 30:27.200]  civilization and have a post renaissance stagnation or new dark age in a total consolidation of all
[30:27.200 --> 30:34.240]  wealth of power in the hands of the kleptocratic post humanist the magnitude of this is unfathomable
[30:34.240 --> 30:39.680]  as you can see all the checkboxes of tyranny are being marked carefully every eye dotted every
[30:39.680 --> 30:45.600]  t crossed a total societal vertical integration takeover medical tyranny total surveillance
[30:45.600 --> 30:49.840]  the big tech heads on average have had their wealth cope up 35 percent in the last eight months
[30:49.840 --> 30:54.720]  of course jeff bezos has basically doubled his everyone is being forced onto their system the
[30:54.720 --> 31:01.920]  post human robot takeover you're being made obsolete i don't want to say i'm a practical person i'm i
[31:01.920 --> 31:06.640]  am a humble person overall i come off as aggressive and things because i'm under threat here under

[31:54.880 --> 32:01.200]  take us through this we're going to make it constantly whether it's the new york times the
[32:01.200 --> 32:06.160]  washington post or howard sternum a blue name and they come out and they attack him full war saying
[32:06.160 --> 32:12.640]  jones claims civil wars coming and financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses
[32:12.640 --> 32:17.520]  and he tells people they should get off the grid and get prepared and have storeable food if they
[32:17.520 --> 32:22.800]  can and now everything i've warned people about is coming true because it was all in the rock
[32:22.800 --> 32:29.680]  feller foundation documents like lockstep this is the corporate planetary takeover so yes i stand
[32:29.680 --> 32:34.960]  by what i said 10 years ago what i said a year ago and what i said last week more than ever

[33:23.120 --> 33:27.360]  everybody knows that but i've always said if somebody better comes along
[33:27.360 --> 33:33.200]  i'd step aside for them so i don't normally air two clips of tucker carlson in one hour
[33:34.160 --> 33:38.560]  but since i mentioned it i thought we'd get to this report and then i'll come back next segment
[33:38.560 --> 33:43.360]  and get into the unbelievable pedophile news that's just out in the open as the world awakens to
[33:43.360 --> 33:47.280]  the real currency but the democratic party and their controllers are involved in and that's the
[33:47.280 --> 33:52.240]  innocence and essence of our children so that is all coming up next segment be a very powerful
[33:52.240 --> 33:59.200]  special report you want to stay with us and then roger stone is going to be joining us you know i
[33:59.200 --> 34:03.520]  was going to air these cops being shot in cold blood and i was going to air people come to the
[34:03.520 --> 34:07.360]  hospital trying to kill them inside saying they hope they die but maybe we just shouldn't give
[34:07.360 --> 34:12.640]  people attention like that maybe i shouldn't play those clips those clips are on info wars dot com
[34:13.360 --> 34:18.240]  and news wars dot com if you want to go look at them but i'm not going to subject people to this i
[34:18.240 --> 34:25.840]  guess maybe that's not what god wants uh because but you know maybe people should see all this it's
[34:25.840 --> 34:30.800]  kind of like not wanting you to you know see the the horrible pedophile stuff i don't want to show
[34:30.800 --> 34:35.920]  that but at the same time we do need to expose it don't me let me let me think about that let me
[34:35.920 --> 34:43.120]  think about that a little bit but uh this is intentional the shutdown of our dams our industry
[34:43.120 --> 34:49.120]  our energy sectors our families our culture all of this is the admitted plan to bring the united
[34:49.120 --> 34:52.400]  states down that's how we're being conquered is from without by the globalists they're making
[34:52.400 --> 34:58.400]  their move right now and this country is burning in all the blue cities and blue states because
[34:58.400 --> 35:05.840]  they have paid rioters doing it paid criminals doing it and they also have not let anybody cut
[35:05.840 --> 35:11.280]  fire breaks i'll explain it again there's type in fire break and click images on any search engine
[35:11.280 --> 35:16.720]  you'll see what fire breaks do and how fires will burn right up to a road and stop arrive to a fire
[35:16.720 --> 35:22.000]  break stop fire breaks aren't allowed in these western areas you know we've got a ranch in east
[35:22.000 --> 35:28.160]  texas and the state came through in the fifties and said we're cutting a firebreak through here
[35:28.720 --> 35:32.880]  imminent domain we said please and it makes a nice area through the forested area and
[35:33.440 --> 35:40.000]  they come through with a big old um brush cutters you know every five six years and they
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.640]  go back through there and they and they cut them with these big tractors and it's it's good to have
[35:44.640 --> 35:47.920]  you know access on our land and good to have them do that but that's why you don't have this type
[35:47.920 --> 35:51.920]  of stuff going on in texas ladies and gentlemen tb viewers to see the examples of this here's here's
[35:51.920 --> 36:02.240]  part of what tucker carlson had to say about it friday night good evening welcome to tucker carlson
[36:02.240 --> 36:08.080]  tonight massive wildfires unprecedented in their scope continue to sweep across huge portions of
[36:08.080 --> 36:13.920]  the west tonight in oregon half a million residents have been forced to evacuate their homes that's
[36:13.920 --> 36:19.920]  one of every 10 people in the entire state dozens are dead including small children but the fires
[36:19.920 --> 36:27.440]  still are not close to contained watch this report from fox's jeff paul months of tinder dry conditions
[36:27.440 --> 36:33.280]  added to days of high winds and hot temperatures creating a perfect firestorm across the west
[36:33.280 --> 36:39.200]  california is one of the hardest hit with a record breaking three billion acres burned
[36:39.200 --> 36:45.200]  and nearly 4 000 homes and buildings lost so far a 12 year old boy and his grandmother
[36:45.200 --> 36:50.640]  are among the latest deaths the flames are spreading so fast it really doesn't give people
[36:50.640 --> 36:56.320]  much time to get out the fires also taking a toll in washington state where more than 100 homes
[36:56.320 --> 37:02.480]  are gone and a one year old boy died as his family tried to flee the flames and in oregon
[37:02.480 --> 37:09.200]  more than 35 fires are burning with at least five small towns destroyed resources across the west
[37:09.200 --> 37:16.000]  are stretched thin it is awful and it continues as we speak right now walls of flame consuming
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.200]  everything in their path homes thousands and thousands untold numbers of animals and of course
[37:21.200 --> 37:27.920]  as we said human beings too it is tragedy on a massive scale when something this terrible happens
[37:27.920 --> 37:33.680]  decent people pause like what their own interests aside for a moment they consider how they can
[37:33.680 --> 37:38.880]  help we've seen that kind of selflessness before in this country this is remember the anniversary
[37:38.880 --> 37:46.000]  of 9 11 but there are others for whom altruism is an unknown concept self-interest is all they know
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.880]  these people do not pause they never do they relentlessly press forward for any advantage
[37:50.880 --> 37:56.560]  under any circumstances they see human suffering as a means to increase their personal power these
[37:56.560 --> 38:03.200]  are the people who turn funerals into political rallies and feel no shame for doing it as americans
[38:03.200 --> 38:08.320]  burn to death people like this swung into action immediately they went on television with a partisan
[38:08.320 --> 38:15.280]  talking point climate change they said caused these fires they didn't explain how exactly that
[38:15.280 --> 38:20.400]  happened how did climate change do that they didn't tell us but they just kept saying it in the hands
[38:20.400 --> 38:26.160]  of democratic politicians climate change is like systemic racism in the sky you can't see it but
[38:26.160 --> 38:32.800]  rest assured it's everywhere and it's deadly and like systemic racism it is your fault the american
[38:32.800 --> 38:38.560]  middle class did it they caused climate change they ate too many hamburgers they drove too many suv's
[38:38.560 --> 38:43.120]  they had too many children a lot of them wear t-shirts to work and didn't finish college and
[38:43.120 --> 38:49.440]  that causes climate change too and worst of all some of them may vote for donald trump in november
[38:49.440 --> 38:55.120]  and if there's anything that absolutely definitively causes climate change and literally over a hundred
[38:55.120 --> 39:00.240]  percent of scientists agree with this established fact it is voting for donald trump you might as
[39:00.240 --> 39:05.600]  well start a tire fire in your yard joe biden has checked the science and he agrees with us
[39:06.240 --> 39:10.800]  yesterday the people in biden staff who understand the internet tweeted out an image of the wildfires
[39:10.800 --> 39:15.840]  along with this message quote climate change is already here and we're witnessing its devastating
[39:15.840 --> 39:22.000]  effects every single day we have to get president trump out of the white house end quote so once
[39:22.000 --> 39:29.440]  again by voting for donald trump you are causing climate change which causes devastating fires
[39:29.440 --> 39:34.640]  you by your vote have made hundreds of thousands of oragonians homeless tonight you've murdered
[39:34.640 --> 39:40.400]  people joe biden's closest friend in the world a prominent kitesurfer on martha's vineyard called
[39:40.400 --> 39:47.920]  barack obama echoed that message with his trademark restraint obama declared that your life depends
[39:47.920 --> 39:54.560]  on voting for joe biden well hold on a minute you might ask doesn't this very same barack obama
[39:54.560 --> 40:01.120]  own a 12 million dollar spread right on the ocean in massachusetts at a time when sea levels are
[40:01.120 --> 40:07.680]  rising so fast we're about to see killer whales in the rockies well that doesn't make sense it
[40:07.680 --> 40:12.560]  doesn't seem like barack obama could be very concerned about climate change and by the way
[40:12.560 --> 40:18.720]  didn't obama got a law school when did he become a scientist those seem like reasonable questions
[40:18.720 --> 40:23.760]  on the other hand lawyers pretending to be scientists are now everywhere in the democratic
[40:23.760 --> 40:28.320]  party here for example is the governor of washington state jay inslee inslee is a proud
[40:28.320 --> 40:33.200]  graduate of willamette university law school he's explaining he's already figured out the
[40:33.200 --> 40:39.440]  cause of the fires watch and these are conditions that are exacerbated by the changing climate
[40:39.440 --> 40:47.600]  that we are suffering and i do not believe that we should surrender these subdivisions or these
[40:47.600 --> 40:53.920]  houses to climate change exacerbated fires we should fight the cause of these fires
[40:55.520 --> 41:02.720]  so i mismanaged my state now it's on fire you're required to give me more power right you see how
[41:02.720 --> 41:10.160]  that works but as a factual matter this is a crock there is not a single scientist on earth
[41:10.160 --> 41:16.400]  who knows whether or by how much these fires may have been quote exacerbated by warmer temperatures
[41:16.400 --> 41:23.040]  caused by climate change all we have is conjecture from a handful of scientists and many politicians
[41:23.040 --> 41:27.360]  none of whom has reached a definitive conclusion daniel swain for example he's a climate scientist
[41:27.360 --> 41:33.120]  at ucla conceded recently that it's quote hard to determine whether climate change played a role
[41:33.120 --> 41:40.640]  in sparking the fires okay that's what science is it's gradual it's incremental often it's
[41:40.640 --> 41:45.840]  tentative we don't say things we don't know for certain it's the opposite of politics they have
[41:45.840 --> 41:50.560]  nothing all right the full tucker carlson report is on info wars dot com and news wars dot com but
[41:50.560 --> 41:58.880]  i wanted to play that let's go further and give me the rest of story california is famous for having
[41:58.880 --> 42:02.560]  fires when people went out there for the gold rush they would have lightning strikes and big fires
[42:03.440 --> 42:08.000]  but the difference is lightning would then burn its own fire breaks in large areas would be allowed
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.560]  to burn down so there was fires later there would be natural fire breaks for more previous fires
[42:12.560 --> 42:17.600]  that happened and you'd have a random patchwork of where forest wasn't and where forest was from
[42:17.600 --> 42:23.280]  previous wall fires wall fires are part of the carbon cycle on this planet you've got these mask
[42:23.280 --> 42:28.480]  wearing fraudsters that gave you the covet shenanigans up there now telling you there's not enough
[42:28.480 --> 42:34.720]  electricity we have to not have electricity because of climate change and all the rest of this
[42:34.720 --> 42:38.400]  and now that's climate change is fault when really they're just ripping you off and running scams
[42:38.400 --> 42:42.480]  and mismanaging and and now they won't cut fire breaks so that's your fault and then facebook
[42:42.480 --> 42:47.200]  censoring everybody including local tv stations and police departments that have arrested dozens of
[42:47.200 --> 42:52.800]  arsonists who videotape themselves in many cases setting the very damn fires but oh no it's climate
[42:52.800 --> 42:57.360]  change so big tech won't let you know it's arsonists that wait for it to get dry with high winds
[42:58.800 --> 43:05.680]  as of 54 days out the globalist child molesting devil worshipers know they're in trouble and
[43:05.680 --> 43:09.680]  they know trumps can win in landslides they're saying they can test the election and plunge the
[43:09.680 --> 43:15.120]  country to the war and they are throwing hack attacks at them for wars dirty tricks attempts to
[43:15.120 --> 43:20.240]  shut us down it's incredible that's why now more than ever your financial support at info

[43:26.160 --> 43:31.280]  if money wasn't coming in we'd be shut down and that's not good we need to have extra money in
[43:31.280 --> 43:36.960]  our coffers to be able to expand in this home stretch not just contract we're winning but these

[44:56.160 --> 45:05.440]  ever the trick that social engineers use is very very simple they just teach us that the architecture
[45:05.440 --> 45:13.120]  of civilization that the trajectory of a species is designed by these ever-knowing loving liberal
[45:13.120 --> 45:18.080]  technocrats and that if we just sit back and enjoy the ride everything will be great but then they
[45:18.080 --> 45:22.960]  tell us that humans are obsolete not essential and we're bad for the earth and we need to be
[45:22.960 --> 45:30.400]  phased out so they're very open about what they're doing and they count on us just being very passive
[45:30.400 --> 45:37.280]  living in the matrix like system that they're building but what defines humans more than anything
[45:37.280 --> 45:43.280]  from the rest of the quote animal kingdom is that we control our environment we build our own
[45:43.280 --> 45:49.840]  environments we create our own systems we really geoengineer and terraform the planet and its systems
[45:49.840 --> 45:55.280]  towards our aims but instead we're acting like animals and the globalists play the part of humans
[45:55.280 --> 46:11.200]  and us as cattle that's the trick the answer to 1984 is 1776
[46:12.800 --> 46:17.760]  info wars has been banned arrested
[46:17.760 --> 46:28.960]  attacked and threatened because we are effective the great awakening is here

[46:56.400 --> 47:04.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:12.560 --> 47:16.240]  welcome back i'm your host alex jones broadcasting live on this sunday edition
[47:16.240 --> 47:21.440]  and i'll just be completely honest with the listeners i almost could not do this show today
[47:21.440 --> 47:29.040]  and i don't do that to be dramatic i never choked 26 years on air and i'm not choking now
[47:29.760 --> 47:36.480]  it's just that i study this stuff so much that by the time i get up here after probably doing
[47:37.120 --> 47:45.360]  it's not exaggerate six hours of research today that i am so angry at these people it's beyond
[47:45.360 --> 47:51.280]  angry i can't believe this is all going on i know this is a war i know it's an assault i know it's
[47:51.280 --> 47:56.720]  21st century war where they can't militarily attack us front on so this international crime
[47:56.720 --> 48:00.880]  syndicate the globalist are doing it through the culture through the corruption through the
[48:00.880 --> 48:06.400]  people they manipulated through their economic power but it's so obvious it's so admitted it's
[48:06.400 --> 48:12.400]  so ridiculous it's just mind blowing so let me just hit this and then i'll hit the
[48:12.400 --> 48:21.440]  the at least six cops in the last two days got executed in the united states
[48:22.960 --> 48:27.440]  and will never even know their names it's a matter of footnote two more got shot in los
[48:27.440 --> 48:33.840]  angeles during five of their lives and i got up early this morning at like 4 a.m because i can't
[48:33.840 --> 48:40.640]  sleep now because of this and i went on info wars dot com and i saw the articles about the cops
[48:40.640 --> 48:48.000]  getting shot and then i clicked on paul watson's twitter and it was these people coming to the
[48:48.000 --> 48:53.600]  hospital saying we hope the cops die and just acting like complete maniacs and i didn't hate
[48:53.600 --> 48:57.200]  them because they were black people because there's a bunch of white people acting just like them
[48:57.200 --> 49:04.160]  i hated them because they're so stupid you might get 14 black guys killed wrongfully a year by police
[49:04.720 --> 49:07.360]  and and a few hundred black guys shot by police a year
[49:07.360 --> 49:11.920]  hurt you're twice as likely to be shot of your white per capita
[49:13.920 --> 49:17.440]  it's not just there's more white people you're you're if you're a white man you're twice as
[49:17.440 --> 49:20.720]  likely to be shot by the police because the police aren't scared to shoot you have you
[49:20.720 --> 49:24.880]  pulled a gun on them and cops aren't perfect there's certainly some bad ones but i'm watching
[49:24.880 --> 49:31.520]  these black dudes with blm go to the hospital and there's like hours of this footage daring cops
[49:31.520 --> 49:39.280]  to shoot them screaming hoping the police die because they think there's an epidemic of black
[49:39.280 --> 49:48.880]  people being killed by police this is mind control ladies and gentlemen because the media creates the
[49:48.880 --> 49:55.280]  perception that there is a record number of black people being killed by police because there's
[49:55.280 --> 50:01.920]  370 million people in this country 330 million citizens and if you want to show every time
[50:01.920 --> 50:07.600]  a black dude gets shot you can see it almost every day and most of the time the black dude
[50:07.600 --> 50:11.760]  pulls the gun and shoots themselves the cops get blamed or the pulls a gun on the cops it's
[50:11.760 --> 50:16.000]  black cops the cops get blamed and i'm against the police and they're following legal orders
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.960]  beating up people because they're not wearing a mask whether they're black or white i'm all
[50:20.960 --> 50:25.520]  about going after bad cops i'm all about going after the police state but the police state's
[50:25.520 --> 50:32.400]  the globalist hyping up a bunch of dumb people black and white to go out and to
[50:34.240 --> 50:40.240]  shoot cops in the head for no reason or just random white people pull into blm checkpoints
[50:40.240 --> 50:44.080]  or at antiva checkpoints they just shoot you in the head and when they shoot some old white
[50:44.080 --> 50:49.440]  dude in the head because he didn't stop it's on the local news and that's it you see white people
[50:49.440 --> 50:55.200]  when they see a crowd of antifa or black folks killing innocent white person freaking out and
[50:55.200 --> 50:59.680]  going and killing a bunch of white people but i'll tell you what's going on
[51:01.920 --> 51:05.360]  they're trying to get crazy white people to go out and kill a bunch of black people
[51:05.360 --> 51:09.680]  so you'll see a black church get shot up or something god forbid and then they're going to
[51:09.680 --> 51:15.120]  trigger the real race war ladies and gentlemen and that's all this is and the average black person
[51:15.120 --> 51:19.760]  the average white person sees through it but when the left and the corporate media are pushing this
[51:19.760 --> 51:24.240]  and saying there's an epidemic of black men being killed by police to where you see every day black
[51:24.240 --> 51:30.160]  guy goes into a auto parts store goes into a shop and just kills a random white dude or stabs a
[51:30.160 --> 51:35.360]  random white dude or shoots them because they go well i gotta get even because they're killing all
[51:35.360 --> 51:42.640]  of us that's the public it's just like you have a point zero zero zero something chance of dying
[51:42.640 --> 51:47.280]  of covid now they keep downgrading it downgrading it downgrading it it does kill people on a blue
[51:47.280 --> 51:52.480]  moon if you're really sick and have three you know code morbidities so it's not a total hoax but
[51:52.480 --> 51:57.920]  you know it's not like an easter bunny doesn't exist i mean it's kind of like a duckbill platypus
[51:57.920 --> 52:02.800]  there are a couple of them but there's almost super rare it's like a white rhino i mean they exist
[52:02.800 --> 52:09.520]  but they'll soon be in unicorn land they won't exist soon you know it's like people with two heads
[52:09.520 --> 52:16.640]  they do exist there's not a lot of so there is covid but man you go around everywhere people think
[52:16.640 --> 52:21.840]  it's real you tell them hey statistically they're i know somebody died and i go how old were they 87
[52:21.840 --> 52:26.320]  with cancer well you know they put that on the destiny of shut up you don't know what you're
[52:26.320 --> 52:30.880]  talking about it's the same thing hey i've been at these black lives matter protests those have
[52:30.880 --> 52:34.480]  had her name has been attacked she's like statistically you're more likely to drown than
[52:34.480 --> 52:43.840]  be killed by a cop shut up white supremacists it's the invincible level of the ignorance that is
[52:43.840 --> 52:52.880]  staggering and so two la county deputies fighting for their lives after ambush shooting search for
[52:52.880 --> 52:57.840]  suspect underway they said it was a black man a man with dark skin video shows two deputies
[52:57.840 --> 53:07.680]  ambush shot while inside patrol vehicle in Compton two la sheriff's deputies again were taken
[53:08.240 --> 53:16.080]  to the hospital for gunshot wounds BLM responds by rushing to the scene we hope they die
[53:16.080 --> 53:22.560]  protesters gather outside hospital treating two california deputies in critical condition and
[53:22.560 --> 53:28.560]  then they come over to the cops saying we hope you die we hope they die we're going to kill you
[53:28.560 --> 53:33.360]  and then when the cops walk out with their hands on their guns they go what the hell are you doing
[53:33.360 --> 53:38.560]  you're abusing me it's like when you run out and jump on somebody's car they try to go around you
[53:38.560 --> 53:42.640]  you try to pull them out of the car and they get out and beat your ass and then you squeal and yell
[53:42.640 --> 53:52.560]  for the police this is mental illness this is brainwashing this is people that literally believe
[53:52.560 --> 53:55.920]  that they're actually under attack when they're not look i got a bunch of the cops that are dead
[53:55.920 --> 54:00.480]  rest in peace interest in county sheriff's deputy ryan indricks shot and killed in cold blood
[54:00.480 --> 54:05.680]  investigating a vehicle breaking i got i got all these stacks here are just dead cops executed
[54:05.680 --> 54:10.800]  but nobody cares about them and it's not about kissing the police's ass it's about kissing the
[54:10.800 --> 54:16.080]  ass of reality ladies and gentlemen that it's rare to be killed by the cops does it happen yes
[54:16.080 --> 54:21.200]  are the cops sometimes wrong absolutely and they face prison when they do who wants that job but
[54:21.200 --> 54:26.560]  in this case let's go ahead i already showed you the surveillance video of the person walking up
[54:26.560 --> 54:32.080]  and shooting the police and running off this happened every day in america all because they
[54:32.080 --> 54:36.640]  were police all because they were white they leave people shoot black cops too remember this happened
[54:36.640 --> 54:44.080]  last election cycle 2016 2018 soros turns it on so let's just play the clips clip two three and
[54:44.080 --> 54:48.960]  four just back to back this is at the hospital with the deputies fighting for their life and
[54:48.960 --> 55:02.960]  then these people show up here it is these pigs out here they are telling us that we cannot come
[55:02.960 --> 55:08.800]  in here and see these individuals who have been shot down at the mother f***ing train station
[55:08.800 --> 55:17.200]  you know what i'm saying there's no hesitation allowed sir okay this is a public this is a public
[55:17.200 --> 55:23.040]  hospital right here we're here to see the cops they it's a private hospital sir it's a private
[55:23.040 --> 55:28.800]  hospital it's a public no it's not it's not telling you it's a private hospital you need to go
[55:28.800 --> 55:34.640]  to public you need to go to black lives matter demanding a bit in the hospital
[55:34.640 --> 55:41.520]  over there and the mother f***ing car these are only uh uh phones they're not guns put that
[55:41.520 --> 55:48.080]  f*** that punk put it down that's why that's why you're f***ing dying one by one
[55:49.920 --> 55:52.640]  put that f***ing down you're next with the f***ing out pocket
[55:52.640 --> 56:01.680]  I mean obviously if you show up saying I hope they die at the hospital they're fighting their
[56:01.680 --> 56:06.320]  life people know you're crazy so the cops are gonna have their guns out yeah that's where you feel
[56:06.320 --> 56:15.040]  big and bad huh take that f*** off take it off take it off and they go on for like 30 minutes
[56:15.040 --> 56:20.240]  and we're gonna kill you you're gonna die you're gonna die one by one a lot of mother f***ing coming
[56:20.240 --> 56:31.600]  out here I mean while 2 000 black males die here in Chicago 97 killed by other black males
[56:35.760 --> 56:40.880]  the rarest way for a black man to die is by cop most common way is by other black men
[56:41.920 --> 56:45.680]  or in the womb but these people don't care about that they've been told by the media
[56:45.680 --> 56:49.880]  the cops of the enemy and they actually believe it. They believe the news.
[56:49.880 --> 56:57.880]  I thought there's so many of these videos. I literally watched an hour out this morning.
[56:57.880 --> 57:01.520]  The crew, I just randomly sent them a bunch of links. This isn't even the bad stuff.
[57:01.520 --> 57:07.120]  They say you're going to die. We're going to kill you one by one. Then they wonder why
[57:07.120 --> 57:21.080]  the cops have guns. Now they're saying they hope that they die. Again, ladies and gentlemen,
[57:21.080 --> 57:25.940]  this is all George Soros. Why is he not arrested? Now they admit that Mueller's people destroyed
[57:25.940 --> 57:29.600]  30 plus phones with evidence of criminal activity. Why aren't they arrested? That's why they're
[57:29.600 --> 57:35.440]  doing this because it's a criminal takeover. It's a criminal move on civilization and society.
[57:35.440 --> 57:39.760]  Absolutely no self-awareness. If you go to a hospital where people have been shot for
[57:39.760 --> 57:44.600]  no reason, 500 lives, saying you hope they die. We'll be back with our number two, Roger
[57:44.600 --> 57:48.520]  Stern. Stay with us.
[57:48.520 --> 57:54.200]  The clock is ticking on the once free world and the free press is under attack more than
[57:54.200 --> 58:00.320]  ever. I now see videos 10 or 15 times a day without even trying to find them of press
[58:00.320 --> 58:04.920]  being arrested in the United States, press being arrested in Canada, the UK, Europe, Australia,
[58:04.920 --> 58:09.800]  and New Zealand. It's always the so-called liberal left, the defenders of speech doing
[58:09.800 --> 58:15.720]  it. They are the authoritarians. They work for the Chai Con Globalist Combine. They
[58:15.720 --> 58:22.040]  are working around the clock to silence info wars. Just as we were the group they started
[58:22.040 --> 58:26.880]  with three years ago, they test out everything new on us. A lot of what I can't get into
[58:26.880 --> 58:30.800]  on air at this point, I'll be able to reveal this later, but I just want to make you all
[58:30.800 --> 58:36.280]  realize that your support, your word of mouth, your prayer is absolutely essential and I
[58:36.280 --> 58:40.680]  thank you all for it. But whatever you do, take advantage of the great products that

[58:49.720 --> 58:54.840]  There is a metaphysical rule that God has put in place that controls the universe and
[58:54.840 --> 58:59.760]  it's free will. That's why the social engineers, the robber barons, the globalists, the post
[58:59.760 --> 59:07.400]  humanists, the anti-humans openly tell you what they're doing and openly tell you that
[59:07.400 --> 59:11.560]  your word will succrap and you need to die because that will save the earth. They do
[59:11.560 --> 59:16.480]  everything they can to make the most dystopian, ugly future they can in the movies and in
[59:16.480 --> 59:21.200]  the culture and in all the different publications. They are making you hate yourself. They are
[59:21.200 --> 59:24.840]  making you be depressed. They are making you not have a connection to God because they
[59:24.840 --> 59:28.800]  just want you to die so they can selfishly control the future. And that's what all this
[59:28.800 --> 59:33.040]  is about. They say they're setting up world government to protect us all from our super
[59:33.040 --> 59:37.840]  technologies. While they're the ones running around like mad scientists endangering the
[59:37.840 --> 59:42.800]  whole planet with a lot of these technologies, the globalists are what is disruptive to human
[59:42.800 --> 1:00:05.800]  species. They call us disruptive to their power grab. It's time to say no.
[1:00:05.800 --> 1:00:12.800]  This perfect storm, the debate is over around climate change. Just come to the state of
[1:00:12.800 --> 1:00:17.400]  California. Observe it with your own eyes. It's not an intellectual debate, it's not
[1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:24.320]  even a debate. Look at that monster. The debate is over around climate change. California's
[1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:31.880]  rogue governor says the fires are due to climate change. But anyone with a modicum of awareness
[1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:39.560]  knows that this is an outrageous lie. We know exactly what causes the California wildfire.
[1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:46.920]  It is the result of two factors. Dry seasons and people. Official state records have only
[1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:54.640]  been kept since the 1950s. And 2020 has been the most destructive season on record. But
[1:00:54.640 --> 1:01:00.160]  this isn't a new phenomenon. And the fires of the past were more destructive than the
[1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:05.920]  modern era. Through studies of tree rings and other natural evidence, researchers have
[1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:11.440]  documented multiple droughts in California during the past thousand years, including
[1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:18.440]  one that began in the year 850, which lasted two and a half centuries. Before European
[1:01:18.440 --> 1:01:24.320]  settlers arrived in California, indigenous peoples used controlled burns to manage the
[1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:31.360]  dry season and to increase and improve their harvest. It is estimated they would burn 4.4
[1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:38.360]  million acres of forest each year. And that is twice as much as 2020. Studies have shown
[1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:46.640]  that 97% of all forest fires are caused by humans. Smoking, campfires and other accidents
[1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:52.480]  have always been a problem. Experts blame the recent wildfires on fire suppression and
[1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:58.760]  overabundance of wood fuel. One of the reasons why the indigenous people burned so much forest
[1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:06.160]  was to keep this under control. Aside from human accidents, there is also arson. And
[1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:12.400]  we have seen plenty of arson in 2020. It's been sort of the theme. If this country doesn't
[1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:18.960]  give us what we want, then we will burn down this system and replace it. Several people
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:24.720]  have been arrested for starting fires along the entire West Coast. Homeowners are catching
[1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:30.960]  arsonists on their property. There are reports of people throwing Molotov cocktails out of
[1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:44.160]  moving vehicles on the freeway. And there are videos of arsonists setting people's homes
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:50.420]  on fire. We know for certain that at least one of the arrested arsonists is directly
[1:02:50.420 --> 1:03:00.840]  involved with the BLM Antifa movement. And the rest certainly seem to fit the bill. Local
[1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:06.000]  news is reporting on it. A man has been arrested accused of starting this fire. One of two
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:11.560]  men accused of intentionally setting fire to fields along freeways. But the FBI and
[1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:18.200]  the mainstream media are in full denial. A Clackamas County Sheriff's deputy was placed
[1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:23.840]  on administrative leave after warning locals about coordinated arson attacks. What I'm
[1:03:23.840 --> 1:03:28.280]  worried about is that there's people stashing stuff, right? It means that they're going
[1:03:28.280 --> 1:03:34.320]  to go in person preparation. And I don't want to sound like some doomsdayer, but it's getting
[1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:40.640]  serious. And the Democrat Party is telling you it is all climate change. Mother Earth
[1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:46.080]  is angry. She's telling us whether she's telling us with hurricanes on the Gulf Coast,
[1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:52.080]  fires in the West, whatever it is that the climate crisis is real and has an impact.
[1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:57.920]  And telling you that the fires will soon come to your town if you don't vote for climate
[1:03:57.920 --> 1:04:04.240]  change. What we're experiencing right here is coming to community all across the United
[1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:09.040]  States of America unless we get our act together on climate change. Which is a pretty nasty
[1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:15.600]  threat considering how many cities across America have burned by the hands of radical
[1:04:15.600 --> 1:04:24.320]  leftists over the summer. The 2006 film apocalyptic beautifully illustrated how the ancient Mayans
[1:04:24.320 --> 1:04:30.360]  advanced knowledge of astronomy could have been used to frighten the superstitious masses
[1:04:30.360 --> 1:04:37.040]  into offering their own to be sacrificed on the altar of false idols who had the power
[1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:43.920]  to blacken out the sun. And there is nothing new under the sun. People today will throw
[1:04:43.920 --> 1:04:49.360]  away their children's birthright because of ignorance, faith and false idols and their
[1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:58.080]  blatant lies. For info wars dot com. This is Greg Reese reports on info or share it.
[1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:04.640]  I don't want to be right about this prediction. In fact, it's it's not a prediction. It is
[1:05:04.640 --> 1:05:10.640]  a forecast that we continue down the economic road. We're on globally with the ongoing COVID-19
[1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:15.520]  lockdowns and the structure to productivity. It will continue to accelerate these ripple
[1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:20.000]  effects that are breaking down supply chains that will star tens of millions of additional
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:25.040]  people in the third world and destroy decades of human infrastructure that's been built.
[1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:29.840]  It will annihilate the funding of that and put the entire first world in even deeper
[1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:35.760]  debt, which we're being maneuvered into. So I really think the smart move is to end all
[1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:41.280]  these lockdowns immediately and prosecute the people that launched the giant COVID scam,
[1:05:41.280 --> 1:05:46.640]  the giant COVID con game. There's really just a big power grab. But in case we can't reverse
[1:05:46.640 --> 1:05:50.160]  all this, we better start digging in and get storeable food and getting prepared to be
[1:05:50.160 --> 1:05:53.920]  self-sufficient because that's the name of their game is to make us dependent on them. So get
[1:05:53.920 --> 1:06:15.200]  self-sufficient now in full wars.com Well, Roger Stone is out in Reno, Nevada,
[1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:20.080]  covering the Trump event there doing a bunch of big speaking engagements and private events.
[1:06:20.080 --> 1:06:25.600]  And we're really appreciating him ducking out into a little studio area to talk to us for
[1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:31.520]  just 30 minutes or so. And then he's got to go. Is it true that Roger Stone, again,
[1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:36.640]  this is Alex Jones' show he's tuned in second hour Sunday broadcast. Is it true that Roger Stone
[1:06:38.080 --> 1:06:45.600]  called for martial law to be declared if Trump loses the election? No. Roger was on the main,
[1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:51.840]  I guess, Wednesday and we went over the headlines that were in Reuters, AP, everywhere.
[1:06:51.840 --> 1:06:58.160]  General Mattis, according to Bob Woodward's book, wanted to accrue and tried to plot accrue, but
[1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:02.640]  he couldn't get people to go along with him. Even though he had John McCain and other Democrats,
[1:07:02.640 --> 1:07:07.200]  John McCain's really a Democrat with him. Now, now we don't just believe what Bob Woodward says,
[1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:10.640]  a lot of it's BS. We went and looked it up. There was a coup back at that time. Roger Stone
[1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:15.680]  covered it then. So by their alchemy, they turned it into Roger Stone calls for that.
[1:07:16.560 --> 1:07:21.120]  Here's the headlines. James Mattis has caught suggesting military coup against Trump.
[1:07:22.720 --> 1:07:25.600]  Paul Greg Roberts, former head of the Treasury came out and said the US
[1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:28.480]  and its constitution have two months left. They're trying to have a coup against Trump.
[1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:33.920]  But here's Forbes. Roger Stone calls on Trump to seize total power
[1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:40.560]  and assert martial law. But could he? Roger Stone tells Trump to bring in martial law.
[1:07:40.560 --> 1:07:45.520]  He loses the election. London Independent. This is since Sider's got a long headline
[1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:50.880]  talking about all the Rogers plans for total power and the seizure of total control.
[1:07:51.680 --> 1:07:56.240]  Meanwhile, real former Jag officers in general has worn that the Democrats have been canvassing
[1:07:56.240 --> 1:08:02.400]  with other Republican rhinos and neocons for just that. And everyone's heard Joe Biden say
[1:08:02.400 --> 1:08:06.080]  the military is going to removing. And Bill Clinton said two weeks ago, the military needs
[1:08:06.080 --> 1:08:11.280]  you're removing and Hillary and Eric Holder and they're all saying it. And Roger comes on and says
[1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:16.480]  Trump has a constitutional right. And so do we to say no to this. He talks about that and they got
[1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:22.080]  really scared and misrepresented. What you said, Rogers, they now admit contesting the election.
[1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:27.440]  As you said months ago on the show and doing all of this and having civil unrest is their plan
[1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:33.280]  because they know Trump is surging in the polls. Roger Stone, thanks for joining us. Alex, I thought
[1:08:33.280 --> 1:08:38.880]  it was very important to get on with you today because I've really actually in 40 years in
[1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:45.760]  American politics, I've never quite seen anything like this. You see, the unhinged left is very
[1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:52.320]  upset because I have exposed what they have planned, although it wasn't very hard because
[1:08:52.320 --> 1:09:00.400]  they talk about it openly. And my public comments can be construed as advising the president to
[1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:07.840]  legally use his powers to thwart what they have coming. I never said in any context,
[1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:13.360]  the president should seize power through martial law if he loses the election.
[1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:20.480]  What I said was if there is overwhelming evidence of fraud, the president absolutely
[1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:26.400]  has the right to use every legal tool, including invoking the Insurrection Act,
[1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:32.960]  martial law, if necessary, since there is violence in our streets and it is directly
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:40.560]  traceable to the Biden-Harris globalist forces. This is one of the most outrageous smears. I
[1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:46.880]  understand it because you see I'm the boogeyman. Oh, Roger Stone, he's a dirty trickster. Based on
[1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:52.560]  my 40 years in American politics, based on my experience in 10 presidential campaigns,
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:59.760]  I'm trying to tell anyone who will listen what needs to happen in the event that we have an
[1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:08.880]  audacious, blatant, outrageous steal of this election. And it is not just the male balance,
[1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:14.880]  the male in-ballots, where the stealing will take place. In fact, there's been too much focus
[1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:22.000]  on that and not enough focus on the old-fashioned methods of vote stealing as practice in places
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:28.400]  like, oh, I don't know, Chicago, Illinois, Palm Beach County, Florida, Broward County, Florida.
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:35.520]  It is absolutely clear that the Democrats are going to vote dead people as they're doing right here
[1:10:35.520 --> 1:10:40.720]  in Clark County, Nevada. They're going to vote people multiple times. I was about to say a bunch
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:45.120]  of state attorney generals have already found the Democrats voting twice just as Trump warned they
[1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:53.600]  would. But this is an attempt, again, at inoculation. They intend to steal this, and they're trying to
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:11:00.720]  signal Trump that he better not dare challenge their illegal actions. And therefore, I was actually
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:06.640]  trending on Twitter yesterday. That's a social media platform where I'd been banned for over
[1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:11.920]  three years. But I want to be very clear, because I went back and I listened to our interview.
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:20.880]  I never said the president should seize power if he's not elected. In fact, the president himself
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:27.200]  has said in a White House news conference, well, of course, if I lost an honest and fair election,
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:32.480]  I would step down. There's no question about that. But that's not what they are talking about.
[1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:40.320]  Well, so this has to be corrected. The Guardian, CNN, the Daily Beast, all the usual suspects,
[1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:47.600]  all of the corporately owned fake news fountains, the people that constantly spew falsehoods about
[1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:55.440]  info wars about you, about me. The reason they hate info wars and us so much is because we're
[1:11:55.440 --> 1:12:01.440]  letting people know what is really about to happen. We're exposing their plans.
[1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:05.760]  I was about to say they always project. They're the ones saying use the military. They're the
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:09.360]  ones saying they're going to lose and they're going to contest it and use that for civil unrest.
[1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:12.880]  They're the ones saying they want to coup. And then we're like, how do we respond to this criminal
[1:12:12.880 --> 1:12:15.920]  activity? And then you went to the Constitution and what the president should do?
[1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:22.000]  Well, not only that, but yes, I did say federal agents, in this case, federal marshals, can in
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:27.360]  pound ballots in states where there are disputes to ensure that there are no tampering with those
[1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:34.960]  ballots. That's called the law. That's how it works. So this hysteria is because we have tipped
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:40.880]  the American people and perhaps the people around the president into what is about to happen.
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:47.360]  You notice in this interview that he gave with Judge Jeanine Pirro, someone I like very much,
[1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:54.160]  when she asked him about the potential for election fraud and stealing the 2020 election,
[1:12:54.160 --> 1:13:00.160]  the president said, we'll shut it down in a second. Well, I think that's optimistic. The president's
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:06.080]  not a lawyer, but it's more insidious than that. It's going to be multi-state. It's going to be
[1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:12.880]  multi-jurisdictional. It'll be in some courts, not in other courts. Meanwhile, how do we know
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:21.040]  that the BLM and Tifa forces do not intend to intimidate voters from going to the polling
[1:13:21.040 --> 1:13:26.000]  places? I think that is exactly- Oh, by the way, the group Soros just set up to manage all this.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:30.320]  The election transition team, as they call it, publicly run by him says,
[1:13:30.320 --> 1:13:34.160]  we're going to shut down all the cities. We're going to shut down the polling places. They're
[1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:38.080]  actually saying they're going to be there protecting them and then shutting them down and taking
[1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:44.240]  control and absolutely trying to lock down the country. Here's a message for Attorney General Barr.
[1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:51.200]  Voter intimidation is a federal crime. They have just announced that they plan to do it.
[1:13:51.760 --> 1:13:59.600]  Sir, do your job. Please do your job. When they say that we intimidate voters,
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:05.760]  it is baseless. We've never intimidated voters. In fact, I happen to think the bigger the turnout,
[1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:10.800]  the better it is for Donald Trump and the Republicans. But you're right. It's absolute
[1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:17.360]  projection. Their criminal plans have been laid bare. They don't want any opposition.
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:24.000]  And when we go out there and we sound the clarion call so people know what is about to happen,
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:29.120]  they smear us. It's outrageous. Roger, when we come back to talk about outrageous,
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:31.840]  I keep hearing that Durham's going to do something and they've indicted one FBI
[1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:38.640]  lawyer that falsified documents about the president, about you, about others with Russia gate garbage.
[1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:44.560]  Durham, I mean, we have 30 plus phones by the whole Mueller investigation being wiped, just like
[1:14:44.560 --> 1:14:51.440]  Hillary wiping the servers and bleach bidding it, that the arrogance, the hubris of these people
[1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:55.440]  is just absolutely unparalleled because they think they're never going to get in trouble,
[1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:59.600]  which invites the next big scam. We'll come back to Roger Stone on the other studies out in Reno,
[1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:04.000]  Nevada, the president's giving his speech. Now, there's so much more to get into here today.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:09.600]  Roger Stone, of course, has a lot of great websites. Roger, what's the best website for people to visit?
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:14.800]  These days, I think people should go to StoneColdTruth.com, where I'm resuming broadcasting
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:20.320]  and reporting on American politics. StoneColdTruth.com. And just for losers and viewers out there,
[1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:24.880]  we're burning the candle at both ends. We're up here seven days a week. Owen Schreuer does a two-hour
[1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:30.880]  Sunday show now called Sunday Live, two hours right after this, only six minutes of ads. We're doing
[1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:34.240]  that right through the election. The crew is working around the clock. So am I. We're doing
[1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:38.640]  the best job we can. This is the time to be involved and just spread the word about this
[1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:43.600]  live show. Take the live feed right now and email it, text message it, Twitter it, Facebook it,
[1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:46.880]  YouTube it, word of mouth it and tell folks what the local station you're listening to. That isn't
[1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:52.640]  just important. It's everything. You are everything, Paul Revere. Tell folks about the show now. I
[1:15:52.640 --> 1:15:58.800]  know you are. Well, Mark Zuckerberg on paper two weeks ago put in hundreds of millions of
[1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:04.480]  dollars with Bloomberg to launch this operation, Red Mirage, to contest the election when it's
[1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:09.680]  overwhelmingly clear that Trump has won on election night. Now he's come out in a statement
[1:16:09.680 --> 1:16:14.400]  and told all the media in the United States that they better get behind saying that Trump basically
[1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:19.200]  lost, that they're not going to let Trump declare victory even though it's overwhelming. They'll
[1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:23.840]  have 95% of the vote done on election night. And even if you added all the other votes in,
[1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:29.120]  against him, he'd be the winner. They are going to steal this election. They're preparing everyone.
[1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:34.160]  You've seen all the scams they've already run. Trump is surrounded by tyrants, but he has we the
[1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:40.080]  people and he has true media, not independent media, the real media. So now more than ever,
[1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:44.080]  it's critical to share the live streams, the videos, the articles and the information in
[1:16:44.080 --> 1:16:49.280]  full wars.com because the globalist fear at most things. We were the first to expose their plan
[1:16:49.280 --> 1:16:55.600]  to contest the election and drag it out to keep the American people from reelecting President Trump.
[1:16:57.040 --> 1:17:03.360]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands.
[1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:07.680]  But if you were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that, you think it was magic.
[1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:11.280]  You wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:15.760]  So for that person, it would be spiritual or it would be something of the spirit.
[1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:20.960]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies, any other species of animal,
[1:17:20.960 --> 1:17:24.880]  know how to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:29.680]  They're following magnetic lines. They have magnetic cells in their brains. We now know
[1:17:29.680 --> 1:17:33.840]  scientific what's going on. There's even a lot more than that. So when we talk about the spirit,
[1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:37.200]  we're talking about all the dark matter. We're talking about all the things you don't understand,
[1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:42.000]  but we know it's there. And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off the wireless system,
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:47.440]  that's what's going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people.
[1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:52.800]  And that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a consciousness
[1:17:52.800 --> 1:17:58.800]  manipulated through the space-time continuum. You've always had a pledge from me and it's
[1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:03.920]  that I'll come to you with the truth, at least as good as my human temporal truth can get.
[1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:08.720]  Because as the Bible says, we all see through a rose-colored darkly kind of a foggy lens that
[1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:13.680]  distorts what we actually can perceive so that everything we do is actually a fallen sin.
[1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:19.120]  Everything we do is actually a twisted distortion of God's will. So when I tell you the truth,
[1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:25.440]  it's the best truth this fallen creature's got. But I'll tell you, it's all I got. And when I tell
[1:18:25.440 --> 1:18:31.120]  you, this country and the world is under a major satanic threat, you don't need me to tell you
[1:18:31.120 --> 1:18:35.120]  that. You can look out the window, you can look into your own family, you can turn on the news,
[1:18:35.120 --> 1:18:40.400]  you can see it. But you've got this commitment. I do recognize the truth of God and so do you.
[1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:44.560]  We're going to win this fight, but it's going to be hard. And I want to keep info wars in the
[1:18:44.560 --> 1:18:48.800]  main position to fight. And it only happens when you support what you've been doing. So again,
[1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:54.320]  I thank you, but go to infowarstore.com, buy the product, spread the word, because that's how
[1:18:54.320 --> 1:19:01.200]  we're going to win. Again, I thank you all. Ignorance does not equal bliss. Ignorance equals
[1:19:01.200 --> 1:19:06.080]  slavery. If you're ignorant, walking through a field at night that there's a six foot
[1:19:06.640 --> 1:19:11.600]  pole up ahead, you're going to step in it and probably break your ankle or maybe worse. Well,
[1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:17.920]  it's the same thing happening to human civilization. The industrialized age really empowered humanity
[1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:21.840]  in many respects, but also took us away from the land and made us very, very domesticated and very,
[1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:27.520]  very easy to manipulate. And now corruption and predatory activity can hide behind that complexity.
[1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:32.560]  Now, I know what's going on behind the complexity because I go read what the UN and the Rockefeller
[1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:37.520]  Foundation and the Davos Group and the Bilderberg Group and all their subsidiaries like the Club
[1:19:37.520 --> 1:19:44.960]  of Rome say. So I know exactly what's going on, not because I'm even that cool or special a person,
[1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:50.240]  but I'm actually want to be empowered and informed because I'm a history buff. I know that those
[1:19:50.240 --> 1:19:53.600]  that don't know history, don't repeat it. The globalists think you're stupid. They laugh at you
[1:19:53.600 --> 1:20:02.160]  because you won't research their own admissions. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:30.320]  U.S. Marshall's killing Portland suspect was retribution. All of it out of context. All of it
[1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:35.680]  is info. It's the Democrats and the deep state. They're Chinese communist backers. The Pelosi
[1:20:35.680 --> 1:20:40.880]  and Biden admitting they work for communist China against America in open treason saying
[1:20:42.240 --> 1:20:46.640]  that they're going to have the military remove Trump and that if they lose, they're going to
[1:20:46.640 --> 1:20:51.120]  contest it and plunge the country into civil war and John Podesta two months ago in the New
[1:20:51.120 --> 1:20:55.200]  York Times in their wargaming. The highest levels of the Democratic Party say we'll have
[1:20:55.840 --> 1:21:03.280]  liberal states secede, plunging us into the second American civil war in Rob Reiner's own words.
[1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:10.480]  But then they turn it around and say, Roger Stone, he's the one doing it. But they
[1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:16.640]  quote a word here, quote a word there. Yes, you use the word martial law because they brought us
[1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:21.600]  into a form of martial law where they're attacking police. What do you make of the Democrats
[1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:27.920]  celebrating two cops shot in LA for no reason? And then Black Lives Matter coming to the hospital
[1:21:27.920 --> 1:21:33.200]  and chanting and cheering and saying, we hope you die. People say, well, this will never work. Well,
[1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:36.880]  it will work if people are intimidated. I mean, the police are already intimidated doing
[1:21:36.880 --> 1:21:41.520]  anything about leftist demonstrators. Where do you see all this going, Roger? Well, first of all,
[1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:49.520]  I think the Department of Justice needs to lay out in a formal fashion the absolute indisputable
[1:21:49.520 --> 1:21:56.000]  ties between these left wing violent groups in our streets and the Biden-Harris campaign
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:02.480]  and the central management of this socialist revolution in our streets. Because the Democrats
[1:22:03.120 --> 1:22:09.040]  are trying to act like, oh, that's not us, but it is them. I think it is a vast overplaying of
[1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:14.720]  their hand. And what I mean by that is I believe that they are galvanizing the silent majority.
[1:22:15.360 --> 1:22:25.280]  They are intensifying the desire of Trump voters to vote and to go out and find others to do so.
[1:22:25.280 --> 1:22:32.480]  I detect among people I just speak to anecdotally that there is growing support for the president.
[1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:38.240]  I believe he is gaining in this election. I believe people are reticent to tell that
[1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:44.160]  to a pollster they don't know or some person on the phone claiming to be a pollster that they don't
[1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:49.360]  know because they don't want to be harassed. I think particularly in the states like Wisconsin
[1:22:49.920 --> 1:22:57.680]  and Michigan, where they have really raped and pillaged those communities, it is hurting them
[1:22:57.680 --> 1:23:06.400]  in the blue collar Catholic union normally democratic suburbs. So I think in an odd way this
[1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:12.240]  is playing to the advantage of the president. I agree with you. I see it as part of the larger
[1:23:12.240 --> 1:23:17.360]  ongoing global realignment against the satanic left, but they're counter striking. Why do you
[1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:22.320]  think Soros on the left did this card because it worked in Ukraine, worked in the Arab Spring,
[1:23:22.320 --> 1:23:25.760]  worked in other areas? Why do they keep running the same communist playbook?
[1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:31.840]  Because it is born of frustration. You see, the Russian collusion hoax was so perfect.
[1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:37.280]  They had the full force and the authority of the United States Justice Department.
[1:23:38.080 --> 1:23:45.840]  They actually had authority vested in Robert Mueller to investigate anybody and anything
[1:23:45.840 --> 1:23:52.320]  he wanted, and he did. When Rod Rosenstein, the acting attorney general two weeks ago said,
[1:23:52.880 --> 1:23:58.800]  oh, I actually told Mueller not to investigate Trump's ties to Russia, and he never really did.
[1:23:58.800 --> 1:24:06.000]  That's a lie. He signed three scope memos that gave Mueller the broadest possible authority,
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:11.760]  and I can assure you they went all over me like a practice logical examination,
[1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:16.160]  and they were looking for Russians or Russian connections, and they couldn't find any.
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:22.640]  This is not the first time Rosenstein has lied, but usually he lies under oath before Congress.
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:27.360]  I just asked the rhetorical question. When will he be charged, Mr. Barr?
[1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:32.720]  When will he be charged? Well, that was my next question. What about the 30 plus missing phones
[1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:38.960]  of the entire Russia hoax group, the Russiagate coup d'etat group handing their phones back
[1:24:38.960 --> 1:24:45.840]  classically wiped? Some of them smashed. Destruction of evidence in a federal investigation
[1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:53.920]  is a felony with a 20 year penalty. Mr. Barr? I honestly, this is getting to the point of
[1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:59.040]  absurdity. By the way, Alex, this is not the first time that Mueller's dirty cops have destroyed
[1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:05.680]  evidence that would be useful. And then yesterday, you see that they're very clever. As soon as the
[1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:13.360]  story regarding Mueller's dirty cops, including Andrew Weisman, destroying the memories of the
[1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:20.400]  cell phones hit the mainstream media, although I didn't see an NBC or CBS or ABC story on it.
[1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:26.640]  How about that? They immediately changed the narrative by leaking a story that one of John
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:35.280]  Durham's associate prosecutors has resigned, reportedly, to protest political pressure
[1:25:35.280 --> 1:25:42.080]  to speed up their investigation. Reportedly, no one has any confirmation of that. The woman
[1:25:42.080 --> 1:25:49.200]  prosecutor has denied that, or pardon me, she declines to confirm that. It's not in her resignation
[1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:54.400]  letter. But the purpose here was to get the story about Mueller's destruction of evidence,
[1:25:54.400 --> 1:25:59.840]  illegal, off the front page. Well, obviously, here's my problem. It affects you. It's important.
[1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:03.760]  But if they're never going to do anything, it almost becomes, like Tucker Carlson has said,
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:08.000]  a distraction to keep saying two more weeks, one is Durham going to do something. And then just more
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:12.640]  of their corruption keeps coming out. So it becomes a form of them just rubbing it into us
[1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:16.240]  that they've done all this. And you know, behind the scenes, what they've been doing to me. And I
[1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:20.160]  mean, I'm not a wimp. I can handle it. But my God, these people are raving criminals.
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:27.760]  Well, and the fact that we are this close to the election gives the Democrats, sadly, a legitimate
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:33.120]  argument. I mean, traditionally, the Justice Department does not bring criminal indictments
[1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:37.200]  in a political matter. But traditions out the window. They're talking about martial law and
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:41.680]  killing Trump and overthrowing him in the military. I mean, doesn't the Justice Department and Trump
[1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:47.440]  yet they're not in Kansas anymore, that there is an internal criminal group ally with Communist China
[1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:50.640]  openly trying to overthrow the country and cause a damn civil war?
[1:26:51.920 --> 1:26:56.960]  No, when we say things like that, they think we are quote unquote, conspiracy theorists.
[1:26:56.960 --> 1:27:02.320]  When in fact, they are the ones who are conspiracy theorists, they continue to say, I said,
[1:27:02.320 --> 1:27:07.200]  Jack, Jake Tapper, this guy's a real piece of work. He has special on CNN the other night
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:12.080]  on Russian collusion. This was one of the great golden old these shows of all time.
[1:27:12.640 --> 1:27:17.200]  Hey, Jake, there's no evidence whatsoever. Oh, I know they brought it all back. It's in the news
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:20.960]  that I'm a Russian again. I had a guy on the green belt call me a Russian two days ago.
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:26.400]  Paul Manifor Paul Manifor, sorry, Paul Manifor was prosecuted for crimes that had nothing to do
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:32.000]  with Donald Trump, the 2016 election, or the Russians, General Flynn, General Flynn, no,
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:37.440]  General Flynn is innocent. It's indisputable. Roger Stone, I have no connection to the Russians.
[1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:41.680]  That was not among the bogus. And by the way, Roger, talk about electioneering. Look at how
[1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:46.720]  that judge and precedentally won't let Flynn out of his conviction, even though they told him to
[1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:50.720]  reverse it because it's a fraud. The judge just sits there for political reasons. Let's come back
[1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:56.400]  and talk about what Trump needs to do the election. His big incredible Nobel Peace Prize
[1:27:56.400 --> 1:28:02.080]  nominations. And now he really deserves it. And how Biden, I don't know if you saw this,
[1:28:02.080 --> 1:28:07.280]  had to admit, well, he accidentally got all these peace deals. We'll talk about that on the other
[1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:14.000]  side with Roger Stone. I'm Alex Jones with news wars.com and info wars.com. And the globalist
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:18.720]  work around the clock to suppress those and censor those because it's like penicillin for a
[1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:25.280]  country that's got a serious bacterial infection. And you're the white blood cells. You carry the
[1:28:25.280 --> 1:28:32.320]  information. You carry the cure to it. So everyone on local stations are listening to tell somebody
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:35.840]  at a store that a red light right now higher listening, call your wife or husband, tell them
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:40.240]  to an end, tell your son, your daughter, send out email, send out text messages, get excited, say
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:44.320]  the forbidden show. What you're not supposed to hear what they want to put people in prison for
[1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:49.440]  is happening right now. Be the Paul Revere's. If you want to defeat them, you have to do it.
[1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:55.840]  This is not like regular elections. They get back in folks. Hell on earth. We'll talk about it.
[1:29:19.760 --> 1:29:23.920]  To operation and think about all these major corporations. They tell you humans are hard,
[1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:27.600]  but they tell you humans are a parasite. They tell you that we've all got to be gotten rid of. And
[1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:32.480]  then they won't let people see their old folks in nursing homes and then ship in COVID to kill them.
[1:29:32.480 --> 1:29:38.640]  That's all organizing as a beta test for larger operations and everything is a microcosm and
[1:29:38.640 --> 1:29:44.560]  a laboratory test of larger scalability of what they are now beginning to roll out. Look at how
[1:29:44.560 --> 1:29:48.880]  they're banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics. They're absolutely essential
[1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:54.800]  to stop viral infections like COVID-19. This is all absolute information control. This is beyond
[1:29:54.800 --> 1:30:04.080]  1984. Ever wondered why big tech acts in unison to create monopolies and are so incredibly anti-human?
[1:30:04.080 --> 1:30:09.440]  Love to censor people. Love to cover up for corrupt authoritarian regimes and dictatorships. Well,
[1:30:09.440 --> 1:30:14.080]  it's very simple. The first computers ever created were created by Thomas Watson, the founder and
[1:30:14.080 --> 1:30:19.120]  owner of IBM to carry out eugenics. And they helped run the death camps in Nazi Germany. That's what
[1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:24.320]  the tattoos were on the slaves arms. They would decide who lived and who died. So from the beginning
[1:30:24.320 --> 1:30:29.920]  it's been about creating monopolies, cornering markets and making humans obsolete. The same
[1:30:29.920 --> 1:30:33.920]  people brought us baby formula that doesn't have enough protein fat in it to make your child's
[1:30:33.920 --> 1:30:38.720]  brain small. The same people that said put babies in cribs separate from their mothers. The lower
[1:30:38.720 --> 1:30:44.080]  IQ is about 20 points on average as well. These are hardcore eugenics. Survival of the fittest.
[1:30:44.080 --> 1:30:49.680]  Social Darwinists. Grow up world. Admit the truth. With being soft as much. Letting these
[1:30:49.680 --> 1:30:55.040]  loved ones run your lives. They are your mortal enemies. They want you dead. Do you understand
[1:30:55.040 --> 1:31:03.760]  that? Introducing Info Wars Life. Pure turmeric extract. This is taken under the tongue. It is
[1:31:03.760 --> 1:31:10.640]  pure turmeric. It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken
[1:31:10.640 --> 1:31:16.720]  as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines. This is absorbed under the tongue
[1:31:16.720 --> 1:31:21.280]  into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach. So it's
[1:31:21.280 --> 1:31:26.480]  more of an intense delivery system. The two formulas are different but both are concentrates
[1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:30.480]  and our first product got rave reviews. We've now been testing this out for several months.
[1:31:30.480 --> 1:31:35.760]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies. Some like bodies better. For me, they're both amazing
[1:31:35.760 --> 1:31:40.720]  for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more and they fund the M4. So get our new liquid

[1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:00.960]  I know I say it all the time but I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I want to thank you the
[1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:06.720]  listeners and viewers this broadcast and all the stations and all the affiliates and sponsors
[1:32:06.720 --> 1:32:12.240]  and my family and the crew and just everybody out there. The listeners and viewers as you said,
[1:32:12.880 --> 1:32:17.360]  this is such an epic struggle and we've all been proven dead on. We've been proven we're right
[1:32:17.360 --> 1:32:21.600]  because we're being led by God. We have a spirit and we're very humble about that. This is not us.
[1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:26.960]  This is God working through us but man now it's so precious to stay on air. I used to think you
[1:32:26.960 --> 1:32:32.000]  know maybe I'll wake a bunch of people up and I can kind of recede into the background because
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:36.720]  fighting this thing 18 hours a day gets a little bit old but now with the evil so out in the open
[1:32:36.720 --> 1:32:40.480]  and everything we've said being vindicated. I never questioned what I was saying because I knew it
[1:32:40.480 --> 1:32:44.880]  was true but I did question where they'd ever actually try to carry it all out. Well now we
[1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:49.120]  know they're going to carry it out and then some so we got to fight and I just really appreciate
[1:32:49.120 --> 1:32:53.360]  you and we're in this together and praise God past the ammunition of the info war. Again take
[1:32:53.360 --> 1:33:02.160]  action folks this is it. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:10.400 --> 1:33:17.520]  Waging war on corruption. It's Roger Stone and Alex Jones 50 days out where we were four years ago.
[1:33:17.520 --> 1:33:24.240]  Incredible times. The West and East Coast are collapsing or what's fleeing the leftist but they
[1:33:25.200 --> 1:33:30.000]  are going to engage in massive election fraud, double voting, dead people voting,
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:34.320]  mail and ballot scams you name it. Roger and I during that little three minute break had a big
[1:33:34.320 --> 1:33:41.280]  discussion. Roger Trump's got a lot of people still in his orbit that are non-confrontationalist.
[1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:47.840]  What was the word you use? I think WIMPs as named pussycats and look we don't want to be in that
[1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:52.160]  orbit. We're trying to save the country. What is your advice to the president? You were telling
[1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:55.680]  me during the break you actually think he's a little bit behind right now but gaining. You
[1:33:55.680 --> 1:34:00.160]  think the Democrats are going to win right now via fraud or what? Well if the election were held
[1:34:00.160 --> 1:34:06.800]  today I do think they would win although mostly through fraud. I do think the president is slightly
[1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:13.360]  behind but the momentum is with him, he is gaining. That's largely because he's back out on the stump
[1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:20.560]  and because they have badly overplayed their hand with this violence in a number of American cities
[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:27.520]  but Alex you made a point that I have to come back to but what's going on in the Flynn case is one
[1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:34.000]  of the most outrageous things I have ever seen. Judge Sullivan, Emmett Sullivan does not have
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:40.800]  the legal authority to appoint a special counsel, does not have the legal authority to decide whether
[1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:48.160]  General Flynn should be now be charged with different crimes because he folded to extraordinary
[1:34:48.160 --> 1:34:51.840]  crimes. This is unprecedented, it's an overthrow of the Constitution on his face.
[1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:59.280]  And earlier in the trial you may remember that Sullivan excoriated Flynn from the bench, called
[1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:04.880]  him a traitor, saying that he had worked for the Turkish government while in the employ of the
[1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:11.680]  United States government as a national security advisor, which is not true. So he has demonstrated
[1:35:11.680 --> 1:35:20.240]  his bias against a genuine American war hero, a man who saved lives on the battlefield. Yet the
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:27.040]  appeals court in DC says that Sullivan's does nothing to show his bias. This man is a disgrace
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:32.800]  to the federal bench, he's not the only one in the DC circuit, but if Republicans win the house
[1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:39.600]  there must be impeachment proceedings against a number of these judicial tyrants who think that
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:45.200]  they are not bound by the law or the Constitution, they're only going by... Obviously there's a
[1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:49.600]  power grab by Democrats period, they know they're losing, there's a political realignment, so they're
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:54.480]  trying to bring in an authoritarianism, a censorship, and a judicial tyranny to enforce their power,
[1:35:54.480 --> 1:35:59.440]  to then extinct the Republican Party. And the only question is, do Trump, Mitch McConnell,
[1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:03.760]  and all these Rand Paul get the existential crisis we're in? Do they not get it?
[1:36:05.360 --> 1:36:12.960]  Some do, some don't. Let me say this, if you go to magapetitions.org, there's a great petition
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:18.000]  there to sign for a pardon for General Flynn to end what they're doing to him. I've been through
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  this personally, I know how excruciating it is, I know how difficult it is on a person's family.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  So go to magapetitions.org and just sign the petition, it's free, but we want to get a million
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:35.360]  people to tell the president it's time to end this circus and pardon this great American hero.
[1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:38.480]  Absolutely, and you know, what about Assange? I mean, this is the guy that Trump said,
[1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:44.240]  yeah, WikiLeaks hasn't released it, you know, you've got Snowden has been exonerated, and I mean,
[1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:48.400]  and Trump needs to do this, he needs to put you up on the stage front and center at rallies,
[1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:53.840]  he needs to pardon Snowden, he needs to pardon Assange, that's what America wants to see.
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:59.440]  Let's move on to the good news. How does Biden spend this to say Trump accidentally gets an
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:07.120]  Israeli Bahrain, Israeli UAE, Serbia coast of the deal stops the big crisis with North Korea?
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:13.600]  I mean, this is real beyond Nobel Prize stuff, and the media just tries to ignore it.
[1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:20.880]  No, it's actual statecraft. This is where I give the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner,
[1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:27.520]  well deserved credit. He's worked very hard on a viable peace deal. He deserves credit for that.
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:33.840]  There is no other American president who could have done this because the Israelis trust Donald
[1:37:33.840 --> 1:37:39.600]  Trump and the Saudis trust Donald Trump, and therefore he is able to bring everyone together.
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:45.760]  You notice the story about him being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize appeared almost nowhere.
[1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:52.480]  It appeared in conservative media. Didn't see it on NBC, isn't that strange? Yet if you go back
[1:37:52.480 --> 1:37:59.360]  and look at the coverage, when Obama was nominated for such a prize, on the basis of what I can't
[1:37:59.360 --> 1:38:05.920]  figure out, it was front page news everywhere in America. It was an extraordinary historical
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:12.160]  happening. It's really quite incredible. Well, pulling back from this, Obama wasn't in office yet
[1:38:12.160 --> 1:38:16.080]  when he was given the peace prize, and then he launched a bunch of wars and expanded the air
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:22.400]  of spring and a bunch of horror. But the mere fact that Trump goes out and does this, and not
[1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:27.520]  only did he do the two nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize, he'd ignored, but the peace deals
[1:38:27.520 --> 1:38:31.200]  pretty much get ignored. But then when Biden does respond, again, I want you to respond to this,
[1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:36.320]  he says, oh, he did it by accident. So he's incompetent. He beat the whole political system,
[1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:40.320]  never running for office, and is a maverick. And now he keeps, and he turned the economy around,
[1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:45.200]  and Kregman said would never hit 3%, no magic wand, went to 3.8. And now he gets all these
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:50.160]  peace deals. Wow. So this horrible, incompetent idiot has just defeated all these people.
[1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:58.000]  That means they are lower than whale crap. Well, it is just very typical of the elitism of Joe
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  Biden. Look, before he was slipping mentally, he was a loudmouth, blowhard, braggart, wrong about
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:12.320]  virtually every foreign policy issue during his time in the Senate, took credit for things he had
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:18.480]  nothing whatsoever to do with. For example, I marched with Dr. King. Hey, Joe, no, you didn't.
[1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:25.280]  That's BS. Very typical. But now that he is slipping mentally, and I think that's a fair thing to say,
[1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:32.320]  he has not lost that elitism. See, they look down on Donald Trump, just like they look down on
[1:39:32.320 --> 1:39:38.480]  the people who voted for him. They're smarter than we are, the elites. We have no business even having
[1:39:38.480 --> 1:39:45.280]  an opinion about how the country should be governed. And we both understand that Donald Trump is an
[1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:50.640]  interruption in the war continuum. In other words, it didn't matter whether our presidents were
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:57.680]  Republicans or Democrats, it was immaterial. Bush Clinton, Bush Obama, endless foreign war,
[1:39:57.680 --> 1:40:02.960]  where our inherent national interests were never clear. It was always a prop up globalism. Let
[1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:06.800]  me raise this because get into Donald Trump's character. The fact that when he straight shoots
[1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:11.120]  on a business deal, they always call him a liar. They know he's actually does what he says they'll
[1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:15.520]  do. Talk about Trump's psychology and what he really wants. They say it's just green money. I
[1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:20.240]  don't believe that. I understand that Trump has a larger destiny, a larger view. But these foreign
[1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:24.480]  leaders know that when Trump tells them something, that's what he really thinks. Everybody knows
[1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:30.160]  that about Trump. Isn't that refreshing? Isn't that what people want? Well, to the extent that
[1:40:30.160 --> 1:40:36.400]  the president thinks about his legacy, and I'm sure he does, what greater legacy could you have
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:44.000]  than peacemaker? Donald Trump ran for president as an anti-war candidate. It was the most important
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:49.920]  plank in his platform. The American people were tired of spending billions and losing the lives
[1:40:49.920 --> 1:40:56.240]  of men and women in these endless foreign wars that were used by the Bushes not to fight for
[1:40:56.240 --> 1:41:01.920]  democracy, but to fight for either oil or for political advantage. The people were fed up with
[1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:07.440]  it. And at every step during his administration, which the president has tried to keep his promise
[1:41:07.440 --> 1:41:12.320]  to withdraw our troops. Sure, so shouldn't the left be bending over backwards to support Trump?
[1:41:12.320 --> 1:41:16.000]  They're now the war party. I see national polls that Democrats want more war now.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:21.680]  Yeah, there's no question. The everything is backwards. The Democrats were once big on civil
[1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:27.680]  liberties. Now they love the FBI spying on everybody. The Democrats used to be against war.
[1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:34.400]  Now they think foreign war is the greatest thing since sliced bread. They are used to be against
[1:41:34.400 --> 1:41:40.880]  censorship. Now, Alex Jones, we've got to censor him. We can't let him speak because we can't defeat
[1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:46.800]  his ideas. We can't even we can't even compete with his ideas. So we've got to shut him up.
[1:41:46.800 --> 1:41:52.480]  They're fascists. That's really what it comes down to. None worse than Twitter and Facebook.
[1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:58.400]  These people are hypocrites. But we're winning anyway. There's the irony of it because you cannot
[1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:05.200]  stop the power of an idea. And because Donald Trump, thank God, has the bully pulpit and they
[1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:11.360]  can't silence him. And he speaks from the heart and he understands where the people are. The people
[1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:17.680]  are tired of these riots in our cities. They're tired of the violence. They're tired of the lies.
[1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:24.080]  They're tired of the foreign wars. They really are fed up. I think the silent majority is gaining
[1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:28.000]  in strength. No, I agree. Roger Stone's on fire. I was going to go now, but he's got some time.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:31.520]  We're going to do one more segment and then this show ends and I want Twitter takes over with
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:37.600]  Sunday Live. Only six minutes of ads. Take a lot of calls, special guests. I'm going to ask Roger
[1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:42.560]  then. I know these messages to get to Trump. And by the way, I said he's in Reno. They're in Las
[1:42:42.560 --> 1:42:48.800]  Vegas tonight. Excuse me. Just teleprompter free folks. So I never lied to you consciously. I
[1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:53.040]  move my mistakes. He's in Las Vegas. Roger Stone, straight ahead. Stay with us.
[1:42:53.040 --> 1:43:03.760]  I don't want to be right about this prediction. In fact, it's it's not a prediction. It is a
[1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:09.600]  forecast that we continue down the economic road. We're on globally with the ongoing COVID-19
[1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:14.800]  lockdowns and the structure of productivity. It will continue to accelerate these ripple effects
[1:43:14.800 --> 1:43:19.280]  that are breaking down supply chains that will star tens of millions of additional people in
[1:43:19.280 --> 1:43:25.200]  the third world and destroy decades of human infrastructure that's been built. It will annihilate
[1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:30.000]  the funding of that and put the entire first world in even deeper debt, which we're being
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:36.320]  maneuvered into. So I really think the smart move is to end all these lockdowns immediately
[1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:42.320]  and prosecute the people that launched the giant COVID scam, the giant COVID con game.
[1:43:42.320 --> 1:43:46.880]  There's really just a big power grab. But in case we can't reverse all this, we better start digging
[1:43:46.880 --> 1:43:50.560]  in and get storeable food and getting prepared to be self-sufficient because that's the name of
[1:43:50.560 --> 1:43:55.280]  their game is to make us dependent on them. So get self-sufficient now in full wars.com.
[1:43:56.160 --> 1:44:00.640]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:06.960]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support
[1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:12.320]  and for word of mouth. And we're all this together. And you know, it gets old having to come to you
[1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:16.080]  and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air. But it's true.
[1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:19.600]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[1:44:20.240 --> 1:44:24.560]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors. And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody
[1:44:24.560 --> 1:44:29.200]  else. They crippled all the other groups and we're still here. And as this whole new world order
[1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:33.680]  comes out in the open, our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken off air. That's
[1:44:33.680 --> 1:44:38.480]  why America has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America
[1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:43.840]  still quasi free. You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness
[1:44:43.840 --> 1:44:48.480]  that's about to unfold. Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready. So thank you all
[1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:53.280]  and get an info wars.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more.
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:55.440]  They're wonderful products. Yeah, they support the info. We're thank you.
[1:44:57.040 --> 1:45:00.640]  I talk about all the horrible things that are happening and I point out that the globalist
[1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:05.600]  are eugenics death cult because it's true. I don't say it to scare you. A lot of people say, man,
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:10.240]  this show is dark. Well, you've got to know you're dealing with evil if you're going to defeat it.
[1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:15.600]  And if we just listen to the surface of what the NWO propagandists are saying, they have
[1:45:15.600 --> 1:45:20.240]  reasons to sell this garbage to the general public. But if you just scratch the surface,
[1:45:20.240 --> 1:45:26.240]  they're so arrogant, they've all written detailed blueprints of this plan and more and more being
[1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:32.560]  honest about it. Because there comes a point where as David Ike says, they have to stop hiding it
[1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:38.480]  and start selling it. So we're at the point of the emergence now. And it's coming out in the open.
[1:45:38.480 --> 1:45:44.400]  And some people under mass Stockholm syndrome are going to submit to any level of tyranny
[1:45:44.400 --> 1:45:49.840]  that others are going to fight. This isn't like some old dictatorship that you could submit to it
[1:45:49.840 --> 1:45:55.840]  and join it be okay. No, this thing is post human and exterminism research. What that is
[1:45:57.280 --> 1:46:05.760]  in Germany, in Australia, in Canada, and now even in Ohio, every blue state, every blue city
[1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:12.560]  is announcing that they are establishing emergency COVID centers for people that refuse to be tested
[1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:18.160]  or people that are tested but refuse to stay in place while the results are coming back or those
[1:46:18.160 --> 1:46:23.280]  that supposedly break quarantine. This of course is all based on the tests that are over 90%
[1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:31.840]  fraudulent and were designed to be so. This is a power grab. The world government globalist system
[1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:38.560]  is in trouble. All over the planet, free peoples are trying to pull out of it. And every blue area,
[1:46:38.560 --> 1:46:44.240]  I use the term blue as if in the US for blue for Democrats, red for Republicans, is basically
[1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:50.400]  globalist or communist and authoritarian. And they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian
[1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:54.560]  takeover because they know the world's waiting to them. It's a very simple equation. It's illegal.
[1:46:54.560 --> 1:47:01.680]  We must resist it. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:11.040 --> 1:47:15.840]  Roger Stone is live from Las Vegas, Nevada while Trump's giving a speech.
[1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:20.160]  So a lot of intel there, a lot of research, a lot of meetings coming up tonight.
[1:47:20.160 --> 1:47:28.400]  I'm your host Alex Jones. Coming up, Owen Troyer and Sunday Live for two hours on the local radio
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:35.040]  stations of Pick Us Up. And of course, at infowars.com. Roger, I've never had cancer, thank God,
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:41.680]  but I've watched Family Die of It and I see the battle against it. And I would describe globalism,
[1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:50.640]  the New World Order, just the pedophiles, the left as cancer. It doesn't have a consciousness.
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:55.280]  It just wants to kill. And I see America fighting cancer because you say, oh, the Democrats are
[1:47:55.280 --> 1:48:00.000]  desperate. That's why they're cheering for dead cops and shot cops. And that's why they want the
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:05.120]  country to fall and chanting death to America. That's not far left. That's the mainline Democrats.
[1:48:05.120 --> 1:48:09.680]  Now I'm around them. I see them. They're mentally ill. And I see a huge awakening of Hispanic
[1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:15.280]  Americans, Black Americans, Catholic, blue-collar workers, as you said, in the Rust Belt, purple
[1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:21.280]  states. So then we should be winning by a giant landslide despite fraud. So you're saying, hey,
[1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:25.520]  the globalists are desperate. I agree. But then you look at the numbers, we're neck and neck here,
[1:48:25.520 --> 1:48:34.960]  and I've never had so much, so much concern. The suspense, you can cut it with a damn knife. I
[1:48:34.960 --> 1:48:41.040]  mean, I am in just absolute berserker mode right now. I feel desperate. I feel like I should be
[1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:45.360]  doing more. I feel like I should be working 24 hours a day, but then I get exhausted. And then
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:50.320]  I see the same panic in the enemy. This is not a normal election. This is existential, good versus
[1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:57.040]  evil crisis. Do you agree with that? I absolutely do. I think there are three factors that are
[1:48:57.040 --> 1:49:06.400]  reflected in these polls. First and foremost, of course, is the intimidation factor, the fact that
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:13.440]  because of the activities of an unhinged, corporately-owned fake news media, people are afraid
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:19.040]  to declare their support for the president. There's that bullying overhang that you'll get
[1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:23.360]  shot or killed or screamed at. People watch BLM going to restaurants and attack families.
[1:49:23.360 --> 1:49:27.840]  We go, that'll turn them. No, no, that's intimidation. They think we're wimps. They think America.
[1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:32.080]  That's it. I don't think America will buy this type of intimidation. I expect us all to come
[1:49:32.080 --> 1:49:39.200]  together and throw these bullies off of us. And then, secondarily, is the censorship of
[1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:46.720]  conservatives, Republicans, Christians, libertarians, Trump supporters. In fact, anybody who isn't
[1:49:46.720 --> 1:49:54.320]  a liberal on the social media platforms, which is impacting voter perception. And then lastly,
[1:49:54.320 --> 1:50:02.080]  of course, is the constant barrage of disinformation. Just lies. Let's take the Atlantic Magazine
[1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:08.240]  article, for example. First of all, the author of this article, Jeff Goldberg, has a long and
[1:50:08.240 --> 1:50:13.200]  colorful history of being completely dishonest and fabricating his report.
[1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:16.960]  He's known as the King Daddy of the Iraq War that killed millions.
[1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:24.800]  Secondarily, having read the Atlantic Magazine coverage of my own trial, it was rife with
[1:50:24.800 --> 1:50:34.880]  inaccuracies, outroute lies. And when they reproduced actual screenshots of certain text messages,
[1:50:34.880 --> 1:50:41.440]  they edited them. So they weren't even authentic. They edited them to fit the false narrative of
[1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:46.480]  their story. Oh, it's absolutely outrageous. So what happens when the Democrats lose? And I
[1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:50.320]  believe they're going to lose because of our prayer and action. What do they do next? Because I
[1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:56.320]  used to ask Gavin McInnis what peak craziness is, Roger. I don't think there is any peak craziness,
[1:50:57.200 --> 1:50:59.920]  peak craziness. Obviously, they get crazier and crazier forever.
[1:51:00.880 --> 1:51:05.840]  Well, I think they will step up these violent assaults in our cities, which, and they've already
[1:51:05.840 --> 1:51:13.200]  announced their intention to move to the suburbs where our voters live. Secondarily, you will have
[1:51:13.200 --> 1:51:19.760]  the same new investigations. It depends, of course, who wins either House of Congress.
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:24.160]  If the Democrats retain the House, you'll have yet another impeachment.
[1:51:24.160 --> 1:51:29.200]  That was my next question. Well, if the Democrats win this by fraud, Katie Barthador.
[1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:36.160]  Now, if the Democrats win this by fraud, then there will be an attempt to prosecute people like
[1:51:36.160 --> 1:51:43.600]  myself, like you, many others who have committed no crimes other than opposing them. Media Matters
[1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:51.440]  for America keeps criticizing you and I from using a quote in which Kamala Harris actually openly says
[1:51:51.440 --> 1:51:56.640]  there will be revenge against those who supported Trump and enabled his presidency.
[1:51:56.640 --> 1:52:01.600]  We will leave no stone unturned, she said. Who could she be talking about?
[1:52:02.240 --> 1:52:08.880]  So this is a fight not just for the future of the United States. This is a fight for the future
[1:52:08.880 --> 1:52:15.440]  of Western civilization. This is an epic struggle between dark and light, between good and evil,
[1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:21.280]  between the godly and the godless. Being in politics, every couple of years, we say,
[1:52:21.280 --> 1:52:27.280]  this is the most important election of our lifetimes. But this time, it really is. And the
[1:52:27.280 --> 1:52:34.320]  president must be reelected to stop this country from hurtling over the cliff to atheistic, godless
[1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:39.120]  globalism, mastered by the socialists. Well, that's right. In closing, Roger, I appreciate
[1:52:39.120 --> 1:52:41.840]  your time tonight while you're there in Las Vegas in our arena that was last night.
[1:52:44.560 --> 1:52:47.920]  Obviously, we're wargaming. They don't want us wargaming. When they say they're going to try
[1:52:47.920 --> 1:52:51.600]  to steal the election, they're trying to get the military to have a coup, they're openly saying
[1:52:51.600 --> 1:52:55.840]  it all over, then you go, well, Trump better counter their martial law with martial law.
[1:52:55.840 --> 1:53:00.480]  That's a normal response. They take us there and the threat continuum. That's default
[1:53:00.480 --> 1:53:04.480]  constitution where we don't want that. We're going to win fair and square. Clearly,
[1:53:04.480 --> 1:53:08.240]  they don't want you advising the president to spend two minutes on what you think the president
[1:53:08.240 --> 1:53:13.120]  should do or how we should wargame. What he does when they purposely say the election
[1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:18.080]  is contested when it's, he's clearly won. Well, first of all, let's talk pre-election. You will
[1:53:18.080 --> 1:53:24.560]  recall that I was deeply involved in an effort called Stop the Steel that was focused on the
[1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:30.720]  Republican National Convention because I was confident that the Ted Cruz forces, when they
[1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:36.000]  aligned with the Bush forces and the. And you were right. And they tried and you stopped them.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:42.160]  And we stopped them. Now I think what the Republican National Committee, which is basically
[1:53:42.160 --> 1:53:50.480]  useless, should be doing is putting together a volunteer brigade of attorneys in every state
[1:53:51.040 --> 1:53:56.880]  who are well versed in election law, who are very familiar with the state system,
[1:53:56.880 --> 1:54:02.640]  who are prepared to assert their rights on behalf of the Republican nominees,
[1:54:02.640 --> 1:54:09.440]  to inspect ballots, to inspect the process and to file objections and, if necessary, lawsuits.
[1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:17.200]  There are already 600 lawyers signed up for Biden to do this. Most of them veterans of the Obama
[1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:22.240]  Justice Department. Now, Hillary has said it is their policy to contest because they know they're
[1:54:22.240 --> 1:54:29.120]  going to lose. Well, Hillary said, Hillary said under no circumstances should Joe Biden ever concede
[1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:35.600]  even if he loses. But she hasn't gotten the kind of criticism today that I got by simply saying
[1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:41.520]  the president should exercise his legal rights in his authority as president.
[1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:46.720]  If there is overwhelming evidence that this election has been stolen through voter fraud.
[1:54:46.720 --> 1:54:52.800]  Sorry, folks, there's nothing wrong with that. Never mind the Guardian or CNN or the or the
[1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:58.080]  Terps. They're just mad that we get it. But obviously, more and more, the White House gets this.
[1:54:58.720 --> 1:55:02.320]  And Hillary's like, oh, they got a bunch of lawyers. No, the Republicans don't have any
[1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:06.480]  lawyers right now. They need to be on the ground. How does how does the RNC do that? Because you're
[1:55:06.480 --> 1:55:11.200]  right, the RNC just doesn't want MSNBC to talk bad about them. They are the weakest, most pathetic
[1:55:11.200 --> 1:55:18.560]  Republicans there are. We are completely unprepared for an election challenge. Say what you want about
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:26.480]  James A. Baker III. The Republicans so completely outmaneuvered and outorganized the Democrats
[1:55:26.480 --> 1:55:33.280]  in 2000. But we are completely unprepared for what is about to happen. And time is short.
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:39.280]  So I am hopeful that some of the more prominent Republicans in the country who do understand
[1:55:39.280 --> 1:55:44.960]  the problem, I should say, Republican lawyers in the country will put together a completely
[1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:52.000]  volunteer operation. This is very important now. It's not to intimidate voters. That's not what
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:58.720]  we're proposing. But to examine the process and the ballots and the legality of what happens
[1:55:58.720 --> 1:56:02.720]  both before the election and on election day. Well, absolutely. The Democrats say they're
[1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:05.840]  going to challenge it because they know they're losing. They they're pumping 80 million pretty
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:11.040]  much fake ballots in to confuse it. Dead cats are getting getting ballots. And that's normal.
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:18.240]  That's good. And we should call for integrity. But Zuckerberg and Bloomberg are spending together
[1:56:18.240 --> 1:56:23.760]  300. No, no, excuse me. I'm sorry, 600 million now, 200 million, one 400 million, another
[1:56:24.480 --> 1:56:29.040]  to go out and fund saying the election is illegitimate when Trump wins. I mean,
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:33.920]  this is outrageous. You talk about election meddling. This is one of the things that they
[1:56:33.920 --> 1:56:41.200]  object to. I said, if there is actual proof that Zuckerberg has acted has been involved in electoral
[1:56:41.200 --> 1:56:46.400]  fraud, then he should be arrested and prosecuted. Yes, I did say that. Guess what? I'm right.
[1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:52.880]  But they leave out the if part. Stone says Zuckerberg should be arrested by as if I'm proposing
[1:56:52.880 --> 1:56:59.360]  preventive detention, which I very specifically said I was opposed to. So it is it's the constant
[1:56:59.360 --> 1:57:04.480]  distortion. Sasha Barrett Cohen said if he doesn't hand the election to the UN will arrest him. So
[1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:08.560]  we're already in that wheelhouse. Roger Stone, powerful hour long interview. Stone cold truth
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:12.320]  dot com. Thank you so much. We'll talk to you again soon, my friend. Great to be here. Many
[1:57:12.320 --> 1:57:16.960]  thanks, Alex. Thank you. Wow. Powerful interview. All right. Shows over 30 seconds. Ownswear comes
[1:57:16.960 --> 1:57:22.320]  in here. There's two hours, six minutes, an hour of commercials for local stations. That said,
[1:57:22.320 --> 1:57:26.560]  please tell folks about Sunday Live. I was right. That's how we reach new people. You're awake.
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:30.160]  You're informed. You know all this. Send it to your mom, your brother, your cousin,
[1:57:30.160 --> 1:57:33.680]  your whole email list, your whole Twitter feed, your whole YouTube, your whole Google,
[1:57:33.680 --> 1:57:38.240]  your whole Facebook, call people, text message it, just get people to tune in. They don't want
[1:57:38.240 --> 1:57:42.160]  this show on air because we're so effective. And we tell the truth. God bless you all. I'm Alex
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:58:12.000]  Stone signing off. Great job. The crew. I'll see you back live. Love it. I am tomorrow.
