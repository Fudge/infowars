[01:16.080 --> 01:22.760]  job at covering the news and going over these topics but I I'm not doing good enough job
[01:22.760 --> 01:33.040]  really expressing to you how genuinely convinced I am and frankly assured of the fact that
[01:33.040 --> 01:38.520]  we are going into the most revolutionary period of change this country and this world has
[01:38.520 --> 01:49.240]  ever seen on every front a revolution of liberty a revolution of tyranny a revolution in dehumanization
[01:49.240 --> 01:58.160]  a revolution in human empowerment everything is in flux everything is mutating and changing
[01:58.160 --> 02:03.960]  for good and bad now is the great quickening the great change we are now just beginning
[02:03.960 --> 02:10.960]  the great slide or great rise depending on how you look at it we are now entering the
[02:10.960 --> 02:21.160]  vortex and it is so exciting I can hardly catch my breath sometimes but it's not even
[02:21.160 --> 02:26.400]  an anxiety it is more just of a have you ever been driving on the highway or driving through
[02:26.400 --> 02:30.740]  the mountains or driving to the desert and you see a sunset or you see a cloud formation
[02:30.740 --> 02:37.000]  or the moon or just a vista or something that takes your breath away that makes you
[02:37.000 --> 02:47.240]  kind of take a deep breath in that touches your soul have you ever seen a woman so beautiful
[02:47.240 --> 02:53.360]  but it's not her physical look I mean that normally accompanies it but her eyes the sparkle
[02:53.360 --> 03:06.800]  the window into the soul the grace that makes your heart beat fast for a second just the
[03:06.800 --> 03:25.800]  love of the beauty and the intellect and the soul admiring God's handiwork admiring the
[03:25.800 --> 03:35.280]  biomechanical machine I just feel like I should have 10 minutes of silence just to I mean

[03:54.480 --> 03:59.520]  the hype they're now beginning to beat the drum they're now trying to create the fear

[08:47.280 --> 08:53.040]  bottom of the hour and then get into more depth on what's happening in the economy the police state
[08:53.040 --> 08:57.520]  socialized health care i mean i've read the bill it's the total takeover of all health care it's
[08:57.520 --> 09:03.040]  not even socialized it's the hijacking of it just like with banking no oversight no liability
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.720]  for the government just just it's total tyranny every sector of the economy in life
[09:12.240 --> 09:15.120]  and i have a cd rom copy of it
[09:17.360 --> 09:23.520]  and we have physically printed out from universities the entire book you can find eco science written
[09:23.520 --> 09:28.640]  by john p holdren white house science are for free but the free versions of universities
[09:28.640 --> 09:35.040]  you have to print one page at a time try printing out over a thousand pages almost 1100 by hand we
[09:35.040 --> 09:39.760]  did that and we ordered five six copies from different places it was sold out everywhere
[09:39.760 --> 09:47.360]  but they take your order and then later tell you it was sold out but um tim fruget here in the office
[09:47.360 --> 09:53.920]  heard me lamenting last week i couldn't get it he bought it from a rare book dealer in england
[09:53.920 --> 09:58.480]  and guess what the actual textbook came in yesterday i have it in my hands
[10:01.680 --> 10:02.960]  and this ladies and gentlemen
[10:06.800 --> 10:14.000]  is the complete and total blueprint for the world we live in and under today
[10:14.000 --> 10:22.880]  day and there are many battle plans there are many white papers there are many sub plans
[10:22.880 --> 10:32.320]  and there are many master plans but this is a overall technical manual written in 76
[10:33.360 --> 10:38.640]  clearly adopted from all of my deep research of eugenics and the architecture of the new
[10:38.640 --> 10:44.880]  world order the architecture of the planetary system the planetary regime i've now read
[10:46.160 --> 10:51.120]  oh let's not exaggerate i've scanned through probably 600 pages of it online probably actually
[10:51.120 --> 10:58.320]  read 300 because each page i slowly read night after night day after day till it distracts from
[10:58.320 --> 11:03.040]  trying to finish the film distracts from the book i'm writing distracts from office managing and
[11:03.040 --> 11:07.360]  everything else i've got to do i mean i'm here really making excuses i probably should have
[11:07.360 --> 11:13.520]  dropped everything and just even dropped making this obama film and just started making a film on
[11:13.520 --> 11:19.840]  this but i also have to continue task a lot of people you know jump from issue to issue it is
[11:19.840 --> 11:31.760]  good that i always finish task i start but i will tell you that you know my wife wants me to
[11:31.760 --> 11:41.120]  to take the kids out to a state park or something saturday and uh there's nothing i enjoy more
[11:41.120 --> 11:46.640]  and i just told her i can't do it i've got to read eco science that way they can be running
[11:46.640 --> 11:50.640]  around playing in front of me and i could talk to them and stuff but i can be peering over it making
[11:50.640 --> 11:57.440]  notes people say well you ought to just spend time with your family my family has no future and your
[11:57.440 --> 12:03.440]  family has no future if we don't stop this what is it people don't understand we have hundreds of
[12:03.440 --> 12:09.360]  government textbooks and official u n law and official united states government policy state
[12:09.360 --> 12:14.720]  of her memorandum 200 and others royal commission on population official british empire policy
[12:15.280 --> 12:21.120]  we have all these and we have the club of rome documents in the books written by prince philip
[12:21.120 --> 12:28.640]  and and ted turner and the bill in the gates minutes and we have it all but when you know
[12:28.640 --> 12:37.120]  they're poisoning the water and food and they admit they are i mean i had rolling stone
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.160]  new york times i don't know i mean there was a huge bio of all these scores of major
[12:46.160 --> 12:52.080]  newspapers magazines cnn producers correspondents you know two filmmakers on your state that made
[12:52.080 --> 12:59.920]  anthrax war and there they were saying yes our film race specific bio weapons planned to be put
[12:59.920 --> 13:06.160]  in the vaccines to sterilize everyone i mean it just everybody's waking up to this doesn't matter
[13:06.160 --> 13:14.000]  what issue i cover it's there i'm actually digging around for their bios so i don't misquote all the
[13:14.000 --> 13:22.320]  places they wrote for and worked with the point is is that this is real jack and we've got these
[13:22.320 --> 13:28.480]  people in full control right now getting ready to try to forcibly inject 195 million americans
[13:28.480 --> 13:32.560]  they they admit they have the shots for that many people and are getting ready to force it
[13:32.560 --> 13:37.760]  and in one week it's one four shot the next month it's three four shots now it's four flu shots you
[13:37.760 --> 13:44.240]  got to take and all the hundreds of pieces of data i put into the analysis i'm telling you
[13:44.240 --> 13:50.480]  they're soft kill in there guaranteed bare minimum sterilization i mean they're giving people
[13:50.480 --> 13:55.360]  Gardasil killing people dead in a hammer dead in a hammer all around me this is this is insane
[13:55.360 --> 14:00.960]  here are their bios bob cohen filmmaker journalist correspondent producer was seeing an international
[14:00.960 --> 14:09.200]  received top awards i'm going to go over all those the other fellow written for rolling stone
[14:09.200 --> 14:15.440]  mother jones harpers on on on top tv front line award-winning films for pbs on bcc i
[14:16.080 --> 14:21.920]  and what are they making films on race specific bio weapons in the vaccines interviewing top
[14:21.920 --> 14:28.080]  bio weapons scientists saying yeah we're we're engineering that and dick cheney writes public
[14:28.080 --> 14:33.520]  white papers rebuilding america's defense of september 20 of 2000 published calling for it i
[14:33.520 --> 14:41.600]  mean you know i'm sorry folks uh nothing else matters once you realize that eco science was
[14:41.600 --> 14:46.960]  adopted because eco science drew from all their other research papers and documents and plans and
[14:46.960 --> 14:56.080]  there are what is it over a hundred pages bibliography in the back and it sources many other
[14:56.080 --> 15:03.360]  eugenics manuals but erin dykes probably ordered 25 30 of there's three giant stacks of films and
[15:03.360 --> 15:08.320]  books in there all written by these people you just randomly open the page and it's how to sterilize
[15:08.320 --> 15:13.360]  the women how to drug the water how to kim trellis i mean it's just i mean it's just absolute
[15:13.360 --> 15:21.120]  confession signed sealed and delivered and we have to change the subject off of the
[15:21.120 --> 15:31.280]  the cambridge gate black professor diversion and that stupid photo op with the beer and the table
[15:31.280 --> 15:37.200]  yesterday i mean you know something you know that well what can the idiot morons in america
[15:37.200 --> 15:42.800]  understand how can we diffuse this this situation we want to have racial division and in fighting
[15:42.800 --> 15:47.280]  but not connected to the president he wants to act like he's above it have him sit around a table
[15:47.280 --> 15:52.880]  with a beer and then not release any of what was said and let the camera sit back at a hundred yards
[15:52.880 --> 15:57.440]  give that to the slaves the stupid slaves can understand sitting around a table drinking beer
[15:58.240 --> 16:02.800]  and and don't have the two black guys on one side the two white guys on the other juxtapose them
[16:03.440 --> 16:08.800]  you know triangulate them i mean just all and then have a white guy serving them the image of the
[16:08.800 --> 16:14.240]  white butler i mean a psy a psych warfare person wrote that up everything's written up by these
[16:14.240 --> 16:21.120]  bastards they talk about an eco science i just randomly opened this up and it was how to sterilize
[16:21.120 --> 16:25.520]  the women quick procedures to grab them off the street and do it to them i could do in the third
[16:25.520 --> 16:34.960]  world i mean ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen i i'm to the point where i think
[16:36.080 --> 16:42.640]  if i went off the air for a few months and just had a notice on the website saying eco science
[16:42.640 --> 16:46.800]  read it that that would probably create a big enough stir to get tens of millions of people
[16:46.800 --> 16:53.040]  to wonder where alex jones went because familiarity breeds contempt and almost being here every day
[16:53.040 --> 16:58.080]  screaming and yelling and freaking out over this it's getting the attention out this you know this
[16:58.080 --> 17:04.800]  is a big issue it's getting attention on this subject but not enough attention i mean this is
[17:04.800 --> 17:09.040]  real folks you're a cop driving down the road they're getting ready for martial law they admit it
[17:09.040 --> 17:13.040]  seeing in fox yesterday say the troops are getting ready for the fourth inoculations
[17:15.280 --> 17:20.000]  do you do you understand police that you're with us i know they've brainwashed you to think it's
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.600]  you know that you're in power and you're in control and you're doing this for own good and
[17:23.600 --> 17:27.920]  we're a bunch of idiots and i mean do you understand that the government really is evil and
[17:28.640 --> 17:32.960]  really is out of control and that we're really need to start identifying with each other and
[17:32.960 --> 17:39.760]  working together and not playing these games i mean how do they send cops to meetings i go to
[17:39.760 --> 17:45.200]  and do events or i can be somewhere in dc or new york filming something and a guy walks over and
[17:45.200 --> 17:51.200]  says hi alex you want to kill police with me and you look at them and it's the arctic typo
[17:51.200 --> 17:58.800]  six four two hundred and fifty found muscled 45 year old cop you know fbi guy and i'm like no you
[17:58.800 --> 18:03.760]  you guys know i don't want to kill cops you guys know i'm just trying to get the word out and they'll
[18:03.760 --> 18:08.240]  even have a sad look in their eye and and won't admit they're a cop would go hey just just checking
[18:08.240 --> 18:14.960]  just doing my job and i'm like get out of here leave me alone you idiot go drink some fluoride
[18:14.960 --> 18:21.120]  shoot your kids up you jackass you're trying to set up a good american warning you about these
[18:21.120 --> 18:35.680]  murderers you think it's cute what they're doing to us i mean i just can't believe this anymore
[18:36.800 --> 18:42.080]  i can't believe they get you to serve them and kill yourself hurt yourself destroy yourself
[18:42.080 --> 18:45.600]  i mean even if you're an evil psychopath serving them you know the globals are destroying freedom
[18:45.600 --> 18:49.680]  destroying our standard of living destroying our way of life you know things aren't going well
[18:49.680 --> 18:54.000]  you know the government's run by a pack of offshore criminals with a bunch of top psych
[18:54.000 --> 18:59.280]  warfare experts keeping the public suppressed you know north coms openly taken over america
[19:03.120 --> 19:06.400]  this is sad what's happening and you feel like you're on the winning team
[19:08.160 --> 19:11.360]  just like bush supporters didn't care how much evil he was engaged in because they felt like
[19:11.360 --> 19:15.680]  they were part of the winning team now obama supporters don't care if he's lied about everything
[19:15.680 --> 19:21.360]  and is a total criminal because you know they're on the winning team you're not on the team stupid
[19:22.400 --> 19:25.280]  you're like a jew marched into one of the
[19:26.960 --> 19:32.000]  pits not that they actually did this but hypothetically you've seen the famous film of them
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.120]  being marched in and being shot in the back of the head you'd be like one of those poor people
[19:37.120 --> 19:42.320]  being marched in there by the nazis sharing them thinking you were having a victory as you're being
[19:42.320 --> 19:51.760]  shot i mean it just makes no sense you're like a fly landing on a flypaper and sharing that you're
[19:51.760 --> 19:58.240]  defeating the flies you are in the pit you were on the flypaper comprende
[20:00.400 --> 20:04.960]  there's a guy named mz in santa cruz california who owns one of our affiliate radio stations
[20:04.960 --> 20:09.600]  he got laid off from a job he loved many years ago he was devastated but it taught him a lesson
[20:09.600 --> 20:14.320]  very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much
[20:14.320 --> 20:18.960]  he appreciates you every day there is no job security you are always in danger of losing

[24:32.480 --> 24:40.880]  read through some of the headlines i have cdc its chief soda tax can combat obesity
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.000]  when you actually read into it it's going to be on your national ID card everything you buy
[24:46.000 --> 24:54.240]  sell and do is going to do beyond your profile this is the new carbon tax economy the new socialized
[24:54.240 --> 25:00.240]  economy where once they socialize things they sell the public well the soda drinkers are costing you
[25:00.240 --> 25:06.720]  more money so let's tax them and so it creates an utz against them mentality and starts training
[25:06.720 --> 25:17.040]  people in a democracy that 51% of the sheep can vote to have the other 49% butchered but see in
[25:17.040 --> 25:23.760]  republic you can't do that so they're training the public to rob the middle class which is really
[25:23.760 --> 25:33.120]  robbing themselves with a class warfare they are setting the precedent to go loot the public
[25:33.120 --> 25:37.040]  but meanwhile most of the money actually goes to the elites so they tell the poor people hey let's
[25:37.040 --> 25:41.120]  raise taxes on the rich and the poor folks think somebody making 200 grand a year is rich
[25:45.200 --> 25:47.600]  see i said i just read headlines and there's no point
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.200]  it's just so incredibly corrupt they're taking over on every front how is this not obvious to
[25:55.200 --> 26:04.160]  everybody how am i called a radical first they get you trained to tax cigarettes because they're
[26:04.160 --> 26:08.640]  bad for you now it's going to be coca-cola and beef and everything that has a carbon footprint
[26:08.640 --> 26:16.560]  and they're they're now announcing in the new york times saying it's national security and carbon
[26:16.560 --> 26:23.440]  is a toxic waste i mean it's what plants breathe it's not bad it's good and i can't believe we have
[26:23.440 --> 26:34.240]  to argue with the public about this tough love for fat people tax their food to pay for health
[26:34.240 --> 26:38.720]  care los angeles times the feds have been proposing that for more than 10 years and they're going to
[26:38.720 --> 26:44.960]  do it just like satellite tracker boxes in your cars and there's all these controlled
[26:44.960 --> 26:50.160]  foundation funded fake liberal news services attacking me every day there's two new ones today
[26:50.160 --> 26:58.960]  saying i'm a crazy racist because i believe that the holdren textbook is evil you understand if
[26:58.960 --> 27:03.360]  you're against killing the majority of the humans on the planet you're now a racist and and and with
[27:03.360 --> 27:07.920]  liberals it's like a religion to say racist it doesn't even matter if it makes sense or not
[27:09.120 --> 27:16.480]  the public that's under this is insane it's like neocon still believing wmds were found in iraq
[27:16.480 --> 27:26.160]  these people are nuts again it's so crazy that hillary is now saying that yes she might run for
[27:26.160 --> 27:32.960]  president in 2012 man that is so crazy that's in new york daily news and a bunch of other places
[27:34.880 --> 27:41.040]  the good news is they're saying health care is dead until after the recess and with every passing
[27:41.040 --> 27:46.880]  month their program stalls but more and more i realize the whole swine flu fear mongering
[27:46.880 --> 27:51.200]  is going to be about c the health care costs for the federal government we need national
[27:51.200 --> 27:56.560]  health care because of this crisis people couldn't afford the millions of people that
[27:56.560 --> 28:03.120]  panicked and one of the hospitals wanting their shots and oh let's not worry about the banking
[28:03.120 --> 28:09.200]  holiday that we had during the swine flu at least we're all still alive let's just hope
[28:09.200 --> 28:12.640]  they're doing it for that let's hope they're not really going to release some deadly pathogen
[28:14.320 --> 28:16.720]  let me tell you folks i'm analyzing it and it doesn't look good
[28:18.880 --> 28:24.800]  north carolina terror arrest time to coincide with in leo nine the fed swooped down an alleged

[44:58.240 --> 45:04.000]  well look the senate blocked it that's even better now everybody's wondering why we can't audit it
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.000]  bernack he's stuttering and bumbling on tv again look how positive that is we're having so many
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.400]  victories now that's great and i think about the vaccinations there's another thing that's coming
[45:14.400 --> 45:18.320]  to my mind for vaccination you mentioned the kentucky derby and loval where i live that possibly
[45:18.320 --> 45:22.400]  could happen you can't get in the kentucky derby until you roll up your sleeves what virus are
[45:22.400 --> 45:25.760]  they going to create next from a horse what are they going to create they're going to find some

[45:47.760 --> 45:54.000]  maiming people all over the news and nothing happens so i mean see they're they're slowly
[45:54.000 --> 46:03.520]  turning the heat up and doing all of this in plain view i mean this is insane crazy control freaks
[46:03.520 --> 46:08.560]  are running things chris what are we going to do yeah well that's it just gotta keep being

[46:51.520 --> 46:57.120]  else i like to joke around i do this four hours a day and sometimes i screw around and make jokes
[46:57.120 --> 47:02.480]  and you know try to make it lively and i know people like that some people do but this stuff's
[47:02.480 --> 47:09.600]  so heavy and serious maybe i shouldn't even ever joke around again and i'm just trying to think
[47:09.600 --> 47:19.760]  of ways ways to really i'm trying to think of ways to really impress on people this is not my
[47:19.760 --> 47:24.640]  opinion this stuff is real brian in quebec canada you're on the air
[47:30.880 --> 47:38.160]  okay we'll let him go mario in california mario welcome sir hey alex how you doing good sir i'm
[47:38.160 --> 47:42.880]  i'm really feeling what you're talking about man and i can understand and appreciate what you're
[47:42.880 --> 47:47.600]  going through you know trying to um you know figure out a way to really get all this
[47:47.600 --> 47:56.000]  as serious as possible so i definitely feel your situation um and try to try to stand
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.120]  line with what you're talking about you know i was at the bar last night and i was talking
[47:59.120 --> 48:04.080]  to this guy about this john holger and i told him you know this guy wants to um put a chip inside
[48:04.080 --> 48:09.760]  of your kids it's going to release a birth control and uh they're going to have to go to the uh you
[48:09.760 --> 48:15.280]  know basically go to the police or some government agency and have them take it out so that they
[48:15.280 --> 48:22.240]  could have kids and uh this guy told me that was a good idea and i'm looking at him no that's the
[48:22.240 --> 48:27.280]  brainwashing is that in college and in culture if you talk to the average person they don't even
[48:27.280 --> 48:32.240]  know why they believe that but from predictive programming the sitcoms the dramas the science
[48:32.240 --> 48:39.600]  fiction movies people expect that to be the future and there's lots of excuses and rationales why and
[48:39.600 --> 48:47.440]  look at this bad mother with eight kids but that's the beta test the case test to sell you on it
[48:47.440 --> 48:53.360]  they don't understand they're the target and that's all i was trying to uh you know i was asking him
[48:53.360 --> 49:00.480]  how he could not see that that is the overall you know game plan here and uh i think this kind of
[49:00.480 --> 49:06.080]  ties in the other day you were talking about you know people who eat meat and then um talk
[49:06.080 --> 49:11.520]  bad about people who hunt you know and and i kind of think that the same exact situation
[49:11.520 --> 49:15.920]  is like this guy who was told him who was telling me that the the world's overpopulated
[49:15.920 --> 49:23.040]  he has kids so i'm saying how do you believe this stuff and then have children you know because i
[49:23.040 --> 49:27.920]  i could i could i could appreciate somebody who really has uh you know believes that maybe there's
[49:27.920 --> 49:34.160]  too many people who have that idea i don't really believe how many kids does ted turner have five
[49:34.160 --> 49:40.080]  how many yachts more than 20 how many airplanes more than 14 last time i pulled it up how many
[49:40.080 --> 49:45.120]  homes more than it was some astronomical number i think it was i think it was over 20 he owned
[49:45.120 --> 49:49.440]  several million acres you can pull this up i mean in fact go to wikipedia a number of kids
[49:49.440 --> 49:52.720]  of course that i might even be accurate but i've seen mainstream news articles where i know he's
[49:52.720 --> 50:00.560]  got five kids just millions of acres homes everywhere he is just folks they wanted all for
[50:00.560 --> 50:07.360]  themselves and this person you were talking to has the elite spirit so he sees it from that
[50:07.360 --> 50:12.640]  position even though he's not an elite you understand that that's that's the craziness
[50:12.640 --> 50:18.640]  about it you know and i guess they've been able to infiltrate it people's minds um you know luckily
[50:18.640 --> 50:23.280]  they haven't infiltrated everybody's minds and you know that that's just one other thing i wanted
[50:23.280 --> 50:27.120]  to say man i hear you talking a lot especially that's a great point stay there i'm gonna come back
[50:27.120 --> 50:35.040]  to you infiltrating the minds hold that thought that's it i mean they're propagandizing they're
[50:35.040 --> 50:41.680]  lying they're doing all of this all i want listeners to do is to get other people around
[50:41.680 --> 50:47.040]  you to realize that that there's an agenda that the culture the media all of it is trying to

[54:40.160 --> 54:44.720]  species survival mechanism to be expropriated moved over to
[54:44.720 --> 54:54.400]  the rest of creation which is what the globalist have done you understand you're the one in the
[54:54.400 --> 55:00.000]  crosshairs you know dr. eric pionka's got a bunch of kids peter singer they've all got kids
[55:00.640 --> 55:06.160]  they all got big houses al gore's got some 9 000 square foot thing just one house that
[55:06.160 --> 55:12.240]  what the news say it uses seven times the regular energy of a house but then that's the way the
[55:12.240 --> 55:16.800]  media you know comes at it oh it's a carbon footprint his is too big then you're playing
[55:16.800 --> 55:23.600]  into their game it's good he's putting off carbon plants breathe it it's not bad it's just ridiculous
[55:23.600 --> 55:30.560]  but finish up your point there uh mario well uh yeah it is ridiculous it's a mind game and uh
[55:30.560 --> 55:36.080]  so about the resolution i just want to say man you know i think the best thing that we could do
[55:36.080 --> 55:40.320]  they say once you're woken up well what can we do just keep on doing what you've been doing
[55:40.320 --> 55:44.800]  you know saying if you're that grandma be that grandma but be the woken up grandma you know if
[55:44.800 --> 55:49.760]  you're the if you're the son be the son but be the woken up son because well that's what we were
[55:49.760 --> 55:56.000]  naturally supposed to be and you know i think we always try to like find some new thing because
[55:56.000 --> 56:00.400]  we think that this this whole system they've created and they're controlling this entire thing
[56:00.400 --> 56:05.760]  it's not true it's an illusion and you know we have the power to continue living our lives exactly
[56:05.760 --> 56:11.520]  how we want to live them but we just have to do it in a more conscious style but we don't have long
[56:11.520 --> 56:15.440]  because they're really starting to crack down they're removing the energy sources they're
[56:15.440 --> 56:21.120]  removing the energy the power they're removing the food they're removing they've got us in these
[56:21.120 --> 56:26.080]  compact grids they're they're shutting down the farms and ranches with the animal id premises id
[56:26.080 --> 56:30.960]  they're gonna artificially reduce the money supply next until you physically can't pay the debts back
[56:30.960 --> 56:39.600]  and and and we're in a crisis my friend we uh i mean i agree with you that we've got a lot of power
[56:40.160 --> 56:44.400]  and and and we've got the jump on the enemy because we're waking up faster than they thought
[56:44.400 --> 56:51.680]  but we had all better bust our butts i mean my intellect my soul my gut all your gut is is your
[56:51.680 --> 56:58.000]  entire brain power you know giving you a calculated answer and then it's so deep and and and and and
[56:58.000 --> 57:03.040]  multifaceted it's hard to even describe the total of the information but that's like a good old
[57:03.040 --> 57:08.960]  fashioned cop detective hunch it's it's you know it's it's the full integrated analysis and i'm
[57:08.960 --> 57:15.200]  telling you we are in the crosshairs we are in red level emergency we are engaging the enemy
[57:15.200 --> 57:22.160]  they are engaging us this is the clash this is the collision this is jump point and we better get in
[57:22.160 --> 57:26.880]  there and the equipment right now we better get in to the grid right now we better take over the
[57:26.880 --> 57:33.120]  matrix right now this is the most important time in all of human development this is it
[57:34.160 --> 57:37.440]  and i appreciate your call and and folks if you just tell your mind
[57:38.160 --> 57:41.680]  because all of you have incredible potential even if you've been brain damaged by the enemy
[57:41.680 --> 57:46.400]  being aware of the brain damage is half the battle and if you just tell your mind give
[57:46.400 --> 57:52.800]  me solutions boost my intelligence give me the answers uh and and and and tell me what to do

[1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:32.960]  hey buddy hey a lot of people call in asking for solutions and i heard that guy call in the other
[1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:41.280]  day and uh you know anyway i i think the big solution is not supporting wall street financially
[1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:48.240]  that's the big thing is learning to support each other i heard an interview the other night uh
[1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:52.880]  from somebody i think you've had her on the show before kathryn austin fits
[1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:57.760]  it she was talking a little bit about financial permaculture it sounds pretty good yeah i want
[1:02:57.760 --> 1:03:01.760]  to get her on the show we send her emails and stuff and maybe i've got a bad email link or
[1:03:01.760 --> 1:03:06.240]  something but i want to get her on well you know i'll send her an email too and and see
[1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:10.240]  she was talking about how when she was having trouble with uh i don't know exactly what the
[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:14.560]  legal troubles it was that she went through but uh you know she had millions of dollars
[1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:21.680]  gone through her her agency and she gave a lot of money to family members well uh all that money
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:26.480]  came back to her when uh when the legal troubles were coming in other words you know the government
[1:03:26.480 --> 1:03:31.680]  could you know they were they were trying to shut her down completely but it it never completely
[1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:37.840]  materialized because still money was coming back in i wish i could uh you know the most valuable
[1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:42.000]  thing in the world is land and knowing how to cultivate it and having neighbors and friends
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:47.120]  and family that love each other you know media always makes fun of the old timers you know the
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:51.680]  hill people going we don't hang out with outsiders and we don't trust salesmen and we don't trust
[1:03:51.680 --> 1:03:56.960]  the government but that was common sense and then now through the media and the culture look at all
[1:03:56.960 --> 1:04:02.800]  the sitcom messages are for the husband and wife to fight and the kids to fight and to all turn
[1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:08.800]  against each other and i i literally have more than 20 government textbooks and documents that
[1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:14.080]  we posted on the prison planet forum and covered where the government said 80 90 100 years ago
[1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:18.640]  in different documents 30 40 years ago they repeated they've got to destroy the family
[1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:24.720]  eco science says they're going to put all the kids in dormitories and uh raise them up forcibly
[1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:30.960]  and sterilize them i mean i mean they mean business folks first they've got to make us all dysfunctional
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:36.640]  criminals and scum then the people that aren't scum call for more police to protect them then
[1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:41.200]  those police are used against the good people and then you have a total takeover of society
[1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:47.840]  the this is a prison society you're that they're building and yes the solution starts at home
[1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:53.920]  and the solution starts with agriculture and the solution starts with occupying the land
[1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:57.680]  god bless you great points great caller we'll be right back

[1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:16.000]  before you know that that's the military i mean they have some serious concerns about what's
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:20.080]  going to happen in the fall with this flu because we'll have two flues at once obviously regular
[1:08:20.080 --> 1:08:26.160]  or every year flu and then this you know pig flu in case in case the government asks fema for help
[1:08:26.160 --> 1:08:29.840]  the government will be will be ready there with the with the military we're told it's
[1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:34.480]  as health officials race to get vaccines ready the u.s government it's just gotten 20 million
[1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:39.680]  doses and we're told it could be getting ready to start giving those shots by october even though
[1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:44.240]  the trials for these drugs hasn't even begun yet just minutes from now a panel from the centers for
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:49.120]  disease control and prevention in atlanta is expected to hold a news conference in atlanta
[1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:55.040]  and give its recommendation on how the new vaccine should be handed out we keep an eye on that news
[1:08:55.040 --> 1:08:58.400]  conference and we'll let you know exactly what happens and all the developments from it our brian
[1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:03.680]  wilson is covering this brian the military getting involved that seems kind of drastic
[1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:08.960]  well i think it is dramatic chef fox news has confirmed that north com has a proposal sitting
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:14.240]  on the nest of secretary defense robert gates that would authorize the military to back up fema
[1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:20.480]  should there be an h1n1 pandemic the proposal comes from north com commander victor renwar who
[1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:26.960]  wants permission to set up five regional military teams who will respond if fema says it needs help
[1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:32.160]  one assumes this might be necessary chef if there were for example mass quarantines mass
[1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:38.320]  quarantines mass quarantines uh well there's there's a hearings a day in the senate on preparing
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:44.960]  for h1n1 where are they with this thing well the h1n1 vaccine is not completely ready they do
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:49.360]  have some test doses they want to start testing won't be ready for a while but they do begin to
[1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:55.200]  spend a campaign in the fall and chef those who should be at the front of the line adults 19 to
[1:09:55.200 --> 1:10:00.880]  24 were beginning to hear because it seems that the h1n1 it's young people the hardest yeah i guess
[1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:05.200]  they saw that here in the united states but in were they seeing that in outbreaks in other parts of
[1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:09.600]  the world as well i mean we've learned a lot about this thing recently well the problem is it keeps
[1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:14.880]  changing and and that is the real issue here is that this one morphs and mutates and comes back in
[1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:20.080]  different ways so they have to be very careful but they think right now the people at greatest risk
[1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:26.320]  are young people 19 to 24 all right brian wilson on capitol hill and of course reminder we are
[1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:31.120]  tracking h1n1 can we play that animation again here we go
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:36.800]  be very afraid be very afraid be very afraid
[1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:45.280]  all right ladies and gentlemen we are live that's little youtube video somebody put together
[1:10:45.920 --> 1:10:52.400]  you know we should edit a video together just of all the cnn fox abc saying there's gonna be forced
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:59.520]  inoculations the army is going to make you take the injections but it's all for your own good
[1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:07.040]  and north com that was set up to fight al qaeda we promise it's not to fight the american people
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:14.080]  we promise we're only going to use the army against al qaeda and then oh north com you know
[1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:21.680]  you have south com and you have sent com and well now you have north com and african and all the
[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:28.320]  rest of it over the united states out of colorado springs colorado and they've announced they're
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:32.880]  going to put troops on the streets of america and they train with the police in these drills
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:40.320]  and the dhs reports saying gun owners conservatives and veterans are the main force that they are
[1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:46.480]  prepared for and the john warner defense authorization acts states north com's main mission is suppressing
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:52.800]  governors and rogue states you see the federal government was seized by offshore private banks
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:57.600]  according to bloomberg and the associated press and others congressional hearings the last week
[1:11:57.600 --> 1:12:05.120]  23.7 trillion and that number is a month old it always comes out a few months late so in nine
[1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:12.480]  months from the bailout point they had stolen 23.7 trillion it's now probably more than 25
[1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:21.520]  trillion that is double the gdp of the country roughly and uh 9.4 9.5 trillion would have paid
[1:12:21.520 --> 1:12:30.080]  off all mortgages in the united states all mortgages not bad mortgages not mortgages subprime
[1:12:30.080 --> 1:12:37.440]  not jumbo mortgages every condo every mansion every small bungalow every cottage every mortgage
[1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:51.440]  in america paid off for over nine trillion it's already 23.7 and that's not counting other month
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:59.120]  plus so and they won't say where the money is and they brag and they how do you think the
[1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:02.960]  imf and world bank when they take over a third world country run things they go in and pay off
[1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:08.320]  the politicians and the politicians set up a military system and they suppress the people
[1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:16.960]  and they come in and raise taxes and regulations and seize the roads the ports the infrastructure
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:21.360]  and hand it over to foreign countries and they turn the major regular highways freeways and
[1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:25.680]  atoll roads and they triple the water price and they set up all these systems and now they're
[1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:30.240]  going to have a global government according to time news week everybody else but they say it's
[1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:37.040]  good that will tax everybody and if you don't like it north com is standing by
[1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:45.360]  and then they can also run around and fear monger
[1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:56.400]  using the swine flu and that is clearly just another drill another exercise we don't know
[1:13:56.400 --> 1:14:01.600]  how extreme it's going to be in federalization and the united states not just being federalized
[1:14:01.600 --> 1:14:07.600]  but under world health organization mainstream u n announcements that they are directing the
[1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:12.080]  united states and the rest of the world this is a this is a perfect pretext for the state
[1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:18.560]  worldwide controlled by big offshore banks to crack down and control and enslave their
[1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:24.800]  populations that's what's happening period and they use the patriot act thousands of times per
[1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:29.520]  year per state and non terror related they're getting rid of the whole bill of rights whole
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:35.680]  constitution they have warrantless wiretapping in non terror related cases now the cyber security
[1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:41.840]  command of the nsa and the air force admit they're spying on the web engaging in propaganda on the
[1:14:41.840 --> 1:14:55.040]  web engaging in manipulation they are doing all of this right now everywhere and it's just
[1:14:55.040 --> 1:14:59.280]  unspeakable how is obama going to get his carbon tax through in the fall how's he going to get his
[1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:06.640]  socialized health care and through in the fall how's he going to get quote amnesty uh immigration
[1:15:06.640 --> 1:15:11.200]  reform through in the fall how's he going to get his anti gun bills that are all introduced through
[1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:17.040]  how is he going to get his clean water restoration act that federalizes all above and below water
[1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:21.600]  in the country the entire nation has water underground total federalization no judge no
[1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:30.000]  jury they just take over how are they going to successfully do that how are they going to be able
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:37.040]  to do that how is this going to be done well i'll tell you how this is going to be done
[1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:45.920]  this is going to be done through fear mongering through through brinksmanship and maybe even
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:52.080]  war with iran and pakistan this has a distraction and a diversion maybe nato run another sneak
[1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:57.280]  attack on a rushing control territory on its border like south ozetti and george on 888 last year
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:06.560]  coming up on the anniversary of that in about eight days wow time flies
[1:16:09.680 --> 1:16:16.720]  and the the swine flu clearly i mean we know it's killed less than 200 people in the united
[1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:20.560]  states and that's even puffed up numbers we know it's killed less than 2000 world wide
[1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:24.720]  we know the regular flu kills half a million every year 37 000 in the united states
[1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:32.480]  why are they fear mongering why are they freaking out so bad why are they going crazy
[1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:41.040]  why is this happening why are they already pushing and getting the public ready for forced
[1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:45.200]  inoculation why are they announcing troops are going to be on the streets because ladies and
[1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:50.320]  gentlemen unemployment is above 21 percent now and that's even with their cook numbers
[1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:56.800]  things are rapidly deteriorating fastly by design they're imploding the economy to consolidate
[1:16:56.800 --> 1:17:03.600]  just like they did third world countries over and over again this is very very serious and this
[1:17:03.600 --> 1:17:11.280]  is happening now and so i'm begging all of you the listeners to get informed and to get involved
[1:17:11.280 --> 1:17:21.840]  in your communities and to warn everybody around you remember that before the staged flu
[1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:27.680]  outbreak in fear mongering in mexico in april i went on air in march 5th and on other transmissions
[1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:34.000]  and said specifically i believe they were going to stage a flu pandemic or fear mongering to do
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:41.920]  with flu the anthrax attacks run by the feds showed us that it only needs to kill a few people
[1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:50.320]  it's the fear of it the stampeding you know how did ancient aboriginals how did ancient human
[1:17:50.320 --> 1:17:59.200]  tribes kill woolly mammoths for food that was obviously the prey of choice because uh you know
[1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:05.440]  you know it had hundreds of times the meat that a deer would per kill humans didn't usually go up
[1:18:05.440 --> 1:18:14.080]  against a woolly mammoth or mastodon just with spears and swords and and rocks spears and clubs
[1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:22.400]  and rocks and have swords obviously they would go up against them by having beaters in the woods
[1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:29.520]  or in a field spread out beating drums and they would drive the mammoth you might have a person
[1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:35.520]  spread out every 500 yards at first beating their drums beating their drums spread out over a couple
[1:18:35.520 --> 1:18:43.840]  miles driving first in a straight line then closing in this is how sharks and dolphins hunt fish
[1:18:43.840 --> 1:18:52.560]  thrasher sharks go in circles around fish get them all into one mass and eat them and they
[1:18:52.560 --> 1:18:58.800]  they start in a straight line and start curving in hurting the mastodons towards cliffs towards
[1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:08.160]  ambushes and they could get the the mastodons or the woolly mammoths depending on which subspecies
[1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:14.400]  of the pachyderm you're talking about the elephants at first they would be that scared they hear a
[1:19:14.400 --> 1:19:18.880]  drum beating and kind of move on and then but the more they got chased this might go on for you
[1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:25.680]  know a half a day and now people dressed up you know in wild paint screaming because once they'd
[1:19:25.680 --> 1:19:29.360]  intimidated the elephants to run the elephants could have could have stood their ground turned
[1:19:29.360 --> 1:19:34.400]  and fought like humans could against the sign of dictatorship now being run by our own species
[1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:41.440]  against us but the elites say we're a subspecies but the humans were acting tough screaming and
[1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:47.040]  yelling beating drums and then the mastodons suddenly would just with with foam coming out
[1:19:47.040 --> 1:19:52.480]  of their mouths would run over the cliffs and die by the hundreds and that's why you see mastodon
[1:19:52.480 --> 1:19:58.480]  that were all over the americas and all over europe extinct humans killed them all they're using
[1:19:58.480 --> 1:20:03.600]  the same tactics on us if you'd like to quit smoking regular cigarettes and try a revolutionary

[1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:26.160]  about mastodon about several species of extinct elephant
[1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:34.320]  well because this is exactly what the globalists do to us this is how they hunt us
[1:24:34.320 --> 1:24:39.040]  and there's a lot of forms of hunting birds hunting pheasant where you have beaters in
[1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:44.960]  the bush that come out in a straight line then they start forming a wedge a pincer and they push
[1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:50.960]  the birds out and then finally start closing in and push them all out in one group and then the
[1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:55.760]  nobles the queen of england in fact you can probably pull up video youtube queen of england
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:25:01.520]  hunting pheasant you'll see her standing in a field with woods and hundreds of pheasants will
[1:25:01.520 --> 1:25:08.640]  suddenly just fly out that was people beating the woods on her estate for hours marching the birds
[1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:15.680]  driving them out so she can shoot them and then i like hunting myself don't but talk about weird
[1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:20.240]  she like enjoys ringing their necks and gets weird looks on her faces so it's a little bit strange
[1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:26.720]  when she does it i've seen video of that i'm sure it's on the web but the point is they just release
[1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:32.800]  a little anthrax kills of 1015 people i forget the exact number injures a few hundred seconds a few
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:40.080]  hundred and uh same thing here i mean they have a couple deaths in mexico in the us a couple deaths
[1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:46.880]  in china they act like it's the end of the world because the media said so now i had seen the feds
[1:25:47.760 --> 1:25:53.120]  preparing mass graves gave you secret new york state documents indiana documents indiana
[1:25:53.120 --> 1:25:59.600]  emergency manager witnesses had them on the show uh and then later all that came out news oh yes we
[1:25:59.600 --> 1:26:04.080]  are getting mass graves ready we are getting troops ready we are getting the army ready we
[1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:09.920]  are having drills of local police practicing bringing fake vaccine in that militias are trying
[1:26:09.920 --> 1:26:15.680]  to steal i knew that before april they're now telling people they just started all this preparation
[1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:21.600]  in april because this is such a big takeover they're using the flu scare as a as a smoke screen for
[1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:29.200]  that they really started more than a year ago we found out about it in january february in march
[1:26:29.200 --> 1:26:35.120]  i did show after show warning you this was coming and then april hit and i just went on there and
[1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:41.040]  said this is big whether it's a hoax or not there this is a cover story for something big this is
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:44.960]  probably going to turn to something big in the fall exactly what i said happened there and then
[1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:50.480]  listeners i'm so busy always looking forward they emailed me and said here's the youtube of you on
[1:26:50.480 --> 1:26:56.240]  your tv show and the radio saying all this would happen in march and laying it all out how did you
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:02.160]  know and i mean i wasn't even tooting my horn that i had exactly laid everything out and that's why
[1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:08.000]  i was freaking out in in in april going this is big this is big it's happening because i'd already
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:15.760]  said it was coming and knew it was happening it's just incredible so i'm like one of these elephants
[1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:21.280]  who's got a little bit of smarts and i'm going wait a minute there's only one of those crow
[1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:28.640]  magnine every 500 yards or so there's hundreds of us elephants they're all painted up you know
[1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:32.960]  they got you know they're wearing antlers and stuff to scare us they're yelling they're screaming
[1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:38.000]  they're you know they hunt lions today in africa like this they beat the bush drive the lion to
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:43.920]  where they got hunters waiting with these 15 foot long spears and the men it's key i've seen them
[1:27:43.920 --> 1:27:48.560]  interviewed uh the zulus and others are big lion hunters you pull that up pull up lion hunting
[1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:53.280]  zulu lion hunting i bet you can find that on youtube and they got these long you know 15 almost 20
[1:27:53.280 --> 1:27:58.720]  foot spear there's a huge long spears and the men explain it's key that they be more aggressive that
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:05.920]  they not be afraid to because that lion's gotta know i'm tough i'm gonna get you and they cornering
[1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:11.200]  then they stab them to death okay well that's what all of our ancestors did that's why we
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:16.960]  extincted cave lions that's why we extincted the big mega cave bear humans hunted them out
[1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:23.280]  in northern europe and the americas um humans hunted out all the elephants because humans
[1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:30.880]  would get in that craze mode and and and but but actually minute you understand and you know instead
[1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:35.840]  of being in the nfl our top champion warriors were taken on you know a cave bears you understand
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:43.120]  that folks and so but but again it's about who's got the momentum and so the elephants would see
[1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:46.560]  these people that weren't scared now if you'd have walked out in front of the elephants and not
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:51.920]  acted aggressive and mean they would have come over and run over and tried to stop on you knowing
[1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:57.360]  you were something dangerous and they do that just like a dog a dog runs up on you and growls
[1:28:57.360 --> 1:29:00.960]  even if it's one of the most vicious attack dogs if you start going at it it will go into
[1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:06.720]  defense mode but no the movies and culture tell you to run from a dog you know these movies never
[1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:11.920]  show a woman with a gun in her house when the killer comes again it's all programming and
[1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:17.040]  they admit this we have government documents we've we've covered them so instead you know
[1:29:17.040 --> 1:29:22.320]  there's a group of a hundred macedons or more in these big troops uh you know these big herds
[1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:28.160]  and they see they see these people painted up with weird paint on and they and they start
[1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:32.400]  going oh i don't like that you know and then again the humans start chasing them for hours
[1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:38.720]  closing it in driving them over the cliff that's the SWAT teams north com the military are just a
[1:29:38.720 --> 1:29:45.840]  few people scaring us the big strong mass of humans see the elites say that they are engaging in
[1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:50.080]  predator activity against the general public they say in the natural order that's their job

[2:08:41.360 --> 2:08:57.360]  and this time there's no gag order on it and it deals with the case of that moron on info wars dot com of course he and others said the stuff a bunch of other places they don't care about that
[2:08:57.360 --> 2:09:10.560]  so where i have to go to trial in virginia to testify which is just absolute crap that's it we have to go to a registration system on the
[2:09:10.560 --> 2:09:26.560]  on the comments on info wars in prison planet because it just goes on and on and and and i knew it when it was happening that the first fbi agent fam this is last name i can go pull all the stuff
[2:09:26.560 --> 2:09:42.560]  that called him in there he knows fam's first name agent fam kept calling people randomly in the office asking questions about my business asking questions about me and i'm like what is it you don't need to understand fbi
[2:09:42.560 --> 2:10:00.560]  it's a comment we removed it a week later you call up with a subpoena fbi's well why did you remove it well because i'm not going to have cops home number and name on the web and where his family lives with some stupid
[2:10:00.560 --> 2:10:20.560]  pothead it turns out sitting in his mommy's basement like an idiot from his own computer with his own ip address threatening the policemen's life that shot the dark guy in the back
[2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:34.560]  and i knew it was either they wanted me as a witness with their snooping or they're trying to somehow tie me in with this because i had the fbi ask me you you don't agree with that do you
[2:10:34.560 --> 2:10:52.560]  and i went ahead and talked to him because there's no point in paying $5,000 to have some meeting with a lawyer you know thousands of dollars but this is the kind of crap that i deal with and the top of stuff that goes on you go to youtube right now and find hundreds of comments in the last hour naming police
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:11:06.560]  naming people saying go after him nothing happens i've talked to people at youtube they just ignore the subpoenas is such a big corporation and the fed just leave me alone this is just a way to harass me and i'm not saying that the
[2:11:06.560 --> 2:11:30.560]  Austin cop that was with the fbi that these guys are here to harass me and they were definitely playing the good cop hey we can get a beer sometime yeah i bet i told him he had investigated dinecore and halliburton with the child kidnapping rings in fact pull up if you google or do a youtube dinecore child kidnapping congressional hearing
[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:38.560]  and the congresswoman asked rumsfeld about it he says yeah well they got in the penalty box for doing that
[2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:59.560]  this is kidnapping children in mass to take them to Saudi Arabia Thailand Israel other places and it's like that's not my department but see there's all these fbi agents and people for some moron pothead who is an idiot
[2:11:59.560 --> 2:12:13.560]  but see see this the threats can be on my space the threats can be on youtube they can be everywhere it's my website info wars dot com prison planet dot com

[2:13:35.560 --> 2:13:45.560]  the few people that have been over here with guests and folks we're starting to show up in the parking lot ten minutes after i made the announcement that the fbi was here
[2:13:45.560 --> 2:13:57.560]  meanwhile i'm the big criminal that has to be dealt with i was telling these cops hey i got an eco science textbook about how they want to drug the water supply and sterilize the population and take everyone's
[2:13:57.560 --> 2:14:12.560]  children and at birth and ids to forcibly sterilize everybody i said you want to see that no no we don't see that no you don't want to know about that i said they're putting stuff in the water to
[2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:27.560]  the August pal and they said no we we have no doubt you're right about that well i mean why are we not on the same team because it's your job let me tell you something i was taught is tim here i just want fam's first name
[2:14:27.560 --> 2:14:48.560]  oh it's dan fam ben fam i can barely hear you when you go over the microphone ben fam fbi's and ben fam was asking me everything but my blood type and i was like this is nothing to do a guy commented on the page we took it down
[2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:59.560]  you called up and told me to put it back up and i'm not gonna let you set me up pal i'm not i'm not gonna post the cops name and phone number and somebody saying kill him
[2:14:59.560 --> 2:15:19.560]  and you know what that is immoral that i was told to do that and or maybe fam just is stupid i don't know but let me just explain something here i'm not gonna do that because he would have said i never told you that i never told you to put
[2:15:19.560 --> 2:15:30.560]  that up you you you made the threat when you put it back up i have no doubt they'd like to get me for something and they've been through all my taxes all my files everything and they've got these these these guys who are just
[2:15:30.560 --> 2:15:45.560]  Aaron boys over here snooping on me and i'm tired of it i'm gonna continue my work and you guys put me in prison on some setup baloney and people are only gonna spread the word that much more
[2:15:45.560 --> 2:15:55.560]  what are the computers crashing there i want to buy new computers at work i mean they're trying to pull up the video here i'll do it on my little computer and play the audio from here
[2:15:55.560 --> 2:16:07.560]  we have it go ahead and play the clip this is what the FBI needs to be investigating instead they got a big office right downtown austin i walked up and told cops out front at one night i said you know they run child kidnapping
[2:16:07.560 --> 2:16:19.560]  rings and the cops just laughed at me and said i i work in there so it's real funny isn't it yeah well it'll be funny when you shoot your kid up with that vaccine and their hair falls out when they're 18 and they die
[2:16:19.560 --> 2:16:25.560]  is you didn't listen to me and you laughed at me i know what i'm talking about go ahead and play the clip
[2:16:25.560 --> 2:16:42.560]  oh thank you mr chairman mr secretary i watched president bush deliver a moving speech at the united nations in september 2003 in which he mentioned he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade
[2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:56.560]  the president called for the punishment of those involved in this horrible business but at the very moment of that speech dinecore was exposed for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women and children
[2:16:56.560 --> 2:17:10.560]  while all of this was going on dinecore kept the pentagon contract to administer the small pots nantrax vaccines and is now working on a plague vaccine through the joint vaccine acquisition program
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:17.560]  mr secretary is it policy of the u.s. government to reward companies that traffic and women and little girls
[2:17:17.560 --> 2:17:30.560]  that's my first question my second question mr secretary according to the comptroller general of the united states there are serious financial management problems at the pentagon to which mr cooper alluded
[2:17:30.560 --> 2:17:43.560]  fiscal year 1999 2.3 trillion missing fiscal year 2001.1 trillion missing and do d is the number one reason why the government can't balance his checkbook
[2:17:43.560 --> 2:17:51.560]  the pentagon is claimed year after year that the reason it can't account for the money is because its computers don't communicate with each other
[2:17:51.560 --> 2:18:05.560]  my second question mr secretary is who has the contracts today to make those systems communicate with each other how long have they had those contracts and how much have the taxpayers paid for them
[2:18:05.560 --> 2:18:16.560]  finally mr secretary after the last hearing i thought that my office was promised a written response to my question regarding the four war games on september 11
[2:18:16.560 --> 2:18:28.560]  i have not yet received that response but would like for you to respond to the questions that i've put to you today and then i do expect the written response to my previous question
[2:18:28.560 --> 2:18:32.560]  hopefully by the end of the week.
[2:18:32.560 --> 2:18:50.560]  thank you representative the answer to your first question is no absolutely not the policy of the united states government is clear unambiguous and opposed to the activities that you described
[2:18:50.560 --> 2:19:04.560]  the second question well how do you explain the fact that dinecore and its successor companies have received and continue to receive government contracts
[2:19:04.560 --> 2:19:20.560]  i would have to go and find the facts but there are laws and rules and regulations with respect to government contracts and there are times that corporations do things they should not do in which case they tend to be suspended for some period
[2:19:20.560 --> 2:19:31.560]  there are times then that under the laws and the rules and regulations passed by the congress and implemented by the executive branch that corporations can get off of
[2:19:31.560 --> 2:19:38.560]  i'm gonna play the rest of this later we gotta go to break but see this isn't just a mechanic who people can try to poo poo and say oh she's whatever
[2:19:38.560 --> 2:19:47.560]  this is rum sold responding to the question he knows all about it and then they go on to respond and just again because the corporation has more rights than a person
[2:19:47.560 --> 2:20:00.560]  the corporation is allowed to kidnap children and then just get a fine i mean that's that's how this works you don't go to prison you don't get the death penalty you get more power you get government contracts

[2:24:21.560 --> 2:24:45.560]  for the APD here in the office with my federal subpoena to go to Virginia in the case of some idiot putting comments on my website why they need me to testify I don't know hopefully this moronal plea bargains I don't have to go but what an interesting interesting day Bob
[2:24:45.560 --> 2:25:03.560]  it is fantastic the world keeps on rolling deeper and deeper into the mire so to speak and but I'm glad that it's something as simple as that but it's not simple they keep asking me if I agree with the comments and things they're definitely
[2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:21.560]  trying to entrap you yeah they definitely want to put my butt in prison what you do is just be very nice and say hey my attorney's on his way over I already gave them my lawyers name and number for next time and they still showed up they don't care they'll still try it
[2:25:21.560 --> 2:25:35.560]  I mean it's so obvious that I post a comment we remove it before we're ever subpoenaed we have to go dig it out of the records under the federal subpoena and then they're still here asking me what I think of the comment
[2:25:35.560 --> 2:25:45.560]  again you know the entrapment hey Bob you've dealt with these people before what do you think about the original agent telling me to repost it
[2:25:45.560 --> 2:25:56.560]  I think that's entrapment I mean why would you want to put something back on that wasn't very nice or good or evil or against the law
[2:25:56.560 --> 2:26:17.560]  oh Jesus I'm just excuse me God you've got to mentally train yourself to deal with people who deal with real criminals all the time and what happens to the police mind is they get like the criminal mind and so they think everybody else might be a
[2:26:17.560 --> 2:26:28.560]  criminal so they approach everything that way including members of their own family it's something that happens to people in law enforcement
[2:26:28.560 --> 2:26:39.560]  and I have two members of my family who are in law enforcement one of them just retired as assistant chief of police in a major city and that's the way it is
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:51.560]  well they didn't like it when I was rattling off FBI crimes to them and saying that's why I don't trust them how to win friends and influence people you devil you
[2:26:51.560 --> 2:27:01.560]  you know they were actually I didn't get a really bad vibe one time with the VATF I did I mean my alarms were saying criminal criminal criminal watch out watch out
[2:27:01.560 --> 2:27:03.560]  totally different vibe
[2:27:03.560 --> 2:27:23.560]  I had to put up with them for about 40 years and they didn't like me very much at all and they in the marshals office are not very exemplary there's lots of good people in law enforcement but those two groups didn't get the best of the
[2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:25.560]  crop let's put it that way
[2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:43.560]  yeah well they've stolen 23.7 trillion and growing the unemployment skyrocketing and there's all this baloney news about how great the economy is and new home sales up tick then I read the number
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:51.560]  it said the decline slowed but the AP headline said it had grown I mean they are cooking some numbers Bob
[2:27:51.560 --> 2:28:09.560]  they certainly are and they're all in on it and they're all controlled in the media but the same people and there's nothing we can do about it except on this program and others like it tell people the truth keep on pumping out what is really happening
[2:28:09.560 --> 2:28:28.560]  and we're challenging them we're pushing them to greater heights and ourselves as well to put them down they're terrified we just discussed this before and that's why I do so many programs incidentally Alex I'm going to be on with the George Norris program
[2:28:28.560 --> 2:28:50.560]  on Saturday night and it's first time in a long time I've been on there but we're banging away and we're not going to give up and we're making headway we're helping people plan for emergencies both personal and physical and as well as their finances
[2:28:50.560 --> 2:29:12.560]  what should probably happen in the course of events and we can explain to them how people can steal 23.7 trillion dollars at colossal figure which which boggles the mind but you know if you lived in that culture like I did for 28 years
[2:29:12.560 --> 2:29:28.560]  you know that anything goes and they're always skating down the edge I mean it's part of the the mental concept that goes with the market and and so it's not disturbing or unusual that they do something like that
[2:29:28.560 --> 2:29:47.560]  all right Bob let's let's break down the latest developments the economy is it getting better like they're saying like they said three years ago was getting better or are they lying think I know the answer to that question but we'll also take your calls 1-800-25-99231 infowars.com is the website

[2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:35.560]  three three one three nine eight eight eight two five three three one three nine
[2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:50.560]  there is so much to go over so much to cover here Bob I want to just go right to call so we rarely take a lot of calls when you're on so you can cover the issues but specifically the economy
[2:34:50.560 --> 2:35:00.560]  the media saying everything's wonderful now as record repossessions record credit card defaults home loan defaults car defaults car loan defaults
[2:35:00.560 --> 2:35:12.560]  just every economic indicator is we're in deep trouble and they're still just saying everything's wonderful everything's wonderful as the banks now as we said six eight months ago took the bailout money and are hoarding it and they're
[2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:26.560]  paying other banks not to loan why do they not want banks loaning what where is the economy really going down and they're trying to tell us that the GDP for the second quarter was minus one percent
[2:35:26.560 --> 2:35:39.560]  now the previous quarter and I don't believe that figure was minus five point four percent and the one before that was minus six point seven you don't take quantum leaps like that over quarter to quarter
[2:35:39.560 --> 2:35:52.560]  I mean that that's a tremendous difference and they're lying I don't believe the figures one bit when I posted them for tomorrow's international forecaster at the end I said I don't believe these figures one bit
[2:35:52.560 --> 2:36:10.560]  and so they just lie and it's all part of a propaganda cy war campaign to make you believe that the economy is doing good so you go out and do the same things you were doing before the goddess and all of this debt problem
[2:36:10.560 --> 2:36:30.560]  absolutely my friend there is there's a lot of concern out there about the flu clearly they're using it as a political cover a way to pose as saviors a way to make tens of billions off vaccine but they're now announcing they are going to use the army for forced
[2:36:30.560 --> 2:36:44.560]  vaccinations they are going to try to forcibly shoot up the kids they're trying to make enough vaccine for every American Obama doctor Barack Obama was everybody to take three shots at least for a non event flu
[2:36:44.560 --> 2:36:55.560]  so it's clearly a sigh off the question is how bad is there some real by a weapon they're going to release you know that's what they talk about in their own government textbooks like eco science here's a copy of it
[2:36:55.560 --> 2:37:07.560]  they're saying the water the vaccines how to do it I mean they say they're going to do it and they've been caught doing it I mean but I guess it's an extreme and conspiracy theory to actually read their book and then be concerned about it
[2:37:07.560 --> 2:37:27.560]  and um well Alex where do they find out how many people are going to refuse to take it not only in the United States but throughout the world now I know it's mandatory already in some countries and a lot of people are going to take it because they're listening to the
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:43.560]  question that you and I and others are putting out my goodness my health section is now because of this as big as my US section of my publication but everything that's good that I read that comes through I post it in a link and so the people are finding out
[2:37:43.560 --> 2:38:00.560]  everywhere and I've had tremendous amount of requests of people wanting to leave the country because as you well know in other countries like in Latin America or Asia they're not as sticky about everybody having a shot you know they might say you should but they won't
[2:38:00.560 --> 2:38:07.560]  enforce it but they will in the United States and in Europe
[2:38:07.560 --> 2:38:19.560]  but what do you think the science all about have a big political smoke screen to pass cap and trade the gun bills the open border bills the water grab bill and their whole agenda is stalling
[2:38:19.560 --> 2:38:32.560]  and we see him building mass graves getting the military ready since January that we know of then they prime the hype in April for this non event of a few deaths and then now they're acting like it's the end of the world
[2:38:32.560 --> 2:38:45.560]  and that's just not how flu works all these top epidemiologists are on the news saying this is all a fraud but that they don't know why I think it's completely clear they're planning on using this as a pretext to lock everything down in the middle of the depression
[2:38:45.560 --> 2:38:54.560]  or it could just be a beta test for that down the road we know they're federalizing everything we know we're under UN control under this level six I mean
[2:38:54.560 --> 2:39:12.560]  Alex you're right it's a beta test to see what gains they can make to see what the reaction of the people is going to be and then they know when the big one comes so to speak two or three years down the line here
[2:39:12.560 --> 2:39:21.560]  maybe in six months for all we know what the reaction will be and of course the shots that you have will be worthless against the next slew that they've created
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:40.560]  one of the things that I married this possibility to is the as you know back in May I said that the US embassies were receiving US dollars to be traded for local currencies and I backed into that and that's verified
[2:39:40.560 --> 2:39:56.560]  I've got several sources on that and I said to myself well why would they do that well it's because the dollar is going to go down and they know it and when it goes down others and especially commercial people in other countries will not want to receive dollars
[2:39:56.560 --> 2:40:16.560]  they want to be paid some other way like in their own currency perhaps and the poor souls who are on vacation they won't want to take their American Express or the credit or debit cards or you won't be able to use an AATM card and so on and so forth
[2:40:16.560 --> 2:40:31.560]  so that's going to create a crisis and I think the dollar will fall from $79.5 for it is right now to the support level of $71.18 and during that period of time you'll have this slew situation going
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:49.560]  you'll have legislation which has been ground to a halt and I think they're going to do a beta test of three to five days on shutting the banks down there's a good possibility of that and then the next time around when they shut the banks down they're not going to open them
[2:40:49.560 --> 2:41:07.560]  and then they're going to have a devaluation and they're going to have a default and they're going to have a big powwow like they did in the early 70s and the Smithsonian talks and then at 8.1985 at the plaza records and all of these countries will get together
[2:41:07.560 --> 2:41:22.560]  and they will have formulas for devaluing those currencies against revaluing these currencies and there will be a default agreement and that's what they're headed for here
[2:41:22.560 --> 2:41:41.560]  and so that's why it's extremely important not to belong any currency if it can help it and to be in gold and silver related assets because they are going to either hold their own or go up in value
[2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:59.560]  it's like a bad dream Bob I mean everybody I know is either losing their job or getting pay cuts the economy is falling apart everywhere and they're not bringing the factories back they're not bringing the jobs back they are by design
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:15.560]  the White House economic sciences are says in his own textbooks he wants to shut down the economy and how to destroy the U.S. economy is described in here and that's actually what is covered in the book Ecoscience
[2:42:15.560 --> 2:42:30.560]  I mean that's what they're doing now it's that they're so over the top criminal that we're almost defenseless against it just because we can't even imagine they're this corrupt
[2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:52.560]  I've always said that it is very very difficult for the average decent human mind to even contemplate the diabolical criminality of these people they just can't believe people can be that bad just like you just said
[2:42:52.560 --> 2:43:06.560]  so sick it's like a bad dream it's it's a caller said a few days ago and I've since been repeating is it's true it's like being in a car with a maniac driving it at 150 miles an hour down a road and you know over the next
[2:43:06.560 --> 2:43:24.560]  hill there's a hairpin turn at 25 mile an hour turn you're telling look lunatic slow down it's real there's danger over that hill and they just say shut up conspiracy theorist you're all strapped in and they're driving like a maniac about to kill you and that's all I felt talking to these FBI guys
[2:43:24.560 --> 2:43:42.560]  I mean it's just I tell them about the new world order and it's all just funny it's all a joke it's all a game no it isn't a game it isn't a joke it's real it surely is
[2:43:42.560 --> 2:43:58.560]  what are you Obama doing is his approval rating plunges in January that in September October it'd be 40 and I guess the rest reason has it at 45 right now or something like that yeah it was the rest reason had it 49 last week and now it's
[2:43:58.560 --> 2:44:14.560]  dropped to 40 in some demographics but overall 47 and other polls have got him at 49 48 47 and these are groups that normally cook polls so he is just well he's plunged faster than any president in modern history
[2:44:14.560 --> 2:44:32.560]  yeah and his his claim to to great fortune is that he settled to dispute Cambridge Massachusetts over somebody who'd been picked up by the police and he said we can get this all sorted out by having a beer together
[2:44:32.560 --> 2:44:44.560]  and then the media is all he had a Bud Light the big corporate you know kind of white trash beer and I'm not saying Bud Lights but it really is bad beer in my opinion but the point that I mean he's got a few good products
[2:44:44.560 --> 2:44:55.560]  but I mean the issue is it's all about the the average guy beer you know that he was drinking and the other guys it's all just fluff crap
[2:44:55.560 --> 2:45:08.560]  incidentally Alex do you know who Jackie Mason is yes to the moon without a rocket well he's one of my favorite comics and he just did a piece on a banner and I've got the
[2:45:08.560 --> 2:45:30.560]  no no no that was Jackie Gleason yeah no no I know who Jackie Mason is he he goes on Fox News sure yeah and anyway he's just made a table about Mr. Obama our president and you'll see it tomorrow in my issue that the link and he really takes him apart he says Mr. Obama is a racist
[2:45:30.560 --> 2:45:42.560]  well I don't even know Mr. Obama is a racist he is a race pimp he's a social engineer he knows how to play everybody off against each other anyway it's entertaining
[2:45:42.560 --> 2:45:52.560]  I just I well let's just take calls I'm I'm I'm speechless here Maggie in Arizona Maggie you're on the air go ahead
[2:45:52.560 --> 2:46:04.560]  oh hello it's such a privilege to talk to you Alex and to you too Mr. Chapman what what I'm asking about is Alex I understand I missed part of the show yesterday unfortunately
[2:46:04.560 --> 2:46:19.560]  and I understand that there was an email and a caller regarding possible confirmation seeing something from the feds in regards to a bank holiday calling for the late late August undetermined links
[2:46:19.560 --> 2:46:35.560]  I'm wondering if no no she was she was and we did get the document and we've got another similar documents and documents with hospital workers being told they have to take shots and then a day after the guy told us that
[2:46:35.560 --> 2:46:50.560]  there was the document was actually in the news so this was a bank that is in New Orleans and they were saying we're going to have these injections for you
[2:46:50.560 --> 2:47:09.560]  I'm from another source I heard they actually did get an email from someone who has a close friend in the banking industry and she saw a notification stating that they would be closing undetermined links the date will be determined late in August
[2:47:09.560 --> 2:47:21.560]  yeah well there's a lot of banks themselves that are closing are being taken over so there's a lot of those notices going on but the establishment may have a bank holiday but really they're just going to devalue the currency
[2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:35.560]  but we have the expert on the line with this man I appreciate your call can you answer Maggie's question we do know and I did confirm this the State Department has all its embassies moving mostly out of their cash reserves they have millions per embassy
[2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:49.560]  and these vaults for different payoffs and different emergencies and other things little CIA command bases you remember that story a month ago or so about them dumping a lot of dollars and getting their local currency coming up for the fall
[2:47:49.560 --> 2:47:57.560]  that more and more looks like for the flu a global flu pandemic in case they decide to go with that or is that something else Bob Chapman
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:48:13.560]  well I just interpreted it just a little while ago as being and I said I backed into it being that the dollar was going to fall and not be accepted as readily as they might like and it probably will cause a crisis
[2:48:13.560 --> 2:48:35.560]  and in an embassy let's say in Munich which is one of the ones that received this money they galloped out and get rid of the dollars and bought euros and that's so that they would have a stash there and the local currency that would be accepted that they could continue to do the things that they have to do
[2:48:35.560 --> 2:48:49.560]  that's my take on it yes ma'am I wouldn't put anything past them they're clearly moving on all fronts to bring in the new world order agenda they're in high gear and so we have Department of Defense driving around the parking lot and FBI
[2:48:49.560 --> 2:49:10.560]  visiting and because the criminal takeovers happening and the banks are just totally ripe in the country I mean and they let me tell you I am a canary in the coal mine if they come grab me for something folks you better just you better just squeeze your butt cheeks together because they're coming after you
[2:49:10.560 --> 2:49:20.560]  I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm out of control folks it's just it's just that it's just that this is really going on this is really happening that's pretty funny isn't it Bob
[2:49:20.560 --> 2:49:42.560]  you're not going to get better and I think that's what you're trying to say and and so please please please prepare yourself mentally physically and get your food your dehydrated freeze dried food in your filter and make sure you get plenty of clips and ammo it's it's probably going to come down to that and I hate to have to say that but
[2:49:42.560 --> 2:49:54.560]  you know there's no like vampires they look for any excuse to get you in their system like you've done something oh you had a hair sticking up you had a crooked toenail life in prison
[2:49:54.560 --> 2:50:12.560]  well they they are overreacting to crime and when it's really not even crime and you know here the people like you and I who talk about the truth we're terrorists we're bad people and of course we're not
[2:50:12.560 --> 2:50:34.560]  the FBI Iran Paul sticker in the parking lot I said look DHS report terrorist and they kind of went yeah kind of smiled inward they should be ashamed of themselves you know that that's the way my mom would put it if she was still alive you know because she was so far
[2:50:34.560 --> 2:50:44.560]  in order so to speak and she would be so disappointed to see how our country's law enforcement is degenerated it's awful
[2:50:44.560 --> 2:51:00.560]  take a few calls from Ronnie Brian Joel cabler and others on the other side of this quick break it is sick when me and Bob just start laughing because I'm sitting here thinking about being drug off the prison and I'm just laughing it's so ridiculous
[2:51:00.560 --> 2:51:14.560]  silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic this very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world utopia Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called utopia silver
[2:51:14.560 --> 2:51:31.560]  who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein nitrates or saline solutions because our colloidal silver is made up of nano sized particles it could be better utilized at the cellular level and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern day antibiotics
[2:51:31.560 --> 2:51:43.560]  utopia silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver gold and copper with a money bag guarantee on the colloidal products we produce for four years utopia silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would
[2:51:43.560 --> 2:52:01.560]  steal our God given rights of health care and freedom of speech visit us today at utopia silver dot com that's utopia silver dot com or call 888 213 4338 888 8234338 and help us win this battle
[2:52:01.560 --> 2:52:07.560]  in the new world orders war against humanity Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[2:52:07.560 --> 2:52:13.560]  we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see
[2:52:13.560 --> 2:52:20.560]  the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[2:52:20.560 --> 2:52:24.560]  well Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one of this election
[2:52:24.560 --> 2:52:36.560]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascist
[2:52:36.560 --> 2:52:48.560]  it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government this film documents who Obama works for the lies he is told and his real agenda

[2:53:07.560 --> 2:53:12.560]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[2:53:12.560 --> 2:53:18.560]  it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[2:53:18.560 --> 2:53:23.560]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds

[2:53:48.560 --> 2:53:57.560]  that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[2:53:57.560 --> 2:54:00.560]  this is Alex Jones for survival seed bank dot com
[2:54:00.560 --> 2:54:18.560]  you're gonna find out who our surprise guest is here soon enough
[2:54:31.560 --> 2:54:37.560]  Bob Chapman is our guest Ronnie in Texas you're on the air thank you for holding
[2:54:37.560 --> 2:54:42.560]  thank you sir and I want to thank Mr. Chapman I've got two ideas for you one
[2:54:42.560 --> 2:54:49.560]  actually you can think in for you too I think is to help you and this program and everyone else is to keep laughing
[2:54:49.560 --> 2:54:55.560]  use humor whenever you can because and here's the key it helps people want to remember what you say to them
[2:54:55.560 --> 2:55:01.560]  because humor is like a reward and so sharing joy with info is the key I think it helps
[2:55:01.560 --> 2:55:03.560]  it's thinking whatever you're trying to do
[2:55:03.560 --> 2:55:07.560]  when the tyranny is so sick and so obvious and so ridiculous you start laughing
[2:55:07.560 --> 2:55:10.560]  I mean it's just sick
[2:55:10.560 --> 2:55:14.560]  I mean this world is just run by a bunch of scum
[2:55:14.560 --> 2:55:19.560]  and the public's all dumbed down but you know what I shouldn't be negative I appreciate your call Ronnie
[2:55:19.560 --> 2:55:27.560]  the good news here Bob is we're up to almost 300 sponsors to end the Fed the globalists are on the run on every front
[2:55:27.560 --> 2:55:29.560]  they must be really getting scared
[2:55:29.560 --> 2:55:33.560]  and they should
[2:55:33.560 --> 2:55:39.560]  we're formidable opponents
[2:55:39.560 --> 2:55:44.560]  oh let's take another call here let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Canada
[2:55:44.560 --> 2:55:46.560]  Brian go ahead
[2:55:46.560 --> 2:55:54.560]  hi Alex hi Bob I just wanted to let you guys know up in Canada yeah it's the same thing they say that the recession's over
[2:55:54.560 --> 2:55:57.560]  you know makes you wonder what kind of pills are taking
[2:55:57.560 --> 2:56:05.560]  but yeah you should stay positive Alex because if you want to social networks like 12 160 and other places like that
[2:56:05.560 --> 2:56:10.560]  people are well aware of what's going on and they're making up their own contingency plans
[2:56:10.560 --> 2:56:14.560]  they're communicating they're talking we're having a big effect
[2:56:14.560 --> 2:56:19.560]  Bob I was wondering if you don't think this is a mistake on their part too
[2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:23.560]  for years we have the impression that they're under the control of everything
[2:56:23.560 --> 2:56:26.560]  but that money is money and money is normal and regular
[2:56:26.560 --> 2:56:32.560]  and just recently when they come up with their let's say prefabricated problems
[2:56:32.560 --> 2:56:36.560]  they turn to us they tried to take money from us
[2:56:36.560 --> 2:56:41.560]  but when you saw them putting together the packages you had a big resistance from the people
[2:56:41.560 --> 2:56:46.560]  and so they kind of turned around and said well look we're the ones who created the money anyway
[2:56:46.560 --> 2:56:52.560]  so we can just create more and this kind of tells the public well watch if you create the money
[2:56:52.560 --> 2:56:56.560]  and if you can make your own money at any time to get yourself out of your own problems
[2:56:56.560 --> 2:57:00.560]  basically you don't need us we don't have to put up with you anymore
[2:57:00.560 --> 2:57:03.560]  it's kind of a mistake on their part
[2:57:03.560 --> 2:57:10.560]  well I think you're absolutely right and it's a very unusual but a droid way of explaining their problem
[2:57:10.560 --> 2:57:13.560]  and it's a very sophisticated answer
[2:57:13.560 --> 2:57:17.560]  and I thank you for it I hadn't thought of it in those terms
[2:57:17.560 --> 2:57:24.560]  but they underestimate people and there's a lot of very very bright people throughout the entire world
[2:57:24.560 --> 2:57:31.560]  and they think that they are far better than everybody else because they are in this elite group
[2:57:31.560 --> 2:57:35.560]  and of course they know better what's good for us than we do
[2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:40.560]  and when they're met with formidable force which they have many times before
[2:57:40.560 --> 2:57:43.560]  they've lost it this a number of times
[2:57:43.560 --> 2:57:48.560]  and the number of players along the way have been liquidated by different societies
[2:57:48.560 --> 2:57:53.560]  and many of them have been banned in the olden days they used to ban people for doing this
[2:57:53.560 --> 2:57:57.560]  although today I don't know where we can ban people too
[2:57:57.560 --> 2:58:03.560]  but the point is that we are making a tremendous effect
[2:58:03.560 --> 2:58:05.560]  we're making them react
[2:58:05.560 --> 2:58:08.560]  we're telling everybody what they're doing
[2:58:08.560 --> 2:58:14.560]  and in this environment where you have the layoffs and the drop in consumption
[2:58:14.560 --> 2:58:19.560]  the problems in housing both in all of those things
[2:58:19.560 --> 2:58:21.560]  people's minds are open
[2:58:21.560 --> 2:58:24.560]  All right Bob great having you on with us I appreciate you coming on
[2:58:24.560 --> 2:58:26.560]  Okay see you next week

[3:00:07.560 --> 3:00:12.560]  Well it's the final hour of this Friday edition last again on the A&M McDonald
[3:00:12.560 --> 3:00:16.560]  short ways XM radio and the internet
[3:00:16.560 --> 3:00:25.560]  and for the rest of the hour we're very honored to be joined by Harrison Pagan Schmidt or Jack Schmidt
[3:00:25.560 --> 3:00:32.560]  and he's an American geologist former NASA astronaut university professor and a US senator for one term
[3:00:32.560 --> 3:00:37.560]  he is the last of the Apollo astronauts to arrive and set foot on the moon
[3:00:37.560 --> 3:00:44.560]  and he took some of the most famous photos the bio goes on and on we'll talk about some of that while he's on with us
[3:00:44.560 --> 3:00:51.560]  but the main reason he's on today and I'm very honored to have him
[3:00:51.560 --> 3:00:57.560]  is that he has been very outspoken thank God against global warming being man-made
[3:00:57.560 --> 3:01:05.560]  we've had a lot of climatologists and a lot of researchers and sunspot experts in all these different fields
[3:01:05.560 --> 3:01:13.560]  and 37,000 of them sent letters a few months ago to the House of Representatives and they wouldn't even let them testify
[3:01:13.560 --> 3:01:21.560]  the media ignored them and then they used a few thousand scientists on the U.N. payroll to say we've got to totally change our way of life
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:28.560]  carbon dioxide is a deadly poison it's a national security issue and astronaut Jack Schmidt has spoken out against that
[3:01:28.560 --> 3:01:36.560]  with his scientific training in PhD in geology from Harvard University and all his other scientific research
[3:01:36.560 --> 3:01:44.560]  and the bio goes on and on and he reportedly took the famous photo of the marble blue marble of the earth from the moon
[3:01:44.560 --> 3:01:48.560]  and so it's pretty neat to have him on we're going to break in a few minutes but let's go ahead and introduce him
[3:01:48.560 --> 3:01:54.560]  it's great to have you on Mr. Schmidt it's my pleasure and privilege to be with you today
[3:01:54.560 --> 3:01:57.560]  I was flattered to learn that you'd actually heard of the show before
[3:01:57.560 --> 3:02:01.560]  oh yeah we try to keep track out here
[3:02:01.560 --> 3:02:08.560]  well Mr. Schmidt it's great to have you let's just launch into man-made global warming
[3:02:08.560 --> 3:02:15.560]  I mean they were growing grapes thousands of years ago in Britain but they're not now all the evidence shows it was
[3:02:15.560 --> 3:02:21.560]  it gets hotter and colder and Mars ice caps get smaller and then they get bigger they're getting bigger again
[3:02:21.560 --> 3:02:24.560]  isn't it the sun or am I wrong
[3:02:24.560 --> 3:02:27.560]  well all the evidence is that there's a solar connection
[3:02:27.560 --> 3:02:40.560]  the amplification mechanism is has not been determined by observation as yet but the observations that scientists
[3:02:40.560 --> 3:02:47.560]  who you might call field scientists the people who actually look at what nature's doing rather than trying to model it
[3:02:47.560 --> 3:02:56.560]  they those observations clearly indicate in my mind and I think in thousands of other minds
[3:02:56.560 --> 3:03:00.560]  that the the ultimate connection is with the sun
[3:03:00.560 --> 3:03:10.560]  now how small variations in solar irradiance are amplified into significant changes in ocean temperature
[3:03:10.560 --> 3:03:20.560]  significant changes in atmospheric temperature global cloud cover and the like is still I would have to say
[3:03:20.560 --> 3:03:24.560]  in the realm of hypotheses rather than theory
[3:03:24.560 --> 3:03:33.560]  however there's a very good hypothesis and that is that the solar magnetic field that vary with solar irradiance
[3:03:33.560 --> 3:03:41.560]  that are really determining the flux of cosmic rays into the atmosphere and therefore the amount of clouds that form
[3:03:41.560 --> 3:03:44.560]  and they're forming what the nuclei
[3:03:44.560 --> 3:03:54.560]  that form that when they interact with molecules of oxygen and hydrogen in the Earth's atmosphere
[3:03:54.560 --> 3:04:02.560]  you develop charged particles that then attract water vapor and become the nucleus for cloud formation
[3:04:02.560 --> 3:04:07.560]  and when the sun is relatively inactive for example like it is right now
[3:04:07.560 --> 3:04:13.560]  then the magnetic magnetic fields that protect us from cosmic rays are depressed
[3:04:13.560 --> 3:04:19.560]  cosmic ray interaction with the atmosphere more clouds and therefore the clouds reflect more sunlight
[3:04:19.560 --> 3:04:22.560]  and you end up with a cooling trend
[3:04:22.560 --> 3:04:30.560]  and we've had that as most people in the northern hemisphere at least now realize we've had that for almost 10 years
[3:04:30.560 --> 3:04:36.560]  you may have noted that there was a recent announcement that I guess at Del Gore's hometown in Tennessee
[3:04:36.560 --> 3:04:40.560]  has had its coldest year on record so far
[3:04:40.560 --> 3:04:50.560]  there's been a lot of record but not just that then the Al Gore people been caught faking buoys and other weather stations
[3:04:50.560 --> 3:04:53.560]  faking higher temperatures in the last few years
[3:04:53.560 --> 3:04:56.560]  our guest is also the author of Return to the Moon
[3:04:56.560 --> 3:04:59.560]  he's Harrison Schmidt we're very honored to have him
[3:04:59.560 --> 3:05:11.560]  he is an astronaut
[3:05:29.560 --> 3:05:31.560]  dangerous summer storm season is here again
[3:05:31.560 --> 3:05:35.560]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages
[3:05:35.560 --> 3:05:36.560]  number five
[3:05:36.560 --> 3:05:40.560]  a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[3:05:40.560 --> 3:05:44.560]  folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science

[3:07:29.560 --> 3:07:32.560]  which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services
[3:07:32.560 --> 3:07:34.560]  folks it's time to be prepared for the worst
[3:07:34.560 --> 3:07:36.560]  our friends at Solutions from Science
[3:07:36.560 --> 3:07:39.560]  have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course
[3:07:39.560 --> 3:07:42.560]  that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines
[3:07:42.560 --> 3:07:44.560]  in the privacy of your own home
[3:07:44.560 --> 3:07:47.560]  it's called herbal preparations and natural therapies
[3:07:47.560 --> 3:07:49.560]  and it's flat out the best course of its kind
[3:07:49.560 --> 3:07:51.560]  I recommend you visit this important new website at
[3:07:51.560 --> 3:07:53.560]  makeherbalmedicines.com
[3:07:53.560 --> 3:07:55.560]  that's makeherbalmedicines.com
[3:07:55.560 --> 3:08:02.560]  or call toll-free 877-327-0365
[3:08:02.560 --> 3:08:05.560]  ease the T-Rex of political talk
[3:08:05.560 --> 3:08:11.560]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[3:08:11.560 --> 3:08:14.560]  well we're really lucky today
[3:08:14.560 --> 3:08:16.560]  for the rest of the hour
[3:08:16.560 --> 3:08:20.560]  to have Dr. Harrison Schmidt, Jack Schmidt
[3:08:20.560 --> 3:08:24.560]  American geologist, former NASA astronaut
[3:08:24.560 --> 3:08:27.560]  university professor and former US senator
[3:08:27.560 --> 3:08:31.560]  and he also of course walked on the moon
[3:08:31.560 --> 3:08:35.560]  on Apollo 17 and don't worry we're going to talk about that
[3:08:35.560 --> 3:08:39.560]  before he leaves us today but the big crisis at hand
[3:08:39.560 --> 3:08:43.560]  is the hoax, the manufactured crisis
[3:08:43.560 --> 3:08:46.560]  of global warming and I have Club of Rome documents
[3:08:46.560 --> 3:08:47.560]  all that will go over it with him
[3:08:47.560 --> 3:08:49.560]  where they admit this is just their pretext
[3:08:49.560 --> 3:08:51.560]  to turn us into the Soviet Union
[3:08:51.560 --> 3:08:55.560]  to micromanage the entire carbon cycle
[3:08:55.560 --> 3:08:56.560]  but I guess a lot of people out there
[3:08:56.560 --> 3:08:58.560]  aren't biologists or aren't geologists
[3:08:58.560 --> 3:09:01.560]  and don't understand this but he's here with us today
[3:09:01.560 --> 3:09:04.560]  to go over the science of that because he's bravely
[3:09:04.560 --> 3:09:06.560]  you get branded a heretic
[3:09:06.560 --> 3:09:08.560]  come out against this hoax
[3:09:08.560 --> 3:09:10.560]  and so Dr. Schmidt again
[3:09:10.560 --> 3:09:13.560]  let's continue going into why you decided to go public
[3:09:13.560 --> 3:09:16.560]  and start talking about this whole carbon tax
[3:09:16.560 --> 3:09:21.560]  and the science behind supposed man-made global warming
[3:09:21.560 --> 3:09:26.560]  well the primary reason that I and thousands of other
[3:09:26.560 --> 3:09:29.560]  observers of nature if you will
[3:09:29.560 --> 3:09:31.560]  I'm a field geologist
[3:09:31.560 --> 3:09:35.560]  have become more active is dark
[3:09:35.560 --> 3:09:37.560]  is too cold
[3:09:37.560 --> 3:09:42.560]  one is that we are concerned about the misuse of science
[3:09:42.560 --> 3:09:46.560]  and particularly the misuse of modeling
[3:09:46.560 --> 3:09:50.560]  of a very complex system called climate
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:53.560]  that is so complex that it really can't be done
[3:09:53.560 --> 3:09:58.560]  in fact there are many people who are experts in modeling
[3:09:58.560 --> 3:10:02.560]  astrophysicists and others that have said the same thing
[3:10:02.560 --> 3:10:04.560]  Freeman Dyson for example
[3:10:04.560 --> 3:10:08.560]  that the climate system is just too complex to model
[3:10:08.560 --> 3:10:10.560]  and when you get into it
[3:10:10.560 --> 3:10:15.560]  you find that the many assumptions that are made
[3:10:15.560 --> 3:10:20.560]  in order to just make what they call the physics work
[3:10:20.560 --> 3:10:24.560]  are just invalid and any test that you make against those models
[3:10:24.560 --> 3:10:28.560]  against reality have so far indicated the models are wrong
[3:10:28.560 --> 3:10:32.560]  and so many of us just feel that although they're called climate scientists
[3:10:32.560 --> 3:10:34.560]  they're not using science in the right way
[3:10:34.560 --> 3:10:37.560]  and particularly modeling science in the right way
[3:10:37.560 --> 3:10:40.560]  models are very helpful in providing insights
[3:10:40.560 --> 3:10:43.560]  but you should not base predictions of the future
[3:10:43.560 --> 3:10:47.560]  on these extremely complex models that are filled with assumptions
[3:10:47.560 --> 3:10:52.560]  so that number one we've been concerned about the misuse of science
[3:10:52.560 --> 3:10:58.560]  but I think more fundamentally this misuse of science
[3:10:58.560 --> 3:11:04.560]  has led to politicians and ideologues
[3:11:04.560 --> 3:11:09.560]  to try to gain control of the American economy
[3:11:09.560 --> 3:11:14.560]  and indeed the global economy by sharing people
[3:11:14.560 --> 3:11:21.560]  now the science is quite clear that there has been since 1660
[3:11:21.560 --> 3:11:25.560]  about a half a degree warming every hundred years
[3:11:25.560 --> 3:11:32.560]  that is a natural cycle that represents the earth
[3:11:32.560 --> 3:11:35.560]  coming out of what was called a little ice age
[3:11:35.560 --> 3:11:37.560]  an extremely cold period for the earth
[3:11:37.560 --> 3:11:43.560]  back in the beginning about 1400
[3:11:43.560 --> 3:11:49.560]  that if you want to read some of the history of the American Revolutionary War
[3:11:49.560 --> 3:11:54.560]  you will realize like the book Sam Adams by McCullough
[3:11:54.560 --> 3:11:56.560]  you realize how damn cold it was
[3:11:56.560 --> 3:12:01.560]  and that was partly that we were just moving out of the little ice age
[3:12:01.560 --> 3:12:04.560]  very slowly and it was still very cold
[3:12:04.560 --> 3:12:08.560]  and so the natural warming is clearly happening
[3:12:08.560 --> 3:12:13.560]  but there is absolutely no observational evidence whatsoever
[3:12:13.560 --> 3:12:19.560]  that the increase in carbon dioxide that has been measured
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:23.560]  in the last 50 years has had anything to do with that
[3:12:23.560 --> 3:12:28.560]  primarily because the warming started before the industrial revolution
[3:12:28.560 --> 3:12:31.560]  ever began
[3:12:31.560 --> 3:12:33.560]  now where is that carbon dioxide coming from?
[3:12:33.560 --> 3:12:36.560]  well it's probably coming mostly out of the ocean
[3:12:36.560 --> 3:12:39.560]  because the oceans are getting warmer
[3:12:39.560 --> 3:12:41.560]  there's a lag in that process
[3:12:41.560 --> 3:12:45.560]  of the oceans giving up carbon dioxide as they warm
[3:12:45.560 --> 3:12:49.560]  but nevertheless it can be a lag of a few centuries
[3:12:49.560 --> 3:12:54.560]  but nevertheless that's probably where most of that rise in CO2 is coming from
[3:12:54.560 --> 3:12:58.560]  well we're talking to Harrison Smith, Dr. Harrison Smith, Jack Schmidt
[3:12:58.560 --> 3:13:02.560]  one of the Apollo astronauts walks in the moon, took the most famous photo
[3:13:02.560 --> 3:13:06.560]  one of the most famous photos ever of the moon and the little blue marble
[3:13:06.560 --> 3:13:08.560]  out there we're going to talk about that later
[3:13:08.560 --> 3:13:10.560]  but you're a doctor in this
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:14.560]  I'm just one who studies and interviews scientists and people
[3:13:14.560 --> 3:13:18.560]  but Al Gore got caught according to all the ice core samples and people
[3:13:18.560 --> 3:13:20.560]  that I've interviewed and seen on television
[3:13:20.560 --> 3:13:24.560]  he put the two, the carbon dioxide going up with the warming
[3:13:24.560 --> 3:13:27.560]  when really the carbon dioxide comes after the warming
[3:13:27.560 --> 3:13:30.560]  as you just said that's from all the governments, all the universities
[3:13:30.560 --> 3:13:33.560]  all the ocean studies, ice cores correct
[3:13:33.560 --> 3:13:35.560]  so that's more cooking the books
[3:13:35.560 --> 3:13:41.560]  and then they've also caught some of the top global warming supporters
[3:13:41.560 --> 3:13:44.560]  accidentally and I put that in quotes
[3:13:44.560 --> 3:13:48.560]  having false data from their weather stations and buoys
[3:13:48.560 --> 3:13:50.560]  jacking up numbers
[3:13:50.560 --> 3:13:54.560]  so I just don't see how they say it's an open and shut case
[3:13:54.560 --> 3:13:57.560]  when the majority of scientists pulled out there
[3:13:57.560 --> 3:13:59.560]  say that it's completely natural
[3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:03.560]  and that man made global warming is a fraud
[3:14:03.560 --> 3:14:08.560]  well it is being used proactively
[3:14:08.560 --> 3:14:10.560]  there's no question about it
[3:14:10.560 --> 3:14:13.560]  and it's being used for political purposes
[3:14:13.560 --> 3:14:17.560]  and hopefully the American people have started to realize that
[3:14:17.560 --> 3:14:22.560]  certainly their surveys that indicate that the common sense of the American people
[3:14:22.560 --> 3:14:25.560]  on climate change is starting to take hold
[3:14:25.560 --> 3:14:29.560]  as it apparently is on healthcare revisions
[3:14:29.560 --> 3:14:32.560]  and the so-called stimulus package
[3:14:32.560 --> 3:14:36.560]  where there is a concerted effort in the new administration
[3:14:36.560 --> 3:14:39.560]  and the congress that's supporting them
[3:14:39.560 --> 3:14:43.560]  and what one might call a state-run media
[3:14:43.560 --> 3:14:47.560]  to support them to move this country in directions
[3:14:47.560 --> 3:14:50.560]  that the increased government control
[3:14:50.560 --> 3:14:54.560]  is just about every major facet of our life
[3:14:54.560 --> 3:14:58.560]  absolutely, you know they wouldn't let anybody see 300 pages of the
[3:14:58.560 --> 3:15:01.560]  1300 page bill till right when they voted on it
[3:15:01.560 --> 3:15:03.560]  now we have it
[3:15:03.560 --> 3:15:06.560]  home inspections, federal power to kick you out of your house if they want
[3:15:06.560 --> 3:15:08.560]  take over all the land
[3:15:08.560 --> 3:15:12.560]  it allows 30 plus federal agencies to just levy taxes and fines
[3:15:12.560 --> 3:15:14.560]  outside congress' power
[3:15:14.560 --> 3:15:17.560]  it's kind of a letter of mark
[3:15:17.560 --> 3:15:20.560]  just being given to any agency or group
[3:15:20.560 --> 3:15:24.560]  to go out and piratically shake down the public
[3:15:24.560 --> 3:15:28.560]  well it's not encouraging
[3:15:28.560 --> 3:15:32.560]  liberty is definitely threatened under this current
[3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:35.560]  in this current political environment
[3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:38.560]  and we just, all of us who believe in liberty
[3:15:38.560 --> 3:15:41.560]  are going to have to begin to take steps to counter it
[3:15:41.560 --> 3:15:44.560]  and it's encouraging to see the governors
[3:15:44.560 --> 3:15:47.560]  and the legislators of a few states
[3:15:47.560 --> 3:15:51.560]  starting to push back in terms of
[3:15:51.560 --> 3:15:54.560]  gaining a
[3:15:54.560 --> 3:15:57.560]  founder's interpretation of the 10th amendment
[3:15:57.560 --> 3:16:01.560]  namely that amendment that leaves everything not enumerated in the constitution
[3:16:01.560 --> 3:16:05.560]  to the authority of the private sector of the state
[3:16:05.560 --> 3:16:09.560]  and so that is I think a very very encouraging trend
[3:16:09.560 --> 3:16:12.560]  and I certainly hope that they'll continue in that direction
[3:16:12.560 --> 3:16:16.560]  to at least try to put the brakes on the legal brakes
[3:16:16.560 --> 3:16:20.560]  the constitutional brakes on what's happening
[3:16:20.560 --> 3:16:23.560]  well I think you're right, I mean the polls show you're right
[3:16:23.560 --> 3:16:26.560]  that people are finally, they've gone from 60 plus percent a few years ago
[3:16:26.560 --> 3:16:29.560]  believing man make global warming was this big threat
[3:16:29.560 --> 3:16:32.560]  and we were all dead and carbon dioxide was deadly poison
[3:16:32.560 --> 3:16:34.560]  and would kill you in seconds
[3:16:34.560 --> 3:16:38.560]  to now realizing that it is a fraud and a hoax
[3:16:38.560 --> 3:16:42.560]  and just a new tax and now they've only got about 40 percent support
[3:16:42.560 --> 3:16:45.560]  and that's imploding quickly but it seems like the federal government
[3:16:45.560 --> 3:16:48.560]  and as you said the state controlled media, the big corporate media
[3:16:48.560 --> 3:16:52.560]  they want this new tax, they want this control and they don't care
[3:16:52.560 --> 3:16:55.560]  it looks like they're going to just ram it through maybe
[3:16:55.560 --> 3:16:59.560]  well we'll see, you know there's a lot of resistance
[3:16:59.560 --> 3:17:02.560]  that's pushed back now and the August recess
[3:17:02.560 --> 3:17:06.560]  should help us as the common sense of the American people
[3:17:06.560 --> 3:17:10.560]  is put forward to their representatives
[3:17:10.560 --> 3:17:14.560]  and we'll just see how we come out of this particular period
[3:17:14.560 --> 3:17:17.560]  you mentioned the corporate media
[3:17:17.560 --> 3:17:22.560]  I would not necessarily blame it on being corporate media
[3:17:22.560 --> 3:17:26.560]  it's just media that's in the tank for this change
[3:17:26.560 --> 3:17:30.560]  socialistic change in our political system
[3:17:30.560 --> 3:17:34.560]  and it's because just about everybody in the media now
[3:17:34.560 --> 3:17:38.560]  who have been in orders and less than otherwise
[3:17:38.560 --> 3:17:46.560]  have come out of an elementary, secondary and college education
[3:17:46.560 --> 3:17:50.560]  that has been dominated by people who have less respect for liberty
[3:17:50.560 --> 3:17:52.560]  than you or not
[3:17:52.560 --> 3:17:57.560]  well yes sir we're talking to Apollo astronaut Dr. Schmidt
[3:17:57.560 --> 3:18:02.560]  my point was Rex Tillerson at ExxonMobil said
[3:18:02.560 --> 3:18:05.560]  we've looked at this, this is just a tax on oil
[3:18:05.560 --> 3:18:07.560]  this is a fraud
[3:18:07.560 --> 3:18:10.560]  and then David Rockefeller the majority owner at a board meeting
[3:18:10.560 --> 3:18:13.560]  this was in the news said you're going to come out and say it's real
[3:18:13.560 --> 3:18:16.560]  and so even Rex Tillerson came out and said okay it's real
[3:18:16.560 --> 3:18:20.560]  so when you see the NFL and every other big organization
[3:18:20.560 --> 3:18:23.560]  pushing it when the American football league is
[3:18:23.560 --> 3:18:25.560]  the national football league is pushing it
[3:18:25.560 --> 3:18:27.560]  we know the establishments behind it
[3:18:27.560 --> 3:18:31.560]  are you saying that that's just the incredible peer pressure and hype
[3:18:31.560 --> 3:18:36.560]  or is some scientists are saying this is the new global religion
[3:18:36.560 --> 3:18:39.560]  this is the new organizing force
[3:18:39.560 --> 3:18:43.560]  well it has certain characteristics of a religion
[3:18:43.560 --> 3:18:51.560]  in that there's a great amount of faith that the climate modelers
[3:18:51.560 --> 3:18:54.560]  have the right answer
[3:18:54.560 --> 3:19:00.560]  but it is also I think related to a much longer term
[3:19:00.560 --> 3:19:08.560]  ideological battle that's been going on far before climate change came along
[3:19:08.560 --> 3:19:17.560]  for the ideological battle of those that believe that
[3:19:17.560 --> 3:19:22.560]  you should maximize human liberty under certain guidelines
[3:19:22.560 --> 3:19:24.560]  such as our constitution
[3:19:24.560 --> 3:19:28.560]  and those who feel that you should give up human liberty
[3:19:28.560 --> 3:19:35.560]  for a variety of their particular ideological reasons
[3:19:35.560 --> 3:19:38.560]  well I agree with you Dr. Schmidt we're about to break
[3:19:38.560 --> 3:19:40.560]  we'll come back and get into some other issues
[3:19:40.560 --> 3:19:42.560]  as well like health care with you
[3:19:42.560 --> 3:19:44.560]  then of course get into the moon itself
[3:19:44.560 --> 3:19:49.560]  and what it's like to be an astronaut who's been off the planet
[3:19:49.560 --> 3:19:53.560]  I guess you're amongst people who've been the farthest away from the earth
[3:19:53.560 --> 3:19:55.560]  of anybody else in the world
[3:19:55.560 --> 3:20:00.560]  your mission was supposedly there the longest right if I'm not quoting that wrong
[3:20:00.560 --> 3:20:03.560]  there's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz California
[3:20:03.560 --> 3:20:05.560]  who owns one of our affiliate radio stations
[3:20:05.560 --> 3:20:08.560]  he got laid off from a job he loved many years ago
[3:20:08.560 --> 3:20:09.560]  he was devastated
[3:20:09.560 --> 3:20:11.560]  but it taught him a lesson very early in life
[3:20:11.560 --> 3:20:13.560]  that even when you do a great job for someone
[3:20:13.560 --> 3:20:16.560]  and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day
[3:20:16.560 --> 3:20:18.560]  there is no job security
[3:20:18.560 --> 3:20:20.560]  you are always in danger of losing your job
[3:20:20.560 --> 3:20:22.560]  unless you take charge of your livelihood
[3:20:22.560 --> 3:20:24.560]  and own your own business
[3:20:24.560 --> 3:20:27.560]  since you are the boss nobody can fire you
[3:20:27.560 --> 3:20:30.560]  so MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years
[3:20:30.560 --> 3:20:34.560]  and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits
[3:20:34.560 --> 3:20:37.560]  of working for themselves and not for others
[3:20:37.560 --> 3:20:40.560]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity
[3:20:40.560 --> 3:20:43.560]  involving the marketing of helpful dark chocolate
[3:20:43.560 --> 3:20:44.560]  that can help people lose weight
[3:20:44.560 --> 3:20:47.560]  and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income
[3:20:47.560 --> 3:20:50.560]  visit chocolate.ownmyself.com
[3:20:50.560 --> 3:20:51.560]  and check out the opportunity
[3:20:51.560 --> 3:20:54.560]  that's chocolate.ownmyself.com
[3:20:54.560 --> 3:20:55.560]  it takes very little money
[3:20:55.560 --> 3:20:56.560]  and if you're interested
[3:20:56.560 --> 3:20:58.560]  MZ wants to talk to you
[3:20:58.560 --> 3:21:01.560]  remember chocolate.ownmyself.com
[3:21:02.560 --> 3:21:04.560]  Hi this is Ted Anderson
[3:21:04.560 --> 3:21:07.560]  have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[3:21:07.560 --> 3:21:10.560]  won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[3:21:10.560 --> 3:21:11.560]  that's right
[3:21:11.560 --> 3:21:14.560]  gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986
[3:21:14.560 --> 3:21:18.560]  yet still the financial industry refuses to recognize
[3:21:18.560 --> 3:21:21.560]  the value of real hard assets for your retirement
[3:21:21.560 --> 3:21:22.560]  the truth be told
[3:21:22.560 --> 3:21:25.560]  gold and silver is outperformed paper investments
[3:21:25.560 --> 3:21:27.560]  like stocks, bonds and CDs
[3:21:27.560 --> 3:21:29.560]  yet no word about IRAs
[3:21:29.560 --> 3:21:33.560]  perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets
[3:21:33.560 --> 3:21:35.560]  by keeping you in paper
[3:21:35.560 --> 3:21:38.560]  if you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement
[3:21:38.560 --> 3:21:41.560]  call 800-686-2237
[3:21:41.560 --> 3:21:43.560]  don't get left behind by rising inflation
[3:21:43.560 --> 3:21:45.560]  and low return on your paper investments
[3:21:45.560 --> 3:21:48.560]  call 800-686-2237
[3:21:48.560 --> 3:21:50.560]  make sure that you secure your future
[3:21:50.560 --> 3:21:54.560]  call 800-686-2237
[3:21:54.560 --> 3:21:58.560]  that's 1-800-686-2237
[3:22:01.560 --> 3:22:04.560]  in the new world order's war against humanity
[3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:07.560]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[3:22:07.560 --> 3:22:09.560]  we've got to give them a stake
[3:22:09.560 --> 3:22:11.560]  in creating the kind of world order
[3:22:11.560 --> 3:22:13.560]  that I think all of us would like to see
[3:22:13.560 --> 3:22:15.560]  the Obama deception
[3:22:15.560 --> 3:22:17.560]  completely destroys the myth
[3:22:17.560 --> 3:22:20.560]  that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[3:22:20.560 --> 3:22:22.560]  while Obama's already fudging
[3:22:22.560 --> 3:22:24.560]  fudged since day one in this election
[3:22:24.560 --> 3:22:26.560]  if you have a demagogue
[3:22:26.560 --> 3:22:29.560]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:22:29.560 --> 3:22:33.560]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers
[3:22:33.560 --> 3:22:35.560]  and finance oligarchs
[3:22:35.560 --> 3:22:37.560]  that's fascism
[3:22:37.560 --> 3:22:39.560]  it's not about left to right
[3:22:39.560 --> 3:22:41.560]  it's about a one-world government
[3:22:41.560 --> 3:22:44.560]  this film documents who Obama works for
[3:22:44.560 --> 3:22:46.560]  the lies he is told
[3:22:46.560 --> 3:22:48.560]  and his real agenda

[3:22:56.560 --> 3:22:58.560]  the Obama deception
[3:22:58.560 --> 3:23:19.560]  the people strike back
[3:23:28.560 --> 3:23:31.560]  with your favorite beverage once a day
[3:23:58.560 --> 3:24:01.560]  at 949-3570
[3:24:28.560 --> 3:24:40.560]  it's crazy
[3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:42.560]  sir we were talking during the break
[3:24:42.560 --> 3:24:44.560]  what do you like in this too
[3:24:44.560 --> 3:24:46.560]  this saying drug the water supply
[3:24:46.560 --> 3:24:48.560]  sterilize the men and women
[3:24:48.560 --> 3:24:50.560]  he says in this book
[3:24:50.560 --> 3:24:52.560]  take all the children at birth
[3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:54.560]  and raise them in communal
[3:24:54.560 --> 3:24:56.560]  commune buildings
[3:24:56.560 --> 3:24:58.560]  China tried but it failed
[3:24:58.560 --> 3:25:01.560]  you say you're aware of some of this
[3:25:01.560 --> 3:25:03.560]  they admit in this book
[3:25:03.560 --> 3:25:05.560]  they want to use global warming taxes
[3:25:05.560 --> 3:25:08.560]  as a cover for their communism
[3:25:08.560 --> 3:25:11.560]  well I think that there are individuals
[3:25:11.560 --> 3:25:14.560]  holding them apparently among them
[3:25:14.560 --> 3:25:16.560]  who
[3:25:16.560 --> 3:25:18.560]  and a very large number
[3:25:18.560 --> 3:25:20.560]  who have taken the environment
[3:25:20.560 --> 3:25:22.560]  taken
[3:25:22.560 --> 3:25:25.560]  shall we say captured the environmental movement
[3:25:25.560 --> 3:25:28.560]  and turned it into
[3:25:28.560 --> 3:25:32.560]  what previously was considered
[3:25:32.560 --> 3:25:34.560]  a communist movement
[3:25:34.560 --> 3:25:36.560]  and that's just something that
[3:25:36.560 --> 3:25:38.560]  people of common sense are going to have
[3:25:38.560 --> 3:25:40.560]  to continue to counter
[3:25:40.560 --> 3:25:42.560]  and wake up enough
[3:25:42.560 --> 3:25:46.560]  so that they take control of their government again
[3:25:46.560 --> 3:25:49.560]  it certainly is extremely important
[3:25:49.560 --> 3:25:51.560]  that the United States
[3:25:51.560 --> 3:25:55.560]  maintain itself as the beacon
[3:25:55.560 --> 3:25:57.560]  of liberty on this planet
[3:25:57.560 --> 3:25:59.560]  there are all sorts of issues
[3:25:59.560 --> 3:26:01.560]  spaces included in that
[3:26:01.560 --> 3:26:03.560]  where if we are not
[3:26:03.560 --> 3:26:06.560]  taking a leadership role
[3:26:06.560 --> 3:26:08.560]  in preserving liberty
[3:26:08.560 --> 3:26:10.560]  then it will disappear
[3:26:10.560 --> 3:26:12.560]  because other nations
[3:26:12.560 --> 3:26:15.560]  have so far tolerated
[3:26:15.560 --> 3:26:19.560]  a continued attack on liberty
[3:26:19.560 --> 3:26:21.560]  that has been going on now
[3:26:21.560 --> 3:26:23.560]  certainly since
[3:26:23.560 --> 3:26:25.560]  the turn of their century
[3:26:25.560 --> 3:26:28.560]  well doctor you're obviously very well read
[3:26:28.560 --> 3:26:30.560]  turn of the last century
[3:26:30.560 --> 3:26:32.560]  since the 1900s
[3:26:32.560 --> 3:26:34.560]  absolutely but doctor you're obviously very well read
[3:26:34.560 --> 3:26:36.560]  on just the current news
[3:26:36.560 --> 3:26:39.560]  I'm sure you've seen the announcements
[3:26:39.560 --> 3:26:41.560]  where they're saying
[3:26:41.560 --> 3:26:43.560]  oh we're going to have a new bank of the world
[3:26:43.560 --> 3:26:45.560]  you're going to pay your carbon taxes
[3:26:45.560 --> 3:26:47.560]  a new world order
[3:26:47.560 --> 3:26:49.560]  called for a world government
[3:26:49.560 --> 3:26:51.560]  two weeks ago
[3:26:51.560 --> 3:26:53.560]  to quote administer the environmental movement
[3:26:53.560 --> 3:26:55.560]  I mean clearly that's what Holdren says
[3:26:55.560 --> 3:26:57.560]  he says a planetary government
[3:26:57.560 --> 3:26:59.560]  to micro manage and reduce our numbers
[3:26:59.560 --> 3:27:01.560]  by at least 80%
[3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:04.560]  what is your view on that
[3:27:04.560 --> 3:27:07.560]  and when you were in government as a U.S. Senator
[3:27:07.560 --> 3:27:09.560]  did you ever hear any talk like this
[3:27:09.560 --> 3:27:12.560]  or is this starting to gain steam now
[3:27:12.560 --> 3:27:15.560]  I think it has been gaining steam
[3:27:15.560 --> 3:27:17.560]  and you heard you saw a little of it
[3:27:17.560 --> 3:27:19.560]  in my time
[3:27:19.560 --> 3:27:23.560]  in the Senate back in the late 70s and early 80s
[3:27:23.560 --> 3:27:27.560]  partisanship was beginning to really raise
[3:27:27.560 --> 3:27:30.560]  the ugly head more extensively than ever
[3:27:30.560 --> 3:27:33.560]  at least in modern time
[3:27:33.560 --> 3:27:37.560]  but it has clearly taken off
[3:27:37.560 --> 3:27:40.560]  in recent decades
[3:27:40.560 --> 3:27:42.560]  I think primarily
[3:27:42.560 --> 3:27:45.560]  because of the
[3:27:45.560 --> 3:27:49.560]  capture of the government school system
[3:27:49.560 --> 3:27:53.560]  by the opponents of liberty
[3:27:53.560 --> 3:27:56.560]  and that is I think the fundamental reason
[3:27:56.560 --> 3:27:58.560]  why we are today
[3:27:58.560 --> 3:28:01.560]  now does that mean that the common sense
[3:28:01.560 --> 3:28:03.560]  has totally disappeared from the American people
[3:28:03.560 --> 3:28:05.560]  due to the education
[3:28:05.560 --> 3:28:08.560]  and the elementary and secondary school system
[3:28:08.560 --> 3:28:10.560]  I don't think so
[3:28:10.560 --> 3:28:14.560]  because you still see particularly in current surveys
[3:28:14.560 --> 3:28:16.560]  a great deal of common sense
[3:28:16.560 --> 3:28:18.560]  reappearing
[3:28:18.560 --> 3:28:20.560]  but on the other hand
[3:28:20.560 --> 3:28:23.560]  that has to be sufficient
[3:28:23.560 --> 3:28:25.560]  to take back control of the government
[3:28:25.560 --> 3:28:28.560]  we let ourselves be low asleep
[3:28:28.560 --> 3:28:31.560]  in the last election cycle
[3:28:31.560 --> 3:28:33.560]  the last two election cycles
[3:28:33.560 --> 3:28:35.560]  until all of a sudden
[3:28:35.560 --> 3:28:37.560]  we have a president
[3:28:37.560 --> 3:28:39.560]  and a majority in both houses of Congress
[3:28:39.560 --> 3:28:43.560]  that think identically about these matters
[3:28:43.560 --> 3:28:47.560]  and are willing to try to force down our throat
[3:28:47.560 --> 3:28:50.560]  a further erosion of American liberty
[3:28:50.560 --> 3:28:52.560]  I noticed, Dr. Smith
[3:28:52.560 --> 3:28:54.560]  even with the
[3:28:54.560 --> 3:28:59.560]  decimation of our government run school system
[3:28:59.560 --> 3:29:02.560]  I think the American people
[3:29:02.560 --> 3:29:04.560]  are showing
[3:29:04.560 --> 3:29:06.560]  a human common sense
[3:29:06.560 --> 3:29:08.560]  and saying hey this isn't going to work
[3:29:08.560 --> 3:29:11.560]  it never has and it won't work in the future
[3:29:11.560 --> 3:29:12.560]  and let's fix it
[3:29:12.560 --> 3:29:15.560]  so we'll just have to continue to see
[3:29:15.560 --> 3:29:17.560]  if that common sense will prevail
[3:29:17.560 --> 3:29:19.560]  well how obvious is it
[3:29:19.560 --> 3:29:22.560]  that all these other countries don't have to make carbon cuts
[3:29:22.560 --> 3:29:24.560]  I mean even if you believe in global warming
[3:29:24.560 --> 3:29:25.560]  and carbon dioxide is deadly
[3:29:25.560 --> 3:29:27.560]  which is ridiculous
[3:29:27.560 --> 3:29:29.560]  they're trying to list it as a toxic waste
[3:29:29.560 --> 3:29:31.560]  if we make the cuts
[3:29:31.560 --> 3:29:34.560]  the businesses will just move to China and India and Mexico
[3:29:34.560 --> 3:29:36.560]  and it'll boost carbon
[3:29:36.560 --> 3:29:38.560]  it's just ridiculous any way you slice it
[3:29:38.560 --> 3:29:40.560]  I want to get your take on that Dr. Smith
[3:29:40.560 --> 3:29:42.560]  Apollo astronaut on the other side
[3:29:42.560 --> 3:29:44.560]  and we'll get into space technology
[3:29:44.560 --> 3:29:45.560]  should we go to the moon
[3:29:45.560 --> 3:29:46.560]  go to Mars
[3:29:46.560 --> 3:29:47.560]  what's next
[3:29:47.560 --> 3:29:49.560]  why haven't we gone back in 40 years
[3:29:49.560 --> 3:29:51.560]  stay with us
[3:29:51.560 --> 3:29:53.560]  we're on the march
[3:29:53.560 --> 3:29:55.560]  the empire's on the run
[3:29:55.560 --> 3:29:59.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[3:30:01.560 --> 3:30:03.560]  hello friends this is Alex Jones
[3:30:03.560 --> 3:30:04.560]  I've told you for a long time
[3:30:04.560 --> 3:30:05.560]  it's important to be self-sufficient
[3:30:05.560 --> 3:30:07.560]  and today that's more important than ever
[3:30:07.560 --> 3:30:08.560]  we need to be independent
[3:30:08.560 --> 3:30:10.560]  and food and water is the key
[3:30:10.560 --> 3:30:12.560]  you'll never have to stand in a bread line
[3:30:12.560 --> 3:30:13.560]  or you have your own bread
[3:30:13.560 --> 3:30:15.560]  you'll never have to go to the super-dome
[3:30:15.560 --> 3:30:17.560]  and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[3:30:17.560 --> 3:30:18.560]  in any emergency
[3:30:18.560 --> 3:30:19.560]  if you simply prepare
[3:30:19.560 --> 3:30:21.560]  no one is going to take care of your family
[3:30:21.560 --> 3:30:22.560]  in the final equation but you

[3:33:06.560 --> 3:33:08.560]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[3:33:08.560 --> 3:33:10.560]  central standard time we're here
[3:33:10.560 --> 3:33:12.560]  I come back Sundays abbreviated live show
[3:33:12.560 --> 3:33:15.560]  4 to 6 p.m. central standard time
[3:33:15.560 --> 3:33:18.560]  and parts of the show are reared on XM radio
[3:33:18.560 --> 3:33:21.560]  and a lot of other AM and FM affiliates across the country
[3:33:21.560 --> 3:33:24.560]  we're very thankful to all those great affiliates out there
[3:33:24.560 --> 3:33:28.560]  we're talking to Harrison Hagan Schmidt or Jack Smith
[3:33:28.560 --> 3:33:31.560]  is an American geologist, former NASA astronaut
[3:33:31.560 --> 3:33:33.560]  university professor and former U.S. senator
[3:33:33.560 --> 3:33:36.560]  he is the last of the Apollo astronauts to arrive
[3:33:36.560 --> 3:33:38.560]  and set foot on the moon
[3:33:38.560 --> 3:33:41.560]  and he is also the first and so far only person
[3:33:41.560 --> 3:33:44.560]  who have walked on the moon who has never been a member
[3:33:44.560 --> 3:33:46.560]  of the United States Armed Forces
[3:33:46.560 --> 3:33:48.560]  Neil Armstrong left military service
[3:33:48.560 --> 3:33:50.560]  and it just goes through some of that trivia
[3:33:50.560 --> 3:33:52.560]  and he's got a book returned to the moon
[3:33:52.560 --> 3:33:55.560]  screen in the human settlement of space
[3:33:55.560 --> 3:33:58.560]  return to the moon is the name of the book
[3:33:58.560 --> 3:34:01.560]  you can find it in Amazon and bookstores everywhere
[3:34:01.560 --> 3:34:03.560]  in fact I've even seen it in the bookstore
[3:34:03.560 --> 3:34:05.560]  I've even seen it in my dad's house
[3:34:05.560 --> 3:34:08.560]  but the point is great book be sure and get that
[3:34:08.560 --> 3:34:12.560]  just modify one thing you said
[3:34:12.560 --> 3:34:17.560]  I was the only non-military trained pilot
[3:34:17.560 --> 3:34:20.560]  to go to the moon
[3:34:20.560 --> 3:34:23.560]  but I did receive outstanding training
[3:34:23.560 --> 3:34:26.560]  the United States Air Force in jet aircraft
[3:34:26.560 --> 3:34:28.560]  in the United States Navy and helicopters
[3:34:28.560 --> 3:34:31.560]  so I feel like I sort of had the best of all world
[3:34:31.560 --> 3:34:33.560]  well there you go I keep telling my guys
[3:34:33.560 --> 3:34:35.560]  don't print me Wikipedia stuff
[3:34:35.560 --> 3:34:38.560]  because Wikipedia's got my name spelled wrong
[3:34:38.560 --> 3:34:40.560]  and half of it's not true about me
[3:34:40.560 --> 3:34:43.560]  I hope your audience recognizes that Wikipedia
[3:34:43.560 --> 3:34:45.560]  has their biases as well
[3:34:45.560 --> 3:34:48.560]  trying to get anything in there to
[3:34:48.560 --> 3:34:51.560]  moderate their position on climate change
[3:34:51.560 --> 3:34:53.560]  is impossible a number of people have tried to do it
[3:34:53.560 --> 3:34:55.560]  and it just doesn't happen
[3:34:55.560 --> 3:34:58.560]  I was just joking too it's actually not from Wikipedia
[3:34:58.560 --> 3:35:01.560]  the guys are about to box me in the nose in there
[3:35:01.560 --> 3:35:03.560]  yeah Wikipedia won't let you publish
[3:35:03.560 --> 3:35:05.560]  I've talked to scientists who've tried
[3:35:05.560 --> 3:35:08.560]  any material basically trying to debunk
[3:35:08.560 --> 3:35:11.560]  manmade global warming in just one case I found
[3:35:11.560 --> 3:35:15.560]  and it's just despicable
[3:35:15.560 --> 3:35:17.560]  because they're the first thing that comes up
[3:35:17.560 --> 3:35:19.560]  with almost any scientific inquiry
[3:35:19.560 --> 3:35:21.560]  have you noticed that doctor?
[3:35:21.560 --> 3:35:22.560]  yep
[3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:25.560]  yeah it's even well Google's in that
[3:35:25.560 --> 3:35:27.560]  game as well you know
[3:35:27.560 --> 3:35:30.560]  the head of Google has a very close relationship
[3:35:30.560 --> 3:35:32.560]  with the president
[3:35:32.560 --> 3:35:34.560]  I have seen that
[3:35:34.560 --> 3:35:36.560]  now I want to get a little bit more
[3:35:36.560 --> 3:35:38.560]  into the environmental movement and then into the moon
[3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:40.560]  the time we have left with you and also healthcare
[3:35:40.560 --> 3:35:43.560]  but dealing with Holdren's book
[3:35:43.560 --> 3:35:45.560]  and all these other books written by people
[3:35:45.560 --> 3:35:47.560]  that just cram the universities
[3:35:47.560 --> 3:35:51.560]  and academia and social planning
[3:35:51.560 --> 3:35:54.560]  this talk about the world being overpopulated
[3:35:54.560 --> 3:35:56.560]  when the west is actually as you know
[3:35:56.560 --> 3:36:00.560]  has a huge decline in its actual indigenous numbers
[3:36:00.560 --> 3:36:03.560]  and dealing with this whole eugenics movement
[3:36:03.560 --> 3:36:06.560]  this whole idea of the super race
[3:36:06.560 --> 3:36:08.560]  I can't think of anybody out there who would be
[3:36:08.560 --> 3:36:11.560]  the archetypal superman
[3:36:11.560 --> 3:36:14.560]  if it isn't the astronauts
[3:36:14.560 --> 3:36:16.560]  did they ever talk to you guys
[3:36:16.560 --> 3:36:18.560]  about this type of stuff
[3:36:18.560 --> 3:36:20.560]  or when you were in the U.S. Senate
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:22.560]  you said it seems to be building more steam now
[3:36:22.560 --> 3:36:24.560]  Holdren and these guys are talking about
[3:36:24.560 --> 3:36:26.560]  forced abortions
[3:36:26.560 --> 3:36:29.560]  just this whole move towards eugenics
[3:36:29.560 --> 3:36:31.560]  are you concerned about that?
[3:36:31.560 --> 3:36:36.560]  well I'm concerned about any movement
[3:36:36.560 --> 3:36:38.560]  that might have legs to it
[3:36:38.560 --> 3:36:40.560]  but I really think
[3:36:40.560 --> 3:36:43.560]  it is more visible now
[3:36:43.560 --> 3:36:48.560]  because the people who think this way
[3:36:48.560 --> 3:36:50.560]  have gained power
[3:36:50.560 --> 3:36:54.560]  it does not mean that they are going to be supported
[3:36:54.560 --> 3:36:57.560]  by the vast majority of the American people
[3:36:57.560 --> 3:37:00.560]  I just think you have to continue as the founders did
[3:37:00.560 --> 3:37:03.560]  to put your faith in the people
[3:37:03.560 --> 3:37:05.560]  and in their common sense
[3:37:05.560 --> 3:37:07.560]  now thanks to talk radio
[3:37:07.560 --> 3:37:10.560]  they are getting some education
[3:37:10.560 --> 3:37:13.560]  that they would not have gotten otherwise
[3:37:13.560 --> 3:37:16.560]  and it is up to you guys to expand your market
[3:37:16.560 --> 3:37:19.560]  and to make sure that the American people
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:21.560]  overall begin to understand
[3:37:21.560 --> 3:37:24.560]  why their common sense is what they should rely on
[3:37:24.560 --> 3:37:27.560]  and not on what they are told by the national media
[3:37:27.560 --> 3:37:29.560]  the state run media
[3:37:29.560 --> 3:37:33.560]  now I think the whole friend
[3:37:33.560 --> 3:37:39.560]  really began with the fall of the Soviet Union
[3:37:39.560 --> 3:37:45.560]  because the great champion of the fall of liberty
[3:37:45.560 --> 3:37:47.560]  namely communism
[3:37:47.560 --> 3:37:51.560]  had to find some other place to go
[3:37:51.560 --> 3:37:54.560]  and they basically went into the environmental movement
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:37:57.560]  now that is not to say there are major
[3:37:57.560 --> 3:37:59.560]  significant environmental issues
[3:37:59.560 --> 3:38:01.560]  particularly at the local level
[3:38:01.560 --> 3:38:06.560]  but they converted environmental activism
[3:38:06.560 --> 3:38:09.560]  to a political movement
[3:38:09.560 --> 3:38:11.560]  and some would say a religious movement
[3:38:11.560 --> 3:38:14.560]  and really what these are is parasites
[3:38:14.560 --> 3:38:16.560]  I mean they want to organize their lives
[3:38:16.560 --> 3:38:17.560]  they want to run our lives
[3:38:17.560 --> 3:38:19.560]  I will never forget back in the mid 90s
[3:38:19.560 --> 3:38:21.560]  they were stealing farmers and ranchers land
[3:38:21.560 --> 3:38:22.560]  in and around Austin
[3:38:22.560 --> 3:38:24.560]  in the name of environmentalism
[3:38:24.560 --> 3:38:26.560]  they later built on it and sold it to themselves
[3:38:26.560 --> 3:38:28.560]  they were just bank robbers, criminals
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:30.560]  and I remember being in a meeting with the city council advisers
[3:38:30.560 --> 3:38:32.560]  and I said this isn't freedom
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:34.560]  and they said everything is a planned economy
[3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:36.560]  you know somebody's got to do it
[3:38:36.560 --> 3:38:39.560]  I mean they really think it's their job to run our lives
[3:38:39.560 --> 3:38:42.560]  how do we beat the forces of tyranny?
[3:38:42.560 --> 3:38:44.560]  well you have to do it by education
[3:38:44.560 --> 3:38:47.560]  and by reminding the American people
[3:38:47.560 --> 3:38:50.560]  that their basic common sense instincts
[3:38:50.560 --> 3:38:52.560]  are correct
[3:38:52.560 --> 3:38:55.560]  their own private property is important
[3:38:55.560 --> 3:38:57.560]  their incomes are important
[3:38:57.560 --> 3:39:00.560]  and they should not transfer that to the government
[3:39:00.560 --> 3:39:05.560]  their first chance to express themselves
[3:39:05.560 --> 3:39:09.560]  politically is coming up in the next congressional election
[3:39:09.560 --> 3:39:15.560]  you all and all of us have to try to mobilize
[3:39:15.560 --> 3:39:18.560]  the most massive turnout
[3:39:18.560 --> 3:39:21.560]  of people who reject this current approach
[3:39:21.560 --> 3:39:23.560]  and begin to turn it around
[3:39:23.560 --> 3:39:26.560]  and get back to what would be
[3:39:26.560 --> 3:39:28.560]  the basic fundamental principles
[3:39:28.560 --> 3:39:30.560]  of constitutional government
[3:39:30.560 --> 3:39:32.560]  that we were founded upon
[3:39:32.560 --> 3:39:34.560]  well I noticed you mentioned
[3:39:34.560 --> 3:39:36.560]  the last few administrations
[3:39:36.560 --> 3:39:38.560]  being a problem
[3:39:38.560 --> 3:39:40.560]  and so I'm glad you're recognizing obviously
[3:39:40.560 --> 3:39:43.560]  that both parties are run by these special interests
[3:39:43.560 --> 3:39:46.560]  why would big wealthy interests
[3:39:46.560 --> 3:39:48.560]  want to collectivize things
[3:39:48.560 --> 3:39:50.560]  is that because it creates monopolies
[3:39:50.560 --> 3:39:52.560]  allows them to shut down their competition
[3:39:52.560 --> 3:39:54.560]  I mean it's not just a bunch of hippies
[3:39:54.560 --> 3:39:56.560]  and communists running around that are doing this
[3:39:56.560 --> 3:39:58.560]  you've got a lot of powerful friends
[3:39:58.560 --> 3:40:00.560]  well there's no question
[3:40:00.560 --> 3:40:05.560]  there's a lot of money influenced in this process
[3:40:05.560 --> 3:40:10.560]  and I don't know what's motivating people
[3:40:10.560 --> 3:40:14.560]  who have basically been dependent
[3:40:14.560 --> 3:40:16.560]  on a free enterprise system
[3:40:16.560 --> 3:40:18.560]  to get where they are today
[3:40:18.560 --> 3:40:21.560]  clearly small business, medium-sized business
[3:40:21.560 --> 3:40:23.560]  the kind of business that I'm involved in
[3:40:23.560 --> 3:40:25.560]  in various ways
[3:40:25.560 --> 3:40:27.560]  that operate that way
[3:40:27.560 --> 3:40:30.560]  but there are particularly in the media
[3:40:30.560 --> 3:40:32.560]  an entertainment world
[3:40:32.560 --> 3:40:34.560]  major corporations
[3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:37.560]  who have bought into
[3:40:37.560 --> 3:40:41.560]  and believe that their future is going to be
[3:40:41.560 --> 3:40:44.560]  tied to their economic future
[3:40:44.560 --> 3:40:46.560]  tied to this approach
[3:40:46.560 --> 3:40:48.560]  to attacking liberty
[3:40:48.560 --> 3:40:52.560]  and to building a more socialistic approach
[3:40:52.560 --> 3:40:56.560]  to providing for the needs of the American people
[3:40:56.560 --> 3:40:59.560]  that is a very dangerous trend
[3:40:59.560 --> 3:41:01.560]  there's no question about it
[3:41:01.560 --> 3:41:04.560]  made it even worse by the way
[3:41:04.560 --> 3:41:06.560]  we've allowed the Congress
[3:41:06.560 --> 3:41:11.560]  not only to become permanent fixtures
[3:41:11.560 --> 3:41:13.560]  very few congressmen and senators
[3:41:13.560 --> 3:41:16.560]  if they run for reelection ever get defeated
[3:41:16.560 --> 3:41:18.560]  and that's in large part
[3:41:18.560 --> 3:41:21.560]  because the federal election law
[3:41:21.560 --> 3:41:25.560]  has been biased
[3:41:25.560 --> 3:41:27.560]  towards the incumbent
[3:41:27.560 --> 3:41:29.560]  and now we've even seen
[3:41:29.560 --> 3:41:33.560]  that George Bush really made a major tactical error
[3:41:33.560 --> 3:41:37.560]  but we've seen that the federal election law
[3:41:37.560 --> 3:41:41.560]  now permits an attack on political speech
[3:41:41.560 --> 3:41:43.560]  before each election
[3:41:43.560 --> 3:41:47.560]  by restricting independent advertising
[3:41:47.560 --> 3:41:51.560]  so Dr. Schmidt, Apollo astronaut
[3:41:51.560 --> 3:41:53.560]  Apollo 18 astronaut
[3:41:53.560 --> 3:41:57.560]  I'm sure you've probably seen the cyber bullying act
[3:41:57.560 --> 3:41:59.560]  I've even got local newscast pushing it now
[3:41:59.560 --> 3:42:01.560]  the press is that bad
[3:42:01.560 --> 3:42:03.560]  the hate crimes act
[3:42:03.560 --> 3:42:07.560]  it now says if your speech causes someone to do something violent
[3:42:07.560 --> 3:42:09.560]  even if you're not calling for violence
[3:42:09.560 --> 3:42:11.560]  they're going to come arrest you
[3:42:11.560 --> 3:42:14.560]  and now the FBI is fluttering around saying
[3:42:14.560 --> 3:42:16.560]  if somebody makes a comment on a message board that shares
[3:42:16.560 --> 3:42:19.560]  we may come after you for what they said
[3:42:19.560 --> 3:42:22.560]  I mean this is really happening to people
[3:42:22.560 --> 3:42:24.560]  I know
[3:42:24.560 --> 3:42:28.560]  well that's why we've got to make a change of direction
[3:42:28.560 --> 3:42:31.560]  in the United States government a drastic change
[3:42:31.560 --> 3:42:37.560]  and as I say the next election is a key turning point
[3:42:37.560 --> 3:42:40.560]  the next two elections are particularly key
[3:42:40.560 --> 3:42:44.560]  if the powers that are currently in Washington
[3:42:44.560 --> 3:42:47.560]  maintain their control
[3:42:47.560 --> 3:42:49.560]  through this next election
[3:42:49.560 --> 3:42:51.560]  at the next two elections
[3:42:51.560 --> 3:42:54.560]  then I'm not sure how you turn it around
[3:42:54.560 --> 3:42:57.560]  okay in the 16 minutes or so we have left
[3:42:57.560 --> 3:42:59.560]  I want to shift gears now
[3:42:59.560 --> 3:43:01.560]  and get into the moon
[3:43:01.560 --> 3:43:04.560]  return to the moon and it has that really great other headline here
[3:43:04.560 --> 3:43:06.560]  about colonizing
[3:43:06.560 --> 3:43:09.560]  in fact guys put that up on screen for the TV viewers
[3:43:09.560 --> 3:43:11.560]  I don't think you use that word
[3:43:11.560 --> 3:43:13.560]  I think I use peddling
[3:43:13.560 --> 3:43:15.560]  I wanted to put it up on the screen so I can actually
[3:43:15.560 --> 3:43:16.560]  there it is
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:18.560]  the human settlement of space return to the moon
[3:43:18.560 --> 3:43:21.560]  tell us what that headline means for the book
[3:43:21.560 --> 3:43:28.560]  well the moon is the nearest place in space
[3:43:28.560 --> 3:43:31.560]  where human beings can homestead
[3:43:31.560 --> 3:43:35.560]  the resources are there to want to establish
[3:43:35.560 --> 3:43:37.560]  settlements are established
[3:43:37.560 --> 3:43:39.560]  the resources are there
[3:43:39.560 --> 3:43:41.560]  not only to support those settlements
[3:43:41.560 --> 3:43:44.560]  with the water and oxygen and food
[3:43:44.560 --> 3:43:46.560]  and other things that you need
[3:43:46.560 --> 3:43:49.560]  independently of the earth
[3:43:49.560 --> 3:43:53.560]  but there is one resource that's there
[3:43:53.560 --> 3:43:56.560]  that allows for an economy
[3:43:56.560 --> 3:43:59.560]  that can
[3:43:59.560 --> 3:44:01.560]  through the export of that resource
[3:44:01.560 --> 3:44:04.560]  to the earth and that's a light isotope of helium
[3:44:04.560 --> 3:44:06.560]  called helium-3
[3:44:06.560 --> 3:44:10.560]  which is a nearly ideal fuel for fusion power generation
[3:44:10.560 --> 3:44:13.560]  and so that's what the book is all about
[3:44:13.560 --> 3:44:17.560]  it's price to put together in a very very broad way
[3:44:17.560 --> 3:44:20.560]  the beginnings of a plan
[3:44:20.560 --> 3:44:24.560]  for the private sector to initiate the settlement of the moon
[3:44:24.560 --> 3:44:28.560]  and to provide the earth with a major new energy resource
[3:44:28.560 --> 3:44:30.560]  amazing
[3:44:30.560 --> 3:44:33.560]  now just because your bio is so lengthy
[3:44:33.560 --> 3:44:36.560]  in a nutshell tell us about your career
[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:40.560]  as a AAA astronaut
[3:44:40.560 --> 3:44:42.560]  lunar astronaut
[3:44:42.560 --> 3:44:43.560]  tell us about that
[3:44:43.560 --> 3:44:44.560]  tell us about the missions
[3:44:44.560 --> 3:44:47.560]  just in a nutshell and I've got some questions
[3:44:47.560 --> 3:44:52.560]  well my career started as a geologist
[3:44:52.560 --> 3:44:55.560]  the son of a geologist actually
[3:44:55.560 --> 3:44:58.560]  in southern New Mexico
[3:44:58.560 --> 3:45:01.560]  Caltech train and then a Harvard PhD
[3:45:01.560 --> 3:45:04.560]  I did a lot of field work in Norway and Alaska
[3:45:04.560 --> 3:45:07.560]  and when NASA and the National Academy of Sciences
[3:45:07.560 --> 3:45:10.560]  asked for volunteers for the first selection
[3:45:10.560 --> 3:45:12.560]  of scientist astronauts
[3:45:12.560 --> 3:45:15.560]  I thought about 10 seconds and raised my hand
[3:45:15.560 --> 3:45:18.560]  and I figured that if I didn't
[3:45:18.560 --> 3:45:21.560]  I'd probably regret it and I would have obviously
[3:45:21.560 --> 3:45:26.560]  but while at Harvard I became increasingly
[3:45:26.560 --> 3:45:29.560]  concerned about the direction that Harvard trained
[3:45:29.560 --> 3:45:32.560]  public so-called public servants
[3:45:32.560 --> 3:45:35.560]  were taking us and figured that if I was
[3:45:35.560 --> 3:45:37.560]  that concerned that sometime in my life
[3:45:37.560 --> 3:45:40.560]  I'd better think about getting into politics
[3:45:40.560 --> 3:45:43.560]  that opportunity came after my astronaut career
[3:45:43.560 --> 3:45:46.560]  had essentially been completed
[3:45:46.560 --> 3:45:49.560]  and I was elected the United States Senate
[3:45:49.560 --> 3:45:52.560]  six years there learning a great deal about
[3:45:52.560 --> 3:45:55.560]  how sausage is made
[3:45:55.560 --> 3:45:58.560]  more than most people would like to know I think
[3:45:58.560 --> 3:46:03.560]  and then in the middle of the depression
[3:46:03.560 --> 3:46:06.560]  of the recession of 1982
[3:46:06.560 --> 3:46:11.560]  I lost my feet here in New Mexico
[3:46:11.560 --> 3:46:17.560]  and went into an accelerated learning experience
[3:46:17.560 --> 3:46:20.560]  in the private sector and free enterprise
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:23.560]  and business related activities
[3:46:23.560 --> 3:46:25.560]  well that's awesome and again the book
[3:46:25.560 --> 3:46:28.560]  is returned to the moon available everywhere
[3:46:28.560 --> 3:46:29.560]  Harrison Smith is our guest
[3:46:29.560 --> 3:46:32.560]  how many moon missions were you involved in in total
[3:46:32.560 --> 3:46:35.560]  well I was involved in essentially all the moon missions
[3:46:35.560 --> 3:46:39.560]  but I only flew on Apollo 17
[3:46:39.560 --> 3:46:42.560]  the last of the Apollo series
[3:46:42.560 --> 3:46:46.560]  my involvement in other missions was
[3:46:46.560 --> 3:46:50.560]  multifaceted I was primarily responsible
[3:46:50.560 --> 3:46:54.560]  for setting up the lunar science
[3:46:54.560 --> 3:46:57.560]  and field geological science training program
[3:46:57.560 --> 3:46:59.560]  for the pilot astronauts
[3:46:59.560 --> 3:47:03.560]  I was responsible for overseeing for the astronaut office
[3:47:03.560 --> 3:47:07.560]  the development of various scientific experiments
[3:47:07.560 --> 3:47:12.560]  and storage of the decent stage of the lunar module
[3:47:12.560 --> 3:47:15.560]  and you also discovered a lot of the most important rocks
[3:47:15.560 --> 3:47:18.560]  which mission put that laser up
[3:47:18.560 --> 3:47:22.560]  that the University of Texas contacts
[3:47:22.560 --> 3:47:25.560]  but was actually deployed on the moon
[3:47:25.560 --> 3:47:26.560]  three different times
[3:47:26.560 --> 3:47:29.560]  the first one by Apollo 11 is a matter of fact
[3:47:29.560 --> 3:47:33.560]  40 years ago was a reflector
[3:47:33.560 --> 3:47:39.560]  and the various observatories now shoot that
[3:47:39.560 --> 3:47:41.560]  those reflectors the three of them
[3:47:41.560 --> 3:47:44.560]  that were finally deployed with the laser beams
[3:47:44.560 --> 3:47:49.560]  and have been able to very very precisely determine
[3:47:49.560 --> 3:47:52.560]  the distance from the earth to the moon
[3:47:52.560 --> 3:47:55.560]  as well as the motions of the continent
[3:47:55.560 --> 3:47:57.560]  all right we're running down on time
[3:47:57.560 --> 3:47:59.560]  and you've agreed to come back on in the future
[3:47:59.560 --> 3:48:01.560]  on science issues it's just amazing having you
[3:48:01.560 --> 3:48:03.560]  but I will be broiled and skewered
[3:48:03.560 --> 3:48:06.560]  and drawn and quartered and hung
[3:48:06.560 --> 3:48:09.560]  and then tanned if I don't bring this up
[3:48:09.560 --> 3:48:11.560]  because we talk about hoaxes
[3:48:11.560 --> 3:48:13.560]  we have this giant government hoax
[3:48:13.560 --> 3:48:15.560]  of global warming right now
[3:48:15.560 --> 3:48:17.560]  clearly trying to get control
[3:48:17.560 --> 3:48:19.560]  before I ask this I want to say
[3:48:19.560 --> 3:48:21.560]  I have a friend Raymond Teague who worked on the main
[3:48:21.560 --> 3:48:23.560]  mission control on repeated Apollo's
[3:48:23.560 --> 3:48:27.560]  ran RCA cameras and then RCA cameras on Skylab
[3:48:27.560 --> 3:48:30.560]  and I've known Raymond for 14 years
[3:48:30.560 --> 3:48:32.560]  and he says the whole thing's real
[3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:35.560]  none of it's faked you know the whole nine yards
[3:48:35.560 --> 3:48:37.560]  and I know he's the real deal
[3:48:37.560 --> 3:48:39.560]  I have other people I know being here in Texas
[3:48:39.560 --> 3:48:41.560]  who worked on the mission and they say
[3:48:41.560 --> 3:48:43.560]  if there was any chicanery then they were conning us too
[3:48:43.560 --> 3:48:45.560]  and that's pretty darn hard to do
[3:48:45.560 --> 3:48:48.560]  40 years later and I never really covered this issue
[3:48:48.560 --> 3:48:50.560]  but I get calls every day emails about it
[3:48:50.560 --> 3:48:53.560]  TV shows everywhere what is your take
[3:48:53.560 --> 3:48:58.560]  on the people more and more believing
[3:48:58.560 --> 3:49:00.560]  I've seen polls as high as 30%
[3:49:00.560 --> 3:49:03.560]  that aspects of the whole thing was faked
[3:49:03.560 --> 3:49:06.560]  well I think in a serious vein
[3:49:06.560 --> 3:49:10.560]  it is another reflection on the government run schools
[3:49:10.560 --> 3:49:13.560]  that system does not teach history
[3:49:13.560 --> 3:49:17.560]  there are several generations now who have come through it
[3:49:17.560 --> 3:49:20.560]  that have had very little exposure to American history
[3:49:20.560 --> 3:49:23.560]  or world history in an objective way
[3:49:23.560 --> 3:49:27.560]  and it's just right now you have a population
[3:49:27.560 --> 3:49:33.560]  that has not learned the complexities
[3:49:33.560 --> 3:49:35.560]  that had to be dealt with in order to put
[3:49:35.560 --> 3:49:37.560]  human beings on the moon
[3:49:37.560 --> 3:49:42.560]  also you have people who just for their own
[3:49:42.560 --> 3:49:46.560]  enjoyment I guess
[3:49:46.560 --> 3:49:50.560]  like to talk about conspiracy
[3:49:50.560 --> 3:49:53.560]  and then finally unfortunately
[3:49:53.560 --> 3:49:56.560]  a lot of people don't trust their government anymore
[3:49:56.560 --> 3:49:59.560]  but in a way that's a positive thing
[3:49:59.560 --> 3:50:02.560]  to not be totally trusting the founders said that
[3:50:02.560 --> 3:50:05.560]  I think a lot of it is so much government lying
[3:50:05.560 --> 3:50:07.560]  people are so untrusting now they don't even trust me
[3:50:07.560 --> 3:50:08.560]  on a lot of issues
[3:50:08.560 --> 3:50:10.560]  I mean people don't trust their neighbors
[3:50:10.560 --> 3:50:14.560]  and society does seem to be degenerating a bit
[3:50:14.560 --> 3:50:17.560]  my only issue is that said that I know people
[3:50:17.560 --> 3:50:19.560]  that worked on the mission who say it was absolutely real
[3:50:19.560 --> 3:50:22.560]  and you can watch famous films of them in Mission Control
[3:50:22.560 --> 3:50:24.560]  people I know they're not making it up
[3:50:24.560 --> 3:50:28.560]  for a conspiracy like that to work
[3:50:28.560 --> 3:50:33.560]  you would have to have a con 450,000 Americans
[3:50:33.560 --> 3:50:36.560]  because that's how many worked on the program
[3:50:36.560 --> 3:50:39.560]  look people have to remember
[3:50:39.560 --> 3:50:43.560]  that they're still when you have a population of the world
[3:50:43.560 --> 3:50:47.560]  as large as we have a very, very micro percentage
[3:50:47.560 --> 3:50:49.560]  it's still a significant number
[3:50:49.560 --> 3:50:52.560]  and some of those people actually still believe the earth is flat
[3:50:52.560 --> 3:50:56.560]  so if a few of them want to believe that we didn't go to the moon
[3:50:56.560 --> 3:50:57.560]  let them
[3:50:57.560 --> 3:51:00.560]  it's not an issue that comes up in my presentation
[3:51:00.560 --> 3:51:03.560]  well I mean the earth being flat
[3:51:03.560 --> 3:51:05.560]  that's clearly ridiculous
[3:51:05.560 --> 3:51:07.560]  though I've actually been contacted by some flat arthers
[3:51:07.560 --> 3:51:11.560]  saying I'm covering up the fact that it's some Atlantean conspiracy
[3:51:11.560 --> 3:51:15.560]  but the reason I mean obviously you know this has been building
[3:51:15.560 --> 3:51:17.560]  I would imagine you get asked that sometimes
[3:51:17.560 --> 3:51:21.560]  because there are issues that make people question
[3:51:21.560 --> 3:51:24.560]  and so let me just throw a few of those out to you
[3:51:24.560 --> 3:51:26.560]  wait a minute
[3:51:26.560 --> 3:51:29.560]  I think there are more important things to talk about
[3:51:29.560 --> 3:51:31.560]  but just let me say that when I'm out talking to the public
[3:51:31.560 --> 3:51:33.560]  I do not get that question
[3:51:33.560 --> 3:51:36.560]  I only get that question when talk shows
[3:51:36.560 --> 3:51:39.560]  okay well that's true
[3:51:39.560 --> 3:51:42.560]  and so I think we ought to spend our time on more important issues
[3:51:42.560 --> 3:51:48.560]  okay why haven't we been back to the moon in 40 years
[3:51:48.560 --> 3:51:51.560]  well that's a really long topic
[3:51:51.560 --> 3:51:54.560]  but the most immediate is that
[3:51:54.560 --> 3:51:57.560]  even though George Bush, George W. Bush
[3:51:57.560 --> 3:52:01.560]  articulated a very good return to the moon and on
[3:52:01.560 --> 3:52:04.560]  beyond policy
[3:52:04.560 --> 3:52:07.560]  neither his budget office
[3:52:07.560 --> 3:52:10.560]  or the Congress properly funded that
[3:52:10.560 --> 3:52:12.560]  had it been properly funded
[3:52:12.560 --> 3:52:15.560]  we would be well on our way as we speak
[3:52:15.560 --> 3:52:18.560]  but in the absence of adequate funding
[3:52:18.560 --> 3:52:23.560]  we have had to put schedules in order to keep the program alive
[3:52:23.560 --> 3:52:25.560]  now you have an administration that
[3:52:25.560 --> 3:52:29.560]  for all indication is not going to pursue
[3:52:29.560 --> 3:52:33.560]  a aggressive role for the United States
[3:52:33.560 --> 3:52:35.560]  in deep space
[3:52:35.560 --> 3:52:38.560]  and they're going to leave that to the Chinese
[3:52:38.560 --> 3:52:41.560]  potentially the Indians and the Japanese and maybe Europe
[3:52:41.560 --> 3:52:44.560]  and that I think is an extraordinary mistake
[3:52:44.560 --> 3:52:47.560]  it's a bigger mistake in the long term
[3:52:47.560 --> 3:52:50.560]  as we could make a relative to protecting liberty
[3:52:50.560 --> 3:52:52.560]  here on this planet
[3:52:52.560 --> 3:52:55.560]  you have non-democratic regimes
[3:52:55.560 --> 3:52:57.560]  dominant in deep space
[3:52:57.560 --> 3:52:59.560]  dominant on the moon and elsewhere
[3:52:59.560 --> 3:53:02.560]  then it's going to be very very difficult to continue to protect liberty on this
[3:53:02.560 --> 3:53:04.560]  planet
[3:53:04.560 --> 3:53:06.560]  sure have you heard of a
[3:53:06.560 --> 3:53:08.560]  I guess you were in the Senate around that time
[3:53:08.560 --> 3:53:10.560]  Dr. Bob Bowman who worked on some of the
[3:53:10.560 --> 3:53:13.560]  Star Wars program before it was declassified in the early 80s
[3:53:13.560 --> 3:53:15.560]  and he's saying
[3:53:15.560 --> 3:53:17.560]  and he's told me he said look Alex
[3:53:17.560 --> 3:53:19.560]  not only is there a space program
[3:53:19.560 --> 3:53:21.560]  but there's a lot of it you don't know about
[3:53:21.560 --> 3:53:23.560]  and I can't tell you about it
[3:53:23.560 --> 3:53:26.560]  but he's mentioned a few things that have slipped out or been declassified
[3:53:26.560 --> 3:53:28.560]  you know the whole robotic program
[3:53:28.560 --> 3:53:30.560]  and they admit that a lot of the shuttles
[3:53:30.560 --> 3:53:32.560]  have been military secret missions
[3:53:32.560 --> 3:53:34.560]  oh no
[3:53:34.560 --> 3:53:36.560]  not a lot there have been a few
[3:53:36.560 --> 3:53:38.560]  Air Force
[3:53:38.560 --> 3:53:40.560]  missions
[3:53:40.560 --> 3:53:42.560]  are missions of the space shuttle in which there were
[3:53:42.560 --> 3:53:44.560]  some classified payload
[3:53:44.560 --> 3:53:46.560]  but you shouldn't
[3:53:46.560 --> 3:53:48.560]  all the shuttle flights
[3:53:48.560 --> 3:53:50.560]  except with very few exceptions
[3:53:50.560 --> 3:53:53.560]  have been purely civilian flights
[3:53:53.560 --> 3:53:55.560]  sure you did a lot of the
[3:53:55.560 --> 3:53:57.560]  photography on the moon didn't you
[3:53:57.560 --> 3:54:00.560]  oh yeah well both Gene Sternin and I had cameras
[3:54:00.560 --> 3:54:03.560]  and we took a lot of the pictures
[3:54:03.560 --> 3:54:05.560]  I happened to be more
[3:54:05.560 --> 3:54:07.560]  active in taking pictures of the Earth
[3:54:07.560 --> 3:54:09.560]  as we went towards the moon
[3:54:09.560 --> 3:54:11.560]  and so that's the full Earth
[3:54:11.560 --> 3:54:13.560]  but you took the famous blue marble photo didn't you
[3:54:13.560 --> 3:54:15.560]  the full Earth that chose the continent of Africa
[3:54:15.560 --> 3:54:17.560]  in its entirety yeah that's what I took
[3:54:17.560 --> 3:54:20.560]  I was about 34,000 miles away from Earth
[3:54:20.560 --> 3:54:22.560]  when I spent that
[3:54:22.560 --> 3:54:24.560]  now again
[3:54:24.560 --> 3:54:26.560]  because people kill me that don't ask
[3:54:26.560 --> 3:54:28.560]  where are the stars is it because the moon's
[3:54:28.560 --> 3:54:30.560]  the Earth's so bright
[3:54:30.560 --> 3:54:32.560]  that it blots those out
[3:54:32.560 --> 3:54:34.560]  yeah it's the same problem you have on a
[3:54:34.560 --> 3:54:36.560]  sunny day here on Earth that's being stars
[3:54:36.560 --> 3:54:38.560]  just too much light
[3:54:38.560 --> 3:54:40.560]  for a wonderful optical system
[3:54:40.560 --> 3:54:42.560]  we call our eyes
[3:54:42.560 --> 3:54:44.560]  to handle
[3:54:44.560 --> 3:54:46.560]  the eyes are great but they do not have
[3:54:46.560 --> 3:54:48.560]  what scientists call the dynamic range
[3:54:48.560 --> 3:54:50.560]  to see both the bright surfaces
[3:54:50.560 --> 3:54:52.560]  and stars
[3:54:52.560 --> 3:54:54.560]  well that's like when the moon is
[3:54:54.560 --> 3:54:56.560]  up at night
[3:54:56.560 --> 3:54:58.560]  you can't see stars anywhere around it right
[3:54:58.560 --> 3:55:00.560]  that's correct same thing the moon
[3:55:00.560 --> 3:55:02.560]  just dominates
[3:55:02.560 --> 3:55:04.560]  the eye and the eye
[3:55:04.560 --> 3:55:06.560]  doesn't close down enough
[3:55:06.560 --> 3:55:08.560]  doesn't close the iris enough to see the stars
[3:55:10.560 --> 3:55:12.560]  well I know we've got advanced technologies
[3:55:12.560 --> 3:55:14.560]  and I know the A-bomb and the hydrogen bomb
[3:55:14.560 --> 3:55:16.560]  and the superconducting super colliders
[3:55:16.560 --> 3:55:18.560]  are real and I know
[3:55:18.560 --> 3:55:20.560]  that there are some
[3:55:20.560 --> 3:55:22.560]  space plane programs even if
[3:55:22.560 --> 3:55:24.560]  you say there aren't a Dr.
[3:55:24.560 --> 3:55:26.560]  Schmidt that are going on
[3:55:26.560 --> 3:55:28.560]  and so that's why
[3:55:28.560 --> 3:55:30.560]  I believe in our potential
[3:55:30.560 --> 3:55:32.560]  and I want to believe we want to the moon and I believe you
[3:55:32.560 --> 3:55:34.560]  you know when you sit here
[3:55:34.560 --> 3:55:36.560]  you sound very credible to me I just
[3:55:36.560 --> 3:55:38.560]  you say you don't get asked this on the street people are probably scared to ask you
[3:55:38.560 --> 3:55:40.560]  I mean I'm sure you've seen
[3:55:40.560 --> 3:55:42.560]  all over the news
[3:55:42.560 --> 3:55:44.560]  American people are never scared to ask anybody
[3:55:44.560 --> 3:55:46.560]  a question
[3:55:46.560 --> 3:55:48.560]  believe me
[3:55:48.560 --> 3:55:50.560]  well I mean certainly you know it's a big
[3:55:50.560 --> 3:55:52.560]  controversy and that's why I brought it up
[3:55:52.560 --> 3:55:54.560]  I understand
[3:55:54.560 --> 3:55:56.560]  you have to deal with it fortunately I don't
[3:55:56.560 --> 3:55:58.560]  well I mean I know
[3:55:58.560 --> 3:56:00.560]  you're right about the global warming being a hoax
[3:56:00.560 --> 3:56:02.560]  and I mean there is government
[3:56:02.560 --> 3:56:04.560]  corporations engage in a hoax so I think that's
[3:56:04.560 --> 3:56:06.560]  I mean how do we fix this crisis
[3:56:06.560 --> 3:56:08.560]  of confidence because
[3:56:08.560 --> 3:56:10.560]  it's even happening not just with the government as you know
[3:56:10.560 --> 3:56:12.560]  it's happening with people in business now
[3:56:12.560 --> 3:56:14.560]  how do we fix that
[3:56:14.560 --> 3:56:16.560]  well I think
[3:56:16.560 --> 3:56:18.560]  you fix it by
[3:56:18.560 --> 3:56:20.560]  people of common sense taking
[3:56:20.560 --> 3:56:22.560]  back control of their government and making them right
[3:56:22.560 --> 3:56:24.560]  and getting good people
[3:56:24.560 --> 3:56:26.560]  to run their office
[3:56:26.560 --> 3:56:28.560]  I personally would like to see term limit
[3:56:28.560 --> 3:56:30.560]  but you're never going to get the congress to do it
[3:56:30.560 --> 3:56:32.560]  that's something the states are going to have to do
[3:56:32.560 --> 3:56:34.560]  if we're ever going to have a constitutional
[3:56:34.560 --> 3:56:36.560]  amendment the founders
[3:56:36.560 --> 3:56:38.560]  just didn't realize
[3:56:38.560 --> 3:56:40.560]  that
[3:56:40.560 --> 3:56:42.560]  their successors
[3:56:42.560 --> 3:56:44.560]  would make a career out of going into politics
[3:56:44.560 --> 3:56:46.560]  it was not on
[3:56:46.560 --> 3:56:48.560]  their visible right
[3:56:48.560 --> 3:56:50.560]  sure we only have about two and a half minutes left
[3:56:50.560 --> 3:56:52.560]  Dr. Schmidt one word to describe
[3:56:52.560 --> 3:56:54.560]  what it's like to be
[3:56:54.560 --> 3:56:56.560]  400,000 miles
[3:56:56.560 --> 3:56:58.560]  away or less
[3:56:58.560 --> 3:57:00.560]  from the earth one word
[3:57:00.560 --> 3:57:02.560]  to describe standing on another planet
[3:57:02.560 --> 3:57:04.560]  privilege
[3:57:04.560 --> 3:57:06.560]  I was greatly honored and privileged
[3:57:06.560 --> 3:57:08.560]  to have an opportunity to do it as we're all
[3:57:08.560 --> 3:57:10.560]  of my colleagues we were just the tip of the spear
[3:57:12.560 --> 3:57:14.560]  450,000 American
[3:57:14.560 --> 3:57:16.560]  tell that spear
[3:57:16.560 --> 3:57:18.560]  and we just represented them on the moon
[3:57:18.560 --> 3:57:20.560]  but they made it happen
[3:57:20.560 --> 3:57:22.560]  and that is my last question on the issue
[3:57:22.560 --> 3:57:24.560]  and then I will never bring it up to you again
[3:57:24.560 --> 3:57:26.560]  I promise if you join us again
[3:57:26.560 --> 3:57:28.560]  how did the film
[3:57:28.560 --> 3:57:30.560]  make it back
[3:57:30.560 --> 3:57:32.560]  through the Van Allen radiation belt
[3:57:32.560 --> 3:57:34.560]  well that belt doesn't have that much
[3:57:34.560 --> 3:57:36.560]  radiation
[3:57:36.560 --> 3:57:38.560]  if it was going to damage the film
[3:57:38.560 --> 3:57:40.560]  it would have damaged us
[3:57:40.560 --> 3:57:42.560]  there is radiation there
[3:57:42.560 --> 3:57:44.560]  and if you lingered in it
[3:57:44.560 --> 3:57:46.560]  over time you could accumulate
[3:57:46.560 --> 3:57:48.560]  a dose that could be a problem
[3:57:48.560 --> 3:57:50.560]  but we went through it so fast
[3:57:50.560 --> 3:57:52.560]  that there wasn't any significant dose
[3:57:52.560 --> 3:57:54.560]  on the film or on a
[3:57:54.560 --> 3:57:56.560]  well you know what's neat
[3:57:56.560 --> 3:57:58.560]  we're starting to see space tourism
[3:57:58.560 --> 3:58:00.560]  if they'd really give us a space program
[3:58:00.560 --> 3:58:02.560]  you know some of us could live long enough
[3:58:02.560 --> 3:58:04.560]  to actually go to the moon
[3:58:04.560 --> 3:58:06.560]  but pretty soon they'll say the moon doesn't exist
[3:58:06.560 --> 3:58:08.560]  and maybe it's made out of cheese
[3:58:08.560 --> 3:58:10.560]  Dr. Schmidt returned to the moon
[3:58:10.560 --> 3:58:12.560]  is the book
[3:58:12.560 --> 3:58:14.560]  he's out there exposing global warming
[3:58:14.560 --> 3:58:16.560]  as the fraud it is, man made global warming
[3:58:16.560 --> 3:58:18.560]  is there any websites to fire out
[3:58:18.560 --> 3:58:20.560]  sir or any other info
[3:58:20.560 --> 3:58:22.560]  no I think if people
[3:58:22.560 --> 3:58:24.560]  look at the book
[3:58:24.560 --> 3:58:26.560]  return to the moon they'll know
[3:58:26.560 --> 3:58:28.560]  what the future would be and how the
[3:58:28.560 --> 3:58:30.560]  yeah I'd like to have you back up
[3:58:30.560 --> 3:58:32.560]  in the next few months to just talk about the book itself
[3:58:32.560 --> 3:58:34.560]  and more about the moon
[3:58:34.560 --> 3:58:36.560]  and thank you for entertaining
[3:58:36.560 --> 3:58:38.560]  those questions
[3:58:38.560 --> 3:58:40.560]  let me say bye to you here at the end
[3:58:40.560 --> 3:59:08.560]  thanks for listening to GCN live.com
[3:59:08.560 --> 3:59:10.560]  we're back with another episode of
[3:59:10.560 --> 3:59:12.560]  our new episode of
[3:59:12.560 --> 3:59:14.560]  the moon
[3:59:14.560 --> 3:59:16.560]  and the moon
[3:59:16.560 --> 3:59:18.560]  and we'll see you next time
[3:59:18.560 --> 3:59:20.560]  here on the moon.
[3:59:20.560 --> 3:59:22.560]  now what are you going to do about it
[3:59:22.560 --> 3:59:24.560]  the acola blue atmospheric water generator
[3:59:24.560 --> 3:59:26.560]  is a low cost way to take back control
[3:59:26.560 --> 3:59:28.560]  of you and your families drinking water
[3:59:28.560 --> 3:59:30.560]  the acola blue 28 produces up to
[3:59:30.560 --> 3:59:32.560]  seven gallons of water from the humidity
[3:59:32.560 --> 3:59:34.560]  in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art
[3:59:34.560 --> 3:59:36.560]  carbon filtration, reverse osmosis
[3:59:36.560 --> 3:59:38.560]  1-800-691-6043
[3:59:38.560 --> 3:59:40.560]  that's 1-800-691-6043
[3:59:40.560 --> 3:59:42.560]  or visit
[3:59:42.560 --> 3:59:44.560]  acola blue on the web
