[00:00.000 --> 00:23.240]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance,
[00:23.240 --> 00:42.040]  Alex Jones.
[00:42.040 --> 00:46.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:46.040 --> 00:58.480]  It is Friday the 13th day of September 2013, we're going to be here for the next 3 hours.
[00:58.480 --> 01:04.440]  We have former CIA analyst and advisor Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr. Ray McGovern coming
[01:04.440 --> 01:11.600]  on to talk about the global crises in Syria with his inside take on that and more.
[01:11.600 --> 01:17.080]  We have a lot of amazing news here, a lot of amazing mainstream admissions, CNET News
[01:17.080 --> 01:27.360]  of CBS News, is reporting that NSA disguised itself as Google to spy say declassified reports.
[01:27.360 --> 01:32.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, Google is the NSA as I've been telling you for a decade.
[01:32.520 --> 01:38.400]  Google was founded by the CIA with In-Q-Tel money, their aircraft are based at NASA and
[01:38.400 --> 01:45.200]  military bases and they get military fuel and military fuel prices.
[01:45.200 --> 01:51.080]  As this has been exposed and lawsuits have been filed by competitors that it is a monopoly
[01:51.080 --> 01:55.400]  in unfair trade practices, this is being revealed.
[01:55.400 --> 02:00.920]  But Google is the new world order.
[02:00.920 --> 02:09.320]  The people running it, the people in control of the situation like to create private companies
[02:09.320 --> 02:13.360]  to then give the government contracts and technologies to that were paid for by the
[02:13.360 --> 02:21.100]  taxpayers via the military industrial complex that controls 95% now, used to be 90 back
[02:21.100 --> 02:28.200]  in Eisenhower's day, 95% of R&D research and development.
[02:28.200 --> 02:33.320]  So there's that type of news, speaking of DARPA, DARPA's plan to flood the sea with
[02:33.320 --> 02:39.040]  drones carrying more drones, we're going to be getting into that today.
[02:39.040 --> 02:49.320]  Also Paul Watson has a story up on infowars.com that is very important, in fact I want to
[02:49.320 --> 02:52.400]  link this in red right now and move to the top.
[02:52.400 --> 03:00.960]  The leader of Syrian rebel group calls for a tax inside the United States and he just
[03:00.960 --> 03:04.440]  also just happens to be the head of Al Qaeda.
[03:04.440 --> 03:09.920]  Now Paul Watson took the report of the London Telegraph today, reporting on how the head
[03:09.920 --> 03:15.200]  of Al Qaeda is calling for a tax in the U.S.
[03:15.200 --> 03:22.720]  He's also the head of Al Nuzra that is the main jihadi force being given U.S. aid to
[03:22.720 --> 03:27.400]  attack the embattled Syrian government.
[03:27.400 --> 03:33.040]  Now think about how that's hidden in plain view, think about the magnitude of that, we're
[03:33.040 --> 03:36.320]  going to be getting into that in great detail today.
[03:36.320 --> 03:44.520]  Also California lawmakers approve measure to allow driver's license for illegal immigrants
[03:44.520 --> 03:51.080]  yes the total legalization of illegals allowing them to vote with no ID and of course they
[03:51.080 --> 03:54.960]  then vote to take everybody's guns and to flood the country to drive down wages it's
[03:54.960 --> 03:57.440]  all going quite nicely.
[03:57.440 --> 04:04.040]  Also the Daily Mail is reporting on new reports put out by NASA and other major groups, it's
[04:04.040 --> 04:11.080]  now global cooling record return of Arctic ice caps as it grows by 60% in the last year.
[04:11.080 --> 04:16.920]  You can go see those satellite photos, now I just played you two weeks ago CNN saying
[04:16.920 --> 04:22.240]  it's all basically melted, the polar bears are can't swim and are drowning and that we're
[04:22.240 --> 04:25.120]  all basically dead if we don't pay Al Gore money.
[04:25.120 --> 04:29.920]  There are five times the polar bears that there were in surveys in 1955, look that up,
[04:29.920 --> 04:36.960]  five times, five times, five times, five times, they're the greatest land animal swimmer recorded
[04:36.960 --> 04:44.520]  swimming over 250 miles, on record, boom numbers exploding, boom ice caps getting bigger than
[04:44.520 --> 04:50.480]  ever, boom on record it doesn't matter, CNN gets up there and says it's all melting and
[04:50.480 --> 04:56.080]  shows you a satellite shot of the spring and summer when it always contracts and then expands
[04:56.080 --> 04:59.800]  in the fall and the winter.
[04:59.800 --> 05:06.840]  All the major top scientists are now admitting right now that the ice cap in the north and
[05:06.840 --> 05:13.400]  the south are getting very large and they're worried about a new ice age, oh but don't
[05:13.400 --> 05:19.040]  worry you pay Al Gore money he will fix that as well, you can sell him your oceanfront
[05:19.040 --> 05:23.520]  property he says he's going to flood because he's been buying it up as fast as he can,
[05:23.520 --> 05:30.080]  so this is the type of garbage that we deal with and yesterday I went home a little bit
[05:30.080 --> 05:38.600]  early at about 5.30 and to see my family and I almost stayed here because it was so incredible,
[05:38.600 --> 05:45.120]  they had Fox News on back there in the kitchen and they had Samantha Powers the spokeswoman
[05:45.120 --> 05:51.420]  for the State Department and the envoy to the UN up there like she was a fashion model
[05:51.420 --> 05:56.400]  slinging her red hair around just thinking that she was on the runway or that she was
[05:56.400 --> 06:00.960]  about to pole dance, I mean she had that you know trying to put the sex appeal on I'm a
[06:00.960 --> 06:07.720]  movie star, oh I'm such a rock star, no you're a war whore is what you are and a fraud, oh
[06:07.720 --> 06:15.120]  but she's a feminist, she's liberal, it's trendy when she launches wars and I'm sitting
[06:15.120 --> 06:20.880]  there watching this with my mouth hanging open and we're digging around for the clip
[06:20.880 --> 06:25.680]  but I saw her say it and she goes this is not about chemical weapons, this is about
[06:25.680 --> 06:33.480]  a man hurting his people, this is about freedom, this is about never allowing something like
[06:33.480 --> 06:43.400]  Rwanda to happen again, so then I walked back into my office to get my jogging shoes and
[06:43.400 --> 06:51.280]  they had CNN on and I saw the very same talking point but by one of the pundits saying this
[06:51.280 --> 06:57.600]  is about Rwanda, I mean we didn't do anything in Rwanda, we've got to do something about
[06:57.600 --> 07:01.840]  Rwanda and I walk in about an hour and a half ago and they're looking at a clip of
[07:01.840 --> 07:07.680]  Christina Amanpour you know married to the former State Department head under Clinton
[07:07.680 --> 07:13.960]  and this total black ops commander who lied about Serbian atrocities who showed starving
[07:13.960 --> 07:18.480]  people trying to get into a UN food station and said that they were in a concentration
[07:18.480 --> 07:26.080]  camp shooting the video from inside the roped off UN facility with the food at a guy who
[07:26.080 --> 07:31.720]  had tuberculosis so that's been confirmed, she's the one that put that out, she's the
[07:31.720 --> 07:41.240]  one, she's the one, yeah there's the new headline Samantha Power doing nothing on Syria would
[07:41.240 --> 07:45.800]  haunt our conscience so it's going to haunt our conscience on Rwanda and then of course
[07:45.800 --> 07:52.360]  if you're informed you know about Rwanda on record the UN went in and took one tribal
[07:52.360 --> 07:57.840]  group that was the animus to majority and the minority Christian group of course because
[07:57.840 --> 08:03.480]  of the Christian virtue and values of working together, most people that's what destroys
[08:03.480 --> 08:06.760]  civilization, people won't work together like nowadays, everybody's trying to stabs
[08:06.760 --> 08:11.400]  my in the back, everybody acts like weasels, no no the Christians control the other about
[08:11.400 --> 08:15.440]  10% of the country, they had most of the wealth and most of the big farms and the money and
[08:15.440 --> 08:19.480]  the industry and of course now since they destroyed them Rwanda's completely collapsed
[08:19.480 --> 08:23.400]  and the animus and the Muslims and others, Muslims were a minority as well, they went
[08:23.400 --> 08:29.280]  out of the UN, they put the Christian minority in facilities and the UN set up machine guns
[08:29.280 --> 08:33.360]  if they tried to leave and when they would try to leave they'd machine gun them so they
[08:33.360 --> 08:41.600]  sent the majority group in black on black but they divided them up to murder around,
[08:41.600 --> 08:46.640]  they debate the numbers 800,000, one and a half million, let's just say a million people
[08:46.640 --> 08:51.240]  and it came out in all the foreign press, the Belgian and other UN troops murdering,
[08:51.240 --> 08:56.880]  raping the children's machine gunning them with heavy weapons if they tried to get out
[08:56.880 --> 09:06.080]  and then sending in, sending in the majority groups to wipe out the minority group, Hutus
[09:06.080 --> 09:16.000]  and Tutsis, same people genetically wiped them out because the Christians owned property
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.800]  that had gold and diamonds and all sorts of other things that are needed in electronics
[09:22.800 --> 09:26.680]  especially rare earth minerals, they had to be wiped out and they were.
[09:26.680 --> 09:33.200]  By the way, again that's what Clinton did there and then don't forget sending in the
[09:33.200 --> 09:43.880]  Muslims out of Albania south of Serbia and sending in the Croats and other groups and
[09:43.880 --> 09:49.000]  again I'm not a Muslim, I'm not a Croat, I'm not a Serb, I'm not taking sides in this.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.320]  The point is facts are facts, the UN's own report five years after the Serbia bombardments
[09:54.320 --> 10:01.240]  admitted that the Croats and the Muslims started it and killed double what the Serbs did and
[10:01.240 --> 10:04.080]  the Serbs in atrocities as well but they didn't start it.
[10:04.080 --> 10:07.120]  This is how the globalists operate, this is how Brzezinski operates, this is how the
[10:07.120 --> 10:14.280]  Democrats run their peace wars, they invade your country, they'll use any, oh you got
[10:14.280 --> 10:21.760]  a big group of black animist, those are folks that worship animals, they outnumber you
[10:21.760 --> 10:26.000]  know eight to one and then when the Muslims involved nine to one the Christians, wipe
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.080]  them out, oh you want, you don't like the Serbs run in their own industry, run in their
[10:32.080 --> 10:38.200]  own businesses, run in their own operations, just send in Al Qaeda, that's, that's on record
[10:38.200 --> 10:43.720]  because the Liberation Army was Al Qaeda, the hobbyist, send a man, have him kill everybody,
[10:43.720 --> 10:48.160]  the Serbs fight back, call it an atrocity, bomb the entire infrastructure of Serbia,
[10:48.160 --> 10:52.800]  blow up their TV stations, their power stations, their water stations, their car factories,
[10:52.800 --> 10:59.800]  their aircraft factories, peaceful stuff, with DU, bomb Belgrade, they bombed Belgrade,
[10:59.800 --> 11:09.920]  hundreds of targets with giant DU Sabos, blowing them to kingdom come, oh guess what, they
[11:09.920 --> 11:15.240]  do have decades later a more than triple level, look it up, like the number I saw was five
[11:15.240 --> 11:21.000]  times the cancer rate and now in Belgrade, talk about chemical weapons, nerve gas just
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.680]  kills who it hits, it doesn't kill you, a month later, DU's got a what, a half life
[11:25.680 --> 11:32.880]  of four billion years, was it last time I checked? Boy, that's a chemical, a chemical
[11:32.880 --> 11:39.400]  radiological weapon that kills biological life and now they're pumping the jihadis in
[11:39.400 --> 11:44.080]  and the head of Al Qaeda is praising it, being armed by the U.S. while he says next
[11:44.080 --> 11:49.920]  he's going to attack America and they're going to let him attack America, you watch
[11:49.920 --> 11:55.280]  and then the government can take our rights, see how that works so good, it works perfectly
[11:55.280 --> 11:59.640]  doesn't it, full spectrum dominance.
[11:59.640 --> 12:05.080]  It's time for a home security quiz, what effective home security device is smaller than a coffee
[12:05.080 --> 12:09.680]  cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs
[12:09.680 --> 12:15.000]  into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments and sells for less than
[12:15.000 --> 12:21.280]  $30, yes it's fake TV, this year about one in every 50 U.S. homes will have a break in
[12:21.280 --> 12:26.680]  with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home,
[12:26.680 --> 12:31.680]  fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching
[12:31.680 --> 12:37.560]  TV by simulating the light from a real TV, fake TV could be the difference between coming
[12:37.560 --> 12:44.040]  home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked, to get your fake TV for only $29.95

[14:07.040 --> 14:08.040]  to serve as debt.
[14:08.040 --> 14:11.560]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public
[14:11.560 --> 14:14.840]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.

[16:20.920 --> 16:34.360]  I really do try to manage my anger, and it's not like I'm some goody two shoes that just
[16:34.360 --> 16:39.240]  likes to get angry and flounce around, I work on this all the time, I mean I know these
[16:39.240 --> 16:41.960]  people are, I know what they've done.
[16:41.960 --> 16:48.200]  Bill Clinton in the UN ran the mass murder of the Christian minority in Rwanda to take
[16:48.200 --> 16:51.080]  their property on record.
[16:51.080 --> 16:56.520]  Their rarest mineral property that Africa is just brimming with like nowhere in the world.
[16:56.520 --> 17:00.400]  On record and then the media spun it, oh they didn't do enough, the UN didn't do enough,
[17:00.400 --> 17:05.000]  they ran the operation and now it's public, they run operations in Latin America, Asia
[17:05.000 --> 17:08.000]  and Africa killing villagers for their property.
[17:08.000 --> 17:12.160]  Now they just say oh they were, it was forced relocation and yeah they did burn down the
[17:12.160 --> 17:16.560]  village and shoot people and it's in the back of the New York Times, it's a problem.
[17:16.560 --> 17:22.920]  See they're even mainlining it now where oh yeah we just go burn down your village and
[17:22.920 --> 17:27.720]  then I went and looked at the films shot by German film crews, I went and looked at the
[17:27.720 --> 17:34.000]  Danish magazine articles with them roasting kids over fires and raping them and setting
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.840]  up the UN checkpoints and seeing if you were a Christian with your ID and then handing
[17:38.840 --> 17:46.840]  you over to the majority animist Pagan group to be killed.
[17:46.840 --> 17:50.880]  I know there's two million people that have exited, that's Reuters out of Syria, most
[17:50.880 --> 17:51.960]  of them Christians.
[17:51.960 --> 17:55.520]  I know of the hundreds of thousands killed, a large portion of them are Christians, put
[17:55.520 --> 18:01.560]  at the sword and then I've got to watch Samantha Powers and I've got to watch Christina Amanpour,
[18:01.560 --> 18:07.160]  these women are all obviously jacked up on hormones, they're all prancing around totally
[18:07.160 --> 18:12.400]  jacked up sexually, you can look at them just like getting into themselves like I'm at a
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.680]  topless bar and they're on you know swinging around a pole or something, I mean it's really
[18:16.680 --> 18:20.680]  sick when women are like rubbing on their hands and got their nails all done and are
[18:20.680 --> 18:25.000]  sassin' back and forth saying it's for the children, we need a big war and they're all
[18:25.000 --> 18:30.280]  trying to be sexy about it and they're not good looking, it's really disgusting, it's
[18:30.280 --> 18:34.920]  demonic is what I'm saying and I don't, it's one thing if it's an old hunchbacked evil
[18:34.920 --> 18:40.680]  man doing it, you hate him or even Albright, looks like a goblin, Madeleine Albright, you
[18:40.680 --> 18:45.720]  know saying 500,000 kids was a terrible price but a price we had to pay for Iraq, we've
[18:45.720 --> 18:51.200]  got that clip we'll play in a moment and I know they're the authors of destroying Serbia
[18:51.200 --> 18:56.960]  and starting the civil war that killed massive amounts of people on record, I mean that's
[18:56.960 --> 19:02.040]  even in the UN's own reports they don't deny that, that's what's crazy and they ran the
[19:02.040 --> 19:07.080]  Rwanda thing and now the talking point from Christina Amanpour and we've got a clip of
[19:07.080 --> 19:12.400]  her and the clip from Powers and the clip from Clintons out there and Hillary going we've
[19:12.400 --> 19:18.480]  got to do this for the children when these people are the biggest murderers of children
[19:18.480 --> 19:25.040]  alive today, I've studied it folks, Mousley Tung's been dead a long time, Pol Pot's been
[19:25.040 --> 19:34.000]  dead, I really realized oh my gosh the Clintons, the Clintons and the things they oversaw with
[19:34.000 --> 19:39.360]  sanctions on Iraq and the rest of it are the biggest murderers of children in the world
[19:39.360 --> 19:45.360]  and I, first I got mad because I saw it on one TV and I walked and saw it on another
[19:45.360 --> 19:50.320]  channel and I almost started turning desk over, I'm going to be honest with you and
[19:50.320 --> 19:53.280]  then I just said no I'm going to go home to my family and then I see my innocent children
[19:53.280 --> 19:58.480]  and I start thinking about these vampire witches killing all these kids and then they're up
[19:58.480 --> 20:04.560]  there grandstanding like they're good and I just, it's flipping me out and I know it's
[20:04.560 --> 20:08.560]  flipping you out as well but it's like them saying the North Pole melted when it's the
[20:08.560 --> 20:13.280]  biggest it's ever been recorded and that's NASA, I mean they're on CNN saying the North
[20:13.280 --> 20:18.120]  Pole has basically melted down to nothing, we've played the news clip while it's the
[20:18.120 --> 20:26.120]  biggest ever, I mean these people are a larcenist group of enemies and it just hit me, they
[20:26.120 --> 20:30.880]  know they're enemies, they know they're criminal, they know they're evil, they want to kill
[20:30.880 --> 20:39.600]  more children, they are actual Satan, I just, I just, I just can't, how much more do we
[20:39.600 --> 20:45.560]  have to take, and then they say oh Putin, notice that the media is masterful, Putin's
[20:45.560 --> 20:52.320]  really beaten America, Putin's really, you know Putin has beaten the globalist vampires,
[20:52.320 --> 20:56.640]  he's just a worldly mob boss you know who's into you know being a champion fighter and
[20:56.640 --> 21:01.480]  stuff but at least he's a man, at least he's not a puppet even though he's undoubtedly
[21:01.480 --> 21:05.480]  powerful and pretty wicked, you could see there's a strain of good in him and he's not
[21:05.480 --> 21:13.560]  a puppet, the people we have are literal Nosferatu demons directly out of some other dimension
[21:13.560 --> 21:20.240]  I'm starting to think, and I mean that hypothetically as hyperbole but the point is they might as
[21:20.240 --> 21:23.640]  well be ladies and gentlemen, we come back and play all these clips, I'm going to play
[21:23.640 --> 21:27.920]  Albright saying 500,000 kids is a good price to pay, and then I'm going to put a thing
[21:27.920 --> 21:38.680]  on the nightly news tonight, juxtaposing juxtaposing all these clips of them admittedly killing
[21:38.680 --> 21:43.840]  people with them saying they care about the kids in Syria, when they end up taking over
[21:43.840 --> 21:49.000]  Syria they'll be 50 times the death, they'll probably kill everybody, I mean it's incredible.

[25:08.320 --> 25:34.640]  All
[25:34.640 --> 25:37.440]  have you heard the latest news ladies and gentlemen?
[25:37.440 --> 25:45.880]  The Senate panel okays a measure defining a journalist and Diane Feinstein has come
[25:45.880 --> 25:50.320]  out and said that it's only people making large salaries every year working for an
[25:50.320 --> 25:58.160]  established old dead media system, any real media, any new media, any real journalism
[25:58.160 --> 26:02.400]  resurrected because they're not real media, they're Pentagon regurgitators putting out
[26:02.400 --> 26:07.800]  state run propaganda on record, they've just finally gotten rid of the pretenses because
[26:07.800 --> 26:14.800]  it's known a month ago, they got rid of the law, they were already violating whole hog
[26:14.800 --> 26:19.440]  and now their war on real journalists is to try to buy them off with covert Pentagon money,
[26:19.440 --> 26:24.640]  that was declassified a month ago, that's how big a deal this is, you're like well wait
[26:24.640 --> 26:30.480]  I like the Pentagon, that's our boys, no ladies and gentlemen, the globalists that run our
[26:30.480 --> 26:38.240]  Pentagon and run the psych war systems and this is how they spin it in the Los Angeles
[26:38.240 --> 26:45.640]  Times, the dinosaur media, build to protect journalists clear Senate panel, the Senate
[26:45.640 --> 26:51.960]  Judiciary Committee approves a media shield bill to keep real reporters from having to
[26:51.960 --> 26:56.520]  testify on their work, how they call it the Patriot Act, they call Homeland Security Homeland
[26:56.520 --> 27:03.040]  Security, when it's the opposite, oh it's a bill to protect you, oh it's immigration
[27:03.040 --> 27:09.400]  reform, it legalizes all the illegals including felons and lets them vote, see they always
[27:09.400 --> 27:14.840]  mislabel something, it's kind of like the old Tom and Jerry cartoons when the cat would
[27:14.840 --> 27:19.080]  open his mouth up and have a sign saying it was a nightclub or restaurant trying to lure
[27:19.080 --> 27:23.840]  the mouse in, I mean I'm going to give you free healthcare, I'm not going to raise your
[27:23.840 --> 27:29.240]  payroll tax, not your income tax, none of your taxes, if you make less than $250,000
[27:29.240 --> 27:35.160]  a year, oh you're making even less than 30, I'm going to raise it, and then you read
[27:35.160 --> 27:41.640]  it, see this is what real journalists do, they actually go to what the bill does not
[27:41.640 --> 27:48.480]  what the name is, that's what Matt Drudge tweeted yesterday, he tweeted that on his
[27:48.480 --> 27:53.040]  personal tweet, on his newsfeed tweet, Matt Drudge blasts dying, finds time for trying
[27:53.040 --> 27:57.520]  to define who is and who isn't a reporter, we'll see that's exactly what Carl Rove said
[27:57.520 --> 28:02.320]  he told the New York Times, I define reality now, comments from Senator Feinstein yesterday
[28:02.320 --> 28:10.280]  on who's reporter were disgusting, 17 year old blogger is as important as Wolf Blitzer,
[28:10.280 --> 28:18.080]  absolutely if a 17 year old blogger is out blogging on NASCAR or let's say on some other
[28:18.080 --> 28:26.880]  circuit, Le Mans series or something, one of my favorites because there's a whole bunch
[28:26.880 --> 28:33.680]  of different cars at once out there, if I had time that's what I would be doing, and
[28:33.680 --> 28:43.760]  you look at that and you see a wreck or something happen and then you videotape it or you write
[28:43.760 --> 28:48.960]  about it and you end up being all over the news and your perspective, you're a journalist,
[28:48.960 --> 28:53.600]  your eyes and ears out there, you're not bought and paid for like the state run media that
[28:53.600 --> 28:59.960]  gets taxpayer money like MPR and MSNBC, thank God for all the real bloggers and people,
[28:59.960 --> 29:04.080]  we love having them on, that's how we're able to, anything that happens now, we've got listeners
[29:04.080 --> 29:08.040]  that are out there as citizen journalists or people we can contact that are out there
[29:08.040 --> 29:11.880]  from their own blogs or on YouTube channels to come on and tell us what they saw and it's
[29:11.880 --> 29:17.720]  bringing back real journalism and the system is upset about that, the Pentagon said a month
[29:17.720 --> 29:23.120]  and a half ago, they're freaked out by drudge and what he represents in the new media and
[29:23.120 --> 29:26.720]  that no one believes them anymore and that the people have lost confidence, so their
[29:26.720 --> 29:34.560]  answer is a major offensive against the new real media to come in and make contact and
[29:34.560 --> 29:38.960]  to do business deals with, so they're now going to have the Pentagon that's in the business
[29:38.960 --> 29:43.920]  of fake news in foreign countries and buying off news reporters, they're now going to be
[29:43.920 --> 29:47.960]  hitting everybody and by the way folks, now there's the headline, Pentagon says they've
[29:47.960 --> 29:54.320]  lost control of independent media led by drudge and there's my analysis of it up there and
[29:54.320 --> 29:57.960]  I told you they're collapsing when they're all in an emergency meeting on the Pentagon
[29:57.960 --> 30:04.880]  channel with hundreds of top brass and top flak in there, top PR flaks looking totally
[30:04.880 --> 30:09.800]  freaked out going our metric show, no one believes us anymore, yeah exactly and we're
[30:09.800 --> 30:13.680]  in deep trouble, we've got to be truthful and stop lying and they go what do you mean
[30:13.680 --> 30:18.800]  sir stop lying, that's our job, well you know what I mean, don't just ball face deny things,
[30:18.800 --> 30:24.480]  put spin on it and they're all looking freaked out going but they still aren't going to
[30:24.480 --> 30:28.200]  believe that, doesn't matter, we're going to make contact with all the bloggers, we're
[30:28.200 --> 30:31.200]  going to bring them in, we're going to embed them with us because now we're going to be
[30:31.200 --> 30:36.480]  operating domestically, so it's all a Psyop on them, they're being more Psyop than anybody
[30:36.480 --> 30:41.200]  in that hour long Pentagon briefing you ought to go watch and question and answer and everybody's
[30:41.200 --> 30:44.440]  rolling their eyes and looking freaked out because they're announcing a major Psyop
[30:44.440 --> 30:52.520]  attack on America and everybody there knows how illegal and criminal and un-American this
[30:52.520 --> 30:57.880]  is and they already know it's been going on forever anyways and so you can see them having
[30:57.880 --> 31:03.720]  their morale destroyed even more right in front of you and the undersecretary of defense
[31:03.720 --> 31:13.400]  looks completely freaked out while he's doing it and I mean they're finally been arrogant
[31:13.400 --> 31:21.000]  and hubris filled, they're now in titanic level panic mode, they are now having a complete
[31:21.000 --> 31:29.800]  meltdown and Diane Feinstein the witch is coming out saying we now will define and they're
[31:29.800 --> 31:34.960]  now going to try to get it passed to the full Senate and the House saying everybody else
[31:34.960 --> 31:42.840]  who isn't listed by the federal government as real media, meaning state-run, state-controlled
[31:42.840 --> 31:48.840]  on a short leash so they can call and threaten you know the bosses, there's many famous
[31:48.840 --> 31:53.680]  cases, photography is not a crime out of Florida, he has the famous case a few years
[31:53.680 --> 31:58.440]  ago, in fact I want to get that guy on this show, he's been on the nightly news, he was
[31:58.440 --> 32:05.200]  a famous you know blogger, video guy, national news every week, he shows up to cover a police
[32:05.200 --> 32:10.320]  event and there's all these television cameras and news there on a public sidewalk they walk
[32:10.320 --> 32:14.520]  over and they go you're not allowed to be here, they are their real media and they
[32:14.520 --> 32:19.400]  arrested him and of course now it's in court but that's the idea, they want to be able
[32:19.400 --> 32:24.760]  to say you do not have any protection and we're going to arrest you for having a camera
[32:24.760 --> 32:32.000]  and it gets worse than that, what the feds are saying is you will have no source anonymity.
[32:32.000 --> 32:36.800]  Under the definition, Matt Drudge with, I don't know what is it, 50 million visitors
[32:36.800 --> 32:43.720]  a day, something like that, we get millions of visitors a day now, he gets 30, 40, 50
[32:43.720 --> 32:49.280]  million last time I checked, it's in the 50s yeah, you're not a journalist even though
[32:49.280 --> 32:53.640]  you've broken hundreds of national news stories, everybody in the world begs to be on your
[32:53.640 --> 33:00.080]  site, you're not Diane Feinstein, a big ugly witch who wants to disarm everybody, an authoritarian
[33:00.080 --> 33:10.200]  bag of scruffy-less beetle droppings, she is going to, this anti-free speech tyrant,
[33:10.200 --> 33:15.520]  she is going to decide who is and who isn't and that's that whole magic wand, they decide
[33:15.520 --> 33:18.680]  what reality is, they tell us well guess what, it's too late, go ahead and try to shut the
[33:18.680 --> 33:22.200]  blogs down, go ahead and try to arrest reporters all over the country for videotaping, go ahead
[33:22.200 --> 33:27.840]  and arrest my reporters, we'll seal you and win, we have G20, Pittsburgh, go ahead, you
[33:27.840 --> 33:33.080]  want to fight, you tyrant scum, Americans, real Americans have done it before, we'll
[33:33.080 --> 33:39.320]  do it again and we're sick of the world blaming Americans and Americana for what you globalist
[33:39.320 --> 33:43.840]  scumbags and the antithesis of what made this country so great, that's what Putin said at
[33:43.840 --> 33:49.840]  the end of his letter, he said all men are created equal, America has been great, but
[33:49.840 --> 33:54.920]  now you're becoming very, very corrupt and dangerous and the world doesn't like what
[33:54.920 --> 33:58.480]  you're doing and your own people don't like what you're doing and you're not exceptional
[33:58.480 --> 34:03.520]  to be above the law to commit war crimes and fund Al-Qaeda and all of these, the Senator
[34:03.520 --> 34:09.480]  Mendes with all his scandals, has the nerve, you know about his scandals folks, I'm not
[34:09.480 --> 34:14.040]  going to get into them on air, they're so amazing, that blob just looks like a, I would
[34:14.040 --> 34:17.680]  not want to hang out with him, I wouldn't want to have dinner with him, I wouldn't want
[34:17.680 --> 34:24.520]  him as my neighbor, I wouldn't want John McCain as my neighbor, these are creeps, creepy weirdos,
[34:24.520 --> 34:31.080]  creepy scumbags with a trail of evil, teething five, bit rigging, stock market fixing, just,
[34:31.080 --> 34:35.800]  let me just look at these people, you know they go to the Senate worth a million bucks
[34:35.800 --> 34:40.200]  or worth 300, 400 million, you go to the House worth of $50,000 or worth 20 million, five
[34:40.200 --> 34:47.240]  years, I mean they are just robbing us, wholesale and now Harry Reid's really freaking out,
[34:47.240 --> 34:52.160]  he's not up there like he said yesterday, in fact if you guys don't have this, no, we
[34:52.160 --> 34:56.480]  do have it, he called them, the Tea Partiers are nonviolent anarchists who don't believe
[34:56.480 --> 34:59.600]  in any form of government, we have the biggest government in the world, we're already bankrupt,
[34:59.600 --> 35:08.400]  it's growing exponentially, minute by minute, and they have the nerve to get up there and
[35:08.400 --> 35:14.520]  say that the Tea Party is running the country, which is true, and that we're Neanderthal,
[35:14.520 --> 35:20.420]  barbarian, scum, racist, obstructionist, that's the real Tea Party, remember they said the
[35:20.420 --> 35:24.320]  Tea Party has no power, the Tea Party's a joke, the Republican blue bloods tried to
[35:24.320 --> 35:28.200]  co-opt it, didn't successfully do it, Carl Robes spends all his time trying to steer
[35:28.200 --> 35:36.640]  it or kill it, it's disgusting, and now Harry Reid has come out and said they're dangerous
[35:36.640 --> 35:41.080]  anarchists and others have said they're barbarians, they're racist, but he says in there that
[35:41.080 --> 35:50.080]  we're running the agenda, the Ron Paul, Alex Jones, Drudge Report, Info Wars type libertarianism,
[35:50.080 --> 35:54.360]  that's why Beck suddenly has jumped fully in a libertarian camp, anti-New World Order,
[35:54.360 --> 35:59.120]  sounds like Alex Jones show, hallelujah we've won, Rush Limbaugh, looks like a false flag,
[35:59.120 --> 36:05.520]  you see we're taking over folks, that's Americana, don't let the globalist speak for you, you
[36:05.520 --> 36:10.920]  notice they're saying Putin has defeated America, Putin has made America look bad, Putin has
[36:10.920 --> 36:15.080]  outmaneuvered America, to go well I don't like Obama but I don't like Putin outmaneuvering
[36:15.080 --> 36:19.160]  America, Putin didn't outmaneuver America, he called that the emperor was wearing no
[36:19.160 --> 36:25.560]  clothes, he called shenanigans, he called fraud, and guess what, he didn't Putin stealing
[36:25.560 --> 36:30.240]  four or five trillion dollars a taxpayer money a year to give the foreign offshore megabanks,
[36:30.240 --> 36:36.160]  Putin kicked the oligarchs out of his country and arrested those he couldn't kick out, oh
[36:36.160 --> 36:40.680]  oh you work for the Rothschilds or Rockefellers, you own half the Russia, oh you did it through
[36:40.680 --> 36:49.000]  fraud back in the 1920s, how about we clap handcuffs on you, same thing Iceland's doing,
[36:49.000 --> 36:53.480]  again I'm not moving to Iceland, I'm a fan of what they've done, I'm a fan of what the
[36:53.480 --> 36:59.680]  Russians have been doing, my goodness, we have globalist, the headlines should be, Putin
[36:59.680 --> 37:05.960]  stands up against America's occupiers, Putin stands up against banking cartel that's hijacked
[37:05.960 --> 37:11.040]  America, we ought to be allied with Russia under free market and liberty, they ought
[37:11.040 --> 37:18.280]  to be our biggest trading partner, Russia's relaxing their gun laws, Russia's paying people
[37:18.280 --> 37:22.680]  to have kids, Russia's trying to have family values, we're doing the opposite because Russia's
[37:22.680 --> 37:28.040]  already been through hell, they've already been through the tyranny, you know they say
[37:28.040 --> 37:32.080]  that's always the greatest areas of liberty are places that have been under the tyranny
[37:32.080 --> 37:40.520]  the longest, a smart man said that Cuba and China and places like that that have been
[37:40.520 --> 37:45.680]  under hellish tyranny, they're going to be the sanctums of liberty because that's how
[37:45.680 --> 37:54.680]  the cycle works, we are a big giant rotting evil empire, we need to disavow it and say
[37:54.680 --> 38:00.600]  it's not us, it's not America, we don't want it on us, we rebuke it, we refuse it, you
[38:00.600 --> 38:05.200]  eat some bad food, you start feeling sick, I've gotten food poisoning with friends before
[38:05.200 --> 38:09.880]  back in college at a restaurant, I felt sick, it tasted weird after like five bites, I felt
[38:09.880 --> 38:17.360]  weird, tasted medley, I went through up, didn't get sick, they all got food poisoning, one
[38:17.360 --> 38:23.400]  of my friends had to go to the hospital over at the Mexican food restaurant because the
[38:23.400 --> 38:27.560]  bacteria released toxins of those type that give me the food poisoning, I was like this
[38:27.560 --> 38:35.260]  doesn't taste right, tastes meh, I had like a psychosomatic response, I think I pulled
[38:35.260 --> 38:38.360]  over, drive at home and threw up on the side of the road, I don't remember the whole, the
[38:38.360 --> 38:45.000]  point is everybody else was deathly ill the next day, my college buddies, deathly ill
[38:45.000 --> 38:51.520]  and we need to vomit out Dianne Feinstein and Kerry and Obama and Karl Rove and the
[38:51.520 --> 38:57.440]  Bushes and all the kleptocrats and just, come on, we need to have dry heaves and just
[38:57.440 --> 39:03.200]  vomit and vomit and vomit until bile starts coming out and then vomit some more and then
[39:03.200 --> 39:08.320]  vomit some more and then vomit and vomit and vomit and vomit and go through a fever and
[39:08.320 --> 39:13.040]  get this disease out of us ladies and gentlemen.
[39:13.040 --> 39:17.040]  That's what we need to do, we need to rebuke it and we need to put ourselves before God
[39:17.040 --> 39:21.480]  and repent immediately, all of us, because we're going into darkness and God's giving
[39:21.480 --> 39:26.080]  us a chance as the whole world wakes up and we see the evil revealed to say no to it,
[39:26.080 --> 39:29.880]  to recognize it and say no, if not we go over the edge of the cliff, they take over red
[39:29.880 --> 39:36.240]  terror, secret arrest, FEMA camps, America's getting a chance here ladies and gentlemen,
[39:36.240 --> 39:43.360]  just like when Jonah, you know, got to Nineveh and went around for 10 days warning people
[39:43.360 --> 39:49.880]  and you know what, they listened, they listened and they were given 100 year reprieve before
[39:49.880 --> 39:57.360]  they became a decadent again and were destroyed, just like Jerusalem in 70 AD, Christ said
[39:57.360 --> 40:01.880]  before this generation has passed, not one of these stones will be left unturned, this
[40:01.880 --> 40:09.360]  whole place will be destroyed, he told the head Pharisee and the arrogant Pharisee laughed
[40:09.360 --> 40:19.080]  at him and in 70 AD, Titus sacked and burned Jerusalem to the ground and I'm telling you
[40:19.080 --> 40:26.160]  ladies and gentlemen, we're done, we're done if we don't really realize we've been poisoned
[40:26.160 --> 40:32.720]  and get our stomachs pumped right now. Oh, Putin's putting down America, Putin's not
[40:32.720 --> 40:37.560]  saying you're exceptional, he says you've been exceptional, we want to be friends with
[40:37.560 --> 40:41.800]  you but you're being exceptionally evil right now and you don't have a right to be above
[40:41.800 --> 40:48.000]  the law, stop it right now. Folks, the West started the war on record against Syria, it's
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  a war crime and to watch the war criminals that are behind it all, grandstanding and
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.880]  prancing around and Christina Amanpour doing horrible acting of how emotional she is and
[40:57.880 --> 41:03.640]  we shouldn't have let Rwanda happen like that and cement the powers, these are big wicked
[41:03.640 --> 41:08.400]  witch queen bees, ladies and gentlemen, who are all about their power. I thought when
[41:08.400 --> 41:12.280]  the women ran the world there wasn't going to be any war, it's three women running the
[41:12.280 --> 41:17.040]  whole show for this war, ladies and gentlemen. If you look at Kerry, he can barely stand up
[41:17.040 --> 41:21.080]  it's so evil, he's shaking during the testimonies and has to almost put his head down, I mean
[41:21.080 --> 41:27.800]  the demonic load is so heavy and you look at these women, they are just absolutely aroused
[41:27.800 --> 41:34.800]  by what they're doing. I mean, I look at these women, they're animated by narcissistic sexual
[41:34.800 --> 41:39.600]  energy and it makes me want to throw up. Mendez, you want to throw up reading Putin's letter,
[41:39.600 --> 41:44.160]  I think it's a beautiful heartfelt reaching out letter, whether it's cynically done, doesn't
[41:44.160 --> 41:50.080]  matter, the words are very strong and true. You on the other hand are a coven of black
[41:50.080 --> 41:55.800]  magic witches, I call you out. Let's go to a real murderer, Madeline Albright, who helped
[41:55.800 --> 42:00.120]  intensify the sanctions on industrialized country at that time to kill a half million
[42:00.120 --> 42:05.440]  kids. Some numbers are a million dead kids now. This was said a decade ago, here it is.
[42:05.440 --> 42:10.840]  We have heard that a half a million children have died, I mean that's more children than
[42:10.840 --> 42:19.840]  died in Hiroshima and you know, is the price worth it? I think this is a very hard choice,
[42:19.840 --> 42:24.000]  but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.160]  And by the way, that's the short clip. If you find the long clip from 60 Minutes, as
[42:27.160 --> 42:32.960]  she also said on NBC, not just CBS, she goes on to say, for security in the Gulf region
[42:32.960 --> 42:36.440]  and that we should keep the sanctions on. But try to find the full clip. I want to play
[42:36.440 --> 42:43.200]  the full, the full bouquet, the full palette of evil. Because ladies and gentlemen, then
[42:43.200 --> 42:47.640]  I watch Christina Amanpour and you look at Albright with the power trip in her eyes.
[42:47.640 --> 42:50.720]  I've seen these people, when they talk about the stuff, they get animated. They know what
[42:50.720 --> 42:54.480]  they're doing, they like it and they know every Christian in Syria is going to have
[42:54.480 --> 42:59.760]  their head chopped off. My Al-Qaeda, they love it, they love it.

[46:22.360 --> 46:30.160]  Folks, we got Katy Perry's dad who is a huge listener. Dave Mustaine a couple of years
[46:30.160 --> 46:34.180]  ago told me that Katy Perry's dad, one of the biggest pop stars out there, was a huge
[46:34.180 --> 46:37.920]  listener. So I thought why not reach out to him a few weeks ago and sure enough he says
[46:37.920 --> 46:41.440]  he listens every day. We're not going to get him on to talk about Katy Perry but he has
[46:41.440 --> 46:49.080]  a new book out dealing with what's happened to the youth and how this culture has basically
[46:49.080 --> 46:52.280]  gotten to this point. He has been critical of some of the things his daughter's done
[46:52.280 --> 46:56.760]  but has been misquoted when he talks about some of the quotes. So we'll probably briefly
[46:56.760 --> 47:00.360]  clear that up but I'm not going to get into that. I want to get into it from his perspective.
[47:00.360 --> 47:03.480]  She wanted to get into music. He tried to get her into Christian music and things but
[47:03.480 --> 47:06.960]  obviously she was talented and got picked up by the New World Order. But you know she
[47:06.960 --> 47:09.840]  does like those Pentagon videos. They have hundreds of millions of videos getting girls
[47:09.840 --> 47:13.800]  assigned for the military. I don't think she knows what she's doing but that's not why
[47:13.800 --> 47:16.800]  Katy Perry's dad's going to be joining us. I really want to get his perspective. He's
[47:16.800 --> 47:21.840]  a very interesting preacher and motivational speaker and author. So he's coming on. Ray
[47:21.840 --> 47:26.440]  McGovern is going to be coming on as well. You know again I get on air and I try to not
[47:26.440 --> 47:31.800]  get mad. And when I say these women look sexually excited. What I mean is like you know Miss
[47:31.800 --> 47:37.680]  America you know how they'll jazz up look excited. You know how you know you'll see
[47:37.680 --> 47:41.360]  women on the street corner trying to look exciting or whatever to get they get picked
[47:41.360 --> 47:46.120]  up. It's that same energy. They just look excited. They look like they're enjoying
[47:46.120 --> 47:50.000]  it. It's it's fun. You know they're shaking their hair around. We're not worried about
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.680]  Putin. We're going to deal with it for the children and they just are getting off on
[47:54.680 --> 48:00.840]  the power. It's the narcissism is what I'm talking about. You know the the you know sexy
[48:00.840 --> 48:06.600]  woman I'm in charge. I'll show you and it Obama's got a peace prize. That's what I'm
[48:06.600 --> 48:15.160]  saying. Kind of like Mika Brzezinski. Whenever I had Russell Brannon you know he agreed that
[48:15.160 --> 48:19.400]  the women were getting excited on the show. And no one else pointed that out. I was pointing
[48:19.400 --> 48:23.960]  that out. It's just like they're up there excited to be on TV. And I get being excited
[48:23.960 --> 48:28.000]  because you're on television. But how was it like a power trip is what I'm saying. And
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.440]  it's like with with women particularly I've noticed that join the dark side. It's like
[48:32.440 --> 48:36.120]  there it's like a sexual evil. I don't know how to describe it. It's like it's the same
[48:36.120 --> 48:41.440]  vibe they put out as they're doing evil things. They're getting off on it. It's like some
[48:41.440 --> 48:47.000]  wicked thrill. I'm psychoanalyzing it. And you know that's from my perspective. You
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.400]  know I had no one knew what only God forgives meant. And I got the director on and he basically
[48:51.400 --> 48:55.320]  said yeah no one's gotten it. That's what the movie means. He is blown away. I'm not
[48:55.320 --> 49:00.040]  toot my horn. I just recognize things that other people don't seem to recognize for whatever
[49:00.040 --> 49:05.480]  reason. And it makes me very sick when we see things like this. Now now I'm not going to
[49:05.480 --> 49:10.000]  play the whole exchange but here is Christina Amanpour who helped sell the attack on the
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.720]  Serbs. It was all a fraud to put the Muslim extremists in to take them down. Let's let's
[49:14.720 --> 49:22.240]  go to a short clip of her going out to break. I can barely contain myself at this point.
[49:22.240 --> 49:27.400]  How many more times do we have to say that weapons of mass destruction were used and
[49:27.400 --> 49:32.680]  as bad as it is to decapitate somebody it is by no means equal. We can't use this false
[49:32.680 --> 49:36.520]  moral equivalence about what's going on right now. They tried to do it in the Second World
[49:36.520 --> 49:40.320]  War. They tried to do it in Bosnia. They tried to do it in Rwanda and they're trying to do
[49:40.320 --> 49:48.280]  it now. There is no moral influence. Meanwhile they didn't. Wait just a second. She's the
[49:48.280 --> 49:53.640]  woman behind a lot of it. And then she's saying other people did it. And the most moral country
[49:53.640 --> 49:58.920]  in the world based on the most moral principles in the world at least that's the fundamental
[49:58.920 --> 50:04.880]  principle that the United States rests on. Cannot allow this to go unchecked. Cannot allow
[50:04.880 --> 50:13.080]  this to go unchecked. And I'll tell you what. President Clinton 15, 16 years later is still
[50:13.080 --> 50:18.680]  apologizing for Rwanda. I just spoke to Lanny Davis who was once his... She gets real excited
[50:18.680 --> 50:26.880]  here in a minute. Once his ally and his... She needs this blood. She needs the blood.
[50:26.880 --> 50:35.960]  And she needs Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda has a chemical attack. She's blaming their forces for everything
[50:35.960 --> 50:50.040]  that happened. We'll get right back. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[50:50.040 --> 50:55.600]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[50:55.600 --> 51:00.680]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged. You can even make your own colloidal
[51:00.680 --> 51:05.080]  silver at home in your garage. How do you know which solution is the safest and most
[51:05.080 --> 51:11.280]  effective? Supernatural silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts
[51:11.280 --> 51:17.280]  of AC current. This technology is so powerful it must be made in a laboratory. Colloidal
[51:17.280 --> 51:23.360]  and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver
[51:23.360 --> 51:29.320]  hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus. Supernatural silver
[51:29.320 --> 51:34.520]  liquid can be used internally. And our silver gel can be used topically. To find out more

[52:35.640 --> 52:43.320]  my head spin. Absolutely makes my head spin. They're going out to the freedom of the press
[52:43.320 --> 52:47.200]  in this country calling it a press protection bill. We're going to be getting into that
[52:47.200 --> 52:56.680]  in this hour. We've got a full court press all over television again saying that Assad
[52:56.680 --> 53:01.400]  did launch the chemical attack and that we've got a moral imperative like Serbia and Rwanda
[53:01.400 --> 53:07.280]  to save everyone. When Serbia and Rwanda on record were engineered by the globalists
[53:07.280 --> 53:12.720]  in both cases. But they're just targeting the public like they're completely and absolutely
[53:12.720 --> 53:19.320]  totally ignorant. Meanwhile, it's all coming out ladies and gentlemen. It's all coming
[53:19.320 --> 53:31.480]  out right now that the globalists have been caught lying on every single front. Here are
[53:31.480 --> 53:40.440]  some of the headlines that are up on infowars.com. Wife of man executed by FBI demands justice.
[53:40.440 --> 53:46.560]  This big breaking news when we interviewed the wife of the man executed by the FBI at
[53:46.560 --> 53:55.760]  his house that declared national security on the death squad operation. The top story
[53:55.760 --> 54:03.560]  of course is leader of Syrian rebel group calls for attacks inside the U.S. Wife of
[54:03.560 --> 54:08.880]  man executed by FBI demands justice. I just mentioned that. Kill a family member to join
[54:08.880 --> 54:15.640]  at the Illuminati. All Joseph Watson did a very interesting report on some of the amoral
[54:15.640 --> 54:19.480]  degeneracy coming out in the news. Do you heard me right? Kill a family member to join
[54:19.480 --> 54:25.880]  the Illuminati. CNN propaganda's Amon poor demands moral intervention in Syria. And what
[54:25.880 --> 54:31.840]  I want our crew to do a story on is when she worked for the British press, she was involved
[54:31.840 --> 54:37.840]  putting out the fake story that was originally generated what an ITN with the guy behind
[54:37.840 --> 54:43.120]  the bar bar trying to get into a U.N. food center. She's like, look at the man in the
[54:43.120 --> 54:49.080]  camp. It's the Nazis. I mean, she knows she's up there lying. She knows I'll kind of launch
[54:49.080 --> 54:52.600]  the attacks. She knows they're going to butcher all the Christians. They know they want to
[54:52.600 --> 54:57.080]  deindustrialize and implode Syria. They know they want to bring down and put the jihadism
[54:57.080 --> 55:01.880]  control of Egypt. They know and she's up there going, well, you must do it. I can hardly
[55:01.880 --> 55:07.240]  talk. I'm so upset. And then she's up there trying to be an actress and it's just such
[55:07.240 --> 55:14.600]  a joke lying to their viewers. Unbelievable. Nigel Farage. This clip's coming up. Confronts
[55:14.600 --> 55:20.200]  EU communist Barroso over global warming hoax. That's absolutely imploding right now. Very
[55:20.200 --> 55:25.320]  important report or is coming. 10 reasons why diplomatic solution in Syria crisis is
[55:25.320 --> 55:31.080]  extremely unlikely. Russia to expand Mediterranean fleet to 10 warships already got what seven
[55:31.080 --> 55:36.920]  there with the carrier killer arriving a couple days ago. I mean, this is getting serious.
[55:36.920 --> 55:40.800]  The lawmakers approved measure to allow driver's license for legal immigrants. Let me get a
[55:40.800 --> 55:45.800]  little news flash. They already do that. DMV in Texas gives it to them to look. And again,
[55:45.800 --> 55:50.680]  I know that against the illegals, a lot of them are actually hardworking good people.
[55:50.680 --> 55:54.560]  The generation or two after being there, just like everybody else's kids, black, white,
[55:54.560 --> 55:59.320]  I don't care. They are absolutely dependent, spoiled rotten brats on average, just like
[55:59.320 --> 56:04.480]  white people and black kids. I mean, it is unbelievable what the culture in the media
[56:04.480 --> 56:10.320]  here does to people. And I wouldn't have a problem with 30 million illegals here if it
[56:10.320 --> 56:16.240]  was the kind of, you know, cowboy hat, gun loving, freedom loving, family loving type
[56:16.240 --> 56:21.440]  hardworking people that come up here from Mexico. But within a generation, it's absolute
[56:21.440 --> 56:27.240]  communist party. White people are all racist and bad. My guns are evil. El Norte is Mexico's
[56:27.240 --> 56:32.480]  all Ford Foundation globalist garbage. And it's the kiss of death. It's how the globalist
[56:32.480 --> 56:37.320]  plan to finally bring in the voting block and bring this country down. Hey, can I go
[56:37.320 --> 56:42.120]  to Mexico have a free baby? Can I go to Mexico become a citizen or get a driver's license
[56:42.120 --> 56:46.240]  like that? No, I can't. I can imagine walking in a Mexican hospital saying I'm here to have
[56:46.240 --> 56:50.160]  my baby paid for. They'd say, actually, we're going to arrest you and throw you in jail
[56:50.160 --> 56:53.920]  till the police suck every time out of your family. By the way, we're going to knock your
[56:53.920 --> 56:59.760]  teeth out to gringo.
[56:59.760 --> 57:04.240]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre selected for us? As we've moved through
[57:04.240 --> 57:09.620]  history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information. Billions of
[57:09.620 --> 57:16.940]  dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche from
[57:16.940 --> 57:22.640]  compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine. We are kept in
[57:22.640 --> 57:27.400]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions. When somebody obscures that
[57:27.400 --> 57:31.960]  feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total
[57:31.960 --> 57:35.800]  control of your awareness. All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of
[57:35.800 --> 57:41.000]  the game. How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.400]  endorse but demand a war.

[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:13.280]  Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:21.960]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:39.440]  We're now into hour number two. Ray McGovern, former top CI analyst, Ronald Reagan and of
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:44.280]  course George Bush Sr. their morning briefer is going to be joining us to give us his expert
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:49.480]  inside intel on what's happened in Syria and where it's all going and how big a blow
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:55.560]  this is to the corporate empire that sees America because it's not that Putin's defeating
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:01.120]  America. Putin is outmaneuvering the globalist who've just been caught lying and committing
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:08.200]  crimes worldwide for even the dumbest people are waking up to exactly what's happening.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:14.800]  Reuters is reporting that the head of Al Qaeda chief is calling for attacks on USA. So is
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:19.200]  the London Telegraph but that dovetails with our article. It's the top story red linked
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:27.640]  on info wars.com. Leader of Syrian rebel group calls for attacks inside the United States
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:38.320]  and he just so also happens to be the head of Al Qaeda and Amon Al Zahiri, the leader
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:47.280]  of Jabot Al Nazra, which is the primary opposition force fighting in Syria has called for terror
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:54.280]  attacks inside the United States after the Jihad successfully takes over the next goal.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:02:00.400]  Obama is backing them in the takeover of Egypt. He is backing them in the takeover of Libya.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:06.320]  He is backing them in the takeover of Syria and they have the nerve after Al Nazra got
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.160]  caught videotaping themselves. They're very proud of it. Firing the chemical weapons weeks
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.120]  ago and back in March. They've done it over and over again. It's the only way they can
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:19.160]  defeat the Syrian forces. This is Saudi Arabian chemical weapons. All this has come out and
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:24.400]  they've got Christina, I'm on poor and cement the powers and all the rest of these these
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:29.360]  war horse is what they are. They're they're they're whoring America out for war. They're
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:35.160]  up there on TV saying how dare I let him kill children and it is not a moral equivalent
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:42.160]  when people get their heads chopped off or get executed to the nerve-gassing of children.
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:48.600]  And what happened in Rwanda was wrong and we've got to do something and the meanwhile
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:54.120]  they're the ones and with Christina I'm on poor literally running fake video of what
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:03:00.440]  they said was a concentration camp. That's on record that she and others pushed video
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:05.560]  of a guy trying to get into a food station that had bar bar around it who had tuberculosis
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:10.160]  as a fat guy right next to him in the video. But they said look at the man in the camp
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:17.520]  starving to death. He's in a Serb death camp. I am Christina I'm on poor reporting for the
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:22.840]  British news and then they said you are such a piece of garbage. Can we hire you for CNN?
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:29.280]  You are our type of piece of trash liar. We love you honey baby. And now she comes on
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:35.560]  television to lecture all of us and it's just wall to wall carry. He launched a chemical
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:40.920]  weapon. I'm on poor they launched it on and on and on. Last hour I played the clip of
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:46.720]  her saying hey it is a moral imperative because he's hurting the children when the West almost
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.720]  three years ago started this. And I know I've said that over and over again I try not to
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:56.680]  get upset. It's just at a certain point this becomes twilight zone level. This is becoming
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:03.440]  twilight zone level by the minute. And meanwhile Harry Reid is coming out in the Senate yesterday
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:08.280]  in a speech saying the Tea Party has been running this country. Wait a minute I thought
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:12.440]  the Tea Party had no power. I thought they were all racist. I thought they were all scum
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:17.200]  you know that lived in the South as the Democrats who live in the North and the West going oh
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:24.520]  Southerners white racist scum. Imagine if you said those northerners scum. The only group
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:27.360]  you're allowed to really be racist and hateful towards white Southerners. I mean because
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.520]  everybody knows they can't talk and they can't tie their shoelaces or they're evil. They
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:37.240]  own guns. They're bitter clingers on the Bible. You know we've heard it all before. Gene Simmons
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:44.080]  has come out and defended Tebow saying that if he was wearing a burka they wouldn't dare
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.920]  say anything. It is because he's Christian and he's being attacked. Again college drops
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:55.640]  ban on veils ban after Muslim outcry. That's just all part of the divide and conquer going
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:58.440]  on but it's only Christians. Can you imagine if Muslims were having their heads chopped
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:04.600]  off in mass? Al Qaeda in Syria then it would be a big issue. That is just some of the incredible
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:12.000]  news that is now breaking and now it's come out that the Federal Consumer Protection Bureau
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.920]  is to monitor 80% of all credit card transactions live time to keep you safe and there to basically
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.320]  restrict citizen bloggers and private media groups who aren't working for the Fortune
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:32.480]  100. The bill has passed the Senate Committee saying openly that you don't have any anonymity.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:37.200]  You don't have journalistic protection. Protection of the First Amendment for your sources if
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:42.040]  you're not certified by the federal government. So that's another way they're waging war
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:47.280]  and the Drudge Report has properly called it fascism. And I have directed my reporters
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:51.520]  and my crew on the nightly news tonight to review the freedom of the press, the First
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:57.000]  Amendment and the war on it by cybersecurity, by homeland security and what's happening
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:04.320]  because this is the big issue. The Pentagon announcing they're going to engage in covert
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:10.200]  and overt propaganda against independent media, the real media. That's been, I mean that
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:15.000]  was a declaration of war a month and a half ago and now you see it happening. Cybersecurity
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.040]  saying they're going to target blogs that don't agree with US policy. They mean globalist
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:24.760]  banker policy. Propaganda is everywhere but look at how they go. Putin's defeating America.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:28.760]  Putin schools America. Knowing it's going to make Americans get mad and go well I'm
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.880]  going to support Obama. I don't want that Russian schooling America. He's not schooling
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:37.600]  America. He's schooling the globalist that have hijacked and occupied the country. And
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.920]  that's the talking point because it's the truth. What are my talking points? The truth.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:50.160]  America has been hijacked by offshore above the law mega banks and it is the real tea
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:55.640]  party not the one that Carl Rove tried to create to hijack. They've now given up the
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:00.720]  blue bloods have just given up their panicking. Whenever Carl Rove's on Fox he badmouts the
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:08.560]  real tea party and Ron Paul and Rand Paul. Whenever Obama's in a private meeting and
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:12.900]  it gets leaked or Biden and he's talking to their billionaire type folks that give millions
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:16.760]  a year. They're saying we got to do something about this tea party. They're dangerous. They
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:20.640]  could really take us out. They're the enemy and then Homeless Curtis says we're the terrorists
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:26.440]  because we're Americans. Pro gun, pro family, pro free market, pro constitution, pro rule
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:38.120]  of law. Man we are big huge wooden oak stakes and holy water and high noon to these people.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:44.120]  We are high noon to Count Dracula and Nosferatu and all the rest of these new world order
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:51.960]  scum ladies and gentlemen. We are, we are the end of them. She knows that they don't
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:58.680]  have any power. It's over. America socialist. Obama got reelected. Everybody has a mandate
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:05.080]  for communism now. Clearly election fraud. Clearly a ringer who ran against him. The
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:12.000]  guy that wrote with big industry, the Obamacare, you know, Orapacare, O Scamacare written by
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.680]  the foreign banks on record to absolutely just destroy our healthcare system and make
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:22.040]  you pay money to the big insurance companies owned by foreign banks. All of this came out.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:28.720]  All of this came out and now they're, they're red alerting on the Senate floor. They are
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:33.320]  red alerting going. These people are running the country and things aren't going to get
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:39.320]  better until we get rid of them. You globalists are running the country. No, no, no. We're
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:43.220]  not running it. We are running the agenda now because we're telling the truth and people
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:51.840]  resonate with it. I don't have teleprompters ladies and gentlemen. I've got a heart a prompter
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:57.680]  and a mind a prompter and historical research a prompter and a guts a prompter and a liberty
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:01.400]  prompter. You know what I'm looking for? I'm looking for them to be defeated and not
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:05.200]  get our guns and to get the floor out of the water and to get real vaccines out there that
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.760]  aren't filled with stuff on purpose to brain damage people and to get the GMO out of our
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:14.640]  food. That's what I'm ready to die to get liberty folks. That's all I care about. I'm
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:20.080]  not taking it personal. I mean, I'm all the way against these people and I'm alive and
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:25.720]  they can't deal with people like that folks. They cannot deal with us. We are the Americans.
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.760]  They are the enemy. Let's go to this clip of Harry Reid. I don't know if I can play the
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:34.680]  whole thing going into panic mode on the Senate floor about the Tea Party. Here it is.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:44.840]  I would also talk about my friend from Oklahoma. I know that he's smart and he and I understand
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:49.840]  it. But Madam President, just because you're smart doesn't mean you're always right. Madam
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:56.400]  President, we have a situation where this country has been driven by the Tea Party for the last
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:07.440]  number of years. When I was in school, I studied government and I learned about the anarchists.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:14.240]  Now they were different than the Tea Party because they were violent. But they were anarchists
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.760]  because they did not believe in government at any level and they acknowledged it. The
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:23.320]  Tea Party kind of hides that. They don't say we're against government. That's what it all
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:28.480]  amounts to. We're against rogue government. We're not doing physically destructive things
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:33.360]  to buildings and people, but directly. But they are doing everything they can to throw
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:40.560]  a monkey wrench into any form of government, whether it's local, whether it's state or
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:47.240]  federal government. That's what it's all about. And so anything they can do to throw a monkey
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:51.840]  wrench in the wheels of government, they're happy doing that. And I'm sorry to say my
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:58.240]  friend from Oklahoma is helping them, maybe not directly, but indirectly. And that's wrong.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:04.560]  Government is not inherently bad. Government is inherently good. That's why we have a Constitution.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:10.560]  Government is inherently good. Madam President, we have a situation where this country doesn't
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:16.400]  show that. Shut him up. Oh, what a tyrant. I mean, that is a flaming tyrant, folks. That's
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.160]  what Obama's saying. Don't listen to voices that say tyranny is always around the corner.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.840]  No, you're right. It's always in our living room. It's always taken over our lives. I
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:29.240]  mean, these people are by every benchmark, secret arrest, torture, all these wars, funding
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:36.080]  al-Qaeda, NSA surveillance of everybody, targeting the Tea Party. The head of the IRS got caught
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.600]  lying. Now she was ordered to target. She said in the memos, these people are dangerous.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:45.560]  We got to shut them down. Well, yeah, we're dangerous to authoritarians that like Mao
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:50.960]  Zedong. I mean, like half his czars promote Mao. I'm sorry we're freaked out that Mao
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:55.080]  killed 80 million people. I'm sorry we listened to George Washington about the danger of government.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:00.800]  I'm sorry we're Americans, you little piece of trash.

[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:02.720]  My name's Bruno. I'm 52 years old. I've tried different protein powders over the years and
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:06.640]  they've all tasted pretty bad. I tried One World Way and found it to be delicious. After
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.840]  10 weeks on One World Way, my wife commented, you have more muscles and you're leaner than
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.760]  when you were 20 years old. My body has changed dramatically. I'm a cyclist. Normally I'll
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:21.040]  ride two days on and take two days off. After being on One World Way, I rode 10 days in a
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:25.880]  row in over 100 degree heat and then I take another two servings of One World Way and
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:30.680]  work out at the gym for another hour and a half. I just couldn't believe these results.
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:35.160]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone. Don't take
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:40.360]  my word for it. One World Way comes in single servings. Just give it a try. For a health
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:51.520]  and taste sensation you'll love, call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325. Or

[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:26.000]  Welcome to Shut Down Free Speech on Talk Radio with the Orwellian named Fairness Doctrine.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.880]  Now it's passed the Senate Committee to have the government certify which journalistic
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:38.360]  operations will be allowed into events, will be allowed to basically have protection of
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:44.920]  their sources. You name it. It's extremely, extremely fascistic. What's going on? Joining
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:51.240]  us is Ray McGovern and he of course was one of the top briefers, a National Security Briefer
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:57.720]  for Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr. and he joins us in this segment and part of the
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:04.920]  next to break down exactly what we see happening. He's a native of New York and Washington.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:09.560]  He was an Army Infantry Officer during Vietnam. He served as a CIA analyst for the administration
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:15.520]  of John F. Kennedy to George H. W. Bush and he again was one of the most national high-level
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:20.040]  national security advisors from 81 to 85. He's fluent from everything in Russian to
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:24.360]  German to Spanish and I'm not going to get into all the rest of his degrees from Harvard
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:29.400]  and the rest of it. He's also a theologian. Good to have you with us. I want to get your
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:34.080]  take, sir, on the state of the world first. Give us a briefing on that. How historical
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:40.400]  this is. Could this be the beginning of the end of the Anglo-American Empire and what
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:45.440]  do you make of the entire Syria situation and the briefing you sent to the president
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:49.800]  last week, warning him of all the top analysts that you talked to, saying this was clearly
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:55.040]  a fraud by the rebels and now it appears that they're diplomatically being defeated but
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:59.960]  they're still escalating the military force and what they plan to do once Al Qaeda and
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:04.760]  Al Nuzra is in control of Syria. So, Ray McGovern, thank you for coming on, sir.
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:11.960]  You're most welcome, Alex. Well, let me just talk about Cui Bono. I think that's a good
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:21.760]  place to start. Cui Bono means who profits from all this? What country expects to profit
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:27.560]  from continual violence, the kind of things that we've seen in Syria for over two years
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:33.560]  now? And the answer to that is very simple. It's Israel. As long as the Sunni and the
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:39.520]  Shia are at each other's throats, and not only in Syria, by the way, but in the whole
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:45.960]  adjacent area, the better it is in terms of how the Israelis look at this. For this
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:52.680]  strategic planning, namely, they face a lot less threat from either Sunni or Shia as long
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:19:02.600]  as they're at each other's throats. Now, so, is there incentive for the Israelis to camp
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:08.760]  down that struggle? Well, not only is there no incentive for that, there is incentive
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:14.960]  for it to keep it going. It was a really interesting report in the New York Times of all places,
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:22.200]  Alex, on the 30th of August, and it talked about this young journalist and Jerusalem,
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:27.440]  who talked to senior Israeli officials, security and military officials, and she asked them,
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:32.080]  you know, what's the best outcome in Syria for Israel's interests? And they said, oh,
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:39.400]  that's easy. No outcome. And she said, I beg your pardon, no outcome. Just keep the pot
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:46.200]  boiling. We feel very secure as long as people kill each other and not kill us. And she exploded
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:50.400]  a little further, and she found out, in which there are amazement, that she might have listened
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:55.760]  to your program and been prepared for this, that Israel and its big patron, the United
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:02.480]  States of America, have this interest in not letting al-Qaeda win, of course, but keep
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:10.000]  the pot boiling. Now, how best to prevent al-Qaeda and al-Mustra from winning? Well,
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.360]  that's pretty simple. You get the U.S. in a ball.
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:21.040]  Now, John Kerry, who I think is one of those neo-conservatives, the definition of a neo-conservative,
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:28.240]  is a person who has great difficulty distinguishing between what he or she perceives to be the
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:33.440]  strategic interests of Israel, on the one hand, and the strategic interests of the United
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:41.000]  States, on the other. They tend to be synonymous in these people's minds. Now, I don't fault
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.040]  them for that. I mean, everybody seems out of the vote opinion, but they shouldn't be
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:50.880]  making policy for the United States of America if they think that everything Israel does
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:56.240]  or everything Israel wants. It's if so fact, though, the best thing for us Americans. It
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:03.360]  is not, it is demonstrably not. And John Kerry spends as much time over the area with Netanyahu
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.640]  and others over the last couple of months as anyone else.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:12.880]  Ostensibly, he was looking for a way to get the peace talks started again between the
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:19.360]  Palestinians and the Israelis. That came not only to NOS, it came to further settlements
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:25.040]  on the West Bank and other occupied territories, clearly illegal. And when the European said,
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:31.660]  you know that's illegal, we got to race the Israelis. But John Kerry was the first, no,
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:34.760]  no don't criticize the Israelis.
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:42.120]  We got to go to break when we come right back. And you go to that line if we look at the
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:46.840]  Israeli angle, then I want to look in general how this is going for the establishment. I
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:50.560]  the establishment. I want to get your take on that. We're on the march. The
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:57.600]  empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:03.640]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:07.720]  on health care? Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet? The
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:13.760]  highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease. It all comes
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:18.840]  down to one thing. We are what we eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:23.960]  processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled with toxic poisons and
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:29.080]  big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design. We can turn the
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:33.160]  tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body

[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:01.720]  here in a moment but Ray I wanted to throw this out at you first here look
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:07.560]  I've gone over this you've got Turkey wanting to expand its empire maybe grab
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:12.040]  a piece of Syria you've got Israel wanting to play Shiite off against Sunni
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:16.200]  and and and you've got the West wanting that in Egypt as well and Obama
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:21.360]  supporting that and you've got the military industrial complex 83% more
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:25.800]  money given to the senators that voted you know to vote the war resolution a
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:30.840]  few weeks ago out of the Senate or last week you've got all that going on you've
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:36.240]  got Obama with his seven scandals wanting a distraction and clearly Israel's
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:40.120]  tried to act like that they haven't been trying to play people off against each
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:44.040]  other I've had Israelis calling and saying no no we know this you know we
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:47.960]  know this is what's really going on and I believe as the Russians said and I
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:52.120]  said it before they said it that there may be chemical weapons launched by Al
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:57.560]  Nazra or other al-Qaeda groups against Israel as a wink-wink deal to allow it
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:00.840]  to go on and I know they do plan on having an American force when they quote
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:04.240]  implode it the thing Kerry says he doesn't want is what they admit is that
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.440]  the actual plan as you know in the Brzezinski type documents to go in and
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.840]  break it in at least two pieces maybe three and implode it let al-Qaeda get in
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:17.520]  and then say oh we got to go in to stop al-Qaeda so so I agree with your analysis
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.680]  completely my question for you is we know that's going on my audience knows
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:27.720]  that what I really want to pick your brain on is the 91% and Reuters poll
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:31.480]  against this the 500 to one phone calls to Congress on record Republican
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:35.440]  Democrat Rush Limbaugh saying it may be a false flag that's a big deal
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:41.240]  Glenn Beck saying false flag Ron Paul's Rand Paul Pat Buchanan the drudge
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:46.240]  report exposing it the the so-called libertarian right really actually
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:50.360]  acting like libertarians coming out against it while the so-called left has
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:54.360]  been cheerleading it I wanted your expertise on the sea change we're
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:58.560]  seeing if you believe that's one and many experts like dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:05.240]  myself folks of the New York Sun saying they believe this signifies the
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:09.400]  beginning of the implosion of the Anglo-American Empire that you know
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:14.760]  Israel's part of and social and the Saudi Arabia also wants a piece of this so
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:18.680]  how are they involved now I've given you a large question there try to try to
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:24.480]  give us your answer please sir well this is a major defeat for those who want to
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:30.040]  promote the Israel's objectives in Syria and elsewhere in that part of the world
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:37.600]  the president has been made to look rather ridiculous by depending on well
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:45.040]  the tough guys and now the tough gals in the White House and UN yeah then what's
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:50.240]  behind these years are like they don't know which side is up but what really
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:54.880]  happened here and if it's more than passing interest you'll recall that
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:31:00.640]  barely two weeks ago on August 30th John Kerry got up and said we know about
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:04.920]  these chemical weapons and we know that the outside is a really big out he said
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:10.320]  we know no less than 35 times okay and that was supposed to persuade right we're
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:13.160]  having trouble here and you can you put the cell phone close to your mouth thank
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:17.960]  you sure this is a little better oh that's night and day thank you please go
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:24.360]  ahead okay so he was asking us you know trust us trust us now they released the
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:30.240]  four-page document that was bereft of any detail that anyone could check and in
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:35.680]  that document itself it said well while we have high confidence in our
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:40.280]  assessment see everything is an assessment and nothing of it in the way
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:44.880]  of evidence was it used we have high confidence in our assessment and this is
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:52.000]  the next best thing to having it confirmed wow right so we know for
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:59.000]  to war without confirmation any this is true so what happened here is on that
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:05.440]  Friday night General Dempsey the chair and joint chiefs of staff or perhaps
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:09.160]  it was Saturday morning he got to the president of the United States and he
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.680]  said look mr. president that we know that you're very fond of those sophomores
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:15.600]  that you have around you there from the White House and those tough guys and
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:22.760]  gals but you know they don't know zilch about war we do okay and we're
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:27.360]  telling you that the notion we can do an extraordinarily clean strike and not
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:32.200]  expect retaliation well forget about it that's not the way it's going to be down
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:38.200]  okay now all every one of the joint chiefs of staff was against this thing
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:43.200]  Dempsey finally had the guts to stand up and say now mr. president not only do we
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:47.360]  think this is a fool's errand but you know I don't want to I don't want to have
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:51.200]  to answer the question that would inevitably be asked and that is what
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:55.520]  you have to do is now why couldn't you wait for you and inspectors you know
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:01.400]  shades of Iraq why couldn't you wait for the you inspectors to come forward you
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:07.000]  know we can do this mr. president tomorrow or next week or next month it
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:12.400]  doesn't make any difference so if they ask me that I'm gonna say be the hell out
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:15.400]  of me why don't you go ask the president or one of his smart little
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:21.800]  sophomores no he's not a two-fed language but that's what he told them and how
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:26.560]  do we know that well when the president got up and shocked everybody out of their
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:32.320]  mind less than less than a day later when he went into the rose garden and said
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:37.680]  precisely that he said that my chairman of the joint chiefs of staff tells me
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:42.240]  that there's no urgency here that we can do this today or tomorrow or next week
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:47.200]  or next month and so we're gonna go to Congress and get the authorization well
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:53.440]  what happened the next day John came John McCain and Lindsey Graham stormed
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:58.040]  into the White House came out after a half an hour and before the cameras they
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:01.800]  said the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has gone soft on this name screw
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.040]  the whole thing up he's told the president that he doesn't have to do
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.680]  he does have to do it he does have to do it may stamp their fate he said he does
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:12.800]  have to do it so what happened here is the president finally got some sense
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:18.200]  into it and with that support from the from the chairman of the joint chiefs
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:22.400]  of staff dissuading him from going ahead without congressional approval
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:26.520]  without international approval with no approval except for Samantha Power and
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:30.800]  Susan Rice and a couple of the other sophomores there he decided to do the
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:37.120]  right thing now as the week went on each attempt by the sophomores was
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:42.480]  counterproductive the opposition to a military strike on Kyrie grew instead of
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:46.240]  diminished and by the end of the week it looked like you would not only lose in
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:51.360]  the house whichever kind of a zone but in the Senate as well so what happens
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:56.280]  then well on Monday morning just this past Monday John Kerry is coming home
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:00.400]  right and he stops in London and he does a little press thing speaking from his
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:04.680]  speaking points and and that's how we asked him an unscripted question he said
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:10.200]  oh secretary Kerry could you tell me you know is there anything at all that that
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:14.680]  the Syrian regime could do now to to avoid being struck by the United States
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:19.000]  military forces and Kerry looks at me said yeah of course they can't they can
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.120]  that they can destroy all their chemical weapons or give them all with
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:26.720]  international control give a full accounting of them and yeah that would
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:30.520]  put it but that's not gonna happen that'll never happen
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:35.640]  this about 10 o'clock in the morning blend in time right then 30 months in time
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:41.560]  his spokesman and the State Department says well Secretary Kerry was just
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:46.040]  rhetorically saying that this might be great if you know it was just it was a
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:52.840]  rhetorical point he was making okay well now a later the Soviet the Russian
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:58.000]  Foreign Minister gets up a lot of us and he says hey how about a Syria
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.120]  destroying all those nuclear weapons under UN supervision and signing the
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:06.960]  treaty and we think these Syrians will agree to this and sure enough Syrians
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:12.760]  two hours later agree to it and Obama is sent a lifeline out of this
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:18.160]  ridiculous situation that he got himself into now why was it that Kerry was
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:24.680]  blindsided by this because the Russians know it Kerry doesn't want peace he's
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.000]  acting in favor of the Israel's interest he spent a lot of time with
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.640]  them yeah over the last few weeks at this is all very very well planned okay
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:35.960]  well I want to talk I want to talk big picture here because because it's on
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:39.640]  record that the rebels have been caught in Turkey with chemical weapons they've
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:44.080]  been caught loading them and firing them several times before this the
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.560]  propaganda in our media is pointed at the lowest commons denominator but it
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:52.920]  doesn't work because the military now knows we're arming al-Qaeda the military
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:58.320]  is freaking out you've got members of Congress calling it as a false flag so
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:04.760]  the whole agenda is falling and listen up my only issue is in the camps out
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:09.120]  there there are people that say Saudi Arabia is behind it or Israel's behind
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:14.280]  it or Obama wants a distraction I see it as as not taking guilt away from any
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:18.080]  of the groups but I see it as an alignment of interest a bunch of groups
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:22.120]  that politically and militarily and economically like what's happening but
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:26.280]  the world's waking up to how immoral it is you keep going back to Israel and I
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:31.280]  respect your your view and your research your sources are you saying that all of
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:37.680]  this is Israel I mean why is Saudi Arabia offering to pay for it then and and and
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:42.840]  because I mean you know we know Netanyahu wants this my only issue here is
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:47.800]  how is that going to help Israel if it turns into a regional war Iran attacks
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:53.880]  them Syria attacks them World War three starts which many analysts I'm gonna get
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:58.320]  your take on that say could happen because and then and then how could our
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:05.680]  leaders fumble and act so stupid and so inept and and also not eat and not
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:10.200]  even get their their talking point straight as a radio host I could do a
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:15.080]  better job sitting here watching I mean it's it's like they're folding it in or
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:20.200]  something the women are all prancing around swooping their hair around like
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:25.720]  they're on a model runway Kerry looks like he's mentally ill about to collapse
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:30.600]  in the hearings like he's dying or something I mean I look at the
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:36.040]  establishment and I've never seen a more mentally ill looking group and I've
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:40.760]  never talked like this it's like those who the gods will destroy they make you
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:47.440]  know insane first or ray I mean I mean the big picture here why you're right
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:54.560]  you're right to mention Iran Alex this is an extension of the whole thing your
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:59.120]  listeners probably know that there's a mutual defense treaty between Syria and
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:06.360]  Iran and part of the effort here is the bloody Syria and embarrass Iran I hear
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:11.960]  strange noises from my phone here so if we go off I'll get onto a landline but
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:18.120]  if we bloody Syria and Iran stands by idly not able to really defend their
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:23.720]  ally well everyone will look kind of silly but what they're hoping for is that
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:28.440]  Iran's will somebody be implicated and the Israelis can't head out for the US can
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:34.880]  sit out after Iran as well the Sunni Shia thing of course is all important here
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:39.880]  the Saudis the Sunni Iranians the Shia and so if there's a marriage of
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:43.960]  convenience here with the Saudis and the Israelis having common objective well
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:51.200]  the enemy of my enemy is my friend and so they are in cohoots on this now what
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:57.280]  I will mention here you mentioned the reports that actually was not the Syrian
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:03.440]  government but rather the rebels who were responsible for the chemical event
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:10.160]  there outside of the Damascus on the 21st of August there's the more there's
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:16.520]  more teeth than a report that was put out three days ago it's written by F. Michael
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:23.800]  Malouf and he he's reporting from a classified document that he got access
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:31.120]  to which shows that Sarin for example was available to the Nisraf Front and the
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:37.480]  secret no foreign document gives chapter and verse about how Turkey the
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:42.720]  Al Nusra Front and others not only had the capability to use Sarin but
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:48.040]  smuggled some into Syria which is kind of well known to the Turkish police and
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:55.000]  everyone else so there's this palpable reporting now that is checkoutable if I
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:03.480]  may use that adjective unlike the administration which depends on we assess
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:08.720]  this we assess that we have confidence in this assessment that there's not a
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:14.880]  shred of detail now the only other thing that really is interesting to know is
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:22.000]  that the Israelis apparently had a hand in this intercept that everyone had been
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.120]  saying shows that Assad knew about planned and all this kind of stuff that
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:35.080]  chemical events outside of Damascus well guess what if that intercept is
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:41.240]  available and if it says what the administration claims it says what should
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:45.400]  they do they should dispose it they should release it now people say oh no
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:52.720]  no and the Syrians would know that we're eavesdropping on them whoops are you
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:56.280]  still there yes I did hear a click on your phone I mean look bottom line
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:01.760]  Ray McGovern it's we know it's a fraud the world's seeing it so what do you
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:07.480]  expect to happen in the final equation what do you expect their next move what
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:12.640]  do you expect the Obama people to do next well I think Obama's learned a lot
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:18.080]  from this he's come out the smelling not like a rose at least not smelling as
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:23.800]  bad as he would have had he authorized his tax there is a prospect that Russia
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:30.760]  and we can get together and actually could Joel or force the various parties
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:36.480]  back to Geneva people say well Assad wouldn't go to Geneva that's a lie the
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:40.200]  Russian and then we could end this out of control civil war even give him an
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:45.960]  exit out of the country but then Turkey Israel and Saudi Arabia won't get to
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:50.480]  carve the nation up Ray McGovern thank you so much we're gonna come back with
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:54.480]  one more quick comment from you on how you think we can end all this and then
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:43:01.680]  we will go into the next hour we got Katy Perry's dad joining us hi there my

[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:29.180]  Ladies and Gentlemen I was brought up
[01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:32.660]  Aaptist living in Texas to be extremely pro-Israel
[01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:38.700]  Watching the Arab countries pile up and attack the country and I know there's all this old entity and all these
[01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:43.440]  I just want to beat the other the Shiites want to beat the Sunnis the Sunnis want to beat the Shiites
[01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:49.720]  There's different Israeli camps and assassinations and different government parties killing each other there
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:51.720]  So Israel is not even unified
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:57.060]  And I try to stay out of the whole you're either in the Israel camp or you're the Arab camp
[01:46:57.060 --> 01:47:01.500]  It's all just a complete mess and and I don't think America should be involved in it
[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:04.900]  I agree with Rand Paul when I separately
[01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:08.340]  Don't like the Israel lobby
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:13.880]  APEC through the ADL and Southern probably law center attacking me
[01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:20.940]  When I don't agree with everything Israel's doing because I'm not anti Jewish anti Israel and I should never stare and preface that
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:24.660]  You can criticize anybody you want, but if you criticize Obama
[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:28.820]  They say you're racist because he's black as Ed Asner said he's coming on Monday and
[01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:32.660]  If you criticize Israel you're anti-Semitic
[01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:38.540]  Well, I've seen polls in some cases of more than 60% of Israelis against new wars. Are they anti-Semitic?
[01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:40.620]  This is political correctness
[01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:46.780]  meant to control people and I think the the the Likudniks running Israel
[01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:49.820]  really are
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:54.340]  Going too far like like many other powerful countries have done
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:58.100]  They're biting off more than they can chew and the military's told Obama this
[01:47:58.540 --> 01:48:02.420]  But again, if it was just Israel wanting this and I'm here criticizing Israel
[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:07.460]  I think we get blinders on or or almost like tunnel vision where we need to look at the other
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:15.460]  Groups here too. So Saudi Arabia can be criticized and the arms makers that are lobbying for it because they're not the arms makers
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:18.220]  Aren't gonna have a future if we have World War three Ramah govern
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:22.340]  How do you see this ending? Where do you see this going?
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:27.780]  I saw it offered to give up as chemicals now they have spent the powers others saying doesn't matter
[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:29.780]  It's not about your chemicals
[01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:32.220]  And yeah, yeah
[01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:34.180]  Alex
[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:40.140]  It's a completely different situation right now. That was just barely two weeks ago
[01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:47.540]  Israel has been dealt a very serious setback and so has the Israeli lobby in this country
[01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:54.180]  Obama has been able to see through what they tried to do in terms of mouse-trapping him
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:57.940]  It's military for once that stood up and said look
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:05.980]  We're interested in fulfilling our promise to the Constitution to defend and protect against all enemies far and end domestic
[01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:11.660]  So what we have here now is a situation where Obama can move forward. It's gonna take a while
[01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:13.220]  It's gonna be terribly difficult
[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:20.020]  But he has the support of the country now and that's the new element the people have spoken but once they prevailed
[01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:28.220]  It you know every now and then Alex, it's possible to rejoice. Okay, that sounds funny coming from in intelligence professional
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:33.540]  But we dodged a big bullet and so did the Syrians we dodged another war
[01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:37.940]  We should rejoice in that. Now if I were Obama, what would I do? I
[01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:41.060]  Would take the people that deceived me
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:45.140]  I would take John Brennan and you know the admitted perjurer
[01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:49.700]  James Crapper. I would fire them. I would say look, you know
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:54.060]  Oh, what are you trying to give me plausible denial or not? You lied to me
[01:49:54.060 --> 01:50:01.260]  You put me up there and I looked really stupid because you know, you wouldn't even I couldn't even you're thinking from the
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:07.160]  Perspective if you were advising the president, but the question is he's so compromised and it's such a puppet
[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:11.900]  That's what's so scary is we've got all these special interests to think of they can do whatever they want
[01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:14.780]  But I agree with you. We should was it a rejoice
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:23.420]  In a collapse. Yeah, the problem is that you know, the president still needs a backbone implant and
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:30.060]  Exactly. Yeah, TW hospital that they're five years away from perfecting that you bet Ray. We're out of time

[01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:32.300]  On
[01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:40.260]  What's happening in the Middle East with Syria all I know is I don't look at the world in a Machiavellian way that's
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:43.300]  What ends up wrecking societies it works for a while
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:49.340]  But it's cheating of playing groups off against each other and bringing somebody down. So you're bigger
[01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:55.980]  Sure if somebody attacks you first
[01:52:55.980 --> 01:53:02.580]  Then you have a right to defend yourself and if Syria really ever attacked Israel well
[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:05.460]  Then Israel could take out that government, but they're not
[01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:10.780]  That's a government modernizing and trying to work with people just like Gaddafi and just like
[01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:13.780]  Egypt
[01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:17.460]  Egypt was best buddies with Israel and then
[01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:24.540]  The federal government and the State Department went in there and tried to finance
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:30.700]  The takeover by the radical Muslims of that area and I agree with Rain McGovern a lot of what he was saying
[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:37.140]  You know, I'm out of time with him, but I just want to be able to point out that there's more to this than just Israel and
[01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:42.300]  You know the numbskulls out there that just obsessed over Israel day and claim that I
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:47.940]  You know, I'm like covering up for Israel. I had Rain McGovern on to say all that
[01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:55.980]  I'm against the Syrian war. We're breaking the big news stories that have helped stop it. We're a big part of this recognized
[01:53:57.620 --> 01:53:59.620]  But I think it's important
[01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:07.700]  To also look at all the other interests, it's like if there's nine guys that rob a bank and
[01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:13.900]  And everybody, you know dislikes one particular bank robber more. Are we gonna not look at the other eight bank robbers?
[01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:16.180]  I mean if Israel disappeared tomorrow
[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:21.860]  You're still gonna have Saudi Arabia funding al Qaeda to take over the Middle East
[01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:29.620]  You're still gonna have a federal government that is gonna let al Qaeda come in and attack us so they can grandstand and take our rights
[01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:31.620]  Do you understand that?
[01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:39.060]  The communists Chinese are over there in China doing horrible stuff. They don't need any help from Israel all these other
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:41.340]  Groups, I mean humans just do the same stuff
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:44.980]  And I oppose tyranny
[01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:50.920]  Regardless of where it comes from and I have the moral high ground and the reason I harp on this is you see how they use political correctness
[01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:58.980]  Balkanization division as a way to control us all so that we're well, I'm an Israeli while I'm a Syrian while I'm a German
[01:54:58.980 --> 01:55:00.980]  I'm an American. I'm a whatever
[01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:05.340]  Well, I don't you know, I'm a I'm a Sunni so I'm gonna support to take over of Syria
[01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:12.460]  Because it's a secular government made up of a coalition of Sunni Shiites
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:15.060]  Alawites
[01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:17.060]  Jews Christians you name it
[01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:23.380]  And so you're gonna start a war a civil war bring troops in wreck them stage chemical attacks
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:28.660]  Try to give half the country to al Qaeda and the other half to
[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:30.660]  a
[01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:32.660]  Collection of other groups or wreck it
[01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:35.460]  Give Turkey a slice
[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:40.980]  Give Israel a slice and then break what's left up in a couple pieces. I mean, that's outrageously
[01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:48.940]  Immoral and wrong and if the ADL wants to say I'm anti-Semitic go ahead. I mean, it's a crazy land
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:53.620]  And I think that's what the American people have finally come to the point of
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:56.380]  but at the same time
[01:55:56.380 --> 01:56:00.460]  The frustration is is that there's more parties to this and
[01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:07.500]  If we just sit there and always blame Israel for everything it becomes a cop-out ladies and gentlemen
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:13.660]  Just like black folks that don't want to go get a job blaming on white people or white folks
[01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:18.420]  They don't want to go get a job blaming on Mexicans or you know, you hear it all ladies and gentlemen and
[01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:23.980]  And the world is really a complex situation
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:28.580]  And I'm trying to put out a nuanced thought process that I've studied from history
[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:33.620]  They can really bring us together and unify us around private property family
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:36.020]  due process and
[01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:43.780]  Honoring science and technology and uplifting the human spirit and beauty and art and that's really what I support
[01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:45.900]  I'm a fan of humanity
[01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:52.220]  I'm a fan of our potential and I want to see everybody live in peace black white Jewish German Chinese
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:55.060]  Latin American I
[01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:56.820]  want to see
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:58.820]  real freedom
[01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:06.260]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens and as a result

[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:37.900]  Hundreds of times more effective against viruses bacteria and fungus

[02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:23.960]  Breaking up on info wars.com
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:29.840]  DHS to test face-scanning cameras at Tri-City hockey game
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:38.200]  That's up on info wars.com and prison planet calm leader of Syrian rebel group called for attacks inside the US
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:44.560]  That's by the way and Reuters and London telegraph, but we go forward to point out
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:53.640]  He just so also happens to be the head of al-Qaeda being armed by NATO out of Jordan on record
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:59.080]  That's how dumb they think you are they launched the attacks. They run al-Qaeda
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:05.480]  They are the criminal occupational government that runs this country and they are consortium of corporate boards
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:11.400]  We really study it that meet at the North American Union meetings that have been leaked and declassified
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:16.520]  And you'll have all these different interests the leaders of each country a bunch of corporate heads
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:21.320]  And it's it's like Bilderberger Davos and they sit there and decide what they're going to do
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:28.680]  The problem is our own military said they won't follow the orders even general Dempsey you I've been critical of
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:32.480]  It's been confirmed told Obama. This is insane
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.840]  We have intel the Russians are gonna fight us. You ready to start World War three bud
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:42.200]  Because the military all knows their arm and al-Qaeda they followed those orders
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:45.680]  They all know they're murdering the Christians in mass and two million have fled
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:49.840]  Look it up two million have fled Syria. That's associated press
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:54.000]  Mainly Christians and they're smart look at their heads chopped off
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:59.000]  Turkey's trying to not let him get out Jordan's trying to not let him get out Israel's trying to not let him get out
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  I mean that is vicious and
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:04.280]  Christian churches all across this country won't even criticize it
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:07.360]  Because if Christians need to have their heads cut off by al-Qaeda
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:13.320]  So we can have the Sunnis and Shiites kill each other. Well, that's just the way it is. It is unbelievably
[02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:16.040]  immoral
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:19.920]  But here's this article out of live science
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:27.680]  Drivers identities verified by brainwaves and auto companies are moving towards a brainwave
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:31.240]  biometric fingerprint
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:36.160]  To open and start your car you think thumb printing and the new iPhones where they're gonna stop
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:46.280]  In 2002 at five US airports, this was CBS news they were testing passive MRI brain scanners
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:48.600]  Do you have any idea how powerful that is?
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:55.640]  Passive MRI brain scanners were already in the airports. I mean, that's why the elite are on such power trips
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:59.280]  They've already GMO'd all the food to manipulate our genetics on record
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:05.520]  They've got to get control of the world. They can't have any country you can run to Russia, Syria, any of it
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:10.520]  Well, those countries are good or bad because it's world government folks and you've got to be inoculated
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:17.640]  You've got to be fluoridated. You've got to be soft killed. So you're weak and diseased and poisoned ahead of their master plan
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:25.920]  Before I get to the attack on the press I want to show TV viewers radio listeners can just go to these go to these headlines
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:28.600]  This is from the Daily Mail
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:32.120]  It is also in
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:35.440]  CNET news that CBS news puts that out and
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:39.960]  It's also in an article we did before all of them back in July on
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:44.380]  Prisonplanet.com by Paul Joseph Watson
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:51.880]  Professor robots to patrol cities by 2040. What are these headlines that came out today killer robots and crippling cyber attacks?
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:56.960]  How the world is going to end according to super brains such as Stephen Hawking the physicist
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:00.120]  An extremely accurate
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:05.880]  Futurist and then it goes into other top futurists saying the exact same thing see we've interviewed them
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:08.760]  We've read their white papers. I concur with their analysis
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:14.240]  We've probably interviewed. I don't know let's not exaggerate 30 or 40 of these futurists top ones
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:20.760]  Up of the years here on this show that's interviewed one of the top robotics experts that works with Kurzweil last night of the night he knows
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:24.800]  Roman Yonpolski
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:25.920]  Now
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:32.040]  We cover this and and what does the White House do to us White House responded? They're very upset
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:34.760]  They've taken out a context what I said
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:38.240]  Sandwiches together and again media matters doesn't matter
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:43.000]  Except that when they put something out then raw story salon
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000]  All the other big
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:52.640]  Fascist I'm not just so they are fascist. I mean I saw a salon on CNN last night promoting the war and how wonderful it was
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:54.640]  I mean, it's just sick
[02:04:55.600 --> 02:04:57.600]  One of the riders
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:01.680]  But because they talk on the list, it's okay, I don't understand that it's like
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:05.220]  It says here's raw story following the White House directive
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:12.660]  Syrian diplomacy a plot to extinguish humans so Obama and elitist can be cyborgs and
[02:05:12.700 --> 02:05:18.180]  It got picked up again up by a bunch of other publications first that came up from the White House run
[02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:24.340]  I mean a notepad's not a big deal either, but it gets picked up. So that's why it's important is to see the propaganda
[02:05:24.620 --> 02:05:26.620]  Alex Jones links Syrian
[02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:30.620]  Weapons proposal to human extinction plot
[02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:38.180]  Jones globalist theory connects weapons inspectors of plans for replacing humans with new species of human machine hybrids
[02:05:38.180 --> 02:05:42.740]  I was just going off what they openly say now not just so just Stephen Hawking
[02:05:42.740 --> 02:05:46.500]  He gets into all that and says that will result in a giant robot war and kill everybody
[02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:53.660]  Of course, I was quoting all those guys yesterday too in that full breakdown, but they can take that try to make it sound weird
[02:05:54.300 --> 02:05:56.300]  This is the same government-run media
[02:05:56.300 --> 02:06:02.060]  That tells you that the northern and southern ice caps are the smallest ever recorded
[02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:11.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, NASA admits that it is the largest recorded since they had satellites in the 1950s
[02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:17.380]  You go to the Daily Mail. You can go to NASA. Here it is right here. It shows the August
[02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:21.220]  2012 ice cap the August 2013 ice cap is
[02:06:21.220 --> 02:06:27.460]  Is this is the the the earliest closing in a very long time of
[02:06:27.980 --> 02:06:34.700]  The northern passage where ships are normally able to go even into October or so through there by August
[02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:36.460]  It was already frozen shut
[02:06:36.460 --> 02:06:39.700]  We're only the biggest icebreakers who goes through the southern areas. Okay now
[02:06:40.220 --> 02:06:41.660]  Now again folks
[02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:45.060]  This is how they lie to you because I played it a few weeks ago
[02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:49.180]  We have the clip CNN said the ice caps the smallest ever the polar bears are all dying
[02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:54.900]  Now the polar bear numbers are up five fold. Just look that up just type in all polar bear numbers explode. It's all on record
[02:06:55.860 --> 02:06:59.060]  They've exploded five times in northern Europe where they checked them
[02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:04.980]  I think they said four times in Russia and they just admit in some areas as much as ten times in North America
[02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:07.940]  They don't have an actual number. They're just they're all over the place
[02:07:09.140 --> 02:07:11.140]  and
[02:07:11.260 --> 02:07:15.820]  That's because they restrict hunting of them a lot now so they're running around like roaches basically
[02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:20.380]  I think it's a beautiful cool animal, but you know, then they get now the new thing is well some are starving
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:24.860]  Well, some have always starved so the strongest survive that that's how this works
[02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:30.020]  But see they don't want us to be able to be on air and point all of this out
[02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:34.380]  They don't want us on air pointing all the things that are being
[02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:37.500]  Put into place here
[02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:41.140]  They don't want
[02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:46.060]  The American people with people the world ever get into reality
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:51.540]  And by the way, the public smart people can learn all about every automobile and be collectors
[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:53.540]  They can learn about every
[02:07:54.060 --> 02:07:56.060]  You know conceivable thing that you can imagine
[02:07:57.260 --> 02:07:58.860]  baseball scores
[02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:00.500]  You name it
[02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:03.700]  But they can't learn about the ice sheets
[02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:10.700]  They can't learn about forms of government because all that's boring. They make it boring. I
[02:08:11.220 --> 02:08:16.260]  Had the former head of the Department of Education on about this. They had a policy. They were there in the 80s
[02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:23.740]  Saying we're here to make this boring. We're here to dumb it down so that people never get the bug of
[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:27.420]  To learn and become creative and they've done it
[02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:29.940]  They've got a bunch of unimaginative people
[02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:37.980]  who don't care about any of this and so so so now they're demonizing anybody that points out what's really going on, you know
[02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:41.700]  I I say I'm glad that they're going to give up their WMD. So this war doesn't happen
[02:08:42.460 --> 02:08:46.260]  But see that still is damned of you damn if you don't because it sets the precedent
[02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:50.020]  Where
[02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:55.820]  Then the West says you've got to give your weapons up that are legal and then they could come in and take everybody else's weapons on earth
[02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:59.980]  Until only the globalists have the weapons and then they can come in and take over your country
[02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:07.300]  Anyways, we don't have the weapons like Iraq and that's part of the global government plan is to bring in the drones and bring in the automation
[02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:14.980]  So that then the military can't refuse the orders to attack and
[02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:21.500]  The elite are delusional and believe they're going to merge with machines and live forever and then I quote Ray Kurzweil and all of them and
[02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:24.540]  Then they come out and say
[02:09:24.540 --> 02:09:29.900]  Alex Jones made this up not Alex Jones showed you the megalomaniacal
[02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:35.660]  Power-tripping delusion, you know, I told you they were going to try to bring a fairness doctor into the internet
[02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:39.020]  and that they were going to
[02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:48.660]  Come in and try to restrict free speech and actually have a stack of news on that that I haven't even gotten to yet
[02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:51.780]  The announcement has been made
[02:09:51.780 --> 02:09:57.500]  That Verizon and others are saying the internet is going to be pay as you go. Well, that's agenda
[02:09:58.220 --> 02:10:02.020]  For internet to always is to phase out the old web and basically make it a toll road
[02:10:02.020 --> 02:10:05.780]  You already paid for it over and over again with your connection the rest of it
[02:10:05.780 --> 02:10:09.260]  It's about the power structure grabbing it and making it a monopoly
[02:10:09.260 --> 02:10:13.940]  That's what they always do and that's Diane Feinstein's gotten the bill passed out of the Senate committee
[02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:20.260]  To basically start going after and taxing and regulating and not letting you have
[02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:21.620]  a
[02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:22.940]  journalistic
[02:10:22.940 --> 02:10:27.660]  Sources getting rid of the first amendment for people that are not federally certified
[02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:30.660]  And now they're announcing. Oh
[02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:37.420]  Federal Consumer Protection Bureau to monitor 80% of all credit card transactions. See they're mainlining NSA spying
[02:10:37.420 --> 02:10:42.020]  They're already doing that, but they're like, oh now we're going to monitor all your credit card stuff for your safety
[02:10:42.660 --> 02:10:44.860]  Now it's going to be the government contacting you
[02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:48.500]  Now it's going to be the government
[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:50.500]  Contacting you not
[02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:53.820]  the bank about every time I go out of town and
[02:10:55.260 --> 02:10:57.260]  I bought dinner somewhere a hotel
[02:10:57.660 --> 02:11:00.660]  Also, I go to buy my credit cards turned off. They go sir. Sorry
[02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:03.900]  So I take like three so that as the credit cards are turned off
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:08.700]  I can go to the next one and then call the bank and give them 18 codes and all the rest of it
[02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:15.380]  And then they're going to say oh biometrics is the answer old brain scannings the answer to activate your that's being announced by the way
[02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:21.780]  They'll probably have another White House written article Jones claims. They'll brain scan you to use your credit card
[02:11:21.780 --> 02:11:25.020]  No, they'll just brain scan you and connect it to your bank account
[02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:27.620]  And then once it's all tied to you
[02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:33.020]  They can totally control everything you do or you'll be blackballed from not being able to buy or sell
[02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:39.260]  And that's the announcement they're making. Oh, haven't paid the IRS. You can't leave the US. They're trying to pass a bill
[02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:46.140]  No judge no jury now. They're saying by the way, we want the bill where you can't travel outside your state
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:50.740]  And we're gonna have checkpoints like the border to leave your state

[02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:48.220]  Miley Cyrus and the rest of it. We're gonna talk a bunch about his daughter
[02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:53.660]  Here today. I wanted to get him on as I already was a listener from it was Dave Mustaine told me
[02:16:53.660 --> 02:16:57.380]  But the point is we contacted him. He was a listener and I've read the book now
[02:16:57.380 --> 02:17:02.660]  It's a short little book very interesting very informative. I wanted to get him on. He's on the road via cell phone
[02:17:02.660 --> 02:17:10.900]  From his perspective to you know talk about what why the system he thinks is is targeting the youth and
[02:17:11.700 --> 02:17:14.420]  But but specifically sir, we didn't get you on about your daughter
[02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:19.020]  But that'll be a big point of interest if I don't get it out of the way. There's been a lot of stuff in the media
[02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:24.700]  Just to get it out of the way that people brought up saying that you said about your daughter that you didn't say
[02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:26.860]  So I'd like to give you a chance to declare that up
[02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:32.940]  But then give your take on general about the youth and and and what we see happening in society, sir
[02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:36.340]  Hey Alex. Hey, thank you so much for
[02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:45.100]  Allow me to be on I really counted a privilege honor listen. I mean I've been listening somebody told me about two years ago
[02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:50.620]  They said you kind of hear this guy Alex Jones and and they said this to me
[02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:55.260]  He says they tell he tells the truth about what's really happening in a minute
[02:17:55.260 --> 02:18:01.780]  I heard that the word truth because I'm a Christian and I read the Bible the Bible says you should know the truth and the truth
[02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:07.060]  They'll make you please so I say well, I've had a hook it up and then after that it was history. I've been
[02:18:07.980 --> 02:18:10.860]  Listening to you. I listened to you almost every day
[02:18:10.860 --> 02:18:18.420]  I I just say to your listeners if you're a Christian you should listen to this program because you really do I appreciate
[02:18:19.220 --> 02:18:21.980]  You know, you're out there like we all are out there
[02:18:21.980 --> 02:18:26.740]  Of course, you know, we're in the public. We get we get blasted for a lot of things
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:35.420]  That we say there are said that we said that would never say it or where they pick that up from and but I commend you Alex
[02:18:35.420 --> 02:18:41.580]  And you know, I don't need to allow, you know, I'm capable to do this program because you've had so many
[02:18:42.700 --> 02:18:49.260]  Incredible, I mean incredible people of magnitude. I feel like a hot dog in a mistake factory
[02:18:49.260 --> 02:18:54.980]  Haha, that's not true. Are you kidding? Oh, you know, I read your book. Well, we got it a few days ago
[02:18:54.980 --> 02:19:00.660]  And it's a it's a great read. I agree with with so much evidence. It's really spot-on from my humble perspective
[02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:07.380]  But I'm interested because I've got two daughters and a son and they're great with their firecrackers
[02:19:07.820 --> 02:19:11.100]  Of what they're gonna do, you know, I think of the stuff I did when I was younger
[02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:14.940]  And I'm a totally different person now than I was then I was pretty bad
[02:19:14.940 --> 02:19:19.340]  In fact, I was probably a lot worse than a lot of people you see in rock and roll and stuff on TV
[02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:22.980]  But but I'm joined the crowd. I think you're uniquely
[02:19:25.340 --> 02:19:29.900]  Authorized to be in a perspective to be able to write a book about the youth today
[02:19:30.940 --> 02:19:34.860]  Yeah, you know to because of my daughter is giving us a platform
[02:19:34.860 --> 02:19:40.420]  I don't I just let people know we don't use our daughter. I have great relationship. I believe family first
[02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:43.580]  I've been in the ministry 41 years and
[02:19:43.580 --> 02:19:45.100]  and
[02:19:45.100 --> 02:19:51.020]  Family has always been first and we protect each other and we take time off for each other
[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:53.180]  Even if our schedules are really busy
[02:19:53.900 --> 02:19:55.900]  We we spend all our
[02:19:56.580 --> 02:20:03.180]  Vacation or Thanksgiving Christmas and all those and we because I really believe you know when the lights are off and the music is over
[02:20:03.700 --> 02:20:11.020]  Everybody's gone. Only thing you have is your family and we need to really protect our family and you know
[02:20:11.020 --> 02:20:19.140]  My daughter's out there. She's born it big and wide and I mean, you know, but I have been given the platform for the youth
[02:20:19.140 --> 02:20:21.140]  And I'm a little different. I'm not sure
[02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:28.500]  She would say your old-school type preacher, you know, I'm I you know, I looked at I've seen things a lot
[02:20:29.220 --> 02:20:35.340]  Different that this generation is not looking for the church Jesus or a religious Jesus
[02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:41.420]  They just want the real Jesus and I share that with people and I get the opportunity God's given us
[02:20:42.620 --> 02:20:45.300]  Platforms to go and talk to some main line
[02:20:46.140 --> 02:20:52.900]  Musicians and entertainers and stuff. I can't mention the names, but you know, and they're all interested because you know what I share with them
[02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:58.220]  In general, it's just a real love. It's just not a bunch of rules and regulations
[02:20:58.220 --> 02:21:01.380]  And you know, I've been through a lot of different movements and seen where
[02:21:01.380 --> 02:21:08.980]  The church is just handed down a lot of things that they've never had to do with with God and it's run people off
[02:21:09.300 --> 02:21:16.740]  So I my basic message is the love that changed my life and everybody's born to be loved and everybody wants to be loved
[02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:20.740]  And so we've had great opportunities. We're reaching out
[02:21:21.300 --> 02:21:23.300]  this generation and such a
[02:21:24.060 --> 02:21:30.620]  A great way and they're listening it. Well, Keith. Well, they certainly are Keith Hudson stay there Keith Hudson
[02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:33.580]  calm the book looking and seeing I
[02:21:34.260 --> 02:21:35.740]  Want to talk about
[02:21:35.740 --> 02:21:39.500]  What God sees versus what people that are in the world see?

[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:24.680]  Katy Perry's father calls her a devil child in sermon report. That was up
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:31.440]  Or or dot org excuse me that was put out by the New York Daily News with no proof and no video
[02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:37.160]  I want to give you the opportunity again here on air to explain that you didn't say that and then what your view
[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:43.560]  Overall just of rock and roll and where it's all going and Molly Cyrus and all the rest of it and then we're going to shift gears
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:46.640]  into
[02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:49.760]  Overall where you think the state of the world is today, sir
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:55.120]  Well, Alex had a statement that came out about a month and a half two months ago
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:56.800]  I guess and then
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:02.800]  They said that I made the statement. I called my daughter a devil child, which is not true
[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:06.540]  And I would never do that. Like I said in the beginning of this
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:11.840]  Are talking there that my family's first has always been first never ministry never work
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:17.800]  And I believe we have to really realize that the only thing we do have is our family and they're most important
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:23.720]  And I know there's a lot of things that have been put out there on me not a lot
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:29.440]  But like stuff on you they put out there that you choose say they did say but I can tell you for a fact
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:31.440]  I did not ever say there's no proof
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:35.320]  There's nothing on video and nothing on on the
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:44.560]  You know all the tapes are sure well MSNBC says that I'm a deeply racist and can't show one clip of
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:48.800]  Me saying anything racist my lawyer said I could definitely win in court, but then I'd spend
[02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:54.520]  Years probably beating them and tons of money and you know, they're so discredited. That's just the way it is
[02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:56.440]  but specifically
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:27:02.160]  Obviously, I think God is going to use some of the trials and tribulations that people's children have
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:06.080]  Yeah, you know to help them learn more, but also you have the prodigal son
[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:10.960]  I mean, I I think of all the rock-and-roll out there that's so popular your daughter's pretty tame
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:16.360]  Compared to some of the stuff that other people are involved in but specifically because I have daughters
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:19.920]  I want to understand this from you who are a lot younger, you know five and five and nine
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:22.640]  You know you you raise somebody Christian
[02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:26.700]  They're a very successful singer as a Christian and then obviously, you know the big powerful
[02:27:26.700 --> 02:27:32.940]  Worldly stuff comes in and who can refuse when they're 18 years older or whatever and then she gets married to Russell Brand
[02:27:32.940 --> 02:27:37.620]  Who I think is waking up and is a good guy overall. You said some stuff off air to me
[02:27:37.620 --> 02:27:42.020]  You know nice stuff and and again, we're not judging people's the point
[02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:43.620]  right
[02:27:43.620 --> 02:27:48.660]  Yeah, we you know and I you know like I said I support my daughter
[02:27:48.660 --> 02:27:54.860]  I support I've got a son and another daughter and they're just as important to us but to me is
[02:27:54.860 --> 02:28:01.460]  Is my as Katie is and you know, I just think you know the generation that we're living in big
[02:28:01.460 --> 02:28:05.820]  You know, they really want to be loved and they want to worship
[02:28:06.140 --> 02:28:09.420]  but they're running after all these musicians and everything and
[02:28:10.340 --> 02:28:12.340]  unfortunately, you know
[02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:14.980]  It's the long things look at but
[02:28:15.780 --> 02:28:17.780]  That's what I want to get into
[02:28:17.780 --> 02:28:20.780]  Sorry, go ahead. Go ahead. No, I'm just
[02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:26.540]  Go ahead. Oh, you go ahead. Well, you know, it's it's very unique out there
[02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:33.820]  Because you know, we travel all over the world. This is our 41st year full-time in the ministry
[02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:35.820]  We we go to about eight countries
[02:28:35.980 --> 02:28:41.820]  And then we go all the United States were somewhere different and different place different city of different nation
[02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:48.300]  They're almost every week. So I get a good perspective of what's taking place in this generation in there
[02:28:48.300 --> 02:28:55.460]  And it's different and you know, we have to learn in my book looking and seeing I share that like you said
[02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:57.220]  We have to start seeing
[02:28:57.220 --> 02:29:03.980]  this generation with our heart and not with our eyes and quit judging people because of their tattoos or their
[02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:07.940]  Earrings or the color of their hair. I was in the Yipi movement in the 60s
[02:29:07.940 --> 02:29:12.820]  And you know, we were totally different. So everybody judges about our hair and everybody judges because our
[02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:18.540]  God our t-shirt stuff, but we have to approach people with love and that's what changes people's lives
[02:29:18.540 --> 02:29:22.780]  And that's the gospel. I mean, I'm a minister and I and you know
[02:29:22.780 --> 02:29:29.580]  I get a lot of results because I don't come in with a lot of rules and regulations and a lot of stipulations and a lot of things
[02:29:29.580 --> 02:29:35.540]  You can't do and you can't do this. You can't wear that you can't go there and you can't it's just it's not God period
[02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:41.740]  Well, all that does is is being a Pharisee runs everybody off instead of bringing them in look what Christ did
[02:29:41.740 --> 02:29:47.780]  The Pharisees were always you're hanging out with hookers. You're hanging out with with tax collectors. You're hanging out with
[02:29:48.340 --> 02:29:51.620]  Fishmongers you need to come up here and be with the elite
[02:29:51.620 --> 02:29:55.980]  He said look you go pray up on the top of the hill and show off and tell us how good you are all day
[02:29:55.980 --> 02:29:57.980]  All you're doing is running people off
[02:29:58.740 --> 02:30:01.860]  All right, and that's what I think we've done in the past
[02:30:01.860 --> 02:30:08.380]  I think it's changing though. There's there's there's a real change going on and and I think there is
[02:30:08.380 --> 02:30:12.580]  But this generation there's a hunger to know the real God
[02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:18.260]  There really is there is I see that in the young people and once they connect man
[02:30:18.260 --> 02:30:21.380]  it's just it's incredible the passion and
[02:30:22.380 --> 02:30:30.260]  The things that are taking place and and I'm seeing it all over the world. I mean all over. I'm it's just been incredible
[02:30:30.260 --> 02:30:32.740]  I want to shift gears to your book because
[02:30:32.740 --> 02:30:39.380]  Because I have never been obsessed with celebrity. It's interesting to meet somebody you think that you admire
[02:30:39.900 --> 02:30:45.300]  Someone's book you read that was powerful or or a musician whose music you love then it's interesting
[02:30:45.300 --> 02:30:48.620]  But if I don't like your music if I don't like your films if I don't like your book
[02:30:49.580 --> 02:30:51.580]  Then I could care less
[02:30:53.260 --> 02:30:57.660]  About you and I don't want to say mean things. I don't want to single out artists or filmmakers
[02:30:57.660 --> 02:31:02.940]  But if people that are popular, but I think is crud. I mean I'd walk the other side of the street
[02:31:02.940 --> 02:31:05.620]  Not to meet you because you're probably an ego maniac and that's boring
[02:31:05.620 --> 02:31:12.840]  And so getting passed kind of like Aston Kutcher recently said what's gonna fulfill people is not caring about celebrity anymore and
[02:31:13.300 --> 02:31:19.060]  Realizing that they're fulfilled and realizing that there's limited slots out there to be a celebrity and realizing
[02:31:19.060 --> 02:31:26.180]  There's a lot of baggage that comes with being that and that Madison Avenue has sold the idea that these idols can fulfill you
[02:31:26.180 --> 02:31:29.860]  Only so they can sell you a product when you're already basically
[02:31:30.620 --> 02:31:35.740]  Fulfilled and I think that's what your book basically says and and you know, you've had a bird's-eye view of it
[02:31:36.260 --> 02:31:41.660]  As well and what it does to people because I know that there's a spirit and as a pastor
[02:31:41.660 --> 02:31:44.300]  I want to hear what you think this is sir. I want to give you the floor
[02:31:44.500 --> 02:31:45.540]  Yeah
[02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:50.860]  Can I say to you know, I'm I've been around a lot of these celebrities and some of them I be honest with you
[02:31:50.860 --> 02:31:57.780]  They're it they're distasteful. You like you said, you don't want to be around. They've got an attitude. There's so much into their self
[02:31:57.780 --> 02:32:02.940]  I can say about my daughter. I believe the reason my daughter is loved and
[02:32:03.940 --> 02:32:06.740]  Is because she really loves people
[02:32:07.260 --> 02:32:11.660]  She really does and I've been feel that my wife and I've been feel that in her life
[02:32:11.660 --> 02:32:17.340]  Because she was a little girl and she really cares about people and she and I'll always said keep your feet on the ground
[02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:24.540]  You know because you know certainly yeah, I mean, I mean she comes off as a very sweet and passionate person
[02:32:24.540 --> 02:32:26.540]  I wasn't I wasn't from the oblique
[02:32:27.140 --> 02:32:30.020]  Or an obtuse way talking about her. I'm specifically
[02:32:30.620 --> 02:32:36.300]  I'm specifically talking about in the full question my question for you pastor because I want your insight on this
[02:32:36.300 --> 02:32:38.960]  Yeah, is there's a spirit not in the celebrities
[02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:45.740]  But in the general public who's looking for something when they can already find you know God in their heart
[02:32:45.740 --> 02:32:51.340]  People are looking and looking and and going crazy all around me
[02:32:52.380 --> 02:32:54.380]  Believing they're gonna become
[02:32:54.460 --> 02:33:01.960]  Celebrities or they're gonna become movie stars or they're gonna become this and that and there is this crazed spirit of narcissism
[02:33:03.060 --> 02:33:07.060]  Sweeping the world right now that I really think is a spirit. What do you say to that?
[02:33:07.620 --> 02:33:10.260]  Well, yeah, I think it's it's well
[02:33:10.260 --> 02:33:17.180]  it's the antichrist spirit the course has been released in the earth and and it comes in many different shapes and different forms and
[02:33:17.700 --> 02:33:21.100]  You know thing about this generation also. I noticed is they're all
[02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:23.500]  called up and in the
[02:33:23.500 --> 02:33:28.180]  Tweeting and and the Facebook and everything and and to be honest with you a lot of them
[02:33:28.940 --> 02:33:33.980]  They don't know anything about what's really taking place in the real world
[02:33:33.980 --> 02:33:40.580]  They just know about their friends and who's the latest pop singer and the latest song
[02:33:40.580 --> 02:33:45.420]  And and they're all into that but most of them wouldn't even know if Moses came back on the earth
[02:33:45.420 --> 02:33:49.740]  You know, I mean, I mean, they're just so caught up in the social media of
[02:33:50.300 --> 02:33:54.380]  themselves and and the latest ad and the latest color and
[02:33:54.620 --> 02:34:00.140]  It's crazy and they I mean you ask them that they know nothing about what's going on our government
[02:34:00.140 --> 02:34:07.020]  What's behind they like the president because he's cool, you know, nothing they don't research about all that
[02:34:07.020 --> 02:34:10.340]  You know, just see what's really you just said it. It is a projection
[02:34:11.340 --> 02:34:16.900]  To cover up reality and get people obsessed with false reality so they can be enslaved
[02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:21.020]  Yeah, exactly. It's and I mean it's out there
[02:34:21.700 --> 02:34:23.580]  big time
[02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:25.900]  What do you make of the current state of the world?
[02:34:25.900 --> 02:34:34.540]  Where you've got where all the sides are being corrupt like like it's it's wrong that Israel is is helping al-Qaeda attack Serbia
[02:34:34.940 --> 02:34:36.540]  But it's wrong
[02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:40.500]  Or helping al-Qaeda they did that as well helping al-Qaeda attack Syria
[02:34:40.500 --> 02:34:48.340]  It's wrong that Iran is trying to fund Hezbollah to attack Israel. It's wrong that NATO is trying to help al-Qaeda
[02:34:48.340 --> 02:34:50.660]  I mean, it's just all over the place
[02:34:51.540 --> 02:34:53.540]  Where are the good guys?
[02:34:53.540 --> 02:34:57.820]  Well, I tell you there is some good guys, but they're hard to find you're one of them
[02:34:58.140 --> 02:35:02.340]  There's some voices out there Paul says in the scriptures. There's many voices
[02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:07.380]  But you know what you have a voice and you need to know that and I and I know
[02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:14.180]  You know, I'm coming from me. I'm not very much of nothing, but I'm telling you you're making an impact
[02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:21.180]  Upon this nation. I believe this nation is like a spaceship off course and it's running
[02:35:21.180 --> 02:35:24.120]  I mean, it's crazy and it's in it, but too
[02:35:24.540 --> 02:35:31.420]  We have to realize it, you know, your listeners are some that maybe don't believe in God and those are probably a lot of them to do
[02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:36.860]  But but it's Bible prophecy things are being set up for this in time, you know
[02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:44.280]  And now I can see it all taking place. I think over the years. I've seen it, you know, I think Bible prophecy come
[02:35:44.900 --> 02:35:47.660]  To pass in the front page of the newspaper
[02:35:47.660 --> 02:35:51.900]  Incredible I agree and they use they use preachers
[02:35:51.900 --> 02:35:55.260]  I always put a date on it and they give it attention to discredit it
[02:35:55.260 --> 02:36:00.060]  But look at the casual society look at the world government. Look at Gog and Magog
[02:36:00.380 --> 02:36:03.540]  Look at everything that that that revelations predicts
[02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:08.660]  How could a science fiction book from 2,000 years ago be so accurate?
[02:36:09.460 --> 02:36:14.860]  Well, I was in a movie just recently and it was about the end
[02:36:14.860 --> 02:36:19.340]  And I looked at my wife and it wasn't a biblical movie. It was just a way
[02:36:19.340 --> 02:36:22.140]  I can remember which one it was but I said, you know what some of these
[02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:30.660]  Producers and things they're they're forecasting what this could be like. I mean, they're seeing something even in the in the movies
[02:36:30.660 --> 02:36:36.740]  They're seeing it something in and unfortunately, you know, that's why I think it's important for us and I'm not
[02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:39.660]  Preaching to your listeners
[02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:45.620]  But you know, we've got to to walk with God because I think things are going to get worse. I think, you know
[02:36:46.460 --> 02:36:50.420]  I'm not a doom and gloom person, but you can just see it happening
[02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:55.100]  I mean, we hear it when I listen to you and and study other things look around
[02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:58.860]  I mean, it's just happening left and right and it's happening, you know, really quick
[02:36:58.860 --> 02:37:03.780]  So I I just tell people just get close to God and stay stay there because that's the only security
[02:37:04.140 --> 02:37:06.900]  When it comes down to everything that we have I
[02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:08.820]  I
[02:37:08.820 --> 02:37:16.940]  Agree with you and expanding on that look at the flash floods that have killed at least three in Colorado 30 foot surge of water mud rocks
[02:37:17.940 --> 02:37:25.460]  The National Weather Service warns of biblical rainfall. That's a quote smashes records set 1940 National Guard called in
[02:37:26.260 --> 02:37:28.940]  Towns set curfews mass evacuations
[02:37:30.060 --> 02:37:32.140]  Meanwhile
[02:37:32.140 --> 02:37:37.380]  There'll be a flood and people won't even leave their house when they're told to because they're busy watching MTV and it really is
[02:37:37.660 --> 02:37:42.260]  Like people that are dialed into pop culture do not even know that they're on a planet
[02:37:42.580 --> 02:37:44.820]  They don't even know there's a world going on
[02:37:44.820 --> 02:37:50.820]  They just think it's all the television and those people on the screen have a life and that they don't have a life
[02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:56.700]  When I'm saying it's no we all have a life. We're all on a big spaceship in deep space. It's beautiful
[02:37:56.700 --> 02:38:04.380]  God's creations are all around us and there's so many people to work with and help and be good and and just be loving and
[02:38:04.860 --> 02:38:06.860]  stand against evil
[02:38:06.740 --> 02:38:13.660]  Yeah, and that's what we have to do. I mean, I'm always reaching out. I mean, I you know, there's a lot of people out there that want
[02:38:13.660 --> 02:38:15.660]  You know, I
[02:38:16.140 --> 02:38:20.900]  Believe people are looking for good. Now. I think people are tired. I think this generation
[02:38:21.900 --> 02:38:24.780]  are tired of all the
[02:38:24.780 --> 02:38:31.780]  Stuff is all the some of the songs and some of the stuff that's been out there for a number of years
[02:38:31.780 --> 02:38:36.980]  I believe they're getting tired of darkness. I mean, I remember when I was you know out there in the 60s
[02:38:36.980 --> 02:38:41.340]  I was a radical hippie. I was actually a yippie. I was in the
[02:38:41.700 --> 02:38:49.060]  Demonstrations and I was at what you call it Timothy Leary bathtub acid particle sign and I was taking LSD and traveling around the country
[02:38:49.060 --> 02:38:52.620]  and there was a lot of times in my life I was tired of
[02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:56.380]  Of the drugs I was tired of the parting
[02:38:56.380 --> 02:39:02.100]  I was tired of just you know, I really wanted and when I'd come across people that seemed like they had something good
[02:39:02.100 --> 02:39:06.780]  How light about them? You know, I mean, I would drive I'd gravitate toward them
[02:39:06.780 --> 02:39:14.400]  And I think that's what made me go some to somewhat towards the Lord because I'd run into these people would just say a few little things like
[02:39:14.420 --> 02:39:18.660]  Hey, God loves you or you've got something special for you. They wouldn't preach to me or
[02:39:18.660 --> 02:39:23.660]  Do anything or take me to church. They just say that it would just get ahold of me
[02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:30.820]  And I think this generation really wants good stuff, but you know, good music. They want good music
[02:39:30.820 --> 02:39:36.500]  I think honestly, I think my daughter's song this one just came out as a very good song
[02:39:36.500 --> 02:39:42.660]  And it's it's a clean and it's not got a bunch of bump and grind and sex and rock and roll
[02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:49.500]  And I I think I think it's just a time that people are just mourning to see some more light, you know, I agree with you
[02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:55.740]  I've got drudge report up right now. We can punch it up. It's crazy. There's a Netflix ad for Katy Perry part of me
[02:39:56.420 --> 02:39:59.140]  That just popped up. So here I'm talking to Katy Perry's dad
[02:40:00.020 --> 02:40:06.140]  And you know, there's your daughter popping up there and I know the short leash they keep celebrities on and I've been inside
[02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:11.980]  Hollywood at the highest levels inside music, right at the highest levels just just just by happenstance over the years
[02:40:11.980 --> 02:40:19.300]  And I and I always found it fascinating to watch how it's mafioso and how they're running these people and they tell them
[02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:26.020]  You criticize Obama. You criticize gun control. We don't care if you're selling five million
[02:40:26.900 --> 02:40:32.460]  Downloads a year. You're not gonna be on the tour. You're gonna be off the radio Hollywood people
[02:40:32.460 --> 02:40:33.860]  I've been there when they're threatened
[02:40:33.860 --> 02:40:38.860]  I was there when Mark Cuban was threatened by the White House and it came out years later in the New York Times
[02:40:38.860 --> 02:40:42.340]  And I took talk about before it came out the New York Times the White House
[02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:45.540]  And we're gonna put you in jail if you put out this 9-11 truth film
[02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:50.340]  So so so I'm surprised your daughter's able to be as clean as she is
[02:40:50.700 --> 02:40:54.620]  With this devilish system running it. So again, we're not we're not judging her
[02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:59.260]  I've been critical of the military propaganda film. She was in but but that's so sophisticated
[02:40:59.260 --> 02:41:02.180]  I don't think she probably even understood that but what I was gonna say is
[02:41:02.700 --> 02:41:07.060]  Imagine if not just Katy Perry, but other big celebrities. They're listening because they call me all the time
[02:41:07.060 --> 02:41:08.940]  They're always scared to go public
[02:41:08.940 --> 02:41:15.380]  Imagine if people just started going public and doing what they wanted. We could flip the system over they try to keep
[02:41:16.460 --> 02:41:22.860]  Celebrities in this worldly system on a short leash so they can control them to push their agenda
[02:41:22.860 --> 02:41:26.760]  And I'm calling as this global awakening happens for
[02:41:27.220 --> 02:41:33.940]  Celebrities across the board to start bucking the system however they can because they can't shut everybody down
[02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:35.300]  What do you say to that sir?
[02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:40.660]  Well, yeah, I believe that's true and I believe that voice needs to go out and people need to listen to it and hear it and and
[02:41:41.300 --> 02:41:45.900]  And do something about it, you know, you was talking about Dave Mustaine
[02:41:45.900 --> 02:41:51.660]  Oh, we know him too and and we've even had Bible studies in his house and he's really
[02:41:52.780 --> 02:41:57.300]  A type of person even though his music, you know, it's a little bit different
[02:41:57.340 --> 02:42:03.940]  He's really, you know, really loves God and and and his wife and and even
[02:42:03.940 --> 02:42:07.580]  He was so kind to us a while back here
[02:42:07.580 --> 02:42:14.540]  We was in that move we were moving and we were trying to find a house to buy and so he said hey
[02:42:14.540 --> 02:42:19.060]  I've got this cabin this a beach cabin in Oceanside, California
[02:42:19.060 --> 02:42:23.380]  He wants you on your watch just go stay there until you make your mind up. So we went and
[02:42:24.460 --> 02:42:32.220]  Really, he was on your program the other month. I think it wasn't and he was speaking out and you know, he's got a voice
[02:42:32.220 --> 02:42:34.220]  Yeah, he certainly
[02:42:34.300 --> 02:42:38.140]  He they've certainly persecuted him over but I'm not gonna say any more. No, no
[02:42:38.780 --> 02:42:41.300]  I mean, I mean, that's the amazing thing about it
[02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:46.020]  And in fact, it was Dave that told me you were listening about a year ago and said ought to contact you were a great guy
[02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:49.300]  And I and then I heard about I said they ought to get that book and then I read it
[02:42:49.300 --> 02:42:52.460]  I totally resonated with it. So now here you're here. So that's how that happened
[02:42:52.460 --> 02:42:56.140]  But speaking of Dave Dave was never what you call a devil worshipper
[02:42:56.140 --> 02:43:00.220]  You know, this is he said his own words here, but if you listen to his songs, they're almost
[02:43:00.220 --> 02:43:07.380]  Pathetic, I'm a big Megadeth fan and and they're about the New World Order and the end of the world because he grew up a Christian and
[02:43:07.780 --> 02:43:13.380]  And he and his wife Pam are are are people think of Dave Mustaine as the really mean guy that could beat up like you know
[02:43:13.380 --> 02:43:19.860]  10 people really tough guy really wild all that stuff just like I was very similar to that when I was growing up and
[02:43:20.140 --> 02:43:28.460]  But now to knowing he is all about controlling his worldliness being so loving so good to people and I have watched the world
[02:43:28.460 --> 02:43:35.260]  They're knowing really good mess with him to and he knows that and he's being good and now he's getting all these blessings
[02:43:35.260 --> 02:43:37.260]  But yeah, just an example
[02:43:38.060 --> 02:43:40.060]  Just an example of
[02:43:40.060 --> 02:43:45.500]  He is such a sweetheart and his wife is such a sweetheart and his kids are such sweethearts
[02:43:45.500 --> 02:43:51.220]  They stay at our house and stuff when they come to town that that that it's just amazing to again
[02:43:51.620 --> 02:43:54.780]  Think of what Dave has become and he was always an amazing person
[02:43:54.780 --> 02:44:02.700]  Yeah, but but but it's almost like there's such energy in youth that that's why it's so easy for it to get out of control
[02:44:03.700 --> 02:44:07.940]  Right, you know, I think too, you know always darkness tries to put out the light
[02:44:07.940 --> 02:44:16.060]  You know and you're always trying to do you know people like Dave or myself you when you're putting out the truth and you're trying to
[02:44:16.500 --> 02:44:19.220]  Tell people warn people show people
[02:44:19.780 --> 02:44:21.780]  Make them aware of things, you know
[02:44:21.780 --> 02:44:31.500]  We're going against the grain. I mean if you're a Christian today, if Jesus is on your breath or you speak that name
[02:44:31.500 --> 02:44:36.140]  You you're already you're against you. It doesn't matter who you are
[02:44:36.140 --> 02:44:41.660]  I mean, it's just that for some reason that that's why I I don't know why they don't you know
[02:44:42.180 --> 02:44:44.500]  Because there's nothing wrong with I mean
[02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:50.740]  To be to have people good people around you. It's better than a bunch of people that are no good
[02:44:50.740 --> 02:44:56.940]  And it's just when we're out there, you know, they don't they don't like our opposition
[02:44:56.940 --> 02:45:00.420]  I don't and I'm like to say I don't try to go preaching to these people
[02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:01.420]  I just
[02:45:01.420 --> 02:45:06.020]  They see that I'm different and I am exactly but it is it is it will don't don't short
[02:45:06.140 --> 02:45:07.620]  Shrift yourself for 40 years
[02:45:07.620 --> 02:45:11.340]  You said you've been reaching out to millions of people very successfully and and
[02:45:11.980 --> 02:45:14.940]  Tried to do it to your daughter's music and that went another direction
[02:45:14.940 --> 02:45:20.660]  But I think she's I think it's going to coming back the other way and that and that and that she's gonna end up being bigger than ever and
[02:45:20.980 --> 02:45:27.460]  And as a mighty weapon against the New World Order and all these forces and I think I already see that boomerang coming back around sir
[02:45:27.980 --> 02:45:33.700]  Yes, I I've received that I do I tell you we all we pray a lot my wife and I do
[02:45:34.140 --> 02:45:37.180]  For a lot of things, you know, not just for our family
[02:45:37.180 --> 02:45:44.140]  But for a lot of things that's going on and I think that you got a lot of listeners that they pray to really about
[02:45:44.140 --> 02:45:49.660]  For you and for what's going on in this world? And that's what really, you know counts a lot
[02:45:50.180 --> 02:45:54.540]  And it keeps us and it helps us so we got to stay on that course
[02:45:54.540 --> 02:45:59.300]  Well, Keith Hudson, you know Keith Hudson's written the amazing short book or recommend everybody gets it
[02:45:59.580 --> 02:46:04.300]  Looking and seeing great for parents to read great for your children of any age really to read
[02:46:04.300 --> 02:46:11.020]  I say above about 1415. They'll understand it. It's very well-written Keith Hudson.org. I said com earlier. It's org
[02:46:11.020 --> 02:46:14.100]  Yeah, folks. Oh, you bet but
[02:46:14.860 --> 02:46:22.500]  Absolutely, I mean what you're here talking about is everything and and the best people I found have been the prodigal sons like myself yourself
[02:46:23.340 --> 02:46:25.840]  Katie obviously Dave Mustaine
[02:46:26.820 --> 02:46:28.820]  They they've gone through the fire
[02:46:28.820 --> 02:46:33.580]  They always had a good heart but got caught a little bit like we all do by the devil's snares
[02:46:33.860 --> 02:46:37.780]  But but almost going through the fire makes our metal even better
[02:46:37.780 --> 02:46:41.060]  And then when you when you get to know somebody now, I guess for like
[02:46:41.900 --> 02:46:43.900]  six years or so Dave Mustaine
[02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:49.140]  And others and then you just can't believe how genuine good and loving they are
[02:46:49.580 --> 02:46:53.100]  Versus what the world tries to project. They are
[02:46:53.740 --> 02:46:57.460]  How the world hops on them if they have a you know a crooked toenail
[02:46:57.460 --> 02:47:00.980]  It shows you that the world is scared of good
[02:47:01.940 --> 02:47:04.980]  Loving Christian people not the fake plastic church
[02:47:04.980 --> 02:47:11.340]  But the real church that's in our heart that can revolutionize this world and bring us back from the brink of
[02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:17.140]  Thermal nuclear war and no matter what happens. What do you say about the churches that say don't worry about all the bad stuff
[02:47:17.140 --> 02:47:19.260]  That's happening. God will take care of it
[02:47:19.260 --> 02:47:24.700]  Isn't it during these bad times that we should be working even more so that people know about the choice they have? Oh
[02:47:25.260 --> 02:47:29.220]  Well, yeah, we've got to let people know that I mean you got to tell the truth
[02:47:29.220 --> 02:47:36.940]  And and and let people know cuz they're just going down that path and being led astray and like you said a while back
[02:47:36.940 --> 02:47:40.420]  We were all caught up into all kinds of things with that
[02:47:40.420 --> 02:47:46.220]  But we've got to we've got to stay out there with our voice and like I said you have a voice and
[02:47:46.540 --> 02:47:52.060]  Others Dave and myself and there's many many more a lot of the people you've had on your program
[02:47:52.060 --> 02:47:54.060]  I have a voice we just have to keep
[02:47:54.060 --> 02:47:59.380]  You know speaking that voice into the what's going on in this this world the truth
[02:47:59.380 --> 02:48:04.980]  You know people got it to the truth that you're you were born to know the truth
[02:48:05.460 --> 02:48:10.860]  Your spirit wants to know that they don't want to hear all this a bit your spirit because God created us
[02:48:10.860 --> 02:48:15.540]  It wants to hear the truth and when somebody does speak the truth. They go. Oh, yeah
[02:48:16.020 --> 02:48:22.060]  That's what called me listening to you. It's somebody told me he speaks the truth
[02:48:22.060 --> 02:48:26.900]  He got to listen to this guy so I turned you on and what you were saying was in it registered in my spirit
[02:48:26.900 --> 02:48:31.500]  Pam it's over two years now, and you know, I never thought I would never
[02:48:32.100 --> 02:48:37.420]  Would be on your program business talking to me. I'm gonna have to you know sit down after this
[02:48:37.780 --> 02:48:42.300]  Because I'm really I'm really honored that you even give me the time of day
[02:48:43.020 --> 02:48:48.540]  Well, sir, what you've done is very important and you know, I've seen Russell Brand who I've gotten a chance to talk to off air
[02:48:48.540 --> 02:48:54.300]  And he listens to the show and he's been listening for a long time and that's helped
[02:48:54.300 --> 02:48:57.980]  I think wake him up to a certain degree and I think he's on trajectory
[02:48:58.540 --> 02:49:05.020]  To really become a powerful voice for Liberty period same thing with your daughter and the Mustangs
[02:49:05.020 --> 02:49:09.540]  Just told me what a wonderful person you were and and then I read your book and was very touching to me

[02:49:30.540 --> 02:49:34.340]  On where you stand on your daughter because who are we to judge anybody?
[02:49:34.340 --> 02:49:38.060]  I think we can judge the people people that are actively out there doing bad
[02:49:38.060 --> 02:49:44.540]  But people that are just a little off the path. It's our job to help get them back on the path. Lord knows I'm off the path
[02:49:44.540 --> 02:49:51.560]  I mean, I've got a big heart and love God, but I've also got a very big dark side and we all do and so we got to deal with that

[02:50:49.860 --> 02:50:56.780]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us as we've moved through history every great leader has had to understand
[02:50:57.180 --> 02:50:58.940]  the potential of
[02:50:58.940 --> 02:51:04.860]  Information billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to
[02:51:04.860 --> 02:51:12.140]  Tap into your psyche from compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine
[02:51:12.140 --> 02:51:19.340]  We are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions when somebody obscures that feedback loop between you
[02:51:19.460 --> 02:51:23.660]  Observing and testing it out and verifying it. They can take total control of your awareness
[02:51:25.180 --> 02:51:32.580]  You need to be ahead of the game how to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand
[02:51:32.580 --> 02:51:34.580]  War
[02:51:37.380 --> 02:51:44.340]  Because there's a war on or your mind get your copy of state of mind the movie at info wars dot com and
[02:51:44.540 --> 02:51:49.500]  Remember every order at info wars store dot com receives a free citizen rulebook
[02:51:49.500 --> 02:52:01.340]  Coast to coast direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting network network
[02:52:04.580 --> 02:52:10.500]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers?
[02:52:10.500 --> 02:52:19.100]  Well, so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[02:52:20.060 --> 02:52:22.060]  Alex Jones
[02:52:22.340 --> 02:52:26.220]  Yeah, I knew that if my friends told me that pastor was a really good guy
[02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:30.820]  He would be in his books great and I didn't even really get him on. He's Katy Perry's dad
[02:52:30.820 --> 02:52:34.300]  I got him on as a Mustang so it's an interesting guy, but it's weird
[02:52:34.300 --> 02:52:41.420]  I've had no Russell Brant on Katy Perry's dad nobody get Katy Perry on because you know, I could say mean things to folks
[02:52:41.420 --> 02:52:44.580]  I'm sure her dad's aware of that like look at this war propaganda
[02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:47.140]  Look at her putting this out to get young women to be part of it
[02:52:47.140 --> 02:52:51.860]  And I do that just because I get upset about it because they're gonna shoot the women up full of vaccines all the rest of it
[02:52:52.020 --> 02:52:58.140]  But by doing that we can talk about Katy Perry now and then expose, you know, how they're gonna try to propagandize her and
[02:52:58.540 --> 02:53:03.180]  Now she's going in a better direction. It's not my job to sit there and you know do that
[02:53:03.180 --> 02:53:08.900]  I'm just about keep running across people's paths. It means I'm supposed to supposed to get him on air
[02:53:08.900 --> 02:53:12.220]  Have you just joined us? We had Katy Perry's dad on for like 40 minutes
[02:53:12.540 --> 02:53:18.540]  And we got all this other world news going on. We first had a top CIA brief for to the presidents on Ray McGovern
[02:53:19.060 --> 02:53:21.060]  and then we
[02:53:21.780 --> 02:53:25.460]  Shifted gears into that for the Friday show. I didn't take any calls today
[02:53:25.780 --> 02:53:31.460]  I'm going to take calls this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central with the Sunday broadcast
[02:53:31.460 --> 02:53:37.060]  And I'm really going to focus in on the latest developments in Syria, but mainly
[02:53:38.980 --> 02:53:40.980]  The attack on the press
[02:53:42.300 --> 02:53:43.700]  Because
[02:53:43.700 --> 02:53:48.860]  That is the big kahuna. You don't just have the suppress into the Tea Party and the IRS being caught
[02:53:50.180 --> 02:53:56.820]  Now in emails saying go after Tea Party destroy them. I mean that they should all be indicted. That's that's racketeering
[02:53:57.300 --> 02:53:59.300]  That's organized crime
[02:53:59.300 --> 02:54:04.100]  That's what that is when groups get together that goes illegally suppress somebody's civil rights
[02:54:04.580 --> 02:54:09.700]  That's civil right violation. It's a mafia behavior and they have racketeering laws for that
[02:54:10.860 --> 02:54:15.940]  But of course the mafia runs itself. So the problem is how do you stop that? Well, they've made some of them resigned
[02:54:16.100 --> 02:54:19.860]  But that's not enough they're coming out with the thing to protect the press
[02:54:19.900 --> 02:54:25.060]  But then it actually gets rid of the freedom of the press or let's the government define who is pressed and who isn't
[02:54:25.060 --> 02:54:33.260]  That's past the Senate committee. It's coming out that Google is in SA
[02:54:33.700 --> 02:54:36.700]  in SA disguised itself as Google to spy and
[02:54:37.700 --> 02:54:41.220]  I mean, that's exactly what I've told you for years and there it is. See that news
[02:54:43.220 --> 02:54:48.820]  And we've got all this other just incredible stuff, I'll be quite frank with you I'm pretty exhausted right now
[02:54:49.900 --> 02:54:52.660]  And I've got to go work on Obama deception
[02:54:52.660 --> 02:54:57.460]  Till late tonight, but I've got to do it or my children have no future and I'm not whining
[02:54:57.460 --> 02:55:02.620]  I don't I got to work so hard. I tell you that because sometimes by the end of the show. I feel
[02:55:03.460 --> 02:55:05.460]  Like a squeezed lemon. I
[02:55:06.220 --> 02:55:11.780]  Mean, I feel like I've been put through the meat grinder right now. Some days. I feel great after the show
[02:55:12.460 --> 02:55:14.460]  but
[02:55:15.900 --> 02:55:18.620]  Thinking of all the angles trying to be accurate I
[02:55:18.620 --> 02:55:24.860]  Think focusing on all the stuff the globalist is doing intensely for three hours
[02:55:25.580 --> 02:55:29.020]  it's like going to a funeral for three hours and
[02:55:30.380 --> 02:55:33.020]  Standing above the open casket of somebody you cared about
[02:55:33.860 --> 02:55:38.940]  You know, it's very intense. I got to go do that this Saturday for Raymond T
[02:55:38.940 --> 02:55:45.420]  I want to go honor him, you know good friend of mine for I don't like 14 15 years. Yes, but that long Wow
[02:55:45.420 --> 02:55:49.380]  But at the same time, I you know, it's like it's all heavy
[02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:55.420]  Everything's just so heavy and I know why people tune out of it all. I know why they don't care and just give up
[02:55:56.820 --> 02:55:59.460]  Because it is just insane. It's just insane
[02:56:00.780 --> 02:56:04.980]  And it's so hard to look at all these globalists and all things they're doing. Oh
[02:56:06.300 --> 02:56:08.300]  So sickening
[02:56:08.300 --> 02:56:15.860]  Samantha powers, I mean just up there like she was all sexy like she was Wonder Woman shaking her hair around and
[02:56:16.220 --> 02:56:20.820]  Really getting off on we don't care about the chemical weapons. He's heard the children and we're going in
[02:56:20.820 --> 02:56:27.100]  He started this and to know they're the people that started it. They're the people that put al-qaeda in I mean, it's just it's like too much
[02:56:27.420 --> 02:56:29.420]  It's too much. I mean
[02:56:29.740 --> 02:56:33.220]  What you know when Kerry was at least shaking and look like he was gonna pass out unhappy
[02:56:33.220 --> 02:56:35.740]  I was like good see you're unhappy you deserve it
[02:56:35.740 --> 02:56:40.900]  But with them it's just they're all stomping around like they're a beautiful horse or something getting off on
[02:56:41.300 --> 02:56:43.300]  Stomping on the bodies of children and I just like
[02:56:44.380 --> 02:56:45.500]  I mean, that's really yet
[02:56:45.500 --> 02:56:51.300]  It just makes me want to throw up and then see I then I get angry and then I get exhausted and I just I'm just
[02:56:51.340 --> 02:56:57.060]  Folks, let's put it into these people. Let's recognize good from evil. Let's speak out against them and it's happening
[02:56:57.060 --> 02:57:06.060]  We're turning the tide against these devils
