[00:42.200 --> 00:46.720]  accelerating in the globalist orchestrated turmoil to bring in the
[00:46.720 --> 00:51.600]  one-world planetary tyranny stay with us
[00:54.240 --> 01:01.360]  welcome to this live edition of the Friday February the 20th 2015 Alex
[01:01.360 --> 01:06.440]  Jones show we have a very interesting show today we have Dr. Sherry Tenpenny
[01:06.440 --> 01:10.200]  listen to these headlines these are recent headlines from info wars.com
[01:10.200 --> 01:15.680]  physicians Australian anti-vaccination tour and chaos Australian revenues or
[01:15.680 --> 01:20.060]  revenues rather are canceling on the anti-vaccine campaigner then this
[01:20.060 --> 01:24.000]  headline doctor educating public on vaccines receives bomb threats and
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.480]  cancels tours what is it that they did not want you to hear what is the message
[01:29.480 --> 01:34.360]  that is so important that they threaten the messenger we see this all the time
[01:34.360 --> 01:38.800]  we see it whether it's criminal actions being exposed by whistleblowers against
[01:38.800 --> 01:43.560]  the state what does the state ever do do they ever go after the criminal action
[01:43.560 --> 01:46.520]  to try to shut that down of course they don't they go after the whistleblowers
[01:46.520 --> 01:52.480]  they threaten them they jail them they assassinate them suiciding them what is
[01:52.480 --> 01:56.880]  the message that dr. Sherry Tenpenny wanted to tell the people of Australia
[01:56.880 --> 02:01.440]  well we're gonna find out she's gonna be with us in the second hour we also have
[02:01.440 --> 02:06.360]  a lot of news about breaking developments in Europe just yesterday there
[02:06.360 --> 02:10.480]  was a back-and-forth between Germany and Greece of course as to what's going to
[02:10.480 --> 02:15.280]  happen with Greek debt Germany is essentially calling the shots and so
[02:15.280 --> 02:18.280]  there's a lot of back-and-forth Greek politicians are comparing the current
[02:18.280 --> 02:22.440]  German government to the Nazis they have had an election they have resoundly
[02:22.440 --> 02:28.000]  rejected these austerity programs that have been forced on them by the EU it
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.800]  appears that the EU is either going to begin to break up and that's what Alan
[02:33.800 --> 02:36.920]  Greenspan was saying that looks like there's going to be a Greek exit or as
[02:36.920 --> 02:41.880]  they call it a Greg's it they have increased the the chances of that
[02:41.880 --> 02:46.280]  happening to 50% that's from the Commerce Bank AG they think that's going to
[02:46.280 --> 02:49.360]  happen of course Alan Greenspan said about a week or so ago that he thought
[02:49.360 --> 02:52.600]  that was going to happen some interesting stuff though came out of the
[02:52.600 --> 02:58.040]  live blogging that was going on that we saw from the telegraph they were live
[02:58.040 --> 03:01.720]  blogging the negotiations as it was happening yesterday in the EU and here's
[03:01.720 --> 03:06.840]  some of the interesting points Berlin of course rebuff proposals to give them
[03:06.840 --> 03:11.120]  a six-month extension saying it was a Trojan horse but the European Central
[03:11.120 --> 03:17.040]  Bank was forced to deny reports that it had discussed capital controls capital
[03:17.040 --> 03:22.480]  controls in other words you cannot move your money locking your money up this is
[03:22.480 --> 03:28.320]  going to be a very huge issue of course out of the Ukraine there's a lot of
[03:28.320 --> 03:32.600]  tension that is building up there we just had some Russian jets do flyovers to
[03:32.600 --> 03:37.000]  the UK pointing out that they are not going to be intimidated this is a very
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.600]  dangerous game that's being played by NATO by the United States by the bankers
[03:41.600 --> 03:45.800]  and it looks like Ukraine is starting to lose a civil war we have an article on
[03:45.800 --> 03:49.160]  info wars.com the US backed government in Ukraine is starting to lose a civil
[03:49.160 --> 03:52.920]  war mainstream media in the US is being very quiet about this but the truth is
[03:52.920 --> 03:57.000]  the US backed government in Kiev is starting to lose the civil war there's
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.520]  an article out on foreign policy magazine foreign policy saying draft
[04:01.520 --> 04:05.360]  talking about the draft dodgers of the Ukraine talking about how the struggling
[04:05.360 --> 04:09.920]  army is trying to replenish its ranks looks to me like they are losing the
[04:09.920 --> 04:14.880]  civil war but they have already lost the hearts and minds of their people amazing
[04:14.880 --> 04:19.520]  story we're going to talk about that as well and we have an interesting kind of
[04:19.520 --> 04:25.920]  funny bit of news we've got the predictive programming is beginning for
[04:25.920 --> 04:31.360]  driverless cars we've got a new concept that has been given the green light
[04:31.360 --> 04:36.720]  from Sony Pictures about a driverless car race from Paris to Beijing if you
[04:36.720 --> 04:39.880]  look at this picture of the Google car I think all they have to do to have a
[04:39.880 --> 04:45.920]  comedy is put people in that car I can laugh at that for a couple hours that's
[04:45.920 --> 04:49.560]  the car with no steering wheel no brakes you're not gonna get me in there we're

[08:16.240 --> 08:23.280]  Ladies and gentlemen it's Friday the 20th of the day of February 2015 I'm Alex Jones your
[08:23.280 --> 08:27.840]  host with a special news update you're looking at my little note pad here on
[08:27.840 --> 08:32.200]  the cover of it is the great wave of hokusai if I'm pronouncing that
[08:32.200 --> 08:36.520]  correctly Buckley and this is one of the best known paintings in the world and
[08:36.520 --> 08:42.120]  it symbolizes if you go read the breakdown from the different art
[08:42.120 --> 08:49.560]  museum websites a time of great change and energy overpowering something that
[08:49.560 --> 08:55.680]  cannot be stopped undoubtedly global governance has set in motion the global
[08:55.680 --> 09:00.640]  list to set forces in motion that will change world history forever but we can
[09:00.640 --> 09:08.520]  use the energy like a judo move that they have set in motion to actually
[09:08.520 --> 09:13.240]  redirect their energies and bring in a new Renaissance we certainly know that
[09:13.240 --> 09:17.520]  if we go along with their operations it's only going to make things worse for
[09:17.520 --> 09:21.480]  the average human and have set in motion different actions that many
[09:21.480 --> 09:26.600]  historians many military experts many futurists believe have a very good
[09:26.600 --> 09:32.360]  chance of destroying life on this planet or causing cataclysms that are so bad
[09:32.360 --> 09:36.600]  we wish we were all dead we're going to look at a confluence of some of these
[09:36.600 --> 09:42.640]  factors of the great wave here in just a moment but right now the snow here to
[09:42.640 --> 09:49.160]  the computer and you can see here in New York metropolitan museum of art the
[09:49.160 --> 09:56.600]  great wave from a series of 36 views of Mount Fuji and I guess that's from out
[09:56.600 --> 10:00.360]  in the ocean you can then see Mount Fuji there on the land with the boats
[10:00.360 --> 10:06.680]  coming across and there is a close-up of the great wave itself in fact it's one
[10:06.680 --> 10:14.240]  of my favorite pen and inks to basically copy or add to a very powerful art
[10:14.240 --> 10:19.840]  type of image obviously now let's look at some of these real great waves this is
[10:19.840 --> 10:24.360]  a story up on info wars dot com today and we've got a link to shadow stats top
[10:24.360 --> 10:28.480]  economists used to advise the White House John Williams hyperinflation to
[10:28.480 --> 10:34.000]  start in 2015 economists says get supplies gold silver canned goods toilet
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.000]  paper bottle water he uses the numbers that they used up until Reagan and right
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.600]  back into 1900 or so with different government stats to come up with these
[10:43.600 --> 10:48.880]  numbers these are with real numbers not with the cook numbers and even on CNBC
[10:48.880 --> 10:53.560]  and CNN they admit that cook numbers are being used let's go back to this very
[10:53.560 --> 10:58.880]  important article here it's impossible to predict when or how the economy will
[10:58.880 --> 11:03.040]  finally reach a breaking point but according to contrarian shadow stats
[11:03.040 --> 11:08.000]  economist John Williams it's coming one way or the other I don't know if I would
[11:08.000 --> 11:11.560]  say he's really contrarian though I mean he's using mainline numbers he is
[11:11.560 --> 11:15.760]  contrarian from the Department of Commerce and Labor in the federal
[11:15.760 --> 11:18.800]  government though because they just shovel you know loads of bull that you
[11:18.800 --> 11:23.240]  can keep your doctor and Obamacare cuts your prices and then we've got Greg
[11:23.240 --> 11:28.880]  Hunter USA watchdog we've got a bunch of other people in here breaking down the
[11:28.880 --> 11:32.840]  fact that all the numbers are there I know this going to even mainline
[11:32.840 --> 11:36.680]  restaurants not fancy ones they're about double what they were three years ago
[11:36.680 --> 11:41.040]  so you've got some commodities like oil that have been artificially deflated but
[11:41.040 --> 11:45.120]  you've got inflation out there because of QE unlimited you have the EU joining
[11:45.120 --> 11:49.600]  quantitative easing that violates their charter so we're going to see inflation
[11:49.600 --> 11:54.080]  but I think we're going to see inflation with depression in the real economy kind
[11:54.080 --> 11:58.280]  of a hyper stag inflation which economists say can't happen but this is so
[11:58.280 --> 12:02.560]  artificial we are beginning to see it happen so there's that article up on
[12:02.560 --> 12:07.920]  info wars.com then there's this report and we knew that this was coming feds
[12:07.920 --> 12:12.640]  anti-government groups a bigger threat than ISIS remember on Monday when they
[12:12.640 --> 12:16.040]  had they said they were having this summit I said watch once it gets kicked
[12:16.040 --> 12:20.880]  off Wednesday and Thursday we're going to hear about how Patriot groups are the
[12:20.880 --> 12:24.480]  problem and Obama wouldn't even say that radical Muslims were radical or
[12:24.480 --> 12:29.360]  terrorist and all of his pundits and spokespeople said because we don't want
[12:29.360 --> 12:33.040]  to anger the Muslims and you know they're you know they're all perfectly
[12:33.040 --> 12:38.120]  good this type of baloney feds anti-government groups a bigger threat
[12:38.120 --> 12:43.080]  than ISIS while Islamic State brags about sleep ourselves in the U.S. DHS
[12:43.080 --> 12:47.760]  friends about right wares as president Barack Obama continues to receive
[12:47.760 --> 12:52.080]  criticism for his refusal to use the term Islamic extremism Paul Joseph Watson
[12:52.080 --> 12:55.920]  article some federal authorities and law enforcement groups United States
[12:55.920 --> 13:00.480]  assert that anti-government groups pose a bigger threat and this has come out at
[13:00.480 --> 13:05.240]  the conference and it's come out on CNN we have the quote right here some
[13:05.240 --> 13:08.560]  federal law enforcement groups view the domestic terror threat from sovereign
[13:08.560 --> 13:13.520]  citizen groups as equal to and in some cases greater than there you go so you're
[13:13.520 --> 13:16.760]  not seeing terror attacks by radical Muslims right now shooting people and
[13:16.760 --> 13:19.960]  cutting their heads off the threat from foreign Islamic terror groups such as
[13:19.960 --> 13:28.480]  ISIS that garnered more public attention reports CNN and then it goes through
[13:28.480 --> 13:33.520]  judicial watches documents on sleep ourselves being ignored all the rest of
[13:33.520 --> 13:37.480]  the preparations as the Islamists claim they're going to flood Europe with 500
[13:37.480 --> 13:49.560]  thousand people as a form of usurpation or basically la reconquista of course the
[13:49.560 --> 13:55.800]  original or reconquista was the Spanish taking Spain back from the Muslims from
[13:55.800 --> 14:00.720]  the Moors from the North Africans but this is a this is a conquering and the
[14:00.720 --> 14:04.400]  question is will Europe go along with this well the multiculturalist want to
[14:04.400 --> 14:09.320]  engineer a clash I don't want to clash with Islam I don't want the war of
[14:09.320 --> 14:12.880]  civilizations that PNAC wrote about but that's what's being engineered right
[14:12.880 --> 14:19.840]  here right now okay let's now move along to another report on this front this is
[14:19.840 --> 14:24.760]  even bigger NATO prepares for war with Russia in Europe we have links to
[14:24.760 --> 14:29.400]  stars and stripes saying that they're moving in a 10 warthog tank musters
[14:29.400 --> 14:33.840]  they're moving in tanks and they've got different NATO commanders calling it a
[14:33.840 --> 14:37.760]  bold new plan since they're prepared basically for war with Russia and we
[14:37.760 --> 14:44.440]  have the Russian general saying quote we're at war earlier this month the
[14:44.440 --> 14:49.040]  former foreign relations head of the Russian military Ministry of Defense
[14:49.040 --> 14:52.560]  and current president the Academy of Geopolitical Studies said Russia is at
[14:52.560 --> 14:55.840]  war with NATO in the West now listen to this quote and listen to this quote
[14:55.840 --> 15:02.560]  carefully apparently their officials of the European Union and US Secretary of
[15:02.560 --> 15:07.920]  State John Kerry have dedicated themselves and continue to do so to
[15:07.920 --> 15:11.440]  deeply and thoroughly study the doctrine of Joseph Goebbels they present
[15:11.440 --> 15:16.280]  everything backwards from reality it is one of the formulas which Nazi
[15:16.280 --> 15:21.120]  propaganda empowered most successfully they accuse the party that is defending
[15:21.120 --> 15:27.080]  itself of aggression we are seeing in Ukraine and in Syria is a Western project
[15:27.080 --> 15:32.880]  a kind of new war in both places you see clear anti Russia approach and as
[15:32.880 --> 15:38.440]  well known wars today begin with psychological and information warfare
[15:38.440 --> 15:44.360]  operations I assume that the foreign ministry understands that we are at war
[15:44.360 --> 15:49.760]  he said and it just goes on with a whole breakdown of the video that is up at
[15:49.760 --> 15:56.240]  infowars.com ladies and gentlemen what we're dealing with here is a world being
[15:56.240 --> 16:03.560]  artificially brought into crisis what we're dealing with is a planetary
[16:03.560 --> 16:08.880]  destabilization that is a real destabilization but we're globalist
[16:08.880 --> 16:13.560]  financial forces with their hundreds of trillions of fiat dollars of euros are
[16:13.560 --> 16:18.120]  going to try to leverage that again posing as savers to bring in their one
[16:18.120 --> 16:23.960]  role government by increment just like they say oh you know we'd be stabilized
[16:23.960 --> 16:29.000]  Ukraine now we need to have 16 plus billion dollars in a Marshall plan that's
[16:29.000 --> 16:32.120]  then just paid into George Soros and others so they create the crisis to
[16:32.120 --> 16:36.920]  stabilize takeover and then pay money to themselves as the quote rebuilders like
[16:36.920 --> 16:42.800]  the Marshall plan and that's a microcosm of this operation then we've got other
[16:42.800 --> 16:46.520]  articles over there that Mikhail Thelen wrote that's linked directly to the
[16:46.520 --> 16:51.160]  Harvard Law Review even criticizing it where major colleges are doing things
[16:51.160 --> 16:57.440]  like if a man looks like someone a woman claims raptor with no reports
[16:57.440 --> 17:02.440]  understand she's not even saying with someone or proving someone of a
[17:02.440 --> 17:06.720]  raptor she's saying you look like someone who raped me years ago and so then
[17:06.720 --> 17:10.560]  the person's kicked off campus that's another article that we'll put up on
[17:10.560 --> 17:17.320]  screen here for the viewers this is the mind control where sleeper cells are
[17:17.320 --> 17:20.840]  being brought into the country but the government's preparing for war with a
[17:20.840 --> 17:24.040]  tea party and auditing basically every Christian group and pro-life group and
[17:24.040 --> 17:30.120]  pro-gun group and trying to shut them down while meanwhile you can have
[17:30.120 --> 17:34.120]  brown paper bags in Seattle government or you're fired and because it's racist
[17:34.120 --> 17:39.440]  and if a woman says you look like someone who raped her then you're kicked
[17:39.440 --> 17:43.920]  out of school because you were offensive this is how they're ending free
[17:43.920 --> 17:47.000]  speech and they're really doing it and they're turning people out from these
[17:47.000 --> 17:50.880]  colleges that don't even know how to operate or even how to live this is
[17:50.880 --> 17:56.480]  modern mass mind control well that's this news update I'll be back at the end of
[17:56.480 --> 18:00.080]  the broadcast with another news update with breaking information and I've
[18:00.080 --> 18:05.720]  almost completed the family issues I've had and I'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6
[18:05.720 --> 18:10.000]  p.m. Central live and I'll be back you know for week after week won't miss any
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.360]  shows I know folks have been chomping on the bed for me to be hosting but quite
[18:13.360 --> 18:16.800]  frankly a lot of folks like David Knight more than I do so you get a nice mix
[18:16.800 --> 18:20.960]  you can always see David and Jakari and Leanne the rest of the great crew on the
[18:20.960 --> 18:26.320]  nightly news 7 o'clock Central weeknights at prisonplanet.tv now we're
[18:26.320 --> 18:31.200]  going to throw it back to David Knight live in the info wars.com news studios
[18:31.200 --> 18:36.800]  I'm Alex Jones reporting from home via low-tech it's actually pretty high tech
[18:36.800 --> 18:41.200]  but we're doing it in a kind of off-the-cuff quick way but folks seem to
[18:41.200 --> 18:44.400]  love these videos so we'll keep them coming and I'll follow some more this
[18:44.400 --> 18:47.760]  weekend as well and there'll be another one at the end of the transmission today
[18:47.760 --> 18:51.640]  never forget if you're watching and receiving this transmission you're the
[18:51.640 --> 18:55.320]  resistance now is the time to be involved now is the time to be speaking out
[18:55.320 --> 18:59.240]  I mean you could see the world with war and crisis and turning the Middle East
[18:59.240 --> 19:03.880]  over to radical Islamists and and then not allowing us to even criticize them
[19:03.880 --> 19:08.280]  or stop them and the economics being set up the Domino's to fall it's all
[19:08.280 --> 19:12.320]  coming together in an engineered perfect storm but we can take that storm
[19:12.320 --> 19:16.640]  expose that the globalists are behind it discredit them and then use the time of
[19:16.640 --> 19:21.480]  change a lot of good stuff done like many nations like Greece are doing some of
[19:21.480 --> 19:26.080]  the reforms we see happening in Ireland in Iceland some of the reforms we see at
[19:26.080 --> 19:29.520]  the state level for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
[19:29.520 --> 19:34.000]  Newtonian physics and Einstein expanded on that the globalists know that that's
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.360]  why they want to make you think you're powerless it's not true you take their
[19:37.360 --> 19:42.800]  energy and you use it against them in a judo move all right we take you now live

[24:19.560 --> 24:25.880]  this Friday February 20th 2015 we have a special guest today we have someone who
[24:25.880 --> 24:30.880]  was essentially run out of Australia with bomb threats because they didn't
[24:30.880 --> 24:35.800]  want to hear the message she had to say to stop your ears scream and shout and
[24:35.800 --> 24:40.440]  threaten people violently that's what happened to Dr. Sherry 10 penny when she
[24:40.440 --> 24:44.680]  wanted to talk about vaccines and of course she wanted to talk about informed
[24:44.680 --> 24:49.960]  consent we can't have informed consent anymore we can't even have people talking
[24:49.960 --> 24:55.200]  about informed consent we had headlines on the 23rd of January physicians
[24:55.200 --> 25:01.840]  Australian anti-vaccination tour in chaos as they got threats at the different
[25:01.840 --> 25:06.920]  venues in Australia a week later doctor educating the public on vaccines
[25:06.920 --> 25:11.600]  receives bomb threats cancels tour free speech and double standards on the road
[25:11.600 --> 25:15.560]  to forced vaccination as we put it so we're going to be talking to Dr. Sherry
[25:15.560 --> 25:19.120]  10 penny and next hour you're going to find out what they don't want you to
[25:19.120 --> 25:24.160]  hear do you remember the strice and effect it was a situation where some
[25:24.160 --> 25:29.080]  people early days of the internet people weren't used to Google Maps where you
[25:29.080 --> 25:32.360]  could look at pretty much anything somebody was mapping the coast of
[25:32.360 --> 25:37.040]  California and on the internet they had a picture of her house but she realized
[25:37.040 --> 25:39.840]  they had a picture of her house she demanded that they take this thing down
[25:39.840 --> 25:44.760]  very public lawsuit came over that because it was a very important principle
[25:44.760 --> 25:48.480]  about the freedom of the internet at the point that she started the lawsuit
[25:48.480 --> 25:52.560]  there was only four views of that house a couple of those were her and her
[25:52.560 --> 25:58.480]  lawyer after the lawsuit blew that up there were 400,000 views that's the
[25:58.480 --> 26:02.600]  strice and effect that's what's going to happen when you try to shut people up
[26:02.600 --> 26:08.120]  about talking about the risks and the concerns that we have about vaccines
[26:08.120 --> 26:11.840]  talking about their safety and efficacy rather than addressing those concerns
[26:11.840 --> 26:15.520]  rather than saying oh look here's the studies that we've done and your
[26:15.520 --> 26:18.680]  concerns are unfounded as to what we're adding to these vaccines rather than
[26:18.680 --> 26:23.040]  doing that they attack you they threaten to bomb the venues when you're going to
[26:23.040 --> 26:28.440]  be speaking that doesn't work too well it didn't work too well in the Boston
[26:28.440 --> 26:31.600]  bombings when we had the FBI say don't look at any of these other pictures only
[26:31.600 --> 26:34.720]  look at pictures that come from us or at Sandy Hook where you had the state
[26:34.720 --> 26:38.440]  police come in and say and threaten people for what they would be writing
[26:38.440 --> 26:43.360]  about it on social media when you do that when you send state police in Florida
[26:43.360 --> 26:46.920]  to threaten the man who you're stonewalling on freedom of information
[26:46.920 --> 26:51.160]  requests on stone Sandy Hook when you do that it kind of blows up in your face
[26:51.160 --> 26:55.200]  because people understand that there's something that you're trying to hide but
[26:55.200 --> 26:59.200]  what we're seeing right now is not only an attack on our fundamental liberties on
[26:59.200 --> 27:03.120]  our fourth amendment freedoms you're gonna be secure in our person to start
[27:03.120 --> 27:07.480]  with but of course that doesn't happen anymore not only can they violate the
[27:07.480 --> 27:10.440]  fourth amendment at the airport's putting their hands on our bodies whenever
[27:10.440 --> 27:15.280]  they wish now they think they can put vaccines into our bodies so we have a
[27:15.280 --> 27:19.720]  fight about the First Amendment now as well that's on our hands but all these
[27:19.720 --> 27:23.600]  rights that we have that are recognized not granted by the Constitution
[27:23.600 --> 27:27.560]  recognized by the Constitution you have to value those rights you have to
[27:27.560 --> 27:33.400]  exercise those rights and you have to demand those rights and so that's what
[27:33.400 --> 27:35.800]  we're demanding we're going to be talking about that we've got a special
[27:35.800 --> 27:39.800]  report from Rob do that we're going to be playing in the next segment and then
[27:39.800 --> 27:45.400]  of course Sherry Tenpenny is going to be joining us in the next hour on a
[27:45.400 --> 27:49.800]  lighter side there is some funny news that has come out and this actually is
[27:49.800 --> 27:53.880]  still a serious subject a very serious subject because it talks it addresses
[27:53.880 --> 27:59.960]  the the control of movement in our country the control of transportation
[27:59.960 --> 28:04.360]  and that's the driverless cars as I call them the computer driven government
[28:04.360 --> 28:08.560]  controlled cars but now we've got a concept that's been floated out there
[28:08.560 --> 28:15.000]  Sony has picked it up they're going to do a movie a comedy about driverless
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.480]  car race that's what the working title of it is right now this is a story that
[28:18.480 --> 28:22.200]  was broken by deadline now they say the driverless car race that they're going
[28:22.200 --> 28:26.760]  to put into this from Paris to Beijing would be close to impossible the
[28:26.760 --> 28:30.240]  infrastructure is not there yet but they're going to I guess pretend that
[28:30.240 --> 28:32.920]  it is there at least partially there for this comedy they're going to have
[28:32.920 --> 28:38.800]  comedians as passengers who volunteer to ride in self-driving cars no self-driving
[28:38.800 --> 28:42.240]  cars is what we have now they'd be computer driven government controlled
[28:42.240 --> 28:46.840]  cars nevertheless to ride in these cars on an experimental high-stakes road
[28:46.840 --> 28:51.320]  trip from Paris to Beijing is kind of like a 21st century of the great race
[28:51.320 --> 28:54.800]  if you remember that movie that had Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis Natalie Woods and
[28:54.800 --> 29:00.760]  it that was that was a comedy that was set the very early days of automobiles
[29:00.760 --> 29:03.840]  I guess they're going to do this down the very early days of the remaking of
[29:03.840 --> 29:08.080]  transportation if you look at this picture pull the Google car up guys this
[29:08.080 --> 29:14.240]  thing is absolutely ridiculous when you look at this this is essentially the
[29:14.240 --> 29:18.560]  automotive equivalent of the cone of shame you remember that from up remember
[29:18.560 --> 29:22.960]  how they would take the vets cone and they put it on the dogs and they would
[29:22.960 --> 29:27.840]  get this you've seen it happen with your dogs they're part partly alarmed and
[29:27.840 --> 29:31.960]  partly embarrassed that would be what would happen in this Google car this is
[29:31.960 --> 29:37.080]  however what the castrated captives of the future will be driving this Google
[29:37.080 --> 29:41.280]  car it's not herby it's not cute it's just ridiculous no steering wheel no
[29:41.280 --> 29:44.960]  brakes you have no control over your life they've even painted headlights on it
[29:44.960 --> 29:49.640]  that don't work this is what they're showing us we're on the March the

[33:28.880 --> 33:33.200]  light we'll see welcome back to the alex jones show
[33:33.200 --> 33:37.680]  our sympathies to all of you who are back east suffering from this arctic
[33:37.680 --> 33:39.760]  weather but of course it's not something that's just
[33:39.760 --> 33:44.240]  limited to the east coast of america we've got snow falling in golan
[33:44.240 --> 33:47.360]  in jerusalem even in the negev desert this is a
[33:47.360 --> 33:50.640]  story from the jerusalem post it's up on the drudge report today
[33:50.640 --> 33:54.400]  and of course as we pointed out yesterday the great lake great lakes are frozen
[33:54.400 --> 33:58.000]  most of them well under the high 90 percent that's a
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.000]  record freezing of the great lakes we've got niger falls frozen
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.840]  we even have as drudge reports the dc the
[34:05.840 --> 34:10.160]  washington dc subway rails have fractured from the cold
[34:10.160 --> 34:13.840]  there's also articles saying these are the coldest temperatures we've seen
[34:13.840 --> 34:18.960]  since the 1800s guess what that's when we started keeping records most
[34:18.960 --> 34:22.000]  places weren't even keeping records in the 1800s
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.880]  that's how little we know about temperature
[34:24.880 --> 34:28.480]  data but of course that doesn't stop us from going off on a jag
[34:28.480 --> 34:32.720]  and doing all kinds of crazy stuff as we had a story that's still up on
[34:32.720 --> 34:37.040]  info wars dot com came out late yesterday from kit daniels
[34:37.040 --> 34:40.320]  after a blizzard closes the campus harvard spends
[34:40.320 --> 34:44.240]  eight hundred thousand dollars to combat global warming
[34:44.240 --> 34:46.720]  even though they're concerned that students are falling behind because
[34:46.720 --> 34:49.840]  they're missing so many classes due to snow
[34:49.840 --> 34:54.800]  they point out i guess uh this is irony 101 for harvard
[34:54.800 --> 34:58.240]  there's a whole saying you know you you can uh
[34:58.240 --> 35:01.440]  experience is an expensive school but it's the only one a fool will attend
[35:01.440 --> 35:04.480]  but that's what they're finding out in harvard right now they're going to spend
[35:04.480 --> 35:08.000]  nearly a million dollars to combat global warming but they can't even get
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.480]  to class because it's so cold look we've got
[35:10.480 --> 35:14.720]  decreased solar activity we've got increased co2 activity
[35:14.720 --> 35:18.240]  their models don't work if the co2 is going up according to their models the
[35:18.240 --> 35:21.920]  temperature should be going down it's not man-made
[35:21.920 --> 35:25.520]  it's because of solar activity that's predominating on this
[35:25.520 --> 35:28.880]  and we can see that if you don't put the thermometers
[35:28.880 --> 35:32.720]  in cities and on airports you can see if you look from space that the
[35:32.720 --> 35:36.400]  temperatures are in fact going down and that all plays
[35:36.400 --> 35:40.320]  into a study that was reported by harvard's competitor
[35:40.320 --> 35:43.440]  yale it's a new study by Yale university professor dan
[35:43.440 --> 35:46.640]  cahan that confirmed that skeptics of the controversial
[35:46.640 --> 35:51.040]  anthropogenic in other words man-made global warming theory
[35:51.040 --> 35:55.280]  or as realists often call themselves skeptics they found out
[35:55.280 --> 36:00.800]  that they know more about this theory than the people who support it they
[36:00.800 --> 36:03.920]  surveyed 2 000 people and they found out that people
[36:03.920 --> 36:07.680]  that are labeled as deniers because see this is a religion
[36:07.680 --> 36:14.240]  to the global warmests okay deniers actually knew more about what the other
[36:14.240 --> 36:17.520]  guys said they believed in in this particular study
[36:17.520 --> 36:20.880]  very interesting i think we're going to go to a report from
[36:20.880 --> 36:25.520]  rob dew about vaccines it was on the nightly news last night very important
[36:25.520 --> 36:28.560]  report uh but before we do i want to let you

[37:05.440 --> 37:10.880]  have a dr sherry tin penny who had her first they tried to bar her from
[37:10.880 --> 37:13.520]  entering the country they were demanding that she not be allowed to
[37:13.520 --> 37:17.120]  even enter the country to talk about her concerns
[37:17.120 --> 37:21.040]  about mandatory vaccines her concerns about
[37:21.040 --> 37:25.200]  the efficacy and the safety of these vaccines
[37:25.200 --> 37:28.320]  when they were not successful in barring her from the country the next
[37:28.320 --> 37:33.520]  tactic that they took was to threaten violence against the venues where she
[37:33.520 --> 37:37.440]  was going to be speaking we had reports on this the end of january she has
[37:37.440 --> 37:40.480]  now canceled that she's in the united states she's going to be joining us on
[37:40.480 --> 37:43.440]  the program in the next hour so you can hear
[37:43.440 --> 37:49.200]  what was so threatening to the pharmaceutical powers that be in
[37:49.200 --> 37:52.320]  australia you can hear that in the next hour we're going to talk to her she's
[37:52.320 --> 37:56.640]  going to make her case tell people what she would have told them in australia
[37:56.640 --> 37:59.600]  and it's going to go out over the airwaves so tell your friends about it
[37:59.600 --> 38:03.920]  let's go to rob do's report about vaccines and how it's being we're being
[38:03.920 --> 38:07.360]  lied to by our government and the cdc
[38:07.360 --> 38:11.840]  yes these men have been hypnotized followers
[38:11.840 --> 38:18.880]  far less a new one it is not new and it is not
[38:18.880 --> 38:23.680]  on us hey guys rob do from info wars dot com and info wars nightly news and i
[38:23.680 --> 38:27.360]  have a follow-up to the lengthy report that i put out just a couple days ago
[38:27.360 --> 38:30.560]  on the alex jones channel and on prison planet tv
[38:30.560 --> 38:34.960]  that report is currently going viral and i encourage you to watch it i'll put a
[38:34.960 --> 38:39.360]  link to that report at the end of this one but here i want to focus on dr
[38:39.360 --> 38:43.120]  and shukit she's the director of the national center for immunization and
[38:43.120 --> 38:47.200]  respiratory diseases at the cdc and she was the one being interviewed by
[38:47.200 --> 38:49.920]  senator elizabeth warren when they had that
[38:49.920 --> 38:53.360]  beautiful exchange of how vaccines were so safe and effective
[38:53.360 --> 38:56.800]  and that there was no credible science anywhere on the planet that could say
[38:56.800 --> 39:00.560]  otherwise definitely running cover for big pharma
[39:00.560 --> 39:04.160]  so i wanted to take a look at dr shukit specifically her past to see where she
[39:04.160 --> 39:09.200]  came from i hadn't really seen much of her looking at vaccines in the past but
[39:09.200 --> 39:15.680]  she was out there especially back in 2009 2010 flu season during the h1n1
[39:15.680 --> 39:19.360]  scare where they were trying to get everybody to get the h1n1 vaccine
[39:19.360 --> 39:24.160]  and i found a couple of transcripts from press conferences that she released
[39:24.160 --> 39:28.000]  this one's from november 12 2009 where she says
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.360]  the immunization efforts with this supply continue to be focused on the
[39:31.360 --> 39:34.640]  target population priority groups pregnant women
[39:34.640 --> 39:39.280]  health care workers children and young adults up to 24 and adults 25 to 64 with
[39:39.280 --> 39:42.240]  chronic conditions and parents and other caretakers
[39:42.240 --> 39:45.680]  with small children and children under six months of age
[39:45.680 --> 39:49.120]  but what i'm specifically interested in is what she talks about in the beginning
[39:49.120 --> 39:52.720]  of that priority group section it is pregnant women
[39:52.720 --> 39:56.960]  now i hold here in my hot little hand the influenza virus vaccine
[39:56.960 --> 40:00.720]  flu zone and this is from 2009 2010 formula
[40:00.720 --> 40:04.320]  this is an old insert that i was able to get back
[40:04.320 --> 40:08.480]  then here it says under use in specific populations
[40:08.480 --> 40:11.680]  safety and effectiveness of flu zone have not been established in pregnant
[40:11.680 --> 40:15.920]  women or nursing mothers or children under six months of age
[40:15.920 --> 40:19.360]  so here in the insert it says it's not even recommended
[40:19.360 --> 40:23.440]  for pregnant women hasn't been studied on pregnant women or young children or
[40:23.440 --> 40:27.440]  nursing mothers flip it over on the back and it says this
[40:27.440 --> 40:31.760]  under section eight use in specific populations pregnancy
[40:31.760 --> 40:35.120]  animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with flu zone vaccine it
[40:35.120 --> 40:38.240]  is not known whether flu zone can cause fetal harm when administered to a
[40:38.240 --> 40:40.960]  pregnant woman or affect reproduction capacity
[40:40.960 --> 40:45.600]  flu zone vaccine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed
[40:45.600 --> 40:49.520]  under 8.3 nursing mothers it is not known whether flu zone vaccine is
[40:49.520 --> 40:53.200]  excreted in human milk because many drugs are excreted in human
[40:53.200 --> 40:56.640]  milk caution should be exercised when flu zone vaccine is administered
[40:56.640 --> 41:00.560]  to a nursing woman so in two different spots
[41:00.560 --> 41:04.880]  in this insert from the same year where dr shukit was out there promoting it
[41:04.880 --> 41:08.560]  that pregnant woman should get this vaccine it says it should not be given
[41:08.560 --> 41:11.200]  and it has not been tested on pregnant women
[41:11.200 --> 41:17.120]  there you go once again the cbc pushing dangerous chemicals and adjuvants
[41:17.120 --> 41:22.800]  and vaccines on people and on groups that they shouldn't even be targeting
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.240]  this is the insert that comes from the maker of the vaccine flu zone
[41:26.240 --> 41:32.800]  dated 2009 2010 so maybe in uh november 2009 she hadn't got that
[41:32.800 --> 41:36.080]  information yet well here she is in january on video during her press
[41:36.080 --> 41:39.520]  conference specifically targeting pregnant women and nursing mothers here's
[41:39.520 --> 41:43.600]  that clip this is a concerted effort of the cdc
[41:43.600 --> 41:46.320]  health and human services and all of our partners
[41:46.320 --> 41:51.520]  to encourage vaccination it includes a focus on people at high risk for
[41:51.520 --> 41:55.760]  complications adults with emphysema diabetes cancer
[41:55.760 --> 41:59.920]  children pregnant women and seniors really a focus on encouraging
[41:59.920 --> 42:04.800]  vaccination for anyone who hasn't yet been vaccinated and wants to be
[42:04.800 --> 42:08.480]  vaccine is still important for pregnant women and for postpartum women
[42:08.480 --> 42:11.280]  they've had terrible complications from this flu virus
[42:11.280 --> 42:15.840]  and although many have been vaccinated we know others haven't and we do encourage
[42:15.840 --> 42:19.040]  vaccination of pregnant and postpartum women
[42:19.040 --> 42:23.680]  and doing my research in this 2009 swine flu epidemic i also recalled the one
[42:23.680 --> 42:26.960]  that happened in the 70s and and this is one that we have lots of
[42:26.960 --> 42:29.680]  documentation of especially of the dangerous effects
[42:29.680 --> 42:36.080]  of the vaccine in fact 60 minutes that report on it and
[42:36.080 --> 42:40.880]  here's a couple clips remember the swine flu scare of 1976
[42:40.880 --> 42:44.240]  that was the year the u.s. government told us all that swine flu could turn out
[42:44.240 --> 42:47.440]  to be a killer that could spread across the nation
[42:47.440 --> 42:50.960]  well 46 million of us obediently took the shot
[42:50.960 --> 42:55.120]  and now 4 000 americans are claiming damages from uncle sam amounting to
[42:55.120 --> 42:59.200]  three and a half billion dollars because of what happened when they took that
[42:59.200 --> 43:02.960]  shot by far the greatest number of the claims two-thirds of them
[43:02.960 --> 43:07.520]  are for neurological damage or even death so this vaccine was endorsed by the
[43:07.520 --> 43:10.000]  president they use several other actor endorsements
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.760]  including mary tyler more and when she was asked by 60 minutes
[43:13.760 --> 43:17.040]  she had this to say erie did you take a swine flu shot
[43:17.040 --> 43:21.200]  no i did not did you give them permission to use your name saying that
[43:21.200 --> 43:24.880]  you had or were going to absolutely not never did
[43:24.880 --> 43:28.640]  did you ask your own doctor about taking this one flu shot yes and at the time
[43:28.640 --> 43:32.880]  he thought it might be a good idea um but i resisted it because i
[43:32.880 --> 43:37.360]  was leery of having the symptoms that sometimes go with that kind of inoculation
[43:37.360 --> 43:41.600]  and when the head of the cdc was asked about this here's what he had to say
[43:41.600 --> 43:44.960]  let me read to you from one of your own agencies
[43:44.960 --> 43:49.200]  memos planning the campaign to urge americans to take the shot
[43:49.200 --> 43:52.800]  the swine flu vaccine has been taken by many important persons
[43:52.800 --> 43:56.800]  he wrote example president ford henry kissinger
[43:56.800 --> 43:59.760]  elton john mohammed ali mary tyler more
[43:59.760 --> 44:03.440]  rudolf leery f walter cronkite ralph nader edward kennedy
[44:03.440 --> 44:09.120]  et cetera et cetera true uh i'm not familiar that particular piece of
[44:09.120 --> 44:11.840]  paper uh but i do know that at least of that group
[44:11.840 --> 44:15.440]  president ford to take the vaccination did you talk to these people beforehand
[44:15.440 --> 44:18.800]  to find out if they planned to take the shot i did not know did anybody i do
[44:18.800 --> 44:22.160]  not know did you get permission to use their names in your campaign
[44:22.160 --> 44:27.280]  i do not know so around 500 people developed giambore syndrome
[44:27.280 --> 44:30.800]  and at least 25 people died as a result of the vaccine
[44:30.800 --> 44:34.240]  in that year there were only 200 cases of swine flu reported
[44:34.240 --> 44:40.080]  and ultimately only one death so there you go you see the cdc once again
[44:40.080 --> 44:43.040]  scaring the population into getting vaccines
[44:43.040 --> 44:46.400]  and injecting themselves with these chemicals and then just kind of back in
[44:46.400 --> 44:50.160]  a way oh and there's a problem if a swine flu epidemic comes
[44:50.160 --> 44:53.760]  this is how it could spread you will want to be protected
[44:53.760 --> 44:58.320]  especially if you're elderly or chronically ill get a shot of protection
[44:58.320 --> 45:03.680]  the swine flu shot although the head of the cdc did get fired as a result of
[45:03.680 --> 45:06.240]  this scandal let me ask you another question
[45:06.240 --> 45:10.160]  where do you get your health advice from do you get it from mcdonald's
[45:10.160 --> 45:13.600]  well right now mcdonald's has given away free vaccines with happy meals in
[45:13.600 --> 45:16.560]  texas do you want your hepatitis a shot with that happy meal this is what
[45:16.560 --> 45:20.800]  anthony gucciardi says out of natural society this program is actually
[45:20.800 --> 45:24.080]  happening in the city of amarillo and here's what the local paper had to say
[45:24.080 --> 45:27.120]  the city of amarillo's department of public health and the caring for
[45:27.120 --> 45:30.720]  children foundation of texas will offer free vaccinations for children from 90
[45:30.720 --> 45:33.760]  m to 2 p.m. saturday at mcdonald's restaurant on 815
[45:33.760 --> 45:37.440]  south grand street they were offering the manyococcal vaccine
[45:37.440 --> 45:43.200]  varicella mmr the tdap booster vaccine hepatitis a
[45:43.200 --> 45:46.720]  in addition to letting people set up vaccination clinics on site of one of
[45:46.720 --> 45:50.640]  their stores i have very mcdonald's coupon that says well if mcdonald's the
[45:50.640 --> 45:53.760]  role model of health thinks it's a good idea then it must be
[45:53.760 --> 45:57.520]  and the coupon says if you get immunized bring your card in you'll get a free
[45:57.520 --> 46:00.080]  vanilla cone so now we should be taking our health
[46:00.080 --> 46:02.800]  advice from mcdonald's a company that puts
[46:02.800 --> 46:07.360]  actual silly putty and plastic products in the food that you eat
[46:07.360 --> 46:12.240]  are you loving it yet i want to end this report showing how the freedom loving
[46:12.240 --> 46:17.760]  spirit can prevail in certain instances back in 2011 the canadian press posted
[46:17.760 --> 46:20.960]  that measles among vaccinated kobeck kids questioned
[46:20.960 --> 46:25.440]  and it talks about a case in kobeck where 52 of 98 teens who caught the
[46:25.440 --> 46:29.200]  measles vaccine were fully vaccinated and this was a shock to the
[46:29.200 --> 46:32.640]  researchers that investigated it and it's not a shock to me
[46:32.640 --> 46:35.680]  in fact here's a clip from dr susanne humphrey's talking about
[46:35.680 --> 46:40.000]  how people after they get vaccinated they actually shed the disease
[46:40.000 --> 46:47.120]  i've got another study um from uh croatia and um
[46:47.120 --> 46:51.920]  there were several cases of measles uh outbreaks occurring in children who
[46:51.920 --> 46:56.240]  had just been vaccinated and so they looked at the strain they were
[46:56.240 --> 47:00.080]  they're having intensive surveillance of measles during this period of time and
[47:00.080 --> 47:02.560]  so they looked at with with this dna or genetic
[47:02.560 --> 47:06.720]  fingerprinting what strains they were and it was the vaccine
[47:06.720 --> 47:10.320]  strain that they were infected with so not only did they become
[47:10.320 --> 47:14.000]  they become sick from measles from the strain that they were vaccinated with
[47:14.000 --> 47:18.320]  but they were contagious as a result of this and other stories
[47:18.320 --> 47:22.320]  there's actually a family out there that started a daycare that's vaccine free
[47:22.320 --> 47:25.840]  in fact they don't want to take any kids if they've had their vaccinations
[47:25.840 --> 47:28.880]  here it is from cbc news vaccine free daycare
[47:28.880 --> 47:34.400]  criticized by ottawa public health they say a vaccine free environment is
[47:34.400 --> 47:38.000]  safer for young children because those who get the needle
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.560]  could as abacca calls it shed some of the disease to others
[47:42.560 --> 47:46.400]  and can just play and we don't have to worry about them contracting
[47:46.400 --> 47:50.880]  something from sheddings but ottawa public health has a big issue with
[47:50.880 --> 47:55.600]  vaccine free daycares and it wants to get the message out to parents that the
[47:55.600 --> 47:59.280]  measle vaccine is both effective and very safe
[47:59.280 --> 48:02.160]  and i think you're gonna see a trend of this happening people are gonna start
[48:02.160 --> 48:05.120]  bucking the system saying look we don't care what you're saying
[48:05.120 --> 48:08.000]  we're not gonna put this stuff into us you haven't fully tested it you're not
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.720]  being forthright you set up a secret court
[48:10.720 --> 48:14.160]  where we can't even get evidence from the vaccine companies
[48:14.160 --> 48:17.440]  and you just award judgments willy-nilly depending on semantics
[48:17.440 --> 48:20.400]  no people are starting to fight back and this is one way and i think you're
[48:20.400 --> 48:23.200]  gonna see a lot more of these and i hope to see a lot more of these in the
[48:23.200 --> 48:26.480]  united states where freedom-loving americans are gonna put their foot down
[48:26.480 --> 48:29.440]  and say we want to have an environment where vaccine free kids can get
[48:29.440 --> 48:32.000]  together and not just be pushed around by all you
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.280]  vaccine lovers out there this has been rob do for info wars dot com and info

[48:45.200 --> 48:50.400]  encourage you to become a member today thank you
[48:50.400 --> 48:54.080]  very important report from rob do and of course had aired on info wars nightly
[48:54.080 --> 48:58.240]  news last night passed that around people need to understand
[48:58.240 --> 49:02.080]  what's happened in the past they need to see how the cdc has conducted itself
[49:02.080 --> 49:07.040]  especially in the 1976 swine flu scare
[49:07.040 --> 49:11.600]  it wasn't an epidemic it was a scare absolutely shameful
[49:11.600 --> 49:15.600]  and yet when you look at this it's deja vu all over again the only thing they
[49:15.600 --> 49:19.920]  weren't doing at the time was trying to take away our informed consent
[49:19.920 --> 49:22.480]  as a matter of fact one of the things that were criticized for in the 60 minutes
[49:22.480 --> 49:26.320]  report was giving people these consent reforms they said well since there
[49:26.320 --> 49:29.200]  weren't any doctors there because 40 years ago we
[49:29.200 --> 49:33.520]  realized the importance of the doctor-patient relationship
[49:33.520 --> 49:38.160]  proceeding with informed consent without third-party interference without
[49:38.160 --> 49:40.880]  mandates from outside mandates from the government so they said well because
[49:40.880 --> 49:44.640]  we didn't have doctors present what they did was they gave them consent forms
[49:44.640 --> 49:48.320]  the problem was that the information they gave them on the consent form
[49:48.320 --> 49:52.720]  was for a different vaccine not for the one that they would be receiving
[49:52.720 --> 49:59.200]  so it's loaded with a lot of huge bombshell information that 60 minutes
[49:59.200 --> 50:01.840]  report it's very good to see this put in the context
[50:01.840 --> 50:06.800]  that rob do did so pass that around now we're having some good news
[50:06.800 --> 50:10.240]  we have some real good news in terms of people waking up
[50:10.240 --> 50:13.760]  and i don't want to just focus on places where we have a threat there are
[50:13.760 --> 50:17.200]  places where we are winning big time there's a story that's been picked up
[50:17.200 --> 50:21.600]  yet again this is on drudge this is the buzz feed talking about
[50:21.600 --> 50:26.640]  ron paul appearing at a mysas institute meeting about secession and the
[50:26.640 --> 50:29.840]  comments that he made he said it's good news that secession is happening
[50:29.840 --> 50:33.280]  he says it's going to happen it's going to be a de facto
[50:33.280 --> 50:37.280]  secession and we're going to talk about what he means by that because we had him
[50:37.280 --> 50:42.640]  on after he appeared there and he said i'm not obsessed about obsession
[50:42.640 --> 50:46.720]  he was talking about something that's a bit different than what you might think
[50:46.720 --> 50:50.560]  of when you say secession it's not about people rising up and leaving
[50:50.560 --> 50:54.160]  like they may do in the e you we'll talk about that right after the break stay
[50:54.160 --> 50:56.400]  with us

[54:08.800 --> 54:12.400]  were talking about the news that's resurfaced about ron paul
[54:12.400 --> 54:16.240]  talking about the session of course they bring that up to try to paint
[54:16.240 --> 54:20.160]  ron paul as a right-wing fanatic extremist the
[54:20.160 --> 54:23.440]  very kind of person that the obama administration
[54:23.440 --> 54:27.840]  is more concerned about than isis and of course we know that from the 2009
[54:27.840 --> 54:31.520]  mayak report where the fusion center was saying
[54:31.520 --> 54:34.800]  be very careful telling the police be very careful of anybody that you see
[54:34.800 --> 54:39.840]  that has a ron paul for president bumper sticker or a
[54:39.840 --> 54:43.120]  that was the constitution party chuck baldwin
[54:43.120 --> 54:46.640]  those stickers those people are dangerous profile them
[54:46.640 --> 54:50.480]  so this is this is part of this what was ron paul actually saying let's play a
[54:50.480 --> 54:54.640]  clip from ron paul and let him speak right here to
[54:54.640 --> 54:59.840]  start off by talking about the subject and the subject of course is secession
[54:59.840 --> 55:04.560]  and nullification the breaking up of government and the good news is it's
[55:04.560 --> 55:08.880]  going to happen it's happening
[55:08.880 --> 55:12.160]  yeah the good news is it's going to happen but he went on to say that it's
[55:12.160 --> 55:15.280]  going to be de facto he said the fed is going to end
[55:15.280 --> 55:18.720]  there is going to be a de facto secession movement going on the states
[55:18.720 --> 55:21.840]  are going to refuse to listen to some of the laws he's talking about
[55:21.840 --> 55:25.360]  nullification here he's talking about de facto in other words
[55:25.360 --> 55:28.640]  not something where you make a declaration but something that just
[55:28.640 --> 55:31.360]  happens naturally and we see it happening now he said we've seen
[55:31.360 --> 55:34.560]  tremendous success already with states saying to the federal government we're
[55:34.560 --> 55:37.840]  not going to listen to you anymore about the drug laws
[55:37.840 --> 55:42.080]  perfect example not a right-wing thing necessarily this is the
[55:42.080 --> 55:46.160]  left saying you know what we're not going to lock people up in prison
[55:46.160 --> 55:51.600]  for a mandatory minimum of 10 20 years because they've got a little bit of pot
[55:51.600 --> 55:55.040]  this is insanity we're not going to continue with this so you got states
[55:55.040 --> 55:58.720]  like Colorado and Oregon Washington other places
[55:58.720 --> 56:02.480]  saying we're not going to do this of course they tried to do it in Florida
[56:02.480 --> 56:07.120]  well over medical marijuana and just not over you know not even extending it to
[56:07.120 --> 56:11.040]  recreational use as it did in Colorado and elsewhere
[56:11.040 --> 56:14.800]  and of course there was a big fight over that who got involved in that well
[56:14.800 --> 56:18.240]  of course it was Sheldon Adelson who did 83
[56:18.240 --> 56:22.720]  gave money that was 83 percent of the contributions to stop it Sheldon
[56:22.720 --> 56:26.160]  Adelson who doesn't live in Las Vegas Sheldon Adelson
[56:26.160 --> 56:30.400]  who owns a casino why does he care so much about stopping
[56:30.400 --> 56:34.640]  medical marijuana why does he want to stop sick people from being helped with
[56:34.640 --> 56:38.240]  medical marijuana and it is very helpful for people who are taking
[56:38.240 --> 56:41.280]  chemo who are suffering from HIV it helps with the nausea
[56:41.280 --> 56:46.240]  of those issues it helps with glaucoma there are some very well-known ways that
[56:46.240 --> 56:49.520]  marijuana helps people i could go on with a very long list of this i don't have
[56:49.520 --> 56:53.120]  time for because the opposition person who
[56:53.120 --> 56:56.880]  didn't give quite as much as Sheldon Adelson was a lawyer
[56:56.880 --> 57:00.480]  named John Morgan now the interesting thing is is that
[57:00.480 --> 57:05.280]  the Democratic National Committee's chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz
[57:05.280 --> 57:10.400]  is a congressperson from Florida and she spoke out very strongly an opposition
[57:10.400 --> 57:15.760]  to helping people who are sick get marijuana she opposed this initiative
[57:15.760 --> 57:20.480]  and the people who were in favor of this had were very very critical of her so
[57:20.480 --> 57:24.800]  she sent a proposal to John Morgan the Orlando trial
[57:24.800 --> 57:28.480]  lawyer who funded just under 50 percent of the
[57:28.480 --> 57:33.120]  opposition she said if you'll retract critical statements that you made
[57:33.120 --> 57:36.720]  i will publicly back your cannabis initiative
[57:36.720 --> 57:40.400]  that she had just been trashing this last fall
[57:40.400 --> 57:44.000]  and what he said to her was no and he said
[57:44.000 --> 57:49.120]  she is a bully i beat bullies for a living
[57:49.120 --> 57:52.160]  good for him that's the kind of lawyer i want to get into
[57:52.160 --> 57:55.600]  some issues i want somebody who stands up to bullies and beats them for a
[57:55.600 --> 57:57.760]  living good for you john morgan now this is
[57:57.760 --> 57:59.680]  this is what else they said in the story they said
[57:59.680 --> 58:04.160]  the course it was voted on by just under 58 percent of the people wanted
[58:04.160 --> 58:07.200]  medical marijuana but in order to amend the constitution
[58:07.200 --> 58:10.080]  in florida they needed to have 60 percent so they fell short of that
[58:10.080 --> 58:12.480]  threshold and they made this point they said although
[58:12.480 --> 58:15.360]  58 percent of florida voters supported medical marijuana
[58:15.360 --> 58:19.040]  i'd be surprised if that many support her this should be a lesson for debbie
[58:19.040 --> 58:23.360]  waserman schultz florida voters like this policy more than her and we'll
[58:23.360 --> 58:25.920]  make sure people know her positions that's right
[58:25.920 --> 58:30.000]  we're winning we're shutting them off at the state level at the local level
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.880]  that's what ron paul was talking about was the session and we're going to do it
[58:32.880 --> 58:35.600]  we're going to do more of it stay with us we'll be right back we're going to have

[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:24.240]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.360]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight your host on this
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:33.200]  friday february 20th 2015 we're going to be joined in the next segment by dr
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:38.320]  sherry tenpenny the person that they were able to keep out of australia they
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:43.520]  essentially stopped her tour of australia she wanted to talk about informed consent
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.920]  they don't want to hear that she wanted to talk about the safety and efficacy of
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.480]  vaccines in australia they don't want to hear that either
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.560]  first they tried to bar her from the country do they do that with islamic
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:59.680]  jihadists or they keep imams out that would be politically incorrect but it's
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.880]  okay to shut somebody down when they're talking about
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:07.440]  uh an informed patient doctor relationship when they're talking about the
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.320]  safety and the efficacy and when they're talking about
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:15.760]  stopping mandatory healthcare treatment it's not just enough in this country
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.040]  where we have the fourth amendment that recognizes our right to be secure in our
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.600]  persons it's not just enough for them to put their hands on us
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.960]  they now assert that they're going to be able to
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.200]  insert chemicals into us and we're not allowed to question what that is we
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.720]  should be questioning that we have a new york university professor
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.320]  who questioned it he's uncovered that the fact that the fda
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:40.960]  systematically covers up fraud and misconduct in drug trials
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:44.880]  that's called regulatory capture that's the phrase it's a very common thing
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.360]  that happens when you create these government agencies
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.800]  that are supposed to regulate industries or companies or whatever
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:56.320]  instead they wind up being a tool of what they're supposed to regulate
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:01.040]  they wind up being bought by those people regulatory capture how does it work for
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.480]  the fda well they point out in the article this is uh they
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:09.040]  say the fda has shown a pattern of buying into the details of misconduct
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.560]  nobody ever finds out what data is bogus which experiments are tainted which
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.640]  drugs might be on the market under false pretenses the fda has repeatedly
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.160]  hidden evidence of scientific fraud not just from the public
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.400]  but also from its most trusted scientific advisors even
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.080]  as they were deciding whether or not a new drug should be allowed on the market
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:32.080]  even a congressional panel investigating a case of fraud
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:35.520]  regarding a dangerous drug couldn't get forthright answers yeah we see this all
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:40.320]  the time of course we can't have the congressmen see what the fda
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:44.000]  is planning to do with their new regulations what the fcc is planning to
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.760]  do to the internet we can't see what this trans-pacific or transatlantic
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:50.960]  partnership that's being negotiated by corporate lobbyists of the biggest
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.640]  multinational companies we can't see what's in that
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.240]  we just have to pass it so we can find out what's in it like we did with obama
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.160]  care and people are finding out what's in that and
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.280]  they don't like it not even the democrats like that of course we now have to
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.560]  just put the vaccines in our bodies so we can find out what's in them
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:10.720]  this is an article from slade and they say reading the fda's inspection files
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.720]  feels almost like watching a highlights reel from a scientist gone wild
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:18.560]  video they say they find faked x-ray reports forged
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:24.560]  retinal scans phony lab tests secretly amputated limbs all done in the name of
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:29.360]  science when researchers thought nobody was watching and they say well of course
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.800]  you're going to find that shocking that you find misconduct
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:36.640]  okay misconduct happens it's like what frank serpico said about the police he
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.200]  said you're going to have in any segment of society whether you're talking
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.400]  about uh scientists or policemen on the streets
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.160]  you're going to have people that do the wrong thing
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.120]  you're going to have criminal activity the question though
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:53.520]  is will the system purge that criminal activity
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:57.840]  or will it accept it because when you accept it the system
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.040]  becomes criminal you become the accessory to the crime
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.320]  you encourage the crime well there's what the fda did they say
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.280]  what's not what's shocking is not that this happened what's shocking is what
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.360]  the fda did when the fda finds scientific fraud or misconduct
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:15.120]  the agency doesn't notify the public the medical establishment
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.960]  or even the scientific community that the results of a medical experiment are
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.800]  not to be trusted on the contrary for more than a decade the fda has
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.560]  shown a pattern of bearing the details of misconduct they say they
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:30.400]  have things like 483s establishment inspection reports worst case
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.880]  warning letters they redact it and put it out it's like the nsa
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.040]  as we've been saying our government no longer believes in transparency of
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.400]  any way shape or form they're not going to show us the studies they're not
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.280]  going to show us the experiments in fact if they even did it
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:49.120]  because it doesn't support what they want to do they've been captured
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.120]  by the corporation stay with us we're going to talk to dr sherry tenpenny
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.760]  you're going to find out what they desperately tried to keep out of

[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.680]  tenpenny dr tenpenny is respected as one of the
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.400]  country's most knowledgeable and outspoken physicians regarding the
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.320]  impact of vaccines on health she is an outspoken advocate for free
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:28.720]  choice in health care what a novel idea free choice
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.320]  and health care we hear people talking about
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:35.920]  free choice most of the quote-unquote pro-choice people the only choice they
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.360]  want to give you is to whether or not you want to abort your
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.480]  unborn child because most of those same people
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.800]  are screaming at the top of their lungs for mandated vaccines they could care
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.640]  less about your choice well you know what we do have a choice we do have a
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.440]  free choice dr tenpenny is also an expert on women's
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.760]  breast health and the use of iodine for disease
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.680]  her website is tenpennyimc.com and before i go to her
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:03.040]  as i pointed out earlier in the show we had these reports as she was going to
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.320]  speak in australia they tried to bar her from coming into the
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:09.600]  country then when that didn't work they started
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.800]  phoning in bomb threats to the venues where she was going to be
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.800]  speaking we had headlines doctor educating public on vaccines receiving
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:21.040]  bomb threats and cancels tours that was one week after
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.160]  they had suffered from these different threats so there's something there that
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.360]  they don't want you to hear when we question
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:30.720]  the safety and efficacy of these vaccines whether or not they're
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.080]  effective rather than responding to that question
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:38.480]  they act as our government always does and that is if you expose criminal
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:41.760]  action in the government they come after you as the criminal
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.880]  they try to put you in jail they threaten to assassinate you
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.920]  you get suicided that's what our government always does
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.960]  that's what they're doing with the vaccines they don't address the issues
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:54.800]  that we have there so the question is what is it that they're trying to hide
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:58.560]  by attacking the messenger well in this case the messenger is dr
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.280]  sherry tenpenny thank you for joining us dr tenpenny
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.680]  you're welcome thanks so much for having me i am really interested to know and
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.640]  i'm sure our listeners are as well what was this
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.920]  scary message that was so important that they kept you out of australia
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.480]  it was a really interesting thing we said started out as a trip just as a
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:19.360]  as a holiday as a vacation and then i met miss
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.720]  stephanie messenger who is from australia and she said while you're here
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.440]  would you like for me to set up a few speaking venues for you
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:28.800]  i said yeah that would be kind of fun and i would be able to go to a couple more
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.440]  cities than what i was originally planning to do
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:36.160]  so she set up venues in melbourne sydney adelaide
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.200]  brisbane and gold coast and it was going to be just
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:42.560]  probably a couple hundred people more likely than not kind of speak into the
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:46.720]  choir people that knew me from facebook or maybe from this show or from coast to
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.160]  coast and and just get to know some people locally
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:54.000]  i got my plane ticket got my visa and then on january the fourth
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.920]  there was this big blow-up in the in the daily telegraph and then
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.760]  in the daily news and on the guardian and all the radio
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.160]  shows from australia started calling me and the first radio show i did was the
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:09.760]  largest radio show in sydney and the gentleman asked me at the end of the
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:14.000]  radio interview he said were you really surprised at the big blowback from all
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.600]  the media that was down here who didn't want you to come and said that you were
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:21.680]  a a menace to public health and they labeled you as a public health
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.880]  terrorist they were making appeals and setting up
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.880]  surveys in order to get the public health department to revoke my visa
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.400]  he said were you rather surprised at that and i said very surprised i've been to
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.360]  australia before i think it's a great country
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.600]  and i was very surprised at the way they reacted because the truth is
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:43.760]  i would have spoken to about 1500 people over the course of three weekends
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:47.360]  quietly gotten on my plane to and come back to the united states and
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:50.320]  who would have even known i was there except a few hundred people that
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:54.800]  probably were like-minded anyways you are the people that made it truly into
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:59.200]  an international incident in all of the mainstream media in australia canada
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.040]  and the uk i was doing interviews in all of those places all across the us
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:06.960]  and now millions and millions and millions of more people are aware of the
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.200]  fact that vaccines can cause problems that australia really doesn't have
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.080]  freedom of speech and not only do they not have freedom of speech
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.440]  they really don't have freedom of hearing either they don't want their
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.040]  citizens to know yes that's the key thing that we have to want
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:24.320]  our freedom of speech we have to as you point out a freedom of hearing
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.840]  we not only have to want to know what to be informed
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.520]  we have to want to be informed and of course we are going to lose that right
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.040]  along with a many other rights that we have lost if we don't demand those
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:38.480]  rights and we cannot allow them to turn us into
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.520]  guinea pigs and to slaves and that's what we will be
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.520]  if we allow them to force any kind of medical treatment on us
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:49.520]  vaccines are a large part of that and it's amazing to me dr. tim penny
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:53.680]  that they're rolling this thing out over something that i had as a childhood
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:56.800]  disease and we never considered measles to be life
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.160]  threatening or mumps well there's a couple things i'd like to say
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.160]  about that one is i got an email from someone in australia that i
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.040]  thought just summed it up very well when they said
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.840]  it's okay to question as long as you don't disagree
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:16.560]  and i think that's where we're headed and and so now we can't even it's it's
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.120]  okay to say our question our vaccines unsafe
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:22.960]  we can ask that question as long as we go ahead and get vaccinated anyways
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.400]  and we are really heading down to the path like you said most people over the
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.920]  age of 50 had measles mumps rubella chicken pox
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:33.760]  pertussis um that they went through a couple of weeks of being uncomfortable
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.160]  with a rash and a fever and some runny nose and and scratchy eyes
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:42.320]  and as long as they were well nourished and in our country had plenty of vitamin
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.720]  a in fact the world health organization policy was always when they did
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:50.560]  vaccination campaigns for the measles vaccines even in third world countries
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.480]  that previously they would go into these villages and give very high doses
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.720]  of vitamin a for two days before the shot the vitamin a at the
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.720]  very high levels like 400 000 units a day for two days
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:06.320]  and the reason for that is that the vitamin a would protect from the viral
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:09.520]  insult from the vaccine and the viruses in the vaccine
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:14.960]  incorporate the vitamin a into uh into their shell in their coat and that
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.320]  keeps any sort of disease or illness from happening and even
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.640]  children that had vitamin or that had measles if they got vitamin a it's
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.960]  shortened up the illness quite by many many days
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.200]  and they didn't have any serious outcomes so back when you and i were of the age
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.880]  of that measles was very prevalent chickenpox is very prevalent
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:38.000]  these were considered diseases of inconvenience
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.920]  that there's been lots of things that have been on the internet about
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.280]  you know like the brady bunch video that's out there that shows that all the
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.080]  kids had measles and had to stay home from schools and it was just so
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:51.680]  inconvenient and they sat around playing card games because they had to miss
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:55.280]  school it was never a big deal no we had parents would
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.080]  send us down to our neighbors who talked about this many times everybody our
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:01.600]  age knows that they found out that somebody down the street had measles
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.080]  they would send you down and hang out play with them so that you could get
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.360]  the measles what they didn't do dr tenpenny was to
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:11.120]  send me down and and get the measles from johnny and then send me to sally's
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:14.560]  house and get the mumps and then send me to joe's house and get rubella
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.760]  and continue on and on and on which is the other part of this
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:24.240]  the massive multiple vaccinations as dr wakefield pointed out they had a drop
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:28.320]  in autism when they stopped giving the mmr shots in
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:33.040]  japan and then it went up again and they were puzzled by this what's going on
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.840]  then he realized that in practice what they were doing was
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:39.280]  giving all three of these separate vaccine shots
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:43.200]  together on the same day they had seen a drop when they separated the shots out
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:46.560]  spaced them out when they gave them all on the same day they saw the autism rate
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:50.160]  go back up and that's what's happening now as
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:53.920]  recently as 1985 there really were only three vaccines
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.760]  there was the mmr vaccine the pertuss the dpt which is
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:01.920]  diphtheria tetanus and pertussis and a polio vaccine that has three different
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:05.920]  polio antigens in it as recently as 1985 it was only
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.600]  through those three vaccines we would spread them apart we wouldn't give them
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.440]  all together probably a lot of the kids didn't even get the whole series
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:16.720]  and then in 1991 is when the big ramp up started
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:21.040]  when they added hepatitis b at birth they added the hip vaccine at two months
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.560]  of age and then they continued to add vaccines along the way till
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:28.960]  well now children get 49 doses of 15 different vaccines by
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:32.880]  the time they start kindergarten and then when they add in the teen vaccines
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:36.960]  the pertussis booster the Gardasil the meningitis vaccine
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:40.560]  that by the time kids are now 18 and they get flu shots every year and they
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:45.760]  get tetanus boosters that they get over 69 doses of 16 different vaccines
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:50.320]  and so we how i don't know how even a slightly thinking person
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:54.480]  could look at that and say that was harmless and it was good for you and
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.120]  it was a must and these vaccine mandates that are
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.920]  coming down the road are very serious because it's not only about
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.160]  forcing parents to get vaccines that are currently in the vaccine schedule that
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.080]  perhaps they don't want but there are more than 200 vaccines
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.920]  in the schedule right now in the pipeline most of them being targeted
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:17.520]  towards adolescents and adults and for the pharmaceutical industry to have
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.960]  those protected they have to be on the childhood vaccination schedule
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:26.720]  so if we lose our right to refuse now and a right to refuse a flu shot for an
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:31.040]  order in exchange for a job or any sort of vaccines in order to be
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:35.680]  to go to a public education what's going to happen in another couple of years
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.720]  is that's all these additional vaccines rolled on the pipeline
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.360]  we won't have the ability to refuse those either
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:44.800]  you know it's not very good for the people of our country but of course it
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:48.960]  is very good for the pharmaceutical companies a second quarter of last year
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:52.880]  we had a list of the big companies that paid
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.840]  zero taxes guess who was at the top of that list
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:00.720]  merc two billion dollars and one quarter of profits
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:03.840]  no taxes and of course number two under them
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.440]  was seagate that we just found out is has a lot of infections
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:12.320]  inside their hard disk drives that are probably related to the NSA but still
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:16.320]  it's a large part of this is about the money and I'm concerned Dr. Tenpenny
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:20.240]  because as we saw the Ebola scare this last
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:24.320]  fall as we saw people being brought in by the CDC by the American government
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.000]  that had Ebola that they were not taking proper care because this
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.200]  disease was transmitted to people who were following the procedures of the
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.920]  CDC nevertheless they still caught this disease
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:37.040]  they were talking about the pharmaceutical drugs that they were
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.280]  creating the synthetics that they were creating
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:44.080]  to then they had not had these things evaluated they were saying we're going
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:46.880]  to have to get to the position if it's not this outbreak
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:50.080]  there's going to be an outbreak in the future where we're not going to have
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.000]  time to even pretend to do any testing they pretend that these
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.200]  vaccines are tested but they don't give us the information on it
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:01.360]  I'm concerned that they're going to have a outbreak they're going to say
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:05.120]  we haven't had time to evaluate this but we think it works
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:08.080]  and they're going to force everybody to take whatever it is that's a
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:12.960]  very very dangerous situation they've already set the laws in place for that
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:17.040]  that started back in 1986 with the national vaccine injury compensation
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:20.000]  program which it's way past time for that to be repealed
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.320]  because if the drug companies are going to make us take all the risk of the
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.760]  vaccines and the drugs and take all the risks that what might
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.600]  happen to us and have zero liability in fact if that
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:35.440]  product even kills you then something needs to change
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:38.480]  we are not allowed to know what information they have about the safety
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.960]  of the efficacy of it and of course we cannot sue them
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:44.880]  sue them it goes to a vaccine court which has paid out billions of dollars
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.240]  and damages say whether it's going to be right back with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:51.440]  and we're going to talk about these legal issues we're going to talk about
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:55.200]  informed consent that's very important we cannot lose that stay
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.920]  with us we'll be right back
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:02.240]  the month of february is all about valentine's day

[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:20.560]  february 20th 2015 we're talking to dr sherry tenpenny and of course uh she entered the news
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:25.440]  in a very big way in australia when they tried to ban her from entering the country
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.160]  because she was going to talk about vaccines about informed consent about us having information
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:38.480]  and about the necessity of having our consent do something to us now this was reported in the
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:45.120]  sydney morning sun on january the 7th they had had a interview as dr tenpenny pointed out on
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:52.320]  the australian broadcasting corporations radio and they said after that there was there were
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:57.840]  calls to block her from entering australia to bar her from entering australia saying her beliefs
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:04.720]  are a threat to society but dr tenpenny responded said no what i really am and what all of us are
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:10.080]  for the most part are pro information pro education completely for freedom of choice
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:16.160]  and informed consent so dr tenpenny i want to talk to you in this segment let's talk about the laws
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:21.280]  that are already in place you started to talk about that before because i said i'm concerned
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.680]  about what they're going to do in terms of how they're going to actually implement and and and take
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:30.640]  and actually use these laws that they have put into place i think they're preparing the public
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:37.520]  mentally with this scare over measles a minor childhood disease that was never considered
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:42.480]  to be life-threatening as we talked about they've already put some laws in place and a lot of laws
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:46.240]  are being proposed all over the country let's talk about some of those laws that are in place and
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:51.680]  the ones that are being proposed the one that was put into place in 1986 was the national
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:56.560]  vaccine injury compensation program and it was at that point in time that the pharmaceutical
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.200]  industry was getting sued left and right over the the problems with the pertussis vaccine
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:06.160]  most of the drug companies that were creating vaccines went out of business and several that
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:10.960]  were remaining went to then president reagan and said you've got to do something to protect us or
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:14.960]  because this is the cornerstone of our public health and that we have to have vaccines and
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:21.760]  without vaccines humanity probably won't survive and and so they passed this this law in 1986
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:27.440]  part of that law is the vaccine adverse event reporting system which is the VAIR system that is
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:32.320]  a passive collection of people who have had side effects and the side effects can be anything from
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:37.920]  a sore arm all the way up to a death anybody can report a problem and that's why the FDA doesn't
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:42.960]  take it very seriously they just think it's anecdotal anybody can report a problem unless
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:46.640]  they see some serious trends they don't pay any attention to it and I don't think most people
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.080]  know that that exists I think there's a lot of stuff that's under reported because most people
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:53.680]  don't know that they could report these symptoms there we didn't know about it with our children
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:27:00.400]  exactly and they actually have said that David Satcher who was the surgeon general at the time
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:05.600]  said that less than 10 percent of adverse events are actually reported whether that be a vaccine
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:12.480]  or a drug less than 10 percent so we know that about 12,000 VAIRs reports are filed every year
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:18.480]  and if that's only 10 percent that could mean as many as 120,000 reactions many of them serious
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:23.760]  are go under reported because nobody knows to report them and with that we've paid almost
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:28.800]  three billion dollars out in vaccine injury compensation claims even though only 25 percent
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:33.600]  of people actually file a claim actually get compensation and it can take years for that
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:37.920]  to happen how does that work out how does that vaccine compensation work out when we can't see
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:42.560]  the companies it's a vaccine court right well it's called the vaccine court which is a federal court
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:48.800]  of claims where you file a claim and if you in if you are only one only 25 percent of the people
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:54.400]  who file the claim get any compensation so and there are many people who have an injury to the
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:28:00.560]  vaccine that don't even qualify to file for a report or file a claim because there is a table
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.280]  it's called the vaccine injury table that says these are the only types of side effects that we
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:11.440]  will allow compensation for but what about all the other people that have serious lifelong
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:17.200]  complications that start outside the window of what the the table lays out there and they
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:22.240]  they can't get any claim they're just they're just they are just um um they're just hazards
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:27.200]  of the system they are just disposable disposable people that they just sacrifice themselves for
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:31.280]  the greater good or their children and there's nothing there's no compensation you can't see
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.880]  the doctor the hospital the manufacturers the government you are just stuck with your lifelong
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:41.360]  of bad disease and no money to help you pay to get better so the vaccine court is another one
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:46.560]  of these nonsense courts like the faiza court like the traffic court like the tax court where
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:50.320]  you don't have any rights you don't have any representation you don't have a jury it's just
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:55.200]  a whitewash for the industry it's an absolute kangaroo court in fact the people who are who
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:00.400]  are the judges so to speak they don't they don't even call them judges they call them special masters
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:05.200]  and they are appointed they have no medical background and so they already most for the most
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:10.240]  part are pro vaccine they listen to the pro vaccine side of the equation and they politely
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:14.640]  listen to the other side and then say no i don't think this has anything to do with it there are
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:20.400]  very few cases for which the vaccines have have that they have been adjudicated in the favor of the
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.680]  we got to go to a break dr tim penny we're going to come back and talk about this more but i want
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:28.560]  to say to the people on the left the ones who are most strident and calling for the elimination
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:33.680]  of informed consent understand that this was ronald reagan who created this kangaroo court this
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:39.280]  vaccination court the same time he was creating mandatory minimums that filled up our prisons
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.760]  to the bursting point caused us to have to release violent criminals so we could put people away from
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:50.320]  minor drug offenses say what this will be right back with dr tim penny we're on the march the empires
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:30:02.160]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network the month of february is all about valentine's day

[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:57.680]  tin penny imc dot com and we were just talking in the last segment about the history of the
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:04.240]  government's protection of the vaccine companies going back to 1986 where ronald reagan removed
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:09.600]  the ability of people who suffer adverse effects from the drug companies vaccines
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:15.520]  removed their ability to sue the vaccine companies instead they set up this kangaroo court
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:22.480]  with special masters who would allocate money based on people who have been injured on vaccines
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:25.920]  you wouldn't have a real court just like we don't have real courts for virtually anything
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:32.160]  anymore whether it's traffic court or whether it's uh the fiza court it's just a kangaroo
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.800]  legal system that we have now and most people don't even uh try even in a criminal case they
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:42.480]  don't even look for a jury trial because we've been lied to for so long about what juries are for
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:48.560]  they feel that they were just uh cop to one of the pleas and avoid a trial altogether but i think
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:52.800]  it's very important for us to talk to dr tin penny of course they were very strident about
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:57.040]  shutting down her message in australia there were bomb threats when they were not able to bar her
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:01.920]  from entering the country as the person who was working with her to get her to speak in australia
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:06.560]  pointed out stefanie messengers she said we can't get doctors in australia to talk about the
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:11.760]  risk of vaccination because they've been warned by the medical board that they will be stricken
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:17.760]  from the register in other words they're going to lose their license to practice just as lawyers
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:22.640]  who inform people in court about the true purpose of a jury that you are there to judge not only
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:27.360]  the law but the way it's being applied uh not only the facts of the case but the way the law is
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:31.440]  being applied whether you agree with that law if you are a lawyer and you tell that to a jury
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:36.880]  most cases you're going to get disbarred so it's a real war against information that's
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:41.920]  why we talk about it as being the info war it really is about information and they don't want
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:46.800]  you to be informed and they don't want your consent and i want to go back to uh dr tin penny i want
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:54.640]  to continue talking about the legal history of uh protecting the vaccine companies as well as the
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:59.920]  things that they've already put in place to enact a kind of medical tyranny go ahead uh dr
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:04.960]  tim penny we were just talking about the vaccine court and uh continue on with that and and what
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:12.000]  they've done since then in terms of laws they put in that would force us to take vaccines well as
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:18.720]  if the national vaccine injury compensation program in 1986 wasn't bad enough it was in about 2004
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:24.320]  that they passed something called addendum e and that's posted on my vaccine website which is
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:31.120]  dr ten penny dot com and there is a downloadable pdf file that will be up there later today or next
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:35.280]  or in the next couple of days that i will share with all of the info war wars listeners and i
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:41.360]  wrote about it a lot in my book called fowl bird flu it's not what you think and what addendum e was
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:47.920]  was the next level ramping up of complete protection for the pharmaceutical industry that
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:53.440]  unless you could prove intent that they were intending to create a product a product either
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:37:00.160]  a vaccine or a drug to that to kill you and you died from this product you had even less
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:06.160]  ability to have any sort of recourse than what the national injury compensation program gave you
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:10.880]  it was putting into place the fast tracking of vaccines and drugs if we needed them for
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:16.880]  a terrorism or a bioterrorism sort of activity there was no compensation whatsoever and the
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:24.160]  person who pushed that through was then senator fritz from tennessee who again was another republican
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:29.200]  and he wanted to push this through and it gave complete protection to the pharmaceutical industry
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:35.360]  it was tacked on at the end of a dense of a defense appropriation bill at the end of the session
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:40.800]  when most of the people who were on the committee had already gone home for christmas break and
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.480]  they swore that they were going to revisit this after they returned from the christmas break
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:50.560]  which they never did and so that is already on the books to protect them from all liability going
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:56.400]  forward the other thing that is now coming into play is the all the laws that are being pushed
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:04.320]  forward in a very rapid illogical fashion to revoke all of the exemptions that we have had in
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:11.040]  place since the early 1900s for the right to refuse vaccines all 50 states have had a medical
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:17.280]  exemption 48 states have had a religious exemption with the exception of west virginia in mississippi
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:21.600]  and we've had 20 states that have had what's called a philosophical exemption which means you
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:26.400]  look at the risk of the vaccine and you compare it to the risk of the illness and say i don't think
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:31.520]  so i think i can keep my children healthy by other means well since this whole measles nonsense
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:37.440]  has rolled forward they are now fast tracking these bills all across the country in fact if you go to
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:44.480]  the nvicadvocacy.org website which tracks all of these bills that are coming forward you will see
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:50.720]  that there are anywhere between three and five bills in every state to repeal all rights to refuse
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:56.400]  in fact right before i came on the show today i got an email that washington state which historically
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:00.880]  has had a philosophical exemption and a couple of years ago they limited that and said that you
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:04.400]  have to in order to get your philosophical exemption you have to have an appointment with
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:10.400]  a doctor and go through an indoctrination episode and now all of the they have passed the law
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:17.280]  passed a committee that's gone into full law to completely reveal repeal all rights to refuse
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:22.400]  in the state of washington and this just happened just in the last 48 hours and that's really a
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:26.960]  sad thing because well we do have one piece of good news and i'll pass this on to you we've been
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:34.800]  contacted by a representative david sewicki in main he has sponsored a main house a bill called
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:40.000]  my body my choice is an act to make it illegal to require anyone to receive a vaccine against their
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  free will that is though the minority report as you pointed out in virtually all these states we
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.840]  have a lot of bills are being prepared to take away our exemption as they call it this is the way
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:56.240]  that they talk when they talk about you know tax exemption or they talk about a tax cut being
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:01.040]  an expenditure in other words all your money belongs to them unless they exempt it from being
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:06.640]  taken away and then of course that's an expenditure we are not allowed to have as they're talking
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:10.560]  about in california they say we want to eliminate the personal belief exemption of course it's
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:15.840]  being pushed very heavily by the la times personal belief that's what we used to call
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:22.560]  information being informed and then an exemption is what we used to say was consent but now they
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:27.680]  have completely twisted this around i think it's also interesting doctor ten penny as you pointed
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:33.440]  out the connections between uh ronald reagan who put in the protection from being sued in 1986
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:40.400]  and then the representative who pushed in this 2004 addendum to remove even more liability
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:44.080]  from the pharmaceutical companies also being a republican i think it's very interesting when
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:49.440]  we look at how meghan kelly of fox news comes in and says well yeah it's big brother but sometimes
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:54.480]  you need big brother you know when you need big brother it's when the guy who owns your network
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:41:00.000]  rupert murdoch has a son who's been sitting on the board for a number of years on glaxosmith
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.360]  kline when you're intimately tied into the pharmaceutical industry when they pay for most
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:10.560]  of the commercials that you put on your uh network that's when you have to have big brother when you
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:15.920]  got to force people to buy products from your corporate sponsors and i find that this we're
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:22.480]  in a very dangerous situation right here because we know that the gop is very closely linked to
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:29.360]  the pharmaceutical company and industry and we know that the democrats love the idea of mandates
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:34.480]  and so they're pushing for this everywhere uh it's this is a very concerning time doctor ten
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:38.640]  penny i think they've got a really good chance of putting this through unless we get some kind
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:42.960]  of a coalition that goes across these political lines it breaks this kind of mind so that we need
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:48.960]  to mandate things and breaks this connection of crony capitalism that's uh rampant in the republican
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:56.080]  party back in 2010 there was a policy that came out it was called the healthy people 2020 policy
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:01.520]  and they've been doing this every 10 years for to push forth public health agendas and it started
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:06.480]  in the 80s and every 10 years they evaluated where they had moved this public health agenda moving
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:12.320]  forward and in 2010 there was this big celebratory thing that happened because the next 10 years
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:18.800]  between 2010 and 2020 was going to be the year to push forward all of these vaccine mandates
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:26.880]  to allow to disallow people the right to refuse to make as a an obligation of employment for in
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:31.520]  the health care industry not only nurses and doctors but anybody else that works in health
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:37.200]  care including people in the it department and volunteers in order to have not only a flu shot
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:44.160]  but all of the vaccines that have been approved by the ASIP the approval committee that they
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:50.880]  should have all of these vaccines and be up to date on all of them as a requirement for employment
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:56.160]  that was part of these healthy people 2020 rules so what we're seeing now in terms of taking away
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:43:01.200]  the exemptions pushing the flu shots on health care workers the next phase will be the additional
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:05.920]  shots like the pneumonia shot and all of those things there's another policy statement that just
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:12.880]  came out on the 15th of February which is an entire vaccine agenda pushing towards adolescents
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:18.720]  and adults somewhere between 20 and 30 more vaccines in that schedule and this is where we're
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:24.800]  going if people don't understand that the right to refuse is not about the measles shot it's not
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:29.840]  about whether you're a bad parent whether or not you get your kids a couple of these vaccines
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:36.560]  it's about what is barreling down the track at us in a very near future and I would I would maintain
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:43.440]  that many of the very leftists are very liberal pro-vaccine rabid pro-vaccine people that don't
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:49.120]  even understand that what is coming down on them they may not want to have a shot that requires
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:55.040]  them to get something for obesity or depression or for periodontal disease or for their high blood
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:59.920]  pressure and they may not have a right to refuse that yeah we have a full-scale medical tyranny as
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:03.200]  you point out this is a plan they had in place talking about how they're going to roll this out
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:09.440]  between 2010 and 2020 here we are at the midpoint and they're putting all the legislation in place
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:15.280]  this is this is something I just don't understand I know there's a knee jerk reaction amongst many
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:20.800]  on the left to give all power to the state to force people to do stuff but as you point out can't
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:26.720]  they see where this is headed in a full-scale medical tyranny I just don't understand their mindset
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:31.520]  and not only will it become about vaccines I mean where when they first started mandating flu shots
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:36.480]  for healthcare workers set about three years ago I had seen this coming for five or six years before
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:42.960]  that and I said where is this going to stop that they require someone to be injected with a substance
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:47.840]  against their will that's not like a b12 shot or a vitamin shot it's something that can cause them
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:53.360]  serious harm in some cases even cause them to die and the vaccine injury compensation program in the
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:58.720]  last two years has paid out more compensation for people injured by the flu shot than for any other
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:03.840]  vaccine and I think it's because they're requiring so many people to have it so are we going where are
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:07.600]  we going to stop with that is it going to be all the vaccines is it going to be if you're having
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:12.400]  a bad day you're required to have your pros act if it's at your if your cholesterol level normal
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:18.560]  is less than 200 and yours is 201 you must take your Lipitor you will be denied health insurance
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:23.600]  are we going to be required to have these things to get on an airplane to renew our driver's license
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:29.520]  to to go into a liquor store to prove that we can be out in public I mean where is this tyranny
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:33.840]  going to stop full-scale control you won't be able to travel you won't be able to work we've
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:38.800]  already seen this happen to the medical community we've seen have many people who call in we ask
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:42.960]  people to call in and tell us about the adverse reactions that they've had to vaccines and of
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:47.200]  course we're going to be taking calls on on that and on anything else you'd like to call in in the
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:52.240]  next hour I'll be giving that number out later on but people will call in and say I had to take
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:57.440]  this because it was in the military I had to take it because I was a healthcare worker they're going
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:00.880]  to extend that to everybody they're not going to as you pointed out they're not going to let you
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:05.120]  travel they're not going to let your kids get into school they're going to essentially quarantine
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.680]  you out of society with this kind of medical tyranny and of course they're not going to stop
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:14.560]  there they will kick the door down at some point and come in and shoot you with a vaccine if you
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:18.720]  don't shoot them with a gun first that's where it's really going to come down to so we we really
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:24.560]  need to fight this at this point we need to wake up to what is the the logical result of this
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:29.600]  and dr. penny ten penny I think that we look at this and we say look at the presidents that
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:34.800]  they're establishing the way that they are setting the public up with their mindset just
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:38.640]  talking about this measles thing we know that's just a small part of it that's not really the full
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:43.040]  agenda they're just using that right now we've been talking about fordating the water for a
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:48.320]  long time whether you believe what we're saying about our health concerns about that how do you
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:54.320]  ever justify mass medicating the public through the water supply for anything you can't control
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:47:00.160]  the dosage when you put it into the water supply we have legitimate dosages for anything so you have
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:06.000]  a child who is maybe you know you don't know what kind of level that they're going to get because
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.240]  you can't control the concentration of that when you just dump it into the water supply they might
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:15.120]  get something that is many times higher than you would give to an adult male so that's what
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:18.960]  we're concerned about if you establish that as a principle and that's what this is all about
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:24.400]  that's what this measles epidemic is about that they're talking about forcing people to take vaccines
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:30.640]  they establish these precedents of mass medication of taking away your informed consent and they've
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:35.280]  got some things down the line that we should all be very concerned about whether we're Republicans
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:42.000]  Democrats left or right oh absolutely and you know not only do they have that you know all the
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.800]  all the the fluoride in the water but there have been several studies that have come out now showing
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:52.480]  all of the pharmaceuticals that are in the water yes my knowledge there's no real filters out there
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:56.560]  to be able to filter out all these different pharmaceuticals because some of them are really
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:00.880]  small molecules some of them are very large molecules and so we're getting our dose of
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:05.280]  daily pro DAC in our tap water every day yeah absolutely we've seen that with the fish they
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:11.520]  talk about how the fish are behaving strangely and and reacting to these SSRI drugs because as you
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:16.800]  pointed out the water systems are not filtering that out the water treatment systems are not set
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:21.520]  up to filter those pharmaceuticals out so they're accumulating and building in the water supply
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:27.200]  and even with children with vaccines with this one size fits all vaccination policy
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:32.240]  that is only set up for the convenience of doctor visits in the insurance company
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:37.600]  that they are to get these vaccines at birth two months four months six months one year
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:42.480]  and pre kindergarten it's all set up on that schedule at the convenience of the farmers of
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:47.840]  the insurance industry and they all the vaccines are given at the same dose at the same way so it
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:53.440]  doesn't matter if you are a six pound premature baby or if you're a 12 pound baby you get the
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:57.600]  same dose and the same thing happens all the way up the scale there's another thing that's
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:02.320]  that very not very many people know about is about half of the vaccines in the when you get the
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:06.640]  little vial and there's the gray stopper at the top that you put the needle through in about half
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:12.720]  of the vaccines that is in a very inert rubber it's a gray rubber that's very inert causes no
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:18.160]  side effects no reactions in another half of the vaccines those rubber stoppers are still contain
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:24.400]  large amounts of latex so they sensitize people to latex through that rubber stopper and because
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:28.320]  you don't know which one of those that you're getting unless you know the manufacturer you may
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:32.960]  get in beginning a lot of sensitization to latex which increases your incidence of asthma and
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:39.440]  allergies increases your reaction to foods and all of these things are happening behind the scenes
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:44.160]  to confuse people so that they're not getting all of the same vaccine because if we were all
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:48.320]  getting all the same vaccine and it was dose related to our age and to our weight and we're
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:52.560]  taking into consideration things like family history and whether your parents had a vaccine
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:57.520]  reaction we would have we would have a completely different conversation but instead it's this
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:03.680]  militant tyranny to make sure we were all inoculated with all of these substances that's very interesting
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:10.000]  because latex allergies were essentially and I'd never heard of that before I became an adult
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:17.760]  just a couple of decades ago now it's fairly fairly prevalent and it's amazing to see how
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:23.280]  these different things like that like autism as you pointed out we can't get that they're not
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:28.800]  interested in studying it or in terms of releasing those studies to us but they also by putting some
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:34.160]  of them out with an inert rubber and putting some of them out with a latex it confuses it it muddies
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:39.840]  the water we can't get a good epidemiological study about the real effects of this and I think
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:44.320]  it's deliberate I think I picked up that you believe that it's deliberate too don't you Dr.

[01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:12.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're talking to Dr. Tenpenny Dr.
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:18.160]  Sherry Tenpenny she was kept out of Australia because they didn't want people to hear her
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:24.000]  message about informed consent her questioning of the safety and the efficacy of the vaccines
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.480]  in the last segment we were talking about how the government has moved to protect the vaccine
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:34.000]  companies from litigation what does that tell you what does it tell you that they have to be
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.920]  protected from being sued what does it tell you that they want to demand that you be forced to
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:43.360]  take their products shouldn't you demand to be informed shouldn't you demand that they have
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:48.960]  to get your consent shouldn't you demand your rights and as you pointed out though we've got
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:55.760]  bills pretty much in every state that are coming out to force mandated vaccines to remove our
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:55:00.800]  informed consent Dr. Tenpenny tell us where we can get information from you you're a wealth of
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:05.360]  information you've got a lot of you've got several different websites here tell us where we can go
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:10.880]  to get more information well one closing comment David that I think is really important is that
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:16.160]  the politicians in your state and the politicians in Washington only care about two things they
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:21.280]  care about votes and they care about money and right now we are really in a fight for our life
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:27.280]  it's a race to the finish line to protect our rights on a state level and so every one of your
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:34.320]  listeners really needs to go to nvicadvocacy.org get signed up for your own states start letting
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:38.640]  people know that you've got to protect your right to refuse not only what is on the schedule today
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:44.560]  but what's coming for more information from me you can get that at drtenpenny.com which is dr
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:51.280]  tenpenny just like at sounds.com my my my facebook page is Dr. Tenpenny on vaccines
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:55.440]  and I have another site that's called the vaccine research library which is vaccine
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:56:01.920]  research library.com where we've collected more than 6500 mainstream medical articles
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:06.480]  that show problems associated with vaccines you can sign up there for free for two weeks
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:12.080]  get information about mmr aluminum and pertussis and hopefully spread the word that vaccines are
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:17.600]  not safe they're not effective they don't protect you and they do cause harm and we'll have those
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:22.320]  links on the youtube video of this interview that'll be on the alex jones youtube channel
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:26.720]  and if you're not a subscriber to our youtube channel please become a subscriber you'll see

[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:35.440]  and of course we would ask that you support our operation by subscribing to uh prison planet tv
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:40.400]  where you'll get the nightly news each night and be able to share that with 20 people now the one
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:44.480]  that is talking about the bills that are being introduced in all the different states if uh let
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:50.480]  me repeat that one again Dr. Tenpenny that's nvicadvocacy.org is that correct that's correct
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:55.280]  that's correct and when you go there for your particular state and you register you will only
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:57:00.080]  get alerts alerts about your state so you're not going to be inundated if you're in pennsylvania
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:04.320]  you're not going to know about oklahoma so you're just going to know about the states that are very
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:09.360]  important to you and they will tell you this is a good bill encourage your your representatives
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:13.600]  to vote for this one this is a bad bill it's going to take away your rights encourage your
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:19.360]  representatives to vote no on this bill this is the most urgent point in time we've ever had with
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:24.480]  this issue everyone who cares about their freedom about what's going on with their lives the lives
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:28.800]  of their children and your grandchildren you must get involved you must get involved that's very
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:34.080]  important and i think we can have much more effect at the local at the state level uh people knowing
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:39.440]  what is coming up in their particular state being able to go in i i think the people who are concerned
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:43.440]  about this the people who are informed about this the people who demand that they have individual
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:48.160]  liberty those are people who will really stand up and fight in most cases because they're looking
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:51.680]  at this issue they understand the threat that it is to their freedoms they understand the threat
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:56.240]  that it is to their health to the life of themselves and their families and i think if they can
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:01.280]  network together that's very important we need to not only just stop the bad bills that are going
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:06.800]  to remove our informed consent but we need to put it in law as this representative in main the my
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:11.920]  body my choice as he put it an act to make it illegal to require anyone to receive a vaccine
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:16.320]  against their free will what's so controversial about that that ought to be the default position
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:20.960]  in america unfortunately it isn't we're going to have to fight thank you so much dr tenpenny for

[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:20.960]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:33.280]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this friday february 20th 2015 i'm david night i'm your host
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:38.720]  this hour we're going to be taking your calls at 800-259-9231 we're going to pretty much open this
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:47.680]  up to any topic we were talking in the last hour to dr sherry tenpenny who was basically kept from
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:53.120]  speaking in australia first they had strident calls for the immigration department there to not
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:56.560]  allow her to get into the country to bar her from the country when they failed to do that
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:02.640]  they started having a gun bomb threats at the various venues where she was going to speak so
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:09.760]  they essentially canceled her being able to talk about vaccines about science about your
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:15.680]  informed consent because that's fundamentally what it's about that is the substrate if we lose
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:21.440]  the concept of informed consent then we have lost everything in this country we are no longer
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:25.840]  anything but slaves and guinea pigs to the government that was a vital part of the nuremberg
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:32.080]  code to say that this happened because they ignored informed consent and we know how this is going to
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:38.000]  play down if we are if we allow the big business interests as well as the authoritarians in government
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:45.280]  to make these kind of demands on us we also have of course the FCC which is trying to expand its
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:50.800]  jurisdiction trying to get control of the internet now they say that it's there to keep the internet
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:57.440]  open and free to preserve net neutrality that's not what it's going to be it's going to be about
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:03.200]  a shutdown of the internet they know that they're losing the information war they want to shut down
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:08.080]  the information just as they wanted to keep dr tenpenny from speaking in australia we had a
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:12.640]  special report last night from leon macadoo on the nightly news i want to play this about what's
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:17.920]  really going on behind the scenes of the plans to shut down the internet the secret plans to
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:36.000]  shut down the internet here's that report so just what is obama's proposed net neutrality plan
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:41.520]  well that's the problem nobody quite knows for sure the FCC has made it clear that they will
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:49.680]  not release the 332 page plan to regulate the internet until after the agency votes on it
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:53.280]  other times we've heard this we've got to pass it to find out what's in it
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:57.760]  it hasn't really fared well for the american consumer now one of the FCC commissioners
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:03.600]  asiat pie has gone rogue he's been publishing a few articles in recent weeks these are press
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:09.360]  releases that other FCC leadership has moved to block and he's basically warning citizens
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:16.160]  and lawmakers that this net neutrality is a bad deal pie writes while the plan contains
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:22.800]  no shortage of regulations the most problematic may be the new internet conduct rule it's a vague
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:28.480]  rule that gives the FCC almost unfettered discretion to micromanage virtually every
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:34.320]  aspect of the internet including the choices that consumers have for accessing it this includes
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:41.040]  restricting service plan options including unlimited online streaming as well as low price
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:47.520]  prepaid voice plans which are used by millions of low income households when consumers have
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:54.560]  more choices they can find lower prices but the FCC wants to do away with anything but one size
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:04:01.280]  fits all plans think of it like how all of your health insurance plans now include prenatal care
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:07.680]  even if you're a 75 year old retiree allowing for new business models is critical to promote
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:13.440]  competition how can we expect entrepreneurs to stand out from their competition if they aren't
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:19.360]  able to compete with a standardized plan clearly the president's plan is only going to benefit
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:26.480]  the existing internet giants but the issue is the internet isn't broke we don't need the president
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:33.200]  to fix it pie says the internet is an unparalleled success story it is a free open and thriving
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:39.680]  platform for civic and political engagement economic growth educational opportunity entertainment
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:46.000]  and much more it has made the united states the epicenter of innovation plus you can see the rest
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:53.360]  of that report up on alex jones's youtube channel the example of government overreach yet again we
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:57.440]  see secret plans that we're not allowed to know what it is until they pass it stay with us we'll

[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:45.840]  in most of all the states trying to enact mandatory vaccination schedules we need to
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:51.760]  to understand that we really though can have an impact and we can see how this is playing out in a
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:58.000]  number of areas we've had uh success in terms of shutting down the federal government in terms of
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:02.560]  drug prohibition and some of the liberal states and some of the conservative states we're having
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:07.360]  success in terms of shutting down encroachments on the second amendment of course they're coming
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:12.080]  for the full enchilada they're coming after the first amendment as well that's what all these
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:17.920]  attacks on the internet are about that we just heard that report from leon macadoo the fact
[02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:23.440]  that they are doing this secretly they're not showing what they're going to do to the FCC although
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:29.920]  some details as she reported have leaked we see though that we're we've had a lot of victories
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:35.120]  just in the last few weeks on the second amendment here's one example this is from shallnot.org
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:42.080]  by a five to one vote there's been a bill passed in arizona to reject federal gun control this is
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:47.120]  passed in committee this is going on so this is this is a senate committee this is going on to
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:53.040]  the full house and senate so you need to be aware of this and to support this now we've seen
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:10:01.280]  the south dakota house just pass a constitutional carry bill this last week be aware of what's
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:07.040]  happening in your area this is where you can really have an effect at the state level if you
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:11.840]  connect up with people who are interested in the same kinds of freedom issues that you are whether
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:16.640]  it's maintaining informed consent whether it's establishing and maintaining your right to keep
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:23.040]  and bear arms you can have pressure you can help to put pressure on these legislators but we do
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:27.840]  have some good legislators who are doing the right things as i point out five to one vote in
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:34.400]  arizona to pass to reject federal gun control and what they would do in this bill it would prohibit
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:39.760]  any state agencies or employees from enforcing or even assisting in the enforcement of any new
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:45.840]  federal act law order rule or regulation that would restrict gun ownership of personal firearms
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:51.200]  within arizona now they point out in this article that this is similar to one that was signed into
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:56.880]  law in Idaho last year so we've already gotten that fully passed in Idaho same thing to stop the
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:03.520]  federal government from encroaching on our personal liberties recognized by the constitution
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:07.840]  prohibited from the federal the federal government is prohibited from infringing on those rights by
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:12.480]  the second amendment nevertheless they still try to do it but we can shut them down at the state level
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:18.160]  that's what ron paul was talking about when he was talking about de facto uh secession he was
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:23.120]  talking about nullification he was talking about shutting down these encroachments these violations
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:28.240]  of the constitution at the federal level shutting them down at the state level so this is something
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:33.520]  that passed into law in Idaho last year it was passed by the montana house this month so we've
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:38.720]  got a couple of bills that are in the works there listen to what's going on in texas we just had the
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:46.480]  new governor of texas greg abbott in his first state of the state address said this let me briefly
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:52.240]  follow up on a word i mentioned a moment ago liberty and a single word it encapsulates what
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:59.600]  this country stands for what texas symbolizes and then he goes on to say i will expand liberty in texas
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:07.120]  by signing a law that makes texas the 45th state to allow open carry open carry we can get concealed
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:13.920]  carry but open carry is prohibited here in texas with pistol so guess what sheriff woody is finally
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:19.920]  going to get a gun for that empty holster of his right here in texas but that's the way it should be
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:24.320]  that's the way it should be we got a good governor hopefully that's going to be with us on a lot of
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:30.720]  liberty issues i like what he had to say there we see a report from breitbart saying that a
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:36.720]  researcher has come back and pushed back against people who are saying that no defensive use of
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:43.040]  guns isn't anywhere near what you said we had a researcher who years ago as part of the national
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:48.720]  self-defense survey his name is gary cleck he's a professor at florida state university
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:54.160]  his criminology professor uh he has pushed back now when people push back pushing back on his
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:13:01.440]  research he did research and found that he what he said was a minimum of 760 000 defensive uses of
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:10.000]  guns annually he was criticized on these findings that went back to 1997 98 and 2001 they refuted
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:16.720]  those criticisms at the time and now politico comes back and pushes against that yet again and so he
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:23.440]  points out the case behind his statistics yet again he said survey respondents are actually
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:30.240]  under reporting crime victimization experiences he said consider this in the early 90s and the
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:35.360]  mid 90s when he was looking at this data he said respondents who used a gun defensively not only had
[02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:41.360]  to admit using the gun but in most cases they had to admit to a degree of criminal behavior
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:47.360]  in as much as they had the gun with him in a public place before concealed carry was as widespread
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:53.120]  as it is today in other words a lawful use of a firearm was more likely to be carried out by
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:57.920]  someone who possessed the firearm in a manner for which there was not legal sanction so therefore
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:04.320]  those people were reluctant to talk about it so he said yeah we found 760 000 cases of defensive
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:12.000]  uses of guns it was far under reported from what really happened so we see a lot of good movement
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:17.280]  here on this so we're winning the argument we're winning and state legislators such as late state
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:24.240]  legislatures but we've got california again on the wrong side california we've got a law that was
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:30.480]  signed by governor arnold schwarzenegger back in 2007 he signed a law that would go into effect in
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:38.080]  2013 and listen to what this would do this would essentially require that all handguns manufactured
[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:44.720]  after 2013 would include firing pins that were capable of stamping each and every shell with
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:52.080]  a unique and traceable mark now they didn't have any technology to do that in 2007 they still don't
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:59.200]  have any technology to do that in 2015 and so for the last couple of years it's been a de facto
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:05.200]  prohibition of all new guns being sold in the state this is what smith and wesson said in a statement
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:12.640]  he said a number of studies have indicated that micro stamping is unreliable it serves no safety
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:19.840]  purpose it is cost prohibitive and most importantly it's not proven to aid at all in preventing or
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:25.360]  solving crimes nevertheless california is pushing on with this so now this case is being challenged
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:32.400]  on a constitutional basis before a judge saying this is nothing than a veiled a thinly veiled attempt
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:38.800]  to abridge the freedom that we have as human beings to protect ourselves the freedom that is
[02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:43.360]  recognized in the second amendment to the constitution so that is before a judge but you
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:49.840]  know the reality of it is whether it's on banning all handguns with this silly little fantasy
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:55.040]  device that is nothing but science fiction as they point out it's never existed it can't be
[02:15:55.040 --> 02:16:00.720]  made uh banning that because they don't have this science fiction device on them it's the same thing
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:04.880]  that they're doing in california saying they're going to get rid of the personal belief exemption
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:09.120]  that is simply their way of saying they're going to get rid of informed consent it would sound
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:12.720]  pretty authoritarian if they said they were going to get rid of informed consent so they
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:17.440]  change it to something else let's go to michael in florida michael you want to talk about vaccines
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:31.520]  yes i do go ahead hi uh i'm michael yes you're live i am yes you're live i am michael from florida
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:39.280]  yes uh i just want to point out to you uh the article that uh you talked about about the fda
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:48.960]  and the the uh clinical trials uh i read that complete article on the 18th of february and
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:54.160]  something i'd like to point out to to you and your listeners by the way i hope you and your
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:17:03.520]  family's staff are well uh what i'd like to point out is that out of the 600 clinical case studies
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:18.480]  that they did they could only find 100 of the 600 that they did that uh uh they could hide the
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:26.400]  pharmaceutical company too in other words they reacted so many yes that's very important heavily
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:30.480]  redacted just like it was some kind of an nsa document did you say you wrote that article or
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:37.200]  you you read it no i'm not right it was actually the article was the uh they were in the 18th and
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:50.720]  zero hedge uh and it was posted uh 18 30 which is 6 30 p.m and they actually uh not only not only
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:18:00.400]  did they cover up they actually made sure the pharmaceutical company names were not involved
[02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:05.520]  in the fda reports yes that's what we're talking about in terms of regulatory capture people think
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:10.720]  hey you know the science is finished on this and it's like the science hasn't even been done
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:14.960]  we're not being allowed to see the results of the science and when they do studies and the
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:19.680]  studies as we see in this case of this uh fda article as you're pointing out when the studies
[02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:24.960]  show that something is dangerous and unproven you've got their buddies in the fda who really
[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:29.200]  work for the pharmaceutical companies they've been captured by the pharmaceutical companies
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:35.200]  it's regulatory capture they cover up this they redacted as if it was some kind of a
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:41.440]  national security secret because really i guess it is because um national security that the nation
[02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:45.920]  is essentially run by these giant corporations pharmaceutical companies banks and others like
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:50.320]  that they essentially run the government so i guess it is a question of national security
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:57.840]  it's the security of their profits isn't it michael okay let's go to uh jason in texas jason

[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:29.360]  of quick news items the number of corporations in the us is at the lowest level seen in 40 years
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:36.720]  40 years tax foundations report titled america's shrinking corporate sector says there's a million
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:42.320]  few corporations fewer corporations than there were in 1986 it's because of economic and regulatory
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:47.600]  burdens and guess what that's by design the large companies we've been talking about the
[02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:54.320]  fda regulatory capture how the fda the cdc work with the pharmaceutical industry protecting them
[02:24:54.320 --> 02:25:00.160]  well of course the other part of this is that most of the large corporations have embraced
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:05.440]  the government regulations that will keep out their competition will shut down their competition
[02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:11.520]  whether it's taxes or regulations they seem to be able to escape these taxes and regulations
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:17.040]  we said murk got uh two billion dollars in the second quarter of last year paid no taxes that's
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:22.000]  the way it works but it also works when they get their industry regulated they somehow seem to be
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:28.400]  able to sail through these regulations just like the vaccine companies don't have to worry about
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:34.320]  lawsuits from the people that they damage with their product you know this is a serious thing
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:39.200]  because it's a factor of the american dream dying the american dream was never about having a home
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:44.160]  mortgage and that's really what's been sold to most people the american dream was about starting
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:50.320]  your own business and that's being shut down because of the economic situation but mainly
[02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:55.760]  because the burdens that have been placed on us predominantly by the federal government another
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:26:02.160]  article switzerland is flexing its parliamentary muscle scrutinizing hsbc of course this is in
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:09.760]  uh tax dodging efforts but also there is the money laundering uh issues that have been scrutinized by
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:16.480]  that hsbc was essentially given a slap on the hand by the air colder department of justice
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:23.200]  and guess what the person that obama has nominated to take his place loretta lynch was
[02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:30.320]  very much involved in that decision of just giving the big banks the pass and saying essentially
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:35.680]  that they were too big to jail it was the air colder administration of the department of justice
[02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:41.360]  that said there's nothing no interest of the public's in in sending any of these people to jail
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:46.400]  let me tell you something they would send any other person to jail in a heartbeat just not the
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:52.080]  people who are running the big banks and in other banking news we see that this crisis that's going
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:58.960]  on in the eu over the greek debt that was being negotiated yesterday and of course germany vetoed
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:06.880]  the idea that greece would be given a six month extension and as part of that discussion as that
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:12.960]  was being live blogged by the telegraph in the uk they pointed out that the european central bank
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:19.920]  was forced to deny reports that it had discussed capital controls you understand what that's about
[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:24.640]  that's about saying you can't move your money one of the things that came out in this report they
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:30.960]  said the ecb has moved to increase its cap on emergency support for lenders this is not guaranteed
[02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:36.560]  until after the end of the month so they're going to continue to emergency support for lenders but
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:40.320]  at the end of the month they are not going to do that so things are really coming to a head there's
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:46.800]  a real animosity building between the nation of greece and germany they seem to be at loggerheads
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:52.160]  over this alan greenspan believes that greece is going to exit the eu if that happens if that sets
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:57.760]  a precedent what's that going to do for the rest of the eu we've got a lot of political movements
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:03.440]  throughout europe that are wanting to get out of the eu and of course the eu is a very important
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:10.560]  part of global government they created the eu they created nafta these trading organizations these
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:18.640]  consolidations these are all part of a stepping stone and the next step in the stone is to unite
[02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:24.080]  these organizations with the transatlantic with the trans specific partnerships uh what happens
[02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:30.080]  though if those blocks that they have created start to unravel i don't know we'll have to say
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:38.480]  let's go to uh peter in washington go ahead peter can you hear me yes i can you're on go ahead

[02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:39.840]  sorry we got to the break you were just building up to the point you wanted to make about uh history
[02:34:39.840 --> 02:34:46.640]  about smithley butler's claims about uh the patriarch of the bush family uh being involved
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:54.240]  in a uh coup go ahead yes i don't like the bushes but i don't believe in in liars and communists
[02:34:55.920 --> 02:35:02.880]  getting away with anything um yeah the claim that was made was that that these men were would
[02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:09.760]  we're going to finance an army of 500 000 bonus marchers to go and overthrow roosevelt
[02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:17.840]  and it was ridiculed widely for good reason first of all these men these smart men either
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:24.080]  knew believed or suspected that the bonus marchers was a communist organization
[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:32.960]  and at that time the communists did hate uh musilini secondly fdr you know he was probably
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:39.600]  plotting more against hitler but not a musilini in fact uh fdr's first program the nra
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:48.720]  the national recovery uh act uh was openly modeled off of fascist principles and 1934
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:56.640]  musilini was an enemy of hitler when the first time the nazis attempted to the austrian nazis
[02:35:56.640 --> 02:36:04.000]  attempted to overthrow that government there he sent the uh his army to the border in support of
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.720]  the existing austrian government is i agree with you i think there's a lot of there's a lot of
[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:13.760]  different ways that these things have been used and of course communism itself was set up by bankers
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:18.960]  they sent linen on a train uh to start his revolution they put him on a train from switzerland
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:25.520]  10 million dollars in gold sealed in there that he was sent on his way by the uh head of the german
[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:30.480]  central bank and of course uh that guy's brother was working to establish the federal reserve at
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:36.000]  the same time in the united states so you know we shouldn't be captured by these different ideologies
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:40.640]  and i'm not a communist either i was very sympathetic to the bonus marchers i still
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:44.320]  feel that when the government tells veterans that they're going to give them something
[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:48.160]  they need to make good on those promises and i think they had a legitimate beef
[02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:51.840]  smeadly butler was speaking to that i've seen the clips of him speaking to them
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:56.640]  i think it was absolutely an outrage that they would betray these people i think smeadly butler
[02:36:56.640 --> 02:37:02.720]  realized that he'd been betrayed multiple times i don't know what he felt about uh economics i think
[02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:09.440]  a lot of people will look at the abuses of large corporations and banks and take that to an incorrect
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:14.960]  extreme and say the problem is capitalism no the problem isn't capitalism it's not free markets the
[02:37:14.960 --> 02:37:21.360]  problem is uh corporatism the problem is governments that are captured by corporations and used by
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:27.760]  corporations and so i think a lot of people misdiagnosed the solution to it but uh they just uh
[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:32.000]  that's that's possibly what happened there appreciate that peter washington let's go to
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:40.960]  karen in texas karen go ahead um hi david um this is about vaccines um i just wanted to
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:48.400]  make people aware of that there's a bill in congress it's house resolution 117
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:57.760]  it was introduced last week by um representative adam shift in california and it's now in committee
[02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:05.680]  but it's the title of it is recognizing the importance of vaccinations and immunizations
[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:10.560]  in the united states what a surprise that would come from somebody in california that where they
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:16.080]  don't respect individual freedom in any way shape or form i'm sorry go ahead uh that's hr 117 that's
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:23.840]  been introduced yes last week a week ago and a couple things in there that um people can go
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:31.120]  go read it themselves on the internet but it to affirm that vaccinate vaccine save lives and are
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:38.240]  essential to public health economic and national security yeah economic security of pharmaceuticals
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:45.040]  yeah i'm sorry go ahead yeah it's it's funny well you know the danger of that the danger of that
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:50.160]  karen is that they're going to put this in and say well you know we we agree that vaccines are safe
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:55.920]  effective necessary for economic and national security uh when they put that in then they're
[02:38:55.920 --> 02:39:01.600]  going to refer to that and say therefore we have to mandate these things without your informed
[02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:06.640]  consent that's a very dangerous aspect of that uh thank you for pointing that out to us that's uh
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:13.440]  hr 117 was there anything else you wanted to say about that i wanted people to hear and it
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:19.200]  recognizes the lack of vaccinations and cause of public health crisis and that there is no
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:25.600]  credible evidence to show that vaccines cause life threatening or disabling diseases in healthy
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:33.280]  children or adults now my daughter has been disabled by a vaccine i'm sorry i know from
[02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:38.960]  personal experience that is not true yes yes and we know from their own studies that it's not true
[02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:44.560]  we know that uh we can just look at the uh the bogus vaccine court and the billions of dollars
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:49.760]  that they paid out there uh to protect in that kangaroo court process to protect the pharmaceutical
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:55.360]  companies that is a very dangerous bill thank you for pointing that out to us karen as hr 117
[02:39:55.360 --> 02:40:01.120]  that's in the uh the u.s congress it's been introduced by some uh communists from california
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:05.600]  some authoritarian from california who wants to ram this down people's throats it's a very
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:11.040]  important thing to stop that the idea that vaccines are necessary that there's nothing
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:15.600]  harmful about them and that we have to force this they're laying the groundwork right there
[02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:21.520]  for a mandatory vaccination it's a full out campaign this is as much of a campaign as any gun
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:27.120]  control uh campaign that they ever did this is setting the stage for a medical tyranny we need
[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:33.280]  to understand that and we need also go to the website that we were given by dr sherry 10 10
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:38.400]  penny and i don't have that uh that website here anymore but it'll be up on the video as we posted
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:43.120]  on youtube uh that will let you know what's being done at your state level i think you'll
[02:40:43.120 --> 02:40:47.440]  have much more effect at shutting it down at the state level we need to start understanding
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:51.920]  that we can shut down these kind of federal tyrannies at the state level thank you karen
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:59.920]  let's move on to uh terrence in canada terrence go ahead hey david hi hey uh no um i wanted to
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:08.560]  make a point since uh the caller was talking about uh history um rt america posted in an article
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:17.440]  um of how the new uh the german public government put out uh new uh revised editions of the
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:27.280]  mind conch hitler's um hitler's book right and um no it's sad that uh how germany has become a
[02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:34.080]  complete uh as that country has been completely controlled it's like it's completely destroyed
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:40.720]  from what it what it was because i remember back when when hitler came into power that germany was
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:50.880]  completely bankrupt and he eventually um devised a national credit program and what did they change
[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:55.360]  about what they change about mind confuses they put out a revised a historical version of that
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:42:01.520]  what did they change about it pardon me what did they you said they changed uh mind conf they put
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:07.680]  out a revised version of that what they changed they revised it that uh they i think they revised it
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:13.280]  and put a lot of anti uh anti hitler into it in this new mind conf that they i thought that's what i
[02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:20.480]  saw in rt america okay yeah i'm not familiar with that yeah yeah was there i'm sorry go ahead
[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:29.200]  yeah so um no because what uh what people don't understand is that um and i'm not pro or anything
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:34.000]  but he was better than the commies or the capitalists even though he worked he was put in place by the
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:40.320]  very same people he worked by the very same people but he hated the zionist jews that controlled the
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:45.920]  banks it because they uh because they had they they they were yeah i don't know that he was any
[02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:49.760]  better than the communists i think he they were both put in place by a lot of the same people the
[02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:55.600]  bankers but um yeah i don't know did you want to make a comment about vaccines um yes i did
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:43:01.920]  actually i had two points um no when when um your the doctor came on share i think her name is
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:07.360]  sherry i can't remember her name um tindy made a point about yeah she made a point about um
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:14.800]  the flu shots and that i don't think too many people know this um but they showed that um
[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:21.520]  vitamin d is way more effective than the flu shot and uh just natural home remedies that uh
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:27.120]  and i noticed that's not on any of the major media outlets that oh this is how you can avoid the
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:31.040]  flu because it's going to take out of their profits oh yeah i think it's going to take
[02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:36.560]  right and if people want to see how the government railroaded people into buying pharmaceutical products
[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:41.600]  intimidating them into giving their consent of course now they say they don't even need
[02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:46.160]  our consent they're just going to do it to us uh go back and look at that full 60 minutes report
[02:43:46.160 --> 02:43:51.600]  that they did before the pharmaceutical companies owned all the major media companies you can find
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:56.640]  that report about the swine flu vaccines in 1976 and of course rob dude did a great job putting that
[02:43:56.640 --> 02:44:02.560]  together with uh some other uh issues that have come up in a combination so you can see that report
[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:08.240]  on alex jones's channel thanks terrence uh and i gotta say you know the argument that hitler made
[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:14.080]  the trains run on time is kind of like uh so what i could care less and we need to adopt
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:22.640]  the attitude that my freedom my the respect for me as an individual is not up for sale for the sake
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:29.600]  of uh uh of effectiveness for national security purposes to save my life i don't care you know
[02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:34.880]  if you give up your freedom for the promise of security you're not going to get it you never
[02:44:34.880 --> 02:44:40.320]  have and people need to understand that whenever you see these authoritarian appeals and understand
[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:44.400]  that what we're talking about with vaccines is essentially removing informed consent that was
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:50.080]  the at the essence of what was going on in these uh death camps that they were experimenting on people
[02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:54.160]  for that's what they came up with in nernberg they said you know the fundamental problem
[02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:59.120]  that we need to guard against is allowing this notion in here that informed consent doesn't
[02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:05.440]  matter it is paramount it is paramount individual liberty is paramount you will never have prosperity
[02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:11.120]  you'll never have security if you don't have liberty first so don't talk to me about uh making
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:17.120]  things work on time don't talk to me about being safe i'm not interested talk to me about liberty
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:21.200]  talk to me about respect to me as an individual then i'll listen to the rest of what you've got to say
[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:25.840]  about vaccines or whatever but until we get to that point we don't have anything to talk about
[02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:31.200]  if you're going to cover up the studies that have been done uh with pharmaceutical companies
[02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:34.880]  and you're not going to release that information to people you're going to redact the companies
[02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:40.160]  that were involved in adverse effects if the FDA is going to do that don't talk to me about any
[02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:42.800]  of these other things that they're trying to mandate to me we're not even going to get to
[02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:50.800]  that point let's go to uh steve in florida steve yeah hey uh uh good afternoon hey uh first
[02:45:50.800 --> 02:45:55.200]  slide just wanted to put out there to help you out uh dr sherry ten penny referred to it's
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:46:02.480]  five a little five or low fissures website that's been announced the show before n v i c dot org
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:09.920]  thank you nvic i think it's in mvicadvocacy.org wasn't it where was that mvc downer i see
[02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:14.720]  dot org because i get their newsletters okay now and it's uh it's national vaccine information
[02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:19.360]  so there's a lot of good information on there she actually had has a fund that was brain damaged
[02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:24.400]  by vaccines that's why she got into this okay um and if they go to that site and get on that list
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:28.640]  and they'll get alerts and updates about what's happening in your particular state you'll find
[02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:32.880]  out what's going on so you can take action support the right bills oppose the wrong ones thank you
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:38.960]  so much steve go ahead yeah uh before i get to what i call about is the vaccines and a personal
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:42.320]  experience just want to say you were talking about corporations which does tie in with the
[02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:48.320]  vaccine people don't realize that and you know this we've been run by a corporation as a nation
[02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:55.840]  since the 1800s and that is dc yes the district of corruption or and i propose that we should really
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:47:02.960]  rename our capital capital switch it and this is tying with the banks fittingly cd which is
[02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:09.200]  corporations beified because these people think they're god they can just do whatever they want
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:14.960]  to support their god the god of this world satan who wants to destroy everything that god has
[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:19.840]  created that's what this all comes down to i agree i understand that you know we talk about the
[02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:23.920]  constitution because it's important that people understand the fraud that's being perpetrated
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:27.920]  on them these people swear allegiance to the constitution say that it gives them their authority
[02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:33.760]  they come in uh swearing allegiance to a king and they are the stewards but they are dishonest
[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:38.480]  evil stewards who then ignore everything that the constitution says i'm sorry go ahead with
[02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:46.800]  your comment on vaccines okay i've had a couple of run-ins with uh cps in texas and the second
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:52.560]  one we had a child that died back in 2003 those vultures showed up at our door pretty much the
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:57.520]  next day after and it was just a freak your currency got sick died from an autoimmune disease
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:03.280]  anyway a doctor at texas children has actually signed a consent form for them to do this while
[02:48:03.280 --> 02:48:09.840]  the head doctor was against it and what i wanted to say is this that was a situation where we had no
[02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:15.760]  say in them showing up we were cleared from their best so-called investigation but think about this
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:22.400]  we've had put in place the ndaa uh they're trying to get people guns we've got codex
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:27.600]  elementarius doing the wings to take away all the supplementation the good stuff that will
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:33.600]  help people now they're pushing the vaccines so you put all that together and we're going to have
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:40.320]  the nazi holocaust with the secret police and stalin and mal and all that times a thousand
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:46.320]  on steroids i mean this is a nightmare and so people really need to wake up and get involved
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:52.240]  opposing this and not go well you know i'll just trust the lord or it doesn't affect me out of sight
[02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:57.040]  out of mind i'll do a deal with when it comes to my door stuff it is going to and like alex said
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:01.680]  it's already coming in your home through the propaganda they put out to the media people
[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:06.640]  need to wake up and understand that when it gets the point where they are secretly taking you off
[02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:12.480]  putting you in one of their camps and then forcibly vaccinating you to sterilize and kill you it's
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:17.360]  going to be too late you need to wake up now absolutely i couldn't say that any better than
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:22.560]  you did it is christians have and everybody has a right to protect themselves to protect their
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:27.840]  family at this point in time when we see this explosion of technology when we see this concentration
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:33.920]  of power in the hands of a few that technology is giving them that should make everyone very
[02:49:33.920 --> 02:49:39.200]  afraid we need to work harder than ever to make sure that the fundamental principles of individual
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:44.080]  liberty things like informed consent are established even more firmly than they've ever been because
[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:49.120]  the potential for abuse the downside potential is so much more dangerous than it has ever been
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:54.880]  let's go to shane and montana shane hi david how are you today doing good go ahead

[02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:25.040]  moment and before we get to him i wanted to cover a couple of articles that i think are pretty amazing
[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:31.040]  of course it's about the 2016 election or i guess i should say the selection the candidates are being
[02:54:31.040 --> 02:54:35.440]  selected right now by the rich moneyed interests we've got an article up on info wars dot com jeb
[02:54:35.440 --> 02:54:42.320]  bush exposed part two he thinks the unconstitutional nsa spying is quote hugely important yes it is
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:46.560]  hugely important but not in the way that he thinks he thinks it's hugely important that we continue
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:52.400]  this unconstitutional illegal action and as the story that we've got out on info wars dot com from
[02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:57.440]  liberty blitzkrieg says i can't imagine a more odious absurd scenario than being forced to
[02:54:57.440 --> 02:55:03.360]  choose between another bush and another clinton and guess what when we look at hillary clinton
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:08.320]  there's articles that are up on the washington free beacon talking about how she is taking
[02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:13.920]  money from the united arab Emirates Saudi arabia oman australia germany a canadian government
[02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:19.120]  agency promoting the keystone pipeline they're all giving money to the bill and hillary clinton
[02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:25.520]  foundation they've always heard from those hl meakin that said an election is an advanced
[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:31.040]  auction of stolen goods well the auction is running right now and guess who is in front
[02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:36.000]  it's jeb bush and hillary clinton raking in the money and as we see another story jeb bush says
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:42.320]  he believes in the amnesty bill with all of his heart and soul meanwhile we see even chris ruddy
[02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:48.560]  the conservative who attacked the clintons was one of their nemesis in the uh early 90s uh going
[02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:54.560]  after the uh vince foster death he's now going to give them a million dollars for their foundation
[02:55:54.560 --> 02:56:00.880]  they have collected billions well here's alex jones wrapping up the show uh he's got a word from
[02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:05.920]  uh that he's recorded with us here's alex ladies and gentlemen we're about to conclude
