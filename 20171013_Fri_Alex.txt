[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:15.000 --> 00:21.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[00:21.000 --> 00:28.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28.000 --> 00:36.000]  With our help, President Trump is exercising the globalist demon out of our republic.
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.000]  And as you look at the news every day that emerges, you see the theme.
[00:41.000 --> 00:49.000]  Not the theme the globalists are pushing, but the theme that the citizens are realizing collectively together.
[00:49.000 --> 00:51.000]  Citizens of planet Earth.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  Just look at Drudge Report.
[00:53.000 --> 01:01.000]  Look at these headlines. Consumer sentiment hits 13-year high. Stocks set new records.
[01:01.000 --> 01:14.000]  And then right below it, McCain defort tax cuts that would bring more money into the treasury and help pay down the national debt.
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  You cut taxes, more money comes in, you just got to keep spending the same.
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.000]  And Trump's been cutting spending in many areas.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  But Congress has been thwarting him there as well.
[01:24.000 --> 01:31.000]  But he then used the nuclear option that Dr. Corsi's been hammering here for months to just defund it.
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.000]  Don't let him raid Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to fund Obamacare.
[01:35.000 --> 01:42.000]  And it's, you know what up, it's dead in the sun.
[01:42.000 --> 01:51.000]  Meanwhile, Bannon Revelation, quote, helps Dems burn Republican Party to the ground.
[01:51.000 --> 01:58.000]  The media is spinning it that, oh, look, the Dems like Bannon because he's going to help burn down the Republican Party.
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  No, he's helping make it the populist party. We're making it the populist party.
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.000]  It's an information war. We're removing the neocon rhino globalist traders.
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  So the Democrats are acting like, oh, yeah, look, the Republicans are weak.
[02:13.000 --> 02:22.000]  Look what Bannon says. Yes, let's helping. They spin everything to act like their party isn't burning down to the ground itself.
[02:22.000 --> 02:31.000]  The Republican Party is in a civil war and is trying to rejuvenate itself.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  And it's a beautiful thing. And Bannon is 100% on target.
[02:35.000 --> 02:42.000]  Remember he said a few days ago, probably has a 30% chance of completing full term because of the 25th Amendment.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  The Democrats and the Republican leadership are on the hill shopping the idea.
[02:47.000 --> 02:55.000]  You've got to admit they're doing it to supercharge the base so they're aware of what's going on so we stop it.
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.000]  It's not fatalistic. It's not negative. It's not abandoned ship news.
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  It's man the parapets. Pull up the drawbridge. Call out the guard.
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  Awaken the king.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  On this Friday the 13th global transmission.
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  So that's what we're talking about here. That's exactly what you do.
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.000]  The media always used to spin it. Jones is fearing about global government and all these unstoppable elites.
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  I wasn't saying they were unstoppable. I was saying they were weak because they were authoritarian and were operating by stealth.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  And as soon as you took the stealth away, they were wide open.
[03:33.000 --> 03:44.000]  And that's why all the king's horses and all the king's men and all the fake Hollywood people and all the M&M's and all the little media twerps that have been propped up.
[03:44.000 --> 03:53.000]  They may be able to get some 12 and 13 year old snot nose folks to actually watch them or a few old people that still think it's trendy.
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  Jadio Maki Nome. Wow, you saw that M&M. He really took Trump to the woodshed.
[03:59.000 --> 04:09.000]  Yeah, yeah. That's why the approval rating's up.
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  What they're doing is attempting to dynamite the reassurgence of America.
[04:13.000 --> 04:25.000]  There's been an economic operation to bankrupt this country and bring us into the world corporate government, just like a third world country's bankrupted and brought in to the IMF or World Bank's orbit.
[04:25.000 --> 04:33.000]  But the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray and they're going astray now.
[04:33.000 --> 04:43.000]  Also, Mark Dice has touched on something really important and that's the game-off of you in Hollywood and that's going to be the next big shoot-a-drop.
[04:43.000 --> 04:53.000]  And then when that basement falls in, you'll find the entire labyrinth of pedophile networks and then below that, Satan worshippers and human sacrifice cults.
[04:53.000 --> 04:59.000]  It's all about to come out. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[04:59.000 --> 05:05.000]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and Biotru Selenium.

[06:20.000 --> 06:25.000]  So what do we do? We give them what they want.
[06:25.000 --> 06:32.000]  We're number one, Ben. That's all that counts. Believe me, I've been in the business 30 years.
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.000]  Well, I haven't been in show business as long as you have, Killian, but I'm a quick learner.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  I'm going to give the audience what I think they want.
[06:41.000 --> 06:51.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.000]  You know what the American people want? They want dignity, they want freedom.
[06:55.000 --> 07:07.000]  They don't want to live in a rigged crony capitalist system with a bunch of psychopath jerks like Bezos, Zuckerberg, Al Gore, all these people.
[07:07.000 --> 07:14.000]  Breathing down our necks, exempting themselves from all the laws and rules and taxes,
[07:14.000 --> 07:23.000]  and then having the will and the nerve then try to ruin our families and dominate and destroy our civilization
[07:23.000 --> 07:30.000]  just so you can politically mount our head on the wall and feel culturally superior
[07:30.000 --> 07:36.000]  because you're such bloated, evil, demonic, twisted sacks of garbage.
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  We must escape from this matrix we're building.
[07:41.000 --> 07:47.000]  Make no mistake, we are building the matrix right now.
[07:47.000 --> 07:53.000]  It's 100% admitted by the social engineers, by the technocrats, it's their plan,
[07:53.000 --> 08:04.000]  and they've announced that humanity in general is obsolete, obsolescent.
[08:04.000 --> 08:09.000]  It's a total revolution against humanity.
[08:09.000 --> 08:16.000]  And you've got traditionalists in the power structure that now really realize how horrible this plan is,
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  and they're stepping back from the edge of the cliff.
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.000]  That's what Trump is, you don't think he's a cream puff, do you?
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  God that owns casinos and stuff? No.
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  They're just stepping back from the edge of the cliff and going,
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.000]  you know, this is really evil and stupid.
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  So when you get down to the final phases of this, we're going to find out
[08:39.000 --> 08:47.000]  who really wants to be a disgraceful sack of garbage like Harvey Weinstein or Jeffrey Dahmer
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  or any of these people, any of these psychopaths,
[08:50.000 --> 08:58.000]  and who really wants to build something and wants to really do something.
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  A bunch of sneaky backstabbing scum,
[09:02.000 --> 09:09.000]  building the most confusing, wicked, twisted, diseased, drugged out world they could possibly build
[09:09.000 --> 09:17.000]  because people like Harvey Weinstein are miserable.
[09:17.000 --> 09:26.000]  And make no mistake.
[09:26.000 --> 09:43.000]  The NFL, mainstream media, the whole Hollywood globalist garbage combine is in its total and complete death throes right now.
[09:43.000 --> 09:53.000]  And so the power it had as it dissipates, all of the skeletons are about to come out of the closet.
[09:53.000 --> 10:00.000]  And the globalists know this. That's why they're desperately wanting authoritarianism to shut down their competition
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  and to stave off reprisals, vendettas.
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  They're fighting for their very lives right now.
[10:12.000 --> 10:25.000]  And as I've said, when I've talked to people that have been billed to burg attendees and high-level Davos attendees and all the rest of it off record,
[10:25.000 --> 10:32.000]  I've told them turn against globalism now, turn against the Satan worship now, turn against the corruption now,
[10:32.000 --> 10:40.000]  burn down, help us burn down the New World Order and you might get your soul back.
[10:40.000 --> 10:56.000]  But fire is the answer to cleanse us of this disease, a lyrical fire in the minds of men.
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.000]  You know, I saw this video a few days ago, saw a news report on it.
[11:02.000 --> 11:14.000]  And then this morning I saw Mark Dice's report and I've got all this high-ran speech news coming up and I've got all this cover-up of Las Vegas as beyond imploded.
[11:14.000 --> 11:26.000]  But really one of the first things I wanted to get to today is a report up on newswars.com and infowars.com by Mark Dice.
[11:26.000 --> 11:36.000]  Dealing with Terry Cruz, he plays the president, one of my favorite movies in theocracy, admits Hollywood's dark secret.
[11:36.000 --> 11:44.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, it's that the going after the women is only secondary and only do humiliate them.
[11:44.000 --> 11:50.000]  It's really about men dominating other men and it's not even for the gay sex.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  It is an act of domination.
[11:52.000 --> 12:03.000]  And when he said that, I noticed he got all those headlines, I thought, you know, I've had Hollywood producers grab me by the genitals twice.
[12:03.000 --> 12:09.000]  And I've had them pat me on the butt many other times and that's why one reason I don't go out there.
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  And I'm not saying that to get a bunch of attention.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  It's the kind of guys don't admit.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  But for me, I was like, what the hell?
[12:15.000 --> 12:23.000]  And just slept it off and then they're like, I'm like, you know, hobble over to the corner, but you're walking into a meeting with a high level Hollywood producers.
[12:23.000 --> 12:31.000]  I mean, big ones, big ones and they're going to grab your genitals a lot of times.
[12:31.000 --> 12:44.000]  And it's just a total act of domination and it's always old fat men with a gray green skin with cigarettes and they're sitting around and they're talking about this and that.
[12:44.000 --> 12:51.000]  And then you're walking out to the parking lot or the house or wherever.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  And you say, hey, have a great day, be safe.
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.000]  That's Texas thing.
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  Are you threatening me?
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.000]  I believe you just threatened me.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  I mean, they're so paranoid, so whacked out.
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  But it's that act of domination.
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.000]  The two times, I guess it's just something they do.
[13:07.000 --> 13:14.000]  I mean, they really will grab you and really not how to hurt you, but squeeze you.
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  I guess just to see what you're going to do.
[13:18.000 --> 13:24.000]  And, you know, I'm the type of good natured person that if I'm sitting around people and around people, I mean, I'm like, hey, watch it.
[13:24.000 --> 13:25.000]  What the hell?
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.000]  Hey, what's your problem?
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  Because you know, as a guy, you want to act tough about it.
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.000]  But that's what goes on in Hollywood, folks.
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  You come up here like crying about it on television, saying, I'm a rape victim.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  Someone grabbed my genitals twice.
[13:39.000 --> 13:46.000]  Or, you know, it's stuff like, hey, you want to watch Brokeback Mountain?
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  Stuff like that.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  Now, people would think Charlie Sheen, who I've known for like 13 years, would be the guy doing that.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  None of those are Charlie Sheen stories.
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  That was just one guy who would come on the air and it was interesting.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  So he had him on.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  Of course, he went off the deep end into partying and the rest of it.
[14:03.000 --> 14:16.000]  It's a sad story, but almost every Hollywood event I went to, they would either say, well, you probably shouldn't be here because you're not into being a child molester, are you?
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  Or, hey, do you love Satan?
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  Because we worship the devil.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  We're going to pray to the devil at dinner tonight.
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.000]  The only place I never ran into that was like at Martin Sheen's house.
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  His wife was super smart and super nice and I guess they're like Catholics slash kind of Buddhists.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  I know they do yoga and stuff.
[14:34.000 --> 14:35.000]  It was none of that.
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  That's why you see him doing such dumb liberal stunts.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  And then you ask, how are they so awake?
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  They know about vaccines.
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  They got guns, folks.
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  You know, it's just crazy.
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  Now, there's the Daily Beast.
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  Hollywood goes full devil worship.
[14:49.000 --> 14:55.000]  I mean, they were some of the only people I ran into that were not devil worshipers.
[14:55.000 --> 15:00.000]  And by the way, did not like them.
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  I guess they've given Lucifer a star on the Hollywood Walk of Shame.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  I mean, it's just such a dead feeling when you're out there.
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  It's so evil.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  It's so corrupt.
[15:09.000 --> 15:16.000]  And, you know, here I've told the stories here, you know, and I was just thinking about it.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  I had suppressed it.
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]  I had repressed it.
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.000]  One other Hollywood producer, three of them grabbed my genitals.
[15:23.000 --> 15:29.000]  And, you know, if I said one of the people's names, folks would say, hey, that's a patriot.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  There's another thing too.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  When somebody, you think I was being a good person, one of the few people in Hollywood
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  and they grabbed you by the crotch, it's more of like a male dominance thing.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  But then imagine what it's like for women.
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.000]  And then who knows what's going on after that.
[15:44.000 --> 15:50.000]  But yeah, wow, I've really, I mean, it's just a mess, man.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  It is a mess.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  And it's all coming down.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  It's dying.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  It really is dying right now.
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  I'm trying to lean on the Communist Chinese, but it's not working.

[18:38.000 --> 18:47.000]  Harvestrite freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.000]  Harvestrite is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[20:01.000 --> 20:15.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:15.000 --> 20:21.000]  The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us, even now in this very room.
[20:21.000 --> 20:25.000]  You can see it when you look out your window, or when you turn on your television.
[20:25.000 --> 20:31.000]  You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your tax.
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind your future.
[20:36.000 --> 20:45.000]  That you are a slave, like everyone else you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.
[20:45.000 --> 20:51.000]  A prison for your mind.
[20:51.000 --> 20:59.000]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  We are back live.
[21:01.000 --> 21:07.000]  Show. I've been on a lot of TV shows and been in some movies.
[21:07.000 --> 21:14.000]  Reality television, you name it. Discovery Channel, History Channel, Truth TV, you name it.
[21:14.000 --> 21:20.000]  And I've been on the late night comedy shows years ago, some of the late night comedy shows.
[21:20.000 --> 21:30.000]  And because back then I was criticizing Bush a lot, and Hollywood was so one dimensional, they thought, oh, that must mean you're a liberal.
[21:30.000 --> 21:41.000]  Until they find out your real political views. It's just crazy.
[21:41.000 --> 21:47.000]  And then still they liked you because you're criticizing Bush. They don't get, you don't like Bush, and you don't like the Democrats either.
[21:47.000 --> 21:51.000]  They just, it's so one dimensional.
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.000]  But that was 20 years ago, 15 years ago, 10 years ago.
[21:55.000 --> 22:00.000]  I mean, I've barely gone out there in the last six, seven years ever.
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  I wanted to be on Joe Rogan's podcast, and I was in and out day and a half.
[22:05.000 --> 22:14.000]  Love Northern California, love central areas, love the coast, but just Los Angeles is, if Satan lives on the planet, that's where he lives.
[22:14.000 --> 22:21.000]  It's just an emptiness, a hellishness, the energy.
[22:21.000 --> 22:32.000]  And so people say, oh, you're so brave to talk about going into meetings with Hollywood producers, people that all want to put your film out or make a film with you.
[22:32.000 --> 22:37.000]  These are big, big names.
[22:37.000 --> 22:43.000]  Not as big as Weinstein, because he's just ubiquitous, that name, but grossing wise, as big.
[22:43.000 --> 22:49.000]  You know, the lawyers for some of the top people, the people that actually run it, the owners of the companies.
[22:49.000 --> 22:55.000]  Not the little actors and people running around under the mafia, all totally scared.
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  And then Hollywood checks out everything that's up and coming.
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.000]  It sees popularity before other people see it.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  It's real talent.
[23:05.000 --> 23:10.000]  So they basically steal ideas, and so they would have a lot of meetings with me.
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  And, you know, pat on the butt, okay, I played football.
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  But no, grab you by the genitals.
[23:18.000 --> 23:24.000]  And I never took it as if it was done in a homosexual way.
[23:24.000 --> 23:27.000]  It was done as domination.
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  And I'd be like, whoa, whoa, what the hell's going on?
[23:30.000 --> 23:34.000]  Just like you heard Weinstein, oh, baby, I'm sorry.
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.000]  Oh, come on.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  Oh, hey, hey, come on, whoa, whoa.
[23:37.000 --> 23:45.000]  And then later, completely scared of you if you just said, you know, knock you upside the head.
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  I mean, I would be in these meetings with these guys and not grovel and just say what I wanted.
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  And they would be completely scared of me by the end of the meeting.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  These people are weird, folks.
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  I'm telling you, Hollywood's weird.
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.000]  And I'm like, this is what it is.
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  The top of the pyramid is this.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  And they all smoke cigarettes.
[24:02.000 --> 24:05.000]  Old hairy men.
[24:05.000 --> 24:09.000]  And if you go to one of the parties, there's like this, you know, 85-year-old guy,
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.000]  total gangster with this 22-year-old vampire woman.
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.000]  That's Weinstein's wife.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  And it's just like, get me out of here, man.
[24:18.000 --> 24:26.000]  You'll be sitting there with a butler bringing you hors d'oeuvres and a cocktail
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  and there's ashes raining down on you at the pool.
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  And like the third time that happened in a two-year period where I was at different pools at people's houses
[24:34.000 --> 24:40.000]  and ashes was raining down because there's just fires all the time and it gets caught in the air and flies around.
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.000]  You said yourself, oh my gosh, something big is going on here.
[24:43.000 --> 24:49.000]  The whole house of cards is coming down and it's going to collapse from the harassing and raping women
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  into harassing and raping men, into children, into Satanism.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  And it's all there. They tell you what they think.
[24:55.000 --> 25:00.000]  So here is the report by Mark Dice breaking down TV star, movie star.
[25:00.000 --> 25:03.000]  I like to call him a fan.
[25:03.000 --> 25:06.000]  Terry Cruz admits Hollywood's dark secret.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  Here's Mark Dice.
[25:07.000 --> 25:12.000]  While the mainstream media is finally talking about the corrupt cast and couch culture of Hollywood,
[25:12.000 --> 25:18.000]  we're going to go deep into the heart of Hollywood in this video and talk about what you won't see or hear in the mainstream media.
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.000]  In fact, this Harvey Weinstein story was killed by The New York Times 13 years ago.
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  And when NBC's reporter Ronan Farrow wanted to do his expose, NBC refused to publish it.
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.000]  And so he went to The New Yorker, which then thankfully did, which is what started opening this big can of worms.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  And now the head of Amazon Studios, Roy Price, since they create original programming as well,
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  has been suspended for similar sexual harassment allegations.
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  As more women continue to come forward with stories of harassment and other abuse at the hands of Harvey Weinstein,
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.000]  this still is just the tip of the iceberg of what goes on behind the scenes in Hollywood.
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.000]  And even darker secret that's just beginning to be uncovered is the fact that gay Hollywood executives also harass
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  and also sexually assault male actors as well.
[26:04.000 --> 26:10.000]  As difficult as it is for women to come forward after they've been sexually harassed or assaulted by high-level Hollywood producers,
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  imagine how much more difficult it must be for men who face homosexual harassment.
[26:14.000 --> 26:21.000]  Terry Crews, who's been in a bunch of television shows and movies, has come forward to say that he was not only just sexually harassed by a high-level gay executive,
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  but sexually assaulted.
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.000]  This guy's like a 230-pound former NFL player, and he was afraid to come forward and say anything about it
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.000]  and tell the stories about Harvey Weinstein started circulating, and he finally decided to speak up.
[26:33.000 --> 26:40.000]  And now James Van Der Beek, star of the teen drama Dawson's Creek, has just come forward and said that he too was sexually assaulted,
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  not just harassed, sexually assaulted by a gay Hollywood executive.
[26:44.000 --> 26:51.000]  Most likely there's dozens, if not more, actors who are household names who have also been victims of homosexual harassment and sexual assault,
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.000]  but most of them will never speak up because they don't want to be perceived as being homophobic or cross the Hollywood gay mafia.
[26:57.000 --> 27:04.000]  Here's Chris Rock at the Oscars last year, who was making fun of everybody after they won, and Tell Sam Smith won an Oscar for Best Movie Soundtrack
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.000]  and decided to announce to the audience that it was a victory for gay people.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  And then Chris Rock was afraid to crack any jokes because he didn't want to get in trouble.
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.000]  Congratulations on those jokes there.
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  Not gonna get me in trouble.
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  Oh, don't want to get in trouble. Can't make fun of gay people. They're above reproach.
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  In fact, after the CEO of Mozilla, that's the creator of Firefox, the popular internet browser, Brandon Ike,
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.000]  was exposed as not supporting gay marriage, he was forced out of the company that he created.
[27:34.000 --> 27:40.000]  Bill Maher was even shocked and came to the CEO's defense, but did say that he thinks that there is a quote, gay mafia,
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  and that he too was afraid to cross them.
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  Here's rapper Fat Joe on what he calls the gay mafia in the entertainment industry.
[27:46.000 --> 27:54.000]  I happen to think there's a gay mafia in the hip hop, not rappers. The editorial presidents of magazines,
[27:54.000 --> 28:04.000]  the PDs at radio stations, the people who give you award at award shows, this is a f***ing gay mafia, my man.
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  Like, you know what I'm saying? They are in power.
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.000]  Did you hear DJ Vlad off camera agreeing to everything that he was saying?
[28:11.000 --> 28:17.000]  Even Harvey Levin, the head of TMZ, who himself is gay, admits that there is a gay mafia in Hollywood.
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  He says that it's not a criminal organization, more or less a very powerful political organization,
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  but us normal people aren't supposed to talk about that.
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  We're also not supposed to talk about the fact that since President Obama repealed, don't ask, don't tell,
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  and allowed gays into the military that there is an epidemic of gay men raping other slaves.
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  Alright, let's stop right there. Absolutely. Just like with children, it's all about power.
[28:38.000 --> 28:43.000]  I'm not saying all homosexuals, okay? But I'm going to use the word homosexual because we're told to use the word gay.
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.000]  I'm sick of people telling me what words to use, okay?
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  You've got these same groups assaulting children now, telling them they're a different gender.
[28:50.000 --> 28:57.000]  As Camille Paglia said, it's child abuse. Admit it. We'll be right back. There is a satanic mafia.
[28:57.000 --> 29:02.000]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[29:02.000 --> 29:08.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[29:08.000 --> 29:13.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[29:13.000 --> 29:21.000]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[29:21.000 --> 29:27.000]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff you said. There's so many things that are in it.
[29:31.000 --> 29:36.000]  You have the name in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.000]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[29:42.000 --> 29:45.000]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.000]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.

[30:58.000 --> 31:03.000]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America,
[31:03.000 --> 31:05.000]  it will come in the name of liberalism.
[31:05.000 --> 31:08.000]  You're a white male! You're a white male!
[31:12.000 --> 31:17.000]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in Infowars Live Broadcasting.
[31:17.000 --> 31:23.000]  We are live weekdays from 3 to 6 PM central at infowars.com slash show,
[31:23.000 --> 31:26.000]  and this YouTube channel right here that you've landed on.
[31:26.000 --> 31:29.000]  Please subscribe to the channel for updates and notifications.
[31:29.000 --> 31:33.000]  You can follow us on Twitter at War Room Show.
[31:33.000 --> 31:36.000]  We are going to have the most powerful guests, the most powerful hosts.
[31:36.000 --> 31:41.000]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones regularly as well as taking your phone calls.
[31:41.000 --> 31:45.000]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[31:45.000 --> 31:48.000]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[31:48.000 --> 32:16.000]  This is The War Room.
[32:18.000 --> 32:21.000]  Alex Jones has now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[32:21.000 --> 32:26.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children.
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.000]  It's the best job you can to purify your air.
[32:28.000 --> 32:33.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[32:36.000 --> 32:38.000]  The general public doesn't.
[32:38.000 --> 32:42.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[32:46.000 --> 32:51.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters
[32:51.000 --> 32:53.000]  that didn't do as good a job.
[32:53.000 --> 32:56.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today.
[32:56.000 --> 33:19.000]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting Worldwide.
[33:26.000 --> 33:31.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:31.000 --> 33:37.000]  Georgina Chapman, the vampire-like beard for Weinstein.
[33:37.000 --> 33:42.000]  When I say beard, I mean just for his out of control activities with women.
[33:42.000 --> 33:47.000]  His wife for show, his wife for breeding.
[33:47.000 --> 33:52.000]  She knew he was pressuring and threatening people's careers that didn't buy her clothes, didn't wear her clothes.
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.000]  She knew she was wearing a gangster thug.
[33:57.000 --> 34:02.000]  Oh, but now, you know, she's so upset when this was a joke all over Hollywood, everybody knew.
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.000]  Well, now the reporting that she's leaning on
[34:06.000 --> 34:13.000]  Uma Abedin for help to understand what it's like to be married to a predator.
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  Uma Abedin knows full well what she's involved in as a horrible person.
[34:17.000 --> 34:24.000]  And other writes the top Islamic papers on cutting women's genitals off.
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  And I've seen late night comedians make jokes about it before.
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  How do you cut a woman's genitals off, Alex?
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  Oh, they know.
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  And I'm not going to get into it graphically.
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.000]  You sickos.
[34:35.000 --> 34:38.000]  Truly disgusting vampire people.
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  But they were showing me in the control room.
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  We're going to tweak this out on real Alex Jones.
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.000]  The week magazine news publication, leftist publication,
[34:47.000 --> 34:53.000]  has an image of Weinstein in a white, creepy bathrobe.
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.000]  It's an editorial cartoon and behind him is Bill O'Reilly and Donald Trump.
[34:58.000 --> 35:04.000]  And it says, she know evil while powerful men get away with sexual abuse.
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  Oh, yeah.
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's people like Weinstein
[35:13.000 --> 35:18.000]  that dwarf anything O'Reilly ever even thought about with his weird pervert talk
[35:18.000 --> 35:23.000]  of the transcripts from the trials and the bizarre stuff that he would say to women.
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  It was super creepy, bad.
[35:24.000 --> 35:25.000]  He paid millions of dollars out.
[35:25.000 --> 35:26.000]  Okay.
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  The guy's a thug.
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  The guy's a leftist opposing as a conservative.
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  But you look at Trump, he's delivered.
[35:33.000 --> 35:40.000]  And I happen to know women that when he's been in between marriages have dated Trump.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  And I happen to know the whole backstory folks,
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  not just from Roger Stone and people from a lot of other folks
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  and a lot of it's actually been even in the New York Times,
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  back before he was such a political figure,
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.000]  that Trump courts women and takes them out many times
[35:56.000 --> 36:02.000]  and he just won't jump in bed with anybody and he's a clean freak.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  That's what no one knows.
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.000]  That Trump is a clean freak when it comes to relationships, everything.
[36:09.000 --> 36:15.000]  And he is a one woman man when he's with that woman, gifts, money,
[36:15.000 --> 36:20.000]  everything super nice to him until the minute they're not.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  And then he's gone.
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  That's Donald Trump.
[36:26.000 --> 36:31.000]  And he's in that bus and the guy's talking about women.
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  He goes, yeah, it's incredible when you're a TV star.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  Now the women just throw themselves at you.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  And he's like an old schooler.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  He's like, yeah, you just grab them however you want.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  Well, yeah, a woman's climbing up on you.
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  You know, the sign is they jump on you.
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.000]  And then it's a mammal mating ritual in in primates,
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  but especially in homo sapien sapien that you then caress their buttocks,
[36:52.000 --> 36:57.000]  their hips up the stomach to the chest kissing.
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  This isn't mating ritual, you know, certain types of birds,
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  hop certain ways, do certain dances,
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.000]  and whipper wills have their songs and creatures mate.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  Different whale species have their stuff.
[37:07.000 --> 37:08.000]  It's not bad.
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  So when a woman jumps on you or your Elvis Presley
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  and they're throwing their panties at you,
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.000]  what do you think that means?
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  It means we want to mate with you.
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.000]  That's not bad.
[37:18.000 --> 37:19.000]  That's wholesome.
[37:19.000 --> 37:20.000]  That's good.
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  Is it a little uncouth for him to have locker room talk?
[37:23.000 --> 37:26.000]  Yeah, 12 years ago.
[37:26.000 --> 37:31.000]  But you know, most men are hypocrites.
[37:31.000 --> 37:38.000]  If you haven't been in a locker room or lifting weights or something
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  and made comments about your girlfriend or your wife and not bad ones.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  I mean, I made the comment about my wife.
[37:44.000 --> 37:45.000]  She's not street legal.
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  And by that, it's like a 10,000 horsepower car.
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  You're not supposed to put that on the street.
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  Sean, if you want to race, get on a race track.
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  That's got too much horsepower.
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.000]  What are you doing with that out here on the street?
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  Now, that's a compliment to my wife.
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  And it's a little racy pun intended, but she's alive.
[38:06.000 --> 38:11.000]  They're trying to make normal behavior bad and then make it all about men hitting on women
[38:11.000 --> 38:14.000]  and then tie that to men raping women and act like the two of the same
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  and then cover up all the pedophilia and the devil worship
[38:17.000 --> 38:24.000]  and the sexualization of children and all the real stuff that's going on everywhere.
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  It really is incredible.
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  We're waiting for the president in the next 20 minutes or so.
[38:31.000 --> 38:38.000]  He says in the next five, but he's usually about 10, 15 minutes late.
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  We'll see what happens.
[38:40.000 --> 38:45.000]  But we're going to shift gears in a bunch of other subjects today.
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.000]  It's just you can see how if you look at the week magazine,
[38:50.000 --> 38:56.000]  it should have Wiener and Bill Clinton behind Weinstein.
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  And they knew all this was coming out and they knew they couldn't cover it up
[38:59.000 --> 39:04.000]  and they knew there was rape information that was going to come out.
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.000]  And so what did they do?
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.000]  They brought this Weinstein situation out as a controlled demolition.
[39:13.000 --> 39:18.000]  It's like you use TNT to blow up an oil field fire that's ignited.
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.000]  You use the big blast to put out the rest of it and just make it a news cycle
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.000]  and get people conditioned and sick of hearing about it.
[39:26.000 --> 39:32.000]  When the whole pedophile dam is breaking and the sexual assault dam is breaking
[39:32.000 --> 39:37.000]  and the devil worship and the blood drinking and the eyes wide shut stuff,
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  that's what's really going on.
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.000]  You don't think Weinstein just stops with forcing women into bathrooms
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  and watching him bathe.
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.000]  He does it because he's hideous.
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  He does it because he wants to dominate their innocence.
[39:52.000 --> 39:57.000]  That's why you learn now, oh, it's 17-year-old girls
[39:57.000 --> 40:01.000]  and 16-year-old girls that he's been bringing in over the decades.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  Absolutely.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  You look at the women he likes, they look like little girls.
[40:07.000 --> 40:14.000]  What do you think is going on with this guy?
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.000]  Isn't Tarantino stunned and heartbroken, still processing?
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  What a big fancy word.
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  He's still processing Weinstein's mess.
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.000]  I mean, he had made a good film since Pulp Fiction
[40:30.000 --> 40:42.000]  and that itself is super disturbing with men raping men.
[40:42.000 --> 40:50.000]  Total race baiting, a white racist guy raping a black man.
[40:50.000 --> 40:57.000]  Another man chained up living in a box bringing out the gimp.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  The gimp's sleeping.
[40:59.000 --> 41:05.000]  Well, you'll just have to wake him up now, won't you?
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  All right, Vegas has completely collapsed
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  and I just can't believe it's not even bigger news.
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  Okay, everything's fake now
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  and the security guard was supposed to go on Hannity last night.
[41:14.000 --> 41:15.000]  He just disappeared.
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  Maybe he sleeps with the fishes.
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  What's that?
[41:19.000 --> 41:24.000]  It's a Sicilian message.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  We're going to come back and get into all the world news.
[41:26.000 --> 41:27.000]  This is very, very serious.
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  The economic news.
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.000]  The leftists are panicking.
[41:29.000 --> 41:30.000]  They're pulling their hair out.
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  They don't know what to do.
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  But there's that article, Gay Rape in Military,
[41:36.000 --> 41:41.000]  unreported by Pentagon, up 15-fold since they told folks
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.000]  to come out of the closet.
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.000]  And now they don't have to worry about anybody else trying to stop them
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  and they know other men aren't going to say anything
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  because, you know, that'd be embarrassing if five guys held you down
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  and raped you.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  That's okay because it's gay.
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  See, men getting raped all right.
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  Our men can take it.
[42:09.000 --> 42:10.000]  They're tough.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  They won't say anything about it.
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  And believe me, folks, if the scumbags in Hollywood
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.000]  three times grabbed me by the genitals in meetings,
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  just walk up, boom.
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.000]  I mean, it must be like a handshake or something.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  And you watch the leftist gay mafia and the rest of them.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  We're going to make big jokes out of this to see.
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  Sexual assault, Alex Jones, that's funny.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  But I don't even think of it as assault.
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.000]  It was like a weird handshake ritual of dominance to see what I do.
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.000]  Yeah, there you go.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  There's Pulp Fiction right there.
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  The fantasy with bondage, torture, raping men.
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  Hollywood's letting you know what they're into, folks.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  They're not into puppy dogs and kittens unless they're electrocuting them.
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2

[47:28.000 --> 47:32.000]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.000]  Said a joke up to the theme.
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  There's too much confusion.
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  There's too much confusion.
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  I can't get no relief.
[47:41.000 --> 47:45.000]  I can't get no relief.
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.000]  Business man there to drink my wine.
[47:49.000 --> 47:52.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are Back Live Broadcasting Worldwide.
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones and we are going to be going to the President's live briefing
[47:58.000 --> 48:05.000]  on a crackdown on Iran as he promised he'd do during the campaign.
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  He just keeps doing what he said he'd do.
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  Some of it I don't even completely agree with,
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  but I do agree with him doing what he says he'll do.
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  And the world respects that.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  You notice that we see the best new jobs numbers since 1984.
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.000]  We have the best economic outlook in 13 years.
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.000]  We have the biggest stock market ever.
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  And so many people say, I'm not in the stock market. I don't care.
[48:34.000 --> 48:37.000]  That shows mega massive ignorance.
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.000]  Yeah, it's a bubble. Yeah, a lot of us overvalued.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  The globalists have been using it to get power.
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.000]  Now Trump's taken it away to a certain extent,
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  using it to actually get America supercharged.
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  And now they want to pop the bubble.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  Now they want to see it go down.
[48:53.000 --> 48:59.000]  So I am a contrarian.
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  And then Politifact says true.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  Well, Politifact's actually trying to be honest these days.
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.000]  They've turned into such jokes.
[49:05.000 --> 49:10.000]  Is it true that the U.S. has the best job report in 16 years?
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.000]  Politifact says true.
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  Now I have to check it because Politifact also said
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  all 16 agencies said Russia stole the election.
[49:19.000 --> 49:20.000]  None of it was true.
[49:20.000 --> 49:23.000]  And they also said that, you know, I made up the fact
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  that there were reports of two shooters in Vegas.
[49:25.000 --> 49:28.000]  And I mean, just a lot of what Politifact says is bull,
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  but they've been so embarrassed by all this.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  Now they have to admit the truth.
[49:32.000 --> 49:38.000]  And that's the good news here is that people are understanding
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  that the globalists use the American economy to leverage out
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  across the world and consolidate power and control.
[49:46.000 --> 49:53.000]  And now they're done with America and want to create austerity
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  and make us poor so that they can control our lives.
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  And I know I harp on that.
[49:59.000 --> 50:04.000]  But the reason I harp on that is because that's their unfair system.
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.000]  That's the great oppression.
[50:08.000 --> 50:16.000]  That's the true discrimination.
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  Now if you just go to DrudgeReport.com,
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  that's where you guys can show the latest job numbers.
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  It's also on NewsWars.com.
[50:22.000 --> 50:23.000]  There it is right there.
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  Consumer sentiment hits 13-year high.
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  Stocks set new records.
[50:31.000 --> 50:38.000]  And what's the response of John McCain?
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  Down below he says he wants to keep taxes where they are,
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  maybe raise them because that way it will stop the economy growing.
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.000]  I mean, these people are villains.
[50:47.000 --> 50:51.000]  All they need is the pencil mustaches curled like Dick Dastardly
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  or whatever his name is.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  Remember those shows where they're flying the airplanes around
[50:55.000 --> 50:56.000]  with Mutley?
[50:56.000 --> 50:59.000]  Mutley's laughing and then the bad guy's always crashing.
[50:59.000 --> 51:02.000]  These people would go out of their way a million miles
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.000]  to screw somebody over because they hate themselves
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.000]  and they're projecting their hatred of themselves
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.000]  on everybody else.
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  That's what's happening.
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  And of course, there's one thing psychologists get right.
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  You know, Trump likes himself.
[51:14.000 --> 51:15.000]  He's confident.
[51:15.000 --> 51:16.000]  He's not a narcissist.
[51:16.000 --> 51:17.000]  He's competent.
[51:17.000 --> 51:18.000]  He wants to be a winner.
[51:18.000 --> 51:19.000]  He wants to tell people to be winners.
[51:19.000 --> 51:27.000]  But he also believes people can make their own decisions in life.
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  And so they want to destroy him.
[51:29.000 --> 51:35.000]  So they want to destroy us just like Project Veritas was on yesterday
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.000]  with their latest video inside the New York Times and Google.
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  And they've got one of their top people that liaisons
[51:42.000 --> 51:47.000]  for the New York Times and YouTube saying we force people to watch our videos.
[51:47.000 --> 51:52.000]  And our main mission is to block Alex Jones.
[51:52.000 --> 51:55.000]  And you get into internal Democrat Party strategy meetings.
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  We must stop Alex Jones.
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  We must stop Alex Jones.
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  Now, do you think that puts me on a power trip?
[52:02.000 --> 52:05.000]  No, it freaks me out because if I'm the best we've got
[52:05.000 --> 52:10.000]  and Trump's the best we've got, Trump has his problems and so do I.
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.000]  But here's the difference.
[52:11.000 --> 52:14.000]  We're not afraid of these people and they're not breaking our will
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  and we're not out to get you.
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.000]  And we understand their scum and we understand their authoritarian.
[52:19.000 --> 52:23.000]  We understand their illegitimate and we're not backing down.
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.000]  I don't want red carpets or helicopter landing pads.
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.000]  I don't want everybody kissing my butt.
[52:29.000 --> 52:32.000]  I want people around me that are real.
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  But I want my freedom.
[52:33.000 --> 52:34.000]  That's what I want.
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.000]  I want to run my own life.
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  That's the goal that I'm looking for.
[52:37.000 --> 52:38.000]  I want my children to be free.
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  I want to be an honorable people.
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  I want to be strong and I want to have a future.
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  These globalists think they're going to be God,
[52:45.000 --> 52:48.000]  merge with machines and humanity's bad.
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.000]  Again, they're projecting onto us the fact that they're so fallen.
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  They're so failed.
[52:53.000 --> 52:58.000]  And humanity is coming out of a deep hibernation.
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  Again, is the president speaking yet?
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  Usually speaks about 10 minutes late.
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.000]  As soon as he does, we'll go to it on this Iran situation.
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  Just briefly, if you want to support the broadcast,
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  I mean, it really is an act of resistance.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  If you're not supporting the broadcast, I'm not complaining.
[53:15.000 --> 53:20.000]  You've made your choice because if you're not actively sharing the videos
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.000]  and articles, and if you're not actively getting great supplements
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  and great new tropics and great products and great t-shirts,
[53:27.000 --> 53:30.000]  Molan Labe, and got a whole bunch of new designs,
[53:30.000 --> 53:35.000]  we've got your choice, a line made in America that costs $5 to $10 more.
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  And we have the lines made in El Salvador and Mexico and places
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  that on average are better than getting them in China or whatever.
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  But the point is, it's your choice at infowarstore.com.
[53:44.000 --> 53:48.000]  And we have 50% off on our number one best-selling product,
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  BrainForce that was sold out for months.
[53:50.000 --> 53:53.000]  I doubled the order and got a gargantuan order in
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  that I thought I could do 50% off for like a month.
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  But instead, it looks like it could sell out the next week and a half.
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  So if you want to get BrainForce 50% off,
[54:02.000 --> 54:05.000]  we've never done that before, infowarstore.com.
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  Here is the president. Let's go to the president now.
[54:11.000 --> 54:15.000]  My fellow Americans, as president of the United States,
[54:15.000 --> 54:23.000]  my highest obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people.
[54:23.000 --> 54:27.000]  History has shown that the longer we ignore a threat,
[54:27.000 --> 54:31.000]  the more dangerous that threat becomes.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  For this reason, upon taking office,
[54:34.000 --> 54:40.000]  I've ordered a complete strategic review of our policy
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.000]  toward the rogue regime in Iran.
[54:44.000 --> 54:48.000]  That review is now complete.
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  Today I am announcing our strategy,
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.000]  along with several major steps we are taking
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.000]  to confront the arraigning regime's hostile actions
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.000]  and to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never,
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  acquires a nuclear weapon.
[55:08.000 --> 55:13.000]  Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  of the Iranian dictatorship,
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  its sponsorship of terrorism,
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  and its continuing aggression in the Middle East
[55:22.000 --> 55:25.000]  and all around the world.
[55:25.000 --> 55:31.000]  Iran is under the control of a fanatical regime
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.000]  that seized power in 1979
[55:34.000 --> 55:41.000]  and forced a proud people to submit to its extremist rule.
[55:41.000 --> 55:45.000]  This radical regime has raided the wealth
[55:45.000 --> 55:50.000]  of one of the world's oldest and most vibrant nations
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.000]  and spread death, destruction, and chaos all around the globe.
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  Beginning in 1979,
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  agents of the Iranian regime
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  illegally seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
[56:06.000 --> 56:12.000]  and held more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  of the crisis.
[56:15.000 --> 56:19.000]  The Iranian back terrorist group Hezbollah
[56:19.000 --> 56:22.000]  twice bombed our embassy in Lebanon
[56:22.000 --> 56:29.000]  once in 1983 and again in 1984.
[56:29.000 --> 56:35.000]  Another Iranian-supported bombing killed 241 Americans,
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  service members they were,
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.000]  in their barracks in Beirut in 1983.
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.000]  In 1996, the regime directed another bombing
[56:47.000 --> 56:50.000]  of American military housing in Saudi Arabia,
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.000]  Iranian proxies provided training
[56:58.000 --> 57:01.000]  to operatives who were later involved
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  in al-Qaeda's bombing of the American embassies
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  in Kenya, Tanzania,
[57:08.000 --> 57:12.000]  and two years later killing 224 people.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  Well, this sounds like the buildup to war.
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  I don't like this. I don't like what Iran does either,
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  but I tell you, this is serious.
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  This is live. We can pause it, come back in a minute,
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  and get the rest of it for you.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  We've got some guys coming up today as well.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  But the president is doing what he said he would do,
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  stand up to Iran.
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  Iran has been very belligerent shooting our boats,
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  grabbing our people.
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  But he's listing all this stuff that Iran did to us.
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  We funded Iraq to kill over a million of them,
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.000]  and Operation Praying Manus, blowing up their navy.
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  I mean, it's not like we hadn't been punching them in the nose.
[57:44.000 --> 58:10.000]  We'll be right back.
[58:10.000 --> 58:15.000]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures

[59:45.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  That's infowarstore.com.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  This shows your host.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  We're going the distance, thanks to you.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  Y'all there, little doggy.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  Now, let's put Operation Prankman, it's on screen,
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  and I'm not defending the moolas.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  It is religious dictatorship, everybody knows that.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  My issue is that Iran polls show 70 plus percent
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  of the population doesn't want to be on the moolas or more.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  So the Iranian people are not our enemy.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  And I don't want to be enemies with the Muslims either.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  The point is that Iran is the second player to Saudi Arabia.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  Saudi Arabia is the big problem,
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  and it's got its own subdivisions.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  And I know Israel doesn't like Iran
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  because they think Iran's just crazy enough,
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  and believe me, they are, to actually use weapons.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  They're way more capable than most of the Arab regimes,
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  their Persians.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  And the U.S. funded a seven-year Iran-Iraq war
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  that killed over a million-and-a-half Iranians.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  So they don't like us.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  At least their brainwashed military doesn't.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  And they've got nuclear weapons, and Trump knows it.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  They've just never tested it because they know Israel
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  will strike them the minute they do.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  They've got it about 10 years ago from the highest sources.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  They've got satellite technology,
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  and they've got aircraft snoops that can see radioactive material.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  I'm going to leave it at that. It's very classified information.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  But it's a lot more fancier than what you drive in
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  to the Texas border from Mexico.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  You see these big spectrometer deals with these big, you know,
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  antennas that look like a laser gun from the 50s,
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  like a big laser cannon from Star Wars or something.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  Those are looking for radioactive stuff.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  They've got things much more powerful,
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  not just stuff at border patrol checkpoints that's sick to your old technology.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  They know what Iran's got.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  Pakistan gave them hydrogen bombs.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  That's why I told you a decade ago Saudi Arabia has them.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  The big issue is Iran keeps,
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  now that we're closing in to feeding the ISIS folks
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  that are Saudi Arabian-based,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Iran is now not going to really play a ball in Syria
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  with a new election like Assad promises.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  It's now Trump bringing pressure on them to make them do their deal.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  And they have agreed to this.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  That, again, is highly secret.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  We first told you five years ago, but that's our job here.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  But let's go ahead and go back to the president. Here it is.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  A sudden sun.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  In Iraq and Afghanistan,
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military personnel.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  The Iranian dictatorship's aggression
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  continues to this day.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  The regime remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  and provides assistance to al-Qaeda,
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  the Taliban, Hezbollah,
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  mass, and other terrorist networks.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  It develops, deploys,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  and proliferates missiles that threaten American troops and our allies.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  It harasses American ships and threatens freedom of navigation
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  in the Arabian Gulf and in the Red Sea.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  It imprisons Americans on false charges.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  And it launches cyber attacks against our critical infrastructure,
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  financial system, and military.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  The United States is far from the only target
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  The regime violently suppresses its own citizens.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  It shot unarmed student protesters in the street during the Green Revolution.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  This regime has fueled sectarian violence in Iraq
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  and vicious civil wars in Iran.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  We're going to come back with more of this live conference,
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  but it's still going on, but we pause as we go here.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  We have the live link up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  We'd like to watch it without the interruptions here.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  But it's important to listen to your local stations and support those sponsors.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  They're trying to shut down talk radio.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  They're trying to shut down freedom on the Internet.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  It's important to support the local stations.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  I know you know that.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  I just want to remind you on your busy day to support the info war
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  because you're the only support we've got.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  Exposing yourself and your family to toxic ingredients.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  Visit infowarsstore.com and learn more about the new SPF 30 sunscreen lotion.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  What a musician.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  All right, let's go back to the president giving his live press conference on Iran.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  Iran condoned Assad's use of chemical weapons against helpless civilians,
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  including many, many children.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  Given the regime's murderous past and present,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  we should not take lightly its sinister vision for the future.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  The regime's two favorite chants are death to America and death to Israel,
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  causing the gravity of the situation the United States
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  and the United Nations Security Council sought over many years
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  to stop Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  But the previous administration lifted these sanctions
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  just before what would have been the total collapse of the Iranian regime
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  This deal is known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  As I have said many times, the Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  the United States has ever entered into.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for years of terrible trade deals
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  that have sacrificed so many millions of jobs in our country to the benefit of other countries.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  We need negotiators who will much more strongly represent America's interests.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  The nuclear deal threw Iran's dictatorship a political and economic lifeline,
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  providing urgently needed relief from the intense domestic pressure the sanctions had created.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  It also gave the regime an immediate financial boost
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  and over $100 billion its government could use to fund terrorism.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  A large portion of which was physically loaded onto an airplane and flown into Iran.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  Just imagine the sight of those huge piles of money being hauled off by the Iranians
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  waiting at the airport for the cash.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  I wonder where all that money went.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  First of all, the deal allows Iran to continue developing certain elements of its nuclear program.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  And importantly, in just a few years, as key restrictions disappear,
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  Iran can sprint towards a rapid nuclear weapons breakout.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a purely short-term
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  What is the purpose of a deal that at best only delays Iran's nuclear capability for a short period of time?
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  This, as President of the United States, is unacceptable.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  In other countries, they think in terms of 100-year intervals, not just a few years at a time.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  The saddest part of the deal for the United States is that all of the money was paid upfront,
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  which is unheard of rather than at the end of the deal when they have shown they've played by the rules.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  But what's done is done, and that's why we are where we are.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  The best system is a third at the start, a third in the middle, and a third at the end.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  You've committed multiple violations of the agreement.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  For example, on two separate occasions, they have exceeded the limit of 130 metric tons of heavy water.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  Until recently, the Iranian regime has also failed to meet our expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  The Iranian regime has also intimidated international inspectors into not using the full inspection authorities that the agreement calls for.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow inspectors onto military sites,
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  even though the international community suspects some of those sites were part of Iran's clandestine nuclear weapons program.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  There are also many people who believe that Iran is dealing with North Korea.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  I am going to instruct our intelligence agencies to do a thorough analysis and report back their findings beyond what they have already reviewed.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  By its own terms, the Iran deal was supposed to contribute to regional and international peace and security.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  And yet, while the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East and beyond.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  Importantly, Iran is not living up to the spirit of the deal.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  So today, in recognition of the increasing menace posed by Iran and after extensive consultations with our allies,
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  I am announcing a new strategy to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  First, we will work with our allies to counter the regime's destabilizing activity and support for terrorist proxies in the region.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  Second, we will place additional sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  Third, we will address the regime's proliferation of missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors' global trade and freedom of navigation.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  And finally, we will deny the regime all paths to a nuclear weapon.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  Today, I'm also announcing several major steps my administration has taken in pursuit of this strategy.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  Iran said, if Trump did this, they'd attack us two days ago.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  Our strategy begins with the long overdue step of imposing tough sanctions on Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  The Revolutionary Guard is the Iranian Supreme Leader's corrupt personal terror force and militia.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  It has hijacked large portions of Iran's economy and seized massive religious endowments to fund war and terror abroad.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons to attack civilians in the region,
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  and even plotting to bomb a popular restaurant right here in Washington, D.C.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  All right, let's hit pause there. We're going to come back with more of this.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  Look, I don't like Iran. I don't like their moulas. Their population is 75 or more percent.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  Look at the poll, some 80-some percent do not want to be there.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  We do not want to be under these moulas. It is a dictatorship of the moulas, and they decide who can run for office and then let you kind of have a sham election.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  People go, it's not a dictatorship. Yeah, it's an Islamic State dictatorship.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  Islamic State is a Wahhabist group copying their Shiite enemies. They want the Islamic State.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  But Iran created the Islamic Republic of Iran in 79 with their overthrow of the Shah.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  And for all his problems, he was industrializing the country, and women weren't wearing burqas, and it was a pretty nice place to visit.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  They did have his savak that were torturing people and things. It wasn't good.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  They're trying to keep the Islamists under control.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  And the whole thing started when the CIA and 53 overthrew Mohammed Mosaddegh that was pro-America, but didn't want to be their puppet.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  So again, the globalists started the whole thing and then helped topple the Shah.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  If you actually research it deeply, it's just such a mess.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  And then now this, and Iran is belligerent and out of control.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  So I backed the president on so many fronts, but man, I tell you, this is just, this is really dangerous.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  We'll be back. Stay with us.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  You owe it to yourself. You owe it to your family.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  And you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  Your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  With Z-Shield and Z-Sign crystals, this essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  With inadequate thyroid hormones, you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.

[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation like canning or dehydrating, you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  Harvestrite freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation. Harvestrite is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:20.000]  Hello, this is Hank Hill and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  Look, it is a fact that Iran's working with North Korea on nuclear weapons. It's a factor very belligerent and our funding terror attacks in different parts of the world.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  But what's really happening here with Trump is an agreement was basically tentatively made between our military five plus years ago and the Russians and the Iranians to not let al-Qaeda take control of Syria to shut that down.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  Our own military rebelled against Obama. We told you about it first, Colonel Shaffer and other guests and years later it all came out.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  I mean, where else is it going to come out but Infowars? Other people are just too big a coward, just like Vegas. We told you all that was fake and multiple shooters and people shoot inside the hotels and it's all come out.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  Got a whole stack of that I haven't even gotten to yet. But I'm decisive when something can be decisive and I agree the globalists have appeased Iran and the whole thing's a mess and then they're belligerent and threatening.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  But at the same time, are we going to get into a big regional war with Iran now? And they've got real terror cells that have been brought into this country in Europe. It's going to be spectacular.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  And listen, if folks want big wars and people like Iran want one, I'm not afraid of it. I'm not looking for it but I'm not really worried about it.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  It's a miracle we've been here this long. But I just look at, I know what Trump's doing. Where we've been maneuvered by the whole Hollywood globalist elite and the big mega bankers that just want to be Hollywood stars who took control of the global economy and then made themselves
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  Richard and God basically but then cut off the economy to make people poor so they could dictate the terms of their surrender so they could then cut Christians and people that are the strength of the nation.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  I mean this is just a bunch of really degenerate neurotic weird stuff where Hollywood and the globalists want to force us into a bathroom with them so they can bathe naked in front of us and come out in rapists.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  And that's basically what it is. They say, your kids belong to us, you belong to us, behave, follow this societal comportment or we're going to destroy your life because they knew our weakness.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  As decent Christian people we have a moral compass. We have a conscience. And so they remove the conscience of being good and hard working and taking care of your children and not lying. And they replaced it with, oh, you've got to teach five year olds that they might not be a boy or a girl
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  and you've got to let other third parties come and sexualize them. That's your new religion. And that's all they've done. They've taken all the uptight extremes of Christianity and cults using the Christian faith to control people.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  That's what most of these churches and movements are. And they've just flipped it around and boy, did we get down in the muck with it and follow it and get into all this self loathing and all this guilt and just buy into it all.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  And then those of us that have consciences become the slaves of people that don't and they sit there with their little whip. Yeah, mule, yeah, keeping us right in line.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  Not me. I love God because I know God's real and I've had spiritual experiences and I know God's plan. At least I've seen some of it and it's beautiful and I want to be part of it.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  But I don't find God in these churches. My spirit finds the devil.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  They told Christ, why are you hanging around with these prostitutes and tax collectors, the most hated people at that time. And he said, because they don't claim they're good.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  They don't claim they've already got it all figured out. They don't pray up on the hilltop in front of everybody else about how good they are and then go around and arrest people and shake people down and have the tax collector do it.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  The tax collector actually goes out and does it. He has to be hated. What about the people behind that that tell them to go out and do it?
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  See, I used to attack the TSA all day long. So I realized we let Congress do that. Congress did that. They set all that up. They bring the Islamics and they let them attack.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  And then they turn around and then, oh, I'm just going to blame the TSA people. No. I stopped being a hypocrite. I grew up.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  And look, I mean, I was always somewhat on target for 20-something years on air, but you really look at the copouts in the world like I let Congress do that. You let Congress do that.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  I'm not going to sit there at some schlub working at the TSA who really thinks he's trying to look for terrorists and shows a few perverts and criminals in there as well.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  It's a bureaucracy and it's bad and I don't like it and I say get rid of it. But you know what? You know who really let people sit there and try to grow up my children?
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  Is the public of this country, the NFL watching, want to be tough guys that run their mouths all day but wouldn't do anything when it came down to the line?
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  They'd turn and they'd run as fast as they could from any type of real challenge.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  Here's the difference. I'm not running. You know what I'm scared of? I'm scared of running. I'm scared of being a coward.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  The only thing that feels good is going straight up against this thing.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  And that's why the globalists hate us so much because they know they can't scare us because I'm already scared of separation from God.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  I've already tied into that energy. I've already dialed into it and it's so good that I'm actually ashamed at how fearless I am because I should worry about myself and my family.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  It's not some wanton thing or some negligent thing where I threw the fear aside.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  But still there's shadows and echoes of that when I'm all in everything.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  My family, my name, my treasure, my blood, I'm ready. It's all in. Let me tell you, making that decision at a spiritual level is like coming out of Egypt.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  It's like coming out of Babylon. The minute you decide to be all in is the minute you start living.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  And then you start knowing that this is all just a test. You don't want to commit suicide. You don't want to die.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  But you're not afraid anymore and you realize God's holding your hand.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  So you want to stay here for your family and stay here to take on the enemy.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  But you want to be with God.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  The only thing that matters in this universe is that when you get buried six feet under, you're with God.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  Because God is all about free will.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  And God isn't going to be there if you don't want him to be.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  But that, my friends, is what separates us.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  Is that choice? People that are so insecure, that are so weak, that they would out of fear give in to this spirit, believing it would deal with them easier if they rolled over to it.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  Rolling over only presents your belly to the wolf.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  If the wolf's going to come, even if he's successful, defeating me, he's going to choke on my flesh.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  May the wolf choke on my flesh.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  Well, they're right back on the other side. I'll finish up with Trump. Get into the big news. I haven't hit yet.
