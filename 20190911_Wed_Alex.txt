[00:00.000 --> 00:16.820]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:54.280]  We are now in the middle of a battle that is very intense and could go either way that's why the
[00:54.280 --> 01:03.040]  forces of evil of dehumanization of greed and hatred and lies are so angry and throwing out
[01:03.040 --> 01:10.240]  all the stops right now because humanity was asleep and their victory was almost complete
[01:10.240 --> 01:21.160]  but in the 11th hour 58th minute the spirit of humanity began to rekindle its fire and that's
[01:21.160 --> 01:26.960]  why we see all the intimidation and all the authoritarianism and all the attempts to bankrupt
[01:26.960 --> 01:33.640]  and attack anyone that criticizes these authoritarian control freak bullies in any way.
[01:33.640 --> 01:38.320]  A few months ago James D'Amour learned the hard way what happens when you question the
[01:38.320 --> 01:43.400]  group think of Silicon Valley. While working at Google the world's most powerful company
[01:43.400 --> 01:49.240]  D'Amour privately circulated a paper questioning his employer's diversity policies. He didn't
[01:49.240 --> 01:55.160]  attack anyone he just questioned the internal logic of what he was being told. In this complaint
[01:55.160 --> 02:02.280]  you have example after example of Google targeting people on the basis of their race and their sex.
[02:02.280 --> 02:08.600]  My impression was that was illegal is it? It is illegal it's illegal under federal law it's
[02:08.600 --> 02:12.480]  illegal under California law and what a lot of lawyers even around the country don't understand
[02:12.480 --> 02:18.600]  that under California law we have a unique labor code provision that makes it illegal to discriminate
[02:18.600 --> 02:22.520]  against somebody on the basis of their political activities or their political views.
[02:22.520 --> 02:28.920]  Head of the United Nations global communication says illegally entering the U.S. is a right
[02:29.720 --> 02:35.880]  but you try to enter the U.N. building they will arrest you and if they charge you with
[02:35.880 --> 02:40.520]  fake war crimes they'll poison you in your jail cell like Slovan Milošević. Challenge
[02:40.520 --> 02:46.680]  ship shuts down 100 year old fire department after one member tried to join the proud boys.
[02:46.680 --> 02:52.360]  That's your virtue signaling. The decision made over allegations the board of the fire company
[02:52.360 --> 02:56.840]  failed to take any action after learning one of its volunteers had been affiliated with an
[02:56.840 --> 03:02.920]  extremist group. We do not want anyone in the township to question or be afraid of somebody
[03:02.920 --> 03:06.920]  that's coming into their home. That's right punish the whole fire department and let the
[03:06.920 --> 03:12.280]  citizens burn to death because the leftists will teach you that even being near someone proud of
[03:12.280 --> 03:19.480]  America will cause everyone to lose their jobs. Politifact rates 100 percent real photo of Biden
[03:19.480 --> 03:30.600]  with KKK Grand Dragon as mostly false. That's right. Isn't that just amazing? You know I had
[03:30.600 --> 03:36.200]  free Ricky Ross in here and he's a smart guy and he'd never heard Hillary Clinton say black people
[03:36.200 --> 03:40.200]  are super predators need to be brought to Hill like dogs. That's a quote by the way. You mean
[03:40.200 --> 03:45.080]  to play it again for you? We also have to have an organized effort against gangs just as in a
[03:45.080 --> 03:50.200]  previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on
[03:50.200 --> 03:56.600]  they are often connected to big drug cartels they are not just gangs of kids anymore they are often
[03:56.600 --> 04:02.360]  the kinds of kids that are called super predators no conscience no empathy we can talk about why
[04:02.360 --> 04:07.240]  they ended up that way but first we have to bring them to heal and the president has asked the FBI
[04:07.240 --> 04:13.080]  to launch a very concerted effort against gangs everywhere sabotaging culture learning how to
[04:13.080 --> 04:21.400]  manipulate people engaging in deception is cancer it's knowledge of evil it's a virus it manipulate
[04:21.400 --> 04:29.400]  systems that already existed and causes entropy and collapse it does not pro-generate it does not
[04:29.400 --> 04:42.680]  fount it does not found it is not a source it is not a creator it is not a builder a

[06:18.360 --> 06:23.080]  live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[06:25.880 --> 06:32.440]  ladies and gentlemen it's september 11th 2019 18 years since the tragic attacks on the pentagon
[06:32.440 --> 06:37.720]  and the world trade center complex we'll be breaking all of that down today and what really
[06:37.720 --> 06:43.080]  happened now we were the first of course question the official story that's now been verified by
[06:43.080 --> 06:48.920]  the new orc fire department by major engineering associations and others that bombs were in tower
[06:48.920 --> 06:55.160]  one two and seven that doesn't mean radical islam isn't a major threat but there were
[06:55.160 --> 07:00.200]  globalists working with radical islam and that's all been proven and we've been proven
[07:00.200 --> 07:06.600]  accurate and correct on that that is coming up let me though raise the real alarm here
[07:06.600 --> 07:12.920]  and it's the it's not the economic problems we have that's bad enough it's not the debt it's
[07:12.920 --> 07:20.840]  it's not the fiat currency what we're really facing and what we're really dealing with is a
[07:20.840 --> 07:27.640]  societal cultural and spiritual decline and everyone knows that we could rebuild civilization
[07:28.680 --> 07:34.200]  very quickly if we have our moral compass and if we can trust each other
[07:34.200 --> 07:43.080]  but when honor and duty and decency is replaced by laziness decadence corruption and then evil
[07:43.800 --> 07:50.040]  doesn't matter how much wealth you have it's all completely worthless wealth and and technology
[07:50.040 --> 08:00.440]  are only tools and in the hands of evil it becomes evil personified and empowered
[08:00.440 --> 08:06.200]  now i'm going to do something here today
[08:08.200 --> 08:14.760]  that i don't normally do and i'm going to air a long report in the first hour that paul joseph
[08:14.760 --> 08:26.040]  watson put together because it's very well done it's very informative for radio it's extremely
[08:26.040 --> 08:32.280]  informative to a nauseation level if you're a tv viewer but i i suggest everyone watch this
[08:32.840 --> 08:39.080]  and really get an idea on just how bad the degeneracy's gotten and then just in case you
[08:39.080 --> 08:49.240]  think paul watson's exaggerating just in the last hour or so i gave the crew 10 clips to go dig out
[08:49.240 --> 08:56.280]  of the archives we've already got a few of them but they're getting more of democrat events
[08:57.480 --> 09:01.800]  where mainline democrats women begin sticking their tongues out saying hell satan
[09:02.840 --> 09:07.800]  people say we're demon possessed we have as many abortions as possible as a sacrifice to satan
[09:09.480 --> 09:13.960]  people saying they want to kill children up to age three you have to understand they're
[09:13.960 --> 09:24.440]  volunteering this when i went to an event called donald trump and alex jones and the fake news
[09:24.440 --> 09:30.280]  that the city of austin put on last year people ran up to me when i went to the event that had my
[09:30.280 --> 09:37.320]  name on it they had downtown blocked off on congress street from the capital and began saying we want
[09:37.320 --> 09:46.760]  the children and hissing and saying there are we like them there are is not yours like something
[09:46.760 --> 09:55.800]  out of the exorcist but real it's on video you have to understand they've taken on the
[09:55.800 --> 10:04.120]  archetype the spirit however you look at it their spirit animal is a demon democrats liberals leftist
[10:04.120 --> 10:11.480]  from the french revolution up until now the soviet union you name it in between word devil worshipers
[10:12.920 --> 10:17.160]  the island and people that were close to him and books were written about him he actually
[10:17.160 --> 10:28.200]  worshiped the devil the red terror was about more blood and so the 911 today is the 60 million
[10:28.200 --> 10:33.080]  abortions roughly we've had in this country that we know of and seven states don't report california
[10:33.080 --> 10:38.520]  and others are amongst them so it's probably 70 80 million we don't know and the fact that they're
[10:38.520 --> 10:49.480]  keeping the babies alive is back in mainstream news today and it's even sicker it's even sicker
[10:51.240 --> 10:54.680]  people pose with the dead babies and take photos the parents
[10:54.680 --> 11:03.640]  some catholics even give the child a christening
[11:06.200 --> 11:11.080]  and in other cases they're kept alive and harvested and we're going to show you this is
[11:11.080 --> 11:14.760]  mainstream news so they've gotten to the point now

[20:26.680 --> 20:35.400]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen i have hundreds of huge stories credible clips to get to but
[20:36.120 --> 20:42.520]  at the heart of the number one issue is the fact that we have massive moral decline
[20:43.480 --> 20:50.520]  and that's our number one problem in every metric every sign shows it and there are a lot of articles
[20:50.520 --> 20:57.080]  and a lot of videos and a lot of reports that detail all of this right now
[20:59.720 --> 21:07.640]  that people need to be warned about info wars dot com and news wars dot com because if they just
[21:07.640 --> 21:15.640]  put all this out and then normalize it there'll be no value in human life anymore and then the
[21:15.640 --> 21:20.840]  globalists can carry out their depopulation operation and the rise of the cyborgs and the
[21:20.840 --> 21:25.640]  post human world they're teaching us to hate ourselves they're teaching us to have no life
[21:25.640 --> 21:31.160]  force and then they're teaching us once were these empty vessels turned over to a great delusion
[21:32.200 --> 21:37.800]  to actually enjoy hurting the innocent and going against our own instincts our own spiritual
[21:38.760 --> 21:43.800]  compass so again i played these clips sunday i'm not going to play them now of the people
[21:43.800 --> 21:48.520]  saying we keep them alive we have their hearts stanford buys their beating hearts you know they
[21:48.520 --> 21:52.360]  kill the babies right there on the spot they're taken from the hospital and taken over to stanford
[21:53.160 --> 21:56.840]  we have their heads intact which which means they're not stuck in the brains out
[21:56.840 --> 22:03.320]  in the vaginal canal the federal law states but a lot of other hospitals don't go as far as to
[22:04.120 --> 22:10.360]  keep them alive and then harvest their organs some of the more christian churches that uh
[22:10.360 --> 22:15.560]  conduct abortions so-called christian remember most churches used to be christian non-profits
[22:15.560 --> 22:22.360]  now they're profitable but still have the christian name what they do is they keep them comfortable
[22:23.320 --> 22:28.760]  illinois hospital created comfort room for aborted babies to die in
[22:32.280 --> 22:36.440]  now see there's a big story out the top story in the country right now the top trending on
[22:36.440 --> 22:42.760]  yahoo and on cnn about some people out in california went for this big mountain hike
[22:43.480 --> 22:47.560]  and they got to the gorge they wanted to and thought that they could ride the the waves
[22:47.560 --> 22:52.600]  down the waterfall that was too rough so they put a thing in a bottle and sent it down and the
[22:52.600 --> 22:56.760]  people found it and they got saved by a helicopter a few hours later sounds like a stage story
[22:57.400 --> 23:03.080]  they could have just gone back nobody was hurt sounds like a total stage story like most of those
[23:03.080 --> 23:07.960]  go fund me things i tell your stage turn out to be stage stage in my view that's my opinion
[23:09.400 --> 23:12.360]  because they're not in a crisis not a big deal it's the top story in the country
[23:13.720 --> 23:17.640]  imagine you know babies can't talk they're there right now all over the country being
[23:17.640 --> 23:23.480]  kept alive waiting a few days maybe a week till all the orders come in for their organs and then
[23:23.480 --> 23:29.560]  they're killed they're killed and they're there all over and we know the hospitals they're in we
[23:29.560 --> 23:37.560]  know the universities that are you know dissecting them live we have the court hearings
[23:40.360 --> 23:47.160]  and we have all of it right there we have all the admissions we have the undercover video and
[23:47.800 --> 23:52.520]  oh but that's a hospital or oh that's university hey that's the establishment you know they can
[23:52.520 --> 23:57.800]  do what they want oh but the good people that found the gatorade model that said help and
[23:57.800 --> 24:02.440]  they pulled it out and right over the hill was the family that needed to be saved and then the
[24:02.440 --> 24:08.200]  the chips helicopter came and got them oh yay people really care about each other but cnn doesn't
[24:08.200 --> 24:14.520]  tell you about this illinois hospital created comfort room for aborted babies to die in
[24:15.720 --> 24:23.080]  inmates remained alive for hours after abortion procedure because the doctors said well the baby
[24:23.080 --> 24:29.320]  slept out before we could suck the brains out and so we're just going to go put them in a room to die
[24:31.480 --> 24:37.800]  and sometimes they don't die so you got to drop them in water now that's the that's the loving abortion
[24:37.800 --> 24:45.560]  facilities the loving ones just let them down their own or go and drop them into a that of water
[24:47.480 --> 24:52.200]  but the really scientific ones keep them alive and get top dollar because you know those hospitals
[24:52.200 --> 24:58.920]  sell the babies and chop them up as well they just don't get top dollar like you get by keeping them
[24:58.920 --> 25:07.640]  alive why are you gonna waste all that seven pounds of me so eyewitnesses babies born alive
[25:07.640 --> 25:16.360]  after abortion were drowned in saline aren't we a good species as every eyewitness nurse revealed
[25:16.360 --> 25:22.120]  how a hospital in illinois has a comfort room god i love how that's irwellian in which a boarded
[25:22.120 --> 25:31.400]  babies who survive for hours outside the womb are left to die jill scenic told a hearing on the
[25:31.400 --> 25:36.760]  born alive act in washington dc there's video of this the doctors at christ hospital in oak lawn
[25:36.760 --> 25:43.960]  perform live birth abortions where the babies allowed to die during and after the abortion
[25:43.960 --> 25:49.960]  procedure and in february of this year they couldn't even get the congress to pass a law called the
[25:49.960 --> 25:58.360]  born alive act that if you're survive outside the womb they can't kill you they can't even get a law
[25:58.360 --> 26:03.960]  passed by the way once a baby's outside the womb it is murder to let it die or kill it but they don't
[26:03.960 --> 26:08.360]  care because they don't want to prosecute anybody they're trying to pass a law to remind you hey here's
[26:08.360 --> 26:16.200]  one more law don't do that the hospital provides comfort care oh i'm that sweet for the babies
[26:16.200 --> 26:21.480]  for hours so if i put you in a room and let you starve to death while you cry begging for mommy
[26:22.360 --> 26:26.680]  if i kidnap you and put you in a room it's called a comfort room maybe that you call

[26:34.680 --> 26:40.360]  or malice death camps or comfort rooms the hospital provides comfort care for the babies
[26:40.360 --> 26:46.040]  for hours after the procedure by wrapping the infant to blanket and keeping it warm until it dies
[26:46.040 --> 26:56.280]  oh parents the baby are also allowed to hold it during this time oh my gosh if staff did not have
[26:56.280 --> 27:01.720]  the time or desire to hold the baby she was taken to christ hospital comfort room which is complete
[27:01.720 --> 27:06.600]  with the first photo machine if parents wanted professional pictures of their aborted baby

[28:06.600 --> 28:11.640]  of his life because his parents did not want to hold him towards the end he was so quiet
[28:11.640 --> 28:16.600]  i could not tell he's alive stanik said she held him up in the light to see through his chest
[28:17.240 --> 28:21.560]  whether his heart was still beating after he was pronounced dead i folded his little arms
[28:21.560 --> 28:28.040]  across his chest wrapped him in his tiny shroud and carried him to the hospital morgue where all

[32:56.280 --> 33:14.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:14.760 --> 33:32.120]  from deep in the heart of fema region six austin texas transmitting worldwide
[33:32.120 --> 33:41.000]  it's alex jones so depending on what numbers you look at there's been 60 million plus abortions
[33:41.000 --> 33:48.760]  in the united states but seven states don't report so it's much higher than that but if you
[33:48.760 --> 33:59.080]  divide 3 000 people into 60 million that's quite a many nine elevens you know when you talk about
[33:59.080 --> 34:06.600]  the communist chinese you admit that they've killed 150 million of their own people 84 million of
[34:06.600 --> 34:14.840]  those under mausetown and his cultural revolution and his great leap forward and then you think about
[34:14.840 --> 34:23.560]  hitler who got 20 million germans killed 22 million russians killed six million pols killed
[34:24.360 --> 34:29.800]  millions and millions of jews killed hundreds of thousands of people in the middle east killed
[34:30.440 --> 34:34.440]  hundreds of thousands of us killed hundreds of thousands of british killed hundreds of thousands
[34:34.440 --> 34:40.200]  of french killed no one really knows but a lot of numbers say that 80 million people died in world
[34:40.200 --> 34:46.280]  war two and the japanese killed probably 10 million they're not sure in china united states killed over
[34:46.280 --> 34:52.120]  10 million japanese and we dropped two atomic bombs on them that's not what really did it we had uh
[34:52.120 --> 34:57.240]  sometimes 3 000 planes 40s when we had air superiority the last six months the war before
[34:57.240 --> 35:01.880]  the land invasion that was going to happen that never happened and they would drop hundreds of
[35:01.880 --> 35:07.240]  thousands of incendiary bombs in one day on japan and japan was made out of paper and wood
[35:07.960 --> 35:12.600]  and so they dropped bombs on days that had 40 mile an hour winds where they estimate five
[35:12.600 --> 35:18.120]  million people died in one day during fire bombing that's right more died in one day than
[35:18.120 --> 35:25.400]  had died in the whole war before so by the time fat man and little boy were dropped on hereshima
[35:25.400 --> 35:33.480]  nakasaki japanese didn't know what planet they were on but let's let's talk about mass death 20
[35:33.480 --> 35:41.480]  people die in texas at a walmart and it's the end of the world and it is terrible it happened
[35:42.440 --> 35:48.280]  a statistically slipping in your bathroom way more often way to die than getting shot by a gun
[35:49.480 --> 35:54.280]  that's a fact automobile accidents way beyond but they don't hype that up because the government
[35:54.280 --> 35:59.160]  the corrupt elements of it want your guns all other citizens around the world except
[35:59.160 --> 36:02.440]  israel to a certain extent in switzerland have had their guns taken
[36:05.480 --> 36:09.080]  and the left that tells you they care about civilization and society so much
[36:10.600 --> 36:14.520]  now admit yeah we want to register and confiscate all your semi-autos and then your single shot
[36:14.520 --> 36:18.120]  after that so you can live under the criminals like them and a corrupt government
[36:18.120 --> 36:27.640]  but i remember 25 years ago it's 27 28 years ago i mean i was a high school
[36:27.640 --> 36:33.800]  senior going out and doing pro-life demonstrations because i was guilty because i've been involved
[36:33.800 --> 36:38.040]  in some abortions and then i'd been lied to and god touched my spirit touched my soul and
[36:38.600 --> 36:44.120]  really put it on my heart to get politically involved first fighting abortion because of
[36:44.120 --> 36:50.760]  because of that that weight on my heart that that god's lifted so i'm not perfect here
[36:51.640 --> 36:59.480]  but see i was deceived i was young and stupid once they get you into it and you harden your
[36:59.480 --> 37:06.680]  heart well once you know it's evil then it starts becoming a satanic fetish and i remember
[37:06.680 --> 37:12.520]  and now you've seen this in countless videos people caught it where black people would walk
[37:12.520 --> 37:17.160]  over me man land i've had reverend children song about this who runs black genocide.org
[37:17.880 --> 37:23.400]  trying to fight that and they'll walk over and say you're gonna try to save these ugly evil and
[37:23.400 --> 37:31.000]  call them inwards and i saw this dozens of times and weird abortion doctors will come out and like
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.720]  talk like demons and go i will kill the children but we have it on video now do you like me to
[37:35.720 --> 37:41.720]  play it i will and it's not just a few of them you get around abortion clinics and you'll see
[37:41.720 --> 37:48.120]  people walk in england i mean whatever you want to call it killing babies all day ain't good for you
[37:50.840 --> 37:54.200]  i mean i could show we're gonna roll video where the doctors walk in going
[37:56.440 --> 38:00.680]  they'll go planet serving i swear i mean you don't believe in demons you've got to go around
[38:00.680 --> 38:05.320]  these places you'll see it they'll start going your planet's ours the satan is my master
[38:05.320 --> 38:12.120]  bar and i mean we have it on video i'm gonna show you i don't go to god i hate jesus dead
[38:12.120 --> 38:16.040]  where do you think they get stuff like linda blare on the exorcist that's what it looks like
[38:17.720 --> 38:24.040]  go and go to an abortion clinic today witness it talk about god tell somebody it's wrong they'll
[38:24.040 --> 38:28.440]  be like how are you doing today you know jesus is real and these babies are real and you know it's
[38:28.440 --> 38:34.520]  really bad for what you're doing shut up i'll keep doing it if i want if you don't believe in god
[38:34.520 --> 38:40.120]  then you're blind folks it's real and you want to know where the demons are they're at the abortion
[38:40.120 --> 38:49.000]  clinics of course they are so these people don't care about life they don't care about you and you
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.320]  think that was horrible how they keep the babies alive and how they have the comfort rooms where
[38:53.320 --> 39:00.760]  they die in illinois that's just that's that's the last system that's how they were handling it
[39:00.760 --> 39:06.200]  and so they're phasing that out where they keep them alive and ship them off and now they're
[39:06.200 --> 39:10.280]  going to start pilot programs because the mothers are learning hey i could get money for this
[39:10.280 --> 39:16.280]  like she's a farmer well yes man would you like us to cut you in which is one way to sabotage all
[39:16.280 --> 39:20.120]  this because once the lawyers get involved and once the women figure out that that baby's worth
[39:20.120 --> 39:25.640]  a hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollars cash or even more to be adopted they'll be a race
[39:25.640 --> 39:32.040]  with christians and then we'll be able to buy the children they won't be able to kill them but that's
[39:32.040 --> 39:36.280]  how this works look at this latest article i mean drudge is linked to the one illinois hospital
[39:36.280 --> 39:41.800]  created comfort room for aborted babies to die in we added a link to this to new sexual fetish
[39:41.800 --> 39:46.040]  couples getting pregnant and having multiple abortions and i want you to listen to me very very
[39:46.040 --> 39:56.760]  carefully this is not isolated this is this is the operating system taking over when we come back
[39:56.760 --> 40:02.360]  i'm going to play you some clips of this you walk up and you say what are you doing at this abortion
[40:02.360 --> 40:07.640]  clinic i'm here to make sure we murder more children i love it i've killed 30 40 50 i enjoy
[40:07.640 --> 40:13.960]  it so much i love murdering my children and they're not just trying to shock you this is really how
[40:13.960 --> 40:19.800]  they operate it's who they are remember how matt drudge not obsessing on matt drudge is true
[40:19.800 --> 40:27.400]  got kicked off foxes was hit show he showed a baby's hand reaching out of a womb and touching a doctor's
[40:27.400 --> 40:35.480]  hand now that was in a cesarean of a memory serves they went oh it was deceptive he said
[40:35.480 --> 40:40.280]  it was an abortion no he showed a baby being taken out of the womb by a knife one way it lives
[40:40.280 --> 40:45.160]  the other way it dies point is it grabs the doctor's finger it's real and the big sin is
[40:45.160 --> 40:50.120]  humanizing these people and again if we don't humanize them we don't have any hope or prayer
[40:50.120 --> 40:54.760]  with our other humans once the checks and balances are gone much less the creator of the universe
[40:54.760 --> 41:01.160]  that does not smile upon this so on this 9 11 save the 3 000 that died millions are getting
[41:01.160 --> 41:05.080]  killed by the islamists this is terrible we're going to focus on that more coming up and what's
[41:05.080 --> 41:08.760]  happening in europe the open borders and turkey holding europe hostages and we have a reporter
[41:08.760 --> 41:14.280]  joining us it's all coming up then a google whistleblower and uh robert barns back in studio
[41:14.840 --> 41:21.160]  but if we don't stand up and if we don't speak out and if we don't recognize what's happening
[41:21.720 --> 41:28.280]  we have no hope so i'm gonna call watson has a 16 minute report showing these people
[41:28.280 --> 41:33.080]  celebrating killing babies and this is real i can show you a newscast i just remember that one
[41:33.080 --> 41:39.000]  where the woman goes in and gets the abortion he goes oh it feels so good oh and you think you're
[41:39.000 --> 41:45.480]  watching a porno movie hollywood is completely turned over to satan
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.800]  this is real and denying it is going to get us all destroyed so we're going to come back and
[41:53.800 --> 42:00.600]  play all that briefly i was thinking about last night that this is probably the time to go ahead
[42:00.600 --> 42:09.480]  and just be completely frank with everybody and it's really hard to express this properly because
[42:09.480 --> 42:20.360]  there's a lot of facets and a lot of angles and a lot of different ways that i can basically break
[42:20.360 --> 42:27.960]  this down and so trying to think of the best way to describe it the most accurately is somewhat of
[42:27.960 --> 42:33.640]  a paradox and a conundrum so before i get to these videos on the other side uh i'm going to talk
[42:33.640 --> 42:39.640]  about the future of info wars and whether it's going to be here or not and just really come to
[42:39.640 --> 42:45.400]  grips with that fact with the listeners because we've withstood a lot here in fact no one has
[42:45.400 --> 42:49.800]  withstood this much attack other than something like president trump uh and we don't have his
[42:49.800 --> 42:54.520]  resources and so we're going to be discussing all of that coming up on the other side then
[42:54.520 --> 43:00.520]  dan liman joins us at the start the next hour we sold secret 12 for four years and it was our

[46:01.000 --> 46:07.320]  to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia
[46:07.320 --> 46:13.720]  i was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting i was the first to begin to
[46:13.720 --> 46:19.320]  warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested
[46:19.320 --> 46:25.560]  i was the first to warn you along with paul watson at infowars.com 15 years ago that google was using
[46:25.560 --> 46:32.440]  microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds and hundreds of other giant
[46:32.440 --> 46:37.720]  issues like the federal reserve being private run for profit trying to control our economy
[46:37.720 --> 46:42.600]  that our government in hollywood have been taken over by the communist chinese on every one of these
[46:42.600 --> 46:47.880]  issues and many others we've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on the planetary scale
[46:47.880 --> 46:53.160]  that's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical than ever
[46:53.160 --> 46:57.000]  to support the info war please support the info war however you can
[46:57.000 --> 47:24.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:24.840 --> 47:33.160]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the info wars.com studios
[47:33.160 --> 47:40.440]  it's alex jones so it's september 11th 2019 18 years later we'll be getting into the controlled
[47:40.440 --> 47:46.040]  demolition of towers 127 show you all the proof and now the firefighter's union coming out and
[47:46.040 --> 47:51.240]  saying it and top universities and all the computer models and the reports and we have all the footage
[47:51.240 --> 47:55.880]  they said they blew it up that day doesn't mean there weren't islamists involved doesn't mean
[47:55.880 --> 48:00.600]  like the new york times said airplanes attacked the towers new york times said islam had nothing
[48:00.600 --> 48:08.360]  to do with it we're going to decode 9-11 coming up but getting back to the big issue we've got
[48:08.360 --> 48:14.360]  60 plus million abortions in this country we've got the left now making it a woman's empowerment
[48:14.360 --> 48:19.720]  thing and all these tv shows and movies go and get that little bugger dig that baby out
[48:19.720 --> 48:26.360]  and you've got women that get pregnant for the power of killing the baby and the enjoyment
[48:26.360 --> 48:31.480]  that they get to kill a human that happens in psychopaths all the time it's why the mansons
[48:31.480 --> 48:36.360]  went out and killed people they were trying to cause a race war i mean that's why cults get
[48:36.360 --> 48:41.240]  together is they want that power over another life they want to carry that out there's a satanic
[48:41.240 --> 48:48.840]  hunger a vampiric spiritual dark side hunger that we know is real that manifests itself i'll get to
[48:48.840 --> 48:56.760]  that in a moment as the world learns of this horror that's going on right beneath the surface
[48:56.760 --> 49:02.920]  because patriots are exposing it and now all these governors are passing laws to make it legal to
[49:02.920 --> 49:08.520]  kill a baby after it's born because they've already been doing it see if they don't all go to prison
[49:09.800 --> 49:15.400]  they're too able to fail and it's just going to get worse now let me give you a report card on
[49:15.400 --> 49:20.760]  info wars you know that we got shadow ban when hillary lost three years ago and you know that
[49:20.760 --> 49:25.080]  we've been through a giant demonization process of building a straw man where my character is
[49:25.080 --> 49:31.000]  being assassinated and where i am put out there as the worst person on earth i supposedly sent
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.280]  child porn to the sandy hook parents and children it's it's all lies i mean you know that and then
[49:36.280 --> 49:41.720]  in august of last year they had a concerted banning from linkedin to facebook to twitter to youtube to
[49:41.720 --> 49:48.120]  everywhere and then ganged up even more with lies so i couldn't respond that's okay that's what happens
[49:48.120 --> 49:53.080]  when you take on the globalist and get a populist elected and we're in the middle of a civil war
[49:53.080 --> 50:01.240]  with the globalist we're trying to take the country back but a lot of things have transpired and
[50:01.240 --> 50:05.880]  unfolded and i've really keep thinking about doing a graphic of this with the actual math for you
[50:06.520 --> 50:09.320]  so i could show you then i get so busy covering the news we haven't done it
[50:09.320 --> 50:16.440]  but but this is what it comes down to they took our sponsors away about harassing them over the
[50:16.440 --> 50:23.320]  years they wouldn't let us advertise on a lot of third-party platforms they took all the digital
[50:23.320 --> 50:28.200]  advertising platforms we had away they took our commenting systems away they took most of our
[50:28.200 --> 50:33.320]  merchant accounts that we had for 20 plus years highest ratings away they're now doing to the nra
[50:33.320 --> 50:37.640]  that's in the news today new jersey says you basically can't sell guns in the state unless you
[50:37.640 --> 50:46.520]  shut down the nra we were the canary in the coal mine and so i made a lot of cuts and did a lot of
[50:46.520 --> 50:54.200]  things and really been over backwards to try to keep going and even try to expand in the face of
[50:54.200 --> 51:02.520]  this because you're not expanding you're contracting and so i've definitely hit a point with the math
[51:02.520 --> 51:05.480]  there's never been a guy that does a bunch of math stuff and a bunch of marketing stuff
[51:05.480 --> 51:09.400]  because i just have a good feel for it know how to you try to run an operation because the main
[51:09.400 --> 51:14.280]  mission is getting information out the business end is just the engine and the fuel propulsion
[51:14.280 --> 51:21.720]  system again it's there but in about the last three four months we passed a demarcation line
[51:21.720 --> 51:31.720]  a point of really no return where i have selling product that i have and i'll be able to continue
[51:31.720 --> 51:39.640]  for a year at our current even slight expansion rate but then when all of that product is sold
[51:39.640 --> 51:46.520]  out there'll be no money because i won't be reordering and so now i've reached the point where
[51:46.520 --> 51:49.720]  i can actually count i think we're gonna have a countdown to the shutdown of infill wars
[51:49.720 --> 51:55.480]  365 days i mean really that's that's true and i don't like the enemy to know this but they've
[51:55.480 --> 52:00.440]  already got moles and they should buy honest i mean they're fully aware but all the things
[52:00.440 --> 52:04.920]  they've done to us you know having to pay a higher rate for just merchant accounts and
[52:04.920 --> 52:09.720]  having to pay for all our own bandwidth and having to have 24 hour security up here you know arm
[52:09.720 --> 52:15.080]  trained security and to have it at my house there's no antifa i'm not going to get into it but let's
[52:15.080 --> 52:21.480]  just say they they come around and antifa is just a decoy for another group they're just the fall
[52:21.480 --> 52:25.880]  guys and so we're in the middle of revolution we're in the middle of the war i know that most
[52:25.880 --> 52:29.800]  our audience knows that but i'm always saying hey if you don't support us we won't be here
[52:29.800 --> 52:33.640]  thanks for the support and and and if i hadn't been saying that the support wouldn't come in
[52:33.640 --> 52:37.240]  and we wouldn't be here but we've reached a particular point where they thought we'd never
[52:37.240 --> 52:42.120]  last this long be my god they give 200 million dollars to vox just from one group or their
[52:42.120 --> 52:46.360]  hundred million from another just run for a year and they can't even make money and don't even have
[52:46.360 --> 52:51.320]  one tenth of our reach currently or you take vice is going bankrupt they've put billions behind that
[52:51.320 --> 52:57.000]  disney has it's and soros put 500 million in it's going bankrupt uh and think progress and they're
[52:57.000 --> 53:02.840]  all propped up they never turned to profit we dominated in the free market realm of ideas
[53:04.040 --> 53:08.840]  and we were reaching hundreds of millions of people a week sometimes usually 50 million or so
[53:09.640 --> 53:13.800]  but now we have the core audience we're able to get talking points out that get out to the
[53:13.800 --> 53:18.760]  rest of talk radio and fox news and to the government the government does listen a firing
[53:18.760 --> 53:24.440]  government's listen our mission has never been more critical we've never reached more important
[53:24.440 --> 53:27.640]  people than we're reaching now we reach a lot of new people thanks to spread the word but it's
[53:27.640 --> 53:31.560]  only through word of mouth and through text messages and emails you do that and now they're
[53:31.560 --> 53:35.720]  in the news saying they want to stop you being able to share info wars over text messages and email
[53:35.720 --> 53:41.240]  we were talking to an executive at xm yesterday and they said yeah i can't ever get you emails or
[53:41.240 --> 53:47.560]  get your emails they block that in the system so we're being blacklisted everywhere it's intense
[53:48.120 --> 53:52.360]  and i'm not a victim i'm a fighter i mean you know if they kill me tomorrow i've carried out my
[53:52.360 --> 53:57.320]  mission i've gone super far had incredible victories thanks to god your support and i'm not a loser i'm
[53:57.320 --> 54:03.960]  a winner but i am a target i mean this is a organic americana military operation we've run
[54:03.960 --> 54:08.120]  that didn't have any commands or anything i'm just a citizen in a human following my genetic
[54:08.120 --> 54:12.360]  programming of my ancestors that were all during critical times at the head of the fight
[54:12.360 --> 54:16.120]  and i'm repeating what the genetic code shows that's why they're like who's training and who's
[54:16.120 --> 54:20.520]  behind it what's going on here well it's the genetics and you've got the genetics obviously
[54:20.520 --> 54:24.360]  you're tuned in you might be black you might be old you might be white you might be hispanic you
[54:24.360 --> 54:29.880]  might be asian the fact that you're tuned in and care and are informed shows you've got what it takes
[54:30.680 --> 54:33.560]  to to to be involved and so
[54:36.760 --> 54:39.880]  i don't want to sit here and run all these ads we're formatted for radio people really don't
[54:39.880 --> 54:43.480]  even listen to the ads and then i don't want to sit here and plug all day on air about the great
[54:43.480 --> 54:49.480]  products we've got i'm just going to tell listeners that i'm not going to dial things back i'm not
[54:49.480 --> 54:53.400]  going to lay a bunch of people off i'm just going to go a hundred percent into the election
[54:54.200 --> 54:57.880]  and i'm going to spend everything on we've got and i'm just going to put everything
[54:57.880 --> 55:03.800]  on the front lines and go all in to reignite americana to expose the globalist and to ignite
[55:03.800 --> 55:08.760]  populism worldwide and i'm not going to just fizzle out and trail out here i'm going to go out
[55:08.760 --> 55:15.320]  with a big fiery bang now if you want to listen to that call and go buy a bunch of products
[55:15.320 --> 55:19.160]  and and sign up for auto ships you don't forget and if you want to tell others about the show and
[55:19.160 --> 55:23.800]  you want to really get aggressive to support the info war that'll be wonderful and we'll go into
[55:23.800 --> 55:30.040]  the election year and get the funding we need but i'm currently selling out of products and
[55:30.040 --> 55:35.800]  discounting and to sell them where i cannot fund the operation and buy more product so you understand
[55:35.800 --> 55:40.040]  that it's kind of like you're on a mission you've got fuel and you've got to get to a certain place
[55:40.040 --> 55:45.960]  but when you get there there's no fuel to come back you understand so and i'm not going to
[55:45.960 --> 55:52.040]  sit here and just dial back and cut people's pay and and then just kind of wobble on in the future
[55:52.920 --> 55:58.360]  i'm going to 110 percent paddle the metal do work as hard as i can get people people
[55:58.360 --> 56:03.560]  noticing i'm more focused i'm more on target because we're going into a critical crossroads
[56:03.560 --> 56:09.080]  and we're going into 25 years of info wars will it make it 26 27 years can you imagine the victory
[56:09.080 --> 56:14.840]  the globals will have if we're not here so i make it really easy to get the products i mean we go
[56:14.840 --> 56:18.120]  out and go what's the best selling skin cream well it's hyaluronic acid with vitamin a and
[56:18.680 --> 56:25.720]  coconut oil and okay let's add the best nano silver salt to it that everybody loves so it has that
[56:25.720 --> 56:32.840]  added you know barrier to bacteria and viruses and then we sell it for half the price that hyaluronic
[56:32.840 --> 56:38.840]  acid by itself is sold at the store and i know why those companies have a four or five time markup
[56:38.840 --> 56:42.760]  that's how they pay the taxes their employees and the insurance and the marketing all the rest of it
[56:44.120 --> 56:48.760]  we've gotten to position where we're usually 150 markup then we sell it at 100 markup discounted
[56:48.760 --> 56:52.120]  and then we're usually selling at 50 off it's the only time you buy stuff and then by then we're
[56:52.120 --> 56:56.440]  making 20 30 percent that doesn't that doesn't pay for it and i'm not bitching i'm not complaining

[1:06:09.880 --> 1:06:18.760]  live from the front lines of the info war so in the military they have different names for it but
[1:06:18.760 --> 1:06:25.720]  attack plan attack profile target list and then you'll have your main target list but if something
[1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:30.440]  comes up you'll have a secondary target list let's say they got a bunch of sand missiles shooting
[1:06:30.440 --> 1:06:35.240]  at you and you get told to pull off a certain primary target on your way back out of the country
[1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:41.880]  you'll have a secondary target and uh if that's approachable you go ahead and hit that when you
[1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:46.760]  study globalism you can figure out real quick without reading their white papers and textbooks
[1:06:46.760 --> 1:06:51.560]  and battle plans that are public that it's a post human world they want to get rid of us
[1:06:51.560 --> 1:06:55.960]  they want to collapse civilization they want to collapse the christian renaissance the enlightenment
[1:06:55.960 --> 1:07:00.440]  because they don't want to empower humanity they don't want to power humanity working together
[1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:05.320]  the globalists want to dominate and control the future so they want to deindustrialize the west
[1:07:05.320 --> 1:07:11.400]  they want to get rid of god they want to break up the family and they want to bring in the the most
[1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:17.960]  uneducated most violent most aggressive most unwashed people from the middle east africa and
[1:07:17.960 --> 1:07:24.680]  latin america they put the very worst in refugee camps criminals people with diseases mental illness
[1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:33.320]  this is admitted and then they are trans shipped by ship or plane or land bridge into europe into
[1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:40.040]  the united states and are then indoctrinated with anti-white anti-america communism and that's
[1:07:40.040 --> 1:07:46.760]  that's official they're giving thousand dollar debit cards per leg it's all come out dan lineman
[1:07:46.760 --> 1:07:52.680]  lives in europe he's a great reporter for europe wars dot com you see his articles posted info

[1:08:02.840 --> 1:08:08.520]  it's vital however you can to get it out so i wanted to get dan on because there's such a
[1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:17.320]  sterling example right now with erdogan the dictator of turkey holding europe hostage is saying let me
[1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:25.880]  take control of syria large parts of it which is not his land they'll start a new war or i'm
[1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:30.840]  going to invade europe with five million refugees to begin well he's already flooded europe he said
[1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:34.600]  last year let me have a europe party where there's an islamic bloc in every country
[1:08:34.600 --> 1:08:40.520]  and they'll control the parliamentary process or i'll flood you more europe said no he flooded
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:46.280]  more well greece's prime minister rejects turkey's refugee threats urges talks remember
[1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:52.440]  the ottoman empire for a while occupied greece turkey threatens to flood europe with migrants
[1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:58.920]  dan lineman article greece turkey continues to provoke over cyprus so this is what's going on
[1:08:58.920 --> 1:09:05.240]  and it's the same way we're held hostage and the un's involved with erdogan doing all this this
[1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:14.200]  is 21st century fifth and sixth generational warfare and it's happening all over the world
[1:09:14.760 --> 1:09:19.960]  china is using communist to take over taiwan and hong kong forcibly bringing him in as
[1:09:19.960 --> 1:09:25.880]  illegal aliens same things happening here so it's not the skin color issue it's the ideology
[1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:31.160]  and the programming and the testing they do in these camps for up to a year usually it's four
[1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:36.440]  to six months making sure they've got the right type of scum to hit us with dan lineman thanks
[1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:41.720]  for joining us to give us this critical report i know you've been on the ground france greece italy
[1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:47.400]  where are you now i'm currently on the island of malta actually just arrived here last night
[1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:53.880]  malta is obviously on the front lines here of the migration crisis and the med often the
[1:09:53.880 --> 1:09:59.160]  malta's government will have to get involved and take in migrants that have been on ngo boats out at
[1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:03.720]  sea for a while and they'll take them in here and then they'll be transported to the mainland and
[1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:08.200]  redistributed between different countries depending on the agreements depending on the ship so
[1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:12.760]  that's where i am right now i have been as you said all around europe in the past couple of months
[1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:17.560]  been staying towards the eastern part of europe where things are a lot quieter a lot safer and
[1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:24.600]  there is definitely a definitive difference in the climate in these countries between poland and
[1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:32.280]  vulgaria montenegro and then also in contrast with places like germany france portugal the
[1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:39.560]  uk so uh yeah it's been a very interesting journey thus far you heard my breakdown of what's
[1:10:39.560 --> 1:10:44.200]  happening i mean the u n admits that's the plan um peter southerland admitted that was the plan
[1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:50.840]  obviously eastern europe is fully awake right now and engaged why are they so awake but western
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:56.360]  europe sooner with their thumb up there are in well the one of the leading speculations about
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:01.880]  that is of course that they lived under the the communist root reign for so long and they weren't
[1:11:01.880 --> 1:11:07.080]  necessarily exposed to the same types of propaganda that western europe has been exposed to but i'll
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:12.120]  tell you it is such a night and day difference i've spent about a month in poland recently uh
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:17.400]  and all over their different cities and the feeling of security in general and seeing this
[1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:23.000]  this country particularly poland where i just got to see vice president pens deliver an address in
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:29.720]  warsaw the feeling there of security and a general uh an upswing an uptick in the quality of life
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:34.760]  there seeing these cities are thriving they are coming together there's a lot of a lot of youthful
[1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:39.880]  intelligent people in these countries and you can tell prosperity is just on the up and up in
[1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:46.440]  poland in particular and they're not wasting money supporting unbelievable millions of migrants
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:51.480]  across the rest of europe their neighbors in germany have taken in uh upwards of two million
[1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:56.120]  migrants just in the past few years and you can see the effects in the german cities the way that
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:00.360]  things are on the decline there that i was about to say we've also seen it next to this of germans
[1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:07.240]  swedes french and others to poland and even russia because things are just unlevel now
[1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:13.240]  absolutely there is a huge communities of of germans gathering even in hungary as well
[1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:18.520]  they just had enough and they're being taxed to the hilt to support the destruction of their own
[1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:25.000]  company countries and the same is playing out now again in greece which we are about to talk about
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:30.280]  and you did mention the the numbers of migrants flooding into greece again are staggering and
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:36.120]  there are concerns that the new waves if they continue on this trajectory could be worse than
[1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:46.280]  2015 dan how would you describe the u and plans public to break down all nations to to create
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:52.280]  just a giant poor population with the ultra rich city states that are exempt from their own taxes
[1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:56.520]  they put on us i mean that's the globalist neo feudalistic plan they call a technocracy
[1:12:57.560 --> 1:13:02.760]  so a merger of old feudalism with you know high tech slavery but how is their plan going i mean a
[1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:06.600]  lot of populists are getting elected a lot of resistance around the world a lot of people
[1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:13.480]  getting pissed off but is it too little too late it's an interesting question because i think
[1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:17.640]  we are obviously in an unprecedented time i was speaking about this with oh and the other night
[1:13:17.640 --> 1:13:21.800]  he asked for kind of my predictions and my assessment and it's so hard to give because
[1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:26.360]  there is no precedent for what's going on right now and like you said there have been a lot of
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:31.720]  populists elected there has been a lot of momentum from from the basically from the the grassroots
[1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:37.560]  however the globalists are having quite a time of fending these these insurgent populist
[1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:43.080]  nationalists off as you see salvini has been dethroned i assume that he will rise back to power
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:47.560]  in some way in the future if they don't find a way to do away with him permanently but the way
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:53.320]  that they're treating populists and nationalists across the world just with threats of investigations
[1:13:53.320 --> 1:13:58.600]  you have an investigation of the danish immigration minister she is kind of a leftist but she's
[1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:03.320]  just been really hardline on immigration and now she's moving into a new position and they they're
[1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:07.720]  threatening to investigate her for what she's done by preventing us not to say even bernie sanders
[1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:12.200]  and ron emmanuel have to admit you bring in tens of millions of people with who don't have any
[1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:17.400]  skills you'll collapse the country so socialists that actually want to get their pensions are
[1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:21.160]  really speaking out but as you said they got a nationalist elected nidalee he said you're not
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:25.720]  going to bring 10 000 people a week in here from north africa he had the italian navy stop it so
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:31.320]  soros had him removed from office recently to start refletting italy but i saw that italy
[1:14:31.320 --> 1:14:36.120]  wasn't sure they were going to open back up again where is that currently i think that they are
[1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:41.000]  going to i never trusted the the alliance with the five star movement they did not seem to be on
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:46.760]  the same page with salvini and lega they just seem like they were doing giving lip service to get
[1:14:46.760 --> 1:14:52.440]  into power it sounds like conti will will bring the government back in line with the e u agenda
[1:14:52.440 --> 1:14:57.480]  and also you see in these other countries obviously with the brexit situation it sounds
[1:14:57.480 --> 1:15:01.320]  like that they're gonna they're doing everything they can to make sure that that doesn't go through
[1:15:01.960 --> 1:15:09.160]  we have in in france somehow macron is holding on after 44 weeks of yellow vest protest we have
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:14.840]  merkel doing okay in germany she's hanging in there and she's ready to pass the baton to her
[1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:21.080]  underling and the green power rising the green party i'm sorry rising to power there so for all
[1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:26.280]  the surge and the the the things that the nationalist populace are doing well in europe
[1:15:26.280 --> 1:15:31.000]  there is an incredible amount of subversion to ensure that they don't that's right massive pushback
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:35.640]  but at least people aren't in a coma right now and that's just the beginning but bottom line folks
[1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:40.600]  with trump and other populace in the fight just got started people need to understand this is a
[1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:46.440]  very grave time right now for the planet and after the globals exploded the third world they're now
[1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:51.160]  using the third world to bring down the last it's all planned it's all admitted but knowing is half

[1:20:48.840 --> 1:20:53.720]  ago about soros issuing debit cards with us taxpayer money to millions of people to invade
[1:20:53.720 --> 1:20:59.240]  europe now it's here they denied it first now it's admitted same thing they're funding people
[1:20:59.240 --> 1:21:09.400]  with three thousand dollar cards to fly out of africa to Guatemala or mexico and then come to texas
[1:21:09.400 --> 1:21:15.640]  and they're not even screened for Ebola and leprosy is now spreading in los angeles and typhus
[1:21:16.760 --> 1:21:19.400]  this is how you collapse the country this is the admitted plan
[1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:28.920]  but before we look at what's happening in greece with dan lineman i want to get us take on
[1:21:30.120 --> 1:21:35.720]  quote migrants people invading south africa south africa's communist run a and c they put the zulus
[1:21:35.720 --> 1:21:41.320]  in their own little concentration camp now zulu land people don't know that you know this massive
[1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:45.880]  black on black murder going on they're celebrating robert mcgabi and zimbabwe that killed hundreds
[1:21:45.880 --> 1:21:50.200]  of thousands of people many of white drove them all out of the country the country collapsed
[1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:55.240]  he's dead ap said he was a hero new york times said that mal was a hero yesterday
[1:21:57.080 --> 1:22:03.000]  and people are being burned to death by the hundreds and killed and stoned by other blacks
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:07.560]  because they're migrants and then we think we're going to bring a bunch of people in from africa
[1:22:08.440 --> 1:22:11.320]  who have not gone through any vetting and that this isn't going to happen here
[1:22:12.520 --> 1:22:16.760]  this is incredible so here's here's one of the south africans saying kill white people
[1:22:16.760 --> 1:22:21.160]  well don't worry most whites have left south africa it's collapsing it's just so racist but we
[1:22:21.160 --> 1:22:27.240]  project on the people that aren't white that they're better than us when in many cases they're
[1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:31.640]  more barbarous than we ever were and i don't hate these people it just the fact is is that we need
[1:22:31.640 --> 1:22:36.760]  to stop hating the west so let's go ahead and play pro protesters solution of black on black
[1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:40.520]  violence on africa kill whites instead sounds like the leader of the new black panther party in
[1:22:40.520 --> 1:22:50.200]  houston here it is talk about this most stop xenophobia most stop if you want to do xenophobia
[1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:57.320]  okay right start to kill white people start to kill chinese people start to kill ancient people
[1:22:57.320 --> 1:23:07.640]  don't kill your brother don't kill your brother we have seven colors we have seven colors so why
[1:23:07.640 --> 1:23:15.160]  you will kill your fellow brother why you will why you will call you every commenter is just saying
[1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:22.680]  absolutely immediately let's kill those white people and the un hollywood the globalists know
[1:23:22.680 --> 1:23:28.040]  exactly what they're doing down lineman absolutely uh you know what's shocking is
[1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:34.360]  they the the line that we're fed is that these people are all fleeing from these horrible ravaged
[1:23:34.360 --> 1:23:38.760]  countries in many cases they're they're not really all that bad apparently people in
[1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:43.080]  netherlands and belgium are supposed to take in hundreds of thousands of morocans for whatever
[1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:47.320]  reason that's things are pretty decent in morocco however there are some countries where things are
[1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:51.160]  pretty bad and where they are pretty destabilized does that mean that we need to take them in
[1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:55.480]  to our own countries no probably better to help them things get get things sorted in their own
[1:23:55.480 --> 1:24:00.840]  country now south africa until very recently was one of the most stable and prosperous countries
[1:24:00.840 --> 1:24:06.520]  of course in africa and uh you know worldwide i would say and at this point south africa is
[1:24:06.520 --> 1:24:11.720]  destabilizing so rapidly and they're going after their neighbors they're they're causing all these
[1:24:11.720 --> 1:24:16.840]  issues with obviously with nigerians now what happens when south africa destabilizes and many
[1:24:16.840 --> 1:24:23.400]  people start fleeing from there and coming north to to europe and then also we just have the situation
[1:24:23.400 --> 1:24:28.440]  in africa in general is always so tenuous so when we see one of the best countries there
[1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:32.680]  is basically burning to the ground at this point what do we see for the future of the west in
[1:24:32.680 --> 1:24:37.000]  particular europe when all of these people are going to want to get out of the hellholes that
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.840]  they live in and get somewhere better and we're just seeing just the beginning this is just the
[1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:46.760]  tip of the iceberg 2015 was nothing compared to what's coming down the line we have the footage
[1:24:46.760 --> 1:24:53.960]  of thousands of people from the congo being brought into san Antonio and and then the camera people
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:58.920]  trying to attack our camera people for even showing it you you dirty americans you don't show what's
[1:24:58.920 --> 1:25:04.360]  going on this is crazy if we tried to move to congo dan they'd kill us and all i'm saying is we're
[1:25:04.360 --> 1:25:11.240]  bringing people in that are totally tribal and kill people who aren't in their tribe period right
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:16.280]  and that's the nature of people in general sad to say you know i spent some time in slovenia recently
[1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:20.600]  and i stayed right on the coast you could see croatia their coast right across the water and
[1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:25.720]  i was told by my slovenian and Croatian hosts they were immigrants from Croatia that there are
[1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:30.120]  still tensions between slovenians and Croatians these are people who speak essentially the same
[1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:34.120]  language they live side by side they look the same you would never know if they're any different
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:39.560]  and even they have tensions so for us to think that we're going to bring in millions upon millions
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:46.120]  or in the case of what Emmanuel Macron has talked about up to 250 million of these people into europe
[1:25:46.120 --> 1:25:50.600]  and think that things are going to be just fine that's just madness and anyone who does believe
[1:25:50.600 --> 1:25:58.280]  in that is crazy well he said he said france's future is african okay well there's feces everywhere
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:03.800]  and homeless people and trees falling down in front of cars to rob them and what tourism is down 80
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:11.160]  percent i mean why the hell would they be doing this right tourism is down heavily in in cities
[1:26:11.160 --> 1:26:16.280]  like paris uh stock home london and tourism is up in other countries where things are much safer
[1:26:16.280 --> 1:26:21.400]  and where there aren't that many migrants cities like dubrovnik kroatia split kroatia uh krakow
[1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:25.960]  poland these places are everyone i know isn't going to western europe now they're going to eastern
[1:26:25.960 --> 1:26:30.920]  europe absolutely the cities are more beautiful they're cleaner they're safer and there aren't
[1:26:30.920 --> 1:26:35.960]  migrants running around i would never recommend to anyone to go to the staple cities anymore
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:41.080]  roam paris london i was talking to a bunch of quote operators and people who do international
[1:26:41.080 --> 1:26:46.360]  security and they said they when they go to france and stuff are told and and they wouldn't check
[1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:51.320]  it's true it's more dangerous than bagdad they can't even go 200 yards out of the hotel in any
[1:26:51.320 --> 1:26:57.640]  direction it's gone right yeah you know a few years ago i was in i was in france i would say
[1:26:57.640 --> 1:27:03.960]  about six seven years ago i did not know the situation in paris i was very unaware of what
[1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:09.320]  was going on there and i ended up in basically a no-go zone walking through that with my wife and
[1:27:09.320 --> 1:27:14.280]  we were we couldn't believe what was going on we felt like we had landed uh in africa or the
[1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:20.440]  middle east and we felt very unsafe um there was very little english anywhere or french i should say
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:23.880]  being spoken now you can find english anywhere in europe come back in a few more minutes and robert
[1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:28.920]  barnes is with us but we could pull up hours of footage in italy and france in england where you
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:35.720]  go in these no-go zones that are in half of cities now in some cases and mainline cameras get attacked
[1:27:35.720 --> 1:27:42.520]  at bus stations women get attacked i mean the raping the murder the death all of this is just
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:49.880]  exploding and the media tries to cover it up it's insane absolutely so yeah back to that point
[1:27:49.880 --> 1:27:56.200]  about south africa and africa in general i think that the situation there is dire and the only
[1:27:56.200 --> 1:28:02.040]  answer in in my mind is that for europe needs to fortify itself obviously that's not happening
[1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:07.400]  but they need to be prepared for these these countries to continue uh destabilizing and for
[1:28:07.400 --> 1:28:12.920]  migrants to continue pouring towards europe and looking to uh to find the better life quote
[1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:17.640]  unquote there which if they continue uh there will no be be no better life in europe there are

[1:34:58.520 --> 1:35:06.440]  prosecute people for undercover video with stuff that's illegal so this is really coming out now
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:12.680]  and drubsreport.com is linked to stuff that i'm not going to get to till next segment but
[1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:19.320]  they've got they had testimony yesterday on the born alive bill where they're trying to
[1:35:19.320 --> 1:35:25.560]  pass a law to don't kill already born babies and people are now testifying to congress with the
[1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:30.680]  evidence with the photos and the video of where they kill the babies after they're born so it's
[1:35:30.680 --> 1:35:35.160]  all coming out this is a big deal next segment with robert barnes will hit some other issues
[1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:39.160]  when dan lineman leaves us here in a moment i don't get your take on the un and the open borders and
[1:35:39.160 --> 1:35:44.360]  and the collapse of latin america the collapse of africa latin america is freaking out as hundreds
[1:35:44.360 --> 1:35:48.600]  of thousands of africans are showing up a month now to be millions the un's funding these conduits
[1:35:48.600 --> 1:35:54.520]  to open up the dan lineman of europe wars dot com uh looking at at greece because this is really
[1:35:54.520 --> 1:35:59.000]  come to a head there describe for people what the dictator of turkey's threatening right now
[1:36:02.760 --> 1:36:09.000]  in 2015 2016 this whole migrant crisis at that time the the greece was basically part
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:13.480]  of the pathway into europe a lot of them would generally pass through passing through the Balkans
[1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:19.720]  as well they were coming by boats from turkey obviously coming up through syria and then
[1:36:19.720 --> 1:36:25.720]  then agreements were reached after that where basically turkey holds millions upon millions
[1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:31.080]  of migrants inside its borders in exchange for huge payoffs and it's constantly demanding more
[1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:35.640]  money for different projects and different ways and say and every time that they don't get what they
[1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:39.720]  want erdogan will say oh well you better give it to me or i might have to open the floodgates well
[1:36:39.720 --> 1:36:44.600]  now he's threatening to do it again as you had mentioned earlier people see the plan that he has
[1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:50.120]  devised basically he says he says he wants to set up a safe zone inside syria that will be managed
[1:36:50.120 --> 1:36:55.640]  by turkey and the us and he wants more money for that from the e u and if they don't give it to him
[1:36:56.520 --> 1:37:02.440]  he's he's threatening up to 5.5 million migrants he said could could just be released into europe
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:07.080]  he says 3.6 that they're holding there already and he believes another 2 million would come up
[1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:11.800]  through syria now what's happening already is there are cracks in the dam already showing
[1:37:11.800 --> 1:37:17.720]  migrants are piling onto greek islands again in a way that officials are concerned mirrors or
[1:37:17.720 --> 1:37:25.720]  looks worse than the 2015 2016 situation in lesbos and they've had something like 12 000 migrants
[1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:31.560]  and the surrounding islands there have had 12 000 migrants land in july and august alone
[1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:36.840]  and last week something like 600 arrived in the span of a couple hours there were 13 boats
[1:37:36.840 --> 1:37:42.600]  that landed in the matter of 35 minutes on the island of lesbos so things are reaching a crescendo
[1:37:42.600 --> 1:37:48.440]  there as well cypress is also experiencing a surge of migrants that they say is the highest per
[1:37:48.440 --> 1:37:55.080]  capita in europe now based on cypress's population and so the migrants are already leaving turkey and
[1:37:55.080 --> 1:38:01.080]  more and more and it looks like either either erdogan is letting off the the the iron grip on them
[1:38:01.720 --> 1:38:06.040]  keeping them in the country or they're just being over overwhelmed at this point by these
[1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:10.440]  migrants that have been living in turkey for for years now and they're probably getting frustrated
[1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:14.040]  and just saying hey we're going to make our way over so they're coming over on boats with
[1:38:14.040 --> 1:38:19.720]  people smugglers assistance and in some cases it has been reported that on the islands in
[1:38:19.720 --> 1:38:24.520]  greece they're being received by ngo workers so it looks like a coordinated operation if you ask for
[1:38:24.520 --> 1:38:31.720]  my humble opinion well they know exactly what they're doing and anytime reporters try to show any of
[1:38:31.720 --> 1:38:37.640]  this there's just hundreds of hours of it uh in italy and in greece and in and in roam that that
[1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:42.760]  they come and beat people up and and if anybody's white uh they get beaten up as well anybody can
[1:38:42.760 --> 1:38:47.960]  pull up uh you know tommy robinson in nogo zone in roam and other areas people punching him and
[1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:52.280]  him having to fight back and then you've got uh rappers that get physically attacked they fight
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:56.680]  back they get indicted in sweden it seems like the big no no is standing up and saying none of these
[1:38:56.680 --> 1:39:04.760]  guys right well if you recall uh with um the um covington uh his name is escaping me but what he
[1:39:04.760 --> 1:39:09.480]  was asked by mainstream media he was interviewed and she said uh you know you stood up for yourself
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:13.640]  don't you think that that's a bit aggressive you stood your ground so i think that that's that's
[1:39:13.640 --> 1:39:17.800]  really we should what we should take away from that is that you're not allowed to stand your ground
[1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:23.400]  in the face of an attack by anyone that is endorsed by the globalists and if you do you will pay the
[1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:27.560]  price and i think that that's the message that's been sent from every everyone from the covington
[1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:31.480]  kids to mateo selvini to donald trump you're not allowed to stand your ground you're not allowed
[1:39:31.480 --> 1:39:35.320]  to defend yourself you're not allowed to defend your countries or western values or western
[1:39:35.320 --> 1:39:39.960]  civilization otherwise we will come for you and we will prosecute you and you will pay the price
[1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:47.000]  you know member just a few years ago they would try to deny that uh there were these no-go zones
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:54.040]  they don't deny it now no they don't uh i think that the the evidence is out there and they realize
[1:39:54.040 --> 1:39:59.480]  that they'll call them hot spots or they'll call them sensitive security zones uh they have them all
[1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:03.480]  over europe of course and they have them in the united states as well uh you know there are parts of
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:08.440]  our cities now which are not which are very hostile of course to police and to outsiders so
[1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:13.480]  we are watching the unraveling of western civilization uh in real time and it's it's pretty
[1:40:13.480 --> 1:40:19.080]  scary and with the amount of people that are pouring into our countries from hostile nations and from
[1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:23.880]  nations like south africa where they can't even stand being around other africans uh things do not
[1:40:23.880 --> 1:40:28.840]  bode well for the future if something doesn't happen soon and of course rt had to get a leaked
[1:40:28.840 --> 1:40:32.760]  report because it's secret government reports on the expanding no-go zones that cover half the
[1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:36.200]  country i mean that's what's even more incredible is is that the governments are trying to keep it
[1:40:36.200 --> 1:40:42.040]  secret absolutely that's one of the hardest things about reporting on the situation here in europe is
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:47.080]  that the information is throttled it's choked it's very hard to dig up and then sometimes when you
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:51.800]  find some some relevant information you do have to question the sources because it's of course it's
[1:40:51.800 --> 1:40:58.600]  not coming from a reliable reputable source but but uh increasingly um there is more information
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:03.320]  coming out social media is a great place of course to just keep an eye on the videos and and the
[1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:07.080]  situation that's unfolding but you cannot trust anything that's coming out in the mainstream
[1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:11.960]  media you can't can't trust their figures you can't trust the what the the details because they're
[1:41:11.960 --> 1:41:16.040]  constantly covering up details you can't even trust the police at this point because they are
[1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:21.160]  ordered to not release the details in many cases about crimes that are committed by migrants
[1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:25.960]  about the statistics so at this point it's everyone's job to just spread the information
[1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:31.480]  that you reliably have use social media spread it to your families you know try to red pill your
[1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:35.080]  families on what's going on because a lot of them are still paying attention to the mainstream
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:40.600]  media they really have no idea so it's everyone's responsibility to do journalism on their own and
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:45.320]  just be independent journalists and spread reliable information so that people get an accurate picture
[1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:50.120]  of what is happening to our countries that's right and remember the traders that try to cover all
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:55.480]  this up europewars.com with the latest videos articles everybody please share that the only
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:41:59.880]  way we get through the sensors is when you take action big tech thinks you're dumb they think

[1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:31.880]  other side ladies and gentlemen and that is 60 plus million abortions in this country and the
[1:42:31.880 --> 1:42:36.920]  giant industry of keeping babies alive so they can later harvest their organs to get a higher price
[1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:41.960]  no one's just chop them all up on the spot or keep them alive until it's fresh so you don't get
[1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:47.560]  rejection so you get all the money we're going to talk about the real horror that rivals with the
[1:42:47.560 --> 1:42:51.960]  nazis did on the other side and how do we bring these criminals to justice robert barnes he knows
[1:42:51.960 --> 1:42:58.760]  all about it he's a constitutional lawyer stay with us i was among the first 12 years ago to
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:04.920]  warn that jeffrey ebbstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia
[1:43:04.920 --> 1:43:11.320]  i was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting i was the first to begin to
[1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:17.240]  warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested i was
[1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:22.920]  the first to warn you along with paul watson and info wars dot com 15 years ago that google was
[1:43:22.920 --> 1:43:28.040]  using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds and hundreds
[1:43:28.040 --> 1:43:34.520]  of other giant issues like the federal reserve being private run for profit trying to control our
[1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:39.480]  economy that our government in hollywood have been taken over by the communist chinese on every

[1:51:19.320 --> 1:51:24.200]  visiting right now we're filing some lawsuits that we're going to announce tomorrow uh again just
[1:51:24.200 --> 1:51:29.400]  to defend ourselves that's how serious this fight is on the front lines but i asked you i said what
[1:51:29.400 --> 1:51:35.000]  do you want to get into out of all this news you said alex i want to get into keeping babies alive
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:41.080]  and harvesting their organs and the fact that uh this is really going on because you practice law
[1:51:41.080 --> 1:51:46.600]  predominantly uh in california that's where you're mainly licensed out of it and you're aware of these
[1:51:46.600 --> 1:51:51.160]  famous cases so break this down for people sure so i mean what's amazing is this all started with
[1:51:51.160 --> 1:51:58.760]  an undercover video expose sort of in the veritas model uh which two independent investigative
[1:51:58.760 --> 1:52:03.720]  reporters did the kind of undercover reporting that has been the foundation of independent
[1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:08.760]  investigative free press from the inception of the country and they were able to document over
[1:52:08.760 --> 1:52:14.360]  multiple years of undercover reporting and investigation that plan parenthood and other
[1:52:14.360 --> 1:52:21.160]  abortion providers were in business with various third party vendors to provide baby parts from
[1:52:21.160 --> 1:52:26.360]  those abortions to those into to those other institutions and entities for the purpose
[1:52:26.360 --> 1:52:31.080]  for the purposes of corporate profit and this included potentially selling baby heads selling
[1:52:31.080 --> 1:52:37.560]  baby hearts and in in selling them in such a way that suggested that they were often uh developed
[1:52:37.560 --> 1:52:42.360]  post-abortion and so they did did all of this discovery revealed it and the first reaction
[1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:48.200]  was a twofold reaction from the political establishment in uh california one was this
[1:52:48.200 --> 1:52:53.640]  novel interpretation of criminal law in california for the first time i know of in which they attempted
[1:52:53.640 --> 1:53:00.040]  to criminalize undercover investigative reporting simply because they didn't like this the content
[1:53:00.040 --> 1:53:05.400]  the subject of the reporting so these individuals have been subject to all kinds of lawsuits
[1:53:05.400 --> 1:53:09.800]  been subject to all kinds of criminal investigations and are now subject to an ongoing criminal
[1:53:09.800 --> 1:53:15.160]  investigative proceeding in san francisco the second part that i tracked which was fascinating
[1:53:15.160 --> 1:53:19.880]  was there was this huge counter narrative establishment media pitch that all of these
[1:53:19.880 --> 1:53:26.440]  stories were faked that just like the attack project veritas that this was edited and doctored video
[1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:31.400]  and that none of it was none of it was true plan parenthood wasn't involved in anything like this
[1:53:31.400 --> 1:53:36.200]  none of the abortion providers were involved in anything like this there was nobody buying uh
[1:53:36.200 --> 1:53:41.400]  baby parts there was nobody selling baby part didn't exist so to such a degree that about six
[1:53:41.400 --> 1:53:46.120]  months after it happened friends of mine and family members that are on the left uh insisted this to
[1:53:46.120 --> 1:53:51.320]  me right away like oh that's a totally fake story and this started in 2015 exactly and then they
[1:53:51.320 --> 1:53:57.800]  indicted the men who just interviewed the the uh abortion head at a restaurant with hidden cameras
[1:53:57.800 --> 1:54:01.480]  they indicted them for that that's not illegal oh exactly what's extraordinary what's amazing
[1:54:01.480 --> 1:54:05.560]  is what happened between that six month period in these indictments they were so successful
[1:54:05.560 --> 1:54:09.960]  of building a counter narrative that what was quietly being reported not reported on was orange
[1:54:09.960 --> 1:54:14.120]  county prosecutor i was tracking it there were civil agreements and criminal prosecution
[1:54:14.120 --> 1:54:18.200]  agreements where this was being admitted by abortion providers being admitted by these
[1:54:18.200 --> 1:54:23.080]  service providers that they were purchasing in fact were purchasing confirming every aspect
[1:54:23.080 --> 1:54:27.720]  of the undercover reporting they were in fact selling and that's why i want you to continue
[1:54:27.720 --> 1:54:31.880]  but that's why all these states are passing laws to kill babies after they're born
[1:54:31.880 --> 1:54:37.160]  is to cover what was already happening right because it's big business and that's why they're
[1:54:37.160 --> 1:54:41.160]  trying to pass a law saying born alive bill and people like wait you got it and they wouldn't
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:46.360]  even pass it the last time earlier this year exactly what they didn't realize was that in
[1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:52.840]  california uh and in all states what was happening is standard customary industry practice by a
[1:54:52.840 --> 1:55:00.360]  various abortion providers and companies connected to abortion is a is usually a felony it was against
[1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:04.280]  the law they that's why they were saying oh this couldn't be happening they didn't realize the
[1:55:04.280 --> 1:55:08.600]  consequence of it they were so used to doing it and getting away with it that they didn't even
[1:55:08.600 --> 1:55:12.040]  understand it and so i followed the orange county case i found out followed other cases
[1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:16.520]  where they were being prosecuted for violating the law and the media totally suppressed these
[1:55:16.520 --> 1:55:21.960]  cases totally suppressed notice of them knowledge of them awareness of them each of them confirming
[1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:26.360]  what these guys did and that's why san francisco went further to try to criminally prosecute them
[1:55:26.360 --> 1:55:31.880]  to try to build up a fake news narrative that says this never happened this doesn't exist their big
[1:55:31.880 --> 1:55:35.960]  mistake was they have very good counsel in san francisco and they're putting people like the
[1:55:35.960 --> 1:55:40.840]  stem express ceo on the stand and they're now admitting no we sell babies with beating hearts
[1:55:40.840 --> 1:55:44.360]  exactly they have to because one they have them on videotape they're getting to confirm two great
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:48.440]  things one they're confirming that their older investigative reporting was true because now
[1:55:48.440 --> 1:55:52.680]  they're under oath and they're subject to perjury prosecution if they don't admit it secondly they
[1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:57.640]  try to be evasive on the stand so it shows the value and the virtue of the undercover reporting
[1:55:57.640 --> 1:56:01.560]  it shows look when these people are undercover they're much more honest and forthcoming than
[1:56:01.560 --> 1:56:05.800]  when it when they're actually on the stand under penalty of perjury under oath where they try to
[1:56:05.800 --> 1:56:09.720]  evade dodge and circumvent the answer and your real skill is predicting what comes next i've
[1:56:09.720 --> 1:56:13.160]  seen you do it over and over again it seems like they're not going to be able to cover this up
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:17.640]  and passing laws legalizing killing already born babies ain't going to cut it and now that they're
[1:56:17.640 --> 1:56:22.760]  prosecuting people and it's coming out in court it seems like they've walked into a trap they absolutely
[1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:26.760]  did they they underestimate they believed their own nonsense i think the prosecutors are brought
[1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:30.760]  this case weren't following what was happening in orange county wasn't following what was really
[1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:34.600]  happening and they convinced themselves that this didn't really exist they convinced themselves of
[1:56:34.600 --> 1:56:38.200]  the fake news narrative and they figured they could run with the fake news narrative with an actual
[1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:42.360]  criminal trial the problem with that is you get to cross examine in a criminal trial so you don't
[1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:46.360]  get to get away with this so this was a major mistake because now you have people admitting
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:51.400]  under oath that the whole story was true and the moral horror of what they're doing because this
[1:56:51.400 --> 1:56:56.040]  shocks the conscience of even people many people on the left and now they're having hearings in
[1:56:56.040 --> 1:57:00.040]  congress you don't see this on the news the videos on info wars dot com credit report dot com's link
[1:57:00.040 --> 1:57:05.320]  to a story on it congress is having hearings with nurses that headed departments admitting all this
[1:57:05.320 --> 1:57:11.640]  and there's a blackout that that's the media complicit in killing born babies for their organs
[1:57:11.640 --> 1:57:17.880]  that is joseph mingle a level there's a reason why the governor of virginia did what he did instead
[1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:21.800]  of what he said back when he said because he's considered this normal industry standard practice
[1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:26.120]  he didn't realize what he was revealing to the world was the moral shock and horror of what
[1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:29.960]  they've really been up to it's the recreation of an elite culture and elite but it's okay they
[1:57:29.960 --> 1:57:33.960]  call it a comfort room where they kill him exactly it's recreation of human sacrifice
[1:57:33.960 --> 1:57:38.680]  traditions from pre christian societies that's what we have christianity helped abolish that human
[1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:42.280]  sacrifice and now it's all back we got unbelievable we'll be right back with a third hour you don't

[2:00:17.720 --> 2:00:22.200]  time to get into the underbelly of 9-11 i never really asked robert barnes his take on it we'll
[2:00:22.200 --> 2:00:29.080]  get his view on that as well and we have zack vorhees the big google whistleblower he said
[2:00:29.080 --> 2:00:32.200]  he was going to write an article about the clinton body count and he did and then google
[2:00:33.400 --> 2:00:37.240]  stopped fixing it and you put it back to where it's supposed to be actually showing
[2:00:37.240 --> 2:00:40.600]  all the articles about the mysterious deaths so we're going to be breaking down some of the
[2:00:40.600 --> 2:00:46.040]  latest secrets on that front but but getting back to keeping the babies alive i mean this was
[2:00:46.040 --> 2:00:51.400]  known 30 years ago that they were selling the body parts illegally and then now why not hey can we
[2:00:51.400 --> 2:00:56.760]  get some live body parts and hey can we get some organs and so we're talking about billions of
[2:00:56.760 --> 2:01:01.560]  dollars here in the u.s competing with china and you know the question you know of the governor
[2:01:01.560 --> 2:01:06.280]  northam like i said on joe rogan is why are we wasting seven pounds of me you know there's a lot
[2:01:06.280 --> 2:01:12.840]  of he's like keep baby alive and we decide to keep baby comfortable and so they're trying to hide
[2:01:12.840 --> 2:01:17.240]  this in plain view because they know they've been caught they're really panicking uh no doubt about
[2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:21.000]  it i mean i think because people are morally shocked by it and people generally forget there's two
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:26.760]  things that the press generally does not fully cover which is the scope and scale of human trafficking
[2:01:26.760 --> 2:01:31.640]  and the scope and which is revealed by the epstein case and the scope and scale of organ
[2:01:31.640 --> 2:01:36.280]  trafficking and they they talk about organ trafficking not just in the context of human
[2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:41.400]  beings who are kidnapped and and their organs removed against their will it's happening systematically
[2:01:41.400 --> 2:01:46.600]  and systemically as has been revealed in china as part of what the epic times was created because
[2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:51.800]  their group because of their religious beliefs were being targeted for illicit organ transfers
[2:01:52.520 --> 2:01:57.000]  but it's been happening in the abortion industry for a long time and that's what these guys spent
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  three years doing undercover mass scale investigations one of the most impressive undercover investigative
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:07.800]  reporting efforts made in the modern era documented and detailed what these people said
[2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:15.400]  on video and it was not in an edited or censored or controlled or mistakenly or misrepresented
[2:02:15.400 --> 2:02:20.840]  in any manner and then the media did a massive hit job on them to try to suppress the news of this
[2:02:20.840 --> 2:02:26.200]  story because it's so shocking to the contents of the ordinary american it's the rein it's the
[2:02:26.200 --> 2:02:31.480]  reinvention and recreation of an elite society that favors human sacrifice but in this case
[2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:36.520]  not only does human sacrifice but does it for monitor to monetize that human sacrifice for
[2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:41.640]  the purposes of profit of the people partaking in participating in it it's a moral shock and
[2:02:41.640 --> 2:02:47.000]  hoard almost any ordinary everyday individual i mean it's it's terrifying that we even have to
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:51.800]  have born alive bills to protect people who are born alive and it's even more shocking that there
[2:02:51.800 --> 2:02:56.600]  are legislatures like the new york legislature and others creating a legal out for for this kind
[2:02:56.600 --> 2:03:01.560]  of human trafficking that's occurring what was also documented in detailed in the testimony
[2:03:01.560 --> 2:03:06.680]  is that the kind of organs being harvested the condition in which they are harvested
[2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:13.400]  strongly suggest or infers from an evidentiary perspective that this is being done post birth
[2:03:13.400 --> 2:03:17.640]  that there is baby that let's be clear the babies aren't cut up they're not chopped up they haven't
[2:03:17.640 --> 2:03:21.720]  had their brains sucked out like you're supposed to under law the partial birth abortion so that the
[2:03:21.720 --> 2:03:27.720]  baby's dead before it leaves the vaginal canal and that's why we know that this is going on it's come
[2:03:27.720 --> 2:03:31.800]  out you hear the governor saying we keep them alive after make them comfortable and then the
[2:03:31.800 --> 2:03:36.280]  standard deals to put them in a pool of water that's a that's even abc news so i've talked i've had
[2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:40.360]  the nurses on i've seen the documentaries it's been going on forever well it's just now
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:47.400]  it goes further keeping them alive for the organs exactly and to give an example this is
[2:03:47.400 --> 2:03:52.440]  why third term abortions matter in the way they do because in order to harvest these kind of body
[2:03:52.440 --> 2:03:56.680]  parts in the way in the condition they want them in they need third term abortions this would be
[2:03:56.680 --> 2:04:01.560]  difficult to do in a first term abortion to get the they to get the economic benefit that they're
[2:04:01.560 --> 2:04:06.120]  seeking from and the profit they're seeking off of these baby parts now that's right the the
[2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:12.360]  the organs aren't really harvestable until the third trimester and then rich people you know
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:15.640]  they're kids in a car wreck or has holes in its heart or whatever you know you want a heart you
[2:04:15.640 --> 2:04:19.800]  want a liver i get it but but this isn't some child that died in another car wreck and then
[2:04:19.800 --> 2:04:25.480]  you're getting it's body parts changes are some poor woman went in they told her oh yeah you've
[2:04:25.480 --> 2:04:29.240]  got a problem with your baby it's the milk courts we're on it we'll save you we're gonna induce labor
[2:04:29.240 --> 2:04:34.040]  and then they get them and again throughout history we have a problem with medicine becoming a tyranny
[2:04:34.040 --> 2:04:38.520]  because it's a god complex uh you people can't question it it's a speciality we'll talk about
[2:04:38.520 --> 2:04:43.240]  that briefly and i'll get it at 9 11 with robert barns the economy and so many other big subjects

[2:05:54.040 --> 2:06:14.280]  you're probably the best known builder particularly of great buildings in the city
[2:06:14.280 --> 2:06:19.800]  there's a great deal of question about whether or not the damage and and the ultimate destruction
[2:06:19.800 --> 2:06:25.320]  of the buildings was caused by the airplanes by architectural defect or possibly by bombs or
[2:06:25.320 --> 2:06:29.320]  or aftershocks do you have any thoughts on that well it wasn't architectural defect you know the
[2:06:29.320 --> 2:06:33.000]  world trade center was always known as a very very strong building don't forget that took
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:36.440]  a big bomb in the basement now the basement is the most vulnerable place because that's your
[2:06:36.440 --> 2:06:42.600]  foundation and it withstood that and i got to see that area about three or four days after it
[2:06:42.600 --> 2:06:47.480]  took place because one of my structural engineers actually took me for a tour because he did the
[2:06:47.480 --> 2:06:52.680]  building and i said i can't believe it the building was standing solid and half of the columns were
[2:06:52.680 --> 2:06:57.960]  blown out i mean so this was an unbelievably powerful building uh if you know anything about
[2:06:57.960 --> 2:07:01.960]  structure it was one of the first buildings that was built from the outside the steel the reason
[2:07:01.960 --> 2:07:06.440]  the world trade center had such narrow windows is that in between all the windows you had the
[2:07:06.440 --> 2:07:10.360]  steel on the outside so you had the steel on the outside of the building that's why when i first
[2:07:10.360 --> 2:07:15.640]  looked and you had big heavy i-beams when i first looked at it i couldn't believe it because
[2:07:15.640 --> 2:07:20.840]  there was a hole in the steel and this is steel that was you remember the the width of the windows
[2:07:20.840 --> 2:07:24.760]  of the world trade center folks i think you you know if you remember up there they were quite
[2:07:24.760 --> 2:07:33.000]  narrow and in between was this heavy steel i said how could a plane even a plane even a 767 or 747
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:37.400]  or whatever it might have been how could it possibly go through the steel i happen to think
[2:07:37.400 --> 2:07:41.960]  that they had not only a plane but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously because i just
[2:07:41.960 --> 2:07:46.760]  can't imagine anything being able to go through that wall most buildings are built with the
[2:07:46.760 --> 2:07:51.400]  steel is on the inside around the elevator shaft this one was built from the outside which is the
[2:07:51.400 --> 2:07:57.240]  strongest structure you can have and it was almost just like a like a can of soup you know donal we
[2:07:57.240 --> 2:08:02.680]  were looking at pictures all morning long of that plane coming into building number two and when you
[2:08:02.680 --> 2:08:09.720]  see that uh approach the the far side and then all of a sudden within a matter of millisecond the
[2:08:09.720 --> 2:08:14.920]  explosion pops out the other side right i just think that there was a plane with more than just
[2:08:14.920 --> 2:08:20.600]  fuel i think obviously they were very big planes they were going very rapidly because i was also
[2:08:20.600 --> 2:08:26.120]  watching where the plane seemed to be not only going fast it seemed to be coming down into the
[2:08:26.120 --> 2:08:30.920]  building so it was getting the speed from going downhill so to speak it just seemed to me that
[2:08:31.480 --> 2:08:35.720]  to do that kind of destruction is even more than a big plane because you're talking about
[2:08:35.720 --> 2:08:40.360]  taking out steel the heaviest caliber steel that was used in the building these buildings were
[2:08:40.360 --> 2:08:48.600]  rock solid and uh you know it's just an amazing it's an amazing thing this country is different
[2:08:48.600 --> 2:08:53.560]  today and and it's going to be different than it ever was for many years to come
[2:08:54.440 --> 2:08:56.440]  very profound statement and very true
[2:08:56.440 --> 2:09:07.320]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[2:09:08.600 --> 2:09:16.600]  you keep saying you've got something for me something called love something you call love
[2:09:16.600 --> 2:09:23.640]  but confess you've been messing you've been a mess where you shouldn't have been a mess in
[2:09:23.640 --> 2:09:30.520]  them so 9-11 is a very complex issue and i have forgotten more about it than most people would
[2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:34.760]  ever know i made three or four films on it wrote a book on it interviewed all the experts
[2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:38.760]  interviewed the deputy head of emergency management who died a week after he was on the
[2:09:38.760 --> 2:09:42.680]  show he didn't die was put the witness protection programs with the neighbors said they saw him
[2:09:42.680 --> 2:09:47.640]  leave all the vans all their stuff government cars everywhere he was told get out we're blowing
[2:09:47.640 --> 2:09:51.320]  building seven up with bombs i've had the firefighters and police on who heard the tens
[2:09:51.320 --> 2:09:58.040]  they could count down to blow up building seven i have a bc bbc cnn all saying building seven has
[2:09:58.040 --> 2:10:03.960]  been collapsed before they even blew it up i'm not saying radical islam doesn't exist i'm not
[2:10:03.960 --> 2:10:07.560]  saying terrorist attack or sometimes i'm not saying that islam isn't one of the biggest threats
[2:10:07.560 --> 2:10:14.280]  i'm telling you the facts there was a stand down on 9-11 and the facts have come out on that and
[2:10:14.280 --> 2:10:19.480]  now you've got major universities i've got articles fires did not cause wtc building
[2:10:19.480 --> 2:10:25.560]  collapse you've got the firefighter union uh having press conferences a month ago with an
[2:10:25.560 --> 2:10:31.320]  architect and engineers from 9-11 truths they're union saying no bombs the building uh so so the
[2:10:31.320 --> 2:10:36.120]  cia by the way uh leased that building so and had all these key government records on the clintons
[2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:42.840]  the global issue name it 18 years later though the 27 pages we now know congress says says
[2:10:42.840 --> 2:10:48.680]  saudi arabia was involved it was ordered to stand down uh that uh flight 93 was shot down by a
[2:10:48.680 --> 2:10:53.160]  f-16 putting sidewinder missiles into it uh because it was going towards the capital
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:57.480]  i mean what really happened on 9-11 we don't know we just know we've been lied to
[2:10:58.120 --> 2:11:01.080]  and we know there's criminal elements in our government like robert moeller
[2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:05.880]  who took over the day after 9-11 and then covered the whole thing up there's lawsuits dealing with
[2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:11.240]  that you're a smart guy robert barnes constitutional lawyer but quite a historian too i'm impressed by
[2:11:11.240 --> 2:11:16.280]  you know more than i do on many subjects and i'm quite a novice historian i tell you a wide range
[2:11:16.280 --> 2:11:22.840]  of things uh kind of conflate some of it sometimes but 9-11 i mean it's what the hell's going on here
[2:11:22.840 --> 2:11:28.520]  i mean no doubt you have the 28 pages that uh 28 pages exactly the 28 pages that that showed up
[2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:32.680]  relating to saudi arabia's involvement what's interesting is where popular culture and parts
[2:11:32.680 --> 2:11:37.000]  of the establishment media occasionally allow the truth to sort of leak out that question
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:42.920]  the established narrative about 9-11 so you have shows like looming tower which go into detail about
[2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:48.760]  it suggested meetings between cia director tenet and saudi arabia high high level diplomats that
[2:11:48.760 --> 2:11:53.560]  shut down or effectively curtailed the scope of an investigation that could have precluded those
[2:11:53.560 --> 2:11:58.520]  people identified as terrorists from ever being in the country at all you had the various informants
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:05.000]  connected to the fbi in san diego fbi agents in both florida and minnesota reporting on
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  activities related to the individuals later identified as the terrorist and yet somehow no
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:14.920]  investigation was meaningfully conducted you have robert moeller's unusual and peculiar history
[2:12:14.920 --> 2:12:19.400]  throughout his entire tenure is both a in the department of justice and is in the fbi
[2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:23.480]  and as an assistant united states attorney in the northern districts california involved in a lot
[2:12:23.480 --> 2:12:30.360]  of questionable cases ranging from epstein to 9-11 two other aspects in between and he is the guy
[2:12:30.360 --> 2:12:36.040]  that immediately steps in as the fbi director immediately helps cover up the fbi's complicity
[2:12:36.040 --> 2:12:40.120]  and covering up and not listening to their to their draft this wasn't the ordinary everyday
[2:12:40.120 --> 2:12:45.160]  agent the everyday agent was covering the story the everyday agent was reporting what was happening
[2:12:45.160 --> 2:12:50.440]  the everyday agent was uncovering the terrorist coup plots that were taking place that were later
[2:12:50.440 --> 2:12:56.360]  connected to the terrorist involved here it was the seventh floor that was ignoring it that was
[2:12:56.360 --> 2:13:01.080]  hiding it that was masking it that was obstructing it that was impairing it that was interfering with
[2:13:01.080 --> 2:13:06.200]  it the lead investigator who was part of the good fbi group that was trying to get the people later
[2:13:06.200 --> 2:13:11.560]  identified as the terrorist identified of course as the head of security coins somehow coincidental
[2:13:11.560 --> 2:13:15.560]  john o'neill dies on 9 11 in the building i mean that's one of those extraordinary coincidences
[2:13:15.560 --> 2:13:19.880]  what i always say is you take the same storyline and you put it in with a country the media doesn't
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:25.000]  like so if you said you take the same if the head of security as part of an fsb group for
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:31.640]  putin mysteriously died after he was trying to uncover a potential terrorist coup plot every
[2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:34.760]  establishment media narrative the united states would would say putin and the government were
[2:13:34.760 --> 2:13:40.840]  involved and let's go further they found not one but two of the hijackers passports in the rubble
[2:13:40.840 --> 2:13:45.560]  when there's hundreds of millions of pieces of paper and hundreds of top millions of pounds of
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:53.240]  rubble everywhere and that day they find two passports out of those fireballs i mean clearly
[2:13:53.240 --> 2:13:57.400]  and then you have the fbi trying to bust them at the flight schools being ordered to stand down in
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:04.600]  florida texas oklahoma illinois minnesota arizona not wanting to know how to land planes we know
[2:14:04.600 --> 2:14:09.640]  there was islamic terrorists we know that goes on but there was a larger strategic plan just like
[2:14:09.640 --> 2:14:16.760]  obama supported al qaeda and isis in the arab spring there is a sick nexus with islamic terror
[2:14:16.760 --> 2:14:21.160]  just like we know that vegas was an islamic terror attack they used the guy who was a gun runner to
[2:14:21.160 --> 2:14:26.040]  get guns once they were in the country the saudi's were having a military convention there in the
[2:14:26.040 --> 2:14:32.360]  town was already a saudi civil war that saudi civil war spilled over from my intel that's from
[2:14:32.360 --> 2:14:37.000]  high level fbi who are good guys into that that's why you've never been told what happened you live
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:41.480]  in vegas i mean no doubt about that and there's multiple of these examples and so if you take
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:46.520]  sort of a james elroy script from his american tabloid trilogy the 1960s which he described as
[2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:51.320]  history massed as fiction that you could take that sort of template of how power operates in these
[2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:56.120]  kind of major public trauma events and apply them and always find it just a useful intellectual
[2:14:56.120 --> 2:15:00.520]  exercise to do so and to see how much it would explain events better than the establishment
[2:15:00.520 --> 2:15:06.120]  narrative does and 9 11 like oklahoma city and several others the james elroy version of events
[2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:10.360]  and narrative better predicts forecast and explains what takes place and what did take place
[2:15:10.360 --> 2:15:14.440]  than what the establishment narrative is well oklahoma city i've interviewed the police officers
[2:15:14.440 --> 2:15:18.360]  that were the second and third to get there they killed the first guy that got there i've interviewed
[2:15:18.360 --> 2:15:24.040]  that guy's wife i mean i've i've talked to like the head you know vietnam veteran head of the k9
[2:15:24.040 --> 2:15:29.640]  unit he's don browning yep that came in his office and said we'll kill you and your wife you don't
[2:15:29.640 --> 2:15:34.120]  shut about the bombs we put in there and then those were all special guys that clinton sent in
[2:15:34.680 --> 2:15:38.680]  and hillary and he said he got reelected because of that they blew that building up to blame the
[2:15:38.680 --> 2:15:42.920]  right wing folks that was taken over congress and i mean i've interviewed everybody involved i know
[2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:48.200]  the names of who planted the bombs with a lot on the city it's open and shut with 9 11 something's

[2:21:04.360 --> 2:21:09.960]  on every bit of coal we've got into that uh into that steam engine on this local mode of
[2:21:09.960 --> 2:21:15.160]  hauling ass down the track towards 2020 which is so incredibly critical but to see us come from
[2:21:15.160 --> 2:21:20.360]  nowhere to see globalism and so much trouble and nationalism and christianity reigniting in the
[2:21:20.360 --> 2:21:27.240]  western ethos again is very exciting that said ladies and gentlemen over the years they harassed
[2:21:27.240 --> 2:21:31.160]  and took all our sponsors away you know you hear some on the network those are their sponsors
[2:21:31.160 --> 2:21:35.160]  and normal sponsorship can't pay for multimedia like this they can't pay to send crew around the
[2:21:35.160 --> 2:21:39.080]  world they can't pay to do the type of things we've done and really give the globalists a
[2:21:39.080 --> 2:21:42.760]  run for their money i mean we've got a lot of reporters a lot of crew and they're kicking butt
[2:21:42.760 --> 2:21:49.400]  and so many times big stories you see that up in the national news come from info wars first
[2:21:49.400 --> 2:21:54.040]  and then drudge boosted and then it gets on up to to fox and i'd love to see fox covering the
[2:21:54.040 --> 2:21:57.880]  factor keeping babies alive and selling their body parts because that'll bring down the whole house
[2:21:57.880 --> 2:22:04.200]  of cards but if you want to continue to see us on air i got to tell you it's so simple shop
[2:22:04.200 --> 2:22:08.840]  with the good guys go to infowarstore.com especially if you never have get some of the way of america
[2:22:08.840 --> 2:22:14.200]  coffee get some of the great new tropics we've got that are healthy good stimulants like brain force
[2:22:14.200 --> 2:22:20.200]  turbo force and then chill force that gives you that awake but focus zen type awake chill feeling
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:25.880]  there's no reviews yet for that combo because chill forces came out but brain force has thousands of

[2:22:44.840 --> 2:22:49.640]  are 80 bucks they discount them down to 50 well ours is at 50 we usually discount it down to 30
[2:22:49.640 --> 2:22:57.320]  it's 24.95 right now take advantage of that and again know that you're funding the program that
[2:22:57.320 --> 2:23:03.400]  and then the operation that really gets under the global of skin and then separately also we have
[2:23:03.400 --> 2:23:07.960]  some other big specials that are running right now but it is your purchase that again makes it all
[2:23:07.960 --> 2:23:11.960]  possible and barns i never asked you to do this but you were chiming in you really like our wake
[2:23:11.960 --> 2:23:16.440]  of america coffee and you were saying you really like brain force oh yeah so i mean i've always got
[2:23:16.440 --> 2:23:21.080]  the the coffee which is great was fantastic some of the best coffee i've ever had uh that's the
[2:23:21.080 --> 2:23:25.640]  reason i get them a bit of a coffee snob i've always got the the fluoride free toothpaste
[2:23:25.640 --> 2:23:30.040]  because i like that because i always had concerns about fluoride which were recently confirmed
[2:23:30.040 --> 2:23:33.640]  in a wide range of studies after they were criticizing it for forever saying there's no
[2:23:33.640 --> 2:23:38.200]  worries no concerns all of a sudden they're like well it actually causes baby defects uh and then
[2:23:38.200 --> 2:23:42.600]  uh and then i like the protein bars because they're a good sort of intermediate snack so
[2:23:42.600 --> 2:23:46.040]  when you want something to eat between sort of lunch and dinner or between dinner and a late
[2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:50.280]  snack and you don't want it just to be you know little debbies or swiss cake rolls
[2:23:50.840 --> 2:23:55.240]  then protein bars really hit the spot but so with the protein bars i got a free sample of brain
[2:23:55.240 --> 2:23:59.960]  force and typically i'm not a supplement guy so supplement doesn't usually like unlike other people
[2:23:59.960 --> 2:24:04.840]  my brain chemistry is such that it's unaffected by most medicines unaffected by a wide range of things
[2:24:04.840 --> 2:24:09.000]  so i just generally haven't tried it but one thing i've looked for over the years is when i was in
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:13.720]  law school they had something they called two-way which allowed me to have sort of peak mental ability
[2:24:13.720 --> 2:24:18.040]  during law school exams uh and then the only side effect was when you crashed you crashed but there
[2:24:18.040 --> 2:24:21.880]  was no other major side effect to it turned out there were some illegal products in it so it's no
[2:24:21.880 --> 2:24:26.040]  longer available i had not found anything that could come close to it so i got a free sample
[2:24:26.040 --> 2:24:30.040]  and i was like well what the heck i'll try it see if it works because because of the nature of my
[2:24:30.040 --> 2:24:34.840]  legal work i have these peak times where i need peak mental activity whether it's doing a trial
[2:24:34.840 --> 2:24:38.520]  whether it's about to be in front of a court hearing whether it's doing an appellate oral argument
[2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:42.520]  there are times when you're up for two days oh exactly so i need to be able to during that time
[2:24:42.520 --> 2:24:45.880]  period of when i'm you know i used to be able to stay up two days no problem and you know didn't
[2:24:45.880 --> 2:24:50.280]  blink twice no passing that age threshold well that's not so easy and so i thought well randall will
[2:24:50.280 --> 2:24:54.360]  like my mother great lord he's the same way he went so long not sleeping naturally that now he
[2:24:54.360 --> 2:24:58.600]  can't sleep exactly so in fact that's what i do i actually have sleeping pills now just to be able
[2:24:58.600 --> 2:25:03.560]  to sort of help sleep so the uh just once you train your brain not to sleep it's it stays active and
[2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:07.880]  won't shut down so i needed something that when i wake up i could stay peak and and keep at that
[2:25:07.880 --> 2:25:12.120]  peak level and so i figured i'll go ahead and try it and it turned out to be fantastic it's the best
[2:25:12.120 --> 2:25:16.200]  product i've ever had in that regard and by the way we're not just saying all this i go out and i
[2:25:16.200 --> 2:25:21.160]  find out what is the peak research what is already the highest rated what has the best reviews and
[2:25:21.160 --> 2:25:24.760]  then they have to market up five seven times maybe they're smarter than i am i had marketers go
[2:25:24.760 --> 2:25:30.200]  jones you're getting the trap of only marketing stuff up 100 percent 150 maybe and then and then
[2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:35.160]  you cut it back you're only making 25 percent you're gonna go bankrupt even though you're selling
[2:25:35.160 --> 2:25:40.120]  tons of this stuff you sell 20 million dollars of supplements but you make six million that
[2:25:40.120 --> 2:25:44.280]  doesn't fund this operation and so i really got myself in that trap because the listeners only
[2:25:44.280 --> 2:25:48.760]  buy one stuff 50 off right now and then that's not cutting the nut and i'm not bitching and
[2:25:48.760 --> 2:25:52.680]  complaining i'm just telling you you see all the other media going bankrupt folks and the left
[2:25:52.680 --> 2:25:56.760]  propped up by soros the rest of it we're not propped up we're propped up by you so just get
[2:25:56.760 --> 2:26:02.360]  stuff you need and believe me this stuff is all the best we can get you the best fish oil the best
[2:26:02.360 --> 2:26:08.120]  turmeric the best uh the skin cream i mean a lot of really game-changing stuff so so thanks for the
[2:26:08.120 --> 2:26:13.720]  plug but i i mean you just told me that you love it i forgot tempershad a great idea it made it go
[2:26:13.720 --> 2:26:17.240]  from supermail that tally to this be the best seller we should do this with other stuff he said
[2:26:17.240 --> 2:26:23.080]  hey let's can i put samples uh you know from the factory give them free package in the products and
[2:26:23.080 --> 2:26:26.920]  i said yes and so we need to put samples i think in all of i think it's the bigger orders get the
[2:26:26.920 --> 2:26:31.160]  free samples because that stuff adds up we need to put brain force samples and everything well
[2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:34.520]  absolutely because in fact what i did is after it worked i was like in fact what happened was i
[2:26:34.520 --> 2:26:38.520]  had taken it earlier than the day and it was right like around nine or ten p.m was like why am i still
[2:26:38.520 --> 2:26:42.920]  at sort of peak mental facility because i've been going for 15 hours and usually by that point i
[2:26:42.920 --> 2:26:47.000]  started to fatigue started to drift off and in fact i was trying to what entertainment my brain
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:50.840]  was still going boom boom boom boom boom and then i realized oh this was this was the very first
[2:26:50.840 --> 2:26:55.000]  time i'd taken brain force so i was like this must be it so i went and researched all the ingredients
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:59.160]  figured out oh okay this makes perfect sense this combination and for whatever reason no one else out
[2:26:59.160 --> 2:27:03.000]  in the marketplace has really combined it in the way you have well what i did is i went to top
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:08.440]  developers had to pay people quite a bit of money for that i mean just our uh turbo force i had to pay
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:14.840]  $30,000 from the guy top developer of products we said if somebody would put a lot of money into
[2:27:14.840 --> 2:27:18.360]  something because the other manufacturers won't he still puts some stuff in cheap that works
[2:27:18.360 --> 2:27:21.720]  what would your dream product be and i had to pay the guy he's famous i can't say his name
[2:27:21.720 --> 2:27:26.520]  that's in the contract to make turbo force and that's why a lot of professional athletes are
[2:27:26.520 --> 2:27:30.120]  using others because they're actually finding out no this is the best the strongest long ass
[2:27:30.120 --> 2:27:35.000]  to you know 10 hour energy is really what it is and so we had to pay a developer on this too
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:39.240]  and really what they did was they had to test that they spliced two best-selling products together
[2:27:39.240 --> 2:27:43.000]  uh and so that that's why it works so well oh it's fantastic and what's great is the whole
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:46.920]  model the whole model of trying to make it affordable so the large blue collar part of
[2:27:46.920 --> 2:27:51.880]  the audience can also afford it it basically it's a way for people to get be healthier of people to
[2:27:51.880 --> 2:27:55.960]  be wealthier because they're getting the same products they would otherwise buy but cheaper

[2:32:03.960 --> 2:32:08.440]  it makes me sick to my stomach to be vindicated and have the fire department of new york and
[2:32:09.400 --> 2:32:16.280]  major construction and engineering firms come out and confirm that bombs were in tower one tower
[2:32:16.280 --> 2:32:23.240]  two and of course building seven just pancakes and that then fbi director robert moeller helped
[2:32:23.240 --> 2:32:29.080]  cover the whole thing up with the soddies and to know that there's a deep state group working
[2:32:29.720 --> 2:32:35.320]  within our government with radical islam who are using the threat of islamic terror to take our
[2:32:35.320 --> 2:32:40.360]  basic liberties and freedoms while empowering and funding radical islam to take over the planet
[2:32:40.360 --> 2:32:45.880]  well 18 years later i'm here to tell you that the world is a way to the 9 11 and info wars and our
[2:32:45.880 --> 2:32:50.840]  researchers and our guests our whistleblowers have been vindicated yet again that's why info wars
[2:32:50.840 --> 2:33:16.840]  dot com is more important than ever you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:16.840 --> 2:33:31.160]  because he's crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[2:33:33.160 --> 2:33:38.600]  you know we reached that point in history where mpr comes out and says okay the cia ran giant
[2:33:39.160 --> 2:33:43.720]  kidnapping rings of small children to electro shock them and drug them into mind control
[2:33:43.720 --> 2:33:49.400]  assassins and yeah we've got human animal hybrids and yeah fluoride gives you cancer and deformities
[2:33:49.400 --> 2:33:56.360]  and lowers your icube especially for men and boys and uh yeah we're doing secret experiments on
[2:33:56.360 --> 2:34:02.360]  yeah yeah and g3 g4 g5 gives you cancer we're doing it anyways and world governments here and
[2:34:02.360 --> 2:34:07.400]  yeah we're funding radical islam and yeah we knew about 9 11 and let it happen and it's just now
[2:34:07.400 --> 2:34:11.480]  kind of all out there instead of being vindicated i just kind of feel a sickening feeling because
[2:34:11.480 --> 2:34:16.280]  there's all this other crazy stuff we know is going on and suddenly the head of the cia or
[2:34:16.280 --> 2:34:21.480]  former heads on c span going yes we control the weather with a barium salt bloom dioxide
[2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:26.360]  is added to jet fuel the jet companies don't even know and it aerosolizes and protects the earth
[2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:31.000]  from solar rays then we have scientists on they go actually it heats the earth up because the
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:36.040]  ultraviolet goes through they can't bounce back out and it just goes on and on like who are these
[2:34:36.040 --> 2:34:42.520]  people what is this whole shadow global system who runs it what are they trying to do and it gets
[2:34:42.520 --> 2:34:47.720]  crazier and crazier and crazier because it's like we're the little kids at the little kid table
[2:34:47.720 --> 2:34:51.480]  and government the think tanks they're all over there running things in big tech and
[2:34:51.480 --> 2:34:55.960]  they've already decided our future they tell us it's a post-human future and we're like hey uh
[2:34:55.960 --> 2:35:00.040]  we see you doing this we see you doing that and they're like shut up that's not going on
[2:35:00.040 --> 2:35:05.240]  but then they publish white papers through themselves all admitting it the Robert Barnes
[2:35:05.240 --> 2:35:09.560]  what would you call that level of disdain well it's a certain degree of arrogance and insolence
[2:35:09.560 --> 2:35:14.840]  that is born of an elite culture that continues to sort of recreate itself and live in ultimate
[2:35:14.840 --> 2:35:20.840]  echo chambers that is sort of impregnated or impregnable from the real world in an ordinary
[2:35:20.840 --> 2:35:24.520]  everyday opinion i remember thinking about this when i was watching the movie the whistleblower
[2:35:24.520 --> 2:35:29.320]  which was about den core and about the degree in which various defense contractors involved are
[2:35:29.320 --> 2:35:35.480]  complicit in human trafficking sex trafficking epstein style and watching it i was almost frustrated
[2:35:35.480 --> 2:35:40.600]  by the lead character who becomes the whistleblower exposes this going on based on a real story in the
[2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:46.760]  1990s movie came out in the 2000s a major hollywood film yet the press mostly covered refused to
[2:35:46.760 --> 2:35:50.760]  cover it or talk about it but i was frustrated as i watched the lead character because i was like
[2:35:50.760 --> 2:35:54.680]  why doesn't she realize this is coming why doesn't she realize that this is coming why doesn't she
[2:35:54.680 --> 2:35:59.560]  anticipate this why doesn't she take this protective of action and i realized that someone
[2:35:59.560 --> 2:36:05.640]  who has never been even exposed to the info wars alex jones frame of mind such that she doesn't
[2:36:05.640 --> 2:36:11.400]  even know to anticipate certain things because she's so naive and idealistic it's like uh as one of
[2:36:11.400 --> 2:36:15.880]  the uh producers was telling me had shown me earlier it's like the godfather scene where the uh
[2:36:15.880 --> 2:36:21.560]  where he's talking to the son is talking to the uh his fiance at the time uh diane keaton's character
[2:36:21.560 --> 2:36:25.880]  and he says uh you know look my book my guy's just like my dad's just like any other boss
[2:36:25.880 --> 2:36:31.480]  and she's like uh well senators and presidents don't go out and kill people and he's being naive
[2:36:31.480 --> 2:36:36.680]  now okay exactly famous line which is well presidents and senators don't have people killed
[2:36:36.680 --> 2:36:40.920]  exactly the clinton bet death by the clinton body count just doesn't exist it was funny when you
[2:36:40.920 --> 2:36:45.400]  were showing earlier the clinton uh hillary talking about predators and how some of these
[2:36:45.400 --> 2:36:49.560]  people she's heard might be connected to drug cartels and i was like i wonder where the hillary
[2:36:49.560 --> 2:36:55.320]  connection concern with drug cartels came from me know yeah exactly the and all those kids who
[2:36:55.320 --> 2:36:58.920]  were dying because they saw things they weren't supposed to see on the railroad tracks which
[2:36:58.920 --> 2:37:03.720]  is what led to the original exposure of a lot of the clinton corruption and connections and the
[2:37:03.720 --> 2:37:07.720]  origin of the clinton body count was various people dying who were seeing things they weren't
[2:37:07.720 --> 2:37:13.480]  supposed to see up next to me in arkansas and that tees up zack for he's he's the most senior
[2:37:13.480 --> 2:37:18.280]  google engineer yet to go public other engineers that have gone public with limited whistleblowing
[2:37:18.280 --> 2:37:23.080]  have called him the edward snowden a big tech whistleblowing and he's still on twitter at
[2:37:23.080 --> 2:37:31.320]  perpetual maniac for now and uh he joins us because well the uh 50 states are moving led by
[2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:36.120]  ken paxton and the texas attorney general working with the attorney general bar trump were told
[2:37:36.120 --> 2:37:39.800]  that you've talked to your sources it's imminent with antitrust actions we're going to talk about
[2:37:39.800 --> 2:37:44.120]  that we'll talk about how for he's exposed the clinton body count how google was rigging it
[2:37:44.120 --> 2:37:48.200]  then suddenly last week they put it back to normal with a real search uh but it's like
[2:37:48.200 --> 2:37:53.480]  whackham also zack good to have you here with us to help from your expert angle uh navigate and
[2:37:53.480 --> 2:38:02.200]  decipher where we are right now uh yeah so the breaking news is that uh after um a bunch of people
[2:38:02.200 --> 2:38:07.080]  started bringing to attention this clinton body count uh controversy and that i wrote a medium
[2:38:07.080 --> 2:38:15.160]  article about it um just this week um google reversed themselves and added back the clinton
[2:38:15.160 --> 2:38:22.840]  body count uh to the google search predictions so if if users go to google and they type in clinton
[2:38:22.840 --> 2:38:28.040]  body it's and then type in the letter c it's going to autocomplete it's going to give an
[2:38:28.040 --> 2:38:34.200]  autocomplete suggestion for the clinton body count do you know what it used to be because i
[2:38:34.200 --> 2:38:37.560]  was looking up youtube and i wanted to show a bunch of uh see a bunch of google of course
[2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:40.920]  owns youtube this was several weeks ago and i just wanted to look at all the different clinton
[2:38:40.920 --> 2:38:45.960]  body count videos just for curiosity see what the various theories are out there currently uh so
[2:38:45.960 --> 2:38:51.080]  forth and instead it came up clinton body shops clinton this i know that's what comes up yeah and
[2:38:51.080 --> 2:38:55.640]  uh so or if you or if you put it in clinton criminal it would bring up her criminal justice
[2:38:55.640 --> 2:39:01.080]  bill from 95 yeah exactly i mean this was like orwellian this was stuff that even uh in his
[2:39:01.080 --> 2:39:05.320]  wildest dreams george orwell couldn't imagine you know or aldis huxley couldn't imagine these are
[2:39:05.320 --> 2:39:10.360]  things that you know aldis huxley a brave new world george orwell of course 1984 an animal farm
[2:39:10.360 --> 2:39:15.560]  that even they couldn't envision the world that he's described zack four he's uh why do you think
[2:39:15.560 --> 2:39:20.760]  when they get exposed i've seen this before they'll fix it and then go back to it later and i guess
[2:39:20.760 --> 2:39:24.760]  when there's a spotlight they want to deny that they're fixing the search results because sundar
[2:39:24.760 --> 2:39:29.480]  bachai the head of google as you know testified last year when i was there in this year that oh we've
[2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:35.400]  never manipulated a search ever yeah well i've found out that they're aligned because i was able to
[2:39:35.400 --> 2:39:41.960]  go to uh the internal public search engine of google's company and type in blacklists and find
[2:39:41.960 --> 2:39:48.680]  the blacklists that the executives were claiming under oath didn't exist so you know they're both
[2:39:48.680 --> 2:39:54.520]  face lying to the american people they're both face lying to the congressional to congress uh
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:40:00.440]  under oath and committing perjury um and this is something that needs to be exposed and the way
[2:40:00.440 --> 2:40:06.280]  that a lot of this works is whenever evil's exposed there's like the surge that happens right at the
[2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:13.480]  very beginning uh when all the media attention gets focused and so what happens is uh the response
[2:40:13.480 --> 2:40:19.720]  is to pull back and the hope that the media attention dies down and then restore and continue on
[2:40:19.720 --> 2:40:25.400]  with the uh plan exactly when they're opposed by opposition they never want to have the fight
[2:40:25.400 --> 2:40:30.360]  they always kind of sneak away retrench and then come back later you had a question yeah so the
[2:40:30.360 --> 2:40:33.960]  it which shows the power of the public and the power of the audience to sort of change the world
[2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:39.640]  in just little and everyday ways in that capacity how much do you think the people at google are
[2:40:39.640 --> 2:40:45.640]  worried and concerned about the 50 state attorney generals combined with the u.s attorney general
[2:40:45.640 --> 2:40:50.600]  these wide-scale investigations from a broad-ranging group of people coming from diverse
[2:40:50.600 --> 2:40:55.480]  intellectual ideological and legal perspectives including the president's purported imminent
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:41:01.080]  action uh to go further related to google given the intentions to meddle in elections through the
[2:41:01.080 --> 2:41:06.040]  algorithmic search engines that you're talking about yeah well i think that the fear is really
[2:41:06.040 --> 2:41:14.200]  real um there was an sec filing that just happened in the last month where google uh told its investors
[2:41:14.200 --> 2:41:21.960]  that they were going to come under increased scrutiny for its monopolizing practices and
[2:41:21.960 --> 2:41:27.560]  this is really you know this is this is going from all levels of the company the employees
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:33.560]  themselves from what i've heard um are in revolt over the revelation of google's global
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:42.280]  election meddling system and um you know it's it's an amazing time to uh to see this all of this
[2:41:42.280 --> 2:41:49.400]  stuff that was conspiracy theory is now becoming conspiracy fact i just want to like you were
[2:41:49.400 --> 2:41:53.880]  there for years eight years and you have a lot of contact still there what has been the feedback
[2:41:53.880 --> 2:41:59.640]  on you going public with a lot of courage in the last month what what has been uh secondarily
[2:41:59.640 --> 2:42:04.440]  people's response to you doing it when we come back from break uh and when you talk about an open
[2:42:04.440 --> 2:42:08.600]  revolt as it comes out that they're rigging elections rigging basically all information
[2:42:09.320 --> 2:42:14.440]  where do you see all that going exact for he's is our guest twitter at perpetual maniac and of
[2:42:14.440 --> 2:42:18.360]  course we got robert barnes constitutional lawyer riding shotgun with us so we're going to go to
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:23.960]  break and come back but just briefly um what percentage of people would you say at google are
[2:42:23.960 --> 2:42:29.480]  even aware that google is manipulating the election i mean i think pretty much everyone has heard

[2:47:26.200 --> 2:47:33.560]  but
[2:47:49.960 --> 2:47:53.560]  ladies and gentlemen we're back live here i want to pull up a washington post headline
[2:47:53.560 --> 2:48:00.760]  from monday if we can the headline was google's always listening now it's always watching
[2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:10.120]  with nest now again paul watson and i listeners pointed it out in 2014 and then in 2000 and excuse
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:20.040]  me 2004 and then 2006 google told shareholders hey we're listening to people over their microphones
[2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:26.040]  now and creating keyword databases they use the example if a dog's barking we know to have dog
[2:48:26.040 --> 2:48:31.240]  food ads now that was their little innocuous thing but imagine that that announcement they're
[2:48:31.240 --> 2:48:36.040]  listening to you just slipped out and zack vorhees the biggest google whistleblower yet
[2:48:36.040 --> 2:48:45.080]  again the ed snowden of big tech whistleblowers the pentagon papers daniel elsberg of big tech
[2:48:45.080 --> 2:48:50.600]  i mean it's simply amazing what you're hearing and there's been almost a total blackout on him
[2:48:51.560 --> 2:48:56.040]  and some of his associates that have gone public showing you the real discipline of corporate
[2:48:56.040 --> 2:49:01.320]  media and big tech together that hey if you report on this you get blackballed and that's why
[2:49:01.320 --> 2:49:05.800]  m4s is so precious and i don't really care about myself at the end of the day i've had a really good
[2:49:05.800 --> 2:49:10.840]  run i just know i have a responsibility to stay in this fight even more hardcore up against all this
[2:49:10.840 --> 2:49:15.880]  even though i'm like a salmon swimming upstream because we know how evil these globalists are
[2:49:15.880 --> 2:49:21.080]  now and we know they plan to overturn all our basic freedoms and complete our journey into slavery
[2:49:21.080 --> 2:49:25.080]  so again listeners i salute you for what you've done but realize the real fight again is just
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:31.080]  starting but uh going back to that wash and post headline google is always listening now
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:36.680]  it's watching two with the nest hub max and they admit how creepy it is but they think we're so weak
[2:49:36.680 --> 2:49:40.760]  we'll all just accept this and the new cars are coming out with ai that watches you and now
[2:49:40.760 --> 2:49:46.040]  ai is going to watch your baby and report back to cps i mean this is a real revolution against
[2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:52.760]  humanity and i think we were saying zak is thanks to you and matt drudge and tucker carlson and
[2:49:52.760 --> 2:49:59.080]  everybody coming out and warning about this there's really now internal debates all across the world
[2:49:59.080 --> 2:50:03.320]  not just in google in big tech and google's relationship with the chikoms it seems like
[2:50:03.320 --> 2:50:07.640]  what you're saying is a positive discussion's happening and these 50 attorney generals and
[2:50:07.640 --> 2:50:11.640]  trump preparing to take action is beautiful i want to get your take on all that and then i want to
[2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:16.040]  get your take on what you think trump should do because i know it's still all on the drawing board
[2:50:16.040 --> 2:50:22.360]  in the next few weeks at the white house yeah so to get an idea of how fearful google is about
[2:50:22.360 --> 2:50:29.640]  this news story i want to point to a cmbc article which is titled google bans political discussion
[2:50:29.640 --> 2:50:35.240]  on internal mailing lists now what's really um interesting about this is that google has always
[2:50:35.240 --> 2:50:42.680]  prided itself as a company that has had candid open discussions about a variety of topics
[2:50:42.680 --> 2:50:51.000]  they're now slamming the door shut on that and um and the reason is quite telling they explicitly
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:58.680]  say that um that the reason why that they're doing it is because you know people are getting really
[2:50:58.680 --> 2:51:05.400]  enraged about what google is doing on the inside and that they don't want employees talking about
[2:51:05.400 --> 2:51:12.680]  the latest news story now they don't say latest news stories plural they say latest news story so
[2:51:12.680 --> 2:51:17.720]  what they're talking about specifically is uh the google leaks and i think that that's really
[2:51:17.720 --> 2:51:23.640]  interesting and really telling about what's what's going on um i actually had a friend of mine um
[2:51:23.640 --> 2:51:31.880]  who has a subscriber or he's got a youtube channel with 500 000 subscribers and he just got fired
[2:51:31.880 --> 2:51:38.040]  from facebook because he had a youtube channel and it wasn't like oh well he's has low performance
[2:51:38.040 --> 2:51:43.160]  they literally told him you know you've got a youtube channel it violates her terms you're done
[2:51:43.160 --> 2:51:49.720]  no warning just you're done and so the other companies that uh they're they're now scared
[2:51:49.720 --> 2:51:55.400]  they're now realizing that they are you know complicit in election meddling and i believe
[2:51:55.400 --> 2:52:02.120]  that facebook is complicit in election meddling and now they're trying to um uh take people that
[2:52:02.120 --> 2:52:08.040]  have a strong social media following they're identifying them as a threat and pushing them
[2:52:08.040 --> 2:52:15.960]  and purging them out of the company um as far as the um you know the states go um the states
[2:52:15.960 --> 2:52:25.480]  are gearing up for a antitrust um action against google and in fact the corporations are so fearful
[2:52:25.480 --> 2:52:32.680]  that the hill ran an article titled 51 major ceo's ask congress for federal privacy law
[2:52:32.680 --> 2:52:37.880]  blocking state rules now now this is really funny because you know the msm is always talking about
[2:52:37.880 --> 2:52:43.400]  like democracy democracy democracy how sacred it is here's here's an instance where they're trying to
[2:52:43.400 --> 2:52:48.920]  get uh they're trying to subvert the democracy of the states and they're now running scared to the
[2:52:48.920 --> 2:52:53.080]  federal government begging them saying let us see legally spy on people because that's what you
[2:52:53.080 --> 2:52:57.800]  were telling me that they on the phone bar and i agree this whole antitrust thing is key it's true
[2:52:57.800 --> 2:53:03.000]  their monopolies their combines cartels it's out of control but the violation of privacy rights
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  and the selling of data it's kind of like they're trying to pass laws so they can kill babies after
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:10.840]  they're born now because they've been keeping them alive and harvesting their organs well can you
[2:53:10.840 --> 2:53:16.440]  pass a law in the future to make something legal that happened in the past and i mean how outrageous
[2:53:16.440 --> 2:53:21.640]  is this in fact the constitution prohibits it it's called an ex post facto law and the law
[2:53:21.640 --> 2:53:26.760]  specifically precludes constitution specifically precludes those kind of actions from being taken
[2:53:26.760 --> 2:53:31.160]  that impact people's individually protected rights whether they be property rights privacy rights
[2:53:31.160 --> 2:53:35.800]  or other rights and so i think that's where senator holly and others have called for these
[2:53:35.800 --> 2:53:40.200]  kind of masculine investigations to be escalated and elevated and i think what's useful is we're
[2:53:40.200 --> 2:53:45.320]  seeing more and more of the google whistleblowers come out for two reasons one they're seeing them
[2:53:45.320 --> 2:53:51.400]  be politically permitted to the public space and be protected in the public space by places like
[2:53:51.400 --> 2:53:55.800]  this and the audience from info wars protecting them providing a means by which they can express
[2:53:55.800 --> 2:54:00.600]  their concerns providing a means by which they can be protected for expressing their concerns
[2:54:00.600 --> 2:54:05.480]  and the law in california provides protection so if you're an employee at any of these big tech
[2:54:05.480 --> 2:54:10.680]  companies the best way for you to get remedies to go public with your concerns because then
[2:54:10.680 --> 2:54:15.240]  you're protected from any discriminatory employee that's when the whistleblower statutes kick in
[2:54:15.240 --> 2:54:18.280]  and i want to just say this because we keep harping as they're trying to shut us down and
[2:54:18.280 --> 2:54:22.440]  you know three four years into this it's it's it's you know it's hurting and they're surprised
[2:54:22.440 --> 2:54:27.800]  we're still here they can't believe it the globalists are shutting everything down there's only a few
[2:54:27.800 --> 2:54:34.840]  places like drudgereport.com and info wars.com that'll tell the truth now fox news is five years
[2:54:34.840 --> 2:54:39.880]  into babies being kept alive and their organs sold it's all over local news it's in court cases now
[2:54:39.880 --> 2:54:48.120]  they still won't cover it so again not even fox news will stand up for the already born okay even
[2:54:48.120 --> 2:54:52.760]  fox news trying to explain away what governor northam had said so i'm trying to say this year
[2:54:53.560 --> 2:54:58.520]  we are very close to true authoritarianism completely taking over because they were already
[2:54:58.520 --> 2:55:03.880]  trying to do it by stealth now they know that we're awake they're trying to sew it all up
[2:55:03.880 --> 2:55:09.240]  and accelerate it so we've got to be active we've got to be aggressive and we've got to remember
[2:55:09.240 --> 2:55:19.080]  urls like memeworld.com ban.video info wars.com news wars.com whether they're my sites or not
[2:55:19.880 --> 2:55:24.280]  you know because i mean paul's got his summit.news we've got to get back to serving the web like
[2:55:24.280 --> 2:55:29.720]  matt drudge warned us that is so critical because now they're even coming at trying to block url
[2:55:29.720 --> 2:55:33.240]  level they're even trying to keep people off their servers they're taking the nra's bank
[2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:38.360]  accounts away they're going to do this to everybody this is real authoritarianism they mean business
[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:44.760]  zach borees yeah i agree they're and the thing is is that now that they've been exposed they're
[2:55:44.760 --> 2:55:49.800]  trying to run as fast as they can to the great work which is the the new world order and even
[2:55:49.800 --> 2:55:54.200]  the fact that we are becoming awake to what they're doing doesn't mean that they're going to slow
[2:55:54.200 --> 2:55:58.280]  down it means that they've got to speed up and the reason why they have to speed up is because
[2:55:58.280 --> 2:56:03.800]  they're at declining power and the dangerous thing about declining powers is that they're always the
[2:56:03.800 --> 2:56:09.400]  most powerful right now because in the future tomorrow the next month they're going to be less
[2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:14.680]  powerful and so with the remaining power that they have they're going to try to push it as far as
[2:56:14.680 --> 2:56:21.400]  they possibly can and nowhere is this more evident than in my hometown city of san francisco where
[2:56:21.400 --> 2:56:25.640]  they're now changing the language around those that are involved with the justice system before
[2:56:25.640 --> 2:56:31.640]  they were called criminals or convicts but now they're changing it to justice involved individuals
[2:56:31.640 --> 2:56:37.160]  they're now declaring the nra a terrorist organization and when you look at all this people
[2:56:37.160 --> 2:56:43.400]  are like well why are they speeding up why are they going you know from 40 to 60 miles an hour
[2:56:43.400 --> 2:56:48.280]  to 100 miles an hour it's because that they're a declining power and because they're afraid of
[2:56:48.280 --> 2:56:55.960]  of the audience of the people of america waking up and challenging their established power
[2:56:57.720 --> 2:57:03.720]  if i if i can i'd like to get back to the fact that one of the breaking news pieces about google
[2:57:03.720 --> 2:57:12.440]  is that there is 48 territories and states that are banding together in order we got to go to
[2:57:12.440 --> 2:57:16.360]  break fourth hour fourth hour stay there zack four he's with a whole hour with you and robert

[2:57:26.440 --> 2:57:29.960]  on the fact that their power is the greatest it'll ever be right now they know that
[2:57:30.760 --> 2:57:34.920]  and then what is their end game when you look at what they want to do they say don't say mother and
[2:57:34.920 --> 2:57:40.440]  father get rid of the family the drug everybody out i mean it's a post human world what is the

[3:00:22.680 --> 3:00:25.880]  because i want to have a lot of time to get into it with he and robert barnes and
[3:00:25.880 --> 3:00:31.000]  the big move that that that trump says is coming and he's the attorney general coordinating with
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:37.720]  all 50 states leading it that that's trump taking action so he is delivering so far will it be enough
[3:00:37.720 --> 3:00:41.960]  will it be soon enough jack fourhees is a huge google whistleblower but i want to get back to
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:47.880]  where you were right there with barnes in this segment you agree with that statement that these
[3:00:47.880 --> 3:00:52.680]  inbred global powers know they're in decline they're trying to kill competition kill sovereignty kill
[3:00:52.680 --> 3:00:58.520]  freedom as if that will keep them in a position when all they're doing is making the world more
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:06.040]  unstable but there's this weird evil instinct is that a way to quantify it or or or what is the
[3:01:06.040 --> 3:01:10.520]  sickness of the establishment why would they be trying to break up families and dumb people down
[3:01:10.520 --> 3:01:15.560]  and do all this well i mean the way i explained it is i the explaining to other people why alex
[3:01:15.560 --> 3:01:20.120]  jones infill wars has been ahead of the curve on so many topics and subjects it's a recognition of
[3:01:20.120 --> 3:01:26.840]  the problem of power particularly in it's a culture of power a sort of cult of power that it leads to
[3:01:26.840 --> 3:01:31.720]  this kind of manifestation as it has historically over time things like human sacrifice traditions
[3:01:31.720 --> 3:01:35.720]  things like elevating the individual over the community things like elevating about being
[3:01:35.720 --> 3:01:41.080]  anti-religious and anti the community's traditions and cultures and more ways uh all of those
[3:01:41.080 --> 3:01:45.400]  structures are sort of reflected in a long tradition of elite behavior in society that is a
[3:01:45.400 --> 3:01:50.440]  manifestation of a deranged version of a power driven cultish culture of the elite that the only
[3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:55.560]  reason why they are elite and seek to be elite is to have extraordinary power which only makes sense
[3:01:55.560 --> 3:02:00.440]  if they're using and abusing that power so that thus you see which is why you get organized pedophiles
[3:02:00.440 --> 3:02:04.920]  about to say because to carry out that vampiric operation you've got to be in power exactly in
[3:02:04.920 --> 3:02:10.280]  fact the when i when i used to represent victims of domestic violence victims of abuse the i you
[3:02:10.280 --> 3:02:15.000]  would discover certain patterns of behavior and all pedophilia behavior is power driven so that
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:18.680]  it's not i mean it's the reason why people had questions about the michael jackson case he didn't
[3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:22.920]  fit that uh michael jackson really didn't fit the power driven dynamic he fit the dynamic of someone
[3:02:22.920 --> 3:02:27.560]  who wanted to be a kid for the rest of his life which was not someone who'd been abused yeah yeah
[3:02:27.560 --> 3:02:32.280]  and someone who really just wanted to be 12 years old not abuse 12 years old that's where i knew
[3:02:32.280 --> 3:02:36.280]  people who are involved in the case and the and there was not really strong evidence of abuse in
[3:02:36.280 --> 3:02:42.040]  his case unusual behavior no doubt but not pedophilia not like epstein epstein is a power driven case
[3:02:42.040 --> 3:02:46.360]  that's what you see with pedophilia he loves to humiliate beautiful women exactly that's
[3:02:46.360 --> 3:02:50.360]  that's where you see the clinton dynamic clinton's sort of one minute he wants to
[3:02:50.360 --> 3:02:54.200]  sort of romance them the next minute he wants to abuse and dominate them that's why he has an
[3:02:54.200 --> 3:03:00.040]  unusual psychopathology in combining multiple affairs and illicit behavior also with abuse
[3:03:00.040 --> 3:03:04.200]  and rape allegations and sexual harassment allegations because he reflects that combined
[3:03:04.200 --> 3:03:09.400]  power driven psychological motif and clinton the clinton's are sort of the ultimate expression
[3:03:09.400 --> 3:03:13.880]  of that elite ideology that celebrates and worships the idol of power the cult of power
[3:03:13.880 --> 3:03:18.040]  the culture i want to get zach's take on that and then i want to tie it into this this is a real
[3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:22.440]  fetish with women and their husbands and who enjoy killing their baby and i'm going to kill a little
[3:03:22.440 --> 3:03:30.120]  bastard i've got power and it's a sacrifice to them in in in in total arrogance in total selfishness
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:36.440]  i mean these people are just committing their souls to hell zach i mean yeah and i'm actually
[3:03:36.440 --> 3:03:40.760]  worried about if i'm going to get in trouble talking about too much truth uh you know because
[3:03:40.760 --> 3:03:44.120]  i've got one you're gonna have the floor we come back because i know we've been rattling on but
[3:03:44.120 --> 3:03:49.240]  you're going to break in a minute but you're gonna whatever you want to say say it okay um so yeah
[3:03:49.240 --> 3:03:55.880]  this has been going on for a really long time uh for thousands of years um and jeffrey epstein was
[3:03:55.880 --> 3:04:01.080]  you know a conspiracy theory but now all the information about what he was doing which was a
[3:04:01.080 --> 3:04:05.960]  blackmail operation for the elite and the politically connected uh that's all coming out
[3:04:05.960 --> 3:04:12.040]  right now and jeffrey epstein is not the only one um it's now coming out that hu hefner was also
[3:04:12.040 --> 3:04:17.480]  part of this network and that the gatekeepers and the globalists in order to allow you to be you
[3:04:17.480 --> 3:04:24.280]  know famous or a politician you had to produce a blackmail file and do this blackmail file if you
[3:04:24.280 --> 3:04:28.760]  ever turned against the globalists then they could just take this blackmail file out and then you
[3:04:28.760 --> 3:04:33.160]  would be done that would be it so this has been going on for a really long time and we're entering
[3:04:33.160 --> 3:04:38.840]  into a new phase of society with all of this being exposed it's a brand new day well i mean i've
[3:04:38.840 --> 3:04:42.520]  never really seen that i heard that about hefner but i mean if you can't sit back and see that

[3:07:35.320 --> 3:07:39.960]  let's protect our children all right robert barnes ride the shotgun zack for he's the huge
[3:07:39.960 --> 3:07:44.040]  biggest google whistleblower ever we were getting into the bottom of the rat hole he was during
[3:07:44.040 --> 3:07:48.360]  that one minute break he was saying some powerful stuff when we go to zack recap because you know
[3:07:48.360 --> 3:07:54.760]  you work in la you do most your practice there this you were saying i said is that true about
[3:07:54.760 --> 3:07:58.920]  hefner from your intel and you elaborate on it sure so the so my understanding from the people
[3:07:58.920 --> 3:08:04.680]  that i had some clients that were uh playboy playmates and others and they said that uh the
[3:08:04.680 --> 3:08:08.440]  various stories about hefner were generally not true that hefner was mostly a sort of a stand-up
[3:08:08.440 --> 3:08:12.200]  guy whatever you think of his lifestyle but that he wasn't connected to the other hollywood
[3:08:12.200 --> 3:08:15.880]  culture but there were people that were hangers on that would go to the parties that would go to
[3:08:15.880 --> 3:08:21.720]  the famous playboy parties and that at those places they were seeking people to exploit people to
[3:08:21.720 --> 3:08:26.360]  expose people to sort of put into a variation of a human trafficking ring and that those are the
[3:08:26.360 --> 3:08:29.880]  people they would call them people to watch out for people to look out for but they were used to it
[3:08:29.880 --> 3:08:34.360]  because hollywood culture is rife with it it's a culture driven by extortion it's a culture driven
[3:08:34.360 --> 3:08:39.800]  by power power over culture power of ideas power over people that's why it's disproportionately
[3:08:39.800 --> 3:08:44.440]  riddled with pedophilia and pedorast kind of personalities and people who abuse children
[3:08:44.440 --> 3:08:49.000]  routinely and regularly people who abuse all kinds of people and you've had wide range of young
[3:08:49.000 --> 3:08:52.680]  actors come out and talk about it talk about how often and how frequent they've been subject to
[3:08:52.680 --> 3:08:58.600]  abuse how routine and regular it is how commonplace it is how is industry standard practice that's
[3:08:58.600 --> 3:09:01.480]  the reason why there was a reason why harvey widenstein thought he could get away with whatever
[3:09:01.480 --> 3:09:06.120]  he wanted there's a reason why epstein moved so easily well you said it was also a power thing
[3:09:06.120 --> 3:09:11.080]  because yes came out a few years ago who's the black actor i forget his name he plays the president
[3:09:11.080 --> 3:09:15.880]  in theocracy he talked about how dudes would grab his crotch oh exactly well that happened to me
[3:09:15.880 --> 3:09:22.760]  three times yeah terry cruz and and but it wasn't sexual it was a power thing oh brennan one time
[3:09:22.760 --> 3:09:28.120]  i said listen i'll beat your ass and then at the end of the meeting the guy was like well he drives
[3:09:28.120 --> 3:09:32.200]  safe he goes are you threatening me got really scared yeah but it was like but i mean i it was
[3:09:32.200 --> 3:09:36.280]  like a guy just grabs like what the hell are you doing oh yeah the i mean like there's a reason
[3:09:36.280 --> 3:09:40.600]  why people like wesley snipes who was my client people like paul newman people like gene hackman
[3:09:40.600 --> 3:09:45.880]  people that are more sane move away exactly you'll see them physically get as far away as possible
[3:09:45.880 --> 3:09:50.040]  you know gwyneth paltrow was hinting at the harvey winstein problems for years
[3:09:50.040 --> 3:09:54.680]  and the media was suppressing it i heard i knew people that worked for winstein went to a kentucky
[3:09:54.680 --> 3:10:00.200]  derby party with those guys and the it was clear what harvey winstein was up for a long time but
[3:10:00.200 --> 3:10:05.400]  everybody was intimidated and terrified to talk about it and it's a power driven culture it's a
[3:10:05.400 --> 3:10:09.960]  culture that wants power more than anything else it's not a coincidence that in washington dc
[3:10:09.960 --> 3:10:14.200]  in la you'll find some of the highest disproportionate degrees of pedophilia
[3:10:14.200 --> 3:10:18.680]  pederast behavior missing children are disproportionately present in both populations
[3:10:18.680 --> 3:10:23.080]  i mean let's get on as folks there is evil in the universe it seeks power when we deny that's
[3:10:23.080 --> 3:10:27.560]  happening we give it carte blanche we're here to admit it exists and i thank all the listeners
[3:10:27.560 --> 3:10:31.560]  for their support because without you we would not be here and history would be different
[3:10:31.560 --> 3:10:35.240]  zach worries i'm gonna shut up the next few segments because i want you to roll get into the
[3:10:35.240 --> 3:10:39.560]  news get into the great work what do you think the globalists are trying to build and then
[3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:46.680]  what's the big breaking news well you know politicians presidents influencers have all
[3:10:46.680 --> 3:10:54.360]  warned us that there is a global conspiracy to create a one-world totalitarian government
[3:10:55.080 --> 3:11:02.680]  and this plan has been in place for thousands of years and whenever they think whenever they set
[3:11:02.680 --> 3:11:10.600]  a timeline to achieve this uh you know whether it's agenda 21 or agenda 2030 um when that when
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:18.360]  that time comes uh it's time scales are always moved to the future because the great work is
[3:11:18.360 --> 3:11:25.320]  has never been able to be achieved uh the human spirit of sovereignty uh comes and smashes it
[3:11:25.320 --> 3:11:31.160]  right as they believe that they're about to achieve victory which is what's happening right now like
[3:11:31.160 --> 3:11:36.680]  what's happening right now is not unique it's yet another part of the timeless cycle throughout
[3:11:36.680 --> 3:11:44.280]  history where you know conspirators try to create you know a totalitarian system and then the spirit
[3:11:44.280 --> 3:11:52.120]  of god you know empowers the people to rise up you know throw off the uh the the mask and are able to
[3:11:52.680 --> 3:11:58.040]  see them who for what they really are and destroy their new world order and then they have to
[3:11:58.040 --> 3:12:04.520]  scamper back and then regroup and then try again and and that's what we see over and over and over
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:11.640]  again uh google is just another example of of this new world order totalitarianism and I believe
[3:12:11.640 --> 3:12:16.920]  that they thought that they were going to you know achieve it with this they certainly have
[3:12:16.920 --> 3:12:23.400]  penetrated further than I had actually expected as an employee I mean parents are telling me that
[3:12:23.400 --> 3:12:28.920]  you know not only do their kids use the chrome browser and gmail but that they're also using
[3:12:28.920 --> 3:12:35.240]  their chromebooks and all of their educational studies and the amount of the infiltration that
[3:12:35.240 --> 3:12:41.960]  needs to happen in the United States is just a massive project that will take years to to unravel
[3:12:41.960 --> 3:12:47.960]  all of the things that google has been able to do to get into every aspect of our lives and that's
[3:12:47.960 --> 3:12:54.680]  reason why I've been advocating for a google detox uh I've been doing it myself um instead of using
[3:12:54.680 --> 3:12:59.480]  chrome I now use the brave browser which is based on the open source version of chrome but without
[3:12:59.480 --> 3:13:05.960]  all the bad stuff in it um instead of gmail I now use proton mail instead of google search or use duck
[3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:10.520]  duck go and start page uh in order to find the information and what's really interesting is
[3:13:10.520 --> 3:13:16.600]  that a lot of these alternative services are now better than what google's products are
[3:13:16.600 --> 3:13:22.520]  oh google doesn't even work now it's a broken fried system well I mean it's amazing how basically
[3:13:22.520 --> 3:13:27.480]  there is competitive entrepreneurial economic opportunity by the degree to which the monopolistic
[3:13:27.480 --> 3:13:32.360]  cultural manipulation and curation that google's engaged in has created and that's why they are
[3:13:32.360 --> 3:13:37.160]  living off of their monopolistic practices that violate the law of leveraging their access
[3:13:37.160 --> 3:13:41.800]  of their search engine control and their video control it's like a cancer absolutely that's
[3:13:41.800 --> 3:13:47.400]  it's a viral cancer that is trying to spread and plague the modern mind and keep it from being
[3:13:47.400 --> 3:13:52.200]  independent and separate from their mind control efforts which is all about dictating what people
[3:13:52.200 --> 3:13:56.040]  think and how they think and what sources they're allowed to think about and what ideas they're
[3:13:56.040 --> 3:13:59.400]  allowed to express and share with and and and and Zach we'll get more of the breaking news
[3:13:59.400 --> 3:14:03.000]  in a moment but you but you're saying you talk to all these folks and I see it that that a lot
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:07.240]  of people are kind of compartmentalized this is a big awakening for the average google employee
[3:14:07.240 --> 3:14:11.560]  really getting decompartmentalized but also I think then having the courage for other people
[3:14:11.560 --> 3:14:16.920]  in big tech to realize that it's their right and duty to speak up about this that's right you know
[3:14:16.920 --> 3:14:22.840]  we have a voice and we can tell other people about you know information that they may not be
[3:14:22.840 --> 3:14:28.280]  aware of and this is part of the great awakening I'm having this conversation with my friends
[3:14:28.840 --> 3:14:36.680]  about you know today is 9-11 and the official narrative of what has happened doesn't check out
[3:14:36.680 --> 3:14:42.920]  the facts simply don't support the hypothesis that's been pushed by the mainstream media and the
[3:14:42.920 --> 3:14:49.800]  government in the past and so it's our responsibility as sovereign individuals to find out what the
[3:14:49.800 --> 3:14:56.040]  truth is and spread it because the truth is viral which is the reason why that there is so much
[3:14:56.040 --> 3:15:00.920]  misinformation being pushed by the mainstream because they have to push it or else the truth
[3:15:00.920 --> 3:15:05.480]  will come out and challenge their established power I agree we're going to break you got some other

[3:20:25.560 --> 3:20:27.720]  wants you before the fire
[3:20:32.120 --> 3:20:37.240]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen i am your host alex jones and you know we're not going along
[3:20:37.240 --> 3:20:41.800]  with the power structure we're not taking orders from anybody we're just organically researching
[3:20:41.800 --> 3:20:46.360]  and trying to build a better human future and standing up against a lot of powerful cartels
[3:20:46.360 --> 3:20:51.720]  one of the most powerful the big medical cartel the military industrial complex of medicine
[3:20:52.600 --> 3:20:56.440]  and all the crimes it's committed all the things that's gotten away where the now to
[3:20:56.440 --> 3:21:01.880]  see google and facebook covering up mainline studies about fluoride and cancer and IQ reduction
[3:21:01.880 --> 3:21:06.760]  covering up life of satan covering up i mean they're just doing anything evil you can imagine
[3:21:06.760 --> 3:21:12.680]  and clearly being paid to do it and then lying to congress to get away with it zack four he's a
[3:21:12.680 --> 3:21:17.720]  huge google whistleblower i wanted to get into the 50 attorney generals and uh you know his
[3:21:17.720 --> 3:21:23.160]  his his perspective being a former google engineer who just left in the last few months but barns
[3:21:25.320 --> 3:21:30.040]  i mean i asked you about this and i mean clearly this is trump through the 50 attorney generals
[3:21:30.040 --> 3:21:37.080]  it's bar coordinating it explain how we want to get the states working with the feds explain
[3:21:37.080 --> 3:21:41.320]  why you think what you're seeing so far is good so tip it well for the given example this is the
[3:21:41.320 --> 3:21:47.800]  biggest legal antitrust coordinated investigation by state criminal criminal and civil authorities
[3:21:47.800 --> 3:21:52.280]  in the history of the country you won't find another comparable example of this so when they
[3:21:52.280 --> 3:21:56.600]  went after microsoft it was just the department of justice in a few states when they've gone off
[3:21:56.600 --> 3:22:01.160]  to when they went after the big trust in the late 19th century early 20th century it was only a
[3:22:01.160 --> 3:22:05.160]  scattering of states and federal governments many of them didn't even have the tools until the 19
[3:22:05.160 --> 3:22:10.840]  teens 1920s 1930s to take meaningful action and even then at that stage and at that point only a
[3:22:10.840 --> 3:22:16.840]  few did in scattered form so what you have here is when the reason why you want to coordinate it
[3:22:16.840 --> 3:22:20.840]  if you're on the government side why you don't want it coordinated if you're on the google side
[3:22:20.840 --> 3:22:24.840]  is because they're going to make sure they don't step on each other's shoes step on each other's
[3:22:24.840 --> 3:22:29.400]  foot and and step on each other's toes in ways that interfere with intruder impair their ability
[3:22:29.400 --> 3:22:35.720]  to be effective so basically each one is pursuing their own particular focus an area focus based
[3:22:35.720 --> 3:22:40.200]  either on a state law provision that's unique to that state or the feds approaching it from the
[3:22:40.200 --> 3:22:44.520]  antitrust perspective that's particular to the antitrust laws which you often differ from
[3:22:44.520 --> 3:22:50.200]  various state anti-competitive law provisions consumer fraud law provisions privacy law provisions
[3:22:50.200 --> 3:22:56.040]  so they're facing a massive scale wholesale investigation into every aspect of their economic
[3:22:56.040 --> 3:23:02.520]  and political activities across the board from a wide range of places why do you think uh bar
[3:23:02.520 --> 3:23:08.920]  and and pick paxton and in texas to coordinate the rest of states because texas has the most
[3:23:08.920 --> 3:23:14.680]  economic and political power in play that has the most uh the most willing to be independent
[3:23:14.680 --> 3:23:20.680]  investigative pro free enterprise but also anti-monopoly anti-political meddling anti-election
[3:23:20.680 --> 3:23:26.200]  modeling uh meddling attorney general in the country so he's willing to be the most on board
[3:23:26.200 --> 3:23:30.520]  with bars agenda and texas is in the democrat crosshairs to go blue and everybody keeps thinking
[3:23:30.520 --> 3:23:36.200]  that can't happen we're two to four years folks okay we're in deep trouble every texan better get
[3:23:36.200 --> 3:23:41.320]  up and wake somebody up and better get politically active now i'm pleased for your own good well
[3:23:41.320 --> 3:23:45.320]  they're already manipulating the ways they manipulate in texas they manipulate across the
[3:23:45.320 --> 3:23:51.000]  country today the university of houston released a survey that basically uh shifted the actual
[3:23:51.000 --> 3:23:56.040]  percentage of voters so it increased the number of mexican american voters it increased the number
[3:23:56.040 --> 3:24:01.000]  of immigration sensitive mexican mexican american voters opposed to older generations of mexican
[3:24:01.000 --> 3:24:05.000]  american voters who've been here in texas for multiple generations many of whom are info wars
[3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:09.320]  fans for example those voters were excluded from the poll to highlight other voting groups
[3:24:09.320 --> 3:24:13.160]  to create the impression that texas are already going to go democrat so that when they manipulate
[3:24:13.160 --> 3:24:17.320]  metal in the elect you believe it exactly and that's what trump keeps saying it's true these are
[3:24:17.320 --> 3:24:22.280]  fake polls but really democrats once they take a city over it never goes back because they engage
[3:24:22.280 --> 3:24:29.000]  in election fraud they are a criminal mafia zack vorhees what do you make of robert epstein uh
[3:24:29.000 --> 3:24:32.840]  coming out and and getting so much traction whether what he's saying about the basics that
[3:24:32.840 --> 3:24:39.960]  google and facebook can just push a a push notification to only the democrats and win elections well
[3:24:39.960 --> 3:24:46.520]  yeah you know and and this has been happening for a really long time mtv was doing get out the vote
[3:24:46.520 --> 3:24:53.160]  and google has the power because they have such a monopoly unlike mtv but they have such a monopoly
[3:24:53.160 --> 3:25:00.360]  that they can uh they can push they can identify which users would be likely to vote democrat
[3:25:00.360 --> 3:25:06.760]  due to their cyber phrenology um um expertise and then they can push a notification to that person
[3:25:06.760 --> 3:25:13.080]  either by you know their search engine or through a gmail notification for them to go out and vote
[3:25:13.080 --> 3:25:21.320]  but they they may not do that for a conservative um and that wouldn't necessarily be illegal um it
[3:25:21.320 --> 3:25:26.920]  would just be something that they do which is really ironic because they're acting as an unlicensed
[3:25:26.920 --> 3:25:35.160]  lobbyist um i i want to talk about the uh antitrust action because to get an idea of the scale of
[3:25:35.160 --> 3:25:41.080]  what's going on right now is that it's not just the doj and it's not just the states and the
[3:25:41.080 --> 3:25:49.560]  territories but it's also the uh the city of new york is now joining in on uh on this antitrust
[3:25:49.560 --> 3:25:55.160]  effort so it's from city states all the way to the federal governments that are doing this
[3:25:55.160 --> 3:26:00.840]  but there's actually one uh state that's missing from this list of 50 really and i was wondering
[3:26:00.840 --> 3:26:07.560]  if you could figure out which one it is take a guess i don't know tell me it's california oh of
[3:26:07.560 --> 3:26:13.000]  course oh yeah you're right yeah it's california so uh dr robert eppstein brought up a really good
[3:26:13.000 --> 3:26:17.880]  point with this and what he said is do you know why california's attorney general didn't join the
[3:26:17.880 --> 3:26:23.880]  other 50 attorney generals who just lost an antitrust action against google because california ag
[3:26:23.880 --> 3:26:31.880]  paquera has accepted significant campaign contributions from google wow which is headquartered
[3:26:31.880 --> 3:26:36.760]  in his state so that's hiding in plain view so when i saw all 50 states signed on that's a
[3:26:36.760 --> 3:26:42.840]  false headline it's only 49 it's states and territories so that's how they 50 states and
[3:26:42.840 --> 3:26:47.480]  territories that's how they trick you wow so that's another way they've semantically you
[3:26:47.480 --> 3:26:53.560]  think 50 states it's not good point zach yeah the other the other state that has joined in on this
[3:26:53.560 --> 3:26:58.520]  right now is alabama but i don't have any more news on on why that is but but i'll i'll be posting
[3:26:58.520 --> 3:27:03.320]  about it later because i'm investigating that currently that is huge so it looks like 50 states
[3:27:03.320 --> 3:27:09.400]  it's not it's ant territories wow well you know if trump doesn't get a handle on this uh i mean
[3:27:09.400 --> 3:27:15.080]  obviously they already stole the house in 2018 and i think trump will lose no matter who they run
[3:27:15.080 --> 3:27:20.120]  against him if if he doesn't do something about this right this is his only threat the only people
[3:27:20.120 --> 3:27:23.480]  who can beat him he's been able to beat the establishment press he's been able to beat the
[3:27:23.480 --> 3:27:27.000]  democratic political machine if you could beat the clinton machine you can beat any political
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:34.600]  machine his only risk the the one that stole the popular vote from him in 2016 is google is big tech
[3:27:34.600 --> 3:27:40.520]  and his argument is well they were really against me in 2016 and so i'll be no no more campaign
[3:27:40.520 --> 3:27:46.040]  stops more speeches don't do it trump okay if all your tens of millions of supporters can't
[3:27:46.040 --> 3:27:50.360]  share stuff and viral everywhere if i can't get like i was there in the election some weeks
[3:27:51.080 --> 3:27:57.880]  50 million 60 million 80 million views separate from the audience then how are people seeing what
[3:27:57.880 --> 3:28:02.200]  they said about you it wasn't true but they were saying that you hate all mexicans we'd show the
[3:28:02.200 --> 3:28:07.960]  real clip it got 50 million views well we can't do that now and so and they're blocking trump
[3:28:07.960 --> 3:28:12.040]  everywhere too exactly what he doesn't realize i was tracking this in live time because i plan on
[3:28:12.040 --> 3:28:17.000]  placing a big bet on the election and before i did so my biggest worry was social media manipulation
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:21.640]  which professor epstein was talking about he's the good epstein robert epstein like robert barnes
[3:28:21.640 --> 3:28:26.120]  jeffrey epstein like jeffrey dommer that's the way to separate out the but if you looked at it in
[3:28:26.120 --> 3:28:30.120]  detail they backed off because they thought for sure he was gonna lose so they only did a little
[3:28:30.120 --> 3:28:34.920]  bit of tampering it's nothing like what they're planning on 2020 and trump is starting to get
[3:28:34.920 --> 3:28:39.080]  the message starting to realize and that's why he's got to take more sort of aggressive action
[3:28:39.080 --> 3:28:42.920]  where they will steal our election steal our country steal our id i agree let's talk about
[3:28:42.920 --> 3:28:48.360]  bolton with both of you may come back because uh trump's really been coming out against him saying
[3:28:48.360 --> 3:28:55.480]  he was doing some really bad stuff what was that bad stuff when you have a pain in the neck a real

[3:32:49.960 --> 3:33:09.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:20.360 --> 3:33:28.360]  we are hitting the taliban right now harder than they've ever been hit but when they did what they
[3:33:28.360 --> 3:33:33.880]  did in order to create what they thought was a better negotiating stance i said that's the end
[3:33:33.880 --> 3:33:38.920]  of them get them out i don't want anything to do with them and they've been hit very hard and i know
[3:33:38.920 --> 3:33:44.840]  for a fact they said that was a big mistake that they made and it was but uh that was my decision
[3:33:44.840 --> 3:33:54.600]  john bolton is a really bad guy a warmonger a globalist he sat back when we were sold off the
[3:33:54.600 --> 3:34:02.840]  chai comms uh the trotsky idser who basically came over to the united states through mexico
[3:34:02.840 --> 3:34:08.280]  after a stall and kick trotsky out and that's who created the neocons very nice group of people
[3:34:09.000 --> 3:34:12.040]  very bad news planned they're fighting radical islam but they're puppeteering it
[3:34:12.040 --> 3:34:19.400]  and to see trump come out against these guys is very very exciting rand paul is very very happy
[3:34:19.400 --> 3:34:23.240]  saying we'll play that clip in a moment that we're on the edge of a new world war so you better
[3:34:23.240 --> 3:34:28.200]  be glad he's gone uh zack vorhees i mean this just makes me like trump more again i've been
[3:34:28.200 --> 3:34:34.360]  massively persecuted for supporting trump and i've gone through hell for it um you know i've
[3:34:34.360 --> 3:34:38.600]  had the establishment reach out and i'm you know those are private meetings it's not illegal what
[3:34:38.600 --> 3:34:42.840]  they're saying so i i wore the journalistic hat there and you know off record i mean
[3:34:43.800 --> 3:34:48.200]  i'm not supposed to say who it's like hey you ready to come out against guns you ready to uh
[3:34:48.200 --> 3:34:52.760]  at least a little bit you're ready to come out against trump some not a lot just come out and
[3:34:52.760 --> 3:34:59.480]  it'll all stop well no that's not how i work um but that's the point things have gotten to and
[3:34:59.480 --> 3:35:03.880]  people need to know that most people roll over to this type of stuff that you were going to tell a
[3:35:03.880 --> 3:35:07.720]  california attorney general story in a moment about stuff like that but uh zack i mean what's
[3:35:07.720 --> 3:35:15.480]  your view on trump so um i've been very worried in the past uh with syria and with iran i thought
[3:35:15.480 --> 3:35:20.600]  that we were headed into war and i was quite upset and i was ready to abandon trump when syria was
[3:35:20.600 --> 3:35:26.600]  coming in but then um it turns out that he did a head fake on the deep state and bombed a bunch of
[3:35:26.600 --> 3:35:34.840]  isis terrorists uh strongholds instead and an empty um airfield in syria and then there was reports
[3:35:34.840 --> 3:35:42.440]  that there was a un weapons inspection site or a chemical site that was that was bombed and um i
[3:35:42.440 --> 3:35:48.040]  started to realize that actually trump was doing a head fake on the deep state and sort of rooting
[3:35:48.040 --> 3:35:54.840]  out the the the deep state forces that were in syria i see the same pattern playing out in iran
[3:35:54.840 --> 3:36:04.520]  um there was a drone attack that iran did uh trump did this brinkmanship where we were about to go
[3:36:04.520 --> 3:36:09.400]  to war it seemed like and then at the last minute he pulled back and he said actually i don't want
[3:36:09.400 --> 3:36:16.520]  to kill a bunch of people and now uh john bolton is fired so what what can make sense of all this
[3:36:16.520 --> 3:36:25.400]  so according to my sources um iran has its own deep state and what trump's action did is that they
[3:36:25.400 --> 3:36:33.800]  were able to um tell that they're getting into war they got deep state actors in iran to uh to to fire
[3:36:33.800 --> 3:36:40.600]  that missile that hit that drone and as a result the iranian forces were able to arrest the individual
[3:36:40.600 --> 3:36:47.720]  and now i'm hearing rumors that um that there is an insurgency movement uh within the military
[3:36:47.720 --> 3:36:55.080]  to arrest uh not only the president but a bunch of other senior level uh officials within the
[3:36:55.080 --> 3:37:01.560]  government um and put them on trial um i haven't been able to confirm this this is just what my
[3:37:01.560 --> 3:37:07.240]  iranian source has told me is is now the rumor well trump said that he thought somebody did
[3:37:07.240 --> 3:37:10.760]  it who wasn't authorized by the government so so so we know there's wheels within wheels we know
[3:37:10.760 --> 3:37:16.840]  that bolton was sabotaging and leaking uh on the whole uh situation with north korea uh so the
[3:37:16.840 --> 3:37:21.960]  the question begs why would trump bring someone like bolton in but you go back to bombing the syrian
[3:37:21.960 --> 3:37:27.640]  airfield a couple times but they were putting pressure on him uh trump did master stroke
[3:37:27.640 --> 3:37:33.080]  neutralize the war hawks that way and he was against both iraq wars and he is trying to pull
[3:37:33.080 --> 3:37:40.040]  the troops out so that right there uh only makes him go up in in in stock value to me uh as ran paul
[3:37:40.040 --> 3:37:44.200]  has said i want to get your take on that uh constitutional lawyer robert barnes air a smart
[3:37:44.200 --> 3:37:51.800]  historian on that in a moment but here is senator ran paul you know i think uh the threat of war
[3:37:51.800 --> 3:37:56.760]  around the world is greatly diminished with bolton out of the white house i think he had a naive
[3:37:56.760 --> 3:38:02.760]  point of view for the world that we should topple regimes everywhere and institute you know democratic
[3:38:02.760 --> 3:38:07.400]  governments and we would make the world perfect or remake the world in our image and frankly just
[3:38:07.400 --> 3:38:12.280]  doesn't work that way there's a lot of history of getting rid of strong men in the middle east and
[3:38:12.280 --> 3:38:19.160]  having them replaced by vacuums or chaos or actually making the place more hospitable for
[3:38:19.160 --> 3:38:23.480]  terrorist training so i think his idea that the way you deal with iran is you just topple the
[3:38:23.480 --> 3:38:27.560]  government or the way you deal with north korea is you topple the government really wasn't what
[3:38:27.560 --> 3:38:31.880]  the president's been talking about the president's actually talking about not having regime change
[3:38:31.880 --> 3:38:36.440]  and finding a diplomatic solution to some of these conflicts around the world and i think the
[3:38:36.440 --> 3:38:40.760]  president deserves to have somebody who is his national security advisor who actually will try
[3:38:40.760 --> 3:38:45.480]  to further his policy and not try to stymie it senator your colleague ted cruise though didn't
[3:38:45.480 --> 3:38:50.600]  quite feel the same way he said that i sincerely hope is leading referring to bolton does not mean
[3:38:50.600 --> 3:38:56.520]  that the deep state forces at state and treasury who have been fighting tooth and nail to preserve
[3:38:56.520 --> 3:39:02.040]  the obama iran nuclear deal that finally convinced the president to go soft on around what did you
[3:39:02.040 --> 3:39:06.920]  make of that i think it's more about whether or not we should intervene everywhere whether we
[3:39:06.920 --> 3:39:11.800]  should have regime change or whether we should try diplomacy let's stop right there let's remember
[3:39:11.800 --> 3:39:17.800]  a man broke six of his ribs and punctured his lung and dozens of programs including national
[3:39:17.800 --> 3:39:22.680]  comedy shows have said they wish he was dead uh and now courts are trying to let the guy off for
[3:39:22.680 --> 3:39:28.040]  what he did trying to kill him and there's a big dove right there now let's expand that's a really
[3:39:28.040 --> 3:39:33.640]  smart point he made you've got the obama globalist's arm of the deep state that front of the arab spring
[3:39:33.640 --> 3:39:39.480]  that wants to implode europe's borders that faction wants the iran deal to keep going even
[3:39:39.480 --> 3:39:43.800]  though they're breaking it and getting nukes i don't like that then you do have the warhawk
[3:39:43.800 --> 3:39:49.400]  neocons in league with net and y'all who want to go ahead and knock iran out i don't want that war
[3:39:49.400 --> 3:39:54.120]  but also i get israel's point iran threatened to attack them uh how do you see those factions
[3:39:54.120 --> 3:39:58.840]  where do you see this going so i see where ted cruz's point is but i'm not sure it's you know
[3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:03.880]  ted cruz has a more hawkish position on iran a more of a willingness to end we the war is not a
[3:40:03.880 --> 3:40:08.680]  realistic option with iran it just is not they've already got nuclear weapons the the and they're
[3:40:08.680 --> 3:40:13.720]  the their scope it would make iraq various military experts have said it would make iraq look like a
[3:40:13.720 --> 3:40:19.000]  small-scale exchange look at cakewalk exactly so it is a disaster and a debacle well they've
[3:40:19.000 --> 3:40:23.480]  got the sleeper cells that we let in all over the west exactly so unless we're gonna go and i don't
[3:40:23.480 --> 3:40:28.120]  want to put all the iranians in labor camps unless we're gonna put them in camps like japanese
[3:40:28.120 --> 3:40:32.200]  you can't do it you have all kinds of domestic risk all kinds of international destabilization
[3:40:32.200 --> 3:40:37.160]  risk and war is simply not a manageable option an evasion is definitely not a manageable option
[3:40:37.160 --> 3:40:42.920]  nor is trying to bomb them really a manageable option economically all we still have many options
[3:40:42.920 --> 3:40:47.160]  on the table trump has already torn up the iran deal there is no iran deal left trump has already
[3:40:47.160 --> 3:40:51.720]  dispatched it already imposed a wide range of sanctions continues to go in that direction maximum
[3:40:51.720 --> 3:40:56.280]  pressure exactly a good go right up the oil spigot turn off the oil spigot and that's what
[3:40:56.280 --> 3:40:59.640]  would motivate iran and that's why iran's running around grabbing chips and stuff because they're
[3:40:59.640 --> 3:41:04.200]  they're hurt exactly then so trump's found the right middle way what iran wants to do is they
[3:41:04.200 --> 3:41:09.400]  want to trigger the u.s. into invading trigger the u.s. into a military action that will rally the
[3:41:09.400 --> 3:41:15.960]  local populace and rally the arab world behind them we and that yahoo he is in political trouble
[3:41:15.960 --> 3:41:20.840]  and and stuff so if he gets a war that gets his bacon on exactly so the net yahoo has always been
[3:41:20.840 --> 3:41:25.080]  too aggressive net yahoo is also a one he was supported the first iraq war said it was going
[3:41:25.080 --> 3:41:29.160]  to be easy and simple well turned out that was a little wrong so he's not someone to he's someone
[3:41:29.160 --> 3:41:33.800]  who's reasonably trying to protect his own country but it won't be his bacon in the in the fry pan
[3:41:33.800 --> 3:41:39.480]  frying pan if we go to war in the rain jack for he's you want to comment on that i mean yeah i
[3:41:39.480 --> 3:41:45.080]  think that one of the biggest reasons why israel doesn't want iran to have the nuclear weapon is
[3:41:45.080 --> 3:41:50.120]  because they don't want the competition because they've got the nuclear weapons they've got nuclear
[3:41:50.120 --> 3:41:57.640]  weapons right so um they're they're just posturing so that they can try to go to america into taking
[3:41:57.640 --> 3:42:06.520]  out um israel's competition and you know they're the israeli you know lobby within the united
[3:42:06.520 --> 3:42:11.640]  states is really strong i believe that trump has been playing for d chess and i believe that he's
[3:42:11.640 --> 3:42:17.240]  played the deep state by pretending that he was going to go into war and then the very last minute
[3:42:17.880 --> 3:42:23.640]  pulling out and as he's definitely double cross the hawks and that's a big deal
[3:42:24.680 --> 3:42:29.000]  speaking of that we'll finish up with that and get more into a few other issues with both of you

[3:46:01.800 --> 3:46:06.280]  it makes me sick to my stomach to be vindicated and have the fire department of new york and
[3:46:07.240 --> 3:46:14.120]  major construction and engineering firms come out and confirm that bombs were in tower one tower
[3:46:14.120 --> 3:46:21.320]  two and of course building seven it just pancakes and then fbi director robert moeller helped cover
[3:46:21.320 --> 3:46:28.120]  the whole thing up with the soddies in the know that there's a deep state group working with nr
[3:46:28.120 --> 3:46:33.880]  government with radical islam who are using the threat of islamic terror to take our basic liberties
[3:46:33.880 --> 3:46:39.640]  and freedoms while empowering and funding radical islam to take over the planet well 18 years later
[3:46:39.640 --> 3:46:44.520]  i'm here to tell you that the world is a way to the 9 11 and info wars and our researchers and
[3:46:44.520 --> 3:46:49.480]  our guests our whistleblowers have been vindicated yet again that's why info wars dot com is more
[3:46:49.480 --> 3:47:02.280]  important than ever you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:02.280 --> 3:47:14.040]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[3:47:17.720 --> 3:47:22.840]  all right i don't like to write myself in my own show but obviously there's there's constantly a
[3:47:22.840 --> 3:47:27.320]  lot of international national news attacking info wars line about us because they know we're americana
[3:47:27.320 --> 3:47:32.120]  they know we helped get a popular selected they're scared of it they want to discredit that they
[3:47:32.120 --> 3:47:37.320]  don't want to be a victory info wars shouldn't be a standard of victory and success and something to
[3:47:39.160 --> 3:47:45.320]  build off of it should be something to hate and and to look down on and to be forgotten well we're
[3:47:45.880 --> 3:47:54.120]  fighting harder than ever ladies and gentlemen and ten crews every chance he gets on the npr
[3:47:55.240 --> 3:48:01.560]  and uh texas monthly piece that also air in npr i'm told and at the watch some post and cnn and the
[3:48:01.560 --> 3:48:06.520]  and the new york times anywhere he does these tv interviews he comes out and backhandedly
[3:48:06.520 --> 3:48:17.560]  defends info wars but says alex jones is a nasty nut he says my dad killed jfk but even
[3:48:17.560 --> 3:48:21.400]  though he did that i support his free speech and i'm surprised others aren't defending him
[3:48:22.600 --> 3:48:28.920]  he basically started it into the podcast just yesterday on this with texas monthly
[3:48:28.920 --> 3:48:37.160]  the national paper of texas as they call it and of course the editor andy langer didn't defend
[3:48:38.520 --> 3:48:44.280]  me but ted let me put it on screen for you we put that new york times article up place
[3:48:45.640 --> 3:48:52.520]  it was roger stone that brought that out and it was trump brought that out
[3:48:52.520 --> 3:48:59.000]  roger stone said that on my show i covered it and and by the way you in the same podcast
[3:48:59.000 --> 3:49:04.360]  talking about your dad in the cuban revolution and fighting fidel from america and how your
[3:49:04.360 --> 3:49:12.040]  dad was a leader in it that was all cia fighting him your dad was in new orleans then your dad
[3:49:12.040 --> 3:49:18.920]  was in the anti-communist group that lee harvey oswald was in all he said was he worked for the cia
[3:49:18.920 --> 3:49:24.840]  and as soon as that came out within one day you dropped out of the campaign
[3:49:25.880 --> 3:49:30.120]  when ted cruz was running around stealing delegates in colorado other places had the
[3:49:30.120 --> 3:49:36.760]  republican party of the never trumpers from glenn beck to uh ben chapiro all working to block
[3:49:36.760 --> 3:49:42.040]  trump now i talked to you in dc ran into you talk some on camera some off i said hey just
[3:49:42.040 --> 3:49:46.120]  stop attacking me stop lying about me i'll support you you're a great senator even though you did
[3:49:46.120 --> 3:49:51.240]  some dirty stuff and he said okay that's great we'll all work with trump on a can and blah blah
[3:49:51.240 --> 3:49:55.880]  then he goes around and does these backhanded supports which which i guess in a world of
[3:49:55.880 --> 3:50:01.400]  calories i guess this is support of the show uh but just come on man don't say you love trump
[3:50:01.400 --> 3:50:07.000]  now and all this when it was donald trump did that can we put the new york times back on screen please
[3:50:09.240 --> 3:50:13.480]  or he'll i'll put on my phone there it is donald trump accuses ted cruz's father
[3:50:13.480 --> 3:50:20.040]  of associating with kennedy assassin now that's what was actually said we didn't say your father
[3:50:20.040 --> 3:50:25.000]  killed kennedy we we know who who who did that okay and it's all come out they got arrested
[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:29.480]  that day and released i don't just believe e howard hunt when i got the deathbed confession
[3:50:29.480 --> 3:50:33.960]  and aired it here simultaneously with coast to coast and we both broke that and then all and
[3:50:33.960 --> 3:50:37.480]  the fact that he was arrested there in the rail car and we knew who the other assassins were
[3:50:38.520 --> 3:50:42.360]  okay so no we didn't say your dad did that we said your dad was in the cia
[3:50:42.360 --> 3:50:47.160]  and was in new orleans that worked with lee harvey oswald now the new york times actually got that
[3:50:47.160 --> 3:50:53.720]  right so i'm saying to ted cruz why are you cozyed up to the texas monthly with no readers
[3:50:53.720 --> 3:50:58.520]  or the washington post you give a speech or he gets a million views you did that washington
[3:50:58.520 --> 3:51:04.680]  posting i had five thousand views that's your problem is you're sucking up to the establishment
[3:51:04.680 --> 3:51:09.880]  when that when when you should be running from it ted cruz so here here's part of what ted cruz had
[3:51:09.880 --> 3:51:15.000]  to say i'm a big believer in the first amendment even the first amendment for people who disagree with
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:23.080]  me um very concerned about tech censorship and bias and one of the things we saw some months
[3:51:23.080 --> 3:51:29.400]  ago is the tech platforms all deplatformed alex jones now listen alex jones i don't listen to
[3:51:29.400 --> 3:51:36.440]  a show but from what i know of it he's a nut um not only is he a nut he is a nut who has
[3:51:36.440 --> 3:51:45.800]  slandered me repeatedly uh among other things devoting significant airtime to to to claiming
[3:51:45.800 --> 3:51:55.240]  my dad killed jfk needless to say i'm not an alex jones fan nonetheless i defended his right to
[3:51:55.240 --> 3:52:02.360]  speak i said look the way to respond to bad ideas is not censorship you don't silence him you respond
[3:52:02.360 --> 3:52:09.720]  encounter it and a couple of things happened one i was disappointed that that i didn't see anybody
[3:52:09.720 --> 3:52:13.640]  left of center defending his free speech rights and and that's that's a shift that i think is
[3:52:13.640 --> 3:52:20.840]  troubling is that liberals don't tend to defend free speech the way 10 20 30 years ago they did
[3:52:21.880 --> 3:52:27.560]  but two you saw some particularly media folks saying okay cruz is positioning himself for a
[3:52:27.560 --> 3:52:33.240]  subsequent presidential campaign to try to curry favor with the alex jones listening on it like
[3:52:33.240 --> 3:52:38.200]  the guys are not no the reason i defended his right is precisely because he's been a nasty
[3:52:38.200 --> 3:52:44.760]  nut to me to show this isn't about people i like this is about that free speech protects everyone
[3:52:45.800 --> 3:52:50.280]  you know ted cruz is i agree with his policies but i don't know for the time i know he's a smart
[3:52:50.280 --> 3:52:55.400]  lawyer but man he's a liar okay he knows damn well i'm not the person that said that it's donald
[3:52:55.400 --> 3:53:02.840]  trump so you were never trump or then now because it's expedient you're nice to trump and so cruz
[3:53:02.840 --> 3:53:10.520]  i hate better or he's a horrible you know crazy person liar you know better and you need to knock
[3:53:10.520 --> 3:53:15.800]  it off so when i post this to m4s.com i want listeners to send it to him and his offices and
[3:53:17.400 --> 3:53:22.760]  just ask him to stop lying look you hit your pony to glen back you did all these things you made
[3:53:22.760 --> 3:53:27.320]  the mistakes and i know it pisses you off when i say you're from canada and you wear the cowboy
[3:53:27.320 --> 3:53:32.760]  boats and all this stuff i don't mind that you want to be a texan and your policies are very texan
[3:53:32.760 --> 3:53:39.320]  like but just from somebody who's a ninth generation texan whose family's name is on the state you just
[3:53:39.320 --> 3:53:46.120]  need to leave it alone carpet bagger scallywag because at a certain point it really gets old son
[3:53:46.760 --> 3:53:52.440]  okay your dad was in the cia you said on one program he was thinking about suing me file it bro
[3:53:52.440 --> 3:53:58.840]  let's go this is listen i held my nose and worked as hard as i could to get you elected you damn well
[3:53:58.840 --> 3:54:04.760]  know you barely won because of my audience which was the one that put you over the top
[3:54:04.760 --> 3:54:09.160]  they're going to steal that election from you in five years if you don't stop it
[3:54:12.680 --> 3:54:17.960]  all had no cattle cruise but thanks for supporting the free speech just stop saying
[3:54:17.960 --> 3:54:24.440]  that i said your dad killed kennedy i heard he's not that good a shot you want to comment on
[3:54:24.440 --> 3:54:30.120]  any of that i think senator cruise does what he's done a very good job job of is the defending
[3:54:30.120 --> 3:54:34.200]  free speech he's done a very good job of is exposing big tech he was a little bit late
[3:54:34.200 --> 3:54:37.640]  to the party they should have forced things through back when they controlled the house
[3:54:37.640 --> 3:54:42.040]  not when it's more rhetorical than it is substantive but at the same rate cruise is
[3:54:42.040 --> 3:54:46.840]  a peculiar personality there's no doubt about that there was those unusual tv ads that showed
[3:54:46.840 --> 3:54:50.920]  like very weird family interactions that they were trying to make look real and there's an
[3:54:50.920 --> 3:54:57.240]  aspect of him that continues to act to try to appeal to the political establishment this is a
[3:54:57.240 --> 3:55:02.360]  disease of washington republicans where they want to get the washington post to like them
[3:55:02.360 --> 3:55:07.240]  they want to get the texas monthly to like them they want to get the new york times to like them
[3:55:07.240 --> 3:55:12.200]  they want to get these liberal elite publications that will never like them even if they repented
[3:55:12.200 --> 3:55:18.040]  tomorrow of all of their conservative positions and recast themselves as newborn liberals they
[3:55:18.040 --> 3:55:23.400]  would still always be seen skeptically and critically by the establishment left there is
[3:55:23.400 --> 3:55:29.160]  never any appeasing that stalin-esque mindset mentality that dominates there now all it is
[3:55:29.160 --> 3:55:34.600]  is a subject to potential other forms of criticism so they should quit quit trying to appeal to them
[3:55:34.600 --> 3:55:41.320]  and remember who their base is about a fifth of cruise's voters are hardcore alex jones fans and
[3:55:41.320 --> 3:55:46.200]  listeners so he should remember that the next time he's thinking that's all i'm saying is i want to
[3:55:46.200 --> 3:55:52.600]  get fully behind him and then he runs around with these backhanded support just i'm just and he said
[3:55:52.600 --> 3:55:56.840]  he wasn't going to do it when i met with him exactly i mean i'm gonna run into him again and next
[3:55:56.840 --> 3:56:00.920]  time i'm not gonna be so nice it was when people like john bainer and others were going after rush
[3:56:00.920 --> 3:56:06.840]  limbaugh they kept forgetting who is the most important people supporting them in their audience
[3:56:06.840 --> 3:56:11.080]  and keeping their mouth you blown it out of the water great job zack for he's you've done an amazing
[3:56:11.080 --> 3:56:16.440]  job come back again uh tomorrow during our live coverage if you want to pop in or the show again
[3:56:16.440 --> 3:56:21.240]  i you've done a great job perpetual maniac on twitter we got about a minute left closing comment
[3:56:22.360 --> 3:56:29.000]  um yeah you know it's really funny how everyone tries to appease the establishment press
[3:56:29.800 --> 3:56:34.360]  despite how evil they are and how racist they are especially the new york times
[3:56:34.360 --> 3:56:40.520]  um and what's really interesting is you know just look at the engagement metrics on twitter
[3:56:40.520 --> 3:56:46.280]  i get more engagement as just you know the google whistleblower than the new york times the washington
[3:56:46.280 --> 3:56:52.680]  post do on most of their articles and so for you know for to see these politicians continually go
[3:56:52.680 --> 3:57:00.440]  after this dying media conglomerate is is mind blowing i you know my question is do they not see
[3:57:00.440 --> 3:57:06.200]  the future do they not see you know the awakening that's happening um people are moving away from
[3:57:06.200 --> 3:57:14.040]  these old legacy media and they're going towards credentialed individuals uh online and um well
[3:57:14.040 --> 3:57:19.640]  i agree that that's why they want to silence everyone that isn't them uh so i appreciate
[3:57:19.640 --> 3:57:24.840]  ten crews and i'm saying he's a scalloware carbon bagger it's just when he behaves like this he
[3:57:24.840 --> 3:57:30.040]  becomes the outside usurper coming to teach us texas you know that he's the big guy he knows
[3:57:30.040 --> 3:57:36.040]  best and it just it just sticks in my crawl uh and so we want you to be lair of him good
[3:57:36.040 --> 3:58:02.040]  ten hey thank you bob great job zack great job crew war rooms coming up right now the old shroyer
