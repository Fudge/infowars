[00:00.000 --> 00:20.680]  Wow, when I started out 27 years ago, right here in Austin, Texas, I just couldn't even
[00:20.680 --> 00:22.680]  imagine we'd be here.
[00:22.680 --> 00:27.520]  January 1st, the year is 2020.
[00:27.520 --> 00:28.960]  It was 2020.
[00:28.960 --> 00:39.200]  Now it's 2021, January 1st, 2021, not 2020, 2020 was a hellish year, and I'm here to tell
[00:39.200 --> 00:42.560]  you ladies and gentlemen, if I was you, I would get yourselves strapped in because I
[00:42.560 --> 00:46.960]  think 2021 is going to get even crazier.
[00:46.960 --> 00:53.520]  It's the old Chinese proverb, may you live in interesting times, it is Friday, January
[00:53.520 --> 01:02.240]  1st, 2021, and I want to open the phones up in the first hour ahead of Roger Stone with
[01:02.240 --> 01:08.120]  major exclusive information joining us and Robert Barnes with major exclusive information.
[01:08.120 --> 01:15.360]  He's been working since the election for President Trump going all across the country.
[01:15.360 --> 01:20.440]  He was there in Georgia with us in other areas, but he was off the radar then, and he can
[01:20.440 --> 01:27.240]  really give you the serious path to victory that Trump still has, but it is a narrowing
[01:27.240 --> 01:33.160]  window like in Indiana Jones, Raiders in the Lost Ark, where he rolls under as the wall
[01:33.160 --> 01:37.800]  lowers down and closes and reaches through and grabs his whip right as it slams shut.
[01:37.800 --> 01:45.280]  I mean, it's like a Robin Hood shot now of firing the arrow and splitting the arrow.
[01:45.280 --> 01:51.040]  You know, I've actually done that quite a few times, even 50 yards, split arrows.
[01:51.040 --> 01:56.320]  It can be done if you just relax, don't think about it, and loose the arrow very smoothly.
[01:56.320 --> 02:01.880]  You can hit the last arrow that is sticking in the bullseye, of course with composite
[02:01.880 --> 02:05.200]  arrows, they don't tend to split them, but back in the old days with the wooden arrows
[02:05.200 --> 02:12.440]  I've done it quite a few times, so the Death Star shot can be achieved, but it takes public
[02:12.440 --> 02:21.960]  pressure, it takes prayer, it takes precision, it takes providence, and it's happening.
[02:21.960 --> 02:27.200]  At least 140 House Republicans plan to object to Biden's electoral votes.
[02:27.200 --> 02:33.800]  They're pressuring Josh Howley to not contest Pence's ass to judge and toss out Louis Gohmert's
[02:33.800 --> 02:39.840]  lawsuit, seeing to overturn fraudulent election results.
[02:39.840 --> 02:45.240]  They have as much watch video, Jovan Pulitzer, the top Stanford research scientist, reveals
[02:45.240 --> 02:50.840]  electronic voting machines in Georgia communicating with vendor in China.
[02:50.840 --> 03:00.320]  The legislature ordered the ballots to be saved, but then they have video of dump trucks
[03:00.320 --> 03:05.840]  there loading them and taking them to the landfill, desperately like drug addicts or
[03:05.840 --> 03:10.720]  drug dealers flushing cocaine down a toilet when the police raid a crack house.
[03:10.720 --> 03:17.280]  I mean, this is not just open and shut, this is classical guys running out of the bank
[03:17.280 --> 03:21.960]  with bags of money in their hands when the cops pull up with a SWAT team.
[03:21.960 --> 03:26.840]  This is just unbelievable, but you've got total media blackout, mainstream media blackout,
[03:26.840 --> 03:32.120]  and you've got the real universe over here with InfoWars.com and Gateway Pundit and
[03:32.120 --> 03:36.400]  a few others, but even Newsmax and the rest of them are going along the line now that
[03:36.400 --> 03:39.920]  it is with Joe Biden and the Joe Biden's who we're going to now have for the next four
[03:39.920 --> 03:42.240]  years what a nightmare scenario.
[03:42.240 --> 03:50.320]  So it is Friday, January 1st, 2021, hard to believe, what an incredible time.
[03:50.320 --> 03:55.200]  They're coming with force inoculations of recombinant DNA that mutinogenically manipulates
[03:55.200 --> 04:02.080]  your cells, and it is jellyfish genomes, dead human genomes, another nightmare, ingredients,
[04:02.080 --> 04:03.880]  just you can't make that up.
[04:03.880 --> 04:09.720]  Couldn't imagine, say, in 1996 when I was on air, saying in the year 2021, we'll have
[04:09.720 --> 04:16.680]  a world government, the humans in charge, we're all wearing masks, and they're coming
[04:16.680 --> 04:24.400]  with inoculations to be able to buy and sell, and things are completely empty in New York
[04:24.400 --> 04:33.200]  and in LA, but in Wuhan, they are open for a big, gigantic party celebrating the end
[04:33.200 --> 04:38.520]  of America, and say that we will never reopen, because we are cowards like Chicken Little,
[04:38.520 --> 04:44.000]  they call us the scared little chicken in China, now they know that story, and they
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.160]  did such a good job with Bill Gates and the media, such a good job destroying America,
[04:49.160 --> 04:58.080]  at least they think so, we'll be right back, this is the info war, the year is 2021, 2021,
[04:58.080 --> 04:59.080]  2021.
[04:59.080 --> 05:00.080]  Fight for Trump.
[05:00.080 --> 05:07.320]  On January 6th, in Washington, DC, our fight to drain the Washington swamp and reclaim
[05:07.320 --> 05:17.360]  America's destiny has just begun, it's 1776 time, in November 14th, hundreds of thousands
[05:17.360 --> 05:21.800]  of American patriots gathered in the nation's capitol to stop the biggest election steal
[05:21.800 --> 05:40.360]  in American history, hundreds of thousands returned to DC in December, we will never
[05:40.360 --> 05:47.360]  give up, we will never surrender, we will never back down to the satanic, pedophile,
[05:47.360 --> 05:53.120]  globalist, new order, January 6th, fight for Trump, DC, be there, we will never give in,
[05:53.120 --> 06:17.960]  we will never give up, and we will never back down, we will never ever surrender.
[06:17.960 --> 06:29.640]  Friday, January 1st, the first day of the new year, 2021, it really is hard to believe
[06:29.640 --> 06:36.960]  that 2020, this insane year is now in the past, and we're pulling away rapidly into
[06:36.960 --> 06:45.400]  the future in the space time continuum, it is now Friday, January 1st, 2021, and I intend
[06:45.400 --> 06:52.520]  to open the phones up throughout the broadcast today, Roger Stone's got a lot of big intel
[06:52.520 --> 06:58.840]  and breaking news and information joining us in the second hour exclusively, then Robert
[06:58.840 --> 07:03.800]  Barnes who has been a lawyer quietly working for President Trump on the election fraud
[07:03.800 --> 07:10.920]  will be joining us with the cold hard facts in the third hour today, and then in the fourth
[07:10.920 --> 07:17.200]  hour we've got Dale Bigtree and the admitted science and the admitted documentation that
[07:17.200 --> 07:23.120]  these vaccines are tied to actually making you have a bigger autoimmune response to other
[07:23.120 --> 07:29.280]  COVID-19 viruses or regular Toronto viruses and infertility, and you've already heard
[07:29.280 --> 07:34.520]  that from top scientists and top researchers, but now it's happening, and so this is such
[07:34.520 --> 07:42.960]  a bold and insane power grab by the globalists, you have to ask, how do they think they're
[07:42.960 --> 07:54.360]  going to get away with this, if you understand psychology, I call it too evil to fail.
[07:54.360 --> 07:59.760]  When they engage in something this massive, something this big, something this criminal,
[07:59.760 --> 08:04.400]  and they get the general public and millions of doctors and nurses and healthcare practitioners
[08:04.400 --> 08:11.600]  and drug reps and media operatives and mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters and aunts
[08:11.600 --> 08:23.680]  and uncles and pastors and school administrators and counselors to go along with telling people
[08:23.680 --> 08:30.720]  to take the vaccine, the social engineers have noticed that most people when they're
[08:30.720 --> 08:38.280]  part of a crime, when they're part of something corrupt, when they get manipulated into doing
[08:38.280 --> 08:45.600]  something wrong, they don't say they're wrong, they decide to get even more delusional and
[08:45.600 --> 08:52.600]  decide on to even more excesses and more extremes, and there's many examples of this
[08:52.600 --> 08:58.480]  that you could point out throughout history, but it's a well-known phenomenon, and the
[08:58.480 --> 09:04.880]  one that I've personally experienced with co-workers and even not distant family, but
[09:04.880 --> 09:11.560]  not really close family, I'm very embarrassed about it, is online scams, everybody knows
[09:11.560 --> 09:15.960]  about Nigerian email scams, they're one of the most popular, one of the most prolific,
[09:15.960 --> 09:22.920]  but there's lots of them, lots of groups doing it, and you get an email that, hey, the royal
[09:22.920 --> 09:30.480]  bloodline of Prince of Boo Boo wants to give you a thousand dollars, he's got money locked
[09:30.480 --> 09:35.120]  up millions in this bank account, but he is unable because of sanctions to get it out
[09:35.120 --> 09:40.280]  or whatever, if you'll just give him a thousand dollars, you will be given twenty thousand
[09:40.280 --> 09:46.920]  dollars, and when you give him the thousand, they go, well, he's ready to give you even
[09:46.920 --> 09:53.760]  more money, but he needs five thousand more, but now he's going to give you a half million,
[09:53.760 --> 09:56.960]  and usually most people, once they've given a thousand, they don't want to admit they
[09:56.960 --> 10:03.160]  got conned, they give the larger amount, and then, if you've already given him like twenty
[10:03.160 --> 10:07.480]  thirty thousand dollars, a Cadillac will pull up at your house because they've got, you
[10:07.480 --> 10:10.960]  know, some of the guys in the scam all over the country, they'll be in royal robes and
[10:10.960 --> 10:14.840]  say, I am the representative of Prince of Boo Boo, he thanks you graciously, let's make
[10:14.840 --> 10:19.600]  a phone call to him, and he will graciously thank you from Nigeria, and then some people
[10:19.600 --> 10:23.400]  will mortgage their house to give a hundred thousand dollars to Prince of Boo Boo, because
[10:23.400 --> 10:31.280]  now Prince of Boo Boo is going to give you fifty million, and again, I knew a guy, a
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.120]  GCN talk show host, that said, I'm being offered a hundred thousand dollars by Nigerians, I've
[10:36.120 --> 10:40.720]  already given him five thousand, and I called the guy, and I said, that's a scam, bro, are
[10:40.720 --> 10:46.040]  you joking, or are you part of this, and he said, screw you, you're just jealous, I'm
[10:46.040 --> 10:53.880]  going to get all this money, and then he actually got ripped off, that's a radio host, and then
[10:53.880 --> 11:01.920]  had a nervous breakdown, so, but again, people want something that's too good to be true,
[11:01.920 --> 11:06.600]  that's why lottery tickets are so successful, if you want to buy lottery tickets, go ahead
[11:06.600 --> 11:12.880]  and do it, but it's designed to sell you false hope, and you statistically will get
[11:12.880 --> 11:20.120]  struck by lightning before you're going to win a major lottery ticket, but I have found
[11:20.120 --> 11:31.800]  when people get conned, most of the time they get mad at you, and they don't want you to
[11:31.800 --> 11:37.120]  tell them they're being conned, they think you're acting uppity, and are trying to impress
[11:37.120 --> 11:44.080]  them, or trying to put them down, and it's the same thing with these vaccines, I know
[11:44.080 --> 11:46.960]  exactly why they did all this, they had this plan for a long time, they launched it a little
[11:46.960 --> 11:50.200]  bit early, because they were worried about Trump, and nationalism, and all the rest of
[11:50.200 --> 11:56.560]  it, but the vaccine's got its own mission, but it's part of a larger operation, in December
[11:56.560 --> 12:05.120]  of last year, excuse me, now of 2019, so in December of 2019, so 13 months ago, excuse
[12:05.120 --> 12:10.720]  me, we're already in 2021, that takes me getting used to it, you saw us play the clubs here,
[12:10.720 --> 12:16.240]  they had a UN summit in Switzerland with the head of the WHO and all the vaccine experts,
[12:16.240 --> 12:22.080]  a two day summit, put it out, gave it no attention though, we learned about it for a couple weeks,
[12:22.080 --> 12:26.520]  but so on record they said, we should halt the world vaccine program, the doctors don't
[12:26.520 --> 12:31.000]  trust us, it's killing people, it's not tested, big pharma tells us what to do, we're not
[12:31.000 --> 12:38.120]  comfortable doing this, already at that point, they'd released COVID-19 out of Wuhan, they
[12:38.120 --> 12:43.560]  were already planning the big hysteria, they were already planning the big global UN rollout,
[12:43.560 --> 12:48.400]  failing forward, too big to fail, too able to fail, so that now we're not talking about
[12:48.400 --> 12:53.040]  the 50 million, it's estimated autistic boys in the world from vaccines, all in industrialized
[12:53.040 --> 12:57.200]  countries where they take the vaccines, doesn't even exist in non-industrial areas, doesn't
[12:57.200 --> 13:04.240]  exist in the Amish, and the tens of millions every year they get cancer for vaccines and
[13:04.240 --> 13:09.440]  all the other problems, that all gets washed away by the COVID hysteria, and oh yeah, there's
[13:09.440 --> 13:13.280]  some adverse reactions, don't worry about it, and then they just swamp the media with yeah,
[13:13.280 --> 13:19.360]  this person died, that person died, yeah, somebody got paralyzed, big deal move on until it just
[13:19.360 --> 13:24.880]  becomes background noise, while they silence all the anti-vaxxers, while they silence all
[13:24.880 --> 13:32.000]  the medical doctors and scientists and mothers and activists and the big pharma whistleblower,
[13:32.000 --> 13:39.280]  she ends up at 47, that's my age, dead in her house, we've got the documents at Australia
[13:39.280 --> 13:45.040]  where the government was talking to big pharma heads, they were talking about killing anti-vaxxers
[13:45.040 --> 13:51.120]  as they call us, we're not anti-vaxxers, we're anti-megacorporations with globalist population
[13:51.120 --> 13:56.080]  agendas, with a long history of secret testing and tainting things, wanting to put in us a
[13:56.080 --> 14:03.840]  whole new generation of systems that mutate ourselves on record, now there's the headline
[14:03.840 --> 14:10.400]  of the Washington Post, anti-vaxxers are dangerous, make them face isolation, fines and arrest,
[14:10.400 --> 14:17.520]  print that for me, do you hear that, make them face isolation, fines and arrest, you don't like
[14:17.520 --> 14:23.760]  getting Guillain berets, you don't like getting bells palsy, you don't like getting type 1 diabetes,
[14:23.760 --> 14:28.240]  you don't like getting cancer, you don't like dying, you don't like having convulsions,
[14:28.240 --> 14:34.480]  you don't like getting sterilized, you don't like becoming totally allergic
[14:34.480 --> 14:41.200]  to every coronavirus out there is what most experts say this is going to do, what are they
[14:41.200 --> 14:46.480]  going to do when fabulous numbers of people are dying from the common cold from an auto immune
[14:46.480 --> 14:51.760]  response just like the 1917 flu with an influenza virus, it's the same thing, they're going to call
[14:51.760 --> 15:00.320]  it COVID 20, 21, 22, 23, that's the plan and that's why virologists and top scientists have said
[15:00.320 --> 15:08.000]  this is going to actually trigger people to die and even the FDA says well it might make COVID
[15:08.000 --> 15:14.640]  worse when you take the vaccine, when you come into contact with the COVID again, just what Wolf
[15:14.640 --> 15:24.000]  King Wudarg, the head of the EU advisory commission and the former head of Pfizer wrote that lawsuit
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.360]  on December 1st and filed it in the EU as an injunction against this damn vaccine and they
[15:29.360 --> 15:34.400]  didn't block it and they say right there top scientists tell us this will probably cause an
[15:34.400 --> 15:39.200]  auto immune response like the 1917 flu and kill people not from the virus with the auto immune
[15:39.200 --> 15:43.840]  response you're going to give people an allergic response the common flu and the common cold what
[15:43.840 --> 15:49.040]  the hell are you doing well we know what they're doing they're coming to kill us and that's the
[15:49.040 --> 15:59.040]  facts too able to fail that's the plan my god anti-price world government system is here the resistance
[15:59.040 --> 16:08.240]  not video the resistance not video the resistance not video the resistance not video the resistance
[16:08.240 --> 16:18.560]  not video the resistance not video info wars.com news wars.com band.video and hundreds of other
[16:18.560 --> 16:25.040]  other URLs we've launched have been banned. That's why every month we launch a new URL
[16:25.040 --> 16:31.600]  before they ban it. But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail. But the
[16:31.600 --> 16:40.720]  new website is TheResistance.video. They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful
[16:40.720 --> 16:46.600]  and can defeat them. So the new URL that links right to banned.video and all of our videos
[16:46.600 --> 16:50.800]  and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information
[16:50.800 --> 16:58.000]  is at TheResistance.video. Share the link. TheResistance.video. TheResistance.video.
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.280]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[17:03.280 --> 17:08.880]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[17:08.880 --> 17:15.160]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com. Studies have
[17:15.160 --> 17:21.080]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[17:21.080 --> 17:26.680]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction
[17:26.680 --> 17:33.160]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested
[17:33.160 --> 17:40.240]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[17:40.240 --> 17:46.400]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and
[17:46.400 --> 17:52.760]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for
[17:52.760 --> 17:57.800]  a friend, family member or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[17:57.800 --> 18:11.320]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[18:11.320 --> 18:39.840]  We are now live in the year 2021. I want to give the number out and I want to take your
[18:39.840 --> 18:45.440]  phone calls specifically on what do you think we should do in the year 2021 to take back
[18:45.440 --> 18:52.040]  our liberties. I say we stop complying with the mass mandates. We start filing lawsuits
[18:52.040 --> 18:56.980]  on businesses and companies that try to make their employees wear them. I say everybody
[18:56.980 --> 19:01.720]  should be filing lawsuits and doing boycotts of companies that try to make their employees
[19:01.720 --> 19:07.240]  take these toxic inoculations. We should call for Congress to strip the vaccine liability
[19:07.240 --> 19:15.080]  protection laws of 1986 out and make these companies be liable. I think we should strip
[19:15.080 --> 19:21.040]  Section 230 that Trump's trying to do out of big tech so that they can't operate as
[19:21.040 --> 19:26.560]  these monopoly combines. There's so much we need to discuss what needs to be done. And
[19:26.560 --> 19:31.680]  I think in the year 2021, Trump needs to level the American people that he thought this was
[19:31.680 --> 19:36.520]  a regular vaccine and he thought that he was trying to get the economy going again and
[19:36.520 --> 19:40.800]  didn't understand that this was designed to never allow the economy to operate. And they
[19:40.800 --> 19:44.800]  now admit that the vaccine quote won't even protect you from COVID and will actually make
[19:44.800 --> 19:50.920]  you get sicker. That's such an incredible fine print admission that Trump needs to get
[19:50.920 --> 19:57.240]  this millstone that he taught around our neck and his neck off of us and he needs to reverse
[19:57.240 --> 20:04.400]  the biggest single failure is going along with this whole vaccine situation. And Trump
[20:04.400 --> 20:10.920]  also needs to admit that he didn't do enough to go after the massive systemic censorship
[20:10.920 --> 20:20.400]  and racketeering cartel activities of big tech working together as a combine, as a oligopoly
[20:20.400 --> 20:28.240]  to suppress competition. That is absolutely illegal and is beyond just running major trust
[20:28.240 --> 20:34.360]  operations, major monopoly operations. But what else needs to be done? What is your declaration?
[20:34.360 --> 20:48.040]  Of independence in the year 2021? 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX, first time callers,
[20:48.040 --> 20:52.440]  long time callers and I will put nurses or doctors that call in at the headline just
[20:52.440 --> 21:01.720]  tell us 877-789-2539. I got a lot of footage of cops now being arrested for slamming men
[21:01.720 --> 21:06.440]  and women down who aren't wearing masks in public. Good, arrest them, that's assault.
[21:06.440 --> 21:11.360]  We've got footage of police following people home that aren't wearing their masks, a lot
[21:11.360 --> 21:15.440]  of sickening virtue signaling. We need to put major pressure on the police to follow
[21:15.440 --> 21:19.560]  the Constitution and Bill of Rights and point out that the very same leftists pushing this
[21:19.560 --> 21:23.960]  hoax are the ones that want to take control of the police and put them under the United
[21:23.960 --> 21:30.480]  Nations. So I'm pro-police when they're pro-law in order and pro-constitution but when they
[21:30.480 --> 21:37.440]  become globalist minders and violate that oath they become enemies of the Republic.
[21:37.440 --> 21:44.960]  That doesn't mean we shoot them in the head like Black Lives Matter or Antifa but we
[21:44.960 --> 21:50.200]  shoot them with truth and information and education and reality and we put pressure
[21:50.200 --> 21:54.960]  on their bosses and pressure on the legislatures to make sure that they understand the big
[21:54.960 --> 22:00.520]  picture. Because the police just want to comply. That's why you look at Black neighborhoods,
[22:00.520 --> 22:03.520]  the crime rates have exploded because the cops won't go in there now in the poor Black
[22:03.520 --> 22:08.280]  neighborhoods because they don't want to make a mistake and get arrested or put in prison.
[22:08.280 --> 22:12.960]  It's the same thing, cops go, oh, I'm supposed to tackle somebody who isn't wearing a mask
[22:12.960 --> 22:17.040]  at the mall but a Black Lives Matter comes in here and knocks out windows, I'm not supposed
[22:17.040 --> 22:22.880]  to arrest them. That's showing you how the police are political creatures like anything
[22:22.880 --> 22:28.640]  else and we need to stand up and not just blindly support the police, we need to support
[22:28.640 --> 22:33.000]  the police when they support the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. So that's another
[22:33.000 --> 22:42.600]  big issue we need to be breaking down at 877-789-2539. But of course they had a fake study that
[22:42.600 --> 22:46.800]  oh and Black Lives Matter marched by the millions, they didn't contribute to COVID, they actually
[22:46.800 --> 22:51.600]  made it better but when you have a church service it's bad. This is the type of ridiculous
[22:51.600 --> 22:58.320]  gaslighting the system puts in our faces. Now again, Roger Stone is going to join us
[22:58.320 --> 23:03.880]  talking about the big rallies coming up the 5th and 6th, what he thinks Trump's strategy
[23:03.880 --> 23:10.080]  should be to win, how big it is, this date on the 6th. When we do have over 140 House
[23:10.080 --> 23:14.440]  members and senators that are going to try to block the seating of these delegates from
[23:14.440 --> 23:20.440]  five states, this is going to go into an incredible constitutional crisis and to lay that out
[23:20.440 --> 23:27.000]  we then have constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes joining us in the third hour, then
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.840]  Dale Bigtree popping in on the deadly vaccines and the rally they've got coming up on the
[23:31.840 --> 23:38.720]  6th of D.C. as well and then Dr. Nick Begge. So quite a transmission lined up for you
[23:38.720 --> 23:48.600]  on the first broadcast of 2021. January 1st, 2021, we are here. When we come back I'm going
[23:48.600 --> 23:54.160]  to go right to your phone calls and then I'm going to get into this in the final segment.
[23:54.160 --> 23:58.600]  Wuhan locals pack the streets to celebrate New Year's as the rest of the world suffers
[23:58.600 --> 24:03.800]  under COVID lockdowns. All they do is set the PCR test to say there's no COVID. They
[24:03.800 --> 24:10.680]  now say China is COVID free. Who believes that? Absolute total communist crap. They
[24:10.680 --> 24:14.920]  can turn their economy on, they can turn their economy off, they can make up whatever statistics
[24:14.920 --> 24:22.880]  they want. That's why the Canadian Prime Minister said he admires communist China's dictatorship
[24:22.880 --> 24:32.640]  and wants that for Canada. 2021 is the year when humanity must go on the offensive against
[24:32.640 --> 24:39.560]  globalism. 2021 is the year when humanity must go on offense against globalism. Five
[24:39.560 --> 24:54.480]  New Year's show is live. That's how we reach new people. That's how we stay on air. That's
[24:54.480 --> 25:00.680]  how we override the globalist. And I can't tell you how many people. I was on with Tim
[25:00.680 --> 25:07.440]  Dillon last night for an hour on his very popular podcast, Millions of Viewers. And
[25:07.440 --> 25:13.280]  he had a guest host who was listening to me 10, 15 years ago and he said, but when you
[25:13.280 --> 25:18.360]  got de-platformed, I thought you were off air and didn't know you were on air. How many
[25:18.360 --> 25:23.880]  callers yesterday? Three callers brought that up on air yesterday. They said, Alex, when
[25:23.880 --> 25:28.080]  you got de-platformed three years ago, I thought you were off the air. Think of that mind control.
[25:28.080 --> 25:33.840]  Like a Jedi mind trick. Alex Jones is off the air now. Alex Jones has failed. Alex
[25:33.840 --> 25:39.320]  Jones lost a lawsuit. None of that was even true. Alex Jones is gone. And there we are
[25:39.320 --> 25:46.520]  on hundreds of radio stations and TV stations and a huge audience at infowars.com and newswars.com
[25:46.520 --> 25:52.240]  that now is many times bigger than it ever was. Our hardcore audience at Band-Ought Video
[25:52.240 --> 25:57.000]  at infowars.com is three, four, five times depending on the day, what it was then. Before
[25:57.000 --> 26:03.240]  we were distributed out there, huge on Facebook, huge on Twitter, huge on YouTube, but then
[26:03.240 --> 26:10.560]  they crossed us down to here, like, you know, sending us off to be in exile. And that which
[26:10.560 --> 26:14.800]  doesn't kill us only makes us stronger because of you. You are the resistance. You are the
[26:14.800 --> 26:19.800]  info war and you absolutely blow them away. And so you're the hardcore audience that knows
[26:19.800 --> 26:23.680]  we're on air and knows we should have URLs. We should have our own websites. The answer
[26:23.680 --> 26:29.880]  to all the censorship and all the centralization, all this control is to build our own systems.
[26:29.880 --> 26:33.440]  You've got our other social media networks and things like that, like Polar, they're
[26:33.440 --> 26:38.680]  exploding. That's great. But you need media production houses with researchers and journalists
[26:38.680 --> 26:44.000]  and camera crews and analysts and legal advice to be able to put on a resistance to the globalist.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.880]  And that's why the brain trust at his info wars is so precious. And thank you for the
[26:47.880 --> 26:52.600]  bottom of my heart for keeping us on the air into the year 2021. This is the house you
[26:52.600 --> 26:56.720]  built and I thank you and salute you.
[26:56.720 --> 27:04.600]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden. And now that all the
[27:04.600 --> 27:13.400]  lies are being revealed, what will you do? We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[27:13.400 --> 27:19.800]  They will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a virtue. It is the patriots
[27:19.800 --> 27:27.840]  of the world versus everybody else. I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the
[27:27.840 --> 27:34.360]  Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I
[27:34.360 --> 27:40.920]  will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, that I take this obligation freely without
[27:40.920 --> 27:47.200]  any mental reservation or purpose of evasion. And that I will well and faithfully discharge
[27:47.200 --> 27:56.200]  my duties as best as I can. So help me God. Infowars.com, band.video.
[27:56.200 --> 28:00.880]  Inflation is here and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming, especially
[28:00.880 --> 28:05.680]  if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar. Tens of millions of Americans
[28:05.680 --> 28:10.640]  that were not awake are now beginning to store food. That's a good thing, but it's
[28:10.640 --> 28:16.120]  going to drive up prices and we're already beginning to see record sales once again.
[28:16.120 --> 28:20.720]  We the people understand it's up to us to protect ourselves. It's up to us to become
[28:20.720 --> 28:26.560]  self-sufficient. The globalists are waging siege against us, trying to destroy our businesses,
[28:26.560 --> 28:31.520]  trying to bankrupt our families, our towns, our churches. That's why while we still can,
[28:31.520 --> 28:37.800]  we've got to get prepared and get ready. Take advantage of a huge final mega sale before
[28:37.800 --> 28:44.840]  prices go up and prepare with Alex.com and save up to $850 off the highest quality storeable
[28:44.840 --> 28:50.600]  foods out there. You've got until Friday, January 8th to get your orders in and prepare
[28:50.600 --> 28:55.680]  with Alex.com and lock in the lowest prices out there on high-quality storeable food.
[28:55.680 --> 29:00.560]  Three, two, one, here we go. It's back in stock. It's been sold out for over eight months.
[29:00.560 --> 29:04.080]  We couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock. Let me tell you a
[29:04.080 --> 29:08.080]  real quick about it. But the power of quail egg concentrate, pollen block acts differently.
[29:08.080 --> 29:11.880]  The traditional antihistamines that was clinically studied alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[29:11.880 --> 29:16.440]  by helping to clear sinus passages and eating respiratory function. It's amazing. Folks
[29:16.440 --> 29:20.640]  absolutely love it. And again, France has been shut down, so we couldn't get it. Now
[29:20.640 --> 29:27.160]  a limited supply is back in stock, 25% off at infowarsstore.com. Pollen block, again,
[29:27.160 --> 29:31.160]  is available in this one minute ad. I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe
[29:31.160 --> 29:35.560]  me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally unlike some of the stuff
[29:35.560 --> 29:40.360]  that's over the counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache.
[29:40.360 --> 29:45.040]  This is naturally occurring. It's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress
[29:45.040 --> 29:50.480]  and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us. You chew up the pills, they taste great.
[29:50.480 --> 30:17.640]  It's available again at infowarsstore.com. Pollen block, infowarsstore.com. You're listening
[30:17.640 --> 30:33.240]  to the Alex Jones show. Rise it up, my friends, not laying down. You get stronger when you
[30:33.240 --> 30:38.680]  fight back, not weaker. It's the animating contest of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked
[30:38.680 --> 30:46.200]  about. I could have chosen to be a victim under all the lawsuits, the lies, the physical
[30:46.200 --> 30:51.960]  attacks, the censorship, the demonization. Instead, I took the bull by the horns. You
[30:51.960 --> 30:56.440]  steadfastly did the same thing and we're here stronger than ever. God bless you all. Okay.
[30:58.760 --> 31:04.520]  We're going to go to Dennis and Greg and Jason and Tim and Adam and Chase and John and Michael
[31:04.520 --> 31:10.040]  and Brian, everybody else. Here in just about 30 seconds, but I want to say this one more time.
[31:10.040 --> 31:15.320]  You turn on any television set. You turn on any radio. You hear, take your vaccine. It's
[31:15.320 --> 31:21.080]  wonderful. It's perfect. It never hurts anybody. Do it. Do it. Do it. This is a giant globalist
[31:21.080 --> 31:25.320]  takeover to set the precedent, to put in our bodies what they want, when they want. This is
[31:25.320 --> 31:29.080]  the whole world government agenda. This is the mark of the beast. This is the tracking system.
[31:29.080 --> 31:36.600]  This is it. And yes, Trump has failed at this critical juncture on this critical issue. He has
[31:36.600 --> 31:41.320]  gone along with it. And I thought he was doing that to take control of the agenda from him,
[31:41.320 --> 31:46.520]  to get things unlocked, which partially they done. And I understand that Trump's not a scientist.
[31:46.520 --> 31:50.600]  It doesn't matter. Trump won the election. The Democrats are trying to steal it. They want him
[31:50.600 --> 31:56.520]  out of the way because Joe Biden is 500 times worse. So I support Trump. The Bidens are literal,
[31:56.520 --> 32:02.840]  mentally ill demons who can't even, you know, get a confetti popper to go. They're perfect
[32:02.840 --> 32:10.280]  puppets. That's coming up. But we need to put pressure on Trump with 19 days left in office
[32:10.280 --> 32:15.080]  to wake the hell up about these vaccines. All right, let's go to your calls. Let's talk to Jason
[32:15.080 --> 32:20.280]  in Oregon. What are you planning to do? Or what do you think's coming in 2021? Because it's not
[32:20.280 --> 32:26.520]  coming. It's here. Good morning, Alex. So good to be on with you again. Just want to let you know
[32:26.520 --> 32:31.960]  I used to call in as Jason from Germany, but I had to get my family out of Germany, brought him
[32:31.960 --> 32:36.520]  back to the States after Trump was reelected because I remember he'd been calling for what four or
[32:36.520 --> 32:40.760]  five years. Yes, sir. I've been listening longer than that, but I had to get my family out because
[32:40.760 --> 32:47.080]  of the invasion, which you're well aware of and the Islamic invasion. Yes, sir. I brought my family
[32:47.080 --> 32:52.040]  here back to my home state of Oregon, which I love and wanted to put down roots in. Unfortunately,
[32:52.040 --> 32:57.640]  as you know, it didn't work out here. The West Coast appears to be become have become aligned
[32:57.640 --> 33:02.840]  with Chinese interests more than anything else with the shutdown here of acting as an economic
[33:02.840 --> 33:07.720]  block to destroy people's lives. Oh, China brags. They say, invest here. We control the upper
[33:07.720 --> 33:13.000]  circles of the U.S. They will never reopen. Never. They say we will, and they laugh, and they're
[33:13.000 --> 33:19.240]  not wearing masks, partying, totally open laughing at us. That's right. So anyway, we're moving out
[33:19.240 --> 33:24.360]  to Texas, man. Maybe one of these days we'll actually see each other. But I look at Texas as
[33:24.360 --> 33:29.560]  this is kind of the last stand for freedom lovers. You know, I agree because Tucker Carlson had the
[33:29.560 --> 33:33.800]  governor on a few days ago, and a lot of people are dumb that are moving here don't know why they
[33:33.800 --> 33:37.800]  show they're running from themselves. But I'd say more than half the people coming are running from
[33:37.800 --> 33:42.680]  the communism, from the socialism, from the globalism, from the Islamification. And so Texas
[33:42.680 --> 33:47.880]  isn't perfect, but it is shaping up to kind of be the last stand in the future. Well, I think it's
[33:47.880 --> 33:52.680]  time for people that patriots and freedom lovers to start building their own systems, as we've
[33:52.680 --> 33:57.960]  talked about before on your show, building community building co-ops with each other,
[33:57.960 --> 34:00.360]  creating separate systems that cannot be controlled.
[34:02.360 --> 34:06.440]  I agree. In the future, we need to build communities, media organizations,
[34:06.440 --> 34:10.840]  medical systems, legal systems that are separate from the Babylonian
[34:10.840 --> 34:17.320]  world government satanic order. Thank you so much. You know, I was looking at one of the video
[34:17.320 --> 34:23.720]  thumbnails on Band-Aught Video. I forget the exact headline. Guys go to Band-Aught Video and it's
[34:23.720 --> 34:35.400]  of an ancient European drawing of the devil from the Dark Ages for the Middle Ages, eating a baby.
[34:35.400 --> 34:40.120]  There it is. Now, you can go back 3,000 years and see paintings of the devil in
[34:40.120 --> 34:48.120]  China, in Greece, in Egypt, and then, you know, later into the Roman Empire and then into Christendom.
[34:48.120 --> 34:52.120]  And it's always the same. A horned god eating babies.
[34:53.640 --> 34:57.960]  And you go, oh, that's just back in the past. No. The whole system is about aborting babies,
[34:57.960 --> 35:02.600]  killing babies, killing our genetics, killing the fruit of us, killing our future.
[35:02.600 --> 35:05.960]  Children are the symbol of the future. The devil wants to destroy your future. So let's
[35:05.960 --> 35:12.040]  let's put that back on screen. We're facing the same spirit that we were facing back then.
[35:14.920 --> 35:19.560]  And in every ancient drawing of the devil, it's eating children and or drinking their blood
[35:19.560 --> 35:26.520]  and tearing them limb from limb. Okay. So that's its goal. What's the goal here? Total destruction.
[35:29.400 --> 35:32.200]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Adam in Florida. Adam, thank you for holding.
[35:32.200 --> 35:37.800]  Alex, thanks for letting me call back to the other day. I got, you cut me off. I was kind of
[35:37.800 --> 35:43.560]  being, you know, sarcastic, but serious about Hunter Biden. And he did have. No, no, I apologize.
[35:43.560 --> 35:46.520]  I was in a really bad mood and just kind of snapped on you for no reason. Go ahead.
[35:47.400 --> 35:51.480]  Well, I want to give you some credit for, first off, I know it's a little off subject, but
[35:51.480 --> 35:56.600]  you would be one of the best preachers if you could just take like maybe like, I don't know,
[35:56.600 --> 36:01.880]  what day you do it on, but maybe once a week, once a month. But you were the person that got me
[36:01.880 --> 36:07.800]  through politics to finally accept Jesus as my savior. And I'm not, I'm not trying to say that
[36:07.800 --> 36:14.040]  to be silly. It's really true. It was first politics, but I did realize that it's about,
[36:14.040 --> 36:19.720]  you know, before we wrestle not with against flesh and blood against principalities, powers,
[36:19.720 --> 36:24.920]  you know, how it goes, you know, so. Well, brother, I mean, I'm just like you. We're all the same.
[36:24.920 --> 36:28.840]  And I have a connection to God, even though I'm a sinner and I have the Holy Spirit and people
[36:28.840 --> 36:34.360]  recognize that it's energetic. It's spiritual. You recognize it in me. I recognize it in you.
[36:34.360 --> 36:38.280]  And that is the congregation coming together. The problem is you go to most of these churches,
[36:38.280 --> 36:43.800]  the Holy Spirit's not there. It's people wanting to come together, but there's a spirit over it
[36:43.800 --> 36:49.000]  wanting to control it. So the devil's greatest toehold is these fake churches who aren't seeing
[36:49.000 --> 36:54.200]  a word about the world government, the mark of the beast to buy and sell. They're bringing the QR
[36:54.200 --> 36:59.560]  codes in. They're doing the thermometer test. They're going along with it most of them, but
[36:59.560 --> 37:04.760]  it's also real churches around the country like Rodney Howard Brown and others that are leading
[37:04.760 --> 37:08.680]  the fight against it. So the church is real. You just got to find a real one.
[37:09.480 --> 37:13.160]  Just thinking at the end of the day, you could win some souls, but that's not really why I called.
[37:14.040 --> 37:18.680]  I was, you know, Hunter Biden, he's going to have his art exhibition. He's, you know,
[37:18.680 --> 37:25.400]  do you hear that coming up? You got, you know, it's rotten, it's porn hub channel. And I wonder
[37:25.400 --> 37:30.040]  how that's just going to go away. If the media is really just going to keep ignoring it, you know,
[37:30.040 --> 37:36.200]  I couldn't imagine if it was really all about the new world order offers corrupt people false
[37:36.200 --> 37:43.640]  salvation and to act with impunity, commit whatever crimes, run sex rings, torture people,
[37:43.640 --> 37:49.480]  be a pedophile, be a traitor. That's what this is all about is being our club and we will give
[37:49.480 --> 37:55.640]  you protection, but really it just brings down the whole civilization. Think like back in 2008,
[37:55.640 --> 38:01.080]  when we went from Bush to Obama, there was like a crash. I remember with the economy,
[38:01.080 --> 38:06.600]  I felt like maybe they crashed it down. So Obama would have credit for building it back.
[38:07.160 --> 38:12.840]  I wonder if they're going to have this dark winter thing play out here between February,
[38:12.840 --> 38:17.160]  you know, because we don't have much winter left. Is it going to go February to March? Real hard
[38:17.160 --> 38:22.680]  time. Biden gets credit for building back from the bottom after they, they burn it down. You
[38:22.680 --> 38:27.720]  know what I mean? I wonder, I think that's one of their plans, but they're going to announce they
[38:27.720 --> 38:32.360]  fixed it while at the same time. Once these people get you down and get their hands around your neck,
[38:32.360 --> 38:37.160]  they never want to let loose. The whole goal was always to make us poor. The whole goal was always
[38:37.160 --> 38:42.360]  to kill kids. The whole goal was always to bring us to our knees. So do they ever take their boot
[38:42.360 --> 38:47.080]  off the blue cities? No. Do they ever take their boot off the third world? No. They ever take their
[38:47.080 --> 38:52.360]  boot off Africa? No. And so I don't think the boots ever coming off. In fact, they've said that.
[38:52.360 --> 38:56.840]  They're all going to get more rich. They're all going to be more powerful. But for the general
[38:56.840 --> 39:01.560]  public, I think things are going to get far worse. Thank you for the call. We're going to go to
[39:01.560 --> 39:06.280]  break. Come back with more calls and I'll get into all of the vaccine news, all the election news.
[39:06.280 --> 39:10.200]  Roger Stone is coming up separately. We've got a lot of products that are now back in stock.
[39:10.200 --> 39:16.200]  Well, thank you for your support. Without you, we won't be here. Pollen Block is a natural anti-allergy

[39:30.120 --> 39:33.800]  been sold out for eight months. The supply chains broke down. Pollen Block is back in stock at

[40:41.720 --> 40:47.560]  year 2021 is here and I am committed to you to fight against the globalist harder than ever.
[40:47.560 --> 40:51.720]  So thank you so much for keeping info warrants in the fight without your support. We couldn't do
[40:51.720 --> 40:58.920]  any on it. The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance
[40:58.920 --> 41:03.960]  to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United
[41:03.960 --> 41:07.800]  Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a
[41:07.800 --> 41:14.200]  chip under your skin. It's all now completely official part of the UN great reset of the Debo
[41:14.200 --> 41:19.720]  Scoop and Cloud Schwab all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller
[41:19.720 --> 41:24.840]  Foundation, all the rest of them at 10 to 21, at 10 to 20 30. It's here and only gets worse
[41:24.840 --> 41:28.920]  like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[41:30.600 --> 41:35.000]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, good versus evil
[41:35.000 --> 41:40.840]  and stopping abortion. We must start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we
[41:40.840 --> 41:47.800]  are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that, we are
[41:47.800 --> 41:52.440]  all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic God given human rights now.
[41:56.200 --> 42:01.800]  The Post Industrial World, that's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the
[42:02.600 --> 42:11.480]  Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992. Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post
[42:11.480 --> 42:15.720]  industrial world, Cloud Schwab, the Debo's group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada,
[42:15.720 --> 42:22.520]  their own record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030. Well, you might want to find out what
[42:22.520 --> 42:29.160]  Agenda 2030 is. It is the destruction of society as we know it. It is making the population poor
[42:29.160 --> 42:35.320]  by designs. We can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family. They're
[42:35.320 --> 42:43.480]  destroying civilization, rebuild it in their dystopic image. We are fighting this at InfoWars.com
[42:43.480 --> 42:49.160]  and NewsWars.com. We are fighting for a pro-human future and we need you to get the facts, to
[42:49.160 --> 42:54.040]  research it and share it with others and join the fight. God bless you. Visit us, spread the word
[42:54.040 --> 43:01.240]  at InfoWars.com. Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best

[43:05.720 --> 43:12.200]  forever, but after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us. The rest,
[43:12.200 --> 43:18.520]  they hope in a few months, comes in. It's a proprietary system using specially fed quail and

[43:52.600 --> 44:12.600]  InfoWars.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:12.600 --> 44:25.560]  Well, it was 11 months ago, we saw the city's lockdown,
[44:25.560 --> 44:29.480]  who'd been welded into their homes, been in hazmat suits, women being shot in the head at
[44:29.480 --> 44:35.160]  checkpoints, people just randomly falling down everywhere. And all of it was fake,
[44:35.160 --> 44:40.920]  all that was theater included with people racing them with stretchers into hospitals,
[44:40.920 --> 44:45.720]  and then you'd see the camera director waving everyone, people having convulsions,
[44:45.720 --> 44:50.360]  why it was the end of the world, five percent death rates, two and a half million Americans
[44:50.360 --> 44:56.760]  will be dead within months. And then we saw the fake hospitals with the actors going in and out
[44:56.760 --> 45:05.400]  in circles. We saw it all. Then a few months in, they said, oh, the whole country is unlocked now,
[45:06.840 --> 45:10.520]  and now they don't wear their mask, and here's some footage, we'll go ahead and roll this with
[45:10.520 --> 45:17.800]  audio of the New Year's celebration in Wuhan and all over China last night. They're open for business
[45:17.800 --> 45:33.240]  and we aren't. But if you look at Times Square, or you look at the Seattle Space Needle,
[45:34.200 --> 45:39.080]  no one's allowed out on the street, martial law, they tried that in Austin, the governor said it
[45:39.080 --> 45:48.040]  was illegal, and they showed a giant virus with huge super complex Operation Bluebeam.
[45:48.040 --> 45:53.240]  You ever wanted to know what Operation Bluebeam looks like? That's it. Now they roll out all
[45:53.240 --> 45:58.120]  the advanced technology. Now they roll it out. They show you a giant virus opening up like an
[45:58.120 --> 46:05.800]  alien flower and a huge moth being released and spewing out viruses. They're letting you know,
[46:05.800 --> 46:15.560]  you ain't in Kansas anymore. That's from King Five Television. The same thing in New York,
[46:15.560 --> 46:21.400]  same thing in London, same thing in Germany. You're not allowed to have those fireworks, folks.
[46:22.040 --> 46:26.840]  You're gonna have all that virtual reality. Oh, but some people still showed up, so they stuck
[46:26.840 --> 46:32.920]  them to person to a pin. If they signed up and registered, a few lucky people were allowed to
[46:32.920 --> 46:41.080]  go to New York. And again, going to Seattle looks like aliens are invading, releasing their viruses,
[46:41.080 --> 46:47.960]  releasing their 5G antennas to then microwave everyone, then now releasing all these new life
[46:47.960 --> 46:55.000]  forms that are flying around and invading us. Part of this was declassified in the 90s,
[46:55.000 --> 46:59.160]  that they had a multi-million dollar program with giant hologram machines that could show
[46:59.160 --> 47:07.720]  up to 2,000 foot tall alien spacecraft. Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, and reportedly did some of this
[47:07.720 --> 47:15.480]  in the first Iraq war, making a bunch of Iraqis give up and wave their arms and say, we will submit.
[47:17.960 --> 47:26.040]  So imagine, ladies and gentlemen, 2,000 foot tall jellyfish swimming around over Seattle.
[47:26.040 --> 47:30.840]  You're a radio listener. That's the video at infowars.com. We've got the video posted.
[47:32.840 --> 47:38.440]  In fact, have this video posted in the live show Feed Area of the show today where we talk about
[47:38.440 --> 47:43.880]  taking the world back from globalists in 2020. So this is all the stuff they didn't tell you they
[47:43.880 --> 47:49.640]  had, all the stuff that really nobody knew was there. I told you 16 years ago that a friend of
[47:49.640 --> 47:54.600]  mine is a big movie producer was talking to James Cameron. And James Cameron said, yeah,
[47:54.600 --> 47:58.120]  we were going to roll out new movie theaters where you sit in a circle around it and it's a
[47:58.120 --> 48:02.440]  hologram. But the decision was made in the future. There won't even be movies anymore.
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.080]  So I'm moving to New Zealand for the end of the world. And I'm going to get all these ships and
[48:07.080 --> 48:12.920]  things so that it looks like I can write it off as an ocean oceanic researcher. But really,
[48:12.920 --> 48:19.000]  in case even New Zealand falls, I've got a fleet of ships during the population operation.
[48:19.000 --> 48:25.960]  Remember, I told you that 15, 16 years ago. And now he admits basically all of that.
[48:27.720 --> 48:34.040]  And so imagine all the technology they've got. Life extension, you name it. They've got mRNA
[48:34.040 --> 48:42.200]  programming that does kill cancer. They've got gene therapy that 100% knocks out colon cancer.
[48:42.200 --> 48:45.560]  They've got it that knocks out lung cancer. They've got it that knocks out brain cancer.
[48:45.560 --> 48:50.360]  You're not going to get it. You know what you get? Look at that big,
[48:50.360 --> 48:56.760]  illuminati pyramid. Heaven's gate deal. I mean, this is, this is signaling
[48:56.760 --> 49:01.320]  for the cosmos to bring in, look at that. Now the space scene, it looks like a flying saucer.
[49:02.120 --> 49:05.800]  See how it's all been pre-planned generation for generation for the rollout. Now they say
[49:05.800 --> 49:09.160]  in a year and a half, they're going to release all the secret contact with alien information.
[49:09.880 --> 49:12.840]  They're going to tell you they didn't cover the star system. They came inter-dimensionally.
[49:12.840 --> 49:15.320]  But it's really a demonic invasion.
[49:18.440 --> 49:22.680]  All the super technology can be given to you. All the life extension. You've just got to pledge
[49:22.680 --> 49:28.440]  allegiance to the world leader. What did I tell you yesterday? How they'll go to the public commons
[49:28.440 --> 49:33.640]  and they'll go to the public squares and they'll go to the obelisk and they will project the image
[49:33.640 --> 49:38.680]  of the beast and everyone will worship the image of the beast and everyone worldwide will see the
[49:38.680 --> 49:45.160]  beast at the same time because it will appear in their markets and their temples and their
[49:45.160 --> 49:51.000]  synagogues. This is, this is the Bible and they will worship. Let's go back to 2012
[49:52.920 --> 50:02.440]  at the Olympics in London, a 100 foot tall grim reaper with Mary Poppins descending
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.280]  by the hundreds as grim reapers, taking the children and putting them in beds and injecting
[50:08.280 --> 50:17.160]  them and then they die. And then the grim reaper takes them up to hell. Up to hell you see the
[50:17.160 --> 50:22.920]  sky. And here come the nurses. They're the army. They're the force. They're the NIH. And there are
[50:22.920 --> 50:28.840]  the children soon to have gags, but on their faces, medical sharia law. And here comes Mary Poppins,
[50:28.840 --> 50:35.720]  now a witch in a dark uniform, an agent born out of the loins of the angel of death, the grim reaper.
[50:35.720 --> 50:43.080]  And now the children will be lifted up into the mouth of the grim reaper. Oh, it's so liberal.
[50:43.880 --> 50:49.400]  As long as you, like New York and other states, keep the babies comfortable. We say legally,
[50:49.400 --> 50:54.120]  they don't live even though we keep them alive until all the orders come in. And then we take
[50:54.120 --> 51:02.200]  their organs because it's liberal. And now they're coming with the mRNA vaccine.
[51:02.200 --> 51:07.160]  I mean, now they're coming with the mRNA vaccine to take over your entire body.
[51:09.720 --> 51:14.040]  So the grim reaper comes down with as Mary Poppins collapses into a pile on the floor
[51:14.600 --> 51:19.800]  and like Salem's lot, then rises back up and gathers the children unto death.
[51:21.080 --> 51:27.080]  Oh, these are the good guys. These are the Nambla people. These are the Jeffrey Epstein people.
[51:27.080 --> 51:32.760]  These are the controllers that think they own you and your family. And now it's coming out from
[51:32.760 --> 51:39.240]  Linwood and others, what we already knew about Chief Justice Roberts and his connections to child
[51:39.240 --> 51:46.280]  kidnapping rings and the Clintons and the disappearing children. And it's all coming out,
[51:46.280 --> 51:50.920]  but they're telling you in their symphony of death as the grim reaper,
[51:50.920 --> 51:57.480]  because I'm sorry, a 200 foot tall grim reaper is a conductor who now conducts
[51:58.040 --> 52:02.120]  the children floating off the ground up into its arms.
[52:04.520 --> 52:06.600]  Why is this what they're throwing on our face?
[52:09.080 --> 52:11.400]  Oh yes, here comes more grim reapers to scoop up the children.
[52:12.920 --> 52:14.840]  So let's continue, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:14.840 --> 52:26.600]  They're partying hard. They're having a great time as the drones fly in the robot drones
[52:26.600 --> 52:31.720]  with more little grim reapers to then pick the children up and take them to their deaths.
[52:31.720 --> 52:37.720]  And the children are so happy. They go, thank you, death. Thank you. Take me. Kill me. And parents
[52:37.720 --> 52:43.080]  all sit there watching the six spectacle and billions watching on TV. And you know it's creepy.
[52:43.080 --> 52:46.040]  You know it's bad. Your subconscious knows what it is.
[52:48.760 --> 52:53.640]  And they're telling you this is a mass human sacrifice ritual as we take your children.
[52:56.200 --> 53:04.680]  Go to band.video. See the ancient middle ages, 800 year old carving of the devil eating a child.
[53:05.240 --> 53:09.880]  And now what do you see at the space needle? Now what do you see at the Olympics?
[53:09.880 --> 53:14.680]  Now what do you see for real? Now what do you see coming with the mRNA vaccine?
[53:14.680 --> 53:20.200]  Death, sacrifice of your genetics, sacrifice of your fertility, sacrifice of your health.
[53:22.040 --> 53:30.440]  The very takeover of your body in a giant genetic ritual with what they cooked up
[53:30.440 --> 53:37.720]  with full clone genomes of jellyfish and humans injected taking over every cell in your body
[53:37.720 --> 53:42.120]  cell by cell. And by the time you figure out you've been hit by it, you don't know what hit you.
[53:43.320 --> 53:46.520]  All right, Brian, Michael, John, everybody, we're going to your calls. We come back.
[53:46.520 --> 53:50.200]  Then it's six after stones on for a couple of segments and I'll go back to your calls.
[53:50.200 --> 53:56.040]  Then Robert Barnes is coming up. This is not a game. Fight back with what God gave us vitamin D
[53:56.040 --> 54:01.480]  three, winter sun in stock. Fight back with DNA force plus for your mitochondria and your
[54:01.480 --> 54:06.600]  telomeres back in stock. Fight back with pollen block that God gave us through these Quellex,
[54:06.600 --> 54:11.400]  info or store.com, but mainly fight back by praying and getting close to God and realizing
[54:11.400 --> 54:16.600]  it's okay. The devil's a failure and will always fail. And this is only a test we're going through,
[54:16.600 --> 54:21.960]  but we've got to be true. So hold fast info or store.com in the new year want to thank you all
[54:21.960 --> 54:26.120]  for your support. Want to ask you to pledge in the new year to spread the word about info wars
[54:26.120 --> 54:30.200]  and other great outlets of truth and to support those outlets now more than ever. We're getting
[54:30.200 --> 54:37.640]  great products info or store.com X2 as soon as I tell you back in stock 50% off living defense
[54:37.640 --> 54:46.840]  discounted as well. The sales won't last long. The best product I'm not supposed to be biased,
[54:46.840 --> 54:50.520]  but I'm going to tell you all now if you haven't tried turbo force, you need to try it. I've tried
[54:50.520 --> 54:55.560]  turbo force with everything. Sometimes you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in
[54:55.560 --> 55:00.040]  my coffee. That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go turbo
[55:00.040 --> 55:03.880]  force is my favorite and all the info wars products are down to taking control of your life,
[55:03.880 --> 55:09.800]  taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in
[55:09.800 --> 55:14.520]  the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm going to wake
[55:14.520 --> 55:18.840]  up today. You know, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier,
[55:18.840 --> 55:22.520]  happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that
[55:22.520 --> 55:25.800]  happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[55:25.800 --> 55:29.560]  Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one
[55:29.560 --> 55:33.400]  person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay,
[55:33.400 --> 55:36.440]  I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health and that's why you need to
[55:36.440 --> 55:40.120]  go to info wars.com, take control of your health right now and support the resistance. Don't buy
[55:40.120 --> 55:43.800]  into the group. Think don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the turbo force. Kool-Aid is bad and the
[55:43.800 --> 55:50.200]  turbo force is good. It's not a secret why and leftist controlled cities all over the world,
[55:50.200 --> 55:55.080]  not just the U.S. They encourage people to live in tents. Cities is homeless and they use drugs
[55:55.080 --> 56:00.040]  and alcohol and engage in petty crime. It's because the globalists admit under agenda 21,
[56:00.040 --> 56:05.560]  agenda 2030, of course, a great reset. They want to lower expectations. They don't want you to
[56:05.560 --> 56:09.480]  think of having sanitary systems everywhere. They don't want you to think of a civilization that
[56:09.480 --> 56:14.360]  gets better. They want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse. The globalists
[56:14.360 --> 56:19.880]  fly around in private jets. They have huge private mistakes. They are separate from us. Their children
[56:19.880 --> 56:25.400]  go to private tutors. They admit this. Now they want us locked down, telecommunicating with each
[56:25.400 --> 56:31.320]  other so that we are not actually out physically building a pro-human infrastructure. The infrastructure
[56:31.320 --> 56:37.080]  that's left under 5G has been a controlled robot in autonomous cars and trucks. This is all their
[56:37.080 --> 56:41.560]  admitted plan. The public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta. It's
[56:41.560 --> 56:45.240]  gone operational. It's a post-human future. You better find out about it right now.
[56:45.240 --> 56:51.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:51.640 --> 57:16.920]  There comes a moment when the beta test is over and the enemy comes. That assault has begun.
[57:16.920 --> 57:24.440]  And it means the beginning of the end of Satan's rule on Earth. But he's going to have his hour.
[57:25.720 --> 57:29.720]  We're going to have to take our licks. Kathleen in Wisconsin, thanks for holding her on the
[57:29.720 --> 57:35.640]  ear. Welcome. Hi. So there's a couple things I would love to see done. The first would be a
[57:35.640 --> 57:43.000]  national unmasked day at these big box stores. So just once a week nationwide at a certain time,
[57:43.000 --> 57:49.080]  people just go to these stores, can either enter with the mask and take it off or just go in there.
[57:49.080 --> 57:53.880]  And if the companies are afraid that they close the door and they can lose their money for a
[57:53.880 --> 57:58.520]  little while, they're not going to let people in or maybe just don't shop online at these stores
[57:58.520 --> 58:03.880]  for a week. But it has to be at a level. I think the answer is just what I do. I just walk in and
[58:03.880 --> 58:08.360]  when they start saying something, I start educating them. And then they start making a scene. They
[58:08.360 --> 58:13.160]  usually just wave me in. And if not, I leave. I mean, that happens on a routine basis. And I think
[58:13.160 --> 58:17.800]  people should then videotape that. And then that goes viral of you talking about it. And you
[58:17.800 --> 58:21.880]  educating them saying, hey, the same amount of people died this year that died last year, roughly.
[58:21.880 --> 58:25.160]  The final numbers will be in a couple of weeks, but it looks like it's about the same. Say,
[58:25.160 --> 58:31.560]  so how is it this giant record death level? It's not. It's a fraud. That's true. It happened to
[58:31.560 --> 58:35.080]  me last week at Whole Foods. I went in there and I had one of the managers come up with a little
[58:35.080 --> 58:39.640]  tray and he said, ma'am, ma'am, I need to have you put this mask on. And I said, no, I'm not going
[58:39.640 --> 58:44.600]  to put it on. I said, I don't know who touched that. Oh, I'll go open a clean box for you. I said,
[58:44.600 --> 58:49.560]  no, I said, I'm not going to put it on. My hands are dirty. You're not supposed to touch your mask
[58:49.560 --> 58:55.320]  in your face with dirty hands. And I walked away. But I think we just need to have more people doing
[58:55.320 --> 59:01.160]  that. That's right. We have to not comply and also point out, Hey, did you know that bacterial
[59:01.160 --> 59:06.520]  pneumonia is spread by masks? They're filthy. They're dirty. They don't protect you. It's a symbol
[59:06.520 --> 59:11.320]  of the fear. It's a symbol of the martial law. It's a symbol of submission just like wearing a
[59:11.320 --> 59:17.560]  burqa in Islam. So I say either calmly do it or make a scene in these places, make scenes.
[59:18.520 --> 59:24.040]  Well, that's another thing too with the mask. I agree. My mom has asthma and in October, she was
[59:24.040 --> 59:29.240]  really sick. She had a fever. Stayed home for a week by dad, the doctor. He monitored all of
[59:29.240 --> 59:34.200]  her symptoms. And after five days, she was afraid of pneumonia and sepsis. So we brought her to
[59:34.200 --> 59:39.480]  the hospital. Of course, they did the China virus test. He says, Well, what about influenza? Are
[59:39.480 --> 59:45.640]  you going to test for influenza? No, we don't really see any influenza cases. So she was admitted.
[59:46.520 --> 59:50.920]  Luckily, she wasn't intubated and she wasn't in the ICU, but they wouldn't let her
[59:50.920 --> 59:56.360]  nebulize in the hospital room because they were worried about auralization. But yet she didn't
[59:56.360 --> 1:00:01.640]  have to wear her mask while she was in the hospital room. It had an active cost. And
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:08.360]  you know, they wouldn't let us send a humidifier to let her get humidity in the air because the
[1:00:08.360 --> 1:00:13.880]  hospital air is so dry. So I said, we'll just turn on your shower with blast hot water in the
[1:00:13.880 --> 1:00:19.800]  shower. And a lot of these hospitals too aren't treating people on an outpatient basis so that
[1:00:19.800 --> 1:00:23.960]  they don't get to the hospital. That's right. And these hospitals, many of them are filthy.
[1:00:23.960 --> 1:00:29.480]  They're full of viruses. They're full of drug-resistant bacteria and viruses. And so
[1:00:29.480 --> 1:00:32.840]  they're admitting people shouldn't even be in the hospital. And then they're getting sick and
[1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:37.160]  they're dying. And then when they die of pneumonia or regular flu, they mark it as COVID. That's
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:42.040]  admitted. And now here we are almost a year into this fraud. And it's just intensifying.
[1:00:42.040 --> 1:00:47.000]  It's just continuing. Kathleen, thank you so much for the call. How'd your, well, I guess she's gone.
[1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:53.240]  Okay. We got Roger Stone for a couple segments. And he's going to be up with us in DC on the
[1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:56.680]  5th. And the 6th is going to be huge. And then after he leaves us, I'm going to go right back
[1:00:56.680 --> 1:01:04.040]  to Brian and Michael and John and Charles and Paul and Tim and Dennis and others. 877-789-2539,
[1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:11.800]  877-789-Alex on this first broadcast of the year 2021. Hard to believe. Here we are. So we're going
[1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:16.600]  to talk about Trump's road to victory with 19 days left. The big day coming up on the 6th.
[1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:20.280]  What are the real numbers? What are the real facts? What are the procedures?
[1:01:20.280 --> 1:01:24.600]  And the constitutional lawyer, Robert Barnes will be popping in for several segments as well
[1:01:24.600 --> 1:01:29.240]  in the third hour of the Dell big tree that heads up the big organization and grips fighting
[1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:35.320]  the dangers of inoculations. He'll be coming up as well. Roger Stone is our guest on the other side
[1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:40.440]  of this break at 60 seconds. Please share the live links from band.video and the main live
[1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:47.400]  show feed at infowards.com. It is an act of revolutionary defiance. It is a victory to override
[1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:57.080]  the censors. So take action, my followers. The great reset is here. World government has openly
[1:01:57.080 --> 1:02:02.040]  been announced and its plan is to bankrupt you and your family and to make you so poor, you're
[1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:07.320]  forced onto a universal guaranteed income, forced inoculations and you must pledge allegiance to
[1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:12.600]  the leftist globalist system. That's why it's important to pray to God, be politically active
[1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:18.680]  and get prepared for self defense and to be able to store food and other emergency products that
[1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:23.480]  you and your family need so you're not dependent on the system. We have the best storeable food at
[1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:26.680]  the lowest price you're going to find. All the other big competitors have already gone up on
[1:02:26.680 --> 1:02:32.280]  their prices, but our supplier has high quality food in stock ready to ship to you. And by January
[1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:37.080]  eight, they're going to have to raise prices some. So take advantage now, prepare with Alex.com. And
[1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:44.200]  on top of that, you can save up to $850 off their regular rates. Go to preparewithAlex.com.
[1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:49.240]  Today you've got until January 8th and the profit that comes in that helps fund the info war,
[1:02:49.240 --> 1:03:07.720]  fighting for America, fighting for justice, fighting for freedom, a true 360 win.
[1:03:19.240 --> 1:03:40.840]  Look at this Washington Post headline, anti-vaxxers are dangerous. Make them face isolation,
[1:03:40.840 --> 1:03:46.920]  fines and arrest. Even Bloomberg reports 80% of health care providers don't want to take it
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:50.920]  because they say it's been rushed too quick. It's got too many bad side effects, too many deaths.
[1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:54.600]  It's not even a vaccine. Wow, that's coming up later with your phone calls.
[1:03:55.800 --> 1:04:01.240]  But joining us is Roger Stone recently fully pardoned by the 45th president of the United
[1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:08.360]  States, Donald John Trump, who has called on everyone to come to DC on the 5th and the 6th.
[1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:13.800]  We've got a huge event on the 5th that I'm going to be emceeing much of. It's going to be going on
[1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:21.240]  from 12 noon until 8.30 at night. And that is on the Freedom Plaza, right by the White House.
[1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:25.160]  Roger Stone is going to be speaking there as the keynote speaker. And then the next day,
[1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:27.800]  we're already at the White House, right across from the White House on the ellipse.
[1:04:28.920 --> 1:04:31.720]  And you're going to have a large crowd there. But then outside of that, you're going to have
[1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:35.480]  millions that are gathering. We're going to then march to the Capitol peacefully
[1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:39.320]  while they have the debate inside. And to give us the latest on that,
[1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:43.080]  does Trump have a path to victory? We're starting to see senators say they're going to
[1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:47.720]  call for debate. Josh Hawley, we're seeing at least 140 House Republicans
[1:04:47.720 --> 1:04:51.640]  plan to object to Biden electoral vote. That's what Jake Tapper says.
[1:04:51.640 --> 1:04:57.800]  Louis Gohmert says it's probably 160 right now. Wow, an incredible time, Roger, and an incredible
[1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:03.240]  confluence of history as the planets align. It's good to talk to you in the year 2021.
[1:05:04.440 --> 1:05:10.120]  Well, Alex, first of all, happy new year. It's got to be a better year than 2020, although 2020
[1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:15.960]  certainly had its highlights. It was not only the year in which I was convicted, framed really,
[1:05:15.960 --> 1:05:21.080]  in a Soviet-style show trial, but also the year in which through the mercy of God,
[1:05:21.080 --> 1:05:26.120]  the president gave me first a commutation, then a full and unconditional pardon.
[1:05:27.080 --> 1:05:33.720]  Yes, it's very important for patriots to go to Washington, D.C. on January 6th for a peaceful
[1:05:33.720 --> 1:05:44.120]  protest. And here is why. The fake media psi-op, the censorship now of all mass communications,
[1:05:44.120 --> 1:05:51.880]  with the exception of radio, so network, cable, internet, print media, is completely censored.
[1:05:51.880 --> 1:05:56.280]  This is the first time in the 40 years that I've been in American politics that this has
[1:05:56.280 --> 1:06:01.480]  ever happened. And the way you push back against the fake news media that insists
[1:06:01.480 --> 1:06:07.000]  the president's support is dwindling, the president's support is collapsing, Republicans are fleeing.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:13.640]  No, show up in Washington in numbers. In numbers, there is strength. Let us show the world that
[1:06:13.640 --> 1:06:20.680]  we are large, we are strong, we are united, and we're not putting up with the heist of the 2020
[1:06:20.680 --> 1:06:27.640]  election. That's why this event is so very important. Roger, we've also seen headlines
[1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:33.560]  out there in the Washington Post, the New York Times, in the nation saying, arrest Donald Trump
[1:06:33.560 --> 1:06:38.760]  for sedition. And that was just last week. And then they lie and say that you and I are calling
[1:06:38.760 --> 1:06:42.360]  for violence, that Trump's calling for violence. It's the left that burnt down cities that burnt
[1:06:42.360 --> 1:06:47.720]  down police stations and shot people on the head. We're going to D.C., like they did in Romania,
[1:06:47.720 --> 1:06:55.560]  or like they've done in many other places, and showing our numbers to the dictatorship
[1:06:55.560 --> 1:07:00.440]  of the left of the bureaucracy that's trying to steal the election from our president and
[1:07:00.440 --> 1:07:05.080]  complete their takeover. We do not want violence of any type because we have the election on our
[1:07:05.080 --> 1:07:10.200]  side. We have the truth. It's the left that's violent. You know, it's interesting that piece
[1:07:10.200 --> 1:07:15.960]  you just shows written by Sean Walence. Sean Walence is a fish-faced enemy of the people.
[1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:23.880]  He's leftist. His father and his uncle were ran the Democratic machine in New Jersey for many years,
[1:07:23.880 --> 1:07:30.120]  epically corrupt politicians. So he's not a historian. He's a propagandist. The only sedition
[1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:37.720]  here that I can see is in the heist and theft of the election, the overwhelming and compelling
[1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:45.400]  and growing evidence of voter fraud, the very real evidence of cyber manipulation of the vote.
[1:07:46.280 --> 1:07:52.280]  So as you and I have experienced over the last two years, everything is backwards.
[1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:57.080]  So if they accuse you of colluding with the Russians, that means they were colluding with
[1:07:57.080 --> 1:08:03.720]  the Russians, which we know to be a fact. The Russians helped compile the phony steel dossier
[1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:12.040]  that the Deep State used as the fake justification of their investigation into the Russian collusion,
[1:08:12.040 --> 1:08:19.080]  which never existed. When they accuse us of doing virtually anything, it means they are the ones
[1:08:19.080 --> 1:08:27.000]  doing it. The sedition here is on the part of Joe Biden and the Democrats and their handmaidens
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  in the fake news media because they have been running a very successful PSYOP since before
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:40.520]  the election. Let's go through it. Donald Trump can't possibly win. His mishandling of COVID-19
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:46.840]  was a disaster. Suburban women are fleeing him in droves. It's over. He's dead. He's going to lose
[1:08:46.840 --> 1:08:54.120]  Wisconsin by 17 ABC News Bowl. All of that is false. Donald Trump fought his way back from
[1:08:54.120 --> 1:09:01.160]  the precipice to win when I'm convinced, based on a lot of examination, is a majority of the legal
[1:09:01.160 --> 1:09:06.920]  votes cast. So we're the ones standing up for the rule of law. We're the ones standing up for the
[1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:13.800]  Constitution. They are the ones acting seditiously. Here's a little key going forward. Anytime any
[1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:20.440]  Democrat uses the word rule of law, they're lying. They didn't care about the rule of law when
[1:09:20.440 --> 1:09:25.960]  Bill Clinton was fixing Hillary's illegal email server case on the tarmac with the
[1:09:25.960 --> 1:09:31.880]  Attorney General Loretta Lynch. They didn't care about the rule of law when Joe Biden and Barack
[1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:38.040]  Obama used the full authority of the United States government to use falsified data to defraud the
[1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:43.720]  FISA court to justify their spying on the Trump campaign. That's the biggest scandal in American
[1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:50.680]  history. Where was the rule of law then, Jerry Nadler? Please, this is nonsense. We are in an
[1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:56.600]  epic, epic struggle here. It's not Republicans versus Democrats. It's not conservatives versus
[1:09:56.600 --> 1:10:04.840]  liberals. This is about the insiders and an outsider. Donald J. Trump. This is about a struggle
[1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:11.400]  between dark and light, between evil and good, between the godly and the godless. And we dare
[1:10:11.400 --> 1:10:17.480]  not fail, Alex. That's why I will be with you shoulder to shoulder in Washington, DC on January
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:22.040]  6th. Well, this is going to be beyond epic. And obviously you're going to be at both events with
[1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:27.480]  me, but I suggest we stick together because this is going to be extremely, extremely historic at
[1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:33.080]  the White House. You're speaking, I'm speaking. It's going to absolutely have the left going to
[1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:39.400]  total complete connection fits. And let's expand on that, Roger. I have had ABC national news host
[1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:44.600]  call me up. I've had others from Fox call me. I've had Democrat party lawyers call me and go,
[1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:50.040]  Alex, we like you. I bet we can get you re platformed. Please don't do this in DC. You're
[1:10:50.040 --> 1:10:55.080]  going to be in danger. Somebody might shoot you. Oh, please don't lead a violent revolution. And
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:59.080]  really what they're doing is calling up and threatening me. So they're really concerned
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:05.320]  about the six Roger. I mean, if they got it the bag so much, why are they doing this? Because in
[1:11:05.320 --> 1:11:11.080]  numbers, there is strength. But let's be very clear. We renounce violence. We're not for violence.
[1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:19.240]  It was for Trump supporters who got stabbed after the last DC event. It was 82 Trump supporters who
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:26.760]  were badly injured in attacks by Antifa. This is my greatest concern because our events are
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:33.560]  essentially grassroots oriented pop up events. We don't have the big bucks that George Soros has
[1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:43.000]  for security. I actually set up stop the steel.org. This is to raise money solely for security solely
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  for transportation and security of people to protect those peaceful citizens who show up.
[1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:55.160]  I don't want to see any more stabbings or beatings. We renounce violence. Violence is the tactic of
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:11:58.760]  the left. That's right. That's why I'm asking you why is the left so concerned about our rally?
[1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:04.920]  Because they know it's going to show that Biden who can't even get a high school auditorium full
[1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:10.920]  is a fraud. That's precisely why they're scared. The idea of a million Americans converging on
[1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:17.640]  Washington DC to protest the heist of the 2020 election was not in their script. At this point,
[1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:24.600]  you have virtually every element of the Republican establishment who also very much to
[1:12:24.600 --> 1:12:30.840]  Donald Trump who led that party back to being a majority party of working class people telling
[1:12:30.840 --> 1:12:36.120]  us oh telling the president oh no pack it in. You've got to concede. You need to think about history
[1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:42.520]  nonsense. The president won this election and he should keep fighting right to the end. I agree.
[1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:46.680]  Let's look at all the angles of that and Georgia and more and what if Biden gets in what happens
[1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:55.880]  next? We'll be back with Roger Stone. I'm Alex Jones. Introducing infowars life pure turmeric
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:13:03.480]  extract. This is taken under the tongue. It is pure turmeric. It goes together very well with
[1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:09.480]  our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach
[1:13:09.480 --> 1:13:15.080]  and intestines. This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also
[1:13:15.080 --> 1:13:20.520]  is then absorbed by the stomach. So it's more of an intense delivery system. The two formulas are
[1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:25.080]  different but both are concentrates and our first product got rave reviews. We've now been testing

[1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:56.440]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado. Thank you for holding. How you doing Alex?
[1:13:57.080 --> 1:14:00.440]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can. We're in such a critical time. Brother, how are you?
[1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:06.200]  I love you, man. I want to make a quick plug that DNA force. I love it. I've been using it
[1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:10.920]  quite a while and I just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and I see that it
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:17.640]  contains quercetin which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited
[1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:24.920]  is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells.
[1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:31.400]  So people might want to take a look at that. All I know is with DNA force we went out and looked
[1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:36.360]  at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the
[1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:39.880]  doctor sold like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it's
[1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:45.080]  really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together
[1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:47.720]  and that's what produced this. So thanks. Thanks for the plug.
[1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:57.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:17.720]  Live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones.
[1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:26.600]  Got a hold of me. Yeah we got two of the real bad boys here.
[1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:32.840]  Here's truly Alex Jones and Roger Stone. Roger Stone did absolutely nothing wrong. I was there.
[1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:37.480]  He was working in info wars during the campaign and officially worked here after and I knew everything
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:41.720]  he said was true in the media because I was heavily involved in it all. Notice they didn't
[1:15:41.720 --> 1:15:45.960]  ever want to call me as a witness the feds. Said they had Steve Bannon who contradicted
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:51.240]  himself. That's a whole nother kettle of fish but what is it like for you Roger and we'll get back
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:55.320]  into the current developments to be I know loved. I'll go down the street with you and you shake
[1:15:55.320 --> 1:16:00.760]  50 hands before somebody goes after you Russian hope you have to die. Same thing happens to me
[1:16:01.320 --> 1:16:05.080]  but you were telling me that now that you've been pardoned it's gotten even worse. They're really
[1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:13.400]  mad. Alex it's a it's a flash point I guess. So I'm extraordinarily polarizing figure. I don't
[1:16:13.400 --> 1:16:17.880]  really care about that. The people who are with me. The people who prayed for me. The people
[1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:24.600]  who sustained me through this. God bless them. Every once in a while we run into some nut job.
[1:16:25.640 --> 1:16:30.040]  I really do need security when I go to Washington or when I travel anywhere outside of Fort
[1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:35.640]  Lauderdale and even in some places of South Florida. Roger I've got about 20 security guys.
[1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:40.520]  I know you've got a few so you can just join up with us. You know Alex I'm putting in
[1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:47.800]  some time 17 18 hour days. I'm trying to finish my book which is entitled Roger Stone did nothing
[1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:53.720]  wrong. My political persecution and the heist of the 2020 election because they are very
[1:16:53.720 --> 1:16:59.080]  intricately connected. I'm trying to finish the script for a documentary. I'm going to be honest
[1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:07.160]  with you. If I was not using brain force plus there's no way. This is a great product. I'm
[1:17:07.160 --> 1:17:12.440]  paid nothing to tell you this folks. I'm telling you this because it's the truth. This stuff gives
[1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:18.440]  me a lift of energy both mental and creative energy kind of helps organize your mind but it
[1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:24.120]  doesn't leave you awake staring at the ceiling late at night when you can't sleep. So I cannot
[1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:30.920]  recommend brain force plus enough. I swear by it. I appreciate your plug. Brain force plus is a good
[1:17:30.920 --> 1:17:34.840]  clean natural. A new traffic for the brain available at info or store.com. They don't
[1:17:34.840 --> 1:17:39.000]  go do that plug but I appreciate your support because without you and the listeners this
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:43.640]  broadcast would not be here my friend. Now let's pull back. I got to ask a lot of questions but
[1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:49.160]  what else is front and center for you. Your advice to the president. His chances of what you
[1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:54.040]  expect to see in the Senate and the House next week. I think that a lot of you know inside sources
[1:17:54.040 --> 1:18:00.200]  what is the sense right now. Well the thing that perplexes me and I don't know the answer Alex is
[1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:08.760]  why the president left Marlago his palatial place in Palm Beach early because the Marlago
[1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:16.120]  News New Year's Eve party has always been kind of his favorite event. That's the event of the
[1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:24.040]  year for him. He and his incredible wife the first lady an extraordinary woman step on the red
[1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:30.760]  carpet. It is a time of great celebration for his many many supporters and friends for him to
[1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:36.920]  abandon that and return back to Washington tells me that he is doing so because of some official
[1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:43.240]  business. I have no inside track on what this means other than to say I believe it means something
[1:18:43.240 --> 1:18:50.600]  because this is an event that has great sentimental affection for the president and he is going to
[1:18:50.600 --> 1:18:58.440]  miss it. I don't know what's afoot in Washington. As you know the Iranians are making hostile noises
[1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:05.160]  but the president has always handled them appropriately. But I don't know what is afoot.
[1:19:05.160 --> 1:19:12.120]  I do know that there are now more than enough House members to object to the certification
[1:19:12.120 --> 1:19:20.040]  of the Electoral College. Matt Gates, Louis Gohmert, Mo Brooks some fine men there. I believe
[1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:26.360]  that a senator will be found. I saw that Josh Hawley who I like very much from Missouri says
[1:19:26.360 --> 1:19:32.520]  that he will object. I'm still hopeful that Rick Scott from Florida will object. In fact there is
[1:19:32.520 --> 1:19:39.800]  a peaceful protest a peaceful event just down the street from Rick Scott's house this Sunday at one
[1:19:39.800 --> 1:19:47.240]  o'clock in Naples Florida. We asked people to join us there. We are respectfully and peacefully
[1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:53.160]  calling on the president pardon me calling on Senator Scott the senator from Florida
[1:19:53.160 --> 1:20:00.440]  to stand with the president on January 6th. So that is this Sunday it's at 5400
[1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:09.000]  Timmy Annie trail. You can find it all over the internet. Please join us for this peaceful
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:14.840]  protest. We're going to respectfully ask Senator Scott to get on board and be one of those who
[1:20:14.840 --> 1:20:23.480]  seconds the motion objecting to the certification of the electors. Well I've got to say this Roger.
[1:20:24.040 --> 1:20:32.120]  I am so proud of the populace, the Christians, the conservatives, the nationalists, the common
[1:20:32.120 --> 1:20:37.800]  sense people that have fought so hard for six years, two years to get Trump elected, four years of
[1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:44.760]  Trump being embattled and now this epic fight for our right to vote against this globalist
[1:20:44.760 --> 1:20:49.880]  tricom takeover. I've got concerns about Trump and the vaccines. I was mad when he tacitly
[1:20:49.880 --> 1:20:55.320]  agreed with red flag laws. Trump's not perfect but he got elected. He's our president, the globalist
[1:20:55.320 --> 1:21:00.200]  hating and they're trying to remove him from office via fraud right now and so that's why we've got
[1:21:00.200 --> 1:21:07.960]  to back him 110 percent. Your comments on that. You're 100 percent right and he's got a number
[1:21:07.960 --> 1:21:16.200]  of options right now that he could do that would flummox the deep state. I've called on him for
[1:21:16.200 --> 1:21:22.280]  example before if he should leave office or even by the end of this term he should declassify all
[1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:28.600]  of the John F. Kennedy assassination records. He declassified a substantial number of them
[1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:35.320]  in the second year of his term. It is now time to declassify all of them. I have urged him to
[1:21:36.520 --> 1:21:43.080]  presidential pardon to Julian Assange and to Edward Snowden. No Assange is not a Russian asset.
[1:21:43.080 --> 1:21:50.040]  That's nonsense invented by John Brennan. Snowden's big crime is that he seems to have proved that
[1:21:50.040 --> 1:21:55.160]  John Brennan was lying when he told us, pardon me, James Clapper was lying when he told us
[1:21:55.160 --> 1:22:01.800]  there was no metadata collection program on average American citizens. That was a lie. So if the
[1:22:01.800 --> 1:22:09.080]  president wants to strike back at the deep state for their efforts to deny him his rightful second
[1:22:09.080 --> 1:22:15.240]  term, there are several ways there that he could do so. Roger, you've been around a lot longer
[1:22:15.240 --> 1:22:18.600]  than I have, but I've been around a while now. I've never seen anything like this. I've never
[1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:21.960]  read anything like this in a history book. I mean, we're in uncharted territory right now,
[1:22:21.960 --> 1:22:26.520]  aren't we? We're going to look back on this as a spectacularly incredible, dangerous time.
[1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:33.080]  There's no question about that. But the thing that's different about this than every other challenge
[1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:40.840]  is for the first time, they have succeeded in maintaining and enforcing censorship of all
[1:22:40.840 --> 1:22:47.320]  mass communications. I thought it was very interesting when you had the young serviceman
[1:22:47.320 --> 1:22:53.800]  Ivan Raiklin, who's a friend of mine, talked about use of the emergency broadcast system to
[1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:59.080]  tell the American people the truth. I think this is a great idea. I think it is one of the ideas
[1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:06.680]  the president should consider. He has the bully pulpit. I'm sorry, MSNBC and CNN. The evidence
[1:23:06.680 --> 1:23:12.920]  of election fraud is growing, overwhelming and compelling. You can close your eyes and pretend
[1:23:12.920 --> 1:23:17.000]  it's not there. But the next thing you know, you'll be telling us there is no such thing as
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:24.360]  gravity and the world is flat. Not only that, but the evidence of cyber communications is
[1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:30.120]  overwhelming. The president has the bully pulpit to make sure the American people understand what
[1:23:30.120 --> 1:23:34.440]  has. That's right, Rodgers. So let's talk about this. One other area he's failing. He's given some
[1:23:34.440 --> 1:23:38.440]  great speeches, done some great stuff. As a conceited, he should be at the resolute desk every
[1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:44.360]  night, you know, calling the troops in, warning the American people, rallying the public. So let's
[1:23:44.360 --> 1:23:49.880]  talk about what he should do when we come back with 19 days until they try to coordinate Joe Biden.
[1:23:50.680 --> 1:23:54.120]  Letters dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[1:23:54.680 --> 1:24:00.120]  Other dictionaries have similar ones. Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out
[1:24:00.120 --> 1:24:07.080]  force for a political or financial reason. It's basically scaring the hell out of people
[1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:12.440]  until you submit to them. That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is. You see
[1:24:12.440 --> 1:24:17.560]  the headlines from CNN, ABC News. Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought. COVID more
[1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:22.600]  devastating than they could ever imagine. They told us that two and a half million people would be
[1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:29.320]  dead just eight months ago, within three months. Okay. It's a quarter million. If you count all of
[1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:34.440]  the people that died of other things, we're talking 96% had co-morbidity. These are real numbers.
[1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:39.560]  These are real facts. This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out
[1:24:39.560 --> 1:24:43.640]  and are taught we're not essential. All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:49.640]  Rebuke it, stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:55.800]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare. The United Nations,
[1:24:55.800 --> 1:24:59.560]  the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big farmer are all pushing. The
[1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:04.360]  cub is the most deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold.
[1:25:04.360 --> 1:25:08.920]  But if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it. That's why you see somebody dying
[1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:14.680]  inside the nursing homes. Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer
[1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:20.040]  head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones,
[1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:24.280]  are basically bioweapons and are super deadly. And now they're having to resuscitate people that
[1:25:24.280 --> 1:25:29.080]  die basically when they take it, just like newborn babies, they give vaccines. They have to
[1:25:29.080 --> 1:25:33.080]  resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just let them die. And that's on the record.
[1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:37.880]  It does that. Guillain-Marais, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases, but they tell you,
[1:25:37.880 --> 1:25:41.320]  save and effective. No one's getting hurt. It's a conspiracy theory. And then all the fine
[1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:45.960]  princess can kill you absolutely deadly. So they run from something that isn't dangerous
[1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:49.720]  towards something that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe. They do it.
[1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:56.040]  Our activated charcoal toothpaste became a best-seller overnight because activated charcoal
[1:25:56.040 --> 1:26:00.360]  is already one of the top-selling fastest-growing toothpaste out there. The problem is a lot of
[1:26:00.360 --> 1:26:05.320]  the other over-the-counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring, very, very toxic. And also,
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:09.240]  they have fluoride in it. This does not have the fluoride. It doesn't have the additives.
[1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:13.960]  This is a concentrate. It really is high quality. It's been sold out for months because of supply
[1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:18.840]  chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage. But now it's back in stock.
[1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:24.600]  InfoWars, Dr. Jones Naturals, activated charcoal toothpaste. Now back in stock

[1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:23.080]  Now in sudden death overtime, we are tied in the dead heat against the globalists and the Chikons.
[1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:30.200]  But America is not surrendering. You can't cut the suspense with a jackhammer.
[1:27:31.880 --> 1:27:35.960]  All right, final segment with Roger Stone. Your call's coming up and Robert Barnes joins us
[1:27:35.960 --> 1:27:41.000]  and Dale Bigtree and so much more. Roger, you were saying some powerful stuff during the break.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:47.240]  I know you can't get to it all, but just for folks, you were saying this is in your own words,
[1:27:47.240 --> 1:27:49.000]  repeat what you were just telling me during the break.
[1:27:49.720 --> 1:27:55.320]  Well, Alex, here's the thing that I know. I have known the president for now 41 years.
[1:27:55.960 --> 1:28:00.760]  The only thing predictable about Donald Trump is that he's completely unpredictable.
[1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:09.000]  And therefore, for him to leave his beloved Mar-a-Lago and to leave his palatial and incredibly
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:17.160]  opulent New Year's Eve party that was hosted there by the club to return to Washington,
[1:28:17.880 --> 1:28:23.400]  his return has to be triggered by something significant. I'm not second guessing the president
[1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:28.360]  of the United States. I don't know what he has up his sleeve. I do know this. Whatever it is,
[1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:34.440]  I will support him 1000 percent. He is the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:40.600]  He is an existential threat to the two-party duopoly that's run the country into the ground.
[1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:46.280]  They tried four different times that we know of to remove him. How many attempts were there
[1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:52.360]  to remove him that we don't know about? But he's a brawler. He's a fighter. He's going to go down
[1:28:52.360 --> 1:28:59.240]  fighting if he's going down at all. He is the rightful winner of this election. The true results
[1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:06.360]  demonstrate that. But if we reach a point in America in which one cannot get a fair and impartial
[1:29:06.360 --> 1:29:13.960]  judicial decision and we cannot get a fair, impartial, honest, transparent election,
[1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:21.800]  and our legislative process is constipated by special interest, influence, and fear,
[1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:28.520]  well, then there's no avenue to fix what's wrong with America. There's no avenue to reform
[1:29:28.520 --> 1:29:34.360]  for reform. I tremble to think about what that means. Donald Trump is our last,
[1:29:34.360 --> 1:29:43.560]  best hope to save this nation. Four more years of Trump presidency, knowing what he now knows,
[1:29:43.560 --> 1:29:50.680]  and fully understanding the evil of the deep state and the permanent government in place,
[1:29:50.680 --> 1:29:56.680]  the next four years would be extraordinary in terms of him fixing America. That's why this
[1:29:56.680 --> 1:30:03.960]  fight is so vitally important and why we need to see all of you in Washington, D.C. It's also why
[1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:12.920]  we must get a U.S. senator to second the motion of Mo Brooks and Matt Gaetz and other great
[1:30:12.920 --> 1:30:20.920]  patriots in the House to have open debate on the motion to certify the electors. There is a
[1:30:20.920 --> 1:30:28.920]  demonstration this Sunday, a peaceful, respectful demonstration at 5400 Tamiami Trail North,
[1:30:29.880 --> 1:30:37.560]  that's at the northeast corner of U.S. 41 and Pine Ridge Road in Naples, right outside Senator
[1:30:37.560 --> 1:30:45.320]  Rick Scott's home. Again, this is a peaceful, friendly, respectful event to urge the senator
[1:30:45.320 --> 1:30:50.920]  to do the right thing and to stand with Donald Trump, stand with the Constitution, stand with
[1:30:50.920 --> 1:30:57.720]  the American people against this steal. I'm going to be there. I urge anybody in South Florida who
[1:30:57.720 --> 1:31:02.280]  can't make it to Washington but wants their voice to be heard to see us on Sunday.
[1:31:03.160 --> 1:31:11.000]  Roger, let's pull back here with the 100,000 foot view from the edge of space looking down on Earth.
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:15.960]  Trump's got some up his sleeve. We know there was total fraud. The evidence is ridiculously cartoon
[1:31:15.960 --> 1:31:20.920]  level, open and shut in these five states. As you said, we've got Josh Howley. We don't have
[1:31:20.920 --> 1:31:25.160]  another senator to second it. We've got Pence coming back saying he now won't be out of the
[1:31:25.160 --> 1:31:28.840]  country, won't be going to Israel. He's going to be there. So everybody's coming back to D.C.
[1:31:28.840 --> 1:31:33.400]  right now. You can tell there's some big meetings going on. Trump's obviously up there wrangling
[1:31:33.400 --> 1:31:39.960]  more senators, more House members. How will that look if he's able to discount the
[1:31:39.960 --> 1:31:46.120]  five states? Obviously, the evidence is there. Don't you expect they'll procedurally move
[1:31:46.120 --> 1:31:49.880]  to have a new election in the five states? I think that's the fairest thing to do.
[1:31:51.880 --> 1:31:57.400]  I would favor that, but I'm not a constitutional lawyer nor am I an expert. The thing I like
[1:31:57.400 --> 1:32:05.800]  about this is this is the mandated constitutional process. Very hard to say that the president
[1:32:05.800 --> 1:32:12.120]  is involved in an act of sedition when all he is doing and all his supporters are doing
[1:32:12.120 --> 1:32:19.480]  is utilizing the current legal process in the appropriate way. We cannot get a fair,
[1:32:19.480 --> 1:32:25.160]  honest judicial proceeding. That blows my mind. The case presented by the state of Texas was
[1:32:25.160 --> 1:32:32.520]  overwhelming. It was compelling. It was legally correct. It was not flawed. The court's decision
[1:32:32.520 --> 1:32:39.000]  not to hear it is outrageous. Outrageous. I would look at those Bush-appointed
[1:32:40.040 --> 1:32:47.160]  justices with the exception of that great patriot, Clarence Thomas, as to that action.
[1:32:47.160 --> 1:32:53.480]  The fact that we cannot get a fair hearing in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the site of
[1:32:53.480 --> 1:33:00.280]  more theft than I think perhaps any other state, that's why we have to go this route.
[1:33:00.280 --> 1:33:06.040]  That's why we are rallying in Washington. That's why it's vitally important that Republicans of
[1:33:06.040 --> 1:33:14.760]  good faith stand up for this president on January 6th. I read where Senator-Elect Tuberville from
[1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:21.800]  Alabama, the patriot who defeated Jeff Sessions in the Senate comeback bid that he launched,
[1:33:21.800 --> 1:33:27.800]  has said that he is considering seconding the motion. That would make Senator Tuberville
[1:33:27.800 --> 1:33:35.480]  a national figure overnight and a hero to the American people. I am praying that this all comes
[1:33:35.480 --> 1:33:40.680]  together. Why would they not do it? We have cartoon-level fraud where they close it, board
[1:33:40.680 --> 1:33:44.600]  up the windows, pull out the black suitcases, and start running it over and over again saying a
[1:33:44.600 --> 1:33:49.400]  water main burst. Then right when they do it, it spikes for Biden. The same thing in the other
[1:33:49.400 --> 1:33:54.680]  states. It's cartoon-level. It's like Wiley Cowlett with a sheep on top of his head sneaking off with
[1:33:54.680 --> 1:34:01.240]  it. The reason that they would not do it is because the establishment Republican party
[1:34:02.200 --> 1:34:07.160]  wants Donald Trump off the stage as quickly as the Democrats. See, they like the status quo.
[1:34:07.160 --> 1:34:11.080]  They don't mind being in the minority as long as they get some nice crumbs from
[1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:19.080]  Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. They are backed by the fake news media, those jackals in the
[1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:27.400]  media, who will not let the fact that this cartoon-level corruption be seen, be heard,
[1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:33.800]  be exposed to the American people. As I said earlier, it's a psi-op. In 40 years in American
[1:34:33.800 --> 1:34:40.840]  politics, I have never seen a situation in which virtually every element of mass communications
[1:34:40.840 --> 1:34:46.680]  in this country is censored. Isn't that Trump's biggest failure? He talked a lot. He said a lot.
[1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:51.240]  Now he's trying to get 230 repealed. But he should have understood that allowing this censorship
[1:34:51.240 --> 1:34:55.960]  would end up, I mean, they're now censoring Senate fraud hearings on the election. Google says,
[1:34:55.960 --> 1:35:00.760]  well, we're not going to let you see this. I mean, this is sedition. This is dangerous. If the Soviet
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:04.520]  Union did this, we'd go to war with them. If the Chinese were controlling our media, we'd get upset.
[1:35:04.520 --> 1:35:10.840]  But it's big tech in league with the Communist Chinese. Roger, I can't wait to see you in DC.
[1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:12.920]  I'm getting in there Monday evening. When do you get in?
[1:35:12.920 --> 1:35:18.520]  That's a little unclear. I'm still working on the logistics, and I don't like to say a lot for
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:23.880]  security purposes. But I will be there, Alex. I will be shoulder to shoulder with you and
[1:35:23.880 --> 1:35:30.040]  so many other great patriots for this important, peaceful protest. So folks, if you can get to
[1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:36.760]  Washington, please see us there. If you can't, go to stopthesteal.org and help us pay for some
[1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:43.080]  professional security to protect our peaceful protest. Absolutely. In closing, this is bigger
[1:35:43.080 --> 1:35:47.000]  than the inauguration of Trump gut level. I think this is the biggest historical thing
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:50.520]  in our lifetimes. I've never been involved in something this important, Roger. This is the
[1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:55.800]  biggest thing in my life so far. Well, and unlike the inauguration, I will not have to wear a top
[1:35:55.800 --> 1:36:01.240]  hat. So that part. All right, Roger, we really appreciate you. God bless, and I'll see you in
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:07.480]  the swamp. Thanks, Alex. I look forward to seeing you there and Godspeed. Absolutely. Folks, I will
[1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:10.840]  ask listeners, and I mean this from out of my heart, please pray for Roger. Please pray for
[1:36:10.840 --> 1:36:14.600]  myself. My parents get really concerned. Everybody else does. I'm obviously a big target.
[1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:19.480]  Roger's just as big, maybe bigger. I mean, and so if there's a deck of cards, Trump's the ace
[1:36:19.480 --> 1:36:23.480]  of spades, and Roger and I are like the next cards, and it's not like you want to be those top
[1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:27.640]  cards. It's not fun, but it's our mission. And I'm, you know, I asked for this, so I'm in this
[1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:33.720]  position, but I pray, I pray that you pray for us because one of the safest places to be in the
[1:36:33.720 --> 1:36:37.800]  world will be D.C. for the average person. But for Donald Trump or Roger Stone or Alex Jones,
[1:36:37.800 --> 1:36:43.240]  it is not a happy campers paradise. I can tell you will be right back with your phone calls,
[1:36:43.240 --> 1:36:46.840]  and Robert Barnes is coming up info wars.com tomorrow's news today.

[1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:47.080]  for keeping info wars in the fight without your support. We couldn't do any on it.
[1:37:47.080 --> 1:37:55.880]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[1:37:57.160 --> 1:38:05.240]  And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do? We know that millions will
[1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:11.960]  do absolutely nothing. They will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a virtue.
[1:38:11.960 --> 1:38:20.440]  It is the Patriots of the world versus everybody else. I do solemnly swear that I will support
[1:38:20.440 --> 1:38:27.720]  and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic,
[1:38:27.720 --> 1:38:33.960]  that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, that I take this obligation freely
[1:38:33.960 --> 1:38:40.280]  without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully
[1:38:40.280 --> 1:38:47.560]  discharge my duties as best as I can. So help me God info wars.com bam.video
[1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:55.640]  Inflation is here and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming, especially
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:39:00.840]  if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar. Tens of millions of Americans that were
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:07.000]  not awake are now beginning to store food. That's a good thing, but it's going to drive up prices
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  and we're already beginning to see record sales once again. We the people understand it's up to
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:18.040]  us to protect ourselves. It's up to us to become self-sufficient. The globalists are waging
[1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:23.640]  siege against us, trying to destroy our businesses, trying to bankrupt our families, our towns,
[1:39:23.640 --> 1:39:29.240]  our churches. That's why, while we still can, we've got to get prepared and get ready. Take
[1:39:29.240 --> 1:39:36.440]  advantage of a huge final mega sale before prices go up and prepare with alex.com and save up to
[1:39:36.440 --> 1:39:41.160]  eight hundred and fifty dollars off the highest quality storeable foods out there. You've got
[1:39:41.160 --> 1:39:48.280]  until Friday January 8th to get your orders in at preparewithalex.com and lock in the lowest prices
[1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:55.240]  out there on high quality storeable food. The resistance.video, the resistance.video,
[1:39:55.880 --> 1:40:04.280]  the resistance.video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video,
[1:40:04.280 --> 1:40:12.360]  the resistance.video, infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video, and hundreds of other URLs we've
[1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:19.400]  launched have been banned. That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it,
[1:40:19.960 --> 1:40:28.920]  but Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail, but the new website is the resistance.video,
[1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:35.240]  the resistance.video. They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them,
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:40.760]  so the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[1:40:40.760 --> 1:40:45.880]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is that the resistance.video.
[1:40:45.880 --> 1:40:49.720]  Share the link, the resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[1:40:49.720 --> 1:40:56.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:17.320]  Again, a lot of people see Trump in trouble and so they say, oh, well, Trump's bad on the
[1:41:17.320 --> 1:41:23.480]  vaccine or Trump's bad on this or that. Yeah, absolutely. But Trump overall, I believe, means
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:27.240]  well and is fighting the globalist and they hate him and are trying to get rid of him and are trying
[1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:33.800]  to steal this election. That's our vote. So that's why I back Trump 110% and I'm praying for him
[1:41:33.800 --> 1:41:37.720]  because this is an incredible time to be alive right now, ladies and gentlemen. All right,
[1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:45.960]  we are taking your phone calls and the reason Rush Limbaugh, God bless him, says diddows is if
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:51.400]  you say, hey, I like you, hey, you like me, we can't get to everybody. So I'm not going to say
[1:41:51.400 --> 1:41:54.600]  thanks for the call. I'm taking you all right now. I'm just going to go to the next person,
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:58.920]  hang up on you, go to the next person, get everybody on here. Okay, Brian in Colorado,
[1:41:58.920 --> 1:42:04.680]  thanks for holding. I just said it, you're on the air. Go ahead. Yeah, I wanted to speak a little
[1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:12.840]  bit to the parents out there. I have two small children and anybody that's engaging in this mask
[1:42:12.840 --> 1:42:19.400]  situation is really harming them. And I think it's the form of child abuse. And I really would
[1:42:19.400 --> 1:42:24.680]  like it if people would stop participating in that. I agree. When I see people, especially with
[1:42:24.680 --> 1:42:28.680]  three or four year olds with those damn mask on, and then try to make babies wear it, I want to
[1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:35.800]  kick their ass. Indeed, let's not get violent. But you know what I mean? I get it's child abuse.
[1:42:35.800 --> 1:42:41.080]  Dude, listen, I don't have asthma and I'm not really somebody that gets scared and can find
[1:42:41.080 --> 1:42:44.440]  places. I've gotten older. I've gotten a little bit more. What do you call that? We don't like being
[1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:49.160]  confined spaces. What's that? What's that name? Have one of those moments claustrophobia. I've
[1:42:49.160 --> 1:42:53.160]  got one more claustrophobia because I've gotten older. I wear these damn mask, pisses me off,
[1:42:53.160 --> 1:42:57.880]  freaks me out. I can't breathe well with them. Sorry, go ahead. I totally agree with you. And I
[1:42:57.880 --> 1:43:04.360]  want to also tell the people that are perpetrating all this fraud and have been involved with all
[1:43:04.360 --> 1:43:10.440]  this treasonous activity. I want them to know that I'm a student of history. I grew up outside of
[1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:15.400]  Philadelphia and there's a lot to know about our world history and our country's history.
[1:43:15.400 --> 1:43:21.960]  And people know what happened back in the 1770s. They know it to every day, every hour, every minute
[1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:25.480]  from the diaries and the letters that were written. And they know every single person
[1:43:25.480 --> 1:43:29.320]  and what they were doing and what they weren't doing. And a hundred years from now,
[1:43:29.320 --> 1:43:34.120]  the way things are on these computers has never goes away. Everyone's going to know who you were,
[1:43:34.120 --> 1:43:40.280]  who you are and what you've done. I agree. But as millions get cancer and millions get sterile,
[1:43:40.280 --> 1:43:44.200]  the fouchies and people are going to be held accountable for murder like Nazis at Nuremberg.
[1:43:44.200 --> 1:43:48.440]  God bless you. I said I'm not going to thank the callers, but I just can't help it. Just
[1:43:48.440 --> 1:43:52.840]  let's go ahead and talk to Michael in South Carolina. Go ahead. Welcome.
[1:43:54.520 --> 1:44:00.920]  Hey, Alex. How are you? Good, brother. Go ahead. I think that it's time for our religious leaders
[1:44:00.920 --> 1:44:08.440]  to stand up and reject all this. I'll go to these churches and they're taking people's temperatures
[1:44:08.440 --> 1:44:15.320]  and wearing masks and doing all this stuff. That's because the new religion is humans are dirty and
[1:44:15.320 --> 1:44:19.880]  they're virtue signaling and oh, they're going to want to see your vaccine passport soon. Exactly.
[1:44:19.880 --> 1:44:27.720]  They're not churches. They're caught in the devil's net. It just blows my mind, Alex. I just can't
[1:44:27.720 --> 1:44:32.680]  understand it. And I want to thank you for waking me up, man. I know you get that all the time,
[1:44:33.560 --> 1:44:37.800]  but thank you, Alex. Well, thank you, Michael. I just want us to win together. That's why your word
[1:44:37.800 --> 1:44:43.720]  of mouth is king. A woman's word of mouth is queen. And just telling people about the show and sharing
[1:44:43.720 --> 1:44:47.880]  videos and sharing articles that Roger Stone interview needs to get out to everybody. That's
[1:44:47.880 --> 1:44:52.360]  how we do it. God bless you. I guess we can all thank each other. I just, we spend a much time
[1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:55.640]  thanking each other. We don't get to the next caller, but yes, I love you too. Let's talk to
[1:44:55.640 --> 1:45:01.080]  John in Wyoming. John, thanks for holding. Go ahead. Good morning, Alex. Before I get to the
[1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:06.840]  vaccines, I want to touch upon what you mentioned earlier in the broadcast. Remember when you were
[1:45:06.840 --> 1:45:14.440]  talking about those giant holograms of jellyfish? Yes. Look at the James Bond movie that Daniel
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:21.560]  Craig filmed. It was called Skyfall when he was in this huge skyscraper in Hong Kong chasing the
[1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:29.960]  bad guy. And outside the windows, they had these enormous jellyfish holograms. They were light green
[1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:36.760]  colored and they looked as realistic as you depicted a while ago. But getting onto the vaccines,
[1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:42.600]  there are three important things to remember that in early 1976, there was one suspected,
[1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:48.920]  but never confirmed case of swine flu at Fort Dix, New Jersey. So the feds came up with a vaccine
[1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:58.040]  that cost the taxpayers $135 million. And they started the swine flu vaccine March 24th of 76.
[1:45:58.040 --> 1:46:05.880]  They ended it October 12th of 76 because over 100 people had died from the deleterious effects
[1:46:05.880 --> 1:46:12.600]  and hundreds more were left either permanently paralyzed or deleteriously brain dead from the
[1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:20.440]  effects of the vaccine. So then they quit on October 12th of 76. Years later, when George W.
[1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:28.520]  Bush was president, he issued on May 9th, 2007, Presidential Directive 51, which means if your
[1:46:28.520 --> 1:46:36.040]  whole family gets wiped out from the deleterious effects of any vaccine, you can't sue the pharmaceutical
[1:46:36.040 --> 1:46:41.160]  company. So this thing has been in the making. This thing has been in the planning for a long,
[1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:50.680]  long time. Then fast forward to all around the 1980s, late 80s, early 90s. Johnny Carson,
[1:46:50.680 --> 1:46:57.800]  when he was still hosting the Tonight Show, had Dr. Robert Mendelson on as a guest. This man was
[1:46:57.800 --> 1:47:05.480]  a great medical doctor who didn't lie the way that Anthony Fauci has been all along. And he would
[1:47:05.480 --> 1:47:12.520]  answer all of Carson's questions. And Carson asked him, well, what about AIDS? He said AIDS was
[1:47:12.520 --> 1:47:20.600]  concocted at the Fort Detrick Army Lab in Fort Detrick, Maryland in 1978 and was deliberately
[1:47:20.600 --> 1:47:27.720]  introduced into the African population through World Health Organization smallpox vaccinations.
[1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:34.920]  And you could hear a pin drop. Well, guess what? Shortly after the interview, they claimed that
[1:47:34.920 --> 1:47:40.920]  Dr. Mendelson died of a heart attack. He was 60 years old and perfect health, didn't smoke,
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:48.200]  didn't drink, didn't use drugs, no fat on him. The man looked 30 years old, and yet they claimed
[1:47:48.200 --> 1:47:53.800]  he died of a heart attack. And by the way, John, I remember seeing that interview that like when
[1:47:53.800 --> 1:47:59.160]  YouTube came around like 50, 60 years ago and it's been removed, I couldn't find that Dr. Mendelson
[1:47:59.160 --> 1:48:05.000]  on Johnny Carson, maybe it's been re-uploaded. If somebody's got it, re-uploaded, so people should
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:09.880]  download archives, they should save them. But absolutely, my dad knew a lot of people
[1:48:10.760 --> 1:48:14.680]  in Dallas that worked for the government. And when I was like 10 years old, I said,
[1:48:14.680 --> 1:48:19.320]  dad, how bad is HIV? And he said, son, it's a biological weapon that only really attacks
[1:48:19.320 --> 1:48:23.960]  black people. Whites don't have enough receptor sites. It's very hard for a white person to get it.
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:28.200]  And then he basically talked about Dr. Mendelson. He also talked about people he knew that worked
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:31.480]  inside the government that had told him that and confirmed it as well. As my dad did,
[1:48:31.480 --> 1:48:36.600]  didn't work on the CIA and stuff like that to make a long story short. So this has been known for a
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:42.600]  long, long time. It's absolutely true. And John, you've been calling in for like 15, 16, maybe.
[1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:44.760]  How long you been calling in, John? You haven't gotten on in years?
[1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:49.160]  Oh, it's, you know, since little orphan Annie had pupils in her eyes.
[1:48:49.720 --> 1:48:53.480]  All right, brother, I said I'm gonna start that show years ago with our best callers. I never
[1:48:53.480 --> 1:48:57.080]  did it. But we finally have started doing it. So give me your name and number again. I want to
[1:48:57.080 --> 1:49:02.040]  have you on as a guest. All right. Wow. That was an incredible caller and absolutely powerful info
[1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:08.200]  he put out. Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's go ahead and talk to Dennis in Kentucky.
[1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:16.040]  Dennis, welcome. Thank you, Alex. First, I want to say this. If it's possible, could you please
[1:49:16.040 --> 1:49:21.320]  bring back the Emmerich's Essential Organic Mouthwash? Yes, we're trying to do that. It's just
[1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:24.440]  some of these products are expensive and you got to warehouse them. But yes, we're going to bring
[1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:29.080]  back a lot of the Emmerich's Essentials. The big company we're working with private labeling that
[1:49:29.880 --> 1:49:34.600]  the left found out who it was and threatened them. So we had to redo the whole Emmerich's Essentials
[1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:39.160]  line because during the deplatforming, they took that away from us. I'm sorry to hear that.
[1:49:40.520 --> 1:49:46.760]  Right now, I thoroughly believe Trump has woken up and so many people as far as America and its
[1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:51.720]  core values. Now it's time for real Americans to go and take in positions of government.
[1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:58.120]  And as far as this whole COVID thing, you're absolutely right. They're telling you everything
[1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:03.960]  is absolutely correct. The death that they were projecting is not through the actual COVID,
[1:50:03.960 --> 1:50:08.840]  it's through their vaccination. This is a modern Tuskegee experiment.
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:14.040]  You're right. It's a giant Tuskegee experiment. It's illegal and it's violent and them trying to
[1:50:14.040 --> 1:50:19.000]  again make us do it. They try to make us take the shot. They try to make us comply, make us
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:24.920]  wear the mask, make us go along with it. No, we must start resisting and pointing out what it is.
[1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:30.840]  Yes, sir. And that's the bottom line. Once you understand that you're absolutely correct,
[1:50:30.840 --> 1:50:37.560]  they're telling you it's not the actual virus that's going to kill you. It's the shot that's
[1:50:37.560 --> 1:50:42.280]  going to kill you. That's why everything is unraveling the way that it is. And you're right.
[1:50:42.280 --> 1:50:48.200]  Is President Trump the best president we ever had? Yes, he is. Does he have a fault? Yes,
[1:50:48.200 --> 1:50:53.560]  he does. Show me somebody who doesn't. Everybody's not going to get everything right all the time.
[1:50:53.560 --> 1:50:57.560]  It's just not possible. Well, I know for a fact Trump said things are a lot worse than he thought
[1:50:57.560 --> 1:51:01.800]  they were and he just doesn't understand all this stuff. He's getting educated now. He knew they
[1:51:01.800 --> 1:51:05.080]  were trying to keep things locked down by saying there wasn't a vaccine. He thought he'd bring
[1:51:05.080 --> 1:51:08.520]  it out. Remember he said you don't have to take it. Only old people need it. Remember all that,
[1:51:08.520 --> 1:51:12.600]  but it got away from him. And then it was a fight over who would control the vaccine and they said,
[1:51:12.600 --> 1:51:18.360]  oh, don't take Trump's vaccine, take ours. So it's all a giant mess. Regardless, he won the election.
[1:51:18.360 --> 1:51:23.000]  They're trying to steal it. I back President Trump. Those that don't back Trump are with Biden
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:26.360]  and the globalist. They want to act like, oh, they're holier than now. But no, they're with
[1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:30.200]  Biden. They're with the globalist. Thank you so much, Dennis. God bless you. And again, I say
[1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:34.600]  attack Trump where he's wrong. But the point is they're trying to steal this election and Biden's
[1:51:34.600 --> 1:51:38.120]  going to be 100 times worse. We'll be right back with more calls and then especially this.
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:45.160]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would. They've always been part of the
[1:51:45.160 --> 1:51:50.040]  establishment and it's only going to get worse. If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully
[1:51:50.040 --> 1:51:55.800]  taking office for a second term on January 20th, the system is going to drop the hammer harder
[1:51:55.800 --> 1:51:59.880]  than ever on this republic. They are going to explode gas prices. They're going to shut down
[1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:04.760]  our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the energy source to us. So it's impossible for
[1:52:04.760 --> 1:52:09.640]  factories to move back here. This is economic domination. This is economic war. We are being
[1:52:09.640 --> 1:52:14.040]  consolidated. We are being taken over. The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and
[1:52:14.040 --> 1:52:19.240]  states. They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them
[1:52:19.240 --> 1:52:24.760]  absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property. This is
[1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:29.480]  a monopolistic takeover. That's what the great reset is. Klaus Schwab and these other criminals
[1:52:29.480 --> 1:52:35.320]  admitted that's what social distancing is. So your business is only 25% for several more years.
[1:52:35.320 --> 1:52:39.160]  No small businesses will be there. This is a master plan. Say no.
[1:52:41.720 --> 1:52:47.560]  Imagine a dystopic novel or dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold,
[1:52:47.560 --> 1:52:51.080]  it can be locked up in your home. You can be taken away. You can be forcibly
[1:52:51.080 --> 1:52:56.440]  inoculated with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change your very DNA.
[1:52:56.440 --> 1:53:00.920]  Well, that's where you are in the year 2020. Global government, the United Nations,
[1:53:00.920 --> 1:53:05.880]  all the authoritarian groups admit they're doing it. They even admit that they're doing it for power
[1:53:06.520 --> 1:53:12.040]  and control and that they're not even worried about COVID-19. That's what Klaus Schwab and others
[1:53:12.040 --> 1:53:16.600]  have said. Think about how it's saying that as oh, a big tech's got to track you. They've got to
[1:53:16.600 --> 1:53:20.920]  trace you. They've got to control you. You've got to have absolutely leave your house. You've got
[1:53:20.920 --> 1:53:26.200]  to have secret police come disappear you because my God, this thing has one tenth of one percent chance
[1:53:26.200 --> 1:53:31.640]  of killing you. Give your ability to have cancer or a heart attack. This is their takeover.
[1:53:32.200 --> 1:53:37.320]  Imagine on America's death certificate killed by the fear of a common cold. Yeah,
[1:53:37.320 --> 1:53:53.720]  that's fear monitoring. That's mind control. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:03.640]  They needed some technical support in terms of being able to make their digital
[1:54:03.640 --> 1:54:09.880]  peace work. And it was great to see them work so close together. But it's just an example.
[1:54:10.680 --> 1:54:18.040]  I think faith communities in general have had many of the same. I followed. Why was my tag run?
[1:54:19.960 --> 1:54:23.720]  Did I break the law? No, sir. Then why are you here? We want to make sure that there's nothing
[1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:29.000]  done against you as well as what was done in the store with the mask. That's all. I want to know
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:37.240]  why my tag was run. Did I break the law? Did I break the law? You know I didn't break the law
[1:54:37.240 --> 1:54:42.360]  because the other cops said I didn't. So you're just harassing me. You chose to harass me. The
[1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:49.080]  other cop walked up to me and said you did nothing wrong. There's no problem. But you chose to run
[1:54:49.080 --> 1:54:59.160]  my tag. I told you my side of the story there. But you chose to run my tag. It doesn't matter
[1:55:00.120 --> 1:55:06.200]  what I have. It's not a law that people are required to wear a mask. Yes or no. It's a law.
[1:55:06.840 --> 1:55:13.240]  It's a law. You're telling me it's a law. You're telling me it's a law. I got to record it. You
[1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:18.840]  said it was a law. Ladies and gentlemen, you notice that they say the master is ever coming off now.
[1:55:18.840 --> 1:55:23.720]  But Governor Abbott here in Texas told Austin you can't lock the city down and have curfews.
[1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:26.840]  It's not a law. It's not a governor's order. Well, even the governor's order is crap.
[1:55:27.640 --> 1:55:34.440]  I say he doesn't have that power to say I'm not essential. But his mandate supposedly was going
[1:55:34.440 --> 1:55:39.800]  to end on the 28th. I've been looking to see if the Texas Humanitorial Order has been reissued.
[1:55:39.800 --> 1:55:45.000]  I didn't find it this morning. I just asked the crew to look again. But regardless, it's all
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:49.720]  Kabuki Theater. So we'll be talking about that with constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes,
[1:55:49.720 --> 1:55:53.880]  who's been at the tip of the spear exposing these lockdowns, the statistical fraud,
[1:55:54.440 --> 1:56:01.400]  and the rest of it. I'm going to ask him, where do we go? What do we do to counter all this
[1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:05.800]  illegality? And China's open. They've got their businesses going. They're advertising that America
[1:56:05.800 --> 1:56:09.960]  is never going to reopen. They say, oh, invest here. And the globalists are all invested there.
[1:56:09.960 --> 1:56:14.120]  That's what the Democrats as a class want the lockdown to continue. Look at big tech. Look
[1:56:14.120 --> 1:56:19.400]  at how they doubled their profits on average. My God, Jeff Bezos doubled his wealth during all
[1:56:19.400 --> 1:56:23.960]  of this Google, Apple. They're all exploding because they're vertically integrating us.
[1:56:25.080 --> 1:56:30.520]  This is the greatest crimes against humanity since the fascist and against, you know, the
[1:56:30.520 --> 1:56:36.440]  communists and all the things they did to civilization. It's simply an insane time to
[1:56:36.440 --> 1:56:41.720]  be alive. But first, we'll talk about what's going to happen on the six in the Senate,
[1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:46.040]  in the House. Does Trump still have a path to victory with all this new election fraud
[1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:52.760]  evidence coming out? Trump has cut off his Marlago visit early and has gone back to D.C.
[1:56:52.760 --> 1:56:58.280]  I'm told a lot of stuff is afoot. Barnes has been at the request of the president doing work as well.
[1:56:58.280 --> 1:57:02.040]  He will join us in the next segment. Let's jam in one more call right now, though.
[1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:04.440]  Tim in Washington, you got about a minute and a half. Welcome.
[1:57:06.680 --> 1:57:11.720]  Happy New Year, Alex. Happy New Year, America. Happy New Year, the world. The things that I'm
[1:57:11.720 --> 1:57:17.800]  going to do in 2021 is that I'm going to encourage Americans, free Americans, to get outside and make
[1:57:17.800 --> 1:57:24.520]  the resistance to new culture. That's what needs to happen. We can't be tied in our homes anymore
[1:57:24.520 --> 1:57:29.560]  and waiting for leadership to never show up and they never show up. I mean, and they will
[1:57:29.560 --> 1:57:34.520]  bend to the will of the people because it will make them. Also, I'd like to invite you to the Gates
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:39.960]  Foundation because every Saturday I bullhorn your latest videos, Bill Bigtree's latest videos,
[1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:43.960]  Dr. Francis Boyle's latest videos at the Gates Foundation for about three or four hours.
[1:57:45.480 --> 1:57:50.600]  Hopefully either you or Dell to show up. Is that in Washington state?
[1:57:50.600 --> 1:57:54.360]  It is. It's in Seattle. It's in Mercer. I'll just encourage.
[1:57:54.360 --> 1:57:58.360]  Do me a favor. Guys, get his name and number. I'd like to have this guy on as a guest.
[1:58:01.800 --> 1:58:06.920]  I want to get this fellow on as a guest, maybe on the Sunday show. Send us some of your videos.
[1:58:06.920 --> 1:58:11.560]  I know that there are demonstrations against Gates. I know that he hates it. I know that's
[1:58:11.560 --> 1:58:14.840]  a good thing. I think I've probably seen some of your videos then. So I'm going to put you on
[1:58:14.840 --> 1:58:19.320]  hold with my producer and they're going to try to set you up for a segment on the Sunday show.
[1:58:19.320 --> 1:58:23.400]  Does that work, Tim? Yeah, it does. I just have two other things to really talk about
[1:58:23.400 --> 1:58:26.120]  and that I'd love to be on your show and encourage listeners.
[1:58:26.120 --> 1:58:30.280]  Tim, let's do this. We're going to go to break. I got Robert Barnes coming up.
[1:58:30.280 --> 1:58:33.800]  So I'm going to put you on hold. We'll set you up for Sunday for a whole segment.
[1:58:33.800 --> 1:58:37.880]  Show some clips of what you do and have you on as a guest. I agree. Resistance culture is the
[1:58:37.880 --> 1:58:44.200]  answer. Resistance culture is the answer being defiant to tyranny and not complying, not submitting.
[1:58:44.200 --> 1:58:44.760]  They're right back.
[1:58:48.920 --> 1:58:53.480]  Fight for Trump. On January 6th in Washington, D.C.
[1:58:53.480 --> 1:59:00.280]  Our fight to drain the Washington swamp and reclaim America's destiny has just begun.
[1:59:00.280 --> 1:59:02.520]  It's 1776 times.
[1:59:04.840 --> 1:59:09.400]  On November 14th, hundreds of thousands of American patriots gathered in the nation's
[1:59:09.400 --> 1:59:14.120]  capital to stop the biggest election steal in American history. America is going under
[1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:19.880]  leftist martial law and the communist Chinese agent Joe Biden is able to get in there.
[1:59:19.880 --> 1:59:25.080]  He will put America under permanent lockdowns siege until we're brought to our knees.
[1:59:26.760 --> 1:59:31.000]  Hundreds of thousands return to D.C. in December. We will never give up.
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:36.520]  We will never surrender. We will never back down to the satanic, pedophile, globalist,
[1:59:36.520 --> 1:59:43.480]  new order. January 6th. Fight for Trump. D.C. Be there. We will never give in. We will never
[1:59:43.480 --> 2:00:09.480]  give up and we will never back down. We will never, ever surrender.
[2:00:13.560 --> 2:00:21.240]  It's the first broadcast of the Elmstown Show in the year 2021.
[2:00:21.800 --> 2:00:27.640]  I remember a little kid thinking about 2020 being a big year or the year 2000 being amazing.
[2:00:27.640 --> 2:00:34.200]  But here we are 2021 and constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes quietly crisscrossed the country
[2:00:34.200 --> 2:00:39.080]  at the behest of the president in the last 50, 60 days, however long it's been since November
[2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:43.960]  5th or 6th and we saw him in Georgia, saw him in other areas quietly beavering away.
[2:00:43.960 --> 2:00:52.040]  He can really give you the complex, parliamentary system of our constitution that is the marvel
[2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:56.840]  of the world, the checks and balances. The Democrats act like it's bad to question votes,
[2:00:56.840 --> 2:01:02.520]  act like it's bad to have electors, act like it's bad to have Senate and House checks and balances.
[2:01:02.520 --> 2:01:08.120]  But Trump's up against a lot of odds, a lot of swamp cowards, Republicans that want to parlay
[2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:12.600]  power and don't want Trump there blocking their lobbyist. So it's an uphill battle. Pence has come
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:18.200]  back. He was going to go to a European and Israeli vacation. Now he's going to be here on the 6th,
[2:01:18.200 --> 2:01:23.960]  though he's fighting lawsuits by Congressman Gomer in Texas to try to make him not certify this.
[2:01:23.960 --> 2:01:29.320]  Josh Hawley has come out and said he's going to do it. We need a second senator to go through that.
[2:01:29.320 --> 2:01:33.160]  We've got over 140 House members we're told that are going to try to block things. So to go over
[2:01:33.160 --> 2:01:39.960]  the math, the numbers, the facts, and the long shot Hail Mary, if it's still there, is Robert
[2:01:39.960 --> 2:01:44.280]  Barnes constitutional lawyer and good friend of mine. Robert, thanks for coming on during the
[2:01:44.280 --> 2:01:51.880]  first of the year here. Glad to be here. So let's tackle the best numbers, the best path to victory,
[2:01:51.880 --> 2:01:56.440]  the latest election fraud, what's really going on and what we can expect to happen on the 6th so far.
[2:01:56.440 --> 2:02:02.920]  So objections now will be, there's no doubt that objections will be made and they will have to
[2:02:02.920 --> 2:02:07.560]  conduct hearings because of Senator Hawley. Under the Electoral Count Act, all there has
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:12.920]  to be is one senator to join the objections for the House and the Senate to have to vote on those
[2:02:12.920 --> 2:02:19.000]  objections. And they're supposed to conduct two hours of debate. The president's team has requested
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:25.160]  that they be afforded some opportunity to present argument before Congress that has not yet been
[2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:31.400]  granted. So it may be up to the Congress members and senators themselves to state the nature of
[2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:36.840]  the objections and to explain the evidentiary foundation for those objections. But there's
[2:02:36.840 --> 2:02:42.520]  no doubt objections will be made. The question is only now how many states. The hope is that at
[2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:48.440]  least seven state electors will be objected to based on constitutional issues with the nature
[2:02:48.440 --> 2:02:54.200]  of those elections in those states that the first state up to object to will be Arizona.
[2:02:54.200 --> 2:03:01.560]  After that, there's Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and potentially New Mexico.
[2:03:01.560 --> 2:03:06.360]  And so the hope is that the there'll be meaningful hearings, meaningful evidence presented,
[2:03:06.360 --> 2:03:12.360]  and then it'll be up to two main actors. One is what happens is the House and the Senate go and
[2:03:12.360 --> 2:03:17.800]  debate it separately for two hours. They don't debate it together. So after the Senate and House,
[2:03:17.800 --> 2:03:23.080]  a senator and House member object, any electors from any state per electors, they go and debate
[2:03:23.080 --> 2:03:28.840]  for two hours. So potentially so that can be up to theoretically can be up to 100 hours or 102
[2:03:28.840 --> 2:03:35.080]  hours if every single state electors were objected to. But the assumption right now is that about
[2:03:35.080 --> 2:03:39.880]  seven states, they're looking to object to, they'll go and form in their own chambers, debate
[2:03:39.880 --> 2:03:45.640]  the objection for two hours, then come back and vote. And they vote as separate chambers.
[2:03:45.640 --> 2:03:51.800]  And here another key participant will be Vice President Pence. Vice President Pence could
[2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:56.600]  decide to say that there are competing electors from some of these states. Vice President Pence
[2:03:56.600 --> 2:04:01.880]  under the 12th Amendment could say that certain electors he refuses to certify due to constitutional
[2:04:01.880 --> 2:04:06.440]  questions about how the election was conducted in those states due to the lack of transparency,
[2:04:06.440 --> 2:04:10.920]  the lack of audits, the lack of signature match checks that took place in all of these states,
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:17.400]  despite multiple and myriad requests for that to occur. So it'll be how does the House vote,
[2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:21.640]  how does the Senate vote, and how does the Vice President act? Because how the Vice President
[2:04:21.640 --> 2:04:27.000]  acts can't have an impact on which vote matters from the House or the Senate. So all of those
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:30.840]  are played basically in play. And the question is, what do House members and senators do
[2:04:31.480 --> 2:04:35.480]  when presented with argument and evidence about these individual states electors?
[2:04:35.480 --> 2:04:40.440]  Do they uphold an unconstitutional election? Or do they contest that unconstitutional election?
[2:04:40.440 --> 2:04:47.800]  If more than, if Biden ends up with fewer than 270 electoral votes at the end of this process,
[2:04:48.840 --> 2:04:53.000]  then under the 12th Amendment, the election goes to the House of Representatives to vote by
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:58.600]  state delegation, not by individual members, but by state delegation. So and then that heavily
[2:04:58.600 --> 2:05:03.720]  favors Trump. So the big question, the first big question was, would a senator join the
[2:05:03.720 --> 2:05:09.560]  objections? We now know Senator Holly, that will happen. That means these votes have to take place.
[2:05:09.560 --> 2:05:14.120]  That means these hearings have to take place. And that gives the President, while a long shot,
[2:05:14.120 --> 2:05:19.800]  a shot, to have a constitutionally correct response take place to this unconstitutional
[2:05:19.800 --> 2:05:25.480]  election. What can we, the people do to put pressure? Obviously, March, what else?
[2:05:27.320 --> 2:05:31.320]  You know, for everybody to go to, the reason why the President has requested everybody go
[2:05:31.320 --> 2:05:36.920]  to D.C. that can on January 6th is for Congress to witness the public pressure.
[2:05:36.920 --> 2:05:41.480]  The, for those who cannot do so, either for a matter of means or other reasons,
[2:05:41.480 --> 2:05:46.040]  then the other option is to put pressure on every senator and House member there is.
[2:05:46.840 --> 2:05:52.600]  For the, to, you know, call them, email them, fax them, mail them, whatever you can do to let
[2:05:52.600 --> 2:05:57.720]  them know your opinion that if they, that they should vote to oppose and object to these electors,
[2:05:57.720 --> 2:06:02.360]  and that they should not certify an election that cannot be constitutionally certified as
[2:06:02.360 --> 2:06:07.720]  being consistent to the Constitution. And that is the case in many states, but clearly the states
[2:06:07.720 --> 2:06:12.600]  where it was very close, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia, but also as President in Michigan,
[2:06:12.600 --> 2:06:19.400]  Pennsylvania, Nevada, to some extent New Mexico, and other states. So the public can put continuous
[2:06:19.400 --> 2:06:24.360]  pressure on him because that's what's worked so far. That's what got Senator Hawley to admit and
[2:06:24.360 --> 2:06:30.440]  confess and to say he will in fact express his intent to object was because of the public pressure.
[2:06:30.440 --> 2:06:36.600]  The more they realize that the Trump's base will not support them in the future. If they do not
[2:06:36.600 --> 2:06:41.560]  fight for Trump, no one's going to come fight for them. That is what gives Trump the best chance
[2:06:41.560 --> 2:06:46.280]  to have a meaningful hearing, to have the most objections to the most electors, and to have the
[2:06:46.280 --> 2:06:52.920]  best. Oh, and just to have the best chance to get to the most votes. Well, you certainly called
[2:06:52.920 --> 2:07:00.760]  Amy Comey Barrett. You certainly called Mitch McConnell. But they really seem freaked out now
[2:07:00.760 --> 2:07:05.880]  as more election fraud evidence amounts. And as the public doesn't buy into this, this is really
[2:07:05.880 --> 2:07:11.560]  a constitutional crisis. No question, because it's an election that did not take place in a manner
[2:07:11.560 --> 2:07:16.040]  consistent to the constitutional requirement. The electors clause requires the state legislature
[2:07:16.040 --> 2:07:20.120]  to choose the method by which an election is conducted. That did not happen here. And it's
[2:07:20.120 --> 2:07:24.040]  acknowledged and admitted that that did not happen here. And the only debate has always been
[2:07:24.040 --> 2:07:28.680]  remedy. And the courts have basically said they're closed. They're not going to give remedy. They
[2:07:28.680 --> 2:07:33.720]  have there's been no evidentiary. Senator sass was out there being critical. And he was citing the
[2:07:33.720 --> 2:07:38.760]  New York Times and other people. There's been no evidentiary investigation by any law enforcement
[2:07:38.760 --> 2:07:44.040]  body of any meaningful quality into whether fraud occurred in this election. And the the big fraud
[2:07:44.040 --> 2:07:48.840]  is a fraud that's not really in controversy, which is the fraud on the Constitution, the fraud by
[2:07:48.840 --> 2:07:54.840]  having the election conducted in a manner directly contrary to the dictates of the electors clause,
[2:07:54.840 --> 2:07:59.880]  which was, as the Supreme Court admitted just two years ago, the most critically debated item in
[2:07:59.880 --> 2:08:04.440]  the entire Constitution. Let's expand on this. Let's expand as we come back. The legislatures did
[2:08:04.440 --> 2:08:09.000]  not take the president in this election. The legislatures have been cut out of this, which is
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:15.480]  really a giant power grab. Completely. The Democrats had the biggest problem that Democrats had
[2:08:15.480 --> 2:08:19.560]  was that in all of these key swing states, they didn't control those state legislatures.
[2:08:19.560 --> 2:08:24.200]  So constitutionally, they couldn't change the rules, yet they still did. They did by getting
[2:08:24.200 --> 2:08:29.720]  secret often secret deals, backroom deals with a bunch of executive officials who they did have
[2:08:29.720 --> 2:08:34.360]  influence and control over, even when they were nominally Republican to change the rules of the
[2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:40.600]  election. So this is really this is really a power grab by the executive and by lawyers and by
[2:08:40.600 --> 2:08:44.840]  bureaucracies. And obviously, these Republican leaders like the governor of Georgia, we find
[2:08:44.840 --> 2:08:48.760]  out are on the chai comp payroll, Mitch is on the chai comp payroll. We're now discovering,
[2:08:48.760 --> 2:08:53.160]  which we already knew, but the public is not just the Democrats on the Chinese communist tip.
[2:08:54.760 --> 2:08:59.000]  Well, I mean, it was with key Republican support that all of our jobs got shipped to China in the
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:05.400]  first place. So I mean, Mitch McConnell was neck deep in that. The Bush family was neck deep in
[2:09:05.400 --> 2:09:11.640]  that. So the betrayal of America for China that's been happening for two decades now was led as
[2:09:11.640 --> 2:09:16.520]  much by key Republican establishment leaders as it was Democrat. So it should come as no surprise
[2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:22.120]  that they would betray Trump at this key juncture, especially given that China is the main country
[2:09:22.120 --> 2:09:25.880]  that would benefit from a Biden presidency. That's right. And it's one that the globalist,
[2:09:25.880 --> 2:09:29.880]  both Republican and Democrat are using as their command base to sell out America to,
[2:09:29.880 --> 2:09:34.440]  and where there's no laws except tyranny, where they get away with it. And so I've got a plan,
[2:09:34.440 --> 2:09:38.680]  a talking point that's based in total reality that will defeat them, which is making it all about
[2:09:38.680 --> 2:09:44.040]  China. Get the Chinese communist out of both parties, go after them all, expose the depression,
[2:09:44.040 --> 2:09:50.040]  the shutdown is there to aid China and really just defeat them. Three, two, one. Here we go.
[2:09:50.040 --> 2:09:53.640]  It's back in stock. It's been sold out for over eight months. We couldn't get it because the lockdown
[2:09:53.640 --> 2:09:57.880]  pollen block is back in stock. Let me tell you a little bit about it. But the power of quail egg
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:10:01.320]  concentrate pollen block acts differently. The traditional antihistamines that was clinically
[2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:05.480]  studied alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear signage passages and aiding
[2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:11.000]  respiratory function. It's amazing. Folks absolutely love it. And again, France has been shut down,
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:17.160]  so we couldn't get it. Now a limited supply is back in stock, 25% off at infowarstore.com.

[2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:31.240]  unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and
[2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:35.960]  gives you a headache. This is naturally occurring. It's the secret of how the quail don't have the

[2:11:41.400 --> 2:11:53.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:05.480 --> 2:12:08.760]  All right, Robert Barnes was asked by Trump directly. He's done it.
[2:12:08.760 --> 2:12:12.840]  But the republic basically free of charge to race around the country and investigate.
[2:12:13.960 --> 2:12:18.680]  And he's been there. And I'm not trying to put down Linwood or Powell or any of these people.
[2:12:19.880 --> 2:12:25.400]  But we've seen fishers with Giuliani in them. So I don't want to get into infighting. Where's the
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:30.600]  real fraud? I mean, we know there's a lot of it. What's the best place to overturn these elections?
[2:12:30.600 --> 2:12:35.960]  I think it's what you just said. The legislatures ever passed this on its face. It's been easy for
[2:12:35.960 --> 2:12:40.840]  the Supreme Court, easy for Congress, easy for the legislatures to take over. How do we do that?
[2:12:40.840 --> 2:12:47.000]  Well, we put pressure on it. We've seen some movement. But then you see the Kraken and others
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:51.720]  keep talking about all this other things that there is some evidence of obviously electronic
[2:12:51.720 --> 2:12:56.600]  manipulation. The problem is how do you quantify that for courts in the time we've got? And then
[2:12:56.600 --> 2:13:02.440]  now we've got Linwood saying Jeffrey Epstein is still alive. Going after John Roberts, which I
[2:13:02.440 --> 2:13:06.520]  have seen evidence of him being blackmailed and obviously some weirdness with how he adopted his
[2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:12.680]  children. But some incredibly bold stuff by Linwood. Is Twitter scared of him? Because if I put
[2:13:12.680 --> 2:13:18.360]  something out, one tenth is extreme, I was banned. And so I'm just wondering what's really going on
[2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:23.640]  with Linwood in your view. Well, I think Linwood is doing a lot of damage to the president's case,
[2:13:24.360 --> 2:13:29.880]  particularly in Congress, where he needs votes. He needs votes out of house members and senators.
[2:13:29.880 --> 2:13:34.920]  And I think the reason why the media has been happy to let him go wild and why Twitter hasn't
[2:13:34.920 --> 2:13:40.040]  censored him at all is because they see them as helping Democrats and hurting Trump.
[2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:45.480]  I think he thinks he's helping Trump. But in fact, he's not because he's pursuing allegations
[2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:50.200]  that either cannot be proven at this stage or within this time frame, or allegations that
[2:13:50.200 --> 2:13:56.200]  distract from the core issues that can be proven. And frankly, Wood has been involved with a lot
[2:13:56.200 --> 2:14:01.480]  of the QAnon types, who believe a lot of stuff that just has not been proven true. And that that's
[2:14:01.480 --> 2:14:06.600]  a key problem. And unfortunately, Sidney Powell got entrapped by a lot of that. The machines was
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:13.800]  never a productive focal point. And the president saw that early on. The goal has been because
[2:14:13.800 --> 2:14:18.200]  the signature matches, they stuffed the ballots the old fashioned way. They weren't going to depend
[2:14:18.200 --> 2:14:22.360]  on machines to get to do what they did in this election. That's the reason why they did all
[2:14:22.360 --> 2:14:26.920]  these secret backroom deals. That was the point of the 80 million was to flood all that and be able
[2:14:26.920 --> 2:14:32.440]  to do it. Exactly. Flood the ballots, just pour ballots out everywhere, send them out everywhere
[2:14:32.440 --> 2:14:37.000]  so they would come back from everywhere. And we know that people that were not qualified to vote
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:41.320]  voted. We know that the vote count was not done in a constitutional manner because monitors were
[2:14:41.320 --> 2:14:46.200]  not allowed to be present in many key counties in many key states. And most importantly, we know
[2:14:46.200 --> 2:14:50.520]  the signatures don't match because they've never allowed any independent confirmation of the signature
[2:14:50.520 --> 2:14:55.560]  match process to occur. And a lot of the arguments that we've been presenting to the senators that
[2:14:55.560 --> 2:15:00.360]  Senator Hawley understood was the combination of this is an electors clause issue. Was this a
[2:15:00.360 --> 2:15:05.080]  constitutional election? If it wasn't, then it's up to Congress to have the House vote by state
[2:15:05.080 --> 2:15:10.200]  delegation when we have a contested presidential election under the 12th Amendment. And second,
[2:15:10.200 --> 2:15:16.120]  the major area of fraud was the massive lack of safeguards being instituted for mail and
[2:15:16.120 --> 2:15:21.480]  balloting. Because when you dig into the data, there's not a big difference between counties
[2:15:21.480 --> 2:15:26.120]  that have Dominion machines and don't have Dominion machines. Where there is a big difference
[2:15:26.120 --> 2:15:30.680]  is counties that had massive mail and balloting surges and those that didn't. That's where it
[2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:36.280]  looks like the ballot box was padded with questionable ballots. And there, the only court
[2:15:36.280 --> 2:15:41.960]  that has allowed any form of signature match check to occur did so in Arizona. And they found that
[2:15:41.960 --> 2:15:49.000]  the Democrats own expert found that 11% of the signatures did not match, which means that's
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:54.360]  you put that up throughout the whole state of Arizona. That's 30 times more than the margin
[2:15:54.360 --> 2:16:00.200]  of victory. So the biggest issue for Trump all the way through that he could have on January 6th
[2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:05.160]  is first, this was election was done in violation of the electors clause, which makes it unconstitutional,
[2:16:05.160 --> 2:16:10.600]  which makes the constitutional remedy voting by House delegation by state delegation in the House.
[2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:15.640]  And then second, that the election had a lot of illegal ballots cast not only by people who
[2:16:15.640 --> 2:16:19.240]  weren't qualified to vote because they were outside of the state, they were non residents,
[2:16:19.240 --> 2:16:25.640]  they were non citizens or in some cases, they were dead. But also because critically, and there was
[2:16:25.640 --> 2:16:29.480]  no monitored count of the vote that took place, that's deeply problematic. But the big one has
[2:16:29.480 --> 2:16:34.280]  always been the signatures just don't match. The one time they allowed us to take a look at it,
[2:16:34.280 --> 2:16:40.200]  the Democrats own expert admitted that 11% of the signatures don't match. That's far bigger than
[2:16:40.200 --> 2:16:45.560]  the margin of victory in all of these states. And that means the remedy is to go to vote to the
[2:16:45.560 --> 2:16:51.160]  House by state delegation, where the president has a six state edge, and that quantify that for
[2:16:51.160 --> 2:16:54.920]  people that aren't constitutional lawyer, how that would how that would happen if the House
[2:16:54.920 --> 2:16:58.520]  and Senate voted to do that, what the states would then do what that would look like.
[2:16:59.800 --> 2:17:05.320]  So what would happen is if President Joe Biden does not reach 270 electoral votes
[2:17:05.320 --> 2:17:11.480]  that are uncontested and that have not yet been certified, then the remedy under the 12th Amendment
[2:17:11.480 --> 2:17:16.760]  is to go to the House. Now the Vice President Pence, there is an interpretation of the 12th
[2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:22.120]  Amendment, the Vice President Pence can do this all by himself, that he can say there's a contest
[2:17:22.120 --> 2:17:27.400]  involving too many states. So there's not enough, neither candidate has more than 270 electoral votes.
[2:17:28.200 --> 2:17:33.080]  So under the 12th Amendment, the House must vote now by state delegation. So all the and in some
[2:17:33.080 --> 2:17:39.080]  houses, you have a tie, so the vote probably wouldn't count. But it's the it's the newly
[2:17:39.080 --> 2:17:43.720]  seeded House, not the old House, but the newly seeded House that would vote, they would vote
[2:17:43.720 --> 2:17:52.200]  by state and whoever gets 26 states to vote for them wins. Or if it's 25 and 23 and two are tied,
[2:17:52.200 --> 2:18:00.200]  they win. So the the president has an edge with 27 states. Wow, this makes the Georgia election
[2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:05.160]  also more important than ever. Yes, that's why the that's why he Trump has been pursuing it.
[2:18:05.160 --> 2:18:11.240]  He knows he needs those Republican senators to have a chance to get to the House delegation
[2:18:11.240 --> 2:18:15.880]  in the first place. Because if he doesn't win at least the Senate in testing the election,
[2:18:15.880 --> 2:18:21.960]  sure, he needs, let's say Vice President Pence comes in and says, I can't certify
[2:18:21.960 --> 2:18:26.920]  electors from these states, the House and the Senate could object to his decision.
[2:18:26.920 --> 2:18:31.320]  And as long as one of the two chambers went with Trump, then those votes would not count.
[2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:36.200]  But what happens then? I mean, what's procedurally does it go back to the states and then they
[2:18:36.200 --> 2:18:41.560]  have reelections there? They have new elections? No, it goes. The ultimate remedy is it always
[2:18:41.560 --> 2:18:46.520]  goes to the House to vote by state delegation under the 12th Amendment. So and then we'll just decide
[2:18:46.520 --> 2:18:52.760]  which way those states really went. Exactly. And correct. And it's the people who they voted in.
[2:18:52.760 --> 2:18:58.120]  So when we vote our House members each year, we're giving them the power to choose a
[2:18:58.120 --> 2:19:03.560]  president if the election is contested. Sure. And I understand that path. I'm saying,
[2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:07.800]  is there not another way so they don't claim Trump overturn the election as a dictator
[2:19:07.800 --> 2:19:11.640]  for the ignorant people out there to say we're going to have a new election? Because even the UN,
[2:19:11.640 --> 2:19:15.240]  the State Department, say if there's not poll watchers, if there's big questions,
[2:19:15.240 --> 2:19:18.920]  you should redo. That's the international standard. That's the American standard.
[2:19:18.920 --> 2:19:21.880]  We don't normally have to redo elections, but I think this is the time to do it. Is there a
[2:19:21.880 --> 2:19:27.640]  path to do that? Congress could do that. Congress could set another election day and say that
[2:19:27.640 --> 2:19:32.200]  given the contested presidential election, we're going to have election day on January 19th,
[2:19:32.200 --> 2:19:37.000]  for example. Yeah, I think they're too cowardly when the Democrats have done this gaslighting,
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:42.440]  saying they won and run the scam. I think there's just too cowardly these people in Congress to
[2:19:42.440 --> 2:19:46.920]  absolutely overturn the fraud, which they should. But I think the third way is a new election.
[2:19:46.920 --> 2:19:52.120]  I think Trump's leaning towards that. I've been told. Have you talked to him? He was always open
[2:19:52.120 --> 2:19:56.120]  to that, but he preferred his original remedy, of course, was preferred that he be declared the
[2:19:56.120 --> 2:20:01.640]  winner based on an honest vote count as happened in 1876 when they threw out the illegal votes
[2:20:01.640 --> 2:20:06.440]  and they counted illegal votes. His second remedy was to have the House elect him
[2:20:07.080 --> 2:20:10.680]  under because that was the easiest constitutional remedy. But as you know,
[2:20:10.680 --> 2:20:15.320]  if that remedy is politically not available, then the alternative is a new election in the
[2:20:15.320 --> 2:20:19.480]  contested states. And then let's talk about what happens then while they have a selection,
[2:20:19.480 --> 2:20:23.240]  say in two months. And then there's a whole court battle about do they allow mail in balance again,
[2:20:23.240 --> 2:20:26.600]  which we're seeing in the Georgia Senate races. And then we'll talk about the whole
[2:20:26.600 --> 2:20:30.680]  world government lockdown COVID that allowed all this happen with Robert Barnes. He's one of the
[2:20:30.680 --> 2:20:36.360]  smartest brains when it comes to that as well on the fight forward in 2021 to regain our liberties
[2:20:36.360 --> 2:20:45.960]  from this giant globalist authoritarian and COVID hopes blitzkrieg. Stay with us in full wars dot girl.
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:11.720]  But they want businessman technocrats over it. And that's who Claus Schwab is. You might want to
[2:21:11.720 --> 2:21:16.280]  look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you
[2:21:16.280 --> 2:21:21.480]  poor. You might want to find out who this super villain is. You see, he believes because he's
[2:21:21.480 --> 2:21:25.960]  hidden playing you and you're not speaking out against it that he has the right to do it to you.
[2:21:25.960 --> 2:21:30.440]  You might want to find who he works for. He works directly for Prince Charles. He developed
[2:21:30.440 --> 2:21:36.280]  since the 80s the plan for global sustainability. That means worldwide neo feudalism in his own
[2:21:36.280 --> 2:21:41.160]  works. So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you
[2:21:41.160 --> 2:21:45.240]  for you take those shots. You might just want to find out who this villain is. All right.
[2:21:47.720 --> 2:21:52.600]  The great reset is here. World government has openly been announced and its plan is to bankrupt
[2:21:52.600 --> 2:21:57.640]  you and your family and to make you so poor you're forced on to a universal guaranteed
[2:21:57.640 --> 2:22:02.600]  income forced inoculations and you must pledge allegiance to the leftist globalist system.
[2:22:02.600 --> 2:22:07.640]  That's why it's important to pray to God be politically active and get prepared for self

[2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:14.520]  with travel passports and telling you it's going to be the law they're obviously trying to normalize
[2:25:14.520 --> 2:25:21.080]  that right now and and what you think we as the people can do to resist this but but first any
[2:25:21.080 --> 2:25:27.720]  other points about the contested election trump victory what he needs to do let me ask you this
[2:25:27.720 --> 2:25:32.520]  question and then you can elaborate why isn't trump doing resolute death speeches every night
[2:25:33.320 --> 2:25:38.040]  why isn't he cutting through all the censorship he's the only one that can really do it at that
[2:25:38.040 --> 2:25:42.120]  level and and dramatically educating people i've always been waiting for the evidence of fraud
[2:25:42.120 --> 2:25:49.400]  it's come out he's given him a handful of speeches i mean less than two you know two hands less than
[2:25:49.400 --> 2:25:55.400]  less than ten since then that november fourth early morning saying i won this is a scan these
[2:25:55.400 --> 2:26:00.760]  are bad people i mean he knew this was coming he predicted at all why are we not seeing more from
[2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:06.680]  the president i think it's because of the the fundamental weakness the president has had throughout
[2:26:06.680 --> 2:26:12.440]  his four-year tenure has been the lack of allies and key positions of power around him and he's
[2:26:12.440 --> 2:26:18.280]  coming to terms with the full recognition of what that means as he sees mcconnell's recommended
[2:26:18.280 --> 2:26:23.080]  judges betray him at every single level as he sees mcconnell tries to betray him in the senate on
[2:26:23.080 --> 2:26:29.320]  the upcoming vote as he sees what's happened with the republican governors in arizona and georgia
[2:26:29.320 --> 2:26:35.160]  undermining him so he now fully appreciates it but i think he undervalued it before and he had
[2:26:35.160 --> 2:26:39.800]  too few allies and the effect of it it's smart allies would have him periscoping every single
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:45.480]  day would have him doing you know introducing trump tv now and doing at least one hour updates
[2:26:45.480 --> 2:26:50.680]  every single night answering questions connecting to people directly getting people proactive had
[2:26:50.680 --> 2:26:56.200]  he controlled the narrative in that manner then some of this lin sanity from lin wood and some
[2:26:56.200 --> 2:27:01.880]  of these other q movements could not have uh diverted people's attention and big tech wouldn't
[2:27:01.880 --> 2:27:07.320]  have seen a green light to even start censoring him i mean this showed weakness but nothing about
[2:27:07.320 --> 2:27:11.320]  being around the swamp even trying to organize these trump events this week these people will
[2:27:11.320 --> 2:27:15.880]  lie right to your face while they stab you in the back i mean this is just next level what the swamp
[2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:21.000]  is produced yeah and i think it's the one thing trump wasn't fully prepared for he didn't understand
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  the degree to which even though he won because of the institutionalized corrosive corruption
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:32.520]  of washington dc over the past several decades he didn't fully appreciate that that meant he needed
[2:27:32.520 --> 2:27:38.200]  to truly drain the swamp and purge them of their bad actors he thought he could negotiate with them
[2:27:38.200 --> 2:27:42.680]  he thought he could that they would be reasonable and intelligent and recognize that his direction
[2:27:42.680 --> 2:27:47.640]  is the smart and savvy direction they don't understand that at all that's why mitch mcconnell
[2:27:47.640 --> 2:27:52.760]  is doing everything possible to kill the republicans chance to even hold the senate by every bad
[2:27:52.760 --> 2:27:58.520]  strategic decision he's made over the past month particularly undermining the president so i think
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:04.680]  that hopefully he'll start to put that together he did just tweet out that he wants people meeting
[2:28:04.680 --> 2:28:09.800]  gathering on january 6 and that he's going to be apparently he's going to be there and he's
[2:28:09.800 --> 2:28:13.560]  mentioned even a specific time and that location details are going to come out about where it's
[2:28:13.560 --> 2:28:18.280]  going to be so this is going to be not just a stop the steel rally it's going to be a formal
[2:28:18.280 --> 2:28:23.480]  trump rally at this point uh when he's giving locational details about where events are going
[2:28:23.480 --> 2:28:27.480]  to take place where speakers are going to participate well bards i haven't told you this because i
[2:28:27.480 --> 2:28:32.840]  didn't want to become the story but but let me just tell you um no one was putting the money up
[2:28:32.840 --> 2:28:39.960]  two weeks ago for freedom pauses so i put the initial money up and it's a lot of money then the
[2:28:39.960 --> 2:28:46.600]  secret service got involved that we got some folks got contacted they reached out and they said
[2:28:46.600 --> 2:28:50.920]  they want it on the mall now that there's not tall buildings around it where the jericho march was a
[2:28:50.920 --> 2:28:56.600]  few weeks ago then two days three days ago they go no it's going to be on the ellipse outside the
[2:28:56.600 --> 2:28:59.960]  white house across from it so they can have a controlled group and there's a larger group
[2:28:59.960 --> 2:29:04.360]  outside of that they're gonna have a peaceful march on the capital and he he was going to be
[2:29:04.360 --> 2:29:10.680]  speaking in the afternoon we thought it probably we was given a menu of ideas we thought and i
[2:29:10.680 --> 2:29:17.160]  was at all these meetings uh that that a morning before the debate starts at at one before pence
[2:29:17.160 --> 2:29:22.520]  is supposed to gavel this in to have it start at about 11 and then he'll speak right at noon and
[2:29:22.520 --> 2:29:26.200]  there's actually an event going on before that for several hours and so that's what's going on
[2:29:26.200 --> 2:29:31.160]  that's what's unfolding uh and again um i put the money down because this is all private folks
[2:29:31.160 --> 2:29:35.720]  the president doesn't pay for these things with taxpayer money uh so like like like his inauguration
[2:29:35.720 --> 2:29:39.640]  was paid for by donors well i put the money down for that even though i didn't really have extra
[2:29:39.640 --> 2:29:44.200]  money i spent i did it was uh hundreds of thousands of dollars and then a big donor came through and
[2:29:44.200 --> 2:29:47.560]  took care of that for us it's not about me bragging it's just people know the history
[2:29:47.560 --> 2:29:51.800]  trump is speaking at noon at the ellipse the secret service might change at the last minute
[2:29:51.800 --> 2:29:57.960]  but it's about to be built uh right now well i think that's critical i think you the you know
[2:29:57.960 --> 2:30:04.440]  it was andrew jackson's uh constituency rating the capital that that leveraged his power over
[2:30:04.440 --> 2:30:10.360]  have been through his uh first term in 1828 they'll be willing to take on the bank and even ignore
[2:30:10.360 --> 2:30:14.840]  the court's orders famously saying that the court's issued its order they can try to enforce it
[2:30:14.840 --> 2:30:19.480]  and trying to force a bank on the country and he helped prevent that concentration of financial
[2:30:19.480 --> 2:30:24.840]  power for three decades that ended up leading to the biggest democratic expansion of economics in
[2:30:24.840 --> 2:30:29.960]  world history arguably but definitely in american history at the time so it's critical that as many
[2:30:29.960 --> 2:30:34.280]  people may be there as possible so that congress feels the pressure because there's some house
[2:30:34.280 --> 2:30:39.480]  members and senators who've been convincing themselves lying to themselves that uh that
[2:30:39.480 --> 2:30:44.600]  getting past trump will make them more popular and that these mail you know letters that they've
[2:30:44.600 --> 2:30:49.560]  been receiving emails and texts and and all of it in phone calls they're really those that's just
[2:30:49.560 --> 2:30:54.920]  artificial activity and it's not a reflection of a real grassroots commitment to trump uh and that's
[2:30:54.920 --> 2:31:00.040]  where you know if they see a million people there uh that's gonna we that's gonna awaken them if they
[2:31:00.040 --> 2:31:05.160]  see more people there then they're gonna show up theoretically for biden's uh inaugural then that
[2:31:05.160 --> 2:31:10.440]  will let them know where they have to vote and if if if they can hold the line in the senate or get
[2:31:10.440 --> 2:31:15.400]  vice president pence to step up to the plate either one then the president has it's still a long
[2:31:15.400 --> 2:31:19.080]  shot but he has a fighting chance oh absolutely and regardless it's to let the system know we're
[2:31:19.080 --> 2:31:23.880]  not accepting joe biden and day one they said trump was a russian agent no proof he's a russian
[2:31:23.880 --> 2:31:28.600]  agent he's a chinese agent open and shut evidence and we're taking action and so that's what this is
[2:31:28.600 --> 2:31:32.840]  all about but i told the story of how this happened and i just handed it off immediately
[2:31:32.840 --> 2:31:37.960]  because no one else was stepping up and there wasn't a magical q group there wasn't a magical intel
[2:31:37.960 --> 2:31:42.680]  group doing it and i had you know general flinn called me yesterday and said you know i'm sorry
[2:31:42.680 --> 2:31:46.520]  about how it looked like when i got startled by you that i'm not a friend and they said i'm sorry
[2:31:46.520 --> 2:31:51.160]  that happened i said i totally understand he's gonna be there so everybody's together everybody's
[2:31:51.160 --> 2:31:57.000]  good everything's great i just want people to know wasn't magic q doing it was alex jones and a great
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:32:01.640]  lady who who who helped us do it and then paved the line sure of it we salute her she knows that
[2:32:01.640 --> 2:32:06.520]  she is doesn't want any credit i just want people to know that's how rag tag it is that trump called
[2:32:06.520 --> 2:32:12.120]  you you know however many days ago 50 something days ago 60 days ago and said please come help us and
[2:32:12.120 --> 2:32:17.080]  you know we got the call and it's it's rag tag your cnn got that right trump has a rag tag group
[2:32:17.080 --> 2:32:22.200]  defending him so it's us folks he needs us we need him let's go to dc to let them know we're aware
[2:32:22.200 --> 2:32:28.040]  of their activity regardless of the occupation of dc starts now well and i think exactly i mean it's
[2:32:28.040 --> 2:32:33.000]  what led to any sort of form of change or reform has been the willingness and readiness to publicly
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:37.560]  engage in a democratic manner uh and a little d democratic manner and that's going to be key
[2:32:37.560 --> 2:32:42.280]  no matter what happens regardless of what the it's the best it's the only shot the president has is
[2:32:42.280 --> 2:32:47.720]  massive public pressure on the congress and then secondarily even if that doesn't go the way it
[2:32:47.720 --> 2:32:53.160]  needs to go it's the beginning of a real movement that it has that is with that can last longer
[2:32:53.160 --> 2:32:58.840]  and runs deeper and goes wider than the trump movement did over the last four years for those
[2:32:58.840 --> 2:33:02.440]  that don't know we'll talk about when we come back and then hit the vaccine stuff and then the covid
[2:33:02.440 --> 2:33:08.760]  lockdown but this happened to jackson he got it stolen many bigger later we'll talk about what
[2:33:08.760 --> 2:33:13.480]  trump's role should be if they effectively steal it he's got to never concede and just be the president
[2:33:13.480 --> 2:33:18.280]  in abstention uh in in exile and just keep building the movement against them you agree with that
[2:33:19.320 --> 2:33:23.800]  oh no doubt about it and it needs to be at the there's been too much focus at the top
[2:33:23.800 --> 2:33:27.880]  hue always focuses on the top we need to focus this needs to be a bottom up revolution if it's
[2:33:27.880 --> 2:33:32.040]  going to work if we're going to have real populist reform and resist the sort of chinese
[2:33:32.040 --> 2:33:37.000]  communist model for future world governance then we have to start with our own that's right
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:41.160]  robert barnes robert barnes law stay there we're gonna come right back with a final conclusion
[2:33:45.320 --> 2:33:50.760]  mountain patriot in colorado thank you for holding how you doing alex man i'm just working as
[2:33:50.760 --> 2:33:55.080]  hard as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you i love you man i want to
[2:33:55.080 --> 2:34:00.920]  make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've been using it quite a while and i just went
[2:34:00.920 --> 2:34:04.920]  looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see that it contains quercetin
[2:34:05.800 --> 2:34:13.400]  which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited is an ionophore similar to
[2:34:13.400 --> 2:34:19.480]  hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want to take a look
[2:34:19.480 --> 2:34:26.840]  at that all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at these high-end products that they
[2:34:26.840 --> 2:34:31.080]  sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle
[2:34:31.080 --> 2:34:34.200]  because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks
[2:34:34.200 --> 2:34:39.160]  and so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this so
[2:34:39.160 --> 2:34:51.320]  thanks thanks for the plug the word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden
[2:34:52.600 --> 2:35:00.920]  and now that all the lies are being revealed what will you do we know that millions will do
[2:35:00.920 --> 2:35:08.280]  absolutely nothing they will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a virtue it is the

[2:41:45.960 --> 2:41:53.160]  going back to robert marnes marnes let's uh talk about because you are one of the best brains
[2:41:53.160 --> 2:41:58.360]  just wide spectrum what would you call this giant fraud 11 months in of the covid rollout the world
[2:41:58.360 --> 2:42:02.840]  government the un the liability protection people getting so sick from the vaccines they don't care
[2:42:03.400 --> 2:42:07.080]  it seems like they're trying to invoke a mass stock home syndrome or something what's the
[2:42:07.080 --> 2:42:13.320]  the big methodology here well definitely is a real world a milgram experiment on a global scale
[2:42:13.960 --> 2:42:19.160]  it what is they've been the system has tried for centuries to figure out how to control the populace
[2:42:19.160 --> 2:42:24.920]  how to control whatever group of people it has under its governance and you know they tried foreign
[2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:30.440]  enemies but that only got so far they tried domestic crime but that only got so far it turns
[2:42:30.440 --> 2:42:35.480]  out that a virus is the easiest way to get people to do whatever the government tells them to do
[2:42:35.480 --> 2:42:40.120]  no matter how ludicrous it may be even if they contradict themselves like they did with masks
[2:42:40.120 --> 2:42:45.400]  I mean within months they went to don't wear them to you have to wear them and all of it and now
[2:42:45.400 --> 2:42:51.080]  of course they're trying to rush an experimental drug and that's all a vaccine is an experimental
[2:42:51.080 --> 2:42:55.560]  drug with a fancy label on it that's supposed to have a particularized therapeutic purpose but
[2:42:55.560 --> 2:43:00.040]  it's still a drug at the end of the day and this is an experimental one being rushed through on an
[2:43:00.040 --> 2:43:05.400]  emergency protocol and procedure and and done in a way that has not had the kind of testing that we
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:10.600]  normally should have done and done for a virus that there's never been a coronavirus for which
[2:43:10.600 --> 2:43:16.760]  there's never been a successful vaccine and now the world health organization admitted this week
[2:43:16.760 --> 2:43:21.800]  that in fact this vaccine won't actually vaccinate you all it will do is reduce the likelihood of
[2:43:21.800 --> 2:43:26.920]  you getting particularly severe symptoms but it doesn't stop the transmission at all so the I mean
[2:43:26.920 --> 2:43:32.760]  what would now in fact they're now admitting it was an autoimmune response to other cold viruses so
[2:43:32.760 --> 2:43:36.040]  this is a diabolical plan I think they're just setting the precedent to do whatever they want
[2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:40.600]  whenever they want to get enough people on board where then everyone's in denial into the future
[2:43:40.600 --> 2:43:46.760]  this is like this is a giant assault it's very much they've looked to the Chinese model of governance
[2:43:46.760 --> 2:43:52.280]  to to apply that worldwide so just as they've using the Chinese social credit model system
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:43:57.400]  and how they're doing big tech censorship and suppression against dissident views and decrediting
[2:43:57.400 --> 2:44:02.680]  and discrediting those views in exchange for others they've taken the Chinese model and system
[2:44:02.680 --> 2:44:07.960]  for governing their own population and trying to apply it here not only creating super soldiers
[2:44:07.960 --> 2:44:12.120]  with mRNA they're not really super soldiers they're doing medical experiments on trips but you call
[2:44:12.120 --> 2:44:18.520]  it super soldiers. It's China who started out with so much of this mRNA testing it's China that
[2:44:18.520 --> 2:44:24.360]  released this virus it's China that used the lockdown as a mechanism of responding to a virus
[2:44:24.360 --> 2:44:28.920]  when that's never been successful in the history of the world and America's never done it before
[2:44:28.920 --> 2:44:34.760]  and now they're coming with a forced vaccine notably China doesn't believe that a vaccine
[2:44:34.760 --> 2:44:39.960]  is necessary their people are out partying in Wuhan last night on New Year's Eve so they created
[2:44:39.960 --> 2:44:44.760]  this storyline that was terrifying and frightening of bodies dropping dead and now we flash forward
[2:44:44.760 --> 2:44:49.880]  to New Year's Eve China's economy is doing great its governance model system is being expanded
[2:44:49.880 --> 2:44:54.760]  and exported throughout the world the US is struggling well Wuhan is celebrating uh with
[2:44:54.760 --> 2:44:59.000]  everybody close together and many of them not even wearing masks so it gives you an idea for
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:04.040]  what really happened and that's why the next big fight in the US politically and legally
[2:45:04.040 --> 2:45:10.680]  is going to be enforcing the Nuremberg code the Nuremberg Accords which said they cannot do
[2:45:10.680 --> 2:45:17.720]  any form of invasive medical treatment on you without your informed consent any form of mandatory
[2:45:17.720 --> 2:45:24.120]  vaccines violates the Nuremberg code violates the Nuremberg Accord we said it would it would be never
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:29.960]  again would we allow any state to force medical treatment on another human being without their
[2:45:29.960 --> 2:45:35.240]  informed consent and yet that is precisely what employers are planning governments are planning
[2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:40.920]  all around the west and again Robert Barnes this is like if Hitler was bad what she was that was
[2:45:40.920 --> 2:45:47.240]  1.0 this is like 5.0 this is like way worse way crazier all the scientists look at it and go
[2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:52.040]  this will kill you this is insane jellyfish genes whole human genomes nothing to do with
[2:45:52.040 --> 2:45:57.480]  COVID-19 a lot of the vaccines make you test positive for HIV I mean this is like a crazy
[2:45:57.480 --> 2:46:04.040]  psycho luni activity because psychos finally want it all they finally just go crazy like Hitler did
[2:46:04.040 --> 2:46:08.360]  and you look at Bill Gates as a eugenicist and you got to wonder where the hell does this guy
[2:46:08.360 --> 2:46:14.360]  think he's taking us well it's it's them having ultimate control over his own over the world's
[2:46:14.360 --> 2:46:19.000]  population not only the number of us that live Bill Gates is publicly on record saying he wants
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:25.480]  to reduce the number of live human beings in the future by the by the tens and hundreds of millions
[2:46:25.480 --> 2:46:30.760]  and even billions over time and then and it's also the mindset of control just people who like
[2:46:30.760 --> 2:46:35.800]  control who want control and seek control and that's why now the upside to what the World Health
[2:46:35.800 --> 2:46:41.720]  Organization said is that constitutionally I'll be debating Alan Dershowitz Professor Dershowitz
[2:46:41.720 --> 2:46:47.320]  on this in the coming weeks but I don't believe that even his argument holds water anymore about
[2:46:47.320 --> 2:46:53.000]  mandating vaccines if a vaccine does not in fact prevent transmission of the virus that's the only
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:46:58.840]  legal excuse they've ever had is to say a person presents a clear and present danger without being
[2:46:58.840 --> 2:47:04.840]  vaccinated because they could transmit the virus everybody agrees even Dershowitz that you cannot
[2:47:04.840 --> 2:47:09.640]  force a vaccine on someone solely for their own benefit and by the way Robert I would invite you
[2:47:09.640 --> 2:47:14.440]  and Dershowitz on and I would fairly moderate I would not even make comments I would love to
[2:47:14.440 --> 2:47:19.080]  have a commercial free deal millions would tune in my Joe Rogan interview has 3.2 million views
[2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:23.320]  and something like that I think we get millions of views and you guys can repost it wherever but
[2:47:23.320 --> 2:47:28.440]  I would love to have you guys on for like an hour long commercial free debate then I would air
[2:47:28.440 --> 2:47:34.360]  excerpts on the show that'd be a great idea oh yeah yeah he's a game for it he's up for it so the
[2:47:34.360 --> 2:47:38.120]  so we're discussing you set it up and you tell me the time and some afternoon we'll just tape
[2:47:38.120 --> 2:47:41.960]  an hour or we can stream it live and then I'll air it on the show the next day how's that sound
[2:47:42.680 --> 2:47:47.320]  oh yeah sounds great so it's basically his schedule is dictating the time in the terms
[2:47:47.320 --> 2:47:51.160]  well I know you talk to him so so and you said what you want about Dershowitz and all the weirdness
[2:47:51.160 --> 2:47:55.080]  but he is one of the top lawyers in the world and that's why it's shocking to see him write on so
[2:47:55.080 --> 2:48:00.760]  many things be be be be you know talking about plunging needles in people's arms well he has
[2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:05.720]  deep deference to the professional class and that's where we have our strongest disagreement
[2:48:05.720 --> 2:48:11.000]  he trusts the experts in other fields that he wouldn't trust in his own legal field but that's
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:14.920]  why we have to challenge it and contest it if we do not have the right to protect their own
[2:48:14.920 --> 2:48:19.800]  bodies from having a forced drug stuck into our systems then what rights do we have we have no
[2:48:19.800 --> 2:48:23.880]  rights this is the final revolution against our very persons our very DNA we'll do five more
[2:48:23.880 --> 2:48:28.840]  minutes with us and you're gonna go then deal big tree powerful interview uh coming up and then
[2:48:28.840 --> 2:48:33.160]  we've got the one the only not our nick beggars hour number four straight ahead
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:42.360]  the year 2021 is almost here and so we're launching our new year's specials right now

[2:49:44.360 --> 2:49:48.680]  course the united nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and

[2:50:00.360 --> 2:50:06.040]  rock n feller foundation all the rest of them at 10 to 21 to 20 30 it's here and only gets worse
[2:50:06.040 --> 2:50:12.680]  like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all and the rejection
[2:50:12.680 --> 2:50:18.920]  starts with realizing it's spiritual battle diverse evil and stopping abortion we must start
[2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:25.320]  valuing human life again we must start saying that we are not expendable that we are not disposable
[2:50:25.320 --> 2:50:32.680]  that we are essential until we do that we are all slaves we must stand up and declare our basic god
[2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:41.800]  given human rights now you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:46.760 --> 2:50:51.960]  i'd like to call to order this secret conclave of america's media empires we're here to come up
[2:50:51.960 --> 2:50:56.600]  with the next phony baloney crisis to put americans back where they belong and dark rooms
[2:50:56.600 --> 2:51:01.480]  glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials well i think in bc you are here
[2:51:01.480 --> 2:51:06.840]  to listen and not speak i think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health care yeah
[2:51:08.120 --> 2:51:12.520]  a new disease no one's immune it's like the summer of the shark except instead of a shark
[2:51:12.520 --> 2:51:18.040]  it's an epidemic and instead of summer it's all the time that is okay now i hate to be the guy who
[2:51:18.040 --> 2:51:24.680]  derails what everybody else loves he loves being that guy but janice we do have standards this can't
[2:51:24.680 --> 2:51:30.840]  be a made up disease the only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public
[2:51:30.840 --> 2:51:35.560]  we do have something we've been holding on to but it hasn't been tested get over here in bc
[2:51:37.880 --> 2:51:48.120]  we certainly believe in testing but i oh wow wow oh yeah so we've got our deadly disease
[2:51:48.120 --> 2:51:53.480]  now we just have to blame it on something that's in every household something that
[2:51:53.480 --> 2:51:58.680]  people are a little bit afraid of already house cat flu is coming people the center for disease
[2:51:58.680 --> 2:52:03.080]  disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the house cat flu might spread
[2:52:03.080 --> 2:52:09.640]  in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern so better be aware that warm body on your left
[2:52:09.640 --> 2:52:23.320]  just might be ready to destroy your tender vitals well there you go instead of making it the cat
[2:52:23.320 --> 2:52:26.920]  though it's all of us we're dirty we've got to wear masks even though we're totally healthy
[2:52:26.920 --> 2:52:31.480]  it's it's it's the final revolution the post-human world already teaching our kids that humans are
[2:52:31.480 --> 2:52:38.200]  bad they ought to all commit suicide hobert barnes you hit the old nail on the head of the laser beam
[2:52:38.200 --> 2:52:42.520]  when you said we have to do nuremberg trials we have to do geneva convention we have to do
[2:52:42.520 --> 2:52:47.960]  nuremberg code violations and really because this is very aggressive to lie to pressure people to
[2:52:47.960 --> 2:52:51.720]  try to say it's mandatory and and to come and say we're going to give you all inoculations
[2:52:51.720 --> 2:52:56.760]  with something super dangerous but it's not even a vaccine so it's a mutinogenic drug to have this
[2:52:56.760 --> 2:53:01.880]  new mutinogenic revolution of gene therapy that people should be able to decide if they want it
[2:53:01.880 --> 2:53:08.440]  and what's crazy is they cover up this gene therapy with something really destructive which i almost
[2:53:08.440 --> 2:53:13.240]  think they want to discredit the field because some of it's so actually promising like antibodies
[2:53:13.240 --> 2:53:19.240]  that just 100 destroy things like colon cancer but they don't want us to have that i mean there's a
[2:53:19.240 --> 2:53:26.840]  bigger sick agenda here barns but no doubt about that whatsoever i mean and it's been in the works
[2:53:26.840 --> 2:53:31.080]  now for the better part of a century to the degree that the simpsons could preview it
[2:53:31.080 --> 2:53:37.000]  as we were just witnessing so that was 25 years ago they did that absolutely and really it was
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:40.920]  activities they were wanting to do the beginning of the last century that's when the jacob said
[2:53:40.920 --> 2:53:46.600]  decision came about that greenlit the idea of forced vaccines that introduced the idea of eugenics
[2:53:46.600 --> 2:53:52.120]  into the law that led to the buck decision that led to the kormatu decision and this is and it
[2:53:52.120 --> 2:53:57.960]  got suppressed because the nazis discredited this method of of governance this method of medical
[2:53:57.960 --> 2:54:03.800]  science this eugenics ideology but now it's brought back with the efforts of bill gates
[2:54:03.800 --> 2:54:08.600]  to infiltrate all the health organizations around the world the number two donor to the world health
[2:54:08.600 --> 2:54:13.800]  organization gives almost as much as the united states government does to the world health organization
[2:54:13.800 --> 2:54:18.040]  and we saw that influence pay off because he got all the politicians terrified of their local
[2:54:18.040 --> 2:54:22.120]  health boards and the local health boards were all terrified of whatever the who said and the
[2:54:22.120 --> 2:54:26.920]  who was just reading off of bill gates his script and his script is obsessed about controlling
[2:54:26.920 --> 2:54:31.720]  population and controlling people and now we witness what that looks like and it's very dangerous
[2:54:31.720 --> 2:54:36.600]  and precarious it's a reintroduction of nazi ideology just in a different guise it's a
[2:54:36.600 --> 2:54:40.680]  reintroduction of globalism and but under a different strategy of protecting you and how
[2:54:40.680 --> 2:54:46.120]  does alan dershowitz not see that uh because he sees that people that are doctors say it's good
[2:54:46.120 --> 2:54:50.920]  and so he assumes it's so it's a deference to medical science it's a deference i call it white
[2:54:50.920 --> 2:54:55.240]  coat disease it's a version of the milgram experiment because the milgram i mean i mean doctors
[2:54:55.240 --> 2:54:59.240]  chop off the wrong legs take out the wrong kidneys i mean it's got it's fraught with problems
[2:55:00.040 --> 2:55:04.600]  not only that if all the doctors and nurses so love this vaccine why are they objecting to it
[2:55:04.600 --> 2:55:11.080]  80% in the united states they know that this has all kinds of risk remember folks the last time we
[2:55:11.080 --> 2:55:16.840]  did have forced rush vaccine for any kind of flu virus 1976 look at what happened you can look at
[2:55:16.840 --> 2:55:21.320]  that was back when 60 minutes was honest look at what 60 minutes expose was about what happened
[2:55:21.320 --> 2:55:25.800]  with that rush bards you're knocking it out of the park let's talk off here i'm doing a special
[2:55:25.800 --> 2:55:29.720]  live show tomorrow if you can do it i'd like to have you on for a full hour about the vaccine to
[2:55:29.720 --> 2:55:34.600]  not a fight back but regardless yell big trees coming up stay with us i'm alex jones with info
[2:55:34.600 --> 2:55:39.880]  wards dot com be sure and find barns on twitter type of his name robert barns you can't miss it
[2:55:39.880 --> 2:55:48.920]  he'll be back inflation is here and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming especially
[2:55:48.920 --> 2:55:54.120]  of the globalist are successful in killing the dollar tens of millions of americans that were
[2:55:54.120 --> 2:56:00.280]  not awake are now beginning to store food that's a good thing but it's going to drive up prices
[2:56:00.280 --> 2:56:06.520]  and we're already beginning to see record sales once again we the people understand it's up to us
[2:56:06.520 --> 2:56:12.120]  to protect ourselves it's up to us to become self-sufficient the globalist are waging siege against
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:17.800]  us trying to destroy our businesses trying to bankrupt our families our towns our churches
[2:56:17.800 --> 2:56:23.960]  that's why while we still can you've got to get prepared and get ready take advantage of a huge
[2:56:23.960 --> 2:56:30.440]  final mega sale before prices go up and prepare with alex dot com and save up to eight hundred
[2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:36.200]  and fifty dollars off the highest quality storeable foods out there you've got until friday january
[2:56:36.200 --> 2:56:42.040]  eighth to get your orders in at prepare with alex dot com and lock in the lowest prices out there
[2:56:42.040 --> 2:56:56.920]  on high-quality storeable food we now take you live to the central texas command center
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:57:03.240]  in the heart of the resistance rallying patriots worldwide
[2:57:03.240 --> 2:57:10.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:57:14.760 --> 2:57:19.480]  all right this is incredible we've got del big tree in studio the host of the high wire and
[2:57:20.440 --> 2:57:27.880]  you know i'm like i'm kind of like i've explained it i'm like a shotgunner where a shotgun has a
[2:57:27.880 --> 2:57:34.040]  spread so i fire a shotgun i'm hitting like a two foot spread potentially uh del big tree is
[2:57:34.040 --> 2:57:39.400]  like a sniper when it comes to the vaccines and everything that's going on and so he has a document
[2:57:39.400 --> 2:57:43.400]  in front of him here and i said hey del what does that document have and he was just explaining this
[2:57:43.400 --> 2:57:48.760]  to me i mean it's just incredible and it thank god for del big tree thank god for other doctors and
[2:57:48.760 --> 2:57:54.040]  nurses that are out there investing in this raising awareness so again del big tree in studio with us
[2:57:54.040 --> 2:57:59.880]  the high wire is his show of course he's banned everywhere too the remarkable honor but so this
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:05.560]  is incredible to explain to me what this document is and why we should all be up in arms about this
[2:58:05.560 --> 2:58:10.520]  so there's multiple issues we knew over the last 20 years trying to make a corona virus vaccine
[2:58:10.520 --> 2:58:14.600]  we have failed right that's been an absolute disaster every single pharmaceutical company
[2:58:14.600 --> 2:58:19.560]  that's attempted it has run into the same issue it's called immune enhancement sometimes it's
[2:58:19.560 --> 2:58:24.360]  called antibody dependent enhancement or pathogenic climbing but however they talk about it here's
[2:58:24.360 --> 2:58:28.840]  what happens they gave the animals in all of the animal trials for the last 20 years they give the
[2:58:28.840 --> 2:58:33.160]  animal the vaccine it looks like it's safe the animals are doing just fine they test their blood
[2:58:33.160 --> 2:58:37.640]  they have plenty of antibodies looks like the vaccine's working then they go one step further
[2:58:37.640 --> 2:58:42.280]  which is a challenge trial where they actually inject the animal with corona virus and something
[2:58:42.280 --> 2:58:48.120]  diabolical happens instead of the antibodies protecting the animal it actually drew the virus
[2:58:48.120 --> 2:58:53.560]  in deeper faster proliferated faster and cause was called a cytokine storm this is a total
[2:58:53.560 --> 2:59:00.440]  immune system shutdown like overload hyperdrive organ failure what they call th2 immunopathology
[2:59:00.440 --> 2:59:04.920]  in the lungs where they cannot breathe killed animals now we have a history of this happening
[2:59:04.920 --> 2:59:10.360]  there was an rsv vaccine back in the 1960s for children it got 100 same thing it looked like
[2:59:10.360 --> 2:59:15.560]  the vaccine was safe until the kids came in contact with rsv then the vaccine worked like a catalyst
[2:59:15.560 --> 2:59:21.000]  to make the illness more deadly babies died we canceled it over a year ago same thing happened
[2:59:21.000 --> 2:59:26.600]  with deng vaccine the dengue vaccine the philippines we gave it to you know thousands of people
[2:59:26.600 --> 2:59:32.120]  then when they came in contact with dengue months later the vaccine actually made dengue deadly
[2:59:32.120 --> 2:59:38.040]  600 people died from what should have been a fever we discontinued that vaccine this is the
[2:59:38.040 --> 2:59:42.280]  problem that they've had with this vaccine so all the work i've been doing whether it's phyzer's
[2:59:42.280 --> 2:59:47.720]  vaccine or moderna's vaccine we've been looking at all their trials and saying their trials are not
[2:59:47.720 --> 2:59:53.160]  proving that they have overcome this diabolical problem which means next year after you've had
[2:59:53.160 --> 2:59:57.560]  the vaccine you could think you're doing fine all of a sudden you come in contact with coronavirus
[2:59:57.560 --> 3:00:02.280]  and you drop dead in the street because it made the coronavirus deadly which you and i wrote both
[3:00:02.280 --> 3:00:09.080]  no for 99.9% of us this isn't deadly this vaccine makes it could make it deadly now it's hypothetical
[3:00:09.080 --> 3:00:13.000]  but here's the point well let's reiterate though because because this is this is so important
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:19.560]  to focus on they have presented this information to the FDA this is the FDA document when they
[3:00:19.560 --> 3:00:24.120]  were getting approval for this emergency use authorization this is everything they admitted
[3:00:24.120 --> 3:00:30.600]  to the FDA they have an entire list of issues that they don't know if they've overcome that
[3:00:30.600 --> 3:00:35.960]  their list of unknowns right i always think of you know was it rumsfeld there's the known
[3:00:35.960 --> 3:00:41.000]  unknowns there's the unknown unknowns it's a bit like that there's what they don't know so in it is
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:46.360]  this giant list but this is the issue this is what i brought here on this show before and here it is
[3:00:46.360 --> 3:00:51.240]  in plain writing let me read this to you vaccine enhanced disease this is immune enhancement i'm
[3:00:51.240 --> 3:00:55.480]  talking about a deadly problem that you know they've been seeing in all the animal trials
[3:00:55.480 --> 3:01:01.160]  available data do not indicate a risk of vaccine enhanced disease and conversely suggest effectiveness
[3:01:01.160 --> 3:01:07.560]  against severe disease within the available follow-up period however risk of vaccine enhanced
[3:01:07.560 --> 3:01:13.480]  disease over time potentially associated with waning immunity remains unknown and needs to
[3:01:13.480 --> 3:01:19.160]  be evaluated further in ongoing clinical trials and in obverse observational studies that could
[3:01:19.160 --> 3:01:24.680]  be conducted following authorization and or license or remember they're asking right there we want to
[3:01:24.680 --> 3:01:29.160]  be licensed we want to get this emergency use but we are telling you that this vaccine may get
[3:01:29.160 --> 3:01:34.920]  people killed because we haven't overcome the issue where animals were dying in our trials
[3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:40.440]  that's terrifying so when you see fouchy on sesame street or talking about like to kids you
[3:01:40.440 --> 3:01:45.800]  should be getting this vaccine we are talking about an issue even let's just say it's one in a
[3:01:45.800 --> 3:01:49.800]  million what it's not we're talking about something that happened in almost every animal trial but
[3:01:49.800 --> 3:01:54.360]  even if it was one in a million problem or like the infertility we're seeing issues with real
[3:01:54.360 --> 3:02:00.360]  problems the infertility the antibodies if they attack this spike protein it looks so much like
[3:02:00.360 --> 3:02:06.200]  the outer layer of the placenta the syncytine that if it starts attacking placentas no one will be
[3:02:06.200 --> 3:02:12.440]  able to get pregnant these are legitimate theoretical issues and that's by design with the RNA they
[3:02:12.440 --> 3:02:18.600]  wanted it specifically after that spike protein so that it could latch on right so all of these
[3:02:18.600 --> 3:02:22.520]  things when you do trials this is why you do safety trials that when they say well we've
[3:02:22.520 --> 3:02:27.400]  accomplished in you know six months what usually takes eight years the eight years is overcoming
[3:02:27.400 --> 3:02:33.000]  crap like this is making sure that we see women get pregnant and that we see their children grow up
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:38.040]  and then you see their children get pregnant in the future do you realize we have seen drugs that
[3:02:38.040 --> 3:02:42.520]  take away your ability to be fertile only because your mother got it while she was pregnant you
[3:02:42.520 --> 3:02:47.960]  finally get to childbearing age and you can't give birth this is the type of issues that we
[3:02:47.960 --> 3:02:53.160]  need to see that we've overcome before all of us start being forced to get this vaccine it could
[3:02:53.160 --> 3:02:58.360]  be literally the end of our species if we get this wrong and by the way i'm just a linear
[3:02:58.360 --> 3:03:03.960]  logical thinker here so okay you've got this vaccine that they they admit they don't even know
[3:03:03.960 --> 3:03:09.320]  it could cause a cytokine storm right well now imagine you have just i mean god forbid let's hope
[3:03:09.320 --> 3:03:14.360]  this doesn't happen but you've just injected all these nurses and doctors with the vaccine
[3:03:14.360 --> 3:03:18.520]  some of them are going to get covid whether that happened to the guy that got the vaccine and then
[3:03:18.520 --> 3:03:22.120]  tested positive for covid eight days later whether that's his story or not could be a
[3:03:22.120 --> 3:03:25.960]  false positive we really don't know the point is you've now created this situation where
[3:03:25.960 --> 3:03:30.120]  you could have these nurses and doctors having cytokine storms you could have bell palsy with
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:33.800]  the i mean we're already seeing that and they've set themselves up and they admit they don't even
[3:03:33.800 --> 3:03:37.400]  know they don't even know if this can be happening and i'm so glad you brought the pregnancy issue
[3:03:37.400 --> 3:03:42.840]  up because this story was in the usa today pregnant fact check pregnant women do not receive
[3:03:42.840 --> 3:03:48.920]  vaccines but more study needed on covid 19 shot now if you read this it's like the most upside
[3:03:48.920 --> 3:03:53.080]  down world thing half the time they're saying pregnant women shouldn't get it because of all
[3:03:53.080 --> 3:03:56.600]  the side effects and then the other half they're saying but it's okay pregnant women can get it
[3:03:56.600 --> 3:04:02.200]  if they want to but they admit and they even get quotes from health officials and the vaccine
[3:04:02.200 --> 3:04:08.040]  manufacturers they even admit that they tell you if you get a covid vaccine they tell you no sexual
[3:04:08.040 --> 3:04:13.000]  activity for two weeks no activity that could lead to pregnancy for two weeks so they know there's a
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:18.280]  risk there they already know there's a risk there and they obviously haven't done the trials when
[3:04:18.280 --> 3:04:22.920]  they are telling you okay we don't know the risk so for two weeks after you get the vaccine no
[3:04:22.920 --> 3:04:27.320]  sexual activity that could lead to a pregnancy so how are we supposed to even know you mean
[3:04:27.320 --> 3:04:32.200]  it's like you said we could be injecting these things and then a month two months a year four
[3:04:32.200 --> 3:04:37.240]  years later realize right wait a second these vaccines just cause women to be fertile right
[3:04:37.240 --> 3:04:43.240]  or infertile that's exactly the issue here look i'm not i'm not anti-vaccine i'm trying to keep
[3:04:43.240 --> 3:04:47.640]  anyone from getting a vaccine if you want to take part in a trial go right ahead this is a free
[3:04:47.640 --> 3:04:51.560]  country and by the way i'll say thank you for your service you might as well be flying to the
[3:04:51.560 --> 3:04:57.400]  mars for the first time because it's that dangerous we do not know this is not oh and this is not like
[3:04:57.400 --> 3:05:02.840]  any vaccine they've ever made before we have no reference point to previous vaccines as well
[3:05:02.840 --> 3:05:08.200]  we saw a history of this with these vaccines this is a brand new technology that is turning our
[3:05:08.200 --> 3:05:15.080]  bodies into manufacturing plants of the virus not of the antibodies what that RNA message is doing
[3:05:15.080 --> 3:05:21.480]  is it's going to ourselves and saying create the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus we've never
[3:05:21.480 --> 3:05:27.000]  done this we're basically reverse engineering how our immune system works now hey maybe this is the
[3:05:27.000 --> 3:05:32.440]  future maybe this is like you know going to mars but you don't put that out in six months on your
[3:05:32.440 --> 3:05:37.240]  first attempt in humanity and say hey we're just pretty sure it's all going to work out for us and
[3:05:37.240 --> 3:05:41.880]  you know i'm curious too i mean this is just uh from from somebody that likes personal fitness
[3:05:41.880 --> 3:05:46.040]  and health and i don't know if the vaccine works the same way but it's kind of like you would develop
[3:05:47.160 --> 3:05:51.480]  a tolerance to it and so they could it could become a thing where your body stops naturally
[3:05:51.480 --> 3:05:56.600]  producing that 23rd spike protein and it's reliant on the vaccine so then you have you
[3:05:56.600 --> 3:06:00.920]  literally have to get the vaccine to produce the protein i mean you could potentially see a situation
[3:06:00.920 --> 3:06:06.200]  like that you could see so many different every one of unknown they say that's what
[3:06:06.200 --> 3:06:10.840]  unknown is all about right this is this is science this is why it's great this is supposed to be
[3:06:10.840 --> 3:06:15.560]  happening in land lab animals for the next 40 years and maybe into some people that really
[3:06:15.560 --> 3:06:20.200]  want to take the risk and jump out there you don't put this in your entire population by the way
[3:06:20.200 --> 3:06:24.680]  that two weeks of not getting pregnant that's just for women there's a study right now going on the
[3:06:24.680 --> 3:06:31.000]  university of miami on the sperm in men that are in this there there is the possibility that this is
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:35.240]  going to call and you are tuned in the first live show of the new year i'm alex jones see the full
[3:06:35.240 --> 3:06:39.800]  interview ellen did with dill big tree at band dot video and share it coming up the one the only
[3:06:39.800 --> 3:06:46.040]  doctor nick baggots stay with us our activated charcoal toothpaste became a best seller overnight
[3:06:46.040 --> 3:06:50.760]  because activated charcoal is already one of the top selling fastest growing toothpaste out there
[3:06:50.760 --> 3:06:55.400]  the problem is a lot of the other over the counter ones have aspartame as they're flavoring very
[3:06:55.400 --> 3:06:59.800]  very toxic and also they have fluoride in it this does not have the fluoride it doesn't have the
[3:06:59.800 --> 3:07:04.840]  additives this is a concentrated really is high quality it's been sold out for months because
[3:07:04.840 --> 3:07:10.200]  the supply chain breakdowns with the whole covid martial law garbage but now it's back in stock
[3:07:10.200 --> 3:07:17.560]  info wars dr jones naturals activated charcoal toothpaste now back in stock at info wars store
[3:07:17.560 --> 3:07:22.760]  dot com or call toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine also makes a great gift
[3:07:22.760 --> 3:07:27.720]  for your family for your grandkids uh for your mother your father for everybody and it supports

[3:07:33.480 --> 3:07:37.880]  dot com a lot of other products that have been sold out have just now come back in as well
[3:07:37.880 --> 3:07:44.520]  like pollen block so check that out when you're in the store hey alex how you doing man is this
[3:07:44.520 --> 3:07:49.720]  the guy that called in about living defense yes sir yes sir i've been trying to get a hold of you
[3:07:49.720 --> 3:07:56.040]  since monday when i heard you got that fresh shipment of living defense in from utah i said
[3:07:56.040 --> 3:08:01.480]  man i gotta get on that show and give him an update i said if i ever get a chance to be on
[3:08:01.480 --> 3:08:07.640]  alex jones show i'm gonna tell the world about living defense and what it did for me personally
[3:08:07.640 --> 3:08:14.360]  now look i'm 64 years old going on 20 thanks to this info wars store products and by the way
[3:08:14.360 --> 3:08:20.520]  i bought 800 dollars worth the other night so i'm doing what i can problem so what my my
[3:08:20.520 --> 3:08:26.120]  contention is why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting couple bottles
[3:08:26.120 --> 3:08:32.200]  of living defense now you gotta follow that up with the micro vx i learned that so it's like god
[3:08:32.200 --> 3:08:38.120]  working is so amazing we didn't know we didn't screen your call we had no idea and i go to you
[3:08:38.120 --> 3:08:45.320]  a year later you heard telling me about living defense living defense living defense you're
[3:08:45.320 --> 3:09:08.680]  listening to the alex jones show you're listening to the alex jones show with nick baggage
[3:09:08.680 --> 3:09:25.160]  well boy that's hard to follow uh man uh that's a powerful powerful uh last couple hours i gotta
[3:09:25.160 --> 3:09:33.160]  say um and as usual when i'm on i kind of change the tone a bit uh and i plan to do that today
[3:09:33.160 --> 3:09:39.800]  you know i was thinking about this as i went on um this concept life liberty in the pursuit of
[3:09:39.800 --> 3:09:50.680]  happiness happy new year everyone do you feel it you know and and i mean that sincerely all right
[3:09:50.680 --> 3:09:57.800]  okay i think about this for just one moment um should we feel that i think so you know why
[3:09:57.800 --> 3:10:02.760]  do i feel people always ask you're always smiling you're always happy even the mist of
[3:10:02.760 --> 3:10:10.680]  like the sky is falling right i mean in the middle of an earthquake uh if you will and and i'll tell
[3:10:10.680 --> 3:10:15.320]  you why i'll tell you sincerely why because i know how the story ends and i'm really not so worried
[3:10:15.320 --> 3:10:23.800]  about it um and i want to talk about a lot of that today because here we are uh launching into 2021
[3:10:23.800 --> 3:10:29.480]  and uh we're doing it together uh with information okay that's what we've been getting
[3:10:29.480 --> 3:10:37.400]  um all week all year uh now we're going to get it all this year and on the platform of all that
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:45.640]  information comes thinking and feeling uh the mind and heart if you will uh and then the universal
[3:10:45.640 --> 3:10:51.160]  if you want to plug that in and i think we should because that's where the power is and so i'm talking
[3:10:51.160 --> 3:10:59.640]  about uh probably more about that these days you know i sent out um something to all of my uh
[3:10:59.640 --> 3:11:04.120]  closest friends and i want to share with you guys because you're uh part of that mix and it's just a
[3:11:04.120 --> 3:11:10.360]  little short thing i'll just read one paragraph of it uh and it was my kind of launch for the new
[3:11:10.360 --> 3:11:15.000]  year and it's about friendship it's going to be my theme of a lot of what i'm talking about today
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:21.880]  uh friendship is a garden that requires cultivation it is in fact the highest form of love
[3:11:22.600 --> 3:11:30.600]  of realization love is how the universe characterizes itself not a human love of tradeoffs
[3:11:30.600 --> 3:11:39.960]  and expectations but rather in an unconditional form of love wow think about that for just a moment
[3:11:40.520 --> 3:11:43.640]  that's what i part of what i sent out anyway i won't read you the rest but
[3:11:43.640 --> 3:11:52.760]  the the point is how does god you know define itself in one form it's god is love you know
[3:11:52.760 --> 3:11:59.400]  that's pretty powerful if you stop and think about it you know and here's part of this thing i've
[3:11:59.400 --> 3:12:03.800]  been talking about for weeks actually kind of embedded in a lot of the different presentations
[3:12:03.800 --> 3:12:12.280]  this idea that you know how we interpret the thing and then choose to act decides a lot about
[3:12:12.280 --> 3:12:19.800]  about sort of what's happening with it and and and that's the free choice uh deal and and when i go
[3:12:19.800 --> 3:12:26.840]  into the programs one of the things i think about is i think i know what i'm going to say and usually
[3:12:26.840 --> 3:12:33.160]  it's not exactly what i had in mind but i really pray really hard to not say the wrong thing because
[3:12:33.160 --> 3:12:37.880]  i'm responsible for that see if i say the wrong thing and i motivate people in the wrong direction
[3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:45.480]  and i'm responsible for that so i don't want to do that i'd rather be struck silent you know i mean
[3:12:45.480 --> 3:12:52.600]  it struck dead than make the mistake so i try to inform from the head and the heart and ask god
[3:12:52.600 --> 3:12:57.240]  to clear the deck but i don't screw it up and i think that's what all of us are trying to do
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:03.080]  at before our event you know when i come on the air but that's what all of us should be doing
[3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:12.840]  before our individual events whatever that is going to work waking up in the morning you know
[3:13:12.840 --> 3:13:20.200]  have your prayer your conversation with god who is not always recognized in the maybe i think
[3:13:20.200 --> 3:13:27.640]  the right way but but think of god as your friend you know and have that conversation you know and
[3:13:27.640 --> 3:13:33.240]  don't think you got to use a bunch of special words and forget about your normal vocabulary that
[3:13:33.240 --> 3:13:39.160]  you're thinking in your head that you might want want want to speak out in church but let me tell
[3:13:39.160 --> 3:13:45.240]  you something about all that is if it's in your head god already figured it out yeah you're flawed
[3:13:45.240 --> 3:13:54.600]  just like me and everyone else and uh but here's the thing are you available to get anything done
[3:13:54.600 --> 3:14:01.320]  flawed or not you know and that's a deeper question and one we usually shrink from right
[3:14:01.320 --> 3:14:08.200]  because we see all of our flaws the only one that sees them clearer than us is god you know you can
[3:14:08.200 --> 3:14:13.720]  hide it from your spouse your family your friends all of this you can hide every aspect except from
[3:14:13.720 --> 3:14:21.480]  yourself and you can run away from yourself a lot of people do or they condemn themselves so harshly
[3:14:21.480 --> 3:14:32.760]  into immobility they just freeze up don't freeze up don't freeze up in fear unfortunately i want
[3:14:32.760 --> 3:14:40.360]  to contrast a little bit of that today trauma driven by fear will definitely create a bunch
[3:14:40.360 --> 3:14:49.560]  of actions and reactions in the form of the flesh think about that for a moment powerful motivators
[3:14:49.560 --> 3:14:56.440]  trauma think about your own i've spoken about mine in the past i i i look at them in a different
[3:14:56.440 --> 3:15:05.240]  way today though you see there's a different way to see that you can get sucked into the victimization
[3:15:05.240 --> 3:15:15.080]  of it whatever it was or whatever it is or and i say this meaning it sincerely you can in fact
[3:15:15.080 --> 3:15:22.040]  overcome it by recognition of what you aren't and what you are and we identify too much with our
[3:15:22.040 --> 3:15:26.680]  thinking and our feeling and people ask you know people will ask you you'll know right away where
[3:15:26.680 --> 3:15:33.080]  they're at they'll say how do you feel or other people will say what do you think and you know
[3:15:33.080 --> 3:15:38.840]  whether they're in their head or in their art not many people ask you how do you think and how
[3:15:38.840 --> 3:15:44.600]  do you feel about you know but but that's okay too because we're usually only running half of the
[3:15:44.600 --> 3:15:50.200]  programming our own programming even so how are we going to interpret the rest of the world's
[3:15:50.200 --> 3:15:55.560]  programming or should we maybe we should interpret our own a little differently first integrate a
[3:15:55.560 --> 3:16:01.480]  little bit better first and then our filter changes and how we see our suffering and maybe
[3:16:01.480 --> 3:16:08.040]  we don't see suffering anymore maybe we can walk through what others say oh how horrible how terrible
[3:16:08.040 --> 3:16:14.280]  and we say no no no it's alright because we know how it ends but we know what we're doing
[3:16:14.280 --> 3:16:18.680]  in it we're not abandoned in this we're not walking through the valley of the shadow of death
[3:16:18.680 --> 3:16:27.560]  unaccompanied we're there in the middle of it together doing this thing uh doing this dance
[3:16:27.560 --> 3:16:32.600]  on january 6 there's going to be a big dance in washington dc a bunch of people are going to be
[3:16:32.600 --> 3:16:41.160]  there go to the dance participate in the world that's around you if you can if you can if you
[3:16:41.160 --> 3:16:49.000]  can't hey do your thing where you are but do something that carries your heart what you
[3:16:49.000 --> 3:16:54.760]  believe to be right and true with your head what you know to be right and true and ask for a higher
[3:16:54.760 --> 3:16:59.560]  knowledge that can be funneled through you you know alex was talking in the couple hours ago
[3:16:59.560 --> 3:17:06.440]  about the church how many churches missed the mark hey if you listen carefully a couple thousand
[3:17:06.440 --> 3:17:12.440]  years ago you heard a different version of the church as people were kicking in temple doors
[3:17:12.440 --> 3:17:22.120]  or one in particular and what was it you are the church your body is that temple think about that
[3:17:22.120 --> 3:17:30.040]  as you wake up into the 21st century into 2021 into the new year because we're going to have a
[3:17:30.040 --> 3:17:35.960]  happy new year do we find our power in it and we express it in the world around us and change it
[3:17:35.960 --> 3:17:43.800]  this is dr. nick we'll be right back it's not a secret why and leftist controlled cities all over
[3:17:43.800 --> 3:17:49.160]  the world not just the us they encourage people to live in tents cities is homeless and to use drugs
[3:17:49.160 --> 3:17:55.160]  and alcohol and engage in petty crime it's because the globalists admit under agenda 21 agenda 2030
[3:17:55.160 --> 3:18:00.360]  of course the gray reset they want to lower expectations they don't need to think of having
[3:18:00.360 --> 3:18:04.200]  sanitary systems everywhere they don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better
[3:18:04.200 --> 3:18:08.840]  they want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse the globalists fly around
[3:18:08.840 --> 3:18:14.280]  in private jets they have huge private mistakes they are separate from us their children go to
[3:18:14.280 --> 3:18:20.120]  private tutors they admit this now they want us to lock down telecommunicating with each other
[3:18:20.120 --> 3:18:25.400]  so that we are not actually out physically building a pro-human infrastructure the infrastructure
[3:18:25.400 --> 3:18:30.920]  that's left under 5g has been a controlled robot autonomous cars and trucks this is all
[3:18:30.920 --> 3:18:35.480]  their admitted plan the public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta
[3:18:35.480 --> 3:18:41.240]  it's gone operational it's a post human future you better find out about it right now the post
[3:18:41.240 --> 3:18:48.360]  industrial world that's what george herbert walker bush signed on to it the Rio de Janeiro
[3:18:48.360 --> 3:18:56.440]  agenda 21 conference back in 1992 now they've launched agenda 2030 which is a post industrial
[3:18:56.440 --> 3:19:00.920]  world plow schwa with the debos group trudeau the prime minister of Canada they're all on record
[3:19:00.920 --> 3:19:08.680]  saying the great reset is agenda 2030 well you might want to find out what agenda 2030 is it
[3:19:08.680 --> 3:19:14.680]  is the destruction of society as we know it it is making the population poor by designs we can be
[3:19:14.680 --> 3:19:21.560]  controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family they're destroying civilization
[3:19:21.560 --> 3:19:28.440]  rebuilding and they're dystopic image we are fighting this at info wars dot com and news wars
[3:19:28.440 --> 3:19:34.280]  dot com we are fighting for a pro-human future and we need you to get the facts to research and
[3:19:34.280 --> 3:19:54.920]  share with others and join the fight god bless you visit us spread the word and info wars dot com
[3:19:54.920 --> 3:20:02.680]  info wars dot com news wars dot com band dot video and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have
[3:20:02.680 --> 3:20:11.800]  been banned that's why every month we launch a new url before they ban it the sorrows and bill gates
[3:20:11.800 --> 3:20:19.400]  and the globalists are on our tail but the new website is the resistance dot video the resistance
[3:20:19.400 --> 3:20:25.480]  dot video they're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them so the new
[3:20:25.480 --> 3:20:30.600]  url that links right to band dot video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all
[3:20:30.600 --> 3:20:35.880]  the special reports and all the suppressed information is that the resistance dot video share
[3:20:35.880 --> 3:20:46.040]  the link the resistance dot video the resistance dot video you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:46.040 --> 3:21:06.680]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host nick baggage
[3:21:06.680 --> 3:21:19.400]  so good to be back uh again on uh on this friday afternoon in most of the world and just before
[3:21:19.400 --> 3:21:27.320]  noon here in anchor gelaska you know uh just thinking about um all of the just total insanity
[3:21:27.320 --> 3:21:32.600]  really in the world i mean nothing is functioning as it should correct i mean we all know that we
[3:21:32.600 --> 3:21:37.720]  all see that a lot of us predicted the model would happen and also predict the same time
[3:21:38.360 --> 3:21:44.520]  that uh there would be this transformation why do i why do i know that because within the birth
[3:21:44.520 --> 3:21:50.520]  pains of living experience is something beautiful on the other end but unfortunately in the earth we
[3:21:50.520 --> 3:21:58.440]  keep choosing this trauma trajectory you know and that's kind of the old model that's uh starting
[3:21:58.440 --> 3:22:04.840]  to get a little bit dismantled because uh people are speaking a little different messages now you
[3:22:04.840 --> 3:22:10.280]  know and not talking about the powerlessness of how we are the dust and dirt that we are at the
[3:22:10.280 --> 3:22:16.440]  feet of a god that doesn't care and isn't our friend that isn't how it is it's the other way
[3:22:17.400 --> 3:22:21.640]  it's the opposite way you know we're more than that we're creating the image and likeness of a
[3:22:21.640 --> 3:22:28.600]  creator who stands in friendship with us in a conversation with each of us if we'll have it
[3:22:28.600 --> 3:22:34.120]  and it doesn't come back in some well maybe for some it does in an audible format it comes in all
[3:22:34.120 --> 3:22:39.480]  different ways and and i've been in my deeper conversation recently and a couple things that
[3:22:39.480 --> 3:22:47.800]  i realized about myself uh that that i still have to overcome you know what one of them is
[3:22:47.800 --> 3:22:53.560]  is still a level of of self doubt i mentioned it just before the break this idea that i pray before
[3:22:53.560 --> 3:22:57.800]  i go on i don't want to screw up i don't want to say the wrong thing this is called self doubt see
[3:22:58.680 --> 3:23:03.640]  and i have some of that so i you know i go well i can't overcome that one and i really don't want
[3:23:03.640 --> 3:23:11.240]  to mess it up so that's the conversation i have with my friend who i hope will guide my words
[3:23:11.240 --> 3:23:18.920]  you know and uh does i i believe that and so uh this is the thing we all can have that conversation
[3:23:18.920 --> 3:23:25.560]  in the other day as i'm walking because i walk in the dark cold night of alaska uh a couple times
[3:23:25.560 --> 3:23:31.560]  a day and and i'm in this conversation and i realize and i hear it i hear it in my heart
[3:23:31.560 --> 3:23:38.440]  actually and it says nicholas don't don't worry i'll work with his flawed his yard just be available
[3:23:38.440 --> 3:23:44.520]  wow that was a profound message that i'm passing on to all of you right now because it's for all
[3:23:44.520 --> 3:23:50.200]  of you not just for me we need to remember that as flawed as we are and we see it better than
[3:23:50.200 --> 3:23:56.360]  anyone else except god so we hide it from everyone else to some degree and that's okay i understand
[3:23:56.360 --> 3:24:02.280]  but someday the veil will be removed and we'll see each other for who we are and then that's the
[3:24:02.280 --> 3:24:07.000]  gnashing of teeth you know the grinding you know but it doesn't have to be that way because we can
[3:24:07.000 --> 3:24:12.040]  because we can accept flaws in each other that's acceptance what i've been talking about for weeks
[3:24:12.600 --> 3:24:18.440]  not tolerance this lefty notion of shutting up what you believe to be right and true and just
[3:24:19.080 --> 3:24:24.360]  you know denying your truth by not speaking it and then eventually speaking some lie that you
[3:24:24.360 --> 3:24:31.560]  think you want the public wants you to hear don't do that don't do that don't start giving up what
[3:24:31.560 --> 3:24:36.680]  you believe to be right and true you should find a way to intellectually and emotionally you know
[3:24:36.680 --> 3:24:43.560]  rationalize it for sure and everyone does if you're a woman living in saudi arabia wearing a black
[3:24:43.560 --> 3:24:47.480]  bag i'm sure you got a good rationale for it you feel good about yourself might be happy
[3:24:48.760 --> 3:24:54.040]  and if you're a woman in france walking on the beach without a top on you might be happy
[3:24:54.040 --> 3:24:58.840]  and think that's perfectly fine and you might not feel that way in the midwest in iowa on either
[3:24:58.840 --> 3:25:09.560]  situation but the fact is much of what we believe and feel might want to think about that are they
[3:25:09.560 --> 3:25:17.240]  that important are they that meaningful what do they really represent start going deeper inside
[3:25:17.240 --> 3:25:21.560]  and say why do i believe what i believe and is have any power enters take power from me
[3:25:22.760 --> 3:25:27.480]  you know start asking ourselves the deep questions so we can find our individual power
[3:25:27.480 --> 3:25:36.920]  and begin to project it like a funnel of energy facing the other way you know taking who you are
[3:25:36.920 --> 3:25:45.720]  and making it like a laser of decision a laser of decision you know each thing you decide creates
[3:25:45.720 --> 3:25:51.400]  the chain reaction that you live throw the pebble in the pond you see it go in and you forget about
[3:25:51.400 --> 3:25:57.640]  all the waves go on from it well that's you in action that's all of us in action together doing
[3:25:57.640 --> 3:26:06.440]  our thing it's a beautifully orchestrated dance if you'll just participate in it on some level
[3:26:07.640 --> 3:26:14.200]  and and then you actually are united with the millions maybe billions of other human souls
[3:26:15.000 --> 3:26:20.840]  trying to do the same thing and then we change the world because we change how we relate to the
[3:26:20.840 --> 3:26:26.840]  world so suffering ends for us when we don't see the suffering that comes at us in the same way
[3:26:28.120 --> 3:26:33.080]  and you stand in the middle of the storm what i've also talked about where it whirls around you
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:38.680]  you see it all you're even in it a little bit you know you kind of moved in and out because
[3:26:38.680 --> 3:26:45.160]  we're all me human but but if you can kind of stay there and know you're not alone as you're
[3:26:45.160 --> 3:26:51.000]  walking through it you get through it in a much better way and actually you don't just get through
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:57.000]  it you get to participate in the creation of it in a more powerful way you'll do it anyway you
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:27:01.800]  can do it robotically on your hamster wheel we all have hamster wheels i've seen giant ones in my
[3:27:01.800 --> 3:27:06.840]  life you know these guys who are really high places as we think and people who are in smaller
[3:27:06.840 --> 3:27:12.680]  places but it's just another hamster wheel and and no matter how big it is in the earth when god
[3:27:12.680 --> 3:27:18.680]  sees it from his perspective it's us the little bitty hamster wheel and most of us run around on
[3:27:18.680 --> 3:27:23.800]  those and we engage what i call the window dressing of life the issues that are important to us which
[3:27:23.800 --> 3:27:29.880]  is important it's i'm not diminishing any of that but i'm saying do it on a platform of values and
[3:27:29.880 --> 3:27:35.480]  belief that's anchored in knowledge and truth and maybe funneled to the pursuit of life liberty and
[3:27:35.480 --> 3:27:41.480]  the pursuit of happiness in the happy new year that we're supposed to be having and don't let
[3:27:41.480 --> 3:27:50.920]  globalists or people in the religious industry or others strip you of who you are and what you are
[3:27:50.920 --> 3:27:55.160]  and diminish you in some way or create some intermediary between you and the universal
[3:27:55.160 --> 3:28:02.360]  there isn't one you're in it that's the big message all right for the beginning of the new year we're
[3:28:02.360 --> 3:28:09.000]  all in this thing not to hide out in our homes in a hobble no that's wrong that's a false message
[3:28:09.000 --> 3:28:17.080]  a false narrative we're meant as human beings to be with each other to embrace each other to see
[3:28:17.080 --> 3:28:25.480]  each other's expressions to hear the vibration in each other's voices in person not just through
[3:28:25.480 --> 3:28:32.680]  the air waves or the internet there's something about being with someone in the way the energy
[3:28:32.680 --> 3:28:43.720]  exchanges with each of us that's so fundamental to what we are it's who we are the energy we feel
[3:28:44.600 --> 3:28:51.640]  is what we are and the shell that feels it carries it around in the earth and they're
[3:28:51.640 --> 3:28:59.880]  trying to shut that piece down and we need to wake that piece up and so in the middle of the storm
[3:28:59.880 --> 3:29:08.360]  we need to learn how to be that to feel that and the gratitude of it i am grateful every day
[3:29:08.360 --> 3:29:13.080]  that i get to do what i do in this life to breathe this breath of life with you
[3:29:13.800 --> 3:29:19.720]  you know when i think about what we're doing and when we get it together like we do what happens
[3:29:19.720 --> 3:29:29.880]  you see and no matter how it looks no matter how it appears you have to see a greater order in it
[3:29:30.680 --> 3:29:38.360]  and and have not you know this faith thing it's so difficult you know because it's not like
[3:29:39.240 --> 3:29:44.120]  oh it's this magical thing you just have to believe it and you and you don't well that
[3:29:44.120 --> 3:29:49.640]  doesn't work right you got to know what you know to believe what you believe and so that's the
[3:29:49.640 --> 3:29:54.920]  foundation of faith from my perspective is doing what you know is right and true carrying your life
[3:29:54.920 --> 3:30:00.120]  message through the configuration of your spheres of influence your family your friends the people
[3:30:00.120 --> 3:30:06.680]  that matter to you and try and overcome yourself in the course of this but not limit yourself
[3:30:06.680 --> 3:30:13.080]  by holding back what you can do as flawed as each and every one of us are that's the big one for
[3:30:13.080 --> 3:30:18.360]  the new year do what you can think about your cravings in life and i'll talk a little bit
[3:30:18.360 --> 3:30:22.520]  about that after the break because your cravings are also a signal of something that might be
[3:30:23.160 --> 3:30:28.920]  in the flesh that you might want to pay attention to is it drugs is it sex is it alcohol what's
[3:30:28.920 --> 3:30:35.400]  your craving that you can't control sugar maybe uh you know these are important questions they all
[3:30:35.400 --> 3:30:41.240]  result in the same answers this is dr. nick begatry right back cognitive dissonance is a major
[3:30:41.240 --> 3:30:47.480]  issue amongst the left it can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you
[3:30:47.480 --> 3:30:53.240]  have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition buy them a bottle of ultimate
[3:30:53.240 --> 3:30:59.160]  fish oil from info wars store dot com studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil
[3:30:59.160 --> 3:31:05.480]  supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure decrease triglyceride levels decrease the growth
[3:31:05.480 --> 3:31:11.320]  rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses and joints and the
[3:31:11.320 --> 3:31:18.760]  digestive system recent studies have suggested that high epa and dha fish oil can stimulate
[3:31:18.760 --> 3:31:25.880]  immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells it worked for my family
[3:31:25.880 --> 3:31:32.920]  and now i can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality get

[3:32:02.920 --> 3:32:07.160]  doctors say it's worse than they ever thought covid more devastating than they would ever imagine
[3:32:07.880 --> 3:32:13.320]  they told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three
[3:32:13.320 --> 3:32:19.800]  months okay it's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things we're
[3:32:19.800 --> 3:32:25.320]  talking 96 had comorbidity these are real numbers these are real facts this is the chicken little
[3:32:25.320 --> 3:32:30.280]  event we all run our houses never come out and are taught we're not essential all the big box stores
[3:32:30.280 --> 3:32:36.680]  in amazon take over the planet rebuke it stand up against it this is slavery it is not something
[3:32:36.680 --> 3:32:44.040]  you can put up with and survive the great reset is here world government has openly been announced
[3:32:44.040 --> 3:32:49.240]  and its plan is to bankrupt you and your family and to make you so poor you're forced onto a
[3:32:49.240 --> 3:32:54.440]  universal guaranteed income worse inoculations and you must pledge allegiance to the leftist
[3:32:54.440 --> 3:32:59.560]  globalist system that's why it's important to pray to god be politically active and get
[3:32:59.560 --> 3:33:05.320]  prepared for self-defense and to be able to store food and other emergency products that you

[3:34:45.480 --> 3:35:08.280]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind with nick baggage
[3:35:08.280 --> 3:35:19.000]  you know it's it's you know going into the new year you know you got a hundred hours worth of
[3:35:19.000 --> 3:35:25.960]  things to say and you have less than an hour to say it in it is the way it is you know in fact
[3:35:25.960 --> 3:35:33.320]  one of my new year's resolutions is to configure a team maybe here and i encourage that'll work
[3:35:33.320 --> 3:35:39.480]  me to get that hundred hours out um and get it into the uh band dot video format where people
[3:35:39.480 --> 3:35:44.440]  can see it because there's a lot to be said about what's going on in the world and there's never
[3:35:44.440 --> 3:35:51.160]  enough time i know it frustrates every single host on here because we're bombarded with information
[3:35:51.160 --> 3:35:56.760]  from every angle and so we got to pick the angle you know the facet on the gem if you will you
[3:35:56.760 --> 3:36:01.480]  think about all the scintillating light coming off of the gemstone that's what you've got in
[3:36:01.480 --> 3:36:09.080]  the info war you've got a a lot of lights on the same rock you know and hitting it from a lot of
[3:36:09.080 --> 3:36:15.880]  angles and what's it about it's about you the info warrior you know and doing something
[3:36:16.440 --> 3:36:22.440]  that is extraordinary engaging ourselves again well the rest of the media the mainstream the
[3:36:22.440 --> 3:36:27.720]  lame stream media tries to put the world asleep with their programming which i've talked a lot
[3:36:27.720 --> 3:36:33.080]  about you want to know what i i think about all that i've done the science on that uh for the last
[3:36:33.080 --> 3:36:39.720]  25 years on controlling the mind and what and what the media does with that it's powerful it's uh
[3:36:39.720 --> 3:36:46.440]  like to be ignored ladies gentlemen if you can and dig deep into your own knowledge and start
[3:36:46.440 --> 3:36:53.160]  being more discerning in what you're being pipelined and make sure the pipeline is one that you
[3:36:53.160 --> 3:37:00.920]  know moderate and control the throttle on the pipeline of your info war the one in your mind
[3:37:00.920 --> 3:37:09.080]  the one for your mind for your mind that's the mid place you see a motion in mind the mid place
[3:37:09.080 --> 3:37:14.120]  can't touch them you know in the real sense thoughts ideas you know motions how do you grab those
[3:37:14.840 --> 3:37:22.120]  but they affect everything in the physical and reflected upwards everything in the spiritual
[3:37:22.120 --> 3:37:31.240]  so it's the bridge the info war is the bridge you see between the physical world and a different
[3:37:31.240 --> 3:37:40.440]  world of seeing so here's the challenge for 2021 let's bring heaven and earth into focus a little
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:47.800]  better through the vessels that we are in the physical form within the earth combining the
[3:37:47.800 --> 3:37:56.280]  left and the right brain you know the analytical and the creative the male and the female if you
[3:37:56.280 --> 3:38:03.000]  will if you want to use that analogy is the brain you think about it most most not all and i don't
[3:38:03.000 --> 3:38:08.280]  want to be a sexist here but i'm going to say the truth of the matter is most women come at us and
[3:38:08.280 --> 3:38:16.680]  say how do you feel most men come at us and say what do you think it's the way we're wired up
[3:38:16.680 --> 3:38:23.240]  you know but getting that wiring a little reorganized so men can think and feel and women can do in a
[3:38:23.240 --> 3:38:30.520]  more holistic way a more full way a more complete way as we were meant to be uh in terms of using
[3:38:30.520 --> 3:38:40.120]  our brain but once that comes into focus in focus now you can tune in to something deeper
[3:38:40.120 --> 3:38:47.880]  and universal so you have to first you know kind of overcome yourself a bit uh then you have to
[3:38:48.440 --> 3:38:53.400]  find forgiveness in that there's lots of ways you can kind of think about that but there's
[3:38:53.400 --> 3:39:00.440]  only a route to the finish line so find yours find your path to forgiveness and then your power
[3:39:01.080 --> 3:39:09.400]  will start to come back as a created human being and you can overcome your flaws your cravings
[3:39:09.400 --> 3:39:14.200]  you know because think about those cravings if it's sex it's the chemical reaction that occurs
[3:39:14.200 --> 3:39:18.840]  and actually hangs around for about four days if you want to clear up your thinking you know you
[3:39:18.840 --> 3:39:23.080]  might wait four days and then decide if that's really a good relationship or not if you've made
[3:39:23.080 --> 3:39:29.880]  that decision uh the other one is you know drugs and alcohol you know this is easy it's seductive
[3:39:29.880 --> 3:39:35.880]  you crave it um gotta be careful there you know it can take you somewhere where you don't want to go
[3:39:35.880 --> 3:39:40.360]  then you got to ask yourself which drugs are you choosing and what do they do to you so what are
[3:39:40.360 --> 3:39:46.280]  you doing with your energy that you're using that to moderate or using a depressant to drag your
[3:39:46.280 --> 3:39:53.560]  energy down because you feel overcharged or the opposite something that pepsia but these cravings
[3:39:53.560 --> 3:39:59.160]  are misdirected energy you see not knowing how to move that creative energy in a different direction
[3:39:59.800 --> 3:40:03.560]  that takes that's challenge that's what we have to overcome in the flesh that's with all that
[3:40:03.560 --> 3:40:08.520]  discussion is all about and all the different things uh in the world we we hear about if we
[3:40:08.520 --> 3:40:14.760]  care about such thing so so this is important finding the balance and all that now I've talked
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:19.560]  about emotion how powerful emotion I think of all the traumatic emotions that are associated with
[3:40:19.560 --> 3:40:27.400]  trauma fear anger anxiety jealousy envy grasping grabbing those are all fear based things about the
[3:40:27.400 --> 3:40:33.320]  flesh dying which it does and it doesn't like that you know it kind of likes to hang around
[3:40:33.320 --> 3:40:41.000]  that's kind of the nature of living organisms you know that's why animals do what living organisms
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:50.280]  do you know they don't have a real decision-making process so much as a reactionary process of doing
[3:40:50.280 --> 3:40:54.760]  it all works pretty well and it all flows together pretty well but humans we get the choice
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:41:01.880]  interpretation most of the choices that take place are in our head not in the reality out of our head
[3:41:01.880 --> 3:41:07.480]  think about it most things we fear never happened most things we want to have happened and imagine
[3:41:07.480 --> 3:41:13.240]  never happened so how much activity do we give power to that's just in our head and not in our
[3:41:13.240 --> 3:41:20.520]  doing way too much how much how many times do we think of all we think of all think of all
[3:41:20.520 --> 3:41:25.080]  the reasons why we don't do something and we rationalize it all we've got all these great
[3:41:25.080 --> 3:41:32.600]  reasons because we're just we're just we're just we're just no we're not just anything we are something
[3:41:32.600 --> 3:41:40.200]  more powerful than we realize if we would just realize the the mustard seed of that the grain
[3:41:40.200 --> 3:41:47.240]  of sand on the beach of that and here it is simply again knowing what you believe debris
[3:41:47.240 --> 3:41:52.520]  right and true and acting on it or let me find another set of words in my notes that I wrote
[3:41:52.520 --> 3:41:59.320]  down because I wanted to quote it right now faith is the assurance of what we hope for the certainty
[3:41:59.320 --> 3:42:09.880]  of what we do not see the certainty wow are you certain you don't feel that then don't worry
[3:42:09.880 --> 3:42:16.120]  about it let that one go someone else will have the faith for that certainty where's yours that's
[3:42:16.120 --> 3:42:21.000]  where you start not where you want to end that's called a finish line the race has to begin somewhere
[3:42:21.000 --> 3:42:27.560]  start now do what you believe to be right and true those are always the right steps especially in the
[3:42:27.560 --> 3:42:35.800]  new year as we launch the new year you're at home it's a day off hopefully a day to reflect
[3:42:36.520 --> 3:42:43.400]  and to be with your family and your friends and here I am with you today because you are my family
[3:42:43.400 --> 3:42:51.960]  and friends because I'm sharing a lot of deep thought with you this is what friendship is
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:42:59.800]  you know only I'm doing it in a one-way mirror all right I'm trusting you with what I'm saying
[3:43:00.440 --> 3:43:06.680]  and sharing it with you and you're not in this conversation with me here physically
[3:43:06.680 --> 3:43:14.520]  and dropping to the same level and knowing we're talking to each other but I know I am and and
[3:43:14.520 --> 3:43:24.680]  as we join in friendship this year as a group as the tip of the spear as the info war moves forward
[3:43:25.320 --> 3:43:33.080]  we do it with tremendous power as the united force within a force an invisible force that
[3:43:33.080 --> 3:43:42.600]  takes us somewhere if we just do that bit that we have the faith for and a foundation of values
[3:43:42.600 --> 3:43:51.720]  to lay that faith on that can move us into the 21st century into 2021 with the power that we are
[3:43:51.720 --> 3:43:58.280]  because here's what I know about the whole configuration if we can bring in the power
[3:43:58.280 --> 3:44:09.240]  or the non-traumatic piece the piece where God defines itself as love we bring that into the
[3:44:09.240 --> 3:44:15.560]  equation and I got to tell you as a young child I couldn't even say it as a young man I had
[3:44:15.560 --> 3:44:22.840]  difficulty expressing that word I never heard it from my father although I knew it I never heard
[3:44:22.840 --> 3:44:31.080]  it but I knew it it took me a lifetime to be able to say it to talk about it like we have been for
[3:44:31.080 --> 3:44:40.600]  this last 45 minutes but I asked you if you're a man out there find some contact with your emotional
[3:44:40.600 --> 3:44:46.120]  side a little bit and find a way to love yourself so you can really love others because that's where
[3:44:46.120 --> 3:44:54.360]  it starts and plug in to the universal love that allows you to find that and ask for grace it's free
[3:44:55.240 --> 3:45:01.880]  doesn't cost a penny it's free for the asking I once met someone that was feeling so diminished
[3:45:01.880 --> 3:45:08.840]  they wouldn't even pray for grace if that's you I'm praying for your grace right now in this very
[3:45:08.840 --> 3:45:19.960]  moment wake up find your power by the grace of God literally and stand in it and immerse yourself
[3:45:19.960 --> 3:45:27.560]  in it on this very first day of the new year and feel the love of it find that this is Dr. Nick
