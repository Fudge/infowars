[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:37.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:37.960 --> 00:45.000]  well ladies and gentlemen last night I sat there in the comfort of my home the
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.440]  safety of my home and could not go to sleep until the wee hours watching
[00:50.440 --> 00:56.560]  Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs in Ferguson, Missouri with gunshots going off all
[00:56.560 --> 01:06.520]  around them as criminals quite frankly I mean it is terrorism tried to shoot the
[01:06.520 --> 01:13.840]  police and you know do told him you can pull out of there if you want but they
[01:13.840 --> 01:17.640]  they basically wanted to stay in the middle of the fray but I think both
[01:17.640 --> 01:23.040]  Jakari and Joe Biggs will get the biggest bonuses anybody's ever gotten
[01:23.040 --> 01:29.320]  around here for going and doing that it's all over the news see but we see
[01:29.320 --> 01:35.200]  ourselves subconsciously as alternative media still I don't but my crew does and
[01:35.200 --> 01:40.960]  so whenever we're cops are hiding protesters are running people are
[01:40.960 --> 01:43.720]  shooting at the police bullets are bouncing off their armored vehicles
[01:43.720 --> 01:47.040]  Joe Biggs is saying why is everybody running oh they're shooting it's
[01:47.040 --> 01:54.080]  national news that MSNBC anchor chased off the air by gunfire it's national
[01:54.080 --> 01:59.160]  news fires burning in Ferguson and gunshots and there are Joe Biggs and
[01:59.160 --> 02:05.800]  Jakari in the middle of the gunfire not running and no one in my operation sees
[02:05.800 --> 02:12.800]  that as even a big deal think about that national news and again this is just
[02:12.800 --> 02:17.160]  how the media works and this is a microcosm of everybody else in this
[02:17.160 --> 02:22.000]  country we see government is invincible government is God it doesn't matter if
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.400]  we have millions of listeners four or five million a day doesn't matter a
[02:25.400 --> 02:32.200]  million plus people visit info wars.com a day we still think of ourselves as
[02:32.200 --> 02:39.040]  small we still think of MSNBC with 200,000 viewers at one time as bigger
[02:39.040 --> 02:46.120]  than us and I'm not criticizing anybody I almost picked the phone up last night
[02:46.120 --> 02:51.120]  to say hey go with this headline go with that headline this is epic you're in
[02:51.120 --> 02:56.200]  the middle of gunfire this is definitely racially-based people are burning down
[02:56.200 --> 03:00.000]  Mexican food restaurants and looting them you have the footage how incredibly
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.720]  brave Jakari and Joe Biggs are and I thought no they'll understand how epic
[03:06.720 --> 03:12.400]  this is and then it'll be told and then it really wasn't and again I'm gonna get
[03:12.400 --> 03:17.800]  into the whole Ferguson situation but our response to it is a microcosm I went
[03:17.800 --> 03:23.680]  to infowars.com this morning at 6 a.m. when I got up and we were reporting on
[03:23.680 --> 03:29.120]  the CNN people running and the MSNBC running not on what we saw and how we
[03:29.120 --> 03:34.440]  stayed and how we had have six hours videos of all of it happening right
[03:34.440 --> 03:42.440]  there. You know live historic uncensored what really went on true
[03:42.440 --> 03:51.680]  journalism instead look look at CNN did they ran because that's what the heroes
[03:51.680 --> 03:56.360]  do is they run our reporters stand in the middle of the gunfire now now I'm done
[03:56.360 --> 04:00.640]  ranting about that I'm just talking about how we need to get our minds around
[04:00.640 --> 04:04.340]  this as a people the Federal Reserve isn't federal it isn't the big stone
[04:04.340 --> 04:08.720]  buildings that are invincible that look like some Olympian God base it's a
[04:08.720 --> 04:12.000]  bunch of foreign criminal bankers that hoodwinked and swindled their way into
[04:12.000 --> 04:21.160]  control of the nation. See understand that but standing oh it's a big stone
[04:21.160 --> 04:25.960]  building it's the establishment oh it's got the power these criminals count on
[04:25.960 --> 04:31.680]  this allure of grandeur and invincibility now listen when I come back I'm gonna
[04:31.680 --> 04:34.760]  refocus and get into what actually happened last night this is a Rosetta
[04:34.760 --> 04:39.240]  stone issue you can see into everything on clearly they announced the verdict
[04:39.240 --> 04:43.680]  at night as a sigh of trying to make this as bad as possible I kept saying
[04:43.680 --> 04:49.120]  that for weeks if they announced it it right after nightfall they announced it
[04:49.120 --> 04:52.920]  one in the morning it would have been everybody went on to bed maximum effect
[04:52.920 --> 04:59.520]  two hours after dark they did it with perfect precision. When I first got online
[04:59.520 --> 05:03.960]  and I seen the price of the X2 and a DNA force I was a little hesitant but I

[08:18.960 --> 08:23.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:27.960 --> 08:34.680]  Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this live worldwide
[08:34.680 --> 08:40.560]  Tuesday edition of the Alex Jones Show. I am your host Alex Jones and we're
[08:40.560 --> 08:45.320]  going to be here for the next three hours covering the aftermath of the
[08:45.320 --> 08:49.280]  Ferguson situation that may continue and will probably continue to erupt
[08:49.280 --> 08:57.400]  tonight right through Thanksgiving. Now when you've got ISIS aka al-Qaeda
[08:57.400 --> 09:02.640]  killing around 300,000 people the last four years in Syria and you've got 15
[09:02.640 --> 09:05.880]  million children starving to death a year another 20 million adults you got
[09:05.880 --> 09:09.120]  14 million people dying in malaria every year I mean I get it there are a lot
[09:09.120 --> 09:16.160]  bigger real issues in the world but as far as a media event and a PSIOP and to
[09:16.160 --> 09:22.040]  study social engineering and to study anthropology and sociology the things
[09:22.040 --> 09:26.920]  the globalist scientifically study on record you can see how Ferguson is a
[09:26.920 --> 09:33.280]  beta test for things much larger I said six years ago that Obama was going to
[09:33.280 --> 09:38.640]  stir up race war in America I'm on record saying it let's not exaggerate
[09:38.640 --> 09:45.320]  probably three or four thousand times I said a couple times a week you do that
[09:45.320 --> 09:48.560]  that's at least three hundred four and five hundred maybe a thousand times I
[09:48.560 --> 09:52.640]  don't know conservatively 500 times I don't know you've probably heard me say
[09:52.640 --> 09:58.360]  it so much you're sick of hearing it now I'm not a rocket scientist but I do
[09:58.360 --> 10:04.960]  study anthropology social engineering sociology and you can clearly see where
[10:04.960 --> 10:12.640]  the system is trying to exacerbate racial religious ethnic sexual differences
[10:12.640 --> 10:16.800]  and play us off against each other while doing it in the name of
[10:16.800 --> 10:21.600]  multiculturalism it's divide and conquer it's how the British could have a
[10:21.600 --> 10:27.040]  thousand troops and control the country of India back when they first took it
[10:27.040 --> 10:30.600]  over hundreds of years ago was by playing different groups off against each
[10:30.600 --> 10:35.080]  other they would send in advanced squads to live there for decades and learn
[10:35.080 --> 10:42.040]  every little division every little religious or ethnic beef between the
[10:42.040 --> 10:47.040]  Hatfields and the McCoys in that area and then come in and exacerbate it now
[10:47.040 --> 10:51.640]  caught in the middle are the citizens of Missouri the citizens of Ferguson the
[10:51.640 --> 10:58.440]  citizens of America the police the shopkeepers and so you've got bad players
[10:58.440 --> 11:02.520]  here on both sides but it's not the rank-and-file demonstrators it's not the
[11:02.520 --> 11:05.720]  rank-and-file police officers the rank-and-file police officers are just in
[11:05.720 --> 11:10.280]  there trying to do their job they got shot at last night a whole bunch and
[11:10.280 --> 11:15.120]  Joe Biggs and Jacarie Jackson who I don't know whether I should reprimand them
[11:15.120 --> 11:18.120]  or give them the biggest bonus I've ever given a reporter it's gonna be the big
[11:18.120 --> 11:24.680]  bonus end but not next time I told them if the shooting starts you're to pull
[11:24.680 --> 11:30.080]  all the way to the back and get in cover well they didn't do that Joe Biggs
[11:30.080 --> 11:34.760]  really didn't and just stood right up there and we've got video and audio of
[11:34.760 --> 11:39.000]  it going up on info wars.com there's lower res live streams of it up on
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.000]  info wars.com as well but it just goes to the fact that they were so into getting
[11:44.000 --> 11:52.000]  the story as I guess media Yeagers or hunters that they didn't hide when the
[11:52.000 --> 11:59.480]  firefighters ran the police ran the protesters ran as criminals that's not
[11:59.480 --> 12:05.720]  strong enough a word I mean military attackers it is terrorism we're shooting
[12:05.720 --> 12:09.520]  at the police now here's the problem our government's so corrupt it could have
[12:09.520 --> 12:13.000]  been a federal agency doing that our government ship guns to Mexico to blame
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.040]  the Second Amendment got caught in fast and furious they staged a bunch of
[12:16.040 --> 12:20.240]  other provocateur events they allow radical Islamists in and allow them to
[12:20.240 --> 12:24.720]  set up training camps in the US so I don't know if it was provocateur
[12:24.720 --> 12:30.280]  probably not there's so much hatred and anger stirred up by MSNBC and CNN and the
[12:30.280 --> 12:34.760]  White House and the Justice Department that there were probably real thugs out
[12:34.760 --> 12:38.720]  there shooting at the police we'll get Chikari Jackson and Joe Biggs take on
[12:38.720 --> 12:43.480]  this but I will tell them tonight I don't want to tempt fate they want to
[12:43.480 --> 12:48.640]  stay and keep reporting that's great they are not to be at the front of course
[12:48.640 --> 12:53.320]  sometimes you're safer at the front in the back but I don't want my reporters
[12:53.320 --> 12:58.360]  getting shot and the police to the right thing hide behind their vehicles but see
[12:58.360 --> 13:00.880]  this will turn into the whole argument see when he'd armored vehicles we got
[13:00.880 --> 13:04.560]  shot at right as the m-wraps get deployed remember a year ago they did
[13:04.560 --> 13:10.240]  martial law training actually two years ago in in in areas of St. Louis and said
[13:10.240 --> 13:15.840]  oh it's for what's coming so there is a Psyop going on and I said this last week
[13:15.840 --> 13:20.200]  over and over again on record I said if they announced this fact jacari was on
[13:20.200 --> 13:25.800]  with me last Wednesday and I said I think if it's provocateur they'll announce it
[13:25.800 --> 13:31.720]  about two hours after dark and jacari said I agree with you if it isn't
[13:31.720 --> 13:36.160]  provocateur you announce it in the early morning like 5 a.m. 6 a.m. it dribbles
[13:36.160 --> 13:40.200]  out people don't organize the type of thugs that get on social networks to do
[13:40.200 --> 13:44.680]  this and use the demonstrations is covered a loot and rob they're asleep
[13:44.680 --> 13:54.160]  till noon you announce it in the morning I say 4 or 5 a.m. you announce it two
[13:54.160 --> 13:58.480]  hours after dark when everybody just started getting into the beer get into
[13:58.480 --> 14:04.080]  the liquor you are guaranteeing and the governor everybody coming out for hours
[14:04.080 --> 14:08.080]  and hyping it from like four on like okay just be calm it's it's coming just
[14:08.080 --> 14:12.880]  be calm they're social engineers folks they're being given federal orders on
[14:12.880 --> 14:19.360]  all this they know what they're doing so the citizens the police everybody else
[14:19.360 --> 14:23.400]  we're put in the middle of this for federal psyops federalization of police
[14:23.400 --> 14:28.000]  armored vehicles continued militarization that's bottom line just like in
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.200]  1991-92 when they stood down in Los Angeles and let the rioting it going
[14:32.200 --> 14:37.080]  Daryl Gates formerly CIA on record that was all a psyop to further militarize
[14:37.080 --> 14:41.000]  police and say see we need more funds does the average cop know this is
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.120]  happening no just like the Seattle riots were provocateur that came out in the
[14:45.120 --> 14:49.600]  Seattle post-intelligence sir at Seattle Times Esquire didn't believe me when
[14:49.600 --> 14:54.840]  they did a profile last year look it up they did a profile last year big cover
[14:54.840 --> 15:05.200]  profile and he said he said Delta Force was not at the Seattle riots running
[15:05.200 --> 15:09.320]  it and he went and looked it up and then the son of he's the police chief and
[15:09.320 --> 15:14.080]  where they all admitted they ran it guess who Joe Biggs who was worked aside
[15:14.080 --> 15:18.680]  special forces units in Afghanistan and Iraq guess who he saw there and got
[15:18.680 --> 15:24.800]  photos and videos of and we can show that Delta Force clearly Delta Force and
[15:24.800 --> 15:30.200]  then support units guys have been medically retired who then support them
[15:30.200 --> 15:36.000]  he saw Spec Ops operators Delta Force who he worked alongside in Iraq and
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.840]  Afghanistan especially Afghanistan he would like bring people to him and
[15:39.840 --> 15:45.420]  stuff that's who he saw there so I'm telling you folks Delta Force works
[15:45.420 --> 15:49.000]  directly for the president and was it Waco and we're the ones that torched
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.800]  the building and shot the people with the flare footage later came out in
[15:51.800 --> 15:57.660]  Congress yeah that stuff all came out just like CIA drug dealing came out in
[15:57.660 --> 16:06.360]  Congress but nobody ever talks about that and they were at the WTO again the
[16:06.360 --> 16:12.000]  fact that you bring Delta Force into this when they operate domestically it's
[16:12.000 --> 16:18.060]  dirty we had Delta Force myself and my cancer in San Antonio at gunpoint take
[16:18.060 --> 16:24.240]  away our footage of them when we were down there showing their drills to be
[16:24.240 --> 16:29.160]  clear they had a MP take it away from us at gunpoint while they sat there
[16:29.160 --> 16:33.960]  videotaping us so you need to understand ladies and gentlemen that's real
[16:33.960 --> 16:37.080]  reporting that Joe Bidschick are you Jackson have gotten so you've got
[16:37.080 --> 16:41.600]  horrible thug life thug culture garbage that's promoted to the media and hip hop
[16:41.600 --> 16:44.640]  and the rest that we have a special Rick Ross interview coming up but we're
[16:44.640 --> 16:48.120]  gonna premiere here today where he exposes the pipeline from hip hop to
[16:48.120 --> 16:52.080]  prison we're trying to stop this that's wrong that's terrible that's horrible
[16:52.080 --> 16:58.640]  shooting the police isn't just terrible but at the same time it's terrible they
[16:58.640 --> 17:01.800]  announced it at night and who can deny that we're gonna skip this network break
[17:01.800 --> 17:05.400]  because the guys have not had any sleep yet I want to get their report let them
[17:05.400 --> 17:09.840]  get their stuff filed and get some rest before tonight and we'll have live
[17:09.840 --> 17:13.840]  streaming on info wars nightly news tonight 7 o'clock central on with what
[17:13.840 --> 17:17.200]  undoubtedly will be more rioting and they're worried that it can break out
[17:17.200 --> 17:21.920]  in other areas most of Ferguson most of businesses were burned down all sorts of
[17:21.920 --> 17:25.280]  racial stuff burn it down we're gonna if you're white we're coming for you
[17:25.280 --> 17:29.440]  horrible as the globalist play us off against each other let's go to former
[17:29.440 --> 17:33.200]  staff sergeant veteran Joe Bidsch and that's important because he can
[17:33.200 --> 17:37.280]  militarily report on what he saw there and also seeing the special ops
[17:37.280 --> 17:41.240]  operators that he believes were probably with with Delta Force that's who
[17:41.240 --> 17:45.240]  they use domestically they had North Carolina plates by the way from Bragg and
[17:45.240 --> 17:49.240]  that's where they're located Joe Bidsch tell us overall what you saw what you
[17:49.240 --> 17:53.440]  witnessed I'm not trying to puff you up here it's just you guys are so humble if
[17:53.440 --> 17:56.600]  you to put out the report that you sat there in the gunfire when everybody else
[17:56.600 --> 18:02.160]  ran and we have footage that's national news it's national news that CNN and MSNBC
[18:02.160 --> 18:07.400]  people ran and they were way behind you guys cowering so all I'm saying is great
[18:07.400 --> 18:11.240]  job really I mean people stand there when a hurricane comes in and it's
[18:11.240 --> 18:15.360]  national news you know the guys blowing around you're there in the right in the
[18:15.360 --> 18:19.760]  middle of it as I witnesses that's newsworthy so great job Joe Bidsch give
[18:19.760 --> 18:25.160]  us your feel you just heard me from you know 500 600 miles away give you my take
[18:25.160 --> 18:30.080]  sitting here in Austin what is your take on what you saw what I said I mean
[18:30.080 --> 18:35.960]  there's not a lot of words that can explain the actual the site in person
[18:35.960 --> 18:40.160]  of what happened here and and also just to give you guys a background of where
[18:40.160 --> 18:44.840]  we are right now I'm on West Flores and Avenue in Ferguson and right behind me
[18:44.840 --> 18:48.840]  that this is the McDonald's over to my left the windows were busted out
[18:48.840 --> 18:53.720]  everywhere in this area but the building was not burned down but this is a huge
[18:53.720 --> 18:57.760]  complex behind me you can see all the way through this building to the other
[18:57.760 --> 19:02.640]  side this is a very wide building it was burnt to the ground the transformers in
[19:02.640 --> 19:06.400]  the area that feed power to the buildings exploded last night we got
[19:06.400 --> 19:10.400]  some really good footage and I took a picture just right at the right time I
[19:10.400 --> 19:15.680]  mean last night was complete in total chaos I probably counted somewhere over
[19:15.680 --> 19:21.600]  a thousand rounds being fired on the other side of the police I should say you
[19:21.600 --> 19:25.160]  know it was it was one of the most heartbreaking things I saw last night
[19:25.160 --> 19:28.040]  where the firefighters out here at the beginning of the night trying to put
[19:28.040 --> 19:31.600]  these fires out and then being told they had to be pulled back because the fire
[19:31.600 --> 19:35.840]  truck was taking fire they were shooting at the fire truck and you could see the
[19:35.840 --> 19:40.480]  firefighters being pulled down I mean exactly Obama has whitewash this because
[19:40.480 --> 19:43.800]  they couldn't do their job and they wanted to save a business and they
[19:43.800 --> 19:46.880]  weren't allowed to because there was these people out there firing at them
[19:46.880 --> 19:50.080]  and they were just trying to save another business in the community well
[19:50.080 --> 19:53.240]  Joe that's a great example of whitewash Obama says don't focus on the negative
[19:53.240 --> 19:57.600]  this is happening and people say well ignore Obama well they said you know
[19:57.600 --> 20:00.520]  don't cover a bonus of the media stop covering it even though we know they're
[20:00.520 --> 20:04.440]  covering up cases clearly here in the US only drudge is picking up our stories
[20:04.440 --> 20:10.240]  where we show that there's a cover-up going on so the sky's the limit but
[20:10.240 --> 20:15.720]  yeah there's the headline right there fire truck shot you terrorist attempt
[20:15.720 --> 20:19.800]  to kill firefighters I mean here's the thing I'm against police shooting
[20:19.800 --> 20:23.960]  reporters with rubber bullets for no reason but I'm also against them
[20:23.960 --> 20:27.360]  standing down and letting people shoot at firefighters I mean let me tell you
[20:27.360 --> 20:31.200]  something I'm glad I didn't go up there because people start shooting me I'm
[20:31.200 --> 20:34.840]  gonna get really upset I mean who are these people do we have any idea who's
[20:34.840 --> 20:39.000]  shooting at the firefighters at one point last night Alex it was it was a
[20:39.000 --> 20:43.680]  crazy sight and I took a an epic photo I think it's gonna be used for years on
[20:43.680 --> 20:48.360]  in it was right in front of the seasons greeting sign and on south floor sent
[20:48.360 --> 20:52.560]  where the police department is there were almost a thousand police officers
[20:52.560 --> 20:57.520]  lined up in the street there you know after they had burnt that police vehicle
[20:57.520 --> 21:00.960]  jacarjax and I were able to scale a building and get on the roof and get
[21:00.960 --> 21:05.120]  some really neat footage overhead of that car and then we decided to pull out
[21:05.120 --> 21:09.000]  and come down here on west floor sent and when we got out here all there was
[21:09.000 --> 21:13.320]  were fire bus fire trucks out here trying to put out these flames and they
[21:13.320 --> 21:17.400]  had no protection at the time there was no major system you're saying the
[21:17.400 --> 21:22.040]  police did not protect the firefighters no not for a long time I mean by the time
[21:22.040 --> 21:25.840]  the cops got here that they had already made the fire trucks pull back and the
[21:25.840 --> 21:29.320]  buildings were essentially just left to burn to the ground and as you can see
[21:29.320 --> 21:32.640]  this is not the only building on this road that was burnt to the ground there
[21:32.640 --> 21:36.360]  are multiple other buildings the Sam's meat market was on fire there was a
[21:36.360 --> 21:40.880]  rental storage you know you rent per storage unit burnt to the ground and
[21:40.880 --> 21:44.560]  other places I heard a church just right on the right up the street on
[21:44.560 --> 21:47.720]  Canfield someone was shot through the window their car and they found the
[21:47.720 --> 21:52.240]  dead body sitting in the car in the same complex where Michael Brown was shot so
[21:52.240 --> 21:58.720]  last night was complete in total chaos I was my mind was blown by the amount of
[21:58.720 --> 22:04.720]  violence and how how bad things went so quickly I mean it broke my heart to see
[22:04.720 --> 22:07.760]  these people just sitting here and you know where they're going to go now you
[22:07.760 --> 22:12.000]  can't even drive on the street now Alex you can't even go out here because it's
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.840]  completely ruined and devastated everyone almost everyone out here lost
[22:16.840 --> 22:21.760]  their business the amount that the people save up to put into this
[22:21.760 --> 22:26.680]  community to help out to supply people with hardware with the burgers with
[22:26.680 --> 22:32.320]  everything I hear a laundry place is all gone where are they going to go now it
[22:32.320 --> 22:36.960]  just broke my heart to see this I just last night was the craziest thing I've
[22:36.960 --> 22:42.720]  ever seen I mean far surpassed anything I've ever seen in combat elaborate on
[22:42.720 --> 22:51.600]  that just the the lack of the humanity I mean it was just out of control there
[22:51.600 --> 22:57.880]  was no thought about life no one cared people were popping off shots for no
[22:57.880 --> 23:01.320]  reason I mean I don't know if you guys know but they stopped the airspace last
[23:01.320 --> 23:04.800]  night they shut it down people who were flying in I by the time I got home last
[23:04.800 --> 23:08.400]  night I turned on the local Fox they were at the St. Louis Airport there was a
[23:08.400 --> 23:11.360]  lady getting ready to pick up her son who was flying in from Denver they were
[23:11.360 --> 23:14.520]  five minutes out and told that they had to turn around and go back to Denver they
[23:14.520 --> 23:17.560]  stopped flights coming in last night because people were shooting up in the
[23:17.560 --> 23:21.040]  air and they thought that it could hit a plane it was out of control that's right
[23:21.040 --> 23:26.720]  about anything KMOV reports St. Louis bound flights rerouted amid protests and
[23:26.720 --> 23:32.200]  you guys got some incredible footage of the burning and the looting that was
[23:32.200 --> 23:35.840]  going on Joe let me ask you this because I want to get this straight you're
[23:35.840 --> 23:39.720]  saying as an expert on this because you've been at least three turns of
[23:39.720 --> 23:45.960]  heavy combat are you saying you you heard at least a thousand shots in the
[23:45.960 --> 23:49.640]  direction of the police and firefighters well I don't know what direction they
[23:49.640 --> 23:53.480]  were in at every time I at one point I did hear a snap like one went right by
[23:53.480 --> 23:56.480]  me and that's when I got behind a building for a minute but other than
[23:56.480 --> 24:00.560]  that I think a lot of them they were directed at some of the the fire trucks
[24:00.560 --> 24:06.160]  when I first got here on West floors and and then you know the police officers
[24:06.160 --> 24:09.360]  reported last night to in the press conference around 2 a.m. that a lot of
[24:09.360 --> 24:13.360]  them a few police officers were injured one was shot pretty bad in the arm and
[24:13.360 --> 24:16.880]  was taken to the hospital but a lot of it I think was just up in the air and
[24:16.880 --> 24:21.320]  apparently at one person who was now dead sitting in the car so like I said
[24:21.320 --> 24:24.760]  last night was out of control and I was listening to the broadcast before I came
[24:24.760 --> 24:28.560]  on you're talking about how a lot of these mainstream media corporations were
[24:28.560 --> 24:32.600]  essentially just running for their lives and it happened I mean we were
[24:32.600 --> 24:35.760]  sitting out there Jacari Jackson and I were high-fiving each other because
[24:35.760 --> 24:40.080]  these guys were fleeing and running back there they're in a staging area way back
[24:40.080 --> 24:43.200]  here with the National Guard around them and cops patrolling around them and
[24:43.200 --> 24:46.400]  they're talking about what's going on out here like they have any footage you
[24:46.400 --> 24:50.080]  got you and Jacari on we were just showing some of the footage you guys got
[24:50.080 --> 24:54.320]  it looks like something out of a science fiction movie oh I mean like I
[24:54.320 --> 24:58.120]  said earlier when I opened the show there's no words it can explain to
[24:58.120 --> 25:03.440]  actually be here and see it that video that the video will never captivate what
[25:03.440 --> 25:07.560]  happened here the smell the aroma everything burning so why was it
[25:07.560 --> 25:10.520]  wilder than some of those battles you were in that Esquire and Rolling Stone
[25:10.520 --> 25:13.760]  wrote about where there were explosions all around you for hours and fighter
[25:13.760 --> 25:17.080]  jets bombing you know targets and you know some of the biggest battles in
[25:17.080 --> 25:21.680]  Afghanistan that you were in because I'm because I've got 30 men that I trust
[25:21.680 --> 25:25.440]  with my life you know last night it was me and Jacari and then everyone else you
[25:25.440 --> 25:29.120]  don't know who they are so it was the sheer anarchy was that it was the chaos
[25:29.120 --> 25:32.840]  that made it so weird yeah I mean it was like me and him against the world
[25:32.840 --> 25:36.680]  almost I mean it was it was two of us and there were thousands of people out
[25:36.680 --> 25:42.600]  here and gunfire going off everywhere I mean at one point I felt like it was
[25:42.600 --> 25:48.200]  just the craziest thing I'd ever I'd ever witnessed it was just mind-blowing I
[25:48.200 --> 25:51.280]  mean when you guys see the report that's coming up right now I think it's up
[25:51.280 --> 25:55.040]  now and they should be getting it you guys have to play this I mean it is
[25:55.040 --> 26:00.680]  amazing footage of what happened what should the headline be exclusive you
[26:00.680 --> 26:09.320]  know frontline Ferguson riot footage or or or I mean what headline should we
[26:09.320 --> 26:19.600]  give this video info wars I'm trying to think of a good way to you need really
[26:19.600 --> 26:25.680]  good words for this because the footage is just so epic epic Ferguson race war
[26:25.680 --> 26:29.880]  footage yeah there you go something like that and again folks we just have
[26:29.880 --> 26:33.040]  total transparency I mean look at Joe driving while there's burning buildings
[26:33.040 --> 26:37.960]  beside him this is crazy I'm gonna make the call right now Joe I don't want you
[26:37.960 --> 26:43.160]  guys back out there tonight I don't want to I don't want to have you guys shot in
[26:43.160 --> 26:47.760]  the head like the person they killed Alex you know that it's just gonna be
[26:47.760 --> 26:51.480]  hard for me to do something like that I'm the kind of guy that I don't run from
[26:51.480 --> 26:54.800]  it I have to run towards it you know I understand I know it's exciting but I
[26:54.800 --> 26:57.840]  don't I mean I don't need to get one of you guys shot for heaven's sake no we're
[26:57.840 --> 27:00.800]  good I mean we work together great out here I mean there was no issues last
[27:00.800 --> 27:06.560]  night we stayed within maybe two arms length apart at the most you know he was
[27:06.560 --> 27:11.120]  down filming really good stuff and I was talking to the nightly news crew back
[27:11.120 --> 27:16.000]  at the studio I mean we maintained a good distance and at any time if things
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.760]  got oh yeah you had bullets flying by your head man yeah I mean you we got
[27:20.760 --> 27:23.320]  footage are you hiding behind the armored vehicle I mean the police are
[27:23.320 --> 27:25.880]  hiding behind the armored vehicle and then you guys are out there with the
[27:25.880 --> 27:30.560]  bullets flying by that is just crazy you use the word though that a thousand
[27:30.560 --> 27:35.880]  shots you would estimate is what you heard I mean at one point and a five
[27:35.880 --> 27:39.520]  minute span I counted about a hundred in my head you know when we were out here
[27:39.520 --> 27:44.120]  for five hours six hours so you know do the math I mean at one point I think
[27:44.120 --> 27:50.360]  for about an hour and a half you every every few seconds you heard and then
[27:50.360 --> 27:56.560]  one time was like you know it was non-stop you know you know it's bad when
[27:56.560 --> 28:01.200]  the cops are pulling up a blockade of vehicles and then hiding behind it and
[28:01.200 --> 28:04.240]  then they're not even worried about people walking up behind them at that
[28:04.240 --> 28:09.800]  point they were just hiding you know but I do have to say this last night the
[28:09.800 --> 28:14.800]  police did from what I saw pretty great job they did not act the way they did
[28:14.800 --> 28:18.280]  back in August they did not attack journalists you know we had one issue
[28:18.280 --> 28:21.600]  with them not letting us come back to our vehicle but that didn't last long I
[28:21.600 --> 28:24.600]  told them I would get over here to the vehicle I did because that's what I do
[28:24.600 --> 28:28.320]  but you know other than that they weren't attacking us they weren't shooting
[28:28.320 --> 28:32.680]  at us they weren't harassing us in any way I had people listening to the police
[28:32.680 --> 28:35.880]  scanners and they were being told over the police scanners to leave the media
[28:35.880 --> 28:39.680]  alone to let them have free rain and coverage over whatever they wanted so
[28:39.680 --> 28:42.840]  the cops didn't bother us at all so I have to give them props on that you know
[28:42.840 --> 28:47.360]  I didn't see any excessive force last night like we saw in August you know
[28:47.360 --> 28:51.440]  mainly after listening to the two o'clock in the morning press brief by the
[28:51.440 --> 28:55.440]  chief he said that you know we were just going to sit back and treat this like a
[28:55.440 --> 29:00.160]  sporting event or a festival he said we were just gonna sit back and you know
[29:00.160 --> 29:05.320]  not be not you use excessive force because you know they they took so much
[29:05.320 --> 29:09.400]  heat from their actions in August so that they felt like last night they had
[29:09.400 --> 29:12.840]  to sit back to prove a point that if they're not out there running around and
[29:12.840 --> 29:16.280]  actually being proactive that the city is gonna burn to the ground but I was
[29:16.280 --> 29:21.600]  about to say that's the sigh of use excessive force up front today's gonna
[29:21.600 --> 29:25.120]  be ten times worse I guarantee it the amount of the amount of national
[29:25.120 --> 29:28.840]  guards it's gonna be in the area the helicopters in the air the police the
[29:28.840 --> 29:33.600]  agents everything tonight will be crazy not incredible job we have the best

[33:45.360 --> 33:50.680]  to get jacari jackson and joe biggs back on with us if you were up last night
[33:50.680 --> 33:57.680]  watching a live feed for six hours then you know why i'm so upset this was
[33:57.680 --> 34:04.200]  crazy and then you just heard bigs talking about hearing the police talk
[34:04.200 --> 34:08.920]  even on the news the police chief and saying well fine you want restraint we'll
[34:08.920 --> 34:14.760]  show your restraint then they have the media hype all this up let every thug
[34:14.760 --> 34:20.480]  and gangbanger in the in the state area come there to use the demonstrations as
[34:20.480 --> 34:25.440]  covered a loot and then they start shooting at police and citizens and
[34:25.440 --> 34:29.240]  kill somebody in their car and burn out a whole bunch of buildings giving
[34:29.240 --> 34:34.920]  protesting a bad name the first amendment a bad name the police treated
[34:34.920 --> 34:39.640]  the press nice because they were ordered to stand down this time because they
[34:39.640 --> 34:44.120]  wanted everybody to see the looting now does that say the police themselves are
[34:44.120 --> 34:50.840]  bad no it's a federally run scyop and then obama comes in and says let's have
[34:50.840 --> 34:57.080]  calm and he plays the part of the unifier the daddy figure while all of his
[34:57.080 --> 35:02.880]  surrogates try to stir stuff up just like they got caught in florida with the
[35:02.880 --> 35:06.640]  trayvon martin situation running the demonstration meetings trying to get
[35:06.640 --> 35:10.040]  things going violent because that's all they've got with their constituents is
[35:10.040 --> 35:16.640]  making it all racially based that's what they're going for now the video has now
[35:16.640 --> 35:20.560]  gone up on youtube that we've been playing in the background of your radio
[35:20.560 --> 35:25.880]  listener we simulcast television and in full wars dot com forward slash show
[35:25.880 --> 35:30.640]  starting at about six o'clock central tonight when it gets dark we'll have the
[35:30.640 --> 35:36.880]  nightly news on with our reporters on the ground with our roundtable in there
[35:36.880 --> 35:45.760]  breaking everything down I will probably come in later in the evening and give
[35:45.760 --> 35:52.360]  the crew some relief when they've been broadcasting for three four hours and we
[35:52.360 --> 35:55.880]  will continue to cover this but this isn't just about race riots it isn't
[35:55.880 --> 35:59.440]  just about race war as one state senator called it it's about cultural
[35:59.440 --> 36:04.720]  manipulation and it's about understanding how the manipulation works but
[36:04.720 --> 36:12.880]  it's also about being able to watch the news and to see the manipulation there
[36:12.880 --> 36:18.000]  and to learn how that works this is about decompartmentalizing the police the
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.120]  general public everybody so that we understand the larger game plan delta
[36:23.120 --> 36:28.720]  force was at waco I forgot to ask joe bigs about that delta force was in
[36:28.720 --> 36:32.440]  Seattle for the WTO that set the precedent for the armored vehicles the
[36:32.440 --> 36:37.600]  federalization the black uniforms in 99 they use these as rollout events and you
[36:37.600 --> 36:41.320]  can see the media hyping it you could that's the reason we covered it we
[36:41.320 --> 36:45.520]  don't usually cover what the media is hyping but if they're hyping it for an
[36:45.520 --> 36:50.320]  event we've got to get involved covering it so that we can try to affect the
[36:50.320 --> 36:56.200]  overall psi op for a better outcome of enlightening people not further caging
[36:56.200 --> 37:01.560]  them mentally we're gonna air the audio and the video of this the problem is
[37:01.560 --> 37:07.520]  there's so much cussing on the video by the rioters there's a reason folks that
[37:07.520 --> 37:11.560]  I don't go to these type of events if cops shoot me with rubber bullets for no
[37:11.560 --> 37:16.880]  reason and point it loaded in 16s at me with no reason I'm gonna get upset so I
[37:16.880 --> 37:19.880]  just don't put myself in that position everybody knows I've done it a lot I've
[37:19.880 --> 37:23.160]  been arrested five six times for demonstrating peacefully or don't even
[37:23.160 --> 37:28.240]  demonstrate it's being a reporter I'm glad that Joe Biggs and Jacari can put up
[37:28.240 --> 37:33.560]  with all this Joe got shot you name it now last night oh come right on in
[37:33.560 --> 37:39.560]  reporters yes we know your media that's fine now go show the bad looters so there
[37:39.560 --> 37:43.840]  is no good or bad guys in this except I guess the firefighters and the media
[37:43.840 --> 37:48.120]  trying to cover it because I'm telling you if I was a shopkeeper I wouldn't
[37:48.120 --> 37:52.600]  board it up I would just sit there and wait with my guns because I am sick of
[37:52.600 --> 37:58.320]  just criminal mobs of thugs going around and attacking trying to block people on
[37:58.320 --> 38:02.800]  the road who are in their cars clearly targeting people racially it would
[38:02.800 --> 38:05.920]  discuss me to see a mob of white people acting like this versus you know black
[38:05.920 --> 38:11.800]  folks and again that's what this is all about ladies and gentlemen is division
[38:11.800 --> 38:16.280]  but clearly you got a bunch of criminals using this as their cover to act
[38:16.280 --> 38:21.120]  however they want you've got the system using the criminal element as the
[38:21.120 --> 38:24.880]  pretext to take over society that's the bottom line and the fact that they
[38:24.880 --> 38:29.720]  announced the verdict at 8 o'clock at night or 7 o'clock at night and you know
[38:29.720 --> 38:34.800]  waited a few hours waited till it got dark and chat on it to the exact moment
[38:34.800 --> 38:39.640]  won't have the worst effect possible is incredible but again fires burning
[38:39.640 --> 38:42.920]  Ferguson gunshots heard in the streets we'll be covering it all tonight and
[38:42.920 --> 38:49.400]  tomorrow the aftermath the MSNBC anchor chased off air by gunfire
[38:49.400 --> 38:53.720]  Ferguson grand jury decisions seen in Fox News reporters attacked on air
[38:53.720 --> 38:58.600]  networks go live to Obama remarks over no indictment I mean what is the
[38:58.600 --> 39:03.720]  president doing responding to a police officer involved shooting by the way
[39:03.720 --> 39:08.000]  they had black witnesses that came in I have the grand jury transcripts here
[39:08.000 --> 39:15.720]  everybody already knows about this saying that brown charged him and had
[39:15.720 --> 39:19.520]  already gone at him once and that day and that basically the cop told the
[39:19.520 --> 39:26.760]  truth is it good that this young black man is dead no it's not good is it good
[39:26.760 --> 39:32.480]  that he was strong-arming a business right before I mean this is the culture
[39:32.480 --> 39:39.360]  now in America is to promote being thugs and it's growing across the board
[39:39.360 --> 39:49.200]  and that's what got mr. Brown killed in my view but what about 52% of black
[39:49.200 --> 39:52.080]  people never been born you're not gonna hear a word out of the media on that
[39:52.080 --> 39:56.280]  you're gonna have riots about that I mean I would see riots as it comes out
[39:56.280 --> 39:58.560]  that cancer viruses have been put in vaccines and
[39:58.560 --> 40:03.760]  sterilized here in the US you know you get sterilized or something can't have
[40:03.760 --> 40:07.360]  kids that's a reason to riot but you don't go riot with cops or burn down
[40:07.360 --> 40:11.320]  your own neighborhood you go after the pharmaceutical company and I'm not
[40:11.320 --> 40:15.320]  saying do that but then you could argue well you know they're going out for
[40:15.320 --> 40:19.160]  somebody that did something to him and there was no justice but if we put out
[40:19.160 --> 40:22.680]  enough news about what's in the vaccines and about abortion culturally
[40:22.680 --> 40:30.480]  there'll be a backlash where politically they'll get prosecuted but
[40:30.480 --> 40:35.440]  again the firefighters did their job they went in and they got shot at by
[40:35.440 --> 40:39.360]  people trying to burn down the community and imagine the people that
[40:39.360 --> 40:42.160]  was shooting firefighters trying to keep the community from not being burned
[40:42.160 --> 40:46.640]  down and turning that area into an urban wasteland jacari Jackson from
[40:46.640 --> 40:51.160]  Ferguson the epicenter the HD footage that will roll in the background as you
[40:51.160 --> 40:57.520]  talk is just so epic the merry Christmas over the Ferguson Main Street with the
[40:57.520 --> 41:02.720]  armored vehicles and the smoke and the flash bangs being fired and the tear
[41:02.720 --> 41:07.200]  gas being fired as bullets are fired back the other direction pinging off the
[41:07.200 --> 41:11.160]  metal structures I mean you have definitely been in the middle of combat
[41:11.160 --> 41:16.800]  now jacari and again you guys will not tonight go stand in the middle of it I
[41:16.800 --> 41:21.360]  want you guys behind something metal taking a cue from the police I mean I
[41:21.360 --> 41:25.640]  know you want to get the most epic footage but and we have the epic footage
[41:25.640 --> 41:29.640]  it's on it it's on info wars calm independent media stands in face of
[41:29.640 --> 41:34.360]  Ferguson gunfire while mainstream media fleas that's got the HD video right
[41:34.360 --> 41:38.640]  there inside the Battle of Ferguson jacari Jackson what do you have to say
[41:38.640 --> 41:43.440]  jacari Jackson reporting from Ferguson, Missouri that's right Alex it was wild
[41:43.440 --> 41:49.320]  helicopters burning buildings gunshots tear gas saw car crash a couple days
[41:49.320 --> 41:54.320]  ago this has been at least for me I'm sure for Joe as well one of the most
[41:54.320 --> 41:58.720]  epic things I've ever witnessed especially to see that this happened in
[41:58.720 --> 42:03.280]  the United States of America and as Joe said earlier by and large the police
[42:03.280 --> 42:07.480]  were on their best behavior we had no issues with them last night we did have
[42:07.480 --> 42:10.600]  some issues or at least we saw some other journalists who had issues with a few
[42:10.600 --> 42:14.880]  of the protesters or calm protesters few of the people out in the crowd we
[42:14.880 --> 42:18.240]  actually encountered a guy after we left the police station we were walking to our
[42:18.240 --> 42:21.360]  vehicle about to drive down here to our current location where the building
[42:21.360 --> 42:24.560]  burned down the video that you were talking about where Joe is driving the
[42:24.560 --> 42:28.240]  car the burnt buildings burning that's the building back there so we encountered
[42:28.240 --> 42:31.120]  a journalist he said hey can I get in the car with you guys some guys just try
[42:31.120 --> 42:34.600]  to jump me and take my camera we said yes we'll get in the car with us so we
[42:34.600 --> 42:38.600]  drive down here and we're out walking around we see the firefighters we see
[42:38.600 --> 42:42.280]  the burning buildings and then some guys approach Joe I'm not sure if this guy
[42:42.280 --> 42:46.200]  on camera I didn't get in on my camera but some guys walk up to Joe and they're
[42:46.200 --> 42:49.600]  about to mess with him let's see see he has a in four wars microphone on his
[42:49.600 --> 42:52.760]  chest he hasn't strapped to his vest oh in four wars you guys are cool I'm not
[42:52.760 --> 42:56.120]  gonna mess with you then he goes and mess with some other people it was it was
[42:56.120 --> 43:00.200]  bizarre the amount of stuff that was going on out here well I mean here's the
[43:00.200 --> 43:03.200]  deal if somebody punches you or Joe I mean you're gonna fight back they're
[43:03.200 --> 43:06.400]  gonna get their bucket it's not like you're some MSNBC reporter that's gonna
[43:06.400 --> 43:10.400]  fall down the ground a fetal position yeah yeah that's right but you know we
[43:10.400 --> 43:13.760]  didn't have those issues you know after everybody realized we weren't cops you
[43:13.760 --> 43:17.400]  know that was the the rumor for a couple days until people started to go back and
[43:17.400 --> 43:20.600]  watch our videos okay these guys are cool after they realized that they didn't
[43:20.600 --> 43:23.720]  they haven't messed with us since but you know we were out here they were
[43:23.720 --> 43:29.440]  shooting the gunfire right over in this direction just pop pop pop pop pop I mean
[43:29.440 --> 43:33.160]  guys going through entire magazines and you know at the time I couldn't believe
[43:33.160 --> 43:35.840]  they're shooting that many shots like they have to be shooting them in the
[43:35.840 --> 43:39.440]  air because nobody would shoot that many shots at somebody although we've seen
[43:39.440 --> 43:43.800]  that happen in previous things so they were shooting over here we are next to
[43:43.800 --> 43:47.000]  the firefighters if you guys watch the video it's when the video goes to night
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.080]  vision and you can hear the call come over the radio he's like get out of
[43:50.080 --> 43:52.960]  there is you know some guy talking to the firefighters like get out there it's
[43:52.960 --> 43:55.960]  too dangerous the guys that you know nothing against the firefighters are
[43:55.960 --> 43:59.440]  just following their orders they got up and they left and actually they got up
[43:59.440 --> 44:03.600]  and left in such a hurry they left their fire hoses behind but myself and Joe
[44:03.600 --> 44:08.000]  Biggs we remained on the scene and continue to record then we go down the
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.920]  street to where the martial law command base was last time now they have the
[44:11.920 --> 44:15.400]  National Guard posts up there as well as the media area a lot of your satellite
[44:15.400 --> 44:19.720]  trucks are up the street and we get in there and we see the Humvees driving
[44:19.720 --> 44:22.840]  around in the circle and that's we see that shot where I'm shooting over Joe's
[44:22.840 --> 44:26.760]  shoulder and you can see the city burning in front of them you know it was so
[44:26.760 --> 44:31.720]  wild so bizarre I mean it was really you know we experienced our action movie
[44:31.720 --> 44:36.920]  last night and I don't mean that in a good sense Wow just a completely wild
[44:36.920 --> 44:41.040]  what else do you expect to see happen tonight Joe thinks it's gonna be a lot
[44:41.040 --> 44:46.320]  worse well if you think about some of the riots previously you know the second
[44:46.320 --> 44:49.760]  night is you know when really people get really amped up we've seen the police you
[44:49.760 --> 44:53.640]  know they've been kind to media but they are you know pretty much standing back
[44:53.640 --> 44:57.560]  waiting in the wings just making sure that they're not attacked so I'm not
[44:57.560 --> 45:00.920]  sure if they're gonna get more proactive as far as stopping the looting the
[45:00.920 --> 45:05.200]  rioting there were some stores right in front of the police station the boost
[45:05.200 --> 45:09.360]  mobile store and I walked into in that footage that is it directly across the
[45:09.360 --> 45:13.560]  street from the police station so you and you contrast that with what's going on
[45:13.560 --> 45:17.840]  in Clayton Missouri we shot those reports this past weekend everything is
[45:17.840 --> 45:21.240]  blocked off I mean the police station has a barricade going all the way around
[45:21.240 --> 45:24.760]  it the just center has a barricade going all the way around it they locked that
[45:24.760 --> 45:29.280]  area down but you contrast that with here in Ferguson and they pretty much
[45:29.280 --> 45:32.240]  protected the police station the fire station but that was about it the rest
[45:32.240 --> 45:36.640]  of the city was open game open game we had many of the officers but they were
[45:36.640 --> 45:40.600]  so tightly compact you know you had officers you had like three m-raps and
[45:40.600 --> 45:44.000]  then you had all the cop cars behind that and all the officers hiding in
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.560]  between those and then eventually they made it out here to West Lawson which is
[45:47.560 --> 45:50.560]  where the McDonald's is and where the quick trip and at least two police were
[45:50.560 --> 45:54.640]  shot one of the arm one leg now this is not a game this is a serious they
[45:54.640 --> 45:59.600]  somebody was was killed in their car I think you're right I mean I think
[45:59.600 --> 46:04.880]  tomorrow is gonna be or or tonight but going into tomorrow at midnight it's
[46:04.880 --> 46:08.440]  probably gonna be two or three times worse who knows what'll happen as soon
[46:08.440 --> 46:12.560]  as the National Guard rolls in that's been standing by the last few days what
[46:12.560 --> 46:19.200]  do you think Jacari about the fact that they made the announcement I think it
[46:19.200 --> 46:23.000]  has a horrible decision to make it that late at night because we first heard
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.560]  about I think we were live on the show with David probably about one or two
[46:25.560 --> 46:28.360]  o'clock when they announced they had come to the decision we're like okay
[46:28.360 --> 46:30.840]  well we'll hear the decision pretty similar like we're gonna wait to eight
[46:30.840 --> 46:34.800]  o'clock you know they made it like some primetime TV event you know some made
[46:34.800 --> 46:39.200]  for TV movie made for TV reality they kept building it out kept coming out
[46:39.200 --> 46:43.640]  absolutely yeah and then they just wait till it got dark everybody's out there
[46:43.640 --> 46:45.840]  in front of the police station the beginning of that video you've been
[46:45.840 --> 46:48.960]  showing that's immediately after the verdict is announced and you know people
[46:48.960 --> 46:52.320]  are mad and they're you know voicing their opinions and then it all went
[46:52.320 --> 46:55.920]  downhill from there you know they could have announced it early in the day you
[46:55.920 --> 46:59.240]  know people at work at school or wherever they are but they wait till everybody
[46:59.240 --> 47:02.240]  comes out everybody's out in front of the police station are ready to do
[47:02.240 --> 47:07.120]  whatever they're going to do and you know by large let's not stop and forget
[47:07.120 --> 47:10.040]  about the peaceful demonstrate is there plenty of peaceful people you know they
[47:10.040 --> 47:13.120]  were upset with the verdict but they went home and they went about their
[47:13.120 --> 47:16.080]  normal business you know the people came out here a lot of people are calling
[47:16.080 --> 47:20.000]  them outside agitators provocateurs people who don't live in this community
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.840]  who were out here burning down the buildings last night that's right there
[47:22.840 --> 47:28.880]  are criminals that use that the the protests and the police behavior as a
[47:28.880 --> 47:34.880]  cover and if the police wouldn't have attacked folks early on then it wouldn't
[47:34.880 --> 47:38.880]  have turned the tide politically against them for a while to then allow
[47:38.880 --> 47:43.160]  criminals to take advantage of it and look they way over use the terrorist
[47:43.160 --> 47:48.440]  labeled when they you know say that's gun owners and veterans or terrorists or
[47:48.440 --> 47:51.880]  if you're in the Tea Party you might be a terrorist or your speech is terrorism
[47:51.880 --> 47:57.200]  but when you've got people coming to shoot firefighters and to shoot police
[47:57.200 --> 48:01.080]  because you don't like a grand jury verdict and you're trying to kill them
[48:01.080 --> 48:06.800]  to send a political message that is the definition violence or the threat of
[48:06.800 --> 48:10.840]  violence to achieve a political or economic aim is the definition of
[48:10.840 --> 48:15.600]  terrorism and I got to say it you know notice the media aren't calling these
[48:15.600 --> 48:21.520]  people terrorists now but with the Tea Party if somebody sends a threatening
[48:21.520 --> 48:25.600]  letter to an abortuary they call it paper terrorism so I just want to
[48:25.600 --> 48:30.280]  illustrate here that I think the organized getting together and shooting a
[48:30.280 --> 48:34.400]  thousand rounds of police and firefighters is terrorism and I think it's
[48:34.400 --> 48:39.480]  terrorizing the First Amendment and as a terroristic threat against the media to
[48:39.480 --> 48:43.120]  have the police brutalizing and shooting reporters like you and jacari with
[48:43.120 --> 48:47.560]  rubber bullets see I'm mad at that and I'm really mad at people shooting at the
[48:47.560 --> 48:50.240]  cops and firefighters with lead bullets because that makes the second
[48:50.240 --> 48:54.400]  amendment look bad what's your take on that jacari oh that's exactly right
[48:54.400 --> 48:57.400]  that's what all the of the anti-gun people say well look you see all these
[48:57.400 --> 48:59.920]  people they're gonna talk about those record gun sales and they're gonna say
[48:59.920 --> 49:03.120]  all the guns went to the criminals you know I'm pretty sure there are plenty
[49:03.120 --> 49:06.240]  of people who just went out and bought a shotgun and stayed you know hoping nobody
[49:06.240 --> 49:09.320]  came in to kick in their front door so you know I'm sure it will be used to
[49:09.320 --> 49:13.280]  demonize the Second Amendment I'm sure it will be used to push forward the
[49:13.280 --> 49:17.480]  police state see we see we need all these M routes in this heavy armor and all
[49:17.480 --> 49:21.560]  these other tactics because of situations like this you know if they
[49:21.560 --> 49:25.040]  would have did what they did in Clayton and had a more secure environment it
[49:25.040 --> 49:30.040]  would have been less a less damage out here I'm I guarantee you the police they
[49:30.040 --> 49:34.560]  were broken up in real teams see somebody shooting a gun boom take them
[49:34.560 --> 49:39.040]  down you have a few of those criminals that got shot early on all the criminals
[49:39.040 --> 49:42.520]  would have dispersed immediately they know they've got the green light jacari
[49:42.520 --> 49:46.880]  since you mentioned it I want to play this clip from the incredible footage you
[49:46.880 --> 49:50.880]  and Joe shot the videos up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com if you're
[49:50.880 --> 49:54.360]  a radio listener you got to see this where they order the firefighters to
[49:54.360 --> 49:59.600]  pull out as you are being shot at there are bullets bouncing around as this
[49:59.600 --> 50:02.920]  happens and we've got all the footage of the boom boom boom boom boom we're
[50:02.920 --> 50:07.200]  criminal terrorists that's what they are are out there shooting at the

[56:04.320 --> 56:07.760]  lawful just nobody would dare put something this expensive out at a low
[56:07.760 --> 56:12.600]  price they'd rather put synthetic cheap vitamin b12 that you can get for $2 a
[56:12.600 --> 56:18.520]  bottle and sell it for 30 well no we get medical grade so you know we have
[56:18.520 --> 56:23.080]  something that costs us 10 $12 a bottle and sell it for 20 something we still

[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:19.280]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:26.520]  Alex Jones well eyewitnesses told the grand jury black eyewitnesses that
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:30.480]  Brown charged police officer and have been attacking him basically I'm not
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:35.080]  endorsing the police state or how our country's regenerated but the globalist
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.280]  want to produce a thug culture we have the special report with Rick Ross coming
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:46.200]  up or he breaks that down the hip hop to prison pipeline I'm gonna give the
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:51.040]  number out start of the next segment start on your phone calls Joe Biggs we
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.120]  were gonna go back to him and talk about Delta Force that he saw there we'll do
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.600]  that in the next segment briefly he had to go because he's working on a big
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:04.120]  story so Jacari is back in front of the camera in Ferguson Jacari I mean the
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:08.880]  Psyop is so obvious when they make the announcement at 730 at night the worst
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.040]  time to do it with all that hype they kept coming out over and over again
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.040]  we're gonna announce we're gonna announce it having the police stand down
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:20.960]  letting it get hyped up MSNBC and CNN trying to let you know basically
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:26.640]  legitimize you know the looters as protesters I mean I think this all is
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:32.320]  very very suspicious what's your bottom line on what you're expecting because if
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:36.560]  this continues tonight in another day if it starts to spread to other cities this
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:40.480]  could be a major political distraction from all the executive orders and the
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:48.920]  rest of it what what do you think is happening Jacari yes I believe it is a
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.400]  major political distraction because we see this it just announced the amnesty so
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:57.880]  I think it definitely is conveniently located you'll never let a good crisis
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:02.600]  go to waste the new people were very focused on the Ferguson issue so it's
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.840]  gonna distract from anything you know who knows what else is going to be run
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.200]  through during this time when everybody so focused on what's going on here and
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.840]  this is an important story but there are many other things going on in the
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:18.560]  United States as well sure and I mean what type of country gets brought to its
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:23.680]  knees over a police shooting I mean clearly there's good shootings by
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.800]  police there's bad shootings there's good cases of citizens shooting people
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:32.760]  there's bad cases since when can the media decide to make something the big
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:38.560]  giant event and then all hell breaks loose predictably it's so sad yeah it
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.380]  is sad and as I was talking with David a couple days ago and he's asking why
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:46.160]  this shooting because we see other shootings that or other episodes of a
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.680]  police interaction that are much more cut and dry you know things where it's
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:53.320]  really not debating that the police officer acted you know outside of his
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:58.560]  his abilities when he rendered the punishment on the person put the
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.720]  brutality on him so you know why this situation I'm not exactly sure I guess
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.360]  they thought this was something that they could really get behind and push
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.400]  their whole weight behind we see it's incidents like Kelly Thomas the recent
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:13.600]  shooting in New York in the stairwell things are much more black and white in
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.960]  terms of you know right and wrong but they don't get as much publicity so I
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:22.880]  guess they just thought this was the right bright time the right area they
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.000]  had a right type of populace the right type of police response at that time to
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.800]  push the narrative so I think that's really how they got on this particular
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.920]  issue and there have been many other shootings before and since that didn't
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.520]  get near as much fanfare
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:41.840]  all right I know you've got some people there talking over the mic so I'm gonna
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.320]  come back to you and finish up after the break after we can move away or get to
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:49.240]  position where you're not getting talked over and we'll talk to Joe about his
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:53.800]  military perspective on the spec ops folks from Fort Bragg with North
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:59.160]  Carolina plates clearly army there clearly 35 years old or so maybe 40
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:04.280]  quite a few of them running around around the courthouse and the fact that
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.200]  they're there really escalates this we'll talk to you after the break that's
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:13.280]  Shikari Jackson from the epicenter of the looting and the rioting last night
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:20.600]  and people shooting at the first responders outrageous absolutely
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:27.000]  outrageous and it's just makes my headspin that when we caught people with
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.480]  Moloff cocktails and caught people throwing them right there the police
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.880]  wouldn't go after them because they've been ordered not to but they would shoot
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:38.080]  our people with rubber bullets I mean I don't even want to demonize the police
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.520]  but what do you say about that there's clearly an agenda in the orders they're
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:47.360]  being given to escalate this and we said if they make the announcement early in
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.760]  the night and do all this they want a big event if the police then stand down
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.800]  and allow looting they want a big event they're trying to prime the whole

[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:18.320]  wars dot com present planet dot com in the mainstream media TV video report
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.840]  about it England is looking at restricting knives banning people
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.240]  basically having butcher knives they proposed this before but now it's
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:29.720]  moving ahead laws to ban citizens having knives because we need to stop
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:36.080]  stabbings anybody can make a knife in a matter of minutes with household tools
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:41.800]  you can bash somebody's brains out with thousands of things a brick a rolling
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:47.080]  pin a hammer thousands of people a year get killed by hammers in the u.s.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:52.760]  gonna ban hammers just amazing that they can convince the public how about
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:58.080]  they chop our hands off because people use their hands to hold weapons how
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.960]  about we just kill everybody so that people stop committing murder this is
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:06.640]  the logic if there are no more humans we will have peace sounds like something
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:13.440]  Emperor Palpatine would say we have Jacarie Jackson and Joe Biggs both
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:18.120]  reporting from Ferguson Missouri if Joe Biggs is ready we're gonna finish up
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.880]  with Jacarie and then go to Joe Biggs here in just a moment to talk about Delta
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:31.280]  force that he videotaped Sunday and shot photos of with Jacarie outside the
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:37.040]  Justice Center aka courthouse there at the county seat and then coming up I'm
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.200]  going to go through all the latest on this because most experts agree we're
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:47.440]  going to see more rioting tonight the big issue for me Jacarie is that if they
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.120]  continue to hype this and continue to have the police now stand down even as
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.560]  they're getting shot at and bullets are bouncing around they're shooting at
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:59.400]  firefighters and their fire trucks if they don't go and identify who's doing
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.960]  this with police intelligence units who could easily you know see what's
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.320]  happening with their binoculars and surveillance if they don't swarm in
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:12.360]  and start grabbing the bad guys that are giving the protesters a bad name then
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:17.600]  this is going to escalate and be a free fire zone for criminals to continue to
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.720]  kill people like they killed one person last night driving in their car
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:25.400]  probably racially motivated if that continues it will spread to other parts
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:29.360]  of the country and I think that's what the Justice Department wants they ship
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.720]  guns to Mexico to destabilize it and blame the Second Amendment that killed a
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.040]  hundred thousand people the overall drug war has the last seven eight years
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:40.520]  thousands of them from fast and furious so we know this goes on they made the
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:44.400]  announcement at a key time to exacerbate it we have the live stream footage
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.760]  that you and others got that as soon as the verdict comes out people start
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:53.720]  running from the demonstration area to set things on fire black owned
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.200]  businesses wide-owned businesses Mexican food restaurants looted and torched I
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:03.880]  mean this what type of evil person wants to burn down a neighborhood of random
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.120]  people I mean I could even see the stupidness of racially motivated if you
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:11.160]  think you know it's whites doing it to you go burn down a white business that's
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:14.960]  still stupid bigoted like the Klan you know killing some innocent black person
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:20.160]  or burning down their church but but I just really don't get go burn down a
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.040]  black owned business it just seems so mindless and just seems like total
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:30.000]  criminals taking advantage of this jacari do you agree with me or what's your
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.440]  view on how bad this might get and and this could spread to other parts of the
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:39.400]  country yeah we hear a lot of chatter of people talking about they want to have a
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:44.500]  similar thing in LA and Chicago many other areas as well as far as burning
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.480]  down the businesses and looting the businesses we talked to a couple of the
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:51.120]  shopkeepers it's in that video that you guys have you know immediately after the
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:55.440]  looting happened and the people who got looted didn't have their businesses
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.380]  boarded and we asked them you said why don't you board your business I said we
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:02.240]  had faith in this community we trusted our neighbors and this is what happened
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:05.760]  to us and once again a lot of the people came in here to do the looting they
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.360]  were you know outside provocateurs and all that but their businesses were
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:13.280]  damaged nonetheless we talked to a lady who was in a barbershop also a man who
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:17.840]  owned a store right across the street that sold wireless wireless phones and
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.160]  so forth you know they were very disappointed and they couldn't believe
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.800]  that this would happen again in their own community they thought the community
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:28.520]  had healed there'd been a lot of proactive things going on and they just
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:34.560]  didn't expect it to be on this scale once again well I cover it jacari in my
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:39.800]  film from 2000 police state to the takeover my second in the police state
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.720]  series I show the police being interviewed I even show the newscast and
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:49.840]  news articles than eyewitnesses that Delta Force was there running security
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:55.760]  and that the White House was in command of hundreds of anarchists who were
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.480]  brought in out of a university in Oregon and then housed and protected and they
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:03.960]  were allowed to loot Nike town they were allowed to attack the cops were
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:08.240]  ordered to stand down be hit by bottles and stuff for the TV cameras now the
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:12.040]  cops didn't know what was going on later they spoke out then they were turned
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:16.560]  loose on the peaceful 60,000 demonstrators a day later and went out
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.680]  and attacked everybody so that's what's being done here they're gonna let some
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:24.760]  cops get shot let some firefighters get shot let some shopkeepers get killed
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:28.000]  people are gonna say you better do something and then they're gonna go
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.600]  after all the demonstrators people period and sell the message that the
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:35.200]  First Amendment leads to violence so we've got to get rid of it and that
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:40.400]  includes free speech online we've got to curtail this or it causes crises it
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:46.240]  causes flash mobs it causes Arab Springs when we know it was Google came
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:52.080]  out at two years after and bragged that they met in north of London at the same
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:56.400]  hotel where they had Bilderberg a year later and that they planned the Arab
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.520]  Spring and how to only let certain groups get traction on Facebook and
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:04.360]  Twitter see the globalists run these big global platforms and then during key
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:09.080]  times they steer things now is the average cop bad in Egypt no is the average
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:13.280]  cop bad in Ferguson no they're just the rubber meeting the road of the Cyops they
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:18.560]  don't know either jacari your take on that yeah exactly you know a lot of the
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:21.920]  guys out here they were much better behaved last night that they were much
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.800]  more respectful is that sir can you just please step back as opposed you know
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.800]  you know I'm blow your effing head off but you know my name is officer you know
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:32.620]  go after yourself it wasn't anything like that but yeah I think that is the
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:35.120]  case you know they're gonna come in they're gonna crack down just like we
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:39.760]  saw back in August they had the rights and the looting going on many of the
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.400]  businesses got looted along this street and then they came in the next couple
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.120]  days with the m-raps and that's when you saw the guys pointing guns of people in
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:49.640]  the crowd and doing all that so I think there will be a similar thing they'll
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:53.600]  come out with a more with a harder hand and deal with people a little more
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.400]  harshly tonight I would expect all right jacari I know that Joe's having to
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:01.040]  secure the vehicle because a bunch of media is now come to the site we're

[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:45.600]  the time I'm throwing out the pieces here I don't know exactly what's going on
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:50.560]  I know there's all the signs of the globalist through the federal government
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:54.040]  trying to divide this country and trying to destabilize this nation as a
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:58.080]  pretext for the national stability police force that the Rand corporation
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:05.480]  and the Pentagon want to set up I want to get your take especially if you are in
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:10.200]  Missouri or in Ferguson you go to the head of the line or if you're in another
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:13.800]  major urban area and have seen any looting that the media hasn't covered
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.080]  there's some sporadic reports of that coming in the way this is being hyped
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.720]  why would they want to hype this why would they make the announcement right
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:27.440]  at dark or you know 803 central a couple hours after dark prime way to create
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:32.800]  hysteria prime way to exacerbate tensions I want to get your take here is
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:43.040]  the toll-free number 1-800-259-9231 800-2599-231 and what is Ferguson
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:50.280]  diverting from the giant amnesty legislation the fact that the president's
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:55.080]  acting unilaterally the fact that lawsuits been filed on Obamacare saying
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:58.960]  he's overstretched his executive power that ties into the whole immigration
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:05.120]  situation trying to destabilize Russia what's happening with currencies
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:08.960]  worldwide that's a two-part question for listeners what's your take on Ferguson
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.040]  how bad do you think it will get do you think our analysis is incorrect we're
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:20.800]  just trying to state the facts here what we see 800-259-9231 but the way I
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:24.800]  look at it it's like that old cheesy show dragnet done done done done just the
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.720]  facts we're just looking at what's historically going on here indexing it
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:34.000]  with past activities and the playbook of the globalist and the fact that Delta
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.560]  forces on the ground time and time again they will run psyops for the
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:44.400]  president and they'll have psychiatrists behind the scenes sociologists
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:48.640]  anthropologists and they'll tell the Delta force as their mouthpiece what to
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:52.080]  go out and what to say and what to do when they got rid of the FBI hostage
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:55.520]  rescue team and got rid of all the lawn hoary you see in the rest of them at
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:00.560]  Waco who came in to do the final deal Delta force who did Seattle Delta force
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:04.960]  did the little idiot anarchist you know flown in out of Oregon know they're a
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:08.960]  part of government operation well we are paid by the government we are
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:13.280]  protected we don't work for the government yes you do so we're

[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:27.320]  as a pretext to make the public beg for tyranny and the epic photo that Joe

[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:37.640]  wars dot com is one of the top stories and this only adds to the mounting pile
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:42.600]  of evidence this is a federal shy op to get this out of control as a political
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:46.560]  diversion so Obama can get all his executive orders through if they can
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.200]  get rioting breaking out around the country the good news was the Justice
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:55.000]  Department got caught last year in Florida or now two years ago trying to
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.920]  get the Zimmerman thing going they got caught alternative media they've been
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:06.680]  caught trying to do that here and now grand jury decision has come out we've
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:09.800]  seen the aftermath probably gonna get a lot worse tonight we've got reporters on
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:16.360]  the ground to cover it and we now have two shocking clips that are up on info
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:23.160]  wars dot com official Obama ordered National Guard stand down during
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:27.560]  Ferguson riots unbelievable make the announcement eight o'clock at night an
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:34.440]  hour and a half after dark have the police stand down demonize the first
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:41.840]  amendment let a cop get shot let a citizen get killed unbelievable Missouri
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:46.040]  Lieutenant Governor Peter kinder says National Guard was deployed to st. Louis
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:51.880]  but was told to stand down in Ferguson by Obama administration since when is the
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:56.880]  governor not in charge remember he wouldn't say he was in charge remember
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:59.960]  remember the governor last week wouldn't say was in charge the Ferguson
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:03.800]  mayor James Knowles says request for National Guard were turned down that's
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:09.040]  two officials do you want to use that word saying they were ordered to stand
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:15.040]  down clearly there's a stand down how about you stand down shooting reporters
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:19.040]  and never stand down to looters or people shooting at you I think that's
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.920]  illegal by the way to let people run around just shoot at firefighters and
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:26.880]  burn things down Missouri Governor Jay Nixon stumbles on Ferguson responsibility
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:33.160]  question ABC News remember that yeah Obama's running this whole deal and
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:37.000]  they're they're tinker toying it they're seeing if they can get an uprising going
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.440]  which they can then be the saviors to and the police and the citizens are
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:45.880]  being played off against each other that's the style that's why we can't let
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:49.240]  them start the civil war I've been warning about at nauseam here's a
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:54.560]  lieutenant governor on Obama ordering a stand down why do we even have governors
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.440]  why do we have lieutenant governors why do we have states why do we have state
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:02.400]  police why do we have local police why do we have dog catchers why shouldn't
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:07.600]  everything just be federal because it basically already is here it is you know
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:12.280]  declared a state of emergency almost a week ago and and mobilized the National
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:17.920]  Guard and then they were kept away at the crucial time while Ferguson burned why
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:24.880]  were they kept away now now my question is a fact well we we know that they were
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:29.720]  kept away because they did not come in and stop that from the get-go they were
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:34.320]  deployed at other parts of the st. Louis region in the city of st. Louis mayor
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:38.680]  slay had them at a couple of different I mean a couple of dozen different
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:43.680]  locations I'm told maybe other parts of st. Louis County why were they not in
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.280]  there at the first sign of an overturned police car or a smashed police
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:53.040]  car window with a show of force that would have stopped this and here's my
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:57.520]  question that the governor must answer is the reason that the National Guard was
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:01.520]  not in there because the Obama administration and the Holder Justice
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:07.000]  Department leaned on you to keep them out I cannot imagine any other reason why
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.080]  the governor who mobilized the National Guard would not have them in there to
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:15.160]  stop this yeah that's right that's what's going on Missouri Lieutenant
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:20.000]  Governor Peter Kinder let's go to the Ferguson mayor James Knowles saying the
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.520]  request was turned down boom somebody's behind it it's clearly the Obama
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:28.160]  administration you can bet your bottom dollar that's who's in control with the
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.600]  Delta Force of the whole situation let's go to it
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:34.000]  unfortunately I know I've been on the count I've been on the phone in contact
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.240]  with the county executive's office I know he has requested I am requesting have
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:45.480]  requested the National Guard troops to come out from the command post to help
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:51.760]  restore along the business districts we have not seen that it's my
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:57.000]  understanding that the commander is out in the on the streets have requested this
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:03.800]  and those calls have gone on he's at this point so at this point unless we
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:08.400]  can get the current situation stabilized right now it doesn't appear that
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:14.600]  there's any end in sight and we need to have the governor step up give us the
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:18.520]  resources that he's promised from the beginning either that he would have a
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:23.680]  strong response the resources necessary would be provided have not been
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:29.360]  provided so far we need that right now yeah and guaranteed it's Obama that's
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:33.960]  who is in control of the National Guard country-wide under the new homeland
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:38.440]  security rules governors are more vestigial they could they could announce
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:43.280]  and reclaim their state power but they don't stay with us ladies and gentlemen
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:49.520]  your calls are straight ahead in full wars dot com we're on the march the

[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:11.760]  took a similar one seasons greetings Ferguson businesses burn police cars
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:23.240]  torched that's the article I'm trying to go to the article but stupid pop-up on
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:29.040]  the st. Louis post a spat shut it down I tell you even with max now they're
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:36.120]  just coming up with pop-ups that are just invincible they're so incredibly
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:41.360]  annoying we're gonna be taking your phone calls here in just a moment
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:45.920]  Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder says National Guard was deployed in
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:49.680]  st. Louis but was told to stand down in Ferguson he believes by the Obama
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:54.040]  administration the mayor saying the same thing well they're just waiting
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:59.000]  Obama is so then they can send them in when the public bags for the police
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  state but has to get out of control first before that can be done or it may be
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.960]  worse than what they've done in the past this is standard procedure to promote a
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:11.880]  police state it may be worse than that they may be wanting to stir it up all
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:15.680]  over the country as a destabilization program inside the United States to
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:20.640]  bring in even more tyranny and to become a political distraction from all the
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:27.800]  different things Obama is up to and what they are doing now I've given the phone
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:33.800]  number out the phone lines are loaded I want to take your phone calls and I
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:38.640]  want to get your take on this but also what is this diverting from because
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:42.880]  clearly it's distracting from a whole host of issues but couldn't the
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:47.480]  racepaders and MSNBC or others pick a better poster person a better poster
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:53.400]  child than Brown Brown from all the reports we've gotten was a big
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:58.760]  oversized thug who liked to thug around and was you know minutes before he was
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:02.680]  killed shaking down the little shopkeeper stealing some cigars and
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:08.520]  people say all big deal you know you shouldn't die for that listen you
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:12.480]  reckless drive you're gonna die I mean you go out and attack a cop and then
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:16.000]  run back and charge him again you're gonna get shot and I'm not saying that's
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.440]  a good thing that he should got shot and dead I don't get off on a black guy
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:25.160]  being dead I'm all oh right shoot that black guy that's not my view on this but
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:30.960]  I reject the police state I also reject the thug culture promoted by MTV and
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.960]  the rest of it as a political weapon we're gonna air a special hard-hitting
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:38.440]  report on that at the bottom of the next hour but right now without further ado
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:43.280]  I'm gonna go to Clint and then I'm gonna go to Ben and Robert and Neil and Ken
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.160]  one after the other and as each person hangs up that's your chance to call in
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:57.360]  800-259-9231 I'm predicting riots twice as big as what we saw last night and I
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:01.200]  think it's a safe bet you will see some other events around the country
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:06.120]  hopefully though this will become a dud like the Trayvon Martin race baiting
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:10.040]  because what else does Obama have the globalists are taking black people's
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:14.000]  future more than anybody else's their unemployment is at record levels
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:20.920]  basically doubled under obozo and again I call him obozo it's an ad on them
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:25.000]  attack he's no bozo at all he's a corporate front man doing exactly what
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.280]  he was put in there to do create division all the banksters robbed this
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.680]  country and deindustrialize us and then play us off against each other while
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:38.240]  they're doing that Clinton Michigan thanks for calling you're on the year
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:45.520]  what's your take on the situation hey well first I want to say I think Brown
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:51.600]  was picked because he didn't he wasn't innocent if they would have picked an
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:55.520]  innocent person to use I think people would have rallied around the protesters
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:59.400]  and said oh this you know I see why they're doing and now they pick a guy who
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:04.480]  clearly was it was it wrong and what he did so therefore you don't have those
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:10.000]  people rallying around those protesters but my question is is you know all these
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.360]  obviously it's clear today that it's an inside job you got people manipulating it
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:20.200]  all over the place you know they pick seven o'clock to air it everything well
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:24.440]  don't any of the local people that are involved in this see this or are they in
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:27.000]  on it do you think they're in on it or do you think they're just we've talked to a
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.880]  lot of locals that day one said they're trying to create a riot trying to create
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:35.040]  division that's what most you know the working black folks that we talk to down
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.160]  on the ground you know guys coming home from work with their John Deer hats on
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:41.760]  or mad they don't like the media they don't like what the police are doing
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:46.440]  shooting reporters but they also know the thugs are in there piggybacking on
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:50.840]  this and being protected basically I mean again they didn't go arrest folks
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:58.280]  shooting at the police because they were ordered to stand down and what you raise
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:04.520]  about how they picked brown the media picked this case because they knew full
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:10.680]  well in the end it would be a winner for the establishment you're absolutely
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:16.160]  right good to hear from you been in st. Louis the epicenter what's your take on
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:21.880]  the situation well I just wanted to say hello and thank you for taking my call
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:26.600]  it's been a very interesting you know last few weeks last few months here in
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:31.280]  st. Louis I mean nothing in my neighborhood got very interesting but
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:37.480]  down in South City over at Grand you know they were smashing windows and you
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:40.680]  know committing crime and all that kind of stuff but the one thing that has
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:45.920]  become abundantly clear to me over this entire situation is the importance that
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:51.080]  them of the media and the role that the media plays in anything you know you
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:57.080]  can't you just can't overstate that it you know basically your guys being on
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:00.800]  the front lines Joe and jacari have been doing a great job and have just blown
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:05.480]  this thing wide open and I mean obviously when you have the corporate
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:11.080]  controlled media you know figuring out which way they want the public to
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:15.200]  debate frame the debate from the public giving them one side or the other
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:20.000]  you know you eliminate any sort of chance to have a meaningful discussion
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.680]  about police tactics you know race relations things like that so I mean
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:29.560]  that's just the thing that has been my big takeaway from this is just the
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:35.520]  importance of media and the role that they you know play when situations like
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:42.520]  this happen I agree with what you're saying and clearly making the decision
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:48.200]  you couldn't have picked eight o'clock when I knew the decision hours before as
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:52.720]  a worse time to make the announcement if I was gonna pick the absolute worst
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:58.200]  time an hour and a half after dark and I would keep having the governor and keep
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:02.520]  have the mayor come on now calm down there and don't go crazy now hold on a
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:07.120]  minute I mean I heard that on the radio last night I was driving home and I was
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:15.640]  listening to coverage on 590 at like five o'clock our local affiliate and Jeff
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:22.360]  Ward the local host friend of mine he was going man they're trying to hype
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:26.040]  this man they're acting like it's a sporting event they're trying to make
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:33.040]  this as bad as possible absolutely who is telling them how to announce stuff I
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:37.480]  guarantee you it's the military the psyops and they're there believing
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:42.320]  everything they're told and again the way psyops works is I'm not blaming the
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.240]  military when I say this I don't mean the rank and file when the president
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:50.320]  shins the Delta Force in especially Democratic presidents I've noticed a
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:56.840]  pattern Waco WTO and other events and I've dealt with Delta Force on record I
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:02.160]  made the police state film about them and got messed with I'll just leave it
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:05.880]  that look I've told the story there's video of it I'm not going to get into it
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:12.360]  again today but it was not fun hotels broken into psyops you name it they
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:15.320]  just think you're not allowed to be an American and a First Amendment because
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:19.880]  they get messages from the president and get told what to do and they send them
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:28.840]  in there and they then start things up basically I mean who would tell them or
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:31.960]  at least today at 8 o'clock who would tell them have the National Guard stand
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:36.240]  down see why wouldn't the governor say who was in charge the president is in
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:40.960]  charge and who does the president use when they want to stir up a
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:49.320]  destabilization program Delta Force who created Delta Force Jimmy Carter they
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:55.880]  do not even take orders from the Pentagon it is a special unit over their
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:01.080]  three squadrons what they call them it's up to five squadrons now and and then
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:04.640]  they've got auxiliary sheep dip groups out of Delta Force they've got groups
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:09.200]  above Delta Force but these are what Delta Force operators looked and acted
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:13.800]  like that Joe Big saw in Afghanistan Iraq and I've dealt with them in fact I
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:18.920]  think I've seen some of these very guys 14 15 years ago messing messing around
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:24.080]  when I was doing stuff and I was just trying to show urban warfare drills
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:27.360]  because they would announce I was insane and say there are no black
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:31.640]  helicopters in San Antonio there are no black helicopters in Kingsville there
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:36.280]  are no black helicopters in Houston and then one crashed in Houston we had the
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:40.680]  Colonel on that runs soldier of fortune talking about it and they got mad at him
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:46.760]  for even publishing it they basically sent some threats to him they didn't
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:50.680]  even want people to know they were doing this martial law drill
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:56.680]  acclimation operation so the fact that they're involved tells me they're
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:00.040]  calling the shots because they were calling the shots in Seattle for Clinton
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:06.360]  at the WTO and not just running security and that's another thing they'll have
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:09.800]  cutouts like they'll have regular Delta Force people there they'll have Navy
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:14.680]  Seals there and then they'll have another group of mercenaries there dressed
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:24.560]  like them I mean things aren't usually even what they've seen Robert in
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:29.600]  Michigan you're on the air thanks for holding hey Alex what's up man worldwide
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:34.000]  broadcast brother what's going on never much how you doing man good thanks for
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.280]  calling hey you know what I was watching everything on fall last night on
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:44.360]  info wars.com now I couldn't believe it and as I was watching things on fall
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:49.640]  only thing I could think about was how this look the same as it looked when we
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:55.320]  invaded Iraq a few years ago you know after after so long just the chaos in
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:58.960]  the street and like you said that the military the National Guard they weren't
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:03.200]  at the hot the hot zone they were defending the more important properties
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:06.880]  like the the malls and there was just somewhere else and just letting chaos
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:11.240]  happen and then also they started to matriculate to other cities and that's
[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:15.520]  right they let people burn down a neighborhood of hard-working mainly
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:20.120]  black people they let the looters from out of town basically do that and if
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:24.240]  they would have instantly pounced on and arrested or shot people shooting at
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:27.320]  them what you're supposed to do it would have stopped but instead they're
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:33.560]  letting it get out of hand and look this is a Psyop period who do you think's
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:39.440]  pulling the strings it's definitely the globalist because you know what America
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:44.480]  is the last you know bastion of hope for the world you know from a biblical
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:48.080]  standpoint from an economic standpoint because the average man has a chance here
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:52.160]  in America and you know the fact that we had the first amendment and the second
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:55.400]  amendment which is under complete attack you know once that goes out the
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:59.720]  window then it's gonna be all chaos you know I'm saying and this is just another
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:05.040]  attack on the on the Constitution because I'm really concerned about what's
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:08.120]  gonna happen on December 24th when everyone's you know get ready for the
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:11.380]  Christmas holiday and then they will have to kind of UN treaties you know
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:16.840]  outlining out banning guns you know weapons I mean I live in Detroit you
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:20.040]  know as I was the most dangerous city in the world but you know I take comfort
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:25.120]  and have been protected to be able to take my family and my home the police
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:29.480]  sheet every every real police officer said hey we can really can't help you
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:32.360]  they can't there's no way they can get here fast that's right for the first time
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:36.200]  in years the crime rates dropped because the police said go get guns and all
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:40.520]  these liberals went get guns they went got guns took classes a few dozen
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:44.120]  criminals get shot in home invasions suddenly they're not carjacking as much
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:48.840]  suddenly they're not home invading as much that's the answer and remember the
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:53.640]  last six months New York Times everybody a Washington Post you we're a police
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:57.760]  state you know we don't need armored vehicles well now with them getting shot
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:04.320]  at oh we do need armored vehicles see you can see the Psyop but we the Psyop goes
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:09.440]  further they want us to now see the police is our enemy through all of this
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:14.880]  instead of realizing they're being Psyop more than we are and on average they
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:19.040]  know what's going on more than the general public does the average cops
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:23.160]  understand they're being ordered to stand down they know this is a Psyop they
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:27.760]  know that there's a cover-up on where the orders are coming from great to hear
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:31.920]  from you Robert in Michigan great points let's talk to Neil in Pennsylvania
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:36.480]  Neil you're on the air hey what's going on Alex good to have you here go ahead
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:41.760]  quick question about wondering if how they're bringing in went like when
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:45.840]  martial law is going to start in Ferguson obviously do you think with them
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:51.600]  having all these big protests going on across the country that it's just a
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:57.960]  easy way to throw the martial law in around the country but well look the
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:02.840]  Occupy Wall Street movement was funded by Soros was funded by a bunch of
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:07.160]  globalists but they left it open-ended at first try to get good people to join
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:11.200]  it with legitimate beefs against corruption on Wall Street and insider
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:17.400]  trading and bed rigging and all the rest of it well now it's the same thing
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:22.000]  here they want to try to foment this and steer it and control it and if they can
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.480]  get it rolling the White House the globalists would love to have riots
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:30.280]  across the country to create more racial division more destabilization more of a
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:33.680]  pretext to roll the armored vehicles out to all the departments right as
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:37.720]  there's a bipartisan backlash against that this is being done at a key time as
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:46.640]  a beta test just like Obama said Ebola was a you know beta test test case for a
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:50.280]  more serious airborne thing in the future they don't let a good crisis go to
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:53.800]  waste they are studying this they are they are testing this they are
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:59.960]  manipulating this and yes they are certainly trying to see if they can
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:04.400]  control it but as soon as they couldn't get occupied to do what they wanted 36
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:09.240]  cities in one night the feds ordered police to arrest them they had FBI
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:15.640]  sniper teams it was declassified aiming guns well it wasn't declassified
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:21.040]  WikiLeaks released excuse me prepared to kill the Occupy leaders so they were
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:24.880]  doing that to see if cops could be briefed on by the way we're gonna kill
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:29.880]  peaceful leaders so see it's all about seeing what they can get cops to do
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:34.000]  seeing what they can get FBI to do seeing what they can get Delta Force to
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.920]  do and they put Delta Force in charge because Delta Force will do anything
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:42.320]  they're ordered to do they read Machiavelli they're taught and justifies
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:49.240]  the means they're taught all the squirrely stuff and so they think it's normal I
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:55.640]  mean I'll be quite honest with you folks all it would take would be a few
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:59.000]  people to start shooting some guns to get other people to start doing it as
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:06.120]  well and what do you think copycat yeah definitely that would definitely start
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:10.480]  that up I was watching the live feed last night I was wondering about how
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:16.400]  big had the I guess the cops out in the regular closing stuff right in front of
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:21.400]  me was kind of whispering and pointed out any sign of the craft international
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:25.960]  boys up there like from the Boston bombing well they were wearing the
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:30.600]  hats the Punisher hats and the uniform of craft and I know I walked into a
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:35.520]  facility a restaurant there was a craft guy and he got up and left when he saw
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:41.480]  me oh why are you wearing a craft shirt man anyways I don't think craft was
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:44.160]  involved that they were definitely people dressed like I'm we're definitely
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:48.440]  there probably as decoys by the way something really just clicked we're

[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:20.720]  I predict Ken in South Carolina thanks for holding you're on the air welcome
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:25.320]  hey Alex I'm really glad that you've had the force to use the money that we give
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:28.400]  you a supporters to send your party and Joe out there on the front lines because
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:32.440]  we don't have to listen to the lies being in the box we can analyze them the
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:36.560]  raw footage ourselves as it happens well thank you sir that's our goal
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:40.120]  that's why we have the sponsors that's why we have the products so we can build
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:44.600]  good studios so we can dress nice so we can send out good investigative
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:50.400]  journalists so we can try to bring you live six-hour feeds so you can make a
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:54.200]  decision thank you go ahead and that's the thing for the folks that weren't
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:56.680]  watching because I watched the whole thing live I really appreciate Joe and
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:00.040]  Jakar getting that footage the way they did I want to point out first let's get
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:03.760]  this out of the way Alex as you know if George Zimmerman had to defend himself
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:07.640]  in court with his own personal resources in a case where the law enforcement did
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:11.480]  not want to charge him this officer right or wrong could have been charged by
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:16.000]  the state guilty or not and gone through the process and kept everything up
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.720]  transparent and this could have been deescalated number two as a fire chief
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:24.840]  the arsonist is a difficult thing is you can't just torch a building in five
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:29.120]  minutes and when jacarion Joe were down the block when they left the main
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:32.480]  scene they went down the block when the building was on fire those firefighters
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:36.480]  cutting the doors were trying to breach ahead of the fire so even they were
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:39.560]  surprised that the rate at which that fire was going through that building and
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:42.960]  they thought they could get ahead of it but they didn't that was a major for
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:46.000]  folks that didn't see we're talking about a huge warehouse building and
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.800]  unless the insulated with paper I don't see how that building went quite as fast
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:53.040]  as it did the fire department pre-planned so they would have known if there was
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:56.240]  something has met and if it was a matchstick house they would have stayed
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:03:00.760]  outside there would have been breaching making entry the officers have to be
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:04.680]  defended the line officers pulled those men out because the police department
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:08.640]  refused to give them support and defense and those firefighters have laid down
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:11.880]  their lives their community so the firefighters are not to be blamed and
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:14.680]  those officers aren't because they're responsible for every firefighter under
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:18.560]  their command and they know those guys would not have backed off but that's
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:22.720]  right I should have gone to you earlier and I want to hold you over do this I
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:25.320]  want to come back to start the next segment and have you start over as I
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:31.760]  saw on screen Ken you know quote firefighter are you currently a
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:35.880]  firefighter or are you saying you're a fire chief I was a fire chief I was a
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:39.320]  firefighter and I was a South Carolina Fire Academy certified instructor for
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:45.080]  interior firefighting I have over 500 if not 700 calls under my belt over 13
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:48.440]  years combined service in the fire service and I did Kara Badging done
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:53.160]  South Carolina for a short period as an LEO sure well I want to come back from
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:56.960]  right then and pick your brain if you watch hours of the live footage to tell

[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:11.920]  exactly what's happening I see Obama clearly in control the guard having him
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:15.520]  stand down having the announcement at 8 o'clock at night the perfect time
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:21.360]  having the police stand down this looks like a premeditated operation stay

[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:32.440]  take on what you saw and if you think we're getting it right here on air

[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:24.960]  human liberty it's Alex Jones we've got open phones throughout this hour and I've
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:29.080]  asked police officers firefighters you name it to call in and give us your take
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:32.920]  on the live stream feeds that we and others have had the coverage you've
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:38.720]  seen on mainstream media we had upwards of 200,000 people at any one time logged
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:43.720]  in to our two different streams last night and that's a lot for alternative
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:47.360]  media I mean I'm on commercial and FM stations you can even kind of call that
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:52.840]  mainstream media or old-school alternative media but to be trailblazing
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:58.280]  with hundreds of thousands of live streaming viewers really challenges the
[02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:06.360]  old media because they can't just show you little clips and then try to spin it
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:11.320]  you can see for yourself what really went on and what happened certainly we
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:16.880]  took the hours of footage we have and condensed some of it down to I want to
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:20.520]  call it highlights because it's pretty scary stuff but the absolute chaos you
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:25.200]  know Joe Biggs had embedded reporters with him in Iraq and Afghanistan they
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:29.720]  got written about in Esquire and in Rolling Stone you name it because
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:33.680]  Biggs happened to see a lot of heavy combat he got blown up twice in armored
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:38.840]  vehicles he got shot up several times he was in some of the biggest Taliban
[02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:45.440]  battles that there were in Afghanistan that went on for days in some cases and
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:50.360]  he said this was more bizarre because it was just so stupid that this the
[02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:55.800]  shooting in all directions and people burning things down and protesters
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:59.640]  robbing protesters because they're not really protesters some of them
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:04.640]  obviously are criminals piggybacking on this but what type of criminal shoots at
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:09.640]  firefighters trying to put people's houses out in a black neighborhood I
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:13.720]  mean they burned down mainly black businesses there's an article out
[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:18.920]  reporting on this most businesses destroy where minority owned right
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:22.200]  Bart reports and it goes over a listing of them and then they burned down like
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:27.840]  Mexican food restaurants and cleaners owned by black people I mean let's just
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:35.800]  let's just burn this cleaners down here that'd be like God forbid let's say a
[02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:41.360]  bad cop shot one of my kids for no reason I would civilly sue them I would
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:47.280]  go after them I would speak about it and if justice wasn't done well I have to
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:53.800]  think about it at that point but it would be that cop not all the cops or not a
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:11:00.440]  Mexican food restaurant or here let me take my baby to a protest again folks
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:04.840]  are taught that this is how they protest because it makes you pathetic in the
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:09.720]  world's eyes instead of being politically involved the establishment
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:13.080]  doesn't mess with people that are politically involved in her middle
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:16.280]  class I don't care what color you are because they know your trouble you know
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:20.600]  how to get stuff done they don't mess with somebody in a sports jacket with a
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:24.600]  suit and tie that pulls up in a Mercedes Benz and I'm not saying you're not
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:29.000]  successful if you don't pull up in a Mercedes Benz the point is is that system
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:35.640]  pays attention to that and they know you're not a wounded gazelle even if
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:40.320]  you're looking at the system is purely predatory the system has predatory
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:45.360]  sectors in it veins in it and there's an attempt to make the system predatory
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:50.080]  across the board that's globalism that's tyranny but that's from the top
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:56.720]  down we need to politically target the progenitors the kingpins the mafia
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:02.680]  dons the globalist that are setting the social engineering system not
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:10.960]  firefighters not police officers not a black church got set on fire big's is
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:16.360]  gonna go over get some footage of that I mean what what is going on here what
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:22.480]  culture has been created where we see this thug life garbage by the way they've
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:26.640]  got it in white culture where it's more of like a end of the world I don't care
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:32.800]  about anybody hurt myself hurt others almost satanic stuff going on this is
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:36.680]  happening in the youth it's being pushed in the culture and it's part of the
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:40.280]  societal sickness now I'm gonna shut up and go to Ken and others Ken called in
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:44.320]  earlier but we went to breaks on to recap he's been a police officer he's
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:50.480]  also 13 years of firefighter and a police chief a fire chief and he's
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:55.160]  moved on to other lines of work now but he was breaking down what he saw in our
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:59.800]  live streams and some of the HD footage of where the firefighters are getting
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:05.120]  shot at and get ordered to be pulled out and bullets are literally bouncing off
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:11.160]  of the armored vehicles and hitting the fire trucks just like we saw in 1992 in
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:15.600]  LA people shooting at the fire trucks we had two officers that were shot last
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:20.560]  night you name it when this will only create massive enmity now in the
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:27.080]  community massive distrust massive problems and the larger question is why
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:30.440]  did Obama order a stand-down of the National Guard when the governor had
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:33.800]  said they would be energetic and aggressive why did the police stand down
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:39.160]  that will elicit a much bigger response tonight and will be the green light for
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:43.520]  this to show up in other parts of the country in my humble view now we'll get
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:48.660]  Ken's take as an expert a firefighter a former fire chief and who's also a
[02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:53.280]  police officer can tell me what you think of our coverage so far then give
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:58.400]  us your perspectives on what you saw and it sounded like you were hinting that
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:02.560]  footage you saw that we put out where they're trying to get ahead of the fire
[02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:06.880]  and block it but then it was moving so quickly were you hinting at the fact
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:10.520]  that these arsonist look like they have sophisticated training or what were you
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:15.200]  getting at yes I'm hitting let's let's for credibility sake let me clarify now
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:18.920]  I was law enforcement I was a security officer we get police training and we're
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:21.760]  sworn law enforcement for the state I was not a regular police officer though I
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:25.240]  was a big cop on the account I had to do police work just your other thing you
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:28.200]  would just say you carried a badge and gone and you were talking about being a
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:32.720]  firefighter but just getting out of the way go ahead the footage has been great
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:36.320]  initially I want to point out that those officers when the first shots were
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:39.720]  fired which probably were an agent provocateur when Joe and jacquard were
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:44.360]  right there at the police station those officers started backing down and I
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:49.000]  posted you know watch out because they're backing down to play the victim
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.640]  here so they can justify a brutal response and then a few minutes later we
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:56.880]  see them moving down the street for the record when they closed off those
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:01.440]  streets with cars that Joe and jacquard reported that made the streets were all
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:07.720]  then public walkways once they blocked those streets to car traffic it was
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:12.840]  walkways they they then marched on the people and tear gassed the crowd which
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:17.360]  led to you know forcing the crowd into a violent response and then all of a
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:20.560]  sudden we find about the fires and that's the problem a building that
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:25.200]  large down the street that far away it takes time to burn a building like
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:29.360]  that like the nail place has highly flammable chemicals in it it could burn
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:32.840]  but even that place it takes a few minutes to get the fire going to a
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:37.720]  point that it roars like that with the major building it it you have to
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:41.040]  question the timing I've responded to fires after a half hour when we get
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:44.840]  there in time to save a small building I mean I'm talking about a house not even
[02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:48.320]  a major warehouse so unless that installation was in there those those
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:51.280]  guys pre-planned their building so if there was something dangerous in there
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:54.440]  and they thought it was in the burn quickly and collapsed like the major
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:57.520]  fire that happened in Georgetown South Carolina recently where our firefighters
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:00.560]  didn't go in because they knew ahead of time don't go in if it catches fire
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:04.520]  surrounded drown with this they did a surround drown on the front but they
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:08.120]  began cutting in breaching as though they could get ahead of the fire so they
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:11.760]  were not anticipating that that fire could sweep that entire building the
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:17.440]  way it did so it and the other thing is Alex we always teach watch the crowd in
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:20.520]  a potential arson situation that we know this is arson whether or not it's an
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:24.320]  age of provocateur whether it's not you know whether it's outside whether it's
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:28.480]  Delta Force black helicopters I don't care whoever burned it did it it was
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:33.280]  arson that meant that they they they would be watching and the second thing is
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:37.120]  if it was some sort of agent provocateur they would then be the ones firing on
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:40.760]  the on the fire department immediately the police should have gone ahead and
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:44.600]  circled and and given them shielding and then looked for who where those shots
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:47.840]  are being fired because that's your that's your prime suspect in the arson
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:51.640]  case because they don't want the fire to go out the firefighters were concerned
[02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:54.040]  that if they didn't contain it in that building it could spread to the
[02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:57.960]  surrounding community literally burning down the city and so they weren't going
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:02.240]  to give up but that's what begs the question is how burnt buildings like
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:05.960]  these burn that fast because it takes planning you know to make sure a building
[02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:10.120]  goes up in flames I've seen a building burn that I suspected that it was allowed
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:14.120]  to burn and it took two hours to burn it down and we're talking about a lumber
[02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:18.160]  we're talking about lumber burning you know and paint company and it took
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:22.280]  hours to burn sure unless it's really dry there's 80 mile an hour winds I guess
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:25.360]  those are some of the only fires that can really go quick unless it's an old
[02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:29.320]  tinderbox house I'm not a firefighter like you but I absolutely hear what
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:33.080]  you're saying big picture what do you think's really going on here what do you
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:36.520]  think this is distracting from who do you think's behind this if it is an
[02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:42.320]  overall Psyop well Obama couldn't get his the outbreak so far and he couldn't
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:47.400]  get his other problems so it looks like this is this is a tinderbox this is
[02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:52.960]  throwing a spark to to it into a tinderbox because this is escalating
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:56.520]  because the people in Ferguson have a right to be upset there has been
[02:17:56.520 --> 02:17:59.720]  malfeasance we're seeing I mean no one wants to discuss about the black guy
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:03.240]  that was suicidal they got shot by cops when he was over 10 feet away there was
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:06.400]  no way for you to jump on those two officers it happened right after this
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:10.640]  guy shooting no one is protesting Crawford to this level so they're
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:15.040]  provoking this because there was sufficient manpower to have gotten the
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:19.120]  instigators and the provocateurs when the people were in the street and they
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:22.880]  were protesting peaceably even though there might have been gunfire there was
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:27.000]  nobody in the crowd Alex when you dump a mag into a crowd you expect multiple
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.920]  casualties there weren't multiple casualties at the first firing the
[02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:34.880]  black gentleman standing next to Joe last night was cussing at the cops and
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:38.760]  taunting them but he would not fire first he said hey if you shoot at us and
[02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:41.640]  you kill anybody else we'll shoot back and that's what people need to look at
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:45.000]  the locals were saying hey this has got to stop this shoot first mentality
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:48.200]  has got to stop but if you shoot us we'll shoot back they were not being
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:51.840]  provocative or firing at the police officers so it calls into question who's
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:55.160]  doing the shooting and the people in the street were not shooting they were
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:59.360]  kneeling some of them in a peaceful protest like tenement square and the
[02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:03.280]  response was to tear gas a crowd it's a myth that you can do right control Alex
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:06.960]  you can't control a crowd they can tear you apart I've got a friend that was a
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:11.800]  veteran in Korea and when the human wave attacks stop started in Korea they
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:14.960]  slaughtered them wholesale they couldn't stop the human wave attacks if that
[02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:18.560]  crowded wanted those police officers they could have had them they were being
[02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:23.680]  peaceable but to attack the crowd with violence is to provoke the people because
[02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:27.520]  the next step when they can't get justice they feel they have been wrong is
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:32.360]  violence when the people can't get the justice didn't get angry and as Joe
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:36.120]  already pointed out those that cell phone store could have been defended the
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:39.960]  guys had bullet ballistic shields they had body armor and they had cover behind
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:42.920]  the people they could have stopped the looting of the close by story absolutely
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:46.920]  look if they had a pound stone people the criminals immediately they'd have been
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:51.560]  heroes all this would have got shut down that's 101 great call great

[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:56.800]  the top of info wars calm tonight I guess the headline will be a live feed of
[02:24:56.800 --> 02:25:02.800]  Ferguson war zone because that's what it is all right let's go through a bunch of
[02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:07.360]  your calls and I've got other breaking news Obamacare architect Gruber set to
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:12.160]  testify at December House hearing good drag him in that's just some of the
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:16.120]  news we've got coming up right now let's go to Dan in Texas thanks for
[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:22.400]  holding hi Alex good afternoon go ahead thank you all right now I was
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:25.800]  listening to the show today and now watching their live feed last night
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:31.720]  it just occurred to me what is we could like the info warriors could show that
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:35.960]  there's still some hope for the light in the world and help maybe a little fun to
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:39.560]  help rebuild not rebuild the city I mean that's that's overcoming just but
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:42.320]  some of these mom calls they got to be a deductible they you know something like
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:47.200]  that like the home lady the Obama home lady or that artist you met the Alamo
[02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:52.920]  and you know I try to do that I try to show good cops I try to show you know
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:57.120]  success stories I try to be as positive as I can because that's the answer I don't
[02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:02.840]  want to just be negative but at the same time there's footage of what looks like
[02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:08.880]  you know part black CNN reporter being hit in the head by a rock and there's
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:13.280]  another lady who looks you know a lady of color from another channel being
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:19.120]  attacked by the crowd and I just think it's a bunch of scum thugs that just
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:23.760]  want an excuse to commit crime and that's what you always see is a lot of
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:28.480]  criminals will piggyback on some cause and the system knows this and is
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:32.640]  allowing this to go on so they can demonize all of our basic freedoms but
[02:26:32.640 --> 02:26:37.040]  I hear you just desperate you can just see the desperate this is a low blow
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:42.400]  this isn't something up there at the 9-eleven type thing this is so low
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:48.720]  that this is the last like last-ditch effort and oh I agree and and and why
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:51.800]  would Delta Force I'm not saying they've done this but they've done it before in
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:55.800]  Seattle and they killed the folks at Waco they're the ones came out in
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:59.680]  congressional testimony people don't say there's a mystery of Waco there's no
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:03.760]  mystery Delta Force was there they were the ones behind the Bradley fighting
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:08.240]  vehicles doing the infantry maneuvers they were the ones that shot the people
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:11.120]  they were trying to get out the back they were the ones that went in and put
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:16.280]  the bomb on the church records vault the concrete structure inside where the
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:19.480]  women and children were hiding and it turned them into splattered soup all
[02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:24.840]  over the walls general Benton K. Parton was the former head of Air Force
[02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:29.000]  weapons development there's like three degrees frequent guests of this show
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:35.400]  ran the heart program everything he went and investigated it he got the photos
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:40.080]  and all the rest of it the people were unburned they were soup the Delta Force
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:44.120]  with an infantry maneuver climbed in the building killed a bunch of people they
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:49.200]  had an order kill everyone and they went in there and they killed the men they
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:52.960]  went in and planted a bomb on top the building and then blew a hole right
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:59.000]  through it with shrapnel with a shape charge killing everybody and the fact
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:05.960]  that they're there now prime suspects in everything I'll tell you right now or
[02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:10.440]  whoever those special forces are from Fort Bragg may not be Delta Force I'm
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:14.480]  just sorry they've done it over and over and over again as soon as they showed
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:20.360]  up it screamed red flags scream staged events and who do they work for not
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:25.960]  even the Pentagon they work for the president directly and so that tells
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:29.960]  you who's in charge of this whole situation because big saw them basically
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:35.520]  ordering the police and sheriffs and state police around so the army's there
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:41.200]  I believe it's a Psyop they're letting the crooks run wild to try to get this
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:46.000]  stirred up nationwide and then you run a Psyop as you stir it up and let it
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:50.000]  happen you also demonize all demonstrations going forward and you
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:53.920]  legitimize weaponizing the police federalizing the police that's the end
[02:28:53.920 --> 02:28:57.640]  game now I'm not saying Delta Force did this this time but they've done it
[02:28:57.640 --> 02:29:02.600]  before they did it in Seattle so I'm saying this is suspicious what do you
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:09.840]  say I'm not going to go to calls because I'm going to break the short
[02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:13.200]  segment long statement coming up I'm going to write to James and then Chris

[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:53.520]  week but i want to premiere it here on the radio
[02:33:53.520 --> 02:33:57.680]  another video linked up on info works dot com because this is
[02:33:57.680 --> 02:34:02.560]  you know first billionaire you know ghetto drug dealer for the cia
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:07.280]  he's repented of it decades ago went public about what happened they kept
[02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:11.440]  his sentence a lot longer because he stood up against the system rick ross
[02:34:11.440 --> 02:34:15.520]  that brief interview is coming up but it's very powerful and it's challenge to
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:19.520]  hip hop it's been weaponized to create this type of nightmare
[02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:23.920]  gangster thug culture that's spreading like a disease into every community
[02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:27.600]  it is weaponized media on record that's coming up here

[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:41.440]  and then it might be a month might be three months till we get more because it's
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:45.200]  so hard to secure the true organic methylcobalamin
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:51.200]  that is the organic uh vegan type that is so absorbable compared to
[02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:54.560]  other linguals and sublinguals that is pills you take my mouth or

[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:50.320]  but i've been taking it obviously going into the winter with all these super
[02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:53.200]  bugs and the rest of it because i believe in the evidence shows
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:55.760]  it's going to really give me a leg up against a lot of these
[02:35:55.760 --> 02:35:58.640]  resistant bacteria and the rest of it that's what i'm personally doing what
[02:35:58.640 --> 02:36:02.240]  my family's doing when i couldn't get rid of stuff with

[02:36:10.320 --> 02:36:13.680]  saying you should do that consult your physician uh too much silver you know
[02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:16.480]  if you drank like five bottles a week for a couple years your nose might turn
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:19.120]  blue i mean i'm not kidding i mean it's it's it's
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:22.480]  serious business though and people have done this for thousands of years
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:26.400]  silver bullet at current sales rates it'll be gone in a week

[02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:01.280]  story but bear with me um i was approached by two people
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:04.320]  in a very suspicious way i had my registered pistol on me
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:07.760]  i didn't pull it out anything like that i could i got the feeling like they were
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:10.960]  going to mug me and i talked them down basically
[02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:15.760]  didn't even show that i had a pistol and we both went on our ways
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:19.680]  in the next day two police officers in the city where i live
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:23.840]  confiscated my pistol from me violated my second fourth amendment rights

[02:45:36.160 --> 02:45:39.120]  see it's nothing wrong with making music just like it's nothing wrong with
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:43.040]  being a correctional officer if that's what you did
[02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:46.480]  but so many of our friends who look up to you

[02:46:00.560 --> 02:46:04.400]  that they're gonna wind up in prison with prison sentences
[02:46:04.400 --> 02:46:09.920]  three and four times what they should be because this war on drugs is no joke
[02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:14.320]  i have 10 or 11 friends still in prison right now
[02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:18.000]  with life sentences including one that you even you know

[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:58.480]  hip-hop to prison pipeline let's make it happen right now today
[02:46:58.480 --> 02:47:01.920]  let's do it and not just you the whole hip-hop community
[02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:05.040]  i'm asking all of you let's all of us come together
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:10.640]  let's change these laws right now and in this senseless war on drugs
[02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:15.440]  a lot of times we go through life and uh
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:20.240]  we start to believe that the things that we are experiencing in our life and the
[02:47:20.240 --> 02:47:24.960]  things that we see in our communities or the only way it is
[02:47:24.960 --> 02:47:29.040]  like this the way it is this the way it's supposed to be
[02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:33.520]  and when you start to think like that you can get trapped in a box
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:37.360]  hip-hop is taking over the world if we can take hip-hop back
[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:41.520]  we can change the whole planet we can bring real peace
[02:47:41.520 --> 02:47:47.920]  and no more war let's be pioneers let's be talked about forever
[02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:52.320]  for how we change the way society thinks about each other
[02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:56.160]  it don't have to always be a war on drugs if we can educate ourselves to
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:47:59.840]  where our kids and our brothers and our
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:03.680]  sisters and our mothers and our fathers look at drugs the way we look at
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:07.200]  rat poison you know we just don't go around using rat poison and
[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:10.560]  other chemicals that's that's harmful to our body
[02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:14.400]  if we teach our people how to not use drugs the same way
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:18.240]  then eventually we don't have to wear a bottom using drugs
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:22.400]  now you may never have heard of some of these stars but your kids have
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:26.800]  their heroes to a whole new generation now they take these guys and these guys
[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:30.960]  say well I got to the position that I'm in
[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:35.440]  right now today by selling drugs so the message that it tells our kids
[02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:40.960]  is that if you go out you sell drugs then you can become a great rock star
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:45.520]  like myself and never go to prison and I think
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:49.840]  that that's a false message to be given people who feel
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:54.080]  hopeless I'm letting you know right now
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:49:00.240]  that the establishment is using hip hop to prime these kids
[02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:03.920]  for a life that's going to send them to prison just like they did with me
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:08.480]  see when I was coming up there was superfly tequila sunrise
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:13.680]  squadface all these movies to make you think that you could
[02:49:13.680 --> 02:49:16.960]  start with nothing and then you could have the whole
[02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:20.560]  world at the palm of your hand
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:24.240]  only that there was no part of gold at the end of the rainbow
[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:28.880]  was a set of handcuffs and shackles and you want to know why the CIA
[02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:32.320]  similar was behind me because they were the guys behind me
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:36.240]  when I was selling drugs and now they're behind
[02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:40.800]  hip hop and rock and roll this prison
[02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:45.360]  hip hop connection they're behind that too
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:48.320]  if it was if it was good for them to sell drugs and it should have been good
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:52.000]  for me to sell drugs the money from the drugs went to buy
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:56.160]  guns for the country even if you don't read my book
[02:49:56.160 --> 02:50:01.440]  warn your kids let them know but I advise you that this book is worth
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:03.680]  reading definitely for your kids even if you
[02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:06.960]  don't read it get it for your kids get it for your loved ones
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:10.000]  let them see what the drug culture is all about
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:15.120]  it's not manufactured like the stuff you see on tv and you hear in music
[02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:20.560]  this is real life it's your life your loved ones life
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:23.760]  let's make a difference you know where to find me

[02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:38.800]  for the wrongs that I've done and I feel that the way
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:42.400]  that I can redeem myself the best is by helping others
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:47.040]  not falling the same footsteps that I fell in
[02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:51.680]  because I believe that it's a trap it's a trap to catch you
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:55.760]  yeah just because you're doing bad
[02:50:55.760 --> 02:50:59.440]  and you're looking for a way to make an income there's people that are taking
[02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:04.640]  freedom forever and ever don't make the
[02:51:04.640 --> 02:51:08.560]  same mistake I made don't get caught up
[02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:13.760]  it's time for us to wake up and face it get the truth
[02:51:13.760 --> 02:51:16.400]  and you're done
[02:51:19.360 --> 02:51:23.200]  well that's an extremely powerful little seven eight minute investigative
[02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:26.560]  report it's powerful audibly if you're a radio
[02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:29.520]  listener it's very powerful the video him speaking to
[02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:32.960]  high school and college students just while he was here in texas
[02:51:32.960 --> 02:51:38.320]  josh owens shot all those pieces with with with rob do helping some
[02:51:38.320 --> 02:51:41.840]  and traveled around texas for four or five days with rick ross
[02:51:41.840 --> 02:51:45.920]  josh owens has been here less than a year now from the carolinas and is just
[02:51:45.920 --> 02:51:49.040]  doing a fabulous job there's so many people behind the scenes here in
[02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:51.760]  infowars like josh owens who's been shot at by the
[02:51:51.760 --> 02:51:56.400]  rubber bullets and Bennett the whole standoff with the bundies I mean
[02:51:56.400 --> 02:51:59.760]  our reporters really are like wartime reporters now
[02:51:59.760 --> 02:52:04.400]  and our camera people this is not a joke this is not a game
[02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:08.400]  um when I used to go out in the field a lot more than I do now
[02:52:08.400 --> 02:52:11.360]  because I have to literally be here and make the decisions and run things like
[02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:14.000]  a general doesn't mean I didn't spend years out
[02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:17.520]  there as a private right up through a sergeant you know right up to
[02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:21.120]  general basically in the info war in our own sector
[02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:25.440]  um the reason I don't go out in public a lot is there's no amount of security
[02:52:25.440 --> 02:52:30.000]  folks that will stop the stuff they've already tried
[02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:33.760]  I don't want to be dramatic here but it's real it's real bad
[02:52:33.760 --> 02:52:37.200]  anybody wants to wonder what's really going on or how real this is
[02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:42.240]  believe me it's real believe me and that's another reason
[02:52:42.240 --> 02:52:46.320]  that I know that there's a mix of people in the system
[02:52:46.320 --> 02:52:49.920]  the eagles not just in the government or not just in the corporations it's in us
[02:52:49.920 --> 02:52:53.680]  just like the goods there and I know for a fact some of our best
[02:52:53.680 --> 02:52:57.760]  intel's come from the FBI from federal marshals from state police
[02:52:57.760 --> 02:53:01.360]  from the austin police department uh who has
[02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:05.760]  just like a guardian angel repeatedly a lot of reason telling me about it
[02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:09.600]  kept the watch and like kept people from killing me
[02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:14.160]  and so long before that I even knew about all that I grew up more and
[02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:17.920]  realized that it's not just black and white
[02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:22.720]  when it comes to large institutions it's black and white when it comes to
[02:53:22.720 --> 02:53:26.080]  communism being absolutely horrible or the second amendment being key to
[02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:29.440]  freedom or family being key or vaccines you can't trust
[02:53:29.440 --> 02:53:33.200]  them but when it comes to just saying black people are all gang banging
[02:53:33.200 --> 02:53:38.000]  criminals or cops are all scum or it's it's it's all about dividing us and
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:41.760]  it's coming together with good wholesome messages
[02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:44.640]  that are truthful you're not going to keep people off drugs telling them that
[02:53:44.640 --> 02:53:48.400]  will kill you the first time you try to you know you teach them hey
[02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:52.320]  it's being shipped in by foreign banks that run the government at the top
[02:53:52.320 --> 02:53:56.560]  they're doing it to make slavery legal in the modern time
[02:53:56.560 --> 02:54:01.200]  don't be part of it but see instead the media can manipulate the inner city
[02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:05.840]  as its practice ground and have folks burn down their own neighborhood
[02:54:05.840 --> 02:54:10.720]  and it's sad it doesn't make me feel good to be able to look at a group of
[02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:14.320]  people who've been manipulated and watch them fall down
[02:54:14.320 --> 02:54:17.440]  and then feel good about myself that I'm not part of that quote group I'm a
[02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:21.120]  human being I'm part of that group that's why folks are always sending me
[02:54:21.120 --> 02:54:24.720]  anti-semitic stuff and saying they want to you know kill me and I'm
[02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:28.400]  Jewish and all this stuff I go you know what I am Jewish
[02:54:28.400 --> 02:54:32.560]  you bet I'm Jewish you bet I am of course I'm not Jewish
[02:54:32.560 --> 02:54:34.960]  but you know what you want to use that as a slang
[02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:38.000]  as some kind of evil thing it because I'm not anti-semitic
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:41.200]  like that makes you better than me because you just want to call me a
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:44.960]  you know a you know you know I take it as a
[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:51.600]  I take it I take it as a badge of honor that I'm more attacked by white
[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:55.440]  supremacist than anybody in the world when you
[02:54:55.440 --> 02:54:58.720]  go online you can see the aggregates on google searches
[02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:02.880]  it's alex jones who do you think runs the groups that are putting out the k word
[02:55:02.880 --> 02:55:06.160]  and the n word in the division it's the tiny
[02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:10.160]  globalists that want to play everybody off against each other
[02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:13.200]  so that they can get us all wanting peace so bad
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:17.280]  that we'll let them ban the n word or ban the k word
[02:55:17.280 --> 02:55:21.200]  and then once they ban those words they can ban the word mom or dad
[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:24.080]  and you're like what are you not going to ban that they're already in europe and
[02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:26.400]  the u.s banning it in government documents
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:29.920]  they're already banning brown bags in seattle don't say brown bag it's racist
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:33.040]  brown bag brown bag brown bag it's not words that are evil
[02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:36.640]  it's how they're used
[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:41.440]  show the fact that a bunch of globalists run white supremacists want me dead
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:46.080]  badge of honor the fact that uh the adl that protects
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:49.680]  real nazis like george soros hates me and lies about me badge of
[02:55:49.680 --> 02:55:52.880]  courage she because i just tell the truth
[02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:57.680]  my job isn't hard israel attacks the uss liberty trying to sink the ship
[02:55:57.680 --> 02:56:02.240]  to blame it on egypt i expose the false flag because israel isn't a sacred cow
[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:06.880]  israel's arrogant like all these other governments
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:10.800]  why do you think i have the saudi arabian government talking trash about me
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:14.560]  they got their people creeping around here because we're having an effect
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:17.520]  ladies and gentlemen we know what's going on we're
[02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:20.640]  accurate we really are telling people the truth
[02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:23.200]  as close to it as you're going to get because i promise i don't have all the
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:25.520]  answers
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:30.160]  i didn't mean to go off on a whole jag it's just that i can't sit back
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:34.800]  and feel good about 52 of black people never being born
[02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:39.600]  i can't sit back about mexican girls being forcibly inoculated with garter
[02:56:39.600 --> 02:56:41.840]  cell that's known to basically reduce their fertility
[02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:47.920]  and give them autoimmune disorders even if the giant hordes of uneducated
[02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:52.080]  people are being used as dumbed down political weapons against me and my
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:56.480]  family even though maybe 30 percent of black people are raving racist
[02:56:56.480 --> 02:57:00.080]  in my experience and absolutely would slip my throat if they could get away
[02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:02.720]  with it i won't sit there and say good kill all their
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:07.840]  babies before they get out of them because i will not sign on to dehumanization
[02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:13.760]  and that's not being a hero ladies and gentlemen that is common sense
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:18.160]  if you won't stand up for justice across the board
[02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:21.520]  regardless of what color somebody is or what their religion is
[02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:25.120]  you're not going to get justice when it comes time for you to get it
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:28.160]  and that's what i'm telling the police out there in these corrupt cities
[02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:31.360]  corrupt counties you thinking you're good old boy network
[02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:34.720]  you're you're going to get away with doing bad things to people and it's not

[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:18.640]  well alex you do tend to underestimate the assessment of the situation sometimes
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:21.360]  and i know i called about the new black panther party but
[03:01:21.360 --> 03:01:26.000]  on hold you mentioned uh that the fluoride negatively impacts blacks and
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:30.000]  it's actually about five to six times worse than whites and about three times
[03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:34.320]  for mexican-americans i know i know i was going with a very conservative estimate
[03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:38.000]  you're right sure and that's the cdc in darbeth college so yeah you
[03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:41.280]  you know just keep on showing your concern for the black community
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:45.280]  like a reverend alvita king and uh and uh
[03:01:45.280 --> 03:01:48.320]  the who's the daughter of dr martin luther king jr and his niece
[03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:53.120]  um our uh his his daughter is bernice and his uh niece is alvita who say
[03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:56.640]  water fluoridation is a civil right that's right st louis county is being
[03:01:56.640 --> 03:02:00.400]  fluoridated that's right we've had her on the show you're right
[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:05.280]  great um and uh you know because it causes more criminality due to
[03:02:05.280 --> 03:02:10.160]  higher lead uptake and uh sincere black leaders would be covering these kinds of
[03:02:10.160 --> 03:02:12.240]  things that you know it makes you mentally ill and
[03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:16.560]  aggressive just like we saw mr brown acting
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:20.480]  indeed and uh yeah we we should do a hair mineral analysis and see what the
[03:02:20.480 --> 03:02:24.720]  deal is with that now as for the new black panther party uh go to the obama
[03:02:24.720 --> 03:02:30.160]  file dot com and in the search bar enter shabazz sh a b a z z
[03:02:30.160 --> 03:02:32.800]  that's the national director of the new black panther party
[03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:36.960]  and you'll see back uh in 2007 and selma alabama
[03:02:36.960 --> 03:02:40.400]  he made a campaign stop uh supporting senator obama
[03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:44.720]  and you can see the photos with a uniform from bright barts uh with um
[03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:47.680]  another uniform black uh new black panther party
[03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:51.280]  member along with uh malik zulu shabazz and in 2008
[03:02:51.280 --> 03:02:55.440]  on obama's own website he thanked the endorsement from the new black panther
[03:02:55.440 --> 03:02:59.600]  party and um it's really amazing that they won't
[03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:02.320]  even uh they'll give out the white house
[03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:06.560]  login sheet to say whether the malik shabazz who visited the white house
[03:03:06.560 --> 03:03:10.640]  several times is the same as malik zulu shabazz the national
[03:03:10.640 --> 03:03:15.600]  director of the new pinco pansy party um now we have michelle williams if you
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:20.960]  remember called for a bounty on george simmerman just as uh a bounty has been
[03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:25.520]  called for on darren wilson and uh michelle williams of the former
[03:03:25.520 --> 03:03:29.120]  chief of staff for the tampa new black panther party
[03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:34.000]  locally here on a community sponsored radio station it's actually only about
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:38.640]  70 community sponsored it turns out called a w m and f they've been trying
[03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:43.200]  to rehabilitate for michelle williams reputation over the years
[03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:47.280]  and well that's the big telltale sign that all these socialists and comic ribs
[03:03:47.280 --> 03:03:50.320]  are trying to get stuff going nationwide over this
[03:03:50.320 --> 03:03:53.360]  because they're trying to prop up socialism you know it hadn't worked
[03:03:53.360 --> 03:03:57.120]  so they want to make it now just racially based so folks still support
[03:03:57.120 --> 03:04:01.920]  their failed ideas i mean it is really a cold-blooded thing they're doing
[03:04:01.920 --> 03:04:05.680]  indeed and several at least five of the different radio personalities i called
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:08.960]  for the comment i asked them to condemn michelle williams
[03:04:08.960 --> 03:04:12.880]  inciting a riot which is the type of behavior that only an informant the
[03:04:12.880 --> 03:04:16.640]  taxpayer funded informants could get away with exactly if you or i did that we'd
[03:04:16.640 --> 03:04:22.640]  be arrested rightfully so why are these people allowed to criminally provocateur
[03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:26.880]  well because obviously the answer is as a friend of mine took the approach of
[03:04:26.880 --> 03:04:30.720]  directly asking them that are you have you or have you ever worked for the fbi
[03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:35.840]  and my frank my friend frank did that and since then she was actually burned as
[03:04:35.840 --> 03:04:38.720]  will happen of course to the informants who do not
[03:04:38.720 --> 03:04:42.640]  come clean with her secret identities she's serving 15 years
[03:04:42.640 --> 03:04:47.360]  of probation for attempting to sell a house that did not belong to her well
[03:04:47.360 --> 03:04:50.320]  that's right all you informants that they will
[03:04:50.320 --> 03:04:55.360]  always burn you in the end of your involvement dirty stuff we'll be back
[03:04:55.360 --> 03:04:58.880]  you pick up the receiver with your heart racing and sweat dripping from your
[03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:02.160]  forehead you finally muster the courage to dial the number to call into your

[03:08:43.040 --> 03:08:46.480]  every day if we wanted it we had that for a couple years i should have used it
[03:08:46.480 --> 03:08:50.480]  more wisely well we are now taking over the
[03:08:50.480 --> 03:08:53.040]  hashtag rick ross in fact we already took over

[03:08:59.520 --> 03:09:04.000]  hashtag rick ross so tweet with hashtag rick ross the video
[03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:10.800]  that said real alex jones it is key to get this out to everybody
[03:09:10.800 --> 03:09:18.080]  it is absolutely uh essential that folks send that video out
[03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:23.280]  to their friends and to their family now we're going to have overdrive for the
[03:09:23.280 --> 03:09:26.240]  rest of the hour taking phone calls i'm leaving at the next segment

[03:09:42.320 --> 03:09:46.240]  challenge hashtag rick ross i know most of our audience
[03:09:46.240 --> 03:09:49.520]  isn't into the twitter thing we're trying to reach
[03:09:49.520 --> 03:09:53.680]  the young people the folks that are under this mind control under this bondage
[03:09:53.680 --> 03:09:57.760]  and we're successful doing it through these systems
[03:09:57.760 --> 03:10:01.360]  let's go ahead now and go to boris in arizona
[03:10:01.360 --> 03:10:07.360]  here on the air welcome previous comrade alexander the uh the very essence
[03:10:07.360 --> 03:10:11.840]  of focus and as a giant paradox you have peaceful protesters being
[03:10:11.840 --> 03:10:15.840]  harassed and bugged uh while looters and armed thugs are free to do what they
[03:10:15.840 --> 03:10:20.080]  want at their own absurd will uh incidentally you have eric holder and
[03:10:20.080 --> 03:10:24.720]  other demons provoking ferguson this is all very very reminiscent of the
[03:10:24.720 --> 03:10:28.880]  western beck kev riots tie this in with dui checkpoints
[03:10:28.880 --> 03:10:32.400]  free speech zones pat down to the airport border patrol internal
[03:10:32.400 --> 03:10:36.080]  checkpoints uh i guess the question is will the inevitable
[03:10:36.080 --> 03:10:39.040]  take place but don't you worry don't you worry alex
[03:10:39.040 --> 03:10:44.160]  because the stars will be right back i can't even decipher the malarkey anymore
[03:10:44.160 --> 03:10:47.440]  but i guess truth is greater than six and
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:51.120]  man we've had the best callers today all of you guys and gals are like poets or
[03:10:51.120 --> 03:10:54.320]  something that we've almost exclusively had men call today maybe we should have
[03:10:54.320 --> 03:10:57.360]  some women calling some days it's all women some days all men some days a
[03:10:57.360 --> 03:11:02.560]  mix 800 25 9 9 2 3 1 undoubtedly this is a
[03:11:02.560 --> 03:11:07.040]  sigh of undoubtedly there is a lot of manipulation
[03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:10.880]  i think because government even if something organically happens
[03:11:10.880 --> 03:11:14.160]  artificially tries to spend things in their direction
[03:11:14.160 --> 03:11:18.080]  what is that direction more militarization more federalization
[03:11:18.080 --> 03:11:21.920]  more division more balkanization what else do you think's going on here a
[03:11:21.920 --> 03:11:26.000]  smokescreen from all the amnesty a smokescreen from obama care
[03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:30.320]  and it gets obama supporters back only thinking race
[03:11:30.320 --> 03:11:33.680]  instead of about how we're all being collectively screwed over
[03:11:33.680 --> 03:11:38.480]  yeah you do make a very good cognizant points balkanization at its finest
[03:11:38.480 --> 03:11:42.560]  i guess you you've asked a couple times what you think the end game is
[03:11:42.560 --> 03:11:45.600]  in my subjective viewpoint i see the further
[03:11:45.600 --> 03:11:50.560]  furtherization of the police state new litigation to strip more civil liberties
[03:11:50.560 --> 03:11:55.600]  under the false pretentive of safety and i pray to god that you know plays out to
[03:11:55.600 --> 03:12:00.400]  the contrary but evidently that's the way it looks like it's going so
[03:12:00.400 --> 03:12:04.640]  i guess time will time will tell but god bless you sir great points good to
[03:12:04.640 --> 03:12:07.360]  hear from you one more article before i go back to calls
[03:12:07.360 --> 03:12:12.160]  school expels eight-year-old whose mother refused to give her vaccine
[03:12:12.160 --> 03:12:18.560]  family doctor deemed unsafe this is in long island now so schools and in
[03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:21.360]  hospitals even when there's no law to take it
[03:12:21.360 --> 03:12:25.040]  will now expel you and not give you the waiver form
[03:12:25.040 --> 03:12:29.600]  this is because their whole vaccine system is collapsing people know
[03:12:29.600 --> 03:12:32.320]  there's a video report i want to get this girl's family on
[03:12:32.320 --> 03:12:36.240]  guys please try to get her a showdown over vaccinations is erupted in a long
[03:12:36.240 --> 03:12:39.200]  island town after the mother of an eight-year-old was
[03:12:39.200 --> 03:12:44.560]  told by her doctor that a new school district rule requires children to get
[03:12:44.560 --> 03:12:50.000]  a booster shot at two young an age
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:53.040]  see doctors now are kind of creeping away from vaccines they realize that
[03:12:53.040 --> 03:12:56.720]  evidence is overwhelming so it's like oh don't don't take too many or back off
[03:12:56.720 --> 03:13:01.760]  or go slower because they've doubled and then tripled the amount of vaccines
[03:13:01.760 --> 03:13:08.720]  that people used to take in the 50s and 60s so the problems are overwhelming
[03:13:08.720 --> 03:13:12.960]  so the school said we have a rule like you can't play with a nerf gun in your
[03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:16.000]  own backyard if your neighbor sees we're going to expel you
[03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:20.160]  well you don't have any say over what you do at your house and a nerf gun
[03:13:20.160 --> 03:13:23.920]  see it's all social engineering
[03:13:24.560 --> 03:13:28.320]  and obviously they're not even telling them that there's a waiver i guarantee
[03:13:28.320 --> 03:13:31.440]  you they're telling them it's the law and that
[03:13:31.440 --> 03:13:34.640]  the and and not telling them there's a waiver it's not even a law
[03:13:34.640 --> 03:13:38.480]  it's state health department policy through the department of health at
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:41.280]  the federal level down to the state to the county
[03:13:41.280 --> 03:13:45.280]  that it's policy rule that you take this see when rick perry said
[03:13:45.280 --> 03:13:48.880]  it's the law you got to take Gardasil
[03:13:49.680 --> 03:13:56.400]  and i said no it's not the law he put it on the list of recommended vaccines
[03:13:56.400 --> 03:14:01.440]  under school policy in the state of texas and it took people months to believe me
[03:14:01.440 --> 03:14:04.080]  we were the spearhead of that i'm proud of the fact we exposed it
[03:14:04.080 --> 03:14:06.960]  going i'm telling you here's the law here's the waivers
[03:14:06.960 --> 03:14:09.760]  the law says you don't have to have a waiver it's just that the school
[03:14:09.760 --> 03:14:15.440]  wants it for the health department the blah blah blah
[03:14:15.440 --> 03:14:20.160]  people are like no the governor would lie it's the law
[03:14:20.160 --> 03:14:23.760]  see by having a governor do that it had such authority people went man
[03:14:23.760 --> 03:14:27.200]  alex you got to be he wouldn't dare lie see
[03:14:27.200 --> 03:14:31.360]  but the bigger the lie the harder it is to bring it down but when you do
[03:14:31.360 --> 03:14:34.560]  the harder it falls and then it crushes a bunch of other lies
[03:14:34.560 --> 03:14:38.560]  around it like a meteor out of space crushing what it hits
[03:14:38.560 --> 03:14:43.360]  leaving a crater well you talk to libertarians and conservatives why do
[03:14:43.360 --> 03:14:47.040]  you not like rick perry because of his vaccine stuff
[03:14:47.040 --> 03:14:50.080]  and rick perry has come out and said i apologize i should have handled that
[03:14:50.080 --> 03:14:52.240]  better that's not perfect but at least it's
[03:14:52.240 --> 03:14:57.120]  something what about all the dead girls perry

[03:15:19.840 --> 03:15:23.360]  of two weeks ago with the real rick ross i thought that was one of the most
[03:15:23.360 --> 03:15:27.360]  powerful interviews that has i've seen in a long time
[03:15:27.360 --> 03:15:32.240]  well thank you right it was excellent um what's Ferguson i i do want to say
[03:15:32.240 --> 03:15:36.160]  that you know when obama came on yesterday and asked for
[03:15:36.160 --> 03:15:41.360]  quiet and peace and peaceful protest you know who was he speaking to because
[03:15:41.360 --> 03:15:45.680]  you know everyone that was there to protest or riot was already out
[03:15:45.680 --> 03:15:50.720]  on the streets they weren't listening to obama making his speech they could have
[03:15:50.720 --> 03:15:53.760]  cared less it was only meant to make him look like
[03:15:53.760 --> 03:15:56.880]  he's a peacemaker when he's got the justice department in there
[03:15:56.880 --> 03:16:02.720]  and nsnbc winding everybody racially up absolutely i agree and you know i was
[03:16:02.720 --> 03:16:05.680]  watching at two o'clock in the morning when they uh
[03:16:05.680 --> 03:16:09.760]  announced when the chief came on and said you know we didn't have enough people
[03:16:09.760 --> 03:16:13.520]  or resources and he say i think he said something like 10
[03:16:13.520 --> 03:16:18.480]  we need 10 000 people to take care of this bull if they had police
[03:16:18.480 --> 03:16:21.760]  every half block or whatever in body armor
[03:16:21.760 --> 03:16:26.160]  keeping their heads down on rooftops you know have a squad car on the corner
[03:16:26.160 --> 03:16:29.600]  have people on rooftops you see somebody with a gun you just shoot them
[03:16:29.600 --> 03:16:33.360]  i mean you put guys on the roof to sniper rifles and you see somebody out
[03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:37.040]  there shooting the guns at people you kill them and you can have a video
[03:16:37.040 --> 03:16:40.960]  camera on the gun videotape it there's no debating it you release it
[03:16:40.960 --> 03:16:48.240]  why didn't they just go ahead and let uh you know uh the copy at charge just like
[03:16:48.240 --> 03:16:51.520]  the zimmerman deal show that it would come out
[03:16:51.520 --> 03:16:54.480]  show that it would show all the evidence why did they sit on it from the
[03:16:54.480 --> 03:16:57.040]  beginning when they knew they had all these witnesses
[03:16:57.040 --> 03:17:00.560]  see i'm telling you man this whole thing stinks to high heaven
[03:17:00.560 --> 03:17:06.240]  anything else rick i just believe that this has all been staged and you know
[03:17:06.240 --> 03:17:10.720]  anyone that that believes that this is anything more than a
[03:17:10.720 --> 03:17:15.280]  show of the federal government taking over our rights
[03:17:15.280 --> 03:17:18.880]  and policing us to a point where we no longer
[03:17:18.880 --> 03:17:23.520]  can even believe in anything that they have to say or do
[03:17:23.520 --> 03:17:27.440]  is you know you deserve it if you believe this stuff because
[03:17:27.440 --> 03:17:32.800]  this is absolutely insane i've never seen anything like this before my life

[03:17:46.960 --> 03:17:51.040]  protest going on and there was a picture in dc
[03:17:51.040 --> 03:17:54.240]  and i always thought i have it of looking at the bottom of the protesters
[03:17:54.240 --> 03:17:59.040]  sign to see who their sponsor is well this one group in dc
[03:17:59.040 --> 03:18:03.040]  the sponsor was answer coalition dot org yeah
[03:18:03.040 --> 03:18:07.440]  so i pull it up and um at the bottom of the page it says find a
[03:18:07.440 --> 03:18:11.280]  demonstration here and it also says be sure to
[03:18:11.280 --> 03:18:14.800]  circulate this important appeal by veterans to members of the
[03:18:14.800 --> 03:18:18.400]  missouri national guard calling on them to stand with
[03:18:18.400 --> 03:18:24.240]  furgus and protesters not the police so when you click on the link to find a
[03:18:24.240 --> 03:18:30.080]  protest it takes you to another page called march forward dot org

[03:18:40.560 --> 03:18:44.320]  that seem to be anti imperialist um
[03:18:44.320 --> 03:18:48.160]  anti yeah how do you think the weathermen ended up recruiting
[03:18:48.160 --> 03:18:52.320]  uh graph wall because he was of green beret that's who they always want to
[03:18:52.320 --> 03:18:57.120]  get and if you look at these groups the signs are
[03:18:57.120 --> 03:19:01.600]  communist and socialist groups that are trying to get this going i mean this
[03:19:01.600 --> 03:19:05.600]  i'm telling you obama is trying to test and see if he can use this like trayvon

[03:19:18.560 --> 03:19:21.760]  then use the police or they may actually overthrow the system

[03:24:09.920 --> 03:24:14.480]  wanted to get your response so i'm gonna continue this through the rest of the hour
[03:24:14.480 --> 03:24:19.440]  before i do i i just want to say that what we should be having right now
[03:24:19.440 --> 03:24:24.560]  is a national conversation on excessive police violence we've been covering this
[03:24:24.560 --> 03:24:29.200]  over and over and over again and yet they've deliberately manipulated this
[03:24:29.200 --> 03:24:33.920]  into a conversation that is strictly going to be about racism
[03:24:33.920 --> 03:24:37.440]  that's what's happening right now when you look at what they did last night
[03:24:37.440 --> 03:24:41.440]  remember that when these riots initially happened in the aftermath of the
[03:24:41.440 --> 03:24:44.560]  shooting and i think the thing that viscerally set everybody off about this
[03:24:44.560 --> 03:24:47.440]  was leaving the body in the street for so long
[03:24:47.440 --> 03:24:50.800]  unattended uh make it look as as though they had
[03:24:50.800 --> 03:24:56.480]  absolute contempt for uh michael brown but remember that when they were having
[03:24:56.480 --> 03:25:00.560]  these uh protests these demonstrations uh violence when our
[03:25:00.560 --> 03:25:04.800]  reporters are there the first time they told everybody protest all you want
[03:25:04.800 --> 03:25:10.560]  but don't be here after dark they knew that was when the riots were always
[03:25:10.560 --> 03:25:14.320]  taking place at precisely the time they released
[03:25:14.320 --> 03:25:18.400]  this this was calculated to incite violence
[03:25:18.400 --> 03:25:22.480]  we had a an indictment decision early in the day
[03:25:22.480 --> 03:25:25.280]  we had it at one o'clock they had told the schools
[03:25:25.280 --> 03:25:29.360]  in the past uh when they first started this long drawn out grand jury procedure
[03:25:29.360 --> 03:25:33.840]  they'd told the schools we will notify you if it's a weekday within three hours
[03:25:33.840 --> 03:25:36.560]  of the grand jury will give you three hours notification so you can make
[03:25:36.560 --> 03:25:39.360]  preparations at the schools well of course they cancel the schools
[03:25:39.360 --> 03:25:46.160]  this week nevertheless they waited seven or more hours before they released this
[03:25:46.160 --> 03:25:50.400]  waited until eight p.m when it was as early as possible
[03:25:50.400 --> 03:25:54.400]  yet totally dark that's what they wanted to do they engineered this
[03:25:54.400 --> 03:25:58.560]  let's go to your comments uh jason in texas you're up next go ahead
[03:25:58.560 --> 03:26:02.080]  hey david thanks for taking my call sure go ahead what's on your mind i had a
[03:26:02.080 --> 03:26:05.120]  quick question uh not really a question but a comment
[03:26:05.120 --> 03:26:09.200]  um i read in the i think it was the free beak in a couple days ago
[03:26:09.200 --> 03:26:12.400]  that obama had called for some sort of civil air
[03:26:12.400 --> 03:26:19.120]  patrol to buzz the white house i think it was between the hours of 12 and 2
[03:26:19.120 --> 03:26:25.040]  my thought is is was he doing this because of his lack of
[03:26:25.040 --> 03:26:31.040]  um he didn't really believe in his uh security on the ground
[03:26:31.040 --> 03:26:34.880]  and for seeing this uh michael brown verdict coming out and
[03:26:34.880 --> 03:26:37.680]  and the protesters gathering in washington
[03:26:37.680 --> 03:26:41.120]  was this kind of a safety blank that he was trying to put into place just in
[03:26:41.120 --> 03:26:44.320]  case people were trying to scale fences so to speak
[03:26:44.320 --> 03:26:48.080]  well i don't know i haven't seen that report and quite frankly i don't think
[03:26:48.080 --> 03:26:51.520]  obama is worried about this uh not working you know
[03:26:51.520 --> 03:26:56.240]  about taking some heat for this he wants this i think they stretch this thing
[03:26:56.240 --> 03:26:59.680]  out for incredibly incredibly long period of time this
[03:26:59.680 --> 03:27:03.280]  prosecutor who is a democrat i think stretch this thing out because they
[03:27:03.280 --> 03:27:06.480]  have been trying to play the race card for this election all along
[03:27:06.480 --> 03:27:09.760]  they knew they were going to take a beating nobody was happy with obama's
[03:27:09.760 --> 03:27:13.280]  policies the only thing they had going was exactly
[03:27:13.280 --> 03:27:16.640]  what uh landrew uh who was running for re-election
[03:27:16.640 --> 03:27:20.640]  the senator or the female senator in louisiana said they don't like women
[03:27:20.640 --> 03:27:24.080]  and they don't like blacks that's why they're angry at me and and obama they
[03:27:24.080 --> 03:27:28.080]  elected we elected obama twice she got elected three times
[03:27:28.080 --> 03:27:31.360]  they're trying to make it about sexism about racism
[03:27:31.360 --> 03:27:34.240]  that's the only thing they can fall back on so i think this
[03:27:34.240 --> 03:27:38.160]  falls perfectly within the plans of things that he would like to see happen
[03:27:38.160 --> 03:27:40.880]  quite frankly they have engineered this they want the
[03:27:40.880 --> 03:27:44.400]  police to believe that this is a war zone more importantly they want the
[03:27:44.400 --> 03:27:48.400]  public to believe that we need to fully militarize
[03:27:48.400 --> 03:27:50.880]  our police this is what they're selling everybody
[03:27:50.880 --> 03:27:54.480]  this is the rules of engagement that they live in a war zone
[03:27:54.480 --> 03:27:57.600]  that they need to shoot first and keep shooting until their gun is empty
[03:27:57.600 --> 03:28:01.840]  that's what they've been training the police in the last few years they have
[03:28:01.840 --> 03:28:04.800]  radically changed the rules of engagement for the police
[03:28:04.800 --> 03:28:09.040]  it is coming from washington and it is a militarization of the police did you
[03:28:09.040 --> 03:28:11.760]  have anything else you wanted to uh comment on
[03:28:11.760 --> 03:28:15.520]  i did i was just going to say if i could comment do you think the
[03:28:15.520 --> 03:28:18.400]  by the military standing down at ferguson and letting
[03:28:18.400 --> 03:28:21.920]  you know the looters and the people that are you know shooting the guns off
[03:28:21.920 --> 03:28:25.680]  are they trying to make a strong case for bcember 24th
[03:28:25.680 --> 03:28:29.600]  with the un small trade treaty uh you know trying to
[03:28:29.600 --> 03:28:33.360]  persuade uh the powers of b to say hey look
[03:28:33.360 --> 03:28:37.360]  you know certainly certainly with everything yeah as one of the callers
[03:28:37.360 --> 03:28:41.280]  earlier pointed out who was uh a longtime fireman you know this this is kind
[03:28:41.280 --> 03:28:45.520]  of a rope a dope you know let's let's stand back let's let them riot we're

[03:28:53.040 --> 03:28:55.920]  everybody take your pictures we'll let that percolate in the media and then
[03:28:55.920 --> 03:28:59.200]  today they come down with an iron fist it's probably what we'll see
[03:28:59.200 --> 03:29:02.880]  happen it's the same strategy they're doing with ebola if you'd look at it
[03:29:02.880 --> 03:29:05.920]  they want ebola to be brought into this country
[03:29:05.920 --> 03:29:09.120]  they don't want to have any quarantine but boy they've got the rules and
[03:29:09.120 --> 03:29:13.120]  regulations to hammer us with a medical tyranny
[03:29:13.120 --> 03:29:17.680]  if this wants this thing gets out of hand they want disorder they want chaos
[03:29:17.680 --> 03:29:20.320]  they want crisis that's the way they grow their government

[03:33:13.120 --> 03:33:16.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night here we're in overdrive
[03:33:16.240 --> 03:33:19.040]  we're taking your calls when to get your reactions to
[03:33:19.040 --> 03:33:25.280]  what's going on in ferguson it's a huge watershed event because there are some
[03:33:25.280 --> 03:33:28.240]  real systemic problems here and of course
[03:33:28.240 --> 03:33:33.120]  racism is an element here it definitely is falling disproportionately
[03:33:33.120 --> 03:33:37.600]  on black people but just like the war on drugs it also falls disproportionately
[03:33:37.600 --> 03:33:42.880]  on black people it affects all of us it destroys our justice system
[03:33:42.880 --> 03:33:46.480]  any of us can be shot dead by the police and they can
[03:33:46.480 --> 03:33:50.080]  essentially get away with it with these different rules of engagement we need to
[03:33:50.080 --> 03:33:53.760]  have outside oversight what you just saw with this
[03:33:53.760 --> 03:33:57.520]  grand jury process the secretive process was not a real trial
[03:33:57.520 --> 03:34:00.720]  there was not a jury there was not openness there was not transparency
[03:34:00.720 --> 03:34:05.360]  usually it is a pro forma process it goes through doesn't take very long
[03:34:05.360 --> 03:34:09.600]  they stretch this something that usually takes less than a day they stretched
[03:34:09.600 --> 03:34:13.440]  into three months or more than three months
[03:34:13.440 --> 03:34:17.520]  this is something that is very unusual it's very unusual for the defendant to
[03:34:17.520 --> 03:34:21.120]  testify at all before a grand jury why because there's no
[03:34:21.120 --> 03:34:26.080]  he cannot have his lawyer there's nobody there but the prosecutor
[03:34:26.080 --> 03:34:30.320]  and so darin wilson the defendant testified he gave over four hours of
[03:34:30.320 --> 03:34:33.840]  testimony very unusual situation it almost makes it look like the
[03:34:33.840 --> 03:34:36.880]  prosecutor doesn't want to prosecute doesn't it
[03:34:36.880 --> 03:34:40.480]  we need to have this conversation yet this because the way this is handled
[03:34:40.480 --> 03:34:45.440]  i believe they have deliberately manipulated this in order to feed racism
[03:34:45.440 --> 03:34:48.960]  we have seen many other cases and we haven't seen the kind of
[03:34:48.960 --> 03:34:52.960]  turnout in blatant clear-cut situations where the
[03:34:52.960 --> 03:35:00.960]  man was killed had absolutely no guilt we had that in the walmart situation
[03:35:00.960 --> 03:35:04.720]  where you had someone call in 911 and say that a guy is waving a gun around a
[03:35:04.720 --> 03:35:08.400]  walmart they show up he's got a BB gun from walmart that he's about to
[03:35:08.400 --> 03:35:11.840]  purchase in one hand and the phone and the other they shoot him dead
[03:35:11.840 --> 03:35:16.000]  yet there's no prosecution no indictment
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:22.320]  against the officer he says we came in responding to what we were told on 911
[03:35:22.320 --> 03:35:26.560]  yet there is nothing done to the guy who made the false call
[03:35:26.560 --> 03:35:30.960]  either we have the video footage showing that he didn't threaten anybody
[03:35:30.960 --> 03:35:34.800]  showing that he was shot before he gave was given an opportunity to
[03:35:34.800 --> 03:35:38.560]  set the toy gun down yet nothing has been done
[03:35:38.560 --> 03:35:42.880]  not even the person who essentially yelled fire in a crowded theater the guy
[03:35:42.880 --> 03:35:46.720]  who made the 911 call no charges have been brought against him either
[03:35:46.720 --> 03:35:51.840]  there are serious problems with this system and it goes far beyond one group
[03:35:51.840 --> 03:35:55.200]  or another we go back to the famous quote from pastor
[03:35:55.200 --> 03:35:58.880]  martin emuler from the the nazi regime he said
[03:35:58.880 --> 03:36:01.440]  they came against this group i didn't do anything came against that group i
[03:36:01.440 --> 03:36:03.840]  didn't do anything because i wasn't a member of those groups and then they
[03:36:03.840 --> 03:36:06.000]  came against me and there was nobody left
[03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:09.600]  that is precisely the situation we see here if we're going to
[03:36:09.600 --> 03:36:13.200]  fall back into this group against that group it's not about that it's not even
[03:36:13.200 --> 03:36:17.520]  about everybody versus the police they're going to fall prey to this as
[03:36:17.520 --> 03:36:20.640]  well now i want to go back to your calls but before we do i
[03:36:20.640 --> 03:36:24.320]  want to let you know this hour is brought to you by the alex jones by the
[03:36:24.320 --> 03:36:29.120]  info warslife.com and we have about a week left of a
[03:36:29.120 --> 03:36:32.000]  silver bullet at the rate that it's going we're going to run out probably a
[03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:35.680]  secret 12 today and it takes a long time to get these
[03:36:35.680 --> 03:36:39.440]  things back in we get them in one batch of time especially
[03:36:39.440 --> 03:36:43.280]  silver bullet it could take us at least six weeks to get that back in
[03:36:43.280 --> 03:36:46.880]  it's very difficult and dangerous to make it in the high concentrations of 30
[03:36:46.880 --> 03:36:50.800]  parts per million that we have here is in a deionized
[03:36:50.800 --> 03:36:54.320]  water base it's free of toxic artificial additives
[03:36:54.320 --> 03:36:57.920]  there's never been a more important time to have a powerful and clean form of
[03:36:57.920 --> 03:37:01.200]  colloidal silver within reach for you and your family
[03:37:01.200 --> 03:37:04.720]  go to infoorslife.com to order your silver bullet now or call
[03:37:04.720 --> 03:37:11.040]  888-253-3139 that's 888-253139 with
[03:37:11.040 --> 03:37:14.640]  coal season upon us and various other things
[03:37:14.640 --> 03:37:18.960]  that you need to be protected against in this time of year it's a great time to
[03:37:18.960 --> 03:37:23.120]  stock up on these things that can help you fight infection things that can
[03:37:23.120 --> 03:37:26.800]  build your immune system so again secret 12 is going to sell out today and
[03:37:26.800 --> 03:37:29.280]  probably at the rate things have been going we're going to be out of silver
[03:37:29.280 --> 03:37:32.080]  bullet within a week and it's going to take us probably at
[03:37:32.080 --> 03:37:35.280]  least six weeks to get that back in let's go to your calls we want to get
[03:37:35.280 --> 03:37:40.880]  your some more of your reactions let's go to uh John in Kentucky John
[03:37:40.880 --> 03:37:44.880]  yes David how you doing doing good what's on your mind
[03:37:44.880 --> 03:37:50.000]  uh yeah i was calling in about calm in on Ferguson i think it really is like a
[03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:54.000]  testing ground of what they're going to you know spread across the rest of the
[03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:56.800]  country because like you were saying earlier they really
[03:37:56.800 --> 03:38:02.320]  haven't had a bigger reaction to this type of situation like they have here
[03:38:02.320 --> 03:38:06.400]  yeah it gives them a chance to uh to use their new toys it gives them a chance to
[03:38:06.400 --> 03:38:10.160]  use their new rules of engagement it gives them a chance to try it out and
[03:38:10.160 --> 03:38:14.640]  we have been a testing ground for their propaganda manipulation through the
[03:38:14.640 --> 03:38:18.880]  press because they have deliberately made this particular case
[03:38:18.880 --> 03:38:24.000]  where you got a situation where probably possibly the officer was justified
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:29.520]  at some level to use a force whether or not it was fully justified i believe
[03:38:29.520 --> 03:38:32.960]  they should have had uh an indictment of uh
[03:38:32.960 --> 03:38:36.720]  of probable cause from the grand jury i think they should have had an open
[03:38:36.720 --> 03:38:40.720]  transparent trial because here's the in here's the system
[03:38:40.720 --> 03:38:44.960]  we have the officer's guilt or innocence is not as important
[03:38:44.960 --> 03:38:48.720]  as the system's guilt or innocence everyone
[03:38:48.720 --> 03:38:52.880]  is rightfully questioning whether or not we have a legitimate system
[03:38:52.880 --> 03:38:55.840]  and we need to see that the system is capable
[03:38:55.840 --> 03:39:00.960]  of opening uh of openly operating and being transparent
[03:39:00.960 --> 03:39:04.640]  and putting all of its cards on the table we should have had a trial we could
[03:39:04.640 --> 03:39:08.560]  have seen the exculpatory evidence brought out little by little people
[03:39:08.560 --> 03:39:11.760]  could have discussed it as it was going along they could have
[03:39:11.760 --> 03:39:15.440]  stood this thing down instead they kept it secret
[03:39:15.440 --> 03:39:19.440]  in a grand jury operation and then when they released it
[03:39:19.440 --> 03:39:23.200]  they released the verdict at 8 p.m calculated
[03:39:23.200 --> 03:39:27.040]  calculated to cause riots i believe this is a deliberate approach do you believe
[03:39:27.040 --> 03:39:30.720]  that was uh what they were trying to do when they did it at eight o'clock
[03:39:30.720 --> 03:39:35.840]  yeah i agree with you there uh i expand our dream with alex on the fact that
[03:39:35.840 --> 03:39:40.400]  they are using like berets or build the
[03:39:40.400 --> 03:39:43.680]  forest or something there because they just don't add up
[03:39:43.680 --> 03:39:47.040]  possibly and another thing i was wanting to
[03:39:47.040 --> 03:39:53.040]  tell you guys about is my like in my small town uh mount sterling kentucky
[03:39:53.040 --> 03:39:56.480]  like it's a pretty small town i mean you know we got lex
[03:39:56.480 --> 03:40:00.080]  everything else around and there ain't there's many people here
[03:40:00.080 --> 03:40:04.000]  but there's been like a lot of uh i think they're about to do something here
[03:40:04.000 --> 03:40:09.440]  because there's a lot of military activity cia vehicles
[03:40:09.440 --> 03:40:12.880]  like numerous other kind of agencies here
[03:40:12.880 --> 03:40:17.120]  and just like weird things been going on too many like
[03:40:17.120 --> 03:40:20.560]  military vehicles and helicopters i can tell you that
[03:40:20.560 --> 03:40:24.960]  you're seeing militarization all over the country and it is really a national
[03:40:24.960 --> 03:40:27.360]  problem as well as i said the the rules of
[03:40:27.360 --> 03:40:30.560]  engagement that we're seeing from the police thank you john uh let's move on
[03:40:30.560 --> 03:40:34.720]  to uh jeremy in michigan jeremy
[03:40:36.720 --> 03:40:41.040]  go ahead jeremy hello yes go ahead oh hey david
[03:40:41.040 --> 03:40:44.480]  yeah i just uh wanted to applaud you for at least
[03:40:44.480 --> 03:40:49.280]  uh mentioning that this some of this has something to do with race
[03:40:49.280 --> 03:40:53.360]  because all i've seen and what's quite frankly appalling
[03:40:53.360 --> 03:40:56.960]  is the level of insensitivity and sensitivity
[03:40:56.960 --> 03:41:00.800]  to the fact that uh black people have been
[03:41:00.800 --> 03:41:04.320]  uh disproportionately incarcerated as well as latinos
[03:41:04.320 --> 03:41:07.760]  oh yeah harassed and beaten by the police and
[03:41:07.760 --> 03:41:12.400]  you know this there's not enough credit given to the organic nature of this
[03:41:12.400 --> 03:41:16.480]  whole protest and this whole outrage what's really not a
[03:41:16.480 --> 03:41:19.680]  protest which is really just rioting and acting crazy
[03:41:19.680 --> 03:41:23.360]  it's because of the fury because a lot of people don't
[03:41:23.360 --> 03:41:26.800]  understand what it's like to be black and discriminated against
[03:41:26.800 --> 03:41:31.120]  and as a black man you know having been discriminated
[03:41:31.120 --> 03:41:35.200]  on plenty of times and every other black person i have known at some point
[03:41:35.200 --> 03:41:39.760]  it's a deep feeling of hurt and rage that comes with it because you just want
[03:41:39.760 --> 03:41:43.360]  to you know be respectful and get along with people and no matter how respectful
[03:41:43.360 --> 03:41:48.240]  you are just as we saw with the cop uh on the east coast side when the guy got
[03:41:48.240 --> 03:41:51.520]  out of his truck just trying to get his license and just gunned down
[03:41:51.520 --> 03:41:54.720]  uh you know it's that kind of thing no matter how respectful you are even
[03:41:54.720 --> 03:41:59.360]  after getting shot calling him sir you still look that as someone
[03:41:59.360 --> 03:42:02.000]  who has it has to be something wrong with it and that's
[03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:05.760]  quite frankly even with alex jones surprisingly enough someone who
[03:42:05.760 --> 03:42:09.840]  i've seen just a year ago protesting uh and and then police
[03:42:09.840 --> 03:42:12.640]  harassing him and he's you know here he goes here i am getting assaulted getting
[03:42:12.640 --> 03:42:17.120]  assaulted yeah he knows exactly you know what well and that's just it it's not
[03:42:17.120 --> 03:42:22.080]  you know certainly as i said before there is a component of racism in this and
[03:42:22.080 --> 03:42:25.200]  you cannot deny that when you see that it is
[03:42:25.200 --> 03:42:30.320]  10 times or 12 times or more uh 80 percent of the people who go to jail and
[03:42:30.320 --> 03:42:34.160]  for marijuana possession actually serve timer black you don't see the same
[03:42:34.160 --> 03:42:38.240]  kinds of conviction rates uh with the rest of the population that you see
[03:42:38.240 --> 03:42:42.320]  with blacks for marijuana for example and of course the the shootings is a
[03:42:42.320 --> 03:42:44.800]  much much higher rate it's so far out of proportion
[03:42:44.800 --> 03:42:49.680]  you have to acknowledge that that's an element of it but if they divide us along
[03:42:49.680 --> 03:42:53.440]  racial lines none of us will be safe that's the way
[03:42:53.440 --> 03:42:57.040]  that we don't get anything changed is that they divide us from that
[03:42:57.040 --> 03:43:01.200]  i cannot even imagine how you as a black man feels by this
[03:43:01.200 --> 03:43:04.160]  i get a little bit of a taste of it when i see people who are here as
[03:43:04.160 --> 03:43:09.200]  illegal aliens essentially getting a pass when they do things in traffic when
[03:43:09.200 --> 03:43:12.320]  they've had people in my family now uh hit twice
[03:43:12.320 --> 03:43:15.520]  and these are illegal aliens and basically they don't even get a ticket
[03:43:15.520 --> 03:43:19.440]  they just tell them to go ahead and go so that infuriates me that's a very
[03:43:19.440 --> 03:43:22.560]  minor thing compared to what's happening to
[03:43:22.560 --> 03:43:26.400]  the black people in this country and you know that is something where people
[03:43:26.400 --> 03:43:29.840]  who are not citizens of this country are getting a preferential treatment we see
[03:43:29.840 --> 03:43:33.360]  it with the welfare uh that they receive coming in as illegal immigrants
[03:43:33.360 --> 03:43:36.320]  we see it with their legal status even on the streets
[03:43:36.320 --> 03:43:39.760]  and that is something where they get and it's not even a racial thing
[03:43:39.760 --> 03:43:44.000]  it's not even a hispanic thing that's a citizen versus non-citizen thing if
[03:43:44.000 --> 03:43:46.960]  you're a white black hispanic citizen
[03:43:46.960 --> 03:43:50.160]  you're not going to get the same kind of treatment as an illegal alien does on
[03:43:50.160 --> 03:43:53.280]  the road so that makes me angry i can only imagine
[03:43:53.280 --> 03:43:56.960]  if uh there's a kind of disproportionate uh
[03:43:56.960 --> 03:44:01.440]  actions with black people and in terms of shootings in terms of incarceration
[03:44:01.440 --> 03:44:05.760]  for the war on drugs but we can't fall into that trap
[03:44:05.760 --> 03:44:09.360]  that's what they want us to do they want to pit one group against the other
[03:44:09.360 --> 03:44:14.320]  we need to take on this system and that's why i said earlier uh Jeremy that
[03:44:14.320 --> 03:44:18.960]  what people needed to see was they needed to see that the system was honest
[03:44:18.960 --> 03:44:23.200]  and i'm not convinced that it was and i think they deliberately kept it hidden
[03:44:23.200 --> 03:44:27.360]  kept it in the dark the entire process then release the verdict in the dark
[03:44:27.360 --> 03:44:31.680]  literally to try to foment this kind of race war and now we see
[03:44:31.680 --> 03:44:35.120]  that's all that people want to talk about is the race aspect of it it was a
[03:44:35.120 --> 03:44:39.360]  black man who was shot in walmart with a BB gun that he was going to buy from
[03:44:39.360 --> 03:44:42.960]  walmart and a phone in his hand that was something where
[03:44:42.960 --> 03:44:46.800]  that was a clear case he was not doing anything wrong we had the videotapes
[03:44:46.800 --> 03:44:50.640]  from the store something needed to be done about that and ask yourself
[03:44:50.640 --> 03:44:54.800]  why we didn't see that many protests there in that area there's a few people
[03:44:54.800 --> 03:44:58.000]  that are protesting it one of the major protests they've had the
[03:44:58.000 --> 03:45:02.000]  student organization protesting that there and outside of Dayton Ohio
[03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:05.360]  uh the second group that was there was open carry
[03:45:05.360 --> 03:45:09.680]  and i saw a video of that and almost all the people in that open carry rally
[03:45:09.680 --> 03:45:13.920]  were white people because they understood that if they could they could get
[03:45:13.920 --> 03:45:18.080]  shot down merely having a gun in their hands the police feel justified because
[03:45:18.080 --> 03:45:22.160]  they don't get indicted shooting a man in a walmart with a BB gun in his hand
[03:45:22.160 --> 03:45:25.840]  they can shoot these guys who have a real gun and it's an open carry state they
[03:45:25.840 --> 03:45:28.720]  can shoot them down in the street if they feel like it all they have to say is
[03:45:28.720 --> 03:45:33.040]  i felt like i was threatened i ultimately have your comment on that
[03:45:33.040 --> 03:45:38.560]  right right and and you never it seemed like it is selective as far as which one
[03:45:38.560 --> 03:45:42.080]  they choose but at the same time it's the incident itself
[03:45:42.080 --> 03:45:46.080]  which causes the outrage and so it has to be one has to be chosen i mean it
[03:45:46.080 --> 03:45:48.560]  doesn't matter me which one because they're all bad
[03:45:48.560 --> 03:45:52.480]  so i mean i don't feel like it's a selective process as far as what they
[03:45:52.480 --> 03:45:56.320]  pick and choose which ones to talk about it and protest about it or
[03:45:56.320 --> 03:46:00.080]  how Sharpton gets up and makes a big deal about because there's so many
[03:46:00.080 --> 03:46:03.840]  instances that it has to start somewhere well yeah but let's go back let's go
[03:46:03.840 --> 03:46:07.040]  back to the walmart okay you had a white officer
[03:46:07.040 --> 03:46:11.680]  who killed this black man in the store who was not doing anything whatsoever
[03:46:11.680 --> 03:46:15.520]  and they go through and they have an indictment i mean we didn't see the
[03:46:15.520 --> 03:46:18.960]  the national mainstream media really talking about this much
[03:46:18.960 --> 03:46:22.640]  you didn't see Eric Holder there you didn't see Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson
[03:46:22.640 --> 03:46:26.080]  there they could have made the same case that he was shot down because it was he
[03:46:26.080 --> 03:46:29.120]  was black and it was a white officer they didn't do it
[03:46:29.120 --> 03:46:32.720]  they picked the case where there was going to be some ambiguity they waited
[03:46:32.720 --> 03:46:35.280]  a long time to talk about the sculpatory evidence
[03:46:35.280 --> 03:46:39.200]  about Darren Wilson they waited a long time to start dribbling that out
[03:46:39.200 --> 03:46:44.720]  then they had for several months they had a a secretive trial and then they
[03:46:44.720 --> 03:46:48.880]  released all of it after dark at the precise time they know people want to
[03:46:48.880 --> 03:46:53.360]  riot this thing is a this was engineered to create
[03:46:53.360 --> 03:46:56.880]  race riots from the very beginning i believe it was not
[03:46:56.880 --> 03:47:00.160]  there to really talk about the real problems of racism or to talk about the
[03:47:00.160 --> 03:47:03.920]  real problems of excessive use of police force
[03:47:03.920 --> 03:47:06.880]  right the whole thing it looks very corrupt and i mean
[03:47:06.880 --> 03:47:11.280]  you could just feel it happening and i and i said when i was watching on tv i
[03:47:11.280 --> 03:47:14.800]  said you know what satan won tonight because when you look all you see is
[03:47:14.800 --> 03:47:19.920]  the images of anarchy and fire yes and it looked as if
[03:47:19.920 --> 03:47:24.160]  it was basically it was it was satan having his way and showing the world
[03:47:24.160 --> 03:47:28.160]  that no matter how much you may want justice or you what you think is right
[03:47:28.160 --> 03:47:31.760]  no matter what side you on tonight is all about anarchy
[03:47:31.760 --> 03:47:34.960]  yes and yes and i feel like a lot of those
[03:47:34.960 --> 03:47:38.640]  i don't like how it's the two-sided media where you got fox news who
[03:47:38.640 --> 03:47:42.160]  who automatically will promote uh you know
[03:47:42.160 --> 03:47:47.200]  george zimmerman or uh darin wilson you have msnbc who will automatically
[03:47:47.200 --> 03:47:51.600]  get on the side of the mike browns and it just it separates people just having
[03:47:51.600 --> 03:47:56.160]  those two stations battling each day and i mean you know if you if you feel like
[03:47:56.160 --> 03:47:58.160]  getting in the right it's the left right paradigm it's the
[03:47:58.160 --> 03:48:01.920]  left right they give you two choices both of which are
[03:48:01.920 --> 03:48:05.280]  controlled from the top and they have those two forces
[03:48:05.280 --> 03:48:08.800]  pick an issue and fight against each other so you can pick one side or the
[03:48:08.800 --> 03:48:11.120]  other they're not going to talk about the real
[03:48:11.120 --> 03:48:14.640]  substantive third issue which is excessive police violence they're going
[03:48:14.640 --> 03:48:17.520]  to if they talk about it at all they'll talk about it in the context
[03:48:17.520 --> 03:48:22.000]  of racism and racism alone uh thank you so much jeremy let's go to i want to
[03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:26.960]  try to get everybody a chance here uh zachary in florida zachary go ahead
[03:48:26.960 --> 03:48:30.880]  hello um yeah i was uh calling about the furgus and ryan
[03:48:30.880 --> 03:48:34.960]  um i think they're actually kind of justified due to the fact that
[03:48:34.960 --> 03:48:39.200]  everybody is so angry everybody is so fed up
[03:48:39.200 --> 03:48:43.520]  at how the government has been treating us and in our constitution it says we
[03:48:43.520 --> 03:48:46.960]  are allowed to dismantle our government if it's not working
[03:48:46.960 --> 03:48:51.280]  which it's not but if we try to dismantle it we're automatically branded as
[03:48:51.280 --> 03:48:55.920]  terrorists or whatever you know what i'm saying i agree i agree let me let me let
[03:48:55.920 --> 03:48:59.760]  me uh kick in there with a different example okay now
[03:48:59.760 --> 03:49:03.280]  as one of the callers was talking about earlier in our live coverage we had uh
[03:49:03.280 --> 03:49:07.120]  joe biggs there last night we had there was a man he was yelling
[03:49:07.120 --> 03:49:11.600]  at the top of his lungs obscenities at the cops and he had a gun on his side
[03:49:11.600 --> 03:49:14.880]  but he was not pointing the gun at them he did not shoot first
[03:49:14.880 --> 03:49:17.840]  he was telling them if you shoot we're going to shoot back
[03:49:17.840 --> 03:49:21.520]  look let me compare this to the bundy ranch because of the bundy ranch they
[03:49:21.520 --> 03:49:26.320]  had a clear objective they did not wait a long time to let the
[03:49:26.320 --> 03:49:30.640]  government get ahead of this thing and they made it clear that they were
[03:49:30.640 --> 03:49:36.320]  willing to take a bullet if necessary to get what they wanted and what they
[03:49:36.320 --> 03:49:40.400]  wanted was for the police to stand down they were sick and tired of seeing
[03:49:40.400 --> 03:49:43.600]  their neighbors brutalized over a period of a couple of weeks
[03:49:43.600 --> 03:49:47.440]  and so you had ranchers come together in defense of that they had an objective
[03:49:47.440 --> 03:49:50.400]  where they could get the cattle back but it was really about
[03:49:50.400 --> 03:49:54.320]  standing up to the police and saying you're not going to do this to us
[03:49:54.320 --> 03:49:58.560]  i saw a a clip of one of the older cowboys who had come over from
[03:49:58.560 --> 03:50:01.840]  arizona uh who was he considered himself to be a
[03:50:01.840 --> 03:50:05.280]  neighbor because the distances there are so great but he said
[03:50:05.280 --> 03:50:09.680]  you're not going to taser a man on a horse we saw you taser
[03:50:09.680 --> 03:50:13.440]  women take them down from behind but you're not going to taser a man
[03:50:13.440 --> 03:50:17.360]  on a thousand pound animal you're going to have to shoot him off you're going to
[03:50:17.360 --> 03:50:20.960]  have to shoot me off of this horse we're not going to stand for this anymore
[03:50:20.960 --> 03:50:24.080]  that's what people need to do they need to stand up they need to do it peacefully
[03:50:24.080 --> 03:50:28.720]  they need to have leaders who are going to stand up and put a legitimate
[03:50:28.720 --> 03:50:32.560]  face on this and that's why we need to work with our people
[03:50:32.560 --> 03:50:37.280]  at the local level at the state level to stand up to this federal tyranny because
[03:50:37.280 --> 03:50:39.840]  that's where these rules of engagement are coming from
[03:50:39.840 --> 03:50:43.280]  it's not that eric holder is going to do anything to stop this
[03:50:43.280 --> 03:50:46.800]  they're the ones who are feeding this kind of rules of engagement
[03:50:46.800 --> 03:50:50.400]  it's coming from washington militarizing the police we'll be right back

[03:54:15.120 --> 03:54:20.640]  as as many people as we can here let's go to Matt in Louisiana Matt
[03:54:20.640 --> 03:54:25.280]  hello Matt are you there yeah hey go ahead
[03:54:25.280 --> 03:54:29.520]  you gotta go quickly my issue on Ferguson uh the whole thing seemed
[03:54:29.520 --> 03:54:33.280]  really strange from you know the time they started this the random bullets I
[03:54:33.280 --> 03:54:38.080]  didn't hear about any victims the time of the fires you know it all seemed kind
[03:54:38.080 --> 03:54:42.640]  of fake and you know like set up yeah I believe so too I think that they've
[03:54:42.640 --> 03:54:46.880]  done everything that they can from the very beginning to exacerbate this to uh
[03:54:46.880 --> 03:54:50.480]  in terms of the timing of when they released evidence that would have
[03:54:50.480 --> 03:54:55.040]  shown that the officer acted at least in some degree to self-defense if not
[03:54:55.040 --> 03:54:58.880]  totally they took a very long time to do that and of course the timing which they
[03:54:58.880 --> 03:55:02.480]  released this was just the icing on the cake to do this at eight o'clock
[03:55:02.480 --> 03:55:05.920]  just amazing to me did you have any other comment
[03:55:05.920 --> 03:55:09.440]  yeah uh you said about the guy in Walmart the reason why I think you know
[03:55:09.440 --> 03:55:13.600]  they don't blow up about you know like that like they did to Ferguson is
[03:55:13.600 --> 03:55:18.080]  because you know the protests and you know all the random
[03:55:18.080 --> 03:55:22.160]  loot in the violent actually makes the police look in a way better
[03:55:22.160 --> 03:55:27.040]  yes for this whole situation and if they would bring it up on like the case in
[03:55:27.040 --> 03:55:30.800]  Walmart of course there's no way that that would make us look bad because
[03:55:30.800 --> 03:55:33.920]  you know absolutely which we have to be smart about how we pick our
[03:55:33.920 --> 03:55:37.600]  battles and we have to be smart about how we fight our battles and to do this
[03:55:37.600 --> 03:55:43.920]  they are basically fighting on their terms and that is making the police
[03:55:43.920 --> 03:55:48.000]  look as if it's necessary to have full-on militarization
[03:55:48.000 --> 03:55:51.680]  that they're the only thing standing between you and race riots when they
[03:55:51.680 --> 03:55:55.360]  have fermented these race riots in my opinion from the very beginning of the
[03:55:55.360 --> 03:55:57.760]  way they released this thank you Matt let's move on quickly
[03:55:57.760 --> 03:56:00.480]  Truth Raider in Oregon you said you had three words to describe this I'm gonna
[03:56:00.480 --> 03:56:03.920]  give you your shot go ahead three words
[03:56:03.920 --> 03:56:08.080]  David have you ever heard of May Brussels a legendary broadcaster back in
[03:56:08.080 --> 03:56:11.840]  the early 1970s through the 1980s no not familiar one
[03:56:11.840 --> 03:56:15.760]  she describes it very best go on you can go online youtube and type in May
[03:56:15.760 --> 03:56:19.520]  Brussels broadcast and she was legendary she was one of those
[03:56:19.520 --> 03:56:23.040]  broadcasts all this material a long time ago three words
[03:56:23.040 --> 03:56:29.760]  that she coined divide and conquer yes yeah that's right
[03:56:29.760 --> 03:56:36.400]  that's right it's about creating a dichotomy here you've got you know
[03:56:36.400 --> 03:56:39.520]  one you've got a thesis and an antithesis right that's what they have
[03:56:39.520 --> 03:56:42.480]  always done that's what the democrats and the republicans are about that's why
[03:56:42.480 --> 03:56:47.360]  they only want to give us two parties so everything has to be broken into these
[03:56:47.360 --> 03:56:50.640]  phony two choices and that's what they're doing right now they're portraying
[03:56:50.640 --> 03:56:54.800]  this as a race war and of course you need bigger
[03:56:54.800 --> 03:56:58.400]  stronger more militarized police departments to protect you from
[03:56:58.400 --> 03:57:01.840]  this race war thank you truth raider let's quickly move on to
[03:57:01.840 --> 03:57:07.360]  josh in virginia josh hey mr knight uh it's honor speak with you my
[03:57:07.360 --> 03:57:10.960]  admirer of your work well thank you um this one the i know we don't have much
[03:57:10.960 --> 03:57:14.240]  time i want to briefly touch on the protests going on around the country
[03:57:14.240 --> 03:57:16.640]  that seem to have been censored so far today
[03:57:16.640 --> 03:57:20.720]  yes we were watching live stream new york city they took over the triboro
[03:57:20.720 --> 03:57:24.640]  bridge and it was citizen journalists right there on the front line
[03:57:24.640 --> 03:57:28.160]  where we were able to watch this just involved all night and then
[03:57:28.160 --> 03:57:31.280]  you know uh the next day my wife has family in new york they knew nothing
[03:57:31.280 --> 03:57:33.280]  about it they weren't reporting on it
[03:57:33.280 --> 03:57:37.360]  they were seen in oakland of uh the protesters in the cops
[03:57:37.360 --> 03:57:41.920]  literally pushing against against one another a very volatile situation
[03:57:41.920 --> 03:57:47.600]  so part of this pha phs exercise i believe is media control once again
[03:57:47.600 --> 03:57:51.360]  because this the paper tiger is starting to be revealed in a
[03:57:51.360 --> 03:57:55.360]  like the previous caller was saying people almost just need a reason now
[03:57:55.360 --> 03:57:59.360]  they're so fed up and a trigger event could happen maybe not now because
[03:57:59.360 --> 03:58:02.560]  again this was all state managed it looks like from the get-go
[03:58:02.560 --> 03:58:05.600]  but if something really were to happen and people were to take to the street
[03:58:05.600 --> 03:58:08.880]  well how it really does lie with the people and you were able to see it
[03:58:08.880 --> 03:58:13.280]  only through the social media that's true that's true thank you josh
[03:58:13.280 --> 03:58:16.560]  yeah there are some links up on drudge about protests that are going on in
[03:58:16.560 --> 03:58:20.080]  other parts of the country and of course it was a grievous shooting this weekend
