[00:00.000 --> 00:11.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:11.960 --> 00:19.520]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.520 --> 00:33.800]  Alex Jones well that socialist kleptocratic sellout to the New World Order
[00:33.800 --> 00:37.960]  John Boner that's how he pronounced his name we're not gonna go into his mind
[00:37.960 --> 00:43.360]  control and call him Bainer anymore as he tells us to has gone off on the right
[00:43.360 --> 00:49.040]  as he calls it he means the House Republican libertarians that don't want
[00:49.040 --> 00:53.280]  fully destroy America and care about their children and grandchildren this is
[00:53.280 --> 00:58.080]  the same Bainer who will not help the House Republicans get rid of Obamacare
[00:58.080 --> 01:03.760]  this is the same Bainer that constantly plays golf with obozo you might as well
[01:03.760 --> 01:09.320]  have Nancy Pelosi replacing and this is the this is the establishment folks
[01:09.320 --> 01:12.600]  they don't just own the Democrats at the leadership level they own the
[01:12.600 --> 01:18.600]  Republicans and remember it was the rhinoceroses the Republicans in name only
[01:18.600 --> 01:24.760]  the rhinos that helped write the health care bill along with the Democrats and
[01:24.760 --> 01:28.800]  who was their person on the committee putting it together you know who a
[01:28.800 --> 01:38.160]  doctor death panel doctor Ezekiel Emanuel what a pig like monster we
[01:38.160 --> 01:42.320]  would say hey the bill has death panels and no it doesn't crazy nutballs and then
[01:42.320 --> 01:47.720]  as soon as it passed they're like oh we are gonna kill your grandmother it is so
[01:47.720 --> 01:51.880]  incredible to see the communists collapse every country they run and then
[01:51.880 --> 01:54.440]  they call don't call themselves communists now it's progressive and
[01:54.440 --> 01:58.080]  liberal and all the rest stuff because we saw what they did in the Soviet Union
[01:58.080 --> 02:01.680]  North Korea everywhere else communist China had to reform be somewhat free
[02:01.680 --> 02:05.000]  marker they would have collapsed 80 something million people died during them
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.760]  trying to be commies and they just want to do it here under another name with
[02:09.760 --> 02:16.640]  this unnatural imperial corporate system where they're offshore lobbying to have
[02:16.640 --> 02:21.720]  communism here that they're exempt from miller millen gates pay zero taxes
[02:21.720 --> 02:27.320]  Google pays 3% taxes general electric pays zero taxes all these big
[02:27.320 --> 02:31.960]  corporations and all these big rich guys pay almost nothing because they wrote
[02:31.960 --> 02:39.040]  the stinking fraudulent laws and I know I harp on this but I mean Warren Buffett
[02:39.040 --> 02:45.080]  is the biggest recipient of the bailout of the stimulus it goes on and on in the
[02:45.080 --> 02:55.000]  first round of the bailout he got 45 billion dollars and all total one way
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.720]  or another his banks have gotten stimulus and QE a few years ago I saw the
[03:00.720 --> 03:04.720]  number just like three years into it it was something like 400 billion dollars
[03:04.720 --> 03:11.040]  or something I mean it's just blows the mind that a guy who lobbies everywhere
[03:11.040 --> 03:17.160]  and ads and print and sponsors ABC this week on Sundays I mean look at the end
[03:17.160 --> 03:20.320]  it's sponsored by billa millen gates foundation the Warren Buffett funds in
[03:20.320 --> 03:25.880]  that he's part of that and he'll be on there just every time I see it going we
[03:25.880 --> 03:30.880]  need to raise taxes on the rich people people making over a hundred thousand
[03:30.880 --> 03:39.760]  dollars a year who already pay 40% I don't matter I mean the poor folks most
[03:39.760 --> 03:44.080]  of them end up being poor and staying poor because they're not bad people
[03:44.080 --> 03:49.920]  they're not even so much stupid they're just incredibly gullible and they go by
[03:49.920 --> 03:54.240]  lottery tickets and think that's gonna fix their life and it's the same crowd
[03:54.240 --> 03:58.040]  and you know I sit here and I watch this I told you Obamacare was on purpose a
[03:58.040 --> 04:01.720]  screw job I told you it wouldn't work on purpose
[04:01.720 --> 04:08.360]  Dr. Blalock said it first total expert total genius studying collectivist and
[04:08.360 --> 04:13.720]  you notice now every new permutation doesn't work and the and the the paper
[04:13.720 --> 04:17.480]  versions you're supposed to mail in they go oh I did sign up and then months
[04:17.480 --> 04:23.000]  later you go when you need you're not signed up it's all a galactic level
[04:23.000 --> 04:30.680]  fraud it's a total false reality of fraud within fraud within fraud within
[04:30.680 --> 04:35.720]  fraud within fraud and because of industrial revolution and computers the
[04:35.720 --> 04:40.760]  normal laws of civilization have been suspended so you can still have enough
[04:40.760 --> 04:45.200]  large s to feed everybody and have baubles but the real wealth the liberties
[04:45.200 --> 04:51.000]  the freedoms the health the mental health is going out the window and we are
[04:51.000 --> 04:57.320]  going to see bizarro manifestations of evil John B. Wells is in studio coming

[05:03.480 --> 05:09.080]  our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in
[05:09.080 --> 05:13.520]  nations around the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride
[05:13.520 --> 05:18.160]  ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the
[05:18.160 --> 05:23.000]  right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.320]  halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented
[05:28.320 --> 05:33.360]  a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[05:33.360 --> 05:39.400]  bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base nascent

[08:23.000 --> 08:35.480]  resistance it's Alex Jones
[08:35.480 --> 08:41.760]  ladies and gentlemen we've got New York police running around breaking into
[08:41.760 --> 08:47.240]  people's houses and knocking bird cages the ground and stomping on parakeets on
[08:47.240 --> 08:52.680]  purpose we've got DC police caught with child pornography and child sex
[08:52.680 --> 08:57.840]  rings then being found dead in the river not suicide boys and girls you've got
[08:57.840 --> 09:02.520]  senators chief of staff put on leave following child pornography allegations
[09:02.520 --> 09:06.720]  and we've got similar reports of this all over the air we have been overtaken
[09:06.720 --> 09:11.960]  by the most demonic miscreants you can imagine taking over every major
[09:11.960 --> 09:19.120]  institution it's not the Senate that was evil it's not the Catholic church that
[09:19.120 --> 09:23.080]  you could say was evil it's not the Baptist church you can say that's evil
[09:23.080 --> 09:28.640]  it's evil getting into these institutions and using the cover of
[09:28.640 --> 09:35.280]  authority to be able to abuse people and it's our denial about it government
[09:35.280 --> 09:40.520]  corruption corporate corruption our own personal corruption of not spending
[09:40.520 --> 09:44.600]  enough time with our families not being civically involved it is all of our
[09:44.600 --> 09:49.560]  collective corruption that has allowed this to go on and now our country is
[09:49.560 --> 09:55.720]  close to 18 trillion dollars in debt we've been signed on and and mismanaged
[09:55.720 --> 10:00.120]  by design to financially collapse us like a third-world country to the IMF and
[10:00.120 --> 10:09.040]  World Bank but we've been signed on to 640 plus trillion of 1.5 quadrillion
[10:09.040 --> 10:15.840]  1,500 trillion and that's four-year-old or three-and-a-half-year-old USA Today
[10:15.840 --> 10:20.920]  numbers that I checked with economists several economists and they said no one
[10:20.920 --> 10:25.080]  can tell exactly but that was an accurate number then it's far worse now I'm
[10:25.080 --> 10:34.640]  gonna say that again the United States has been signed on to 640 plus trillion
[10:34.640 --> 10:42.480]  dollars of the global derivative overhang of 1.5 quadrillion or basically
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.640]  the US has been signed on to a little bit more than a third of 1,500 trillion
[10:46.640 --> 10:52.080]  and since then look at the graphs they've leveraged it up so my chalkboard math
[10:52.080 --> 11:02.640]  would be we're looking at about 200 and excuse me 2010 trillion few weeks ago when
[11:02.640 --> 11:05.840]  I looked at the numbers in the graph and then compared it to that and of course
[11:05.840 --> 11:08.880]  we're talking about these numbers doesn't even matter anymore this is why
[11:08.880 --> 11:16.400]  more republic type inflation in the fiat currency race to the bottom in fact
[11:16.400 --> 11:21.080]  there's a headline right there out of Reuters competing global derivatives
[11:21.080 --> 11:27.840]  rules could lead to chaos failure to thrash out a common supervision of the
[11:27.840 --> 11:32.880]  640 trillion global financial derivatives industry will split markets and
[11:32.880 --> 11:38.240]  bump up cost and end users a top regulator said on Monday and that was
[11:38.240 --> 11:44.080]  from December of this year I guess that was from a few days ago December 9th
[11:44.080 --> 11:49.680]  by the way that number is grossly low and I guess they just what the guys do is
[11:49.680 --> 11:55.600]  they search whatever I say like I said that CFR report by the Heart Revenue
[11:55.600 --> 11:59.640]  Commission came out nine months before 9-11 they searched it there it was nine
[11:59.640 --> 12:04.280]  months for 9-11 I don't know how I remember that and then they hear me
[12:04.280 --> 12:09.480]  talk about 640 trillion in US derivatives that is derivatives they
[12:09.480 --> 12:16.960]  claim that we've backed up and too good to fail too good to fail too too too big
[12:16.960 --> 12:21.760]  to fail thinking of the Liberty Movement we're too good to fail ladies and
[12:21.760 --> 12:24.720]  gentlemen I mean we really have got to be too good to let these globalists
[12:24.720 --> 12:29.200]  scumbags run our lives so my whole point is if you go to drudgereport.com
[12:29.200 --> 12:34.960]  we'll put it on screen for TV viewers boner John boner goes off on the right
[12:34.960 --> 12:42.400]  and says this is ridiculous that's the business insider headline and the
[12:42.400 --> 12:47.240]  national journals also reporting on it it's ridiculous that they don't want to
[12:47.240 --> 12:52.800]  reach a budget deal where they I'm gonna break this down where they massively
[12:52.800 --> 12:57.920]  increase the debt by 60 plus billion and then cut it by less than half of that
[12:57.920 --> 13:04.680]  I mean this is a type of games they're playing literally polishing silverware
[13:04.680 --> 13:10.440]  and rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic an hour after it hit the iceberg
[13:10.440 --> 13:17.160]  I mean the ship is leaning over about to go under and these people are polishing
[13:17.160 --> 13:21.440]  silverware of course they're not really polishing silverware they're blackmailed
[13:21.440 --> 13:28.280]  over corrupt business deals over mistresses over that they don't trust
[13:28.280 --> 13:31.080]  you in the new world order at the higher levels unless you like to rape little
[13:31.080 --> 13:35.640]  kids I mean let's just in fact the word is from top experts that have exposed it
[13:35.640 --> 13:42.520]  and proven it in court like John DeKamp the former senator was that you don't
[13:42.520 --> 13:46.600]  even get into the mid-level echelon unless you like to hurt children or are
[13:46.600 --> 13:50.200]  at least involved in the trafficking of them and then at the higher levels well
[13:50.200 --> 13:54.080]  you know what historically what what do they always said don't be out after dark
[13:54.080 --> 13:58.640]  don't be near the castle kids every culture said don't go near the castle
[13:58.640 --> 14:05.720]  ancient China ancient Transylvania in Romania and Hungary ancient Rome ancient
[14:05.720 --> 14:09.120]  England they're always digging up dead kids at palaces in England don't get
[14:09.120 --> 14:13.600]  near there's vampires they're not really vampires they're they're they're
[14:13.600 --> 14:18.800]  demonic horrible predatory psychopathic humans like John Wayne Gacy who like to
[14:18.800 --> 14:23.800]  bury little kids you have to torture them for days in his basement and his
[14:23.800 --> 14:29.000]  wife was so so incredibly in denial she just kept saying what's the horrible
[14:29.000 --> 14:34.240]  stink what's the horrible stink oh it's nothing honey it's nothing honey and
[14:34.240 --> 14:39.360]  and see now we have these John Wayne Gacy's just running around with nuclear
[14:39.360 --> 14:43.920]  weapons starting wars spiking our water with poison doing all this other
[14:43.920 --> 14:48.680]  garbage and and all you've got to do is admit what's happening I told you five
[14:48.680 --> 14:52.680]  years ago that Xbox when they first came out with an interactive system was
[14:52.680 --> 14:55.920]  tracking everything you do and was surveilling you because it had already
[14:55.920 --> 15:03.320]  been leaked then now it's all confirmed 1% of what Snowden put up notice please
[15:03.320 --> 15:08.280]  if you're a new listener you can go out on the internet and you can find
[15:08.280 --> 15:11.720]  archives of our shows all over the place at archive.org you name one of the
[15:11.720 --> 15:15.400]  first places to be doing it like 12 13 years ago we've been on the air almost
[15:15.400 --> 15:21.760]  19 years now be 19 years middle of next year and you can go find shows from
[15:21.760 --> 15:26.640]  1996 and you can hear me laying it all out and what I want to explain here is
[15:26.640 --> 15:32.160]  folks this stuff is all on record already it's on record DARPA and MIT
[15:32.160 --> 15:35.620]  created the internet to control everybody and to have a quote godlike
[15:35.620 --> 15:41.920]  omnipresent surveillance system it's on record that every phone call fax you
[15:41.920 --> 15:46.760]  name it has been tracked and recorded and and and turned into a text document
[15:46.760 --> 15:52.240]  since 1990 that was a congressional hearings in the mid-1990s okay we know
[15:52.240 --> 15:59.000]  the transatlantic cables tapped we know it's so frustrating we know from the
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.040]  training that they're training police for war with the American people and to
[16:03.040 --> 16:07.360]  mow down men women and children I'm gonna get into that in a moment we know and
[16:07.360 --> 16:12.760]  so what I'm trying to get at here for everybody ish things aren't gonna be
[16:12.760 --> 16:18.640]  better trying to just polish a you know what trying to put perfume on a pig
[16:18.640 --> 16:22.840]  lipstick on a pig this is not gonna work you're gonna have to have a real
[16:22.840 --> 16:29.280]  break with the system because the system is designed militarily to
[16:29.280 --> 16:33.240]  dehumanize and control and dominate this is the most sophisticated thing the
[16:33.240 --> 16:37.200]  planet's ever seen these globalists have the top scientists for hundreds of
[16:37.200 --> 16:41.520]  years developing systems of social control they brought it to a very high
[16:41.520 --> 16:45.560]  level from Germany England in the United States that's who trailblazed it
[16:45.560 --> 16:52.080]  Russia as well Pavlov and others and it has now been fused into a super science
[16:52.080 --> 16:59.200]  system but if you become aware of it and fully pull out of their false
[16:59.200 --> 17:06.000]  reality they've tried to weave you can break with it at least at a spiritual
[17:06.000 --> 17:10.080]  and mental level physically they're bombarding us but they can only turn up
[17:10.080 --> 17:14.680]  the attack to a point that won't completely make the general public just
[17:14.680 --> 17:18.520]  lean up against the wall and you know stop moving I mean they turn up the
[17:18.520 --> 17:22.680]  chemicals the biologicals the wavelengths the radiologicals the ultra low
[17:22.680 --> 17:27.280]  frequency systems that are declassified to you know to control those of us that
[17:27.280 --> 17:31.680]  are resisting it and some evidence shows and this happens in a lot of species
[17:31.680 --> 17:39.800]  actually causing the opposite effect in us in many cases if they turn it up too
[17:39.800 --> 17:45.280]  far it'll be too obvious so they're just and for those that aren't resistant to
[17:45.280 --> 17:50.520]  this or immune to it partially there's so many attacks none of us are immune to
[17:50.520 --> 17:56.640]  all of it or immune to certain parts of it by God's grace if they if they turn
[17:56.640 --> 17:59.960]  it up to a high enough level the general public would literally melt down
[17:59.960 --> 18:03.680]  ladies and gentlemen the social pressure the economic pressure the cultural
[18:03.680 --> 18:09.680]  pressure the spiritual pressure all the things they're doing throwing everything
[18:09.680 --> 18:13.680]  they've got as humanity to break us and to turn us into biological androids to
[18:13.680 --> 18:21.680]  serve them for their pleasure because the globalist in their off time do
[18:21.680 --> 18:27.160]  exactly what you see in the movies hostile that that that's come out over
[18:27.160 --> 18:30.400]  and over again but it's always back of the paper and then the judge won't do
[18:30.400 --> 18:35.520]  anything there's a cover up especially in France especially in the Netherlands
[18:35.520 --> 18:40.120]  and other areas like that we've got nice cultures that are naive folks they
[18:40.120 --> 18:45.680]  are literally as we speak torturing the living daylights out of men women and
[18:45.680 --> 18:50.080]  children for months and years on end their favorite thing is just to starve
[18:50.080 --> 18:53.920]  small children and take three four years to kill them and they feed on the
[18:53.920 --> 18:58.240]  begging the pleading the crying and finally when the souls gone and they're
[18:58.240 --> 19:01.640]  wiped out and they've got what they call shark eyes then they slit their
[19:01.640 --> 19:05.680]  throats and this has come out in court cases and then the governments have
[19:05.680 --> 19:08.680]  covered them up in Europe there's a lot of famous cases you can look them up and
[19:08.680 --> 19:13.120]  this is what the judges and the police and all of them go and do and they a lot
[19:13.120 --> 19:16.400]  of them they just go stand in rooms while children beg and plead and cry the
[19:16.400 --> 19:20.280]  two three years old is their favorite four years old the wailing of children
[19:20.280 --> 19:26.120]  is a demonic music in a satanic trance that that and I'm sorry to have to tell
[19:26.120 --> 19:29.760]  you about all this folks but you can go look it up see now you're ready to hear
[19:29.760 --> 19:33.680]  all this you now know the NSA spying on you now they're putting cancer viruses
[19:33.680 --> 19:37.080]  in your vaccines see if they can't get your kid and drag them off and torture
[19:37.080 --> 19:40.920]  them and use them up as they call it they'd rather just see your child brain
[19:40.920 --> 19:44.040]  damaged and hurt and when they walk around in businesses and stores they
[19:44.040 --> 19:48.520]  enjoy their victims they they they get off on it they enjoy it Warren Buffett

[24:15.800 --> 24:23.680]  trouble for God trouble so hard
[24:23.680 --> 24:33.280]  by the way during the break Niko brought in this article I guess because they
[24:33.280 --> 24:36.480]  were doing a search and I was talking about they're putting things in the
[24:36.480 --> 24:42.560]  food the vaccines the water to dumb us down here's Fox News injection can cure
[24:42.560 --> 24:50.560]  PTSD in veterans and see they roll the sound as anti-stress vaccines you name
[24:50.560 --> 24:54.240]  it there's a whole bunch of different classes this one is basically a drug
[24:54.240 --> 24:59.480]  delivered into the spinal cord that basically you might as well just get
[24:59.480 --> 25:03.600]  electro shock I mean yeah that'll make you forget stuff too it's called brain
[25:03.600 --> 25:10.480]  damage but the issue here is that they're now developing in the last few
[25:10.480 --> 25:15.000]  decades the holy grail in their testing and they admit this is a shot they give
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.880]  you and it can even be in a regular vaccine they claim is for the flu it
[25:18.880 --> 25:24.600]  goes in and then viruses that are developed to only attack certain areas
[25:24.600 --> 25:30.000]  of the brain go in and they can have more they were a remove inhibition they
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  can have the viruses were in the average person they go in and reprogram you to
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.120]  be a nymphomaniac if you're a woman these are some of the studies they can
[25:38.120 --> 25:42.600]  give you viruses to completely brain damage you and if you notice if you
[25:42.600 --> 25:47.520]  saw the newborn movie what was the name of the newborn movie came out last year
[25:47.520 --> 25:54.200]  no no it's it's it's it's the prequel it's the latest born movie and they give
[25:54.200 --> 25:59.720]  them virus injections to reprogram the brain that's real folks and then if you
[25:59.720 --> 26:09.280]  don't have the drug that goes with it you don't just become stupid you die and I
[26:09.280 --> 26:17.280]  was told this years ago a lot of times I would have NSA people telecom people
[26:17.280 --> 26:20.920]  this is all on record bring me documents that I've shown on air that I've
[26:20.920 --> 26:25.800]  covered that's where this all came from and I remember it had to be about 13
[26:25.800 --> 26:31.160]  years ago one of the times a man in a grocery store came up and you tell he
[26:31.160 --> 26:36.120]  was a serious smart guy and he goes listen I work in secret projects I've
[26:36.120 --> 26:38.520]  heard you on the air you know talk about some of the stuff you have no idea
[26:38.520 --> 26:46.680]  they've got special viruses that are basically biological nano tech that
[26:46.680 --> 26:51.440]  that they can make super soldiers with you name it make people where they can
[26:51.440 --> 26:56.280]  march a hundred miles with hundred pound packs you've heard about hypnosis to
[26:56.280 --> 27:02.160]  turn off Olympic athletes in a vision so they can bitch press 25% more he goes
[27:02.160 --> 27:07.040]  imagine that times 10 he goes it's going on right now and then like a year
[27:07.040 --> 27:11.360]  later Wired magazine came out with an article called the Marshall Plan about
[27:11.360 --> 27:14.960]  the 90 year old at the time futurist who'd been there since it was the
[27:14.960 --> 27:20.680]  Department of War in the 40s his last name's Marshall that's what they call it
[27:20.680 --> 27:24.440]  a Marshall Plan and how they had him on the drugs and the viruses and it was
[27:24.440 --> 27:28.640]  all there it's like so many times I learned something classified and then a
[27:28.640 --> 27:34.160]  year or two or three it's right out in the open but then I was given more data
[27:34.160 --> 27:42.760]  more data than what even comes out in the declassification or the they'll come
[27:42.760 --> 27:48.440]  out and announce all this stuff basically to acclimate you like oh there's not
[27:48.440 --> 27:52.480]  gonna be any more stress you take this vaccine and you go read what the anti
[27:52.480 --> 27:59.760]  stress vaccine is and it's a virus that goes in and literally choose in to the
[27:59.760 --> 28:04.760]  areas of your brain connected to conscience connected to memories I
[28:04.760 --> 28:10.880]  mean it's more advanced than electroshock therapy I say that with quotes
[28:10.880 --> 28:16.000]  running blue lightning across the frontal lobe of the brain hundreds of
[28:16.000 --> 28:22.720]  times literally frying it because the bottom is sticking an ice pick in that
[28:22.720 --> 28:26.840]  through the eye into the brain got a little obvious that that was just
[28:26.840 --> 28:33.840]  absolutely barbaric and brain damaging people so then they moved on to
[28:33.840 --> 28:36.560]  electroshock and now they're moving on to viruses in fact they just pulled up
[28:36.560 --> 28:40.120]  an article from Nature and we'll put that back on screen scientists create
[28:40.120 --> 28:45.040]  hybrid flu that can go airborne H1N1 virus with genes from H1N1 can spread
[28:45.040 --> 28:49.120]  through the air between mammals and guess what they're now reporting in
[28:49.120 --> 28:56.120]  China H1N1 airborne and bird flu airborne and then that's in my stack
[28:56.120 --> 29:04.040]  mega massive news and I have talked to virologist and what's the kind of doctor
[29:04.040 --> 29:09.000]  that studies the cultures my dad was talking to him too this morning because
[29:09.000 --> 29:15.200]  I've had family dying from the weaponized stuff that's out there and the way you
[29:15.200 --> 29:19.440]  can tell when something's weaponized is that they're not talking about it or
[29:19.440 --> 29:23.240]  hyping it or fear mongering or saying get our vaccine they're testing
[29:23.240 --> 29:28.080]  something this is undoubtedly weaponized and there's bacterial garbage
[29:28.080 --> 29:33.040]  going on viral and they're in combos and the scientists can't even tell what it
[29:33.040 --> 29:37.200]  is because it's micro plasms folks it's it's it's it's nano tech it's
[29:37.200 --> 29:41.840]  biological nano tech and I've read literally thousands of their papers on
[29:41.840 --> 29:46.520]  it and talked to all the experts and and and and they're really gearing up for
[29:46.520 --> 29:49.160]  something big that's all I can tell you we're gonna come back with brain eating
[29:49.160 --> 29:55.520]  vaccines we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN
[29:55.520 --> 30:04.000]  radio network I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was
[30:04.000 --> 30:08.320]  eating I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was
[30:08.320 --> 30:12.120]  literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins
[30:12.120 --> 30:16.920]  and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating
[30:16.920 --> 30:21.160]  previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at

[33:18.240 --> 33:31.440]  you know we didn't plan to come in with this music it was just automated but I
[33:31.440 --> 33:37.320]  tell you it fits with the news that just broke seconds ago at info wars.com
[33:37.320 --> 33:47.120]  Russia warns America will be basically nuked if they move the missile defense
[33:47.120 --> 33:55.240]  system into Eastern Europe and Ukraine Russia warns America will be responded
[33:55.240 --> 34:00.880]  to with nukes the headline Russia warns America we will respond with nukes
[34:00.880 --> 34:07.080]  deputy prime minister says Moscow preparing a response to US plans for
[34:07.080 --> 34:11.800]  missile shield in Europe it's obviously red-linked with the link to the official
[34:11.800 --> 34:19.200]  Russian news agency lawmakers push for billions to pay for questionable
[34:19.200 --> 34:23.680]  missile defense system notice Kurt already covered that today cop who killed
[34:23.680 --> 34:27.800]  13-year-old boy armed with plastic BB gun back on duty I'm gonna cover that
[34:27.800 --> 34:30.880]  article because sometimes a cop can see somebody with a toy gun and shoot them
[34:30.880 --> 34:34.440]  and it's a sad thing that it happens but they think they're in danger and
[34:34.440 --> 34:39.600]  sometimes I'll research it and say that I I think it's you know regrettable but
[34:39.600 --> 34:43.840]  the officer did what they thought they had to do this guy writes for SWAT
[34:43.840 --> 34:48.800]  magazine and made some bizarre statements about how you got to be you
[34:48.800 --> 34:52.800]  know turn your mean on and you got to just take action even if it didn't
[34:52.800 --> 34:57.440]  right and just these guys are running around literally looking under tables
[34:57.440 --> 35:01.480]  and stuff like terrorists are there and one reason I know this is I got into
[35:01.480 --> 35:08.040]  competitive shooting in college because one of my dad's friends was an army guy
[35:08.040 --> 35:13.000]  and he was also a dentist and he introduced me to it dr. Dillingham
[35:13.000 --> 35:19.200]  really nice guy and I got into it for a while after he introduced me to it but I
[35:19.200 --> 35:24.240]  quit doing it because it was mainly tactical units that were going out to
[35:24.240 --> 35:27.960]  these things and you maybe have a third of the people civilians as they call us
[35:27.960 --> 35:33.000]  even though they're civilians and all the rest the tactical guys and and you
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.080]  have one SWAT team there that roll nice and friendly and just you know really
[35:36.080 --> 35:40.280]  smart guys you have a whole nother police department would be there and it was
[35:40.280 --> 35:47.040]  kind of either or each culture who would literally be like cartoon characters
[35:47.040 --> 35:50.800]  that think they're commandos and movies like Barney Fife on steroids that are
[35:50.800 --> 35:55.320]  looking under tables and acting all weird acting macho and getting mad if you
[35:55.320 --> 35:59.680]  shot better than them and and then actually kind of halfway threatening you
[35:59.680 --> 36:04.960]  and then you think they're joking they're like no I'll kick your ass you just
[36:04.960 --> 36:11.320]  really mental patient types and I look at this guy and he looks exactly like
[36:11.320 --> 36:15.760]  them I mean you'd be out in the middle of nowhere on some thousand acre shooting
[36:15.760 --> 36:19.640]  facility you know place in the hill country or I'd go places up by Dallas
[36:19.640 --> 36:22.960]  and there just be all these police departments out there and I mean they're
[36:22.960 --> 36:28.160]  living in fantasy land folks and I understand they go on these SWAT raids
[36:28.160 --> 36:31.440]  and stuff that are dangerous but then they think old ladies are dangerous they
[36:31.440 --> 36:39.280]  think I mean it's just crazy I mean these are people that are kind of the fake
[36:39.280 --> 36:43.720]  tough they're not the crazy brave and you've got this case out in Sonoma
[36:43.720 --> 36:46.720]  County and I've protested out there against Bohemian Grove I've dealt with
[36:46.720 --> 36:51.760]  these cops and they bugged their eyes out at you especially the deputies had the
[36:51.760 --> 36:54.960]  fire department of all people threaten us to get out of there when we were at a
[36:54.960 --> 36:59.040]  grocery store come up to us and threaten us and then cops waiting outside to see
[36:59.040 --> 37:01.840]  if we did something I mean they're a bunch of kind of California hillbilly
[37:01.840 --> 37:07.920]  thugs this kid is out there with an airsoft clear gun it's clear and yellow
[37:07.920 --> 37:12.760]  and it has black ends on it and if you know you think somebody's got a gun
[37:12.760 --> 37:16.080]  because they're walking down the side of a rural road that's a rural area out
[37:16.080 --> 37:20.680]  there where this happened quasi rural I mean I'd see getting behind your car and
[37:20.680 --> 37:24.240]  saying hands up or something he just jumped out said turn around kid turns
[37:24.240 --> 37:28.080]  around shoots him seven times and then I went and read with the guy writes and
[37:28.080 --> 37:31.360]  it sounds like you know you got to get your mean on it doesn't matter what you
[37:31.360 --> 37:35.440]  do take action immediately any actions better than no action well that's not
[37:35.440 --> 37:41.400]  true any actions better than no action I have people routinely a couple times a
[37:41.400 --> 37:44.440]  year start a fight with me on the street or somewhere for no reason and I'll
[37:44.440 --> 37:49.160]  just go okay mister you're right and do nothing do doing nothing a lot of times
[37:49.160 --> 37:53.480]  is the best thing to do and I'm telling you I've been around these guys they
[37:53.480 --> 37:57.880]  want to go out and it's in a lot of the cops get off on it that's Bob he's
[37:57.880 --> 38:04.480]  killed two people oh it's so manly to be able to shoot somebody it's it's like
[38:04.480 --> 38:09.320]  all these defense department people that were all chicken hawks in Vietnam and
[38:09.320 --> 38:12.240]  weren't in the military who were constantly writing articles about we just
[38:12.240 --> 38:16.960]  ought to murder everybody and bomb the whole Middle East and people like the
[38:16.960 --> 38:24.120]  Prince of Darkness Pearl at the Pentagon who would go up to cocktail parties
[38:24.120 --> 38:27.280]  this has been in the news and tell good-looking women you know I kill a lot
[38:27.280 --> 38:33.480]  of people I'm really powerful I don't beast 400 pound wimp walking up to good
[38:33.480 --> 38:36.920]  looking reporters and and and State Department people and saying hey baby I
[38:36.920 --> 38:45.200]  kill people they're just like oh and and that's kind of what this is like and so
[38:45.200 --> 38:49.280]  I first saw this and thought oh that's a tragic story until I read what he wrote
[38:49.280 --> 38:54.280]  in multiple articles and on forums and this guy should not be a police officer
[38:54.280 --> 38:59.720]  in my view and he should not be the armorer for for Sonoma County up there
[38:59.720 --> 39:04.200]  in northern California beautiful wine country some of the prettiest places I've
[39:04.200 --> 39:10.120]  ever seen and we've been out there demonstrating peacefully and the cops
[39:10.120 --> 39:15.160]  literally have their batons bugging their eyes out at us when we're peacefully
[39:15.160 --> 39:19.720]  out there wanting to get to order to beat our heads in so I mean I mean it's
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.480]  weird like guys in uniforms with clubs looking at other Americans that are
[39:24.480 --> 39:29.720]  promoting liberty with big handlebar mustaches all and nothing against them
[39:29.720 --> 39:32.680]  being gay but you can tell about half of them or you know just absolutely you
[39:32.680 --> 39:38.040]  know whatever and they're like into sadomasochism or masochism or something
[39:38.040 --> 39:42.760]  and they want to beat you up I mean it's just you know all real fetishized is
[39:42.760 --> 39:47.240]  real weird guys in tights that want to fight with you but they want to do it
[39:47.240 --> 39:51.760]  when the odds are against you you're out there nice first amendment there's 200
[39:51.760 --> 39:56.040]  of them you're out there with a hundred hippies that showed up to protest the
[39:56.040 --> 40:00.320]  globalist meeting in secret and making policy and there's I'm not saying this
[40:00.320 --> 40:06.080]  guy's gay I'm just saying you know and you're looking at him and it's all it's
[40:06.080 --> 40:10.880]  just too bizarre I mean it's just bizarre it's bizarre because I'm not
[40:10.880 --> 40:14.280]  claiming I'm the toughest guy around or anything but you know I beat people's
[40:14.280 --> 40:17.760]  brains them in my own hands started fights and stuff and I'm ashamed of
[40:17.760 --> 40:21.560]  that I don't tell those type of stories to sit there and you know feel like I'm
[40:21.560 --> 40:26.100]  a tough guy I mean you know it's sad when you knock somebody over on the
[40:26.100 --> 40:31.360]  ground with blood coming out of their ears and then they are in a coma I mean
[40:31.360 --> 40:35.040]  you know it's I see these guys and it's like high five after they do that to
[40:35.040 --> 40:38.880]  some guy that smarts off to them and you're wimps you're wimps you want to
[40:38.880 --> 40:43.800]  do it in a controlled fashion where you can always win I mean why don't you go
[40:43.800 --> 40:47.600]  do one of these canned hunts where you shoot the tiger in the cage that's
[40:47.600 --> 40:51.160]  basically the type of person you are you're not warriors when you act like
[40:51.160 --> 40:55.680]  this a warrior defends the innocent and justice in the peace and goes up against
[40:55.680 --> 41:00.720]  bad guys you guys are so obsessed with your safety it's his whole religion of
[41:00.720 --> 41:05.760]  our safety come home don't get killed meanwhile you're being injected with
[41:05.760 --> 41:11.160]  deadly viruses meanwhile the water's full of poison meanwhile our names being
[41:11.160 --> 41:14.520]  destroyed your pension funds have already been stolen and people that try to
[41:14.520 --> 41:19.200]  go out and demonstrate for the first amendment in Dallas I tell you the
[41:19.200 --> 41:22.000]  Dallas police did not look like devils to me they looked like they're trying to
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.600]  be professional now I'm not saying they're perfect but then here comes the
[41:25.600 --> 41:29.880]  sheriff's department that looked like the most criminal thug like central
[41:29.880 --> 41:35.080]  casting of a maximum security present I have ever seen pushing peaceful
[41:35.080 --> 41:41.800]  reporters up against metal fences saying move knowing they can't move choking
[41:41.800 --> 41:47.200]  them and bloodying their noses a group of cowards with guns that want to beat up
[41:47.200 --> 41:55.240]  other men that did nothing to them that is what I call a bully coward scumbag go
[41:55.240 --> 41:58.680]  read what this guy says like let me actually find the quotes since I'm
[41:58.680 --> 42:02.160]  talking about it and then I'm gonna get because I know the cops are that are
[42:02.160 --> 42:05.600]  all part of the system are gonna take these shots and I say you deserve it you
[42:05.600 --> 42:09.640]  trust the system so much police that are evil police and serve an order go get
[42:09.640 --> 42:15.960]  your anti PTSD shot they've got literally hundreds of these that have
[42:15.960 --> 42:19.800]  already been developed mainly viral based that will destroy your mind you
[42:19.800 --> 42:24.880]  will now be a totally programmable zombie what what happened to Bob he
[42:24.880 --> 42:28.080]  doesn't even like watching football anymore he didn't like bass fishing all
[42:28.080 --> 42:31.640]  he does is play department training games which are programming I mean it's
[42:31.640 --> 42:37.160]  just open roll out of mind control imagine a movie where the government
[42:37.160 --> 42:39.960]  takes over and they're giving people vaccines so they don't have stress
[42:39.960 --> 42:44.240]  anymore so they're not upset to attack your brain and then scientists find out
[42:44.240 --> 42:47.360]  and trying to warn the media and the bad guys are after them they don't have to do
[42:47.360 --> 42:50.920]  it like that they just roll it out and go oh we have anti stress vaccines for
[42:50.920 --> 42:56.560]  your kids in school they feed them a toxic diet they give them video games the
[42:56.560 --> 43:00.800]  toxic television the toxic culture your kids act up they put them on riddle and
[43:00.800 --> 43:03.920]  they put them on serotonry uptake inhibitors they have more problems don't
[43:03.920 --> 43:07.480]  worry Jenny's been cutting herself and harming herself because all the kid
[43:07.480 --> 43:11.600]  movies and books make it look like it's real cool they don't point that out and
[43:11.600 --> 43:17.200]  because of death education the answer for your daughter is the zikron 90 new
[43:17.200 --> 43:20.120]  freedom shot you know that's what they'll call it you can actually go read the
[43:20.120 --> 43:23.880]  names of these things in development but it's stuff like that I mean that they're
[43:23.880 --> 43:30.400]  they're putting out prescription and Feta means now I took a screenshot of it
[43:30.400 --> 43:33.680]  the other day I'll come get my phone off the floor there I can actually show
[43:33.680 --> 43:39.400]  people and and it's literal Pentagon designed and Feta means just for the
[43:39.400 --> 43:43.600]  general public for shift disorder and then it went for like a minute and a
[43:43.600 --> 43:46.680]  half on this long radio ad I heard it was two minutes long about how it would
[43:46.680 --> 43:49.760]  kill you and make you have heart attacks and make you hallucinate and make you
[43:49.760 --> 43:54.200]  insane I mean I mean this is just total total over the top and and they're all
[43:54.200 --> 44:01.000]  just rolling it out in front of everyone like it's no big deal and I meant
[44:01.000 --> 44:04.320]  to find this drug ad actually did find it on YouTube and play it here it's a
[44:04.320 --> 44:09.080]  couple minutes long where you think it's satire but it's not let me read to you
[44:09.080 --> 44:19.480]  what the head armorer of Sonoma County said trying to find it here today is the
[44:19.480 --> 44:24.760]  day you may need to kill someone in order to go home you cannot turn on the
[44:24.760 --> 44:31.120]  mean gene for yourself who will taking some kind of action any kind of action
[44:31.120 --> 44:37.040]  is critical he wrote and it and it goes on with his writings ladies and gentlemen
[44:37.040 --> 44:44.160]  you turn your mean gene on when you know a predator is coming at you I want to
[44:44.160 --> 44:48.280]  turn my mean gene on with those police in Dallas with those sheriff's deputies
[44:48.280 --> 44:53.200]  but I knew my real mean gene knew to beat them politically and rouse the public
[44:53.200 --> 44:58.920]  to the threat because I want my life to be spent in something huge I really want
[44:58.920 --> 45:05.440]  to win not have some caveman fight with you out in the street and I wish I could
[45:05.440 --> 45:08.360]  unlock your mind but I know most of you've already gone too far I can't
[45:08.360 --> 45:13.080]  you're so on the power trip of the programming we've lost you now and that
[45:13.080 --> 45:19.320]  goes for the general public as well but imagine they have all this instinctive
[45:19.320 --> 45:22.520]  shooting training video games were created so that they could get Vietnam
[45:22.520 --> 45:26.000]  trips to kill people instinctively that's what paper targets popping up bad
[45:26.000 --> 45:29.800]  guy you know good guy lady with a baby now they have lady with a baby is the
[45:29.800 --> 45:33.000]  bad guy if you're told instinctive shooting homeland security kill the
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.160]  woman with the baby in her arms kill the five-year-old boy and that was
[45:37.160 --> 45:40.640]  confirmed by Homeland Security and no one else picked it up it was too extreme
[45:40.640 --> 45:43.880]  no one could even believe that's what they're training for they are training
[45:43.880 --> 45:53.000]  them to be absolute killers and get off on it and think it's manly to be
[45:53.000 --> 45:57.600]  absolutely shaking in fear with instinctive shooting so you see a gun
[45:57.600 --> 46:03.080]  and Pavlovian Lee this is an armorer folks I've seen the gun in question I
[46:03.080 --> 46:07.040]  mean I've anybody's been the target you know this gun with an orange tip black
[46:07.040 --> 46:11.840]  with a clear clear center kid turns around he pumps seven rounds into him
[46:11.840 --> 46:17.920]  and then the police one website celebrated his reinstatement it wasn't
[46:17.920 --> 46:21.080]  like well we're sad for what happened but it was you know understandable that
[46:21.080 --> 46:25.060]  he you know active instinctively to protect himself and we condolences the
[46:25.060 --> 46:28.560]  family but we think he's a good officer it was like welcome back office a great
[46:28.560 --> 46:33.560]  job see it's like you're on the team that's above the law that's how the
[46:33.560 --> 46:36.600]  globalist are that's how Warren Buffett and all the billionaires are they
[46:36.600 --> 46:41.520]  they're above the law they have diplomatic immunity and so the crimes are
[46:41.520 --> 46:46.800]  so much more legion now where I see reports now where they'll go to somebody's
[46:46.800 --> 46:52.740]  house and it still shoot a Chihuahua that's on a leash I've done reports in
[46:52.740 --> 46:55.600]  Austin where they come to a house over a marijuana raid and don't even find
[46:55.600 --> 47:00.320]  marijuana in that one case because a neighbor said they smelled it next door
[47:00.320 --> 47:04.480]  what a good neighbor and the lab because I don't do this with my lab was was
[47:04.480 --> 47:10.680]  actually chained up in the back kitchen and the SWAT team came in and the dog
[47:10.680 --> 47:14.800]  didn't even bark it you've seen the videos where cops pull people over the
[47:14.800 --> 47:19.080]  door opens a lab gets out and they shoot the lab with its tail wagging the
[47:19.080 --> 47:22.720]  the famous video the yellow lab it was the same deal the black lab the lab
[47:22.720 --> 47:29.480]  gets up and they shoot it over and over again in the head and they go well it's
[47:29.480 --> 47:35.760]  instinctive shooting yeah these are literally quick draw McGraw to the point
[47:35.760 --> 47:40.880]  of in New York they reportedly have it on screen didn't like a parakeet squawking
[47:40.880 --> 47:45.360]  when they swat team the house over nothing it turned out so they kicked the
[47:45.360 --> 47:51.680]  bird on the ground and stomped on it I mean you see these guys it's like
[47:51.680 --> 47:57.440]  empowered thuggery acting worse than Mexican police I've seen in Mexico or
[47:57.440 --> 48:02.960]  North Korean police I've seen on film and you sit there and you see how they've
[48:02.960 --> 48:12.720]  mind-controlled them into this culture and it's just all about them while the
[48:12.720 --> 48:17.480]  system absolutely hates them and then meanwhile there's all these serious
[48:17.480 --> 48:24.640]  issues going on all around us I'm not gonna play the whole report but since I
[48:24.640 --> 48:28.960]  mentioned this and now Fox News today is out there promoting and we'll put it on
[48:28.960 --> 48:31.960]  screen so you can see what they were promoting just a screenshot of it a
[48:31.960 --> 48:39.840]  shot or vaccines here's the headline vaccines for PTSD injection can cure
[48:39.840 --> 48:44.920]  PTSD and this is just chemically doing it to the brain but folks they have yeah
[48:44.920 --> 48:47.960]  there it is headline of vaccine for PTSD now they're coming out with another
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.560]  one and that this is going to fix you ladies and gentlemen they're rolling and
[48:52.560 --> 48:56.760]  out saying it's good the water is good come on in you know eat eat the food's
[48:56.760 --> 49:01.440]  good it's poison this is literally the end of free will this is a 13 minute
[49:01.440 --> 49:05.200]  report it's on YouTube it's brain-eating vaccines I'm gonna play just a few
[49:05.200 --> 49:08.560]  minutes of this to encourage you to go find it and watch it this is from three
[49:08.560 --> 49:13.840]  years ago here it is hundreds of different vaccines they're really
[49:13.840 --> 49:21.760]  biological re-engineering live viruses that they inject into your body and the
[49:21.760 --> 49:28.680]  live viruses go in and attack your brain and they claim oh it's to stop drug
[49:28.680 --> 49:34.280]  addiction those same receptor sites that pick up opiates and nicotine and
[49:34.280 --> 49:39.240]  alcohol pick up your normal endorphins it's part of being a normal human being
[49:39.240 --> 49:44.160]  those drugs mimic that and the viruses attack those receptor sites and kill
[49:44.160 --> 49:52.960]  them and create dead tissue it is a vaccine induced live virus lobotomy now
[49:52.960 --> 49:56.000]  they're coming out and saying the American people and the people of the
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.520]  world are sick and major medical journals are saying we need to give
[49:59.520 --> 50:04.800]  everybody these shots to make them feel better to stop having anxiety to stop
[50:04.800 --> 50:12.440]  being angry in other words to take away your instinct for self-preservation your
[50:12.440 --> 50:17.120]  will to survive to make you accept all the bad things that are happening to
[50:17.120 --> 50:23.440]  turn you into a biological android a type of zombie you cannot make this up

[50:29.040 --> 50:33.720]  serious this is this is a global scientific corporate takeover of life

[54:13.120 --> 54:21.280]  it seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets which may make

[55:37.960 --> 55:41.160]  talking about an attack on free will we're talking about vaccines for
[55:41.160 --> 55:47.760]  permanent brain damage lobotomy mind control and they just roll it out like
[55:47.760 --> 55:51.560]  it's no big deal and if we don't attack this now I tried to attack it when they
[55:51.560 --> 55:55.960]  were developing it behind the scenes now they're rolling it out everywhere as
[55:55.960 --> 56:03.760]  oh you're happy about the world take this shot never be unhappy again and it is
[56:03.760 --> 56:07.560]  it is so over the top that it's just like the NSA when I warned you about that
[56:07.560 --> 56:12.280]  we could have stopped it 18 years ago now it's so ubiquitous they just think
[56:12.280 --> 56:16.400]  you're done and now it's gonna be yeah my neighbor he just doesn't really talk
[56:16.400 --> 56:20.040]  anymore he still works and does whatever he's told it makes you highly
[56:20.040 --> 56:24.040]  suggestible there's literally like in the movie black hole where they're
[56:24.040 --> 56:28.200]  firing a laser into their brains to lobotomize them and they're not androids
[56:28.200 --> 56:33.360]  and the guy goes that android has a lamp and looks incredibly human this is
[56:33.360 --> 56:37.640]  beyond body snatchers beyond a science fiction movie and I'm just here watching
[56:37.640 --> 56:43.240]  them go oh you take this shot with viruses that fix your brain and I can't
[56:43.240 --> 56:48.760]  get people upset about it on YouTube when I put that video out I showed all
[56:48.760 --> 56:55.120]  these documents and all this research that we did a bunch of people made jokes
[56:55.120 --> 57:04.320]  because they've been culturally brainwashed and dumbed down and controlled
[57:06.320 --> 57:11.240]  and it it literally puts me into a rage because we're being soft killed we're
[57:11.240 --> 57:16.160]  being attacked this is all really happening on record and I just want to
[57:16.160 --> 57:18.800]  turn it around I haven't gotten all the news I haven't covered really any of the
[57:18.800 --> 57:23.200]  news yet it's all massive Russia threatening to nuke Europe of the US if
[57:23.200 --> 57:25.520]  they put the missiles in up against their border just like the Cuban Missile
[57:25.520 --> 57:30.680]  Crisis we threaten to nuke them this is the insanity of the establishment we've
[57:30.680 --> 57:33.960]  got bubonic plague killed 20 villagers and Madagascar we're gonna get into
[57:33.960 --> 57:40.320]  Colin Powell is coming out basically endorsing single pair it's just gets
[57:40.320 --> 57:43.880]  worse and worse we're gonna be breaking it all down but knowing is half the

[57:50.040 --> 57:56.560]  ability to spread it just goes on and on and knowing about this is good we're
[57:56.560 --> 57:59.840]  not trying to be negative the facts are facts we got to admit we've led a bunch
[57:59.840 --> 58:03.800]  of crazy people a bunch of child molesters and devil worshipers and
[58:03.800 --> 58:07.960]  control freaks and scum take over it always happens in history it's happened

[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:23.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:45.840]  ladies and gentlemen it is incredibly stressful how insane all of this is and
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.880]  I have been more stressed out lately than I've ever been in my life and I
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:52.120]  realized it's probably because my cousin died of whatever this weaponized
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:56.520]  bacteria it looks like in people's lungs now they went and did cultures my
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:00.400]  uncles in the hospital a lot of people I know have died from this I mean young
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:05.120]  healthy people Rob do had a good friend 34 die and of course you're not hearing
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.800]  about that in the news with these new super bacteria that even the World
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:13.240]  Health Organization predicts are gonna kill potentially hundreds of millions a
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:16.320]  year they're already killing tens of millions a year and their answer is more
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:20.200]  antibiotics more antibiotics the overuse of it is what's allowed all this and
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.600]  it's probably engineered and I am just in a controlled rage right now which I
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.560]  haven't been in a long time and I'm just sick of the corruption of society the
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:33.640]  lying and the general public and and the dishonorableness that is just
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:38.320]  increasing by the minute we've got to hold fast though and calm down and just
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:43.760]  trust in God we just got to trust in God John B. Wells flight was delayed in
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:48.680]  Dallas but he thinks he'll be here on time is John B. Wells here yet oh he is
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:53.720]  here I forgot to ask that during my ranting during the break so yeah the
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.200]  real radio show is going on during the breaks here ladies and gentlemen I mean
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:04.400]  I'm a weirdo when I read DARPA plans from 20 years ago to develop bio
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:09.320]  engineering so-called vaccines that re-engineer the brain I've been warning
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:14.120]  people for more than a decade about this and then when I start seeing movies the
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:18.360]  last three four years promoting in the future they give you a shot to make you
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.960]  behave yourself for their own after or the elite get them the brain boost so
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:26.000]  they're already selling viruses in your brain attacking your brain as a brain
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.640]  boost is I mean you could tell people it was elitist to you know stick their
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.920]  hand in a garbage disposal I'm telling you half the yuppies would do it and
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.680]  now they're like oh the troops are gonna be taken care of we make them serve
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.160]  five six seven tours that no one's ever done before even more than one tour is
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:44.480]  not recommended and we're putting them on all these drugs and all the troops I
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.520]  talked to where they make them go on psychotropic for no reason they make
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:50.960]  them go on opiates so they can claim that they're mentally ill and then now oh
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:56.800]  we got a shot for you after seven years eight years of combat and it's
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:02.960]  literally a shot to decommission an old horse I mean it's literally like taking
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.800]  your old horse and horses are instinctive they're actually real smart
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.680]  people think horses are stupid they're not they're real high-blooded and an
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.720]  old horse folks I've read a lot of accounts of this when the Elmer's glue
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.800]  truck comes and you can get you know $50 for the horse nowadays back to a couple
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.280]  dollars to render down their spinal cord their hooves and everything into glue
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:25.400]  or into glycerin you know animal-based glycerin our glycerin our products is a
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:31.360]  plant-based but animal-based glycerin gelatin and the horse that's known you
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.160]  for 20 years will freak out and fight for its life even though it's been loaded
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:41.360]  up in a trailer 500 times when that glue truck pulls up because they can smell the
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:45.640]  horses fear they know that's why they've always got you know they they get the
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:51.120]  owner to come out and soothe you on board and and I'm watching the establishment
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:55.920]  put the troops on the glue truck and they're getting the needles out they're
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:00.040]  already doing the quote trials at the military bases put out all their fake
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.400]  reports and they're gonna spike everybody with this stuff and they're
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:09.040]  gonna come for they're gonna come for me and my family and we're just in a
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:15.800]  giant psychopathic petri dish a giant psych ward psych warfare system with
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:19.040]  these scumbags literally having their way with us because they love hurting
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:24.040]  people and if people would just wake up to it it could all end but it's so
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:27.760]  horrific that the average person who comes face to face with such a
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:33.880]  monumentally wicked conspiracy that's so open hidden in plain view that they
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:38.320]  can't face it I mean anybody listening could go find out that they're planning
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:42.240]  to roll out vaccines for culture control to literally brain damage everyone
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.240]  and try to take our free will and our joy and our pain away our humanity away
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:53.320]  I mean you do this is beyond anything ever even imagined and it's happening not
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:05:01.680]  with a bang but with a whimper and God help us God help us the facts are in the

[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:20.040]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:25.240]  Alex Jones all right folks I'm gonna finish up what I was covering in the
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:29.920]  last hour the attack on free will the attack on the individual the attack on
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:34.680]  consciousness these devils are engaged in just to put bookends on this and I'm
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.800]  gonna do some special reports the next week updating people they've been
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:45.120]  developing for two decades brain attacking re-engineering viruses that are
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:53.480]  designed to only go into certain areas of the brain and to destroy areas of the
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:58.960]  brain that are uploading electrochemical impulses and exchanging chemicals
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:05.040]  that's how it attacks I mean the virus attacks the whole brain in in in all the
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:13.880]  studies but it it doesn't activate and replicate except in the shells right
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:21.000]  around the compounds so so that's how it's able to target certain receptor
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.440]  sites in the ganglia and this is the stuff they admit they've got and what I
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:29.280]  want to explain to you is we already caught them with the H1N1 five years
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.280]  ago we had medical doctors on it later came out this was true when I heard it
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:38.440]  I found it hard to believe but they'd done the the test with electron
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:44.240]  microscopes and looked at it they had put H1N1 in the vaccine as a quote
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:49.840]  simulant an attenuated virus but one that was able to replicate so I guess
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.800]  that is an attenuated they called it attenuated it's not even attenuated I
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:10:00.080]  guess it's just altered to track the spread of the virus the next year and
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:10.600]  then that was actually the H1N1 outbreak and so we have a government in a system
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.120]  that's done thousands of lethal chemical and biological and radiological test on
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:19.160]  Americans troops foster kids Native Americans black people especially blacks
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:22.040]  and Native Americans who just hammered the daylights out of them but they do it
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:26.120]  to everybody poor appellation folks basically anybody they think nobody
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:32.320]  listened to and they've hammered people up one side and down the other
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.760]  devastating the US military and they've done this in other countries Britain's
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:39.760]  been caught over and over again nerve-gassing people you name it giving
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.800]  them bio weapons to see how fast it kills them but then render their their
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:55.120]  organs down to create the mass seed viruses and seed bacteria to then create
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.720]  the larger vats of it just like they use monkey kidneys and things to produce
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:03.360]  the polio vaccine they use the innards because the families get the troops back
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:09.160]  in England in Germany and Europe and in the US and Canada over and over again in
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:12.400]  the congressional hearings and then there was like a side issue and they took
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.680]  his organs well of course they did honey they took your son or your daughter or
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.640]  your husband and they they gutted them and they used them to make more of the
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:31.480]  weapon and I and the elites view is we deserve all of this we deserve all of
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:37.360]  this because we put up with it that's what they say the elites say that and I
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:42.720]  actually agree with them I don't deserve it I don't like it and I don't want to
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.240]  be part of it and I'm not gonna join you and I know the big giant mass of the
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:50.400]  public will rather tear me apart than save their families I understand that
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:56.760]  but we got to do the right moral thing here I understand that this is probably
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.880]  all gonna have to unfold a thousand times worse than it is now before
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:04.280]  anybody ever finally wakes up and by then they'll be injected through the flu
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:07.560]  vaccines and the rest of the point I'm trying to get to is this they're not
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:11.640]  just gonna come out and say are you stressed which I told you they do three
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:15.080]  years ago in the video and is now being announced because they said they were
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.040]  gonna roll it out when they got approval as a stress vaccine and I went and
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:25.280]  showed it to virologist and medical doctors and endocrinologist and others
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.640]  we had them on air and they said no you're right Mr. Jones and we didn't
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:32.880]  know about this this is a giant area of government development worldwide for
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:36.280]  behavioral vaccines is what they're actually called then people that are
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:40.440]  involved in it sent me more info and most these scientists are just leaving
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.960]  the country or hiding out in the mountains now folks I mean that's the
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:48.440]  thing is the scientists are totally freaked out instead of doing anything and
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.680]  challenging it people run with their families and hide you think you're
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:58.840]  going to be able to hide from the rollout of weaponized viruses that
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:04.680]  literally re-engineer our brains and turn us into idiots notice in the movies
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:10.480]  what was the name of the first born the latest born a born legacy I tried to
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:14.000]  watch that again the other night but I was so tired I turned it off but you
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.840]  watch that that that's real folks that's real but they roll it out though to the
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:26.360]  public in a movie about brain boosting vaccines they're not really boosting your
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:31.200]  brain and and actually they don't really increase intelligence they can get rid
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.040]  of certain inhibitions and make you where you're ready to march a hundred
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:39.040]  miles not 50 miles your body has a governor just like your car has a
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.680]  governor so you don't blow your engine that's why they hypnotize Olympic
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:45.680]  athletes and stuff so they'll go through and bench more than they can do or
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:49.080]  squat more jump more that's the reason they keep breaking all the records it
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.160]  isn't just the drugs it's the hypnotism folks visit you this isn't
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:57.560]  hypnotism they're giving special forces troops and the boys from Virginia as
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:03.400]  they're known the private corporate ops above Delta Force all sorts of stuff and
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:11.000]  and and and these guys are dying young they're having mental breakups and it's
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.960]  just like the born legacy ladies and gentlemen I mean I'm telling you it's
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:20.560]  real and it's way beyond that they got brain chips in them and and there it is
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.720]  in the news
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:29.320]  Gulf War syndrome ADHD playlock breaks down with the vaccines have done and I
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:35.360]  got all this other news but what does it all matter if with video games they're
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.360]  brainwashing the public with the TV the culture with the chemicals and the food
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:43.320]  and the water and the electromagnetic and these viruses and all of it and this
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:48.760]  is all real you understand I'm not trying to be shocking when I told you
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.800]  five years ago that your Xbox and other interactive games were being tracked by
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.080]  the government have the CIA and FBI in them it already come out in federal
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.960]  court cases now they tell you because it's in a Snowden document and people
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:06.640]  like oh come on Alex you know the decade ago your your your your phone
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.720]  doesn't listen to you even when it's off and you know there aren't cameras on
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:13.840]  the you know the camera on the computer isn't watching you and of course now it
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:18.600]  all comes out because it was already out okay I'm not lying to you about the
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:24.960]  viruses in the vaccines the cancer virus is in them they're killing us and I know
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:29.280]  it's scary to admit I'm telling you the truth how would you like being on the
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:33.640]  air and being the tip of the spear talking about this how would you like
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:38.440]  that the only reason I'm not dead is because people are praying for me and
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:45.280]  God's in control but outside of that in the temporal zone you need to understand
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:49.240]  ladies and gentlemen that now I've said so much that they hope no one pays
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.920]  attention they can just misrepresent what I've said in the news and
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:58.640]  assassinate my character so that people don't go actually look at what I've said
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:03.320]  if they killed me it will make everyone go look at what I've said that's the
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:07.840]  only reason I'm alive and they may still kill me because they can tell I'm
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:12.360]  getting smarter I'm getting more professional more profound and I can I
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:16.800]  can in my gut and my spirit tell that if I become even more effective they will
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:21.440]  probably wipe me out or set me up and hey I have a responsibility what am I
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:24.920]  supposed to do just kind of back off and let them start giving people vaccines
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:30.880]  that literally eat their brains am I supposed to just play ball with Satan
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:35.000]  I can't do it and I don't look forward to being killed I don't look forward to
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.680]  being tortured I don't look forward to being in some dungeon with these people
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:42.800]  but I got to do what I got to do I mean I just cannot be a coward and stand down
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:48.040]  and watch these people hurt innocents and ruin humanity and vandalize our human
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:53.080]  species because they're devils I just can't be part of it folks and I want
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:57.200]  you to decide you're not gonna be part of it because as God is my witness and on
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.720]  a stack of Bibles and my children I'm telling you the best truth I can
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:05.920]  doesn't mean I'm perfect but I'm trying to be truthful people and what I'm
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.240]  telling you is verified it's so much more horrible and sophisticated because
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.960]  I'm trying to track the life work of the globalist in the life of their 200 year
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:19.280]  or so corporation that's about how old this current Malthusian plan is picked
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:22.000]  up by the British Empire the most powerful Empire in the world at that
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.080]  time and then deployed as the dominant world system of anti-human turn us into
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:31.200]  animals turn us into robots I mean they said a hundred to something years ago
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:35.400]  discover the genes they already knew that's why the symbol of medicine is a
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:40.520]  double snakes together I mean there's a lot more advanced folks than what people
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:45.440]  even know and the elite believe they're getting spiritual knowledge from what
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:49.960]  they call angels or goddesses and I don't even get off into all this I'm
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:53.120]  just telling you as a sociological view where they think they're getting this
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:58.080]  knowledge is from other dimensional entities we call it the devil skull and
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:01.800]  bones Bohemian Grove I mean they take this serious and folks I tend to think
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.680]  they are getting it from advanced intelligences I mean when you read
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:12.120]  stuff from 1855 with with where they they created biometrics to discover the
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:17.200]  genes of humans so that they could become master engineers and become God and
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:21.080]  then they've done it they haven't become God but they've they've I mean they're
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:25.920]  this is this is this is this is this is off-world folks you can call it whatever
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:30.440]  you want okay the Bible says it's spiritual entities that fell to earth
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:34.920]  that are manipulating humanity in a war with God and I mean the more I look at
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:43.320]  it and back off from it it's like whoa man I'll say this I don't know how they
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:48.040]  came up with all this okay but I'm telling you I study it and it is the most
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:54.480]  evil anti-human murderous destructive thing and these people have appetites
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:58.880]  to hurt innocent children and to murder people and to hurt people they're not
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:06.080]  trying to develop all this to to empower humanity they're doing it to not
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:09.360]  just kill humanity they could probably already release a bio weapon and kill
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:14.480]  almost everybody they want to fundamentally wreck us and ruin us and
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.480]  destroy our free will and then turn us into an abomination before they kill
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:26.320]  us and it's about a thousand levels deeper into hell than something like
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:31.880]  Jeffrey Dahmer or John Wayne Gacy you know torturing little kids and stuff I
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:37.400]  mean it's it's it's it's it's I have seen hell ladies and gentlemen I have
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:42.600]  studied their writings I have looked at it these people make the crew from Hell
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:49.040]  Razor look like good guys okay and so I'm just telling that there's no making a
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:54.280]  deal with these people they are the sworn enemy of life itself and if you
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:20:01.520]  don't decide to fight them you are signing up with abomination Alex Jones

[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:18.480]  kind of break down and just tell you what I'm really feeling when I wake up at
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:21.920]  3 a.m. in a cold sweat in the middle of the night I mean I've analyzed what these
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:27.200]  people are doing and it is I'm like a detective who for 20 years 21 years being
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:33.480]  a political activist 18 years on air is immersed in this and I mean listeners you
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:38.480]  know I don't make this stuff up I can rattle off documents names US code I've
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:44.680]  so immersed myself in it that I I know and this is really humbling actually it's
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:50.680]  not an arrogant statement I know more about the New World Order than almost
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:57.200]  anybody in general overall knowledge there are a lot of specialists out there
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:02.080]  that know more than I do in certain areas there are globalist technocrats who
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:06.440]  understand the master plan who built it who obviously know more than I do but
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:10.000]  then they can't even see it from the perspective of somebody who wants
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:19.200]  justice and liberty in a future they follow a very dark flame and so it is a
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:26.920]  bizarre position to be in and to also just see how it's all out in the open but
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:31.640]  it's so complex and so big I can't really blame people that hear this show
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:38.560]  and think I'm nuts because I I've been studying this for 20 plus years and in
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:43.880]  loving history before that preparing me for this in the school of being
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:49.520]  streetwise growing up in Dallas that everything in my life has led me towards
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:53.600]  this point everything that happened to me was part of the journey part of God
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:58.760]  preparing me for my work and God's prepared you for your work and it it's
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:07.040]  it's it's just bizarre to be in this position and bizarre to to to to feel
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:13.120]  like I'm in one of those old movies of uses analogy many times where the
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:15.760]  archaeologists because this really happened in some famous cases what it's
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:21.520]  based on would go into a throne room in South America or in the Middle East of a
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:25.680]  pyramid or a temple and then all the sudden the walls would start closing you
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.720]  know a big rock would fall down on the entrance and the walls would start
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:33.880]  closing and sand would start pouring in or a big boulder would come rolling down
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:38.680]  at them and I'm in here with everybody else the sands coming in the walls are
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.720]  closing and I'm going those walls are closing people are another not they're
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:46.280]  like actually they are but maybe the walls just want to hug us Alex and I'm
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:49.280]  like now we're all squashed in I'm like no it's not we got to find a lever to get
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:54.440]  out of here and and and I collectively we collectively cannot get out of this
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:27:00.920]  unless people really have a break with the system you've got to have a you've
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:05.560]  got to have a break with it and realize and come out of the matrix and really
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:09.760]  come out of the false reality and come out of the artificial habitat that they
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:13.960]  haven't completed yet that's what's scary about this is they're building the
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:18.480]  cage around us and then talking to us like we're kids going there's no cage
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:24.320]  getting built around you and we're like yes there is and then you just it all
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:28.840]  comes out it all gets confirmed and it gets worse and worse and worse and worse
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:33.640]  and there is a big awakening happening that's positive but not big enough we
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:37.880]  can't just awaken to it and then know it's bad we have to awaken to it and
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:41.320]  do something and John B. Wells gonna come up with us for an hour and a half
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:46.960]  today then he's gonna be on the nightly news real treat to get the saturday

[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:01.640]  and George have taken coast to coast towards to a more libertarian patriot

[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:03.800]  calling 888-253-3139 a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:08.160]  into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that was still starving and my
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:12.480]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:15.920]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:20.560]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:25.200]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:29.960]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:19.280]  running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:23.600]  finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle they
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:26.400]  let them in the area they told them they could come in and now they're coming in
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:31.080]  like their trespassers punching and shoving people we're not done and we're
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:40.280]  not running and we're not backing down if you want to commentation the empire
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:49.200]  is on the run live from the info wars dot-com studios it's Alex Jones
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:36:06.560]  the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:14.480]  persist ladies and gentlemen we're back live on this Wednesday the 11th day of

[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:26.680]  websites and I saw him up there at the whole JFK 50th and then he was there
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:29.720]  was about four hours left a little while before the police attacked us we
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:33.680]  thought it was all over the before the deputies attacked us and so we had him
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:38.120]  on from the road there went out to dinner really enjoyed getting a chance to
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:43.400]  hang out with him so I invited him down to Austin Texas so he hopped on a flight
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:47.720]  from Big D like a 25 minute flight and came in here and he's with us for the
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:51.400]  second half of the transmission and I told him I said what do you want to
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:54.560]  talk about this morning before he flew here he said whatever you want to cover
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.600]  just like when I go on his show and then I said well I mean what do you want to
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:02.200]  cover he said look just throw out questions at me and then I'll try to
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:07.480]  give you my my take on him now you know I am John as soon as I start talking or
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:10.840]  if you pause for me I'll jump in so you're here I want you to be able to
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:14.680]  talk some and go over you know all these articles so I'm gonna throw a lot of
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:23.200]  subjects out at you today and just randomly get your take on it Bitcoin
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:29.120]  set up nothing is by the way it's great to see you see you buddy fabulous
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:32.440]  complex you have and all your people are so nice and professionally get it done
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:36.640]  it's or it's a really smoking crew I like it well we're really about to go to
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:40.280]  the next level so we're we're running around like an anthill yeah this whole
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:44.320]  Bitcoin thing it I I subscribe to the proposition that none of this stuff is
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:49.360]  by accident and everything that we see it's like look the other way and the
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:52.960]  noises come from over there look that way that's that's where the action is so
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:56.680]  I started I really I was behind the curve pretty bad on Bitcoin because I
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:59.600]  don't I don't play around with the financial markets I'm not interested in
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:02.560]  stock investment or any that I just observe what's going on a the market
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:07.560]  crashed that's bad markets up okay oh yeah there was that quantitative easing
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:10.840]  that's probably why the markets up okay and that's about the extent of it but
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:16.520]  Bitcoin started becoming more a term more and more frequently used and I just
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:21.760]  thought this stuff is getting just a little bit too much play for it to be
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:29.160]  some really revolutionary idea in mercantilism and of course when it hit
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:33.660]  the papers yesterday so to speak that JP Morgan is going to upgrade their
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:42.480]  patent on on their version of Bitcoin from 1999 and then the little sub
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:47.520]  headline was persons could make transactions anonymously there's no
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:50.440]  such thing as an anonymous transaction over the internet that's just rubbish
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:54.520]  so to me it's like okay there's you there's your one-world currency in the
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:00.200]  making particularly of JP Morgan's behind it because they're behind everything
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:04.720]  that has anything to do with money and have been since there was a JP Morgan
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:09.160]  well I'm on record saying that this is the type of thing that I think JP
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:14.120]  Morgan or Goldman Sachs is behind and I'm not saying that unequivocally but I've
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:18.360]  always not followed my gut even though it's always been right now I follow my
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:22.160]  gut yes and my life just gets better and better and better by the millisecond
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:25.760]  because the guts running things now the brain already knows what's going on and
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:29.800]  intellectually I see a lot of stuff that's wrong with it and here's my
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:33.920]  issue they keep saying in the last five years we need a new bubble they said
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:36.400]  we're gonna come out with a new digital global currency but we need to call it
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:41.240]  something other than sdr's strategic drawing rights they said they want 100
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:45.520]  trillion in new liquidity from taxpayers so they run it out there like
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:49.040]  it's this new crypto thing against them a bunch of people jump on it like the
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:52.360]  tulip bubble you know we're tulips are going for the equivalent of a million
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:55.520]  dollars and then a month later we're worth nothing in Europe people can look
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:01.560]  up that as a case it has all the signs and handiwork of the same tailor this
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:04.520]  suit was cut from the same cloth now I'm not saying people can't make money in
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:10.420]  the run-up of it I don't want the bad mojo the bad karma report you so if my
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:14.640]  gut tells me there's something wrong with it forgive me I'm just saying
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:18.680]  danger will Robinson you know we have something approaching from the east very
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:23.240]  large very dangerous and I totally concur with what your gut is telling you
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:29.480]  and now it's oh they had a patent 14 years ago of something and this comes
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:34.640]  out of Austria and no one will say where it is and it's been pumped in the
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:37.760]  Liberty Movement they may even destroy this and roll something else out of
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:42.080]  them blame us I'm not getting blamed when it all goes belly up the thing is
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:45.840]  that is that the most fundamental concept of capitalism is one that I
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:49.560]  believe most people don't understand and that is these contractions have to
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.480]  occur if you just read the back of any credit card statement or any
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:58.480]  institutions the specifics in the details of what your loan is going to
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:03.160]  cost you you see that I mean back in the 80s even I thought you know we've got
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:08.000]  M1 and M2 M1 is the cash and the check-in accounts and savings accounts M2
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.760]  is basically paper money well if a day came when all of that debt came due
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:16.920]  there's not enough money in the entire system to pay it all so what happens is
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:20.440]  we see these bubbles you see expand expand expand and then there's a
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:24.360]  contraction there's only one or two ways to manage your monetary system and
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:28.960]  that is to collapse it every once in a while and throw a few players out they
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:32.920]  bankrupt them they foreclose on them they resell it and then the expansion
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:38.440]  starts again so now that it this globalistic economy has
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:44.560]  come into play well the danger factor goes even higher because now instead of
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:49.120]  just various markets and maybe even one country having a capitalistic
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:52.120]  contraction now there's a possibility the entire world could have a
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:57.880]  capitalistic contraction and to salvage it lots and lots of players will have
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:02.480]  to be thrown out lots of foreclosures lots of property seized it's and they
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:07.040]  the globalists have used national reserve banking in the boom bus cycle to
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:10.800]  gain dominant control now they openly say they're going to have one giant
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:15.200]  meltdown poses the saviors during it make us accept a new digital global
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:19.640]  currency that we pay carbon taxes to the back that then surveils all human
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:26.040]  activity through the Panoptagon NSA grid that's actually global and then they
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:30.480]  can selectively shut down all their competition with selective enforcement
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:34.680]  that is a high-tech total tyranny and that John B. Wells as you've accurately
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:39.120]  broken it down is the New World Order capstone the master plan and how do we
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:43.720]  get the general public that they're smart enough to know all to watch Sports
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:48.360]  Center and to know everything about the NFL they've got to learn about the
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:52.840]  world people aren't successful because you don't know how the world really works
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:57.280]  you know about your sitcom people on your football people you're the males
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:01.800]  soap operas I get football folks I like it too the point is is that I'm not that
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:05.760]  smart and I figured this out John's a smart guy he figured it out and it's
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:11.400]  all coming towards a very bad design contraction so what do we do about it
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:14.720]  well I don't really know what we do about it because that the other component
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:18.120]  it's one that we've discussed before and that is taking some of the players out
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:23.480]  meet me equate to literally taking some of the players out in other words big
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:30.160]  cloud conflagration I was reading about the you know if there is a huge solar
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:34.800]  what do you call a man a coronal mass ejection and so forth that took down the
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:41.480]  grid I mean I believe it was on you in force that the potential to eliminate
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:44.920]  nine out of ten people because of civil unrest and this and that and the other
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:49.080]  because your grid goes down that's yeah the Pentagon says that and now they know
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:54.720]  on average every hundred years or so we get hit by one big enough that when it
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:58.400]  hit last time it blew out most the electricity in large areas of the world
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:05.120]  imagine if that hits now well I the population is high strong enough as it
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:10.880]  is I mean there's tight as a bow string as it is somebody is is waiting for
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:14.920]  something bad to happen oh it's not just somebody it's this entire group well
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:19.200]  which group I mean is it the poor group is it the Patriot group is that the
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.240]  conservative group is it the liberal group who's who's waiting for some to
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:26.760]  happen everybody's waiting for something to happen and you ask what can people do
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:30.880]  about it the thing is is train yourself to look in the opposite direction from
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:35.240]  where the noise is coming and I think we're gonna be I think we're a few
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:39.080]  months off from from determining how we're gonna survive let alone succeed
[01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:44.240]  maybe the success will come later but I I think we're looking at a scenario
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:47.640]  within the next six eight months it could be quite dramatic I mean every all
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:53.080]  these antics from the executive office this routine circumvention the
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:56.960]  Constitution this unbelievable militarization of the police departments
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:00.280]  and these people who just run around shooting like ever before now people
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:03.480]  can say well you got the internet now so they can make a case for saying now
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:07.360]  that's just stuff that happened all the time always has happened and you're just
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:10.080]  hearing about it now because communications methods have improved
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:15.000]  it's like not really there is a there are more frequency there's a greater
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:21.200]  frequency of cop shooting people that should not have been shot I mean this
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:25.640]  guy that shot this kid with the BB gun it's back on duty now the one that shot
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:31.680]  of the car in New Mexico he gets fired but the get but the one who killed the
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:35.920]  kid is back on duty well we all see the videos where a lab jumps out of the car
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:39.800]  because the cop opens it that the tails wagging anybody knows a dog that's
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:45.880]  friendly and then the cop just shoots it I mean what is this why is this
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:51.360]  happening why why are the is are the policemen that we trusted when they
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:55.400]  showed up it's like oh good relief help help is here they'll help us I mean to
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:58.120]  me it's almost as though every confrontation with the police officers
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:01.640]  potentially life-threatening now well that's because they've been trained to
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:06.280]  be warriors and a marine doesn't act first you'll be dead marine that's what
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:11.360]  this guy that shot the 13-year-old with the airsoft gun said in SWAT magazine
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:15.160]  he said you've got to act even if you don't know what you're doing he just
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:18.800]  some action is good well that's not true well it's not public service either
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:23.920]  but I mean he's not he's not fighting the Taliban no it's not like he was in
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:27.320]  Afghanistan and the guy had something a little like a rifle and turned around he
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:33.360]  shot him he'd be like yeah it's a war zone it's it's a rural area of Northern
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:38.640]  California with a kid with a plastic pellet gun it's just beyond anything
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:41.240]  I've ever seen I don't understand why you can't pull your pistol out and march up
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:44.520]  going put your hands in plain sight or I'm gonna start shooting I'm warning you
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:47.440]  don't do anything else and then if it's somebody makes a threatening move it's
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:51.160]  like well there's always a kneecap or a leg or an arm or a shoulder or some you
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:54.120]  don't have to dump your whole magazine in the person but I think they do that
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:57.240]  well they train them in instinctive shooting to kill them immediately that's
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:00.080]  why we had a case in Austin where a guy with no criminal record got pulled over
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.680]  officers said you know get out of the car from his little loudspeaker or whatever
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:07.720]  and the guy gets out with his wallet in his hand and the cop just instantly like
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:13.360]  he was a gunslinger starts firing at him and listen listen I had an Austin cop
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:17.280]  pulled me over for speeding about ten miles an hour in Northwest Hills when
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:21.360]  I was a senior in high school my mom said go get me frozen yogurt and I said
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:25.480]  okay cuz you know that you know then help me get a car meant that I would do
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:28.360]  errands for him constantly right which I like doing so I go up and get a thing and
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:31.920]  my weight belt sitting in front of the seat green Mustang cop pulls me over right
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:35.200]  by my house like 300 yards away he walks up hey how you doing life's
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:39.880]  registration you know your speed also hands on the wheel he had the gun to my
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:45.280]  head he was like get out get out he was like oh never and luckily he didn't
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:48.880]  nowadays they beat me up or something as they were wrong and prove they were he
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:54.120]  goes oh it's a weight belt oh okay well I thought it was a knife scabbard a gun
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:59.120]  and I was just like okay and he let me go but I mean he was I was more calm with
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:05.400]  him with a gun to my head screaming and he was and he's holding the gun yeah
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:11.440]  I mean obviously a guy pulls up like hey yeah sorry you know boom gun to you
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:16.960]  know like I mean what is that psychosis that's what it is I mean well if they're
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:22.400]  so afraid they shouldn't be a cop that's correct and absolutely correct I
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:28.200]  mean DPS officers Texas state police they typically don't act that way and I'm
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:31.040]  not saying they're angels they're not you don't mess with the DPS these are
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:34.840]  serious cats they really are but they've got a calm demeanor about them and
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:41.080]  now if as what happened in Fort Worth Texas some years ago the DPS says stop
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:45.760]  what you're doing and you speed off and he's on your truck and he goes stop the
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:50.200]  vehicle and a guy doesn't do it so he goes boom no that's different that's
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:54.120]  asking for it you know that's a Texas state policeman that you're that's
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:56.880]  clinging to your vehicle is telling you stop the vehicle that's why I'm
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:00.200]  threatening that's different but just to flip out because of a weight belt in
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:04.040]  the seat it's like what's wrong with you it's a and I think a lot of these guys
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:08.760]  are probably ex-military when they come back from from being in the stuff over
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:12.760]  there what are they gonna do how can they apply those skills and they're
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:17.760]  already jacked up well I would be completely exhausted every day if I
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:20.960]  just ran around with my eyes bugged out thinking everybody was out to get me
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:23.840]  because I did some competitive shooting and it was like more than half of more
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:26.880]  cops involved in it I got out of it because they were so whacked out and
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:32.240]  literally just acting like Rambo yeah and and and just thinking people are
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:35.880]  hiding under the you know well you know a lot of people drink a lot of people
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:40.520]  take a prozac based anti-depressants a lot of a lot of these police are under
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:45.680]  I think part of the problem is that the society is so big now I mean literally
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:51.520]  in numbers physical numbers that they are exposed to so much ugliness that it
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:55.680]  affects you you can't see somebody oh I agree just reading the news every day

[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:35.840]  a quick segment obviously I want to get into the subject you raised but you were
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:40.360]  talking about you wanted to get into Mandela a little bit what's your take
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:44.280]  on Nelson Mandela and that collection of communist and socialist leaders and
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:50.280]  dictators meeting and and nobody in our media pointing it out really well the
[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:53.760]  proof this mainstream media of ours we know it's bought and paid for we know
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:58.640]  that it is gals like a amber lion who said we were paid to run some stories
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:01.480]  we were paid not to run some stories that that pretty much says it all and
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:06.280]  they're all doing it 400,000 not to not run a story by the government of Cutter
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:12.080]  that's right and what happened to the story about Iceland in 08 this goes back
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:17.120]  to May of 2012 not 08 May of 2012 they threw out their whole government they
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:22.080]  rewrote the Constitution to preclude any any corporate fraud they're refunding to
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:25.720]  every household there's only 320,000 people okay I understand that but that's
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:30.360]  that's a small GDP too they'd signed them on to hundreds of billions that
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:34.400]  wasn't their debt that's right and and they just said no and they stopped it
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:38.240]  and CNN's like oh well we're following the story it's like well lunch fall a
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:42.800]  little bit closer because it's over a year old now what would happen if in
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:47.280]  this country that went out over mainstream media that's like these people
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:50.960]  threw out their government threw them out they arrested the banksters they
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:55.320]  seized their assets they jailed them and that's how it is they rewrote the
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:58.800]  Constitution so that this cannot happen again we wouldn't want any Americans
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:03.680]  get no sorts of ideas no would we you're right Iceland is the model and just like
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:06.960]  in Greece everywhere else it turned out over 90% of the debt they've been signed
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:11.440]  on to was actually British bank debt no connection to them remember the British
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:14.480]  government was trying to arrest people for terrorism or not letting them leave
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:18.840]  Iceland or use British airways then it turned around it was all a fraud mm-hmm
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:22.840]  yeah and and you said it was a short segment so we'll get the Mandela later
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:28.520]  but everything we're being presented with is a borderline fraud I mean they
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:32.520]  just want us to tow the line go forward be good little boys and girls and don't
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:36.480]  ask questions in other words they don't care what you know all they care about
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:43.920]  is how much you care that's right no second hour coming up third hour

[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:29.240]  John B. Wells is our guest I'm gonna give the number out the next segment and
[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:34.200]  start taking calls about 24 after I got a ton of news that I want to get to and
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:38.800]  get John B. Wells quick take on we're gonna talk about Mandela in the next
[02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:42.680]  segment the attack on the free press what else do you want to get into there's
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:46.640]  a lot to talk about a lot to talk about and one of the things would be Snowden
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:50.280]  how he was the runner-up for person of the year by Time Magazine they went
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:54.320]  with the Pope instead and I want to believe that Edward Snowden is as he
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:59.720]  appears to be but my first question is one more time why is he alive why is he
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:04.080]  not dropped off the scope why did he not and and Assange it looks like he's not
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:09.280]  gonna be prosecuted either so I want Snowden to be on the level I do but I
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:14.360]  just Dr. Pachennick says it's all staged to can have a public debate about the
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:18.600]  NSA and to only dole out a little bit because they know they can't hide it
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:22.320]  anymore and so now they're gonna decide to just put it out themselves and kind
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:26.080]  of inoculate us psychologically well I would agree with Pachennick on this one
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:29.520]  for sure and there are some things a bit with Steve that I disagree with but I
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:34.560]  got to roll with him on this because it's just a little bit too visible to be
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:38.720]  real by the way I already knew all this because they'd already had AT&T
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:43.640]  whistleblowers six years ago other ones that have had one decade ago James
[02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:48.880]  Bamford I was having that NSA whistleblowers that were the EU Parliament
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:55.960]  15 years ago people like Wayne Madsen but he thinks Snowden's good well I want
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:00.100]  him to be I'm just I'm just still looking but now all this stuff has come
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:03.120]  forward I mean this has been going on for 10 years but the FBI can turn on your
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:06.200]  webcam without turning on the little green light that indicates to you that
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:10.120]  it's on they've been able to do that since I don't know 0405s well they
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:14.400]  designed all of it that way it's all been designed with the tech now I mean the
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:17.080]  technology company people come out all the time and go I've been told to build
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:21.240]  the back door in the webcam that was in the mid 1990s wouldn't it be strange if
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:25.060]  the reason that all of this is being done is is under the auspices of fighting
[02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:28.760]  terrorism but it's really just to find an excuse to separate you from your money
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:33.560]  and your property and nothing more now that's it it's the defense contractors
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:37.320]  taking over this market they're literally re-engineering to the society
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:40.320]  yeah it has nothing to do with fighting crime there's nothing to do with
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:45.440]  defeating terrorism it's all about the Benjamins again I mean that's sick it
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:48.440]  really is I mean it goes right back to the scriptures you know the root of all
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:53.360]  evil is the love of money and that's it that's right it's not it's not having
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:56.360]  money it's good when good people have money to be able to defend themselves and
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:00.320]  build a good society it's the love of it when you put it up top as the golden
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:03.520]  cat that's right that's right it and I've heard people say this about I had
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:08.360]  heard this guy say this about his little sister oh she loves money she'll do
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:12.360]  anything well as the years have gone by it's like this is a real serious cow you
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:16.800]  need to steer clear of her and keep your hand on your wallet I've seen women
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:20.120]  before when there's a big stack of money they actually a lot of them get excited
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:24.160]  and it's just literally dirty nothing well that's not exclusive to them I get
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:28.560]  excited I got money too yeah but I mean it's just like I mean but all it is is a
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:34.200]  fiat fraud a symbol of energy sure and he's globalist people will kill or just
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:39.000]  a little bit of money well and the thing is is that Matt it's a who's the guy
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:43.280]  played Boris the blade and in snatch easy he always plays the evil rush oh yeah
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:45.960]  in every movie it's the same guy I don't even know his name but you'll spot him
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:50.960]  anywhere yeah he was in a show called MI5 they call it Spooks overseas and it's
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:56.760]  off the air now but this guy said you're insane he says no no it's the vast sums
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:04:00.840]  of money I do what I want the vast sums of money make everything possible and
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:06.640]  that's true the vast sums of money make everything possible but I take the vast
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:10.800]  sums of money to build the operation well exactly like the average talk shows
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:14.160]  this level's flying around a private jet and you know and literally at the
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:17.480]  country club that's all boring yeah changing histories what's important oh
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:21.880]  is treating commies yes and there is a huge communist element everybody got
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:24.960]  pretty burned out on that we got to defeat communism because that went on for
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:29.320]  the 50s and the 60s and the 70s and then it kind of went away in the 80s and
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:33.360]  now they're called progressives that's how I see it oh that's who they are I
[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:36.640]  want to come back with that with Mandela and I've got images of him as the
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:41.200]  mainline photos of him looking with the head of the Communist Party with his
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:47.320]  wife there the head of the Communist Party with him in 1993 there with the
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:50.840]  big red star behind him we also have video of him singing kill the white
[02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:55.680]  people and we checked it he is singing it in the South African African dialect
[02:04:55.680 --> 02:05:00.160]  kill the white people so it's very loving I thought it was a cuckluck's clan
[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:05.440]  rally in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and
[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:10.680]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around

[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:19.360]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:24.800]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the

[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:59.160]  with us this just went up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com cops
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:04.160]  trained to kill people at traffic stops in the new drills federally sponsored
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:09.720]  they walk up to people at traffic stops and aim guns at everyone's heads this is
[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:13.400]  the standardized federal training like Boston and like we saw a few weeks ago
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:16.440]  in LA where they were walking up at checkpoints putting guns to people's heads
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:21.520]  this is totally criminal and you can see all that up on info wars.com in fact
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:25.880]  Paul's gonna add the photos and videos from that earlier article to this we're
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:30.800]  gonna cover that coming up but John B. Wells for those that just joined us we
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:35.320]  were talking about communism and again what I've seen is the Rockefellers and
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:39.360]  others funded Lennon that's been in congressional hearings in the 70s the CIA
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:42.960]  helped put Mao in power in 49 that's now been declassified about a decade ago
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:47.880]  again people can look all this up our government people running it they want
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:51.780]  dictatorships all over the world they put Saddam in they created Al Qaeda they
[02:09:51.780 --> 02:09:55.120]  want oppression because it's easier for the big corporations to run things that
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:10:01.240]  well that way and rob things so when we talk about communism as as Carol
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:05.600]  quickly wrote in tragedy and hope and he was an insider they want fascism they
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:09.360]  want authoritarianism they want communism as long as it's autocratic and
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:14.160]  that's why they're using communism to make people dependent to enslave you
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:17.920]  through monetary control they're doing it and all the people that were
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:23.040]  communist people really were sick of it by the 80s and saw that it people couldn't
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:27.560]  even get a you know some sausage or nylons or whatever standing around the
[02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:30.120]  block that it was horrible that it was corrupt that the communists were all
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:34.040]  rich on the top people were sick of it it failed then they came out and said
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:38.000]  we're liberal and they play the race card and all this stuff and then South
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:42.720]  Africa gets taken over by a communist they go from one evil apartheid and I
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:46.640]  looked this up in Africa the blacks on average in polls say we want apartheid
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:50.920]  back I don't want apartheid back they would have gotten free market instead of
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:54.840]  communism they'd all be rich over there by now instead most estimates are five
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:58.960]  times worse than it was rape murder capital of the world outside of Chicago
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:04.160]  you've got the floor my friend I'm ranting to talk about Mandela the
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:07.840]  progressives Obama everything tying this together and where you see the
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:11.200]  world going well I've got a good story for you on the on South Africa
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:16.520]  Kathy Lee Crosby remember her yes her dad Lou Crosby was the voice of Lexington
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:21.040]  cigarettes for 20 years and I guess the lobster in the king clip and the
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:25.560]  cigarettes and everything else got to him but the music producer for that for
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:29.200]  that brand but they actually run movie trailers over there so they came at the
[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:31.880]  end of the movies and he would do these beautiful nature things are
[02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:36.080]  unbelievable about it Tasha and this and that his son was at the he's deceased
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:43.840]  now but his son was at Denton School of Music and he was on his way to recast
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:47.880]  for the voice of Lexington cigarettes and see his son at the same time well
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:55.400]  guess who he cast so I went over to South Africa every year from 1984 until
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:04.320]  about 93 they decided it would not be good for me to go over there after the
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:09.760]  clerk and his crew got got thrown out defectively thrown out during the time
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:15.200]  that I spent over there I first of all there was razor wire and electric wire
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:20.400]  to keep people out because they wanted in because everything out of South
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:24.600]  there outside of South Africa was absolute chaos I've been up through
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:30.760]  nominee before up up toward Uganda it was just wholesale murder in Uganda was
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:35.320]  there the the very month on the very week that the some 16-year war had
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:41.080]  ended in Mozambique so we're able to get in there and look around so I got to
[02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:45.280]  speak with real no kidding these aren't African Americans these are African
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:51.280]  Africans and what they had to say was far different from anything this news
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:57.640]  media has ever said first of all all those a k4 Nelson Mandela was part of
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:01.400]  the leader of the armed wing of the African National Congress which
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:05.360]  everybody says is nothing but you know the Communist Party in African garb and
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:09.320]  it was true Winnie Mandela remember when she came up on charges they were
[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:13.320]  really lame charges for torturing and then killing some teenagers that she
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:20.160]  suspected being unfaithful to the cause so if people say well you're racist because
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:23.680]  you don't like Obama or you're a racist because you don't like Mandela it's like
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:29.440]  no but you are a racialist because you're using racial issues to push
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:32.680]  forward your agenda but no I'm gonna pull it up there was an article by Lou
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:36.960]  Rockwell that we added some photos to not by a little rock all but from Lou
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:43.320]  Rockwell dot-com where we showed all these photos of him in at the Communist
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:47.600]  Party meetings when he was president and with the leader of the Communist Party
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:53.000]  that he went to college with and these are people that targeted children and I
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:57.080]  looked it up they did target police's children yes putting tires up of their
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:01.040]  heads and black kids that wouldn't go do terror attacks they would hang a tire
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:05.480]  up of their head and kill them and then him on television saying kill all the
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:12.280]  whites in the white areas and so the whole issue is is that the globalist
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:16.640]  Prince Charles and people came and put him in so they could just murder and
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:19.840]  slaughter everybody and now that's happening we're not defending what was
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:24.120]  there before the difference is it was an Oasis compared to the rest of Africa is
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:28.360]  what you're saying absolutely and I can tell you that Africans have killed more
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:35.680]  Africans than any of the the horrible white racist South African police to
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:38.880]  or defense forces either one I mean it's just the plain truth of it if you do
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:42.600]  your research which I know you do I mean the people at large if you look into
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:46.440]  this you'll find that's that's just how it is I'm gonna punch up on screen this
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:49.920]  article useful idiots 2013 and go through it but I mean keep talking about your
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:54.240]  experiences in South Africa and what you saw because you know you see almost all
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:56.840]  those world leaders that went to his event and they bust in all these
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:00.160]  communists and government workers they couldn't even fill the whole stadium to
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:05.000]  jump up and down and say how great he was and then I know the politics of it
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.520]  I've studied it and what they've done and how these communists live like kings and
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:13.720]  and just how anti-liberty they are and how they disarmed the black tribes that
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:17.440]  weren't part of their group the white groups and then just slaughtered them and
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:20.920]  then there's photos of Nelson Mandela with his militia commanders in fact I'll
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:24.840]  scroll down who are the only ones that are allowed to be armed and then go out
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:28.680]  and carry out all these different operations I mean it's just the standard
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:32.480]  deal and you can see they want to use this racial division program of you
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:37.040]  didn't build your business somebody else did that here this is their plan I
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:42.680]  mean that's absolutely correct I mean it's you have to have a boogeyman and the
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:47.280]  boogeyman is communism but when you realize that that you are the boogeyman
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:50.920]  and the policies that you're fomenting and trying to voice on the people are
[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:55.640]  in fact communist policies I mean it goes back to Lenin and and then and rock and
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:59.720]  and John D Rockefeller that you have to have the first step to get the people
[02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:04.840]  under your control is a what national health care system I mean can you believe
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:07.680]  that it's amazing though they funded the boogeyman of communism so they could
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:10.920]  turn us into a police state to counter it and meanwhile turned us into that
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:14.920]  exactly I mean it's like you become what you be held in contempt and and and
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:20.360]  with loathing you are now that and then I suppose the cycle reverses of the
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:24.840]  polls flip and when they become what you appeared to be before well then you're
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:30.160]  the enemy of that so it's just it's the human beings insatiable desire for
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:36.480]  conflict and the money that goes with it as Moriarty said expanding on that you
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:39.800]  were talking about the press and you were putting out the hypothetical how
[02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:43.880]  long can this go on they're bringing in cyber security to curtail the web to tax
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:47.280]  it to track it they want a fairness doctrine for talk radio they're trying
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:50.880]  to buy it up they're trying to persecute the press are using the IRS on the tea
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:55.040]  party that tells you the good guys are right there it is the real tea party
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:58.320]  that's trying to reverse this and they have the Republican and Democratic
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:04.840]  leadership led by a boner John boner the Speaker of the House trying right now
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:11.000]  to literally beat the the the the libertarians into submission Alex this
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:14.640]  is what's so unbelievable to me is that the 12-year-old girl within the last
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:18.160]  week I saw an article about the 12 years story on a 12-year-old girl who had
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:22.040]  traced the lineage of all the presidents and it was either Van Buren or Buchanan
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:27.680]  one of those two started with a B he was the only one whose bloodline was not
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:33.400]  traced all the way back to King John Lackland Plantagenet now what does this
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:38.800]  tell us about pre-selection what does it tell us about we think we live in a
[02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:42.320]  two-party system but the moment that the third party candidate comes anywhere
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:46.400]  near a national election the first thing that happens is a wave of ridicule and
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:52.480]  they they run him off just like they did Ron Paul is his own conservative group
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:57.280]  ejected him from the proceedings and for a while there he had a real chance but
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:02.560]  now when they and by the way Obama is multiple cousins with Cheney Cheney is
[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:09.640]  related to Bush Bush is related to John Kerry and then and then they're both from
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:13.840]  the same fraternity the only has like 15 graduates a year and then you start
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:17.840]  learning it's all interconnected it is unbelievable it is and then you learn
[02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:22.400]  that's not even really a British bloodline it's not even a German bloodline
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:26.640]  it's a Transylvanian bloodline and then you realize most the world leaders are
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:31.320]  related to Vlodian paler or Count Dracula and then you're really in cuckoo land
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:35.880]  well it's it seems to me that that gene pool could use what a little chlorine
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:42.900]  because of Barack Barack Obama is is related distantly to King John Lachlan
[02:18:42.900 --> 02:18:49.960]  Plantation a these leaders are pre-selected and as a matter of fact it
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:54.880]  it appears that they are even groomed from from birth which makes sense because
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:59.560]  their fathers would be doing the grooming just like with Joe Kennedy John F.
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:04.120]  Kennedy was never meant to be president it was supposed to be Joe Jr. but he was
[02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:08.440]  killed in World War two and they went back to Irish royalty that's it that's
[02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:15.440]  absolutely correct I mean it the rulers their lines have never faded away so
[02:19:15.440 --> 02:19:18.720]  this whole thing about anybody can grow up and be president of the United States
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:25.240]  well that's just not true only if if it is decreed to buy blood they're
[02:19:25.240 --> 02:19:29.040]  absolutely right and and of course they've been inbreeding so long that
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:33.920]  even in mainline news it looks like they have a different strand of DNA because
[02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:37.680]  of the inbreeding I mean these people are unbelievable now you're getting an
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:41.240]  unsealed alien files territory which by the way it's a pleasure to narrate that
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:44.320]  program you know check it out sometime it's a it's a good one they're talking
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:49.520]  about alien DNA going all the way back to Akinadan and I tell you I've been to
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:52.680]  some of those Egypt things to see those mummies and those people without their
[02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:55.720]  heads being bound they look like spacing oh absolutely do because their heads
[02:19:55.720 --> 02:20:01.360]  really were that shape and they wasn't deformed that way they were formed the
[02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:05.960]  facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic members

[02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:58.960]  coming up but John we've talked about so much here today there's a new video up
[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:05.760]  on info wars.com that shows police training quote to shoot and kill
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:09.240]  drivers and we were looking at it during the break and the photo of them just
[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:14.040]  walking up to people in drills and now it's not even checkpoints and sticking
[02:25:14.040 --> 02:25:18.760]  guns to their head and I mean I got to be honest with you I'm this is literal
[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:21.120]  prisoner training so they have the kids come out during the drills with their
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:25.240]  hands up they're training us for to take over John be well seeing these photos and
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:32.760]  these videos what do you make of this. Well first of all what I make of it is I
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:36.640]  have to control my anger at this because this is inexcusable me we all saw that
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:39.800]  Clint Eastwood movie got an Academy Award for it unforgiving where little
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:43.760]  Bill comes up on English Bob and all his deputies who are a bunch of cowards and
[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:48.640]  he's a and he's a sadist that's Hackman played the sadist little Bill they're
[02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:52.600]  all pointing the rifles all all of important rifles and pistols that and
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:58.920]  shotguns that at one guy and his little his little meek biographer and that's
[02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:03.960]  what's happening here I think Eastwood was actually trying to tell us that this
[02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:08.320]  is what you get when you disarm the population and you know I don't want to
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:11.880]  go too far oh that was the the duck of death the duck of death he was calling
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:15.240]  the Duke of death he jugged when he stomped his head in and called him the
[02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:19.880]  the duck of death because it was showing this is the real psychopath running
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:25.080]  the town while you have the fake wannabe psycho yes that's right and and I
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:29.200]  believe you're absolutely correct we are being conditioned to accept this and I
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:36.120]  don't think that we should look it seems to me that any time the citizenry
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:40.160]  pushes back against the government and has that look on their face like we're
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:43.360]  really not going to have this the government goes no wait a minute wait a
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:47.760]  minute wait a minute and they back off but the longer we let them to let let
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:50.760]  them do this they're just going to escalate and by the way that's
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:54.760]  scientific won't three years ago and drudge report and others help us promote
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:58.640]  the opt-out for Thanksgiving week they just said scanners are turned off which
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:02.640]  in documents came out there's no threat it's conditioning they didn't want us to
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:06.080]  have a victory like blacks going in and sitting at the lunch counter and eating
[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:09.120]  and defeating it that has just been smart back then and said here come on in
[02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:13.920]  and eat today but not in the tomorrow you see sure see because that because that
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:18.240]  was you that's what they do now with our civil rights though is they're smart
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:22.600]  about their evil is that they okay you can do it this week but we're gonna come
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:26.720]  back next time I think it's gonna be just exactly like V for vendetta there's
[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:32.120]  already an article up on on a website somewhere is a America headed for its
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:37.440]  own version of the Arab Spring like maybe this coming spring oh let me tell
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:41.880]  you with the cops when I I let him hit me attack me push me back it's all in
[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:45.120]  video I was laughing at it still you know talking to him but when I saw that
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:47.720]  day a little girl was crying they pushed her off her dad's shoulders I
[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:51.920]  literally started taking my stuff off and I said now let's go and then they
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:54.760]  gave him the order and they backed off when I was and I was I'm gonna be honest
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:28:00.240]  I was gonna attack 50 riot police personally I mean I as a man that them
[02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:03.000]  attacking that girl and it's just like in V for vendetta they're gonna pull
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.840]  something like that and that's when it's gonna start gonna hit a kid or they're
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:08.920]  gonna kill a woman or something like that it's gonna they're gonna do it on
[02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:12.960]  the wrong day and and they're gonna taste some real pain as well they should
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:17.160]  we do a pretty good job of policing ourselves the races all the stuff about
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:21.400]  racism this and that it's like blacks and whites and get along for decades
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:25.480]  now we're fine with each other it's these morons that are keeping
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:29.000]  everything stirred up because they need to keep it stirred up they need to pit
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:32.960]  the the rich against the poor and who is the who makes up the vast majority of
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:38.760]  the poor black people that's what now it is Ben Carson oh well he's just a
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:43.040]  little bit too white to be accepted by the the mainstream black community no
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:48.680]  he's a leader and Ben tries to go back and and help his community he does a
[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:52.720]  lot of things for people Colin Powell not so much he didn't go back who's that
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:56.040]  little gal who was the national security advisor can rice she didn't go back
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:29:01.000]  Bill Cosby look how he was vilified for being too white this is media doing
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:05.440]  this look it's just exactly what Abby Hoffman said and I don't normally quote
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:13.120]  radicals well actually I do you don't want to quote commies correct the truth
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:17.720]  isn't what you say it's how many people you can say it to that's where you get
[02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:25.360]  your real effect and Hoffman was correct because we are being fed the rules of
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:29.440]  their game and all they have to do is continue to repeat it and many people
[02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:34.760]  just nod and say okay oh it's so cynical when you turn on MSNBC that is pure
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:38.920]  race hustling race baiting a five-year-old should be able to tell it but
[02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:43.600]  they raise everybody in it that and of course they want to keep everybody down
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:46.920]  they don't want people to be an individual they want to be black or white
[02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:51.280]  we'll be right back with John B. Wells in your phone calls we're on the March

[02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:15.960]  people so why are the social engineers adding it to the water simple dumb down
[02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:20.960]  the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have
[02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:24.880]  been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet but we can help to get it

[02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:24.680]  thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:30.360]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ

[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:50.440]  to midnight dot com some of the top stories up on info wars dot com and this
[02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:57.200]  story is linked on drudge now Russia warns America we will respond with nukes
[02:33:57.200 --> 02:34:02.280]  and that's been in the Russian news for about half a day you would think the so
[02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:06.080]  called state-run media over here would want to pick that up it's really a shame
[02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:10.040]  that info wars notice that put that up and now drudge is carrying it that just
[02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:14.280]  shows how far behind the curve the dinosaur media is I want to talk about
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:17.920]  the media briefly with John B. Wells and had a few other headlines and get his
[02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:23.720]  take on it and go directly to your calls but John people would think that I
[02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:27.400]  would be happy not having a lot of competition like most talk show host
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:30.360]  obviously don't have other talk show host on but you guys have me on because we
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:35.560]  care about liberty and it's the same thing with the way that I promote world
[02:34:35.560 --> 02:34:39.120]  net daily or drudge report dot com or other things it's good to have company
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:42.900]  that just wants to be good old-fashioned good guys in pro america and pro
[02:34:42.900 --> 02:34:45.720]  liberty and who don't want to be criminals and who don't want to be part
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:50.440]  of a new world order I mean really we're just talking about basic liberty here
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:55.440]  they've tried to pay us as bad but that's not working anymore but they
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:59.400]  didn't report it back when Russia threatened to nuke Europe in 2008 over
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:03.000]  the Georgia thing and I'm not romanticizing Putin or Russia you know
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:09.520]  you're in trouble when you you look at somebody like Putin who's pro family and
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:13.200]  stuff and he looks like a better guy than what we've got and it's not that
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:17.640]  he's even good it's that our leaders are so evil I couldn't agree with you more
[02:35:17.640 --> 02:35:21.600]  when when Vladimir Putin looks like the good guy I think we have a problem and
[02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:26.160]  and as far as the dinosaur media is concerned you know let's take a let's
[02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:29.640]  take the guy who really is pretty much the godfather talk radio his first name
[02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:35.880]  begins with an R big guy you know it's not that I disagree I agree with much of
[02:35:35.880 --> 02:35:40.160]  what he says but the thing is is he's been saying it for so long that you're
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:45.240]  almost numb to it he there we look this is not a one-man movement this this is
[02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:50.680]  there's got to be exactly how do you get people out of their trance you know
[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:54.600]  what I think what you do is convince them first of all you are not a victim
[02:35:54.600 --> 02:36:00.280]  you have been led to believe you are a victim but you're not you have power you
[02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:04.680]  have most assuredly have power and when the and when the authorities that are
[02:36:04.680 --> 02:36:10.640]  there to act in your interest begin to oppress you watch what happens when you
[02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:15.000]  push back oh there'll be a lot of bluster and a lot of bowing up and a lot of
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:18.960]  swagger and then they're gonna do something stupid and when they do the
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:24.160]  citizenry has to take responsibility for its actions and they must respond and
[02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:28.560]  when they do you'll see the unjust authoritarian state back off real quick
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:32.800]  and it's always happened that way they'll try and crush you with power but
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:36.200]  you don't let them in the first time that they fail and you don't retreat
[02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:39.760]  because you got sick to your stomach and you gave up too early in the fight when
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:44.760]  you advance if you take your weapon and they back off don't bat and don't you
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:49.920]  back off you advance you cannot attack and defend at the same time if they
[02:36:49.920 --> 02:36:54.880]  attack you yield to it but when that force is done you go back you go back
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:58.960]  through the courts you go back through whatever it means is necessary as
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:03.320]  granted you by the Constitution and don't you ever let this Constitution go
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:07.520]  because if you do you're done and don't let go of your faith because if you do
[02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:11.840]  it'll be replaced with anything they want to replace it with I mean and it
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:15.320]  has to start at the schools how can we do this you become your own little
[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:18.560]  intelligence network you look around your neighborhood and see what these
[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:21.640]  cameras doing here then you get the rest of neighbors and just go on down to
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:25.080]  City Hall and go to a council meeting cause a disruption ask them why are
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:27.840]  you doing this when I'm a crime in our neighborhood why are you monitoring us we
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:31.840]  want these down now or we're gonna fire every one of you next election and then
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:35.120]  if they don't take them down I guess sometimes cameras get broken sometimes
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:39.320]  they do you know things happen hey big we have large pieces of hail that fall
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:42.440]  from the sky sometimes they break things like that but it bothers me to drive
[02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:45.760]  down just a regular street where nobody's doing anything it's not a high crime
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:49.880]  area no gang members milling around flashing signs each other and I see a
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:53.880]  camera up there that's got a badge on it and says police and it's one of those
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:56.400]  multiple cameras we can see all that I'm just like remember when they were first
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:00.280]  putting them in they said oh it's for traffic but it will always and again I
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:04.920]  can drive to an area of Austin right now and find hookers and crack they're not
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:09.440]  stopping they just keep it in an area and then they use it to go around and take
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:12.800]  all the rest of the rights and again ladies and gentlemen at the top it's
[02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:15.440]  rotten we're not saying people mid-level low-level or bad on average
[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:18.480]  in fact that's what's been holding it back is they can't get the military and
[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:22.720]  police to carry all this out but just by repetitive pushing they're doing it I
[02:38:22.720 --> 02:38:29.160]  want to go to calls but I said I would go through some of this other news here's
[02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:33.520]  just some of it okay we are Colin Powell endorses single-payer health care system
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:39.160]  some members of Congress want to take Obamacare a step further and now you
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:44.080]  get Republican leaders and others joining with Bernie Sanders who's a
[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:49.880]  socialist basically a communist wanting to bring in this was always the plan
[02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:55.040]  but mess up the old system and we said this we're proven right now and they're
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:59.560]  doing it yeah mess up the old system which was every system has its problems
[02:38:59.560 --> 02:39:04.120]  but you but you you mess up the old system and it's now it's destroyed so
[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:08.480]  here let's try this this is a well this is a stopgap measure it needs some work
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:11.840]  but it'll be fine for now it's not fine for now it's not fine at all well they
[02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:15.400]  messed it up with government to begin with absolutely absolutely and the and
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:19.560]  any time gosh look it's become cliche and this is another one of those cliches
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:22.520]  Alex I don't think anybody pays attention to when government starts
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:27.280]  running things it gets messed up as long as individually there and because you
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:29.920]  don't have choice anymore to go across street to a better hospital it's all
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:34.000]  run by the same they crave running our lives and you don't have the initiative
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:37.520]  to improve anything because it's government now so it's permanent and
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:42.440]  you all you can't fight City Hall you certainly can't fight Capitol Hill so
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:46.440]  might as well just roll with it it's it's it's it is like communism because
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:49.800]  me look at the alcoholism rate under the Soviet Union 90% of the men were
[02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:54.080]  hardcore alcoholics because there was no reason there was no motivation to do
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:58.320]  anything or dream anything or creating a thing or produce a good product there
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:02.280]  was only the threat of being beaten if you didn't do the minimums but there were
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:06.680]  there was no reason no motivation whatsoever to go the extra mile in any
[02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:10.040]  department same thing happened in South Africa and the technocrats have already
[02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:14.000]  created their offshore systems where they're exempt where they live in total
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:18.840]  freedom no taxes no regulations above the law and they put us under this it's
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:23.000]  just it's a no-brainer we shouldn't be going under this people you have power
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:28.680]  you you have much more power than you think but be judicious in the use of
[02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:32.680]  your power don't be don't use the stupid power use the smart absolutely we're
[02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:36.880]  gonna rush through more news that first calls John M who's a police officer should
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:43.160]  have gone to him earlier and then Greg Ashley David and others up first is David

[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:53.480]  hey Alex are you doing hey John hey basically I wanted with the latest
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:58.760]  coming out about the NSA and World of Warcraft and then spine on that people
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:02.800]  aren't realizing whenever they're accepting permissions such as downloading
[02:41:02.800 --> 02:41:08.760]  Angry Birds Star Wars they asked for permission for to turn on your camera
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:12.680]  without your knowledge I mean it gets you to the point where on my Android phone
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:16.440]  I have black electrical tape on both my cameras I mean it's getting pretty bad
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:20.200]  and people are just giving into this stuff just so they can play a game and
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:23.600]  they don't really realize it because half the people don't even read the
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:28.960]  permissions you know no no all the time I see messages on the it's not a phone
[02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:32.520]  it's a computer tracker system a hundred times bigger than the biggest main
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:36.720]  frame 20 years ago you're more powerful it says permission to turn on your web
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:41.680]  camera we want and they still just do it yeah this is a trojan horse now I at
[02:41:41.680 --> 02:41:44.720]  least admit it and use it against them to shoot videos on the road and stuff but
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:48.880]  this is how they ubiquitously build it into everything and it was in the
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:53.280]  telecommunications act in 96 I warned everybody because I could read it but
[02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:56.120]  people like all the phone ain't gonna listen to us even when it's off
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:01.200]  shut up you crazy nut I'm like here's the document shut up you un-American stop
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:04.920]  saying my government would do something like that and now it's like okay they
[02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:09.360]  need to listen to us you know well you don't need the device anyway I mean
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:12.640]  really who needs to play Angry Birds I got an idea read a book read a history
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:16.720]  book try and get one that hasn't been climb up a hill go out on a date go go
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:20.800]  to take a cooking class exactly throw the bloody thing you want a camera get a
[02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:24.880]  little camera you don't need it you don't need a phone it tracks you it
[02:42:24.880 --> 02:42:27.960]  listens to you it photographs you you can't believe the stuff that goes on
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:32.280]  with my phone and and phones of my close associates well you can but but people
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:35.520]  would say oh you're making it this stuff up it's like no I have actually seen
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:43.040]  text messages go to my assistant's phone that I didn't send pardon me I had it
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:47.080]  I had it backwards I got texts from my assistant that at the moment that I read
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:51.460]  it I have a story reversed I'm sorry that was another incident I muddled it I said
[02:42:51.460 --> 02:42:56.680]  this was not sent by this person I said did you send this no I said well I got
[02:42:56.680 --> 02:42:59.400]  him right here and I said let me see your phone when we got back together I
[02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:04.200]  said look at this and it was a one of them was I'm in class and I thought class
[02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:09.840]  and then the next one was sorry busy now call back later and I thought that is
[02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:13.640]  not a message this person would have sent me worded like that but there it
[02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:17.560]  was well also they built a second internet to spy on us with so it also
[02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:22.520]  screws everything up because all the spy tech it's having to do two things they
[02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:26.280]  also that's what dr. Stallman talks about all the top experts on this is
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:30.360]  it's all screwed up and you have to pay the extra price when the things really
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:34.400]  designed to control your life yep you so so that you it should cost half as much
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:38.400]  and to show how cold-blooded they are they all have slave factories while they
[02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:41.640]  lecture us all day how we're racist because we won't turn our guns in great
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:46.000]  points David M on the west coast is a police officer let's talk about police
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:51.080]  and you're on the air with John B. Wells and Alex Jones go ahead yeah good
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:54.320]  morning fellas how are you oh we're we're trying we're trying to live in a
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:59.520]  free country how about you yeah well I'm with you hey just talking on the
[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:07.280]  instinctive shooting been a police officer for 16 years I'm I'm a constitutional
[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:11.400]  police officer I work in a smaller community so I'm work one-on-one with a
[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:15.000]  lot of my community members and I live there in the community so I'm bested
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:20.160]  I'm an old-time copper I got into the line of work to serve my you change old
[02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:24.120]  ladies tires you go to domestic disturbances you're a servant of the
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:28.680]  people you know and that's the thing is these big city coppers and a lot of them
[02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:31.760]  are good guys but they laugh I mean for instance a couple weeks ago I made the
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:36.400]  paper because I pushed a lady that her electric wheelchair broke down I pushed
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:40.320]  her a quarter mile to her house she was about 300 pounds I mean I was tired at
[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:44.840]  the end but you know what most of us cops we do stuff like that the negative
[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:48.280]  stuff is the stuff that's reported the positive stuff is where you rarely hear
[02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:52.640]  about I was at the beach and an old woman who was paralyzed in her legs her
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:56.600]  her thing had conked out and gotten stuck then turned out it was broken and
[02:44:56.600 --> 02:45:02.280]  I I drug her about 300 yards through the sand and almost probably had a heart
[02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:05.360]  attack it was really hard I couldn't imagine doing as far as you did but
[02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:09.200]  again but it's a normal thing to want to help an old lady so I get something
[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:14.800]  heroic but but good job but see being normal now is heroic well that's the
[02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:19.920]  thing fellas is listen I got into this work to be a servant and that's how I
[02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:23.920]  look at myself I'm a public servant and with the instinctive shooting listen
[02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:30.640]  back in 1998 my fellow officer of mine hesitated on shooting a guy that pulled
[02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:34.760]  guns on him and because he thought they were cap guns and he lost his life the
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:38.360]  backup officer luckily shot the guy didn't kill him but put two in his chest
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:43.480]  now the guy's doing life but listen when we see a threat I mean a lot of those
[02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:49.880]  airsoft guns look real and I don't care if you're 40 years old or you know 15 if
[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:54.400]  you point a weapon at me listen I'm gonna take care of business and we are
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:59.400]  trained to put web put bullets down range until the thread is gone no I know
[02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:02.240]  I mean you're not a devil worshipping Democrat either because you had
[02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:05.840]  instinctive shooting video games with devil worship and being a part of the
[02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:10.160]  Democratic Party your Adam Lanza and almost every other mass shooter was a
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:12.560]  Democrat and I'm not even Republican Democrat I'm just sick of these
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:16.680]  Democrats and I understand the police are not devil worshipping Democrats who
[02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:20.920]  then take instincts of shooting I just I just read this guy in the SWAT
[02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:25.760]  magazine saying do something even if it didn't right and I'm just like and I
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:31.440]  mean I get I get it I understand that okay but this particular airsoft did not
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:34.640]  look real it had a middle that was clear and all this but I guess it didn't look
[02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:41.080]  enough like it my whole point is is that it's a screwed up society and I mean
[02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:44.680]  look at how neighbors call the cops on people if they see him putting a gun in
[02:46:44.680 --> 02:46:47.880]  their car even though the guns legal I mean I'm sure you you probably get those
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:55.960]  calls don't you we get all kinds of calls I mean it's just but I want you
[02:46:55.960 --> 02:47:01.840]  I want I want you guys to understand something is that the society has changed
[02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:05.440]  and the police the role of a police officer's changed we're not only there
[02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:09.600]  to protect the serve anymore my more counselors were dads were we're best
[02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:14.000]  friends you know people call us for everything and this is what I was taught
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:18.760]  when I was first started in law enforcement 94 know by what a 40 you
[02:47:18.760 --> 02:47:24.280]  act it's never right to do wrong so when in doubt you don't do it it's common
[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:31.200]  sense let me ask you a question have you ever run into anybody in a police
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:36.520]  officer's uniform that you were convinced has joined the force as a legal
[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:41.680]  method of killing people in your 16 years have you run into any psychos that
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:45.960]  eventually got kind of ushered out of the departments because we know human
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:49.920]  beings I mean just because your policemen doesn't mean that you know the the the
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:54.120]  the heavenly orchestra sang as you were anointed with your your badge I mean we
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:57.840]  know that your that your people subject to those Dallas Sheriff's deputies look
[02:47:57.840 --> 02:48:02.200]  like thugs yeah but have you run into anybody that you felt like was had gotten
[02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:06.280]  into the force because he stood a good chance being able to cap somebody kill
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:11.640]  him and get away with it I wouldn't say that I say I run into what we call badge
[02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:16.400]  heavy guys to get into it because I agree with Alex said this in the past guys
[02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:21.160]  that were picked on in school or or you know feel like I've got some power at
[02:48:21.160 --> 02:48:25.080]  least in my area the area I work those guys don't really they don't make it
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:29.000]  because they end up violating policy and then they're ushered out but I haven't
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:32.720]  been I haven't personally now well I'm found usually smaller departments are
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:36.000]  better on average then you can also get a boss hog department it's the big ones
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:39.640]  that are either good or bad I've seen and I mean you know take New York I run a
[02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:42.120]  lot of cops with their little listeners but also I've been to big events and the
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:47.680]  cops act like goons I mean hats on sideways smoking cigarettes I mean with
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:51.640]  their bellies hanging out I mean it's just like and this is what unions end up
[02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:55.040]  doing and I think that's the issue is the unaccountability and bad guys being
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:59.560]  protected all right good to hear from you appreciate the call him let's go
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:05.680]  ahead and talk to Greg in Oklahoma you're on the air go ahead go ahead Greg

[02:49:43.280 --> 02:49:48.440]  started to wake up spiritually and then then mine started to unlock I was away
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:52.360]  from the body price for a long time but I'm back and now I can send myself a
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:58.800]  soldier for Christ and I'm full fight every single day but John I was gonna
[02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:03.040]  ask you I was reading that you're into martial arts and since I've woken up
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:05.600]  but definitely had a lot more aggression I'm like a channel and a lot

[02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:44.680]  last thing that you do it's mind body and spirit coordination and calming and
[02:50:44.680 --> 02:50:48.440]  equilibrium of course as part of the human condition you should be able to

[02:54:18.680 --> 02:54:22.400]  stations carry it to finish up their bodies calls I got all this other news I
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:28.680]  want to get to there's just so much of it here 200,000 people apply to be first
[02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:34.680]  to live on Mars that's all from CNN I'd go if it wasn't communist or socialist
[02:54:34.680 --> 02:54:38.200]  I mean that's just legalized theft going if you have ambitions for being one of
[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:40.920]  the first people on Mars listen up a Dutch company says it's moving along
[02:54:40.920 --> 02:54:45.280]  its plan to send for a lucky four lucky earthlings to colonize the red planet
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:49.320]  yeah I think the first mission won't fare too well the catch they won't ever
[02:54:49.320 --> 02:54:53.280]  come back yeah no kidding what do you make of that John because there's a
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:56.640]  breakaway civilization as we know we know that the government's 40 years ahead
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:00.920]  of what they show us they use our money to play God underground bases all of it
[02:55:00.920 --> 02:55:03.560]  what do you make of all this I mean how advanced do you think they really are
[02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:06.720]  because they act like I don't even care that we exist now you mean they're how
[02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:10.600]  advanced so I think the government really yes I think they're look I but I
[02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:13.440]  really believe this I'm gonna go way out there in a limb and people gonna roll
[02:55:13.440 --> 02:55:17.120]  our eyes at this one but it's like I'm serious about this this UFO thing is
[02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:22.280]  undeniable and the Nazis did have some major major projects going on that have
[02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:26.080]  turned into many of the modern era call they had my grandfather saw jet
[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:29.920]  airplanes when he was flying bombers over Europe they were attacked by jet
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:32.920]  airplanes you wouldn't tell me anything else thing is is those some smart cats
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:37.160]  and they went to Kamler I think his name was he they reverse engineered this
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:42.040]  thing that crashed out there in 37 or 38 maybe even as early as 36 and there
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:45.240]  been Bell shaped out to dig locker this thing that they had one of them come
[02:55:45.240 --> 02:55:49.320]  down and in the United States so I believe that we are not only working with
[02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:52.080]  data and technology I think we're probably working with the aliens
[02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:56.480]  themselves and I have seen these photo in fact I'll show it I'll show it to you
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:56:00.560]  later it's on I've got on my iPhone somebody near and dear to me credibility
[02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:03.200]  absolutely beyond reproach there's nothing faked about this when you see
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:05.760]  this you're gonna go now there's something you don't see every day and
[02:56:05.760 --> 02:56:10.360]  indeed that is true so I took a photo just to the sky I think it was pretty
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:14.360]  it took like six or seven of them and you can look at it and it's like a
[02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:18.920]  planetoid it's not a lens flare you can see stuff on it and then it's gone
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:22.760]  after I took like five photos of it I've got the photo it's just really it was
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:26.720]  there then it disappeared and then it began to glow in the same spot and then
[02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:29.560]  here came these little streaks of light going across they look like somebody
[02:56:29.560 --> 02:56:32.560]  operating a spotlight really quick but you can't operate a spot like that quick
[02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:35.480]  and cover that kind of track at that range to make that spotlight these are
[02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:38.760]  not spotlights well here's an example they lined up and all fed into this
[02:56:38.760 --> 02:56:41.560]  thing here's an example we were driving from Fairfield Texas where we got a
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:46.080]  ranch nearby back to Dallas when I was about six or seven visiting grandma and
[02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:49.280]  my dad saw this they were having like I never saw army tanks on the street
[02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:53.600]  tearing up some of the asphalt on the on the shoulder and troops and and then we
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:58.080]  saw stealth fighters this is like decades before the stealth fighter came out but
[02:56:58.080 --> 02:57:02.160]  even longer but now that I have that image always of two of them turning
[02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:05.160]  their afterburners but they were flying over a field like 500 yards away and
[02:57:05.160 --> 02:57:09.560]  then they and I'm and I was like what is that my dad goes some kind of secret
[02:57:09.560 --> 02:57:14.720]  aircraft but the point is is that is that that was I was like six years old
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:18.920]  that was like 30 something five years ago we tried to get the director of the
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:24.120]  United States Air Force Space Command on the program on coast one night and
[02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:30.440]  Jag said no without a PR officer there are no so those guys have been busy they
[02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:34.040]  got an unlimited budget and I suspect that there's a reason we have a United
[02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:37.840]  States Air Force Space Command there's probably a lot of you know space cadets
[02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:41.040]  and commanders flying around up there on a regular base oh there are that space
[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:44.640]  command is I talked to Marine Corps captain who they later start a computer
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:48.680]  company but he was in space command he goes look man it's all crazy and and
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:52.000]  and and that's the thing he says there's just NASA is a complete front
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:56.440]  absolutely that's like oh there's no more space program huh I go back to sleep
[02:57:56.440 --> 02:57:59.880]  well that was the PR deal was that no we're gonna with Air Force is getting
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:04.080]  rid of it we're gonna give it to NASA and we're not gonna do anything well by
[02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:07.360]  the way I talk about space command folks think I'm making it up you can go to the
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:11.920]  space command website yeah well DARPA is his Air Force with a little bit of Navy
[02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:17.080]  but mostly Air Force so there it is I think they're 50 years out Alex at least
[02:58:17.080 --> 02:58:22.920]  yeah because if if if I was five six I don't know six seven years old and these
[02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:27.280]  were like gray and green they don't like the stealth fighters you see now they
[02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:30.360]  looked even bigger they weren't stealth bombers just like and then all the
[02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:34.320]  sudden turn their burners on was gone by planes to jets back in the 30s and
[02:58:34.320 --> 02:58:38.680]  40s and not even 10 years and now nothing develops nothing advances except for
[02:58:38.680 --> 02:58:41.960]  little spy models they give us stay with us folks your calls are coming up

[03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:37.360]  alright it's final segment I have so much news I didn't get to here Edward
[03:00:37.360 --> 03:00:43.760]  Snowden the dark prophet the new H7N9 bird flu was this drugs without losing
[03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:48.640]  ability to spread listen I know a lot of people they're dying right now from
[03:00:48.640 --> 03:00:51.880]  stuff in their chest and it's not flu they're calling it that but we've even
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:56.200]  confirmed it's bacterial there's a lot of weird crap going on and that's the
[03:00:56.200 --> 03:01:02.320]  thing it's not just a breakaway government that John B. Wells that that is
[03:01:02.320 --> 03:01:07.160]  you know doing things for the betterment of the good it they think they're God
[03:01:07.160 --> 03:01:11.720]  and their predatory and they want to teach kids two plus two equals five with
[03:01:11.720 --> 03:01:15.720]  common core these are bad people yeah they are and the thing is is I've
[03:01:15.720 --> 03:01:21.240]  often wondered why see on the local level that we have the great unwashed and
[03:01:21.240 --> 03:01:27.040]  down here sometimes members of our particular class of people will we
[03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:31.960]  resent those who have done well they have large houses and nice cars and and
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:36.120]  some of us cannot resist raking a key across a nice paint job which of course
[03:01:36.120 --> 03:01:40.360]  is petty and cowardly and you shouldn't do it but there's a reverse to that and
[03:01:40.360 --> 03:01:43.800]  that is that the ones who many of the ones who have succeeded and really have
[03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:47.760]  amassed this this wealth and the power that goes along with it really look down
[03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:52.760]  on the working-class people is just like you can do a job for me but that's
[03:01:52.760 --> 03:01:56.320]  that's the extent of my association with you I want nothing to do with you I
[03:01:56.320 --> 03:01:59.880]  got no empathy for you I got no sympathy with you and I found it's almost the
[03:01:59.880 --> 03:02:03.640]  same attitude because people wear their arrogance and their dislike of other
[03:02:03.640 --> 03:02:10.320]  people as they're worth because they're really insecure oh yes yes well human
[03:02:10.320 --> 03:02:14.760]  beings are rife within security at every level and look at the and in fact I
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:18.360]  think the higher up you go in the authority on the authority ladder I
[03:02:18.360 --> 03:02:23.160]  think the greater your insecurity becomes but but for many more reasons I
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:26.720]  mean you have much more to fear everybody well I mean as you do get more
[03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:32.160]  successful more powerful but I've resisted this people do make stuff up and
[03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:35.720]  attack you and resent you so I could see how you could become predatory against
[03:02:35.720 --> 03:02:39.600]  them but I just won't do it well you know I am already the email box and
[03:02:39.600 --> 03:02:43.240]  there'll be like 13,000 in there and I tell people you know I am alternately a
[03:02:43.240 --> 03:02:48.560]  Zionist a Nazi a liberal nutcase a right-wing nutcase you know a religious
[03:02:48.560 --> 03:02:54.240]  fanatic or an anti-Christ it just depends on what part of what sentence
[03:02:54.240 --> 03:03:00.680]  they think they heard so I love how I always see people saying you've never
[03:03:00.680 --> 03:03:04.320]  covered the Federal Reserve or you've never because one interview or one
[03:03:04.320 --> 03:03:09.920]  video is on another subject yeah only 50 times is that you you just didn't see
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:14.160]  it you know and then of course there are people that that will say can you give
[03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:17.480]  me the phone number and the email address and maybe the physical address of
[03:03:17.480 --> 03:03:20.880]  so-and-so it's like can't really do that brother but you could probably have
[03:03:20.880 --> 03:03:24.200]  get that information or get in contact with your website would that be okay
[03:03:24.200 --> 03:03:27.800]  and the boy here comes so that that's why I say on the program we use Zionist
[03:03:27.800 --> 03:03:32.400]  pig absolutely we go by German rules you can say whatever whatever you want but
[03:03:32.400 --> 03:03:38.640]  you must be polite so exactly oh is that German rules yeah that's the German
[03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:42.000]  language rule you may say anything you you you wish but you must they inserted
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:45.520]  beta every once in a while or which is not acceptable so if you like say
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:49.480]  something like I totally disagree with you and think you're a traitor but
[03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:52.840]  politely or how do you say it well you can say it that way and then you'll get
[03:03:52.840 --> 03:03:55.840]  a polite response like well I believe that you are entirely incorrect do some
[03:03:55.840 --> 03:03:59.200]  more research and contact me again once you squared yourself away and not until
[03:03:59.200 --> 03:04:03.400]  wow I want to keep doing some more overdrive we got one more 12-minute

[03:08:48.840 --> 03:08:54.240]  point separated alabama from indiana on just released 2013 state scorecard the
[03:08:54.240 --> 03:08:57.960]  pop of the brady campaign it's all about they failed isn't it shameful from
[03:08:57.960 --> 03:09:02.160]  alabama dot com and then here's another one study suggests nsa can legally
[03:09:02.160 --> 03:09:06.200]  access majority of american phone data and they're putting out all these
[03:09:06.200 --> 03:09:09.320]  things saying oh we're allowed to listen everything you do without a warrant so
[03:09:09.320 --> 03:09:14.240]  they've gone from denying it to saying we're allowed to more horse pucky so
[03:09:14.240 --> 03:09:18.240]  your take on this tactic of everyone knows the male being the head of the
[03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:21.920]  household is bad the state's supposed to be the head of the household everyone
[03:09:21.920 --> 03:09:29.000]  knows it's the name father or mother is is abusive to other people don't use it
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:33.440]  i mean these are flaming authoritarians who we should tell to shut up
[03:09:33.440 --> 03:09:39.480]  lately you know i played a old song by a mark farner and grand funk railroad
[03:09:39.480 --> 03:09:44.320]  called sins a good man's brother and one of the lines is it in it is you might
[03:09:44.320 --> 03:09:48.680]  think this is a little bit crazy but i don't think you should be so lazy and
[03:09:48.680 --> 03:09:54.520]  people are lazy look it's it's understandable everything is for
[03:09:54.520 --> 03:09:59.440]  convenience a luxury car a luxury home a luxury this luxury that luxury meals
[03:09:59.440 --> 03:10:03.960]  luxury vacations everything's a luxury oh look what you have that old school
[03:10:03.960 --> 03:10:10.120]  font you need this one this is really yeah look it's that it goes back to even
[03:10:10.120 --> 03:10:17.080]  king crimson's 21st century schizoid man nothing he has he really needs so much
[03:10:17.080 --> 03:10:20.600]  of this is distraction there was just an article recently i think it was just
[03:10:20.600 --> 03:10:24.320]  yesterday which he really needs a good woman which really needs good kids which
[03:10:24.320 --> 03:10:28.440]  you really need is good health not all this crud and spend some good time with
[03:10:28.440 --> 03:10:32.120]  some good people i mean there was just a report that if you take pictures
[03:10:32.120 --> 03:10:36.400]  continuously your brain says well i don't need to remember this moment so the
[03:10:36.400 --> 03:10:39.800]  only memories you will have will effectively be i mean if this is taken
[03:10:39.800 --> 03:10:43.680]  to an extreme will be in no they're admitting it's it's reprogramming
[03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:47.400]  everybody's brain and not in a good way folks you know you have to ask yourself
[03:10:47.400 --> 03:10:52.040]  a question at some point which is do all of these things that i have really
[03:10:52.040 --> 03:10:56.760]  enhanced productivity or is that just a line that hey they fed me it's not the
[03:10:56.760 --> 03:10:59.880]  son i'm older i used to before smartphones even a few years ago know
[03:10:59.880 --> 03:11:04.880]  how to remember all the numbers now i'm just used to it being there it's like
[03:11:04.880 --> 03:11:07.880]  calculators people don't know how to do math now there was another report out
[03:11:07.880 --> 03:11:11.000]  recently within the last few days it said people who can just say i'm not
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:14.200]  going to handle i'm not going to even read the text now let alone respond to it
[03:11:14.200 --> 03:11:18.160]  that they're more content okay well i don't know if this is the terror waves or
[03:11:18.160 --> 03:11:20.840]  whatever coming through the phone or anything else but maybe it's just i got
[03:11:20.840 --> 03:11:25.240]  to say i'm more and more i'm just only turning these on for events using it you
[03:11:25.240 --> 03:11:29.360]  know take photos or video for media because it is a good tool oh yeah but
[03:11:29.360 --> 03:11:33.280]  the screen everybody kept saying my eyes my eyes these things are so bright now
[03:11:33.280 --> 03:11:36.160]  they're horrible if you wake up in the middle of the night and turn that thing
[03:11:36.160 --> 03:11:39.280]  on just to check the time it's like guys almost like it being hit me the eyes
[03:11:39.280 --> 03:11:42.280]  with a some burning laser beam or something yeah there's i'm telling you
[03:11:42.280 --> 03:11:45.880]  of course anything they give us is to hurt us well this came from a slave camp
[03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:48.920]  you don't think it's gonna i mean it's it's microwaving your brain it's frying
[03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:52.480]  your eyeballs and i looked it up and the type of light it puts out is literally
[03:11:52.480 --> 03:11:56.240]  frying your eyeballs so an english scientist said 50% of the people will
[03:11:56.240 --> 03:12:03.120]  see a serious decrease in their visual acuity over the next 10-15 years from
[03:12:03.120 --> 03:12:06.240]  these screens and you'll notice they're literally blinding us while they
[03:12:06.240 --> 03:12:10.880]  microwave us you know the weaponized water food media you know man just
[03:12:10.880 --> 03:12:14.800]  flying down here i saw all of this really kind of like squalor out there
[03:12:14.800 --> 03:12:18.240]  and i'm going i'm coming out of Dallas looking at everything and looking at how
[03:12:18.240 --> 03:12:22.240]  used and kind of dirty it is mean Dallas is a great town Austin's a great town
[03:12:22.240 --> 03:12:27.360]  Dallas does look more like third world when i live there it doesn't look pretty
[03:12:27.360 --> 03:12:31.320]  like it used to it looks industrial it looks like the hideous horrible
[03:12:31.320 --> 03:12:37.520]  futuristic industrial robocop yeah that was depicted in movies before and not
[03:12:37.520 --> 03:12:42.520]  it with as good a fashion sense either in some ways it's it's ugly so maybe
[03:12:42.520 --> 03:12:46.080]  what we need is less of everything and just refine the little bit that we have
[03:12:46.080 --> 03:12:49.900]  how you know like the Sikhs they carry five or six things and they're all
[03:12:49.900 --> 03:12:52.840]  excellent they got a comb for their hair they got the short pants for combat
[03:12:52.840 --> 03:12:56.680]  they got a knife they got this they got that but that's it and you look it's
[03:12:56.680 --> 03:13:00.200]  just like i go back to movies because they've supplanted the great books
[03:13:00.200 --> 03:13:04.720]  Tyler Durden fight club i'm sure he's not the first one to say this but that
[03:13:04.720 --> 03:13:09.440]  character said the stuff that you own owns you and and that that phone right
[03:13:09.440 --> 03:13:16.320]  there is is absolutely the best example it owns you and all your friends i like
[03:13:16.320 --> 03:13:23.200]  facebook it's a good tool but that just ensures that we only use it literally as
[03:13:23.200 --> 03:13:26.600]  a conduit to jack into the matrix and attack the enemy we pretty much we know
[03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:30.120]  it's a but people that say who their boyfriend is what they're doing we're
[03:13:30.120 --> 03:13:34.160]  going to eat and they show it's at their house so the thieves can rob them i mean
[03:13:34.160 --> 03:13:38.840]  it's just idiocy like trying to show everyone who they are man it's sick well
[03:13:38.840 --> 03:13:42.240]  you know and and facebook is a good tool i mean we i've got a facebook page up
[03:13:42.240 --> 03:13:47.480]  there but it's for it's for us caravan to midnight and a little bit for coast but
[03:13:47.480 --> 03:13:50.160]  you know i don't i don't like to mix those up too much because i'm not sure
[03:13:50.160 --> 03:13:53.720]  they would like that and you know whatever but the thing is is that's okay
[03:13:53.720 --> 03:13:57.480]  because these people don't know each other but i think you put you do yourself
[03:13:57.480 --> 03:14:02.280]  a real disservice by having all of your friends or in other words everybody you
[03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:07.280]  could either get a help or aid from in time of crisis to be on a list because
[03:14:07.280 --> 03:14:10.640]  they're all your friends on your facebook page but think how there was
[03:14:10.640 --> 03:14:15.120]  exactly think how there was privacy just ten years ago to a certain extent it's
[03:14:15.120 --> 03:14:20.520]  all gone now it is and you know frankly i like answering machines they're not
[03:14:20.520 --> 03:14:26.360]  easy to find but you can find them if we're no other reason then nobody can
[03:14:26.360 --> 03:14:32.440]  prove you actually got the message well i like to go back to you know the way it
[03:14:32.440 --> 03:14:34.920]  was before all this and i think there and it's already happening there's gonna
[03:14:34.920 --> 03:14:38.520]  be a big retro movement towards going back people figure it out but i'm
[03:14:38.520 --> 03:14:42.720]  telling you these new phones i've turned down the lowest setting of brightness
[03:14:42.720 --> 03:14:47.560]  it still hurts my eyes i mean this is a little devil machine let's go to the
[03:14:47.560 --> 03:14:52.960]  calls john in pa thank you for holding you're on the air go ahead i to better
[03:14:52.960 --> 03:14:58.480]  understand mandela i think people on a search of why imperialism mourns
[03:14:58.480 --> 03:15:04.600]  mandela and another search for lies concerning the soviet union that why
[03:15:04.600 --> 03:15:11.440]  why imperialism mourns mandela shows that since he has been released he is
[03:15:11.440 --> 03:15:16.280]  completely rejected and ditched along with the a and c any of his former
[03:15:16.280 --> 03:15:21.320]  socialist positions he has instituted a free market total giveaways to them
[03:15:21.320 --> 03:15:25.880]  international corporations the mining institutions he signed a secret deal
[03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:30.600]  with the international monetary fund he's instituted ultra capitalism there
[03:15:30.600 --> 03:15:35.560]  the opposite of socialism and communism there and i think you know this but you
[03:15:35.560 --> 03:15:40.280]  got it you use this let me say this john john john john's a communist and he's
[03:15:40.280 --> 03:15:43.040]  been calling for about 10 years i'll put him on hold and go back to him and skip
[03:15:43.040 --> 03:15:46.560]  his break go to the bottom of the hour they let john be wells gets to get some
[03:15:46.560 --> 03:15:49.840]  lunch because i know it's time to be in there for two three hours i'm gonna say
[03:15:49.840 --> 03:15:54.000]  this i've actually heard randomly when i listen to a show i might listen to like
[03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:59.680]  once a year was on local station heard him call in from ohio or wherever it was
[03:15:59.680 --> 03:16:03.920]  at the time and literally say i'm a government agent cia all this other
[03:16:03.920 --> 03:16:11.080]  crap what you have is which is not true buddy so just because people say stuff
[03:16:11.080 --> 03:16:17.800]  doesn't mean it's true and my issue is i don't like crony capitalism and i know
[03:16:17.800 --> 03:16:21.760]  the big money came in and use socialism they did build public housing
[03:16:21.760 --> 03:16:25.640]  everywhere they did have wealth redistribution they did do all that and
[03:16:25.640 --> 03:16:30.560]  it did take the middle-class money away and take the black tribes that had their
[03:16:30.560 --> 03:16:34.800]  own land and and unionize it and mix it in and i've actually studied south
[03:16:34.800 --> 03:16:40.440]  africa and nelson mandela was a racist when he was a communist and he's still a
[03:16:40.440 --> 03:16:46.600]  communist and i get that the big banks and the big money uses communism as a
[03:16:46.600 --> 03:16:50.840]  control mechanism and that never delivers communism i know communism's the
[03:16:50.840 --> 03:16:56.200]  country never discovered i know the cia put malin i know our the rockefellers
[03:16:56.200 --> 03:17:01.280]  funded linen now i bet you'll go john mert society not true but i know it's
[03:17:01.280 --> 03:17:06.240]  true it came out congressional hearings it was declassified so you can just say
[03:17:06.240 --> 03:17:11.320]  that's your precious commie world is a banker creation to create false
[03:17:11.320 --> 03:17:18.280]  revolution i want renaissance i want local control i want true choice go ahead
[03:17:18.280 --> 03:17:21.640]  and make your point job as you call in every year or so and it's just so
[03:17:21.640 --> 03:17:26.200]  irritating because you call you know i've heard you say stuff about me and
[03:17:26.200 --> 03:17:29.920]  doesn't bother me that you're saying that stuff about me more of it fact call
[03:17:29.920 --> 03:17:34.200]  everywhere and lie about me makes folks tune in but i just want you to know
[03:17:34.200 --> 03:17:40.480]  you're full of prunes go ahead well you know you have a claim to be an
[03:17:40.480 --> 03:17:46.120]  anti-establishmentarianism but you every day obsessively push the most extreme
[03:17:46.120 --> 03:17:51.640]  version of operation walking birds cia anti-communist propaganda a hundred
[03:17:51.640 --> 03:17:55.840]  times about magnified of the kinds of of love hey buddy have you seen what
[03:17:55.840 --> 03:18:01.360]  communism produces hell listen listen i know what i know what you say it does

[03:18:04.920 --> 03:18:09.320]  have on your program for its job job hold on so he wants to plug commie
[03:18:09.320 --> 03:18:14.640]  websites let me let me let me let me submit a proposition to you
[03:18:14.640 --> 03:18:19.080]  communism is the ultimate crony capitalism because it's a way smaller
[03:18:19.080 --> 03:18:24.760]  club all of the all of the top dogs in any communist setup they got the best
[03:18:24.760 --> 03:18:29.560]  houses the best cars and the best this the best food and the best babes or guys
[03:18:29.560 --> 03:18:34.040]  whatever they prefer and it's just a smaller club it's like if i don't like
[03:18:34.040 --> 03:18:39.200]  mandela it doesn't mean i like apartheid if i don't like communism it
[03:18:39.200 --> 03:18:43.280]  doesn't mean i like crony capitalism correct i'm sorry go ahead john i'm

[03:19:16.400 --> 03:19:20.960]  it well the point i made is people should check fascist bird society and see
[03:19:20.960 --> 03:19:24.960]  his connections to the most rogue elements the most ultra-right fascist
[03:19:24.960 --> 03:19:28.240]  elements of the of the bird society of the pentagon and the central
[03:19:28.240 --> 03:19:32.400]  intelligence agency and you don't worry your ads are kicking all those people

[03:19:45.120 --> 03:19:48.000]  you need to do is check with somebody who lived under communism or under
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:51.360]  fascism or under Stalinism there's still a few of them alive one of my wife's
[03:19:51.360 --> 03:19:56.240]  good friends is a famous sculptor he's old now go ahead i'm done no no i keep
[03:19:56.240 --> 03:20:00.240]  interrupting i'm horrible he's a fat and he literally drove him crazy in in the
[03:20:00.240 --> 03:20:02.720]  check uh you know area control of the communists
[03:20:02.720 --> 03:20:05.600]  he wasn't even doing political art but they wanted to have power trips to tell
[03:20:05.600 --> 03:20:08.480]  him what to do and just ban him for 20 years that he was there under
[03:20:08.480 --> 03:20:13.040]  communism and just ruined his life and frustrated him i mean that's how it is
[03:20:13.040 --> 03:20:17.920]  i mean look at the movie the lives of others uh you know about spying on
[03:20:17.920 --> 03:20:21.680]  people it's a true story in east germany i mean is that what you want john
[03:20:21.680 --> 03:20:24.640]  because i don't like what they've done here i'm gonna give you the floor for
[03:20:24.640 --> 03:20:28.240]  two minutes we gotta go to dale and justin and willie and dan and that's it
[03:20:28.240 --> 03:20:31.760]  but john you've got the floor i'm gonna shut up go ahead well yes i'm saying
[03:20:31.760 --> 03:20:36.000]  that uh you you put up promote the propaganda of the of what we've been
[03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:40.560]  immersed in for our entire life from the john birch society which you are a
[03:20:40.560 --> 03:20:46.000]  beloved devotee of yes since the 1950s which is funded by some of the most
[03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:50.560]  right-wing fascist billionaires not ordinary people like hl hunt
[03:20:50.560 --> 03:20:54.400]  clinton murchison and the coch brothers these are these are not by the
[03:20:54.400 --> 03:20:58.480]  friends of the common people these are the ultra the most raw
[03:20:58.480 --> 03:21:02.960]  uh really do that hold on to the coch brothers really really fund them
[03:21:02.960 --> 03:21:06.880]  the coch brothers red coch was one of the founders and funders of the birch
[03:21:06.880 --> 03:21:10.880]  society along with hl hunt which some have implicated in the assassination of
[03:21:10.880 --> 03:21:14.400]  jfk the same organization that you love that put
[03:21:14.400 --> 03:21:18.240]  up those impeach uh uh for treason uh kennedy when he went
[03:21:18.240 --> 03:21:21.680]  throughout dalis now i think if you check
[03:21:21.680 --> 03:21:25.600]  you know people separately mad at kennedy about things
[03:21:25.600 --> 03:21:29.440]  right wingers and stuff that that wasn't been connected to you know people that
[03:21:29.440 --> 03:21:33.360]  killed him putting up signs we're gonna we're gonna arrest you
[03:21:33.360 --> 03:21:36.480]  i mean i mean that's like if i put out a treason son on obama and somebody
[03:21:36.480 --> 03:21:40.560]  ever kills him god forbid that i'm i did it you know when roger stone came on
[03:21:40.560 --> 03:21:44.320]  the program came on coast he talked about um how he kept using the term
[03:21:44.320 --> 03:21:49.280]  right wing oil man and people like and and phrases like that throughout the
[03:21:49.280 --> 03:21:55.200]  interview and but the thing is is that extremists on either side
[03:21:55.200 --> 03:22:00.160]  are extremists so i don't really understand how
[03:22:00.160 --> 03:22:04.320]  johnson who is a democrat no now see here's where it gets confusing
[03:22:04.320 --> 03:22:07.680]  it's the left right paradigm that's confusing as far as i'm concerned these
[03:22:07.680 --> 03:22:11.040]  these are just these are just people well i liked a lot of stuff kennedy did
[03:22:11.040 --> 03:22:14.400]  well he cut taxes about 50 man give me more of that
[03:22:14.400 --> 03:22:18.800]  he was more right than nixon was in that election he was far to the right of
[03:22:18.800 --> 03:22:23.280]  nixon and yet uh roger stone said and his book is great the man who killed
[03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:26.480]  kennedy the case against lbj i'm telling you it's a it's a heck of a book
[03:22:26.480 --> 03:22:29.760]  and you'll be convinced by the time you finish reading it that lbj did in fact
[03:22:29.760 --> 03:22:34.560]  killed john kennedy but the thing is is look the east german
[03:22:34.560 --> 03:22:39.520]  stasi and the cia they had conversations together
[03:22:39.520 --> 03:22:43.440]  these are two systems i mean it requires a balance
[03:22:43.440 --> 03:22:47.840]  it's not a kumbaya everybody hold hands like a like a prayer circle that's not
[03:22:47.840 --> 03:22:51.520]  how it is these are different cultures these are different philosophies
[03:22:51.520 --> 03:22:55.280]  they require each other to exist so maybe it's like what was said
[03:22:55.280 --> 03:22:59.120]  by myself some years ago enough of this guitar music
[03:22:59.120 --> 03:23:02.400]  we need some new instruments we need some some more interesting sounds i'm
[03:23:02.400 --> 03:23:04.960]  beginning to think that everything that can be done with these instruments has
[03:23:04.960 --> 03:23:08.800]  already been yeah i'm sick of communism fascism radical islam all of it
[03:23:08.800 --> 03:23:13.040]  okay okay i'm gonna stop your i'm sorry john you have the last word go ahead
[03:23:13.040 --> 03:23:19.120]  yes well uh you know if we're going to uh uh have our our uh understanding of
[03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:22.880]  socialism and communism uh and which uh i think you uh
[03:23:22.880 --> 03:23:26.400]  don't know the difference between or you do but you try to inculcate the idea
[03:23:26.400 --> 03:23:29.760]  that there's no difference between rheumatism and communism and people
[03:23:29.760 --> 03:23:33.600]  that we should have some real socialist or communist on maybe from the
[03:23:33.600 --> 03:23:38.960]  world socialist website party on on to uh uh blow away some of your
[03:23:38.960 --> 03:23:43.200]  terror caches of this and maybe some people i'll tell you what reach out to
[03:23:43.200 --> 03:23:46.800]  the reach out to the world communist party and reach out to their front
[03:23:46.800 --> 03:23:50.560]  group the socialist listen the socialist are people that haven't picked up ak
[03:23:50.560 --> 03:23:53.600]  47s yet and put me in a forced labor camp it's just
[03:23:53.600 --> 03:23:56.640]  communism light that's all socialism is yeah yeah the
[03:23:56.640 --> 03:24:00.800]  socialist are people that you know uh as soon as they can take over want to
[03:24:00.800 --> 03:24:04.320]  you know beat my head in a dungeon and gang rape my wife i mean i i mean i
[03:24:04.320 --> 03:24:08.880]  know what communism does john i'm sorry i don't love commies
[03:24:08.880 --> 03:24:12.560]  does that mean i'm bad i think that's the reason why you're
[03:24:12.560 --> 03:24:16.080]  still alive because you're pushing the main propaganda
[03:24:16.080 --> 03:24:19.120]  that we've been immersed in and marinated in for all our life that has
[03:24:19.120 --> 03:24:22.960]  killed millions of people from vietnam to latin america
[03:24:22.960 --> 03:24:26.720]  central america and around the world well i mean i don't like communism buddy
[03:24:26.720 --> 03:24:29.600]  i judge a tree by its fruits and there are different factions in the power
[03:24:29.600 --> 03:24:32.800]  structure uh and i know they want to balance where they
[03:24:32.800 --> 03:24:36.800]  socialize some things to get control the economy but keep it private so they
[03:24:36.800 --> 03:24:40.320]  keep their own wealth it's kind of a balance but i mean i i'm sorry
[03:24:40.320 --> 03:24:44.240]  go ahead you're the guest i'm interrupting you here here's the thing
[03:24:44.240 --> 03:24:48.800]  capitalism is always going to be present to make a profit in in parts of the
[03:24:48.800 --> 03:24:52.480]  world that can't handle their own stuff
[03:24:52.480 --> 03:24:55.760]  you know what i mean if central america was controlled i mean you don't see
[03:24:55.760 --> 03:24:58.960]  anybody really messing with uh i mean this is a rudimentary example but
[03:24:58.960 --> 03:25:02.960]  but people don't mess with switzerland people don't mess with austria they
[03:25:02.960 --> 03:25:05.600]  don't mess because they won't put up with it no they won't put up with it so
[03:25:05.600 --> 03:25:09.440]  when the population of any given geographical area has their stuff
[03:25:09.440 --> 03:25:12.800]  together and can control their population they've got a gross domestic
[03:25:12.800 --> 03:25:16.400]  product they have a culture that's like not primitive
[03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:19.360]  it's like well you can't judge them as being primitive it's like oh yes i can
[03:25:19.360 --> 03:25:23.040]  that's why the word was invented you you don't have people
[03:25:23.040 --> 03:25:26.880]  and capitalists will come in they will run guns and they will trade it for dope
[03:25:26.880 --> 03:25:28.880]  down there in the in central they will take advantage of you because they're
[03:25:28.880 --> 03:25:31.120]  really pirates well they're not capitalists they're
[03:25:31.120 --> 03:25:34.080]  pirates they're not patriots they're they're they're
[03:25:34.080 --> 03:25:38.000]  businessmen they're immoral businessmen that's exactly right and no one is
[03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:42.320]  denying that but i mean i don't want to trade them out for a bunch of
[03:25:42.320 --> 03:25:46.080]  potbellied commies running around no i mean for this for this fellow john i
[03:25:46.080 --> 03:25:49.440]  think john is just misinformed i don't think he's a bad guy i think he's just
[03:25:49.440 --> 03:25:52.880]  misinformed that you're fomenting the the same hatred in the same
[03:25:52.880 --> 03:25:55.680]  paradigm you're trying to maintain that paradigm of
[03:25:55.680 --> 03:25:59.520]  i hate to hate the calm let me ask john this john why are communist countries
[03:25:59.520 --> 03:26:04.080]  open sirs well see now you you start with a
[03:26:04.080 --> 03:26:09.440]  a loaded question like that and they are open sirs just a minute just a minute
[03:26:09.440 --> 03:26:13.920]  why is concerning the soviet union you've been telling that the lives of
[03:26:13.920 --> 03:26:17.600]  the most right-wing rogue elements of the central intelligence agency
[03:26:17.600 --> 03:26:22.240]  since the bridge society and you multiply those a thousand times relying on and
[03:26:22.240 --> 03:26:24.960]  piggyback i'm done with you john thanks for call
[03:26:24.960 --> 03:26:27.360]  you need to repeat the same thing it's a commie talking point you know that's
[03:26:27.360 --> 03:26:30.320]  never it's a it's a propaganda parrot listen
[03:26:30.320 --> 03:26:34.560]  i'm against our government encircling russia with missiles and trying to
[03:26:34.560 --> 03:26:37.840]  destabilize ukraine right now because i don't want to start a war with russia i
[03:26:37.840 --> 03:26:40.560]  want to leave their sovereignty alone i want to be friends
[03:26:40.560 --> 03:26:45.600]  so don't you say i'm cia i'd be saying get russia get them get them get them
[03:26:45.600 --> 03:26:49.520]  i try to go with justice and what is common law and makes sense
[03:26:49.520 --> 03:26:53.680]  and how i want to be treated yeah okay you'd be saying get siria
[03:26:53.680 --> 03:26:56.640]  and that'll pull the russians in and we can get it on with them
[03:26:56.640 --> 03:27:02.080]  if you were cia exactly what i am is a person that loves liberty and justice i
[03:27:02.080 --> 03:27:06.480]  mean can't people understand that they basically want to be left alone
[03:27:06.480 --> 03:27:10.880]  we want to be left alone to produce and and look yeah i'm an individual
[03:27:10.880 --> 03:27:14.160]  exactly the competition is not pleasant if you lose
[03:27:14.160 --> 03:27:18.720]  competition is only fun if you win well i think we all have had to deal with some
[03:27:18.720 --> 03:27:21.840]  failure and some losses but that's the only way that you improve that's the
[03:27:21.840 --> 03:27:24.400]  only way you grow and people a lot of people don't want to hear that it's like
[03:27:24.400 --> 03:27:28.160]  well i think the playing field should be level look if you come into this world
[03:27:28.160 --> 03:27:33.280]  and you only have three out of your four limbs playing field's not level
[03:27:33.280 --> 03:27:37.680]  this is life life is not perfect nobody gets away with a perfect life
[03:27:37.680 --> 03:27:42.400]  but if you can read you can educate yourself if you have ambition you can
[03:27:42.400 --> 03:27:46.640]  create if you can if you can love beauty and and be sweet to others
[03:27:46.640 --> 03:27:50.000]  that resonates with god and remember psychopaths think that
[03:27:50.000 --> 03:27:54.080]  just destruction of everything from a country to a human being's body
[03:27:54.080 --> 03:27:58.320]  some the real psychopath thinks that's beautiful
[03:27:58.320 --> 03:28:01.360]  and it's not beautiful i was about to say and i've talked to the
[03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:04.080]  i heard her on coast to coast to am a top psychiatrist forget her name she reads
[03:28:04.080 --> 03:28:06.800]  the best-selling book she's the one that's gone and interviewed them all
[03:28:06.800 --> 03:28:10.160]  uh i heard george don't interview her maybe you years ago the point is
[03:28:10.160 --> 03:28:14.720]  act we called her we got her on and i described it because i'd read about it
[03:28:14.720 --> 03:28:18.000]  and seen it and it's like when they're hurting a child or doing something
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:20.560]  horrible that's when they're alive there's like bright
[03:28:20.560 --> 03:28:23.760]  light and it's happy and beautiful but when they're all alone and stuff it's
[03:28:23.760 --> 03:28:27.520]  like nightmares and fear and i mean these are like demons
[03:28:27.520 --> 03:28:31.120]  yes they are i mean and there is and let me tell you i'm more vicious than
[03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:33.040]  they are when they try to hurt an innocent child
[03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:37.440]  i mean i i'll you know the point is where is the viciousness of good
[03:28:37.440 --> 03:28:40.400]  what where is that it's interesting that the feeling that comes over you
[03:28:40.400 --> 03:28:43.840]  because it's not anger or hatred that's directed this person it's just an
[03:28:43.840 --> 03:28:47.440]  absolute steadfast intent to make this stop
[03:28:47.440 --> 03:28:51.520]  now you know it's not exactly attack you and destroy you know it's like i have
[03:28:51.520 --> 03:28:54.560]  to twist your head off to make you stop i will but it's not because i want to
[03:28:54.560 --> 03:28:57.600]  twist your head off it's because i want you to stop exactly it's it's like a
[03:28:57.600 --> 03:29:00.720]  it's it's a strength when you when you see these people you just
[03:29:00.720 --> 03:29:03.760]  want to you want to you want to stop them yes
[03:29:03.760 --> 03:29:10.320]  and and understand that that perverse individuals i mean lord
[03:29:10.320 --> 03:29:16.320]  actin was correct power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely
[03:29:16.320 --> 03:29:20.000]  meaning everything i mean look at the caesars
[03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:23.600]  look at look at stalin look at hitler look at paul pot look at look at uh
[03:29:23.600 --> 03:29:26.720]  at uh who's the guy mao look at look at these people
[03:29:26.720 --> 03:29:29.840]  look just all you have to do is look at their behavior
[03:29:29.840 --> 03:29:32.960]  and fellas like john it's like no there's no reason to beat him up and pick on him
[03:29:32.960 --> 03:29:36.080]  i just to think he's misinformed and misguided and he is misinterpreting
[03:29:36.080 --> 03:29:38.240]  what's going on i'm gonna wear you out before we go to the

[03:30:17.440 --> 03:30:21.680]  that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to
[03:30:21.680 --> 03:30:25.360]  get fluoride out of the water supply yet but we can help to get it out of our
[03:30:25.360 --> 03:30:29.920]  bodies i am extremely excited to announce the exclusive info wars life

[03:39:17.760 --> 03:39:23.760]  the spiritualness of it all uh in every level so i'm a little bit overwhelmed
[03:39:23.760 --> 03:39:27.520]  right now speaking with you guys uh well i'm with friends
[03:39:27.520 --> 03:39:31.200]  somebody's financial collapses though if you don't want to get into it a little
[03:39:31.200 --> 03:39:34.720]  bit sure i mean uh we're already collapsing for most
[03:39:34.720 --> 03:39:37.600]  people and and it's just going to get worse because they want to make us
[03:39:37.600 --> 03:39:40.640]  poor to control us you know the crony capitalists do the same thing the
[03:39:40.640 --> 03:39:44.000]  communists do they all want to make you you know where
[03:39:44.000 --> 03:39:49.040]  you're on a very short leash it's a form of prison i think i think there are a
[03:39:49.040 --> 03:39:53.200]  couple of ways you know obviously we talk about golden silver and land and
[03:39:53.200 --> 03:39:56.480]  shifting it into commodities we know the dollars fake we know
[03:39:56.480 --> 03:40:00.560]  the banks are fake um uh i would maybe
[03:40:00.560 --> 03:40:05.120]  check out hawthorne i mean uh thorough you know civil disobedience
[03:40:05.120 --> 03:40:11.200]  uh i agree and you know my um my dad always points out knowing skills and
[03:40:11.200 --> 03:40:14.880]  having friends you can count on that's the real wealth in this world
[03:40:14.880 --> 03:40:19.440]  so as things degenerate you know no gardening no how to fix things no
[03:40:19.440 --> 03:40:23.040]  you know if you if you're a dentist and a total collapse folks you people are
[03:40:23.040 --> 03:40:26.080]  on each you you know but the only thing that we that we mentioned where china's
[03:40:26.080 --> 03:40:29.360]  concern is the slave labor that we know that that's true and uh jim garo who
[03:40:29.360 --> 03:40:32.560]  does this pink pagoda pink pagoda thing where he rescues little
[03:40:32.560 --> 03:40:37.760]  chinese baby girls tries to get in place at grave peril to himself and his crew
[03:40:37.760 --> 03:40:42.640]  pointed out that uh they're really secular but they enjoy hearing about
[03:40:42.640 --> 03:40:49.040]  stuff like god and and afterlife and non-secular things
[03:40:49.040 --> 03:40:53.360]  however the chinese thing is a problem
[03:40:53.360 --> 03:40:56.320]  because i think they have figured out and they may have figured out way before
[03:40:56.320 --> 03:40:59.840]  now that they're they're creating a huge bubble for themselves
[03:40:59.840 --> 03:41:03.280]  i mean they they have a number of things that are that are
[03:41:03.280 --> 03:41:06.000]  threatening to them one of them is they're gonna run out of labor they
[03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:09.680]  can't sustain this kind of growth and they're running out of labor because
[03:41:09.680 --> 03:41:13.840]  of their one child policy that's why they're trying to start fights now
[03:41:13.840 --> 03:41:16.640]  and not only that but they bought a lot of our debt
[03:41:16.640 --> 03:41:21.600]  and um i'm thinking i mean and they've published these maps oh we'll save the
[03:41:21.600 --> 03:41:24.160]  middle part of the country because that's good farmland but we'll take out
[03:41:24.160 --> 03:41:26.480]  both coasts i mean they're starting to throw the
[03:41:26.480 --> 03:41:29.280]  stuff around they're millet high ranking military officers saying oh war with
[03:41:29.280 --> 03:41:34.160]  the united states is inevitable china's a problem and it'll be over money it
[03:41:34.160 --> 03:41:37.840]  won't be over ideology it won't be over philosophy it'll be over if we screw
[03:41:37.840 --> 03:41:41.280]  them and we're gonna screw them if if we have a financial
[03:41:41.280 --> 03:41:45.760]  collapse they're gonna be screwed i mean proper screwed
[03:41:45.760 --> 03:41:48.720]  and then that's why our fleets are over there right now and look at these
[03:41:48.720 --> 03:41:51.440]  globalists i don't care how many secret weapons they've got they're out of their
[03:41:51.440 --> 03:41:54.560]  mind they want the bullets and the bandages like mori already said in that
[03:41:54.560 --> 03:41:57.680]  little second Sherlock Holmes movie that's what they want they doesn't matter
[03:41:57.680 --> 03:42:00.560]  what happens to us they are gonna find a way

[03:42:43.440 --> 03:42:47.360]  thanks for holding hey uh did you uh have you ever heard of a show called
[03:42:47.360 --> 03:42:51.760]  revolution uh that's a show about collapse isn't
[03:42:51.760 --> 03:42:55.600]  i've read the synopsis i haven't watched it it's like they take it like the power
[03:42:55.600 --> 03:43:00.480]  goes out and you get to watch like society kind of collapse on itself yeah
[03:43:00.480 --> 03:43:04.480]  and uh it's funny because i see a lot of connection between
[03:43:04.480 --> 03:43:09.920]  the like i don't know like the illuminati or and in that show because uh
[03:43:09.920 --> 03:43:14.080]  they use the word patriot a lot in that show and it um
[03:43:14.080 --> 03:43:18.880]  like the patriots is like the secret society and they they their symbol is
[03:43:18.880 --> 03:43:21.760]  represented by a triangle with like an eyeball
[03:43:21.760 --> 03:43:24.320]  in the middle in the show yeah yeah i guess you're saying the illuminati are
[03:43:24.320 --> 03:43:27.440]  the good guys they're the real patriots when they're the ones already
[03:43:27.440 --> 03:43:30.960]  shutting down our power plants
[03:43:31.520 --> 03:43:34.880]  i just i was wondering if you if you have seen that show or no i mean i focus
[03:43:34.880 --> 03:43:38.720]  so much on news that i don't really watch a lot of mainstream television
[03:43:38.720 --> 03:43:42.560]  but but but i i mean it's just constant programming anything i see is anti
[03:43:42.560 --> 03:43:46.480]  family you name it tyranny uh now i do see some stuff like the new
[03:43:46.480 --> 03:43:49.120]  superman movie that's like anti eugenics and things
[03:43:49.120 --> 03:43:52.640]  so they're not everybody's bad in the system either that's the thing that
[03:43:52.640 --> 03:43:58.240]  the evil is not invincible but all of us that aren't bad guys we've got to
[03:43:58.240 --> 03:44:02.320]  take action and speak out because all that evil needs to flourish is that
[03:44:02.320 --> 03:44:05.760]  good men do nothing you know i'm afraid if this if this
[03:44:05.760 --> 03:44:09.200]  continues i mean can you imagine i'll just say it
[03:44:09.200 --> 03:44:13.520]  do we really have another three years to go with this president
[03:44:13.520 --> 03:44:17.840]  because that seems like an awfully long time given what's happening just this
[03:44:17.840 --> 03:44:22.720]  just in this past year with scandal after scandal tsa and power grabbing fbi
[03:44:22.720 --> 03:44:25.600]  attorney general's office irs all this i mean
[03:44:25.600 --> 03:44:29.200]  nsa and you know what's weird alex's people there are some people out there
[03:44:29.200 --> 03:44:33.280]  that still support this cat and it is true that say oh well there is no left
[03:44:33.280 --> 03:44:36.160]  right paradigm well there kind of is in one respect it's the cult of
[03:44:36.160 --> 03:44:39.440]  personality well he's like at the end of the baseball game he's the
[03:44:39.440 --> 03:44:43.200]  closer the closing pitcher i mean they he's their man
[03:44:43.200 --> 03:44:46.480]  they're slick either trying to sell it all on him i'm just wondering what would
[03:44:46.480 --> 03:44:49.200]  have happened if anybody that was labeled
[03:44:49.200 --> 03:44:53.680]  how well however they actually perform their their duties and exercise their
[03:44:53.680 --> 03:44:59.440]  office if anybody on the right let alone named republican
[03:44:59.440 --> 03:45:03.680]  or labeled republican work to put forth
[03:45:03.680 --> 03:45:07.280]  they would be impeached and arrested they'd be hanging from a rope in the
[03:45:07.280 --> 03:45:10.640]  public school listen let's just say this they're using people wanting to have
[03:45:10.640 --> 03:45:15.040]  racial you know coming together and then projecting on to him that because he's
[03:45:15.040 --> 03:45:18.240]  part black or whatever that you know he's got to be good
[03:45:18.240 --> 03:45:24.960]  they knew that so that i mean what a white democrat get away with all this
[03:45:24.960 --> 03:45:27.840]  the answer is absolutely not i don't think so absolutely not
[03:45:27.840 --> 03:45:31.600]  regime right out you know remember the yeah right amendment but i mean look at
[03:45:31.600 --> 03:45:36.000]  look at gary hard over a woman threw him out look at mccrystal
[03:45:36.000 --> 03:45:39.680]  look at betray us i mean that they'll throw him right out but this guy here
[03:45:39.680 --> 03:45:43.920]  this guy's he's teflon he's bulletproof and teflon well they're doing it again
[03:45:43.920 --> 03:45:48.080]  because they're they're using all the well-meaning people that want unity
[03:45:48.080 --> 03:45:52.240]  and then basically suckering him and he i mean it's incredible thank you justin
[03:45:52.240 --> 03:45:57.440]  let's talk to dan in colorado you're on the air with john b wells go ahead

[03:46:32.160 --> 03:46:35.840]  what's happening in colorado springs first of all it's very important uh
[03:46:35.840 --> 03:46:38.560]  that everyone knows that there is something that we should do about this
[03:46:38.560 --> 03:46:43.280]  okay um this unprecedented recent recall of four of our senators
[03:46:43.280 --> 03:46:47.040]  okay um uh and it was hosted by the alley
[03:46:47.040 --> 03:46:50.560]  that's a great point they are recalling the state senators that are trying to
[03:46:50.560 --> 03:46:55.280]  ban guns in colorado that's an example of we the people taking action beautiful
[03:46:55.280 --> 03:46:58.400]  point they're not trying to they did they actually
[03:46:58.400 --> 03:47:02.080]  no i know i know i know and and then now they're resigning just so they can
[03:47:02.080 --> 03:47:06.720]  start a new election up yeah yeah and i just want i want everybody to
[03:47:06.720 --> 03:47:10.640]  know this there's there's something to do this was these people were recalled
[03:47:10.640 --> 03:47:15.520]  um based on uh just signatures and and i'm not talking about uh hundreds of
[03:47:15.520 --> 03:47:18.240]  thousands of senators and so on there's thousands of signatures no just
[03:47:18.240 --> 03:47:22.320]  thought people taking action it happened and then they are even resigning
[03:47:22.320 --> 03:47:25.760]  because they know in a new election or whatever they're going to lose four of
[03:47:25.760 --> 03:47:29.040]  them are gone more gone and now they just resign
[03:47:29.040 --> 03:47:33.600]  when the recall starts i mean it's it's exactly they're a bunch of scum
[03:47:33.600 --> 03:47:37.120]  go ahead they are they are and the same thing about this is that
[03:47:37.120 --> 03:47:41.200]  is the r.a. and the d.f. d.f. which is the basic freedom
[03:47:41.200 --> 03:47:45.280]  sense one is who funded this whole uh
[03:47:45.280 --> 03:47:49.280]  what this one is this whole tire uh this whole entire thing
[03:47:49.280 --> 03:47:54.000]  and um the other side which uh which who are the supporters of
[03:47:54.000 --> 03:47:59.440]  john morris and garon was slowly no i hear you listen i got a
[03:47:59.440 --> 03:48:01.840]  jump we're almost out of time and your phone's not that good i couldn't make
[03:48:01.840 --> 03:48:05.120]  all that out but the you know the part about recalls that's that's it right
[03:48:05.120 --> 03:48:07.920]  there that's it and you know and you know there is uh there's something else
[03:48:07.920 --> 03:48:11.040]  been thrown in the mix so over the last few months and that is that people are
[03:48:11.040 --> 03:48:14.160]  really beginning to take seriously the possibility that this make country this
[03:48:14.160 --> 03:48:18.640]  country may split into separate states
[03:48:18.640 --> 03:48:22.480]  i mean i don't mean like one of the 48 contiguous i mean as in
[03:48:22.480 --> 03:48:25.280]  northern colorado is going these people don't represent our interest we're
[03:48:25.280 --> 03:48:28.080]  going to see there's a there are movements all over the place and there
[03:48:28.080 --> 03:48:31.600]  is a flight to these states montana and the dakotas and
[03:48:31.600 --> 03:48:34.480]  washington and idaho and places like that colorado as well
[03:48:34.480 --> 03:48:39.920]  that uh people are saying the flight away from the urban areas because people
[03:48:39.920 --> 03:48:42.320]  are going something bad is going to happen
[03:48:42.320 --> 03:48:45.840]  it may become overpopulated up there they may start running out of space out of
[03:48:45.840 --> 03:48:50.160]  there there is such an influx of people from the rest of the country
[03:48:50.160 --> 03:48:53.680]  yeah folks this is all unsustainable that's a fact
[03:48:53.680 --> 03:48:57.760]  the debt all of it it's it's going down by design
[03:48:57.760 --> 03:49:00.720]  but it's like you designed something to burn down they've already lit it it's
[03:49:00.720 --> 03:49:05.680]  going down and don't forget there is a 100 million ton island three times the
[03:49:05.680 --> 03:49:08.320]  size of britain it's passed hawaii now and it's headed
[03:49:08.320 --> 03:49:13.360]  directly for the west coast now when that hits our coast and it will and it's
[03:49:13.360 --> 03:49:16.640]  radioactive certainly some of it is
[03:49:16.640 --> 03:49:21.040]  uh what happens in now somebody's going to make a bunch of money in the
[03:49:21.040 --> 03:49:24.160]  salvage business but what is that going to do for
[03:49:24.160 --> 03:49:28.400]  the rest of us we're seeing maps now that see it's hard to vet this stuff
[03:49:28.400 --> 03:49:31.600]  unless you go there yourself but there are spikes little red spikes starting to
[03:49:31.600 --> 03:49:36.480]  appear all over the country they're not large areas but they are bright
[03:49:36.480 --> 03:49:39.760]  red little spikes and the melting sea stars on the west coast they've
[03:49:39.760 --> 03:49:43.120]  experienced the same thing on the the east coast around carolina and main
[03:49:43.120 --> 03:49:47.920]  oh the seals are dying up in alaska it's folks it's crazy eyeballs and hey
