[00:00.000 --> 00:11.840]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.840 --> 00:19.360]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin
[00:19.360 --> 00:28.040]  texas alex jones welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night your host
[00:28.040 --> 00:31.760]  today we're gonna be joined this hour by Paul Joseph Watson coming up in the
[00:31.760 --> 00:35.720]  next segment he's going to talk to us about some breaking stories on info
[00:35.720 --> 00:40.760]  wars essentially what we're seeing is the mayac report of 2009 that they sent
[00:40.760 --> 00:45.040]  to the fusion centers saying beyond the lookout for anyone with a bumper sticker
[00:45.040 --> 00:50.320]  saying they voted for Ron Paul or for Chuck Baldwin these people could be
[00:50.320 --> 00:54.480]  dangerous well that's what they're doing now in terms of profiling everybody
[00:54.480 --> 00:59.200]  before they make contact with them it's essentially that mayac report implemented
[00:59.200 --> 01:02.840]  and on steroids we're also going to talk to him about the fallout from this
[01:02.840 --> 01:09.120]  report this video that we saw out of Spokane about the officer who is
[01:09.120 --> 01:14.040]  bragging about his m-wrap and when asked why would he need something like
[01:14.040 --> 01:16.720]  that and Spokane he said well we have a lot of constitutionalists so we're
[01:16.720 --> 01:20.960]  going to be talking about that as well we also have on the show an author of a
[01:20.960 --> 01:25.960]  book called the Colder Wars name is Marin Katusa very interesting book I
[01:25.960 --> 01:31.440]  really found this to be a fascinating read because there's a lot of background
[01:31.440 --> 01:34.960]  information in it you know we have situations that are grabbing the
[01:34.960 --> 01:40.160]  headlines like the Sydney siege yesterday like the massacre of school
[01:40.160 --> 01:44.440]  children in Pakistan brutal massacre now those are the things that are going to
[01:44.440 --> 01:49.080]  grab headlines but if you want to know what is going on in the world that is
[01:49.080 --> 01:53.760]  going to bring us to worldwide war to a worldwide depression you need to
[01:53.760 --> 01:58.040]  understand the background story the struggle as he puts it the great game
[01:58.040 --> 02:02.160]  that's been going on since the British Empire much older than the Cold War you
[02:02.160 --> 02:06.480]  also need to understand Putin and listen to this excerpt this review from Dr.
[02:06.480 --> 02:11.760]  Ron Paul about this book he said the Cold War provides a reversing contrast
[02:11.760 --> 02:16.120]  from the hysterical Putin is Stalin Jr. let's restart the Cold War message
[02:16.120 --> 02:19.720]  emanating from the neocon think tanks and the mainstream media that's
[02:19.720 --> 02:23.960]  exactly right he gives a very interesting take on this I have an excerpt of
[02:23.960 --> 02:27.640]  some of the false flag narrative it's interesting to look at this and put it
[02:27.640 --> 02:32.360]  into a timeline into historical context and it's fascinating to look at how
[02:32.360 --> 02:39.520]  Putin used false flags essentially the same way our guys do hey if it works it
[02:39.520 --> 02:44.160]  keeps working and they never get caught they never get they continually fool the
[02:44.160 --> 02:47.040]  public it doesn't matter if it's the Reichstag fire it doesn't matter if it's
[02:47.040 --> 02:52.640]  9-11 it doesn't matter if it's these terrorist events they always work it's
[02:52.640 --> 02:57.800]  a full-proof plan apparently but we need to get people educated the only
[02:57.800 --> 03:01.360]  antidote to this is to get people to understand that but we're going to talk
[03:01.360 --> 03:04.560]  about the broader context we're going to talk about the petrodollar and of course
[03:04.560 --> 03:09.240]  today we have massive tectonic moves that are happening in the economy
[03:09.240 --> 03:14.800]  essentially tied to oil to the stock market what the Congress rushed to do
[03:14.800 --> 03:21.200]  put the American taxpayer on the hook to ensure derivatives of banks now we're
[03:21.200 --> 03:25.000]  seeing why they rushed to do that and take all the criticism for we see the
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.960]  Russian central bank hiked its interest rate to 17% in order to halt the fall of
[03:30.960 --> 03:35.240]  their currency and of course as we talked about yesterday once these oil
[03:35.240 --> 03:39.800]  futures start falling because the actions of Saudi Arabia and OPEC once
[03:39.800 --> 03:43.840]  they start falling the oil futures are becoming worthless that spreads to the
[03:43.840 --> 03:48.240]  commodities market it spreads to the currency market it spreads to the stock
[03:48.240 --> 03:54.120]  market and what starts out as economic warfare between the west and Russia may
[03:54.120 --> 03:57.640]  very well turn it into a shooting war we're going to take a look at the
[03:57.640 --> 04:02.720]  headlines behind it Russia's ruble plummets more than 20% a day hitting new
[04:02.720 --> 04:07.280]  dollar and euro lows again that was on trading on Tuesday and we also see that
[04:07.280 --> 04:11.120]  they're tying it to the future markets just as we said yesterday and another
[04:11.120 --> 04:16.320]  interesting thing that came up comics has said the beginning December the 21st I
[04:16.320 --> 04:21.160]  believe is a date that they are going to effective Monday December the 21st
[04:21.160 --> 04:25.520]  they're going to implement gold and silver price limit collars in other
[04:25.520 --> 04:30.200]  words they're going to limit the upside movement of gold and silver what does
[04:30.200 --> 04:36.600]  that tell you we see over and over again small but many signals that something
[04:36.600 --> 04:40.760]  big is coming so we're going to be talking to Marin Katushka about his
[04:40.760 --> 04:44.000]  book the Cold War and we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson joining us in
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  the next segment stay with us

[07:59.800 --> 08:04.800]  as a community moves towards despotism respect is restricted to fewer
[08:04.800 --> 08:11.440]  people that's veteran Denver police officer Charles Jones the fourth
[08:11.440 --> 08:18.520]  smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times officers accused of using
[08:18.520 --> 08:26.760]  excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence of community
[08:26.760 --> 08:32.760]  rates low on an information scale when the press radio and other channels of
[08:32.760 --> 08:37.600]  communication are controlled by only a few people doesn't raise ethical
[08:37.600 --> 08:40.520]  questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the
[08:40.520 --> 08:43.760]  government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by
[08:43.760 --> 08:50.400]  the government. What difference at this point does it make? When a competent observer
[08:50.400 --> 08:55.240]  looks for signs of despotism in the community he looks beyond fine words
[08:55.240 --> 08:59.400]  and noble faces. There are actions I have the legal authority to take as
[08:59.400 --> 09:03.520]  president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more
[09:03.520 --> 09:11.400]  just. Tonight I'm announcing those actions. What I say go see, I'm the law around here.
[09:11.400 --> 09:18.320]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Okay, you saw he died.
[09:18.320 --> 09:23.120]  Yes, in modern warfare our military leaders are finding that words and ideas
[09:23.120 --> 09:27.760]  are highly effective weapons. We just have to be repetitive about this. We need to
[09:27.760 --> 09:31.920]  do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[09:31.920 --> 09:36.840]  about guns in a vastly different way. We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[09:36.840 --> 09:40.400]  You really don't have to trust me. You shouldn't trust me. In fact, by my
[09:40.400 --> 09:44.760]  actually participating that I will taint the news. In communities of this kind
[09:44.760 --> 09:51.040]  despotism stands a good chance. The nine most terrifying words in the English
[09:51.040 --> 09:56.040]  language are I'm from the government and I'm here to help. Okay Miss Hughes, well
[09:56.040 --> 10:00.800]  we're gonna do everything we can to help you. Ha ha ha ha ha. Resistance to
[10:00.800 --> 10:10.960]  tyrants is obedience to God. It's the Alex Jones show because there is a war for your mind.
[10:10.960 --> 10:15.720]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Tuesday, December 16, 2014. I'm David
[10:15.720 --> 10:20.080]  Knight, your host today. Joining me from the UK is Paul Joseph Watson and we're
[10:20.080 --> 10:24.040]  going to talk about some couple of stories that are up on info wars.com
[10:24.040 --> 10:29.040]  today. Please using social media posts to determine the threat score of suspects.
[10:29.040 --> 10:32.520]  That's an article up by Paul Joseph Watson as well as a follow-up to what's
[10:32.520 --> 10:37.120]  happening in Spokane, Washington about this sheriff's deputy's comments about
[10:37.120 --> 10:43.000]  needing these MRAPs for constitutionalists. But I wanted to play a clip and
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.480]  get Paul's comments on this from yesterday. We have comments from Fox
[10:48.480 --> 10:54.120]  about the Sydney siege. I want to play this clip and get Paul to
[10:54.120 --> 11:01.880]  comment on using that to justify torture. Go ahead. The actual individuals here at
[11:01.880 --> 11:07.400]  home who've been into and trying to stop attacks like this and perhaps
[11:07.400 --> 11:11.840]  future hostage situations as we are still at war indeed with ISIS and
[11:11.840 --> 11:16.280]  terrorism are the CIA and they've been painted as the bad guys at home. You know
[11:16.280 --> 11:20.360]  former Vice President Dick Cheney actually called out Chuck Todd over the
[11:20.360 --> 11:24.640]  weekend yesterday for taking cheap shots on the CIA enhanced interrogation
[11:24.640 --> 11:28.680]  report. When you see what's happening in Australia today right now in a chocolate
[11:28.680 --> 11:34.400]  shop and you understand the real war with ISIS that we're in a sharp contrast
[11:34.400 --> 11:38.520]  with the accusations of the CIA really just trying to do their job and keep
[11:38.520 --> 11:44.200]  America safe for the past 13 years startles you any day. Just trying to do
[11:44.200 --> 11:48.880]  their job. Can you imagine that betraying the CIA as bad guys because of their
[11:48.880 --> 11:53.080]  torture. I mean who would imagine doing something like that betraying them as the
[11:53.080 --> 11:59.840]  bad guys. Paul your comments. Well the CIA just trying to do its job and protect
[11:59.840 --> 12:05.120]  us from terrorism. It was the CIA that smuggled weapons to so-called moderate
[12:05.120 --> 12:10.440]  Syrian rebels which later ended up in the hands of ISIS terrorists. Some of those
[12:10.440 --> 12:15.400]  same rebels defected and joined ISIS. It was the CIA that helped the US
[12:15.400 --> 12:19.760]  government destabilize Syria in the first place that led to the upspring of
[12:19.760 --> 12:24.040]  ISIS and then the whole torture debate itself is founded on completely false
[12:24.040 --> 12:29.000]  pretenses that torture even works. Yes. When every shred of evidence says that it
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.320]  only elicits false confessions which in fact divert real resources from finding
[12:34.320 --> 12:40.440]  out the truth about terrorist plots and on top of that it creates terrorists. It
[12:40.440 --> 12:45.360]  radicalizes people. It radicalizes the region. So it only creates more blowback.
[12:45.360 --> 12:50.480]  So torture actually creates terrorists. It doesn't protect us from terrorists and
[12:50.480 --> 12:54.900]  certainly giving weapons to radical jihadists who then hand them over to
[12:54.900 --> 12:59.240]  ISIS is not going to protect us from terrorists. I think it's very troubling
[12:59.240 --> 13:04.160]  when we hear Fox's Hasselbeck and others promote terrorism as you point out as
[13:04.160 --> 13:10.280]  the lie that is a effective. Even if it were effective we shouldn't be
[13:10.280 --> 13:14.100]  using it. That's the point I want to make to people. I've got this article here
[13:14.100 --> 13:17.600]  Paul from the Washington Post saying Americans back the CIA and they say in
[13:17.600 --> 13:23.600]  polling from 2007, 2009, 2011 and again today 2014 Americans have said they
[13:23.600 --> 13:29.880]  consider waterboarding to be torture yet increasingly they are for it. So they
[13:29.880 --> 13:33.800]  don't really care whether it's torture or not if they think that it works and
[13:33.800 --> 13:37.280]  there's another article that really bothered me even more and that was from
[13:37.280 --> 13:43.040]  a Christian magazine, World Magazine, WNG.org. It's an article called
[13:43.040 --> 13:48.760]  Torture in Our National Soul and in this article the writer essentially makes the
[13:48.760 --> 13:54.400]  case of situational ethics, moral relativism. In other words does the end
[13:54.400 --> 13:58.240]  justify the means? Listen to this Paul. He says Otto von Bismarck, the great 19th
[13:58.240 --> 14:01.120]  century German Chancellor, of course the quote that he says laws are like
[14:01.120 --> 14:04.880]  sausages. It's better not to see them being made. They make that article for
[14:04.880 --> 14:08.080]  torture. They say this is true of other things the government does in serving the
[14:08.080 --> 14:13.480]  public good like grisly police work and ugly executions. They say it's torturing
[14:13.480 --> 14:17.080]  a captured terrorist and a reasonable hope of saving thousands of innocent
[14:17.080 --> 14:21.000]  lives among the unpleasant necessities of involving and keeping us
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.280]  safe and free. In other words they put out the Jack Bauer scenario. They
[14:25.280 --> 14:28.800]  actually list that in here. You've got a ticking nuclear bomb and you know if you
[14:28.800 --> 14:33.240]  can break this guy's fingers and get the answer to that then we ought to do that.
[14:33.240 --> 14:38.080]  It's amazing that they even talk about how our enemies are abroad are cutting
[14:38.080 --> 14:44.040]  off heads. That's our allies, Saudi Arabia, that is doing far more beheading
[14:44.040 --> 14:48.040]  than ISIS has ever done and of course they're the CIA's proxy in most of this.
[14:48.040 --> 14:54.040]  That's the thing that really troubles me is the idea that we would sell our
[14:54.040 --> 14:59.560]  souls essentially to achieve a means and that's very troubling for me to see
[14:59.560 --> 15:03.400]  this coming from of all places a Christian magazine. Let me read one more
[15:03.400 --> 15:07.280]  quote and then get your comments Paul. This writer DC Ennis says once we accept
[15:07.280 --> 15:12.720]  the quote no torture though the heavens may fall position is unreasonable we are
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.600]  faced with a judgment call on the far margins of civic life in a tragically
[15:17.600 --> 15:22.840]  fallen world. I would say no. I would say that if we are going to embrace torture
[15:22.840 --> 15:27.720]  for the sake of the false hope that it's going to produce results even even if
[15:27.720 --> 15:32.440]  it did produce results we should reject it so that we do not become the monster
[15:32.440 --> 15:39.000]  that we're told we have to slay. Paul your comments. Well if you embrace methods
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.240]  and techniques used by some of the most despotic regimes throughout history and
[15:43.240 --> 15:47.400]  then try and turn that into some kind of American virtue I mean that just
[15:47.400 --> 15:53.240]  reflects on you and read the Sugumbu military report of Abu Ghraib you know
[15:53.240 --> 15:58.720]  raping teenagers with sticks dripping with battery acid and the other the
[15:58.720 --> 16:03.280]  other point is the vast majority of these people they took into these camps at
[16:03.280 --> 16:08.040]  Gwansanamo and Abu Ghraib were never even suspected of terrorism they were goat
[16:08.040 --> 16:12.560]  herders they were taxi drivers the vast majority of them weren't even properly
[16:12.560 --> 16:17.600]  suspected of terrorism never mind turned out to be terrorists so again torture
[16:17.600 --> 16:23.840]  decreases national security it actually harms America so in supporting it these
[16:23.840 --> 16:28.960]  neocons are not only exposing themselves as anti-American in terms of the
[16:28.960 --> 16:33.400]  the spiritual value of opposing torture they're actually harming American
[16:33.400 --> 16:38.040]  national security yes it doesn't work and it creates more terrorists every
[16:38.040 --> 16:43.440]  single shred of evidence in every study shows that exactly exactly like the
[16:43.440 --> 16:47.960]  drone program of assassination where we have a chair force back in the United
[16:47.960 --> 16:53.080]  States essentially killing people massive civilian casualties which they
[16:53.080 --> 16:57.840]  dismiss as collateral damage and look at anybody that is of a certain age in the
[16:57.840 --> 17:01.880]  country as a militant that's the way they excuse it that's the way Brennan
[17:01.880 --> 17:06.240]  excused it and they never answer for their crimes they continue to get away
[17:06.240 --> 17:10.600]  with it not only do they get away with it but they get promoted Brennan gets
[17:10.600 --> 17:14.480]  promoted from justifying torture he then goes to be an apologist for the
[17:14.480 --> 17:19.120]  drone program then he becomes the CIA director and they appear to be when you
[17:19.120 --> 17:24.040]  look at this Feinstein report they are essentially above answering to anybody
[17:24.040 --> 17:28.960]  to the Senate to anyone they go down and they list 20 different areas that they
[17:28.960 --> 17:32.840]  all blame on the CIA and they say hey they did this and they miss they misled
[17:32.840 --> 17:35.800]  us on this they lied to us about that we didn't know what they were doing and
[17:35.800 --> 17:42.280]  yet they will not broach the obvious solution and that is to at least fire
[17:42.280 --> 17:46.080]  somebody they ought to be put in prison they ought to have a Nuremberg trial for
[17:46.080 --> 17:50.800]  these guys well I mean if they were actually to fire someone they would
[17:50.800 --> 17:54.760]  have to acknowledge that the entire program was wrong to be in with so it's
[17:54.760 --> 18:01.920]  never going to happen yes they want the power that they have exactly I mean
[18:01.920 --> 18:07.320]  drone strikes 95% innocent civilians and go and watch the documentary like
[18:07.320 --> 18:12.520]  Skahill's dirty wars if you if you see your brother get massacred in a drone
[18:12.520 --> 18:15.960]  strike that's going to radicalize you and that's exactly what's happening
[18:15.960 --> 18:21.840]  yeah creating terrorists in Pakistan in Afghanistan that hate America this is
[18:21.840 --> 18:25.680]  the consequence of torture and drone strikes and you know it does kind of
[18:25.680 --> 18:30.320]  make sense in a long format way of thinking it creates more reason for more
[18:30.320 --> 18:35.400]  military intervention more weapons sales so by its logical conclusion that's the
[18:35.400 --> 18:40.240]  only that's the only way you could support it if you were a neocon who was
[18:40.240 --> 18:43.400]  going down that line of thinking but in terms of national security it's horrible
[18:43.400 --> 18:47.680]  it's absolutely horrible for America yes absolutely and of course that's how it
[18:47.680 --> 18:51.320]  is being used and that's why they're doing it it's not that they can't figure
[18:51.320 --> 18:55.600]  it out they know very well Paul that this is going to increase tensions it's
[18:55.600 --> 19:00.160]  going to increase war that's by design they want a larger war so that they
[19:00.160 --> 19:04.160]  can sell into it with the military industrial complex let's quickly give a
[19:04.160 --> 19:07.160]  preview because we're not gonna have time to talk about it in this in this

[19:11.160 --> 19:16.240]  posts to determine the threat score of suspects as I pointed out in the opening
[19:16.240 --> 19:21.600]  segment it sounds like the 2009 Mayak report on steroids but of course it's
[19:21.600 --> 19:28.120]  in a much broader basis as well yeah this is a software program that police
[19:28.120 --> 19:32.560]  across the United States are using called beware actually got contacted by

[24:58.720 --> 25:03.240]  and silver bullet a two-day special now Paul just before the break we were
[25:03.240 --> 25:06.840]  talking about began talking about you gave us a preview of your article here
[25:06.840 --> 25:10.880]  how the police are using social media posts to determine threat scores of
[25:10.880 --> 25:16.280]  suspects it's bad enough Paul that they view the public as a threat they're
[25:16.280 --> 25:19.760]  told every day they go out they're going into a war zone they may not come back
[25:19.760 --> 25:24.360]  there's so many people in the public who want to kill them that they're being
[25:24.360 --> 25:28.720]  threatened so they build this sense of being threatened now they're giving
[25:28.720 --> 25:33.880]  people an actual score by spying on them tell us about that yes it's the
[25:33.880 --> 25:37.520]  program software program that's been in use by police departments across the
[25:37.520 --> 25:43.240]  United States since 2012 it ascribes people based on their home address a
[25:43.240 --> 25:50.880]  threat score of green yellow or red based on recent purchases and quote any
[25:50.880 --> 25:56.240]  comments that could be construed as offensive so you get a threat score as
[25:56.240 --> 26:00.800]  to how likely you're going to be a physical danger to police based on your
[26:00.800 --> 26:05.760]  recent purchases and social media posts and online comments and what is the
[26:05.760 --> 26:09.960]  standard for what they consider threatening in terms of online comments
[26:09.960 --> 26:14.920]  well we know again back in 2012 Brandon Raub was literally kidnapped from his
[26:14.920 --> 26:20.520]  own home for making what in comparison to a lot of online content were tame
[26:20.520 --> 26:26.160]  comments about taking back the Republic while referencing people like Thomas
[26:26.160 --> 26:30.600]  Jefferson Martin Luther King and John F Kennedy we've seen kids would definitely
[26:30.600 --> 26:34.240]  get a red score Thomas Jefferson Martin Luther King would definitely be red
[26:34.240 --> 26:39.960]  so it may a red exactly it's chilling I mean kids who post rap lyrics again
[26:39.960 --> 26:44.560]  visits from police and this is what they consider a threat this is thirty six
[26:44.560 --> 26:49.880]  thousand dollars a year again most of which paid for by federal grants it
[26:49.880 --> 26:53.800]  again it goes back to the Department of Homeland Security they're funding all
[26:53.800 --> 26:59.320]  this this is why the police keep using it so it's chilling also they use it to
[26:59.320 --> 27:05.800]  enforce nanny state enforcement codes so if your trees aren't trimmed properly to
[27:05.800 --> 27:09.760]  the city code then they can tie your home address to your personality and
[27:09.760 --> 27:13.880]  target you that way so there's a there's a whole Reuters report on it and that is
[27:13.880 --> 27:18.160]  just one program amongst others in which their data mining going through
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.920]  billions of records to identify Americans as potential threats based on
[27:22.920 --> 27:28.400]  quote comments that could be construed as offensive wow that's outrageous because
[27:28.400 --> 27:32.720]  we talk about them going on a fishing expedition on you know minor code
[27:32.720 --> 27:36.800]  violations like the way they don't like your trees trimmed or your grass trimmed
[27:36.800 --> 27:39.920]  or whatever this allows them to essentially go through and look at who
[27:39.920 --> 27:44.520]  they don't like politically and then go dig up some dirt on them that's the
[27:44.520 --> 27:48.760]  that's the really hideous thing about this it's something that we've seen
[27:48.760 --> 27:52.400]  before Paul when they talk about labeling people as sovereign citizens or
[27:52.400 --> 27:54.800]  again this other article where they're talking about labeling them as
[27:54.800 --> 28:01.000]  constitutionalists they use those labels to essentially get the threat
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.040]  perception up by the police and we saw that happen in the wake of the Bundy
[28:05.040 --> 28:10.040]  ranch standoff immediately Glenn Beck had on mr. Bundy and he had another
[28:10.040 --> 28:13.360]  person there that was interviewing him trying to tie him to the sovereign
[28:13.360 --> 28:17.600]  citizen movement which he had no idea what they were talking about but they
[28:17.600 --> 28:21.520]  use these labels to try to scare the police into thinking that you're a
[28:21.520 --> 28:24.760]  physical threat to them because they already tell everybody tell them that
[28:24.760 --> 28:27.600]  everybody is is something of a threat to them but then they make it very
[28:27.600 --> 28:32.880]  specific and they tie it to people who are opposed to them yeah and violent
[28:32.880 --> 28:37.160]  crime is the lowest it's been in 40 years violent crime against police
[28:37.160 --> 28:41.880]  officers is dropping so this narrative that the police are being sold that
[28:41.880 --> 28:45.480]  violence against them is increasing and then that everybody's out to attack the
[28:45.480 --> 28:50.920]  police statistically is not true and this program could also be abused if they
[28:50.920 --> 28:54.600]  tie you to the wrong address to an address that somebody else used to live
[28:54.600 --> 28:59.400]  in that has been identified as a threat could turn you a green rating into a
[28:59.400 --> 29:03.880]  red rating is the quote turning a midday knock on the front door into a
[29:03.880 --> 29:08.000]  nighttime SWAT raid so if they confuse you with somebody else as they've done
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.880]  on numerous false drug busts then that could determine you to be a threat as
[29:12.880 --> 29:16.200]  well they could just confuse you with another person so it's absolutely
[29:16.200 --> 29:19.280]  horrifying but we see people being killed all the time with these SWAT
[29:19.280 --> 29:23.400]  team raids going to the wrong house that's not an uncommon occurrence
[29:23.400 --> 29:27.080]  anymore so that's something that if you're not even if you were in total
[29:27.080 --> 29:31.160]  agreement with Obama and with Boehner you should still be concerned about this
[29:31.160 --> 29:35.960]  because they might falsely identify you but this is a way to purge political
[29:35.960 --> 29:39.640]  opposition it's the enhancement of the police state we're gonna be right back
[29:39.640 --> 29:43.040]  with Paul Joseph Watson stay with us

[33:25.520 --> 33:29.200]  from the UK we've just been talking about his article that's up on info wars

[33:35.660 --> 33:42.440]  score to you looking at your online media posts looking profiling you and
[33:42.440 --> 33:46.720]  essentially giving you a rating from green yellow to red and of course the
[33:46.720 --> 33:51.280]  many problems of that there's there's people who could be falsely identified
[33:51.280 --> 33:55.240]  it's a way they could come after their enemies and and Paul before we go back
[33:55.240 --> 33:59.120]  to this article I wanted to give you something that came out today this is
[33:59.120 --> 34:02.160]  from the Free Thought Project about a police union that was caught putting
[34:02.160 --> 34:08.000]  GPS on rival politicians cars and framing them for driving under the
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.040]  influence now this is a situation we've got a couple of former police officers
[34:12.040 --> 34:16.920]  arrested and charged with felonies after this plot came to light what was
[34:16.920 --> 34:21.560]  happening was they had these guys who are acting independently they rather
[34:21.560 --> 34:25.280]  they were not acting independently they were hired by a law firm at the time
[34:25.280 --> 34:31.520]  represented over 120 police unions across California and we see this very
[34:31.520 --> 34:35.160]  often that it's the police unions who were standing against any kind of
[34:35.160 --> 34:39.120]  discipline for excessive police brutality but in this case their beef that
[34:39.120 --> 34:43.520]  they had with these two politicians was that they was in regard to the budgets
[34:43.520 --> 34:46.560]  for the police departments they didn't think that they were getting out of money
[34:46.560 --> 34:51.240]  so what they did was they had these two guys who were city councilmen they were
[34:51.240 --> 34:57.240]  meeting at a bar afterwards all they had was low alcohol non-alcoholic beverages
[34:57.240 --> 35:00.680]  rather not even low alcoholic but non-alcoholic beverages and then drove
[35:00.680 --> 35:08.200]  home the police get a call from a observer let's call them a snitch who
[35:08.200 --> 35:14.400]  told them that these two had driven home drunk and so the officers arrest them
[35:14.400 --> 35:17.880]  then later determined that they're not under the influence of alcohol they
[35:17.880 --> 35:21.640]  found out that these two men tracked them in their car using GPS then called
[35:21.640 --> 35:26.160]  9-11 to report that they had been drinking and had seen them leaving a bar
[35:26.160 --> 35:30.800]  so that's how this can be used you can use this to take down your political
[35:30.800 --> 35:35.200]  enemies and when you look at this you look at a police union law firm that
[35:35.200 --> 35:41.160]  represents law firms hiring these guys to set up councilmen who are opposed to
[35:41.160 --> 35:45.400]  increasing police budgets you understand that's how bad this is getting
[35:45.400 --> 35:49.600]  somebody that they're politically opposed to they try to set them up using
[35:49.600 --> 35:53.360]  a using guys who are operating as snitches they try to set them up for
[35:53.360 --> 35:56.760]  driving under the influence now those guys are going to jail but this is how
[35:56.760 --> 36:00.640]  this kind of program the beware program can be used against political
[36:00.640 --> 36:05.920]  enemies I mean exactly if you give them these tools then it's likely that at
[36:05.920 --> 36:09.560]  some point down the road they will be used for retribution yeah that's how
[36:09.560 --> 36:13.880]  it works again in any despotic society that you want to look at the more
[36:13.880 --> 36:18.080]  technologically advanced they get the more these kind of tools are used for
[36:18.080 --> 36:22.840]  snitch purposes to route people's business competitors their political
[36:22.840 --> 36:27.680]  enemies their family members who they got personal issues with so the
[36:27.680 --> 36:32.360]  corruption becomes so endemic that it moves beyond any aspect of law and
[36:32.360 --> 36:36.880]  becomes petty and personal exactly that's when you get a complete Gestapo
[36:36.880 --> 36:40.360]  state yeah you're talking about petty and personal these are people these are
[36:40.360 --> 36:44.800]  elected councilmen who don't want to increase the police budget as much as
[36:44.800 --> 36:48.680]  the police would like to have it so they're targeted and set up now Paul we
[36:48.680 --> 36:52.400]  also had this report that has come out today the Supreme Court I should say not
[36:52.400 --> 36:57.360]  a report but a decision the Supreme Court just decided by 8 to 1 that the
[36:57.360 --> 37:01.840]  police can stop your car even if they don't have a valid reason to stop your
[37:01.840 --> 37:05.720]  car they can then search you they just made it easier for the police to search
[37:05.720 --> 37:11.600]  your car in essence what it boils down to I think is essentially enacting the
[37:11.600 --> 37:15.680]  New York Police Department's stop and frisk law doing it on a much broader
[37:15.680 --> 37:20.240]  scale and what they said was in this particular case it was a car that was
[37:20.240 --> 37:24.920]  stopped in North Carolina the police officer said I'm stopping you because you
[37:24.920 --> 37:28.840]  only have one brake light well that's not against the law in North Carolina you
[37:28.840 --> 37:32.960]  can have just one brake light now to excuse this listen to the hoops that
[37:32.960 --> 37:37.160]  they jump through to try to justify this Justice Roberts who wrote the
[37:37.160 --> 37:41.080]  decision said I suspect most of you were surprised to learn that one brake light
[37:41.080 --> 37:45.360]  only is required in North Carolina even if you are from North Carolina my
[37:45.360 --> 37:50.680]  question would be don't the cops understand what the law is can they not
[37:50.680 --> 37:54.720]  count to two why would they if they're gonna pull somebody over and then
[37:54.720 --> 37:59.440]  search the car and then find something else to me that is a stop and frisk type
[37:59.440 --> 38:03.320]  of intimidation and when you combine that Paul with your article here about
[38:03.320 --> 38:08.200]  the beware program that is being subsidized for local police departments
[38:08.200 --> 38:12.640]  by the federal government they give $36,000 a year to pay for this for the
[38:12.640 --> 38:16.800]  local police department when you put that together is somebody going to run
[38:16.800 --> 38:21.200]  a beware score on you to get some kind of a threat assessment and then use that
[38:21.200 --> 38:26.840]  as a reason to pull you over of course they will well exactly the most chilling
[38:26.840 --> 38:31.280]  aspects of it for me is the recent purchases I mean will that include gun
[38:31.280 --> 38:35.000]  purchases will they say you're stockpiling weapons and ammunition and
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.760]  that's a reason to go and case your house or slap a GPS device on your vehicle
[38:40.760 --> 38:44.880]  I mean it's completely open-ended the abuse that this could lead to and again
[38:44.880 --> 38:50.800]  we have to keep emphasizing we're not anti-cop we're anti-corrupt cop yes the
[38:50.800 --> 38:56.040]  whole idea this is reflecting badly on the legitimate genuine police officers
[38:56.040 --> 38:59.480]  across the country because this corruption is not being stamped out and
[38:59.480 --> 39:03.800]  it's only being encouraged by the fact that the majority of these high-profile
[39:03.800 --> 39:07.600]  cases that the police officers in question never get in trouble so it
[39:07.600 --> 39:12.960]  never discourages this kind of behavior well we're pro due process and and
[39:12.960 --> 39:16.080]  that's why when I look at something like the Supreme Court decision where they
[39:16.080 --> 39:20.360]  say you don't have to have a reason to do it when the Constitution talks about
[39:20.360 --> 39:24.880]  having a reasonable cause they're talking about it in the context of going
[39:24.880 --> 39:29.320]  before a judge it doesn't mean as we use it in modern parlance reasonable says
[39:29.320 --> 39:34.920]  well I think that that's plausible no it means you have a reason you're going
[39:34.920 --> 39:39.800]  to go to a judge and you're going to say this is what I'm looking for this is
[39:39.800 --> 39:43.920]  why I'm looking for it this is where I'm going to look for it and he gives you a
[39:43.920 --> 39:48.760]  search warrant and when we take that away we are in a police state and we can
[39:48.760 --> 39:53.000]  see the effects of this we can see how the federal government just looking at
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.920]  this the name of this program that you're talking about here Paul the
[39:55.920 --> 40:02.040]  beware program everything is there to scare the cops to make them adversaries
[40:02.040 --> 40:06.960]  of the public to ramp up the threat and now they're assigning these scores to
[40:06.960 --> 40:12.680]  individuals exactly I mean somebody who worked within that company contacted me
[40:12.680 --> 40:16.600]  and said that everybody who works in that in on that program would they were
[40:16.600 --> 40:20.120]  all freaked out by it and they're trying to convince their superiors to abandon
[40:20.120 --> 40:24.880]  it so even the people actually working on it see how chilling it is and then if
[40:24.880 --> 40:29.800]  we can shift into this other article which is the MRAP situation obviously we
[40:29.800 --> 40:34.120]  had the exclusive video out of Spokane Washington where the sheriff's deputy
[40:34.120 --> 40:38.000]  said on tape we've got a lot of constitutionalists and a lot of people
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.240]  at stockpile weapons lots of ammunition they have weapons here locally that was
[40:42.240 --> 40:47.560]  the quote we put it out on info wars and then the Spokane County Sheriff
[40:47.560 --> 40:52.960]  Ozzy Knezovich if I'm pronouncing that right made this bizarre nine minute
[40:52.960 --> 40:58.680]  video in which he did everything in his power while failing completely to shift
[40:58.680 --> 41:04.960]  the focus away from the comments made by the sheriff's deputy and blame us for
[41:04.960 --> 41:09.200]  reporting on the issue apparently now it's our fault that the sheriff's deputy
[41:09.200 --> 41:14.520]  made these offensive comments and we're hate-mongering for drawing attention to
[41:14.520 --> 41:19.120]  it I guess what that puts us at the red level doesn't it Paul but there is at
[41:19.120 --> 41:23.520]  first they came out they had no comment Mikhail when he posted that story he
[41:23.520 --> 41:26.680]  got a comment from a an elected official in the area who thought it was
[41:26.680 --> 41:30.720]  outrageous after he looked at the video the video is outrageous but it's
[41:30.720 --> 41:34.960]  evidence of the way they're being trained by the FBI by the Department of
[41:34.960 --> 41:38.400]  Homeland Security and they came out and said it was taken out of context it's
[41:38.400 --> 41:42.920]  not taken out of context look at the video he's just going on and on about
[41:42.920 --> 41:47.400]  his wonderful new military toy that he's got and the lady asked him why do
[41:47.400 --> 41:50.800]  you need that here and he says because of constitutionalist because people have
[41:50.800 --> 41:56.480]  weapons people have ammunition that's why we need this and the sheriffs ran I
[41:56.480 --> 42:01.200]  mean he claimed we were taking it out of context because we didn't play all the
[42:01.200 --> 42:05.120]  other interviews with all the other officers but his main point of
[42:05.120 --> 42:09.380]  contention the context that we should have given it according to him and this
[42:09.380 --> 42:14.040]  makes absolutely no sense so it proves he has no case whatsoever is the fact
[42:14.040 --> 42:19.000]  that the woman who filmed the clip claimed that they had the MRAP tanks the
[42:19.000 --> 42:23.480]  armored vehicles out at this event to desensitize the children who were at
[42:23.480 --> 42:28.520]  this charity event to a militarized police state he said that because we
[42:28.520 --> 42:34.200]  didn't include what she said in the video that that somehow invalidates the
[42:34.200 --> 42:38.080]  offensiveness of what the sheriff's deputy said it doesn't matter what she
[42:38.080 --> 42:42.040]  said I mean she she could have said that the MRAP was being used to smuggle in
[42:42.040 --> 42:46.280]  you know little green men from outer space it's not about what she said yeah
[42:46.280 --> 42:51.000]  that's not the context the context of the clip are those comments in which the
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.680]  sheriff's deputy said yeah we need armored vehicles to deal with
[42:54.680 --> 42:59.440]  constitutionalists and people stop piling weapons which again translates as
[42:59.440 --> 43:04.280]  gun owners so it was a bizarre rant they should have just come out and
[43:04.280 --> 43:07.480]  apologize I mean the best thing they could have done is probably ignore it
[43:07.480 --> 43:11.680]  because now there's a huge protest taking place on Saturday outside the Spokane
[43:11.680 --> 43:15.760]  Police Department yeah talk about the protest that's being set up for
[43:15.760 --> 43:21.400]  Saturday exactly but instead of making an apology and deescalating the
[43:21.400 --> 43:28.520]  situation this sheriff merely said that the sheriff's deputy was cautioned for
[43:28.520 --> 43:33.800]  his choice of words okay not the actual meaning and content of his words his
[43:33.800 --> 43:38.800]  choice of words they failed to issue any kind of apology they didn't retract any
[43:38.800 --> 43:43.320]  of it and they blamed us for reporting on it and then the sheriff goes on in
[43:43.320 --> 43:48.120]  this nine-minute clip which is in the info wars article to justify these
[43:48.120 --> 43:53.280]  comments made by the sheriff's deputy by implying that Americans are a violent
[43:53.280 --> 43:58.960]  threat towards police and again look at the stats violent attacks against police
[43:58.960 --> 44:04.840]  are down violent crimes in general in America are down 40 percent you cannot
[44:04.840 --> 44:10.000]  justify the purchase or the acquisition of these armored vehicles by citing
[44:10.000 --> 44:13.840]  violence against police because statistically it's not a case that you
[44:13.840 --> 44:19.080]  can make there was the other example this is not an isolated case we had the
[44:19.080 --> 44:24.200]  purchase of a bearcat armored vehicle in Concord, New Hampshire last year the
[44:24.200 --> 44:29.320]  police chief justified the purchase of that vehicle by stating that it was
[44:29.320 --> 44:34.640]  needed to deal with sovereign citizens free status and occupy New Hampshire
[44:34.640 --> 44:40.560]  activists so basically that's libertarians and left wingers the
[44:40.560 --> 44:45.640]  armored vehicles are needed to deal with people's political free speech so this
[44:45.640 --> 44:50.080]  is a nationwide issue it's not an isolated example and that's why rightly
[44:50.080 --> 44:54.280]  people are up in arms over these comments that's why there's a protest taking
[44:54.280 --> 44:58.720]  place especially the issue that the sheriff needs to address and apologize
[44:58.720 --> 45:03.360]  for not make some bizarre claim that we didn't include the context of this
[45:03.360 --> 45:07.600]  woman's comments who was filming the police officer why that had anything to
[45:07.600 --> 45:11.480]  do with it whatsoever which is what basically he rambled on about for nine
[45:11.480 --> 45:15.800]  minutes in this YouTube clip making absolutely no sense whatsoever the
[45:15.800 --> 45:20.080]  context of this is what's happening coming out of Homeland Security we know
[45:20.080 --> 45:23.760]  that this sheriff's deputy didn't just come up with constitutionalists on his
[45:23.760 --> 45:27.000]  own we know that's what they're being trained for we know that's what they
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.840]  were doing across the country in New Hampshire this is Washington state and
[45:30.840 --> 45:34.320]  we've seen it in all points in between this is something that is coming out of
[45:34.320 --> 45:38.080]  Washington we've seen the documents that they release and we've seen the
[45:38.080 --> 45:42.960]  outrage in New Hampshire for example from the Marine Colonel who eventually
[45:42.960 --> 45:47.840]  came to Austin and spoke in our studio here Alex interviewed him you can go
[45:47.840 --> 45:51.280]  back and take a look at that interview he was absolutely outraged at the town
[45:51.280 --> 45:56.520]  hall meeting that they would equip their soldiers better than he as a Marine
[45:56.520 --> 46:02.480]  Colonel had his soldiers equipped in a foreign war he said what is this for and
[46:02.480 --> 46:07.240]  it is outrageous and this sheriff if he's trying to tell us that this is
[46:07.240 --> 46:12.400]  something that was just a poor choice of words that is very disingenuous because
[46:12.400 --> 46:15.800]  we know that those are the terms and those are the methods that they're
[46:15.800 --> 46:20.240]  using to try to militarize the police to try to build this perception of threat
[46:20.240 --> 46:24.480]  we see that from this article we've seen it from the scenarios that they've had
[46:24.480 --> 46:30.320]  in the past and we've seen it from the entire program this entire 1033 program
[46:30.320 --> 46:35.920]  exactly he cites the recent case tragic though it was of this cop that got killed
[46:35.920 --> 46:39.960]  by these two sovereign citizens who draped him in a gadsden flag which was
[46:39.960 --> 46:44.280]  horrible and tragic while he doesn't tell you is the fact that Americans are
[46:44.280 --> 46:49.160]  nine times more likely to get killed by police officers than terrorists 5,000
[46:49.160 --> 46:53.200]  Americans have been killed since 9-11 and again violent crime against police
[46:53.200 --> 46:57.880]  is going down as it's going down generally across the country so the
[46:57.880 --> 47:02.400]  threat is not Americans against police that threat is diminishing the threat
[47:02.400 --> 47:06.760]  is violent and militarized police officers as we've seen and then there was
[47:06.760 --> 47:10.560]  another bizarre comment that he gave to the spokesman review that he was
[47:10.560 --> 47:14.320]  reluctant to take the video from info wars seriously because of the
[47:14.320 --> 47:18.520]  conspiracy theories posted on the site so again he's trying to shift all the
[47:18.520 --> 47:24.200]  focus away from the comments made by the sheriff's deputy and transpose it on to
[47:24.200 --> 47:28.320]  the onto other content that's posted on our website as if that has anything
[47:28.320 --> 47:33.680]  whatsoever to do with this specific video clip absolutely the messenger shoot
[47:33.680 --> 47:37.920]  the messenger don't respond to what his officer said but just try to attack us
[47:37.920 --> 47:44.240]  individually personally yeah and then the campaign there in in Spokane why
[47:44.240 --> 47:48.000]  they're having this protest partly and the representative will be there as
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.040]  well is they're trying to get them to send back these modified assault rifles
[47:52.040 --> 47:56.880]  and these m-wrap tanks the sheriff's argument for not sending them back is
[47:56.880 --> 48:02.200]  because they were obtained for free that's his main argument as to why they
[48:02.200 --> 48:06.400]  shouldn't be sent back not because they're intimidating that they escalate
[48:06.400 --> 48:11.400]  hostile hostility intention between the population and the police department but
[48:11.400 --> 48:14.800]  because just because they got them for free that means they should keep them
[48:14.800 --> 48:19.280]  and continue to use them they got them for free like people would get a white
[48:19.280 --> 48:24.760]  elephant for free from the Rajah in India they have to maintain those vehicles
[48:24.760 --> 48:29.800]  they do not get them title turned over to them they are loaned to them by the
[48:29.800 --> 48:33.960]  Department of Defense they have to maintain them those are very expensive
[48:33.960 --> 48:39.680]  vehicles to maintain that cost is going to be borne by the local people but
[48:39.680 --> 48:45.320]  Paul it's really about a campaign of terrorism it's about striking fear and
[48:45.320 --> 48:49.600]  intimidation into the heart of the people and this both of these articles
[48:49.600 --> 48:54.040]  this social media looking at social media posts to determine the threat score
[48:54.040 --> 48:58.960]  of suspects telling the police that the population is a threat to them
[48:58.960 --> 49:03.320]  evaluating people giving them a score based on their purchasing activities
[49:03.320 --> 49:07.560]  based on their political beliefs and then doing things like telling people
[49:07.560 --> 49:11.800]  are looking out for constitutionalists all of this is about terrorizing the
[49:11.800 --> 49:18.160]  public displaying this massive amount of force it used to really it used to be
[49:18.160 --> 49:21.320]  something that only the Soviet Union and Communist China did they would have
[49:21.320 --> 49:26.120]  their May Day parades and they would run the big equipment down the streets on
[49:26.120 --> 49:30.640]  May Day to intimidate the population to show what big bullies they are now we
[49:30.640 --> 49:35.160]  have this being done by all of our local police departments at the behest of the
[49:35.160 --> 49:39.120]  Department of Defense who loans them these things and have to be that have to
[49:39.120 --> 49:45.800]  be maintained by the local citizens and just read what the police chief do
[49:45.800 --> 49:48.920]  vile said in New Hampshire the state of New Hampshire's experience with
[49:48.920 --> 49:52.600]  terrorism slants primarily towards the domestic type this was his
[49:52.600 --> 49:57.000]  justification for acquiring the armored vehicles groups such as sovereign
[49:57.000 --> 50:02.200]  citizens free status and Occupy New Hampshire free status basically just
[50:02.200 --> 50:07.160]  libertarians they're not connected to any violence whatsoever and then you know
[50:07.160 --> 50:11.040]  neither Occupy New Hampshire is just left-wing protesters that was the
[50:11.040 --> 50:15.560]  justification this is to police political free speech in America this is why
[50:15.560 --> 50:19.840]  they're buying the armored vehicles now it's on record yes absolutely yeah you
[50:19.840 --> 50:23.080]  look at things that the the quote-unquote terrorists the free
[50:23.080 --> 50:27.560]  status do they go around and they pay people's parking meters when they
[50:27.560 --> 50:31.600]  expire that's a rummeted program that they've got in keen New Hampshire that's
[50:31.600 --> 50:35.320]  the kind of threat to the police state that they are they basically cut off the
[50:35.320 --> 50:39.840]  police state's revenue coming from parking tickets but they're not terrorists
[50:39.840 --> 50:43.160]  and they're coming after people as you said Paul because of their political
[50:43.160 --> 50:47.560]  affiliations because the way they're being profiled this is extremely dangerous
[50:47.560 --> 50:52.600]  because we know about how our government uses SWAT teams in many cases against
[50:52.600 --> 50:56.160]  even the people that they're not looking for not only against innocent people but
[50:56.160 --> 50:59.720]  against the people who they're not even looking for we right back with Paul

[54:32.640 --> 54:37.320]  comments of the make on social media as well as the fallout from the video that
[54:37.320 --> 54:42.440]  was posted from a Spokane deputy bragging about what he needed his

[55:36.200 --> 55:42.800]  delivery by Christmas now Paul as we were talking in the last segment about
[55:42.800 --> 55:49.480]  what's happening with the police state I wanted to go in this very last segment
[55:49.480 --> 55:52.520]  back to your comments yesterday we were talking about the media narrative and
[55:52.520 --> 55:58.400]  how they were deliberately trying to walk back against attaching this terrorist
[55:58.400 --> 56:05.120]  event in Sydney to any to ISIS or to anything that was political we see this
[56:05.120 --> 56:09.640]  happening today with Obama failing to blame the Taliban for the mass school
[56:09.640 --> 56:14.280]  murder in Pakistan now what he did he did not use the name Taliban instead he
[56:14.280 --> 56:18.440]  referred to them as terrorists he said they're going to support the government
[56:18.440 --> 56:22.880]  of Pakistan its efforts to combat terrorism and extremism but not
[56:22.880 --> 56:27.800]  mentioning the Taliban what do you make of that well I mean we've seen that
[56:27.800 --> 56:31.880]  before with Obama but again I think it's tied to the fact that you know his
[56:31.880 --> 56:35.840]  Afghanistan and Pakistan policies being a complete failure and these drone
[56:35.840 --> 56:40.280]  strikes have created more radicalized extremists in the region so that's one
[56:40.280 --> 56:43.760]  reason why you would want to avoid that word but yeah if he talks about the
[56:43.760 --> 56:47.360]  Taliban if he talks about the Taliban people might say but wait I thought
[56:47.360 --> 56:51.080]  those are the people that we spent a trillion dollars to eradicate out of
[56:51.080 --> 56:55.320]  Afghanistan you mean the people that we spent a trillion dollars to defeat in
[56:55.320 --> 57:01.440]  Afghanistan just murdered 120 plus people in a school exactly and it's it's
[57:01.440 --> 57:06.560]  similar to the Australian case because as I explained yesterday after it came
[57:06.560 --> 57:11.080]  out who who the individual responsible was the media narrative kind of shied
[57:11.080 --> 57:16.280]  away from the fact that he was inspired by ISIS a lot of the media reports
[57:16.280 --> 57:20.160]  ignored entirely the fact that he got these hostages to say this is an ISIS
[57:20.160 --> 57:26.280]  attack on Australia he demanded an ISIS flag yet the media subsequently
[57:26.280 --> 57:30.920]  shifted almost instantly to blame it on a on a lone note with mental issues that
[57:30.920 --> 57:35.240]  was out on bail for a criminal matter so that it was interesting how that
[57:35.240 --> 57:39.320]  shifted when it came out that this guy had actually been brought into the
[57:39.320 --> 57:42.920]  country by the Australian government they've given him political asylum and
[57:42.920 --> 57:48.480]  used him as a spokesperson to demonize the Iranian government so they were
[57:48.480 --> 57:52.920]  quite they were quite reticent to identify the true motives that this
[57:52.920 --> 57:57.600]  perpetrator had when it came out that he actually was inspired by ISIS which of
[57:57.600 --> 58:01.440]  course grew as a result of the Obama administration and other governments
[58:01.440 --> 58:06.440]  destabilization of Syria so we see that happening over and over again now yeah
[58:06.440 --> 58:11.160]  we say that we are allying ourselves with rebels in Syria and I have both
[58:11.160 --> 58:15.240]  talked about that Alex has talked about it and of course in the Middle East we're
[58:15.240 --> 58:19.920]  allying ourselves with Saudi Arabia who has beheaded more people than ISIS has
[58:19.920 --> 58:24.400]  as well and then we have an article up on info wars calm that Saudi Arabia is
[58:24.400 --> 58:28.640]  now reportedly going to have a death penalty for smuggling Bibles thank you
[58:28.640 --> 58:32.080]  so much for joining us Paul Joseph Watson stay with us in the next hour
[58:32.080 --> 58:35.960]  we're going to be talking to Arthur author Marin Katooska about his books
[58:35.960 --> 58:41.440]  the Cold War laying out the dangers ahead of us economically and with wars
[58:41.440 --> 58:48.400]  they would this will be right back visit GCNlive.com today
[58:48.400 --> 58:53.800]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[58:53.800 --> 58:57.320]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[58:57.320 --> 59:01.360]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[59:01.360 --> 59:05.560]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[59:05.560 --> 59:09.400]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[59:09.400 --> 59:13.560]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[59:13.560 --> 59:17.360]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[59:17.360 --> 59:20.720]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[59:20.720 --> 59:24.400]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to
[59:24.400 --> 59:28.800]  start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[59:28.800 --> 59:32.640]  cannot escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild
[59:32.640 --> 59:36.960]  cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA the new Info Wars Life Lung

[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:27.720]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Tuesday December 16th
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:31.280]  2014 I'm David Knight your host today I'm gonna be joined in the next segment by
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:37.560]  Marin Katusa who wrote the Cold War this is a very fascinating book because for
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.760]  me a lot of these events I was aware of them I remember them I didn't have them
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:46.520]  in a timeline and a context that I want to read to you because I found this to
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:52.320]  be absolutely amazing the false flag techniques that Vladimir Putin used to
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:58.000]  hoist himself to the top this is something that parallels exactly what
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.200]  has happened with our government so many times in the last decade now there
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.520]  were four they had a previous war with Chechnya that basically left the Soviet
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:13.320]  Union embarrassed and looking ineffective he used a second Chechen war to
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:18.600]  make himself look very strong and powerful as a leader it was a short war
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:23.360]  even though the conflict stretched on for a long time they declared war they
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.800]  declared victory very early kind of like Bush with his mission accomplished but I
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:33.000]  want to read to you what led up to this now this is this is from the book the
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.440]  Cold War they said the first of four closely space terrorist attacks came
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:41.600]  September 4th 1999 in Dagestan now that would be in Chechnya there was a bomb
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:45.200]  that leveled a barracks that was housing Russian soldiers and their families 64
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.440]  Russian men women and children were killed five days later there was a
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:52.640]  bombing in Moscow this time an apartment building the working-class
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.840]  neighborhood in the city southeast had a device that had been stashed on the
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:01.000]  building's ground floor brought down all eight floors and killed 94 residents as
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.920]  they slept now here's the key within hours the Russian government officials
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.160]  all but certified that Chechen terrorists were responsible and calls for
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.880]  retaliation came from all political quarters instead of treating the site
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:17.520]  as an active crime scene however and sifting through the ruins the what did
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.640]  the Russian authorities do they raised the building just days after the blast
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.880]  and hauled the rubble away to a municipal dump where have you seen that
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:31.120]  happen before to an FSB storehouse not the FBI's storehouse like we do here but
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:35.680]  this is the FSB nothing was left for examination by third parties then four
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.120]  days later authorities are called early in the morning to check on suspicious
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.200]  activity outside another apartment building on Moscow's outskirts they
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:48.680]  left about 2 a.m. not finding anything they didn't notice a massive bomb in the
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.320]  building which exploded three hours later at 5 a.m. in the morning a nine-story
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:59.920]  building collapsed 121 died then came something very odd a speaker of the
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.880]  Dumas Russia's lower parliamentary house relayed to the parliament a report
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:08.520]  that he just received that an apartment building 700 miles south of Moscow had
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:13.960]  been blown up the previous night not in Moscow but in a different location okay
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:20.800]  so what happens is that didn't happen yet that happened later shades of the BBC
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:25.600]  announcing that building seven had collapsed now it said that seemed no
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.560]  more than an inconsequential blunder until three days later an apartment
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.480]  building in the city that he had named was indeed blown up and so a Duma member
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.200]  asked how did it happen that you told us on Monday about a blast that didn't
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:43.120]  occur until Thursday in lieu of an answer the questioner had his microphone
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:46.520]  cut off then it gets even more interesting then something very strange
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:51.960]  happened in Ryazan 120 miles southeast of Moscow they say everybody was on
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.640]  hyper alert looking for something to happen to an apartment building so some
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:00.400]  residents noted that a white car pulled up and two guys get out go into the
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.240]  basement and leave large sacks they call the police who then discovered 310
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:10.240]  pound sacks wired to a detonator and a timer in the basement they quickly
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:14.360]  evacuated the building a local explosive expert was called into disarm the device
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:20.040]  he determined that they contained an explosive RDX powerful enough to bring
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.720]  down the entire building as we've seen before in the meantime they blocked all
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:28.280]  the roads leading out of this town acting Prime Minister Putin flexes
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.840]  rhetorical muscles he says and congratulate the residents for the
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:34.920]  vigilance the Russian Interior Minister chimed in lauded recent improvements
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:39.920]  and then they found out they actually arrested the guys and they were with the
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:46.320]  FSB they were their CIA then they changed the story they said we were just
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.120]  testing your vigilance do you see how this happens it's called a false flag

[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:13.680]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:24.000]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today and we're
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.920]  going to be talking to Marin Katusa the author of the Cold War if you don't
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.800]  hear the previous segment based on your radio station if they're carrying the
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:38.640]  news in the previous segment I would suggest that you look at the online
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:44.080]  version of what I covered it was a very interesting chronology of the way that
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:49.720]  Putin used false flags to essentially ascend to power a lot of parallels to
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:53.560]  what goes on in this country or maybe even better yet buy the book this book
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:58.600]  is a page turner I really enjoyed it it has it puts a lot of events that I
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.440]  remember vaguely it brings them back freshens them up puts them in a
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:07.720]  timeline and more importantly puts them in a much larger context let's go to is
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:12.400]  is Marin on the line now okay let's go to Marin Katusa the author of the Cold
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:19.160]  War he works for Casey research he is a economics advisor he has a newsletter
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:24.520]  there as well as you manage a hedge fund don't you as well correct yes
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:28.960]  one of the largest Western Canada yes and I tell you what you certainly know
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:34.000]  the context and we've seen massive moves in the last couple of weeks we've
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.920]  seen the US Congress move to cover derivatives for the banks something
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:43.560]  that has massive implications for US taxpayers but we also see these that
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:48.840]  this massive move by Saudi Arabia to not cut production in the face of falling
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:54.360]  energy prices essentially creating a lot of problems for Russia already we
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:59.520]  see that the ruble has fallen 20% they have raised their interest rates to 17
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.040]  percent talk about that a little bit but you're nailing all these right on the
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:06.360]  head congratulations to you because your viewers are getting information that
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:11.320]  they're not getting in the you know the mainstream media what a lot of people if
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.720]  you want a breaking story what my sources in Russia are now telling me that
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:21.320]  actually Lavrov who's the equivalent of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs for
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:26.120]  the Russians has basically stated and warned that the Russians because now
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:30.680]  they view Crimea as part of Russia they're going to be moving nuclear weapons
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.440]  there and according to the Russian strategy do you want to talk about false
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:38.320]  flags here's the ultimate false flag where now the Russians are going to be
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:43.480]  moving nuclear weapons into Crimea which is a huge risk for the Western
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:48.840]  authorities now in the last 24 hours Germany is now also done a 180 on the
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.480]  U.S. sanctions and say wait let's time out here Germany does not want Russia and
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:57.920]  Turkey to solidify a long-term contract deal because the last thing Germany
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.400]  wants is to be vulnerable and for each for the European Union to be
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.760]  vulnerable and on Turkey's holding the tap so now Turkey is holding off on
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:10.960]  advancing the sanctions so we're in real time things are changing and the
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:16.120]  Russians have many more false flags to keep the turmoil going yes the oil
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.240]  price has gone down for Russia but what's important to understand is the
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:24.400]  ruble price has decreased much more than the price of the oil so if you're a
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:29.040]  Russian oil producer that's the best of both you know the best that you can
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:35.080]  possibly situation because you're still in a bull market or an uptrend in your
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.560]  oil so these are very important facts to understand that our Western media is
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:42.000]  not talking about you know one of the things that I'm concerned about is
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.280]  putting the American taxpayer on the hook for insuring through the FDIC
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.600]  program the derivatives market because there's already been reports that a lot
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.120]  of oil futures are going to be essentially worthless already that's
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:00.800]  happening as the future market starts to tumble that's going to spread out as
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.760]  we've seen in the past to other commodities as well as we're already
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:09.120]  seeing to the currency and in Russia and of course that's going to continue to
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:15.520]  spread to the larger stock market it is the biggest risk right now to the
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.560]  North American markets that nobody's talking about in our chat at the end of
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:23.880]  the chapter in our book the Cold War we get into exactly that why to understand
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:29.000]  that derivatives is so important and this really is nuclear economic weapons of
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.480]  mass destruction that who's regulating this which banks are going to be
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.160]  vulnerable and Americans need to understand is your personal savings at
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:41.080]  risk here and I'm telling you the implosion of the debt and the derivatives
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:44.440]  markets on the US shale everyone's thinking that's the Russians that are
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:49.000]  suffering the US shale sector significantly suffering at $55 oil
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.520]  so there's a lot of risks out there oh absolutely and to me it looks like a
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.280]  massive economic war course has already broken out with what's going on with the
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:04.240]  oil that's Putin's base is he's built his country as you pointed out his master
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:09.040]  plan is to base the country on natural resources so when they attack
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.400]  that meanwhile Putin is attacking the petrodollar which has essentially been
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:17.960]  the big leverage that America has had in terms of being the world's economy
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:23.240]  let's go back and talk let's kind of run this out talk about how this is not
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:26.240]  something that started with the Cold War this is what you point out is called
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.640]  the great game going back to Rudyard Kipling this is something that's been
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:32.960]  going on with Russia and the West for a long time talk about that a little bit
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:37.280]  definitely so let's bring it back to when you know it was the the western world
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:41.400]  that discovered oil in the Middle East and if you go to Iran and understand the
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:46.120]  history we go through all that in the Cold War but essentially the British is
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.440]  that's where they secured all their oil for World War two was through Iran and
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:54.160]  then the Americans came in in the 50s and they they overthrew the existing
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:58.440]  regime and then it backfired on them so then they moved over to Saudi Arabia now
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:03.520]  when the oil crisis in the early 70s happened America was faced with a double
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:07.600]  attack first of all oil prices quadrupled essentially in a few months and
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.320]  the second one was when the French basically called the US dollar and
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:15.280]  wanted their gold back Nixon had no choice but to close the gold window so
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.760]  now Kissinger had to come up with a plan and what he devised was he went to
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:23.320]  Saudi Arabia and said look this is what we need to do we can guarantee your
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.720]  family the house is sought a long-lasting regime but this is what you need to do
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.200]  you you can only sell your oil in terms of US dollars and then you have to
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:37.800]  reinvest those those currency that those reserves back into the US dollar and
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:42.600]  with Saudi Arabia is the most powerful producer of the OPEC nations then you
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:48.120]  had Kuwait follow Qatar UAE and other OPEC nations so that's the beginning of
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:52.920]  the the petro dollar and that has been very important to the average way of
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:56.680]  life of the average American that a lot of people don't realize is now at risk
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.400]  so what they did essentially was they offered a protection racket just as
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:04.800]  government and gangsters typically they say we're going to protect you in
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.280]  exchange for our protection our military weapons and we're going to make sure
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.040]  that your company that your country I guess we call it a company that your
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:17.200]  country remains secure and that the house of sound essentially stays in
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.280]  control here we're going to do everything we can with the CIA with the
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.240]  military industrial complex to protect you in return we're going to make sure
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:31.360]  that you price oil and dollars and then you take all the money that you get and
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:36.040]  you bank it at the Federal Reserve so there we've got the CIA as well as the
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.080]  Federal Reserve our two organizations that we're not allowed to audit both
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:44.920]  there and supporting the House of Saud and of course Prince Bondar 22 years as
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:48.520]  an ambassador to the United States now head of the Saudi intelligence service
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.720]  pushing very heavily for us to get involved in a war in Syria promising
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:58.480]  that Saudi Arabia would even pay our expenses if we would go to war with in
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:06.040]  Syria this is essentially somebody that is as tied in as a proxy for the CIA
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:11.040]  a proxy for the Federal Reserve in this area is it you've nailed it that's
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.800]  exactly what it is and you know Saudi Arabia really is a family corporation
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:19.960]  when I traveled to Kuwait and went to Iraq it really is a small rich class
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.800]  and then it's all the workers and there's workers from you know India Thailand
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:28.240]  across the world and they have no voting rights even though they try to say you
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:32.680]  know that everyone's equal it really isn't and it's really a shame that the
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:37.400]  the Americans are exposed that that's who your allies are it really is a
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:42.960]  suppressed society and you look at what's going on here even with Syria where
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:47.840]  Obama has failed foreign policy he was backing the exact individuals which
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.040]  today are ISIS this is really if you wanted to write a book about failed
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.240]  foreign policy all you have to do is just write a summary of what Obama has
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:59.160]  done in the last six years and it's sadly what every American needs to know
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:04.800]  the worst possible outcome of a failed US foreign policy is Obama's pushed
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:09.680]  Russia and China closer together than the last hundred years combined and that
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.120]  is the worst as possible aspect and that's part of what we're calling the
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.200]  Cold War news article today that just came out China's treasury holdings fall
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:23.920]  to their lowest since February 2013 they held 1.25 trillion dollars in US debt
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:28.840]  but as of October a 13.6 billion drop from September said the Treasury
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:33.720]  Department so already we see the Federal Reserve losing some of its clout
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:39.760]  there we that is a key part of the petrodollar that the the Federal Reserve
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:44.120]  keeps that clout there and of course the way that Putin is going to attack the
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:49.480]  petrodollar is using bricks the Brazil Russia India China South Africa he's
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:54.440]  going to use them to go around the American dollar and essentially take
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:59.520]  the American dollar away from being the world's reserve economy currency is that
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.440]  correct definitely and like I urge all your your your viewers to go to the
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:08.640]  Cold War website coldwar.com we've actually created videos to really make
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:12.080]  it an entertaining but more importantly educational aspect of what's going on
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:16.240]  right now with the Cold War and you know my book made the New York Times best
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.480]  seller list and we really nail what's going on it's not just about you know
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:24.960]  China and Russia but you look at France they've attacked the petrodollar they
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:28.720]  turned their back on the US dollar you look at what Canada is doing one of the
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:32.480]  major partners in the little brother of America they're now doing currency swaps
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:37.040]  outside of the US dollar you know the secret of the petrodollar the rest of
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.800]  the world's talking about it's only the American government that's trying to
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:44.360]  hide it and cover it up yeah it's I like your book because like I said before it
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:49.240]  puts things into a context and it and it is a real page turner I didn't expect
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:53.280]  to see that from an economics book anybody that likes history anybody that
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:56.960]  likes politics is is really gonna like this book I like the fact that you go
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:02.440]  back and into very old history and bring it up to the current level in so
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:05.080]  many different countries and in so many different ways and as you pointed out
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:09.480]  courses everybody knows after World War two the US was essentially in the catbird
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:14.200]  seat they were untouched domestically in terms of production they had most of
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:17.760]  the world's manufacturing capacity a large part of the world's gold and as
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:23.200]  you pointed out is that commodity started to come under pressure they moved
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:27.760]  over to essentially using oil as the economy as the commodity that's backing
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:32.120]  the currency I had never really thought about it that way before yeah and you
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.720]  know it's interesting about all this the average American and you never hear
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:39.920]  about this but you know sad for people to realize that even within the US the
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:45.600]  last 25 years the American electricity matrix is depended about 10% one in
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:49.640]  every 10 homes in America is powered by Russian nuclear fuel well hang on we're
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.320]  gonna be right back we're gonna go to commercial break with Marin Katusa the

[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:04.680]  information I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:08.520]  at my Patriots supply several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:11.640]  apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:15.760]  charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:20.960]  company run by Patriots for Patriots was born by Patriots supply has never taken
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:25.240]  a loan or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:29.640]  and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women it is rare to find

[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:21.440]  2014 I'm David Knight and we're talking to Marin Catoosa as this bio here points
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.800]  out he's one of the most successful fund managers in the energy and resource
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:28.560]  exploration sectors his hands-on approach has taken him around the world
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:33.440]  and he really understands the historical context this is an excellent book here
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:37.160]  the Cold War published by Casey publishing and of course that's Doug
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:43.040]  Casey's group and Doug Casey has been a guest with the here with Alex several
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:46.640]  times now just before we went to the break Mr. Catoosa you started to talk
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:52.160]  about the U.S. dependents on Russian oil tell us about that well it's actually
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:57.800]  the Russian nuclear fuel uranium and it's shocking to me that you know last
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:03.800]  year for example Russian company produced more uranium on American soil than
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:08.760]  all of the American companies combined that's shocking to me the America
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:13.640]  depends imports 90% of the uranium it consumes in America is the largest
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:18.960]  consumer of uranium in the world and more importantly 10% one out of 10 one
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:22.480]  out of every 10 homes in America is powered by Russian nuclear fuel this
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:26.160]  is shocking you know these are risks that people aren't talking about right now
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:29.760]  that Americans need to know it needs to be brought up to the politician so we
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:35.200]  can change this failed foreign policy and of course our energy our access to
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:40.040]  cheap energy affects not only our lifestyle but even our health our
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:43.600]  longevity in any country you can go back and you can show that access to cheap
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:49.160]  energy is the biggest producer of wealth in any country Putin understands that he
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:54.400]  has built his global plan as you point out in the book on the rich natural
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:58.320]  resources of Russia in terms of being very rich in oil and natural gas in
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:04.160]  terms of uranium on the other hand we have a president who even before he
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.560]  came into office said he was going to shut down the coal industry he said you
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:11.760]  could build it but it's going to you could build a coal plant but it's going
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:15.840]  to bankrupt you it looks to me like what he's trying to do is is bankrupt the
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:21.440]  country either by design or by incompetence the collateral damage of
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:26.320]  what Saudi Arabia is doing with the oil prices they may be aiming that at
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:31.520]  Putin or they may be aiming it at domestic competition from oil shale but
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:38.160]  either way it is very destructive of our country's wealth and it's
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:42.480]  something that is being that our closest allies Saudi Arabia that we supposedly
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:48.480]  are protecting is doing against us not just against the Russians you've nailed
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:52.720]  it I'm really enjoying the show because as a as a host as an interviewer you're
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:55.840]  really hitting all of the key subjects here and I do hundreds of these
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:00.120]  interviews a year and it's very rare that someone actually understands this to
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:05.240]  depth you do and what's really critical here is exactly as you stated I see OPEC
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:09.960]  with Russia and the US production in a three-way war it's about market share
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:15.480]  and what's critical to the petrol dollar US went from the largest customer to OPEC
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:20.560]  in Saudi Arabia to now a major competitor to Saudi Arabia Qatar and UAE
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:26.120]  where NGLs natural gas liquids and condensates are now competing for Qatar
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:30.720]  and Saudi market share at the same time the Russians are also competing with it
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:35.320]  and ironically what's going to happen is the side effect US shale production
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:40.240]  cannot compete with Russian production or Saudi or the OPEC Gulf the Arab
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:45.280]  States production so you're gonna see an implosion within the US corporate oil
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:48.720]  producers because of the debt level and it's gonna hurt because where of all the
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.720]  big high-paying jobs it in Obama's administration happened didn't happen in
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:57.080]  his green bubble revolution which is complete and fail it's happened in the
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:01.240]  Balkan where it's the lowest employment rates in America it's happened in the Eagleford it's
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.840]  the American energy revolution that has caused these high-paying jobs and these
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:10.560]  high-paying jobs are at risk and of course Marin I just read yesterday on the
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:15.080]  news here there was an article from the Telegraph in the UK talking about well
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.600]  this falling oil price is going to be good for us and the short term is
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:23.360]  consumers at the gas pump but you know we're going to have to keep level or
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:28.440]  maybe even increase rates to consumers for heating their homes because we're
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:32.240]  going to have to subsidize our renewable resources so they're not even going to
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.520]  pass along a temporary savings because we know this is temporary once Saudi
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:40.240]  Arabia or OPEC reestablishes their hegemony and energy prices you're
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:44.160]  going to see it skyrocket again that's always the game for the big guys to
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:47.400]  drive to take a loss they can they can hold on and take a loss for a while
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:51.560]  until they drive out their upcoming competitors and then once they do Katie
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:55.920]  bar the door they're going to hit us really hard exactly and Germany's even
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:59.760]  in a worse situation in the UK look at Germany a lot of people don't realize
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:03.520]  that in the last decade they've actually increased their oil imports from the
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:09.920]  former USSR by over 52% you look at their gas imports Germany needs the
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:14.880]  Russian oil and gas to keep its economy going and Germany's the the economic
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:19.000]  engine of Europe so Europe is so vulnerable here well you know one of
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.280]  the things that that we'll talk about we're running out of time for this
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.480]  thing we've got to go to a break and we're going to come back and talk about
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:29.200]  Putin because one of the things I liked about your book is it isn't a hagiography
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:33.280]  and it isn't a cartoon demon characterization of Putin you show how
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:37.240]  he's dangerous how he's competitive how his interests do not lie but compete
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:41.200]  with ours and in many ways I want to talk about that and I want to talk about
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:45.320]  the petro dollar you've got a chapter on post petro dollar we'll talk about that
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:50.200]  after we come back with Marin Katusa the book is the Cold War stay with us the
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:57.360]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.600]  sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind

[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:26.240]  were talking about the I said well I want to cover Putin's rise as well as the
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:30.560]  Petro dollar but before we get to that I want to get your comments as a fund
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:35.680]  manager about what's going on which is I just saw a notice that comics is going
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:41.120]  to implement gold and silver price limit collars effective on the 21st they're
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:46.120]  going to limit part price fluctuations will kick in at a hundred dollar moves
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:50.600]  in gold and three dollar moves in silver what are they concerned about looks
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:55.640]  like the Russian currency is crumbling we've got derivatives and oil that are
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:00.520]  coming in it looks like a very unstable time doesn't it it really is any as an
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:04.120]  investor whether you're a fund manager even at a retail level for all the mom
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:07.920]  pops out there what you have to understand is it's not true capitalism is
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:12.240]  a bug to Conrad economists that Casey research say it's about interventions
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:16.000]  and understanding what's going on so if you look at Obama's administration I
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.240]  would sum it up as he is increased the debt of the American government by over
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:24.920]  50% under his watch and he's made the worst decision so I call it financial
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:29.960]  heroin he's a he's made the system addicted to financial heroin and the
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:35.120]  worst thing for your viewers to understand to have is going to the next
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:40.720]  evolution and sector of this Cold War is to be exposed to the debt because look
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:43.720]  at the Russians are going through right now if your interest rates go up and
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:49.320]  you're exposed to margin calls or increased volatility be very careful
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:52.160]  that's why the derivatives when you mentioned them earlier so critical
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:56.720]  because as the petro dollar does collapse and it will then you get the
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:00.680]  derivatives kick in and who's going to control this that we're talking about you
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:04.360]  know quadrillions of dollars numbers that people can't even found them we're an
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:08.720]  uncharted territory here and we're already seeing oil derivatives coming under a
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:13.000]  lot of pressure many of them are already worthless people are scrambling to cover
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:19.520]  that I mean it's just the the the coming tidal wave of economic problems to me is
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:24.040]  just it's very apparent all these forces that are building up at the end of the
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:28.200]  year right now very very worrying let's talk for a moment about Vladimir Putin
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:31.640]  before we talk about the consequences you got a chapter in your book called
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:36.000]  post petro dollar I want to talk about the consequences of what happens when
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.440]  the we lose the petro dollar here in America but let's talk about Putin talk
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:44.720]  about his his rise to power what makes this guy tick well it's not money you
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:47.960]  know when you look at a lot of politicians he's the exact opposite of
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:54.320]  Obama what Putin truly believes is his mission on earth is to bring Russia back
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:58.680]  to its previous greatness under Peter the Great you know a good ideology of him
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:02.880]  is when he came into power you know he was the head of the basically what the
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:10.840]  we call the old KGB this guy is a Soviet trained he's brilliant but he's driven
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:17.040]  by national pride and he let me give an anecdote from your book you you pointed
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:21.000]  out that his grandfather who essentially mentored him was somebody who was a
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.040]  cook for linen and then Stalin he managed to survive the purges and there
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:29.360]  were even rumors that he was with the NKVD this is a guy that had a lot of
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:34.440]  influence on him in an early age he Putin went to the KGB and wanted to know
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:37.680]  what he could do and you report in his book that they told him well the best
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:41.360]  thing you could do if you want to get the KGB is get into get a law degree and
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:45.480]  they came looking for him when he went to law school and and recruited him at
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:51.080]  the age of 22 this is a guy who wanted he was caught up in the James Bond type
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.920]  of espionage stuff they had their own version of it in Russia he was caught up
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:58.400]  in that he got very interested in martial arts one to be a KGB person he's
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:05.360]  got a much different longer term point of view than Obama doesn't he he's working
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:09.600]  with the Chinese who plan in 2030 year cycles Obama plans according to his
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:13.800]  Twitter account which is by seconds so you know you can't compare the two but
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:17.400]  more importantly what this is all doing and the real threat here in the Cold
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:21.640]  War is the emerging markets are now working closer together than ever
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:25.560]  before and the Western markets you know the old allies of the US are trying to
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:29.400]  sit here well we can't do what the Americans want anymore for example
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:34.120]  Germany was really being pushed by the American sanctions onto Russia but now
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:38.800]  Germany's painted in a corner so really Obama's isolated his allies and more
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:44.920]  importantly has pushed his enemies closer together you point out that as we
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:49.480]  enact these trade sanctions we're essentially throwing fire on the
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:54.400]  de-dollarization in terms of removing the dollar as reserve currency explain
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:58.480]  that sanctions are just another form of war everyone's gonna lose in a
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:03.160]  sanction and you know it's sad that it's got to go that way because there's so
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:07.720]  many better alternatives but the sanctions are gonna come back and they've
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:10.800]  already backfired on the German economy it's starting to backfire and other
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:15.640]  European economies and remember winter is coming and Eastern Europe and Western
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:19.320]  Europe depends about a third of its natural gas on Russia Russia's not down
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.680]  and out never underestimate the Russians they have survived things that most
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:26.480]  people can't even fathom and Obama is underestimating you know remember when
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:31.000]  in the debate with Romney when Romney said Russia is our greatest threat and
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.720]  Obama laughed and said what are you talking about the Cold War ended 20
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:39.880]  years ago Obama's complete clueless to what's going on yeah absolutely and so
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:44.080]  is the American public too they don't remember as you point out in your book
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:48.760]  you said the you at one time Ukraine was Russia at the beginning of the interview
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:52.640]  you pointed out that it looks like a Putin is going to move nuclear weapons
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:56.680]  into Crimea they're not about to let Crimea go are they no definitely there's
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:01.960]  four creek key critical elements that is about Crimea first of all over 90% of
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:05.680]  people are Russian and Russian speaking so if you understand Putin strategy what
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:10.520]  I call the Slavic warrior mentality he's not gonna let any Russian be suppressed
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:15.320]  or be threatened more importantly it's about the gas pipeline second the
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:19.000]  offshore oil and gas deposits it's a deep sea warm port which is very important
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.720]  for Russians military and fourth the key critical critical part that no media is
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:29.800]  talking about is if Crimea stayed in even Ukraine or eastern Ukraine Ukraine
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:35.360]  can now import us and European goods and trade them to the former USSR states at
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:38.520]  a tax advantage that the Russians couldn't so it's also a threat to the
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:43.240]  US manufacturing strategy and Putin won't have any of it and they will defend
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:48.000]  Crimea as they will defend Moscow you point out in your book you go back to
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:54.040]  the Rose Revolution in Georgia talking about how at that time South Ossetia and
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:58.960]  another territory tried to secede from Georgia and of course at that point in
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:03.280]  time we were against self-rule and self-government just as we've seen with
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:09.560]  the Ukraine situation you know we are for Ukraine seceding from the Soviet
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:14.680]  well from Russia and then we oppose Crimea seceding from the Ukraine I mean
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:20.280]  there's absolutely cannot make a coherent argument for this it's just naked
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:24.840]  power politics that they're playing here with the with the energy that's going
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:29.720]  on here is like draw some parallels between the Rose Revolution and what we
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:34.480]  have just seen in the Ukraine with the Maiden Revolution sure so the Rose was
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:38.480]  first and it was really funded by the NGOs American money Western money coming
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:42.680]  in and it was the beginning but at the time Putin didn't get solidified he
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:46.600]  didn't take on the oligarchs yet at the time he didn't control the domestic
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:50.900]  Russian oil and gas and resources so he kind of stayed put and let things
[01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:55.120]  develop then we had the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and that was big
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:58.760]  that was very important that really showed a shift and now the Maiden
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:03.360]  Revolution is really the EU versus Russia back and used back by America and
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:07.920]  it's really the American incentive to fight the Russian foreign politics here
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:11.880]  it's a retaliation that most people in the West did not expect because they
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:15.160]  thought Putin would back down that is not the situation and if you want to
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:19.640]  compare to let's say the former Yugoslav Republic of Kosovo you know where
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:24.880]  America defended Kosovo is exactly what Russia is now doing for their side so
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:29.160]  you know we've been seeing flip-flop politics and there's a lot of flags of
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:34.400]  awareness and failed foreign policy on the Western sides and remember Putin's
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:38.440]  going to do exactly what's best for Russia's long-term strategy if it means
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:42.560]  going to economic war or physical war or supplying weapons or moving that
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:47.360]  nuclear weapons into Crimea Putin won't think twice about it absolutely he's
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:52.320]  got a long-term plan and part of that long-term plan includes moving into the
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:57.240]  Arctic doesn't it oh definitely that that's where that world-class deposits
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:01.120]  are and it's ironic that even though there were sanctions against Russia from
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:06.320]  the US Exxon America's largest oil producer was still moving forward and
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:10.360]  doing the offshore development and they didn't pull out they got an exception to
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:14.000]  complete that well because according to the terms of the contract if Exxon backed
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.080]  out they would lose billions of barrels of oil so it's an Exxon's best interest
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:23.080]  to work with Russia Exxon wants to work with Russia and it's all about the
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:29.200]  future world-class deposits and you know Exxon and other major American oil
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:32.640]  companies have realized that the political instability in the Middle East
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:36.480]  where other world-class oil deposits not worth the risk so there's not many
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:40.440]  places around the world that you can get billions of barrels of deposits and
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:44.920]  Russia's definitely one of the most important countries for oil natural gas
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:50.440]  and uranium you point out in your book that in the Arctic there's estimated to
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:55.920]  be 200 billion barrels over 10% of the world's total and you also point out
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:58.760]  that there's a lot of different competing claims the Canada's got claims
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:03.880]  their US Norway even Denmark just this last couple of days Denmark made a
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:11.200]  claim that they own the North Pole guess we should let Santa Claus know you know
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:17.760]  who would you want to back on that Russia with Putin yeah I think I think if
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:21.000]  it push comes to shove and it probably will I think Russia's gonna get there
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.640]  but you make another point here that I wasn't aware of so after 13 years of
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:28.000]  wrangling the UN's Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf awarded
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.320]  Russia jurisdiction over a 20,000 square mile area in the Sea of Akhash I
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:35.680]  guess is hey I don't know how you pronounce that but basically they've
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:40.760]  already had the UN aside with their territorial claims oh definitely and
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:44.280]  more importantly what no one's realizing is Russia is the world's largest
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:48.320]  country from just a landmass and they haven't even started their unconventional
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:52.720]  oil and gas development they're just going for the easy conventional stuff so
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:57.480]  Russia is so powerful and the emerging markets have realized that with Russia
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:01.080]  it's about business there's no political agenda there's no moral religious
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:04.600]  agenda the Russians want to do business with China and that's the deal and now
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:08.680]  they're pushed together dealing with with the Americans look Germany's realized
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:11.960]  the spying events that's happened under Obama's administration the Chinese have
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:15.840]  realized that and you know unfortunately all of this has come to
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:20.800]  fruition and the failed foreign policy has proven to be worse than we all
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:24.320]  expected it would be so America unfortunately has painted itself in a
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:28.600]  corner and really it's going to need another leader like a Reagan type someone
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:33.680]  to get Americans behind their leader to take on the emerging markets which have
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:37.600]  very strong leadership led by Putin I think it's going to require somebody who
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:43.520]  is going to repudiate our surveillance state the idea that we have a hegemonic
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:49.280]  claim on everybody's information I think that has left a stitch on the American
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:54.080]  government that is not going to be erased until we do something very visible
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:58.920]  very tangible to pull that back out I want to talk about another area and that
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:03.800]  of course is Africa and we saw Bilderberg group a couple years ago talking
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:06.960]  about how their big pushes were going to be big data that was before we saw the
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:12.960]  Ed Snowden leaks and also Africa we see Africa being created as recently as
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:17.880]  2007 so the US is definitely interested in the natural resources of Africa but
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:24.440]  of course Putin who bases all of his plans on natural resources is very
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:29.760]  interested in Africa talk about that oh definitely it ends with the Chinese the
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:33.560]  Russian Chinese are working together and they are literally two decades ahead of
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:36.960]  America when it comes to the infrastructure the deposits the largest
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:41.960]  onshore oil discovery in the world in the last decades was a company Doug Casey
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:45.400]  and I were involved with and they proved up you know billions of barrels of oil
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:50.120]  on eastern Africa and Kenya it's called East African rift and ironically when
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:54.280]  you go there it literally looked like a pick out of a James Bond movie where
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:57.240]  they're all wearing their orange overalls and they're happy to work and
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:00.880]  they're all Asians you don't see North American companies working there it's
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:07.320]  all Russian and Chinese drillers Russian and Chinese geophysics you know China's
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:10.680]  been there they're gonna write the infrastructure checks they're moving
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:14.120]  forward for the development because it's about a secure supply and the Russians
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:17.960]  and Chinese are planning for 20 30 40 years out to keep their economies going
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:22.920]  oh absolutely and of course we had Obama go and make his agreement with China
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:27.880]  that we were going to over 11 years cut our energy use by 25 percent but China
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:32.240]  is going to be allowed to continue to expand for 16 years unabated at which
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:36.640]  point they won't have a cut but they'll have a cap it's okay for them under I
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:40.480]  guess we're not concerned about global warming it's only a concern when it is
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:45.320]  something that is generated by the US or Western governments you know it's
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:48.800]  ironic you bring up a brilliant point here that reminded me during the APEC
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:52.440]  conference Obama made a big deal about the co2 contracts and you know the
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:57.240]  limitations and in our Western media they really try to portray Obama as you
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:01.360]  know true foreign icon with his presidency if you read the Chinese
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:06.760]  papers it was almost a mockery where the Xi Jinping the president of China came
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:11.840]  out and said look Obama calm down tiger let you fill a sea by drops at a time
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:15.400]  we're still in drops here take your time let's not to make a big deal out of
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:19.160]  this contract but from the Western media was the APEC conference was all about
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:23.000]  this you know agreement where the Chinese kind of completely thought
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.880]  nothing of it I guess that's one of the things that really strikes me about your
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:32.080]  book Marin and that is the fact that Putin is very methodical taking a long
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:36.000]  view not only just for himself but also for his country he's actually doing
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.680]  things to help Russia it's not in America's best interest the things that
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:42.440]  he's doing but he's actually working to help his country whereas we have leaders
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:47.480]  who look to be actively undermining actively trying to bankrupt our country
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:51.040]  whether it's with open borders and a clowered and piven strategy or whether
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:56.640]  it's taking down our energy production or taxing away our energy use it seems
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:02.200]  like the our own government is our worst enemy but let's talk about one of
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.920]  your final chapter I think it is your final chapter here a post-Petro dollar
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:10.440]  America you point out that the decline of the British pound took 30 years and
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:15.440]  two world wars and to unwind the empire took longer is that going to happen with
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:19.320]  the United States or maybe as you think there's going to be factors that argue
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:23.920]  that the undoing of the dollar will be very abrupt and very disturbing tell
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:27.360]  us how you think that's going to play out and why you think that's going to be
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:32.160]  abrupt and and massive it's gonna be very disturbing for those who are not
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:35.880]  prepared and protected you need insurance whether you have health insurance or
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:39.440]  car insurance you never plan on using it but when you need it that's when you
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:45.080]  want it and it's all about preparing and basically preventing being exposed to
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:48.360]  the derivative defaults the collapse of the petro dollar and it's actually quite
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:52.200]  simple to do so number one live within your means is stay out of massive debt
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:55.720]  and don't leverage yourself number two have a little bit of gold exposure
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:50:00.400]  physical gold because that is an insurance hedge to a depreciating dollar
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:03.640]  now everyone in the Wall Street talking about how great the US dollar is
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:07.600]  that's exactly when you need insurance when you're dragging 200 kilometers or
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:11.640]  150 miles per hour with your top down thinking what great of a day you know
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:15.080]  you need to have that insurance so that's the first place to start and then
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:18.880]  we get into different aspects but you know when the petro dollar collapses and
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:23.240]  it will and every empire collapses literally the average way of life for
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:26.800]  the American is going to be cut in half overnight and everyone's gonna sit there
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:31.440]  going what happened except those who are prepared for it and as you point out
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:36.520]  we have the world's largest military we've taken a hit and most other aspects
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:41.840]  of our productivity we had our manufacturing base decimated yet we
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:47.080]  have a massive military and of course some people see their lifestyle cut in
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:51.280]  half as you just mentioned they're going to look for an enemy outside of the
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:54.840]  country and that's when things are going to get hot stay with us we've got one
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:58.880]  more segment with Marin and he'll be right back with his book the colder

[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:13.000]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David and we're talking to Maren
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:18.360]  Catoosa of Casey research and his book the colder war I would highly recommend
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:23.440]  this book it's a very interesting read any student of history or politics
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:27.280]  anybody who wants to get an understanding of what I think are our
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:30.640]  things that are on the horizon we've seen a lot of very ominous signs we've
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:34.560]  seen Russia's central bank hiking key interest rates in just the last day or
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:39.440]  so to 17% that's their interest rate they've seen their currency tumble by
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:44.240]  20% we see Goldman Sachs is a headline up on info wars.com Goldman Sachs says
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:50.040]  oil prices can go lower for much longer and that the oil prices reveal cracks in
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:54.160]  our economy of course as we even though we see cheap oil we're not seeing the
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:59.280]  economy responding to this it's still laying there not doing anything but
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:02.880]  the Saudis are going to keep producing and that is something that is aimed
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:08.840]  directly at American production and independence of oil it also is something
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:14.720]  that is hurting Russia and of course Vladimir Putin is determined to use his
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:21.360]  alliances to destroy the petrodollar are essentially our reserve currency now one
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:26.400]  of the things that you have here in your post petrodollar chapter here Marin is
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:30.640]  called the bomb in your basement we talked at the beginning of the hour we
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:37.360]  talked about how Putin rose to power with false flags bombs being placed in
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:41.680]  apartment buildings and taking out the entire apartment buildings but this is a
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:45.240]  bomb that is in the basement of everybody here you mentioned some things
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:49.040]  that people can do individually to prepare but the derivatives that we are
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:54.320]  now on the hook just a week or so ago when they came up with this budget from
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:58.360]  Boehner and the Democrats putting Americans on the hook to ensure the
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:02.920]  derivatives that the banks have set up talk about the scope of that and what
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:07.640]  can happen as that blows up it is so risky I'm shocked that the media hasn't
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:12.760]  talked more about this this individual piece of legislation is
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:18.080]  essentially the world's strongest economic weapon of mass destruction that
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:23.320]  has been created ever the risks across the board to your pension funds to the
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:27.440]  government from the state to federal level this truly is a shocking element
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:31.160]  and yet who does the government put the blame on the working-class citizen who's
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:34.240]  gonna have the right unlimited checks who's regulating these derivative
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:38.240]  markets people don't even understand I teach calculus in a university these
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:42.400]  derivative markets are so complex that my colleagues who are PhDs and calculus
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:46.280]  don't understand this stuff it's a bunch of maverick bankers who have the
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:50.920]  Washington in their back pocket and they basically have carte blanche here this
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:55.960]  is a huge risk it's very annoying because they're not producing anything
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:59.720]  they're basically shutting down in a war on people who actually produce
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:04.560]  manufactured goods people who produce energy those are the bad guys and yet
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:07.720]  the guys who come up with these artificial constructs as you said these
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:12.600]  complex derivatives that are not tied to anything they're not producing anything
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:17.400]  that anyone can use it's merely a scam from these large banks they're the ones
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:20.720]  who are now going to get protection and we saw at the same time that they moved
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:27.400]  the derivatives to get FDIC protection they also started making some moves to
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:31.520]  say that they can come after pensions and the commitments that have been made
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:34.160]  by private corporations to their employees for a long period of time the
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:37.800]  handwriting is on the wall they're coming after the entire enchilada they're
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:41.600]  coming after the wealth of individual Americans as well as our energy
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:46.560]  independence are they well it you know Obama is not just at war with the
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:51.680]  savers and workers of America he's doing more for the foreigners like Putin
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:54.560]  Putin couldn't have a better ally running America and they're at war
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:59.520]  together so Obama's doing everything wrong for the average working class
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:03.400]  hard-working American and this is gonna come back and it's ironic that you know
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:07.600]  Putin Obama's all about you know the average American well he's gonna need

[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:39.040]  background as to what's going on there's all kinds of ominous signs we see in
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:45.280]  the financial markets as well as the legislation that was passed as part of
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:51.880]  the the Boehner budget betrayal I should call it we're gonna take your calls at
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:57.200]  800-259-9231 if you have any comments about that I also wanted to go over some
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:02.600]  of the news that's been happening and we've got a couple of big trials one
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:08.280]  that's not going to happen another one that we are going to have a verdict
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:13.600]  coming out soon we have reported from anti-war.com that the US Army today has
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:18.280]  announced that it is going to cancel a two-day pretrial hearing at Guantanamo
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:22.240]  Bay that's related to the FBI infiltration of defense teams for
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:26.800]  detainees they provided no reason for the cancellation now the interesting
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:31.840]  thing about this is that we learned that the FBI had infiltrated the defense
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:35.600]  teams of five different detainees and what they were doing was collecting
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:43.960]  intelligence and essentially spying on the defense teams spies inside the
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:48.720]  defense teams reporting back presumably to the prosecution as to how these guys
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:53.880]  were going to defend their clients and they say the new hearing was supposed
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:58.560]  to explore what other efforts the FBI had launched but it seems now that that's
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:03.560]  not going to happen and we also have a report up on info wars.com political
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:08.200]  prisoner Barrett Brown to be sentenced tomorrow and this is why the results
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:13.160]  matter to freedom in America you need to read this article it's from Liberty
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:17.640]  Blitzkrieg and he points out the feds went after Barrett Brown and the same
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:22.160]  way they went after Aaron Schwartz that they say led to the suicide of a ladder
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:27.160]  I'm not so sure that it was a suicide we see this always being called suicide
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:30.600]  nevertheless they came out with a bunch of trumped-up charges they say
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:35.120]  including that of copying and pasting a link there you go see it's it's a crime
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:39.640]  to even link to something and that was the key thing they say that charge was
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:42.720]  later dropped but they're still threatening him with a hundred and five
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:47.480]  years in jail he's now served over two years in a federal penitentiary without
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:52.320]  bail and his sentencing is tomorrow he still faces ten years in jail for
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:58.200]  exposing the shady relationship between intelligence contractors and the US
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:02.480]  government that's how bad things have gotten and they point out here they said
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:06.600]  all of this makes sense only if you understand what Barrett Brown did he
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:10.960]  spent the beginning of 2011 advocating for the effectiveness of anonymous as a
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:15.080]  force that could bring bring transparency to institutions and to
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:20.080]  government through digital protests but that's the last thing we want in
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:25.800]  America isn't it transparency we don't get transparency even from our local
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:31.280]  government officials they're all acting as if they're part of the CIA as if
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:34.800]  they're all James Bond and you know they also think they've got a license to
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:38.800]  kill that's exactly what the mother of the 12-year-old who was murdered by the
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:43.360]  cops as he was holding a BB gun and you can see the video footage he doesn't
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:47.000]  give him a chance he's not doing anything threatening to anyone he pulls up
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  jumps the cop pulls up and jumps out of the car and shoots the kid down and the
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.400]  mother says you're not James Bond you don't have a license to kill and yet we
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:04:00.640]  see that is what they're training the local police and we have a article up
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:06.560]  on info wars.com we talked to Paul Joseph Watson about earlier the fallout
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:11.720]  from the video that we showed yesterday and from Spokane Washington where a
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:16.720]  sheriff's deputy was bragging about his MRAP vehicle and said that when questioned
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:19.160]  why he needed something like that said it was for the constitutionalists well
[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:24.800]  now the sheriff has posted up a very long rambling response to that
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:29.760]  essentially attacking info wars you can see that video you can see the original
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:34.360]  video you can see his response to that and you can see our comments about that
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:41.360]  but that video speaks for itself and the context is one of a government that is
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:46.880]  training law enforcement to view everyone as a threat to view us as all as
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:51.280]  terrorists and to militarize the police department and we can see how petty that

[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:17.000]  Eric in Germany you want to talk about Hollywood on Russia go ahead yeah
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:21.880]  absolutely hey David um we all know that Hollywood has many many examples of
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:26.060]  foreshadowing events that have in turn happened for example the x-files in 9
[02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:30.760]  11 and the past weekend I was watching a old movie it's not old it's from last
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:35.240]  year it was wasn't big but it was Jack Ryan shadow recruit and there's a
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:40.520]  speech in it and if you were to YouTube Jack Ryan zero hedge it's the first thing
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:46.640]  that comes up and I put it on zero hedge a couple days ago this will send chills
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:51.880]  up your spine it is the creepiest thing because you know whoever wrote this
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:56.920]  movie they had some creative art degree from Berkeley you know they don't
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:11:00.640]  understand the foreign exchange market they don't understand how to use
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:04.920]  currencies as a weapon but when you listen to the speech you for people who
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:09.240]  know how foreign exchange works it's the creepiest thing because it's how to
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:13.120]  destroy the American financial system and I'm not saying the Russians would do
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:16.720]  this to us because the Russians they have enough problems of their own they
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:20.120]  don't need to start a war with the state but we all know that our banker
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:24.760]  oligarchs are you have to start the war with someone so they can distract the
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:28.720]  population from the coming bail in the collapse of the dollar the collapse of
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:34.240]  the stock market which is going to wipe out everyone's pension I'll get off the
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:37.320]  phone and let you respond maybe you can take a look at the video over the next
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:42.280]  break and I can give us a while we got listeners on on the phone give us a
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:46.840]  gist of what they do if you can summarize it very quickly to take down
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:52.000]  the US system sure the gist of the speech is that there will be a terrorist
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.200]  attack on the United States and thereafter there's a terrorist attack
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:01.520]  all the foreign exchange reserves held by Russia in United States treasuries are
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:06.440]  dumped into the open market so for those people who don't know how the secondary
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:09.520]  bond market works when the American government borrows money it sells a
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:13.560]  T-bill and this T-bill it doesn't just stay in someone's pocket it's like stocks
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:17.280]  you can buy and sell them so when there's a ton of these T-bills available the
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:22.400]  price goes down which means the interest rate on that note goes up so Russia
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:26.720]  right now holds well over 100 billion dollars worth of American T-bills now
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:30.720]  one thing you can that interesting is earlier this year Belgium a country that's
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:35.200]  very small started purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of American
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:40.720]  federal debt within a very very short window most speculation that it was the
[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:44.920]  Russians purchasing this debt so let's say hypothetically that the Belgian
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:49.920]  purchasers plus the official Russian sovereign holdings of T-bills the
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:53.360]  Russians have two to three hundred billion dollars in American debt that
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:57.320]  would put them number four behind China Japan and the Treasury and the Federal
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:01.320]  Reserve if they were if we were to have a terrorist attack we all remember what
[02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:06.840]  happened the day when the market opened after 9-11 it went down 600 points if we
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:10.680]  would have a terrorist attack and the next day or later that day Russia
[02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:16.120]  liquidates all of their Federal Reserve it would be the end of the impetro
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:19.640]  dollars we know it we know that Putin wants to take down the dollar as the
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:24.000]  world's reserve currency he's working in off on a swift swift alternative he is
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.120]  doing currency swaps he's got currency swaps going with New Zealand
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:33.240]  Australia India China Brazil and South Africa right now he's trying to create
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:38.720]  another system that runs parallel to the dollar this is you can Google this
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:44.360]  CNN Fox Bloomberg it's very very well documented and the idea behind this
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:49.680]  movie and behind this speech is that there's a terrorist attack they liquidate
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:54.760]  Russia liquidates the reserves when the market the Treasury bill market is
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:59.960]  overwhelmed with supply the interest rate on American debt will go up now
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:03.880]  right now the American government paying about two and a half to three percent
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:09.240]  to borrow money for ten years a hundred year average is five to seven percent so
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:13.760]  right now just to service the outstanding debt the American federal debt
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:20.080]  it's about 11 percent of the annual budget or about 300 billion dollars per
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:25.440]  year just interest on our debt but this is with interest rates right now at all
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:31.960]  time lows hundred year lows what happens when this interest rate goes back to the
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:36.400]  hundred year average is not let's not say five seven ten let's just say four
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:40.080]  percent a lot of people think oh well we pay two and a half you go to four it's
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:43.880]  not that big of a deal you know it's a percentage and a half we can afford that
[02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:47.520]  but the bond market and the way the government is able to fund itself it
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:51.400]  doesn't work this way because we're paying two and a half percent right now on
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:55.520]  a ten-year note and it's 11 percent of the budget well you know what's really
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:59.520]  amazing is it's almost like as a point out in the interview it's like we got
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:04.960]  economic warfare and it's like bombing each other's cities I mean I'm looking
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:07.960]  at this article from Russia they're they're facing some of the same stuff
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:10.640]  you're talking about that's already hitting them they're seeing their
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:13.920]  interest rates jump up to 17 percent and they point out in this article from
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:18.720]  RT that the interest rate hike is the sharpest since 1998 and then they saw
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:24.200]  rates higher than 100 percent and essentially Russia defaulted on their
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:29.840]  debt in 1998 I mean this is massive economic warfare that is unfolding right
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:36.680]  before our eyes both of them are going at it Russia as well as as our side and
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:40.760]  I guess the bad thing Eric is that I get the sense that we're under friendly
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:45.160]  fire as well from the Federal Reserve aren't we well absolutely the Federal
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:49.600]  Reserve right now they have interest rates at zero but inflation according to
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:54.680]  CPI and we all know the CPI is cooked inflation is sitting at a mere two percent
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:58.360]  roughly but if you look like the Walmart inflation index which measures the
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:02.400]  cost of things like food that isn't included in the CPI it's closer to four
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:07.480]  or five percent so your money sits in your bank account earning nothing yeah
[02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:11.040]  but losing five percent of your spending power every year you're getting
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:17.440]  hammered what's interesting with this foray with Russia right now is that
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:22.560]  Putin I don't think is returned fire yet he's kind of taken the first assault if
[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:26.400]  we've seen the movie Kingdom of Heaven Orlando Bloom there's a first assault
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:31.840]  right and they wait yeah and they wait and we all have seen hunt for the red
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:39.120]  October mm-hmm and yeah he's he's got a plan he's got a long-term plan and you
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:43.160]  know he's kind of like the kind of like the honey badger I mean just keeps going
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:48.240]  and you know so so we're playing checkers and he's playing chess but you
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:52.080]  know like I said before the really scary thing to me is the fact that we are
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:56.000]  also under friendly fire from our own president from the Federal Reserve which
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:00.920]  is allied against us and of course from the CIA's proxy the Saudis who are
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:04.760]  essentially attacking our own American energy independence thank you so much
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:13.200]  Eric that was very informative let's go to Jeremy and Colorado Jeremy I'm
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:17.000]  actually glad I got to talk to you because if I remember right you have an
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:22.800]  engineering background I wanted to talk about well energy independence and in
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:27.360]  this case particularly water fuel conversions I know it's come up in these
[02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:34.000]  kinds of circles a lot HHO Browns gas and such but I wanted to mention a video
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:40.120]  if you type in on YouTube revelation of truth 10 revelation of truth 1 0 as we
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:43.560]  done specifically like that or else the results will get buried at a bunch of
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:49.760]  Bible revival related material but it it talks it's all source video pertaining
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:54.160]  to Stanley Myers work in the stuff he pioneered and I came across some other
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:59.520]  material that actually I guess makes it more practical and easier to understand
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:05.200]  at educate dash or self org the reason I'm bringing this up is because you know
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:09.680]  what with the instability in the you know global oil markets and energy
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:14.520]  independence and all the you know the appending disaster scenario this is not
[02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:19.560]  one of those topics that can be that we can afford to say oh it might be able
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:23.960]  to be we might be able to do it might be able to I don't know speculate and
[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:29.240]  debate on it it's one of those things that I mean as far as just getting up
[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:35.600]  from underneath the thumb of I guess the the oil cartel yeah one of the things
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:39.760]  it was interesting about the Cold War the book that we just talked to the
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:44.880]  author in the last hour about was of course the rise of oil as an energy
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:48.480]  source and of course along with it the rise of John D. Rockefeller he pointed
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:51.920]  out that he had a fortune that in today's dollars would be about three
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:55.920]  hundred and forty billion dollars saying that he was as far as we can reliably
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:19:00.900]  assert ascertain the richest man ever in history he pointed out that back in the
[02:19:00.900 --> 02:19:05.560]  thirteen hundreds it was a guy who owned half of the world's gold and half of
[02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:10.120]  the world's salt which were salt was a very expensive commodity at that time
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:14.240]  back in the thirteen hundreds presumably he might have been wealthier but you
[02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:17.920]  know you can't really correlate going back that far but certainly if you look
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:21.960]  at John D. Rockefeller he was very powerful and so what we have here is a
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:27.640]  lot of very powerful vested interests we have the largest producers of oil in
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:31.960]  the world are not the private companies as he points out but the the national
[02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:38.120]  governments like Saudi Arabia so there is a lot in the way of people coming up
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:42.480]  with energy and independence there's a lot that's there to shut people down
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:45.960]  just look at what's happening to the oil shell business I mean even something
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:52.120]  that is kind of a side business look at how Saudi Arabia reacts to domestic
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:55.480]  production of oil they quickly drop prices in order to put them out of

[02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:12.840]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David I we're here taking your calls
[02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:16.800]  before we go back to your calls though I wanted to point out an article that's
[02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:22.640]  up on info wars.com the ultimate guide to the mainstream media and American TV
[02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:27.480]  networks how media pundits are interconnected with the CFR and with
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:30.920]  each other now this is an article that was originally up on RT Kit Daniels
[02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:34.880]  pointed out to me we posted it up and they have subsequently taken their
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:39.080]  article down and I guess the question is what was it they didn't want you to see
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:44.440]  I don't know but it's more than just a tale of consolidation I think they put
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:48.000]  it back up I was just told they put it back up it's still a very good article
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.840]  you should take a look at this because we've shown many times how
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:54.920]  consolidated the mainstream media is being owned by only a half dozen
[02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:59.400]  different companies but this also interconnects it with the CFR and of
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:03.720]  course the council on foreign relations has dominated the State Department since
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:10.200]  its inception in the early 20th century and even though Reagan was not a member
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:15.520]  of the CFR as soon as he got to be president he put about 360 people I
[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:20.000]  believe if I'm correct from the CFR into the State Department so they
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:25.560]  dominate our foreign policy that particular think-tank and there's much
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:28.360]  to be said about that we won't go into it but look at that guide it's up on
[02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:31.680]  info wars.com the ultimate guide to mainstream media I think you'll find it
[02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:35.840]  very interesting lots of graphs and charts there as well let's go back to
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:43.120]  your calls let's go to Eleanor in Missouri go ahead hi I thank you for
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:50.560]  taking my call I wanted to just comment on the first guest I think that or the
[02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:55.760]  first I'm sorry the first caller I think that he was right on with the false
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:26:01.200]  flag thing but I wanted to ask you do you think that this whole scheme can wait
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:06.760]  until the September-October timeframe that they're always pulling these? I
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:12.600]  really don't know I mean when you look at all of the the signs in the economic
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:17.000]  signs that are that are queuing up here already we've seen a massive upheaval
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:21.760]  from this manipulation of the price of oil that's going on by Saudi Arabia and
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:24.840]  there's a lot of we've been talking about all the different aspects of that
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:30.280]  it's already having a massive effect on Russia's currency on their interest
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:33.840]  rates we know that it's having a massive effect on oil derivatives in this
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:38.880]  country and of course we are all on the hook for those derivatives now we were
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:43.520]  put on the hook by it by the Boehner budget betrayal along with the Democrats
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:48.960]  they essentially have the American taxpayers unwriting underwriting this
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:54.240]  massive speculation this gambling by the major banks that's something that had
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:58.840]  been taken off with Dodd-Frank and now they put that back in as part of this
[02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:03.600]  budget deal so there's a lot to be that they can happen out of this and of
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:08.480]  course we also pointed out that they have put effective next Monday they're
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:12.760]  going to put limits on the movement of silver and gold now they didn't do that
[02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:16.200]  before when silver and gold were plummeting because they were dumping
[02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:19.280]  those but now they're concerned I think that people are going to be running for
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:22.760]  safety when they see currencies collapsing when they see the derivatives
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:26.560]  market collapsing so I don't really know what's going to be happening but some
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:30.600]  very very ominous signs what's your take on it Eleanor
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:37.240]  well I've been looking in the Internet and you know look in chat rooms and stuff
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:43.160]  like that and they a lot of the people think that in February it'll all fall
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:47.840]  apart well it's hard to predict the timing but you know the simple fact the
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:51.320]  matter is as I point out the other day these these banks with a little bit of
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:54.440]  lobbying they spent a few million dollars and they got essentially a
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:58.480]  quadrillion dollars worth of insurance depending on how you estimate the
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:02.080]  derivatives total derivatives market and it's hard for anybody to do that because
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:09.120]  it is so incredibly complicated and so nevertheless it's an astronomical figure
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:14.480]  and they were able to get that insured for like $1 per trillion dollars worth
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:18.320]  of insurance that they get now you can't get that from the bank because they
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:22.720]  know that you're eventually going to die we should not be giving that to these
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:26.600]  bankers with their derivatives because we know that these are derivatives are
[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:29.760]  eventually going to blow up it's just a question of timing as for what the
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:32.560]  timing is going to be whether it's going to be in February whether be in this
[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:37.080]  this spring or whether it's going to be next fall who knows they could set things
[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:41.880]  in motion that they don't have total control of bigger picture is that there
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:47.440]  is going to be massive chaos as the petro dollar disappears we have forces
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:50.760]  within the United States working to make that happen and of course we have
[02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:55.400]  Vladimir Putin working very earnestly like I said like a honey badger to take
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:29:00.680]  away the petro dollar and he is building alliances to make that happen thank

[02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:27.280]  your calls but before I do I just wanted to point out just the amazing news that
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:31.480]  we see in this article if you didn't catch the first hour we talked to Paul
[02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:35.320]  Joseph Watson about his article it's up on info wars calm police are using
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:41.720]  social media post to determine your threat score your threat score so they're
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:46.360]  notified when they pull you over if you're a bigger threat to them than the
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:50.920]  general public which are already trained to be a threat to them and of course this
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:56.000]  is based on things like your social media post your purchasing habits who knows
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:02.000]  what it's based on and we also talked about a story of some and I forget what
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.500]  location that was but it was a couple of former police officers who were
[02:35:06.500 --> 02:35:11.040]  indicted because they tried to set up some city councilmen who weren't funding
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:15.680]  the police department the way the police department wanted to be funded they
[02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:18.600]  were hired by a legal firm that represented a hundred and it was in
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:24.440]  California 120 different police unions in California they hired these two guys
[02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:28.280]  to get dirt on these councilmen and what they did was they followed them from a
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:33.040]  bar to home and then called up as snitches and said hey these guys drove
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:37.680]  home drunk however they didn't have anything to drink at the bar they had
[02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:43.760]  non-alcoholic drinks and they were not drunk and this whole thing is turning
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:49.120]  into an indictment for those officers also we've just learned that there is
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:56.080]  now a new surgeon general that's been confirmed by the Senate Democrats all
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:59.960]  the Democrats essentially voted for him there was only one Republican who voted
[02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:05.920]  for his confirmation the man is Vivek Murthy is confirmed by 51 43 vote
[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:11.640]  yesterday the LA Times reminds us that he believes that guns are quote a
[02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:17.280]  health care issue back in October 2012 Murthy tweeted that he was quote tired
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:23.040]  of politicians playing politics with guns and putting lives at risk because
[02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:31.360]  they're scared of the NA NRA no no it's because politicians understand that we
[02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:38.040]  have God given rights that are specifically protected in the Constitution
[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:43.200]  and those are not negotiable we have some people who showed up in Washington
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:48.320]  state now of course this is where we had the video yesterday of the sheriff's
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:52.240]  deputy talking about how they needed the m-wraps for constitutionalists and
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:56.880]  there's been a pushback against that by the sheriff essentially attacking
[02:36:56.880 --> 02:37:01.800]  info wars as being just a conspiracy site well you can look at that video
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:05.240]  yourself and you can see whether those contact those comments are out of
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:08.760]  context they're not but meanwhile in Washington state there's something else
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:14.480]  going on and Olympia Washington Gavin Simes quote we will not comply and
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:19.200]  quote pro-gun rally happened with between a thousand and three thousand
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:24.840]  people who showed up now they're protesting a new law that just passed
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:29.840]  in the last election that's initiative 594 which among other things now
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:34.920]  requires gun owners to obtain a background check before transferring a
[02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:40.080]  handgun to another party person to person at the moment the law became
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:44.400]  effective at midnight December 4th a YouTube aggregator called laughing at
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:49.560]  liberals I like that LAL laughing at liberals posted a video showing just
[02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:54.800]  such a transfer taking place without the requisite background check now of course
[02:37:54.800 --> 02:37:57.160]  that's not being covered by the mainstream media but that's something
[02:37:57.160 --> 02:37:59.840]  else that's going on in Washington I guess that's some of those people that
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:04.760]  the sheriff is so concerned about people who might transfer a weapon from one
[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:10.640]  person to the other and of course should we have licensing checks and
[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:16.160]  background checks for people to exercise their first amendment well that's
[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:20.000]  something that's been proposed by the Obama administration but that hasn't
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:25.720]  they've they've hinted at that and of course we've seen persecution of the
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:30.280]  first amendment like we've never seen it before one more thing on the gun issue
[02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:35.160]  as we look at Sandy Hook we've we've noted a lot of anomalies Wolfgang how
[02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:40.640]  big has noted a lot of anomalies about the Sandy Hook shooting to say the
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:44.640]  least one of the things that was very unusual about it was that none of the
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:50.920]  families had sued and every other case that Wolfgang had analyzed the families
[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:57.240]  would always sue for negligence sue the school system worse or sue the police
[02:38:57.240 --> 02:39:02.680]  department none of that happened until now but they're not suing the government
[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:08.800]  they're suing the gunmaker the bushmaster company the company made the
[02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:14.640]  bushmaster is being sued by all of the families they're not going to sue
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:20.120]  anybody for negligence they're just going to sue the gunmaker so I guess we
[02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:25.740]  should start suing the car companies when somebody has a has an accident but
[02:39:25.740 --> 02:39:28.600]  of course there's a lot more to Sandy Hook than that let's go back to your
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:34.160]  calls Caleb in Washington you called about the sheriff in Washington go ahead
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:39.440]  oh yeah I was calling I'm actually reside in Spokane Valley and the sheriff
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:44.200]  is named Ozzie Knezovich and I just like to point out that when you think of
[02:39:44.200 --> 02:39:47.480]  Washington state you think of a liberal state but over on the east side of
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:52.520]  Washington state it's actually very conservative a lot of farmers here is that
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:59.600]  where he is where the sheriff is yes he's in Spokane Valley it's right on the
[02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:05.760]  border with Idaho there and to be fair he has kept a high standard for his
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:10.160]  officers he's actually been in quite a lot of trouble with the police union
[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:17.040]  because he's gone on record firing deputies for poor behavior but I found
[02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:21.880]  it interesting that in the local news here he went on record saying that the
[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:25.360]  officer misspoke it should not have used the word constitutionalist and
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:31.000]  perhaps extremists were with a better word for the people that officer was
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:35.760]  talking about well you saw the video do you think it was taken out of context
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:43.440]  I do not and I'd like to point out that constitutionalism is an award that we
[02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:47.160]  exactly it's thrown it's not thrown around very often yeah where did he get
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:51.760]  that vernacular where did he get that we know precisely where he got that we
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:55.240] 've seen the reports we've seen the training documents we've heard the
[02:40:55.240 --> 02:40:59.680]  rhetoric from police departments across the country we know where this is
[02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:03.640]  coming from it's coming from Homeland Security it's coming from the FBI it's
[02:41:03.640 --> 02:41:07.240]  coming from the federal government they're training your local police
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:13.600]  department to be militarized to see you as a threat and to see you as someone
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:15.600]  that needs to be put down and of course anybody that talks about the
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:19.880]  Constitution that's somebody that needs to be they need to be concerned about
[02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:23.600]  those are political enemies they perceive of their agenda it says more
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:29.640]  about their agenda than it does about us I believe absolutely I'd just like to
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:33.480]  also say there's gonna be a rally on Saturday at the Spokane Valley police
[02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:39.440]  office okay anybody that's that about the issue show up yes and and they can
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:43.400]  see the sheriff's reaction as well as our comments to it on that article on
[02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:47.280]  infowars.com and I believe that article also mentions that rally that's coming
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:51.160]  up on Saturday thank you so much Caleb in Washington go to that rally tell your
[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:54.800]  sheriff what you think and you know unlike a chief of police a sheriff
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:59.040]  actually has to stand for election that's an important thing so keep that
[02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:06.440]  in mind let's go to Max in Ohio Max. Hey David. Hey how you doing? I was gonna
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:10.760]  comment I was gonna tell you about the Sandy Hook thing I heard that on Dr.
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:15.720]  Savage's show yesterday on the news report maybe Bushmaster needs to hire
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:20.400]  Wolfgang Howard to be their investigator for him. Well maybe if he gets a lot of
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:24.160]  big money behind him he can actually get somebody to respond to some of his
[02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:29.560]  FOIA requests other than sending highway patrolmen to his house to try to
[02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:35.200]  intimidate him but yeah it's very it's very strange and I don't know if you
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:41.880]  saw the debate that we had on infowars I think it was on last Friday but yeah
[02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:45.640]  it's interesting I think there's a lot of questions a lot of unanswered
[02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:51.280]  questions and of course many things that we see happening as part of a false
[02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:55.720]  flag there's there's things that we see being done over and over again buildings
[02:42:55.720 --> 02:43:01.120]  being taken down the the debris being taken away before anybody gets a chance
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:06.760]  to take a look at it we saw that at at 9-11 we also saw that with the false
[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:11.360]  flags that Vladimir Putin used to get into power they use the same types of
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:15.760]  things over and over again and immediately when there's a terrorist attack
[02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:19.520]  and they have solved it they know which group it is and they're going to come
[02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:24.600]  after that group as we saw with the Vladimir Putin false flags they
[02:43:24.600 --> 02:43:29.520]  immediately pended on the Chichens and used it to start a short war where he
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:34.240]  could declare victory yeah when we see that kind of thing every government
[02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:38.160]  seems to use that certainly the most corrupt and criminal ones and that's
[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:41.680]  something that we see happening with our government did you have any other
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:47.040]  comment about that well for one I think the Sandy Hook thing that's pretty
[02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:51.920]  gutsy man especially with with everything the Wolfgang Halberst pointed
[02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:56.880]  out I mean you figured that would open up even more then I don't know how much
[02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:01.040]  bushmasters work or how much they're seeking damages but you know sometimes
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:05.040]  they just settle just to put it under the rug and it's time for people start
[02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:10.240]  standing up and fighting and stuff and exposing it even more well you know it's
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:13.760]  interesting because when they sue the company they don't have to go into the
[02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:18.080]  details of the shooting that much as if they as they would if they were suing
[02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:22.760]  for negligence the school system or the police department then they would have
[02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:26.200]  to talk specifically about what was there and that would uncover some of that
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:31.160]  but with this this allows them to do an end around and just essentially come
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:35.680]  after the company that was named as having the gun that was used it allows
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:41.080]  them to go after them without really looking at the details of Sandy Hook so
[02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:45.200]  it is kind of an ingenious strategy we see that happening over and over again
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:51.840]  thank you so much let's go on to Dean and Florida Dean yeah sorry thanks for
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:56.160]  taking my call sure go ahead you want to talk about the police data says yeah
[02:44:56.160 --> 02:45:01.920]  well I wanted to talk specifically a few months ago I was in a McDonald's and
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:11.000]  and it was a Florida highway patrolman that came in and anyway I ended up
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:19.920]  handing him a little slip of paper that had it said in the worst I've ever wanted
[02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:23.880]  to start no starting to lose you hang on say you you said you hand this to an
[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:30.880]  officer a piece of paper said info wars.com yes I wrote down
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:41.020]  info wars.com website and it was his website and I handed it to the police officer and he got
[02:45:41.020 --> 02:45:46.120]  that he was worried and kind of upset he gave the thing back to me and I'll tell
[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:51.600]  you I you know I tried to engage him in some conversation and you know he didn't
[02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:54.840]  want to talk about anything and I go I you know I said what are you afraid of and
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:46:00.960]  all this and he and you know and he ended up telling me well you don't have
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:06.160]  a need to know so something something is going to happen really soon and I mean
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:10.960]  that's I you know what this is verification on an individual level you
[02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:15.040]  know a citizen yeah it's a shame yeah they need to understand how they're
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:19.680]  being played and they need to understand that the their family their future is on
[02:46:19.680 --> 02:46:22.840]  the line as well but they're not separate and above the rest of this
[02:46:22.840 --> 02:46:25.320]  country that they're part of the country they need to understand how they're
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:29.480]  being played by the federal government they should get a clue when they see the
[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:34.480]  government putting out these threat scores on the public telling them that
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:41.000]  we are the enemy giving them targets of civilians and ordinary citizens I even
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:45.800]  I'm using the military terminology that that we are civilians and they're
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:50.840]  somehow officers who are above all of this and of course we don't have a need
[02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:57.280]  to know what our servants are doing our public servants right why don't we have
[02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:01.800]  a need to know we pay their salary they're supposedly working to provide
[02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:06.400]  security and safety for us that's what we're being told and yet we're not allowed
[02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:11.120]  to know we don't have a need to know anything that our government is doing and
[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:15.440]  that's true from the top level all the way down to the lowest local level
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:18.120]  that's the kind of arrogance we see coming from our government thank you so
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:24.800]  much Dean let's move on to Chad in Washington Chad go ahead yeah I just I
[02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:29.000]  wanted to bring up a topic that I don't really hear people talk about a lot
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:36.760]  that's geoengineering and I encourage people to Google Arctic methane
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:41.400]  emergency and I don't think it's something really being talked about but
[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:47.580]  it's amongst all the scientists in that that world but I also wanted to turn
[02:47:47.580 --> 02:47:51.880]  you guys on to a guy named Aimee Wiccanton if you don't already know who
[02:47:51.880 --> 02:47:58.880]  he is. He runs a website called geoengineeringwatch.org. Yeah it's
[02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:01.320]  something that we talk about from time to time and we covered it when they were
[02:48:01.320 --> 02:48:05.040]  just having their annual geoengineering convention it was somewhere in Europe I
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:08.560]  think it was in Germany and there were papers that were being put out and one
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:11.560]  of the fellows that one of the papers that I covered the guy was saying well
[02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:17.080]  these are things that we could possibly do but then of course his question was
[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:20.600]  because I always like to pretend not really doing it but it's something that
[02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:24.400]  they're considering to do in the future. We raised an interesting question he said
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:30.080]  who has the right to set the thermostat if we have these techniques and we can
[02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:34.600]  use them who gets a chance to determine what the global thermostat should be who
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:38.880]  gets punished who gets rewarded. I think that's a key question but of course
[02:48:38.880 --> 02:48:42.920]  that's not going to be answered. Thank you so much Chad in Washington. Let's go
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:48.320]  to Thomas in Tennessee. Thomas? Yes sir how are you doing today? Doing good. You said you wanted to
[02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:53.960]  talk about constitutional issues I think? Yes sir constitutional rights. First off I'd
[02:48:53.960 --> 02:48:57.960]  like to read article 6 paragraph 2 of the Constitution. It says the
[02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:01.320]  Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:06.000]  pursuant to their own and all treaties made or which shall be made under the
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:10.920]  authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land the judges
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:17.560]  in every state shall be bound thereby. Anything in contrary or laws of any
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:22.120]  state to the contrary should be not withstanding and what notwithstanding is
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:27.800]  that's a legal definition in law and it means void of law no and every
[02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:34.880]  traffic citation is notwithstanding and that's what they're scared of. Yeah do
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:40.120]  you have in in Tennessee do you have jury trials available for you as a with a
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:43.960]  traffic violation? According to the Constitution of the United States of
[02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:50.120]  America anything with a fine of $20 or greater jury trial shall be granted so
[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:54.040]  yes that's right anywhere in America I had that and I think it's very important
[02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:58.600]  for us to utilize that if nothing else even if you don't win go to court and
[02:49:58.600 --> 02:50:04.320]  make an argument to the jury about jury nullification make their lives as
[02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:09.160]  difficult as possible that's what I do when I go through the airport security
[02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:14.280]  it's like I'm going to make them do the full pat down on me I'm not going to
[02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:20.000]  make their life any easier if they're going to hassle me then bring it on
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:23.640]  I'll hassle them back and I think you ought to inform your citizens because
[02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:26.840]  it's something that's much bigger even than traffic violations it applies to
[02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:30.960]  everything people need to understand that juries are there to protect our
[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:35.280]  rights it's one of our best foundations one of our best protections it only
[02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:40.980]  takes one juror to strike down a law or a law that is being misapplied or has
[02:50:40.980 --> 02:50:44.160]  draconian punishments in it that's something we need to stand up for each
[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:49.280]  other you don't have to elect somebody you just have to go be a juror and stand
[02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:53.360]  up for your legal rights in a jury trial here in Texas if you get a speeding
[02:50:53.360 --> 02:50:56.720]  ticket or any kind of a traffic violation you can check a box and say I
[02:50:56.720 --> 02:50:59.840]  want a jury trial we'll be right back taking your calls stay with us this hour

[02:53:03.720 --> 02:53:08.080]  of patriots over at my Patriots supply several years ago Matt was sitting in
[02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:11.440]  his two bedroom apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[02:53:11.440 --> 02:53:15.320]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take
[02:53:15.320 --> 02:53:20.480]  action a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born my Patriots supply has
[02:53:20.480 --> 02:53:24.120]  never taken a loan or accepted outside funding they now operate two
[02:53:24.120 --> 02:53:28.760]  distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women

[02:54:13.160 --> 02:54:16.160]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight in this final segment we're
[02:54:16.160 --> 02:54:19.280]  gonna be taking your calls before we go back to the calls I want to point an
[02:54:19.280 --> 02:54:24.400]  article point out an article that's up on info wars dot com the Department of
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:28.360]  Defense DARPA says that they are developing a magic bullet that can
[02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:34.120]  change direction after being fired when I saw this I thought Arlen specter must
[02:54:34.120 --> 02:54:37.440]  be giving a thumbs up from the grave you know he's the guy who advanced the
[02:54:37.440 --> 02:54:44.360]  magic bullet theory that the single shooter had a bullet that took out JFK
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:49.680]  and changed direction several times so maybe that was something that the DOD
[02:54:49.680 --> 02:54:53.960]  developed decades ago or maybe it's something that they'll have in our
[02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:59.280]  future let's go back to your calls David in New York go ahead David mr. Knight
[02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:03.960]  how you doing today I'm fine mr. Knight I've got a story that I'd like to tell
[02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:08.840]  your listeners and if it's okay with you I've got a website where people can
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:13.880]  support the gentleman who is the subject of this prosecution sure go ahead for
[02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:21.640]  using using a gun in self-defense fell up here in New York was helping an
[02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:28.320]  itinerant guy next door gave him food and at one point this fella confessed that
[02:55:28.320 --> 02:55:34.560]  he was actually using a false name and he was fugitive on a rape charge that he
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:40.120]  was hiding in the woods so my guy arranged to get the message to the police
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:44.640]  and the police actually drafted him to try to deliver this guy to them I
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:48.360]  remember you called and we got to your call at the very tail end of the show
[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:54.600]  several days ago before we run out of time give us the the website people can
[02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:57.880]  look at that and they can contribute they can see what the the case was because
[02:55:57.880 --> 02:56:00.960]  they probably won't have enough time for even if we just take your call to get
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:04.200]  to the end of it but give us a website where they can learn about that and
[02:56:04.200 --> 02:56:09.440]  and contribute to help this guy it's David Carlson fund dot com David
[02:56:09.440 --> 02:56:19.480]  Carlson fund dot com spell Carl carl c a r l s o n okay all right good and yes
[02:56:19.480 --> 02:56:24.120]  yes go ahead police when the police didn't get this guy arrested after
[02:56:24.120 --> 02:56:29.480]  several attempts they even launched a manhunt which was unsuccessful my guy
[02:56:29.480 --> 02:56:32.760]  put him in a car delivered him to the police and they still let him go because
[02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:38.480]  they didn't cuff him now when they the guy finally confronted my fella after he
[02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:43.640]  had eluded the manhunt he made a citizen's arrest walked this guy a quarter
[02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:47.760]  mile to a neighbor's house and the neighbors saw what happened he said
[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:52.880]  this fella was close enough to grab the shotgun when my guy fired and killed him
[02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:59.120]  hmm a very different result than we would see with the police who we've
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:03.200]  seen many times that they're not indicted even if they shoot people at a
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:07.560]  distance merely saying that they were concerned that the homeless man when
[02:57:07.560 --> 02:57:11.400]  there's eight police officers who fire 49 times they were concerned that the
[02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:15.480]  homeless man at quite a distance from them might have had a knife okay so
[02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:20.200]  people can go to that website and take a look at that let's let's go on to David
[02:57:20.200 --> 02:57:22.720]  and Idaho I want to get through the callers as quick as I can thanks David
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:26.360]  let's go to David and Idaho you said you want to talk about police and martial
[02:57:26.360 --> 02:57:34.240]  law go ahead okay sorry let's go to Wayne and Texas Wayne yes sir David really
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:38.000]  do appreciate you are a great host thank you just real quick I think it's
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:41.400]  really important that people pay attention to the whole Sandy Hook suing
[02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:47.160]  Bushmasters because they're going to have to present evidence and I think that
[02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:52.240]  that is a very important thing that we should keep our eyes on as a public and
[02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:56.880]  as news media well I hope that does happen as I said before I kind of think
[02:57:56.880 --> 02:58:01.480]  that they're going for the for the gun manufacturer because that will allow
[02:58:01.480 --> 02:58:05.280]  them to avoid a lot of specifics just by saying that they have culpability
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:10.360]  simply because they had the gun and of course if they don't want to go in and
[02:58:10.360 --> 02:58:13.680]  explore that that would be something they could do hopefully Bushmaster will
[02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:18.320]  go on the offensive and say show us the records prove that that was our gun even
[02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:21.480]  that was used there because that's even a question well that's all the time we've
