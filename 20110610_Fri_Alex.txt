[00:00:04.878 --> 00:00:09.703]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.703 --> 00:00:11.285]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.285 --> 00:00:12.827]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.827 --> 00:00:17.031]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:21.096]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:41.464]  We have an absolutely, completely jam-packed Friday edition for you.
[00:00:41.464 --> 00:00:46.948]  It is the 10th day of June, 2011 on this Friday edition.
[00:00:46.948 --> 00:00:52.053]  Mark Anderson of American Free Press at Bilderberg 2011 in St.
[00:00:52.053 --> 00:00:55.796]  Moritz, Switzerland, where the big protest is coming down high noon tomorrow.
[00:00:55.796 --> 00:00:57.858]  We'll be joining us coming up in the next segment.
[00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:00.940]  Then Jim Tucker's popping in, Charlie Skelton also at Bilderberg.
[00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:18.714]  London Guardian reporter Bob Chapman will join us for 30 minutes and then Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson will be hosting the show from Bilderberg in the third hour because I've got to go jump on an airplane to go to New York for the keynote address at Talkers and I'll be recapping all these guests coming up a little bit later in the hour.
[00:01:18.714 --> 00:01:20.615]  It is total complete meltdown.
[00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:23.277]  Of news and information.
[00:01:23.277 --> 00:01:34.506]  So much is happening as new wars start, as new bombardments start, as new drone attacks start in new countries in the Middle East.
[00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:36.548]  It is wild.
[00:01:36.548 --> 00:01:38.990]  We've got incredible escalations in NATO.
[00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:48.397]  We've got Secretary of Defense Gates coming out and questioning the future of NATO, saying they're pathetic.
[00:01:48.397 --> 00:01:49.799]  And he said, to be really blunt,
[00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:54.019]  Is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S.
[00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:56.480]  Congress and the American body politic.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.601]  They admit that they are losing in Libya.
[00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:01.622]  It is just unbelievable.
[00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:06.064]  Unbelievable splits happening inside the global power structure.
[00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:08.965]  And Gates did criticize the attack on Libya from the beginning.
[00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.070]  I think?
[00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.615]  Presidential campaign have quit and gone to Rick Perry, but Perry pledged months ago to never run for president, because he cares about Texas.
[00:02:39.615 --> 00:02:42.256]  It's Texas!
[00:02:42.256 --> 00:02:59.406]  I want you to force you to take Gardasil shots, and no, I'm not going to put the Gropenbill, anti-Gropenbill back on the agenda, and I'm from Napa Superhighway, and I hang out at Bilderberg, but I'm from Texas, and I wear a cowboy hat, and mind you, you can trust me.
[00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:01.626]  So that's going on.
[00:03:01.626 --> 00:03:07.288]  GOP consultants expecting Newt Scuys to jump to Perry and that's now happened.
[00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:11.429]  And Romney to skip Iowa GOP Florida straw poll.
[00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:15.750]  We're going to be breaking that down more on the E. coli deaths reaching 30 over in
[00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:24.251]  Europe, we've got absolutely incredible financial news today.
[00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:27.293]  Here's the top story at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:27.293 --> 00:03:29.555]  It's also the top story at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:33.958]  China's rating house says U.S.
[00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.500]  already defaulting.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.385]  Now, for several years I've told you, they're already defaulting on countries that bought the treasury bills.
[00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:43.926]  They're devaluing them.
[00:03:43.926 --> 00:03:45.248]  They're hyperinflating them.
[00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:49.135]  We're going into the final phase of this.
[00:03:49.135 --> 00:03:56.939]  You could pay 70 billion quadrillion and it couldn't pay all this off.
[00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.460]  You could pay infinity.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.062]  The banksters will always inflate it more to get you into the debt black hole.
[00:04:03.062 --> 00:04:04.923]  It's designed to do what it's done.
[00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:08.338]  It's economic parasitic behavior.
[00:04:08.338 --> 00:04:19.127]  That's why they're on top of the game, because they're predators and we are gullible and naive and will not learn these basic facts, so we're basically politically blind to what's happening.
[00:04:19.127 --> 00:04:23.971]  It's time to open your eyes, ladies and gentlemen, because you're not blind.
[00:04:23.971 --> 00:04:26.172]  These are basic historical facts.
[00:04:26.172 --> 00:04:26.533]  The U.S.
[00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:30.135]  is nearing an even worse financial crisis, Jim Rogers says.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.041]  Oil nears 102 a barrel.
[00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:35.463]  It is a gigantic broadcast today.
[00:04:35.463 --> 00:04:36.844]  Also, shootout between U.S.
[00:04:36.844 --> 00:04:39.465]  law enforcement and drug cartel on Texas border.
[00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:41.687]  Texas Department of Public Safety and a U.S.
[00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:51.713]  congressman says, why won't the feds define the problem and admit that there's an actual war and complete bedlam going on and it's the feds job to protect the border?
[00:04:51.713 --> 00:04:54.975]  They do everything they're not supposed to do and nothing they're supposed to do.
[00:04:54.975 --> 00:04:55.696]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:55.696 --> 00:04:56.196]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.222 --> 00:05:05.627]  You've heard Alex Jones talk about eFoods Direct and their highly nutritious, long-term, storable food.
[00:05:05.627 --> 00:05:07.108]  Believe me, it tastes great.

[00:05:11.492 --> 00:05:14.174]  Let's say you order three of their one-week responder kits.

[00:05:15.736 --> 00:05:18.918]  That's a $75 savings and a one-month supply.
[00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:20.039]  Are you kidding me?
[00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:26.105]  For the cost of one greasy, fast-food, super-sized combo lunch, you can eat three hearty, delicious meals.
[00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:29.887]  And this offer is good for any of their quick fix supplies.
[00:05:29.887 --> 00:05:32.168]  This offer ends on June 22nd.

[00:06:00.885 --> 00:06:02.586]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.586 --> 00:06:07.909]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.430]  Saving means to make money.
[00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:18.215]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:06:18.955 --> 00:06:26.497]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:06:26.497 --> 00:06:34.479]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.721]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:06:39.721 --> 00:06:41.881]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:06:44.662 --> 00:06:47.864]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.

[00:06:50.065 --> 00:06:51.726]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:15.805]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:07:15.805 --> 00:07:19.486]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:20.495 --> 00:07:33.267]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:40.534]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:07:41.215 --> 00:07:51.577]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:07:51.577 --> 00:07:55.498]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:07:55.498 --> 00:08:00.660]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:06.181]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:22.157]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:22.157 --> 00:08:25.659]  It is Friday, the 10th day of June, 2011.
[00:08:25.659 --> 00:08:40.905]  We're going to have reporters Mark Anderson, American Free Press, Jim Tucker, American Free Press, Charlie Skelton, the London Guardian, Bob Chapman with Financial News, and Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson of Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:41.565 --> 00:08:50.395]  As we track and cover and ferret out the internal agenda of the global elite meeting in secret in Switzerland.
[00:08:50.395 --> 00:08:57.322]  This has been the biggest year ever in the 35 years that the Bilderberg Group has been exposed.
[00:08:57.322 --> 00:09:00.085]  They've been meeting, of course, for decades before that.
[00:09:00.085 --> 00:09:02.327]  Their own corporate minutes have been ferreted out.
[00:09:02.327 --> 00:09:03.389]  Since then, they've even released
[00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:15.761]  Some of them to the BBC a decade ago admitting they want to set up world government, but US media until just a few years ago was still saying it did not exist and that you are insane if you talk about it.
[00:09:15.761 --> 00:09:19.104]  That's why I get countless emails of people talking about their family members.
[00:09:19.104 --> 00:09:23.688]  If they talk about it at dinner, visiting their parents or their children or their neighbors, they are laughed at.
[00:09:24.508 --> 00:09:32.013]  Because the average mind-numb person out there thinks they're on the winning team if they laugh at people that have more knowledge than them.
[00:09:32.013 --> 00:09:36.075]  We now have the full 2011 official attendee list.
[00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:37.056]  It is bombshell.
[00:09:37.056 --> 00:09:38.477]  We'll be breaking it down.
[00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:41.539]  It's up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:42.880]  Drudge is also linked to it.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.781]  DrudgeReport.com.
[00:09:44.781 --> 00:09:46.402]  Also, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:09:46.402 --> 00:09:47.663]  There's a video on the site.
[00:09:47.663 --> 00:09:50.745]  Breaks down the official Bilderberg 2011 attendee list.
[00:09:54.608 --> 00:09:57.330]  Uh, Bilderberg behind Rick Perry 2012 run.
[00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.773]  That report is up on the site.
[00:09:59.773 --> 00:10:10.103]  Also with the news that Newt Gingrich's staff is quitting and going to the Globalist Perry because Gingrich is falling out of favor with the
[00:10:11.044 --> 00:10:13.986]  ruling class because he's losing so much traction.
[00:10:13.986 --> 00:10:17.708]  We've got a lot of key economic and military news today coming up.
[00:10:17.708 --> 00:10:20.110]  China's rating house says U.S.
[00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.211]  is already defaulting, as I've told you for years.
[00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:25.493]  We're going to explain what that means to everyone.
[00:10:25.493 --> 00:10:28.595]  Hyperinflation and the death of the dollar.
[00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:32.337]  It's all coming up today, but I take you now to Paul Watson,
[00:10:32.917 --> 00:10:33.117]  I think?
[00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:50.670]  Thank you.
[00:11:10.327 --> 00:11:10.687]  Hi Alex.
[00:11:10.687 --> 00:11:16.133]  Yeah, we're at an event that's just up the hill from the Bilderberg Hotel.
[00:11:16.133 --> 00:11:27.504]  About an hour ago we actually went in the field that's just above the hotel, just outside the police line, and we were able to film live footage which was streamed on Justin TV.
[00:11:28.244 --> 00:11:28.465]  I don't
[00:11:43.181 --> 00:11:56.909]  And he was telling us about a big breaking story involving the Swiss politician Dominic Beitig, who before the conference had called for Henry Kissinger to be arrested as a war criminal.
[00:11:56.909 --> 00:12:03.774]  And I'm going to hand you over to Dominic so he can explain the letter that is now being presented to the Swiss.
[00:12:03.774 --> 00:12:05.915]  Okay, and tell us who Dominic is again.
[00:12:05.915 --> 00:12:08.837]  Tell us who Dominic is before you give him the phone.
[00:12:08.837 --> 00:12:11.078]  Dominic is from We Are Change Switzerland.
[00:12:11.929 --> 00:12:15.331]  Okay, Dominic, good to speak with you, sir.
[00:12:15.331 --> 00:12:18.073]  Give us this report.
[00:12:18.073 --> 00:12:34.763]  Okay, yesterday, we went to the Subarata Hotel, the Bilderberg Hotel, where they meet, and we brought a letter from the Swiss legislature, Dominic Petzig, who stated that different journalists were intimidated by the police.
[00:12:34.763 --> 00:12:39.226]  They were followed by cars with German numbers in Switzerland.
[00:12:41.914 --> 00:12:44.457]  Black, black windows and things like that.
[00:12:44.457 --> 00:12:51.367]  So, Patrick wrote an official letter that we handed out to the Chief of the Region, Barbara Yonam Steiner.
[00:12:52.119 --> 00:12:58.885]  To get sure that the journalists can do their work and that the coverage is done about the Bilderbergs.
[00:12:58.885 --> 00:13:06.252]  Because he knows what the agenda is from the Bilderbergers and he doesn't want them to meet in Switzerland.
[00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:08.074]  They should go away, he said.
[00:13:08.074 --> 00:13:17.763]  And tonight he will come to confront the event managers about the case that Henry Kissinger is coming to Switzerland.
[00:13:18.163 --> 00:13:19.544]  This is big news, sir.
[00:13:19.544 --> 00:13:30.011]  And again, you've already had a member of the equivalent of your Congress come out earlier in the week and call for the arrest of Kissinger.
[00:13:30.011 --> 00:13:30.892]  Is this the same?
[00:13:30.892 --> 00:13:33.113]  Now explain your government system.
[00:13:33.113 --> 00:13:38.957]  Explain your government system and exactly who he is and his name again and who's talked to him.
[00:13:38.957 --> 00:13:40.318]  It sounds like you've talked to him.
[00:13:40.318 --> 00:13:41.379]  You have the official letter.
[00:13:41.379 --> 00:13:44.100]  He's already in the papers saying he wants Kissinger arrested.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.063]  You're saying he is coming today to confront the police.
[00:13:49.524 --> 00:13:50.565]  It's not the only one.
[00:13:50.565 --> 00:13:59.931]  There are two other legislators coming up there in the Hotel Rundelins where we stay at an event that they talk about the Bilderberg meetings and their agenda.
[00:13:59.931 --> 00:14:11.540]  And so we have in Switzerland a subsidiary system so the people, the local people, can do politics and then it's go up and up.
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:21.144]  To the to the to the federal system so it's not a centralized system where in the central laws are being being
[00:14:25.015 --> 00:14:25.295]  Yes, sir.
[00:14:25.295 --> 00:14:38.182]  For those that don't know, the United States, more than the Greeks and Romans, as we were told by modern historians, the United States, if you read the Founding Fathers, was actually founded off a Dutch model that was then exported to Switzerland.
[00:14:38.182 --> 00:14:46.287]  Switzerland already had a similar model, where you actually have your states, of course, under another name, you have your, what, cantons, correct?
[00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:54.231]  Yes, you have your states for those that don't know, and they are the supreme power.
[00:14:54.231 --> 00:15:01.492]  They then vote and completely order the vassal federal body around as our republic was established.
[00:15:01.492 --> 00:15:06.654]  We now have it completely backwards here in the United States, and that's why we're in so much trouble.
[00:15:06.654 --> 00:15:11.355]  And so some of the leaders of the states, hence leaders of the federal government,
[00:15:11.955 --> 00:15:14.677]  Because the states run your federal government are coming.
[00:15:14.677 --> 00:15:16.139]  You're saying three of them.
[00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:20.282]  We do have the mainstream Swiss papers from two days ago where he was saying he wants them arrested.
[00:15:20.282 --> 00:15:23.244]  Your prime minister has said they shouldn't be meeting there as well.
[00:15:23.244 --> 00:15:24.565]  So what you're saying is confirmed there.
[00:15:24.565 --> 00:15:26.827]  But this is big breaking news.
[00:15:26.827 --> 00:15:34.854]  This is the first time I've ever heard of this, that the leaders of a government are going to be going and confronting the criminals that are meeting there.
[00:15:34.854 --> 00:15:36.335]  Any other details you can give us, sir?
[00:15:37.657 --> 00:15:54.734]  Yeah, the other thing is that the National Legislature said that if something's going to happen, if blood is on the street, the whole responsibility has to be taken by the Chief of the Region, who is also attending at the Bilderberg meeting.
[00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:02.437]  Yes, they normally have the local security chief just there inside as a minion, and they bring him some food and things, but he's not in on the meetings themselves.
[00:16:02.437 --> 00:16:06.261]  Again, give us the specific name of the ministers.
[00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:09.905]  Can you give us the name of the other two ministers, and can you read to us the letter?
[00:16:09.905 --> 00:16:11.127]  Sir, do you have that letter in front of you?
[00:16:12.284 --> 00:16:37.829]  No, I haven't the letter in front of me, but it states that stop all the scaring of the journalists and let them get their work out and do the big coverage of the Bilderberg meeting because in a country like Switzerland, if we have direct democracy, the people should be informed about this meeting and that we have an article, article 266 that
[00:16:40.869 --> 00:16:43.190]  Yeah, it's called treason.
[00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.190]  It's like the Logan Act, yeah.
[00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:54.112]  And so it's an illegal thing and he repeated this that he don't want to be a part of this system where the Bilderberg can get a platform in this country.
[00:17:11.356 --> 00:17:19.465]  Well amazing sir, now to be specific, you're with We Are Change, Luke Rodowski is there as well, Paul Watson is with you, but you've seen the letter?
[00:17:19.465 --> 00:17:21.707]  I mean, how do you know the letter?
[00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:22.428]  Have you seen the letter?
[00:17:23.399 --> 00:17:24.119]  Yes, yes.
[00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:26.100]  I wrote a letter to the legislator.
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.361]  In Switzerland, you can reach your legislators.
[00:17:28.361 --> 00:17:29.682]  Wrote them letters.
[00:17:29.682 --> 00:17:36.125]  And if you know them, if you're going outside to meet them, talk with them, they are trying to help you.
[00:17:36.125 --> 00:17:39.146]  There's a few politicians who have the balls to help you.
[00:17:39.146 --> 00:17:40.487]  Well, sir, you're amazing!
[00:17:40.987 --> 00:17:41.607]  You're amazing.
[00:17:41.607 --> 00:17:53.769]  Give us your full name, because you deserve great credit doing the right thing and going to your representatives, your servants, your legates, the people that serve you, your representative, and getting them to do the right thing.
[00:17:53.769 --> 00:18:06.552]  This is going to be very, very historical, and obviously we've got to have our team there covering it, and we'll have our team there covering it, and more on that live in the third hour, literally with their cell phones, as this happens at the gates of Bilderberg.
[00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:08.192]  But specifically, give us your full name, sir.
[00:18:09.568 --> 00:18:16.271]  I just want to mention that we are a lot of people here and this is the work of everybody here.
[00:18:16.271 --> 00:18:17.771]  No, I know, sir, but you wrote the letters.
[00:18:17.771 --> 00:18:21.152]  Give us your name for the record.
[00:18:21.152 --> 00:18:30.696]  My name is Dominic Schrieber and everyone has the same ability to write a letter to the national councillor to get this thing right.
[00:18:30.696 --> 00:18:35.257]  Okay, again, can you give us the other names of the other councillors that are coming?
[00:18:35.257 --> 00:18:36.558]  The councillors of Switzerland?
[00:18:38.168 --> 00:18:40.489]  Yes, you say three of them are coming.
[00:18:40.489 --> 00:18:41.910]  Three of them are coming.
[00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:51.115]  It's called Lukas Reimann is the one who is speaking about the Bilderbergers at the event in the Hotel Randolins and the other one is Pyramin Schwander.
[00:18:51.115 --> 00:18:59.559]  And the third, Dominic Batic, will go directly to the hotel to bring, to hand them out another letter about Kissinger.
[00:18:59.559 --> 00:19:04.202]  And I wonder if the police are going to try to keep their boss from delivering this letter.
[00:19:06.953 --> 00:19:17.477]  I think the Swiss police are very patriotic, some of them even are, and they didn't know what they are protecting.
[00:19:17.477 --> 00:19:22.419]  We have to inform them about the attendees and about the whole Bilderberg meeting that was
[00:19:26.658 --> 00:19:30.385]  ...was built up by a Nazi Prince Bernhard.
[00:19:30.385 --> 00:19:32.870]  And they're really shocked about this thing.
[00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.879]  And so maybe we have little helpers inside of the Toretto Hotel.
[00:19:39.116 --> 00:19:41.058]  Sir, you are absolutely incredible.
[00:19:41.058 --> 00:19:42.539]  The Swiss are incredible.
[00:19:42.539 --> 00:19:44.241]  They're the first country to do this.
[00:19:44.241 --> 00:19:46.963]  The first country for their... Stay there, all of you.
[00:19:46.963 --> 00:19:51.928]  This is bombshell, off-the-charts, breaking news.
[00:19:51.928 --> 00:19:57.593]  The leaders of Switzerland going to confront the criminals at Bilderberg 2011.
[00:19:57.593 --> 00:20:00.716]  I am getting chills right now.
[00:20:00.716 --> 00:20:03.499]  Will I have garlic breath after I take LEC?
[00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:17.251]  We get that question all the time about the world's best garlic extract, Alley C. And the answer is, Alley C contains stabilized allicin, nature's antimicrobial agent, and the active ingredient in crushed garlic, but will not give you garlic breath.
[00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:24.237]  Scientifically proven in double-blind studies, using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[00:20:24.517 --> 00:20:28.658]  Our powerful Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin.
[00:20:28.658 --> 00:20:32.760]  Just one tablet of Ali-C is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:39.642]  It's effective against asthma, MRSA, bacterial fungal, and viral infections, and helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[00:20:39.642 --> 00:20:41.723]  Plus, it's a natural mosquito repellent.
[00:20:41.723 --> 00:20:44.644]  Boosts resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract.
[00:20:44.984 --> 00:20:50.146]  Ali C. For more information and to order Ali C., call 877-888-7126 or go to GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[00:20:50.146 --> 00:20:52.247]  That's 877-888-7126 or GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[00:20:52.247 --> 00:20:53.047]  Fight back with Ali C.
[00:21:00.168 --> 00:21:04.714]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about a product the drug companies don't want you to know about.
[00:21:04.714 --> 00:21:06.456]  It's called Osteo-K.
[00:21:06.456 --> 00:21:13.926]  Osteo-K is an osteoporosis supplement shown to decrease fractures 87% without any of the dangerous side effects of medications.
[00:21:13.926 --> 00:21:14.948]  Calcium and vitamin D
[00:21:15.128 --> 00:21:17.470]  We only decrease fractures by 16%.
[00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.791]  Osteo-K decreases fractures an astounding 87%.
[00:21:19.791 --> 00:21:23.534]  Friends, osteoporosis is a deadly disease.
[00:21:23.534 --> 00:21:28.077]  Research shows the most effective approach for protecting your bones is not a drug at all.
[00:21:28.077 --> 00:21:31.339]  It's Osteo-K, manufactured entirely in America.
[00:21:31.339 --> 00:21:36.043]  Osteo-K is available without a prescription and comes with an unconditional money-back guarantee.
[00:21:36.043 --> 00:21:42.167]  Don't wait until it's too late, because if you have osteoporosis and fracture a hip, you have a 20% chance of dying within a year.
[00:21:42.507 --> 00:21:44.789]  I urge you to take charge of your health today.
[00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:47.011]  I cannot recommend this breakthrough product enough.
[00:21:47.011 --> 00:21:50.234]  Go to www.nbihealth.com or call 800-624-1416 right now.
[00:21:50.234 --> 00:21:50.674]  That's 800-624-1416.
[00:21:50.674 --> 00:21:51.555]  Start taking Osteo-K.
[00:21:59.554 --> 00:22:00.855]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:00.855 --> 00:22:06.438]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:22:06.438 --> 00:22:11.460]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:17.043]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:22:17.043 --> 00:22:18.864]  So our friends at Solutions from Science,
[00:22:19.124 --> 00:22:19.644]  We're good to go!
[00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.395]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:22:51.395 --> 00:22:56.224]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:22:56.224 --> 00:22:58.608]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:37.933]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:37.933 --> 00:23:38.714]  This capitalism?
[00:23:38.714 --> 00:23:44.998]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:44.998 --> 00:23:45.859]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:23:45.859 --> 00:23:49.121]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:23:49.121 --> 00:23:49.921]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:23:49.921 --> 00:23:51.322]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:23:51.322 --> 00:23:51.642]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:51.642 --> 00:23:51.923]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:03.271 --> 00:24:18.303]  Come, you masters of war Here to build the big guns Here to build the death planes Here to build all the bombs
[00:24:20.714 --> 00:24:25.296]  Yeah, they're hiding behind walls.
[00:24:25.296 --> 00:24:29.278]  They're hiding behind their desk.
[00:24:29.278 --> 00:24:31.519]  I can see through your mask.
[00:24:31.519 --> 00:24:32.840]  Except Bill to destroy.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.860]  Play with my world.
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.921]  Like it's your little toy.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:55.444]  You that ain't ever done nothing.
[00:24:55.444 --> 00:25:01.947]  And you run fast.
[00:25:01.947 --> 00:25:09.631]  Yep, they're the ones gearing up the wars.
[00:25:09.631 --> 00:25:16.394]  Launching the war right now in Libya, launching the new bombing campaigns in Yemen, the secret airstrikes.
[00:25:19.113 --> 00:25:26.099]  And there we are confronting him, drawing attention, and now a high-level Swiss politician, open letters signed by two others.
[00:25:26.099 --> 00:25:27.199]  My guys have seen the letters.
[00:25:27.199 --> 00:25:28.240]  They're going to get copies of it.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.144]  We're going to get it up on the continually updated news feed at InfoWars.com.
[00:25:33.144 --> 00:25:38.809]  Actually confronting the real illegitimate criminal government, the hijackers of our society.
[00:25:38.809 --> 00:25:45.354]  Paul Watson, I'm going to let you go soon here so you can get all this together, get it to Curt Nemo to get a report out because I know you're on the ground.
[00:25:45.914 --> 00:25:48.615]  And if that report isn't out in 30 minutes, you guys got to break up.
[00:25:48.615 --> 00:25:51.616]  One of them stay there and get back and write the report.
[00:25:51.616 --> 00:25:53.017]  This has got to happen now.
[00:25:53.017 --> 00:25:57.558]  This is huge breaking news with the big demonstration at high noon.
[00:25:57.558 --> 00:26:01.540]  I know there's a lot more people there today, but we're less than 24 hours.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:07.322]  We're like 18 hours or something now out from the big demonstration at high noon tomorrow there in St.
[00:26:07.322 --> 00:26:07.962]  Moritz.
[00:26:07.962 --> 00:26:09.462]  Watson, any other points to add?
[00:26:09.462 --> 00:26:13.864]  I mean, that was bombshell information that we just received right there.
[00:26:15.871 --> 00:26:21.992]  Yeah, we're going to have to stay up here and film it, and I guess Kurt is going to write the article.
[00:26:21.992 --> 00:26:23.393]  Is that what's happening?
[00:26:23.393 --> 00:26:31.135]  Yeah, and we've got to, with the Swiss, get a hold of that office and make sure exactly when he's arriving, we've got to get that on tape and march with him up there.
[00:26:31.135 --> 00:26:36.476]  Because if he doesn't have people backing him, who knows what they'll do to him.
[00:26:36.476 --> 00:26:42.677]  And again, this is the equivalent of Ron Paul marching, Swiss Ron Paul, literally marching up to Bilderberg.
[00:26:42.677 --> 00:26:44.998]  This is sensational.
[00:26:45.698 --> 00:26:51.020]  It is sensational the amount of attention this is going to draw to the real shadow enemies.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:27:02.044]  Once we identify these vampires in the light of high noon, today and tomorrow, this is another devastating blow as we show people that they're little men behind the curtain, they're not the great Oz, they're not invincible.
[00:27:02.044 --> 00:27:04.205]  Watson, anything else?
[00:27:04.205 --> 00:27:07.546]  Yeah, we've got Luke Bradowski to speak about the letter here.
[00:27:07.546 --> 00:27:08.927]  Luke, Luke, you've seen the letter.
[00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:09.787]  Do you have a copy?
[00:27:09.787 --> 00:27:14.229]  We've got to get a copy of this, photoed and twittered out right now to add to this.
[00:27:14.229 --> 00:27:15.129]  Luke, you've seen the letter?
[00:27:16.138 --> 00:27:17.419]  Yes, I've seen the letter.
[00:27:17.419 --> 00:27:23.303]  I actually walked up to the police officers here, right at the front entrance of the main hotel, and I gave it to them.
[00:27:23.303 --> 00:27:25.965]  As soon as I walked up to them, they already were pushing me out.
[00:27:25.965 --> 00:27:28.147]  They already were, like, telling me to get out of there.
[00:27:28.147 --> 00:27:29.588]  And I was like, wait a minute, buddy.
[00:27:29.588 --> 00:27:30.429]  Wait a minute, buddy.
[00:27:30.429 --> 00:27:32.090]  You're going to read this letter right now.
[00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.852]  Thank God it's in Swiss German so they can understand it.
[00:27:34.852 --> 00:27:38.034]  They may not understand me, but they sure did understand that letter.
[00:27:38.034 --> 00:27:42.638]  And they actually allowed us to stand with it, where we were actually kicked out and harassed many times.
[00:27:42.998 --> 00:27:44.339]  I mean, it's pretty intense here.
[00:27:44.339 --> 00:27:47.741]  I mean, we're followed by cop cars everywhere we go here.
[00:27:47.741 --> 00:27:53.444]  I got threatened with arrest and deportation yesterday just for filming this event here.
[00:27:53.444 --> 00:27:56.625]  So, what we're in Switzerland in is very brilliant.
[00:27:56.625 --> 00:27:59.507]  This representative, this chancellor that wrote this letter,
[00:27:59.847 --> 00:27:59.967]  Okay.
[00:28:14.684 --> 00:28:17.386]  Okay Luke, so you delivered the letter.
[00:28:17.386 --> 00:28:18.167]  This is unbelievable.
[00:28:18.167 --> 00:28:19.268]  We're going to get this out.
[00:28:19.268 --> 00:28:20.208]  Get us a copy of it.
[00:28:20.208 --> 00:28:21.449]  We're going to scan it in or photo it.
[00:28:21.449 --> 00:28:23.371]  We're going to get it out right now, no doubt.
[00:28:23.371 --> 00:28:25.052]  Drudge is going to link to this.
[00:28:25.052 --> 00:28:27.254]  I know we've shot some videos of you breaking this down.
[00:28:27.254 --> 00:28:32.719]  They're now up on our JustinTV channel and InfoWars.com in the Breaking Bilderberg News area.
[00:28:32.719 --> 00:28:37.663]  But shoot some more to break down the full developments here because we're getting this out live time.
[00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:40.344]  Yeah, Alex, this is also very important.
[00:28:40.344 --> 00:28:48.547]  This same chancellor has notified all the prosecutors in Switzerland that they have to arrest Henry Kissinger for war crimes.
[00:28:48.547 --> 00:28:51.968]  And now they're looking for pictures and documents that Henry Kissinger is here.
[00:28:51.968 --> 00:28:54.689]  This guy, this chancellor, is actually an amazing guy.
[00:28:54.689 --> 00:28:58.591]  He did the same thing when George Bush was supposed to speak here in Geneva, Switzerland.
[00:28:58.591 --> 00:28:59.751]  He wrote a similar letter.
[00:28:59.751 --> 00:29:02.392]  He notified the prosecutors like he is doing right now.
[00:29:02.392 --> 00:29:03.493]  And Bush cancelled!
[00:29:03.493 --> 00:29:04.193]  Bush cancelled!
[00:29:05.113 --> 00:29:05.193]  Well...
[00:29:28.516 --> 00:29:30.377]  Bilderberg under siege.
[00:29:30.377 --> 00:29:33.357]  The guys are going to be live on air coming up in an hour and a half.
[00:29:33.357 --> 00:29:36.458]  I want you to be with them, Luke, as well with reportage.
[00:29:36.458 --> 00:29:39.359]  Luke Rudowsky, the founder of We Are Change, RT Reporter.
[00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:40.019]  You are incredible.
[00:29:40.019 --> 00:29:40.559]  Stay there, Luke.
[00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:42.420]  I want to talk to you during this break.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.980]  I am so excited.
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.141]  I'm about to explode.
[00:29:45.141 --> 00:29:48.621]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is history that we're seeing.
[00:29:48.621 --> 00:29:50.742]  This is incredible.
[00:29:50.742 --> 00:29:52.122]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.122 --> 00:29:54.643]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.643 --> 00:29:57.324]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.285 --> 00:30:04.828]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.828 --> 00:30:05.749]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.749 --> 00:30:09.172]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.172 --> 00:30:10.032]  Number 2.
[00:30:10.032 --> 00:30:14.916]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.916 --> 00:30:15.676]  It's true.
[00:30:15.676 --> 00:30:20.540]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.361]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.361 --> 00:30:24.943]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.943 --> 00:30:28.646]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.846 --> 00:30:29.646]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.646 --> 00:30:32.407]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.407 --> 00:30:36.088]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.088 --> 00:30:36.868]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:41.029]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:46.071]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.071 --> 00:30:50.252]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:07.259 --> 00:31:12.402]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:31:12.402 --> 00:31:21.127]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:31:21.127 --> 00:31:23.468]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[00:31:29.608 --> 00:31:34.211]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:31:34.211 --> 00:31:38.053]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:31:38.053 --> 00:31:39.274]  Others don't.
[00:31:39.274 --> 00:31:41.415]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:41.415 --> 00:31:43.196]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[00:33:07.041 --> 00:33:09.143]  Big Brother.
[00:33:09.143 --> 00:33:11.925]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:11.925 --> 00:33:14.528]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:14.528 --> 00:33:15.428]  You want answers?
[00:33:16.434 --> 00:33:18.356]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:18.356 --> 00:33:28.003]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.003 --> 00:33:32.787]  I absolutely salute the Swiss right now.
[00:33:32.787 --> 00:33:34.909]  I drink this delicious hot coffee.
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:49.575]  To all the We Are Change patriots, to my great reporters that are in Switzerland, the Info Warriors, Paul Watson, Aaron Dykes, I salute Jim Tucker, Mark Anderson, I salute my team here, all the great crew, all the great riders.
[00:33:49.575 --> 00:33:53.179]  What is happening is historical, to say the least.
[00:33:53.179 --> 00:33:54.200]  If you just joined us,
[00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:57.702]  Three Swiss ministers have signed a letter.
[00:33:57.702 --> 00:34:00.403]  It has been delivered to the Bilderberg Group.
[00:34:00.403 --> 00:34:06.986]  The police have now backed off harassing media and one of their highest level members of their slash Congress.
[00:34:08.353 --> 00:34:09.893]  It's called their canton.
[00:34:09.893 --> 00:34:18.215]  It's the Council of the States is going to go to Bilderberg and demand to be let in and is going to confront and try to have Henry Kissinger arrested.
[00:34:18.215 --> 00:34:21.336]  This is off the charts delicious.
[00:34:21.336 --> 00:34:23.716]  I know we can beat the globalist.
[00:34:23.716 --> 00:34:28.897]  I know that who has the fight wins, who is in the right wins when they fight.
[00:34:28.897 --> 00:34:32.318]  Resistance is victory.
[00:34:32.318 --> 00:34:35.239]  My children's future, your children's future, free humanity.
[00:34:35.984 --> 00:34:37.167]  The spirit of 1776.
[00:34:37.167 --> 00:34:43.282]  Everything we are is about standing up and marching on Bilderberg today and tomorrow.
[00:34:44.281 --> 00:34:51.084]  This is off-the-chart exciting, and I take you now, I believe we've got him online, to Mark Anderson.
[00:34:51.084 --> 00:35:03.109]  He is one of the chief reporters, I believe he's even the editor, over there at American Free Press, and he writes on news across the nation, AmericanFreePress.net, the colleague of Jim Tucker.
[00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:06.931]  And, Mr. Anderson, it's good to have you there.
[00:35:06.931 --> 00:35:11.193]  Are you as energized and excited as I am about these bombshell developments?
[00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:16.942]  Absolutely, and you know, it's kind of a mixture of activists and Sherlock Holmes.
[00:35:16.942 --> 00:35:25.491]  You know, the Bilderbergers are an intrigue kind of group, and you have to be a kind of a sleuth and an activist at the same time, but I'm very excited.
[00:35:27.082 --> 00:35:42.070]  What do you make of the fact that this letter's been delivered, the cops have suddenly begun to really behave themselves, and are having the reporters get closer, because, you know, there it's direct democracy, and their boss has told them, you're protecting criminals.
[00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:53.516]  We're told the police are really starting to wake up, and now this member of the government, this member, uh, Cantonian leader, is going to be arriving soon to try to get into Bilderberg.
[00:35:53.516 --> 00:35:55.817]  This is Bilderberg under siege, Mark.
[00:35:57.672 --> 00:35:58.333]  Absolutely.
[00:35:58.333 --> 00:36:02.896]  I think we're talking about Dominique Beytig, the National Council member of the Swiss People's Party?
[00:36:02.896 --> 00:36:04.417]  Yes.
[00:36:04.417 --> 00:36:13.663]  Yeah, Dominique, as you probably know, had written letters to Simonetta Sammaruga, the federal civil law enforcement officer who's a member of the Federal Council.
[00:36:13.663 --> 00:36:20.328]  And then Mrs. Barbara Genome-Steiner, and she's the cantonal cop, top officer.
[00:36:20.328 --> 00:36:26.853]  And not only did they not initially respond to Beytig, but Genome-Steiner, she actually is attending Bilderberg.
[00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:38.095]  So initially there was a slap in the face to Dominic Beitig in his initial letters pleading to these top law enforcement officers not to even allow Bilderberg to meet here in the first place.
[00:36:38.095 --> 00:36:39.797]  So they snubbed.
[00:36:40.718 --> 00:36:56.451]  Uh, Dominic may take this, uh, traditionalist minded legislator, but, uh, what we're hearing now, which is what you're talking about, he's not taking this lying down and he's gonna ignore their, their cold shoulder and, and, and evidently be very proactive about this.
[00:36:56.451 --> 00:36:59.274]  So that, that takes a lot of courage.
[00:36:59.274 --> 00:37:01.195]  A great deal of courage on Dominic's part.
[00:37:01.195 --> 00:37:02.897]  Mark, I know you are, um,
[00:37:04.418 --> 00:37:12.623]  Really second only to somebody like Jim Tucker and your deep years of research and following Bilderberg and you've been to many of these events.
[00:37:12.623 --> 00:37:24.830]  Am I right in saying that nothing like this has ever happened and that this is a major watershed bellwether flashpoint event?
[00:37:26.323 --> 00:37:28.324]  I believe so, in many ways.
[00:37:28.324 --> 00:37:30.985]  Jim and I were discussing this earlier.
[00:37:30.985 --> 00:37:44.089]  First of all, he cannot remember, he goes back like 35 years, he cannot remember ever there being a national legislator of a host country to Bilderberg raising this kind of ruckus in this manner.
[00:37:44.089 --> 00:37:50.991]  Actually trying to prevent Bilderberg from meeting, and when he couldn't do that, then going to this next step and delivering this protest.
[00:37:51.551 --> 00:37:54.214]  Apparently in person in front of Bilderberg.
[00:37:54.214 --> 00:38:00.160]  So this is unprecedented and according to Jim who just told me this this morning and he's been covering this for 35 years.
[00:38:02.921 --> 00:38:05.442]  And then you have the other factors involved.
[00:38:05.442 --> 00:38:12.263]  This meeting is taking place in a country whose traditions run exactly against the grain of Bilderberg.
[00:38:12.263 --> 00:38:14.444]  They want centralized control.
[00:38:14.444 --> 00:38:18.964]  The Swiss believe in kind of a populist, home rule, grassroots style of government.
[00:38:18.964 --> 00:38:20.885]  It's just a no-fit all the way.
[00:38:20.885 --> 00:38:25.426]  They shouldn't be here philosophically, culturally, for any reason.
[00:38:25.426 --> 00:38:26.426]  They don't belong here.
[00:38:26.966 --> 00:38:35.951]  They don't belong anywhere, really, but they definitely don't belong here, and I think that's what Bejig sees, that this would tarnish the Swiss system, it would tarnish their reputation.
[00:38:35.951 --> 00:38:47.817]  And he probably suspects that some of their deliberations might be how to get Switzerland into the European Union, so it's not the Sticky Wicket in their mad quest for a unified Europe.
[00:38:48.283 --> 00:39:08.005]  And notice as soon as they have the second vote and finally force the success story Ireland into the EU as EU ministers have said it's a receivership arm they immediately by design through the ministers they controlled the traders inside Ireland economically imploded them and handed literally the lion's share of their taxes over to the IMF and World Bank
[00:39:08.325 --> 00:39:10.426]  And that's what they want to do to Switzerland.
[00:39:10.426 --> 00:39:12.607]  And so, you know, the hour is getting late.
[00:39:12.607 --> 00:39:14.388]  The global crisis is on.
[00:39:14.388 --> 00:39:19.270]  The crimes of Bilderberg are known, and people are identifying them as the enemy.
[00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:30.555]  And justice be done, may the heavens fall, as people like yourself and the protesters continually to doggedly expose Bilderberg, being laughed at, being told it doesn't exist, ha ha ha.
[00:39:30.555 --> 00:39:33.197]  Now we see it all coming to a head as the global
[00:39:33.817 --> 00:39:40.683]  Yeah, you've got their oxygenarian mainstays like Kissinger and Rockefeller who aren't long before they go to that great bank vault in the sky.
[00:39:59.939 --> 00:40:10.985]  Or maybe it's the other direction, but yeah, I think that people like that with these egos the size of Maltiger here in Switzerland, they want to see concrete results.
[00:40:10.985 --> 00:40:19.490]  They want to see their world order before they go to that great beyond, you know, or whatever they think their futures are.
[00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:20.491]  I don't think they have any.
[00:40:21.011 --> 00:40:22.894]  But I think they're getting impatient.
[00:40:22.894 --> 00:40:25.738]  You know, things are moving more slowly than they anticipated.
[00:40:25.738 --> 00:40:29.163]  A lot of people are waking up, hopefully enough people.
[00:40:29.163 --> 00:40:34.590]  And, you know, they want to see this consummated before their elder members pass on.
[00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:36.253]  So they've got to be getting very impatient.
[00:40:37.708 --> 00:40:44.132]  Well, and they're forcing their global tyranny through in their carbon taxes, but it only mounts more resistance.
[00:40:44.132 --> 00:40:50.416]  And it takes me back to the Star Wars line that, you know, the tighter you squeeze, the more systems will slip through your fingers.
[00:40:50.416 --> 00:40:53.558]  I mean, that is what is beginning to happen.
[00:40:53.558 --> 00:40:54.839]  And we've always got moles.
[00:40:55.379 --> 00:40:55.479]  He's
[00:41:12.286 --> 00:41:14.328]  Hillary Clinton and others in the eyes.
[00:41:14.328 --> 00:41:19.151]  People are in the presence of this evil and their human instinct for survival.
[00:41:19.151 --> 00:41:22.334]  They instantly come to our side and give us all the data.
[00:41:22.334 --> 00:41:25.616]  And the globalists should know it's only going to intensify.
[00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:36.444]  Agents of liberty, eternal agents of freedom, agents that literally carry the spark of God's love in their hearts for their children and our cultures are everywhere.
[00:41:37.505 --> 00:41:37.865]  I think?
[00:41:56.958 --> 00:42:06.730]  They want to intimidate us and make us feel weak because they can literally, at a spiritual, instinctive level, we are like thousand-foot giants to them because we're in the right.
[00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.592]  And the wicked flee when none pursue.
[00:42:08.592 --> 00:42:10.794]  And, well, we are pursuing.
[00:42:10.794 --> 00:42:12.837]  And that's why they flee and hide Mark Anderson.
[00:42:14.335 --> 00:42:19.439]  Yeah, I think that for all their great wealth, they're the poorest people on the planet.
[00:42:19.439 --> 00:42:27.265]  They're culturally and in their soul, in their intellect, in their spirit, they're poorer than dirt.
[00:42:27.265 --> 00:42:28.526]  And I think they know that.
[00:42:28.526 --> 00:42:33.630]  All they have is money and power, which are ephemeral things, things that slip away.
[00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:39.795]  I think they sense their own mortality, individually and collectively, that there's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide.
[00:42:39.795 --> 00:42:42.037]  They're not going to get away with it because we're not going to let them.
[00:42:42.037 --> 00:42:43.238]  It's just that simple.
[00:42:43.898 --> 00:42:52.141]  And, you know, even if they were meeting for the best of reasons, and everything was peaches and cream, you're still not supposed to have secret decisions being made.
[00:42:52.141 --> 00:42:53.801]  See, that's what people don't understand.
[00:42:53.801 --> 00:42:57.623]  Secrecy is never good, even if the best intentions are there.
[00:42:57.623 --> 00:43:01.564]  And we know they don't have the best intentions, so it's a double whammy.
[00:43:01.564 --> 00:43:04.425]  You know, it's just there's no way they can explain their way out of this.
[00:43:04.425 --> 00:43:06.306]  It's undemocratic, it's wrong.
[00:43:06.306 --> 00:43:10.047]  Even if they're voting to send money to the poor every week, they need to do it in the open.
[00:43:10.563 --> 00:43:14.549]  But, you know, openness to them is, you know, just anathema.
[00:43:14.549 --> 00:43:18.695]  They don't even understand what that's about, you know.
[00:43:18.695 --> 00:43:22.480]  It's just, it's almost sad.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.565]  I mean, they're really, I pity them as much as I loathe them.
[00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:29.190]  Well, you're right.
[00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:38.816]  Mark Anderson, looking at the agenda, for folks that just joined us, we're covering Bilderberg 2011, a day that will be remembered for a long time.
[00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:40.417]  Very exciting.
[00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:43.619]  The equivalent of a Ron Paul of Switzerland, that's what he's known as.
[00:43:44.199 --> 00:43:47.940]  No, you're heading up one of the cantons.
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.781]  And again, there are states then combined to make the federal government.
[00:43:50.781 --> 00:44:00.243]  It's direct state rule, people rule, what the Republic once had through the states until the globalists took over in 1913 and got rid of the 17th Amendment for the states to send in the U.S.
[00:44:00.243 --> 00:44:01.043]  senators.
[00:44:01.043 --> 00:44:04.884]  He's basically the equivalent of that for folks that don't understand the U.S.
[00:44:04.884 --> 00:44:09.045]  Republic before it was taken over and understand the Swiss system.
[00:44:09.045 --> 00:44:10.325]  But expanding on that, Mark,
[00:44:10.885 --> 00:44:22.167]  Recapping how big this is, we're going to put, when we can, the letter back on screen that's been delivered by Luke Radowsky and later today, in the next few hours, the leader of this canton is going to come there.
[00:44:22.167 --> 00:44:24.508]  He's already sent it out to the prosecutors, the police.
[00:44:24.508 --> 00:44:26.868]  He's told them, look, you're in violation of law.
[00:44:26.868 --> 00:44:27.508]  I'm coming.
[00:44:27.508 --> 00:44:28.428]  I'm your boss.
[00:44:28.428 --> 00:44:28.949]  Look out.
[00:44:28.949 --> 00:44:30.689]  This is a showdown.
[00:44:30.689 --> 00:44:31.989]  This is a showdown.
[00:44:31.989 --> 00:44:34.750]  This is big.
[00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:35.390]  It's major.
[00:44:36.795 --> 00:44:38.456]  You know, heartening to see.
[00:44:38.456 --> 00:44:40.937]  And this is the right country for it to happen in.
[00:44:40.937 --> 00:44:41.898]  They don't belong here.
[00:44:41.898 --> 00:44:45.140]  As I said, it's retrograde to what they believe.
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.421]  And, you know, they're in the wrong environment.
[00:44:47.421 --> 00:44:56.106]  And it provides the right opportunity to present them with the right rebuke, the right defense of the common man.
[00:44:56.106 --> 00:44:58.907]  And it's time for the common man to win a few.
[00:44:58.907 --> 00:45:00.748]  You know, they've had their day in the sun.
[00:45:00.748 --> 00:45:01.969]  It's time for them to pack it in.
[00:45:03.214 --> 00:45:06.496]  Any other key points you'd like to add about what you've observed, editor?
[00:45:06.496 --> 00:45:08.957]  I know you work as a visiting editor on a lot of things.
[00:45:08.957 --> 00:45:11.158]  In fact, what is your title in American Free Press?
[00:45:11.158 --> 00:45:13.980]  I know you're a radio talk show host, too, and I've interviewed you many times.
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.121]  Mark, what's your title over there?
[00:45:16.121 --> 00:45:16.981]  I'm editor.
[00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:19.082]  Jim Tucker's editor emeritus.
[00:45:19.082 --> 00:45:22.004]  He's semi-retired, but he still covers Bilderberg.
[00:45:22.004 --> 00:45:24.005]  And I'm editor, and we're a team now.
[00:45:24.005 --> 00:45:26.526]  I'm sort of inheriting the baton from him, more or less.
[00:45:28.279 --> 00:45:45.422]  Well, I think that what we're talking about today is the key development, and what I talked about earlier where the legislator who's rebuking and confronting Bilderberg tried to get the local and federal police from stopping Bilderberg from meeting here in the first place.
[00:45:45.422 --> 00:45:56.204]  But maybe it's almost better that didn't happen, because if that didn't happen, or if that would have happened had they not met here, then he wouldn't be evidently approaching them and confronting them with this letter.
[00:45:56.724 --> 00:46:00.045]  So maybe this is the way God intended it, you know?
[00:46:00.045 --> 00:46:10.908]  And certainly, I think that these specific issues that Bilderberg wants to discuss include whether to continue the wars in Afghanistan and Libya.
[00:46:10.908 --> 00:46:15.969]  It always includes energy matters, monetary matters, you know, will the
[00:46:17.273 --> 00:46:27.718]  I'm sure that meeting in Switzerland, they're going to think about Switzerland being this odd man out and not fitting into their global straitjacket.
[00:46:27.718 --> 00:46:37.523]  Everything is a lot less secret about Bilderberg than it used to be, but it's still hard to discern, of course, unless you're in there, exactly what they're talking about.
[00:46:37.523 --> 00:46:43.786]  They do have a quasi-official website where they list a quasi-official set of topics.
[00:46:44.437 --> 00:46:46.119]  But, you know, they're very misleading.
[00:46:46.119 --> 00:46:53.926]  There's one in there right now on their official website, something like, Switzerland, you know, will it be successful in the future?
[00:46:53.926 --> 00:46:59.330]  You know, you could read that a lot of different ways, you know, real innocuous-sounding topics.
[00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:06.217]  And so, it always sounds dry and academic, you know, if you read their own literature.
[00:47:06.217 --> 00:47:09.980]  But, of course, there's much more to it, and the secrecy is the enduring problem.
[00:47:13.274 --> 00:47:16.255]  That's essentially what we've got so far.
[00:47:16.255 --> 00:47:19.917]  And the rest is just a lot of legwork confirming who's there.
[00:47:19.917 --> 00:47:23.318]  Okay.
[00:47:23.318 --> 00:47:27.880]  Mark Anderson, we've got Jim Tucker on the line with us.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.041]  We're going to let you go.
[00:47:30.041 --> 00:47:35.183]  But stay close to my guys because I want to get you to pop in coming up later in the broadcast.
[00:47:35.183 --> 00:47:36.564]  But Mark, thank you so much.
[00:47:36.564 --> 00:47:38.765]  We'll continue to watch your work at AmericanFreePress.net.
[00:47:38.765 --> 00:47:39.185]  Thank you, sir.
[00:47:40.009 --> 00:47:40.570]  You're welcome.
[00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:41.551]  Pass the baton to Jim.
[00:47:41.551 --> 00:47:42.632]  We'll see Alex.
[00:47:42.632 --> 00:47:44.033]  Okay, thank you sir.
[00:47:44.033 --> 00:47:47.477]  Here is Jim Tucker, the original Bilderberg sleuth.
[00:47:47.477 --> 00:47:48.719]  Jim, good to have you here with us.
[00:47:48.719 --> 00:47:50.541]  It's always a pleasure.
[00:47:51.226 --> 00:48:14.996]  Jim, how big is this that this top Swiss leader has sent the letter demanding that Kissinger basically be arrested and that the police follow the Swiss Constitution and honor the press and that he is now in the next few hours preparing to make his way there to try to basically force his way into the Bilderberg Group meeting?
[00:48:14.996 --> 00:48:19.858]  Well, several people's thoughts, such as
[00:48:21.216 --> 00:48:23.297]  Uh, vehicle approach.
[00:48:23.297 --> 00:48:25.538]  On the other hand, there's several ways they've done it.
[00:48:25.538 --> 00:48:33.562]  They could have taken the ambulance from the airplane to a car park somewhere else and slide in that way.
[00:48:33.562 --> 00:48:35.843]  But Kissinger's definitely there.
[00:48:37.671 --> 00:48:39.071]  Yes.
[00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:42.393]  He's the heart of Bilderberg along with Rockefeller and Queen Beatrix.
[00:48:42.393 --> 00:48:53.596]  What do you make of the announcement that this leader of a canton, I mean as high level as it gets, other than the Prime Minister of Switzerland, is going to confront them, Jim?
[00:48:53.596 --> 00:48:56.497]  Have you heard this news?
[00:48:56.497 --> 00:48:57.217]  Yes, Eric.
[00:48:57.217 --> 00:49:02.959]  It's been reported that he plans a confrontation and it should be a lot of fun too.
[00:49:05.433 --> 00:49:19.157]  I guess they'll have to stay outside the gates until they come out because they'll have it sealed off inside and they could throw them in jail and be bucks be lined.
[00:49:19.157 --> 00:49:26.120]  In fact, they have jailed a couple of people already who tried to walk through against orders, took one guy's passport away.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.240]  They're pretty rough.
[00:49:28.368 --> 00:49:29.869]  Yes, I'd be analogous to that, certainly.
[00:49:48.578 --> 00:49:54.420]  Well this is huge, have you ever seen anything like this in your 35 years of covering the Bilderberg scum?
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:50:03.103]  Never, never has the Ohio State been so publicly challenged Bilderberg.
[00:50:03.103 --> 00:50:13.906]  I tell you this is, if they were running scared earlier in the week Jim, you know they've heard of this, do you think they're doing you know what in their underwear?
[00:50:15.353 --> 00:50:19.674]  Oh yes, I'm sure they had battle problems.
[00:50:19.674 --> 00:50:25.695]  The starting lady waved across the crowd cover keeping the helicopters away.
[00:50:25.695 --> 00:50:33.416]  Nowadays the helicopters get to St.
[00:50:33.416 --> 00:50:43.558]  Marie, so they had to do a lot of long-distance driving and some planes were able to land at the small airport later.
[00:50:45.563 --> 00:50:49.386]  So they were a whole day late getting started.
[00:50:49.386 --> 00:50:57.533]  And they all have to duck and run on Monday because their cover meetings.
[00:50:57.533 --> 00:51:00.275]  NATO is one cover meeting, as you know.
[00:51:00.275 --> 00:51:05.760]  And that way the Secretary of Defense can duck into Billabong and then go home.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.942]  But the reason he was over here was NATO.
[00:51:07.942 --> 00:51:10.804]  And no word mentioned about the Billabong meeting, of course.
[00:51:11.952 --> 00:51:15.433]  Jim, in closing, you've got much of their internal agenda now.
[00:51:15.433 --> 00:51:17.053]  Big news in the U.S.
[00:51:17.053 --> 00:51:20.874]  Time Magazine, Newsweek, CNBC, DrudgeReport.com.
[00:51:20.874 --> 00:51:26.755]  Congratulations on the great job that they've been picking up our reportage via you.
[00:51:26.755 --> 00:51:28.175]  What can you tell us?
[00:51:28.175 --> 00:51:30.756]  Any other intel from your moles?
[00:51:30.756 --> 00:51:38.798]  We were told by some of the Swiss folks that have moles that they're getting a lot of intel from the waitstaff and others that are disgusted by Bilderberg.
[00:51:41.172 --> 00:51:49.539]  Yes, and I'm having daily telephone conversations with my mole inside.
[00:51:49.539 --> 00:51:57.765]  I'm allowed to say that he is on the inside of both trilateral and billboard meetings.
[00:51:57.765 --> 00:51:59.167]  I recognize the voice.
[00:51:59.167 --> 00:52:00.027]  I don't know his name.
[00:52:00.027 --> 00:52:01.548]  I don't want to know his name.
[00:52:01.548 --> 00:52:02.970]  That's what we set it up years ago.
[00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:08.873]  If they put me on a torture rack, I cannot name him because I really do not know his name.
[00:52:08.873 --> 00:52:18.839]  I know his voice and his information has always been proven by history.
[00:52:18.839 --> 00:52:22.401]  I mean, history has confirmed everything he's ever told me.
[00:52:25.629 --> 00:52:33.851]  Why do you think this mole for many, I know more than a decade, and then you also get the waitstaff and others to later help you, that's why you stay a few days after.
[00:52:33.851 --> 00:52:37.432]  Why do you think you were originally approached?
[00:52:37.432 --> 00:52:41.733]  Well, I think this guy decided that Bilderberg ought to be exposed.
[00:52:41.733 --> 00:52:50.135]  Probably agrees also that they're evil people, although he's apparently on the staff of someone who attends those meetings.
[00:52:54.642 --> 00:52:59.566]  I don't know how old he is, how young he is, how fat, short or tall he is, and I don't want to know that either.
[00:52:59.566 --> 00:53:02.828]  It could be, but I don't want the...
[00:53:19.959 --> 00:53:21.599]  No, I understand.
[00:53:21.599 --> 00:53:25.220]  What did the mole, did the mole give you anything else that's on the agenda?
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:28.541]  Because there's always things that are off the agenda that are on the agenda.
[00:53:28.541 --> 00:53:31.342]  Did the mole tell you anybody that's off the list that's there?
[00:53:31.342 --> 00:53:39.484]  Oh, yes, there's several people who are not on the list.
[00:53:39.484 --> 00:53:43.965]  As in Secretary DeVos' case, also Bill Gates, the
[00:53:45.177 --> 00:53:47.840]  Hillary was in Europe until about a day ago.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.581]  She's now in Africa.
[00:53:49.581 --> 00:53:50.882]  Any intel on Hillary?
[00:53:50.882 --> 00:53:54.826]  They're moving to get her into the World Bank.
[00:53:54.826 --> 00:53:57.929]  Any word on her sinking in for a few hours?
[00:54:09.018 --> 00:54:11.519]  No, we have not learned that as possible.
[00:54:11.519 --> 00:54:12.580]  She has.
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:15.142]  She did once before.
[00:54:15.142 --> 00:54:18.624]  I think we discussed it yesterday when she attended the meeting.
[00:54:18.624 --> 00:54:19.705]  Yes, we did.
[00:54:19.705 --> 00:54:27.830]  In closing, Jim Tucker, any other intel that you can give us, my friend, on what is going on inside Bilderberg?
[00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:29.191]  Anything else your mole gave us?
[00:54:29.191 --> 00:54:30.112]  The world is listening.
[00:54:32.034 --> 00:54:33.256]  No more than I gave you yesterday.
[00:54:33.256 --> 00:54:41.348]  I'm sorry to say, although it's being amplified all day, the arguments over whether to keep the interest rates at the
[00:54:42.695 --> 00:54:54.739]  I mean the IMF, up or down, to raise them a little bit, to save off inflation, or to keep them down, they're arguing over that.
[00:54:54.739 --> 00:55:05.362]  They're unified on the war project, the rationalization that the world is too crowded anyway, we have to limit the population growth, and one way to do it is with our wars.
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:07.441]  Incredible!
[00:55:07.441 --> 00:55:08.301]  Jim Tucker, AmericanFreePress.net.
[00:55:08.301 --> 00:55:09.342]  We salute you.
[00:55:09.342 --> 00:55:13.364]  Thank you so much for spending time with us, my friend.
[00:55:13.364 --> 00:55:13.705]  My pleasure.
[00:55:13.705 --> 00:55:14.165]  Goodbye now.
[00:55:35.772 --> 00:55:38.294]  Unbelievable information.
[00:55:38.294 --> 00:55:42.377]  Unbelievable level of information that you just received.
[00:55:42.377 --> 00:55:48.481]  You can believe that everything Jim has ever said from this mole has been turned out to be totally accurate.
[00:55:48.481 --> 00:55:49.502]  Bragging.
[00:55:49.502 --> 00:55:53.545]  These are directly from their meetings about how war is good, plus kill these people anyways.
[00:55:53.545 --> 00:55:57.467]  That's their cold-blooded attitude about not caring about life.
[00:55:57.467 --> 00:55:59.209]  They think you deserve to die.
[00:55:59.209 --> 00:56:01.310]  Social Darwinism.
[00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:02.531]  Mad at protesters.
[00:56:04.592 --> 00:56:13.437]  IMF, World Bank, people arguing about raise or lower interest rates, unified on trying to have a larger regional war run by their minion Obama.
[00:56:13.437 --> 00:56:14.277]  This is so big.
[00:56:14.277 --> 00:56:27.124]  I'm going to play a two and a half minute clip of Luke Radowsky yesterday going up and trying to get in to Bilderberg and then running up and then German grabbing his passport and other things.
[00:56:27.124 --> 00:56:28.025]  We have that clip, right?
[00:56:29.423 --> 00:56:55.466]  Okay, and then we're gonna play that, go to break, I'll come back in the next hour, I gotta run back with Kurt, give him all this breaking news, and we've got the letter up on our Twitter feed, twitter.com, RealAlexJones, we've got that up there, of the letter that the Swiss leader has sent to them, he's gonna be arriving in the next few hours, we're getting a big report out on that, Bilderberg under siege, Swiss politician to confront Bilderbergers today, this is huge, we're gonna go ahead,
[00:56:56.147 --> 00:56:57.187]  We're going to go ahead and go to this tape.
[00:56:57.187 --> 00:56:57.767]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:57.767 --> 00:56:58.867]  Here's Luke Rodowski.
[00:56:58.867 --> 00:57:00.308]  This is Luke Rodowski here in St.
[00:57:00.308 --> 00:57:06.549]  Moritz, Switzerland, where the secretive and elusive Bilderberg Group meeting will be taking place directly behind me tomorrow.
[00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:18.811]  The U.S., British, and Israeli intelligence protect these elites, and they have teamed up with the Swiss police and military to cordon off this entire area to make sure nobody from the outside gets a glimpse of what's happening inside here.
[00:57:18.811 --> 00:57:23.972]  They actually even built a special wall to make sure no photographers document the treasonous individuals
[00:57:24.352 --> 00:57:30.014]  Who are not only afraid of their shadows, but don't want to be documented coming into this private meeting.
[00:57:30.014 --> 00:57:37.597]  To get a taste of the security here, I actually decided to try to have dinner at this hotel, and this is what happened.
[00:57:37.597 --> 00:57:37.957]  Hey guys.
[00:57:37.957 --> 00:57:39.858]  How you doing?
[00:57:39.858 --> 00:57:41.379]  Speak English?
[00:57:41.379 --> 00:57:43.900]  English?
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:45.100]  We want to have dinner.
[00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:45.861]  You can't come in?
[00:57:45.861 --> 00:57:50.102]  Look at these guys.
[00:57:50.102 --> 00:57:51.263]  Hey, don't put your hands on me.
[00:57:52.125 --> 00:57:58.427]  Don't put your hands on me, just because your pimp's told you to.
[00:57:58.427 --> 00:58:01.108]  What pieces of trash are you driving in, sir?
[00:58:01.108 --> 00:58:16.693]  The question has to be asked, if these banksters, corporate heads, media moguls, heads of state, kings and queens, aren't doing anything sinister, why are they protecting this place like Fort Knox, and why are the people here who are trying to find out what's going on being treated like criminals?
[00:58:17.353 --> 00:58:18.074]  He's my translator.
[00:58:18.074 --> 00:58:19.895]  I don't know what you guys are saying.
[00:58:19.895 --> 00:58:22.196]  I'm not going to... What does he want from me?
[00:58:22.196 --> 00:58:22.536]  Your ID card.
[00:58:22.536 --> 00:58:23.777]  Why does he want my ID card?
[00:58:23.777 --> 00:58:25.378]  I told you, they can ask for your ID card.
[00:58:44.147 --> 00:58:48.116]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:54.648 --> 00:58:55.909]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:55.909 --> 00:58:59.772]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:59.772 --> 00:59:02.074]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:02.074 --> 00:59:07.938]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:07.938 --> 00:59:14.183]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:14.603 --> 00:59:20.547]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:20.547 --> 00:59:24.750]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:29.052]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:29.052 --> 00:59:34.996]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:34.996 --> 00:59:38.558]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:38.558 --> 00:59:40.539]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:40.539 --> 00:59:40.980]  It's here.

[00:59:53.373 --> 00:59:55.755]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.755 --> 00:59:58.518]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:10.049]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.049 --> 01:00:11.631]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.631 --> 01:00:13.193]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:17.379]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.379 --> 01:00:21.444]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.909 --> 01:00:42.010]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's all happening.
[01:00:42.010 --> 01:00:45.991]  We're on site with the surrounded under siege Bilderberg group.
[01:00:45.991 --> 01:00:49.813]  Multiple members of Parliament are making their way down there to go confront the police.
[01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:51.393]  Letters have been sent to the police.
[01:00:51.393 --> 01:00:55.995]  That report is going up right now in the next 15 minutes from Curt Nemo and Infowars.com.
[01:00:55.995 --> 01:01:00.596]  You better believe it'll be on Drudge, because Drudge is on this, the biggest news website in the world.
[01:01:00.596 --> 01:01:02.137]  And we're joined by Lucas
[01:01:05.103 --> 01:01:06.925]  Thanks to you for the interest in these events.
[01:01:31.348 --> 01:01:35.330]  Yes, I'm here because I do support democracy.
[01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:37.772]  I do support freedom of people.
[01:01:37.772 --> 01:01:42.714]  And I do not like what they do in the Hotel Sofresa now.
[01:01:42.714 --> 01:01:45.776]  I think we want more transparency.
[01:01:45.776 --> 01:01:52.880]  The people have a right to know what they do there, what they decide there, who is there.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.621]  And so I support these guys here.
[01:01:55.666 --> 01:01:57.627]  Yes, it's the leading party in Switzerland.
[01:02:26.946 --> 01:02:29.869]  Yes, we have to confront them with the Bilderberg Group.
[01:02:29.869 --> 01:02:33.793]  We have to ask them the questions people want to know.
[01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:42.221]  And it's important that also politicians try to talk about that.
[01:02:44.691 --> 01:02:48.574]  Yes, I'm very concerned about Bilderberg and about their plans for the world.
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:19.671]  Because I do support freedom, I do support democracy of the people, and I do not want that some few people to decide about all the people.
[01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:20.692]  Very well said, sir.
[01:03:20.692 --> 01:03:27.499]  And I'm told you're at a people's building, a public building, very near Bilderberg right now, correct?
[01:03:31.755 --> 01:03:36.637]  I'm told that there was another gentleman as well that wrote a letter.
[01:03:36.637 --> 01:03:39.018]  Is that member of parliament coming as well?
[01:03:39.018 --> 01:03:41.619]  Are other members joining you?
[01:03:41.619 --> 01:03:44.680]  Yes, two other members of the parliament are joining us tonight.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.921]  It's Pyramin Schwander and Dominic Bessig.
[01:03:47.921 --> 01:03:52.583]  They're also from the Swiss People's Party.
[01:03:52.583 --> 01:03:53.203]  Amazing, sir.
[01:03:53.203 --> 01:03:56.064]  We've got writers right now working on this.
[01:03:56.064 --> 01:03:58.525]  Again, Dominic wrote the original letter, correct?
[01:03:59.998 --> 01:04:04.479]  Exactly, yes.
[01:04:04.479 --> 01:04:05.359]  He's our hero.
[01:04:05.359 --> 01:04:08.080]  It's Jermaine Schwander.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:14.322]  He's the president of the Action for an Independent and Neutral Switzerland.
[01:04:14.322 --> 01:04:16.042]  The president of neutral Switzerland.
[01:04:16.042 --> 01:04:16.782]  Wow.
[01:04:16.782 --> 01:04:20.203]  You know, sir, I'm not even an expert... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:04:22.151 --> 01:04:23.212]  No, I'm sorry.
[01:04:23.212 --> 01:04:23.592]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:04:23.592 --> 01:04:26.054]  Sir, we've got to go to break and we're going back to the full audience.
[01:04:26.054 --> 01:04:28.776]  Can you hold with us just a few more minutes, sir?
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:54.255]  Lucas Reimann, a prominent member of Swiss Parliament, and even more prominent members, I mean, right up at the top of the government, are about to arrive.
[01:04:54.255 --> 01:04:57.020]  We're going to come back and ask him, when are they going up to the gates of Bilderberg?
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:58.502]  This is History.
[01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:03.252]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.252 --> 01:05:08.579]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:08.579 --> 01:05:10.102]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:10.102 --> 01:05:18.913]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:19.614 --> 01:05:27.155]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:27.155 --> 01:05:35.157]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:35.157 --> 01:05:40.378]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:05:40.378 --> 01:05:42.558]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:06:00.114 --> 01:06:04.657]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.657 --> 01:06:05.578]  Number 1.
[01:06:05.578 --> 01:06:09.001]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.001 --> 01:06:09.861]  Number 2.
[01:06:09.861 --> 01:06:14.745]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.745 --> 01:06:15.505]  It's true.
[01:06:15.505 --> 01:06:20.369]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.369 --> 01:06:21.190]  Number 3.
[01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:24.792]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.792 --> 01:06:28.475]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.675 --> 01:06:29.475]  Number four.
[01:06:29.475 --> 01:06:32.236]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.236 --> 01:06:35.917]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:35.917 --> 01:06:36.697]  Number five.
[01:06:36.697 --> 01:06:40.858]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.858 --> 01:06:45.900]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:50.081]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.081 --> 01:06:51.862]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:51.862 --> 01:06:56.463]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.

[01:07:15.568 --> 01:07:18.749]  That's a $75 savings and a one-month supply.
[01:07:18.749 --> 01:07:19.869]  Are you kidding me?

[01:08:00.617 --> 01:08:06.024]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.024 --> 01:08:08.327]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:14.684 --> 01:08:17.166]  Well, this is an historical broadcast.
[01:08:17.166 --> 01:08:22.410]  We're talking to a member of the Swiss Parliament right now, Lucas Reimann.
[01:08:22.410 --> 01:08:27.414]  Other members of the Parliament are soon to arrive.
[01:08:27.414 --> 01:08:33.839]  This is just incredible, and we're talking about the different party leaders that are arriving, who stand against the Globalists, the IMF, the World Bank.
[01:08:34.159 --> 01:08:36.900]  Takeovers of their sovereignty.
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:38.760]  These prominent members are preparing.
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:43.742]  They've already delivered the letter through Luke Rudowsky to then attempt to go to the police that work for them.
[01:08:43.742 --> 01:08:47.303]  They've written letters to the police saying Kissinger is a war criminal.
[01:08:47.303 --> 01:08:48.123]  He needs to be arrested.
[01:08:48.123 --> 01:08:56.105]  They've written letters to the prosecutors and one of the parliamentary leaders that's about to arrive has said he is going to march up there.
[01:08:56.105 --> 01:08:57.566]  Continuing with that,
[01:08:58.906 --> 01:09:00.627]  I'm very sorry, I couldn't understand you.
[01:09:00.627 --> 01:09:02.487]  They were here already talking.
[01:09:25.242 --> 01:09:31.885]  Yeah, we oppose the Bilderberg Group because we think in a democracy, people should decide.
[01:09:31.885 --> 01:09:36.188]  You know, in Switzerland, people can decide about every decision by a vote.
[01:09:36.188 --> 01:09:40.350]  People vote yes or no, and not a few people.
[01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:46.573]  The most rich people, the most important people, they can decide about the people.
[01:09:46.573 --> 01:09:50.235]  We think it should come from the people.
[01:09:50.235 --> 01:09:54.617]  We want freedom for the people and not this Bilderberg
[01:09:56.656 --> 01:10:01.239]  Now, before we went to break, you were talking about opposing the IMF World Bank.
[01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:10.664]  Can you explain to people what those systems are doing, what the Euro is doing, and why the Swiss are standing against it?
[01:10:10.664 --> 01:10:14.886]  Yeah, we did a lot of work in the Parliament against the IMF.
[01:10:14.886 --> 01:10:19.709]  You know, Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, it's not a member of the Euro.
[01:10:19.709 --> 01:10:25.852]  We also tried to get out Switzerland of the IMF, to stop this system that wants
[01:10:27.407 --> 01:10:31.991]  It's a slavery of the currencies and we have to stop that.
[01:10:31.991 --> 01:10:34.334]  We want freedom also for the currencies.
[01:10:37.321 --> 01:10:58.349]  What can you tell us about the plans that we've been told of today for the man you called your leader and please again tell us about his position in Swiss government in the parliament who's coming and who wrote the letter and is planning reportedly to go in March up to the gates of Bilderberg and reportedly demand to be let in?
[01:11:00.126 --> 01:11:05.147]  He tried to stop the Bilderberg Conference before it began.
[01:11:05.147 --> 01:11:12.148]  He wrote to our government, he wrote to the president here from St.
[01:11:12.148 --> 01:11:15.389]  Moritz, and he tried to stop the conference.
[01:11:15.389 --> 01:11:24.671]  He said a non-democratic, intransparent thing like that should not be here in Switzerland.
[01:11:26.690 --> 01:11:26.990]  Okay.
[01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.090]  Hello?
[01:11:58.651 --> 01:12:11.781]  Yes, we have this law and I think we, our judges have to use that against the conference.
[01:12:11.781 --> 01:12:15.724]  Now we're able to watch you live here, streaming video.
[01:12:15.724 --> 01:12:19.507]  Who is that fellow standing next to you, a member of parliament, Lucas Reimann?
[01:12:21.864 --> 01:12:41.747]  It's Dominic, he's just helping me because my English is not very good but what I can say is that here are some members of the National Parliament in Switzerland and they do support you, they do support Ron Paul and they hope it will change a lot in the world in the next year.
[01:12:41.747 --> 01:12:44.108]  Yes sir, I thought I recognized him.
[01:12:44.108 --> 01:12:46.828]  That's the fellow that helped write the original letters to get things going.
[01:12:46.828 --> 01:12:49.089]  We interviewed Dominic earlier.
[01:12:50.902 --> 01:12:51.903]  He will arrive at 8 o'clock here in St.
[01:12:51.903 --> 01:12:52.123]  Moritz.
[01:12:52.123 --> 01:12:52.604]  European time.
[01:12:52.604 --> 01:12:53.304]  30 minutes, yes.
[01:13:15.879 --> 01:13:16.439]  We try our best.
[01:13:16.439 --> 01:13:19.681]  I can call him and ask if he could arrive a little bit earlier.
[01:13:36.863 --> 01:13:37.523]  Oh no, that's fine.
[01:13:37.523 --> 01:13:39.944]  We're going to be going into the next hour, sir.
[01:13:39.944 --> 01:13:52.888]  So we're going to let you go, but if you have anything else you'd like to add, and then we'll obviously get your phone number, and then we're going to follow you around so that we can have full coverage of what's happening.
[01:13:52.888 --> 01:13:56.489]  Okay, thank you so much for your work, and good luck for the future.
[01:13:57.230 --> 01:13:57.910]  Thank you so much.
[01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:59.651]  Please give the phone back to Paul Watson.
[01:13:59.651 --> 01:14:00.511]  Jaren, talk to Paul.
[01:14:00.511 --> 01:14:01.271]  Give him the direction.
[01:14:01.271 --> 01:14:02.071]  Thank you.
[01:14:02.071 --> 01:14:02.471]  All right.
[01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:03.832]  This is unbelievable.
[01:14:03.832 --> 01:14:11.313]  This is what real media, real cutting edge, real new network, next generation info war is about.
[01:14:11.313 --> 01:14:13.934]  We are watching live video from Switzerland.
[01:14:13.934 --> 01:14:17.935]  If you're a presentplanet.tv member, the radio listeners are listening to this.
[01:14:17.935 --> 01:14:19.415]  This is all happening live time.
[01:14:19.415 --> 01:14:20.595]  And I'm the director of this.
[01:14:20.595 --> 01:14:22.176]  So I am here on air.
[01:14:23.216 --> 01:14:38.501]  From Austin, Texas, directing great patriots and media people there in their coverage of what's happening and talking to folks, along with the rest of the crew, helping in this symphony to bring you this information.
[01:14:38.501 --> 01:14:40.021]  Great job to the crew.
[01:14:40.021 --> 01:14:43.062]  I am absolutely blown away by the coverage today.
[01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:44.402]  I would imagine you are.
[01:14:44.402 --> 01:14:45.503]  This is so exciting.
[01:14:47.489 --> 01:14:57.082]  You know, I only did this one time on air about two years ago because it's such a big deal to my family and your family and everybody else who loves freedom, anybody that doesn't want to be a slave.
[01:14:57.082 --> 01:14:58.724]  The globalists control the oil.
[01:14:58.724 --> 01:14:59.765]  They control the carbon.
[01:14:59.765 --> 01:15:01.788]  They've designed a carbon-based system.
[01:15:02.569 --> 01:15:02.629]  We
[01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:46.042]  System and when it came out with the emails and the premeditated lies and the fact that they know carbon is good And more carbon dioxide is good that the temperature is actually Started dropping overall they can always show you some micro temperature increases But I can show you decreases the point is I had the guys go get champagne and pop it on air And I've obviously got a long trip ahead of me a lot of work to do today, so I'm not gonna do that I'm not a big drinker, but let me tell you tonight in New York
[01:15:47.307 --> 01:15:58.516]  I'm gonna go out to dinner with tomorrow night, Gerald Salente, but with Ted Anderson, you better believe, and I don't even like champagne that much, there's gonna be a bottle of expensive champagne being drunk.
[01:15:58.516 --> 01:16:01.838]  Because, I mean, this is awesome.
[01:16:01.838 --> 01:16:04.460]  And we are about to see something that is so...
[01:16:05.621 --> 01:16:09.584]  Off the charts, just absolutely fantastic.
[01:16:09.584 --> 01:16:15.508]  I am beside myself right now with glee.
[01:16:15.508 --> 01:16:25.934]  The huge dam breaking, Drudge Report, Newsweek, Time, BBC, London Guardian, hundreds of other papers, Bilderberg, World Government, what are they talking about in there?
[01:16:25.934 --> 01:16:33.559]  We've got the moles inside, we've got the intel, we've got live video, and now three prominent, one of them is like,
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.901]  I was looking him up the last few weeks.
[01:16:35.901 --> 01:16:37.443]  I read about him years ago.
[01:16:37.443 --> 01:16:39.205]  He's bigger than Ron Paul in Switzerland.
[01:16:39.205 --> 01:16:41.387]  I mean, the Ron Paul of Switzerland.
[01:16:41.387 --> 01:16:43.088]  Very high level in the Parliament.
[01:16:43.088 --> 01:16:44.810]  Right up beneath the Prime Minister.
[01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:47.192]  He is marching on Bilderberg today.
[01:16:47.192 --> 01:16:48.414]  The Prime Minister came out.
[01:16:48.414 --> 01:16:49.354]  It was in Swiss papers.
[01:16:49.354 --> 01:16:50.956]  We did screenshots of those.
[01:16:50.956 --> 01:16:52.237]  Put them on Infowars.com.
[01:16:53.098 --> 01:17:03.629]  And prisonplanet.com and they are getting, you know, those are now up on the site with the headlines that the Prime Minister says they don't like the meeting happening there.
[01:17:03.629 --> 01:17:06.192]  I mean, it is a rebuke.
[01:17:06.192 --> 01:17:14.200]  See, with their trillions, with their fancy suits, with their Mercedes, with their armed guards, with all of this mystique and the helicopters, everybody just bows down to them.
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:14.420]  Why?
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:14.900]  They're crooks!
[01:17:15.481 --> 01:17:23.349]  It's like Bank of America thinking they can take houses without even having any type of deed or somebody buys the house in cash.
[01:17:23.349 --> 01:17:25.191]  They have no history, no claim.
[01:17:25.191 --> 01:17:25.912]  They come and take it.
[01:17:25.912 --> 01:17:27.934]  The court says, well, it's five months later.
[01:17:27.934 --> 01:17:28.955]  We said give them their house back.
[01:17:28.955 --> 01:17:29.776]  You haven't.
[01:17:29.776 --> 01:17:35.943]  So we're going to send deputies to seize your bank and take the cash out and pay them on the barrelhead.
[01:17:37.148 --> 01:17:38.409]  That's the people's court!
[01:17:38.409 --> 01:17:39.429]  That's America!
[01:17:39.429 --> 01:17:40.310]  That's Switzerland!
[01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:41.310]  That's what the Dutch had!
[01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:42.471]  That's real freedom!
[01:17:42.471 --> 01:17:44.572]  Nobody else ever had what the Swiss have had!
[01:17:44.572 --> 01:17:46.753]  Nobody ever had what people in America had!
[01:17:46.753 --> 01:17:48.534]  Nobody ever had what the Dutch had!
[01:17:48.534 --> 01:17:49.735]  And they're taking it away!
[01:17:50.737 --> 01:17:53.781]  It's a lie that our system came from the Greeks and the Romans.
[01:17:53.781 --> 01:17:55.724]  There's a little bit of that in there.
[01:17:55.724 --> 01:17:59.789]  It's Swiss, and people better get that through their head.
[01:17:59.789 --> 01:18:08.100]  The Swiss are all given automatic weapons and hand grenades, and then they have yearly searches in the house to make sure the guns are hidden.
[01:18:09.090 --> 01:18:14.612]  To make sure if a foreign government comes in, your guns are so hidden, our own gun finders can't find them.
[01:18:14.612 --> 01:18:16.312]  I mean, that's what it's all about.
[01:18:16.312 --> 01:18:24.295]  People are like, well, one of the freest groups, the richest group, lowest crime rate in the world, automatic weapons, hand grenades, grenade launchers.
[01:18:24.295 --> 01:18:27.195]  The crime rate is non-existent.
[01:18:27.195 --> 01:18:30.597]  And I'm telling you, that's why it's happening there.
[01:18:30.597 --> 01:18:35.118]  The people are marching on that thing, and the big demonstration is tomorrow.
[01:18:36.124 --> 01:18:38.729]  The big demonstration is tomorrow, high noon.
[01:18:38.729 --> 01:18:40.272]  There's other demonstrations going.
[01:18:40.272 --> 01:18:45.923]  If you're in Europe, I mean, if you're in places like Germany, France, Italy...
[01:18:47.519 --> 01:18:50.260]  Of course, Austria, you're two hours away from St.
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:52.081]  Moritz if you live near the border.
[01:18:52.081 --> 01:18:53.702]  I don't care if you're ten hours away, get there!
[01:18:53.702 --> 01:18:57.544]  Eastern Europe, these are the globalists that have already sucked you dry over and over again.
[01:18:57.544 --> 01:19:08.469]  These are the robber barons, these are the crooks, these are the austerity masters, these are the people, these are the globalists, these are the control freaks, these are the individuals that are the enemies of free humanity.
[01:19:08.469 --> 01:19:08.689]  Show!
[01:19:09.764 --> 01:19:10.485]  Burn rubber.
[01:19:10.485 --> 01:19:10.965]  Get there.
[01:19:10.965 --> 01:19:11.846]  Get on a train.
[01:19:11.846 --> 01:19:12.326]  Get there.
[01:19:12.326 --> 01:19:13.267]  Confront them.
[01:19:13.267 --> 01:19:25.976]  The police have been told by multiple members of Parliament who are now arriving on site, one of them already there, they are telling them, listen police, they've sent letters to the police, letters to the prosecutors, you leave the people alone, you let them cover this.
[01:19:25.976 --> 01:19:30.259]  And we're going, and you arrest Henry Kissinger, there's an EU arrest warrant out for him.
[01:19:30.259 --> 01:19:31.741]  You get in there and you get him!
[01:19:32.898 --> 01:19:35.099]  You get in there and you get him!
[01:19:35.099 --> 01:19:37.259]  And now they're about to march up there.
[01:19:37.259 --> 01:19:38.940]  And I gotta go get on a plane in two hours.
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:40.480]  I got Aaron and them coming up.
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.320]  I'm gonna cut it close.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:42.881]  I'm gonna be into the third hour today.
[01:19:42.881 --> 01:19:44.101]  Riding shotgun with them.
[01:19:44.101 --> 01:19:45.761]  This is off the charts.
[01:19:45.761 --> 01:19:47.162]  I'll take a later flight tonight.
[01:19:47.162 --> 01:19:50.883]  I have got to be here while this happens.
[01:19:50.883 --> 01:19:52.963]  This is so exciting.
[01:19:52.963 --> 01:19:54.824]  This is history happening.
[01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:57.864]  This is the new world order being identified.
[01:19:57.864 --> 01:19:58.865]  Identified!

[01:24:13.812 --> 01:24:16.252]  There's a scene you'll like to catch.
[01:24:16.252 --> 01:24:17.913]  The band is playing Dixie.
[01:24:17.913 --> 01:24:20.514]  The man got his hand out stressed.
[01:24:29.002 --> 01:24:44.576]  Okay, Dominic Becic, who's one of the senior members of the parliament in Switzerland, is preparing about to arrive in the next 30 minutes and then to march on Bilderberg shortly after that, after they organize.
[01:24:44.576 --> 01:24:48.780]  Our crew, Aaron Dykes, Paul Watson are with them.
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:50.902]  This is imminent happening.
[01:24:50.902 --> 01:24:53.945]  Letters have been delivered to the police telling them to stand down.
[01:24:55.584 --> 01:24:57.265]  It's very good to be here.
[01:24:57.265 --> 01:24:59.647]  What do you make of this historic thing that's happening right now?
[01:24:59.647 --> 01:25:01.949]  Are you in the middle of it right now?
[01:25:26.424 --> 01:25:26.964]  I'm not.
[01:25:26.964 --> 01:25:28.965]  There's a lot of historic things going on at the moment, it seems.
[01:25:28.965 --> 01:25:31.266]  That's just one of them.
[01:25:31.266 --> 01:25:36.067]  And there's actually three, I think, I'm told there's three Swiss MPs that are currently there.
[01:25:36.067 --> 01:25:44.991]  So that's quite a number of serious people that are concerned about what's going on in their country.
[01:25:44.991 --> 01:25:48.812]  Well, break down from your reportage what you think the most important points are.
[01:25:55.091 --> 01:26:05.759]  The Chancellor of the Exchequer of Great Britain, George Osborne, has just been confirmed as attending, not as a private individual, but as the Chancellor of the Exchequer in an official capacity.
[01:26:05.759 --> 01:26:10.503]  And he's there with Treasury staff, and I presume that the British taxpayer is paying for that.
[01:26:10.503 --> 01:26:17.168]  So this raises an enormous number of questions, because the Treasury told me that he's here and he's meeting with
[01:26:18.268 --> 01:26:19.609]  Other international foreign ministers.
[01:26:19.609 --> 01:26:37.121]  So you've got a situation where the Chancellor of Exchequer is meeting in an official capacity, discussing presumably then policy with, you know, other heads of state, other finance ministers, with the head of Airbus, with the, you know, head of Deutsche Bank, with the Russian oligarch.
[01:26:37.121 --> 01:26:38.582]  I mean, you know, what's going on?
[01:26:38.582 --> 01:26:41.484]  And it's a four-day, very in-depth conference.
[01:26:41.484 --> 01:26:44.386]  And why exactly is that being that summit?
[01:26:48.567 --> 01:26:51.530]  Great.
[01:26:51.530 --> 01:27:02.040]  Well, Charlie, what do you make of them putting up this giant shower curtain, I thought it was a good piece you wrote, excellent piece, describing how guilty they act?
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:07.466]  Well, I just find it, do you know what, I genuinely find it embarrassing, I find it childish.
[01:27:07.466 --> 01:27:10.329]  I mean, you've probably seen them before, and I've seen them.
[01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:21.660]  And you know, they duck down, roll around, and I'm thinking, what are you doing?
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:23.601]  You're not behaving like a grown-up.
[01:27:23.601 --> 01:27:29.044]  These are royalty, Fortune 500, elected politicians, many of them breaking the law to be there.
[01:27:29.044 --> 01:27:33.766]  That's why they're covering their faces up, because for decades the media wouldn't admit this was real.
[01:27:33.766 --> 01:27:42.791]  Charlie, what do you think now, knowing, because it's been in the news that BBC, Washington Post, were attending this decades ago and lying to their viewers and readers and telling them it didn't exist?
[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:58.322]  Well you know what, it's an extraordinary thing and you can feel, and I've been doing this for three years so I'm still a youngster in Bilderberg terms, but even in that short time you can feel the pressure that's being put on the mainstream media from the, let's call them
[01:28:03.206 --> 01:28:09.011]  The pressure that's coming upwards and forcing upwards from the ground this story and saying, look, it's important.
[01:28:09.011 --> 01:28:10.452]  Look, there are important people here.
[01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:11.232]  Look at them.
[01:28:11.232 --> 01:28:13.594]  Look, here's a photograph I've got through a car window.
[01:28:13.594 --> 01:28:14.435]  This is important.
[01:28:14.435 --> 01:28:16.116]  This is a head of a bank.
[01:28:16.116 --> 01:28:18.278]  This is my foreign minister.
[01:28:18.278 --> 01:28:20.219]  Please pay attention, mainstream media.
[01:28:20.219 --> 01:28:22.982]  Please pay attention.
[01:28:22.982 --> 01:28:32.249]  And the force of it, there's so much determination you can see amongst the citizen journalists, particularly the determination to make this story real by having it
[01:28:33.912 --> 01:28:40.375]  It's going to take some time, it may not be this year, but it's getting there, it's getting there.
[01:28:40.375 --> 01:28:53.620]  And you know, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, does something so stupid to attend this meeting in an official capacity rather than as a private individual, you know, surely, I'm just waiting on this, it's just broken now, surely the British media at the very least are going to pick up on this.
[01:28:58.773 --> 01:29:01.495]  Well, maybe he'll put a D-Notice out.
[01:29:01.495 --> 01:29:03.636]  Maybe you'll get the government D-Notice that you can't report.
[01:29:03.636 --> 01:29:03.936]  Go ahead.
[01:29:16.804 --> 01:29:17.984]  You know, you're not George Osborne.
[01:29:17.984 --> 01:29:21.325]  You're George Osborne, MP, Chancellor of the Exchequer.
[01:29:21.325 --> 01:29:24.306]  A very, very significant difference has just taken place.
[01:29:24.306 --> 01:29:30.688]  You know, I did one of those things... Stay there, Charlie Skelton, the London Guardian, the biggest paper in Europe, arguably, not just in England.
[01:29:30.688 --> 01:29:34.089]  Can you stay with us a little bit into the next segment?
[01:29:34.089 --> 01:29:34.750]  Sure, sure.
[01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:36.230]  Alright, Charlie Skelton.
[01:29:36.230 --> 01:29:36.770]  Great guy.
[01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:41.232]  He's the guy, by the way, that originally got the list and gave it to us, and we've got it out right now, linked on Drudge.
[01:29:41.232 --> 01:29:42.252]  We really want to thank Charlie.
[01:29:42.252 --> 01:29:43.873]  He's a real go-getter.
[01:29:43.873 --> 01:29:44.553]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:44.553 --> 01:29:44.973]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.768 --> 01:29:54.699]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.699 --> 01:29:57.366]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.503 --> 01:30:06.464]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:06.464 --> 01:30:15.325]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:15.325 --> 01:30:19.946]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:19.946 --> 01:30:30.768]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:31.408 --> 01:30:40.930]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:46.352]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:46.352 --> 01:30:53.833]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:53.833 --> 01:30:56.594]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:31:01.713 --> 01:31:05.737]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:05.737 --> 01:31:08.981]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:08.981 --> 01:31:13.786]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:13.786 --> 01:31:20.172]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:20.172 --> 01:31:22.415]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:22.915 --> 01:31:24.436]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:31:24.436 --> 01:31:25.717]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:25.717 --> 01:31:27.958]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.846 --> 01:31:43.987]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:31:43.987 --> 01:31:49.128]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:49.128 --> 01:31:58.231]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:00.219 --> 01:32:04.762]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.762 --> 01:32:05.682]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.682 --> 01:32:09.104]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.104 --> 01:32:09.964]  Number 2.
[01:32:09.964 --> 01:32:14.847]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.847 --> 01:32:15.588]  It's true.
[01:32:15.588 --> 01:32:20.470]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:21.291]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.291 --> 01:32:24.873]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:28.595]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.775 --> 01:32:29.576]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.576 --> 01:32:32.338]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.338 --> 01:32:36.021]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.021 --> 01:32:36.822]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.822 --> 01:32:40.966]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.966 --> 01:32:45.730]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.010 --> 01:32:50.176]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.176 --> 01:32:51.979]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.979 --> 01:32:54.242]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:54.242 --> 01:32:56.585]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:27.307]  It is nearly impossible for me to get butterflies.
[01:33:27.307 --> 01:33:28.648]  I get angry very easy.
[01:33:28.648 --> 01:33:30.410]  I have a lot of energy.
[01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:32.511]  But it's hard for me to get butterflies.
[01:33:32.511 --> 01:33:35.013]  I'll get chills of excitement, but I don't get butterflies.
[01:33:35.013 --> 01:33:38.175]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got butterflies like I'm...
[01:33:39.548 --> 01:33:44.071]  Eleven years old, about to ask a girl to, you know, go to the movies for the first time.
[01:33:44.071 --> 01:33:53.737]  And yes, when I was 11, I was already saying, you know, trying to talk to girls' parents at public school and get them to let, you know, come pick me up or my parents come pick him up, take him to a movie.
[01:33:53.737 --> 01:33:54.818]  I got butterflies like that.
[01:33:55.538 --> 01:33:58.639]  All the other 11-year-olds were saying they still hated girls, not me.
[01:33:58.639 --> 01:34:01.019]  I liked them the minute I saw them.
[01:34:01.019 --> 01:34:03.900]  But side issue, the point is, I've got major butterflies.
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.580]  Five more minutes with Charlie Skelton.
[01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:08.881]  We've got Bob Chapman waiting in the wings with economic breakdown.
[01:34:08.881 --> 01:34:12.702]  So many big things happening, but we're in the next 30 minutes to an hour.
[01:34:12.702 --> 01:34:13.642]  They're about to arrive.
[01:34:13.642 --> 01:34:15.142]  We just had a member of parliament on.
[01:34:15.142 --> 01:34:19.163]  We're going to work on getting the main member, who is the equivalent of Ron Paul,
[01:34:20.343 --> 01:34:23.945]  Over there, Dominic Bettig, who is going to march on Bilderberg.
[01:34:23.945 --> 01:34:33.128]  He sent letters to the Bilderberg group, police that are guarding him, that he's their boss and what they're doing is illegal and he wants Kissinger arrested.
[01:34:33.128 --> 01:34:35.869]  There's an arrest warrant out for him.
[01:34:35.869 --> 01:34:40.031]  And they're openly saying, you want world government, we don't want it, you're not going to destroy Switzerland.
[01:34:40.031 --> 01:34:41.812]  This is how a country behaves!
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:44.745]  This is what it's all about!
[01:34:44.745 --> 01:34:46.190]  These people are scum!
[01:34:46.190 --> 01:34:47.474]  They're usurpers!
[01:34:47.474 --> 01:34:48.819]  They're taking us over!
[01:34:48.819 --> 01:34:49.401]  WAKE UP!
[01:34:50.427 --> 01:34:51.048]  Wake up!
[01:34:51.048 --> 01:34:52.329]  We can sweep them aside.
[01:34:52.329 --> 01:34:53.229]  Now, two issues here.
[01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.910]  It just broke.
[01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:56.652]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:34:56.652 --> 01:34:59.715]  In fact, it may just be on the internal network now.
[01:34:59.715 --> 01:35:01.236]  It may not be live yet.
[01:35:01.236 --> 01:35:02.177]  No, it's live.
[01:35:02.177 --> 01:35:02.437]  It's live.
[01:35:02.437 --> 01:35:04.299]  We're going to put it on screen for everybody.
[01:35:04.299 --> 01:35:05.099]  Bombshell.
[01:35:05.099 --> 01:35:09.383]  Swiss parliamentarians to force way into Bilderberg.
[01:35:09.383 --> 01:35:10.604]  Bombshell.
[01:35:10.604 --> 01:35:14.147]  Swiss parliamentarians to force way into Bilderberg.
[01:35:14.147 --> 01:35:17.109]  You heard it from a prominent member of parliament 30 minutes ago, 25 minutes ago.
[01:35:19.665 --> 01:35:21.346]  The letter's been sent.
[01:35:21.346 --> 01:35:23.388]  This is too awesome.
[01:35:23.388 --> 01:35:24.249]  This is too awesome.
[01:35:24.249 --> 01:35:26.150]  I cannot tell you how big this is.
[01:35:26.150 --> 01:35:36.457]  We also are launching a email magazine slash special videos for folks that sign up because we can't just trust YouTube and Google and Twitter.
[01:35:36.457 --> 01:35:37.859]  We gotta have our own Twitter system.
[01:35:37.859 --> 01:35:42.042]  We're going to the old basic email that's low-tech with a high-tech overlay.
[01:35:42.042 --> 01:35:45.244]  There's a special exclusive video only on our servers.
[01:35:45.244 --> 01:35:47.386]  There's a special exclusive article by Kurt Nimmo.
[01:35:48.146 --> 01:35:57.549]  And a bunch of other exclusive photos at the InfoWars Insider, Volume 1, Issue 1, right now, top right-hand corner of InfoWars.com.
[01:35:57.549 --> 01:36:06.151]  Just put in your email, and bam, sign up, and it goes out at 2 o'clock today, an hour and 25 minutes from now, the maiden voyage of that InfoWars Insider.
[01:36:06.151 --> 01:36:13.373]  Special reports, hottest news, inside scoop, exclusive videos, incredible inside report with the latest info.
[01:36:14.973 --> 01:36:18.936]  It's going out to InfoWars Insiders in T-minus one hour, 25 minutes.
[01:36:18.936 --> 01:36:20.697]  So sign up now, but there it is on screen.
[01:36:20.697 --> 01:36:24.480]  Finishing up with Charlie Skelton and then to the incredible... I just got chills again.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:25.921]  I mean, everything's starting to happen.
[01:36:25.921 --> 01:36:26.742]  China says the U.S.
[01:36:26.742 --> 01:36:28.023]  has already defaulted on the debt.
[01:36:28.023 --> 01:36:31.025]  Of course, I told you that, but it's now... Oh, my... I mean, this is huge.
[01:36:31.565 --> 01:36:33.146]  I can't even believe this is happening.
[01:36:33.146 --> 01:36:34.827]  This is, it's all coming down.
[01:36:34.827 --> 01:36:48.416]  Charlie Skelton, do you not have the same feeling that everything, the wars, the implosions, the depressions, the corruption, the scandals, are just, everything is racing now, like they did in other times in history before World War I, World War II.
[01:36:48.416 --> 01:36:51.338]  Can you not feel the electricity in the air, Charlie Skelton?
[01:36:52.355 --> 01:36:56.678]  Yeah, you know, it's difficult because we're only here now to take a perspective like that.
[01:36:56.678 --> 01:36:58.399]  But, you know, certainly there's stuff happening.
[01:36:58.399 --> 01:37:10.846]  And when you say something like the story about the Chinese default, it's very interesting to note that there's two Chinese delegates at Bilderberg this year, which I believe is fairly unusual.
[01:37:10.846 --> 01:37:12.107]  I believe that's the first time.
[01:37:12.107 --> 01:37:14.149]  I think there's been a Chinese businessman there before.
[01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:15.329]  Yeah, no, this is big.
[01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:16.150]  This is big powwow.
[01:37:16.798 --> 01:37:18.099]  Any other key points?
[01:37:18.099 --> 01:37:20.900]  What's coming up next in your incredible reportage?
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:28.304]  Give us any of your websites or places where we can find out more about the great job you do.
[01:37:46.650 --> 01:37:51.152]  Well, just go to the Guardian website, guardian.co.uk, and have a look at the news.
[01:37:51.152 --> 01:37:55.214]  In fact, search Bilderberg, because there's not much out there, to be quite honest.
[01:37:55.214 --> 01:37:56.755]  So it should pop up fairly easily.
[01:37:56.755 --> 01:38:03.218]  We're about to head up the hill and see what in fact is going to happen, and you're absolutely right, that would be extraordinary.
[01:38:03.218 --> 01:38:06.080]  Absolutely extraordinary if three MPs marched
[01:38:07.076 --> 01:38:08.057]  Up to the police cordon.
[01:38:08.057 --> 01:38:09.838]  I mean, I just don't know what they're going to do.
[01:38:09.838 --> 01:38:23.749]  No, they've told me they're doing it, and they've also told the gentleman that was with the other Swiss minister that they are doing it, and the big cheese is set to arrive here in just the next 20, 30 minutes or so.
[01:38:23.749 --> 01:38:28.533]  They may get organized, but they're right up at that public building right up the street.
[01:38:29.033 --> 01:38:30.074]  Because the Swiss get together.
[01:38:30.074 --> 01:38:31.256]  They don't just watch TV all day.
[01:38:31.256 --> 01:38:35.701]  They actually, you know, hang out at local community areas and, you know, drink beer and play games.
[01:38:35.701 --> 01:38:36.462]  Evil type folks.
[01:38:36.462 --> 01:38:37.063]  They all have guns.
[01:38:38.903 --> 01:38:40.704]  Yeah, no, that's the company.
[01:38:40.704 --> 01:38:41.584]  It is East German.
[01:38:41.584 --> 01:38:42.624]  Again, a throwback to the Stasi.
[01:38:42.624 --> 01:38:44.105]  That's who they've got to get.
[01:39:08.285 --> 01:39:09.785]  But isn't that always the way?
[01:39:09.785 --> 01:39:13.747]  If you're trying to police your own country, you have to do it with outsiders because they don't care.
[01:39:13.747 --> 01:39:18.508]  This literally is breaking.
[01:39:18.508 --> 01:39:23.030]  We're on the edge of something historic in Bilderberg terms.
[01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:24.390]  What is going to happen?
[01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:27.812]  I'm literally about to jump in the car and drive uphill.
[01:39:29.392 --> 01:39:29.752]  We're good to go.
[01:39:54.957 --> 01:39:55.819]  Absolutely, thank you so much.
[01:39:55.819 --> 01:39:57.562]  Tucker's mole, but we're not supposed to...
[01:40:05.265 --> 01:40:06.005]  Whatever.
[01:40:06.005 --> 01:40:08.707]  Okay, thank you so much.
[01:40:08.707 --> 01:40:13.049]  Trying to fence this through Skelton to throw him off, but whatever, they already know they're listening to everything.
[01:40:13.049 --> 01:40:15.670]  I wonder if my wife will get any death threats this week.
[01:40:15.670 --> 01:40:23.654]  Every time I cover Bilderberg, when it's going on, the mean phone calls come in where they tell her, we were just listening to what you said so you know who we are.
[01:40:23.654 --> 01:40:24.755]  We were listening to your phone line.
[01:40:24.755 --> 01:40:26.195]  Now do you take me serious?
[01:40:26.195 --> 01:40:27.536]  I'm gonna cut your head off.
[01:40:27.536 --> 01:40:28.677]  These are nice people, folks.
[01:40:28.677 --> 01:40:29.777]  They're such nice old men.
[01:40:29.777 --> 01:40:32.479]  Now going to Bob Chapman.
[01:40:33.544 --> 01:40:33.824]  I don't know.
[01:40:51.355 --> 01:41:00.261]  I've got to go catch an airplane, but I'm going to have Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson from the demonstration live on cell phones and with live video feeds from the cell phones.
[01:41:21.455 --> 01:41:22.696]  It doesn't matter, history's happening.
[01:41:22.696 --> 01:41:29.082]  Bob, are you beside yourself with joy right now at what is about to happen?
[01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:30.643]  I certainly am.
[01:41:30.643 --> 01:41:39.991]  And I'd love to see the confrontation between the security guards and the members of the Swiss Parliament.
[01:41:39.991 --> 01:41:42.333]  That ought to be very interesting.
[01:41:42.333 --> 01:41:43.594]  They speak the same language.
[01:41:44.606 --> 01:41:48.549]  Uh, although the Swiss usually speak three or more languages.
[01:41:48.549 --> 01:41:50.030]  And I've lived there for a long time.
[01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:52.092]  Well, by the way, leaders are supposed to lead.
[01:41:52.092 --> 01:41:56.576]  Members of Parliament and Congress are supposed to march into corrupt meetings and get in people's faces.
[01:41:56.576 --> 01:41:58.977]  They're supposed to turn over the money changers' tables.
[01:41:58.977 --> 01:42:02.420]  This is what America's supposed to be all about, Bob!
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:07.004]  And that's what we should be doing, and we're not doing that in our country.
[01:42:07.004 --> 01:42:09.886]  And it's, uh, very, very disappointing.
[01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:13.811]  Well, at least the Swiss, some of the Swiss are up front.
[01:42:13.811 --> 01:42:16.732]  They're going to make an issue out of it.
[01:42:16.732 --> 01:42:28.937]  I think probably the one of the main things they're going to be talking about at the Bilderberg meeting is the problem that they have in Europe with the six countries that are in trouble, particularly Greece.
[01:42:28.937 --> 01:42:30.598]  How are we going to handle it?
[01:42:30.598 --> 01:42:39.481]  And the tables have actually been turned on the bankers because if they don't offer the Greeks a super duper deal,
[01:42:40.336 --> 01:42:41.557]  No collateralization.
[01:42:41.557 --> 01:42:44.179]  Low interest rates.
[01:42:44.179 --> 01:42:45.780]  Give us a break.
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:46.661]  They're going to default.
[01:42:46.661 --> 01:42:49.623]  If they default, all the big banks in Europe go down.
[01:42:49.623 --> 01:42:52.365]  It's as simple as that.
[01:42:52.365 --> 01:42:53.746]  And now they don't know what to do.
[01:42:53.746 --> 01:42:55.767]  They pushed hard on the other end.
[01:42:55.767 --> 01:43:02.752]  They lost because the people over there realized because Alex Jones
[01:43:03.777 --> 01:43:07.520]  And Max Keiser and Bob Chapman have been on the radio, etc.
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:07.960]  etc.
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:11.622]  over there and following the people over the last year or so.
[01:43:11.622 --> 01:43:13.784]  And now they're confronting them.
[01:43:13.784 --> 01:43:16.665]  And they don't know what to do!
[01:43:16.665 --> 01:43:32.476]  In another matter, did you notice a couple of days ago, Mr. Blank Fine, who's the head of JPMorgan Chase, he's the one that tells us he's doing God's work, he told Mr. Bernanke
[01:43:33.251 --> 01:43:43.878]  That we don't want this 3% reserve that we have to hold apart because, what he meant to say was, we want to gamble with the money.
[01:43:43.878 --> 01:43:46.239]  We can't do that if you do that.
[01:43:46.239 --> 01:43:49.181]  And so there's consternation there.
[01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:59.968]  And the ideas of Bernanke on reserves have come from the Bank for International Settlements, which is the banker's bank.
[01:44:00.811 --> 01:44:06.334]  And they're saying, you know, if anything goes haywire, you're going to need as much money as you have.
[01:44:06.334 --> 01:44:10.176]  You can't risk losing it in the interim.
[01:44:10.176 --> 01:44:12.317]  So we got that going on as well.
[01:44:12.317 --> 01:44:20.261]  So we got plenty of things that reflect internal problems among the Bilderbergers, we'll call them.
[01:44:22.918 --> 01:44:26.902]  Bob, what do you make of the Chinese that I've never seen at Bilderberg?
[01:44:26.902 --> 01:44:29.245]  Never seen Chinese, we've seen Arabs a few times.
[01:44:29.245 --> 01:44:39.336]  One time there was a multi-billionaire Chinese businessman there years ago, but to have one of their top economists there and a government minister there,
[01:44:39.836 --> 01:44:46.739]  That shows the showdown is on, and we have AFP, French News Agency, reporting China's rating houses say U.S.
[01:44:46.739 --> 01:44:47.840]  is defaulting.
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:53.402]  As we've kept saying, the default's on via the hyperinflation, the QE2 going into QE3.
[01:44:53.402 --> 01:44:56.023]  Everything we've talked about is now just coming out in the open.
[01:44:56.023 --> 01:44:57.684]  The Chinese are getting hopping mad.
[01:44:57.684 --> 01:45:02.266]  I mean, the Russians, by the way, of course, are not in the meeting.
[01:45:02.266 --> 01:45:03.126]  This is incredible.
[01:45:03.126 --> 01:45:04.427]  What do you make of that development?
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:12.743]  Well, I can, if you remember Monty Hall on television, let's make a deal.
[01:45:12.743 --> 01:45:15.765]  Well, that's why the Chinese are there.
[01:45:15.765 --> 01:45:19.487]  The Americans are going to tell him that's why Kissinger's there too.
[01:45:19.487 --> 01:45:24.349]  Supposedly the negotiator extraordinaire.
[01:45:24.349 --> 01:45:29.992]  They're going to try to make some sort of a deal where the Chinese aren't mad at them anymore.
[01:45:29.992 --> 01:45:33.434]  You know, everything is so up in the air.
[01:45:33.434 --> 01:45:34.335]  You've got this
[01:45:35.558 --> 01:45:50.608]  There's a mini-war going on in Congress, particularly the House of Representatives, in the extension of the short-term debt that will be allowed for the United States government.
[01:45:50.608 --> 01:46:03.017]  And if there is not an agreement, what's going to happen is that they're going to continue to use pension funds from the federal pension.
[01:46:03.755 --> 01:46:08.098]  And perhaps even try to take over 401Ks and IRAs.
[01:46:08.098 --> 01:46:17.245]  And in that process, they're going to have to continue to fund internally, or they're going to have some serious problems.
[01:46:17.245 --> 01:46:22.788]  And that is unsettling to them because they have always gotten their way.
[01:46:22.788 --> 01:46:26.151]  They're not getting it right now on that issue and many others.
[01:46:28.885 --> 01:46:30.648]  Well said, Bob.
[01:46:30.648 --> 01:46:33.031]  Looking at other news, they've launched a new war.
[01:46:33.031 --> 01:46:37.178]  The US is intensifying a secret campaign of Yemen airstrikes.
[01:46:37.178 --> 01:46:37.759]  We've got...
[01:46:40.911 --> 01:46:42.833]  It seems like all hell is breaking loose.
[01:46:42.833 --> 01:46:48.818]  They're now admitting there's massive shootouts routinely on the U.S.-Texas-Mexico border.
[01:46:48.818 --> 01:46:52.862]  The state police in Texas are refusing to cover it up anymore, putting out press releases.
[01:46:52.862 --> 01:46:53.563]  Members of the U.S.
[01:46:53.563 --> 01:46:57.346]  Congress are saying there is a cover-up about the war in Mexico.
[01:46:57.346 --> 01:47:00.389]  It's over, what, 30,000 dead now in the last two years?
[01:47:00.389 --> 01:47:05.153]  Armored vehicles, rocket attacks, kidnappings are exploding all over the Southwest in the U.S.
[01:47:06.634 --> 01:47:09.335]  More and more they're having to admit we're in a depression, not a recession.
[01:47:09.335 --> 01:47:12.716]  I mean, they're not going to be able to cover up what's going on much longer.
[01:47:12.716 --> 01:47:15.497]  I mean, all Haiti's... I don't think so.
[01:47:15.497 --> 01:47:20.139]  I think you're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:47:20.139 --> 01:47:25.520]  And, you know, that's been promulgated by us getting on and talking about the truth.
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:28.021]  This is really what's going on.
[01:47:28.021 --> 01:47:32.503]  And it's seeping in to the major media.
[01:47:32.503 --> 01:47:33.543]  They can't hold it back.
[01:47:34.901 --> 01:47:40.585]  I mean, I just saw two things on CNN by Jack Cafferty, whatever.
[01:47:40.585 --> 01:47:43.167]  I think that's his name.
[01:47:43.167 --> 01:47:45.229]  It sounded like us.
[01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:46.710]  And so we're seeping in.
[01:47:46.710 --> 01:47:49.052]  The truth is seeping in.
[01:47:49.052 --> 01:47:51.294]  And they're not going to be able to hold it back.
[01:47:51.294 --> 01:47:53.395]  I've got to make an announcement here.
[01:47:53.395 --> 01:47:58.099]  If I could have done this all over again, I always attempt, as hard as I can, to do what I say I'm going to do.
[01:47:59.249 --> 01:48:05.932]  And I agreed three or four months ago to be the keynote speaker at Talkers and didn't notice that Bilderberg was at that same time, didn't think.
[01:48:05.932 --> 01:48:11.915]  And it's important to talk to all the major radio CEOs and program directors because we're getting like three affiliates a week.
[01:48:11.915 --> 01:48:18.459]  I'm told the fact that I'm keynote speaker when it's usually Limbaugh or Hannity, we'll probably get like 100, 200 affiliates in the next couple of months from this.
[01:48:18.459 --> 01:48:19.539]  So it's important.
[01:48:19.539 --> 01:48:20.460]  But in my gut,
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:27.062]  If I could go back now, I wish that I would have pulled out of this talker's thing because I wish I was there.
[01:48:27.062 --> 01:48:29.283]  They're getting ready to march on Vilderberg.
[01:48:29.283 --> 01:48:36.366]  Watson and Aaron Dykes via video phone and regular phone are going to be with the Swiss parliamentarians as they march up.
[01:48:36.366 --> 01:48:37.787]  This is so off the chart.
[01:48:37.787 --> 01:48:39.488]  And Drudge report.
[01:48:39.488 --> 01:48:41.128]  Our report went live five minutes ago.
[01:48:41.128 --> 01:48:42.489]  Drudge is already linked to it.
[01:48:43.449 --> 01:48:49.711]  As the top story on the left-hand side, Swiss politicians to march on Bilderberg meeting, demand arrest of Kissinger.
[01:48:49.711 --> 01:48:52.331]  We actually have the video on our Justin TV.
[01:48:52.331 --> 01:48:55.432]  It's in the breaking news section of InfoWars.com.
[01:48:55.432 --> 01:48:56.152]  Breaking Bilderberg news.
[01:48:56.152 --> 01:49:03.854]  We're going to get those videos added to that of the Swiss member of parliament just 500 yards away from the hotel being interviewed.
[01:49:03.854 --> 01:49:06.315]  We have the video of it while he was on the phone with us.
[01:49:06.315 --> 01:49:07.475]  So people think this is a joke.
[01:49:07.995 --> 01:49:08.195]  I think?
[01:49:28.306 --> 01:49:30.767]  To the member of parliament saying we're being abused.
[01:49:30.767 --> 01:49:35.649]  And then the letter from parliament ordering the cops to back off and not let the East German security goons.
[01:49:35.649 --> 01:49:38.730]  That's who they hired, an actual East German company.
[01:49:38.730 --> 01:49:40.971]  They know how to do it, even though it's still East and West.
[01:49:40.971 --> 01:49:43.032]  It's the East German folks.
[01:49:43.032 --> 01:49:46.213]  The East Germans are bad overall, but they're security people.
[01:49:46.213 --> 01:49:49.054]  And they're telling them, you back off, you don't put your hands on people.
[01:49:49.054 --> 01:49:51.235]  This is not Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany.
[01:49:51.795 --> 01:49:54.337]  And it says, We Are Change, right in a letter in German.
[01:49:54.337 --> 01:49:57.059]  And the Parliament's saying, you back off, you understand?
[01:49:57.059 --> 01:50:04.225]  We Are Change now, with Parliament telling the police, you treat We Are Change real nice.
[01:50:04.225 --> 01:50:05.366]  What do you make of that, Bob?
[01:50:05.366 --> 01:50:06.407]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:50:06.407 --> 01:50:08.189]  This is Liberty Rising.
[01:50:08.909 --> 01:50:15.333]  I felt in my gut the other night when I made a video called Bilderberg, the fall of Bilderberg, that something magic was going to happen.
[01:50:15.333 --> 01:50:18.375]  And I think this is the beginning of the fall of Bilderberg.
[01:50:18.375 --> 01:50:20.056]  I got to tell folks, I got a spidey sense.
[01:50:20.056 --> 01:50:21.337]  I don't talk about it.
[01:50:21.337 --> 01:50:26.080]  And my spidey sense has just been beside itself right now, Bob.
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:32.485]  Well, I think, Alex, this could be the untoward event that really wasn't expected.
[01:50:32.485 --> 01:50:35.887]  That could be the catalyst that could bring this whole house of cards down.
[01:50:36.955 --> 01:50:45.618]  He could make a run on the Europeans, on Greece, and there could be tremendous ramifications.
[01:50:45.618 --> 01:50:50.460]  Hold on, I'm having, I'm having, I'm actually... See folks, drugs mimic natural endorphins.
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:53.361]  I mean, it's like I just injected heroin, cocaine, PCP.
[01:50:53.361 --> 01:50:54.642]  I'm feeling so good.
[01:50:54.642 --> 01:50:55.242]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:55.242 --> 01:50:55.502]  Hold on.
[01:50:57.051 --> 01:50:58.392]  Pile launch right here.
[01:50:58.392 --> 01:51:01.673]  Whoa, oh yeah, oh, oh yeah, oh.
[01:51:01.673 --> 01:51:07.476]  GCN listeners, why have you been hearing so much about Dermatol, the all-natural, all-purpose first aid spray?
[01:51:07.476 --> 01:51:11.598]  Because it's the must-have first aid product you need in your preparedness kit.
[01:51:11.598 --> 01:51:20.323]  Dermatol is made in America by Americans who know there's a more affordable, natural way to treat cuts, burns, bites, rashes, shingles, boils, and many other skin problems.
[01:51:20.563 --> 01:51:26.129]  Dermatol is gentle enough for diaper rash, powerful enough for bed sores, and harmless to the eyes and mouth.
[01:51:26.129 --> 01:51:28.872]  It's great for the whole family, even your family pets!

[01:54:22.396 --> 01:54:26.017]  Well, I just want to say I couldn't do this without the InfoWars listeners and supporters.
[01:54:26.017 --> 01:54:27.497]  You are the InfoWars.
[01:54:27.497 --> 01:54:33.118]  Black, white, Jewish, German, Chinese, old, young, Native American, everybody wants to be free.
[01:54:33.118 --> 01:54:35.379]  Swiss, Mexican, it doesn't matter.
[01:54:35.379 --> 01:54:39.180]  Let's get into liberty and freedom and say no to the corporate global government.
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:47.563]  You know, I've got to leave in the next hour, 15 minutes or so in, and the march is about to begin in the next 45 minutes or so.
[01:54:47.563 --> 01:54:52.646]  And Paul Watson and Aaron Dykes are going to be marching.
[01:54:52.646 --> 01:54:55.567]  Make sure they don't stay behind, because they need to be on the phone.
[01:54:55.567 --> 01:54:58.728]  I don't care how much noise there is, this is going to be real.
[01:54:58.728 --> 01:55:03.270]  And we'll probably be taking calls during that period, they'll get the number out, or we'll go to video of their phones cut out.
[01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:06.572]  It's going to be wild, live radio, but I've got to go catch a plane.
[01:55:07.012 --> 01:55:08.853]  And follow a previous commitment.
[01:55:08.853 --> 01:55:09.914]  We are red-linked.
[01:55:09.914 --> 01:55:12.996]  Top link, left-hand side, DrudgeReport.com.
[01:55:12.996 --> 01:55:16.059]  Again, folks, New York Times admits, more important than New York Times.
[01:55:16.059 --> 01:55:19.581]  I mean, that is the top of the media right there.
[01:55:19.581 --> 01:55:23.624]  Swiss politicians to march on Bilderberg meeting, demand arrest of Kissinger.
[01:55:23.624 --> 01:55:24.665]  The dam is breaking.
[01:55:25.806 --> 01:55:29.073]  And this is the best place to find it, dredgereport.com.
[01:55:29.073 --> 01:55:30.355]  Get that link, send it out to everyone.
[01:55:30.355 --> 01:55:30.956]  You can't miss it.
[01:55:30.956 --> 01:55:34.463]  It's red like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer's nose.
[01:55:34.463 --> 01:55:36.066]  Now there's a reason people are waking up.
[01:55:36.066 --> 01:55:37.329]  Everybody's got a spidey sense.
[01:55:38.137 --> 01:55:38.778]  The Sixth Sense.
[01:55:38.778 --> 01:55:39.458]  It's real.
[01:55:39.458 --> 01:55:45.745]  That's why thousands of studies have been done on snakes, rats, deer, caged animals.
[01:55:45.745 --> 01:55:55.975]  They've done tests where they know sometimes a day before, not just hours before a tornado, an earthquake, they know when storms are coming, when tornadoes are going to form beforehand.
[01:55:55.975 --> 01:55:59.979]  Birds know how to fly south for the winter and fly back north on magnetic lines.
[01:55:59.979 --> 01:56:01.301]  They don't know why, they just do it.
[01:56:03.513 --> 01:56:06.525]  Just like little boys act like little boys, little girls act like little girls.
[01:56:06.525 --> 01:56:07.368]  They're not taught that.
[01:56:07.368 --> 01:56:07.990]  They're humans.
[01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.673]  It's what's in us.
[01:56:09.841 --> 01:56:11.823]  And it's how we direct those instincts.
[01:56:11.823 --> 01:56:17.048]  And everybody's instincts, even people in the power structure, know everybody's in trouble.
[01:56:17.048 --> 01:56:27.599]  If we let these unhappy globalists do this and carry out their... Listen, Jim Tucker talked to his mole yesterday and they were going, yeah, we want a wider war in the Middle East to jack up oil prices and bankrupt everybody.
[01:56:27.599 --> 01:56:28.219]  And so what?
[01:56:28.219 --> 01:56:29.681]  There's too many of these people anyways.
[01:56:29.681 --> 01:56:30.662]  Let's reduce them.
[01:56:30.662 --> 01:56:33.465]  So it's not just... It's not they don't care about killing us.
[01:56:33.945 --> 01:56:37.186]  Bob Chapman, they enjoy it in their sickening view.
[01:56:37.186 --> 01:56:39.127]  They want to rid the earth of us.
[01:56:39.127 --> 01:56:41.488]  It's us or them, isn't it, Bob?
[01:56:41.488 --> 01:56:44.950]  It certainly is, and they are as depraved as you can get.
[01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:48.951]  There's no compunction whatsoever.
[01:56:48.951 --> 01:56:55.474]  They do whatever they feel like doing because they're arrogant and brazen, and they think that they're better than all of us.
[01:56:55.474 --> 01:56:56.915]  Well, I get news for them.
[01:56:56.915 --> 01:57:00.076]  We're every bit as smart as they are, and we're going to stop them.
[01:57:00.925 --> 01:57:05.106]  We've been talking about this for years over this network, and we are going to win.
[01:57:05.106 --> 01:57:09.427]  It may be very painful, maybe we'll get lucky, and it won't be.
[01:57:09.427 --> 01:57:13.388]  But you've got to plan on pain, and you've got to stick your neck out.
[01:57:13.388 --> 01:57:15.388]  You've got to start talking about these things.
[01:57:15.388 --> 01:57:20.330]  A hundred people, one of them's going to listen, but that's okay.
[01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:28.592]  You've got one more person who's now informed, who's listening to Alex and other programs and getting on the internet and finding out what's going on.
[01:57:28.592 --> 01:57:30.172]  This is a crusade, and we're going to win it.
[01:57:30.865 --> 01:57:34.966]  This is pure torture that I've got to go get on the plane and can't be here live.
[01:57:34.966 --> 01:57:38.727]  I'll be on my iPad on the iPhone app listening to it as I drive the airport.
[01:57:38.727 --> 01:57:42.447]  Then as I get my genitals grubbed, we'll see if they try that.
[01:57:42.447 --> 01:57:46.428]  But these are the people worldwide calling for the police state.
[01:57:46.428 --> 01:57:48.269]  And by the way, folks, you know I'm anti-drug.
[01:57:48.269 --> 01:57:53.490]  That was a analogy earlier about being high as a kite off the excitement.
[01:57:53.490 --> 01:57:59.251]  I am almost unable to talk right now in the anticipation of what's about to happen.
[01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:05.303]  And I understand we have no future if we don't beat these people.
[01:58:05.303 --> 01:58:10.706]  Every day I look at my kids and it makes me sad, but also enraged at these globalists.
[01:58:10.706 --> 01:58:13.308]  I mean, they are putting poisons in our food and water, the GMO.
[01:58:13.308 --> 01:58:14.689]  I got all their documents.
[01:58:14.689 --> 01:58:15.409]  I've published them.
[01:58:15.409 --> 01:58:17.531]  They're criminals and I want to beat them.
[01:58:18.271 --> 01:58:22.252]  I don't want gold, diamonds, palaces, power, helicopters, status.
[01:58:22.252 --> 01:58:23.373]  I could care less.
[01:58:23.373 --> 01:58:24.813]  I want freedom.
[01:58:24.813 --> 01:58:28.555]  And I have a mad desire to destroy the globalist.
[01:58:28.555 --> 01:58:32.096]  And that's just an instinct of a man to protect his family and his culture.
[01:58:32.096 --> 01:58:34.497]  And I know that's the instinct Bob Chapman has.
[01:58:34.497 --> 01:58:36.977]  We'll get Bob's take on what I just said straight ahead.
[01:58:36.977 --> 01:58:42.339]  And then, we take you live to Bilderberg.
[01:58:42.339 --> 01:58:44.040]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:56.111 --> 01:59:58.876]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.458 --> 02:00:10.301]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.301 --> 02:00:11.882]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.882 --> 02:00:13.423]  Well, so does he.

[02:00:17.625 --> 02:00:21.688]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.602 --> 02:00:33.904]  You know why you get excited when your football team wins and you feel that adrenaline rush?
[02:00:33.904 --> 02:00:37.606]  Because at a tribal level, you're seeing that as your warriors defeating the enemy.
[02:00:37.606 --> 02:00:42.309]  Because if your warriors don't defeat the enemy, the enemy's going to come, take your women and children, and kill you.
[02:00:42.309 --> 02:00:43.769]  And take them into slavery.
[02:00:43.769 --> 02:00:45.070]  So you have this, ugh!
[02:00:45.070 --> 02:00:48.052]  Well, see folks, I actually understand my instincts.
[02:00:48.052 --> 02:00:49.172]  I understand archetypes.
[02:00:49.172 --> 02:00:51.994]  And I understand this victory we're having is so huge.
[02:00:53.254 --> 02:00:57.177]  You'll want to stay with this giant breaking information coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:57.177 --> 02:00:58.718]  I'm going to announce it in the next segment.
[02:00:58.718 --> 02:01:00.300]  Something even bigger just happened.
[02:01:00.300 --> 02:01:02.241]  Let's go to Bob Chapman.
[02:01:02.241 --> 02:01:06.224]  Bob, I want to give people a general history of the Bilderberg Group from your research.
[02:01:06.224 --> 02:01:07.585]  Why are they the enemy?
[02:01:07.585 --> 02:01:09.587]  Why should we care their meeting in secret?
[02:01:09.587 --> 02:01:12.269]  Bob Chapman, for the last four minutes of this segment, you have the floor.
[02:01:12.269 --> 02:01:17.053]  Their history goes back a thousand years that we know of.
[02:01:18.124 --> 02:01:29.930]  Uh, the Bilderberger reading was first in Holland, uh, put on by the Queen and, uh, her father, um, Prince Barnard, uh, who happens to have been an SS officer.
[02:01:29.930 --> 02:01:35.052]  Uh, and, uh, that was at the Bilderberger Hotel, I believe.
[02:01:35.052 --> 02:01:38.654]  It was naive in 1952 or 1954.
[02:01:38.654 --> 02:01:43.916]  And each year they've evolved and had their, quote, secret readings, which are no longer secret.
[02:01:45.067 --> 02:01:55.510]  And, uh, you know, fellows like Jim Tucker, who I have known and known on for years, uh, we kind of followed the same general path.
[02:01:55.510 --> 02:01:58.531]  And, um, he's put a tremendous amount of work into this.
[02:01:58.531 --> 02:02:04.933]  Uh, I've been reporting for really a, a shorter time than he has.
[02:02:04.933 --> 02:02:09.555]  And, uh, and it must be, uh, because it is for me.
[02:02:10.750 --> 02:02:15.708]  A great, uh, great, uh, feeling to see this happen.
[02:02:15.708 --> 02:02:16.792]  I know you, Alex, are
[02:02:17.532 --> 02:02:24.539]  Uh, Giddy, uh, over the success, uh, that these people have brought us by, uh, pushing the things too far.
[02:02:24.539 --> 02:02:28.182]  It's like watching one of their main capital ships blow up.
[02:02:28.182 --> 02:02:32.046]  Folks, politically, this, they're, they are being exposed as the criminals they are.
[02:02:32.046 --> 02:02:33.067]  We're pulling them down.
[02:02:33.067 --> 02:02:39.693]  They're no longer these gods up on Mount Olympus with their little queen, you know, uh, crowns to impress us.
[02:02:39.693 --> 02:02:41.354]  This is the spirit of 1776 and I just watched
[02:02:43.436 --> 02:02:50.039]  One of their main capital ships, this is very embarrassing for them, blow up, and every month we gain more momentum on them.
[02:02:50.039 --> 02:02:54.521]  I mean, do you agree this is like the battleship Yamamoto blowing up?
[02:02:56.135 --> 02:02:58.376]  A seminal event, there's no question.
[02:02:58.376 --> 02:03:01.577]  And you've got all these other small events going on.
[02:03:01.577 --> 02:03:09.419]  The arguments that are going on, the Dominic Strauss-Kahn episode within, we'll call them the Bilderberger Group.
[02:03:09.419 --> 02:03:11.760]  There's dissension within their own work.
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:13.480]  He wanted to decide with China!
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:16.641]  He wanted to decide with China and Europe teaming up with them.
[02:03:16.641 --> 02:03:22.143]  This may be one of the most important Bilderbergs ever, where you've got the Chi-Coms, who have never been there,
[02:03:23.123 --> 02:03:24.204]  It's usually only Europeans.
[02:03:24.204 --> 02:03:25.786]  A few Arabs might be let in.
[02:03:25.786 --> 02:03:34.372]  I mean, this is off the charts to have the Americans and the Europeans allowing a top government minister and their top economic advisor into there.
[02:03:34.372 --> 02:03:37.014]  What does that signify, Bob?
[02:03:37.014 --> 02:03:40.056]  It signifies that they have to be included.
[02:03:40.056 --> 02:03:46.962]  The Europeans, at least some of them, want to work with the Chinese in a very positive way.
[02:03:46.962 --> 02:03:48.443]  The Americans really don't want to.
[02:03:49.016 --> 02:03:52.497]  And they're in debt to them, which makes it even worse.
[02:03:52.497 --> 02:03:55.998]  And then the Chinese are coming out and saying, you know, America's broke.
[02:03:55.998 --> 02:03:56.678]  They're bankrupt.
[02:03:56.678 --> 02:03:59.518]  They're not going to service their debt.
[02:03:59.518 --> 02:04:00.559]  And the Chinese are right.
[02:04:00.559 --> 02:04:03.879]  I mean, this is about truth.
[02:04:03.879 --> 02:04:07.260]  And that's what they're saying.
[02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:10.081]  We opened the door for them, and they came in.
[02:04:10.081 --> 02:04:14.862]  They knew that there would be a price that they'd have to pay in order to
[02:04:15.814 --> 02:04:30.704]  Yeah, the globalists thought they were co-opting the Chinese, but the Chinese are long-term players.
[02:04:30.704 --> 02:04:33.306]  They're going to find out the opposite.
[02:04:33.306 --> 02:04:35.628]  And that's a very, very good point.
[02:04:35.628 --> 02:04:37.509]  Long-term players.
[02:04:37.509 --> 02:04:40.091]  They are the ones that always win.
[02:04:40.091 --> 02:04:44.674]  And Washington and London have been, at least in the last
[02:04:45.775 --> 02:04:46.597]  10 or 15 years.
[02:04:46.597 --> 02:04:47.378]  Short-term players.
[02:04:56.977 --> 02:04:58.017]  Have a great trip.
[02:04:58.017 --> 02:04:58.737]  Bye-bye, Alex.
[02:04:58.737 --> 02:04:59.498]  Bob, you're great.
[02:04:59.498 --> 02:05:01.038]  I can hear his voice cracking so excited.
[02:05:01.038 --> 02:05:04.939]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:05:04.939 --> 02:05:06.199]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:06.199 --> 02:05:09.920]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:12.361]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.361 --> 02:05:18.222]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:18.222 --> 02:05:24.464]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:24.884 --> 02:05:30.865]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:30.865 --> 02:05:35.046]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:35.046 --> 02:05:39.327]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:39.327 --> 02:05:45.269]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.269 --> 02:05:48.829]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.829 --> 02:05:50.810]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.810 --> 02:05:51.250]  It's here.

[02:06:07.741 --> 02:06:12.884]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:12.884 --> 02:06:19.609]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[02:06:30.097 --> 02:06:34.678]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:06:34.678 --> 02:06:38.519]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:06:38.519 --> 02:06:39.759]  Others don't.
[02:06:39.759 --> 02:06:41.900]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:43.680]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[02:07:00.319 --> 02:07:04.882]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:04.882 --> 02:07:05.782]  Number 1.
[02:07:05.782 --> 02:07:09.205]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.205 --> 02:07:10.065]  Number 2.
[02:07:10.065 --> 02:07:14.968]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:14.968 --> 02:07:15.709]  It's true.
[02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:20.572]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.572 --> 02:07:21.412]  Number 3.
[02:07:21.412 --> 02:07:24.995]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:24.995 --> 02:07:28.697]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:28.897 --> 02:07:29.698]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.698 --> 02:07:32.460]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.460 --> 02:07:36.143]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.143 --> 02:07:36.924]  Number 5.
[02:07:36.924 --> 02:07:41.068]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.068 --> 02:07:45.832]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.112 --> 02:07:50.295]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.295 --> 02:07:52.077]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:52.077 --> 02:07:54.318]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:54.318 --> 02:07:56.840]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:56.840 --> 02:07:58.041]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:58.041 --> 02:07:59.142]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:20.589 --> 02:08:29.573]  Okay, we have a member of Parliament, Lucas Ryman, they're waiting for Dominic Betting, who's the Ron Paul of Switzerland, to arrive with another member of Parliament.
[02:08:29.573 --> 02:08:33.714]  Betting has said, and we've talked to folks that have talked to him, that he is going to march on that.
[02:08:33.714 --> 02:08:36.015]  And when we talk to Lucas Ryman, he's aware of that.
[02:08:36.015 --> 02:08:37.156]  They're going to go look for him now.
[02:08:37.156 --> 02:08:39.637]  He's supposed to be there, but they have to drive through the mountains to get there.
[02:08:39.637 --> 02:08:43.538]  The word is the police in the past have shut down highways and trains.
[02:08:43.538 --> 02:08:45.039]  We don't know if he's going to be able to
[02:08:45.179 --> 02:08:46.940]  I mean, they're desperate to stop what's about to happen.
[02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:47.280]  Doesn't matter.
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:50.623]  The big protest is tomorrow, Saturday, high noon.
[02:08:50.623 --> 02:08:51.784]  So it's just ongoing.
[02:08:51.784 --> 02:08:52.624]  It goes through Sunday.
[02:08:52.624 --> 02:08:53.845]  It's on.
[02:08:53.845 --> 02:09:00.730]  But Paul Watson, the police chief of the local state, or the town, came and visited with you guys there.
[02:09:00.730 --> 02:09:03.312]  And you've got breaking news of what the police chief told you.
[02:09:04.622 --> 02:09:05.803]  Yeah, that's correct, Alex.
[02:09:05.803 --> 02:09:16.910]  We were speaking again to Dominic, and we are here in Switzerland, and he said that the Chief of Police over the whole Bilderberg security operation actually visited this event that we're at now.
[02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:19.392]  It's shortly up the hill from the Bilderberg Hotel.
[02:09:19.392 --> 02:09:25.176]  It's a speaking event with music and interviews, and the Chief of Police visited.
[02:09:25.176 --> 02:09:28.438]  He's now left, but he said he stands with us.
[02:09:28.438 --> 02:09:34.542]  He supports our message against the Bilderberg group, and he was sending that message that he supports us against
[02:09:34.862 --> 02:09:40.606]  All right, we're going to talk to him in just a moment, then he's leaving to go find Dominique Betting.
[02:09:40.606 --> 02:09:43.688]  But whatever you do, stay with the members of Parliament.
[02:09:43.688 --> 02:09:45.029]  At least, I'm told, of the three.
[02:09:45.029 --> 02:09:46.270]  Two are going to go up.
[02:09:46.270 --> 02:09:51.493]  We need to get that on tape and document this and see what happens.
[02:09:51.493 --> 02:09:52.574]  But get out there.
[02:09:52.574 --> 02:09:53.634]  Don't miss this.
[02:09:53.634 --> 02:09:54.835]  Go ahead and do a good job.
[02:09:54.835 --> 02:09:58.658]  Hand the phone over to Lucas
[02:09:59.478 --> 02:09:59.618]  Hello?
[02:10:30.049 --> 02:10:31.490]  I have no idea.
[02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:40.156]  They told me he's in the train between Zurich and here, and he should be here in one, one and a half hour, but I'm not sure about that.
[02:10:40.156 --> 02:10:48.402]  Now, sir, we saw a lot of years during Davos, they will shut trains down to completely to block protesters getting there.
[02:10:48.402 --> 02:10:52.425]  Would it be unprecedented for them to try to block the Member of Parliament getting there?
[02:10:54.412 --> 02:11:09.466]  I've heard that yesterday night a member of the European Parliament from Italy tried to get into the Bilderberg conference to get to the Socrata Hotel and they pushed him down, his nose was bleeding.
[02:11:11.406 --> 02:11:11.867]  What?
[02:11:11.867 --> 02:11:12.947]  Wait, wait, wait.
[02:11:12.947 --> 02:11:14.067]  EU Parliament?
[02:11:14.067 --> 02:11:17.728]  I mean, that's the ministers from the countries that are part of the EU.
[02:11:17.728 --> 02:11:19.389]  What, is that in the Swiss papers?
[02:11:19.389 --> 02:11:23.150]  Because I know that prominent Italian, I forget his name, has spoken out against Bilderberg.
[02:11:23.150 --> 02:11:23.930]  He's an older gentleman.
[02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:25.270]  We'll look up his name.
[02:11:25.270 --> 02:11:31.792]  Guys, if you search right now, Italian member of EU Parliament speaks out against Bilderberg.
[02:11:31.792 --> 02:11:32.832]  It'll pull him up.
[02:11:32.832 --> 02:11:34.013]  Do you have his name, sir?
[02:11:34.013 --> 02:11:34.833]  You just learned this?
[02:11:36.685 --> 02:11:45.490]  I don't know his name, I don't have internet here, but in the Swiss online newspapers his name is written now.
[02:11:45.490 --> 02:11:57.096]  He's from the Party League of the North in Italy.
[02:11:57.096 --> 02:12:00.678]  You know what, we'll go to Dominic in a moment if he can answer the questions for us.
[02:12:00.678 --> 02:12:02.498]  Jaron, I couldn't hear through the window if you want to come tell me.
[02:12:02.498 --> 02:12:04.139]  That would be great, yes.
[02:12:06.956 --> 02:12:08.997]  Mario Borghosi?
[02:12:08.997 --> 02:12:11.018]  Mario Borghosi, yes.
[02:12:11.018 --> 02:12:13.339]  Mario Borghosi.
[02:12:13.339 --> 02:12:22.443]  So Swiss.info is reporting that Mario Borghosi, member of the EU Parliament, was shoved into the ground and his nose bloodied?
[02:12:22.443 --> 02:12:23.224]  It's on!
[02:12:23.224 --> 02:12:25.125]  That's what's the great part about InfoWars.
[02:12:25.125 --> 02:12:28.446]  Once they get physical, then everybody starts really getting how serious it is.
[02:12:28.446 --> 02:12:30.047]  Tell us what the Swiss News is reporting.
[02:12:33.804 --> 02:12:47.592]  All the Swiss news are writing that these parliamentarians from the European Parliament tried to get into the Hotel Sofretta.
[02:12:57.924 --> 02:12:59.184]  Sensational!
[02:12:59.184 --> 02:13:02.586]  That's going to really blow up in the Bilderberg group's face.
[02:13:02.586 --> 02:13:04.627]  The Tree of Liberty, you know it waters it.
[02:13:04.627 --> 02:13:08.168]  Oh my gosh, you're saying this is all over the Swiss News, we'll get it translated.
[02:13:08.168 --> 02:13:14.711]  This is showing how we didn't even know this happened last night and we're just now learning this is off the charts.
[02:13:15.171 --> 02:13:16.972]  We don't know yet.
[02:13:16.972 --> 02:13:21.935]  We tried to get more information about that, but we also said we should try to get Swiss Parliamentarians to get in.
[02:13:42.315 --> 02:13:57.735]  We've also got a bunch of reporters that have told us off-air, multiple reporters, that some of the Bilderbergs appear to be evacuating, especially that they may be evacuating the women because of the march on Bilderberg tomorrow, and that there's quite a few helicopters, and that the Bilderbergs may be fleeing.
[02:14:02.990 --> 02:14:03.731]  Yeah, it's true.
[02:14:30.186 --> 02:14:32.789]  I am beside myself right now, sir.
[02:14:32.789 --> 02:14:34.491]  We're gonna take my car to the airport.
[02:14:34.491 --> 02:14:35.873]  We're taking mine.
[02:14:35.873 --> 02:14:37.655]  Okay, sir, anything else you can tell us?
[02:14:37.655 --> 02:14:40.077]  What a bombshell you just dropped on us!
[02:14:40.077 --> 02:14:44.903]  The EU Parliament marched and was bloodied by their masters!
[02:14:44.903 --> 02:14:46.825]  Anything else, Member of Parliament from Switzerland?
[02:14:51.839 --> 02:14:52.939]  I didn't understand that now.
[02:14:52.939 --> 02:14:54.260]  I will do that and you pay me the hospital.
[02:15:21.718 --> 02:15:22.939]  Yeah, that's true, that's true, that's true.
[02:15:44.301 --> 02:15:52.863]  When my two other friends from my party, the other members from the Swiss Parliament will arrive here, I will talk to them and then we will try to do that.
[02:15:52.863 --> 02:15:56.925]  But I'm not sure if that will be good.
[02:15:56.925 --> 02:15:58.685]  Well, no, don't let this intimidation work.
[02:15:58.685 --> 02:16:01.966]  Dominique Betting, your leader, has already said he's going to do it on record.
[02:16:01.966 --> 02:16:02.926]  So you're going.
[02:16:02.926 --> 02:16:03.386]  OK.
[02:16:03.386 --> 02:16:04.087]  You're committed.
[02:16:04.087 --> 02:16:04.767]  You're a man.
[02:16:04.767 --> 02:16:06.447]  You're a red-blooded liberty lover.
[02:16:06.447 --> 02:16:07.308]  You haven't done anything wrong.
[02:16:07.308 --> 02:16:07.768]  You're going to go.
[02:16:07.768 --> 02:16:08.528]  That's true, that's true.
[02:16:08.528 --> 02:16:10.989]  Look, I'll guarantee you the EU members tried to force their way in.
[02:16:10.989 --> 02:16:12.069]  Just don't force your way in.
[02:16:13.291 --> 02:16:14.732]  You're right, you're right.
[02:16:14.732 --> 02:16:16.674]  I will follow Dominique Betting.
[02:16:16.674 --> 02:16:17.495]  We do that together.
[02:16:34.394 --> 02:16:37.296]  Okay, thanks to you, and when you say that, we do that.
[02:16:37.296 --> 02:16:38.076]  We listen to you.
[02:16:38.076 --> 02:16:40.137]  Alright, you are just unbelievable.
[02:16:40.137 --> 02:16:43.099]  You are incredible.
[02:16:43.099 --> 02:16:45.180]  Woo, yeah!
[02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:54.326]  Let me give you a war growl out there and I'll just send some love to you in Switzerland.
[02:16:54.326 --> 02:16:54.926]  Thank you, sir.
[02:16:54.926 --> 02:16:57.207]  Please give the phone to Paul Watson.
[02:16:57.207 --> 02:16:58.108]  Okay, goodbye.
[02:16:58.108 --> 02:17:01.510]  I am ready!
[02:17:01.510 --> 02:17:02.631]  Man, I wish I was there.
[02:17:03.795 --> 02:17:05.636]  Oh, this is history.
[02:17:05.636 --> 02:17:07.656]  Paul, look, I'm throwing the baton to you.
[02:17:07.656 --> 02:17:09.117]  We're going to break in three minutes.
[02:17:09.117 --> 02:17:10.017]  You stay on them.
[02:17:10.017 --> 02:17:11.437]  You heard him.
[02:17:11.437 --> 02:17:13.958]  Dominique Betting, who's held up in the train, he's going.
[02:17:13.958 --> 02:17:14.998]  He's already on record.
[02:17:14.998 --> 02:17:17.719]  The other guys, the gauntlets down, they're going.
[02:17:17.719 --> 02:17:19.280]  I said, are you going to let them break in the nose?
[02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:20.560]  Going to intimidate you?
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:21.861]  We've now confirmed Watson.
[02:17:21.861 --> 02:17:23.601]  I don't care how much background noise.
[02:17:23.601 --> 02:17:24.761]  You've got the floor.
[02:17:24.761 --> 02:17:26.182]  Go into overdrive if it's needed.
[02:17:26.502 --> 02:17:27.263]  I'm skybound.
[02:17:27.263 --> 02:17:28.724]  Everybody pray for the people there.
[02:17:28.724 --> 02:17:29.365]  Big protest.
[02:17:29.365 --> 02:17:30.266]  High noon tomorrow.
[02:17:30.266 --> 02:17:31.347]  Paul, we love you.
[02:17:31.347 --> 02:17:32.308]  You've got the baton.
[02:17:32.308 --> 02:17:34.810]  Paul Watson, Aaron Dykes, InfoWars.com.
[02:17:34.810 --> 02:17:36.672]  We've got to go update our article that's on drugs.
[02:17:36.672 --> 02:17:38.714]  They've already assaulted members of Parliament.
[02:17:38.714 --> 02:17:40.516]  We're breaking the Berlin Wall of Info.
[02:17:40.516 --> 02:17:41.817]  We're getting it out to everybody.
[02:17:41.817 --> 02:17:42.978]  God bless you all.
[02:17:42.978 --> 02:17:43.659]  Stay with us.
[02:17:43.659 --> 02:17:44.179]  Paul Watson.
[02:17:46.277 --> 02:17:47.699]  Good to be on the air, Alex.
[02:17:47.699 --> 02:17:55.728]  Yeah, we've basically got eyewitnesses to all of this and we'll try and get them on the air as and when possible, but it's pretty hectic as you can tell.
[02:17:55.728 --> 02:18:04.319]  Yeah, the EU member of parliament attempted to enter the Bilderberg Hotel and according to eyewitnesses he was shoved to the ground and
[02:18:04.899 --> 02:18:06.322]  Bloody his nose.
[02:18:06.322 --> 02:18:14.535]  One even said that they broke his nose and his name was Mario Orgazio and that is already in, I believe, The Guardian.
[02:18:14.535 --> 02:18:19.602]  I think it's Charlie Skelton but it might be somebody else in The Guardian that's reported that.
[02:18:20.924 --> 02:18:37.152]  Also just literally two minutes ago we were talking to Alex from Info Creek and he was saying that there was a standoff down at the hotel where some protesters tried to go down because there's an area above the police tape which is on a hill
[02:18:37.692 --> 02:18:37.812]  So, um,
[02:19:07.836 --> 02:19:13.921]  We saw this little group trying to walk towards the hotel.
[02:19:13.921 --> 02:19:17.524]  They walked from top down to Grassy Hill.
[02:19:17.524 --> 02:19:20.006]  The police confirmed to us it's private.
[02:19:20.006 --> 02:19:21.567]  We're not supposed to be there.
[02:19:21.567 --> 02:19:23.029]  We're not allowed to be there.
[02:19:23.029 --> 02:19:25.691]  And two of these guys, they wore bright yellow vests.
[02:19:26.550 --> 02:19:28.632]  So they made a point to be seen.
[02:19:28.632 --> 02:19:29.933]  They were not sneaking in.
[02:19:29.933 --> 02:19:31.835]  They were walking right up there.
[02:19:31.835 --> 02:19:35.819]  And there's this one security checkpoint with police and a police dog.
[02:19:35.819 --> 02:19:40.983]  And you saw them gathering their troops and kind of not really knowing what to do.
[02:19:40.983 --> 02:19:43.025]  And they brought the dogs.
[02:19:43.025 --> 02:19:46.448]  And so it's one of my guys shooting all of this.
[02:19:46.448 --> 02:19:47.749]  I got most of it.
[02:19:49.451 --> 02:19:56.620]  I don't want to go into more details because there could be something big happening.
[02:19:56.620 --> 02:19:59.223]  I don't want to give anything away and warn anybody.
[02:20:02.295 --> 02:20:05.677]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:20:05.677 --> 02:20:13.861]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[02:20:13.861 --> 02:20:19.183]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[02:20:19.183 --> 02:20:22.165]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.

[02:20:30.649 --> 02:20:31.910]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:36.473]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:20:36.473 --> 02:20:42.277]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:20:42.277 --> 02:20:45.919]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:45.919 --> 02:20:48.641]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:48.641 --> 02:20:53.704]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:20:53.704 --> 02:20:53.945]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:53.945 --> 02:20:55.346]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.

[02:21:03.072 --> 02:21:05.435]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:05.435 --> 02:21:08.659]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:08.659 --> 02:21:13.766]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:13.766 --> 02:21:17.951]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.271 --> 02:21:20.613]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:20.613 --> 02:21:23.154]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.154 --> 02:21:26.416]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.416 --> 02:21:34.001]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.335 --> 02:21:39.720]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:42.063]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:42.063 --> 02:21:46.287]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.287 --> 02:21:47.348]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.348 --> 02:21:48.689]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:48.689 --> 02:21:50.190]  Invisible Empire.

[02:24:15.213 --> 02:24:21.178]  We're live, it's the Alex Jones Show, broadcasting from San Marit, Switzerland.
[02:24:21.178 --> 02:24:29.586]  We're just up the hill from the Bilderberg Hotel, the Sovretta, looking out across the beautiful mountains of San Marit.
[02:24:29.586 --> 02:24:33.809]  And we've literally got breaking bombshell after bombshell story.
[02:24:33.809 --> 02:24:39.254]  You heard earlier about the EU Member of Parliament who actually tried to enter the
[02:24:39.694 --> 02:25:03.094]  Yeah, and we're going to go to Dominic of We Are Change Switzerland now to discuss this matter of the EU Member of Parliament who tried to enter the Bilderberg Hotel at the Savretta and was roughed up by the police.
[02:25:03.928 --> 02:25:12.471]  Dominic, can you just explain to us who the EU Member of Parliament was and what happened at the Bilderberg Hotel?
[02:25:12.471 --> 02:25:25.875]  It was just the news on the mainstream that Mario Borghese, the one who invited Daniel Esterling to the European Parliament, speak about the Bilderberg agenda a year ago.
[02:25:26.860 --> 02:25:40.011]  He was coming up to the Sorretta Hotel and he was smashed by cops and his nose was bleeding, the newspapers say, but I cannot get the right source.
[02:25:40.011 --> 02:25:44.555]  I cannot tell you if it's true or not, but this is what the media say.
[02:25:46.661 --> 02:25:49.585]  Thank you, that was Dominic from We Are Change, Switzerland.
[02:25:49.585 --> 02:26:02.604]  Yeah, so basically we've got several eyewitnesses that are saying that this EU Member of Parliament tried to enter the building, he presented his credentials, but then he was met with significant resistance from the police there guarding the hotel building.
[02:26:04.295 --> 02:26:16.510]  And we're going to move on now and talk to Aaron Dykes who's just been out trying to gather up more individuals from this hectic event here just up the hill from the Bilderberg Hotel.
[02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:23.278]  So we're going to go live now to Aaron Dykes to discuss the latest developments here at the scene of the Infowar.
[02:26:25.379 --> 02:26:29.261]  Hello, this is Aaron Dykes here again reporting live from St.
[02:26:29.261 --> 02:26:30.782]  Moritz, Switzerland.
[02:26:30.782 --> 02:26:39.347]  And I'm totally outraged at the way they've beat back the press, the fact that they've actually bloodied the nose of a European Parliament member.
[02:26:39.347 --> 02:26:48.233]  But it's going to backfire on the Bilderberg Group because when a tyranny shows its tyranny and starts to use violence against non-violent people, you're going to get the Gandhi effect.
[02:26:48.233 --> 02:26:52.055]  You're going to get the blatant show of force.
[02:26:52.615 --> 02:26:53.636]  I don't know.
[02:27:12.483 --> 02:27:13.624]  We're good to go.
[02:27:35.026 --> 02:27:35.767]  We're good to go.
[02:27:54.129 --> 02:28:08.033]  Other news, in the United States, two of the biggest politicians, Hillary Clinton and Texas Governor Rick Perry, though they are not attending here at the Bilderberg Group, they are on the part of Rick Perry.
[02:28:08.033 --> 02:28:11.174]  He's announced that he's most likely going to run for president.
[02:28:11.174 --> 02:28:15.155]  Right now, they're kind of floating media statements, gathering buzz.
[02:28:15.715 --> 02:28:18.596]  The Newt Gingrich campaign has totally fallen flat.
[02:28:18.596 --> 02:28:29.978]  It gained no traction at all, partly because of him speaking out against Representative Ryan's budget, and also just the fact that he's a well-known shill for the globalist movements.
[02:28:29.978 --> 02:28:34.839]  Although he's not been friendly with the Bilderberg Group, he's still quite in lockstep with their agenda.
[02:28:34.839 --> 02:28:36.279]  He's been for carbon taxes.
[02:28:36.279 --> 02:28:38.459]  All that is work against Newt Gingrich.
[02:28:38.459 --> 02:28:42.840]  And so we've seen his very high-powered political advisors
[02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:48.163]  Leaving his campaign and getting ready to get behind Texas Governor Rick Perry.
[02:28:48.163 --> 02:28:58.891]  And that's very important because in 2007, Rick Perry flew over to Istanbul, joined the Bilderberg Group, met with them, and he has effectively been pre-selected.
[02:28:58.891 --> 02:29:05.656]  He's been vetted as a good potential presidential candidate, and he's most likely going to be running in 2012.
[02:29:05.656 --> 02:29:06.476]  That's further important.
[02:29:10.456 --> 02:29:19.964]  That's further important because Rick Perry has really put on airs of being a grassroots conservative, of being a sort of Tea Party-esque version of his statements about succession.
[02:29:19.964 --> 02:29:21.586]  So get ready to see him be a big...
[02:29:23.250 --> 02:29:24.550]  We'll be back after the break.
[02:29:51.226 --> 02:29:55.147]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.147 --> 02:30:01.988]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.988 --> 02:30:03.709]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:03.709 --> 02:30:09.030]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:10.550]  Saving means to make money.
[02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:19.332]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:30:20.072 --> 02:30:27.617]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:30:27.617 --> 02:30:35.622]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:30:35.622 --> 02:30:40.845]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:30:51.239 --> 02:30:53.503]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:31:01.798 --> 02:31:05.822]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:05.822 --> 02:31:09.065]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:09.065 --> 02:31:13.869]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:13.869 --> 02:31:20.255]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:20.255 --> 02:31:22.498]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:31:23.038 --> 02:31:23.338]  Tim Geithner?
[02:31:23.338 --> 02:31:23.839]  Bernanke?
[02:31:23.839 --> 02:31:24.419]  They're arsonists!
[02:31:24.419 --> 02:31:25.180]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:25.180 --> 02:31:27.301]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:41.932 --> 02:31:44.073]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:44.073 --> 02:31:49.216]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:31:49.216 --> 02:31:58.321]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:32:00.478 --> 02:32:05.883]  You've heard Alex Jones talk about eFoods Direct and their highly nutritious, long-term, storable food.
[02:32:05.883 --> 02:32:07.364]  Believe me, it tastes great.
[02:32:07.364 --> 02:32:11.748]  Order any three of their qualified packs and you'll receive the fourth absolutely free.
[02:32:11.748 --> 02:32:14.450]  Let's say you order three of their one-week responder kits.
[02:32:14.450 --> 02:32:15.992]  You'll get the fourth week free.
[02:32:15.992 --> 02:32:19.174]  That's a $75 savings and a one-month supply.
[02:32:19.174 --> 02:32:20.295]  Are you kidding me?
[02:32:20.295 --> 02:32:26.361]  For the cost of one greasy, fast-food, super-sized combo lunch, you can eat three hearty, delicious meals.
[02:32:26.801 --> 02:32:30.143]  And this offer is good for any of their quick fix supplies.
[02:32:30.143 --> 02:32:31.624]  This offer ends on June 22nd.
[02:32:56.721 --> 02:33:02.385]  Well, you were sleeping They came and took it all away
[02:33:11.954 --> 02:33:13.615]  We are back at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:13.615 --> 02:33:17.098]  This is Aaron Dykes reporting live from St.
[02:33:17.098 --> 02:33:18.600]  Moritz, Switzerland.
[02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:28.828]  We have a rare opportunity today because there are literally more than 100 activists here at a live speaking event, which is in all German, which is why we're not covering it directly.
[02:33:28.828 --> 02:33:32.091]  We've had members of the Swiss Parliament.
[02:33:32.091 --> 02:33:36.434]  Perhaps we're expecting another arrival of a Swiss Parliament member, Dominik Bedeck,
[02:33:38.696 --> 02:33:38.977]  I think so.
[02:33:58.676 --> 02:34:01.859]  Was made, if you will, by Karl Rove back in the mid-80s.
[02:34:01.859 --> 02:34:03.541]  He used to be a Democrat.
[02:34:03.541 --> 02:34:09.266]  Karl Rove convinced him, along with people like Senator Phil Graham, to flip to Republican.
[02:34:09.266 --> 02:34:13.550]  And he only has gained in power and acumen since.
[02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:16.673]  Rick Perry is now the longest-serving Texas governor.
[02:34:16.673 --> 02:34:23.520]  Also, Hillary Clinton has announced today, it's been on the top of the Trudge Report, the biggest alternative news website anywhere in the world,
[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:24.661]  We're good to go.
[02:34:45.138 --> 02:34:46.859]  We're good to go.
[02:35:06.187 --> 02:35:12.893]  Not to accept the EU currency, not to join the European Union to keep their sovereignty, and why not?
[02:35:12.893 --> 02:35:16.216]  They have one of the highest living standards anywhere in the world.
[02:35:16.216 --> 02:35:18.478]  So we should stand with the Switzerland people.
[02:35:18.478 --> 02:35:24.784]  There's a really great We Are Change activist group here on the ground in Switzerland from all the different major cities.
[02:35:24.784 --> 02:35:29.288]  Really incredible, even though they have some of the big globalist banks like the Bank of International Settlement.
[02:35:30.008 --> 02:35:33.431]  But it would be really interesting if Hillary took the World Bank position.
[02:35:33.431 --> 02:35:41.476]  Of course, the past several World Bank heads have all been Bilderberg attendees, most of them perennial, most of them every single year.
[02:35:41.476 --> 02:35:48.441]  That includes James Wolfensohn, a multi-generational servant of the Rothschild family.
[02:35:48.441 --> 02:35:53.685]  It includes neocon Paul Wolfowitz, who had his own World Bank scandal and had to step down a few.
[02:35:54.445 --> 02:35:59.787]  Years ago, when they introduced Robert Zoellick, also, of course, a big globalist minion.
[02:35:59.787 --> 02:36:04.908]  Now, if Hillary Clinton were to take the position, that would be key.
[02:36:04.908 --> 02:36:07.769]  In other news, we have received the list.
[02:36:07.769 --> 02:36:08.949]  It was leaked earlier today.
[02:36:08.949 --> 02:36:10.730]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:36:10.730 --> 02:36:14.531]  It's been on DrudgeReport.com as one of the top links.
[02:36:14.531 --> 02:36:23.273]  And we know one part of their agenda is, of course, to perpetuate the war in Libya as they look to other regions in the Middle East.
[02:36:23.833 --> 02:36:25.675]  That's been part of their long-term plan.
[02:36:25.675 --> 02:36:44.688]  Of course, we've just witnessed the Arab Spring with protests, violent protests, crackdowns, all kinds of shifting geopolitical acts of significance in Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, the different parts of the peninsula there.
[02:36:44.688 --> 02:36:50.832]  And we know from last year, in 2010, they leaked on the official Bilderberg meeting site that
[02:36:51.641 --> 02:37:06.705]  There was a discussion from Obama to the, I don't have it in front of me, I don't have the exact words, but it was about from Obama to the path to the Iranian revolution using new social media, including Twitter and other aspects.
[02:37:06.705 --> 02:37:08.706]  And we know there's been meetings in the U.S.
[02:37:08.706 --> 02:37:12.687]  propping up some of the revolutionaries in that area of the world.
[02:37:12.687 --> 02:37:19.089]  And coinciding with that, we really have a powerhouse of the internet empire here at the meeting.
[02:37:21.155 --> 02:37:28.300]  Among them, excuse me one moment while I consult the list.
[02:37:28.300 --> 02:37:32.782]  We have the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes.
[02:37:32.782 --> 02:37:36.825]  We have also Craig Mundy of Microsoft.
[02:37:36.825 --> 02:37:40.487]  There's also the Bilderberg steering member Peter Thiel.
[02:37:40.487 --> 02:37:42.028]  He's the PayPal executive.
[02:37:42.028 --> 02:37:46.271]  He's also a big investor in Facebook.
[02:37:46.271 --> 02:37:49.112]  Actually, quite interestingly, he also endorsed Ron Paul in 2007.
[02:37:50.773 --> 02:37:53.854]  He's a bit of a libertarian, but also a hedge fund manager.
[02:37:53.854 --> 02:38:02.597]  And obviously they're trying to control the online dominion, and as well as influence all these social revolutions, particularly in the Middle East.
[02:38:02.597 --> 02:38:08.098]  So that's another area to watch as we get more information out of the 2011 meeting.
[02:38:08.098 --> 02:38:13.900]  Of course, down on the ground we've seen an incredible police response crackdown.
[02:38:13.900 --> 02:38:16.981]  We've just received reports that they've challenged protesters.
[02:38:17.842 --> 02:38:25.008]  On the line a few minutes ago, reports last night that a member of the Italian EU Parliament tried to enter the meeting.
[02:38:25.008 --> 02:38:27.691]  He was pushed down and his nose was bloodied.
[02:38:27.691 --> 02:38:30.273]  So that's just incredible tyranny.
[02:38:30.273 --> 02:38:34.477]  And I think Bilderberg's going to see a Gandhi-like response.
[02:38:34.477 --> 02:38:37.680]  But moving on, we have sitting next to me Luke Rudowsky.
[02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:42.704]  He's the founder of We Are Change and has been an incredible activist for the past several years.
[02:38:43.605 --> 02:38:50.330]  And he, of course, has also, as a part of that, been covering Bilderberg for, what is it, Luke, the past three or the past four years?
[02:38:50.330 --> 02:38:51.271]  Too many years.
[02:38:51.271 --> 02:38:52.232]  Too many years now.
[02:38:52.232 --> 02:38:55.654]  Yeah, we're all deep in the trenches at this point.
[02:38:55.654 --> 02:39:05.602]  So I'm going to pass the phone to you, Luke, and tell us some of your observations here, and what do you expect to see as the outcome from Bilderberg, not only this year, but in the future, as just incredible.
[02:39:06.863 --> 02:39:22.795]  I think it's very amazing to see each year how much the media coverage of this event gets bigger and bigger every year we go on.
[02:39:22.795 --> 02:39:30.821]  And right now we are seeing the growth of the alternative media that is covering this Bilderberg Group meeting from top to bottom and it's just amazing seeing
[02:39:31.401 --> 02:39:41.986]  Not the mainstream media that's controlled by the corporations, but the people of this world showing everybody else, with one YouTube video, with a Facebook post or a Twitter post, exactly what's happening.
[02:39:41.986 --> 02:39:44.628]  And that's where people are getting most of the majority of their information.
[02:39:44.628 --> 02:39:47.389]  And I have to say, we are the mainstream media.
[02:39:47.389 --> 02:39:49.370]  It's no longer we're trying to become it.
[02:39:49.370 --> 02:39:52.552]  We actually have become it because most of our information is given
[02:39:53.232 --> 02:39:55.874]  And shared throughout the world, and it's just beautiful.
[02:39:55.874 --> 02:39:58.856]  I mean, there's so many great activists here from all walks of life.
[02:39:58.856 --> 02:40:00.377]  There's people with kids here.
[02:40:00.377 --> 02:40:01.277]  There's older people.
[02:40:01.277 --> 02:40:02.118]  There's young people.
[02:40:02.118 --> 02:40:09.863]  And it's just beautiful seeing so many different people of all walks of life coming together to document what's happening here.
[02:40:09.863 --> 02:40:11.744]  I wouldn't even call this a protest.
[02:40:11.744 --> 02:40:14.986]  Everybody has a DSLR camera around their neck.
[02:40:14.986 --> 02:40:18.068]  Everybody has professional camera equipment, picture equipment.
[02:40:18.068 --> 02:40:20.690]  And we're here just trying to show the world what's happening.
[02:40:20.690 --> 02:40:21.570]  And it's just beautiful.
[02:40:22.951 --> 02:40:24.332]  We're good to go.
[02:40:44.264 --> 02:40:50.269]  They have also wrote their local politicians exactly what's happening, the harassment that has been going on.
[02:40:50.269 --> 02:40:54.072]  I've been here for about two days now, and I already got my passport taken away.
[02:40:54.072 --> 02:40:56.374]  I already got detained.
[02:40:56.374 --> 02:41:03.459]  I already got threatened with arrest and deportation from the country just because I'm here filming what's going on.
[02:41:03.459 --> 02:41:05.081]  And the question has to be asked that these
[02:41:05.681 --> 02:41:10.623]  So-called rich people don't have nothing to hide and aren't doing anything sinister.
[02:41:10.623 --> 02:41:18.565]  Why in the world are they treating people who want to cover this event, who want to document what's happening here, being treated like criminals?
[02:41:18.565 --> 02:41:24.007]  And they're pretty much protecting this place like Fort Knox, and it's just crazy what's happening.
[02:41:24.007 --> 02:41:30.349]  I've been actually traveling all over Europe the last couple days, and I've been in France, I've been in Spain covering major protests.
[02:41:30.989 --> 02:41:35.853]  And I have to say, people in France, people in Spain, they all heard of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:41:35.853 --> 02:41:37.715]  I've talked to random people on the streets.
[02:41:37.715 --> 02:41:39.517]  I've talked to people at protests.
[02:41:39.517 --> 02:41:41.498]  Many people know what the Bilderberg Group is.
[02:41:41.498 --> 02:41:44.240]  Many people are sick of the left and right paradigm.
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:45.982]  Many people just want to be left alone.
[02:41:45.982 --> 02:41:49.625]  They want these big banksters, these big banksters that are here secretly meeting.
[02:41:49.625 --> 02:41:50.926]  They want them out of their lives.
[02:41:50.926 --> 02:41:52.848]  They don't want all their money to go to them.
[02:41:52.848 --> 02:41:53.608]  They want freedom.
[02:41:53.608 --> 02:41:54.649]  They want liberty.
[02:41:54.649 --> 02:41:57.732]  And I was shocked and amazed to see the true spirit
[02:41:58.052 --> 02:42:04.276]  The true idea is that we've been pushing forward for many years now, so alive here in Europe.
[02:42:04.276 --> 02:42:13.080]  There's such a disconnect between us and the Europeans, the Americans, and the people over here have so many interests, so many goals in common.
[02:42:13.080 --> 02:42:16.862]  I mean, we're all just people overall, and we all just want the same thing in life.
[02:42:16.862 --> 02:42:20.044]  We just want to be left alone with our life, liberty, and freedom.
[02:42:20.044 --> 02:42:22.506]  And these people here are suffering just like we are here.
[02:42:22.506 --> 02:42:26.748]  I was in Paris, France, in the Steele Square, covering the major camp-out protests.
[02:42:27.208 --> 02:42:42.799]  Where hundreds, if not thousands of protesters were tear gassed, were beaten by French police officers just because they wanted to camp out in their square to show solidarity with a Spanish movement that started in Barcelona, Spain and is now all over
[02:42:44.298 --> 02:42:44.498]  I'm good.
[02:42:58.437 --> 02:43:03.219]  Spain bailed out their major banks, gave out all their money to them, and the people are suffering.
[02:43:03.219 --> 02:43:17.863]  The people are sick of politicians, and I haven't even, you know, there's, of course, there's some leftists and some right-wingers in the crowd, but the majority of the crowd in Spain, in France, in the resistance movement, in the protest movement, they are sick of both the left and the right.
[02:43:17.863 --> 02:43:20.004]  They're not political at all.
[02:43:20.004 --> 02:43:25.365]  They're just people wanting to be free and live their lives, and I'm going to be traveling all over Europe.
[02:43:25.365 --> 02:43:27.046]  I'm leaving for Ireland, actually, today.
[02:43:27.046 --> 02:43:27.846]  I'm going to be in
[02:43:28.346 --> 02:43:31.007]  Scotland, England, Prague, Amsterdam, Poland.
[02:43:31.007 --> 02:43:37.330]  I'm going to go back to Madrid, Spain and I'm going to be covering as much information as I can, showing you guys exactly what's happening.
[02:43:37.330 --> 02:43:42.592]  Uploading videos to YouTube right now on YouTube.com forward slash WeAreChange.
[02:43:42.592 --> 02:43:51.896]  I have a lot more to show everybody and I'm still just shocked and amazed how many people are in spirit, are in truth with us.
[02:43:52.376 --> 02:44:07.764]  Just like we are in the United States, this is not just the resistance movement in the United States, it's a global resistance movement against the big banks, the big banksters, the big corporate heads, the big elite that rule things in secret and decide everything and decide our lives like they are right now behind us at this bill of urgency.
[02:44:07.764 --> 02:44:10.406]  And we are sick of it and it's just...
[02:44:11.326 --> 02:44:19.048]  An incredible, beautiful time to be alive right now, and I truly believe, I'm very optimistic, that we can take back this future.
[02:44:19.048 --> 02:44:24.889]  We can make our destiny, and we can be successful in this info war, and we are being successful.
[02:44:24.889 --> 02:44:26.110]  This is the first step.
[02:44:26.110 --> 02:44:27.650]  Amazing things are happening.
[02:44:27.650 --> 02:44:31.911]  Prosecutors are looking into arresting Henry Kissinger for crimes.
[02:44:31.911 --> 02:44:37.332]  This is just an amazing, beautiful time, and a lot more greater things are coming.
[02:44:37.332 --> 02:44:39.213]  That's all I bring.
[02:44:40.518 --> 02:44:41.739]  Aaron here.
[02:44:41.739 --> 02:44:43.821]  Aaron, here you go.
[02:44:43.821 --> 02:44:44.641]  Thank you, Luke.
[02:44:44.641 --> 02:44:46.443]  I also wanted to speak for a minute.
[02:44:46.443 --> 02:44:48.244]  I've just bumped into Paul Dornan.
[02:44:48.244 --> 02:44:55.450]  He's from Romania, and he actually gave us footage four years ago for Endgame, the movie, when he traveled to Istanbul.
[02:44:55.450 --> 02:44:56.531]  And why is that important?
[02:44:56.531 --> 02:45:04.598]  Because 10 years ago, 5 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, Jim Tucker was virtually the only reporter on the ground.
[02:45:05.078 --> 02:45:09.120]  Now there's just a decentralized movement of activists all over the world.
[02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:11.141]  People we don't know personally.
[02:45:11.141 --> 02:45:15.583]  Everyone is showing up wherever these meetings are and trying to put the spotlight on this group.
[02:45:15.583 --> 02:45:18.584]  I want to pass the phone now to Paul Dornanoo.
[02:45:18.584 --> 02:45:25.187]  Please tell us what it's been like to cover Bilderberg in the past four years and what you've learned so far this year.
[02:45:25.187 --> 02:45:27.468]  I think it just arrived only a few hours ago.
[02:45:27.468 --> 02:45:30.450]  Paul Dornanoo.
[02:45:30.450 --> 02:45:30.810]  Hello Alex.
[02:45:31.599 --> 02:45:33.119]  Hi everyone.
[02:45:33.119 --> 02:45:39.621]  I'm glad to be here and I'm so surprised to find so many people gathered here.
[02:45:39.621 --> 02:45:43.842]  I wasn't expecting so many people here today.
[02:45:43.842 --> 02:45:44.982]  What can I say?
[02:45:44.982 --> 02:45:53.804]  In the past five years, since I started covering the Biddeberg meetings, I've started seeing more and more people.
[02:45:55.106 --> 02:46:06.833]  Coming together and especially, which is more important, media like Russia Today have started to come this year again.
[02:46:06.833 --> 02:46:13.037]  Last year they were in Spain and hopefully they will come next year.
[02:46:13.037 --> 02:46:19.061]  So I hope I will be able to go next year to the other events and cover
[02:46:20.379 --> 02:46:20.899]  We're good to go.
[02:46:42.787 --> 02:46:51.071]  Okay, so I hope we'll have more information in the next couple of days, so I'll give you back an error.
[02:46:51.071 --> 02:47:06.900]  My website is www.infocon.ro is the Romanian news website and hopefully we'll have some information there, new information in our language.
[02:47:09.744 --> 02:47:11.826]  Thank you very much, Paul.
[02:47:11.826 --> 02:47:12.427]  It's exciting.
[02:47:12.427 --> 02:47:14.008]  This is not about media stars.
[02:47:14.008 --> 02:47:27.321]  It's about decentralized activists going to the scenes of the crime and covering what's really happened, while the lamestream media, particularly in the U.S., sits on its hands and pretends it knows nothing about the proceedings going on.
[02:47:27.321 --> 02:47:31.404]  It is a little bit different here in Europe, particularly in Switzerland.
[02:47:31.404 --> 02:47:34.848]  Nearly every paper, whether small or large, has been covering
[02:47:35.308 --> 02:47:35.848]  We're good to go.
[02:47:55.569 --> 02:47:58.311]  That is June 11th here in St.
[02:47:58.311 --> 02:48:00.032]  Moritz, Switzerland.
[02:48:00.032 --> 02:48:01.733]  And everyone should come down.
[02:48:01.733 --> 02:48:05.476]  Everyone who loves liberty should come and let the Bilderberg Group know.
[02:48:05.476 --> 02:48:07.317]  We don't approve of their meeting in secret.
[02:48:07.317 --> 02:48:09.739]  We don't approve of the globalist agenda.
[02:48:09.739 --> 02:48:11.620]  We know they're following.
[02:48:11.620 --> 02:48:15.563]  And although they meet in secret and don't tell us what they're talking about, it's quite simple.
[02:48:15.563 --> 02:48:20.907]  You look up the names, you look up their bios, you see what they're involved in, and you will witness the tyranny.
[02:48:20.907 --> 02:48:23.389]  And then you can start fighting against it.
[02:48:23.389 --> 02:48:24.910]  So there's a protest tomorrow.
[02:48:25.410 --> 02:48:27.132]  That is June 11th in St.
[02:48:27.132 --> 02:48:28.433]  Moritz, Switzerland.
[02:48:28.433 --> 02:48:36.780]  Everyone who's with them, the sound of this phone somewhere on the continent of Europe, or even if you're further away, if you can make it, you should come down.
[02:48:36.780 --> 02:48:42.004]  It's vital that we show them that there is a resistance and we don't approve of what's going on.
[02:48:42.004 --> 02:48:45.047]  I'm going to hand the phone back now to Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:48:48.067 --> 02:48:51.070]  Yeah, we're talking about tomorrow at noon.
[02:48:51.070 --> 02:48:57.496]  We want to see everybody here, basically from Central Europe, even further afield if you can make it.
[02:48:57.496 --> 02:49:00.559]  There's going to be a massive protest at noon.
[02:49:00.559 --> 02:49:07.786]  And the good thing about it is that it's going to involve both the young socialists from the left here in Switzerland and also the Swiss
[02:49:08.286 --> 02:49:14.249]  People's Party, which is the conservative wing there of the political movement in Switzerland.
[02:49:14.249 --> 02:49:21.592]  So no matter what your political persuasion, we want to see everybody here tomorrow at noon for the big Bilderberg protest.
[02:49:21.592 --> 02:49:26.415]  The police, we've had reports they're roughing up EU Parliament members, as you just heard.
[02:49:27.635 --> 02:49:44.120]  Just literally in the last hour we've had reports from Alex of InfoKrieg of a standoff of protesters and police down there just above the hill where you can get a direct sightline onto the Bilderberg chopper landing pad and we want to see everybody there tomorrow.
[02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:49.402]  Of course we were talking to Lucas Reimann of the Swiss People's Party in the last hour.
[02:49:49.802 --> 02:50:02.583]  And he was saying that basically the whole premise behind Bilderberg, their whole mindset, their whole agenda, the fact that they hide their faces in shame as the blacked out tinted window cars drive past us, that is totally
[02:50:03.797 --> 02:50:25.686]  The opposite to what Switzerland as a country stands for, this beautiful country of direct democracy, people deciding on their own destiny, and yet we have this gaggle of 120 shameful criminals there, plotting to decimate the world, plotting to install their post-industrial revolution, which will cripple the living standards of the West.
[02:50:25.686 --> 02:50:31.868]  Also continue the decimation of the third world with rising oil prices, food crisis, of course,
[02:50:32.468 --> 02:50:38.651]  Jim Tucker yesterday talking about the $7 per gallon of gas.
[02:50:38.651 --> 02:50:41.853]  And the agenda is now being exposed like never before.
[02:50:41.853 --> 02:50:44.755]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live in the final segment.
[02:50:44.755 --> 02:50:45.215]  Stay tuned.
[02:51:01.909 --> 02:51:06.130]  The number one secret to having great health and long life is having high levels of glutathione.
[02:51:06.130 --> 02:51:17.794]  This master antioxidant is required by your body to stop free radicals, keep cells young, remove chemical and heavy metal toxins, support immunity, support liver functions, stop inflammation, and much more.
[02:51:17.794 --> 02:51:25.256]  The results of optimal levels of glutathione in your body are more mental and physical energy, stronger immune system, greater endurance, and more.
[02:51:25.256 --> 02:51:29.678]  Do you know the number one secret superfood that helps increase your glutathione levels by 64% or more?
[02:51:31.238 --> 02:51:34.561]  It's unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.

[02:53:05.924 --> 02:53:07.585]  Are you prepared to grab and go?

[02:54:06.680 --> 02:54:11.602]  Thank you.
[02:54:11.602 --> 02:54:14.563]  Okay, we are back live at Infowars.com.
[02:54:14.563 --> 02:54:16.864]  I am Aaron Dyches, reporting from St.
[02:54:16.864 --> 02:54:20.865]  Moritz, Switzerland, the site of the 2011 Bilderberg meeting.
[02:54:20.865 --> 02:54:28.028]  I want to hit three very important points before we end this broadcast, the most important of which is we are going to have a special broadcast
[02:54:28.568 --> 02:54:31.391]  Live again tomorrow at 1 p.m.
[02:54:31.391 --> 02:54:34.895]  Central Texas time that is 8 p.m.
[02:54:34.895 --> 02:54:37.278]  here in Switzerland.
[02:54:37.278 --> 02:54:40.321]  We are going to have a protest tomorrow.
[02:54:40.321 --> 02:54:45.887]  We want everyone to come out and we're going to report live on what transpired throughout the day.
[02:54:45.887 --> 02:54:48.210]  Another important point we were discussing earlier
[02:54:48.650 --> 02:54:58.756]  All the technological gurus and dominionists who are running the new online stuff as the world becomes more technical, more integrated and more sophisticated.
[02:54:58.756 --> 02:55:10.443]  The older Bilderberg members are sort of fading into the distance as people like CEO, founder of Facebook, Chris Hughes, is here meeting not only with other technological wizards
[02:55:10.763 --> 02:55:15.126]  But also the heads of the NSA, the heads of the various intelligence organizations.
[02:55:15.126 --> 02:55:19.129]  We hear often about Facebook being a CIA front.
[02:55:19.129 --> 02:55:25.834]  Well, obviously one of the central meeting points is here at the Bilderberg meeting, especially now in the 21st century.
[02:55:25.834 --> 02:55:32.039]  Also here at the meeting is Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, Inc.
[02:55:32.039 --> 02:55:36.222]  Google, of course, being one of the biggest entities anywhere in the world, especially online.
[02:55:36.662 --> 02:55:41.864]  Eric Schmidt is also reportedly probably going to be the next Secretary of Commerce.
[02:55:41.864 --> 02:55:48.167]  He's been a strong supporter of Obama, a strong supporter of the color revolutions going on around the world.
[02:55:48.167 --> 02:56:01.132]  It'll be very interesting to see how his position develops as he becomes more powerful in the world and how these technological heads continue to meet with the likes of Bilderberg and the big heads of intelligence.
[02:56:01.132 --> 02:56:02.032]  One final point.
[02:56:02.752 --> 02:56:29.965]  We've gotten reports from We Are Chained Switzerland that the chief of police came to this activist meeting tonight and that he approves, the chief of police does that is, of us asking questions of Bilderberg, of protesters coming out to show their faces, and that coincides with these important members of parliament here in Switzerland, or the elected body, telling them not to harass protesters, telling them instead to arrest Henry Kissinger.
[02:56:30.925 --> 02:56:35.547]  Also, a man was arrested yesterday who... Paul, I don't understand this.
[02:56:35.547 --> 02:56:37.608]  Please just tell them.
[02:56:37.608 --> 02:56:46.412]  Yeah, of course, we reported the bomb scare yesterday where, you know, our car was parked at the top of the hill and the Chief of Police told Aaron that nobody would be allowed into the area.
[02:56:46.412 --> 02:56:47.792]  Not the same Chief of Police.
[02:56:47.792 --> 02:56:51.374]  Not the same Chief of Police who came to this event tonight.
[02:56:51.374 --> 02:56:59.097]  And Charlie Skelton of the London Guardian put out a report this morning where he got a photograph which was taken by one of the activists.
[02:56:59.697 --> 02:57:00.318]  We're good to go.
[02:57:17.879 --> 02:57:42.111]  According to Alex of InfoKrieg, it turns out that he was a member of a neo-fascist organisation, and as Alex has just said to me now, you know, you would think that he would agree with what Bilderberg are doing inside the hotel, but definitely some kind of provocateur action was in evidence yesterday, and this bomb scare allowed Bilderberg for about an hour to clear the immediate area.
[02:57:42.111 --> 02:57:44.652]  They put up a roadblock and many have suggested that this was
[02:57:45.112 --> 02:57:45.713]  Thank you.
[02:57:56.349 --> 02:58:04.532]  I just want to mention again, we are going to have a special live broadcast tomorrow, Saturday, June 11th at 8 p.m.
[02:58:04.532 --> 02:58:07.373]  the local time here in Switzerland, 1 p.m.
[02:58:07.373 --> 02:58:09.054]  central time in the United States.
[02:58:09.054 --> 02:58:09.934]  That's 1 p.m.
[02:58:09.934 --> 02:58:11.275]  in the United States.
[02:58:11.275 --> 02:58:13.256]  Again, we're having protests.
[02:58:13.256 --> 02:58:16.057]  We're calling on people to come and demonstrate and show their face.
[02:58:16.517 --> 02:58:19.561]  Tomorrow at noon, the local time in Switzerland.
[02:58:19.561 --> 02:58:21.763]  That's noon, the local time in Switzerland.
[02:58:21.763 --> 02:58:22.324]  Here in St.
[02:58:22.324 --> 02:58:23.485]  Moritz.
[02:58:23.485 --> 02:58:30.574]  So everyone should come out and then later when we do the special live broadcast on Saturday, we'll tell you what happened and what came out.
[02:58:30.574 --> 02:58:34.178]  And of course we will continue to do live JustinTV broadcasts throughout the day.
