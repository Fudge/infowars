[08:27.160 --> 08:32.040]  going to have reporters Mark Anderson American Free Press Jim Tucker American
[08:32.040 --> 08:36.800]  Free Press Charlie Skelton the London Guardian Bob Chapman with financial news
[08:36.800 --> 08:41.880]  and Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson of info wars.com and prisonplana.com as we
[08:41.880 --> 08:47.560]  track and cover and ferret out the internal agenda of the global elite
[08:47.560 --> 08:54.280]  meeting in secret in Switzerland this has been the biggest year ever in the 35
[08:54.280 --> 08:58.160]  years that the Bilderberg group has been exposed they've been meeting of course
[08:58.160 --> 09:01.680]  for decades before that their own corporate minutes have been ferreted
[09:01.680 --> 09:05.760]  out since then they've been released some of them to the BBC a decade ago
[09:05.760 --> 09:10.080]  admitting they want to set up world government but US media until just a
[09:10.080 --> 09:14.760]  few years ago was still saying it did not exist and that you are insane if you
[09:14.760 --> 09:18.040]  talk about it that's why I get countless emails of people talking about their
[09:18.040 --> 09:21.400]  family members if they talk about it at dinner visiting their parents or their
[09:21.400 --> 09:26.440]  children or their neighbors they are laughed at because the average of my
[09:26.440 --> 09:30.320]  numb person out there thinks they're on the winning team if they laugh at people
[09:30.320 --> 09:34.960]  that have more knowledge than them we now have the full 2011 official

[10:04.240 --> 10:11.360]  to the globalist Perry because Gennrich is falling out of favor with the ruling
[10:11.360 --> 10:15.520]  class because he's losing so much traction we've got a lot of key economic
[10:15.520 --> 10:20.680]  and military news today coming up China's raiding house says US is already
[10:20.680 --> 10:24.640]  defaulting as I've told you for years we're gonna explain what that means to

[10:50.400 --> 10:53.880]  threat that even the Guardian is reporting it was staged we of course
[10:53.880 --> 10:57.680]  first broke that news here yesterday because our team is working so hard
[10:57.680 --> 11:02.000]  doing such a great job and we go down to Paul Joseph Watson with a report on the
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.040]  latest developments then he'll hand the phone off to Luke Radowski we are
[11:06.040 --> 11:09.640]  changed Paul break down the latest developments
[11:09.640 --> 11:14.680]  Hi Alex yeah we're at an event that's just up the hill from the Bilderberg
[11:14.680 --> 11:20.040]  hotel about an hour ago we actually went in the field that's just above the
[11:20.040 --> 11:25.520]  hotel just outside the police line and we were able to film live footage which
[11:25.520 --> 11:30.000]  was streamed on just in TV of the helicopter picking up one of the
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.560]  Bilderberg members we believe it to be a woman and it flew off over the mountain
[11:35.560 --> 11:38.880]  so we got some pretty good live footage and then afterwards we were
[11:38.880 --> 11:44.640]  interviewing Dominique we are changed Switzerland and he was telling us about a
[11:44.640 --> 11:51.680]  big breaking story involving the Swiss politician Dominique Baytig who before
[11:51.680 --> 11:55.720]  the conference had called for Henry Kissinger to be arrested as a war
[11:55.720 --> 12:00.720]  criminal and I'm gonna hand you over to Dominique so he can explain the letter
[12:00.720 --> 12:05.680]  that has now been presented to the Swiss okay and tell us who Dominique is again
[12:05.680 --> 12:08.640]  tell us who Dominique is before you give him the phone
[12:08.640 --> 12:13.320]  Dominique is from we are changed Switzerland okay Dominique good to
[12:13.320 --> 12:21.480]  speak with you sir give us this report okay yesterday we went to the
[12:21.480 --> 12:25.880]  hotel the Bilderberg hotel where they meet and we brought a letter from the
[12:25.880 --> 12:31.840]  Swiss legislature Dominique Baytig who was stated that the different
[12:31.840 --> 12:37.480]  journalists were intimidated by the police they were followed by cars with
[12:37.480 --> 12:44.320]  determined numbers in Switzerland and black black windows and things like that
[12:44.320 --> 12:49.240]  so Baytig wrote an official letter that we handed out to the chief of the
[12:49.240 --> 12:55.440]  region Barbara Janom Steiner to get sure that the journalists can do their work
[12:55.440 --> 13:00.560]  and that the coverage is done about the Bilderberg because he know what the
[13:00.560 --> 13:05.440]  what the agenda is from the Bilderberg is and he doesn't want them to meet in
[13:05.440 --> 13:11.200]  Switzerland they should go away he said and tonight he will come to confront the
[13:11.200 --> 13:17.560]  event managers about the case that Henry Kissinger is coming to Switzerland
[13:17.560 --> 13:23.200]  this is big news sir and again you've already had a member of the equivalent
[13:23.200 --> 13:29.360]  of your Congress come out earlier in the week and call for the arrest of
[13:29.360 --> 13:33.480]  Kissinger is this the same now explain your government system explain your
[13:33.480 --> 13:38.600]  government system and exactly who he is in his name again and who's talked to
[13:38.600 --> 13:41.480]  him it sounds like you've talked to him you have the official letter he's
[13:41.480 --> 13:45.160]  already in the papers saying he wants Kissinger arrested you're saying he is
[13:45.160 --> 13:51.600]  coming today to confront the police it's not the only one they are two other
[13:51.600 --> 13:56.320]  legislators coming up there in the hotel randlings where we stay at an event
[13:56.320 --> 14:01.840]  that they talk about the Bilderberg meetings and their agenda and so we
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.400]  have in Switzerland that subsidiary subsidiary system so the people the
[14:06.400 --> 14:13.840]  local people can do politics and then it's go up and up to the to the to the
[14:13.840 --> 14:20.160]  federal system so it's not a centralized system where in the central laws are
[14:20.160 --> 14:27.720]  being being a yes sir for those that don't know the United States more than
[14:27.720 --> 14:31.800]  the Greeks and Romans as we were told by modern historians the United States
[14:31.800 --> 14:35.640]  if you read the founding fathers was actually founded off a Dutch model that
[14:35.640 --> 14:39.600]  was then exported to Switzerland Switzerland already had a similar model
[14:39.600 --> 14:44.440]  where you actually have yours your states of course under another name you
[14:44.440 --> 14:51.240]  have your what cantons correct yes you have your you have your states for
[14:51.240 --> 14:55.240]  those that don't know and they are the supreme power they then vote and
[14:55.240 --> 15:00.520]  completely order the vassal federal body around as our republic was
[15:00.520 --> 15:04.960]  established we now have it completely backwards here in the United States and
[15:04.960 --> 15:09.000]  is why we're in so much trouble and so some of the leaders of the states
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  hence leaders of the federal government because the states run your
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.560]  federal government are coming you're saying three of them we do have the
[15:16.560 --> 15:19.560]  mainstream Swiss papers from two days ago where he was saying he wants them
[15:19.560 --> 15:22.840]  arrested your prime minister has said they shouldn't be meeting there as well
[15:22.840 --> 15:27.000]  so what you're saying is confirmed there but this is big breaking news this is
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.600]  the first time I've ever heard of this that the leaders of a government are
[15:30.600 --> 15:34.920]  going to be going and confronting the criminals that are meeting there any
[15:34.920 --> 15:41.160]  other details you can give us sir yeah the other things is that that's it the
[15:41.160 --> 15:46.480]  national like the legislature said that if something's gonna happen if blood is
[15:46.480 --> 15:51.840]  on the street the whole responsibility has to be taken by the chief of the
[15:51.840 --> 15:56.600]  region and we're also attending at the billiards meeting yes they normally had
[15:56.600 --> 15:59.520]  the local security chief just there inside as a minion and they bring him
[15:59.520 --> 16:03.760]  some food and things but he's not in on the meetings themselves again give us
[16:03.760 --> 16:06.920]  the specific name of them of the ministers can you give us the name of
[16:06.920 --> 16:10.440]  the other two ministers and can you read to us the letter sir do you have that
[16:10.440 --> 16:15.160]  letter in front of you no I haven't the letter in front of me but it states
[16:15.160 --> 16:24.080]  that stop all the scaring of the journalist and let them get the work
[16:24.080 --> 16:28.320]  out and do the big coverage of the billiards meeting because in this
[16:28.320 --> 16:33.440]  country like Switzerland if we have been direct democracy the people should be
[16:33.440 --> 16:41.200]  informed about this meeting and that we have an article article 266 that states
[16:41.200 --> 16:47.520]  that our politicians cannot meet in secret with other politicians from other
[16:47.520 --> 16:51.240]  states other countries foreign countries that's called trading we have the
[16:51.240 --> 16:58.720]  Logan act as well it's like the Logan act yeah and so it's an illegal thing
[16:58.720 --> 17:06.120]  and he repeated this that he don't want to be a part of this system where the
[17:06.120 --> 17:12.840]  billiards can get a platform in this country so well amazing sir now to be
[17:12.840 --> 17:18.040]  specific you're with we are change Luke Radowski is there as well Paul Watson is
[17:18.040 --> 17:21.940]  with you but you've seen the letter I mean how do you know the lever have you
[17:21.940 --> 17:26.800]  seen the letter yes yes I wrote a letter to the legislature in Switzerland you

[26:47.680 --> 26:51.680]  of attention this is gonna draw to the real shadow enemies once we identify
[26:51.680 --> 26:55.480]  these vampires in the light of high noon today and tomorrow if this is another
[26:55.480 --> 26:59.840]  devastating blow as we show people that there are little men behind the curtain

[27:04.480 --> 27:08.600]  got Lou Bredavsky to speak about the laughter yeah Luke Luke you've seen the

[27:12.240 --> 27:16.840]  out right now to add to this Luke you've seen the letter yes I've seen the
[27:16.840 --> 27:20.400]  letter I actually walked up to the police officers here right at the front
[27:20.400 --> 27:24.400]  entrance of the main hotel and I gave it to them as soon as I walked up to them
[27:24.400 --> 27:27.640]  they already were pushing me out they already were like telling me to get out
[27:27.640 --> 27:30.720]  of there and I was like wait a minute buddy wait a minute buddy you're gonna
[27:30.720 --> 27:34.000]  read this letter right now thank God it's in Swiss German so they could
[27:34.000 --> 27:37.680]  understand it they may not understand me but they sure did understand that letter
[27:37.680 --> 27:41.320]  and they actually allowed us to stand with it where we were actually kicked
[27:41.320 --> 27:44.640]  out and harassed many times I mean it's pretty intense here I mean we're
[27:44.640 --> 27:49.440]  followed by cop cars everywhere we go here I got threatened with arrest and

[27:54.280 --> 27:58.520]  what's it learned in is very brilliant this representative this Chancellor that
[27:58.520 --> 28:02.720]  wrote this letter is really a hero and we handed out this letter to all the
[28:02.720 --> 28:05.760]  police officers here and they're being a lot nicer to us they're letting us
[28:05.760 --> 28:09.480]  come and we can now stand meters away from the hotel and document who's
[28:09.480 --> 28:12.920]  coming in and who's coming out and it definitely changed a lot of things here

[28:49.480 --> 28:53.120]  pictures and documents that Henry Kissinger is here this guy this Chancellor
[28:53.120 --> 28:56.800]  is actually an amazing guy he did the same thing when George Bush was supposed

[29:00.440 --> 29:04.400]  prosecutors like he is doing right now and Bush canceled Bush canceled yeah
[29:04.400 --> 29:08.120]  Bush canceled that event because of this Chancellor and the letter and the
[29:08.120 --> 29:13.360]  prosecutors who are going after him they did the same thing right now in 2011 at
[29:13.360 --> 29:16.480]  this Bilderberg meeting with Henry Kissinger so we were looking for photos

[30:02.960 --> 30:07.240]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[30:07.240 --> 30:11.400]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[30:11.400 --> 30:15.320]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[30:15.320 --> 30:18.960]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:18.960 --> 30:23.520]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[30:23.520 --> 30:28.160]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[30:28.160 --> 30:31.920]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[30:31.920 --> 30:35.400]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[33:41.600 --> 33:47.240]  Watson Aaron Dykes I salute Jim Tucker Mark Anderson I salute my team here all
[33:47.240 --> 33:52.400]  the great crew all the great writers what is happening is historical to say
[33:52.400 --> 33:57.680]  the least if you just joined us three Swiss ministers have signed a letter it
[33:57.680 --> 34:01.600]  has been delivered to the Bilderberg group the police have now backed off
[34:01.600 --> 34:06.080]  harassing media and one of their highest level members of their slash
[34:06.080 --> 34:12.080]  Congress it's called their canton it's the Council of the States is going to go
[34:12.080 --> 34:16.400]  to Bilderberg and demand to be let in and is going to confront and try to have
[34:16.400 --> 34:22.600]  Henry Kissinger arrested this is off the charts delicious I know we can meet
[34:22.600 --> 34:27.120]  the globalist I know that who has the fight wins who is in the right wins
[34:27.120 --> 34:33.960]  when they fight resistance is victory my children's future your children's
[34:33.960 --> 34:40.880]  future free humanity the spirit of 1776 everything we are is about standing up
[34:40.880 --> 34:45.800]  and marching on Bilderberg today and tomorrow this is off the chart exciting
[34:45.800 --> 34:52.840]  and I take you now I believe we've gotten him online to Mark Anderson he is one
[34:52.840 --> 34:56.400]  of the chief reporters I believe he's even the editor over there at American
[34:56.400 --> 35:01.160]  Free Press and he writes on news across the nation American Free Press net the
[35:01.160 --> 35:07.400]  colleague of Jim Tucker and Mr. Anderson it's good to have you there are you as
[35:07.400 --> 35:13.640]  energized and excited as I am about these bombshell developments absolutely and
[35:13.640 --> 35:17.120]  you know it's kind of a mixture of activists and Sherlock Holmes you know
[35:17.120 --> 35:22.640]  the Bilderbergers are an intrigue kind of group and you have to be a kind of a
[35:22.640 --> 35:28.000]  sleuth and an activist at the same time but I'm very excited what do you make of
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.960]  the fact that this letter has been delivered the cops have suddenly begun
[35:30.960 --> 35:34.640]  to really behave themselves and are having the reporters get closer because
[35:34.640 --> 35:40.400]  you know there it's direct democracy and their their boss has told them you're
[35:40.400 --> 35:43.840]  protecting criminals we're told the police are really starting to wake up
[35:43.840 --> 35:50.480]  and now this member of the government this member cantonian leader is is
[35:50.480 --> 35:54.920]  going to be arriving soon to try to get into Bilderberg this is Bilderberg
[35:54.920 --> 36:00.320]  under siege mark absolutely I think we're talking about Dominique Baytick the
[36:00.320 --> 36:05.360]  National Council member of the Swiss People's Party yes yeah Dominique as
[36:05.360 --> 36:10.600]  you probably know had written letters to Simonetta Samaruga the federal civil
[36:10.600 --> 36:14.680]  law enforcement officer who's a member of the federal council and then Mrs.
[36:14.680 --> 36:20.800]  Barbara Genome Steiner and she's the cantonal cop top top officer and not
[36:20.800 --> 36:25.560]  only did they not initially respond to Baytick but Genome Steiner she actually
[36:25.560 --> 36:29.960]  is attending Bilderberg so initially there was a slap in the face to Dominique
[36:29.960 --> 36:35.000]  Baytick in his initial letters fleeing to these top law enforcement officers not
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.640]  to even allow Bilderberg to meet here in the first place so they they they snub
[36:39.640 --> 36:46.080]  Dominique Baytick this traditionalist minded legislator but what we're
[36:46.080 --> 36:49.440]  hearing now which is what you're talking about he's not taking this lying
[36:49.440 --> 36:55.040]  down and he's gonna ignore their their cold shoulder and and and evidently be
[36:55.040 --> 36:59.840]  very proactive about this so that that takes a lot of courage a great deal of
[36:59.840 --> 37:05.760]  courage on Dominique's part mark I know you are you know really second only to
[37:05.760 --> 37:09.000]  somebody like Jim Tucker and your deep years of research and following
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.880]  Bilderberg and you've been to many of these events am I right in saying that
[37:13.880 --> 37:20.920]  nothing like this has ever happened and that that that this is a major watershed
[37:20.920 --> 37:29.120]  bellwether flashpoint event I believe so in many ways Jim Jim and I were
[37:29.120 --> 37:34.600]  discussing this earlier first of all he cannot remember he goes back like 35
[37:34.600 --> 37:39.440]  years he cannot remember ever there being a national legislator of a host
[37:39.440 --> 37:44.720]  country to Bilderberg raising this kind of ruckus in this manner actually trying
[37:44.720 --> 37:48.320]  to prevent Bilderberg from meeting and when he couldn't do that then going to
[37:48.320 --> 37:53.320]  this next step and delivering this this protest apparently in person in front of
[37:53.320 --> 37:57.800]  Bilderberg so this is unprecedented and according to Jim who just told me this
[37:57.800 --> 38:03.800]  this morning and he's been covering this for 35 years and then then you have the
[38:03.800 --> 38:07.960]  other factors involved there they're taking this meeting taking place in a
[38:07.960 --> 38:12.360]  country whose traditions run exactly against the grain of Bilderberg they
[38:12.360 --> 38:17.000]  want centralized control the Swiss believe in a kind of a populist home rule
[38:17.000 --> 38:22.000]  grassroots style of government it's just a no-fit all the way they shouldn't be
[38:22.000 --> 38:27.080]  here philosophically culturally in for any reason they don't belong here they
[38:27.080 --> 38:30.240]  don't belong anywhere really but they definitely don't belong here and I think
[38:30.240 --> 38:34.000]  that's what they take these that this would tarnish the Swiss system it would
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.240]  tarnish their reputation and he probably suspects that that some of their
[38:38.240 --> 38:42.560]  deliberations might be how to get Switzerland into the European Union so
[38:42.560 --> 38:48.320]  it's not the sticky wicket in the in their mad quest for a unified Europe and
[38:48.320 --> 38:52.960]  notice as soon as they have the second vote and finally force the success story
[38:52.960 --> 38:57.800]  Ireland into the EU as EU ministers have said it's a receivership arm they
[38:57.800 --> 39:01.360]  immediately by design through the ministers they controlled the traders
[39:01.360 --> 39:05.880]  inside Ireland economically imploded them and handed literally the lion share
[39:05.880 --> 39:09.160]  their taxes over to the IMF and World Bank and that's what they want to do to
[39:09.160 --> 39:13.920]  Switzerland and so you know the hour is getting late the global crisis is on
[39:13.920 --> 39:18.200]  the crimes of Bilderberg are known and people are identifying them as the
[39:18.200 --> 39:23.160]  enemy and justice be done may the heavens fall as people like yourself and
[39:23.160 --> 39:27.320]  the protesters continually to doggedly exposed Bilderberg being laughed at
[39:27.320 --> 39:32.640]  being told it doesn't exist haha now we see it all coming to a head as the
[39:32.640 --> 39:38.240]  global ultra-rich the richest most powerful royalty and banking heads and
[39:38.240 --> 39:42.680]  oil company heads meet it's it more and more and again we won't defeat them
[39:42.680 --> 39:46.640]  this day probably those so it could be the fall of Bilderberg I felt it in my
[39:46.640 --> 39:54.640]  gut yeah you've got there you've got their octogenarian mainstays like
[39:54.640 --> 39:57.880]  Kissinger and Rockefeller who aren't long before they go to that great
[39:57.880 --> 40:03.280]  bank falls in the sky or maybe it's the other direction but yeah I think that
[40:03.280 --> 40:07.960]  people like that with these egos the size of mild tiger here in the Switzerland
[40:07.960 --> 40:12.440]  they want to see concrete results they want to see their world order before
[40:12.440 --> 40:18.320]  they go to that the great beyond you know in in them or what whatever they
[40:18.320 --> 40:21.620]  think their futures are I don't think they have any but I think they're
[40:21.620 --> 40:25.720]  getting impatient you know things are moving more slowly than they anticipated
[40:25.720 --> 40:30.320]  a lot of people are waking up hopefully enough people and you know they want to
[40:30.320 --> 40:35.120]  see this consummated before their their elder members pass on so they've got to
[40:35.120 --> 40:39.960]  be getting very impatient well and and and they're forcing their global
[40:39.960 --> 40:43.680]  tyranny through and their carbon taxes but it only mounts more resistance and
[40:43.680 --> 40:47.800]  it takes me back to the Star Wars line that you know the tighter you squeeze
[40:47.800 --> 40:52.680]  the more systems will slip through your fingers I mean that is what is beginning
[40:52.680 --> 40:57.800]  to happen and we've always got moles who refuse to talk to us waiters and and
[40:57.800 --> 41:03.000]  others at the hotels until they're rudely treated like garbage the memos
[41:03.000 --> 41:06.760]  we've confirmed that Jim has literally snuck out before him and shot at in
[41:06.760 --> 41:11.680]  Portugal to get where we have warning shots where they are not allowed to look
[41:11.680 --> 41:16.480]  Hillary Clinton and others in the eyes people are in the presence of this evil
[41:16.480 --> 41:21.000]  and their human instinct for survival they instantly come to our side and give
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.040]  us all the data and the globalists should know it's only going to intensify
[41:25.040 --> 41:31.480]  agents of liberty eternal agents of freedom agents that literally carry the
[41:31.480 --> 41:35.560]  spark of God's love in their hearts for their children and our cultures are
[41:35.560 --> 41:41.360]  everywhere and the globalists have their legions of paid-off scum and
[41:41.360 --> 41:46.400]  psychopaths and sociopaths and bullies and control freaks but it's always free
[41:46.400 --> 41:50.040]  humanity that isn't rallied until things get really bad and then good people
[41:50.040 --> 41:54.680]  finally come out of their trance wake up and and that's why the evil ones are
[41:54.680 --> 41:58.560]  so scared of good people because they want to intimidate us and make us feel
[41:58.560 --> 42:03.440]  weak because they can literally at a spiritual instinctive level we are like
[42:03.440 --> 42:07.560]  thousand-foot giants to them because we're in the right and the wicked flee
[42:07.560 --> 42:11.720]  when none pursue and and well we are pursuing and that's why they flee and
[42:11.720 --> 42:17.600]  hide Mark Anderson yeah you know I think that for all their great wealth they're
[42:17.600 --> 42:22.840]  the poorest people on the planet they're culturally and in their soul in
[42:22.840 --> 42:27.920]  their intellect in their spirit they're poorer than dirt and I think they know
[42:27.920 --> 42:32.720]  that all they have is money and power there which are ephemeral things things
[42:32.720 --> 42:36.640]  that slip away I think they sense their own mortality individually and
[42:36.640 --> 42:40.080]  collectively that there's nowhere to run there's nowhere to hide they're not
[42:40.080 --> 42:42.720]  going to get away with this because we're not going to let them it's just that
[42:42.720 --> 42:46.640]  simple and you know even if they were meeting for the best of reasons and
[42:46.640 --> 42:51.160]  everything was peaches and cream you're still not supposed to have secret
[42:51.160 --> 42:54.720]  decisions being made see that's what people don't understand secrecy is never
[42:54.720 --> 42:58.720]  good even if the best intentions are there and we know they don't have the
[42:58.720 --> 43:03.120]  best intentions so it's a double whammy you know it's just there's no way they
[43:03.120 --> 43:06.800]  can explain their way out of this it's undemocratic it's wrong even if they're
[43:06.800 --> 43:10.720]  voting to send money to the poor every week they need to do it in the open but
[43:10.720 --> 43:15.000]  you know openness to them is you know just enough money they don't even
[43:15.000 --> 43:22.720]  understand what that's about you know it's just it's almost sad I mean
[43:22.720 --> 43:29.400]  they're really I pity them as much as I load them well you're right I'm Mark
[43:29.400 --> 43:32.720]  Anderson looking at the agenda for folks that just joined us we're covering
[43:32.720 --> 43:39.040]  Bilderberg 2011 a day that will be remembered for a long time very
[43:39.040 --> 43:43.200]  exciting you know the equivalent of Iran Paul of Switzerland that's what he's
[43:43.200 --> 43:49.680]  known as heading up one of the cantons and again their states then combine to
[43:49.680 --> 43:52.880]  make the federal government it's direct state rule people rule what the
[43:52.880 --> 43:57.360]  republic once had through the states until the globalist took over in 1913
[43:57.360 --> 44:01.160]  got rid of the 17th amendment for the states to send in the US senators he's
[44:01.160 --> 44:04.320]  basically the equivalent of that for folks that don't understand the US
[44:04.320 --> 44:09.200]  Republic before it was taken over and understand the Swiss system but
[44:09.200 --> 44:13.800]  expanding on that mark recapping how big this is we're gonna put them we can
[44:13.800 --> 44:17.920]  the letter back on screen that's been delivered by Luke Radowski and later
[44:17.920 --> 44:22.280]  today in the next few hours the leader of this canton is gonna come there he's
[44:22.280 --> 44:25.560]  already sent out to the prosecutors the police he's told him look you're in
[44:25.560 --> 44:31.000]  violation of law I'm coming I'm your boss look out this is a showdown this is a
[44:31.000 --> 44:38.960]  showdown this is big it's major it's you know heartening to see and this is the
[44:38.960 --> 44:42.880]  right country for it to happen in they don't belong here as I said it's
[44:42.880 --> 44:46.480]  retrograde to what they believe and you know they're what they're in the wrong
[44:46.480 --> 44:51.240]  environment and in it and it provides the right opportunity to present them
[44:51.240 --> 44:57.440]  with the right rebuke the right defense of the common man and it's time for the
[44:57.440 --> 45:00.800]  common man to win a few you know they they've had their day in the sun it's
[45:00.800 --> 45:05.080]  time for them to pack it in any other key points you'd like to add about what
[45:05.080 --> 45:08.880]  you've observed editor I know you work as a visiting editor in a lot of things
[45:08.880 --> 45:12.320]  in fact what is your title in American Free Press I know your radio talk show
[45:12.320 --> 45:17.280]  host to never be many times mark what's your time over there I'm editor Jim is
[45:17.280 --> 45:20.880]  at Jim Tucker's editor emeritus he's semi-retired but he still covers
[45:20.880 --> 45:25.120]  Bilderberg and I'm editor and we're a team now I'm sort of inheriting the
[45:25.120 --> 45:30.160]  baton from him more or less and well I think that what we're talking about today
[45:30.160 --> 45:34.880]  are the is the key development and what I talked about earlier where the
[45:34.880 --> 45:40.040]  legislator who's rebuking and confronting Bilderberg tried to get the
[45:40.040 --> 45:44.440]  local local and federal police from stopping Bilderberg from meeting here
[45:44.440 --> 45:47.640]  in the first place but maybe maybe it's almost better that didn't happen because
[45:47.640 --> 45:51.160]  if that didn't happen or if that would have happened had they not met here then
[45:51.160 --> 45:55.640]  we he wouldn't be evidently approaching them and you know confronting them with
[45:55.640 --> 46:02.120]  this letter so maybe this is the way God intended it you know and certainly I
[46:02.120 --> 46:06.760]  think that these specific issues that Bilderberg wants to discuss include
[46:06.760 --> 46:11.560]  whether to continue the wars in Afghanistan and Libya it always includes
[46:11.560 --> 46:18.400]  energy matters monetary matters you know will be I'm sure that meeting in
[46:18.400 --> 46:22.960]  Switzerland they're going to think about Switzerland being this you know
[46:22.960 --> 46:27.360]  odd man out and not not fitting into their global straitjacket you know
[46:27.360 --> 46:31.680]  everything everything is a lot less secret about Bilderberg than it used to
[46:31.680 --> 46:35.800]  be but it's still hard to discern of course unless you're in there exactly
[46:35.800 --> 46:40.000]  what they're talking about you know they do have a quasi-official website where
[46:40.000 --> 46:45.880]  they list a quasi-official set of topics but you know they're very misleading
[46:45.880 --> 46:48.920]  there's one in there right now on their official website something like
[46:48.920 --> 46:55.120]  Switzerland you know will it be successful in the future you know you
[46:55.120 --> 46:58.080]  could read that a lot of different ways you know real innocuous sounding
[46:58.080 --> 47:04.600]  topics and so it always sounds dry and and academic you know if you read their
[47:04.600 --> 47:08.720]  own literature but of course there's much more to it and the secrecy is the
[47:08.720 --> 47:17.240]  enduring problem so that's essentially what we've got so far and the rest is
[47:17.240 --> 47:22.160]  just a lot of legwork confirming who's there okay how well well mark let's
[47:22.160 --> 47:28.080]  there yeah mark Anderson we've got Jim Tucker on the line with us we're gonna
[47:28.080 --> 47:33.880]  let you go but stay close to my guys cuz I want to get you to pop in coming up
[47:33.880 --> 47:37.280]  later in the broadcast but mark thank you so much will continue to watch your
[47:37.280 --> 47:44.840]  work at americanfreepress.net thank you sir okay thank you sir here is Jim
[47:44.840 --> 47:49.880]  Tucker the original Bilderberg sleuth Jim good to have you here with us it's
[47:49.880 --> 47:56.040]  always a pleasure Jim how big is this that this top swish leader has sent the
[47:56.040 --> 48:02.080]  letter demanding that Kissinger basically be arrested and that the police
[48:02.080 --> 48:06.560]  follow the swiss constitution and honor the press and that he is now in the
[48:06.560 --> 48:10.680]  next few hours preparing to make his way there to try to basically force his way
[48:10.680 --> 48:13.960]  into the Bilderberg group meeting
[48:14.200 --> 48:22.720]  well the several people saw such a vehicle approach
[48:22.720 --> 48:29.120]  there's several ways they've been they can take it in the ambulance from the
[48:29.120 --> 48:35.200]  airplane to a car park somewhere else is slide in that way but Kissinger is
[48:35.200 --> 48:41.000]  definitely there yes now he's the heart of Bilderberg along with Rockefeller and
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.240]  Queen Beatrix well what do you make of the announcement that that this that
[48:45.240 --> 48:50.040]  this leader of a Canton I mean as high level as it gets other than the prime
[48:50.040 --> 48:54.160]  minister of Switzerland is going to confront them Jim have you heard this
[48:54.160 --> 49:02.320]  news yes Eric you guys been reported he has a confrontation and it should be a
[49:02.320 --> 49:09.120]  lot of fun to I guess you have to step outside the gates until we they come out
[49:09.120 --> 49:17.680]  because I've had it filled up inside and they could swim in jail if the bucks be
[49:17.680 --> 49:22.600]  lined in fact they have jail a couple of people already to try to walk through
[49:22.600 --> 49:29.160]  against orders so good guys passport away they're pretty rough but in in
[49:29.160 --> 49:35.960]  Switzerland though these canton leaders I mean it that'd be like speaker of the
[49:35.960 --> 49:40.520]  house or that'd be like Ron Paul you know showing up at a Bilderberg group
[49:40.520 --> 49:46.320]  meeting in Chantilly and demanding to be let in yes it'd be analogous to that
[49:46.320 --> 49:51.640]  certainly oh this is huge have you ever seen anything like this in your 35 years
[49:51.640 --> 50:06.200]  of covering the Bilderberg scum I tell you this is they if they were running
[50:06.200 --> 50:11.280]  scared earlier in the week jam you know they've heard of this do you think
[50:11.280 --> 50:16.080]  they're doing you know what they're in their underwear oh yes I'm sure they
[50:16.080 --> 50:23.640]  have bowel problems the starting lady way because we look out crowd cover
[50:23.640 --> 50:32.240]  keeping the helicopters away and not only the helicopters get to a
[50:32.240 --> 50:40.880]  statement so they had to love long distance driving and some planes were
[50:40.880 --> 50:47.080]  able to land in the small airport later but they were a full-day late getting
[50:47.080 --> 50:56.000]  started and they all have to duck in on a Monday because their cover meetings
[50:56.560 --> 51:02.400]  the NATO is one cover meeting as you know and that way the Secretary of
[51:02.400 --> 51:06.800]  Defense can duck in the Bilderberg they go home but the reason he is over here
[51:06.800 --> 51:12.280]  was NATO and no word mention about the Bilderberg meeting of course Jim in
[51:12.280 --> 51:17.200]  closing you got much of their internal agenda now big news in the US time
[51:17.200 --> 51:23.120]  magazine Newsweek CNBC drudge report comm congratulations on the great job
[51:23.120 --> 51:27.840]  that they've been picking up our reportage via you what what can you tell
[51:27.840 --> 51:32.280]  us any other intel from your moles we were told by some of the Swiss folks
[51:32.280 --> 51:36.440]  that that have moles that they're getting a lot of intel from the wait staff
[51:36.440 --> 51:40.400]  and others that are disgusted by Bilderberg
[51:40.400 --> 51:46.280]  yes and I'm having data conversation telephone conversations with not
[51:46.280 --> 51:54.760]  lowland side I'm allowed to say that he is on his side of both trial lateral
[51:54.760 --> 52:00.200]  and Bilderberg meetings I recognize the voice I don't know his name I don't
[52:00.200 --> 52:04.840]  want to know his name that's what we said it up years ago if they put you on
[52:04.840 --> 52:09.440]  torture rack I cannot name him because I really did not know his name I knew I
[52:09.440 --> 52:19.000]  know his voice and his information has always been proven proven by history I
[52:19.000 --> 52:26.440]  mean history's confirmed everything he's ever told me why do you think this
[52:26.440 --> 52:30.920]  mole for many I know more than a decade and then you also get the wait staff and
[52:30.920 --> 52:34.480]  others to later help you that's why you stay a few days after why do you think
[52:34.480 --> 52:39.200]  you were originally approached well I think this kind of side at Bilderberg
[52:39.200 --> 52:45.080]  also exposed is it probably agreed also that they're evil people that he's
[52:45.080 --> 52:54.960]  apparently on this staff of someone who is to both meetings and I don't know
[52:54.960 --> 52:59.280]  how old he is how young he is how fat short or tall he is I don't know that
[52:59.280 --> 53:05.760]  either that means upper cream though that for those that don't know if he's in
[53:05.760 --> 53:11.040]  both trial lateral and Bilderberg that's that steering committee level level
[53:11.040 --> 53:22.640]  Bilderberg that this person serves I don't understand what did the mole did
[53:22.640 --> 53:25.680]  the mole give you anything else that's on the agenda because there's always
[53:25.680 --> 53:29.440]  things that are off the agenda that are on the agenda did the mole tell you
[53:29.440 --> 53:37.400]  anybody that's off the list that's there oh yes there's several people who were
[53:37.400 --> 53:45.520]  not on the list as in the secretary defense case also Bill Gates the computer
[53:45.520 --> 53:52.000]  nerd himself made me there he's not on the Bilderberg list he's there and these
[53:52.000 --> 53:58.800]  people are 100% identified by sight we're 100% on that Hillary was in Europe
[53:58.800 --> 54:03.680]  until about a day ago she's now in Africa any intel on Hillary they're moving to
[54:03.680 --> 54:09.280]  get her into the World Bank any word on her sinking in for a few hours no we
[54:09.280 --> 54:15.560]  have had not learned that possible she has she did was was before as we just
[54:15.560 --> 54:19.120]  I think we discussed it yesterday that she attended the meeting and yes we did
[54:19.120 --> 54:25.400]  closing Jim Tucker any other intel that you can give us my friend on what is
[54:25.400 --> 54:29.680]  going on inside Bilderberg anything else your mole gave us the world is

[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:45.760]  and not a few people the the most rich people the most important people they can decide about
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:51.920]  the people we think it should come from the people uh we want freedom for the people and not
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:10:00.560]  this bilderberg now before we went to break you were talking about opposing the imf world bank
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:06.000]  can you explain to people what those systems are doing what the euro is doing and why the

[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:20.160]  know switzerland is not the member of the european union it's not the member of the euro we also
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:29.120]  tried to get out switzerland of the imf to stop this system that wants to it's a slavery of the
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.240]  currencies and we have we have to stop that we want freedom also for the currencies
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:43.200]  what can you tell us about the plans that we've been told of today uh for uh the man you called

[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:25.120]  happening live time and i'm the director of this so i am here on air uh from austin texas uh
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:31.760]  uh directing uh great patriots and and and and media people uh they're in their coverage of
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.720]  what's happening and talking to folks along with the rest of the crew uh helping in this uh
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:41.840]  symphony to bring you this information great job to the crew i am absolutely blown away
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:48.640]  by the coverage today i i would imagine you are this is so exciting you know i only did this one
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:53.200]  time on air about two years ago because it's such a big deal to my family and your family and
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:58.080]  everybody else who loves freedom uh anybody that doesn't want to be a slave the global is control
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:03.680]  the oil they control the carbon they've designed a carbon based system we are a carbon based planet
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:10.160]  uh and part of the carbon cycle is carbon dioxide water oxygen and sunlight and if they're able to
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:14.640]  control and tax any one of those it's over total domination and so here they are controlling the
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:19.200]  you know the main carbon system and then they're the same ones that want to restrict it to us through
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:24.560]  this system and when it came out with the emails and the premeditated lies and the fact that they
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:29.280]  know carbon's good and more carbon dioxide's good that the temperature is actually uh started
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:33.360]  dropping overall they can always show you some micro temperature increases but i can show you
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:39.360]  decreases the point is i had the guys go get champagne and pop it on air and i've obviously
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.120]  got a long trip ahead of me and a lot of work to do today so i'm not going to do that i'm not a big
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:50.080]  drinker but let me tell you tonight in new york i'm gonna go out to dinner with uh tomorrow night
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:55.680]  Gerald Salente but uh with ted anerson you better believe and i don't even like champagne that much
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:01.680]  there's going to be a bottle of expensive champagne being drunk because i mean this is this is awesome
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:09.840]  and we are about to see something that is so off the charts just absolutely fantastic i am
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:19.840]  am beside myself right now with glee um the huge dam breaking uh it is drudge report newsweek time
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:25.040]  bbc london guardian hundreds of other papers bill berg world government what are they talking
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:31.760]  about in there we've got the moles inside we've got the intel we've got live video and now three
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:36.400]  prominent one of them is is like i was looking him up the last few weeks i've read about him
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:41.840]  years ago he's bigger than ron paul in switzerland i mean the ron paul of switzerland very high
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:47.040]  level in the parliament right up beneath the prime minister is marching on bill berg today
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:51.760]  the prime minister came out it was in swiss papers we did screenshots of those put them on info wars
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:59.280]  dot com and prison planet dot com uh and they are getting uh you know well those are now up on the
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:03.440]  site with the headlines that the prime minister says they don't like the meeting happening there
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:09.680]  i mean it is a rebuke see with their trillions with their fancy suits with their Mercedes with
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:14.000]  their armed guards with all of this mystique and the helicopters everybody just bows down to them
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.320]  why they're crooks it's like bank of america thinking they can take houses without even
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:25.040]  having uh any type of uh deed or somebody buys the house in cash they have no history no claim
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:28.880]  they come and take it the court says well it's five months later we said give them their house back
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:35.200]  you haven't so we're gonna send deputies to seize your bank and take the cash out and pay them on
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:40.960]  the barrel head that's the people's court that's america that's switzerland that's what the dutch
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:45.680]  had that's real freedom nobody else ever had what the swiss have had nobody ever had what people
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:51.600]  in america had nobody ever had what the dutch had and they're taking it away it's a lie that our
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:57.520]  system came from the greeks and the romans there's a little bit of that in there it's swiss and people
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:02.800]  better get that through their head they want it the swiss are all given automatic weapons and hand
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:07.760]  grenades and and and and then they have yearly searches in the house to make sure the guns are
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:13.200]  hidden to make sure of a foreign government comes in your guns are so hidden our own gunfinders
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:18.000]  can't find them i mean that's what it's all about people like well what the one of the

[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:28.560]  grenade launchers the crime rate is not existent the and i'm telling you that's why it's happening

[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:12.080]  skelton has been arrested in years past is trying to cover bilderberg and he joins us a great
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.560]  reporter's we've been reading at the guardian also linked up at drudgerport.com charlie good to
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:22.480]  have you here with us it's very good to be here what do you make of this historic thing that's
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:27.600]  happening right now are you in the middle of it right now i'm not i've did a lot of historic
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:32.960]  things going on at the moment it seems that that's just one of them and there's actually three i think
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:37.360]  i'm told there's three sweet mps that are going that are currently there so that's quite a that's
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:42.960]  quite a number of serious people that are concerned about what's going on in their country
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:48.800]  well break down from your reportage what you think the most important points are
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:53.840]  oh my goodness well the most important thing that's just happened here is that uh
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.960]  the chancellor of the exchequer of britain great britain george osborne has just been
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:03.680]  confirmed as attending not as a private individual but as the chancellor of the exchequer in an
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:08.880]  official capacity so um and he's there with treasury staff and i presume that the british
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:14.480]  tax pay is paying for that and um so this raises an enormous number of questions because the treasury
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:20.080]  told me that uh he's here and he's meeting with uh other international foreign ministers
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:25.440]  so you've got a situation where the chancellor of the exchequer is meeting in an official capacity
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:31.040]  discussing presumably then policy with uh you know other with heads of state other finance
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:37.200]  ministers with the head of airbus with the you know head of deutscher bank with russian oligarch i mean
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:42.960]  you know what's going on and it's a four day very in-depth conference and and why exactly is that
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.680]  being that summit take us i think we can call it a summit taking place behind closed closed doors
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:56.240]  it's an absolute disgrace well charlie um what do you make of them putting up this giant shower
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:00.720]  curtain i thought it was a good piece you wrote excellent piece describing how guilty they act
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:07.520]  well i just find it do you know what i genuinely find it embarrassing i find it childish i mean
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:12.240]  you've probably seen them before yeah and i've seen them you see delegates arriving and they throw
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:17.040]  themselves to down the backseat of the car and they hold the newspaper up to their face and it's
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:21.200]  and you and you know they they duck down roll around and you think i'm thinking what are you
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:27.280]  doing you know you're behaving like it's grown up these are royalty fortune 500 elected politicians
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:31.200]  many of them breaking the law to be there that's why they're covering their faces up because for
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:35.200]  decades the media wouldn't admit this was real charlie what do you think now knowing because
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:40.640]  it's been in the news that bbc washington post were attending this decades ago and lying to their
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:46.160]  viewers and readers and telling them it didn't exist well you know what it's it's an extraordinary
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.640]  thing and you can feel another i've been doing this for three years so i'm i'm still a youngster
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:55.760]  in bill de berg term but even in that short time you can feel the pressure that's being put on the
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:01.360]  mainstream media from the uh let's call them the alternative media uh although there are some
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:06.640]  mainstream media but but from the pressure that's coming upwards and forcing upwards from the ground
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:11.040]  this story and saying look it's important look there are important people here look at them
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:16.000]  look here's a photograph i've got through a car window this is important this is ahead of the bank
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.920]  this is my foreign minister please pay attention mainstream media please pay attention we you know
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:27.520]  and and the force of it that is that there's so much determination you can see amongst the amongst
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:33.280]  the citizen journalists particularly the determination to make this story real by having it break
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:37.440]  it upwards into the mainstream media and i think it's happening it's just it's going to take some
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:41.280]  time it may not be this year but it's getting there it's getting there and you know when when the
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:45.200]  chance of the extrovert george oswald does something so stupid to attend this meeting and an official
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:49.920]  capacity rather than a private individual you know surely i'm just waiting on this it's just broken
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:54.320]  now surely the british media the very least they're going to pick up on this and if they don't then
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:58.880]  it's absolutely disgraceful i can't i'm just disgusted at the thought they went i tell you what
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:02.320]  i did the thing that well maybe he'll put a d notice out maybe you'll get the government
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:07.200]  d notice that you can't report go ahead you know i'm a good yeah well good luck with that i mean i
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:11.280]  don't know we've got freedom of information requests now and hopefully you know british
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:14.960]  because i'm putting them in and finding out you know what exactly were you talking about you have to
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:19.760]  tell us now by law you know you're not you're not george oswald you're george oswald mp chance
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:24.400]  for these checkers the big very very significant difference has just taken place and you know i did
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:28.560]  i did one of those things stay there charlie uh skelton one and guardian the biggest paper in
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:32.960]  europe arguably not just in england can you stay with us a little bit into the next segment

[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:04.640]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:08.960]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:13.600]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:18.880]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:24.720]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:30.000]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.640]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:40.000]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.400]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:31.360]  defaulted on the debt of course i told you that but it's now a fake oh my i mean this is huge
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:35.760]  i can't even believe this is happening this is it's all coming down charlie skelton do you not
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:41.520]  have the same feeling that everything the wars the implosions the depressions the corruption the
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:47.200]  scandals are just everything is racing now like they did in other times in history before world war
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:52.880]  one world war two can you not feel the electricity in the air charlie skelton yeah it's you know it's
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:57.120]  difficult because we're only here in the air now so to take a perspective like that but you know
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:01.520]  certainly there's stuff happening and when you say something like the the story about the the
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:07.280]  chinese debt um the default it's very interesting to note that there's two um chinese delegates
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:12.400]  to build a book which i believe is fairly unusual and i believe that's the first time i think there's
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:17.120]  been a chinese businessman there before yeah no this is big this is big pow wow and you know they've
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:25.040]  got a chinese professor for economics from p king university and you know and that's why you just
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:31.280]  wouldn't expect that really from building but you know maybe you know maybe there's a crisis going on
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:36.080]  not just for for us for you and me maybe there's a bigger crisis going on i don't know that will
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:41.200]  be nice any other key points what well what's coming up next in your incredible uh reportage give us
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.760]  any of your websites or places where we can find out more about the great job you do
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:51.200]  well just go to the guardian website guardian.co.uk and have a have a look at the news uh and you know
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:55.040]  so we'll in fact search build a book because there's not much out there to be quite honest um
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:00.000]  so it should pop up fairly easily um it's uh we're about to head up the hill and see what
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.760]  effect is going to happen and you're absolutely right there would be extraordinary absolutely
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:08.960]  extraordinary if three mps marched up to the police cordon i mean i just don't know what they're
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.680]  going to know that they've told me they're doing it and uh they've also told uh the gentleman that
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:19.600]  was with the other swiss minister that they are doing it and the big cheese is set to arrive
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:26.480]  here in just the next 20 30 minutes or so they may get organized but they're right up at that public
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:31.280]  building right up the street because the swiss get together they don't just watch tv all day they
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:35.520]  actually you know hang out at local community areas and you know drink beer and play games
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:39.040]  evil type folks they all have guns what are they going to do are they going to push a gun into the
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:45.200]  chest of the of a swiss mp i mean are we going to do that who is going to do that i said it was
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.800]  interesting someone told me uh here a guy called manfred is an amazing guy you should have on the
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:54.640]  show you know more than i did by a factor of a hundred um he uh he said that they he worked out
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:59.760]  that they they've brought in a lot of east german security uh to cover it because he's swiss and he
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:04.240]  recognized the accident and he's been recognized the you know that's the company it is east german
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:09.760]  again a throwback to the stasi that's who they've got to get but isn't that always the way you if
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:13.440]  you're trying to police your own country you can't you have to do it outside is because they don't

[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:54.800]  happen in the next hour i've got to go catch an airplane uh but i'm going to have erin dykes and
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:59.920]  paul watson from the demonstration live on cell phones and with live video feeds from the cell
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:04.560]  phones by the way to upload one two minute videos costing us 500 bucks we did we tried to find a
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:09.040]  better plan but that's what it's costing so please buy books and videos and tapes and stuff from us
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:13.520]  this stuff's very expensive ted paid for part of it but this has gone way over on our budget
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:17.440]  so please support us buy some books dvds things like that at info wars dot com
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:21.440]  i've been plugging in the sponsors today or all week i'm just out of control but uh it
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:26.960]  doesn't matter history's happening bob are you beside yourself with uh joy right now at what
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:34.240]  is about to happen i certainly am and i'd love to see the conga uh the uh the confrontation
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:40.800]  between these security guards and the members of the swiss parliament uh that ought to be very
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:47.040]  interesting uh they speak the same language uh although the swiss usually speak three or more
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:52.240]  languages and i've lived there for a long time well by the way leaders are supposed to lead members
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:56.400]  of parliament congress are supposed to march into corrupt meetings and get people's faces
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:00.560]  they're supposed to turn over the money changers tables this is what america is supposed to be
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:07.200]  all about bob and that's what we should be doing and we're not doing that in our country and it's
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:13.920]  uh very very disappointing well at least the swiss some of the swiss are up front they're
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:20.880]  going to make an issue out of it uh i think probably the one of the main things that going to be
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:25.920]  talking about at the bill de berger meeting is the problem that they have in europe with the
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:30.960]  six countries that are in trouble particularly greece how are we going to handle it and the
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:38.800]  tables have actually been turned on the bankers because if they don't offer the greeks a super
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:46.800]  duper deal no collateralization low interest rates give us a break they're going to default if they
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:53.360]  default all the big banks in europe go down it's as simple as that and now they don't know what to
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:43:01.280]  do they pushed hard on the other end they lost because the people over there realized because
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:08.720]  alex jones and max kaiser and bob Chapman they went on the radio etc etc over there and flowing
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:14.560]  the people over the last year or so and now they're confronting them and they don't know what to do
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:24.720]  in another matter did you notice a couple of days ago uh mr blank fine who's the head of jp
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:33.440]  morgan chase he's the one that tells us he's doing god's work uh he told mr barnanke that
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:40.480]  we don't want this three percent uh reserve that we hold have to hold apart because
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:46.560]  what he meant to say was we want to gamble with the money we can't do that if you do that and
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:55.600]  so there's consternation there and the ideas of barnanke on reserves have come from the bank for
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:03.520]  international settlements which is the bankers bank and if they you know if anything goes haywire
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:09.120]  you're going to need as much money as you as you have you can't risk losing it in the interim
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:17.760]  so we get that going on as well so we get plenty of things that reflect internal problems
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:20.240]  among the bill de burg as we'll call them
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:27.360]  bob what do you make of the chinese uh that i've never seen at bill de burg never seen
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:32.160]  chinese we've seen arab's a few times one time there was a multi-billionaire chinese
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:38.080]  businessman there years ago but to have uh one of their top economists there and a government
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:44.160]  minister there that shows the showdown is on and we have afp french news agency reporting
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:50.880]  china's rating houses say us is defaulting as we kept saying the defaults on via the hyperinflation
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:56.480]  the qe2 going into qe3 everything we've talked about is now just coming out in the open the chinese
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:01.040]  are getting hopping mad i mean the russians by the way of course are not in the meeting
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:08.480]  uh this is incredible what do you make of that development well uh i can if you remember
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:14.080]  monti hall on television let's make a deal well that's why the chinese are there
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:21.120]  the americans are going to tell them that's why kissing is there too uh supposedly the uh
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:27.040]  negotiator extraordinaire uh they're going to try to make some sort of a deal where the chinese
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:34.240]  aren't mad at them anymore uh you know everything is so up in the air uh you you've got this
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:43.200]  mini war going on in congress particularly in house of representatives in the extension
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:53.440]  of the short term debt that will be allowed for the united states government and if there is not
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:46:02.240]  an agreement what's going to happen is that they're going to continue to use pension funds from the
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:10.080]  federal pension and perhaps even try to take over 401ks and iras and in that process they're
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:15.920]  going to have to continue to fund internally or they're going to have some serious problems
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:23.760]  and that is unsettling to them because they have always gotten their way they're not getting it
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:31.920]  right now on that issue and many others well said bob uh looking at other news they've
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:38.320]  launched a new war u.s is intensifying a secret campaign of yemen airstrikes uh we've got um
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:44.640]  it seems like all hell is breaking loose they're now admitting there's massive shootouts
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:50.560]  routinely on the u.s uh texas mexico border uh the state police in texas are refusing to cover
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:54.800]  it up anymore putting out press releases members of the u.s congress are saying there is a cover
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:47:01.040]  up about the war in mexico it's over what 30 000 dead now in the last two years armored vehicles
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:06.960]  rocket attacks kidnappings are exploding all over the southwest in the u.s more and more they're
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:10.720]  having to admit we're in a depression not a recession i mean they're not going to be able
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:16.960]  to cover up what's going on much longer i mean all hidey so i think you're absolutely right alex
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:25.680]  and you know that's been promulgated by us getting on and talking about the truth this is
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:33.440]  really what's going on and it's seeping in to the major media they can't hold it back
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:41.600]  i mean i just saw two things on cnn by jack cavity whatever i think that's his name
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:49.520]  it sounded like us and so we're seeping in the truth is seeping in and they're not going to
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:54.160]  be able to hold it back i've got to make an announcement here if i could have done this
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:58.080]  all over again i always attempt as hard as i can to do what i say i'm going to do
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:03.680]  it and i agreed three four months ago to be the keynote speaker at talkers and didn't notice
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:08.160]  that belterberg was at that same time didn't think and it's important to talk to all the major radio
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:12.160]  ceo's and program directors because we'll we're getting like three affiliates a week i'm told
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:15.920]  the fact that i'm keynote speaker once usually limbaugh or hanity we'll probably get like a
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:21.520]  hundred 200 affiliates in the next couple months from this so it's important but in my gut if i
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:26.720]  could go back now i wish that i would have pulled out of this talkers thing because i i wish i was
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:31.040]  there where they're getting ready to march on belterberg watson and erin dykes via video phone
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:36.640]  and regular phone are gonna be with the swiss parliamentarians as they march up uh this is
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:42.320]  so off the chart and drudge report our report went live five minutes ago drudge is already linked to
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:48.320]  it uh as the top store in the left hand side swiss politicians to march on belterberg meeting
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:53.520]  demand arrest of kissinger we actually have the video on our justin tv it's in the breaking news
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:58.080]  section of info wars dot com breaking belterberg news we're gonna get those videos added to that
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:04.000]  of the swiss member of parliament just 500 yards away from the hotel being interviewed we have the
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.400]  video of it while he was on the phone with us so people think this is a joke and the other two
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:11.920]  members of parliament are arriving one of them is the equivalent of ron paul over there this is
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:16.960]  going to be big this is going to be big big big and i've got to get on the phone during the break
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:22.000]  with erin and paul make sure they know uh that i want them right in there behind them when they go
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:27.040]  in i mean right in there right beside lucredowski and look how it was we are changed that wrote the
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:32.080]  letter to the member of parliament saying we're being abused and then the letter from parliament
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:36.080]  ordering the cops to back off and not let the east german security goons they fire that's
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:39.840]  so they hired an actual east german company uh you know they know how to do it even though it's
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:44.800]  still east and west it's the east german folks uh not the east germans are bad overall but
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:48.880]  they're security people and they're telling you back off you don't put your hands on people
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:54.160]  this is not soviet russia or nazi germany and it says we are changed right in the letter in german
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:58.560]  in the parliament saying you back off you understand we are changed now with parliament
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:05.440]  telling them telling the police you treat we are changed real nice what do you make of that bob i mean
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:10.960]  this is incredible this is liberty rising i felt in my gut the other night when i made a video called
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:15.920]  billderberg the fall of billderberg that that something magic was going to happen and i think
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:20.160]  this is the beginning of the fall of billderberg i gotta tell folks i got a spidey sense i don't
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:27.040]  talk about it and my spidey sense has just been beside itself right now bob well i think alex
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:33.760]  this could be the untoward event that really wasn't expected that could be the catalyst
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:40.720]  that could bring this whole house of cards down uh he could make a run on on the europeans on
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:47.520]  greece and and it could be tremendous ramifications oh hold on i'm having i'm having i'm actually
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:53.360]  see folks drugs mimic natural endorphins i mean it's like i just injected heroin cocaine pcp

[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:06.080]  bob chappan bob i want to give people a general history of the boulderberg group from your research
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:10.560]  why are they the enemy why should we care their meeting in secret bob chappan for the last four
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:17.040]  minutes of this segment you have the floor their history goes back a thousand years that we know of
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:26.640]  the boulderberg meeting was first in holland put on by the queen and her father prince barnard
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:35.120]  who happens to have been an ss officer and that was at the boulderberg hotel i believe it was
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:42.480]  naive in 1952 and 1954 and each year they've evolved and had their quote secret readings
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:50.720]  which are no longer secret and uh you know fellows like jim tucca who i have known and known of for
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:57.920]  years uh we've kind of followed the same general path and um he's put a tremendous amount of work
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:07.440]  into this uh i've been reporting for really a a shorter time than he has and and it must be
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:16.720]  because it is for me a great great feeling to see this happen i know you alex are
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:24.560]  uh giddy uh over the success that these people have brought us by uh pushing the things it's
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:30.080]  like watching one of their main capital ships blow up folks politically this they are being
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:34.400]  exposed as the criminals they are we're pulling them down they're no longer these gods up on
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:41.680]  mount olympus with their little queen you know crowns to impress us this is the spirit of 1776
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:47.600]  and i just watched one of their main capital ships this is very embarrassing for them blow up and
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:52.640]  every month we gain more momentum on them i mean do you agree this is a this is like the
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:59.280]  battleship yamamoto blowing up a seminal event there's no question and you've got all these other
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:05.360]  small events going on uh the arguments that are going on the dominic striak straws kind
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:12.000]  episode within will call them the bill de berger group and it is the there's dissension he wanted
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:17.120]  to decide what china he wanted to decide what china and new europe teaming up with them this is a
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:21.040]  this may be one of the most important bill de berger's ever where you got the chai coms
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:25.600]  who have never been there uh it's usually only europeans a few arabs might be let in
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:31.280]  i mean this is off the charts to have the americans and the europeans allowing a top government minister
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:37.920]  and their top yeah economic advisor into there what does that signify bob it signifies that they
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:44.800]  have to be included the europeans at least some of them want to work with the chinese in a very
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:50.800]  positive way uh the americans really don't want to and they're in debt to them would make which
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:55.840]  makes it even worse and then the chinese are coming out and saying you know america's broke
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:04:02.000]  they're bankrupt uh they're not going to service their debt and the chinese are right i mean this
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:10.080]  is about truth and that's what they're saying uh we opened the door for them and they came in they
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:17.440]  knew that there would be a price that they'd have to pay in order to get most favored nation treatment
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:25.600]  uh be allowed to uh be in wto and then create the tremendous you know of manufacturing that
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:29.920]  they have yeah the globalists thought they were co-opping the chinese but the chinese are long
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:35.520]  term players they're going to find out the opposite and that's a very very good point
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:43.760]  long term players they are the ones that always win and washington and london have been at least
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:49.520]  in the last 10 or 15 years short term players and bob you and i you've been fighting the global

[02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:52.640]  we basically got eyewitnesses to all of this and we'll try and get them on the air as and when
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:58.960]  possible um but it's pretty hectic as you can tell yeah the EU member of paul attempted to enter the
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:05.440]  bill the burg hotel um and according to eyewitnesses he was shoved to the ground and blooded his
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:12.400]  nose uh one even said that they broke his nose and his name was mario or gazio and that is already in
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:18.160]  uh i believe the guardian i think it's charlie skelton but it might be somebody else uh in the
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:25.120]  guardian that's reported that um also just literally two minutes ago he was talking to alex
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:31.760]  from info creek and he was saying that um there was a standoff down at the hotel where some protesters
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:38.400]  tried to um go down because there's an area above the police tape which is on a hill which is where
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:42.320]  me and erin were filming from earlier with the helicopter footage we've actually got a bill
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:48.960]  the burg member entering and leaving that helicopter video and alex said that um there was a standoff
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:54.960]  between demonstrators and the police there but it it started to get quite ugly and uh i think
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:19:00.320]  we're going to get alex from info creek on the air right now to explain that because he was an
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:10.400]  eyewitness to it and uh he can explain it in more detail so um we saw this uh we saw this um a little
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:17.840]  group trying to walk towards the hotel it's they walked from top down the grassy hill the police
[02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:22.800]  confirmed to us it's private we're not supposed to be there but a lot we're not allowed to be there
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:29.040]  and to these guys they were bright yellow vests so they made a point to be seen they were not
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:34.640]  sneaking in they were walking right up there and there's one security checkpoint with uh police
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:40.320]  and a police dog and uh you saw them gathering their troops and kind of not not really knowing
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:46.240]  what to do uh and they brought the dogs and so it's it's one of my guys shooting all of this
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:53.920]  i got most of it on on tape and i i can't i can't i don't want to go into more details because um

[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:35.280]  and i'm totally outraged at the way they beat back the press uh the fact that they've
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:40.480]  actually bloody the nose of a european parliament member uh but it's going to backfire on the
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:45.360]  bill de berg group because when a tyranny shows its tyranny and starts to use violence against
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:51.600]  nonviolent people you're going to get the gondy effect you're going to get uh the blatant show of
[02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:58.000]  force uh demonstrating how tyrannical how anti-democratic uh the bill de berg group and other people
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:04.160]  other ilk are it's totally outrageous at the same time local activists here in switzerland
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:10.400]  like dominique sitting next to me and like the elected representatives in the swiss parliament
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:17.680]  or the swiss body they've really done good work in writing a letter putting the police on notice
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:24.480]  not to intimidate the press to allow people to freely express themselves to film the buildings
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:29.520]  of film police around them and to show what's going on uh though they meet in secret though
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:34.080]  they don't make a public statement the bill de berg group are a tyrannical force is using
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:39.040]  various forms of violence directly through the police force but around the world
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:45.440]  their economic sinks their economic policies that's a form of violence uh beating down the
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:51.760]  living standards of people as they consolidate wealth and control political power uh throughout the
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:58.080]  business and political world uh other news in the united states two of the biggest politicians
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:03.520]  hillary clinton and texas governor rick perry uh though they are not attending here at the
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:09.440]  bill de berg group uh they are uh and a part of rick perry he's announced that he's most likely
[02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:15.520]  going to run for president right now they're kind of floating media statements uh gathering buzz
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:21.920]  the new gingrich campaign has totally fallen flat it gained no traction at all uh partly because of
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:26.960]  him speaking out against representative ryan's budget and also just the fact that he's a well
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:32.160]  known shill for the globalist movements uh although he's not been firmly with the bill de berg group
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:36.880]  he's still quite in lockstep with their agenda he's been for carbon taxes all that has worked
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:43.680]  against new gingrich and so we've seen his uh very high powered uh political advisors leaving
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:49.200]  his campaign and getting ready to get behind texas governor rick perry and that's very important
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:55.760]  because in 2007 rick perry flew over to his standbill joined the bill de berg group met with them
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:02.960]  and he has effectively been pre-selected he's been feted as a good potential presidential
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:09.040]  candidate and he's most likely going to be running in 2012 uh that's further important but
[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:14.480]  that's further important because rick perry has really put on airs of being a grassroots
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:20.160]  conservative of being a sort of tea party-esque person his statements about succession so get
[02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:27.280]  ready to see him be preaching the rhetoric of the grassroots while working entirely for the
[02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:32.160]  globalist at the same time helery clinton has announced she wants to be the next head of the
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:37.840]  world bank every head of the world bank uh for the last while has been a member of bill de berg
[02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:43.280]  from wilferson to wilful wits to robert solik and now if helery clinton does become the next
[02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:47.920]  world bank president it'll be very challenging she's been to at least at least three bill de
[02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:53.520]  berg meetings we'll be back after the break info works dot com we're on the march the empires on

[02:33:12.960 --> 02:33:19.840]  wars dot com this is alex reporting live from san maritz switzerland we have a rare opportunity
[02:33:19.840 --> 02:33:24.960]  today because they're literally more than 100 activists here at a live speaking event which
[02:33:24.960 --> 02:33:30.720]  is in all german which is why we're not covering it directly we've had on members of the swiss
[02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:36.000]  parliament perhaps we're expecting another arrival of a swiss parliament member dominic
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:43.200]  medic intimate imminently hopefully he will come on we also have luke radowski coming up and other
[02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:48.960]  activists we were just talking about some of the high level u.s politicians who've previously been
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:54.080]  to bill de berg meetings who are now moving up to higher positions one of them is texas governor
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:34:01.200]  rick perry a very close bush minion uh... who uh... was made if you will by carl rove back in the
[02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:06.480]  mid eighties he used to be a democrat carl rove commenced him along with people senator phil
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:14.240]  graham to flip to republican and he only has gained in power and acumen since rick perry is now the
[02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:19.440]  longest serving texas governor also hillary clinton has announced today it's been on the top of the
[02:34:19.440 --> 02:34:24.800]  drug report uh... the biggest alternative news website anywhere in the world that she wants to
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:30.080]  be the next head of the world bank uh... sure that would be a milestone for it to be the first woman
[02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:35.200]  but she's entirely a bill de berg minion and total globalist just like her husband bill clinton
[02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:40.800]  just as he is announced he wants to be the head of the united nations hillary clinton now wants the
[02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:47.200]  power of a huge bank that works in conjunction with the i m f uh... to really put third world
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:53.920]  countries developing countries into economic enslavement uh... really continuing what used to be
[02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:59.840]  a colonialism pattern and now uh... through the bailouts and other arrangements in europe uh many
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:06.080]  of these countries are being brought to bear switzerland itself is fighting in an island of the e u
[02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:12.560]  not to accept the e u currency not to join the european union to keep their sovereignty and why
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:16.880]  not they have one of the highest living standards anywhere in the world uh... so we should stand
[02:35:16.880 --> 02:35:21.760]  with the switzerland people there's really great weird change activist group here on the ground in
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:26.080]  switzerland uh... from all the different major cities really incredible even though they have
[02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:30.320]  so the big globalist banks like the bank international settlement uh... but it would be
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:35.680]  really interesting if hillary took the world bank position of course uh... the past several
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:40.480]  world bank heads have all been bill de berg attendees most of them perennial most of them
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:47.120]  every single year that includes james wolfinson uh... a multi-generational servant of the ross
[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:53.360]  child family it includes neocon poll wolfowitz who had his own world bank scandal and had to step down
[02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:59.680]  a few uh... years ago when they introduced robert zollick also of course a big globalist minion
[02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:04.560]  now tell you when we're to take the position uh... that would be key uh... other
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:09.280]  uh... and other news uh... we have received the list of his leaked earlier today it's on
[02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:15.280]  info wars dot com it's been on fraud report dot com as one of the top links and uh...
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:20.720]  besides we know one part of their agenda is of course to perpetuate the war in levia
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:25.680]  as they look to other regions in the middle east uh... that's been part of their long-term plan of
[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:32.000]  course we've just witnessed the arab spring uh... with protest violent protest crackdowns
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:39.840]  all kinds of shifting geopolitical uh... acts of significance in egypt anesia uh... syria lebanon
[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:45.920]  uh... united arab Emirates the different parts of the peninsula there and uh... we know from
[02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:50.800]  last year in two thousand ten they've leaked on the official bill deberg meeting site that
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:56.000]  there was a discussion of from obama to the i don't have it in front of me i don't have
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:01.200]  the exact words but it was about from obama to the path to the iranian revolution uh...
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:07.440]  using new social media uh... including twitter and other aspects and uh... we know there's
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:12.480]  been meetings in the u.s. propping up some of the revolutionaries in the area of the world
[02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:17.920]  and coinciding with that we really have a powerhouse of the internet empire
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:24.800]  here at the meeting we have uh... among them excuse me one moment why i can solve the list
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:36.160]  we have the facebook co-founder chris hughes uh... we have also craig mundy of microsoft
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:41.920]  there's also the bill deberg steering member peter feal uh... he's the paypal executive
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:48.400]  he's also a big investor in facebook uh... actually quite interestingly he also endorsed
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:54.480]  ron paul in 2007 uh... he's a bit of a libertarian but also a hedge fund manager and obviously
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:59.520]  they're trying to control uh... the online dominion and as well as influence all these
[02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:04.880]  social revolutions particularly in the middle east so that's another area to watch as we
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:09.280]  get more information out of the two thousand eleven meeting of course down on the ground
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:15.200]  we've seen an incredible police response crackdown uh... they've just we've just received reports
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:20.880]  that they've challenged protesters uh... on the line a few minutes ago uh... reports last night
[02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:26.160]  that a member of the italian e-u parliament uh... tried to enter the meeting he was pushed down
[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:31.520]  and his nose was bloodied uh... so that's just incredible tyranny and uh... i think bill deberg
[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:36.640]  is going to see a gondy like response uh... but moving on we have uh... sitting next to me
[02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:41.360]  luke radowski he's the founder of weird change and have been an incredible activist
[02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:47.200]  uh... for the past several years and he of course is also as a part of that been covering bill deberg
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:52.560]  for uh... what is it luke the past three of the past four years too many years too many years now
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:56.960]  yeah we're all uh... deep in the trenches at this point so i'm going to pass the phone to you luke
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:02.320]  tell us some of your observations here and what do you expect to see as the outcome from bill deberg
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:08.320]  not only this year but in the future as just incredible uh... focus and attention media
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:13.760]  attention is put on them uh... turning around the paradigm showing who they are luke radowski
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:20.320]  i think it's very amazing to see each year how much the media coverage of this event gets bigger
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:25.680]  and bigger every year we go on and right now we are seeing the growth of the alternative media that
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:31.520]  is covering this bill deberg group meeting from top to bottom and it's just amazing seeing not the
[02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:36.400]  mainstream media that's controlled by the corporations but the people of this world showing everybody
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:41.840]  else well with one youtube video with a facebook post or twitter post exactly what's happening
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:45.920]  and that's where people are getting most of the majority of their information and i have to say
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:50.320]  we are the mainstream media it's no longer we're trying to become it we actually have become it
[02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:56.000]  because most of our information is given and shared throughout the world and it's just beautiful i mean
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:00.880]  there's so many great activists here from all walks of life there's people with kids here there's older
[02:40:00.880 --> 02:40:06.080]  people there's young people and it's just beautiful seeing so many different people of all walks of
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:11.600]  life coming together to document what's happening here i wouldn't even call this a protest that
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:16.880]  everybody has a dslr camera around their neck everybody has professional camera equipment
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:21.120]  picture equipment and we're here just trying to show the world what's happening and it's just
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:29.520]  beautiful with the potential and so much amazing things that we could just show people without
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:34.640]  any corporate mainstream media saying oh no you can't talk about this there's so many we are
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:39.120]  changed chapters here it's even hard to list i can't even keep track of all of them and we are
[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:43.520]  changed what salin is doing an amazing job down here they organized an amazing event that we're at
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:48.240]  right now they have also wrote their local politicians exactly what's happening the
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:53.440]  harassment that has been going on i've been here for about two days now and i already got my passport
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:41:00.080]  taken away i already got detained i already got threatened with arrest and deportation from the
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:05.040]  country just because i'm here filming what's going on and the question has to be asked that these
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:11.040]  so-called rich people don't have nothing to hide and aren't doing anything sinister
[02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:14.800]  wine world are they treating people who want to cover this event who want to
[02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:19.920]  document what's happening here being treated like criminals and they're pretty much protecting
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:25.440]  this place like fort nox and it's just crazy what's happening i've been actually traveling all over
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:30.800]  europe uh the last couple days and i've been in france i've been in spain covering major protests
[02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:35.920]  and i have to say people in france people in spain they all heard of the bill the bird group i've
[02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:40.320]  talked to random people on the streets i've talked to people at protests many people would know what
[02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:44.720]  the bill the bird group is many people are sick of the left and right paradigm many people just
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:49.440]  want to be left alone they want these big banksters these big banksters they're here secretly meeting
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:53.120]  they want them out of their lives they don't want all their money to go to them they want
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:59.120]  freedom they want liberty and i was shocked and amazed to see the true spirit the true ideas that
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:05.280]  we've been pushing forward for many years now so alive here in europe there's such a disconnect
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:12.160]  between us and the european americans and the people over here have so many interests so many
[02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:16.720]  goals in common i mean we're all just people are overall and we all just want the same thing in life
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:21.120]  we just want to be left alone with our life liberty and freedom and these people here are
[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:25.760]  suffering just like we are here i was in paris france and the steel square covering the major
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:32.880]  campot protests where hundreds if not thousands of protesters were tear gas were beaten by french
[02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:37.840]  police officers just because they wanted to camp out in their square to show solidarity with a
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:45.360]  spanish movement uh that started in Barcelona spain and is now all over uh spain and major
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:50.960]  city squares where people are coming together and are camping out in their city square in protest
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:55.280]  of the economic failures and economic terrorism being committed against them by their very own
[02:42:55.280 --> 02:43:01.680]  government just like in america spain bailed out their major banks gave out all their money to them
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:06.720]  and the people are suffering the people are sick of politicians and and i haven't even you know
[02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:10.960]  there's of course there's some leftists and some right wingers in the crowd but the majority of
[02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:16.240]  the crowd in spain in france in the resistance movement in the protest movement they are sick of
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:21.760]  both the left and the right they are not political at all they are just people wanting to be free
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:26.320]  and live their lives and i'm going to be traveling all over all over europe i'm leaving frayland
[02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:32.000]  actually today i'm going to be in scotland england prog amstan poland i'm going to go back to madrid

[02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:48.080]  we are change a lot if i have a lot more to show everybody and i'm still just shocked and amazed
[02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:54.000]  how many people are in spirit are in truth with us just like we are in the united states this is
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:57.920]  not just the resistance movement in the united states it's a global resistance movement against
[02:43:57.920 --> 02:44:03.040]  the big bank big banksters the big corporate heads the big elite that rule things in secret
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:06.800]  and decide everything and decide our lives like they are right now behind us at this bill the
[02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:13.200]  burden and we are sick of it and it's just an incredible beautiful time to be alive right
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:18.880]  now and i truly believe i'm very optimistic optimistic that we can take back this future
[02:44:18.880 --> 02:44:24.720]  we can make our destiny and we can be successful in this info war and we are being successful
[02:44:24.720 --> 02:44:29.840]  this is the first step amazing things are happening prosecutors are looking into arresting
[02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:36.640]  henry kissinger for crimes this is just an amazing beautiful time and a lot more greater
[02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:44.800]  things are coming i that's all i believe it i'm here and here you go thank you luke i also
[02:44:44.800 --> 02:44:50.160]  wanted to speak for a minute i've just bumped into paul doran he's from romania and he actually
[02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:55.680]  gave us footage four years ago for endgame the movie when he traveled to istanbul and why is
[02:44:55.680 --> 02:45:01.920]  that important because 10 years ago five years ago 20 years ago 30 years ago jim tucker was
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:08.000]  virtually the only reporter on the ground now there's just a decentralized movement of activists
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:13.600]  all over the world people we don't know personally everyone is showing up wherever these meetings are
[02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:18.400]  and trying to put the spotlight on this group i want to pass the phone out to paul doran who
[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:23.920]  please tell us what it's been like to cover bill de berg in the past four years and what you've
[02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:32.080]  learned so far this year i just arrived only a few hours ago paul doran hello alec and everyone
[02:45:32.960 --> 02:45:40.880]  i'm glad to to be here and uh i'm so surprised to to find so many people gathered here i wasn't
[02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:47.680]  expecting so many people here today uh what can i say uh in the past five years since i started
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:57.040]  covering the meetings i started seeing seeing more and more people coming together and especially
[02:45:57.040 --> 02:46:07.520]  which is more important the media like russia today have started to come this year again last year
[02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:15.120]  they were in spain and hopefully they will come next year so i hope i will be able to
[02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:24.720]  go next year to gather events and cover the deliver meetings and i hope that other people will be able
[02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:32.720]  to come and support us and start doing what i started to do five years ago when basically in
[02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:45.600]  istanbul i was almost alone with jim talker doing photos and pictures okay so i hope we'll have more
[02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:57.840]  information in the next couple of days so i'll give you back my website is www.infocon.ro is
[02:46:57.840 --> 02:47:06.320]  the romanian news website and hopefully we'll have some information there about new information
[02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:13.920]  in our language thank you very much paul and it's it's it's exciting this is not about media stars
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:19.440]  it's about uh decentralized activists going to the scenes of the crime and covering what's really
[02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:25.280]  happened while the lamestream media particularly in the us sits on its hands and pretends it knows
[02:47:25.280 --> 02:47:30.160]  nothing about the proceedings going on it is a little bit different here in europe particularly
[02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:36.560]  in switzerland nearly every paper whether small or large has been covering the event in one form
[02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:42.800]  or another some of them have been downplaying it is a conspiracy oh nothing's going on but others
[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:47.360]  have been doing more serious reporting the one thing guardian of course has been covering
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:52.240]  the meeting in the last several years that is exciting it's important to note that there's
[02:47:52.240 --> 02:48:00.960]  a protest tomorrow saturday that is june 11th here in san mariz switzerland and everyone should come
[02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:05.680]  down everyone who love liberty should come and let the builder of our group know uh we don't
[02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:10.240]  approve of their meeting in secret we don't approve of the globalist agenda we know they're
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:14.480]  following uh and it's although they meet in secret and don't tell us what they're talking about it's
[02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:18.960]  quite simple you look up the names you look up their bios you see what they're involved in
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:23.760]  and you will witness the company and then you could start fighting against it so there's a
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:29.680]  protest tomorrow that is june 11th in san mariz switzerland everyone who's with them the sound
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:34.960]  of this phone somewhere in the continent of europe uh or even if you're further away if you can make
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:40.960]  it you should come down it's vital that we show them that there is a resistance and we we don't
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:44.960]  approve of what's going on i'm going to hand the phone back now to paul joseph watson
[02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:52.560]  paul joseph watson here yeah we're talking about tomorrow at noon we want to see everybody here
[02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:58.560]  basically from central europe even further afield if you can make it there's going to be a massive
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:03.920]  protest at noon and the good thing about it is that it's going to involve both the young
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:10.080]  socialist from the left here in switzerland and also the swiss peoples party which is the
[02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:15.120]  conservative uh wing there of the political movement in switzerland so no matter what your
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:20.800]  political persuasion we want to see everybody here tomorrow at noon for the big bilderberg
[02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:26.880]  protest the police we've had reports that roughing up EU parliament members as you just heard um
[02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:34.320]  just literally in the last hour we've had reports from alex of info krieg of a standoff of protesters
[02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:40.000]  and police down there just above the hill where you can get a direct sight line onto the bilderberg
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:45.360]  chopper landing pad and we want to see everybody there tomorrow of course we were talking to
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:51.040]  lucas rhyman of the swiss peoples party um in the last hour and he was saying that basically
[02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:56.320]  the whole premise behind bilderberg their whole mindset their whole agenda the fact that they hide
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:50:03.920]  their faces in shame as the black towel tinted window cars drive past us that is totally the
[02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:09.600]  opposite to what switzerland as the country stands for um this beautiful country of direct democracy
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:16.640]  people deciding on their own destiny and yet we have this gaggle of 120 shameful criminals there
[02:50:17.280 --> 02:50:22.640]  plotting to decimate the world plotting to install their post industrial revolution
[02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:28.320]  which will cripple the living standards of the west also continue the um decimation of the third

[02:54:06.160 --> 02:54:14.320]  i was a highway man along the coach roads i did ride okay we are back alive at info wars dot com
[02:54:14.320 --> 02:54:20.080]  i am eric dykes reporting from san maritz Switzerland the site of the 2011 builderburg
[02:54:20.080 --> 02:54:25.360]  meeting i want to hit three very important points before we end this broadcast the most important
[02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:31.760]  of which is we are going to have a special broadcast live again tomorrow at 1 p.m. central
[02:54:32.480 --> 02:54:40.480]  texas time that is 8 p.m. here in switzerland we are going to have a protest tomorrow we want
[02:54:40.480 --> 02:54:44.960]  everyone to come out and we're going to report live on what transpired throughout the day
[02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:50.800]  another important point we were discussing earlier all the technological gurus and
[02:54:50.800 --> 02:54:56.080]  uh dominionists who are running the new online stuff as the world becomes more technical
[02:54:56.080 --> 02:55:01.360]  more integrated and more sophisticated uh the older builderburg members are sort of fading
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:08.800]  into the distance as people like ceo founder of facebook chris hughes is here meeting not only
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:13.040]  with other technological wizards but also the heads of the nsa the heads of the various
[02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:19.760]  intelligence organizations we hear often about facebook being uh cia front uh well obviously
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:24.960]  one of the central meeting points is here at the builderburg meeting especially now in the 21st
[02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:32.400]  century also here at the meeting is eric schmidt uh the former ceo of google incorporated google of
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:37.200]  course uh being one of the biggest entities anywhere in the world especially online eric schmidt
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:42.960]  is also reportedly uh probably going to be the next secretary of commerce uh he's been a strong
[02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:47.920]  supporter of obama a strong supporter of the color revolutions going on around the world
[02:55:47.920 --> 02:55:53.120]  and it'll be very interesting to see how his position develops as he becomes more powerful in
[02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:58.400]  the world and how these technological heads uh continue to meet with the likes of builderburg
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:04.560]  and uh the big heads of intelligence one final point uh we've we've gotten reports from we are
[02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:10.240]  changed which one that the chief of police uh came to this activist meeting tonight and that he
[02:56:10.240 --> 02:56:16.240]  approves the chief of police does that is of us asking questions of builderburg of protesters
[02:56:16.240 --> 02:56:22.560]  coming out to show their faces and that coincides with these important members of parliament here
[02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:28.320]  in swichland or the elected body uh telling them not to harass protesters telling them instead to
[02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:35.280]  arrest Henry Kissinger uh also a man was arrested yesterday uh who would paul i don't understand
[02:56:35.280 --> 02:56:40.880]  this please just tell them yeah of course we report the bombscare yesterday where you know our
[02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:45.280]  car was parked at the top of the hill and the chief of police told erin that nobody would be
[02:56:45.280 --> 02:56:50.640]  allowed into the area not the same chief not the same chief of police who came to this event tonight
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:55.760]  um and charlie skelton of the london guardian put out a report this morning where he got the
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:57:01.280]  photograph which was taken by um one of the activists of the man who was arrested for the
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:06.800]  apparent bombscare where the police were talking about some kind of tubular tube like device that
[02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:12.560]  was found in that location just across from the builderburg hotel now most of the activists
[02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:18.560]  that we've spoken to have had never seen this guy before and couldn't identify him but according to
[02:57:18.560 --> 02:57:25.680]  alex of info creek it turns out that he was a uh a member of a neo fascist organization and as alex
[02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:30.400]  has just said to me now um you know you would think that he would agree with what builderburg
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:36.480]  doing inside the hotel but definitely some kind of provocateur action was in evidence yesterday
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:42.320]  and this bombscare um allowed builderburg for about an hour to clear the media area they put
[02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:47.760]  up a roadblock and many have suggested that this was a ruse to allow them to transport an
[02:57:47.760 --> 02:57:52.960]  important member of the builderburg group so with us coming up to the final couple of minutes
