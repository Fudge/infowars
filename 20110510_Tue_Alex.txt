[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:38.160]  it is Tuesday the 10th day of May 2011 on this live Tuesday edition everything is
[00:38.160 --> 00:43.120]  coming together confirming that our analysis of the globalist takeover of
[00:43.120 --> 00:48.680]  our country and the rest of the planet has been absolutely spot-on now that
[00:48.680 --> 00:54.520]  wasn't hard through the different executive orders congressional
[00:54.520 --> 01:02.760]  legislation UN reports Pentagon training telecommunications acts we have been
[01:02.760 --> 01:08.040]  able to read what they were setting up what they were deploying Patriot Act 1
[01:08.040 --> 01:14.120]  and 2 the John Warner Defense Authorization Act the enemy combatant
[01:14.120 --> 01:20.520]  designation the Military Commissions Act all of this is crystal clear all we had
[01:20.520 --> 01:25.520]  to do was actually read it and look at it and see what the big megabanks that
[01:25.520 --> 01:29.360]  have captured the United States through fraud and propaganda have done in other
[01:29.360 --> 01:36.200]  nations and then add a 21st century overlay to that and we have exactly what
[01:36.200 --> 01:43.160]  is going to happen exactly what is going to happen exactly and I'm going to
[01:43.160 --> 01:47.400]  attempt to not just cover the first article and then spin out in rage and
[01:47.400 --> 01:52.040]  anger I may have to turn off the big computer screen over here though because
[01:52.040 --> 01:57.000]  it scrolls through info wars headlines it has info wars.com upon the screen so I
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.320]  can surf news and when Chuckie Schumer's face comes up or Obama's face comes up
[02:02.320 --> 02:08.560]  or the fake bin Laden photos come up or articles about internal passports come up
[02:08.560 --> 02:14.240]  it it it begins to drive me into a frustrated rage last night I went and
[02:14.240 --> 02:20.680]  saw my daughter do her end-of-class gymnastics award ceremony and I
[02:20.680 --> 02:24.000]  couldn't quit thinking about how innocent she was how innocent the other
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.080]  children were how innocent looking the adults were and how they're like
[02:28.080 --> 02:32.880]  children and have no idea what has been set up in and around us I want to protect
[02:32.880 --> 02:37.640]  people I want to be free I want to be treated with dignity and I want my bill
[02:37.640 --> 02:42.400]  of rights in my constitution and I'm going to fight for it then I went to
[02:42.400 --> 02:50.200]  dinner with friends and literally couldn't even focus on just having fun
[02:50.200 --> 02:55.200]  conversation because all I'm thinking about is what's happening 9-11 was only
[02:55.200 --> 02:59.640]  a preparatory phase they've built their police state in the last ten years now
[02:59.640 --> 03:03.360]  they're getting ready to go into high gear continuity of agenda between both
[03:03.360 --> 03:09.120]  political parties and they're now going into warp warp now we come back from

[03:18.960 --> 03:23.400]  years ago and four months ago and again two months ago and then again last month

[08:17.520 --> 08:32.000]  live from austin texas alex jones this is a day that will live in infamy every
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.280]  day henceforward is only going to get more intense more insane we are on the
[08:38.280 --> 08:44.040]  verge of massive false flag stage terror attacks self-inflicted wounds here in
[08:44.040 --> 08:48.320]  the united states and in europe as a pretext to launch what could trigger
[08:48.320 --> 08:53.280]  world war three military attacks on iran and pakistan as we've been
[08:53.280 --> 08:58.240]  predicting in the last two months a month ago an admitted cia agent was caught
[08:58.240 --> 09:03.240]  reportedly trying to deliver uranium to taliban in pakistan to be blamed on the
[09:03.240 --> 09:09.320]  pakistani government this staged bin laden raid nine days ago is part two of
[09:09.320 --> 09:16.640]  that frame-up operation we are going to be breaking it all down today and I want
[09:16.640 --> 09:20.120]  to get into that article from yesterday with some of the latest developments by
[09:20.120 --> 09:26.920]  paul joseph watson that I swore to get to and didn't ten facts that prove that
[09:26.920 --> 09:31.000]  the bin laden fable is a contrived hoax so we will make good on that promise to
[09:31.000 --> 09:38.440]  get through this important boil down also that obviously integrates in with the
[09:38.440 --> 09:43.760]  new national polls that are out poll reveals most mistrust bin laden
[09:43.760 --> 09:52.040]  assassination story and they have polls out breaking that down we also have an
[09:52.040 --> 10:00.600]  info wars polls showing 90% of 35,383 votes 10% believe that they did kill
[10:00.600 --> 10:05.240]  bin laden 4084 but there are other quote scientific polls showing a lot of
[10:05.240 --> 10:08.960]  people are officially questioning and I've also heard that a crosstalk radio
[10:08.960 --> 10:13.160]  with many of the callers the majority of callers and just talking to friends
[10:13.160 --> 10:16.560]  family neighbors they say people that aren't even aware of the whole new
[10:16.560 --> 10:20.960]  world order system are saying this is wag the dog so we're going to be going
[10:20.960 --> 10:27.760]  over some of that as well today but for those that ever ask why would government
[10:27.760 --> 10:32.760]  stage a terror attack or allow terrorists to attack us or stage the fake
[10:32.760 --> 10:39.800]  killing of a top terrorist it's because they get more power and control out of
[10:39.800 --> 10:43.560]  it why did Hitler burn his own Reichstag as an excuse to clamp down in
[10:43.560 --> 10:49.640]  Germany and last Sunday night not this Sunday but the Sunday before last we put
[10:49.640 --> 10:53.800]  out an article Sunday evening within two hours of Obama's announcement breaking
[10:53.800 --> 10:58.000]  down the fact that you watch the war on terror isn't going to go away it's going
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.320]  to get worse and it's really a war on your liberties on your freedoms and on
[11:02.320 --> 11:07.080]  the Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence and that
[11:07.080 --> 11:12.880]  has since happened now let me calmly just tell you that Jesse Ventura
[11:12.880 --> 11:21.000]  obviously wasn't going to be back doing media in the US for a few weeks but he
[11:21.000 --> 11:27.400]  we got contacted yesterday by his folks saying that obviously Ventura wants to
[11:27.400 --> 11:31.920]  comment on the whole bin Laden situation and so he's doing some of the only
[11:31.920 --> 11:37.440]  interviews today via phone from Mexico and he's scheduled to be joining us
[11:37.440 --> 11:42.080]  coming up in the next hour also need to call Dr. Steve Pachennick back and set
[11:42.080 --> 11:46.760]  him up in the next few days to respond to the latest fake videos they've released
[11:46.760 --> 11:50.800]  again of those videos most of the new videos they released on record Paul
[11:50.800 --> 11:54.240]  Watson did articles Friday and over the weekend detailing that they were old
[11:54.240 --> 11:58.720]  videos and he shows examples of them being the exact same videos except these
[11:58.720 --> 12:02.160]  new videos have the audio cut out because it'd be a little too embarrassing
[12:02.160 --> 12:07.680]  if they have the same audio as four-year-old videos videos released four
[12:07.680 --> 12:13.440]  years ago of the unaging bin Laden he never ages either so we're gonna be
[12:13.440 --> 12:22.000]  breaking that down today also the economy and Obama is in Texas he's in
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.520]  El Paso just got done giving a speech he's scheduled to fly Air Force One to
[12:26.520 --> 12:30.760]  Austin today arriving at about four he drives right by our office when he lands
[12:30.760 --> 12:36.920]  there'll be of course shutting down the highway for his Imperial leader to the
[12:36.920 --> 12:41.760]  Imperial frontman puppet the curtain so we don't see what's going on behind the
[12:41.760 --> 12:46.120]  curtain with the private fellow reserve Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of England
[12:46.120 --> 12:51.840]  the fraudulent hijackers of America he'll be arriving here and giving a
[12:51.840 --> 12:59.240]  speech at a private fundraiser from what 5 to 6 o'clock at the W Hotel I should
[12:59.240 --> 13:01.920]  I even go down there in bullhorn and when I can just do a YouTube video and
[13:01.920 --> 13:06.480]  point out the lies and corruption and reach half a million people in two days
[13:06.480 --> 13:14.120]  a million in a week two million a month you see the internet's very powerful we
[13:14.120 --> 13:18.640]  have seized control of it the alternative media two years ago they put out big
[13:18.640 --> 13:22.480]  actuaries breaking down the alternative media when put together was bigger than
[13:22.480 --> 13:30.880]  the entire dinosaur corporate lap dog prostitute horn media and so now we
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.560]  enter into the big report for today before I get into all the latest bin
[13:35.560 --> 13:39.480]  Laden hoax info and counter all the new lies that they brought in for the
[13:39.480 --> 13:49.720]  previous lies of last week and again this is not horn tooting if you went and
[13:49.720 --> 13:54.800]  did the research we've done and read our articles and followed the hyperlinks to
[13:54.800 --> 13:58.800]  the executive orders to the telecommunications act to the John Warner
[13:58.800 --> 14:04.200]  Defense Authorization Act to the enemy combatant act if you read what
[14:04.200 --> 14:10.120]  industry has been ordered to set up and what the big mega apples and googles and
[14:10.120 --> 14:15.400]  AT&T's and Verizon's who chair the internet two meetings now going on for
[14:15.400 --> 14:20.600]  11 years these minutes are all public and they openly say we're seizing the web
[14:20.600 --> 14:24.080]  we're going to shut off all the alternative media you'll have a few
[14:24.080 --> 14:28.440]  thousand sites you can go to own and control by us university government
[14:28.440 --> 14:34.560]  and fortune 100 and that's it this is all been announced for 11 years we've
[14:34.560 --> 14:42.280]  written articles in the hundreds some years it's in the hundreds warning you
[14:42.280 --> 14:47.760]  breaking down every facet showing you where they say it showing you telling
[14:47.760 --> 14:53.360]  you exactly how they're going to roll it out incrementally to condition you now
[14:53.360 --> 15:00.040]  I've always told you it's a red herring to say it's an internet kill switch
[15:00.040 --> 15:04.440]  that's too simple yes they could shut the internet off DARPA and the Pentagon
[15:04.440 --> 15:11.200]  designed it but researchers programmers consumers designed it and paid for it
[15:11.200 --> 15:15.040]  and innovated it and made it what it is today now the infrastructure is built
[15:15.040 --> 15:19.440]  but the kernel is DARPA military industrial complex designed that's the
[15:19.440 --> 15:26.640]  joke WW dot not worldwide web worldwide wiretap but it is a web of control and
[15:26.640 --> 15:30.240]  surveillance but going back to the 60s and then the 70s when they started
[15:30.240 --> 15:34.320]  calling it worldwide web it was a inside joke this is in the mainline history of
[15:34.320 --> 15:39.320]  the internet that it's the worldwide wiretap so it's a double-edged sword it
[15:39.320 --> 15:44.320]  can be used by the people to empower enlighten inform it can be used to search
[15:44.320 --> 15:49.200]  information greater than all the libraries and history put together and the
[15:49.200 --> 15:53.560]  system has allowed it to grow until it's ubiquitous and wired into everything
[15:53.560 --> 16:00.160]  and absolutely essential for our society our industry our culture now that we are
[16:00.160 --> 16:05.320]  wedded to it at the hip like Simon's twins now they are going to remove one
[16:05.320 --> 16:09.880]  edge of the sword and they're already blunting it and expand the other side
[16:09.880 --> 16:15.960]  which is it being a one-way conduit for establishment prostitute government
[16:15.960 --> 16:19.360]  federal reserve financed we learned about that in the last few months I
[16:19.360 --> 16:23.040]  told you about it years ago but now it's declassified that billions of dollars
[16:23.040 --> 16:29.200]  to mainstream media newspapers MSNBC CNN CIA black ops world net daily had that
[16:29.200 --> 16:36.360]  13 years ago running CNN just total control okay and the military itself in
[16:36.360 --> 16:39.800]  the psyops works for Wall Street themselves working for the big offshore
[16:39.800 --> 16:43.680]  banks that own Wall Street and that came out two months ago in the Bloomberg
[16:43.680 --> 16:47.040]  documents and others when they sued and got it that almost all the money went
[16:47.040 --> 16:50.680]  offshore to foreign banks and the domestic money went to media to hold
[16:50.680 --> 16:56.600]  you down keep you dumb but they're losing and so the internet is not going
[16:56.600 --> 17:02.000]  to be killed it's going to be changed and it's going to become mainly a one-way
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.520]  system and this has already been announced and I told you they would roll
[17:05.520 --> 17:08.760]  it out first for hurricanes and disasters oh we're going to break in and
[17:08.760 --> 17:13.160]  take over your cell phone oh we're going to break in and Obama has a kill
[17:13.160 --> 17:17.880]  switch where only government messages will go over the web during a anthrax or
[17:17.880 --> 17:23.640]  smallpox attack or during a nuclear attack but see they'll be the ones that
[17:23.640 --> 17:30.360]  engage in the attack to then set the precedent for this and so what's
[17:30.360 --> 17:38.440]  happening is is not a takeover of just the web it is a total takeover of the
[17:38.440 --> 17:43.800]  entire infrastructure of media now they already had EAS since the 50s but in
[17:43.800 --> 17:52.800]  96 hardwired into all UHF VHS cable AM FM high-def now all telecommunications

[18:02.840 --> 18:07.400]  years ago the AT&T exec in San Francisco went public they whitewashed it but it
[18:07.400 --> 18:11.240]  was exactly as we told you because the blueprint to fund it and legalize it was
[18:11.240 --> 18:14.560]  all there I told you they're listening to all your phones in live time with NSA
[18:14.560 --> 18:17.640]  computers I told you they're tracking you down to just a few feet with

[20:13.840 --> 20:18.120]  of Americans becoming homeless all caused by the devalued US dollar while

[23:09.720 --> 23:14.520]  ago sought after radio guest Marjorie Wildcraft and her family began working to
[23:14.520 --> 23:18.840]  find the easiest ways to grow food for the crisis we are now facing Marjorie
[23:18.840 --> 23:22.760]  created a video that is the fastest way to learn how to grow food you'll learn

[24:23.400 --> 24:29.520]  just calmly break down the basics and I'll go into the detail deceptively and
[24:29.520 --> 24:34.640]  illegally the federal government has been spying on all communications without
[24:34.640 --> 24:39.640]  warrants for 50 years or more but they can only do it selectively because they
[24:39.640 --> 24:43.360]  didn't have the computing power or the personnel to physically listen to
[24:43.360 --> 24:49.200]  everyone with the advent of keyword software and computers 30 years ago or
[24:49.200 --> 24:55.040]  so with the echelon system declassified in the 90s they could then begin listening
[24:55.040 --> 25:01.080]  to millions of people simultaneously now many Americans have computers listening
[25:01.080 --> 25:07.840]  24 hours a day computers dial in on your laptop your cell phone which is a
[25:07.840 --> 25:13.800]  computer and listen to you the cameras are admittedly accessed going back six
[25:13.800 --> 25:17.920]  years ago by Google with computers watching you and recording and getting
[25:17.920 --> 25:23.720]  keywords AI systems that can recognize faces you name it how do we know that
[25:23.720 --> 25:29.160]  press release by Google six years ago this is all hidden in plain view beyond
[25:29.160 --> 25:35.400]  1984 and the architecture of it is not designed or built to fight terrorist
[25:35.400 --> 25:40.600]  then you research who the terrorists are all the famous ones a locky bin Laden
[25:40.600 --> 25:45.960]  CIA hanging out at bases families working for British Israeli intelligence on
[25:45.960 --> 25:50.840]  record protected US embassies ordered to let them get into the US on and on and
[25:50.840 --> 25:55.320]  on people say well something this big it would come out we've had the heads of
[25:55.320 --> 26:00.400]  the embassies the heads of the military bases like Colonel Stephen Butler at the
[26:00.400 --> 26:03.840]  Monterey Defense Language School came out a month of 9-11 and said these guys
[26:03.840 --> 26:07.920]  trained at my base out of all of them this was staged by the government they
[26:07.920 --> 26:12.120]  started a court martial of him till he agreed to shut up I think he should have
[26:12.120 --> 26:15.920]  gone ahead with it I called him I talked to him and he somebody was screaming
[26:15.920 --> 26:23.000]  in the background he hung up on me back at the time I could get Butler on I mean
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.000]  he's like Mohammed Atta was at the school I mean it's on record ladies and
[26:29.000 --> 26:32.640]  gentlemen you're like well then they work for us but they got on planes
[26:32.640 --> 26:36.160]  and flew into buildings we don't know exactly what happened but why isn't it
[26:36.160 --> 26:43.480]  being investigated look I'm already digressing the issue here is it's very
[26:43.480 --> 26:48.040]  elementary they stage the attacks they have the patsies internationally to
[26:48.040 --> 26:52.160]  invade whoever they want but domestically to clamp down on us and the
[26:52.160 --> 26:55.400]  military industrial complex then has made trillions of dollars the last ten
[26:55.400 --> 27:01.000]  years just domestically in the process of taking over our society they get all
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.880]  the domestic no-bid contracts they build the federal spy centers that
[27:05.880 --> 27:10.040]  federalize your police they openly have the military out running checkpoints
[27:10.040 --> 27:14.280]  under TSA training all of this was already going on and they're just now
[27:14.280 --> 27:18.020]  announcing oh we want you to have to run your driver's license through to get a

[27:48.480 --> 27:53.400]  governors aside we will take over states if they don't do what the feds say and
[27:53.400 --> 27:58.240]  then Obama creates what a what Bush started the ten governors so they can
[27:58.240 --> 28:01.400]  say well we have governors we have states rights the president chooses
[28:01.400 --> 28:06.120]  governors that speak for the 50 states I mean we're already under federal

[31:14.760 --> 31:18.760]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[31:18.760 --> 31:23.320]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[31:23.320 --> 31:27.360]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[31:27.360 --> 31:31.160]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[33:15.760 --> 33:22.000]  I told you live on air last Monday eight days ago now that you would see a
[33:22.000 --> 33:26.080]  massive push now for police state that you would see the announcements of
[33:26.080 --> 33:29.960]  government alerts on your cell phones your home computer break-ins on radio
[33:29.960 --> 33:34.960]  and TV I told you that you would see announcements that they want checkpoints
[33:34.960 --> 33:40.760]  at malls and at sports stadiums and on highways why because they have been
[33:40.760 --> 33:46.040]  preparing at breakneck speed for nine years training every police department
[33:46.040 --> 33:54.040]  to deal with I improvised explosive devices IEDs they have been creating
[33:54.040 --> 33:58.640]  this hysteria they had secret terror alert systems where they would tell
[33:58.640 --> 34:02.960]  police and military about supposed terror attacks that have been foiled or
[34:02.960 --> 34:07.120]  terror attacks that have been carried out the feds would blow up a chemical
[34:07.120 --> 34:11.600]  plant say terrorists did it just to get local cops really scared but then tell
[34:11.600 --> 34:15.760]  the cops don't tell anybody say it was an accident cops are going how does he
[34:15.760 --> 34:21.200]  know that folks come on you know how many secret documents I get sent the point
[34:21.200 --> 34:26.160]  is that we are going to lay out right now for you exactly what we're in the
[34:26.160 --> 34:30.560]  middle of and what's happening it's called the rollout of another degree of
[34:30.560 --> 34:39.120]  martial law but just like a Richter scale as I wrote in 1998 martial law is
[34:39.120 --> 34:45.680]  here and it's a three on the Richter scale we're now at a seven and it
[34:45.680 --> 34:54.760]  exponentially doubles every level we go up a 10 is burning cities mass
[34:54.760 --> 34:59.920]  extermination camps black uniforms everywhere the smell of dead flesh by
[34:59.920 --> 35:03.360]  the way that happens in Africa almost every country every year it happened all

[37:12.560 --> 37:19.160]  been in place for 16 years senator Franken takes on smartphone apps total
[37:19.160 --> 37:24.040]  theater saying the companies are doing this illegally it's telecommunications
[37:24.040 --> 37:28.880]  act Bob I told you that three weeks ago a week after that the media admitted it
[37:28.880 --> 37:32.120]  was under government orders people are like but that was Bush no it was actually
[37:32.120 --> 37:37.560]  Clinton they're all on the same team the same bureaucracy is still in control no
[37:37.560 --> 37:42.360]  matter who comes and goes these childlike people say well Bush wouldn't
[37:42.360 --> 37:46.800]  know that bin Laden was dead and not use that for himself politically Bush is a
[37:46.800 --> 37:51.240]  front man it's about the agenda of the elites they're there to be built up
[37:51.240 --> 37:58.080]  torn down leave office and be built back up again Bush couldn't have brought
[37:58.080 --> 38:01.920]  bin Laden out because no one would have bought it that's why the decision was
[38:01.920 --> 38:06.680]  made when the Democrats came out and broke ranks all the big elitists the
[38:06.680 --> 38:11.120]  former Secretary of State Madeline Albright Walter Cronkite at the most
[38:11.120 --> 38:15.520]  elite level of Bohemian Grove went public Teresa Heinz Kerry and a bunch of
[38:15.520 --> 38:18.720]  others and we know you got him don't bring him out so they stuck that ace
[38:18.720 --> 38:26.960]  back in the hole we forget all that 2003 side issue the media is acting like
[38:26.960 --> 38:31.000]  these companies did all this in unison together first it was Apple then Google
[38:31.000 --> 38:37.840]  smartphones then AT&T then the Microsoft phones it's all of them it's
[38:37.840 --> 38:42.480]  your home telephone they break into that over digital switches even if it's on
[38:42.480 --> 38:49.080]  copper they can access it through a hub switch for detainment for videotaping
[38:49.080 --> 38:53.360]  DIA security checkpoint now you're a terrorist if you videotape them groping
[38:53.360 --> 39:01.200]  a one-year-old baby and track back Schumer plan for no ride list it's already

[39:07.960 --> 39:13.200]  no ride list gonna be breaking that down now here are our articles dealing with
[39:13.200 --> 39:20.240]  because they said they would do it I remember in the 1980s seeing reports in
[39:20.240 --> 39:23.400]  the 90s reading old reports from the 80s how they wanted all cable boxes to
[39:23.400 --> 39:27.120]  break in with government announcements how they wanted the EAS system to be in
[39:27.120 --> 39:31.640]  control of all radio and TV to be able to break in they got it done by 96 this
[39:31.640 --> 39:38.320]  is already been in place and federal news radio back on February 7th came out
[39:38.320 --> 39:43.400]  and said FCC presidential emergency alerts to be tested and he said coming up
[39:43.400 --> 39:48.720]  in one month the president will start breaking in selectively on radio TV and
[39:48.720 --> 39:54.160]  smartphones with EAS now on 9-11 they didn't use EAS because they didn't need
[39:54.160 --> 40:00.600]  to they already had ABC CBS NBC Fox CNN MSNBC CNBC all in line with the script
[40:00.600 --> 40:06.200]  within minutes been lot and did it we've got to attack Iraq now because the
[40:06.200 --> 40:11.480]  internet growing so powerful and so fast they've expanded their grids and all
[40:11.480 --> 40:16.040]  the telecommunications companies now under the Cyber Security Act ISPs with
[40:16.040 --> 40:20.600]  a hundred or more customers have to have it my IT guys under federal law if
[40:20.600 --> 40:25.160]  they get this implemented we'll have to go get federal licensing and put hubs in
[40:25.160 --> 40:30.800]  even in my operation they haven't passed that yet but they're still
[40:30.800 --> 40:35.640]  implementing it I mean this is total control not so they can kill the
[40:35.640 --> 40:39.040]  internet oh they'll kill the freedom of it but take it over it's not internet
[40:39.040 --> 40:43.040]  kill switch it's an internet telecommunications full spectrum dominance
[40:43.040 --> 40:48.520]  total takeover just like the telescreens in the 9,000 locations barking
[40:48.520 --> 40:54.320]  orders telling you be scared they want to force you to watch them in the 80s they
[40:54.320 --> 40:57.160]  said they want to make alarm clocks where they remote control turn on with a
[40:57.160 --> 41:01.040]  shortwave chip in them that picks up a shortwave transmission and of course it'll
[41:01.040 --> 41:05.140]  always be over hurricanes tornadoes and as they roll it out it'll first be those
[41:05.140 --> 41:09.520]  alerts you don't have a choice with they'll have examples of oh this woman
[41:09.520 --> 41:13.080]  her phone broke in and told her there was a tornado nearby she was saved see
[41:13.080 --> 41:16.760]  how great it is at the feds with the local threat fusion centers the local
[41:16.760 --> 41:23.480]  brainwashing spying propaganda centers will then break in over your phone over
[41:23.480 --> 41:27.520]  your computer over your cable system over your AM and FM radio station and
[41:27.520 --> 41:35.400]  they talked about this in 2003 I was broadcasting out of 12 60 a.m. and
[41:35.400 --> 41:44.280]  filling in for shows there it's it's now sports but I was on that station also
[41:44.280 --> 41:46.840]  fill in for him so I was over there and the engineers like look at this Alex
[41:46.840 --> 41:49.680]  heard you talking about didn't believe it we've been told now the president may
[41:49.680 --> 41:53.440]  start breaking in and other government and they may just randomly take hours a
[41:53.440 --> 41:58.280]  day and they were all angry didn't happen see they put this in place and they see
[41:58.280 --> 42:01.920]  if you'll accept it and then they start pushing it I mean that is the essence of
[42:01.920 --> 42:08.440]  tyranny now here's our article February 8th Obama launches total media takeover
[42:08.440 --> 42:16.080]  system prisonplanet.com and full wars.com here's my video February 8th few

[54:02.400 --> 54:09.160]  I want to be clear about this the globalist had positioned us for bankruptcy
[54:09.160 --> 54:14.760]  into this new band-core IMF World Bank digital currency receivership but they've
[54:14.760 --> 54:18.800]  done it through fraud their criminals the whole world's waking up to them they
[54:18.800 --> 54:24.240]  need a police state as the IMF and World Bank documents leaked in 2002 show when
[54:24.240 --> 54:29.360]  they take over any country they need a police state grid in place or the people
[54:29.360 --> 54:33.440]  will take the government back and in many cases prosecute the government
[54:33.440 --> 54:39.600]  criminals that were bought off by the offshore crime syndicate and so now
[54:39.600 --> 54:43.360]  they're coming in with their total media takeover they're testing it but but
[54:43.360 --> 54:47.760]  nothing is more draconian than the internal passport remember four years
[54:47.760 --> 54:51.560]  ago we have links to his speeches and articles about it in our articles that
[54:51.560 --> 54:58.080]  break it down in Paul Watson and Steve Watts as well as Kurt Nemo's articles we
[54:58.080 --> 55:02.440]  have the links to Ron Paul and his quotes going this national ID card is a
[55:02.440 --> 55:06.960]  domestic passport an internal passport as the Fed said if your state doesn't
[55:06.960 --> 55:10.880]  accept it we won't accept it for social security or we won't accept if you get on
[55:10.880 --> 55:14.760]  a plane we won't accept it for you to go to a national park or in order to the
[55:14.760 --> 55:19.480]  Statue of Liberty your kids will have to have this to go to the Statue of Liberty
[55:19.480 --> 55:25.320]  it's a domestic system and we've reported for now a year that in key unions
[55:25.320 --> 55:29.280]  where the globalists have control they make you go through a criminal terror
[55:29.280 --> 55:35.000]  database search to get a job remember two weeks ago 9 11 first responders cops
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.440]  firemen medical people have to go through a terror database to get their
[55:38.440 --> 55:43.800]  health care everywhere they can forcing you oh this is a federal special
[55:43.800 --> 55:48.600]  health care program you've got to go through a terror database that's to beta
[55:48.600 --> 55:54.080]  test it for everybody and that's what Obama's talking about with his domestic
[55:54.080 --> 55:58.120]  security force and they're also saying you get on this list millions are on it
[55:58.120 --> 56:01.600]  they admit political enemies are on it you can't get off you can't find out why
[56:01.600 --> 56:06.480]  you're on it now you can't buy a gun no judge no jury no gun now you can't have
[56:06.480 --> 56:11.080]  a job now you can't get on trains and now they're talking about and states
[56:11.080 --> 56:14.480]  already have this Texas does license plate reading systems that know when
[56:14.480 --> 56:18.200]  your insurance is up you're in a database so the cops pull you over now
[56:18.200 --> 56:21.400]  they're saying if you're on a terror database why aren't you picked up then
[56:21.400 --> 56:24.760]  well because you're actually just a pro-second amendment or a liberal group
[56:24.760 --> 56:28.120]  whatever now the cops pull you over because you're on a no-drive list and
[56:28.120 --> 56:32.000]  then they've said they're planning this you won't be able to leave your house
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.640]  just like a Nazi Germany where they first said you can't do business you can't
[56:36.640 --> 56:41.640]  leave your neighborhood it's funny that it's all these Israeli operatives like
[56:41.640 --> 56:45.760]  Chuck E. Schumer and Rahm Emanuel are the ones pushing this they want us to live
[56:45.760 --> 56:50.000]  like Arabs do in Israel and they admit that's the plan but therefore Israelis
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.880]  having M16s in Israel just Americans can't have our guns I'm sick of it but
[56:54.880 --> 56:57.400]  there's other groups pushing this as well but I'm calling these people out
[56:57.400 --> 57:01.960]  let's go ahead and play Obama again with this domestic security force we cannot
[57:01.960 --> 57:07.440]  continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security
[57:07.440 --> 57:11.960]  objectives that we've set we've got to have a civilian national security force
[57:11.960 --> 57:17.400]  that's just as powerful just as strong just as well-funded now we're not gonna
[57:17.400 --> 57:20.760]  really have time to play the whole thing but in our articles we have Rahm Emanuel
[57:20.760 --> 57:25.000]  saying if you're on a no-fly list you can't buy a gun you're not part of
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.760]  America here it is
[57:27.760 --> 57:32.960]  all right we got to set up a different computer system because when we got one
[57:32.960 --> 57:37.120]  then we got to cue the other and then we're gonna be able to play it so here
[57:37.120 --> 57:41.040]  it is make this a number one issue as a test vote and then take it into the
[57:41.040 --> 57:46.240]  election that is if you are on the no-fly list because you are known as
[57:46.240 --> 57:54.160]  maybe a possible terrorist you cannot buy a handgun in America you can be in
[57:54.160 --> 58:01.680]  the country but just you can't have a gun and I am not one far from liking the
[58:01.680 --> 58:06.240]  mixing of politics and policy but as my old boss used to say give me that vote
[58:06.240 --> 58:10.000]  and throw me into that prior patch I'll make politics out of that every day
[58:10.000 --> 58:16.240]  because if it's between that terrorist list and the NRA I know we're America's
[58:16.240 --> 58:19.760]  gonna be every time and they're gonna make the right choice and we have got to
[58:19.760 --> 58:23.240]  start building on that that is the right thing to take into the election it's the
[58:23.240 --> 58:28.120]  right policy if you're on that no-fly list your access to the right to bear
[58:28.120 --> 58:31.760]  arms is canceled because you're not part of the American family all right we'll
[58:31.760 --> 58:35.960]  be right back so so the government the bureaucrats they just play them on a
[58:35.960 --> 58:41.120]  list no travel no guns no job no food
[58:43.320 --> 58:50.080]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[58:50.080 --> 58:55.840]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[58:55.840 --> 59:00.400]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[59:00.400 --> 59:04.000]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[59:04.000 --> 59:09.040]  I've determined this influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[59:09.040 --> 59:14.560]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to
[59:14.560 --> 59:18.720]  pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[59:18.720 --> 59:23.920]  criminal off-shore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[59:23.920 --> 59:27.960]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[59:27.960 --> 59:31.640]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[59:31.640 --> 59:36.720]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[59:36.720 --> 59:42.800]  a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info

[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.800]  Jesse Ventura with Dick Russell 63 documents the government doesn't want

[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.720]  the films free when you get the book with big brother there are well in
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.680]  nightmare come true now now governor it's great to have you back you're down in
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.480]  Mexico right now but we've got you for the full hour some stations don't carry
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.920]  this first five minutes so I want to cover some sub issues before we come
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:04.960]  back and get your take on the entire bin Laden fable and they're telling us
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.600]  that we've got to give up even more rights now that bin Laden's been
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:12.200]  reportedly killed they're announcing the government's gonna have alerts over
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:17.760]  our cell phones they're gonna have a no-travel list now for trains you name
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:21.640]  it we're gonna talk about all that with former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:28.000]  but getting into the no-travel thing first so we thought we'd escape the
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.400]  TSA by not flying on commercial jets but now they're announcing governor that
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.440]  they want to have these on the roads the highways the trains they've been beta
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.280]  testing those what's your view on that well it doesn't surprise me at all
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:47.680]  because Alex you know I drive to and from Mexico every year and after clearing
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:51.680]  customs at the border and it doesn't matter what border whether it's
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:57.320]  California or Arizona when you clear customs you get about an hour under the
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.400]  freeway in the United States of America and this has been going on for the last
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:06.960]  six years because that's how long I've been living in Mexico and Minnesota you
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.160]  come to an immigration stop out in the middle of a highway where you have to
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.760]  sit out there in the hot desert for an hour and a half and clear a second
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:21.200]  immigration stop so it doesn't surprise me because these stops have been going
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.800]  along and very illegal in my opinion because you've already shown your
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:29.080]  passport at the border why are you required to produce it again an hour
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:33.760]  into the United States so you know this is stuff that they've been setting up
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.400]  that I've been watching for six years now in my travels via Mexico back to the
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:45.000]  US every year they're just expanding the control well let's say they want to
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.280]  protect us from terrorists terrorists they get a leak might want to attack a
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.040]  mall they're gonna put TSA in front of every mall well they're now announcing
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:57.520]  they want that are they going to there's close to 200,000 miles of rails over
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.480]  two and a half million miles of roads I mean it's impossible to protect all this
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:07.320]  it's a joke they're expecting I mean the tap is that what they're is that what
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:11.120]  they're saying I mean I've been down in Mexico are they priming us that we're
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.440]  gonna get hit again and so they want to be preemptive and that's what they're
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:19.160]  telling us yes they they've just so have been training for years with real
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:23.280]  checkpoints at bus stations and train terminals but now they're rolling an
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:27.440]  ounce saying Al Qaeda it's inevitable they're gonna hit in a revenge for
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.520]  bin Laden we're talking about after the break and so you got to give all your
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:34.760]  rides up now and we've got to basically have TSA train federalized police
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.400]  through the threat fusion centers just sticking their hands down our pants
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:43.240]  everywhere well you know it's it's it's like the old forefather I can't remember
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:47.560]  who's been Franklin or which one of them said it when they made the great
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:52.880]  statement that if you're going to trade your liberty for security well then you
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:57.560]  have neither and it seems that that's what our country is willing to do now
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:02.920]  that we're willing to trade our liberty to be secure I mean Alex I go crazy
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.920]  right now I mean I have to sue to prove that Jesse Ventura is not a threat just
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:13.120]  so I can fly commercially I mean what kind of nonsense is going on in this
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.080]  country it's amazing and and the more liberty we give up now they say the
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.480]  terror threat ten years later is even worse we need more of your rights they
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.600]  spend trillions of dollars in the last ten years in the domestic system there's
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:30.160]  close to a million domestic private contractor spies this is big business and
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.880]  the truth is it's not going anywhere just like the prison industry until we say
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:38.000]  no that's why they made drugs illegal so they could have a black market bring
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.840]  them in and arrest their competition for Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:46.240]  our guest the book is 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.840]  they'll be with us for the next 55 minutes we're gonna get into the whole
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.160]  bin Laden fable and get his take on it straight ahead first days doing
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:05:01.160]  interviews we're honored to having stay with us we'll be right back over the
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:05.320]  last year Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:09.560]  and disasters and unprecedented numbers people have had to literally run for
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:13.520]  their lives folks this is Steve shank with the foods direct I'm not here to
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:17.840]  scare you but when disaster strikes you won't have time to think you must act
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:21.800]  automatically what does the pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.880]  flight no time to think just act automatically when the alert is

[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:24.120]  thank you for joining us it is Tuesday the 10th day of May 2011 joining us
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.800]  from the Baja in California is former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura's new
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:33.320]  book climbing up the New York Times bestseller list Jesse Ventura 63
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:37.160]  documents the government doesn't want you to read available at info wars.com
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:44.800]  governor Ventura out of the gates we're now nine days into the killing of Ben
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:48.240]  Laudan we were told eight separate times he'd been killed we have that those
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.680]  articles up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com they told us buried
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.600]  at sea they won't show us the photo because quote conspiracy theorist the
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.680]  president said on 60 minutes wouldn't believe it that means people that have
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:03.400]  been lied to so much they don't believe anything and I know talking to you
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.800]  privately that was your point but governor looking at this situation in
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.760]  the way they've changed the story so many times what's your take and view on
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:17.000]  this governor Ventura? Well you know it's hard to have a take and view on it for me
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.880]  Alex because as you said I'm down here in the Baja and I get wind of stuff 48
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:26.440]  hours or three days after it happens so you guys know certainly more than I do
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:31.360]  and you know I've been asked people have said to me well could we have taken him
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:35.920]  alive and da-da-da I said I can't make any statement on that because you'd have
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:41.080]  to be there you'd have to be part of the operation if the Navy SEALs indeed did
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.160]  kill Ben Laudan well they're the best unit that doing that because that's their
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.840]  expertise and they could accomplish that mission if the mission were indeed
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:55.720]  true do I think it's true or not I don't know because my government has lied to
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:01.040]  me so often I mean look at when they lied about the death of Pat Tillman they
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:06.160]  lied about the Jessica Lynch recovery they lied about weapons of mass
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:11.320]  destruction they lied about ties to al-Qaeda in Iraq so really the government
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:16.480]  has no credibility with me so when I hear a story that they accomplished this
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.960]  and then there's so many other weird things about it like they buried him at
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:27.160]  sea 24 hours later well why and then they said it was Muslim religion I might be
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:31.520]  wrong but I think isn't that Jewish where you have to bury within 24 hours
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:36.880]  I'm not an expert on religions but I'm not sure that that's part of the
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.920]  Muslim religion or not no the imams have come out and said that you need to be
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:46.120]  buried after you've been washed force facing Mecca and that burial at sea is
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:51.320]  a big no no well okay then there you got it so why did they bury him at sea I
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:56.680]  guess because the Navy caught him that's the only thing I could come up with but
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:01.960]  uh no I you know they won't show us photos they're just telling us he's dead
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:07.000]  and I guess it's worked so many times before Alex why wouldn't it work again
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.640]  well you you bring up the point of lies it came out last Wednesday that White
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:20.640]  House did not watch the live killing then they said he fought back and the
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.160]  seals had to kill and then they said he didn't fight back and they took him out
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:27.800]  and then killed him then they said he uses wife as a human shield and they
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:32.440]  said that didn't happen and then they won't show us the body I mean this is
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:38.440]  very very very bizarre but but but I can tell you this Alex as far as the
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:43.160]  operational and on the ground being the knuckle draggers the seals that did the
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:51.400]  op um it shows me that policy hasn't changed at all since vietnam because in
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:56.280]  vietnam our standard policy if we were going to do a kidnapping or going to do
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:02.040]  something of this order would be you offer the person one time and if the
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.640]  person doesn't fully cooperate you then take them out you you know eliminate
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:13.440]  them and it's that quick so whoever the operator if it indeed happened as they
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:18.680]  said it went down whoever the operator the operational leader on the ground was
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:23.160]  I fully could see why he would be taken out that quickly because that's no
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:27.800]  different than what it was in vietnam that you give one opportunity and if
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:32.960]  they so choose to not exercise that opportunity then you eliminate them well
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:37.160]  what's amazing is they showed this White House situation room and said that
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:41.520]  they were watching bin Laden being killed then they said actually that the video
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.680]  cut out for 24 minutes and they didn't watch it and they lied about that and
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:49.840]  then and then Jessica Lynch for three days she's there at the hospital the
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.120]  Iraqis have pulled out the doctors go and say please come here and get her
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:57.680]  Jerry Bruckheimer gets on satellite feed the director scripts how to do this
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.280]  staged rescue turns out she didn't fight in the convoy the other guys did
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:06.320]  and then magically those guys all died in a week getting shot in the head or
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:10.280]  grounding or running off the road with Pat Tillman he writes letters home
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:14.520]  saying I'm coming home to be anti-war he gets shot three times in the head at
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:18.720]  close range they claim that he was killed by al-qaeda till the army corner
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.680]  report came out saying foul play was shown I mean you're at the Gulf of
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:27.240]  Tonkin the list goes on and on so so bottom line I mean this this looks like
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:32.200]  an election ploy stunt and I don't believe a word of it what's your view well
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:36.920]  again I don't know why you know I gotta delve into it I gotta start reading on
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:40.440]  it when I get back to the states and I'll make a few phone calls with people
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:44.960]  and I know and and see what I can tap on the behind the scenes you know I'm
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:50.320]  still a bit connected to the to the SEAL units and I can't believe they that
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:54.560]  they would knowingly participate in a fraud but then again I guess if you
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:59.000]  ordered to do something you have to do what you're ordered to do you know but
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.640]  I can't see a SEAL platoon actively participating in a fraud unless they
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:08.000]  pulled the fraud on them too and maybe they had some guy there that looked like
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.640]  bin Laden and did him in I don't know well that's exactly how they operate
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:17.480]  that's exactly they have decoys people that are set up and now they release
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:23.200]  this video of the five videos four of them were previously released videos
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.240]  we've gone and shown the exact same video was released one of them four
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:31.840]  years ago and but they cut the audio out so it wouldn't be too obvious and the
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:37.240]  one video that's new is that old guy from the side whose ears don't even look
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:42.360]  like bin Laden supposedly watching bin Laden on TV yeah I did see that
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.600]  photograph last night and I kind of chuckled at it and I thought that's him
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:51.120]  and then I thought to myself well then what they really did was just shot an
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:58.080]  old man in his bed right we're sitting there with his wives I don't know again
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:01.920]  I can't comment on what happened on the ground because I'm not privy to anything
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:06.800]  that went down with the actual platoon over there but they could do it make it
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:12.000]  certainly accomplish it if it was real whether it's real or not Alex I
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.840]  have no way of knowing but you're saying that you do question the official
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.360]  story because you've been lied to so much yeah absolutely absolutely I mean
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:26.600]  for the last decade it's been nothing but lies whether it's the Bush administration
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:31.040]  or the Obama administration it's why after life like I said we're to the point
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:36.760]  now Alex I have to go to court to be able to fly in my own country what kind of
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:41.800]  country is that when you got to go to court to be able to fly and not be
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:46.480]  searched it's prove you're innocent every time you go to an airport it's
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:51.000]  amazing they've now announced today and it's actually set up months ago the new
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.720]  alert system was really integrated in years ago they're gonna be breaking out
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:16:00.880]  smartphones cell phones computers radio TV with government alerts messages from
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:08.440]  the president forcing you to watch them 9000 locations 800 Walmart's walls are
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:13.200]  getting telescreens saying nobody's safe watch your neighbor trust no one but
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.400]  government I mean is that not 1984 governor I don't know why are they
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:21.840]  doing that Alex what what are we supposed to do we're all supposed to go to
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:26.640]  Walmart and watch them on TV when they come on well it's about them forcing
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:31.040]  their way into our lives Chucky Schumer and now Amtrak looks like they're gonna
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:37.280]  agree as well as other terminals around the country to have TSA sticking their
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:40.840]  hands down our pants have you seen the new video of the six-year-old having
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.240]  stick their hands on her pants or the one-year-old baby with them pulling the
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.560]  diaper off no I didn't see the one-year-old baby with the diaper but I did
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.200]  see the young child I was on with Lou Dobbs that particular day right before I
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:58.200]  left to go back to Mexico on the book tour and not you know Lou Lou was I
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.080]  raped over and he thanked me for bringing my lawsuit on behalf of millions
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.600]  of Americans including himself for standing up for this stuff and but you
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:11.920]  know that's about all you can do I mean we just got to be vigilant Alex and not
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:15.960]  accept this as normal behavior and what's supposed to be a free country
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:22.520]  well how could TSA if there were real terrorists protect cornfields rural
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:28.200]  areas highways hundreds of thousands of miles of train they claim the al-Qaeda
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:34.680]  documents that the boogeyman bin Laden had so they want to go up and derail
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:38.760]  trains so how is searching everybody that gets on trains and putting them
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:42.680]  through a no-ride list how is that gonna stop al-Qaeda I mean how are they
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:50.520]  gonna stop anybody I mean I'm trying to figure out if they try to make us
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:54.440]  believe that there's like millions of them out there they claim there's less
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:59.520]  than a hundred in Afghanistan less than a hundred in Pakistan maybe 100 well
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.880]  that means there's more hell's angels than there are al-Qaeda right well also
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:09.240]  Jesse let me ask you this question absolutely there's more hell's angels
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:15.280]  than there are al-Qaeda then well well here's another question if they say he
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:19.600]  didn't resist and that the seals got him and then executed him why if he's the
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.080]  greatest intelligence asset in the world knows where all the al-Qaeda bodies
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:29.120]  are buried knows the next attack why execute Osama bin Laden and they're
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.200]  telling us tortures great and tortures wonderful because it gets data well then
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.880]  why not take bin Laden and torture him exactly well that again though that's a
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:41.720]  question that would happen in the field and I can understand the seal operative
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:46.160]  because if it was the same as Vietnam it should give them one opportunity if
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:51.720]  they fail to do that you eliminate them pretty much and that's unconventional
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:56.200]  warfare and that's what the seals are about it's not conventional warfare and
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:01.160]  not but I certainly would rather capture him absolutely this guy would know
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:05.480]  everything supposedly about al-Qaeda why wouldn't you attempt to capture him
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:10.320]  first so that you could gain knowledge from this guy to war or to warrant off
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:14.720]  other attacks or whatever it might be it's it seems stupid to just a plane
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:19.840]  executed him without trying to at first capture him but again Jesse let me stop
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.920]  you they can't speak for the guys on the ground who actually did the op I don't
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:27.920]  know sure but my point is sir they changed the story first they said he
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:32.040]  resisted fired at them that the helicopter got hurt by being fired at
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:35.640]  then they changed that then he uses wife as a shield then they said no now they
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:39.840]  say he didn't resist they took him and executed him they had him they they
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:43.560]  executed him and the word is if you believe he was killed he had knowledge
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:49.320]  of being CIA in the 80s and 90s Clinton had a chance to get him in 96 in Sudan
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:52.840]  and they didn't want that out so they were ordered to killing then Obama said
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:56.600]  no we didn't order him to be killed so the point is we're being lied to they've

[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:11.680]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:18.680]  governor Ventura and I were just talking during the break and he was having
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:22.680]  time to really cogitate on the whole bin Laden situation he takes off part of
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:27.080]  the year and goes down and writes books and researches down in the Baja
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:30.640]  Mexico and surfs but he was going didn't minister Budo the president of
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.480]  Pakistan come out and say he'd been killed and then she got killed a week
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:38.200]  later at execution style and Pakistani intelligence former head told me here it
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:43.240]  was Cheney had her killed and and wasn't it in 2003 on the election we had
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:46.640]  Madeleine Albright come out and say he was dead and that Bush was thinking
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:50.200]  about rolling him out then Walter Cronkite did it then Teresa Heinz Kerry
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.400]  did it and so Bush backed off I had Steve Pacenek the guy that co-wrote the
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:25:00.480]  books with with of course you know the very famous writer Tom Clancy he was
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:05.160]  the head of black op operations worked with the seals in psychological warfare
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:09.960]  the Delta Force he told me in April 2002 governor that that he died a kidney
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:12.920]  failure and they were going to roll him out later claiming that we'd killed him
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:17.720]  so with all those high-powered people saying that and then them changing the
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:23.200]  story so much what is your gut tell you I mean you said again it causes me
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:28.520]  concern over the fact that this guy supposedly was on a dialysis machine way
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:33.480]  back ten years ago how could he survive that long if he needed dialysis
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:37.800]  treatments all the time I mean I don't know it too many people that are that
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.280]  overly active if they require dialysis treatment on a regular basis
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:48.640]  well he had several diseases that on average people die within two years the
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:55.280]  longest lived are six total renal failure that's why even CBS News reported
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:59.280]  he was at the American Hospital in quote Dubai being treated by American
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:04.560]  doctors and even Dan rather went and interviewed him and this was just months
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:09.640]  before 9-11 I mean he was near death then yeah you know and so I don't know I
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:13.640]  don't know what to believe Alex it's it's that's the disturbing thing about
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:18.760]  being a United States citizen today is the fact that you can't believe mainstream
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:22.240]  media because mainstream media is totally bought and sold and they're in
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:27.680]  bed with the government and you know that's their job now is to simply report
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:32.840]  what the government wants us told and in light of that fact you have to learn
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:37.000]  everything on shows like yours and and on the internet and all these other
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.760]  alternative places where you can attempt to get through them and learn the
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:46.920]  truth but again everyone's susceptible to being misled no matter where it is be
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:51.520]  at the internet or where else so it really boggles the mind I'm trying to
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:55.800]  figure it out that's why I don't like to make rash decisions on it I like to look
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:00.760]  at the thing take my time and do my own studying rather than just simply reacting
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:06.000]  to what media says to me well we're gonna get a headline out at info wars.com
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.800]  my writer was just in here during the break trying to get an answer from me
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:15.320]  with what to go with obviously it's big news your opinion is highly valued out
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:19.520]  there by independence and people that love liberty and I think that the fair
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.640]  headline is governor Jesse Ventura or Jesse Ventura I've been lied to so
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:30.520]  much I question or I need more information I mean what should the
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:35.360]  headline be? I've been lied to so much I question everything the government tells
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:40.560]  me it's that simple Alex. And you went on to question they lied about Lynch and
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:48.520]  did a Jerry Bruckheimer production. They lied about the murder of Pat Tillman which is
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:53.600]  unconscionable when they tried to turn that into a political staged deal to
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:59.240]  support their war in political position unbelievable they've lied so often about
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:05.200]  so many things. WMDs fake documents on that it turned out they ordered
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:10.360]  the US did ordered England in the White House memo to fix intelligence along
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:14.440]  with us that we were gonna go ahead and go to war. Yeah exactly I mean we've been
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:20.240]  getting lied to for the most of the last decade it's unbelievable so the simple
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:24.920]  thing is I don't know what to believe because my government lies to me they
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:28.760]  have no credibility with me. Let me expand on that we're about to go to
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:34.200]  break with a long segment coming up but the New York Post on May 7th ran a
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:38.680]  headline the truth hurts and they said that Governor Jesse Ventura has since
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:42.560]  reversed his position that he believed bin Laden was dead well you were just
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:45.360]  going off what even mainline news was saying that it was believed he was dead
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:49.640]  and they said he's since reversed his position. I then searched and I knew you
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:53.520]  were in Mexico there was no news on you in over a month since you'd been in
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:58.520]  Mexico and I looked for you doing a reversal on bin Laden you never did it
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.800]  so here they are correct me if I'm wrong saying you reversed yourself when you
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:07.520]  never did it. No I've never made it. Alex this is the first day I've done an
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:11.640]  interview since my book tour and you were on my book tour that's what three four
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:17.040]  weeks ago. Time magazine's out saying that I've reversed myself now that they've
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:22.120]  released these videos which a bunch of them are old already released says well
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:26.280]  Jones now has to basically admit he's wrong I did not do that I'm right I
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:30.480]  know it's totally fake I predicted all this years ago but that's what they do
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:35.120]  they're they think their readers are a bunch of idiots and that's why the
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:38.520]  mainstream media is dying Governor Jesse Ventura folks this book is really
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:42.120]  waking a lot of folks up available at info wars.com the book is doing
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:46.360]  extremely well that's why he's back we'll talk about the huge success of 63
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:49.440]  documents the government doesn't want you to read with Governor Jesse Ventura on
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:55.440]  the other side stay with us. We're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:30:03.600]  and the GCN radio network. You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:07.280]  Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:11.280]  silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lung
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:14.840]  System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:19.680]  in or on the body. My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:23.920]  Silver Lungs Generator. Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless

[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:05.280]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:09.040]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:13.560]  Number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:17.120]  company allows you to have. It's true total government control of
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:21.480]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three in
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:25.840]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:29.600]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:33.720]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:37.680]  families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five a solar power
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:41.520]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks I
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:44.200]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:50.200]  Science. One of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:54.280 --> 01:33:21.280]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America today.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:26.280]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live with former Minnesota Governor Jesse
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:33.280]  Ventura. I'm Alex Jones and the website is www.weaintgottimedoblade.com.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:40.280]  www.weaintgottimedoblade.com. Our sites are www.infoowars.com and www.prisonplanet.tv.
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:48.280]  Again, I'm here reading from cbsnews.com where they admit that the White House
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:55.280]  issued a photo of them in the situation room watching the operation. Now it turns
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:58.280]  out they have to admit they watched nothing. The whole thing was a stage
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:02.280]  fake. But you can look at the photo with Hillary with her hand over her mouth,
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:07.280]  Obama all looking tough. They clearly scripted this entire thing and
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:11.280]  Governor, just going over more of the lies we've been told. I mean, government
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:17.280]  is constantly being caught in lies and I think it's common sense to question.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:22.280]  You know what bothers me, here's what troubles me, Alex, about the lying, is
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:28.280]  that when we lie to them, we go to jail. It's that simple. I mean, look at right
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:33.280]  now in baseball, you got Barry Bonds, he might go to jail. You got Roger Clemens,
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:38.280]  he might go to jail. And of course, Martha Stewart did go to jail and she
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:43.280]  didn't go for insider trading. She went to jail for lying to the government.
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:48.280]  So that's one thing that really disturbs me. The government can lie to us
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:53.280]  and there's no repercussions to them. They do it all the time. And yet
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:58.280]  when we lie to them, we face jail time. Or when they say we lie, I mean,
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:02.280]  these new federal laws they've had the last decade have put hundreds of
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:05.280]  thousands of people in prison where you've actually done nothing wrong.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:11.280]  But then they claim that you lied on your finances and they find $10 more
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:15.280]  or $10 less than you said. And they go, technically, you lied. It doesn't
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:18.280]  matter that it's really a mistake, you go to prison.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:22.280]  Well, you know, like I said, you got the high profile cases like baseball.
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:27.280]  And I always question, what is steroid use in baseball have to do with
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:32.280]  the government? Nothing, you know? And so, and it's that whole premise that
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:37.280]  if we lie to them, we go to jail. And yet it seems every politician in this
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:42.280]  country lying must be the major course they take in college.
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:47.280]  I don't know. I didn't go to college, Alex. Do they have a course on lying?
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:51.280]  Well, what they've done is they've tried to break our will and just train us
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:55.280]  to accept total corruption. I want to shift gears into another facet of this
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:00.280]  whole bin Laden hoax that's being used to roll out even more tyranny.
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:04.280]  They're now saying, you've got to give up even more rights. Al-Qaeda attacks
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:09.280]  are imminent. They're going to attack everything. They've got 160 buried nukes.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:14.280]  KSM, who they've been torturing for, what is it, six years now, who confessed
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:22.280]  to bombing buildings that were built after he was kidnapped or given rendition.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:27.280]  KSM, two weeks before 9-11, they released a statement claiming KSM said
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:32.280]  there are buried nukes in Europe and the U.S. and bin Laden will detonate them.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:35.280]  He has orders to detonate them if he is killed.
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:39.280]  Now, the Associated Press, in fact, let's pull that up on screen.
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:44.280]  KSM, nukes buried in America. The mainstream media is reporting nukes
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:48.280]  buried in Europe and America from KSM. Bin Laden knows where they're buried.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:53.280]  The Navy SEALs are ordered not to kill him. That's now the official story.
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:56.280]  But then they do kill him as if they wouldn't follow their orders.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:01.280]  And Dick Cheney comes out and says Obama should reinstate waterboarding.
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:08.280]  He told Fox Sunday. He told Chris Wallace that on Fox,
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:12.280]  former Vice President Dick Cheney said Sunday that President Barack Obama
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:16.280]  should put waterboarding back on the table.
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:19.280]  And then I want to shift to this article by Washington's blog.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:22.280]  The U.S. government used communist torture techniques specifically designed
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:28.280]  to produce false confessions. And then he has links to the Navy SEAL training
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:35.280]  and the Army training. And it says that they now have announced as of 2009
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:39.280]  and that Senator Levin is commenting on the Senate Armed Services Committee
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:44.280]  report on torture, declassified today, drops the following bombshell
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:48.280]  that the survival of Asian resistance. This is when you said years ago,
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:51.280]  you talk about how you've been waterboarded and it is torture,
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:53.280]  and that you'd be happy to waterboard Dick Cheney,
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:58.280]  that they're actually using the S-E-R-E techniques that SEALs
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:02.280]  and other special forces are put through in the basic training now
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:06.280]  of advanced troops in this survival of Asian resistance.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:08.280]  They're not teaching them how to take the torture.
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:14.280]  They're teaching them how to torture now that was declassified last week.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:17.280]  Governor, what do you say about Cheney pushing this
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:19.280]  and them now training the troops how to torture?
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:23.280]  Well, like I said before, Dick Cheney should be a man of his word
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:27.280]  and he should try it first before he recommends it.
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:32.280]  It's that simple. Dick Cheney needs to lie down and be waterboarded
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:34.280]  and that way he'll know what he's talking about
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:37.280]  because right now Dick Cheney speaks out of ignorance.
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:41.280]  He doesn't know what he's talking about because he's never had it done to him.
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:45.280]  So I think the first thing Dick Cheney should do is volunteer to have it done.
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:51.280]  I just read in today's paper that he's contemplating whether he needs a new heart or not.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:56.280]  Well, if he gets waterboarded, he won't have to make that decision anymore.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:00.280]  What do you make of them taking this training that you talked about
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:02.280]  going through survival of Asian resistance?
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:05.280]  SEAL school was required back when I was in the Navy.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.280]  If you were going anywhere into a combat zone,
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:11.280]  they required you to pass successfully complete SEAL school,
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:14.280]  which was called survival escape resistance and evasion.
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:18.280]  Now that's where you were essentially waterboarded. Everybody was.
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:24.280]  You spent the 24 hours at a mock POW camp and all of this stuff
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:29.280]  because you never knew, I guess, if you were going to face that as a reality after you deployed.
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:34.280]  As far as teaching people how to do those techniques,
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:39.280]  I think that's very, very wrong because if you're involved in a war,
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:43.280]  you're supposed to treat your enemy combatant with a certain amount of respect.
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:47.280]  If they've surrendered to you and I think that as a country,
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:52.280]  we should always be taking the high ground and for Dick Cheney to come out
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:54.280]  and advocate torture again.
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:57.280]  Well, that means he's putting us on the low ground again
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:02.280]  because then when somebody tortures us or when somebody does something to us,
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:07.280]  we will have no recourse or no high ground position to take anymore
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:09.280]  because the fact is we do it.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.280]  So therefore, how can we be morally on high ground at all?
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:19.280]  And I think to ask the question, here's a guy with five deferments from the military
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:24.280]  telling us what foreign policy we should have and how we should operate
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:28.280]  with enemy combatants or enemy soldiers or everything like that.
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:34.280]  A guy who he himself was a coward and got five deferments from the Vietnam War.
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:40.280]  How dare him and how dare anybody even give this guy to bother to listen to him?
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:42.280]  Is that bold enough for you, Alex?
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:44.280]  Yes, sir, it is bold and expanding on that.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:47.280]  Bush wrote a book last year admitting he ordered torture.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.280]  He'd do it again.
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:53.280]  The Army's own report from Abu Ghraib admits small children were raped in front of their parents.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.280]  That's NBC News.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:56.280]  You want to pull up the full report.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:58.280]  You got the will to read it, listeners.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:00.280]  This is what the good guys supposedly do,
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.280]  but they're not even worried about moral high ground.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:04.280]  When foreigners do torture, it's horrible.
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:05.280]  It's terrible.
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:06.280]  They're dastardly.
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:07.280]  They're evil.
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:10.280]  But then simultaneously, it's good when we do it.
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:12.280]  They're trying to warp our minds.
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:13.280]  But here it is.
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:18.280]  It says, with last week's release of Department of Justice legal counsel opinions,
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:25.280]  it is now widely known that Bush administration officials distorted survival of Asian resistance and escape training
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:30.280]  a legitimate program used by the military to train our troops to resist abusive enemy interrogations
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:37.280]  by authorizing abusive techniques from the S-E-R-E Sears training for use in attaining interrogations.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:44.280]  So the point is, what was declassified last week is everybody getting Sears training at special forces level now.
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:46.280]  It's not how to resist it.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:47.280]  It's how to do it.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:50.280]  They're building an army of torturers.
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:56.280]  Well, then we should be hanging our head in shame because that's not, I don't care what happens.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:00.280]  That is not what the United States of America is supposed to be about, Alex.
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:08.280]  And like I said, if we lose all our moral high ground, then we certainly have lost the war on terror.
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:13.280]  Because, you know, when our Constitution and our bill of rights don't exist anymore,
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:15.280]  well, that means the terrorists have won.
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:18.280]  But I think that that happens internally.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.280]  It doesn't happen from the terrorists.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:22.280]  I think the terrorists are being used as an excuse.
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:25.280]  Well, I think there's no doubt whoever the terrorists are.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:30.280]  You know, it's Black Ops, private corporate criminal networks that are doing the lion's share of it,
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:32.280]  that the terrorists have won.
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:36.280]  And the government, the media are terrorizing us.
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:41.280]  What's your take, Governor, on we were told bin Laden's been killed after nine and a half years,
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:44.280]  and now they say, we got to take more rights.
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:45.280]  The terror threat's greater.
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:48.280]  Well, then that means as they kill more, then it makes more of a threat.
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:50.280]  I mean, when does this end?
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:57.280]  Well, I think the big, here's a question I want to ask, now that we've killed bin Laden, can't we bring all the troops home?
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:59.280]  Yes.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:02.280]  Isn't it time for us to now pack up and come home?
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:04.280]  Isn't the war over?
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:11.280]  If we indeed, if this was indeed the man who masterminded 9-11, and we've now killed him,
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:15.280]  like they told us that they have on May 1st or whatever the date was,
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:21.280]  well, then shouldn't we be getting immediate withdrawal from both Iraq and Afghanistan
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:25.280]  and bring all our men and women home?
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.280]  Incredible.
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:27.280]  Incredible.
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:28.280]  Let me raise another point.
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:29.280]  Jim Tuck...
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.280]  I mean, is that unreasonable?
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.280]  No, it's not.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:34.280]  It seems to me now we won the war.
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:39.280]  Isn't this the ultimate thing, was to get the guy that allegedly did 9-11?
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.280]  Well, now they're saying that...
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:42.280]  Although, you know, I'll tell you something, Alex.
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:44.280]  We needed to capture bin Laden.
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:51.280]  We needed to find out how he achieved 9-11, because what happened on 9-11,
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:57.280]  I believe today it was not a controlled demolition, it was not nanothermite,
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:02.280]  and it certainly was not the pancake effect of two planes hitting a building.
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:06.280]  There was something else in play there, Alex.
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.280]  There was a weapon in play that day that I don't even know what it is,
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:13.280]  but I can equate it to being like a microwave.
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:17.280]  You know how you can take a piece of chicken and put it on a paper plate
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:21.280]  and stick it in the microwave and the chicken will burn, but the paper plate won't?
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:22.280]  Yes.
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:26.280]  Well, something happened that day equivalent to a microwave,
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:31.280]  and by capturing bin Laden, maybe we could find out what weapon he truly has,
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:37.280]  because I just learned there were 1,400 cars toasted that day
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:39.280]  all over the streets of Manhattan.
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:44.280]  No, no, that's right. Cars that didn't have anything fall on them were completely fried,
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:47.280]  but expanding just like a secret helicopter reportedly crashed.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:50.280]  We know they're 30 years advanced what they really have,
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:54.280]  but there's another area that if you look at it, British physicists and others,
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:58.280]  and it turns out the government did measure this, you can confirm it,
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:06.280]  radioactive isotopes used in small nukes were picked up in levels off the charts and around the towers.
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:11.280]  No, I don't buy that. I don't buy that. Nukes were not used.
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:12.280]  Well, the radiation was picked up.
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:21.280]  No, I don't buy it because when those towers went down, there was less impact
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:28.280]  than when they brought down the Superdome in Seattle, and there should have been way more.
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:34.280]  Those towers literally disintegrated. They went into dust, and nukes don't do that,
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:39.280]  not at that level. They would radiation would have been extremely high.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:42.280]  Well, I'll tell you, tower one and two are very suspicious,
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:45.280]  but when you look at seven, that's a conventional control demolition.
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:50.280]  No, it isn't. No, it was not either, because you've got to read the book,
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:54.280]  Where did the Towers Go? by Dr. Judy Wood, the PS, MS and PS.
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:56.280]  No, I know who she is. I know who she is.
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:00.280]  I just finished her book. It's very remarkable.
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:06.280]  Well, I agree with you that tower one and two were exploded into pyrotechnic dust,
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:09.280]  and things were being ejected long distances.
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:15.280]  But seven, you can see the boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and the symmetrical collapse into its own footprint.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:22.280]  Yeah, but you also see it lathering up a half hour soon, where smoke started coming out
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:25.280]  of one side of the building and one side of the building only.
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:30.280]  You had cases that dust was everywhere with paper.
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:34.280]  Always remember, there's a simple thing.
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:44.280]  When something is hot, it will glow, but it doesn't have to be hot to glow.
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:46.280]  Not everything that glows.
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:49.280]  But not everything that glows is hot.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.280]  Well, I know this. They do have a lot of...
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:56.280]  The weapon used that day, Alex, but it's a weapon that's beyond anything that I know about.
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:00.280]  Well, I'll tell you what I want to know. I want to know why they killed bin Laden.
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:04.280]  If he knew how to make NORAD stand down, he knew how to have aircraft do maneuvers
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:08.280]  that the best fighter pilots couldn't do at Flight 77 at the Pentagon.
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:10.280]  He supposedly has these...
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:14.280]  We should have captured the guy. That should have been the highest priority.
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:21.280]  But again, I understand if it truly went down and the SEALs made the call on the ground,
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:26.280]  I understand why, because that's the same policy that we had for the last 40 years.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:29.280]  Here's my issue. Bin Laden couldn't carry out 9-11.
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:35.280]  We know the hijackers were ordered to be led into the U.S. via the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:39.280]  We know the head of the Defense Language School went public and said ATTA was trained there.
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.280]  Even Newsweek admits hijackers trained at U.S. bases.
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:44.280]  They were decoys. They were set up.
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:48.280]  And following the MO of these people, the SEALs probably thought,
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:50.280]  if they did do this mission, that they were killing bin Laden.
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:55.280]  And they had a lookalike in there who was playing part in some drill and then found out it was real.
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:58.280]  And the SEALs shot him and they threw him in the ocean and told the SEALs,
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:00.280]  good job you killed bin Laden.
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:02.280]  That's exactly how the globalists operate.
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:05.280]  But again, that is going through a theory.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:10.280]  All I know is that the official story of 9-11 doesn't fit into a guy in a cave
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:13.280]  being able to carry it out. And regardless, Governor, they've used 9-11.
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:19.280]  We got the Homeland Security Mic reports two years ago to go after the American people and to take our liberty.
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:24.280]  So it's been used. I mean, we know Saddam wasn't involved and they tried to frame him for it.
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:31.280]  Oh, absolutely. You know, again, America changed that fateful day and it changed for the worse.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:38.280]  And I just have a difficult time believing this bearded guy in a cave is responsible for all this.
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:43.280]  I just have a very hard time accepting that as being the truth.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:47.280]  You're right. I absolutely agree with you. We need to continue to investigate.
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:51.280]  It's certainly been used to kill our republics, something foreign terrorists couldn't do.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:55.280]  The government, no matter what administration, is in energetically attacks the Bill of Rights.
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:00.280]  By the way, look at these. They still don't admit that we did that show on my TV show, Alex.
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:06.280]  They're the one on police state that they pulled after one episode.
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.280]  That's right. And the network won't say anything.
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:11.280]  Governor, you told me privately what you think the future of the show is.
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:15.280]  Are you ready to tell folks more about the show getting censored with that particular episode?
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:19.280]  Well, I'll talk about that episode. Of course, it was last year.
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:28.280]  We did the episode on the police state where we produced the Homeland Security Bill that said FEMA was to build no less than six internment camps throughout the country.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:33.280]  And when I inquired as to who was going in these and why these were being built, you know,
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:43.280]  we got stiff opposition in Washington. And of course, they came down on the parent company of two TV and they pulled the show.
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:47.280]  It only aired once and now they won't even acknowledge that the show exists.
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:52.280]  And fortunately, you can see it because it aired that one time, so it's going to be out there on YouTube.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:57.280]  But officially, it's not part of the show anymore of the 15 episodes we did.
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:59.280]  I guess there's only actually 14 now.
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:04.280]  What about the future of conspiracy theory, which came out last season as the number one new show?
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:09.280]  Then they put it in the dead zone Friday night. Still the number one new show for second season.
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:16.280]  Record audience for those guys. And now you were telling me privately some things. Can you talk about that?
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:21.280]  Well, just that, you know, the balls in their cork, whether it'll be renewed or not, I can't say at this time.
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:28.280]  I don't know if it will or will not be, but they had to submit eight new conspiracy theories to them.
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:34.280]  And so they will look them over and I guess make a determination of whether we're back on the air or not.
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:38.280]  But they haven't promoted us at all, so that's not a good sign.
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:44.280]  Yeah, we should folks try to contact True TV or Time Warner and tell them put that good informative...
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:49.280]  I don't do that, Alex. If people want to do that, that's up to them.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:53.280]  But, you know, I won't ask for people to do that at all.
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:58.280]  You know, if people are inclined to want to do that, they certainly...
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:02.280]  You know, I encourage them that they certainly can, but I won't ask for that at all.
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:07.280]  Well, I'll say this. I mean, I know you told me on the road, well, I won't even get into it.
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:11.280]  It's not a lot of sweat off your back if they don't want to renew it. It's a lot of work.
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:14.280]  I mean, you guys fly all over the country. A lot of research.
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:19.280]  And that's another problem we have, Alex. What do I do about my flying situation now?
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:22.280]  Because I cannot fly commercial anymore.
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:26.280]  That's right. They don't want to pay for the private jet. I know that's probably part of it.
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:29.280]  So there is Homeland Security ruining your TV show.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:36.280]  Yeah, very well could be because of the fact that I, you know, I have the pending lawsuit and therefore I cannot fly commercially.
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:41.280]  So I can't go out on location anymore unless they fly me to private jet.
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:44.280]  And they certainly don't have the budget for that. I can assure you of that.
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:50.280]  Well, just like the Jews in Nazi Germany, first they wouldn't let them travel, wouldn't let them do business.
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:57.280]  Now Homeland Security, headed up by Schumer and others, are saying that you will be on a no-work list,
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:02.280]  no travel list, starting with trains, aircraft, no gun buy list, White House is pushing that.
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:08.280]  Just a magic list that they just put you on and they admit in the Washington Post, anti-war people, pro-gun,
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:14.280]  property rights people, tea party people are now being barred over two million on the list.
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:17.280]  The government just puts you on a list and now soon it will be...
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:20.280]  Alex, how do you find out if you're on the list?
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:24.280]  They won't tell you why you're on it. You just suddenly can't travel.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:27.280]  Boy, that's Nazi Germany right there.
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:32.280]  That's ridiculous. I mean, why can't you go and inquire whether you're on the list or not?
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:35.280]  I mean, it seems to me you should be able to do that.
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:38.280]  Well, what do you think of them? Well, you might be a terrorist, Governor.
[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:41.280]  What do you think about everybody's a terrorist but the government crooks robbing us.
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:47.280]  It's now been confirmed, 27 trillion, as we broke down two years ago or a year and a half ago, 27 trillion,
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:51.280]  just up until about a year and a half into the bailout, the rest is secret,
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:59.280]  27 trillion to foreign banks and people like MSNBC got Federal Reserve taxpayer money to push propaganda.
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:05.280]  And now we learn what's going on, but let's not worry about the bankers robbing us and the dollar plunging.
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:08.280]  Let's all worry about terrorists under the table, Governor.
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:14.280]  Not only terrorists under the table, but like these three gentlemen I ran into at the golf course the other day,
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:19.280]  they were more worried about that we got to stop these unions.
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:24.280]  You know, these union benefits that these state workers have, we got to get rid of that.
[01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:30.280]  I looked at these guys and said, oh, you want to bust them but you don't want to do nothing about Wall Street, huh?
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:32.280]  Oh, man.
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:40.280]  Well, I mean, look, look, look, they always talk about free market. Wall Street is the main piglet on the teat of the hog,
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:46.280]  and it's a piglet four or five times bigger than the mama hog, and the rest of the population is starving,
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:53.280]  runt piglets with our bones showing, and Wall Street's sitting there bigger than mama, sucking everything out of mama.
[01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:56.280]  Basically, it's a vampire pig sucking the blood out of mama.
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:01.280]  I got a good idea, too, Alex. Let's stop benefits for elected officials.
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:03.280]  Yes.
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:09.280]  Let's truly make it public service, that if you go there to get elected, you do public service.
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:15.280]  You don't get your own retirement fund. You don't get your own medical healthcare,
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:20.280]  but you have to have the same healthcare that any other government employee has.
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:25.280]  That's a good point. They make themselves exempt from the rules we're under and the system that they create for us.
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:28.280]  Just like you pointed out, government can lie all day and never gets in trouble,
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:31.280]  but if they claim we lie, we go to the gulag.
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:35.280]  Yeah, we go to jail for it. No, absolutely. We should cut out all benefits for them,
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:39.280]  make them survive the same way we have to.
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:44.280]  Like right now, they're going to revamp Social Security and all that.
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:47.280]  Isn't it interesting? They don't get Social Security.
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:49.280]  Very well said. Governor, we're almost out of time.
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:54.280]  We have a deal at infowars.com that when you get Jesse Ventura's 63 documents,
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:58.280]  the government doesn't want you to read incredible hardcover, wake up anybody out there.
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:04.280]  It's only proven admitted crimes and outrageous terrorist events and government drug dealing.
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:09.280]  It's an amazing book and you get Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True,
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:14.280]  discounted with it by Mark Dice. You can get any of my new films or films I've produced,
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:19.280]  whatever film you choose, DVD film, free when you get it with Governor Ventura's book
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:23.280]  along with Big Brother or get either one of these books by themselves,
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:30.280]  all available at infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:36.280]  The good news is, Governor, my radio show and websites are exponentially growing.
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:40.280]  Your book is way up there on the bestseller list week after week.
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:45.280]  You know what's interesting about it though, Alex? This is my second book way up on the bestseller list
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:51.280]  and again, it hasn't been reviewed by any mainstream media to my knowledge.
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:53.280]  Absolutely, the fix is in.
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:58.280]  Yeah, no, I mean they don't review my books at all, they ignore them completely, they completely ignore them.
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:02.280]  No matter how long they stay on the New York Times Top 10.
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:06.280]  But here's the difference, in the past if they did that with a book, it would never even make it on the charts.
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:12.280]  Now the alternative media, the real media is growing so fast, they're panicking, but here's the problem.
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:17.280]  This isn't an internet kill switch that Homeland Security set up, it's really an internet takeover system
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:21.280]  and the government's admitting now they may start shutting down alternative media
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:27.280]  and that they're going to start broadcasting government announcements over all media breaking in.
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.280]  I mean, doesn't that sound like the running man?
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:34.280]  Yeah, it sounds like, boy, we'll sure get the truth then, won't we, Alex?
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:42.280]  My goodness, it'll be just fountains of information and truth for us as Steve Buscemi said in Fargo.
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:48.280]  Oh man, so much is happening, we've only got about 2-3 minutes left with you, Governor.
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:54.280]  Of course the website is WeAin'tGotTimeToBelied.com, get the book, 63DocsAtInfoWars.com,
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:59.280]  support the Gov and his work, support my work, but more importantly, get a tool that you can read yourself
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:04.280]  and pass on to others. This book is tailor made to wake up people who are skeptics
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:09.280]  because it's all government documents with the URLs of the government, so you can go check it out for yourself
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:13.280]  and no wonder the system won't review this because they're scared of it.
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:17.280]  The truth hurts, the tyrants. When are you coming back to the U.S.?
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:21.280]  Because as fast as things are moving, we look forward to having you back on.
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:26.280]  I'll probably be back in the U.S. shortly after the Memorial weekend.
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:28.280]  Alright, so we look forward.
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:33.280]  I'll be back then because you know why I'm delaying my trip because we had so much snow in Minnesota
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:38.280]  that six of the greens at my golf course had to go tamp.
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:39.280]  Wow.
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:43.280]  So, hell, I ain't got nothing to come back for, Alex, if there ain't golf.
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:47.280]  You know, I'm going to take golf back up again just so I make myself not work all the time.
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:51.280]  Maybe sometime you come visit me again in Austin, we'll go play some golf.
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:55.280]  Well, we could do that, but remember that Texas is the home of the Texas wedge.
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:57.280]  You know what that is, don't you?
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:58.280]  Yes.
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:04.280]  That's where you pop 30 yards off the green because the ground's so hard you can't get a sandwich down into it.
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:06.280]  It's like hitting concrete.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:09.280]  Oh, man.
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:12.280]  I know that from playing Willie's course with him.
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:14.280]  Absolutely. Absolutely.
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:17.280]  Well, hey, listen, Gav, it was great having you on.
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:21.280]  I'll stay here and I'll be back up in the States within a month and we'll talk then.
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:23.280]  Alright, we're going to break.
[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:25.280]  Let me just say bye to you right here.
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:27.280]  I just want to commend you.
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:30.280]  Where exactly is the book on the best seller?
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:32.280]  Last time I saw it was number four on Amazon.
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:36.280]  Yeah, it was number four on the New York Times for like three or four weeks in a row now.
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:38.280]  It's been right at number four pretty solid.
[01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:40.280]  All the information.
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:45.280]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:50.280]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:57.280]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:00.280]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:03.280]  Folks, this is Steve Shank with E-Foods Direct.
[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:07.280]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:09.280]  You must act automatically.
[01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:12.280]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:15.280]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:19.280]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door,
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:23.280]  you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:30.280]  You need a five-day extreme emergency kit with serious supplies and real food to secure to adults for five days.
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:38.280]  This powerful $300 extreme emergency kit is free with an order of at least $995 from E-Foods Direct.

[01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:59.280]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:10.280]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:11.280]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:13.280]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:17.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:22.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:27.280]  Well, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura really boiled it down.
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:32.280]  The government's been caught lying, killing, stealing, staging events,
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:38.280]  staging events to get us into wars, lying about WMDs, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies.
[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:44.280]  And then lies all over the official story. I've been lying and shooting back, not shooting back.
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:52.280]  Obama watching it live in the Situation Room, didn't bury it at sea.
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:58.280]  That's why so many Americans in polls that are out there now are not buying this.
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:01:01.280]  Now, I want to recap.
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:09.280]  Well, here's an example. New York Post said that Jesse's now reversed his position.
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:10.280]  And there was no link to it.
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:14.280]  So I did intensive searching and found he hadn't done any interviews in over a month.
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:15.280]  He's been in Mexico.
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:18.280]  Besides, I know when they get ready to do interviews, they call me.
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:20.280]  Either his son does or one of his publishers.
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:22.280]  And I knew he hadn't done it.
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:24.280]  And I said, sir, did you say you retract your position?
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:25.280]  He said, no.
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:28.280]  New York Post is a pack of liars.
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:33.280]  New York Post's page six has been caught in gossip threatening people to write bad things about them
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:35.280]  if they don't pay them money.
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:42.280]  Rupert Murdoch's outfit has been caught wiretapping people for data when he's not pushing global warming taxes.
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:46.280]  So that was incredible.
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:49.280]  I mean, these people are just amazing.
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:53.280]  They're hoax masters.
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:59.280]  The birtherism is dead, you know, are the headlines because of the new fake long form.
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:00.280]  He probably was born there.
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:01.280]  I've always said that.
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.280]  The point is they want to make it a debate.
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:06.280]  The point is that birth certificate is fake.
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:09.280]  And they made it fake to make everybody fight over it.
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:16.280]  And the point is they say, oh, the death orism is dead now that they've released the videos have been lauding.
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:19.280]  But four of the five were released years ago.
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:24.280]  In two minutes, you can pull up that it's the same old videos.
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:28.280]  I mean, they think we are so dumb.
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:29.280]  I don't know.
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:32.280]  They may have killed the Easter Bunny last Sunday in there.
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:34.280]  The Lucky Charms guy.
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:35.280]  I don't know.
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:37.280]  The point is I know they're a pack of liars.
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:41.280]  I mean, do you do business with people that have cheated you once, twice, three times?
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:44.280]  If I think somebody's trying to cheat me, I don't work with them.
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:45.280]  You cheat me once.
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:47.280]  I never talk to you again.
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:49.280]  You cheat me twice.
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:50.280]  You know, cheat me once.
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:51.280]  Shame on you.
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:52.280]  Cheat me twice.
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:53.280]  Shame on me.
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:59.280]  How about thousands of times lying, stealing, manipulating, manufacturing, and we just sit there and go, oh, take my rights.
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:00.280]  The terrorists are going to get me.
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:02.280]  The terrorists are going to get me.
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:11.280]  I want to recap the incredible, incredible developments of the announcement of more and more media takeover by government break-ins on your cell phones.
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:13.280]  No travel list.
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:22.280]  Just absolutely incredible information coming up after this break.
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:26.280]  And then I want to go through the 10 facts that prove Bin Laden Fable is a contrived hoax.
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:28.280]  We're going to go over that.
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:37.280]  And then we're going to take your calls, but specifically from military and police, because I've heard police on talk radio going.
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:40.280]  I don't believe the SEALs got their reports wrong five times of what happened in there.
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:41.280]  That's a lie.
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:58.280]  I want to hear from you your view of how obvious it is to have the government saying they're going to break in over the cell phones, the TV, the radio, these announcements, and no travel list on trains that are going to expand to cars, no work list, all being announced.
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:00.280]  What did military people?
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:01.280]  What do police?
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:04.280]  Because you're the folks they're going to try to use against the American people.
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:06.280]  And I've been to your drills.
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:12.280]  I know they've trained all the local police for riot control and martial law, and it's now been declassified.
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:14.280]  I just knew about it a decade ago.
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:17.280]  I mean, have you chosen a side?
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:19.280]  Do you recognize what's going on here?
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:23.280]  So the Bin Laden situation, the lies of that, I want to get your take.
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:24.280]  Here's the toll-free number.
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:28.280]  800-259-9231.
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:32.280]  800-259-9231.
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:36.280]  I mean, it'd be like a wife or a husband.
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:40.280]  If you caught your husband cheating on you once and they said, baby, I'll never do it again, I promise.
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:42.280]  And you caught him a week later in bed with another woman.
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:43.280]  Baby, I promise.
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:44.280]  Maybe you get suckered.
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:45.280]  Then a month later, caught again.
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:47.280]  Baby, I swear never again.
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:48.280]  Catch him again.
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:49.280]  Catch him again.
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:50.280]  Catch him again.
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:51.280]  Baby, I promise I won't.
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:52.280]  I didn't, baby.
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:54.280]  What's this bra doing in the back of your car?
[02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:55.280]  I promise, baby.
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:56.280]  I promise.
[02:04:56.280 --> 02:04:57.280]  I'm not lying to you, baby.
[02:04:57.280 --> 02:05:02.280]  Oh, you know.
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:05.280]  Maybe you're arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:06.280]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:10.280]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:12.280]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:18.280]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:24.280]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cares, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:30.280]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:34.280]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:38.280]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:44.280]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:48.280]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:50.280]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:51.280]  It's here.

[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:28.280]  There are several types of oil and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials.
[02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:36.280]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:41.280]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:49.280]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:54.280]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:58.280]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:04.280]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:09.280]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology.
[02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:18.280]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:21.280]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:25.280]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:29.280]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup.
[02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:39.280]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:42.280]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:47.280]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:51.280]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:53.280]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:29.280]  I want to recap our top stories, get to some other news I haven't covered yet, and at the bottom of the hour, you can start calling in now.
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:34.280]  I want to hear from police, military, because if tyranny is going to come to our door, it's going to come in a uniform.
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:37.280]  More and more, it's going to come in the form of citizen spy networks.
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:43.280]  In fact, let's queue up Obama's clip about the domestic security force and that Rahm Emanuel clip as well.
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:51.280]  And then we're going to go over the 10 facts that prove that Bin Laden fabled as a contrived hoax that I promised to get to yesterday and ran out of time and didn't.
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:57.280]  But for those that just joined us, it has been announced, the internal passport for America.
[02:08:57.280 --> 02:09:03.280]  We have those articles up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:08.280]  And you notice they catch Bin Laden and they say, now we've got to take more of your rights.
[02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:10.280]  We've got to have TSA at shopping malls.
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:13.280]  They were announcing that, by the way, before the Bin Laden capture.
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:15.280]  There's buried nukes.
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:17.280]  We've got to search everybody everywhere.
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:24.280]  On its face, and this is what I want to ask police and military, if they're conscious and realize this, because they're trained in this, the general public may not.
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:28.280]  But this is something really a five-year-old should be able to figure out.
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:34.280]  250,000 miles of rail, close to 3 million miles of paved roads.
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:45.280]  If there was 100 Al Qaeda in America with plastic explosives or weapons, how do you stop them from driving a truck up beside an Amtrak on the hundreds of thousands of miles of track and blowing it up?
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:47.280]  The answer is you don't.
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:53.280]  How do you stop Al Qaeda from walking into a rural McDonald's and shooting people?
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:54.280]  You don't.
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:56.280]  You can only control your borders.
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:01.280]  And in every case, the underwear bomber on record, the government helped get him on the plane.
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:05.280]  We told you that a month and a half before it was in the news with eyewitnesses on board the aircraft.
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:08.280]  We got Kurt Haskell on.
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:11.280]  Turned out it was all true.
[02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:15.280]  I mean, we're supposed to forget this.
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:19.280]  I meant to ask Ventura about the articles about Al Qaeda being the core of the resistance against Qaddafi funded by our government.
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:21.280]  Al Qaeda funded against the Serbs by our government.
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:23.280]  Al Qaeda funded against the Russians.
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:24.280]  It never ends.
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:30.280]  These people were made by the crooks that run America.
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:37.280]  I had Steve Pachenick on last week who was involved in creating Al Qaeda and Taliban on record.
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:42.280]  Dr. Pachenick about Israel being involved with bin Laden.
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:43.280]  Saudi Arabians.
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:46.280]  I mean, it's time to grow up.
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:48.280]  They use this group to menace us.
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:53.280]  They use Al Qaeda commanders to find brainwashed Muslim extremists who will attack us.
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:59.280]  And the Patsy's believe they're doing it for Allah.
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:02.280]  So there are some real events happening.
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:05.280]  But I got a better chance of dying from a bolt of lightning.
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:09.280]  I got a better chance and I don't care if it was the number one cause of death.
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:19.280]  You don't take my rights away and make me a slave with German shepherds and checkpoints and people molesting folks' children in the name of security.
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.280]  It has nothing to do with it.
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:25.280]  We've gotten the internal Homeland Security reports.
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:26.280]  Scores of them.
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:27.280]  State reports.
[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:29.280]  Federally prepared reports.
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:31.280]  It's all about the American people.
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:33.280]  They got Homeland Security watching around.
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:35.280]  All events.
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:37.280]  Don't let that intimidate you, folks.
[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:39.280]  They leak that stuff to intimidate you.
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:40.280]  I'm not the criminal.
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:42.280]  I'm not the terrorist.
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:45.280]  So I say to the police, come on now.
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:49.280]  First, the airports now, the train stations, the bus stations, the highways.
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:55.280]  And months ago, they were running checkpoints in Miami sticking hands down pants.
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:57.280]  In Dallas, in Tennessee.
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:59.280]  I mean, they pull you over now.
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:02.280]  And they're going to, it's all about you will submit to my will.
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:09.280]  They're serving out the shotgun blast delivered high powered tasers that they say delivers a lot more electricity.
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:12.280]  The regular tasers are killing people left and right.
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:20.280]  I mean, I saw footage last week up in Illinois, just college students out.
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:25.280]  And they had the police and sound cannons attack them out of the blue.
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:31.280]  It's any excuse to attack us to set the precedent because the police and the military like it or not now,
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:35.280]  you work for the big foreign banks that have taken America down, stole us blind.
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:38.280]  And the globalists want to break our will and bring us into tyranny now.
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:40.280]  You better grow up and realize that.
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:41.280]  I want to hear from military.
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:49.280]  I mean, do you understand that this configuration of random TSA checkpoints and highway checkpoints and buses and all this,
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:55.280]  when the supposed al-Qaeda stuff and the bin Laden cash says that al-Qaeda wants to break rail lines.
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:13:01.280]  How does searching everyone getting on a train protect you from someone attacking a rail line?
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:02.280]  It doesn't.
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:06.280]  And there's no way to defend rail lines.
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:10.280]  There's no way to defend rail lines.
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:13.280]  Do you understand that?
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:14.280]  There's no way.
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:15.280]  Plus, it's a fake threat.
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:22.280]  Meanwhile, 30,000 plus deaths in the last three years, two and a half years on the US-Mexico border.
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:28.280]  Every week, they're finding mass graves in Arizona and Texas with hundreds of dead bodies, dead children.
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:38.280]  I mean, they take whole families that try to sneak across and don't pay the Mexican coyotes the money and they blow children's heads off.
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:40.280]  Do you hear big news freakouts?
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:41.280]  Do you hear everybody hyper?
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:42.280]  No, no.
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:47.280]  The kidnappings exploding from Austin, Texas to Tucson, Arizona, you hear nothing.
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:55.280]  And then I have this report out of Reuters today.
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:14:04.280]  Liberals in southern Arizona seek to form new state, which is this pro-Mexico open border operation, which is what the globalists have planned all along.
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:09.280]  And they're moving forward to get the signatures to go to the legislature and break the state up.
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:12.280]  You know under the Constitution states have that much power.
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:20.280]  The people have the power to create new unions, new systems, but when we want to get our republic back and restore the republic, ooh, it's secession.
[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:27.280]  It's dirty, it's evil to get the states back to go take the federal government over as they're designed to do to kick the globalist out.
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:30.280]  Oh, that's terrorism, that's secession.
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:39.280]  But when the pro-Mexico, pro-narco-terrorist 87 miles into the US, federal signs saying Americans don't go into this area, 87 miles of it,
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:44.280]  Tucson running the whole operation traitorously.
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:52.280]  Reuters reporting they want to secede and basically join an enclave just like South Ossetia and Georgia joined Russia.
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:55.280]  I mean, that is just incredible.
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:58.280]  And it's not a bang, but a whimper.
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:02.280]  Oh yeah, half of Arizona is about to basically secede to Mexico.
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:05.280]  And it's just, oh, that's cute and sweet.
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:16.280]  And Obama is in Texas today about to travel to Austin and shut down all the highways as usual for his lordship to raise millions of dollars here.
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:20.280]  And he's down there courting the illegal alien vote.
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:23.280]  Obama courts Latino voters with immigration speech.
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:30.280]  So there's a whole failed state, collapsed war going on, total bedlam in Mexico, and that's not a threat.
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:31.280]  No.
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:32.280]  No.
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:38.280]  We've got to protect hundreds of thousands of miles of rail line, upwards of 3 million miles of paved roads.
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:42.280]  I mean, just magically and see, oh, Al-Qaeda is going to hit the train stations.
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:44.280]  Now it's down the road they're going to hit.
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:46.280]  Now it's the whole city is under martial law.
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:48.280]  Oh, you don't have your rights.
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:49.280]  Don't like the naked body scanner?
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:50.280]  We'll grope you.
[02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:55.280]  Now all will be body scanned and then all will be groped.
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:57.280]  TSA always says don't like being groped.
[02:15:57.280 --> 02:15:58.280]  Body scan.
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:15:59.280]  I've been there.
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:01.280]  I've watched it in San Jose and other places.
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:05.280]  They run women and children through to train them to break their will.
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:09.280]  And then they take them out and then they grope them after the body scan.
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:12.280]  And here's the news.
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:14.280]  Here we are, April 21st.
[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:15.280]  Are you scared yet?
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:17.280]  Big sister beam terror warnings to your iPhone.
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:19.280]  Prisonplanet.com.
[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:22.280]  Here's February 8th, info wars.com.
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:29.280]  Obama launches total media takeover system of the entire infrastructure wired in with hard break-ins
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:37.280]  so that the government can take over cell phones, computers, AM, FM, UHF, VHF, cable, everything.
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:42.280]  Here's my February 8th video, 13 minutes long.
[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:46.280]  Obama launches total takeover of media emergency alert system.
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:49.280]  Now, I told you this months ago.
[02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:52.280]  Here it is, beta tested.
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:57.280]  National emergency alert system set to launch in New York City as a beta test.
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:00.280]  The grid is already built into all the phones.
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:04.280]  Senator Franken wants to investigate while all the phone companies are spying on your location and listening to you
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:06.280]  because it's federal regulations.
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:07.280]  And he knows that.
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:11.280]  He's there to give government cover so folks don't know what's happening.
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:13.280]  Franken takes on smartphone apps.
[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:18.280]  Oh, give me a sickening break.
[02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:20.280]  So it's now being announced.
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:21.280]  Here's our article from April 21st.
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:25.280]  DHS launches new alert system designed to terrorize the public.
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:29.280]  Now it's going to be individual alerts with your name on it to freak you out worse.
[02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:33.280]  They've already got control freak cowards seeing a box in Dallas.
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:35.280]  Total shutdown, hysteria, fear.
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.280]  The cops are like, that's good.
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:38.280]  Learn to love us.
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:39.280]  We're the mafia.
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:40.280]  Do whatever we say.
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:42.280]  Box falls off a truck in Austin.
[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:44.280]  Million dollar robots, highways shut down.
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:45.280]  Total fear.
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:48.280]  The cops blow the box up to create a subconscious illusion.
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:49.280]  It was a real bomb.
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:54.280]  They have unannounced drills at schools saying homeschoolers have attacked, gun owners have attacked,
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:55.280]  anti-immigrants have attacked.
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:18:00.280]  The parents don't get mad at the government doing unannounced brainwashing, terrorizing drills.
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:03.280]  They get mad that we have to do this because of the gun owners.
[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:08.280]  It's all completely transparent.
[02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:12.280]  Meanwhile, don't videotape them groping a baby or groping your own daughter.
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:13.280]  They'll arrest you.
[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:16.280]  Well, good arrest everybody, you crooks.
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:19.280]  Or detained at videotaping, DIA security checkpoint.
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:22.280]  Oh, as if terrorists don't know what a checkpoint is.
[02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:24.280]  It's all baloney.
[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:29.280]  The terrorists like Mutalib get led on the plane in Amsterdam.
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:33.280]  For two years, they knew what Major Hassan was planning and communication with Amaral
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:38.280]  Alaki, the admitted CIA operative, and they blocked anybody from stopping him.
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:39.280]  Same with 9-11.
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:43.280]  They run the terrorist because they want to set up a police state grid to rob you.
[02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:45.280]  I want everybody to get this straight.
[02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:50.280]  You think you're a good old boy, and just because you put a, you know, a hunting season
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:53.280]  is open for terrorists in the back of your car.
[02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:55.280]  Really, those terrorists are U.S. government agents.
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:56.280]  You better not mess with them.
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:58.280]  You try to actually go after real terrorists.
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:18:59.280]  See what happens to you.
[02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:02.280]  FBI will lock you up so fast it'll make your head spin.
[02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:06.280]  FBI agents have tried to stop the hijackers, lost their jobs, or demoted.
[02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:12.280]  You don't touch Al-Qaeda, the pride of the New World Order attacking Qaddafi right now.
[02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:14.280]  You don't touch their men.
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:16.280]  You don't touch their secret army.
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:23.280]  You don't touch the knife they use to slit America's throat to take our liberties and
[02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:25.280]  our freedoms and set up a total control grid.
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:33.280]  Now, getting to the biggest news, Chuck E. Schumer comes out with his no-fly-no-by list.
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:38.280]  Comes out with his no-fly-no-by list where you can't get your gun.
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:39.280]  Remember?
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:40.280]  A manual wanted that.
[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:41.280]  Well, now it's back.
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:45.280]  No drive, no buy, no work, no travel.
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:50.280]  A national database where you got to swipe your card and have permission.
[02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:54.280]  And they can turn that card off and you don't just not get food.
[02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:56.280]  You don't have a job.
[02:19:56.280 --> 02:19:59.280]  Then you go live in the ghetto and then they come and round you up.
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:01.280]  It's Nazi Germany, aka Chuck E. Schumer.
[02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:03.280]  Never buy home canning jar lids again.

[02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:02.280]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:08.280]  The earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared
[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:13.280]  to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States
[02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:18.280]  and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued US dollar.
[02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:21.280]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation,
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:25.280]  our friends at the National Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter
[02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:29.280]  that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the US economy and inflation.

[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:32.280]  And folks are like, I better do what they say or I won't be able to travel or have a job.
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:35.280]  Well, that's total tyranny. These people are crooks.
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:41.280]  When we come back from break, military police and others, Jeff, Matt, Scott, Chris, Randy, we're going to get to you.
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:49.280]  But here's the issue. This whole architecture of homeland security is designed on the surface for the American people.
[02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:54.280]  Checkpoints at trains and highways is not to get terrorist folks. It's for the American people.
[02:24:54.280 --> 02:25:00.280]  Sticking their hands down one-year-old babies' diapers and checking for poop bombs, as we saw yesterday,
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:04.280]  is about training the parents that they're criminals and to have their space violated.
[02:25:04.280 --> 02:25:09.280]  We're all getting our prisoner training. And it's all being done so the globalist can steal everything.
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:12.280]  See, a lot of folks are like, well, I don't mind tyranny. Oh, really?
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:16.280]  Do you know with tyranny comes being poor, having no rights?
[02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:20.280]  So are our police and military and bureaucrats going to go along with this?
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:24.280]  Are they going to speak out? Is it such a peer pressure culture? We'll find out.
[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:29.280]  Now, getting more into this, here are 10 facts that prove bin Laden fabled as a contrived hoax.
[02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:35.280]  Paul Joseph Watson, merely a week after President Obama announced the death of some of bin Laden.
[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:40.280]  There is literally a deluge of evidence that clearly indicates the whole episode has been manufactured
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:46.280]  for political gain and to return Americans to a state of post-911 intellectual castration
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:50.280]  so that they can be easily manipulated in the run-up to the 2012 election.
[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:54.280]  Here are 10 facts that prove the bin Laden fabled as a contrived hoax.
[02:25:54.280 --> 02:26:00.280]  Before last Sunday's raid, every intelligence analyst, geopolitical commentator or head of state
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:04.280]  worth their salt was on record, stating that someone bin Laden was already dead
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:09.280]  and that they probably died many years ago from veteran CIA officer Robert Baer
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:14.280]  and former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. She was current when they killed her.
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:17.280]  The former FBI head of counterterrorism, Dale Watson.
[02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:28.280]  In addition, back in 2002, Alex was told directly by two separate high-level sources in the Bush administration.
[02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:30.280]  Let me find the spot I was.
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:33.280]  By two separate high-level sources that bin Laden was already dead
[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:38.280]  and that his death would be announced at the most politically opportune moment
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:41.280]  to stop U.S. government insider Dr. Steve R. Pachennick,
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:45.280]  a man who held numerous different influential positions under five different presidents
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:51.280]  serving as deputy assistant secretary under the Nixon, Fort and Carter told the Alex Jones show last week
[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:56.280]  that bin Laden died of Marfan syndrome shortly after he was visited by CIA physicians
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:27:00.280]  at the American Hospital in Dubai in July of 01.
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:03.280]  And his family was told you'll get billions more in contracts
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:07.280]  exclusively to build U.S. bases in the Middle East, which they got.
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:10.280]  Good helpers, let us do this and say you're the guy that did it.
[02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:13.280]  You'll be seen as a hero in the Middle East hated America.
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:15.280]  And he said, absolutely, I salute you.
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:17.280]  And he died and they said, well done.
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:19.280]  And the rest is history.
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:22.280]  Did they bring his frozen body in and shoot some holes in it and have the seals take it out?
[02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:23.280]  Who knows?
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:28.280]  Number two, the official narrative of how the raid unfolded completely collapsed within days of its announcement.
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:31.280]  First, there had to be a 40-minute shootout. Then there was no shootout.
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:35.280]  Just one man was armed. Just bin Laden was armed. Then he was not.
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:39.280]  First, bin Laden used his wife as a human shield and then did not.
[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:43.280]  First, the compound was described as a $1 million mansion.
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:48.280]  Then it turned out to be a rubbish, strewn, dilapidated compound that was worse less than a quarter of that.
[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:53.280]  Almost every single aspect of the official narrative has changed
[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:58.280]  since Obama first described the raid last Sunday as the White House struggles to keep its story straight.
[02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:04.280]  Three, the alleged body of bin Laden was hastily dumped in the sea to prevent any proper procedure
[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:06.280]  for identification.
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:10.280]  The White House claimed that this was in accordance with his normal Islamic burial rituals,
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:14.280]  however, numerous Muslim scholars over the globe disputed the claim,
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:17.280]  pointing out that Muslims can only be buried at sea if they die at sea.
[02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:20.280]  While the White House claimed that bin Laden's death was May 1st,
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:25.280]  was proven DNA and facial recognition, just like WMD documents,
[02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:28.280]  such proof was never released for public scrutiny
[02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:32.280]  after the Obama administration refused to release photos of bin Laden's dead body
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:34.280]  suggesting a cover-up.
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:38.280]  They just say, I got these emails going, well, they have DNA and body scan.
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:43.280]  Well, they could tell me they have that for Santa Claus.
[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:48.280]  I mean, this is a group of known criminal drug narcotics trafficking,
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:52.280]  Dinecore, Halliburton, U.S. government, U.N. child kidnapping ring people.
[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:55.280]  Don't believe me, just search U.N. child kidnapping.
[02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:58.280]  I mean, it's a murdering group of total scumbags.
[02:28:58.280 --> 02:29:01.280]  The average beat cops out there writing tickets has no idea what's going on.
[02:29:01.280 --> 02:29:03.280]  The average military person doesn't.
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:06.280]  You better grow up and look into who you're working for.
[02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:08.280]  We don't have much more time.
[02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:12.280]  I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:16.280]  Despite the fact, number four, the White House released situation-room photos
[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:19.280]  which reported to show Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden,
[02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:21.280]  the rest of the Obama security staff of criminals, excuse me,
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:23.280]  watching the raid which killed bin Laden live.
[02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:28.280]  It was later admitted to CIA director Leon Panetta that Obama did not have the raid
[02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:31.280]  because the live feed was cut before the seals entered the compound.
[02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:33.280]  Yeah, because they didn't want the Easter Bunny being on video.
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:36.280]  Then it goes on to that whole defining moment they put out and said it was him watching.
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:38.280]  It was fake. Of course, it was a staged photo.
[02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:41.280]  Any idiot can look at it and tell it was staged.
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:44.280]  You can look at a photo and you can tell if something's acting or real.
[02:29:44.280 --> 02:29:45.280]  I mean, you can see it.
[02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:47.280]  There are a bunch of actors, a bunch of scum,
[02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:50.280]  a bunch of narcotics trafficking films.
[02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:52.280]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.280 --> 02:29:54.280]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.280 --> 02:29:58.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:29.280]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes in your door,
[02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:33.280]  you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:36.280]  You need a five-day extreme emergency kit.
[02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:40.280]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days,
[02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:48.280]  this powerful $300 extreme emergency kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.

[02:30:54.280 --> 02:31:00.280]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[02:31:00.280 --> 02:31:04.280]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011,
[02:31:04.280 --> 02:31:08.280]  we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:08.280 --> 02:31:11.280]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.280 --> 02:31:13.280]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children,
[02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:16.280]  and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:16.280 --> 02:31:19.280]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:19.280 --> 02:31:22.280]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.280 --> 02:31:25.280]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac,
[02:31:25.280 --> 02:31:28.280]  and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.280 --> 02:31:31.280]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:31.280 --> 02:31:34.280]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free,
[02:31:34.280 --> 02:31:37.280]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,
[02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:39.280]  and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:40.280]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.280 --> 02:31:43.280]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:45.280]  He explains everything you need to know,
[02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:47.280]  and there are simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:51.280]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:54.280]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:32:58.280 --> 02:33:07.280]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility
[02:33:07.280 --> 02:33:12.280]  against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:33:12.280 --> 02:33:14.280]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:33:14.280 --> 02:33:19.280]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:24.280]  I mean, it's time for people to grow up and think about all the lies we've been told.
[02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:26.280]  Governments all over the world, including ours,
[02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:29.280]  killing our troops in tests,
[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:32.280]  killing foster children, shooting people up all over the world
[02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:35.280]  with all these different diseases, polio, syphilis,
[02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:37.280]  and it's like, but let's trust them.
[02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:38.280]  They're nice.
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:42.280]  CIA aircraft crashing full of pure cocaine.
[02:33:42.280 --> 02:33:44.280]  Local cops bust them in Florida.
[02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:46.280]  They flash CIA badges.
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:47.280]  The cops go ahead and arrest them.
[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:48.280]  That was in Esquire a decade ago.
[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:49.280]  They're released.
[02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:52.280]  Government shipping narcotics across the Texas border.
[02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:54.280]  I mean, I'm just tired of it.
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:56.280]  Now I've got to have checkpoints.
[02:33:56.280 --> 02:33:59.280]  They want to take my blood and stick their hands down my pants
[02:33:59.280 --> 02:34:00.280]  and ask me about narcotics.
[02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:02.280]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:08.280]  Drug ads pushing the molecular almost identical drugs as a prescription at everybody.
[02:34:08.280 --> 02:34:09.280]  Come on in.
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:10.280]  Just come on in.
[02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:11.280]  It's all right.
[02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:12.280]  Just come on in.
[02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:14.280]  I mean, we've got all this stuff going on.
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:15.280]  Thank you.
[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:16.280]  We've got all this stuff happening.
[02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:19.280]  We've got all this stuff unfolding.
[02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:22.280]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[02:34:22.280 --> 02:34:28.280]  And this servile, domesticated, cowardly population being scared by this sock puppet
[02:34:28.280 --> 02:34:30.280]  that has a beard and a turban on it.
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:31.280]  Give me your rights.
[02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:32.280]  Give me your bank account.
[02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:33.280]  Give me all your data.
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:36.280]  I'm going to spy on you without warrants to keep you safe from her.
[02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:39.280]  I mean, it's elementary.
[02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:41.280]  Now, internal checkpoints.
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:43.280]  I want to go to all these calls.
[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:48.280]  Number five, even mainstream journalists began to cast suspicion on the official narrative
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:52.280]  behind the raid when the media reported that Al-Qaeda itself had confirmed every detail
[02:34:52.280 --> 02:34:54.280]  of Obama's address to the nation.
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:59.280]  However, the conduit of such a claim was, in fact, the organization called Sight, which
[02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:04.280]  is a notorious Pentagon propaganda front run by the daughter of an former Israeli spy
[02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:09.280]  that has been caught on numerous occasions releasing fake cartoonish Al-Qaeda videos.
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:10.280]  And we have links to that.
[02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:14.280]  And how the U.S. government funds it and how they released videos from years ago and said
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:15.280]  they were new.
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:17.280]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:20.280]  They hate you.
[02:35:20.280 --> 02:35:22.280]  And they go, wow, we get caught dealing drugs and don't get in trouble.
[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:25.280]  We'll just, wow, we're running giant child kidnapping rings.
[02:35:25.280 --> 02:35:26.280]  Why not do more?
[02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:28.280]  At least people let us do anything.
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:32.280]  And the most sickening murdering criminals get into government now and corporations
[02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:33.280]  and recruit more criminals.
[02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:36.280]  And they're just like, my gosh, we stole $27 trillion.
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:37.280]  We can do whatever we want.
[02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:39.280]  Let's steal the military's death benefits.
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:40.280]  Let's take the pension funds.
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:41.280]  Let's do everything.
[02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:43.280]  We'll say it's to stop Al-Qaeda.
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:46.280]  Let's take over the web and everybody's cell phone with government propaganda.
[02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:49.280]  Let's put telescreens up saying, don't trust your neighbors.
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:50.280]  Yes, it's wonderful.
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:52.280]  Let's put fluoride in their water.
[02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:55.280]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:56.280]  I'm sorry.
[02:35:56.280 --> 02:35:57.280]  I'm ranting now.
[02:35:57.280 --> 02:36:01.280]  Almost every single neighbor that lived in the area, and it goes on, said that no one
[02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:02.280]  lived there.
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:04.280]  The CIA was next door.
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:06.280]  The bin Laden didn't live there.
[02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:08.280]  Now it turns out the CIA was next door.
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:11.280]  Number seven, the videos released by the White House past week were reported to show
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:16.280]  the summer bin Laden making Al-Qaeda tapes in October of 2010.
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:17.280]  Almost identical.
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:19.280]  They just changed a little bit of the color in the background.
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:26.280]  The footage first released by Pentagon Front Group called Sight nearly four years ago.
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:31.280]  Remember the May 2010 Washington Post story about the CIA admitting fake bin Laden videos
[02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:32.280]  on and on and on.
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:35.280]  They admit they make fake ones, but we've got to believe them.
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:37.280]  We make fake videos, but believe these.
[02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:39.280]  Those others were fake, but these are real.
[02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:41.280]  You put a different color background.
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:42.280]  It's the same guy.
[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:44.280]  The lips move at the same time.
[02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:46.280]  Give us the audio because it's the same video.
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:48.280]  Oh, we're not releasing the audio.
[02:36:48.280 --> 02:36:49.280]  Shut up.
[02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:51.280]  We're too lazy to even make new fake ones.
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:56.280]  And it's clearly a computer-generated character like Mario Kart-level graphics.
[02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:58.280]  I mean, it's a fake robot.
[02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:03.280]  And they released other videos that were old, re-edited ones from 99, 2000.
[02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:05.280]  That was all admitted.
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:10.280]  They released a video of Mohammed Atta and the other main hijacker at the training base
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:15.280]  with bin Laden five years ago, and then a year later admitted it was fake from a made-for-TV movie
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:17.280]  that aired on British TV two years before.
[02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:22.280]  They're like, hey, we have this good computer graphic we did of the simulating the two-lead hijackers
[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:24.280]  meeting with bin Laden.
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:26.280]  Let's just use it to say it's real.
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:28.280]  Yeah, the scum won't notice.
[02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:30.280]  We kidnapped their kids and shipped narcotics in.
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:34.280]  They're a bunch of domesticated cowards who were totally gullible and will buy anything.
[02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:38.280]  Let's just do it.
[02:37:38.280 --> 02:37:42.280]  Despite the fact that numerous neocons came out on days after the alleged raid
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:46.280]  to erroneously assert the torturing terrorist suspects at Guantanamo Bay
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:48.280]  let a discovery have been lied in himself,
[02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:52.280]  the supposed world's most wanted terrorist and treasure trove of terror information
[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:55.280]  despite the fact that he was unarmed, was not taken in for questioning,
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:59.280]  he was instantly shot in the head according to the official narrative.
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:02.280]  Number nine, U.S. government has been caught on several occasions in the past decade
[02:38:02.280 --> 02:38:06.280]  staging military operations for the purpose of generating contrived pro-war sentiment
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:08.280]  amongst the American public.
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:12.280]  Jessica Lynch, Pat Tillman, fake WMDs, I could go on.
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:16.280]  Number 10, despite the fact that Obama announced last Sunday on live television
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:19.280]  that the world is now safer because bin Laden is dead,
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:23.280]  his administration with the aid of the fearmonger mass media
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:27.280]  instantly seized upon the situation to terrify Americans into being afraid
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:31.280]  of imminent reprisal terror attacks inside the United States.
[02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:36.280]  So-called no-fly list to be expanded to trains and subways.
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:39.280]  Obama went to the Ground Zero photo op.
[02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:42.280]  They rolled out the new terror listing two weeks before.
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:43.280]  It's all scripted.
[02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:46.280]  All right, I said I'd take your calls and I want to hear from police and military.
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:48.280]  Do you buy any of this?
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:49.280]  And do you buy?
[02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:53.280]  We've got to have random TSA train people now everywhere.
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:56.280]  That'll keep us safe from terrorists, but the borders are wide open.
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:01.280]  And now the LaRica Conquistas are trying to break Arizona in two
[02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:04.280]  and merge with Mexico, and it's a minor footnote in Reuters.
[02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:06.280]  I mean, do you get it?
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:08.280]  Traders took over America.
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:11.280]  Red Alert, we're going down.
[02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:14.280]  And the government's staging events so they can sick you
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:17.280]  on people inside the country who aren't traders.
[02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:18.280]  Understand?
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:19.280]  Comprende?
[02:39:19.280 --> 02:39:20.280]  Got that?
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:21.280]  Get it?
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:22.280]  Understand it?
[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:23.280]  Good.
[02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:24.280]  Jeff in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:25.280]  I'm sorry I'm ranting.
[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:26.280]  No problem, Alex.
[02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:29.280]  It's an honor to talk to you, and I've got to apologize in advance.
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:32.280]  I am at work, so if I get a call, I'm going to have to go.
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:33.280]  That's fine.
[02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:34.280]  Go ahead, sirs.
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:35.280]  All right.
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:38.280]  I just wanted to say that I pretty much, I don't buy words that they say,
[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:41.280]  and I think it's pretty much straight out of 1984,
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:44.280]  they're going to be able to take over our phone, media,
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:47.280]  and send us direct messages.
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:50.280]  It is directly out of 1984.
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:53.280]  If you're a police officer in the military, let us know.
[02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:54.280]  What are your colleagues saying?
[02:39:54.280 --> 02:39:57.280]  I mean, are they starting to get freaked out by this?
[02:39:57.280 --> 02:40:00.280]  I spread the word as much as I can,
[02:40:00.280 --> 02:40:03.280]  and there seems to be some of them that are loosely aware of it,
[02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:06.280]  and it's still okay.
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:09.280]  Well, Jeff, do you realize, because your phone's cutting out,
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:12.280]  do you realize that they're going to slowly try to federalize you
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:16.280]  and use you against the general public, not criminals?
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:19.280]  Yes, sir, and at that point, I will no longer serve.
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:22.280]  Right now, I'm just in to try and wake up as many people as I can
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:25.280]  and protect as many people's rights as I possibly can.
[02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:28.280]  Are you in the military or a police officer?
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:31.280]  I'm a police officer at the airport in Texas.
[02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:34.280]  What do you think of Texas moving to make it the law,
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:38.280]  which it already is, but specifically that if TSA sticks their hand
[02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:41.280]  on your genitals, it's a felony?
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:43.280]  I'm excited. I can't wait to enforce it,
[02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:48.280]  because I'm sick of having to stand by and watch it.
[02:40:48.280 --> 02:40:51.280]  I know a lot of TSA folks write me and talk to me in person
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:54.280]  when I see them, and they say they don't like what's happening.
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:56.280]  The other TSA people that you talked to,
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:41:00.280]  are you getting the same thing that they don't like what they're being told to do?
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:04.280]  Yeah, I mean, it seems like there's two pretty distinct groups.
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:08.280]  One that's completely oblivious and have no idea what they're doing,
[02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:10.280]  kind of. I mean, they seem like good-faring people,
[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:14.280]  and then there's others that just seem like, just like employees.
[02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:17.280]  They enjoy the authority and like to use it.
[02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:19.280]  Well, Jeff, let me ask you this question.
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:22.280]  See, I like to use authority on bullies, on scum, on criminals,
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:25.280]  not on little old ladies or one-year-old babies.
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:28.280]  I have an instinct to want to protect them, and I know real warriors
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:30.280]  in the real warrior class, that's what you want.
[02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:33.280]  This is the parasite class they're trying to convert you to,
[02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:34.280]  and thank God you're fighting it.
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:38.280]  What about now expanding airport security randomly to malls,
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:42.280]  shopping centers, grocery stores, highways, train stations,
[02:41:42.280 --> 02:41:44.280]  which they're now announcing they're doing?
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:48.280]  I mean, even if terrorists were real, just randomly doing this
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:50.280]  complete joke, it's only designed for the public.
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:52.280]  Do you agree or disagree?
[02:41:52.280 --> 02:41:53.280]  I completely agree.
[02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:55.280]  I mean, how many people have actually been caught
[02:41:55.280 --> 02:41:57.280]  by these random screenings and searches?
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:41:59.280]  I mean, they're completely unconstitutional.
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:01.280]  They're unbacked by anything.
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:03.280]  I mean, the Constitution says it has to be issued
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:06.280]  based upon probable cause, and there's certainly no probable cause
[02:42:06.280 --> 02:42:07.280]  when it comes to that.
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:12.280]  And as far as, I mean, even if these random screenings are out there,
[02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:13.280]  what are the odds?
[02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:15.280]  I mean, if every day you go out and you get in your car,
[02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:17.280]  you're taking a big risk that you're going to get in a wreck and die.
[02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:19.280]  I mean, that's a lot of life.
[02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:20.280]  Exactly.
[02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:21.280]  Jeff, God bless you.
[02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:23.280]  We appreciate your service to the country and the republic
[02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:24.280]  and this great state of Texas.
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:26.280]  Look, I'm going to try to break this down briefly
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:29.280]  and then go to Matt, Scott, Chris, and Randy right now here
[02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:31.280]  in about 60 seconds.
[02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:33.280]  They're telling us torture is good.
[02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:35.280]  If they can get us to say torture is good,
[02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:36.280]  they can do anything.
[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:38.280]  That's so immoral, so evil.
[02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:40.280]  It's only good for fake confessions.
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:43.280]  It's right out of every nightmare state in history.
[02:42:43.280 --> 02:42:45.280]  And they're flying their flag of evil,
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:46.280]  trying to get us to accept the evil.
[02:42:46.280 --> 02:42:48.280]  You do that, it's over.
[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:51.280]  And then all the other checks and balances that make us secure,
[02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:53.280]  that make us safe, that make us happy,
[02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:56.280]  that create the engine of liberty, they're gone.
[02:42:56.280 --> 02:42:58.280]  Folks, if they can torture, they can take your bank account.
[02:42:58.280 --> 02:43:01.280]  If they can torture, they can lock you up and throw the key away.
[02:43:01.280 --> 02:43:04.280]  If they can, it's the same thing with hands down the pants.
[02:43:04.280 --> 02:43:06.280]  It's the same thing with just five years ago,
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:08.280]  Bush denied they had warrantless wire caps.
[02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:09.280]  Now the government just says,
[02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:11.280]  we listen to everything without warrants.
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:13.280]  We watch kids at home all over their laptops.
[02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:17.280]  See, they're just doing it and then not getting in trouble
[02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:19.280]  and saying we can do whatever we want.
[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:23.280]  And they're setting the precedent to hurt us all, to rob us.
[02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:25.280]  That's their criminal instinct.
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:28.280]  They organize crime that gets control of government,
[02:43:28.280 --> 02:43:30.280]  is called tyranny.
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:33.280]  And it killed over 200, I just got chills again.
[02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:36.280]  We're getting so close folks, we're so deep into this.
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:39.280]  It killed over 200 million people last century, okay?
[02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:41.280]  And they're warming up to trump that.
[02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:43.280]  I'm telling folks, I'm telling you,
[02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:46.280]  Matt in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:43:46.280 --> 02:43:47.280]  Welcome.
[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:49.280]  Alex, thank you.
[02:43:49.280 --> 02:43:53.280]  I'm going back to 2001, you say that you have sources
[02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:57.280]  that Osama bin Laden died before September 11th.
[02:43:57.280 --> 02:43:58.280]  Yes.
[02:43:58.280 --> 02:43:59.280]  Is that correct?
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:00.280]  Yes.
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:01.280]  Okay.
[02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:02.280]  And then September 11th happened,
[02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:06.280]  boosted the approval rating for George Bush,
[02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:09.280]  gets reelected, goes to war, Iraq.
[02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:12.280]  Now Obama, before he comes in, he's a great speaker.
[02:44:12.280 --> 02:44:15.280]  He can give it a lie, whatever the public believes in.
[02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:16.280]  He gets elected.
[02:44:16.280 --> 02:44:19.280]  Now he didn't do anything until up to this date.
[02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:22.280]  And they bring this in right before his supposedly billion
[02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:24.280]  dollar election coming up.
[02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:28.280]  And he just does one thing and now his approval rating is going
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:30.280]  to go up and people are going to be like, oh, Obama,
[02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:31.280]  well, now he's good.
[02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:33.280]  And I mean, this is just complete crap.
[02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:35.280]  I don't, I don't really...
[02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:38.280]  Sir, are you a police officer or are you in the military?
[02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:39.280]  No, sir.
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:40.280]  I'm not either.
[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:41.280]  I just...
[02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:42.280]  Okay, because that's the calls we're taking.
[02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:43.280]  No, no, no, no.
[02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:44.280]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:44:44.280 --> 02:44:45.280]  We're going to let you go.
[02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:47.280]  We're only taking calls for police and military because I want
[02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:50.780]  to hear their perspective, but it is a good question.
[02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:53.340]  They roll out the new alert.
[02:44:53.340 --> 02:44:57.280]  They roll out the cell phone takeover system quietly right ahead
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:00.360]  of this bin Laden announcement with the new fear to get it in place
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:03.560]  while you're scared.
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:07.360]  The White House advisors, Robert Shapiro and others, put out public
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:10.400]  articles saying, we need an Oklahoma City or 9-11.
[02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:13.680]  We need some event to make people love Obama for the election.
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:17.840]  Now this happens, the equivalent of a psychological attack.
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:20.480]  First you get all happy, oh, we got him?
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:24.480]  And they say, oh, sorry, got to give up more rights now that this happened.
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:25.880]  Let's talk to Scott in Illinois.
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:27.120]  Scott, you're on the air.
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:28.120]  Police or military?
[02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:29.440]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:34.000]  I told the guy answering the phone that it was former Marine from this
[02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:35.000]  avenue.
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:36.000]  Okay.
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:37.000]  What's your view on all this?
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:42.000]  Well, I agree totally with what you're saying and how serious this is.
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:47.120]  Last weekend, at night there in Chicago Ridge, there was five FEMA
[02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:50.840]  Fusion prisoner cars on the train that went by, and I live right next to
[02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:51.840]  the track.
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:56.440]  I believe something's going to happen in Chicago because they have
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:01.440]  this little coward within Napoleon complex as a mayor now, and he has no
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:09.560]  problem creating what do you call it, taking away everybody's rights and
[02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:10.560]  martial law.
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:16.000]  When I was in the Marines in 1975, we were told in Camp Pendleton by our
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:20.880]  instructors that the next war is going to be in Iraq and the desert, not in the
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:21.880]  jungles.
[02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:27.080]  So they've known this for a long time, and something sparked me that Jesse
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:29.320]  Ventura said about some weapon.
[02:46:29.320 --> 02:46:33.600]  I just saw something and everyone needs to go check this out on the YouTube.
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:38.480]  It's look up, harp rains down fire on a ran.
[02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:42.280]  If you see this, it should scare you because the harp is going to be used
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:47.880]  for a lot more other things, including in my mind, if you accept that microchip
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:51.160]  and you decide you don't want to go along with what's going on or you speak
[02:46:51.160 --> 02:46:54.800]  out against the furor, you have to watch the end of this video to see what
[02:46:54.800 --> 02:46:55.800]  happened.
[02:46:55.800 --> 02:46:59.960]  There were 150 some dolphins and whales that washed up on the shore that were
[02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:00.960]  cooked.
[02:47:00.960 --> 02:47:01.960]  They weren't just dead.
[02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:02.960]  They were pitch black.
[02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:03.960]  I saw that report.
[02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:04.960]  Absolutely.
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:05.960]  They've got all sorts of super weapons.
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:08.120]  I appreciate your call, Scott.
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:10.400]  Let's talk to Chris in California.
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:11.400]  You're on the air.
[02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:12.400]  Thanks for holding.
[02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:13.400]  Hello, Alex.
[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:16.080]  I served as an enlisted Marine and later as an officer, an aviator in the
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:17.080]  Air Force.
[02:47:17.080 --> 02:47:20.400]  I wanted to hit two issues really quick here.
[02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:25.880]  That survey, the Marine Corps 29 Palm Survey of 1994 by Lieutenant Commander
[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:29.680]  Ernest Guy Cunningham, where they would ask some Marines if they'd turn their,
[02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:32.040]  amongst other questions, they'd basically ask them if they'd turn their guns
[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:34.080]  on the American people.
[02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:37.760]  That survey allegedly came out in 1994.
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:42.720]  Back in 1988, some fellow officers in my squadron, I was walking by one of the
[02:47:42.720 --> 02:47:45.720]  hangars and they knew I was an enlisted Marine.
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:48.320]  They came up and started saying, hey, just hear about that survey that they're
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:51.600]  asking in 29 Palms about turning your guns on the American people.
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:54.600]  I said, you're full of crap and I thought they were just ragging on me for being a
[02:47:54.600 --> 02:47:55.600]  prior Marine.
[02:47:55.600 --> 02:47:59.880]  Well, I started looking it up back in even in the late 80s and I saw that there
[02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:02.680]  was, that they were actually questioning people.
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:07.400]  So this survey was out before this 1990, before this Cunningham allegedly came out
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:10.280]  with it back in 1994.
[02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:16.680]  So recently we went to the Edwards Air Force Base Air Show.
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:22.600]  It was an hour and 45 minute drive through the base to go about a mile and a half.
[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:29.080]  About every 50 yards they had officers, enlisted people, Army, Marine Corps, and
[02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:34.080]  Air Force personnel with submachine guns, MP5s, and car 15s standing there while
[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:35.080]  you're going through.
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:37.480]  I even asked one officer, are you a real officer?
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:41.240]  And he said, he was the first lieutenant, he said, yeah, I go, are you on RTC or anything?
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:43.680]  He goes, yeah, he goes, yeah, I'm a real officer.
[02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:46.960]  I go, what are you directing traffic for?
[02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:52.160]  Because I know, never before did I ever see officers out directing traffic during events
[02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:53.160]  or otherwise.
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:58.000]  Well, I want to be clear with you, I want to be clear with you, that's how this beta
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.160]  testing is working.
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:05.360]  Going back eight, nine years, in rural areas of Alabama and Texas, we have the videos
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:12.840]  and photos, some of it's in police state, a 911 rise of the police state, and it showed
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:17.920]  babies having their bags searched by state guard and national guard.
[02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:23.600]  And now they've had Marines in California, not the border where they're needed, but
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:27.360]  just searching people at highway checkpoints with sidearms.
[02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:34.880]  And I've been in New York, videotape National Guard with 45s on their side across the street,
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:40.760]  it's an in game, and they run screaming and cussing in my face, I'm the enemy, American
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:46.560]  slave with camera, they just run and I just screamed back at the guy and he's like, whoa,
[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:52.400]  the slave isn't backing down, so they flipped out and ran screaming into a van, but I mean
[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:57.560]  these guys could barely even talk, they were just like mindless, all just running around
[02:49:57.560 --> 02:50:03.240]  enjoying themselves with guns on their hips, and it's all just to acclimate you, then the
[02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:10.560]  TSA is to acclimate you to line up, and the Kentucky Derby every year now for nine years,
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:14.920]  they have checkpoints there, they don't use regular security when folks jump on the field
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:19.760]  after the race that was always something that people did as a pastime, now they have armed
[02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:23.880]  military run up with guns, because the image is they could be a terrorist, so everybody
[02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:31.640]  watching at the NFL, the Kentucky Derby, any event, military, military, military, and now
[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:38.280]  they admit the John Warren Defense Authorization Act, they admit in the Ottawa Citizen article
[02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:43.800]  in Canada they've got a deal to use foreign troops, not only will troops be used, foreign
[02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:49.280]  troops officially training, I mean this is total tyranny, and they're trying to get away
[02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:53.000]  with it, and they're gearing up for the big terror attack they're going to launch, next
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:57.560]  week, two years from now, we don't know, when they nuke a city or release a bio weapon,
[02:50:57.560 --> 02:51:00.680]  they're going to pour in foreign troops, they're going to march around lining us up
[02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:01.680]  and killing us.
[02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:05.720]  If you're concerned about radiation poisoning from Japan in the air, water, or food and

[02:52:03.240 --> 02:52:05.640]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[02:52:05.640 --> 02:52:09.880]  The U.S. government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling
[02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:13.520]  large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[02:52:13.520 --> 02:52:18.880]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S. bonds in order to rebuild its own nation and
[02:52:18.880 --> 02:52:23.720]  the U.S. antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve,
[02:52:23.720 --> 02:52:28.280]  which is already buying about 70% of U.S. Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left
[02:52:28.280 --> 02:52:29.640]  of U.S. Treasuries.
[02:52:29.640 --> 02:52:34.080]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S. dollar will soon become
[02:52:34.080 --> 02:52:39.000]  worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:47.560]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[02:52:47.560 --> 02:52:51.400]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda and the mainstream media, sign
[02:52:51.400 --> 02:53:07.440]  up for free at www.inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media
[02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:25.600]  is the only buyer left of U.S. Treasuries.
[02:53:25.600 --> 02:53:55.560]  Remember, Organica Seed is Healthy Seed.
[02:53:55.560 --> 02:54:07.240]  Care your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:07.240 --> 02:54:11.720]  You know, we've been taught we're supposed to be half-hearted and apologize to the government
[02:54:11.720 --> 02:54:13.560]  when we criticize it.
[02:54:13.560 --> 02:54:20.960]  No, the government from the top is run by a bunch of hardcore crooks who competed with
[02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:25.600]  each other to get up there into the positions of power and they're destroying our way of
[02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:26.600]  life.
[02:54:26.600 --> 02:54:31.480]  They're getting rid of that hedge of protection, due process, Constitution Bill of Rights,
[02:54:31.480 --> 02:54:35.920]  Declaration of Independence and trying to forge us into this corrupt empire.
[02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:40.240]  In fact, I've rarely seen empires this evil.
[02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:47.200]  I mean, this is an evil, evil bunch and Obama comes and goes, Bush comes and goes, the evil
[02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:48.200]  just continues.
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:51.880]  We're five minutes into overdrive, so I can guarantee at least get to these four calls,
[02:54:51.880 --> 02:54:58.600]  Randy, Adam, Frank, Kevin, and others, or at least those four.
[02:54:58.600 --> 02:55:03.200]  Let's talk to Kevin, no, Frank, what was the caller from Japan?
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:04.200]  Did they just hang up?
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:08.600]  No, no, there's the caller, Adam in Japan, who's in the military.
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:12.600]  What's your view on, now everywhere has to have TSA train people with hands down the
[02:55:12.600 --> 02:55:14.040]  pants to keep us safe.
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:18.560]  This idea of omnipresent security, it has a name, martial law.
[02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:21.800]  Yes, Alex, I'm very aware of martial law.
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:28.400]  In fact, in my unit, well, I just need to tell you briefly that two weeks ago, I knew
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:34.720]  that something was up because my entire department, we signed release statements stating that we
[02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:42.840]  would not reveal any secret or classified documents from NATO forces, not US forces,
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:43.840]  NATO forces.
[02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:49.040]  We were to come across any classified or secret material.
[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:54.920]  We were to treat it just like we would treat US forces, classified or secret material.
[02:55:54.920 --> 02:55:58.080]  That ring of bell in my head is like, why are we signing this?
[02:55:58.080 --> 02:56:00.680]  Why are we getting this briefing?
[02:56:00.680 --> 02:56:06.280]  And then a few days later, of course, the president comes out with an announcement about
[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:14.480]  Sombit Laden, things are pretty scary.
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:19.800]  Are your colleagues starting to smell something?
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:25.120]  You know, I think they understand that everything that's happened with the past few weeks, it's
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:31.520]  just too much coincidence, you know, and I have been talking to them about everything
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:37.280]  and about all the sigh-out that's been going on and I think some of them are actually starting
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:41.920]  to wake up and they see things, it's just too much of a coincidence.
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:44.200]  Well, here's what you tell them.
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:48.200]  It's now admitted that most of the money in the bailout went to private offshore banks
[02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:51.600]  and that those very groups then paid money to our so-called media.
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:53.560]  That's treason, okay?
[02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:59.120]  The government got bought off, we're being robbed and they better really get it burned
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:01.560]  into their head that traders run the government.
[02:57:01.560 --> 02:57:04.400]  I mean, that's a pretty simple thing to understand, isn't it?
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:06.200]  Yes, it is.
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:08.560]  I understand it very well.
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:12.880]  So obviously, because you've signed those agreements, of course, they have people sign
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:15.880]  agreements that when Dinecore and Halliburton are kidnapped and kids, they can't talk,
[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:19.280]  but those agreements are null and void, they will come put a bullet in your head.
[02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:24.200]  I mean, all the military I know, the family I know, they say, yeah, they're training every
[02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:27.360]  unit of every armed services branch for civil unrest.
[02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:29.600]  I mean, is that what you're talking about?
[02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:36.680]  Well, every training day that we have, we briefly go over martial law and what it is
[02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:43.000]  in the Posse Comitatus Act and we're very familiar with the fact that Posse Comitatus
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:46.480]  is suspended during martial law.
[02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:51.840]  So they explain to you now, Posse Comitatus is suspended during martial law, boys and
[02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:52.840]  girls.
[02:57:52.840 --> 02:57:53.840]  Right.
[02:57:53.840 --> 02:57:59.240]  And so they go, so it's a legal order and then what type of terrorist are you trying
[02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:04.920]  to take on guys with turbines or it's just whoever doesn't lick boots, right?
[02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:10.320]  You know, pretty much the military has a loose definition of what a terrorist is.
[02:58:10.320 --> 02:58:16.960]  It can pretty much be anybody that is making a general threat against a military installation.
[02:58:16.960 --> 02:58:22.880]  Yeah, I know my guys at G20 just tried to talk to the military, went to the public information
[02:58:22.880 --> 02:58:26.480]  officer and then suddenly the police were coming saying, you're trying to blow up the
[02:58:26.480 --> 02:58:27.480]  military.
[02:58:27.480 --> 02:58:28.480]  We're like, we had it all on video.
[02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:31.400]  It's in police state for the rise of FEMA.
[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:32.400]  Anything else?
[02:58:32.400 --> 02:58:36.400]  So what percentage of your comrades aren't buying this bin Laden hoax?
[02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:40.680]  Just off the top of your head.
[02:58:40.680 --> 02:58:43.680]  Stay there.
[02:58:43.680 --> 02:58:47.240]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.240 --> 02:58:52.400]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:52.400 --> 02:58:56.640]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.640 --> 02:58:59.800]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.800 --> 02:59:04.120]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[02:59:04.120 --> 02:59:05.120]  at home.
[02:59:05.120 --> 02:59:09.800]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[02:59:09.800 --> 02:59:10.800]  calling the shots.
[02:59:10.800 --> 02:59:16.160]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:59:16.160 --> 02:59:19.440]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:59:19.440 --> 02:59:25.240]  A criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[02:59:25.240 --> 02:59:26.240]  world government.
[02:59:26.240 --> 02:59:28.640]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[02:59:28.640 --> 02:59:32.760]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.760 --> 02:59:38.680]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[02:59:38.680 --> 02:59:40.000]  of the Republic.

[02:59:55.800 --> 02:59:59.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:59.600 --> 03:00:19.800]  Folks, Karranee's being brought in to destroy our liberties and our freedom and our wealth.
[03:00:19.800 --> 03:00:32.480]  Brown people off against white people, vice versa, these globalists are cold-blooded psychological
[03:00:32.480 --> 03:00:33.480]  warfare masters.
[03:00:33.480 --> 03:00:37.160]  You're out there in Japan with a military doing martial law drills off and on, getting
[03:00:37.160 --> 03:00:39.200]  you ready for that, how great it is.
[03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:46.040]  What percentage of the guys you talk to aren't buying this PR rollout ever-changing story
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:50.920]  of the Bin Laden fable?
[03:00:50.920 --> 03:00:57.560]  I would say about 50% or about half of my department doesn't really believe what the
[03:00:57.560 --> 03:01:02.600]  government is saying about the Bin Laden hoax right now.
[03:01:02.600 --> 03:01:06.600]  They're questioning things and I'm talking to them about it more and more and just bringing
[03:01:06.600 --> 03:01:11.960]  to the forefront all the information that you've been giving out and they're reacting
[03:01:11.960 --> 03:01:16.680]  actually, they're starting to more and more see and then they're starting to question
[03:01:16.680 --> 03:01:20.480]  more and more now about well, if there was a Bin Laden hoax.
[03:01:20.480 --> 03:01:26.360]  They need to know this, when there's a Republican in a few years they may even wait and a mushroom
[03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:30.840]  cloud goes up, let's just say Al Qaeda did it, of course they didn't, but let's just,
[03:01:30.840 --> 03:01:35.080]  for the sake of argument, the point is don't come after my rights when that nuke goes off
[03:01:35.080 --> 03:01:37.720]  and they start arresting media people.
[03:01:37.720 --> 03:01:39.440]  Why is Alex Jones being arrested?
[03:01:39.440 --> 03:01:42.160]  At that point you know it's an inside job, you understand?
[03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:49.160]  At the moment they gun me down out front in my house or whatever they do and Ron Paul,
[03:01:49.160 --> 03:01:56.240]  playing crash, whatever, the minute you see that you guys have to be pre-aware of before
[03:01:56.240 --> 03:02:00.880]  a motion takes control, we're in a race right now and I don't care if they kill me quite
[03:02:00.880 --> 03:02:04.600]  frankly, I love life but I'm committed, I've accepted it because I'm not going to sit here
[03:02:04.600 --> 03:02:05.600]  and live in fear.
[03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:09.240]  I just want to beat them in the end, I'm more than happy to go down with the ship as long
[03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:12.800]  as we end up beating them, as long as I take them down with me, but I mean do you understand,
[03:02:12.800 --> 03:02:17.080]  I don't want my kids to be slaves and let me tell you something, all their pre-programming,
[03:02:17.080 --> 03:02:20.200]  they're planted a nuke in American city, so I'm just telling you people are going to get
[03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:24.240]  real emotional when this happens and I want to be able to count on the military when they
[03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:28.720]  do this and when they go after American freedom and private property and folks, just go why
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:32.840]  are you going after, why are you using this attack to roll out control, because there'll
[03:02:32.840 --> 03:02:36.080]  be no debate they're going to do that, are you guys ready for that?
[03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:44.560]  Alex, I do not believe that anybody in my department will shoot an American and they
[03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:48.720]  will not take orders to shoot Americans on American soil.
[03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:53.480]  All right, well God bless you, I appreciate your call but I'm telling you, they're trial
[03:02:53.480 --> 03:03:00.040]  ballooning right now, shopping mall shootings, Walmart attacks and if you buy that, I'm telling
[03:03:00.040 --> 03:03:03.600]  you they have been, well I've been telling you this for years, now they're saying 160
[03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:08.040]  nukes, KSM have been lied and killed, the nuke's going to go off, I'm telling you Obama
[03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:12.600]  could end up being the dictator, but if we get out ahead of this, they'll kick the can
[03:03:12.600 --> 03:03:17.000]  down the road, because they've already got us, they just really hate us and they want
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:22.320]  our kids for their domestic security force draft, I'm just out of time here, oh man,
[03:03:22.320 --> 03:03:26.320]  I want to get to everybody, I got to do a bunch of work though here today, Randy and
[03:03:26.320 --> 03:03:33.800]  OK, you're on the air, go ahead, I'm glad you got to me, T-Rex, I want to say thank
[03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:39.600]  you, well thank you sir, we got a minute and a half, to you and this audience, so I don't
[03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:43.440]  forget, I may have two challenges for the audience that have to do with when they shut
[03:03:43.440 --> 03:03:50.960]  things down, first of all, I was in the Marine Corps, intelligence, I was a pilot, I was
[03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:56.000]  on Limbaugh's show probably 14 times, he banned me, he wound up banning me because I kept
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:01.320]  bringing up sovereignty to New World Order, I was doing research at the time, 1989 on
[03:04:01.320 --> 03:04:11.160]  the global warming theory, I called my thesis, the environmental strategy to a New World
[03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:16.200]  Order, I had immense amount of volume of material showing the CFRs behind it, they were slanting
[03:04:16.200 --> 03:04:22.480]  everything to do with it, so where we're at now, did you have a question specifically
[03:04:22.480 --> 03:04:23.480]  for me?
[03:04:23.480 --> 03:04:27.600]  Here's the deal, we're going to go into partial overdrive into the next segment, but I got
[03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:31.800]  to finish with you and Frank and Covenant and that's it, but the question specifically
[03:04:31.800 --> 03:04:36.840]  is, this whole hoax, the takedown for military and police, you're saying you're former military
[03:04:36.840 --> 03:04:37.840]  or what are you?
[03:04:37.840 --> 03:04:42.280]  I am, I've got, I mean we've got, people have to learn their rights, so when somebody
[03:04:42.280 --> 03:04:47.160]  comes to say, hey, we're shutting you down or whatever, you're going to suit them personally
[03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:51.160]  and their commanding officer, I've got several more things in relation to that.
[03:04:51.160 --> 03:04:54.880]  Well real fast, we'll get your take and we're going to come back in the next segment and
[03:04:54.880 --> 03:04:58.480]  we won't even do the whole segment, we'll just meet the rest of the retransmission
[03:04:58.480 --> 03:05:01.800]  as it goes, we're going to talk to three more callers, stay there Randy.
[03:05:01.800 --> 03:05:06.160]  If you own a septic system or if you're facing costly septic system replacement, this message
[03:05:06.160 --> 03:05:07.160]  is for you.
[03:05:07.160 --> 03:05:10.320]  When you want to stop paying for pump outs and avoid backups, when you've had enough

[03:06:18.280 --> 03:06:22.120]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change

[03:06:26.440 --> 03:06:29.400]  your children and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[03:06:29.400 --> 03:06:30.400]  Could this really happen?
[03:06:30.400 --> 03:06:34.480]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[03:06:34.480 --> 03:06:38.600]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and America's
[03:06:38.600 --> 03:06:40.760]  biggest mall owner General Growth Properties.
[03:06:40.760 --> 03:06:43.560]  In fact, Barron's called his work a tired prophecy.

[03:08:13.600 --> 03:08:16.040]  We are now entering overdrive.
[03:08:16.040 --> 03:08:21.120]  With your host, Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:08:21.120 --> 03:08:27.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:27.800 --> 03:08:32.760]  It's no joke, my friends, and I know I rant and rave.
[03:08:32.760 --> 03:08:33.760]  It's because I'm sick of it.
[03:08:33.760 --> 03:08:35.680]  I, I, all day, I research this stuff.
[03:08:35.680 --> 03:08:37.280]  I go home at night.
[03:08:37.280 --> 03:08:38.840]  I have nightmares about it.
[03:08:38.840 --> 03:08:41.440]  I wake up at like 6 a.m. worried about it.
[03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:45.280]  And I just research, research, research, and to the point of I can't handle it.
[03:08:45.280 --> 03:08:49.600]  The globalists have always planned to merge the United States with Mexico and Canada.
[03:08:49.600 --> 03:08:52.000]  They're going to create ethnic enclaves.
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:56.840]  They create a larger system where none of the countries have sovereign to your rights.
[03:08:56.840 --> 03:09:03.320]  But then within those regions, they break them up with the French separatists, uh, with
[03:09:03.320 --> 03:09:06.400]  trying to get the Hispanics for a Southwest.
[03:09:06.400 --> 03:09:10.440]  Reuters is reporting today that they're moving to break Arizona in half.
[03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:12.400]  It's now going to the state legislature.
[03:09:12.400 --> 03:09:16.400]  They have the power to do it because the people have the power to create new governments.
[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:20.440]  Not if they're being manipulated by a foreign government, that's then treason.
[03:09:20.440 --> 03:09:22.800]  But that's basically getting no attention.
[03:09:22.800 --> 03:09:25.800]  And I wanted to talk to a few more former current military police.
[03:09:25.800 --> 03:09:31.760]  Uh, we'll talk to, uh, Randy Frank and Kevin, Kevin's in the militia and the militia is
[03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:34.400]  every man 18 to 54.
[03:09:34.400 --> 03:09:36.240]  They act like it's some dirty, crazy thing.
[03:09:36.240 --> 03:09:39.840]  It's like if a state wants to have sovereignty, which it has under the 9th and 10th amendment
[03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:44.240]  and tell the feds you have no jurisdiction, you know, all powers are reserved to the state
[03:09:44.240 --> 03:09:45.240]  of the people.
[03:09:45.240 --> 03:09:50.040]  No secession, murder, killing, war, you know, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're
[03:09:50.040 --> 03:09:51.040]  violent.
[03:09:51.040 --> 03:09:54.240]  Meanwhile, all the Democrats want to break off the state in two and have it be an on
[03:09:54.240 --> 03:09:55.240]  club in Mexico.
[03:09:55.240 --> 03:09:56.240]  Oh, good.
[03:09:56.240 --> 03:09:57.240]  It's going to the state house.
[03:09:57.240 --> 03:09:58.240]  Yeah.
[03:09:58.240 --> 03:10:00.240]  We're going to start taking the Southwest from Mexico.
[03:10:00.240 --> 03:10:01.240]  Yay.
[03:10:01.240 --> 03:10:02.240]  Oh, sweet.
[03:10:02.240 --> 03:10:03.240]  I'm sorry.
[03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:07.400]  Uh, Randy, finishing your point about this takedown that they're really getting people
[03:10:07.400 --> 03:10:08.400]  ready for now.
[03:10:08.400 --> 03:10:09.400]  Go ahead.
[03:10:09.400 --> 03:10:11.400]  Uh, right.
[03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:15.560]  Well, what I'm hoping that we can do so we don't overwhelm people and it's one of the
[03:10:15.560 --> 03:10:16.560]  problems I had.
[03:10:16.560 --> 03:10:21.320]  I, I got so overwhelmed with this, Alex, just like you do at a certain point, I stepped
[03:10:21.320 --> 03:10:26.440]  away from it for about five years and 9 11 hit and they shut down my gold trades.
[03:10:26.440 --> 03:10:27.440]  I couldn't get out of it.
[03:10:27.440 --> 03:10:30.840]  I had some, I made some, a lot of money, but they shut down the COMEX.
[03:10:30.840 --> 03:10:37.440]  I couldn't, I couldn't cash in, you know, but that got me back to where I was ready
[03:10:37.440 --> 03:10:40.960]  to start looking at things and some of the people that were saying, you know, 9 11 truth
[03:10:40.960 --> 03:10:44.840]  were so nutty, but they're, they're, they didn't have a sophistication to approach
[03:10:44.840 --> 03:10:45.840]  people the right way.
[03:10:45.840 --> 03:10:50.480]  And I, I, there needs to be, we need to develop a program to bring people up to speed.
[03:10:50.480 --> 03:10:54.800]  It's like, you know, a slow debriefing because it overwhelms most people to think that our
[03:10:54.800 --> 03:10:59.480]  government, you know, the criminal element in the government is doing what it's doing.
[03:10:59.480 --> 03:11:02.360]  But I mean, in every case, they're running the terrorist.
[03:11:02.360 --> 03:11:06.360]  I mean, I've never seen a case of a high profile attack where they weren't completely
[03:11:06.360 --> 03:11:10.480]  handled by the government and these, and these patches are so dumb, they have to hold their
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:11.880]  hand to do it.
[03:11:11.880 --> 03:11:15.960]  The first world trade center attack, the underwear bomber, all of it.
[03:11:15.960 --> 03:11:16.960]  Yeah.
[03:11:16.960 --> 03:11:22.880]  I mean, it's, it's all over the place and people can't imagine something this extreme
[03:11:22.880 --> 03:11:23.880]  happening.
[03:11:23.880 --> 03:11:27.880]  I mean, did they imagine other, they have honest representatives, which brings the other
[03:11:27.880 --> 03:11:28.880]  point up.
[03:11:28.880 --> 03:11:34.240]  We've got to go visit state reps, state senators, local sheriffs, you know, two by two, usually
[03:11:34.240 --> 03:11:39.320]  two or three people, small group and approach them and, and develop that relationship.
[03:11:39.320 --> 03:11:43.200]  Well, I agree with you, Randy, but here's my frustration and why I do get out of control.
[03:11:43.200 --> 03:11:48.440]  I have to sit there every day looking at these top politicians, foreign operatives and people
[03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:54.160]  knowing they're corrupt globalist and knowing that they're complicit in all this.
[03:11:54.160 --> 03:11:59.560]  And, and it's, it's just, I want to bring them to justice and I think about it'd be
[03:11:59.560 --> 03:12:04.360]  one thing, even if they just stopped, they run everything, they're robbing everybody.
[03:12:04.360 --> 03:12:08.440]  I'm so beat down and almost be like, okay, fine.
[03:12:08.440 --> 03:12:10.620]  But the problem is they're not going to stop.
[03:12:10.620 --> 03:12:15.320]  They're going to keep going and going and going and going into a really nasty form of
[03:12:15.320 --> 03:12:16.320]  tyranny.
[03:12:16.320 --> 03:12:20.380]  And at a certain point, you just get to the point where you're like, these people have
[03:12:20.380 --> 03:12:24.840]  got to be met and I'm doing everything I can in the info award to alert as many people
[03:12:24.840 --> 03:12:29.160]  as I can, but I can't look at these people anymore.
[03:12:29.160 --> 03:12:31.040]  I can't listen to their lives anymore.
[03:12:31.040 --> 03:12:35.440]  I mean, these are really evil people and they're recruiting people into their system.
[03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:39.120]  They're expanding their system and it is getting right down to the wire.
[03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:41.760]  Do you agree, Randy, that, that it's two minutes to midnight?
[03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:48.560]  I mean, internal passports, checkpoints, no travel list, not just for planes, domestic
[03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:49.560]  spy forces.
[03:12:49.560 --> 03:12:52.440]  I mean, we're starting to live 1984.
[03:12:52.440 --> 03:12:53.960]  I mean, this is creepy.
[03:12:53.960 --> 03:12:54.960]  Yeah.
[03:12:54.960 --> 03:12:57.880]  I don't know how to, how soon it's going to happen.
[03:12:57.880 --> 03:12:58.880]  That's one of the problems.
[03:12:58.880 --> 03:13:02.320]  The limbs I'm facing is just like you said, you're down at Port Aransas, these old folks,
[03:13:02.320 --> 03:13:03.320]  the veterans are down there.
[03:13:03.320 --> 03:13:07.160]  They're clueless about what's going on and you said something about what, you know, how
[03:13:07.160 --> 03:13:09.880]  Christ said, you deal with the general public.
[03:13:09.880 --> 03:13:14.000]  It's just like children and it's going to be one of the most difficult things when they,
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:17.320]  when they recognize what they've done or what they've missed and the blindness that they've
[03:13:17.320 --> 03:13:18.320]  been under.
[03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:26.320]  So again, getting, you know, getting a series that's kind of soft, softly allows people
[03:13:26.320 --> 03:13:30.640]  to begin to form their conclusions as they see the reality, to go back to Pearl Harbor,
[03:13:30.640 --> 03:13:31.640]  what happened there?
[03:13:31.640 --> 03:13:35.080]  And this is not a first time in history, the Reichstag fires you've said before.
[03:13:35.080 --> 03:13:37.960]  And again, we're not saying the Japanese were good either.
[03:13:37.960 --> 03:13:39.120]  That was a corrupt evil government.
[03:13:39.120 --> 03:13:45.000]  The point is US military went into private groups, attack them in China, attack the Japanese,
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:49.280]  cut off their oil everywhere, had the purple and blue code, knew when the exact attack
[03:13:49.280 --> 03:13:50.280]  was coming.
[03:13:50.280 --> 03:13:55.320]  Honolulu advertiser one week before said they're going to attack on December 7th and they were
[03:13:55.320 --> 03:13:56.520]  ordered to stand down.
[03:13:56.520 --> 03:13:59.920]  It was staged and that's now been declassified.
[03:13:59.920 --> 03:14:04.320]  So the point is that's how cold-blooded they are.
[03:14:04.320 --> 03:14:05.840]  They are, they're not going to stop.
[03:14:05.840 --> 03:14:09.520]  I mean, they've got their marching orders and it goes all the way up the chain.
[03:14:09.520 --> 03:14:15.520]  So yeah, I go back to, we've got a fight at the state level, county level and in Oklahoma,
[03:14:15.520 --> 03:14:19.720]  they took away from the sheriff, the executive authority, they gave it to the attorney, to
[03:14:19.720 --> 03:14:20.720]  the district attorneys.
[03:14:20.720 --> 03:14:21.720]  Yeah.
[03:14:21.720 --> 03:14:26.720]  So, so we've got the courts now, basically district attorneys, what is officer of the
[03:14:26.720 --> 03:14:27.720]  court, right?
[03:14:27.720 --> 03:14:31.960]  Yeah, I know it's in a lot of states are trying to get rid of sheriffs altogether, just like
[03:14:31.960 --> 03:14:36.520]  they took, got rid of senators being elected by the, the legislatures, so they were creatures
[03:14:36.520 --> 03:14:37.520]  of the state.
[03:14:37.520 --> 03:14:39.240]  I appreciate your call.
[03:14:39.240 --> 03:14:41.440]  Folks, it's big business.
[03:14:41.440 --> 03:14:43.640]  The globalists have already stole this blind.
[03:14:43.640 --> 03:14:47.760]  We're just now finding out that they stole this blind and then signed us on to unlimited
[03:14:47.760 --> 03:14:50.300]  debt as their debtor slaves.
[03:14:50.300 --> 03:14:55.160]  And so they're going to stage terror attacks to make us learn to love them.
[03:14:55.160 --> 03:14:57.700]  I mean, it's real simple.
[03:14:57.700 --> 03:15:03.000]  It's real simple and things are only going to get worse if, if we don't wake up and I'm
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:07.000]  telling you ahead of those mushroom clouds, ahead of them really pulling a big terror
[03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:11.200]  attack and then dropping the hammer and shutting down the free web as we know it and taking
[03:15:11.200 --> 03:15:14.760]  it over with government announcements and the old dinosaur media is going to love it.
[03:15:14.760 --> 03:15:19.840]  They're going to be back the only game in town and they will crow from the rooftops.
[03:15:19.840 --> 03:15:24.600]  You know, when they got me arrested in electroshock therapy for a month, six months, a year, so
[03:15:24.600 --> 03:15:28.480]  they can roll me out, drooling, saying I'm a terrorist and just at a certain point you
[03:15:28.480 --> 03:15:32.600]  got to say, you know what, that's not the way it's going to go down.
[03:15:32.600 --> 03:15:38.960]  And if 1% of us say no when they try to take us to the gulag, it isn't going to work for
[03:15:38.960 --> 03:15:42.440]  these Nazis, these globalists.
[03:15:42.440 --> 03:15:45.720]  I hope for the best, prepare for the worst and we try to fix things peacefully, but these
[03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:46.720]  are terrorists.
[03:15:46.720 --> 03:15:50.720]  These are drug dealing, murdering terrorists and folks better get that through your head.
[03:15:50.720 --> 03:15:52.400]  And the Pearl Harbor things are great parallel.
[03:15:52.400 --> 03:15:54.560]  They're not saying the Japanese are good.
[03:15:54.560 --> 03:15:58.040]  Their leadership, they were just as corrupt, just not as sophisticated and evil in their
[03:15:58.040 --> 03:16:01.360]  master plan as the globalist here.
[03:16:01.360 --> 03:16:04.480]  So they set them up and suck them into that.
[03:16:04.480 --> 03:16:05.680]  It's the same thing with Al Qaeda.
[03:16:05.680 --> 03:16:10.360]  The Muslim extremists are real, they're bad, just like with the Japanese.
[03:16:10.360 --> 03:16:12.400]  The point is they're being manipulated.
[03:16:12.400 --> 03:16:16.360]  The globalist, you've got to get in their mindset real fast, do final calls.
[03:16:16.360 --> 03:16:18.640]  Frank in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[03:16:18.640 --> 03:16:22.400]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[03:16:22.400 --> 03:16:27.240]  I think people are going to be gravely disappointed if they think more than 1% of the American
[03:16:27.240 --> 03:16:31.440]  population is going to stand up against us at some point in time.
[03:16:31.440 --> 03:16:38.320]  I think most Americans are cowards, both physical and specifically even more important, moral
[03:16:38.320 --> 03:16:39.320]  cowards.
[03:16:39.320 --> 03:16:44.960]  I am a former Marine and I didn't wake up until years after I got out of the Marine
[03:16:44.960 --> 03:16:50.480]  Corps and you were the person who finally shook me awake, but that's been quite a few
[03:16:50.480 --> 03:16:52.040]  years ago.
[03:16:52.040 --> 03:16:58.600]  With the advent of the Internet, Alex, no one has any excuse not to know what is going
[03:16:58.600 --> 03:16:59.600]  on.
[03:16:59.600 --> 03:17:03.400]  If you're an adult and you're in the military or you're a cop and you know what's going
[03:17:03.400 --> 03:17:06.280]  on, you know that you're working for the bad guys.
[03:17:06.280 --> 03:17:10.560]  You're working for the guys who blew up the buildings or however they came down.
[03:17:10.560 --> 03:17:13.080]  You're working for the guys who bring in the drugs.
[03:17:13.080 --> 03:17:19.360]  You can go all over the Internet, there's former FBI, CIA, government officials, talking,
[03:17:19.360 --> 03:17:25.080]  exposing, I mean just FBI, Ted Gunderson for example, I mean I could go on and on and
[03:17:25.080 --> 03:17:26.080]  on.
[03:17:26.080 --> 03:17:27.680]  There's no excuse not to know.
[03:17:27.680 --> 03:17:28.680]  All you got to know is the FBI.
[03:17:28.680 --> 03:17:33.200]  Gary Webb won a Pulitzer Prize, they went to his house and shot him twice in the head.
[03:17:33.200 --> 03:17:37.640]  He had a new book coming out, totally proving it, and then the local cops were so corrupt
[03:17:37.640 --> 03:17:41.400]  they said, oh he committed suicide, twice in the head with a shotgun.
[03:17:41.400 --> 03:17:46.480]  I'll tell you another thing, it's getting harder and harder to get on, even just for
[03:17:46.480 --> 03:17:52.560]  a brief moment, onto these neocon talk shows that I try and get on to over the years.
[03:17:52.560 --> 03:17:56.080]  The screening process has become incredible.
[03:17:56.080 --> 03:17:59.920]  It's like if you have a brain, if you can rub two brain cells together, they are not
[03:17:59.920 --> 03:18:01.080]  going to let you on there.
[03:18:01.080 --> 03:18:02.800]  No, you have to lie to get on.
[03:18:02.800 --> 03:18:03.800]  You have to act like a...
[03:18:03.800 --> 03:18:06.160]  Well I know, I know.
[03:18:06.160 --> 03:18:12.800]  I know sir, it's because the system, I mean that's the thing.
[03:18:12.800 --> 03:18:16.760]  I'm not even scared, Frank, I'm disgusted.
[03:18:16.760 --> 03:18:22.320]  I mean I can't believe the slimy-est scum you can imagine.
[03:18:22.320 --> 03:18:27.760]  Just the most horrible, wicked people you can imagine aren't on TV talking about internal
[03:18:27.760 --> 03:18:33.000]  passports to be able to travel, on a train or in your car, and they're sticking their
[03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:34.400]  hands down baby's pants.
[03:18:34.400 --> 03:18:41.000]  I mean they are getting us ready to put their hands on us, to come in our houses, and by
[03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:45.880]  the way the globalists know the cops and military are going to get chewed up in this
[03:18:45.880 --> 03:18:50.560]  process and they're even happy about that because they're going to roll in with their
[03:18:50.560 --> 03:18:52.840]  real criminal brigades after that.
[03:18:52.840 --> 03:18:56.560]  I mean do you think the military and police know that once they really drop the hammer
[03:18:56.560 --> 03:19:02.560]  for hot martial law, what it's going to be like for the police?
[03:19:02.560 --> 03:19:07.520]  I don't know, I think they're in denial but they also know that they're propping up that
[03:19:07.520 --> 03:19:11.880]  peace system because they think they benefit from it.
[03:19:11.880 --> 03:19:16.280]  Maybe some of the better ones think that somehow it'll change by itself over a period of years
[03:19:16.280 --> 03:19:20.920]  or whatever and they can hold their position in it until it gets better.
[03:19:20.920 --> 03:19:24.480]  It's not going to happen, it's not going to get better, it's getting worse and worse
[03:19:24.480 --> 03:19:28.920]  and I think those of us that have been awake for a while, you know something bad is getting
[03:19:28.920 --> 03:19:29.920]  ready to happen.
[03:19:29.920 --> 03:19:36.560]  I can feel it man, I've never been this awake, it's not even shook up, it's more like, it's
[03:19:36.560 --> 03:19:41.320]  more like disgusted, it's like we have to go through this and the thing is I don't even
[03:19:41.320 --> 03:19:45.800]  get all macho and then think about the new order's minions like oh they'll get theirs,
[03:19:45.800 --> 03:19:51.000]  they're just brainwashed idiots and there's no pleasure in any of it except for not being
[03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:52.720]  under their control mentally.
[03:19:52.720 --> 03:19:57.000]  At least I've got that, God bless you, sorry to Kevin and others, back tomorrow live, retransmission
[03:19:57.000 --> 03:20:01.520]  coming up from Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, we'll be right back, great job at the crib.
