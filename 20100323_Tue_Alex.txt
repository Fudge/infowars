[00:25.720 --> 00:33.960]  in infamy America goes into complete collectivism there is no longer any
[00:33.960 --> 00:41.800]  doubt we are more communist than Russia use today they passed it on the 21st in
[00:41.800 --> 00:46.760]  the House of Representatives it left the Senate yesterday on the 22nd and on
[00:46.760 --> 00:56.200]  this Tuesday the 23rd day of March 2010 Obamacare was signed about three
[00:56.200 --> 01:02.360]  minutes ago he used ten or more pins he would use one pin for part of the B and
[01:02.360 --> 01:15.080]  another pin for the a because these are holy relics these are X calibers that
[01:15.080 --> 01:21.440]  were plunged into the heart of our constitutional Republic okay I'm gonna
[01:21.440 --> 01:27.120]  talk today about what's really in the bill the key bullet points of the 16
[01:27.120 --> 01:34.280]  new taxes that are in it more than 50 draconian police state points we're
[01:34.280 --> 01:38.160]  also gonna get a perspective in 30 minutes for 30 minutes in the next
[01:38.160 --> 01:42.720]  hour with Mike Adams from an alternative medicine view of what's in the
[01:42.720 --> 01:47.160]  bill and of course it goes after that the federal government with the IRS is
[01:47.160 --> 01:51.440]  its enforcer is now your doctor with their new comparative care where they
[01:51.440 --> 01:56.040]  decide what you get this was written by the insurance companies as a giant
[01:56.040 --> 02:01.560]  wealth redistribution to themselves the fools all over television sharing
[02:01.560 --> 02:06.880]  saying I'm gonna get free health care now have no idea what's about to happen
[02:06.880 --> 02:10.640]  at the same idiots a year and a half ago when Obama got elected in November
[02:10.640 --> 02:14.880]  saying my car is paid for I don't worry about my house oh thank you mr.
[02:14.880 --> 02:21.720]  president my life is saved you're gonna give me everything what fools to the
[02:21.720 --> 02:26.680]  slaughter but more importantly today we're gonna talk about how we defeat
[02:26.680 --> 02:35.800]  this legislation how we repeal it how we stop it because if you're counting on
[02:35.800 --> 02:42.360]  the Republican Party to get rid of this in the Republican Party's current state
[02:42.360 --> 02:46.840]  it's current makeup it's current leadership don't hold your breath because
[02:46.840 --> 02:52.240]  you're gonna die now the globalists know destroying America takes time that's
[02:52.240 --> 02:58.040]  why they implement this over the next seven and a half years none of it kicks
[02:58.040 --> 03:03.680]  in well the taxes kick in immediately but none of the so-called freebie start
[03:03.680 --> 03:09.160]  kicking in and then more draconian control until 2013 15 and finally 18
[03:09.160 --> 03:13.240]  they want to take their time they want you to politically forget about this and
[03:13.240 --> 03:15.520]  go back to sleep
[03:15.520 --> 03:23.280]  meanwhile nationwide real conservatives real constitutionalist running for the
[03:23.280 --> 03:28.240]  House and Senate are being attacked mercilessly by the Republican Party not
[03:28.240 --> 03:31.160]  just Ron Paul in Texas with the Republicans running three people
[03:31.160 --> 03:36.920]  against him they failed but Rand Paul has the neocons Dick Cheney all the big
[03:36.920 --> 03:43.080]  publications raising money against him AIG is pouring money in to his
[03:43.080 --> 03:47.080]  competitors campaign and here's the Associated Press today Grayson can
[03:47.080 --> 03:53.000]  oversee Senate race that's his biggest challenger the Republican he's way ahead
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.680]  of the Democrat rands way ahead of the Republican as well but that doesn't
[03:56.680 --> 04:02.000]  matter because hold on to your hat Grayson runs the election system in
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.200]  Kentucky and the Republican run board said this has never been done before but
[04:07.200 --> 04:13.440]  it's now allowed the person Rand is running against gets to run the election
[04:13.440 --> 04:18.920]  haha that'd be like if you had Al Capone in federal court letting him be the
[04:18.920 --> 04:23.640]  judge Secretary of State Trey Grayson can oversee the US Senate race in
[04:23.640 --> 04:27.680]  Kentucky without any apparent conflict of interest a government ethics panel
[04:27.680 --> 04:33.360]  ruled Friday he is the chief elections official guaranteed he's going to give
[04:33.360 --> 04:37.640]  all his cronies in the election department jobs in the US Senate do you
[04:37.640 --> 04:42.440]  think there's a conflict of interest there well not according to the
[04:42.440 --> 04:47.760]  Republican Party and with people like Grayson you're gonna keep that health
[04:47.760 --> 04:53.040]  care bill the Republicans had the House Senate in the presidency for four years
[04:53.040 --> 04:58.920]  did they did they repeal anything abortion any of it no and they're not
[04:58.920 --> 05:04.320]  going to do this either one major world crisis away from having a totalitarian

[08:20.560 --> 08:26.840]  Phil Berg father of the birther joining us in the last hour today break down the
[08:26.840 --> 08:35.000]  latest developments with Barry Citaro Barry Citaro signed the bill it already
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.400]  passed the Senate weeks ago it passed the House and went back to the Senate and
[08:39.400 --> 08:47.240]  to the president last night he signed it about 11 minutes ago a minute or so shy
[08:47.240 --> 08:56.680]  of noon eastern time high noon and those crooks were so satisfied and they
[08:56.680 --> 09:03.120]  chanted yes we can yes we did and they're gonna chant yes we're gonna shut
[09:03.120 --> 09:06.880]  down your factory yes we're gonna home inspect you under the greenhouse gas
[09:06.880 --> 09:12.600]  taxes they're now back with that why not go for broke and they're gonna chant
[09:12.600 --> 09:18.280]  yes we can yes we did ban your guns and they're gonna chant yes we can yes we
[09:18.280 --> 09:22.640]  did stage terror attacks the blame it on the American people and use Northcom on
[09:22.640 --> 09:31.200]  us these are hardcore criminals and remember the Republican Party
[09:31.200 --> 09:37.360]  actually for the first six years of Bush's administration had the House the
[09:37.360 --> 09:44.040]  Senate and the executive did you see abortion get repealed no did you see
[09:44.040 --> 09:48.520]  the government triple in size yes did you see the Democrats vote with the
[09:48.520 --> 09:52.240]  Republicans for the Patriot Act to be used against the American people did you
[09:52.240 --> 10:00.120]  see the banks line up to Robus and did you see Obama like a relay runner grab
[10:00.120 --> 10:04.640]  the baton from Bush with perfect execution and run it across the finish
[10:04.640 --> 10:10.960]  line absolutely so Republican mainline Republican system are gonna make hay
[10:10.960 --> 10:16.560]  out of this and no doubt they're gonna get control of the house this year maybe
[10:16.560 --> 10:20.200]  even the Senate within the next two years
[10:20.200 --> 10:31.760]  three years and the presidency but if we don't make this the number one issue
[10:31.760 --> 10:37.640]  to repeal the EPA's executive fiat where they're coming out with all their new
[10:37.640 --> 10:45.920]  taxes and regulation on the greenhouse gas baloney and if we don't move to fully
[10:45.920 --> 10:56.160]  dismantle this government takeover of healthcare this country is done today I
[10:56.160 --> 10:59.720]  want to go over in more detail what's in the bill but I also want to talk about
[10:59.720 --> 11:11.760]  solutions to defeat it no longer the bill what's in this law now law totally
[11:11.760 --> 11:20.440]  unconstitutional totally illegal and look having 38 states 12 have already
[11:20.440 --> 11:24.920]  said they're gonna file so the media saying it's only 12 but 38 states have
[11:24.920 --> 11:29.400]  said they're gonna block it it's not enough to have 38 states file lawsuits
[11:29.400 --> 11:34.520]  with the federal government in their federal whorehouse court that it's gonna
[11:34.520 --> 11:44.320]  go to in DC that's not enough in fact that's not even a beginning the states
[11:44.320 --> 11:49.000]  need to all be called into emergency session start calling your state if
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.720]  they're not in session right now you tell them block what whatever other
[11:53.720 --> 11:58.680]  garbage bills they're trying to pass to raise taxes or hire more cops or open
[11:58.680 --> 12:03.200]  the borders up or whatever trees in there engaged in you tell them drop all
[12:03.200 --> 12:11.840]  that right now and start state-level recalls of your senators and house
[12:11.840 --> 12:20.960]  members you call for your states to go into emergency session and pass very
[12:20.960 --> 12:31.520]  strong laws with great white shark teeth in their mouth we've got the bill of
[12:31.520 --> 12:34.400]  rights we've got the Constitution we've got the state laws we've got the 9th
[12:34.400 --> 12:38.920]  and 10th amendment you tell the states you pass laws with serious teeth in
[12:38.920 --> 12:47.120]  them that no federal agency will enforce any of this unconstitutional
[12:47.120 --> 12:51.080]  criminality and look if they want to try to march troops in the courthouses and
[12:51.080 --> 12:55.400]  state houses let them try this isn't some moral issue where the feds could
[12:55.400 --> 12:59.640]  march in because they wouldn't let black kids into a school CNN always plays
[12:59.640 --> 13:03.640]  clips of that and says let the states try to block this and sure they'll bring
[13:03.640 --> 13:08.560]  out a rent a mob of illegal aliens and welfare people to stand and chant in
[13:08.560 --> 13:12.560]  front of the military to make it look like the people want this but the real
[13:12.560 --> 13:16.920]  people of America black white old young it doesn't matter Hispanic Asian
[13:16.920 --> 13:20.720]  anybody who is in a parasite and who's free market and believes in a free
[13:20.720 --> 13:25.920]  society anyone who doesn't want to be slaves and that's what this is will be
[13:25.920 --> 13:31.520]  out there to meet him and it's going to take a fight but the feds will back off
[13:31.520 --> 13:36.200]  they're not going to call the army out to do this the feds aren't going to get
[13:36.200 --> 13:40.560]  away with this you take your states back and you say no our state is a free
[13:40.560 --> 13:46.800]  state this bill is discriminatory this bill was passed illegally it's openly
[13:46.800 --> 13:54.920]  unconstitutional this is as bad as what Europe has but it isn't socialism and
[13:54.920 --> 13:58.440]  Europe they take a big part of the working person's paycheck and give you
[13:58.440 --> 14:02.840]  supposed watered down cruddy healthcare where you wait 18 months for cancer
[14:02.840 --> 14:08.680]  surgery and die or you go for a month without being given a bath these are all
[14:08.680 --> 14:12.280]  confirmed cases they just treat you like absolute garbage the bureaucrats and big
[14:12.280 --> 14:16.040]  banks get all the money the banks take your money for healthcare and give about
[14:16.040 --> 14:19.480]  10% on average for actual healthcare that's how this works this is just a
[14:19.480 --> 14:27.760]  new tax and federal regulatory control over all the states
[14:31.920 --> 14:41.000]  and they're coming in at every level and we're going to go over it today but the
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.800]  solution is an aggressive campaign the state level and you cannot let mainline
[14:45.800 --> 14:49.760]  Republicans who were bought and paid for by the very same insurance companies
[14:49.760 --> 14:54.040]  that wrote this legislation for the banking system that owns them you have
[14:54.040 --> 15:00.480]  got to get people in like Rand Paul you have got to run for Congress and Senate
[15:00.480 --> 15:04.120]  yourself you've got to run for state house you've got to support people that
[15:04.120 --> 15:10.080]  are running who swear to stand in front of the government's tanks this
[15:10.080 --> 15:15.560]  illegitimate criminal government's tanks if need be it is time to say no
[15:15.560 --> 15:23.800]  this is the United States this is not Soviet or Communist Russia or China but
[15:23.800 --> 15:27.880]  this is even worse than that sure the Communist always kept most the money
[15:27.880 --> 15:31.040]  and stole it for themselves and got everybody dependent and fighting over
[15:31.040 --> 15:35.240]  scarce resources government comes in makes the resources more scarce so then
[15:35.240 --> 15:38.600]  they can dole them out to people to control everyone and become fabulously
[15:38.600 --> 15:42.840]  wealthy and powerful for themselves and special interest but this is even worse
[15:42.840 --> 15:50.600]  because it doesn't even have any free health care this was written by the
[15:50.600 --> 15:55.800]  insurance companies on record but they ran that little scam where the media kept
[15:55.800 --> 16:03.320]  saying the insurance companies don't want this our job is to get the wall
[16:03.320 --> 16:07.960]  street journal articles out and the statements by the lobbyist and the
[16:07.960 --> 16:12.600]  business week articles it's all out there but they all spin it like it's a
[16:12.600 --> 16:16.160]  good thing they report it dryly that hey this bill isn't too bad the insurance
[16:16.160 --> 16:20.240]  companies wrote it we have to get that message out because the Republicans are
[16:20.240 --> 16:25.880]  gonna come out and say Obama's a commie and the Kremlin's running him no
[16:25.880 --> 16:30.320]  Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase are that's who pumped a billion bucks into this
[16:30.320 --> 16:35.760]  guy they're gonna pose like it's communism and and which is bad enough but
[16:35.760 --> 16:40.960]  it's not and oh you know we've got to go after the Democrats you remove the
[16:40.960 --> 16:44.000]  Democrats you're just gonna have the Republicans you have to remove the
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.480]  entire lot of establishment types because the Republicans are gonna go in
[16:48.480 --> 16:53.160]  they'll probably never even repeal it because you've got to have 60 senators
[16:53.160 --> 17:02.600]  and a two-thirds majority in the house a super majority oh they put it in there
[17:02.600 --> 17:08.520]  where these shackles are bolted on and welded on and Houdini's gonna have
[17:08.520 --> 17:15.080]  trouble getting out of this at the federal level you just have the state
[17:15.080 --> 17:20.600]  say no and the states can do that you know the south the civil war was not
[17:20.600 --> 17:23.480]  about slavery and Abraham Lincoln wrote about that and spoke about that it was
[17:23.480 --> 17:27.120]  about they almost had a war when Andrew Jackson was president but because he was
[17:27.120 --> 17:30.760]  a southerner he could talk to the south and stop the war that the British were
[17:30.760 --> 17:36.720]  manipulating but the south had real grievances it was over higher taxes on
[17:36.720 --> 17:43.720]  tobacco and cotton and things like that and corn and wheat then on goods in the
[17:43.720 --> 17:52.720]  north it was on the federal government telling the states what to do they just
[17:52.720 --> 17:56.080]  lied to you in the history books the other they teach the kids in school any
[17:56.080 --> 17:59.680]  real main main line history book admits the truth that it was about trade and
[17:59.680 --> 18:03.920]  about taxes and the feds came in and they burned down every major city in the
[18:03.920 --> 18:13.200]  south and murdered hundreds of thousands and since the 1860s then they put
[18:13.200 --> 18:20.240]  troops in all the towns and then by 1878 the south had rebelled and the feds
[18:20.240 --> 18:25.920]  had been thrown out to regional governors that were put in over Texas were
[18:25.920 --> 18:32.240]  kicked out at gunpoint down the street from where I sit oh they don't put that
[18:32.240 --> 18:37.280]  in the kids textbooks though it's in mainline history and so that's what

[22:11.760 --> 22:15.520]  medical many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line
[22:15.520 --> 22:18.960]  is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the federal

[22:21.440 --> 22:25.360]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes these questions and more can be answered

[24:11.840 --> 24:16.080]  the democratic party is so lawless they tried to pass this bill without even
[24:16.080 --> 24:20.320]  voting on it but they dropped that saturday
[24:20.320 --> 24:25.040]  obama about 30 minutes ago or a little less
[24:25.040 --> 24:31.760]  signed the bill into law it is law and it is criminal
[24:31.760 --> 24:36.480]  so the bottom line here is if we let the republican party
[24:36.480 --> 24:44.240]  manage the supposed reversal of all of this
[24:45.760 --> 24:49.360]  if we let them play the part of our saviors they are going
[24:49.360 --> 24:54.000]  to keep most of this legislation in place because they work for the same banks
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.840]  that own the insurance companies that wrote this legislation if we
[24:57.840 --> 25:01.520]  fight this as if we're against giving people free healthcare
[25:01.520 --> 25:06.240]  the dumb down mass out there a large percentage of people
[25:06.240 --> 25:09.680]  will go along with this and not understand the debate if we point out
[25:09.680 --> 25:13.120]  that both parties are involved this is a giant hoax
[25:13.120 --> 25:17.520]  a scam and that the insurance companies wrote it and if we quote to the
[25:17.520 --> 25:21.200]  democrats what howard dean and what dentist percentage and others
[25:21.200 --> 25:24.560]  said when they told the truth before they flip-flopped
[25:24.560 --> 25:28.720]  we can defeat this if we explain to people that all the new taxes all the
[25:28.720 --> 25:33.200]  new regulations all the new controlled
[25:36.160 --> 25:39.360]  that is coming down on them is to pay the banks
[25:39.360 --> 25:43.840]  money that they've swindled then we can defeat this it is important from day
[25:43.840 --> 25:46.640]  one while people are paying attention to this issue
[25:46.640 --> 25:51.040]  before it fades off into the distance then we have a chance of defeating it
[25:51.040 --> 25:53.760]  i got a couple emails last night and i saw a comment
[25:53.760 --> 25:58.240]  on one of my youtube videos somebody saying alex you said this thing was
[25:58.240 --> 26:02.000]  going to put massive taxes on us and make us lose jobs and
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.880]  that there's implantable microchips in the legislation
[26:04.880 --> 26:08.480]  if i don't see this happen in the next few days
[26:08.480 --> 26:13.040]  i'm going to expose you what a fool you are and the globalists know you're a
[26:13.040 --> 26:16.640]  fool those of you that sent me those emails and
[26:16.640 --> 26:21.040]  made those comments this doesn't start kicking in until 2013
[26:21.040 --> 26:24.880]  they know you're going to forget about it so they can quietly sneak in under
[26:24.880 --> 26:28.640]  stealth and implement it we got the spp documents three years ago
[26:28.640 --> 26:33.200]  through four-year lawsuits north american union
[26:33.200 --> 26:37.200]  what did it state that it had to be done by stealth that was the first item on
[26:37.200 --> 26:41.120]  the agenda the european union three years ago celebrated its 50th
[26:41.120 --> 26:45.200]  anniversary it didn't supposedly start till 2000
[26:45.200 --> 26:50.240]  but they set it up in 57 by stealth and those documents have now been released
[26:50.240 --> 26:54.560]  to the bbc they do this stuff slowly now the taxes are
[26:54.560 --> 26:57.760]  going to hit right away on people making over 125
[26:57.760 --> 27:02.640]  thousand dollars a year its joint incomes of 250
[27:02.640 --> 27:08.400]  it goes as high as a five percent added tax on top of the other tax increase
[27:08.400 --> 27:12.160]  obama's ramming through getting rid of the last tax cut
[27:12.160 --> 27:15.520]  so there will be americans for the first time in u.s history
[27:15.520 --> 27:22.480]  in a 45 percent tax bracket and all the big money people all the big banks
[27:22.480 --> 27:27.040]  they're offshore they get most your tax money they don't pay it
[27:27.040 --> 27:32.000]  this is going to be the restaurant owner you know who makes 300 000 a year
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.760]  they're just going to let people go this is going to be the guy that owns a card
[27:35.760 --> 27:38.960]  lot this is going to be the person that owns a tanning salon
[27:38.960 --> 27:43.920]  or owns a workout gym this is going to be the people that own a car rental
[27:43.920 --> 27:48.560]  place or a hotel all the big corporations are for this that's
[27:48.560 --> 27:51.760]  why business week reported that the big corporations are celebrating because
[27:51.760 --> 27:55.760]  this will vertically integrate the market
[27:58.960 --> 28:03.920]  now not only is it important that we all get the facts and that every one of
[28:03.920 --> 28:07.840]  you become extremely educated on the facts i know most of you are but some of
[28:07.840 --> 28:10.960]  the new listeners aren't so you can speak to this issue
[28:10.960 --> 28:13.920]  at city council county commissioners the state house
[28:13.920 --> 28:17.680]  on a soapbox at your church never shut up about it
[28:17.680 --> 28:21.520]  because if they get away with this the sky is the limit
[28:21.520 --> 28:25.520]  but when we come back i want to talk about the pincer attack
[28:25.520 --> 28:29.680]  how the democrats are going to hit us and try to keep this in place
[28:29.680 --> 28:32.960]  and more importantly how the controlled opposition republicans are
[28:32.960 --> 28:36.880]  and i'm going to get to this report
[28:38.240 --> 28:43.280]  obama plans propaganda blitz to boost acceptance of health care bill
[28:43.280 --> 28:47.760]  they're announcing a giant blitzkrieg with taxpayer money because now that's
[28:47.760 --> 28:52.240]  law they can do this telling you how great it is and lying about it
[28:52.240 --> 28:57.520]  year after year after year and i'm already seeing tv ads by special
[28:57.520 --> 29:01.280]  interest being run telling you how great this is because they know in every
[29:01.280 --> 29:04.960]  major poll it's upwards or higher than 70 percent against it
[29:04.960 --> 29:08.320]  they know so we're going to break that down
[29:08.320 --> 29:12.000]  i'm also going to go over
[29:13.280 --> 29:16.080]  17
[29:16.640 --> 29:22.880]  taxes that are in the bill from the subsections and then i'm going to go
[29:22.880 --> 29:27.040]  over 50 depressing facts about the health care system
[29:27.040 --> 29:33.200]  that will make you beg for reform but then it's not just all the taxes and
[29:33.200 --> 29:37.120]  regulations and and surveilling the self-employed and harassing you
[29:37.120 --> 29:40.640]  the way this bill is written they can every year just start raising the taxes
[29:40.640 --> 29:44.480]  there's also the irs enforcing it and all the surveillance and regulation
[29:44.480 --> 29:48.640]  and control this is going to be a bombshell broadcast today
[29:48.640 --> 29:54.720]  stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run
[29:54.720 --> 29:59.520]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:00.240 --> 30:03.680]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing

[30:10.400 --> 30:13.680]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[30:13.680 --> 30:16.960]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen

[33:34.160 --> 33:38.400]  agenda when he leaves office and i don't see any way he's
[33:38.400 --> 33:43.760]  going to be in office in three years unless the republicans run another
[33:43.760 --> 33:47.360]  dead horse like bob dole against bill clinton
[33:47.360 --> 33:54.240]  in 1996 now let's go through it very simply here's how obama is going to
[33:54.240 --> 34:01.120]  raise your taxes by 1.9 trillion dollars
[34:01.120 --> 34:06.000]  9.154 billion number one disclosing all payments
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.440]  over 600 dollars to anybody total surveillance over all private business
[34:11.440 --> 34:15.280]  the irs expanding by an order of magnitude i mean it's
[34:15.280 --> 34:18.960]  it's unspeakable the unconstitutional power they're giving this group
[34:18.960 --> 34:22.160]  what is the tax by reestablishing reporting rules
[34:22.160 --> 34:25.680]  of deals over 600 dollars between individuals or businesses
[34:25.680 --> 34:28.960]  compliance in terms of paying proper taxes on such deals
[34:28.960 --> 34:34.720]  would increase making far fewer losses in the tax system that's what the bill
[34:34.720 --> 34:39.120]  says so total surveillance and control
[34:40.160 --> 34:47.280]  14.196 billion permanent increase in unemployment payroll tax just
[34:47.280 --> 34:52.160]  separate everybody's got to pay more to the unemployment tax
[34:52.160 --> 34:55.200]  which is run at the state level but controlled by the feds
[34:55.200 --> 34:58.400]  and i got my letter last year saying it's now part of the north american union
[34:58.400 --> 35:01.200]  reporting system i don't report to the feds or the state of
[35:01.200 --> 35:04.960]  texas i report to the security prosperity partnership
[35:04.960 --> 35:08.000]  what is the tax this is a proposal for the permanent
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.040]  extension of 0.2 increase to the original 6% unemployment insurance
[35:13.040 --> 35:21.760]  on the first 7,000 paid to employees annually 14.196 billion now law
[35:23.520 --> 35:31.040]  14.413 billion closed tax loopholes for insurance companies and their products
[35:31.040 --> 35:34.800]  this is meant to shut down the smaller companies while the big ones wrote it
[35:34.800 --> 35:38.480]  what is the tax the reforms in the insurance code are broad but include
[35:38.480 --> 35:41.840]  specific provisions meant to target the sale of life insurance contracts
[35:41.840 --> 35:45.680]  on the third parties who do not pay the full taxable amount even though
[35:45.680 --> 35:48.880]  they received the payout
[35:49.520 --> 35:55.680]  continuing 18.965 billion reinstate super fund taxes
[35:55.680 --> 35:58.560]  certain taxes on the production and use of dangerous chemicals
[35:58.560 --> 36:01.840]  were eliminated after 96 they were previously held
[36:01.840 --> 36:04.960]  in a fund for the purpose of paying for the damage from any dangerous chemical
[36:04.960 --> 36:08.080]  leak or spill now that fund is to be renewed the same
[36:08.080 --> 36:14.000]  purpose 23.729 billion remember it's always higher
[36:14.000 --> 36:18.640]  than what they say a state and gift tax loopholes closed
[36:18.640 --> 36:22.640]  they always call any money you keep a loophole they call gun shows being open
[36:22.640 --> 36:25.760]  a loophole how it works several rules relating to the
[36:25.760 --> 36:29.680]  estate tax will be modified for consistency purposes to avoid loopholes
[36:29.680 --> 36:33.040]  and such things as valuation and misuse of trust
[36:33.040 --> 36:38.800]  again this is from the bill so they spin it to sound good
[36:38.800 --> 36:45.120]  continuing 23.977 billion carried profits taxed on ordinary income
[36:45.120 --> 36:48.960]  this is an issue primarily to do with private equity hedge funds
[36:48.960 --> 36:52.720]  and other investment funds which charge individual profits as business profits
[36:52.720 --> 36:55.920]  thus reducing the tax rates on many employees
[36:55.920 --> 36:59.520]  carried interest this is to be changed so that these carrying interest profits
[36:59.520 --> 37:03.200]  are considered individual rather than business profits
[37:03.200 --> 37:08.080]  23.987 billion modified the
[37:08.080 --> 37:13.280]  cellulose biofuel producer credit changing the rules on current tax incentive
[37:13.280 --> 37:15.920]  for biofuel production again none of this has to do with
[37:15.920 --> 37:19.440]  health care you're beginning to notice it's nothing but a giant tax bill
[37:19.440 --> 37:22.160]  and it doesn't even give people free health care
[37:22.160 --> 37:26.240]  it's incredible changing the rules on tax incentive for biofuel production to
[37:26.240 --> 37:29.120]  exclude profits made from other purposes such as paper industry
[37:29.120 --> 37:32.800]  byproducts except so more taxes on american industry that's already moving
[37:32.800 --> 37:36.160]  to china this would allow the discount to go directly to the
[37:36.160 --> 37:41.440]  biofuel producers rather than products with tenuous links to the industry
[37:41.440 --> 37:45.120]  38.819 billion this is per year by the way
[37:45.120 --> 37:49.440]  eliminate fossil fuel tax preferences yeah tax your fuel more
[37:49.440 --> 37:54.320]  this repeals includes a wide range of incentives from tax credits for coal
[37:54.320 --> 37:59.120]  production to tax exemptions on drilling so
[37:59.120 --> 38:02.480]  a tax on drilling in america and becoming more
[38:02.480 --> 38:06.240]  self-sufficient can't do that that's evil but again china india
[38:06.240 --> 38:08.960]  100 plus countries no taxes everybody moves there
[38:08.960 --> 38:12.640]  we're not allowed to drill in the gulf but china and russia can they're moving
[38:12.640 --> 38:15.600]  in the changes are made to meet the g20 agreement
[38:15.600 --> 38:19.920]  that all subsidies on fossil fuel should be eliminated
[38:19.920 --> 38:23.600]  so that's part of the whole carbon tax flotilla of loss
[38:23.600 --> 38:28.800]  38.819 billion it'll be passed on to you every year
[38:31.520 --> 38:34.480]  and by the way i printed this but this didn't print the whole thing this
[38:34.480 --> 38:37.520]  doesn't have all the this doesn't have all the taxes in it
[38:37.520 --> 38:40.560]  this only has a fraction of them there's 17
[38:40.560 --> 38:47.680]  uh this is like 10 uh no the bonders the 50
[38:47.680 --> 38:54.160]  no no this is the 50 it's a separate this is only 10 of the 17
[38:54.160 --> 38:58.000]  thanks i need the last because this doesn't even get into all the taxes the
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.640]  2.5 the 5 percent tax on top of the other tax increases
[39:02.640 --> 39:10.640]  this doesn't get into any of that um continuing 59.085
[39:11.280 --> 39:14.800]  billion repeal of lifo accounting method
[39:14.800 --> 39:18.960]  for inventories the lifo is a form of accounting to do with inventory
[39:18.960 --> 39:22.640]  allowing firms to take a tax discount advantage
[39:22.640 --> 39:26.240]  over more internationally accepted rules such as
[39:26.240 --> 39:32.320]  fifo or first in first out changing this would result in
[39:32.320 --> 39:36.080]  simplifications for irs rules and sec compliance with international
[39:36.080 --> 39:39.600]  norms so it's all about going under international
[39:39.600 --> 39:45.680]  law and control
[39:49.680 --> 39:54.080]  now i'm going to get into all of the other taxes that are involved in this
[39:54.080 --> 40:02.960]  uh coming up but first i wanted to get into this piece of news
[40:02.960 --> 40:10.240]  obama plans propaganda blitz to boost acceptance of health care bill
[40:10.240 --> 40:14.400]  this is from cns news it's not enough for democrats to have passed their
[40:14.400 --> 40:18.080]  health care reform bill now they want everybody
[40:18.080 --> 40:21.600]  to like the bill that was rammed through congress without a single republican
[40:21.600 --> 40:24.880]  vote the washington post reported on money that president obama will begin
[40:24.880 --> 40:28.480]  an immediate public relations blitz aimed at turning around americans
[40:28.480 --> 40:31.200]  opinions on the health care bill really his approval
[40:31.200 --> 40:38.080]  writing just fell again to the lowest ever breaking all previous records
[40:38.080 --> 40:42.480]  the washington posted the pr effort will proceed in three stages the immediate
[40:42.480 --> 40:46.320]  aftermath of passage the months leading up to the
[40:46.320 --> 40:50.160]  midterm election in november and the next few years leading up to the
[40:50.160 --> 40:53.760]  2012 presidential election so three years of brainwashing
[40:53.760 --> 40:56.640]  and because it's a federal law they can run it as public service announcements
[40:56.640 --> 41:01.040]  telling you how great it is the republicans
[41:01.040 --> 41:04.160]  have way overshot the runway and their criticism of health reform the post
[41:04.160 --> 41:07.440]  quoted white house communications director
[41:07.440 --> 41:10.640]  saying on monday morning health and human services secretary kathleen
[41:10.640 --> 41:14.000]  sabilius says she believes people who dislike the bill
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.800]  will feel better as they learn more about it oh yes
[41:18.800 --> 41:22.320]  she told cbs the early show she thought that what was been going on
[41:22.320 --> 41:26.160]  for the better part of the year is a lot of attempts to confuse and scare
[41:26.160 --> 41:29.280]  americans sabilius said people will be happy
[41:29.280 --> 41:33.200]  with the legislation once they learn more about how it changes
[41:33.200 --> 41:36.720]  the rules governing how insurance companies operate but senator john
[41:36.720 --> 41:40.080]  mccain on monday denounced what he called the government takeover of
[41:40.080 --> 41:42.880]  health care mccain's even against it well you
[41:42.880 --> 41:45.920]  know it's bad mccain said republicans will change it every
[41:45.920 --> 41:48.880]  place we can and he called the legislation terribly wrong for america
[41:48.880 --> 41:53.040]  mccain said he was repulsed by all this euphoria going on
[41:53.040 --> 41:58.080]  and argued that outside the beltway the american people are very angry
[41:58.080 --> 42:03.760]  they don't like it and we're going to repeal this yeah i bet you are mccain
[42:03.760 --> 42:07.520]  again they're bought and paid for by the insurance companies and banks the big
[42:07.520 --> 42:10.960]  republicans are they wrote this and so they're they're playing it off like
[42:10.960 --> 42:14.560]  it's communism it's a total ripoffs what it is
[42:14.560 --> 42:19.120]  and that it's all the democrats know bush violated the constitution bush
[42:19.120 --> 42:22.640]  triple the size of government bush worked with the democrats
[42:22.640 --> 42:27.920]  and we can't allow this to happen again
[42:27.920 --> 42:30.720]  the problem is that the bankers start new wars
[42:30.720 --> 42:34.080]  or stage terror attacks people will tend to forget about this in their fake
[42:34.080 --> 42:38.320]  patriotism and we'll do whatever they're told we've got to get ahead of this
[42:38.320 --> 42:41.520]  and fully discredit the government this is a lawless
[42:41.520 --> 42:49.120]  criminal tool of big offshore banks to rape the country period
[42:49.120 --> 42:52.320]  show obama has now signed it he's going to launch onto the road
[42:52.320 --> 42:55.840]  out there lying to people telling folks how great it is and later i'm going to
[42:55.840 --> 42:58.160]  play a clip of him during the campaign promising
[42:58.160 --> 43:01.520]  that they that he would not sign or push for a vote on a bill
[43:01.520 --> 43:05.920]  until people had five days to read it they didn't make that bill public
[43:05.920 --> 43:11.440]  until saturday less than 24 hours from their vote
[43:11.440 --> 43:14.400]  and then it went to the senate and changes were made
[43:14.400 --> 43:18.160]  that no one was even allowed to see to the final bill that was made public
[43:18.160 --> 43:21.200]  this morning which i haven't even had a chance to see
[43:21.200 --> 43:26.880]  so you he didn't even give you an hour an hour
[43:26.880 --> 43:30.720]  to read the final bill before he signed it
[43:30.720 --> 43:37.680]  lies lies lies and more lies
[43:40.880 --> 43:44.560]  so on cns news runs the headline congress votes to socialize health care in
[43:44.560 --> 43:47.440]  united states
[43:47.520 --> 43:50.880]  i mean if people rob a bank that's not socializing that's robbing
[43:50.880 --> 43:53.680]  and socialism is bad enough but to all these liberals
[43:53.680 --> 43:56.800]  you need to be made to understand you think there's a free lunch you think
[43:56.800 --> 44:00.640]  taxing people five percent who make over a quarter million dollars a year you
[44:00.640 --> 44:03.600]  think that's cute and funny have you noticed the jobs are already shutting
[44:03.600 --> 44:05.600]  down have you noticed people don't want to hire more
[44:05.600 --> 44:08.720]  folks have you noticed a lot of doctors are retiring
[44:08.720 --> 44:12.320]  10 15 20 years early have you noticed that they can't get health care in
[44:12.320 --> 44:15.600]  england all of you idiots who thought government run
[44:15.600 --> 44:18.800]  health care was going to be fun but wondered why all the foreigners come
[44:18.800 --> 44:21.200]  here for health care you're about to learn why
[44:21.200 --> 44:28.560]  the truth is nobody got turned away from health care who knew their rights
[44:28.560 --> 44:31.360]  the government could have just given all americans five thousand dollars a
[44:31.360 --> 44:34.160]  year and this thing would have cost maybe
[44:34.160 --> 44:37.600]  15 percent of what it did but it isn't that it's taxes on oil
[44:37.600 --> 44:41.920]  taxes on land taxes on property taxes on everything
[44:41.920 --> 44:46.160]  under international law you heard me just read from the stinking bill
[44:46.160 --> 44:49.600]  just a moment ago and i didn't even go through half
[44:49.600 --> 44:52.160]  of the points we're going to go over those i thought i'd printed them they
[44:52.160 --> 44:56.160]  weren't on the back sheet my fault
[44:56.160 --> 44:59.280]  and i'm going to go over later the 50 depressing facts about the health care
[44:59.280 --> 45:01.680]  system
[45:04.400 --> 45:08.160]  here are the depressing facts i'll go into some of them now america spins
[45:08.160 --> 45:13.280]  7 290 per capita on health care far more than any other country
[45:13.280 --> 45:16.560]  and this is only going to go up while the quality goes down
[45:16.560 --> 45:20.000]  america spent 2.4 trillion on health care in 2008 that's nearly as much as
[45:20.000 --> 45:23.520]  food clothing and national defense combined because it's all a giant rip
[45:23.520 --> 45:26.080]  off and the insurance companies wrote the bill
[45:26.080 --> 45:30.640]  you think it's going to get better from 2000 2007 health care premiums increased
[45:30.640 --> 45:33.840]  10.6 a year in the same period overall inflation
[45:33.840 --> 45:39.680]  averaged 2.8 because government got involved 30 years ago a majority of
[45:39.680 --> 45:42.880]  americans complained that their doctors neither spend enough time with them
[45:42.880 --> 45:48.160]  nor respect them you think that's bad wait till you're like england
[45:49.600 --> 45:54.480]  only 28 of us doctors use electronic medical records 90 do in the uk
[45:54.480 --> 45:57.600]  that means federal control most doctors in europe are paid based on
[45:57.600 --> 46:02.400]  performance in america this is true only for 30
[46:05.920 --> 46:08.800]  and it goes on
[46:08.800 --> 46:17.280]  and on and on and remember obama's approval rating
[46:22.320 --> 46:25.680]  now here is some of the good news virginia calls
[46:25.680 --> 46:31.440]  health bill unconstitutional files suit
[46:32.320 --> 46:35.440]  the state of virginia has confirmed that it will sue the federal government
[46:35.440 --> 46:39.280]  over the health care reform bill declaring the legislation unconstitutional
[46:39.280 --> 46:43.360]  and legally conflicting the attorney general of virginia
[46:43.360 --> 46:46.640]  issued a statement last night giving notification that the state will file
[46:46.640 --> 46:49.680]  suit as soon as the president signs the bill into law this was written this
[46:49.680 --> 46:52.880]  morning by steve watson
[46:54.160 --> 46:57.760]  mike adams coming up in about 15 minutes wrote an article for natural news
[46:57.760 --> 47:00.880]  health care dictatorship a crime against america
[47:00.880 --> 47:06.800]  this is from the alternative medicine view
[47:06.800 --> 47:10.560]  38 states have said they're going to file suit 12 are confirming they're doing
[47:10.560 --> 47:14.560]  it today here's a bloomberg headline remember obama's
[47:14.560 --> 47:19.280]  spread the wealth comment yeah to the bankers new health care taxes help obama
[47:19.280 --> 47:25.280]  spread the wealth president barack obama said on the campaign trail october 28th
[47:25.280 --> 47:30.320]  in october 2008 that he wanted to spread the wealth around with obama on the
[47:30.320 --> 47:34.560]  verge of signing sweeping health care overhaul legislation
[47:34.560 --> 47:38.240]  and he's now done just that in the final version of legislation passed in the
[47:38.240 --> 47:41.760]  senate high income investors will pay higher
[47:41.760 --> 47:47.120]  medicare taxes tax breaks for out-of-pocket medical deductions will be
[47:47.120 --> 47:51.520]  curtailed yeah they've got taxes on tanning beds taxes on plastic surgery
[47:51.520 --> 47:55.280]  so you get your nose broken you're gonna pay extra for that
[47:55.280 --> 47:59.280]  taxes on medical care equipment and supplies that'll be passed on to you
[47:59.280 --> 48:02.560]  and it will cost insurance companies more to pay executives
[48:02.560 --> 48:06.800]  millions of dollars those levies will help fund expansion of medicaid
[48:06.800 --> 48:10.960]  and medicare services on the poor and subsidize health insurance to cover
[48:10.960 --> 48:14.640]  millions who don't currently have benefits it's very clear that taxes
[48:14.640 --> 48:17.520]  are levied on the wealthy and the benefits will spread across
[48:17.520 --> 48:20.560]  the entire income distribution with a lot going
[48:20.560 --> 48:24.160]  to expand medicaid distribution and expanding health insurance
[48:24.160 --> 48:27.840]  said robert williams see you're not going to be given insurance
[48:27.840 --> 48:32.640]  you're going to be going on government welfare you understand that
[48:32.720 --> 48:35.520]  then they spy on you it's a horrible level of care
[48:35.520 --> 48:41.040]  it's eugenics an economist at the tax policy center a washington research
[48:41.040 --> 48:45.040]  institute backed by the urban institute and brookie institution
[48:45.040 --> 48:48.240]  said one couldn't claim he didn't keep that one promise
[48:48.240 --> 48:52.320]  to spread the wealth around yeah this is the one promise obama kept
[48:52.320 --> 48:56.960]  in all the bill would generate 409.2 billion in addition
[48:56.960 --> 49:00.480]  taxes according to analysis by the congressional joint committee on
[49:00.480 --> 49:05.920]  taxation most the private estimates are 1.9 trillion
[49:05.920 --> 49:09.280]  most of the revenue would come from higher medicaid taxes on about one
[49:09.280 --> 49:12.640]  million individuals earning more than 200 000 and about four million
[49:12.640 --> 49:16.240]  couples who jointly file making more than 250 000
[49:16.240 --> 49:22.560]  yeah this is not on individuals over 250 this is on couples
[49:22.560 --> 49:26.880]  okay it's individuals of 200 couples over 250
[49:26.880 --> 49:30.560]  the legislation would for the first time apply
[49:30.560 --> 49:34.880]  medicare taxes to investment income received by these households
[49:34.880 --> 49:38.560]  beginning in 2013 so now they're setting the precedent to tax your
[49:38.560 --> 49:42.880]  investments on top of capital gains the 3.8 percent rate would apply to
[49:42.880 --> 49:46.560]  unearned income such as realized capital gains
[49:46.560 --> 49:49.360]  dividends that's on top of the already there taxes
[49:49.360 --> 49:52.960]  interest rents and royalties royalties and rents
[49:52.960 --> 49:56.480]  and interest it would apply to other incomes subject
[49:56.480 --> 50:00.480]  to income taxes including interest from municipal bonds and retirement
[50:00.480 --> 50:04.000]  accounts such as 401k plans until funds are withdrawn

[50:08.320 --> 50:12.400]  double triple quadruple taxing

[50:18.880 --> 50:22.960]  dividends and capital gains to rise to 20 percent by 2011
[50:22.960 --> 50:26.560]  for the same high earners layering a 3.8 percent
[50:26.560 --> 50:30.480]  medicare tax on top of that would mean a new top rate for individuals
[50:30.480 --> 50:36.400]  and capital gains of 23.8 on top of the new 45 percent tax bracket they've
[50:36.400 --> 50:40.160]  created as an overall income tax
[50:40.160 --> 50:45.440]  23.8 on top of 45 i mean they're talking about

[1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:09.360]  where do you want to start on this well i mean you can talk about
[1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:12.960]  areas of the bill you have problems with mccain trying to ban
[1:01:12.960 --> 1:01:16.960]  vitamins and minerals in the u.s canada has announced they're doing it
[1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:19.680]  people need to realize this stuff is really happening
[1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:23.280]  uh... but no i mean you you just whatever you think is most important
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:26.880]  it's a big area to cover but just dive right in mike
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:30.960]  yesterday i was in the office of dr julian wittaker he runs the largest
[1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:35.040]  alternative medicine clinic in north america he's one of the
[1:01:35.040 --> 1:01:38.560]  pioneers of health freedom and and i were talking about this he was
[1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:43.040]  absolutely filming he just couldn't believe that this happened
[1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:46.800]  in america this is supposed to be a free country where people have free choice
[1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:50.080]  but now we are all locked in we're locked in
[1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:53.680]  into a monopoly system a system that's broken alex
[1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:57.520]  i mean it doesn't even work all this these drugs and surgeries
[1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:01.440]  and medications and vaccines this is what we're being forced into
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:05.120]  without a choice being penalized by that's the key
[1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:10.080]  they penalize any surgery or any medicine or anything the
[1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:15.200]  government says isn't kosher and they're even going
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:18.400]  after mainline medical procedures and regular test
[1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:21.360]  not just alternative medicine and they're saying they're going to fine and
[1:02:21.360 --> 1:02:24.880]  fee you and take money out of your medical savings account
[1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:29.440]  and put taxes on companies and individuals if you take on alternate
[1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:34.080]  route this sets an incredible precedent well this is the conclusion we came to
[1:02:34.080 --> 1:02:37.920]  that the medical system the monopoly cannot afford
[1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:41.600]  to let americans have a free choice because if they did
[1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:44.960]  if people chose supplements if people chose
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:48.560]  vitamin d in sunlight and even tanning beds actually they help your body
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:51.280]  create vitamin d it's been scientifically proven
[1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:55.440]  in clinical trials by dr michael hollick they cannot let people have that
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:58.400]  free choice because the cancer industry would lose money
[1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:01.040]  the pharmacist the pharmaceutical industry would lose money
[1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:04.880]  they would lose patients out to natural medicine we have
[1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:08.480]  i wrote this in the article you mentioned we have a vitamin d deficiency
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:11.920]  epidemic in america and any real health care reform
[1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:15.680]  alex should start with nutrition so that we can prevent disease
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:19.920]  and prevent these costs and prevent our nation from going bankrupt from
[1:03:19.920 --> 1:03:24.640]  from health care costs well may come back we'll talk about that and and break it
[1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:28.720]  down but they know that you need moderate sun
[1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:31.600]  and that literally hundreds of major studies show
[1:03:31.600 --> 1:03:35.520]  that most cancer is generated because you do have this deficiency of the
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:39.040]  vitamin that the sunlight interacts with the skin and creates
[1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:42.000]  they know sodium fluoride the water is giving people cancer
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:45.600]  they know gmo food is massively increasing stomach
[1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:49.360]  intestine and colon cancer the government doesn't want you to be healthy
[1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:52.080]  and happy they're poisoning people by design
[1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:55.920]  and pushing ridland and prozac on the population yeah yeah that's right
[1:03:55.920 --> 1:03:58.960]  and now now they're making it even more difficult
[1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:03.040]  to get out of that and with mccain and his his effort that i call
[1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:07.360]  farm again and he's trying to just censor supplements and make sure that
[1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:12.240]  people can't even get therapeutic doses of basic vitamins like vitamin c
[1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:15.920]  things that we know help prevent disease and and i mean this
[1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:19.600]  this is i just even i'm surprised alex and how
[1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:24.160]  how bad this is getting now in america it it scares me too

[1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:46.160]  after alternative care in medicine it is just so
[1:04:46.160 --> 1:04:51.040]  unbelievable the magnitude of this my head

[1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:28.960]  law in the united states of america
[1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:45.200]  he hates america so much
[1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:50.880]  it is fitting that congress passed this historic legislation this week
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:55.200]  what a criminal for as we mark the turning of spring
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:09:01.600]  we also very satirical in a few moments when i know his name is fake
[1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:05.760]  all of the overheated rhetoric over reform will finally confront
[1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:10.240]  the reality of reform that the irs is going to rape everybody
[1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:13.680]  and take over our lives and shut down alternative medicine
[1:09:13.680 --> 1:09:17.040]  you mean that the senate still has the last round of improvements to make on
[1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:21.200]  this historic legislation and these are improvements i'm confident they will
[1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:37.120]  make swiftly this is what he said yesterday
[1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:47.440]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen Mike Adams
[1:09:47.440 --> 1:09:51.840]  runs natural news is our guest one of the preeminent experts on all the
[1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:54.400]  attempts by the un codex alimentarius
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:09:58.240]  john mccain and the white house to restrict vitamins minerals and alternative
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:03.840]  care that is in this bill but even mainline surgeries mainline test taxes
[1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:07.680]  on your health funds forcing everyone to buy health care
[1:10:07.680 --> 1:10:12.400]  uh just just an absolute rape with armed irs agents
[1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:18.000]  sixteen thousand five hundred to twenty thousand new irs agents to be involved
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.800]  looking in your bank accounts looking at your medical records
[1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:24.800]  the irs now controls what medical care you get
[1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:27.920]  that's not rhetoric that is the legislation
[1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:31.760]  mike adams continue getting into what this bill does to alternative care
[1:10:31.760 --> 1:10:35.520]  not just mainline care well this this bill is devastating to
[1:10:35.520 --> 1:10:40.400]  alternative care now it's because it excludes it so it doesn't have any
[1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:44.000]  provisions for covering chiropractic care for example
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:47.200]  or acupuncture or even nutritional medicine
[1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:51.520]  it doesn't do anything to help americans take care of their own health
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:55.040]  all that really accomplishes is trapping americans in a system
[1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:58.960]  of disease and sickness and bankruptcy this is the same system that is
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:02.160]  bankrupting states right now states like california
[1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:05.920]  this is a the same system that's bankrupting families and corporations
[1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:09.440]  i mean half the reason we're losing so many jobs to overseas companies
[1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:13.120]  is because our us corporations can't afford
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:16.960]  the health care because it's really sick care it's disease care
[1:11:16.960 --> 1:11:20.720]  and now with this new legislation it's going to become even less
[1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:24.800]  affordable i mean what an eight percent payroll tax on companies that
[1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:29.200]  that that can't or don't provide a system of health insurance that the
[1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:33.600]  government wants you know so more jobs are going to go overseas
[1:11:33.600 --> 1:11:38.320]  this just this is more of a job loss in america
[1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:42.000]  this is going to harm our economy even more and it's going to cost
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:47.520]  believe me tens of trillions of dollars in lost economic productivity and
[1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:52.720]  extra cost over the next decade tens of trillions of dollars
[1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:59.360]  well break down specifically why you're so concerned about this
[1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:04.880]  well look our system does not work as it is i'm look i'm all for reform alex
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:09.360]  we need real reform we need a system that helps americans be healthy
[1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:12.640]  like you but we have compassion for our fellow americans
[1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:16.480]  we want people to have less suffering we want people to be healthier
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:20.720]  more productive so they live longer and they can they can earn more money and
[1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:24.160]  because their their brains are working well they have good cognitive function
[1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:27.760]  and they're actually paying more taxes into the tax base to to
[1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:30.800]  you know to help fund those things that do need to be funded but
[1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:36.720]  but that's not what's happening in this bill it is enforcing sick care it is
[1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:41.520]  taxing people who have chosen to take care of their health and try to stay
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:45.520]  outside the system for example i don't have health insurance alex
[1:12:45.520 --> 1:12:49.040]  and many americans who are taking care of their health have chosen not to have
[1:12:49.040 --> 1:12:51.920]  health insurance well that's another great point i mean let's say you're
[1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:56.240]  35 40 years old you're in great shape you've got a savings account
[1:12:56.240 --> 1:12:59.680]  you don't want to have to go buy health insurance that's why the insurance
[1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:03.920]  company lobbies wrote the bill and then they played this propaganda piece about
[1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:08.400]  how they were against the bill in the media so they wouldn't get the heat on
[1:13:08.400 --> 1:13:11.760]  them because of the public figures out the health insurance
[1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:15.680]  industry wrote this to make 35 to 40 million americans
[1:13:15.680 --> 1:13:19.840]  buy their overpriced crap to go get their dangerous health care
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:22.720]  if the public ever finds that out they're going to understand
[1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:26.960]  this isn't just a wealth transference uh to the poor people
[1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:31.360]  it's a wealth transference to the elite and a total takeover of our lives
[1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:36.080]  how in a free society can the government make you go buy health care
[1:13:36.080 --> 1:13:40.640]  how are they going to make uh people like christian scientist
[1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:43.600]  who don't believe in mainline health care get health care how are they going
[1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:47.120]  to make people who are scared of hospitals who've almost died in them
[1:13:47.120 --> 1:13:51.680]  of infections and and and the wrong drugs i mean i'm scared of hospitals
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:56.080]  how are they going to make you go i mean this is just total tyranny
[1:13:56.080 --> 1:14:00.560]  well it is and this is the difference between conventional medicine versus
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:04.240]  alternative medicine or holistic medicine in the world of alternative and
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:07.840]  holistic medicine we believe in free choice that everybody
[1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:12.560]  should have their choice all parents they can choose vaccines if they want
[1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:15.440]  but they should also have the right to choose no vaccine
[1:14:15.440 --> 1:14:18.560]  for their children but conventional medicine that is
[1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:22.560]  pharmaceutical medicine does not believe in your right to choose anything
[1:14:22.560 --> 1:14:26.080]  they believe that if you disagree with them you should be arrested at gun
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:29.280]  point you should have your children taken away from you by child protected
[1:14:29.280 --> 1:14:33.680]  services you should be forced to have a chemotherapy injection in your veins
[1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:37.760]  by a court order because you disagree with their scientists who are all paid
[1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:40.640]  off by big pharma in the first place i mean this
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:44.080]  this is the key philosophical difference between conventional medicine
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:48.160]  and natural medicine and that's why the entire natural medicine community
[1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:51.760]  is just up in arms over this this legislation right now this
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:56.560]  is a medical dictatorship that we're now facing
[1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:03.840]  well we're not joking about this this is not rhetoric
[1:15:03.840 --> 1:15:07.280]  you were on hold earlier did you hear me read over
[1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:10.720]  16 of the taxes and and that's only the beginning
[1:15:10.720 --> 1:15:15.200]  that are in this bill excise tax on high-cost employer sponsored
[1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:18.560]  health coverage but then the big labor unions are exempt
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:22.720]  40 tax if people want to get a nice health care plan
[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:26.640]  where there's no deductible you spend $8,500 a year
[1:15:26.640 --> 1:15:31.200]  and the IRS can arbitrarily change this uh
[1:15:31.200 --> 1:15:35.680]  then for your whole family then they're going to give you a 40 percent tax so
[1:15:35.680 --> 1:15:37.680]  they're saying you can't have too good a care
[1:15:37.680 --> 1:15:41.520]  that's totally unconstitutional well it it's completely unaffordable
[1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:44.080]  i mean i don't know how american families are supposed to be able to pay for
[1:15:44.080 --> 1:15:48.080]  this and frankly the only reason that many people can
[1:15:48.080 --> 1:15:52.160]  afford to buy organic produce or to buy health foods or nutritional
[1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:54.880]  supplements the things that are keeping them healthy
[1:15:54.880 --> 1:15:58.160]  the only reason that they can afford that is because they're not putting their
[1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:01.680]  money into health insurance you know a thousand dollars a month
[1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:05.920]  that you're not spending on on health insurance goes a long way towards buying
[1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:09.200]  healthy food they keep you healthy and keep you out of the hospital
[1:16:09.200 --> 1:16:12.480]  and keep you from getting the flu in the first place
[1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:16.880]  so now they're going to take away this this discretionary income from people
[1:16:16.880 --> 1:16:20.640]  they're going to leave people stuck in a cycle where the only thing that they
[1:16:20.640 --> 1:16:23.520]  can afford is processed genetically modified
[1:16:23.520 --> 1:16:28.080]  corn made processed food and that's going to cause even more disease
[1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:32.640]  but this is a disaster for the health of americans
[1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:35.520]  well that's another point when we talked about it briefly earlier the
[1:16:35.520 --> 1:16:38.480]  government knows they're putting hundreds of dangerous chemicals
[1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:41.760]  under the name of sodium fluoride in the water they know it's hurting people
[1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:44.720]  they know the vaccines are hurting people
[1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:48.160]  they know that
[1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:53.520]  that they want to reduce our population they've stated we're living too long
[1:16:53.520 --> 1:16:55.600]  tom dashill who originally wrote the bill
[1:16:55.600 --> 1:16:58.800]  wrote in his book that old people have a duty to die
[1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:03.840]  and that europeans understand this uh once they get us all collectivized now
[1:17:03.840 --> 1:17:08.720]  they can play us off old against young young against old alternative medicine
[1:17:08.720 --> 1:17:12.240]  against mainline traditional medicine uh they can
[1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:15.440]  now regulate how much salt you use how much meat you eat
[1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:20.400]  they're openly saying now that they're going to have comparative care
[1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:23.120]  and under that term the government is going to decide
[1:17:23.120 --> 1:17:26.320]  what test you get what medical procedures you get and that they're
[1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:30.720]  going to quote save health care cost by cutting medicare and medicaid
[1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:35.200]  so all this does is cut the quality of medicare and medicaid
[1:17:35.200 --> 1:17:38.160]  and then put more people on medicare and medicaid
[1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:41.920]  uh who can't afford insurance but then those that are right on the line
[1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:44.320]  who are making twenty thirty thousand dollars a year
[1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:47.600]  they are forced to buy overpriced health insurance i mean
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:51.200]  this is outrageous and this is why the physicians
[1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:54.880]  don't like this either because the physicians know that medicare
[1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:59.120]  and medicaid are the worst payers they they pay late
[1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:02.320]  they discount what they pay doctors more and more clinics
[1:18:02.320 --> 1:18:06.240]  are refusing to even take medicare and medicaid because it just doesn't make
[1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:08.800]  sense for the doctors and the health providers
[1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:11.280]  so you're going to end up with a situation here alex
[1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:15.040]  where you have all these americans now forced to be put on medicare or
[1:18:15.040 --> 1:18:17.760]  medicaid and they're not going to be able to find a doctor
[1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:21.200]  and they're going to be treated the way our veterans have been treated too often
[1:18:21.200 --> 1:18:24.720]  in our veterans hospitals and this this makes me very angry
[1:18:24.720 --> 1:18:28.320]  that our our veterans of world war two and then vietnam and
[1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:32.160]  more recent actions they are treated like
[1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:36.480]  third world citizens almost in our own hospitals by our own government
[1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:40.720]  they're not given the medical care i saw a patient with my own eyes
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:44.880]  being given surgery in a closet in a veteran's hospital
[1:18:44.880 --> 1:18:48.640]  i mean it wasn't even a sterile room this is the kind of stuff that goes on
[1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:53.120]  and it's going to now get worse in effect mainstream american families
[1:18:53.120 --> 1:18:56.720]  because we the physicians just won't have
[1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:01.040]  anything to do with the system if they can help it
[1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:05.600]  mike how do we defeat this how do we turn this around
[1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:10.000]  well i don't have all the answers but this isn't just about health care
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:14.720]  this is about the shift towards fascism you know the
[1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:18.480]  health care this this health care legislation is just a symptom
[1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:22.720]  i think of a bigger problem in my opinion we've got to get back to
[1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:25.600]  taking back our freedoms you know peacefully
[1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:29.280]  democratically i'm not the kind of person who who advocates
[1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:33.040]  violence but i think that we do have to stand up and have the courage
[1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:35.920]  to take back the freedoms that we are supposed to be guaranteed in this
[1:19:35.920 --> 1:19:39.440]  country and those freedoms include freedom of religion freedom of speech
[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:43.440]  and obviously the freedom to choose whatever system of health care that we
[1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:46.000]  want to choose
[1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:50.480]  mike adam stay there we're going to come back and get into some more facets
[1:19:50.480 --> 1:19:54.000]  of this legislation and i've got my own ideas of how to defeat it

[1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:18.960]  into this house we're born
[1:24:18.960 --> 1:24:26.240]  into this world we're thrown like a dog without a bone and
[1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:32.960]  after all riders on the store we are back live ladies and gentlemen thank you
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:37.040]  for joining us
[1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:42.080]  obama has now signed the house bill the senate is supposedly going to make
[1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:46.640]  more changes and then it'll just be law and then obama says he'll slap an
[1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:49.760]  executive order on it barring federal money for abortion
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:53.280]  that's another red herring as ron paul has spoken about they send the money to
[1:24:53.280 --> 1:24:57.040]  the hospitals or plant parenthood and then they use the federal money on one
[1:24:57.040 --> 1:24:59.920]  issue and then move that other money they would have spent
[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:04.000]  on abortions or on the other issue over two abortions
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:07.360]  and congressional law trumps executive order
[1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:10.320]  going back to mike adams mike in the few minutes we've got left with them
[1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:15.360]  we're coming back with calls people are in denial out there
[1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:20.800]  i saw the toronto star two weeks ago with the headline government orders
[1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:27.040]  pharmacies and health food shops not to sell supplements anymore
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:30.640]  and no law no they just said we'll arrest you if you do
[1:25:30.640 --> 1:25:34.640]  and listed was fish oil vitamin c malaluco oil
[1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:39.520]  everything uh mccain's bill would have tried this i mean they're really
[1:25:39.520 --> 1:25:42.640]  coming after us and it was bizarre cast sunstein
[1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:47.440]  said ban 9 11 conspiracy theories ban man made global warming theories if you
[1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:50.000]  don't believe it's man made you should be arrested or find
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:54.320]  he also said it's conspiracy theory if you believe moderate sunlight is good
[1:25:54.320 --> 1:25:57.280]  and that should be banned they know sunlight
[1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:03.120]  is is is literally magic and why are they so scared of sunlight
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:06.880]  because sunlight's free and when you get sunlight your risks
[1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:11.600]  of cancer drop by almost 80 percent that is if you have sufficient levels of
[1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:14.720]  vitamin d you can prevent almost four out of five
[1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:17.840]  cancers of all types and then you add the vitamin c and you're
[1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:22.480]  you're protected well yes and and and vitamin d also
[1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:25.840]  protects you against osteoporosis diabetes heart disease
[1:26:25.840 --> 1:26:29.600]  depression i mean these are the main areas of revenue
[1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:33.360]  and diabetes is up what 3000 percent in the last 20 years
[1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:36.720]  people were drinking the same amount of corn syrup then i mean people aren't
[1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:41.280]  getting sunlight but that's it we we are sunlight deficient in this nation
[1:26:41.280 --> 1:26:44.640]  but the the important reason why they're going after sunlight is because
[1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:48.480]  sunlight doesn't require a prescription so you don't need a physician
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:53.040]  to heal yourself by walking in the sun and so they put a 10 percent tax on
[1:26:53.040 --> 1:26:56.640]  any type of lamps or anything that gives you artificial sun
[1:26:56.640 --> 1:26:59.280]  despite all the northern european studies showing
[1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:02.640]  you don't just physically need it mentally you need sunlight
[1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:07.840]  that's right this this is the secret of the tanning industry they can't claim
[1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:11.440]  that their beds help your body generate vitamin d and therefore prevent
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:15.040]  disease but medically it's absolutely true that they do
[1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:18.160]  now you know i'm not saying go out and try yourself under the sun
[1:27:18.160 --> 1:27:22.400]  you need good nutrition to prevent sunburn sunburn is actually
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:26.240]  typically caused by a lack of antioxidants in your skin
[1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:30.000]  and when you boost your nutritional intake you'll have
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:33.520]  more resistance to sunburn and you'll generate more vitamin look look look
[1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:36.960]  it's simple europeans have white skin
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:44.000]  and uh blue eyes this is scientific fact to absorb light the brain needs it
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:48.320]  through the eyes ladies and gentlemen uh the body needs it
[1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:52.320]  that's why people who get too much sun near the equator have black skin
[1:27:52.320 --> 1:27:55.840]  to protect them away from the sun white skin
[1:27:55.840 --> 1:27:59.680]  to absorb it so yes white people don't need to be out
[1:27:59.680 --> 1:28:04.560]  frying in the sun uh but they've done studies with black people that don't get
[1:28:04.560 --> 1:28:08.240]  sun get even higher rates of cancer because it becomes fashionable to have
[1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:11.200]  lighter skin no white people are supposed to be
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:13.600]  light brown and black people are supposed to be black
[1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:17.280]  we need the sun well right if you take an african-american
[1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:21.680]  and you put them in an indoor environment you know working in an office all day
[1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:25.200]  long especially in a north at a northern latitude like in
[1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:28.560]  chicago for example they are almost certainly going to be
[1:28:28.560 --> 1:28:31.920]  vitamin d deficient and they're going to have very aggressive cancer either
[1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:35.520]  breast or prostate cancer and the cancer industry knows that
[1:28:35.520 --> 1:28:39.040]  and they know that that's their best revenue stream and they won't tell
[1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:41.920]  african-americans to get vitamin d because they know
[1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:45.040]  that they're going to make more money off of these people if they keep us all
[1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:48.720]  nutritionally ignorant that's what they're trying to do to keep us all
[1:28:48.720 --> 1:28:51.920]  ignorant white people black people hispanics everybody
[1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:56.800]  that's their agenda absolutely well mike we're going to have you back on soon
[1:28:56.800 --> 1:29:00.640]  to break more of this down but hard to believe they got it
[1:29:00.640 --> 1:29:04.560]  passed and hard to believe it's as bad as any version previously
[1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:07.680]  i mean this bill we're still digesting and it is just
[1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:11.600]  unbelievably horrible are you excited though to see massive resistance and to
[1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:16.800]  see people waking up because of this yes i am and i think this is going to be
[1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:20.880]  the battleground of states rights versus federal tyranny

[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:18.800]  at once and the democrats think you're stupid and won't stay angry and won't
[1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:21.760]  stay focused we're going to change that we're
[1:39:21.760 --> 1:39:25.280]  going to lay out the true players and what really happened here
[1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:28.880]  this is not just collectivism and taking rich people or wealthy people or
[1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:32.240]  middle class people's money to give some poor people health care
[1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:36.320]  this is worse than what europe has we're going to break it down
[1:39:36.320 --> 1:39:42.640]  let's go to richard in neb i don't know what that means i guess that's nebraska
[1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:50.080]  richard go ahead i i just had a question or comment on i i was a
[1:39:50.080 --> 1:39:53.840]  truly outraged about the vitamin aspect of it
[1:39:53.840 --> 1:39:57.120]  and i was i was thinking there's no way that
[1:39:57.120 --> 1:40:01.920]  it would sort of defeat itself or reverse itself like it
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:08.400]  did about 20 or 20 some years ago when they first had the how you call it
[1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:12.720]  insurance companies would have people call in
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:17.200]  for to see if they got could go to the hospital or
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:20.320]  if they were covered under some things and then it
[1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:23.440]  in how you call it people who were pregnant
[1:40:23.440 --> 1:40:28.160]  got only one day and instead of three or something until it's
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:32.000]  sort of self-defeated itself after three days but then
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:35.600]  the more i'm hearing you about it the more it sounds like it's going to
[1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:40.320]  they're going to try and put a try and put a lock on
[1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:45.760]  on us so defeat uh defeating people wanting to use vitamins and stuff like
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:51.280]  richard i appreciate your call look this has comparative medicine language
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:56.000]  where the federal government and the irs decide
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:59.680]  what and once the laws pass they're giving blanket power
[1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:02.960]  what type of health care you can get it's not just vitamins if your doctor
[1:41:02.960 --> 1:41:06.320]  wants to prescribe them to them then that's not paid for by your government
[1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:09.920]  insurance or by your private insurance this is everything the insurance
[1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:13.840]  companies ever wanted to deny people care this is
[1:41:13.840 --> 1:41:17.600]  everything they ever pushed for to lower the quality of care and quote
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:21.760]  lower prices it's just so unspeakably bad
[1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:24.240]  george in connecticut you're on the air
[1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:27.920]  hi uh yeah i'm really depressed over this thing too but
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:31.680]  i'm wondering uh what happens if we we put together
[1:41:31.680 --> 1:41:35.520]  a bill of rights type thing for the republicans that they have to repeal
[1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:39.040]  this thing entirely and get every republican to sign on or some sort of
[1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:42.400]  absolutely i'm going to write that down i hadn't thought of that we need a
[1:41:42.400 --> 1:41:46.240]  citizen pledge written up that is hardcore
[1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:49.360]  that they all swear to sign on to because the insurance companies run the
[1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:53.200]  republican leadership they're going to come in and just change a few things
[1:41:53.200 --> 1:41:56.880]  you watch we know we need this whole and we don't need to count
[1:41:56.880 --> 1:42:00.320]  we need to to attack on every front we need to have
[1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:05.280]  the states pass laws the states sue we need to have congressmen go in and have
[1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:09.520]  investigations we need to point out that insurance companies
[1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:12.880]  lobbied for this that's the big secret they don't want people to know
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:16.880]  that the insurance companies wrote this to make you pay them money
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:21.440]  and the insurance companies need to be sued for for their involvement this is
[1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:25.280]  racketeering second point i would thought of what
[1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:29.200]  about um putting through the state that every
[1:42:29.200 --> 1:42:34.000]  legislature that goes to to congress whether a congressman or senator
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.960]  has to sign on that he has to he has to sign
[1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:40.960]  every point that that's different from the bill for example if they stick in
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:44.800]  something like uh you can't have vitamins they have to sign on yeah that's a
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:48.240]  read the bill act and and and they've been trying to pass that at the federal
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:51.440]  level most of these congressmen never even look at the
[1:42:51.440 --> 1:42:55.680]  bills they're literally written by the lobbyist
[1:42:55.680 --> 1:42:59.200]  but uh but what i'm really getting at what the real point of it is that i'd
[1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:02.720]  like to see is maybe put an act in every state
[1:43:02.720 --> 1:43:05.840]  if they haven't read these bills they're retroactively
[1:43:05.840 --> 1:43:12.720]  vote no and void until they sign that we re it re uh what do you call it vote on
[1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:16.160]  it so that they have to be uh read over and every
[1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:19.680]  point has to be brought to the if the people generally don't like these
[1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:23.040]  bills they have to be given to the states and they have to ratify it through
[1:43:23.040 --> 1:43:26.960]  the people's uh you know like a proposition type of situation
[1:43:26.960 --> 1:43:30.720]  that way it would force them to either read the bills and really have things
[1:43:30.720 --> 1:43:34.000]  that people want or they'd have to put it on a proposition and then they could
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:37.200]  they couldn't uh sneak this thing through and the other thing is they
[1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:41.920]  should not be allowed to uh vote on any bill that they have not
[1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:45.840]  at least fully read and initialed everything because then they couldn't
[1:43:45.840 --> 1:43:48.560]  keep re sneaking in these bills at the last minute
[1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:51.360]  and think oh well i didn't read the bill i didn't read the bill i really didn't
[1:43:51.360 --> 1:43:55.360]  know what was in it good point george i appreciate your
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:43:58.320]  call let's talk to phil in ohio phil you're on the
[1:43:58.320 --> 1:44:05.760]  air hi alex yes first off sir god bless you
[1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:13.120]  god bless you i uh i admire you uh i'm 66 and i know your time is valuable i
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:17.840]  want to be brief but the reason i bring my age into it
[1:44:17.840 --> 1:44:21.920]  i've been opposing big government since the 70s
[1:44:21.920 --> 1:44:27.760]  um i was i am in the john birch society and our get us out of the un
[1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:31.680]  campaign i'm sure you're old enough to be aware of that
[1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:36.160]  yes but what i wanted to tie in with his health care
[1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:41.280]  my oldest daughter had breast cancer and one of the things that i learned
[1:44:41.280 --> 1:44:45.520]  about in the birch society when i first began
[1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:49.600]  was lay a trail uh a natural
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:54.880]  cure for cancer for many people i myself knew of uh
[1:44:54.880 --> 1:45:01.840]  three survivors that had cancer disappear entirely with lay a trail
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:07.120]  but my point is i think and and i need your opinion
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:12.800]  one of one of the ideas that i've had and i wanted to ask you
[1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:20.560]  um where ron paul's legislation is on auditing the federal reserve
[1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:26.640]  okay it passed the house it's in the u.s senate and it's gaining sponsors
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:30.400]  and we need to continue to not just focus on the republicans and democrats
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:33.920]  as being the source of our woes but actually look at the real private
[1:45:33.920 --> 1:45:38.320]  banking structure that wants control of all of our revenue streams
[1:45:38.320 --> 1:45:42.640]  that's why there's now taxes on individuals investment scores of new
[1:45:42.640 --> 1:45:46.400]  taxes increase in capital gains you name it
[1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:52.240]  on everybody uh in this and it's just so monstrous i appreciate your call
[1:45:52.240 --> 1:45:57.280]  phil let's talk to scott in washington scott you're on the air
[1:45:57.280 --> 1:46:02.480]  yeah alex uh i'd like to expose one of the ways one of the propaganda angles
[1:46:02.480 --> 1:46:06.160]  that they're now trying to come at it with and i actually took on one of
[1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:10.880]  these so-called phony talk show hosts who's an edge shows protege
[1:46:10.880 --> 1:46:14.160]  about now that they're running around here saying that now that the bill is
[1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:18.480]  law that just accepted he was running around here yipping about
[1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:22.560]  uh the federal government has so much rights under the commerce clause the
[1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:26.640]  mandate people and that state law trumps uh
[1:46:26.640 --> 1:46:30.640]  uh a federal law the federal government has no business saying you've got to
[1:46:30.640 --> 1:46:35.120]  buy something from a private interest it's outrageously illegal
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:39.360]  they say yeah no it's law you got to go along with it as if a citizen doesn't
[1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:42.000]  have a right to be against something once something's
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:45.360]  law exactly and i called this guy up so
[1:46:45.360 --> 1:46:49.840]  i challenged him he's supposed to be a so-called legal analyst and i told him
[1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:55.840]  i said okay you name one uh case one precedent in all the 200 years where the
[1:46:55.840 --> 1:46:59.520]  federal government has ever mandated anyone to purchase anything from any
[1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:04.080]  federal any company before he goes off into this song and dance about
[1:47:04.080 --> 1:47:07.360]  three different cases about them regulating stuff about something about
[1:47:07.360 --> 1:47:12.480]  marijuana and all that and i said look sir uh regulation is one thing we're not
[1:47:12.480 --> 1:47:17.200]  talking about regulation we're talking about mandates well i can't name any
[1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:21.920]  what do you want me to do lie like i'm a republican exactly we know what made
[1:47:21.920 --> 1:47:26.640]  america great and this is the opposite this is all
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:30.880]  new look they picked carbon to tax and carbon to oxide
[1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:34.480]  because everybody puts it off every industry releases it
[1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:37.920]  humans exhale it it's good they don't want to
[1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:41.040]  actually stop anything environmental that's bad
[1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:44.880]  they want the broadest tax to control all human activity
[1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:48.000]  they want to run your health care they want to run your states they want to
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:51.440]  control your vitamins they want to have your kids in the schools being brought
[1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:55.280]  up by them this is a total takeover i appreciate your
[1:47:55.280 --> 1:47:59.280]  call scott good points of course he couldn't give you an example
[1:47:59.280 --> 1:48:04.400]  but now they have their precedent now they're going to try more of this
[1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:10.480]  we have a lawless government ladies and gentlemen
[1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:14.080]  i mean we have real conservatives like ran paul
[1:48:14.080 --> 1:48:19.200]  ten points ahead in kentucky to be a u.s senator
[1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:23.440]  he'll audit the fed he'll get rid of this health care he'll vote against it
[1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:27.760]  it'll set a precedent for others to run so the republican party is coming out
[1:48:27.760 --> 1:48:31.920]  against him to beat him even though he's ten
[1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:35.520]  points ahead of the republican and more than ten points ahead of the
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:41.680]  democrat and now the guy they've got is a republican
[1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:45.920]  running against him and i'm going to cover this
[1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:49.920]  coming up the guy they've got running against him is the head of the election
[1:48:49.920 --> 1:48:54.800]  commission in the state and and and the the commission has said yes
[1:48:54.800 --> 1:48:58.160]  you can be the head of the kentucky elections and run
[1:48:58.160 --> 1:49:03.520]  yourself and run the election and have your employees that are set
[1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:07.680]  to get jobs for you in the u.s senate you can run the election when you're
[1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:10.720]  running against ran paul
[1:49:12.160 --> 1:49:15.520]  see that's my biggest criticism of the republicans
[1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:19.440]  is they were for the patriot act they were for illegal preemptive
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:22.560]  wars of aggression they were for tripling the size of government
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:26.000]  therefore all this corporate welfare to the pentagon and to the defense
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:29.440]  contractors trillions a year
[1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:34.560]  they're all for warrantless wiretapping the democrats were against it when they
[1:49:34.560 --> 1:49:37.360]  were out of power now they're in power they're all for it
[1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:40.480]  because they all work for the same people and the republicans that are
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:44.160]  against this health care bill now the leadership
[1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:49.200]  the lindsay graham types when they're in power
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:53.440]  in the next few years they're going to be for it you
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:56.640]  watch oh they'll change a few things but it'll be the same
[1:49:56.640 --> 1:50:01.600]  it's like newt gingrich and uh john mccain say global warming's real
[1:50:01.600 --> 1:50:07.200]  they want the taxes all the republican leadership are a bunch of scum
[1:50:07.200 --> 1:50:11.920]  and that's why they're going out against rand paul ron paul's son in kentucky
[1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:14.640]  and they they've written big editorials that we've read here on air
[1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:19.840]  well they're like oh my god if rand wins it's over for us neocons
[1:50:19.840 --> 1:50:25.440]  who were a bunch of trotskyites trotsky's people came over to the us on record
[1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:29.280]  and set up the the major republican party
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:34.720]  cia controlled uh head of the national review william f buckley as a young man
[1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:38.160]  was hired by the cia to come out and criticize
[1:50:38.160 --> 1:50:43.280]  conservative republicans very goldwater types
[1:50:43.280 --> 1:50:46.720]  to then take over the republican party with the trotskyites
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:50.960]  trotsky's top lieutenant
[1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:54.160]  it's just so incredible william crystals dad
[1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:58.000]  and it's the same scum today so if you don't remove them
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:03.120]  none of this gets changed you understand hi this is alex jones did you know
[1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:06.720]  that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[1:51:06.720 --> 1:51:09.920]  vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[1:51:09.920 --> 1:51:13.120]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold
[1:51:13.120 --> 1:51:16.400]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country
[1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:18.720]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:22.480]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:26.240]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank
[1:51:26.240 --> 1:51:29.920]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[1:51:29.920 --> 1:51:33.200]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[1:51:33.200 --> 1:51:37.120]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a

[1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:14.400]  I'm going to talk about solutions coming up in the next hour
[1:54:14.400 --> 1:54:19.280]  Joe Biden got caught cussing right before he introduced
[1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:24.800]  Obama he spoke first minutes before they signed the treacherous treasonous bill
[1:54:24.800 --> 1:54:30.720]  and as Obama came up to the stage he said this is a big
[1:54:30.720 --> 1:54:34.400]  effing deal and shook his hand we've got the video we're not going to play it on
[1:54:34.400 --> 1:54:36.800]  the radio play cuss words we're going to beep out
[1:54:36.800 --> 1:54:42.240]  the effing part but we're going to play this on air coming up the next hour
[1:54:42.240 --> 1:54:45.840]  and it's the celebration yes we can yes we did
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:49.120]  we're going to run your life we're going to tell you how much insurance you're
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:51.760]  going to have we're going to make you give money to private industry
[1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:56.240]  that wrote this we're going to decide what type of health care you get
[1:54:56.240 --> 1:54:59.600]  and now coming up they are going to try to ram
[1:54:59.600 --> 1:55:03.600]  through the greenhouse gas tax bill they know they can't do it
[1:55:03.600 --> 1:55:07.280]  through executive order they're trying now they're going to try to pass this
[1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:10.480]  because hell it's already so unpopular why not
[1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:15.200]  and the house has already passed it I mean we're in a lot of trouble ladies and
[1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:19.280]  gentlemen and remember the republican party leadership
[1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:24.080]  is for this remember they're just as big an enemy as the democrats
[1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:27.680]  but if we get into a partisan debate they can divide us across those lines
[1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:31.200]  you got to reach out to the idiot democrats and idiot republicans out
[1:55:31.200 --> 1:55:33.280]  there that still think their party represents them
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:38.000]  the good news is harry reid has an 8 percent approval rating in gallup poll
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:44.240]  the congress has a 10 percent Pelosi has an 11 percent
[1:55:44.240 --> 1:55:51.600]  these are lawless dirt bag scum oh it just I'm so angry I can barely do this
[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:55.920]  show today I mean I am just I have children folks I know what
[1:55:55.920 --> 1:55:59.280]  tyranny is I know how almost every other country in the world has fallen to
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:02.640]  tyranny I know this is a giant scam and it's only
[1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:06.000]  the beginning our country shutting down we've got 22
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:09.920]  percent unemployment the banks are raping us in every other major nation
[1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:13.920]  we're going to end up like Argentina or Nigeria or Greece
[1:56:13.920 --> 1:56:17.200]  we've got to be like Iceland and say no to these people
[1:56:17.200 --> 1:56:21.120]  it's the banks running the country and they've got a new way to taxes
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:24.560]  and a whole bunch of new taxes they just passed but that's not even
[1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:28.480]  as bad as the IRS running your medical records and deciding what treatments you
[1:56:28.480 --> 1:56:32.160]  can get that is in the bill they tax you if you get
[1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:35.600]  treatments they say you don't need
[1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:47.440]  it's so horrible and all the states are passing new taxes
[1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:51.600]  America has got to get serious America has got to wake up
[1:56:51.600 --> 1:56:54.880]  the VA is the only government run healthcare in this country and it's
[1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:57.920]  the worst on the planet you're going to get the equivalent of VA
[1:56:57.920 --> 1:56:59.840]  healthcare that's what the insurance companies want
[1:56:59.840 --> 1:57:04.320]  they get to have the government set what the care is now and give you crap
[1:57:04.320 --> 1:57:08.000]  and protect them from all the liability lawsuits from people who don't get the
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:13.840]  right care under their insurance i'm sorry i'm sorry
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:16.640]  you ever get so angry that you don't eat you're not even mad you just have a
[1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:19.840]  headache and the way they're celebrating and
[1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:24.160]  laughing and biden that little gangster criminal thug

[1:57:31.440 --> 1:57:34.880]  lawsuits we want everything attack them on every front
[1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:41.600]  get up off your butts and make the republican talk show hosts quit lying
[1:57:41.600 --> 1:57:44.640]  and saying every day that insurance companies don't make that much money
[1:57:44.640 --> 1:57:47.120]  and aren't corrupt they wrote the stinking thing
[1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:52.480]  they're not free market they make money off making you buy this stuff

[2:00:28.320 --> 2:00:31.760]  30 of the public or so are useful idiots who think they're about to get
[2:00:31.760 --> 2:00:34.960]  something free now they'll wonder why they can't get jobs and go on
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:40.320]  welfare to see the criminals celebrating and

[2:00:44.080 --> 2:00:47.520]  makes me become extremely angry and that's normal that's
[2:00:47.520 --> 2:00:51.440]  natural when ut loses a football game

[2:01:24.480 --> 2:01:28.080]  but it's a normal response to have the government
[2:01:28.080 --> 2:01:30.800]  take over your health care and tell you what type of health care you can have
[2:01:30.800 --> 2:01:35.360]  and who you got to buy it from this is worse than europe socialism this is
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:39.600]  rapism this is scamism this is piracy this is fraud
[2:01:39.600 --> 2:01:42.640]  this is robbery
[2:01:42.800 --> 2:01:46.560]  and the way it was passed everything else it's just
[2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:49.920]  now i've had a chance to really read over the latest version the final version

[2:02:53.920 --> 2:02:57.840]  through and uh from progressing and he's only doing that trying to keep a
[2:02:57.840 --> 2:03:03.040]  senate seat he's a lion piece of filth exactly he's up against great odds out
[2:03:03.040 --> 2:03:06.400]  there against jd hayworth in arizona exactly jd hayworth
[2:03:06.400 --> 2:03:10.880]  isn't perfect but he's a million times better than john mccain
[2:03:10.880 --> 2:03:13.760]  and these guys will say anything they they have to say to
[2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:17.280]  re uh stay in power but john mccain you look at him

[2:07:57.120 --> 2:08:01.760]  this is alex jones for survivalseedbank.com
[2:08:02.800 --> 2:08:06.880]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[2:08:06.880 --> 2:08:10.640]  the information war continues it's alex jones
[2:08:10.640 --> 2:08:14.560]  and the gcn radio network
[2:08:15.360 --> 2:08:18.960]  all right i'm going to take some more of your phone calls responding to the
[2:08:18.960 --> 2:08:24.480]  looting the robbery the unconstitutional criminal takeover
[2:08:24.480 --> 2:08:31.200]  that is government care banker care insurance company robbery care
[2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:35.920]  but the biggest issue is framing this debate correctly
[2:08:35.920 --> 2:08:41.680]  the neocons have all been lying on talk radio and tv for the last year
[2:08:41.680 --> 2:08:46.240]  saying the insurance companies are good the big ones
[2:08:46.240 --> 2:08:49.600]  different animal from the small ones
[2:08:49.600 --> 2:08:55.200]  and that they're against this bill and the fake liberal media
[2:08:55.200 --> 2:09:02.000]  perpetuates this hoax in the paradigm saying that insurance companies are
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:05.040]  against it the insurance companies wrote it
[2:09:05.040 --> 2:09:09.920]  their stock is going up it makes 30 plus million people by their overpriced
[2:09:09.920 --> 2:09:13.440]  crud it has the feds setting with
[2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:16.720]  comparative care what type of procedure you can get
[2:09:16.720 --> 2:09:20.640]  what type of tests you can get it restricts alternative care
[2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:26.720]  this was written by big pharma and the health care industry
[2:09:27.360 --> 2:09:30.560]  they have screwed up our care they've used government
[2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:35.120]  tax money to pay for poor people to get medicare and medicaid
[2:09:35.120 --> 2:09:39.360]  if you'd have kept your tax money you'd have got a lot better care investing in
[2:09:39.360 --> 2:09:42.560]  they're getting a big domesticated group of people and filled with illegal
[2:09:42.560 --> 2:09:46.080]  aliens i should add to use as a political weapon
[2:09:46.080 --> 2:09:49.840]  against the population here are some of my ideas on solutions
[2:09:49.840 --> 2:09:52.560]  i'm going to get into these in more detail after some calls
[2:09:52.560 --> 2:09:55.760]  a lot of people are just going to dump their insurance as a protest before
[2:09:55.760 --> 2:09:59.280]  all this gets phased in the next year and a half
[2:09:59.280 --> 2:10:03.280]  because the taxes the forced insurance comes in the next year and a half
[2:10:03.280 --> 2:10:09.200]  then the supposed benefits start kicking in through 2018
[2:10:09.200 --> 2:10:13.040]  that way they can probably never even give the public some of the chicken feed
[2:10:13.040 --> 2:10:17.440]  and they'll probably repeal it by then this is just a giant tax
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:21.680]  and gets the irs involved in deciding what procedures you get
[2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:26.400]  that's in the bill i read it last hour now signed in the law
[2:10:26.400 --> 2:10:33.120]  that they will go into and find you if you spend money on health care that
[2:10:33.120 --> 2:10:37.920]  they don't agree with they will go in and take money out of your
[2:10:37.920 --> 2:10:42.400]  health care account that supposedly tax free because you invested
[2:10:42.400 --> 2:10:48.480]  after tax money in it so this is the top insurance companies with the top
[2:10:48.480 --> 2:10:52.880]  health companies and big pharma steering and controlling medicine
[2:10:52.880 --> 2:10:58.240]  that's what it does and i'll go back over that
[2:10:58.240 --> 2:11:01.680]  so a lot of people are going to dump their insurance in protest others
[2:11:01.680 --> 2:11:04.880]  are saying this is it they're not going to pay income tax anymore
[2:11:04.880 --> 2:11:10.960]  they're dropping off the grid that's why they've hired 16 to 20 000 new
[2:11:10.960 --> 2:11:15.280]  they're debating the number to go out and charge you with all these crimes now
[2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:19.600]  if you're caught working off the grid
[2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:23.840]  that's the big bonanza tens of millions of people that have to go buy insurance
[2:11:23.840 --> 2:11:28.720]  from these companies that wrote the bill we don't just want the states to sue
[2:11:28.720 --> 2:11:32.080]  we want the states to nullify and pass laws at the state level
[2:11:32.080 --> 2:11:35.440]  saying the feds can't operate this within our state we need the states to
[2:11:35.440 --> 2:11:39.200]  rebel and say we're going to start keeping our education money our highway
[2:11:39.200 --> 2:11:42.080]  funds you're not going to run our life anymore this is all
[2:11:42.080 --> 2:11:46.560]  unconstitutional not just this new outrage but all of it
[2:11:46.560 --> 2:11:52.000]  it's all bad and that's where the republicans have been a bunch of scum
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:55.840]  lindsay graham newt genrich all of them john mccain global warming's real we
[2:11:55.840 --> 2:11:59.840]  need this tax that takes over the industry
[2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:03.360]  lets the federal government selectively enforce unlimited power
[2:12:03.360 --> 2:12:06.720]  any company they want to find fear shut down any business
[2:12:06.720 --> 2:12:10.880]  home inspections now they're trying to pass that that's coming up
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:15.360]  it's all bad it's all unconstitutional the republicans have got what they like
[2:12:15.360 --> 2:12:19.760]  the democrats have got what they like and they all cover for each other
[2:12:19.760 --> 2:12:23.120]  when the republicans are out of power they pose as patriots
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:26.720]  then when they get in power the democrats pose as patriots and they leap
[2:12:26.720 --> 2:12:29.120]  frog
[2:12:29.440 --> 2:12:34.480]  their legs on the same ogre and they take a step forward a left foot a right
[2:12:34.480 --> 2:12:38.800]  foot they punch you with the left they punch you with the right
[2:12:38.800 --> 2:12:42.960]  let's start looking at the brain of the new world order the private banks jp
[2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:46.800]  morgan chase goldman sacks city bank
[2:12:46.800 --> 2:12:50.240]  wells fargo those are your private shareholders in the fellow reserve
[2:12:50.240 --> 2:12:53.680]  those are the criminals that wrote this stinking thing warren buffett out
[2:12:53.680 --> 2:12:57.040]  there promoting it that big fat degenerate eugenics
[2:12:57.040 --> 2:13:03.120]  planned parenthood piece of trash bill gates out pushing his vaccines to
[2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:07.440]  quote cut population a Freudian slip

[2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:21.200]  doubling the amount of abortion funding worldwide making you pay for abortions
[2:13:21.200 --> 2:13:23.840]  in this bill and telling you obama is going to sign an
[2:13:23.840 --> 2:13:27.680]  executive order they're already for decades been using
[2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:31.520]  federal funds for abortions it comes into the hospital or clinic
[2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:35.920]  and they take money that they were going to spend on another program they use
[2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:38.320]  the federal money on that and then take that money
[2:13:38.320 --> 2:13:42.960]  and use it on the abortions it's a shell game
[2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:48.960]  hey some of you may love abortion you may want to get one every few months you
[2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:51.680]  like it you don't think it's a human you're dehumanized

[2:14:01.440 --> 2:14:05.360]  killing black people is what you do for the brothers because you're down

[2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:42.480]  he's a fake but again it doesn't matter it's it's about them training us that
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:45.520]  we don't get an american citizen as a president it's about them training us
[2:14:45.520 --> 2:14:49.120]  that he can become the head of the un totally illegal under the constitution
[2:14:49.120 --> 2:14:53.200]  i cover it and fall the republic it's about them training that that they can

[2:33:16.880 --> 2:33:20.720]  countries like ours a new world order no world order
[2:33:20.720 --> 2:33:24.480]  that elevates one nation or group of people over another
[2:33:24.480 --> 2:33:28.800]  will succeed and to phrase it out and use myself that we needed a new world
[2:33:28.800 --> 2:33:32.000]  order so it's going to be an inner ruling elite
[2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:35.600]  and then everyone else and i got news for you
[2:33:35.600 --> 2:33:39.040]  you're everyone else the whole concept of new world order is
[2:33:39.040 --> 2:33:43.040]  something else it really says that the state is god you take
[2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:46.720]  the roots of that organization and you find out that they created in all of
[2:33:46.720 --> 2:33:51.440]  the british dependents uh what they call round table group
[2:33:51.440 --> 2:33:55.040]  then around those little round table groups they created front group
[2:33:55.040 --> 2:33:58.720]  we're getting to two levels of government here one level of government
[2:33:58.720 --> 2:34:02.720]  where we have checks and balances and a higher level
[2:34:02.720 --> 2:34:07.920]  of cog government where the constitutional authorities are not allowed to go
[2:34:07.920 --> 2:34:11.680]  back then it wasn't politically wise to be aligned with what his party's right
[2:34:11.680 --> 2:34:15.680]  wing considered a shadow world government the new world order really is a
[2:34:15.680 --> 2:34:18.640]  tool for addressing a new world of possibilities
[2:34:18.640 --> 2:34:23.120]  this is the third leg of the new world order that's why it's important
[2:34:23.120 --> 2:34:26.880]  the people running this country are determined
[2:34:26.880 --> 2:34:32.000]  to destroy it invisible empire a new world order defined
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:37.120]  pre-order it on dvd now it ships out on or before april 15 those that order now

[2:34:40.400 --> 2:34:44.800]  into our treasury to run the radio show the news websites all the guests
[2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:48.960]  the congressional and state candidates we support here this is a platform
[2:34:48.960 --> 2:34:53.680]  a firebase and resistance against the enemy and make no mistake you've got to
[2:34:53.680 --> 2:34:57.600]  realize that this isn't rhetoric when we talk about the type of criminals running
[2:34:57.600 --> 2:35:00.480]  our government Stalin killed 40 million
[2:35:00.480 --> 2:35:03.520]  mal killed over 60 million hitler tens of millions
[2:35:03.520 --> 2:35:06.880]  governments are run by abuse of scum when they go bad
[2:35:06.880 --> 2:35:12.720]  and they normally go bad look what thomas jefferson warns you about but the
[2:35:12.720 --> 2:35:17.200]  idea of liberty and freedom and humans running their own lives rugged
[2:35:17.200 --> 2:35:21.680]  individualism is the truth and no army can stop an idea whose
[2:35:21.680 --> 2:35:25.120]  time has come the people are waking up they are angry
[2:35:25.120 --> 2:35:28.000]  and the globalists are ramming all this through even though it's unpopular
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:31.280]  and i'm gonna go back to your calls and into solutions but i want to say this
[2:35:31.280 --> 2:35:34.480]  right now it's okay to get a republican party
[2:35:34.480 --> 2:35:38.160]  platform texas has one that i could write
[2:35:38.160 --> 2:35:42.160]  they ignore the platform but it's good to make it even more hardcore
[2:35:42.160 --> 2:35:45.840]  we need to run people for state houses and demand
[2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:50.240]  that and when i say militarily block it i mean if they ever march troops into
[2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:53.520]  states trying to make people buy private
[2:35:53.520 --> 2:35:56.080]  insurance we need the sheriffs to escort them out
[2:35:56.080 --> 2:35:59.920]  we need to start standing up against this out of control
[2:35:59.920 --> 2:36:03.280]  what is north com set up what is the john warner defense authorization
[2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:10.800]  act set up what does it do what are all these bills they've got uh like the

[2:36:30.880 --> 2:36:33.680]  cause for any reason the president or pentagon wishes
[2:36:33.680 --> 2:36:38.160]  and quote in in prison you are jail you and then a caller mentioned it two
[2:36:38.160 --> 2:36:41.920]  hours ago i can't even keep track of this myself i mean it is a
[2:36:41.920 --> 2:36:49.360]  deluge it is a deluge of absolute total and absolute complete
[2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:53.040]  tyranny now going back to tom briefly tom
[2:36:53.040 --> 2:36:56.960]  i mean you know the republicans and texas have had great platforms before
[2:36:56.960 --> 2:37:00.160]  that the citizens get get passed in the party
[2:37:00.160 --> 2:37:03.760]  but the but the party always does the opposite so i'm not saying your plan
[2:37:03.760 --> 2:37:07.120]  isn't good but i mean how do you make them carry it out
[2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:11.680]  hey here it is it resolved that the republican party of texas adopted a
[2:37:11.680 --> 2:37:16.240]  rule that adds to the content of the application for a place on the ballot
[2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:19.600]  the requirement that the candidate signs the following pledge
[2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:23.600]  i solemnly swear affirm on my honor to support or do no harm
[2:37:23.600 --> 2:37:27.680]  to texas state sovereignty and the other ones that i mentioned they're all the

[2:37:39.280 --> 2:37:43.680]  federal government by the u.s constitution and oppose mandates beyond
[2:37:43.680 --> 2:37:48.240]  the scope of federal authority if you want to be on the ballot in texas
[2:37:48.240 --> 2:37:53.600]  you gotta sign this and that's what we're working for god bless you tom good
[2:37:53.600 --> 2:37:57.120]  job how do how do people help you

[2:38:06.480 --> 2:38:10.560]  this is illegal this is on american we have a right to say no to this i want
[2:38:10.560 --> 2:38:13.600]  to go to watson though because for an hour i've been
[2:38:13.600 --> 2:38:18.560]  trying to remember the exact headline and and and this is a problem we get into
[2:38:18.560 --> 2:38:22.640]  here it is the centers to be detained as enemy belligerence
[2:38:22.640 --> 2:38:27.760]  and it's the enemy belligerence act and it says enemy belligerent interrogation
[2:38:27.760 --> 2:38:33.920]  detention and prosecution act of 2010 and it says for any intelligence purpose
[2:38:33.920 --> 2:38:37.840]  or any purpose directed by the president you can be held tortured you name it
[2:38:37.840 --> 2:38:42.320]  this is john mccain and joe Lieberman i got watson on the line though i was going
[2:38:42.320 --> 2:38:45.040]  to ask him the name of it but the guys did find it
[2:38:45.040 --> 2:38:48.960]  watson over in england under government socialized health care what is it like
[2:38:48.960 --> 2:38:54.160]  for you to see them celebrating this evil
[2:38:54.880 --> 2:38:58.880]  well it's amazing alex because in england
[2:38:58.880 --> 2:39:05.920]  we've got socialized health care whereby for a lot of it you have to pay you end
[2:39:05.920 --> 2:39:11.280]  up paying for it anyway for medicines and pills and
[2:39:11.280 --> 2:39:15.120]  prescriptions you have to pay for it anyway let's explain they take a bunch
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:18.320]  of tax money they take a bunch of tax money that would pay for health care
[2:39:18.320 --> 2:39:22.560]  then they tax you again people don't understand this bill go ahead
[2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:26.960]  yeah so they take they take it out of the income tax to fund the nhs
[2:39:26.960 --> 2:39:31.920]  national health service and then after time when you get treatment you have to
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:36.080]  pay for the treatment anyway and as you've mentioned there are
[2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:39.440]  horror stories routinely about people waiting
[2:39:39.440 --> 2:39:44.800]  years for vital operations people getting the wrong leg amputated
[2:39:44.800 --> 2:39:48.560]  i mean the nhs is notoriously terrible and
[2:39:48.560 --> 2:39:52.320]  the hospitals are filthy they're full of bacteria and viruses
[2:39:52.320 --> 2:39:57.200]  and anybody who you will die on a gurney for up to three weeks till you die
[2:39:57.200 --> 2:40:00.960]  without water that's that's in the news every day
[2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:03.920]  and anybody who's got any sense or any money
[2:40:03.920 --> 2:40:10.560]  goes private so to not even have the option for it to be completely
[2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:15.200]  illegal and for you to be a criminal and a tax cheat if you want
[2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:18.880]  private health care you don't pay for government run health care
[2:40:18.880 --> 2:40:24.080]  is astounding and let's be clear you get to keep your private insurance but the
[2:40:24.080 --> 2:40:29.200]  government runs what you can get and then taxes you and your savings
[2:40:29.200 --> 2:40:32.800]  accounts if you get any test or any alternative care
[2:40:32.800 --> 2:40:35.600]  or even mainline care that they don't agree with that's what the insurance
[2:40:35.600 --> 2:40:40.640]  companies love this lets them give us crap care
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:46.720]  yeah and then if if you try to defy it because the irs has been tasked to
[2:40:46.720 --> 2:40:51.840]  monitor and scrutinize what people write on their income tax return
[2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:58.320]  and if you don't please them just to conform into obama care then the fines
[2:40:58.320 --> 2:41:03.520]  for an individual of $750 a month every month
[2:41:03.520 --> 2:41:09.040]  and that's 20 that's 2,250 a month for each household and by the way that's
[2:41:09.040 --> 2:41:12.320]  only one part of it you have a giant article boiling all this down that
[2:41:12.320 --> 2:41:15.920]  just went up that needs to go out viral obama care
[2:41:15.920 --> 2:41:21.680]  taxing the american people into oblivion it says the irs will watch your
[2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:24.880]  medical records so they're now into the hospitals
[2:41:24.880 --> 2:41:29.120]  and that if you get anything you weren't supposed to get that the government
[2:41:29.120 --> 2:41:33.440]  says even on your own plan that you're supposed to get
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:39.200]  that they're going to then tax you with penalties on that
[2:41:40.160 --> 2:41:45.840]  yes there's taxes within taxes and the fact is if you don't comply with it
[2:41:45.840 --> 2:41:51.360]  they've got irs agents that recently received fresh shipments of
[2:41:51.360 --> 2:41:55.520]  pump action shotguns and combat training they're going to descend on you and your
[2:41:55.520 --> 2:41:59.040]  family and they say that they say they're
[2:41:59.040 --> 2:42:02.160]  going to garnish your wages take oh my god
[2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:05.840]  my god this is insane paul and all these people
[2:42:05.840 --> 2:42:08.800]  that have held on blue collar workers that don't want to be in a government
[2:42:08.800 --> 2:42:12.320]  welfare house this forces you to now still work
[2:42:12.320 --> 2:42:16.320]  but then go get your health care from them and have the cps have their way
[2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:19.520]  you will now have to be around big disgusting fat
[2:42:19.520 --> 2:42:25.840]  pedophiles and that's who they are disgusting criminal scum
[2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:30.320]  and it's feeding frenzy now they've got the momentum or they claim they've got
[2:42:30.320 --> 2:42:33.600]  the momentum you've got carry another saying that they're
[2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:38.000]  going to push ahead with the cap and tax so not only
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:42.320]  will you have um it's in the article according to the
[2:42:42.320 --> 2:42:47.280]  journal of accountancy in bloomberg news four hundred and nine billion dollars

[2:42:53.280 --> 2:42:56.400]  now they're going to come in with a cap and tax as well
[2:42:56.400 --> 2:43:00.320]  and tax you on your consumption and living standard
[2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:04.080]  yeah let me show people let me show them some articles
[2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:09.840]  uh this is out of ap afp after health obama zeroes in on climate
[2:43:09.840 --> 2:43:13.680]  info wars dot com curtain emo carry exploits obama care passage
[2:43:13.680 --> 2:43:17.680]  to propose carbon tax and then this is how dumb they think the public is
[2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:21.520]  the sea level will rise will all die we don't pay all these taxes
[2:43:21.520 --> 2:43:26.080]  now they're reporting flowers losing scent due to climate change and they say
[2:43:26.080 --> 2:43:29.920]  roses may never have the smell again because it's too hot
[2:43:29.920 --> 2:43:33.680]  what i mean that's like it's just it's just it's like

[2:43:41.680 --> 2:43:44.720]  commercials by the government in britain
[2:43:44.720 --> 2:43:50.160]  which showed cartoon bunny rabbits and cats and dogs drowning
[2:43:50.160 --> 2:43:54.080]  because of the rising sea levels which aren't rising

[2:44:47.920 --> 2:44:51.360]  100 years into the future
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:58.480]  good job Watson i appreciate your call and you're right this is even worse

[2:48:21.600 --> 2:48:25.200]  aggressive and you've got to realize the republican party leadership
[2:48:25.200 --> 2:48:29.440]  graham and the genrich who's out of power and senator mccain have all been for
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:32.960]  this for the global carbon taxes now mccain says he's against it
[2:48:32.960 --> 2:48:37.520]  it's a manipulation you take the editorials written by
[2:48:37.520 --> 2:48:40.320]  howard dean and in his percentage where they admitted it was a giant robbery
[2:48:40.320 --> 2:48:44.080]  for insurance companies and most importantly you make it all about the
[2:48:44.080 --> 2:48:47.200]  insurance companies and a corporate bailout a
[2:48:47.200 --> 2:48:50.720]  robbery not free healthcare it isn't free

[2:48:58.240 --> 2:49:01.680]  everybody likes it and they're going to propagandize you in fact that's in the
[2:49:01.680 --> 2:49:06.720]  news they're going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in the next 10 years
[2:49:06.720 --> 2:49:10.400]  they're talking about spending 20 billion in the next three years into the

[2:54:18.400 --> 2:54:22.640]  and it's time for everybody in the government to admit it's too big it's
[2:54:22.640 --> 2:54:25.520]  out of control they're making us all dependent to the banks
[2:54:25.520 --> 2:54:28.560]  it's time for this nation to repent when i talk about solutions that's the
[2:54:28.560 --> 2:54:32.880]  number one solution is to repent all of us that we haven't been enough
[2:54:32.880 --> 2:54:35.600]  involved that we haven't been educated enough about what's
[2:54:35.600 --> 2:54:39.200]  really happening that we haven't been out there opposing this
[2:54:39.200 --> 2:54:43.120]  we have to repent and we have to have faith that if we stand up and do the
[2:54:43.120 --> 2:54:47.520]  right thing we can stop all this again all the polls show this is
[2:54:47.520 --> 2:54:51.680]  unpopular it's unconstitutional it's illegal but the system is doing it
[2:54:51.680 --> 2:54:56.080]  they are criminals we have to hate them the leadership of the government we
[2:54:56.080 --> 2:54:59.200]  have to start despising them we have to start not trusting them
[2:54:59.200 --> 2:55:05.200]  we have to start taking action against them peacefully and lawfully
[2:55:05.200 --> 2:55:09.280]  funk master five from texas go ahead
[2:55:09.280 --> 2:55:14.960]  i i think that a good solution would be to be prepared to bring up a
[2:55:14.960 --> 2:55:20.400]  ballot resolution if the state effort doesn't go through
[2:55:20.400 --> 2:55:23.680]  just banning the federal reach in here into texas
[2:55:23.680 --> 2:55:26.560]  which would be well there's already a bunch of states moving to do that so
[2:55:26.560 --> 2:55:32.240]  yes but we need it to be strong and bold and we need millions of people to hit
[2:55:32.240 --> 2:55:35.680]  the street we need everybody to get aggressive
[2:55:35.680 --> 2:55:39.440]  definitely you know and then in texas i could see that happening i can see
[2:55:39.440 --> 2:55:43.440]  people in texas getting started getting up and and really going there and
[2:55:43.440 --> 2:55:46.160]  being making their voices heard and then i think other states will see that
[2:55:46.160 --> 2:55:50.240]  happen and then we'll see a domino effect anything else
[2:55:50.240 --> 2:55:54.480]  that's it thank you very much i bless you no one in Illinois you're on the air
[2:55:54.480 --> 2:55:59.280]  Alex yes i just wanted to speak to the
[2:55:59.280 --> 2:56:03.520]  angler american divided conquer method i think we need to transform the use of
[2:56:03.520 --> 2:56:08.800]  the word racism and to uh... ethnicism we are one race the human race
[2:56:08.800 --> 2:56:12.400]  and uh... using the word racism plays right into the mouthpieces
[2:56:12.400 --> 2:56:15.920]  of that's what this divide and conquer is is they get more people in the
[2:56:15.920 --> 2:56:20.160]  government dole to then be their minions to divide people again
[2:56:20.160 --> 2:56:24.400]  yeah and uh... earlier you use the uh...
[2:56:24.400 --> 2:56:28.480]  analogy of the brain uh... and you know the battle was really
[2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:33.680]  at the mouth and that's right where you are so uh... you're doing a great job

[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:42.280]  i would then also like to say that i'm concerned
[2:57:42.280 --> 2:57:46.480]  there's so much talk on the forums about anti-jews and jews are the enemy in
[2:57:46.480 --> 2:57:50.080]  that design is created everything that's happening right now
[2:57:50.080 --> 2:57:53.040]  and uh... i just want to speak out to the listeners
[2:57:53.040 --> 2:57:57.640]  and tell them that you can't come up people for the actions of you
[2:57:57.640 --> 2:58:01.080]  i'm a middle-class american and i also happen to be a jew
[2:58:01.080 --> 2:58:03.920]  um... i also happen to be on the right side of it

[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:23.880]  the federal government has been caught creating white supremacist groups
[2:58:23.880 --> 2:58:28.240]  and pushing this because they want politically at all to be about jews
[2:58:28.240 --> 2:58:31.640]  so the average american won't become anti-new world order
[2:58:31.640 --> 2:58:34.400]  because they're afraid to because the jew
[2:58:34.400 --> 2:58:36.240]  labels to put on it
[2:58:36.240 --> 2:58:40.440]  israel needs to be criticized as well as other nations but not just hating jews

[3:01:37.280 --> 3:01:40.600]  and once we put forth the duty of reaching out to these people that do not
[3:01:40.600 --> 3:01:42.200]  know about this health care bill
[3:01:42.200 --> 3:01:43.960]  that it will cause them to
[3:01:43.960 --> 3:01:45.680]  give us forced abortions
[3:01:45.680 --> 3:01:48.480]  that's one thing i know that the church will not agree with
[3:01:48.480 --> 3:01:50.760]  and that they will force vaccinate us
[3:01:50.760 --> 3:01:52.440]  i will not put up with this
[3:01:52.440 --> 3:01:53.440]  this is dracorn
[3:01:53.440 --> 3:01:54.640]  to this is a
[3:01:54.640 --> 3:01:58.720]  uh... this is the fact that's right that's right under the federal guidelines
[3:01:58.720 --> 3:02:02.600]  they say what care you get and they will refuse you if you don't take shots
[3:02:02.600 --> 3:02:07.200]  and in there it says the abortions are funded the executive order means nothing
[3:02:07.200 --> 3:02:12.080]  they'll just shell game the money it is paying for abortions no excuse
[3:02:12.080 --> 3:02:16.160]  and it's time for it to be notified and it will be notified and i will bring my
[3:02:16.160 --> 3:02:20.280]  video camera to each and every convention and i will stand up against
[3:02:20.280 --> 3:02:23.640]  tyranny and i will bring the churches with me i will not
[3:02:23.640 --> 3:02:24.560]  bow down
[3:02:24.560 --> 3:02:27.960]  to do it every time a scumbag that voted for this
[3:02:27.960 --> 3:02:29.360]  goes to a town hall
[3:02:29.360 --> 3:02:33.440]  you bring your church and you get no scumbags faces and you run them out and

[3:04:15.340 --> 3:04:18.080]  i'm not mistaken i believe texas
[3:04:18.080 --> 3:04:20.880]  did not want to be a part of the uh...
[3:04:20.880 --> 3:04:22.840]  federal government is that correct
[3:04:22.840 --> 3:04:24.440]  and they signed a treaty
[3:04:24.440 --> 3:04:28.760]  to enter the united states of texas would have his absolute full powers
[3:04:28.760 --> 3:04:33.320]  uh... under the tenth amendment and that it could leave anytime it wanted to
[3:04:33.320 --> 3:04:36.560]  buddy i think a lot of other states are gonna follow the role model

[3:10:49.520 --> 3:10:51.560]  as a skilled practitioner of law
[3:10:51.560 --> 3:10:53.840]  some of his practice in the federal and state courts
[3:10:53.840 --> 3:10:56.240]  bill bird on the health care issue first
[3:10:56.240 --> 3:10:57.720]  how do you see us
[3:10:57.720 --> 3:11:00.360]  defeating this i mean it's discriminatory some of the big unions
[3:11:00.360 --> 3:11:01.320]  are exempt
[3:11:01.320 --> 3:11:02.880]  from the catalac uh...
[3:11:02.880 --> 3:11:04.120]  policy tax
[3:11:04.120 --> 3:11:05.360]  some states are
[3:11:05.360 --> 3:11:07.000]  more exempt than others
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:11.400]  uh... it it forces people who don't want insurance to go pay money
[3:11:11.400 --> 3:11:12.760]  to private groups
[3:11:12.760 --> 3:11:16.320]  the insurance companies wrote this bill bird
[3:11:16.320 --> 3:11:19.040]  uh... my pleasure to be on the show out
[3:11:19.040 --> 3:11:22.000]  as you just said for it there's so many reasons
[3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:24.480]  to knock this bill out to overturn this bill
[3:11:24.480 --> 3:11:27.800]  i think uh... various attorney generals in various states have already filed
[3:11:27.800 --> 3:11:28.640]  suit
[3:11:28.640 --> 3:11:30.400]  many many more to come
[3:11:30.400 --> 3:11:33.720]  but you highlight the the certificate park it's just unfair they made a deal
[3:11:33.720 --> 3:11:34.800]  with the union
[3:11:34.800 --> 3:11:36.720]  they made a deal with certain states
[3:11:36.720 --> 3:11:40.160]  you know here the federal government is forcing people to buy insurance
[3:11:40.160 --> 3:11:43.160]  and that's different than the federal government taxing people
[3:11:43.160 --> 3:11:46.200]  uh... if you don't buy insurance they're going to penalize you and the
[3:11:46.200 --> 3:11:49.880]  penalties are going to increase the penalties to the company here
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:51.440]  uh... this is just a
[3:11:51.440 --> 3:11:53.400]  uh... really socialist takeover
[3:11:53.400 --> 3:11:57.240]  uh... every member of what you said here anyone who voted for that bill
[3:11:57.240 --> 3:12:00.400]  people should vote against them this year if there's not a strong uh...
[3:12:00.400 --> 3:12:04.800]  or in some places if a republican didn't file an action against them
[3:12:04.800 --> 3:12:08.120]  because a lot of the deadlines for filing a passed
[3:12:08.120 --> 3:12:09.960]  especially here in pennsylvania
[3:12:09.960 --> 3:12:13.280]  and people should run as an independent those districts and find out how to get
[3:12:13.280 --> 3:12:14.760]  on the ballot because
[3:12:14.760 --> 3:12:17.960]  this is really outrageous eighty percent of people in the country
[3:12:17.960 --> 3:12:19.000]  they did not
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:21.960]  they did not do not want health care reform
[3:12:21.960 --> 3:12:24.360]  and what we have here they passed it anyhow
[3:12:24.360 --> 3:12:25.840]  they don't care about us
[3:12:25.840 --> 3:12:28.960]  the kickback that some of these people must be getting
[3:12:28.960 --> 3:12:32.680]  the money under the table the promises by obama and other people
[3:12:32.680 --> 3:12:33.640]  uh...
[3:12:33.640 --> 3:12:37.240]  so many people must be making obama's friends have to be making a fortune to
[3:12:37.240 --> 3:12:38.480]  push this forward
[3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:39.800]  but the other thing is
[3:12:39.800 --> 3:12:42.440]  they're starting to they do some benefit this year
[3:12:42.440 --> 3:12:44.880]  but the taxation effect is here
[3:12:44.880 --> 3:12:45.960]  and other benefits
[3:12:45.960 --> 3:12:49.120]  supposed benefits don't kick into two thousand fourteen
[3:12:49.120 --> 3:12:52.280]  that means they're gonna have to uh... they're gonna tax for ten years to pay
[3:12:52.280 --> 3:12:54.000]  benefits for six years
[3:12:54.000 --> 3:12:56.080]  i mean this is just totally outrageous
[3:12:56.080 --> 3:12:58.920]  and then we have to do everything we can right now
[3:12:58.920 --> 3:13:03.720]  uh... i know uh... gary crept uh... he's gonna file a lawsuit the various
[3:13:03.720 --> 3:13:05.840]  attorney generals are filing a lawsuit
[3:13:05.840 --> 3:13:06.680]  and uh...
[3:13:06.680 --> 3:13:08.680]  also history goes back
[3:13:08.680 --> 3:13:10.640]  that if enough pressure goes on
[3:13:10.640 --> 3:13:14.040]  i mean it looks doubtful but congress could repeal the act
[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:17.640]  but the best way to get the repeal is really and i'm a lifelong democrat
[3:13:17.640 --> 3:13:18.200]  that
[3:13:18.200 --> 3:13:20.120]  they have to vote out all these people
[3:13:20.120 --> 3:13:22.200]  even the people of faith
[3:13:22.200 --> 3:13:25.800]  i don't think any democratic safety is safe right now
[3:13:25.800 --> 3:13:28.120]  when eighty percent of people in this country don't want it
[3:13:28.120 --> 3:13:31.760]  well philberg you said it though i've been saying seventy plus percent but
[3:13:31.760 --> 3:13:34.880]  many polls now show eighty percent are more
[3:13:34.880 --> 3:13:36.880]  when people actually read the bill
[3:13:36.880 --> 3:13:38.640]  i mean the the the the
[3:13:38.640 --> 3:13:41.400]  the federal government and i read the provision earlier i'll pull it out so i
[3:13:41.400 --> 3:13:43.880]  want to read the quote again from the bill
[3:13:43.880 --> 3:13:46.080]  uh... under this comparative care
[3:13:46.080 --> 3:13:48.400]  it says the irs
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:52.440]  will decide and will be looking at your medical records and your bills everything
[3:13:52.440 --> 3:13:55.120]  goes to them now they're gonna share with other agencies
[3:13:55.120 --> 3:13:58.240]  that if you get treatments that they say shouldn't be covered even if you own
[3:13:58.240 --> 3:14:02.160]  your own insurance they're gonna put extra taxes on you
[3:14:02.160 --> 3:14:06.240]  i mean this gets involved in commerce this gets involved in free choice
[3:14:06.240 --> 3:14:10.240]  uh... this makes private individuals by a pre-aid plan
[3:14:10.240 --> 3:14:14.120]  from a private group we know the insurance companies really wrote
[3:14:14.120 --> 3:14:18.440]  this bill and their stocks way up what about lawsuits against
[3:14:18.440 --> 3:14:21.500]  the uh... insurance companies for going in
[3:14:21.500 --> 3:14:24.440]  and lobbying to make the government
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:26.640]  make you pay them money
[3:14:26.640 --> 3:14:29.440]  uh... perhaps another thing is that when you mention iraq
[3:14:29.440 --> 3:14:32.440]  i think i saw in the bill there that they're going to hire sixteen thousand
[3:14:32.440 --> 3:14:33.880]  new iris agents
[3:14:33.880 --> 3:14:35.560]  uh... now it's twenty
[3:14:35.560 --> 3:14:36.560]  now it's twenty thousand
[3:14:36.560 --> 3:14:38.520]  to look at you and look at me you know i mean
[3:14:38.520 --> 3:14:41.520]  it's outrageous iraq should not be involved in this i mean
[3:14:41.520 --> 3:14:43.520]  there's so many factors here and
[3:14:43.520 --> 3:14:46.840]  and everyone we have to pay attention the next couple days because
[3:14:46.840 --> 3:14:50.080]  there's so many different things in this two thousand page document that no
[3:14:50.080 --> 3:14:51.280]  one's even read
[3:14:51.280 --> 3:14:54.560]  and uh... it's outrageous i think we have to do everything and i think the
[3:14:54.560 --> 3:14:56.960]  people that you haven't powered up to now
[3:14:56.960 --> 3:14:58.560]  have to be empowered more
[3:14:58.560 --> 3:15:01.600]  to stand up and not let any of these uh... there should be
[3:15:01.600 --> 3:15:05.320]  when the uh... break comes up now for eastern pass over these congress people
[3:15:05.320 --> 3:15:06.360]  go back home
[3:15:06.360 --> 3:15:09.760]  if they're holding down on people should really go after these things
[3:15:09.760 --> 3:15:11.440]  and tell them how upset they are
[3:15:11.440 --> 3:15:14.240]  some of the people they come i'm right outside of philadelphia
[3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:17.880]  and the distance here are considered very safe democratic seat because they're
[3:15:17.880 --> 3:15:18.600]  like
[3:15:18.600 --> 3:15:22.560]  probably eighty percent ninety percent democratic yeah so is kennedy's seat
[3:15:22.560 --> 3:15:26.480]  so is kennedy's seat massachusetts and that's the issue a lot of democrats are
[3:15:26.480 --> 3:15:27.560]  mad about this
[3:15:27.560 --> 3:15:31.400]  all right right the people really are when you get down the rank and file
[3:15:31.400 --> 3:15:32.880]  down the people here so
[3:15:32.880 --> 3:15:35.800]  i think you have to keep your message out there i'm going to put my message
[3:15:35.800 --> 3:15:37.240]  out that you mentioned
[3:15:37.240 --> 3:15:40.840]  and i don't have a firm date soon as i do any day now we're planning a birth
[3:15:40.840 --> 3:15:42.000]  certificate
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:46.120]  uh... eligibility march on washington and on that we can tackle on the health care
[3:15:46.120 --> 3:15:46.680]  thing
[3:15:46.680 --> 3:15:51.200]  i think this could turn out to be the biggest march history of washington dc
[3:15:51.200 --> 3:15:52.800]  and if the people come out
[3:15:52.800 --> 3:15:56.320]  and the national media we can force that once you get so many people
[3:15:56.320 --> 3:15:58.880]  they're gonna have to cover this and we're going to start it
[3:15:58.880 --> 3:16:02.360]  we're asking people to bring a copy of birth certificate
[3:16:02.360 --> 3:16:07.920]  note my words out there people obama is a full phony obama is a fraud obama is
[3:16:07.920 --> 3:16:11.040]  a usurper as i also go into a show the pictures
[3:16:11.040 --> 3:16:13.560]  the issue is really not even where he was born
[3:16:13.560 --> 3:16:17.060]  i really do believe one thousand percent he was born in kenya
[3:16:17.060 --> 3:16:20.640]  therefore he's not natural born but more significant
[3:16:20.640 --> 3:16:24.200]  it is the adoption he's adopted in indonesia
[3:16:24.200 --> 3:16:27.960]  what he's adopted people stop and think for a minute you you know people in your
[3:16:27.960 --> 3:16:30.680]  neighborhood or relatives that are adopted
[3:16:30.680 --> 3:16:32.120]  um... and i had a
[3:16:32.120 --> 3:16:36.240]  discussion with immigration you have to give your citizenship up if you adopt
[3:16:36.240 --> 3:16:40.920]  a korean baby they give up the korean citizenship and become american if koreans
[3:16:40.920 --> 3:16:45.320]  adopted american you give up your american you become a korean we know he
[3:16:45.320 --> 3:16:48.360]  was adopted as an islamicist
[3:16:48.360 --> 3:16:49.760]  in indonesia
[3:16:49.760 --> 3:16:54.680]  end of the story his name is barry sataro he is a fraud
[3:16:54.680 --> 3:16:58.680]  absolutely and that's why the people when you explain this about a korean
[3:16:58.680 --> 3:17:01.840]  explain about the high-end children coming over
[3:17:01.840 --> 3:17:04.560]  and then you turn about obama but they agree on everything else except the
[3:17:04.560 --> 3:17:06.240]  obama wake up america
[3:17:06.240 --> 3:17:08.600]  and i'm not talking about your listeners wake up the people that are
[3:17:08.600 --> 3:17:10.320]  supporting obama stuff like that
[3:17:10.320 --> 3:17:13.240]  he's a fraud he's a phony i keep saying these things
[3:17:13.240 --> 3:17:16.920]  no one's blocking me up no one shut me down because i'm right on it
[3:17:16.920 --> 3:17:20.200]  so it's in the courts are taking their time
[3:17:20.200 --> 3:17:23.960]  this march i think it'd be significant because we will have a great march
[3:17:23.960 --> 3:17:26.720]  and bring in people from all over this great country
[3:17:26.720 --> 3:17:30.200]  i've had phone calls even without a firm date i've had people calling from fifty
[3:17:30.200 --> 3:17:32.400]  from about twenty states already
[3:17:32.400 --> 3:17:34.960]  i had a gentleman called the other day from massachusetts
[3:17:34.960 --> 3:17:37.440]  he said i'm handicapped i'm coming
[3:17:37.440 --> 3:17:41.000]  you know this is outrageous what's going on and i think we have to hold
[3:17:41.000 --> 3:17:42.560]  everyone responsible
[3:17:42.560 --> 3:17:46.040]  the march a peaceful march by the way some people are trying to tie me into
[3:17:46.040 --> 3:17:46.760]  violence
[3:17:46.760 --> 3:17:48.160]  we don't want violence
[3:17:48.160 --> 3:17:50.120]  we're gonna have a peaceful march of
[3:17:50.120 --> 3:17:53.120]  i hope to have over a million i hope that two million people
[3:17:53.120 --> 3:17:57.720]  within like three hours of washington dc lives like one-third of the nation
[3:17:57.720 --> 3:18:00.640]  and then we have to also send a message
[3:18:00.640 --> 3:18:02.120]  to the republicans
[3:18:02.120 --> 3:18:05.920]  who've been attacking you the birthers and saying how dare you do this when
[3:18:05.920 --> 3:18:08.000]  over half of registered republicans
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:09.080]  in polls
[3:18:09.080 --> 3:18:10.240]  question his
[3:18:10.240 --> 3:18:12.520]  authenticity in his providence
[3:18:12.520 --> 3:18:15.040]  how dare the republican party leadership
[3:18:15.040 --> 3:18:17.440]  try to protect barry satara
[3:18:17.440 --> 3:18:21.680]  well the problem is and i think you said it basically on that
[3:18:21.680 --> 3:18:25.120]  the problem is many people in washington of both parties
[3:18:25.120 --> 3:18:27.800]  the higher they become they're in bed together
[3:18:27.800 --> 3:18:31.040]  and they really could care less about us i mean even though the republicans
[3:18:31.040 --> 3:18:32.360]  didn't support this uh...
[3:18:32.360 --> 3:18:33.400]  health care thing
[3:18:33.400 --> 3:18:36.120]  you know the the pressure could have been on out here
[3:18:36.120 --> 3:18:39.320]  more so than they did i mean they held it off as much as they could but the
[3:18:39.320 --> 3:18:41.520]  pressure should now be on the republicans
[3:18:41.520 --> 3:18:45.200]  to to get more republicans elected this year so they can repeal this act
[3:18:45.200 --> 3:18:45.800]  because
[3:18:45.800 --> 3:18:47.560]  this is not a good act
[3:18:47.560 --> 3:18:50.560]  you know we do need medical reform in this country but not the way they
[3:18:50.560 --> 3:18:52.080]  just shoved it down our throats
[3:18:52.080 --> 3:18:56.000]  and with that the taxation on individuals the taxation on businesses if
[3:18:56.000 --> 3:18:57.560]  they don't take out health care
[3:18:57.560 --> 3:18:59.480]  the iraq looking over the shoulder
[3:18:59.480 --> 3:19:01.600]  i understand there's a provision there that if
[3:19:01.600 --> 3:19:04.960]  you don't pay the bill or something that don't have your bank account i mean
[3:19:04.960 --> 3:19:08.120]  this is where it's there and we have to stop it
[3:19:08.120 --> 3:19:11.600]  i mean imagine all the iraq's unconstitutional abuses
[3:19:11.600 --> 3:19:12.480]  and now
[3:19:12.480 --> 3:19:14.320]  they're going to every month
[3:19:14.320 --> 3:19:17.920]  be looking at your paycheck records and the health care you've gotten
[3:19:17.920 --> 3:19:22.160]  and find you if you get health care they don't agree with that is in the bill
[3:19:22.160 --> 3:19:24.880]  and that that's not big brother i don't know what it is
[3:19:24.880 --> 3:19:28.800]  america we have to stand up and resist this because this is just the beginning
[3:19:28.800 --> 3:19:29.760]  of the end
[3:19:29.760 --> 3:19:32.320]  this obama by being a phony and a fraud
[3:19:32.320 --> 3:19:35.440]  takes away such a basic portion of our constitution
[3:19:35.440 --> 3:19:38.320]  and there's nothing more important than constitution and that's why i'm doing
[3:19:38.320 --> 3:19:38.880]  this
[3:19:38.880 --> 3:19:43.040]  this course is party lines okay stay there stay there absolutely

[3:24:06.560 --> 3:24:13.120]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[3:24:13.120 --> 3:24:21.120]  your calls on the takeover of health care coming up
[3:24:21.120 --> 3:24:25.360]  they're very smart very ingenious rats they're going to phase it in actually
[3:24:25.360 --> 3:24:30.160]  through 2018 the taxes come this year and next year
[3:24:30.160 --> 3:24:34.400]  and when i read the legislation i can't believe this is it's worse than we even
[3:24:34.400 --> 3:24:37.840]  thought that's why they never let us see the final version
[3:24:37.840 --> 3:24:41.120]  okay philberg you've got this big march coming up we'll have you on as soon as
[3:24:41.120 --> 3:24:43.920]  you announce the date everybody needs to go to this
[3:24:43.920 --> 3:24:47.200]  it's not going to solve everything but it'll be another big step
[3:24:47.200 --> 3:24:51.440]  towards doing that uh reading the mail newspaper
[3:24:51.440 --> 3:24:55.200]  with him says his teachers his name was barry sitaro he admits his name was
[3:24:55.200 --> 3:25:00.480]  barry sitaro he was adopted uh we know he was obviously
[3:25:00.480 --> 3:25:04.720]  not born here he was born in kenya but regardless we've got him
[3:25:04.720 --> 3:25:09.200]  on the citizenship issue because he shouldn't be able to be a u.s.
[3:25:09.200 --> 3:25:13.120]  citizen because he's an indonesian citizen but all of that is sealed where
[3:25:13.120 --> 3:25:16.480]  do we go from there well first off what you say is
[3:25:16.480 --> 3:25:20.480]  absolutely true and then some people come up and say well dual citizenship
[3:25:20.480 --> 3:25:24.160]  for dual citizenship to exist but it wouldn't give him the right to be
[3:25:24.160 --> 3:25:27.840]  president both countries must have that that has not
[3:25:27.840 --> 3:25:30.960]  occurred in the indonesian now has dual citizenship
[3:25:30.960 --> 3:25:34.800]  as of the year 2005 and it's not retroactive
[3:25:34.800 --> 3:25:40.640]  so back when he was born in 1961 or he was adopted around 1964 or 65
[3:25:40.640 --> 3:25:44.560]  there was no dual citizenship he is adopted there's school records
[3:25:44.560 --> 3:25:48.400]  we filmed the we uh ap filmed them a tv show filmed the
[3:25:48.400 --> 3:25:51.760]  accurate true records um and that's why when he went to
[3:25:51.760 --> 3:25:55.840]  occidental people know him as barry his real name is barry sitaro
[3:25:55.840 --> 3:26:00.160]  so every time he uses the name barack kusane obama that's a fraud
[3:26:00.160 --> 3:26:03.200]  he committed fraud in 50 states to run for president
[3:26:03.200 --> 3:26:06.080]  every time he got sworn in barack kusane obama what do you think of the
[3:26:06.080 --> 3:26:09.440]  movement of everybody calling him barry sitaro now
[3:26:09.440 --> 3:26:12.240]  that's what we should do we should actually call him barry sitaro but we
[3:26:12.240 --> 3:26:15.280]  really have and they can't stop us i mean that's a healthcare
[3:26:15.280 --> 3:26:19.120]  way to protest that that could bring him down if just everybody starts calling
[3:26:19.120 --> 3:26:23.280]  him barry sitaro the indonesian citizen known as barack obama
[3:26:23.280 --> 3:26:28.240]  right because if he legal you know if you have a adopted name that's your real
[3:26:28.240 --> 3:26:32.160]  name okay that's your legal name i mean i'd like to see
[3:26:32.160 --> 3:26:35.760]  but we can't see any of his records all of his records are sealed
[3:26:35.760 --> 3:26:39.520]  again if you're just out there why would you spend over 1.6 million dollars
[3:26:39.520 --> 3:26:42.640]  fighting all the lawsuits if you had nothing to hide
[3:26:42.640 --> 3:26:46.720]  he is not a natural born citizen the strongest case i have
[3:26:46.720 --> 3:26:50.240]  alex is pending in the uh court of appeals with district of columbia where i
[3:26:50.240 --> 3:26:54.160]  have pseudobama stating that he's not natural born he's not natural
[3:26:54.160 --> 3:26:58.240]  lives but he's an illegal alien and therefore the salary and benefit he
[3:26:58.240 --> 3:27:01.760]  received as the u.s senator were fraudulent and therefore that money
[3:27:01.760 --> 3:27:05.440]  about a million dollars to go back to u.s treasury i'm hoping the court can do
[3:27:05.440 --> 3:27:08.160]  something with that but i doubt it there's so much pressure on the courts
[3:27:08.160 --> 3:27:11.920]  coming from obama and obama's people from barry sitaro
[3:27:11.920 --> 3:27:15.600]  the people from barry sitaro yeah we can do something
[3:27:15.600 --> 3:27:19.840]  we the people can do something and we can and we can mobilize and do things
[3:27:19.840 --> 3:27:23.200]  peacefully we're gonna start putting stuff up on our website about
[3:27:23.200 --> 3:27:26.880]  uh flyers they could download for the march soon they get to march date i'll
[3:27:26.880 --> 3:27:29.360]  call you back on that but we have to start doing stuff
[3:27:29.360 --> 3:27:32.160]  we can even get people will have it up on our website soon
[3:27:32.160 --> 3:27:37.040]  to have signs out there five people could stand over at a bridge on a uh
[3:27:37.040 --> 3:27:42.000]  major uh roadway at that during rush hour and you can affect between five and
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:45.920]  twenty thousand five thousand twenty five thousand people
[3:27:45.920 --> 3:27:49.840]  so we can mobilize this issue i think this health care thing
[3:27:49.840 --> 3:27:54.480]  is probably the greatest thing to help us put obama i'm sorry to put barry
[3:27:54.480 --> 3:27:59.360]  sitaro in his place barry sitaro um michelle obama
[3:27:59.360 --> 3:28:03.280]  or i guess her name is rachel sitaro michelle sitaro
[3:28:03.280 --> 3:28:07.520]  howard dean other officials at the democratic national convention
[3:28:07.520 --> 3:28:12.560]  have a committee a senior campaign people and senior administration people
[3:28:12.560 --> 3:28:17.360]  they should all be subjected to the criminal justice system and tried and
[3:28:17.360 --> 3:28:22.320]  those that are convicted should go to jail and with this any day now
[3:28:22.320 --> 3:28:26.160]  how can you get it i'm reissuing a press release calling for
[3:28:26.160 --> 3:28:31.200]  the deep throat of barry sitaro someone out there is going to want to save their
[3:28:31.200 --> 3:28:34.000]  can and they will give us the information the final
[3:28:34.000 --> 3:28:38.080]  information we need remember on the situation with
[3:28:38.080 --> 3:28:41.520]  watergate nixon didn't go down because of the breaking
[3:28:41.520 --> 3:28:46.800]  nixon went down because of the cover-up we now have obama in office for 15
[3:28:46.800 --> 3:28:51.200]  months and we have a massive cover-up so we can get to him peacefully
[3:28:51.200 --> 3:28:54.400]  and i think we can do it with you know that guy there's people like you out
[3:28:54.400 --> 3:28:57.200]  there that will talk about the truth out here
[3:28:57.200 --> 3:29:00.560]  and i and it came out last year that barry sitaro
[3:29:00.560 --> 3:29:04.960]  masquerading is brock h obama brock who's saying obama
[3:29:04.960 --> 3:29:09.680]  that he's got a full team with an enemy's list going after the berthers i mean

[3:29:12.640 --> 3:29:15.920]  that means there's where there's smoke there's fire
[3:29:15.920 --> 3:29:20.160]  absolutely absolutely and the thing is that we can do something

[3:34:24.480 --> 3:34:27.760]  that people are finally really starting to read the bills
[3:34:27.760 --> 3:34:30.320]  and they're finding out just how criminal this group is but take the
[3:34:30.320 --> 3:34:32.560]  carbon taxes they say they're going to try to pass
[3:34:32.560 --> 3:34:35.760]  that were barry sataro and michelle sataro and their
[3:34:35.760 --> 3:34:39.280]  controllers can shut down any factories they want
[3:34:39.280 --> 3:34:43.120]  or any businesses you take the takeover of of the car industries
[3:34:43.120 --> 3:34:45.840]  if you were a big democratic donor you got to keep
[3:34:45.840 --> 3:34:49.680]  your car dealership if you weren't they went now this came out in congress
[3:34:49.680 --> 3:34:53.760]  they would take your dealership away i mean you've studied barack obama am i
[3:34:53.760 --> 3:34:57.920]  right in saying he is a complete mafia thug
[3:34:57.920 --> 3:35:05.760]  he's um this thing for a minute um he is so bad the people he associated with
[3:35:05.760 --> 3:35:08.960]  if he applied for a job as a chicago police officer
[3:35:08.960 --> 3:35:12.960]  he couldn't even get the job because of associations with bill airs and reverend
[3:35:12.960 --> 3:35:16.400]  the other people around him he couldn't get a job as an fbi agent or a secret
[3:35:16.400 --> 3:35:20.320]  service agent yet they're they're protecting him now i mean this
[3:35:20.320 --> 3:35:24.720]  this guy is so bad we don't know how he came on the scene we don't know who the
[3:35:24.720 --> 3:35:27.920]  payor for it went to he deceived the american public
[3:35:27.920 --> 3:35:31.040]  and i think he's getting blackmailed now ladies and gentlemen
[3:35:31.040 --> 3:35:34.080]  uh i think i might have mentioned this before but think about it the
[3:35:34.080 --> 3:35:38.160]  cabinet he has is not a cabinet of of change
[3:35:38.160 --> 3:35:42.560]  it's basically bill printed a cabinet 70 percent the programs he's put forth
[3:35:42.560 --> 3:35:47.520]  in the past 15 months it's not a program of change i think he's
[3:35:47.520 --> 3:35:50.960]  being told what to do remember alex he at the beginning he wanted to keep his
[3:35:50.960 --> 3:35:54.240]  blackberry so i don't know whatever happened but that's probably how he gets
[3:35:54.240 --> 3:35:57.600]  messages someone's controlling him someone's telling them what to do i
[3:35:57.600 --> 3:36:01.040]  think back then they said bill bergs right you're a fraud you're a phony
[3:36:01.040 --> 3:36:04.480]  you want to be president you got to play ball our way i think that's what we have
[3:36:04.480 --> 3:36:08.080]  the cabinet we have and that's what we have the push on the program he has
[3:36:08.080 --> 3:36:11.920]  but it's time listen what they did this health care is outrageous when 80
[3:36:11.920 --> 3:36:14.880]  percent of people in this country say we don't want it
[3:36:14.880 --> 3:36:18.480]  they go ahead and pass something like that hopefully the 80 percent of people
[3:36:18.480 --> 3:36:22.880]  will will stay together and vote out every one of these people that we now
[3:36:22.880 --> 3:36:26.160]  they're saying they're going to spend three billion dollars
[3:36:26.160 --> 3:36:29.280]  or one report says two and a half one three billion a year
[3:36:29.280 --> 3:36:32.560]  in government-run tv ads with taxpayer money
[3:36:32.560 --> 3:36:37.040]  telling us how great this is and lying to us over the next ten years
[3:36:37.040 --> 3:36:41.680]  i mean how much money is that the next three that's nine billion i guess it's
[3:36:41.680 --> 3:36:46.880]  more than 20 something million i mean this is totally insane
[3:36:46.880 --> 3:36:51.280]  and what scares me phil is this is an all or nothing game for these people
[3:36:51.280 --> 3:36:55.680]  they're clearly going for broke and i agree with michael sabbage i believe
[3:36:55.680 --> 3:37:00.320]  obama may stage terror attacks uh... to blame it on his political enemies
[3:37:00.320 --> 3:37:05.920]  as a pretext to save his agenda um... i i wouldn't have anything about him
[3:37:05.920 --> 3:37:10.080]  but how about the other part of medicare he says that it takes five hundred
[3:37:10.080 --> 3:37:14.720]  billion dollars out of medicare but then he has your daddy to tell people on
[3:37:14.720 --> 3:37:17.760]  medicare that you know your benefits really get cut
[3:37:17.760 --> 3:37:20.320]  i mean yeah let me stop you again they're saying
[3:37:20.320 --> 3:37:25.600]  30 plus million will be forced to buy insurance who are working poor
[3:37:25.600 --> 3:37:29.280]  and then they're saying another 10 to 15 million will go on
[3:37:29.280 --> 3:37:35.040]  uh... medicare and medicaid but but they're gonna cut it by 500 billion
[3:37:35.040 --> 3:37:39.040]  that's their number uh... some of the numbers show it's a trillion how do you
[3:37:39.040 --> 3:37:43.200]  bring more people on the program and cut the funding
[3:37:43.200 --> 3:37:47.360]  and then still give the care it just doesn't make sense
[3:37:47.360 --> 3:37:50.480]  i mean i think if you gave this question to a two-yearer to a second
[3:37:50.480 --> 3:37:54.560]  greater they would answer better than obama answers that this is outrageous
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:37:57.120]  how can they take that kind of money from a program
[3:37:57.120 --> 3:38:00.080]  and still give you the same thing they're taking that money from the program
[3:38:00.080 --> 3:38:02.560]  to supposedly pay for this new health care bill
[3:38:02.560 --> 3:38:06.160]  i wonder who's getting paid off on this health care bill
[3:38:06.160 --> 3:38:11.920]  and then they're saying the irs will get 10 million dollars every two years
[3:38:11.920 --> 3:38:15.440]  uh... that's associated press to fund
[3:38:15.440 --> 3:38:19.520]  running it and and it actually says in fact i've got it right here i read it
[3:38:19.520 --> 3:38:23.040]  the first and second hour the actual provision
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:26.800]  that the irs will look at your medical records
[3:38:26.800 --> 3:38:30.240]  it all be digitally uploaded they're allowed to share it with other agencies
[3:38:30.240 --> 3:38:32.880]  and if you get care they say shouldn't be covered
[3:38:32.880 --> 3:38:36.240]  they're going to find you
[3:38:36.240 --> 3:38:39.120]  and they are and who's doing this the irs will be doing this i mean they're
[3:38:39.120 --> 3:38:43.280]  really medically trained for this it's everything about this bill is outrageous
[3:38:43.280 --> 3:38:46.560]  you know a few things kind of good that somebody would say well my kids can be
[3:38:46.560 --> 3:38:49.840]  on till age 26 and i'm gonna cover this and that but you gotta look at the
[3:38:49.840 --> 3:38:52.720]  old negatives on this bill it's just no good
[3:38:52.720 --> 3:38:56.720]  who's gonna pay for it phil we're we're going bankrupt here i mean who's
[3:38:56.720 --> 3:38:58.880]  gonna pay for it that's right that's right and i'm
[3:38:58.880 --> 3:39:01.440]  listening i'll be glad to get any questions from anybody that wants to call
[3:39:01.440 --> 3:39:03.840]  in too i have no problem with that all right we're going to go to the calls
[3:39:03.840 --> 3:39:08.320]  right now then kate in new york you're on the air go ahead
[3:39:09.600 --> 3:39:14.080]  the work that you do welcome cat go ahead
[3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:18.080]  yeah i just wanted to say thank you and um i i think now is the time for us to
[3:39:18.080 --> 3:39:21.520]  all about buying together and find a solution to this mess i mean it's one
[3:39:21.520 --> 3:39:25.680]  thing about getting angry we were all angry but i think we really think we
[3:39:25.680 --> 3:39:28.640]  need to start thinking about what we're going to do to take care of all this
[3:39:28.640 --> 3:39:32.480]  mess and i want to hear your take on solutions but all i've given for three
[3:39:32.480 --> 3:39:36.560]  and a half hours is solutions take your states back nullify
[3:39:36.560 --> 3:39:41.680]  lawsuits uh expose barry sataro as a fraud i mean
[3:39:41.680 --> 3:39:46.080]  what are your ideas well my idea is what do you think about all of us
[3:39:46.080 --> 3:39:49.040]  contributing to a fund on info words dot com
[3:39:49.040 --> 3:39:52.240]  to hire constitution lawyers to fight this health care plan
[3:39:52.240 --> 3:39:55.440]  i mean every day they're taking more and more of our constitutional rights away
[3:39:55.440 --> 3:39:59.360]  from us and if we all find together and we all contribute to a fund to hire the
[3:39:59.360 --> 3:40:01.920]  constitutional lawyers i mean that's their job right
[3:40:01.920 --> 3:40:04.320]  all right cat let me stop you i'm gonna put you on hold and come back to you
[3:40:04.320 --> 3:40:08.960]  get philbert's take well i mean right now before you hire other
[3:40:08.960 --> 3:40:11.520]  people let's see what the various attorney generals
[3:40:11.520 --> 3:40:15.440]  many lawsuits are going in all around the country so let's wait a few
[3:40:15.440 --> 3:40:19.760]  months and see what happens on that but again the courts do not like to get
[3:40:19.760 --> 3:40:22.800]  involved in that excuse me and they can delay it
[3:40:22.800 --> 3:40:26.320]  that's why i think we need a peaceful revolution we have to get people
[3:40:26.320 --> 3:40:29.920]  organized across this country together come together with us
[3:40:29.920 --> 3:40:32.880]  and we can show the government we're not going to tolerate this
[3:40:32.880 --> 3:40:35.840]  look at the thousands that came out of tea parties all around the country
[3:40:35.840 --> 3:40:38.880]  millions and uh the millions you're right and we're going to have flyers
[3:40:38.880 --> 3:40:42.880]  available for their this April 15th um
[3:40:42.880 --> 3:40:45.680]  they're going to have the various events on April 15th around the country
[3:40:45.680 --> 3:40:49.200]  we're going to have flyers on obama crimes dot com talking about our march
[3:40:49.200 --> 3:40:52.640]  i'll give you a date soon and i hope that our march in washington
[3:40:52.640 --> 3:40:56.480]  will be the largest ever because we'll encompass everything on that
[3:40:56.480 --> 3:41:00.800]  but there's one thing if he's a phony and a fraud which i believe he is he's a
[3:41:00.800 --> 3:41:04.080]  server everything he is signing is void or voidable
[3:41:04.080 --> 3:41:08.080]  so people you know if you have various issues out there and the biggest issue
[3:41:08.080 --> 3:41:10.720]  he can't overcome is the fact that he's a fraud
[3:41:10.720 --> 3:41:14.400]  he's a phony therefore this bill that he just signed into effect
[3:41:14.400 --> 3:41:18.480]  will be void or voidable i agree now now we know he's a fraud we know he's an
[3:41:18.480 --> 3:41:22.800]  indonesian citizen and we know then that he can't be a u.s citizen he's an
[3:41:22.800 --> 3:41:25.440]  illegal alien that's confirmed no debate
[3:41:25.440 --> 3:41:28.480]  mainstream news hidden in plain view but let me go back here
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:32.320]  to what cat said she's very sweet to think people should give us money and
[3:41:32.320 --> 3:41:35.840]  there's a lot of talk show hosts who have political funds and raise
[3:41:35.840 --> 3:41:38.400]  millions of dollars and keep most of it
[3:41:38.400 --> 3:41:42.160]  even if i got the money found the right lawyers and did it
[3:41:42.160 --> 3:41:45.760]  this stuff all goes to the federal court in dc
[3:41:45.760 --> 3:41:50.240]  and it's very political that's why i'm saying the attorney generals lawsuits
[3:41:50.240 --> 3:41:55.520]  aren't enough we need state laws nullifying this and the state standing
[3:41:55.520 --> 3:41:59.280]  up and saying your federal reserve collection
[3:41:59.280 --> 3:42:02.640]  agency the irs will not operate in our state
[3:42:02.640 --> 3:42:06.480]  under this program and we say it's illegal that's constitutional
[3:42:06.480 --> 3:42:10.560]  sure i could make a bunch of money off sitting here and just collecting millions
[3:42:10.560 --> 3:42:13.360]  if i wanted to and then hire some lawyers
[3:42:13.360 --> 3:42:17.360]  but and and that may come up but then if we fail
[3:42:17.360 --> 3:42:20.960]  everybody's going to get mad at me okay the answer is
[3:42:20.960 --> 3:42:25.200]  you the people hitting him from every angle and calling him barry sataro
[3:42:25.200 --> 3:42:28.320]  the power of everybody calling him barry sit and from this
[3:42:28.320 --> 3:42:33.120]  henceforth i want listeners to email me to scream at me to yell at me
[3:42:33.120 --> 3:42:37.680]  if i call him barack h obama he will now be referred to as the fraudulent
[3:42:37.680 --> 3:42:41.920]  indonesian citizen barry sataro known as barack h obama
[3:42:41.920 --> 3:42:45.680]  the long legged mac daddy is as that reverend likes to call him
[3:42:45.680 --> 3:42:49.120]  by the time i'm joking on that point that is what we're going
[3:42:49.120 --> 3:42:53.360]  to address him as because he's the figurehead for this criminal takeover
[3:42:53.360 --> 3:42:55.920]  philberg absolutely he is a figurehead people are
[3:42:55.920 --> 3:43:00.080]  telling him what to do um what alex says is is perfect here
[3:43:00.080 --> 3:43:03.280]  do everything you can in the state and and alex i'm sure you will repeat when
[3:43:03.280 --> 3:43:05.760]  we find out something that's going occurring in one state
[3:43:05.760 --> 3:43:09.600]  we can pass that along uh also in the state of america i'm not sure if it
[3:43:09.600 --> 3:43:12.160]  passed yet but there's legislation introduced there
[3:43:12.160 --> 3:43:15.360]  saying as of the 2012 presidential election
[3:43:15.360 --> 3:43:18.160]  no one can run for president arizona unless they show that they're
[3:43:18.160 --> 3:43:21.600]  constitutionally eligible yeah it's passed their uh
[3:43:21.600 --> 3:43:25.680]  their committee and it's going to the full house okay if that becomes long i
[3:43:25.680 --> 3:43:29.920]  hope it does soon then we'll take that and we'll send that out to the 50
[3:43:29.920 --> 3:43:35.520]  of top republican legislatures and and the other i'm sorry the other 49 states
[3:43:35.520 --> 3:43:39.520]  to see if they can pass out there's ways of getting out is absolutely right we
[3:43:39.520 --> 3:43:42.960]  got to do things in the various states but when we get this demonstration
[3:43:42.960 --> 3:43:45.840]  together we need a march on washington like we never
[3:43:45.840 --> 3:43:49.680]  saw before and the national media which is a control controlled by a few
[3:43:49.680 --> 3:43:53.440]  corporations will have to cover this story if not the farm press will cover
[3:43:53.440 --> 3:43:56.080]  the story the independents will cover this story
[3:43:56.080 --> 3:44:00.320]  and then we can force this issue because we can do it it was under the 10th
[3:44:00.320 --> 3:44:03.440]  amendment we the people everything else not discussed reversed
[3:44:03.440 --> 3:44:06.560]  all right the people we're gonna go to more calls here but i don't want to
[3:44:06.560 --> 3:44:10.640]  just throw the caveat out there the states have the standing because there
[3:44:10.640 --> 3:44:14.320]  are elected representatives to say no the feds because the feds are
[3:44:14.320 --> 3:44:17.280]  ordering them as an unfunded mandate to implement this
[3:44:17.280 --> 3:44:21.360]  they're taking our money and doing this it's unconstitutional but
[3:44:21.360 --> 3:44:26.800]  as citizens have their Cadillac uh policies taxed
[3:44:26.800 --> 3:44:30.320]  and some of the unions are exempt that is a massive
[3:44:30.320 --> 3:44:34.560]  civil rights discrimination suit that will overturn this as well so there's a
[3:44:34.560 --> 3:44:39.040]  million ways to skin a cat not every way will work but let's just start
[3:44:39.040 --> 3:44:42.000]  skinning and and and and politically
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:44.640]  discrediting this fraud bill in connecticut you're on the air with
[3:44:44.640 --> 3:44:48.720]  philberg of obama crimes dot com hey guys how you doing
[3:44:48.720 --> 3:44:52.480]  good hey uh alex i listened to the program earlier today

[3:46:35.600 --> 3:46:44.160]  hi good afternoon um philberg um and uh alex i thank both of you
[3:46:44.160 --> 3:46:48.160]  sincerely for all the work you're doing and for
[3:46:48.160 --> 3:46:53.680]  uh trying to get this this um information out to the public at large
[3:46:53.680 --> 3:46:57.440]  especially as it relates to barry so toro
[3:46:57.440 --> 3:47:04.800]  um we know um through the last two years that um
[3:47:04.800 --> 3:47:08.960]  most of the information that's been shared with regards to barack obama and
[3:47:08.960 --> 3:47:14.320]  most of the resource that's tried to unearth um
[3:47:14.320 --> 3:47:17.680]  various information about him has gone towards
[3:47:17.680 --> 3:47:21.360]  uh where he was born and his birth certificate
[3:47:21.360 --> 3:47:24.640]  my position is this and i've been following this
[3:47:24.640 --> 3:47:29.920]  since you first started obama crimes since you first filed your lawsuit
[3:47:29.920 --> 3:47:33.200]  i'm a former democrat big you teller again
[3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:39.760]  um uh fan and um so i started this way back when
[3:47:39.760 --> 3:47:45.360]  and following this and what what what what became abundantly clear to be
[3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:49.360]  is just some disinformation that was being sent
[3:47:49.360 --> 3:47:53.200]  out to the public at large about the birth certificate and the meaning behind
[3:47:53.200 --> 3:47:56.480]  the birth certificate because it never mattered
[3:47:56.480 --> 3:48:01.200]  from the time that young man was born he could have been born on mars for all
[3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:06.400]  i care but the whole issue has always always been
[3:48:06.400 --> 3:48:11.440]  about the adoption of lolosa toro and his mother
[3:48:11.440 --> 3:48:16.400]  forfeiting her uh former husband whoever that may have been she says it's
[3:48:16.400 --> 3:48:19.600]  barack obama senior i do not believe that
[3:48:19.600 --> 3:48:23.840]  um but she forfeited the moment she signed that
[3:48:23.840 --> 3:48:27.440]  the the adoption papers for the formal adoption
[3:48:27.440 --> 3:48:33.840]  of barack um becoming barry and moving to indonesia so i've never understood
[3:48:33.840 --> 3:48:37.760]  this whole birth or issue and never understood why
[3:48:37.760 --> 3:48:43.120]  attorneys went after a issue that was well that's because they would never
[3:48:43.120 --> 3:48:45.920]  release the original they would only release the receipt and there's a
[3:48:45.920 --> 3:48:48.560]  cover-up but i think phil agrees with you now and
[3:48:48.560 --> 3:48:51.760]  that's why i'm getting been getting fully on board because i've seen the
[3:48:51.760 --> 3:48:55.520]  evidence it's a hundred percent that he's an indonesian citizen and that makes
[3:48:55.520 --> 3:48:59.040]  him ineligible philberg that's correct and that's why it
[3:48:59.040 --> 3:49:03.760]  doesn't really matter where he was born he is adopted his name's barry so toro
[3:49:03.760 --> 3:49:07.120]  that's his legal name unless he legally changed his name also
[3:49:07.120 --> 3:49:10.720]  did he go back through immigration even if he went through immigration
[3:49:10.720 --> 3:49:13.920]  he could have only been naturalized he couldn't be natural born anymore
[3:49:13.920 --> 3:49:18.080]  because he became natural of indonesia he's a fraud he's a phony
[3:49:18.080 --> 3:49:21.040]  and one of his books he says he found his birth certificate
[3:49:21.040 --> 3:49:24.800]  he knows where he was born he knows what he's doing when you see michelle and
[3:49:24.800 --> 3:49:28.080]  him laugh they're laughing at all of us because the charades are putting on
[3:49:28.080 --> 3:49:31.280]  yeah they've always been worried about this that's why he planted that in
[3:49:31.280 --> 3:49:36.160]  books before this even happened joe in pennsylvania you're on the air

[3:54:29.920 --> 3:54:34.160]  the u.s constitution article one section nine says it's high treason if a
[3:54:34.160 --> 3:54:37.920]  president becomes an officer of any foreign government or group
[3:54:37.920 --> 3:54:41.200]  he's the first president because it's illegal to become the head of the un
[3:54:41.200 --> 3:54:44.080]  security council and they were all there and said this was
[3:54:44.080 --> 3:54:48.400]  momentous and celebrated they celebrate treason

[3:55:11.760 --> 3:55:15.680]  that understands me i wanted to real quick tell everyone about the
[3:55:15.680 --> 3:55:18.720]  caucuses everyone said you had to learn something
[3:55:18.720 --> 3:55:23.120]  i ended up i've changed my registration from independent to republican
[3:55:23.120 --> 3:55:26.880]  i didn't do any of the stuff that i thought maybe i should do but
[3:55:26.880 --> 3:55:31.520]  i decided i got my car i drove over there and by the end of the meeting at the
[3:55:31.520 --> 3:55:34.800]  caucus i'm going to be a county delegate and a
[3:55:34.800 --> 3:55:37.760]  state delegate i'm involved in some other things you
[3:55:37.760 --> 3:55:40.960]  don't have to know when you get there they're more than willing to help you
[3:55:40.960 --> 3:55:43.840]  but the other thing i want people are angry you're
[3:55:43.840 --> 3:55:46.960]  going to find like-minded people now we've got to take the government over

[3:56:18.800 --> 3:56:22.560]  there's more people against what obama is doing that are for him and we have to
[3:56:22.560 --> 3:56:26.640]  keep this on the front burner by running for office by being delegates
[3:56:26.640 --> 3:56:30.960]  by filing lawsuits by marching you you build the movement
[3:56:30.960 --> 3:56:35.520]  this is going to be it took the new world order decades to get this through
