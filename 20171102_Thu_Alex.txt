[00:00.000 --> 00:17.440]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[00:17.440 --> 00:33.000]  all right ladies and gentlemen what we have here is trucks going rogue I mean
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.600]  these trucks these trucks are out of control I don't know if you heard jake
[00:38.600 --> 00:43.360]  tapper but he was breaking it down the weight of the truck the front axle the
[00:43.360 --> 00:49.000]  rear axle how you can rent these trucks how people are now thinking about making
[00:49.000 --> 00:56.440]  it tougher to rent these trucks I'm just waiting for these anti-gun lobbies to
[00:56.440 --> 01:00.360]  be outside of Home Depot I'm sure they're planning it to be outside of
[01:00.360 --> 01:07.080]  Home Depot chanting no more trucks so I'm just waiting for that because
[01:07.080 --> 01:11.640]  obviously folks what we have here is we've got rogue trucks in fact we've got
[01:11.640 --> 01:17.840]  30 plus rogue trucks in the last couple years and it doesn't matter who's
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.880]  driving the truck what kind of racist are you to even ask that question and I'm
[01:23.880 --> 01:28.080]  starting to think that these these trucks are actually the one shouting
[01:28.080 --> 01:33.720]  a la who lock bar I don't even think it's the people inside so we've got rogue
[01:33.720 --> 01:39.040]  trucks folks they're running out of control I heard it on CNN and a la who
[01:39.040 --> 01:43.960]  lock bar is actually a beautiful thing okay and the trucks are the ones that
[01:43.960 --> 01:49.400]  are the problem here not the a la who lock bar radical Islamic terrorists no
[01:49.400 --> 01:55.080]  no of course this is what you would think if you listened to Jake Fopper
[01:55.080 --> 02:01.880]  excuse me fake tapper my bad Jake tapper Wow welcome into the Alex Jones show
[02:01.880 --> 02:09.320]  folks it's amazing here we are so much news and the news is so big and the
[02:09.320 --> 02:15.480]  news is so frequent that the biggest news every day becomes a back page story
[02:15.480 --> 02:22.400]  the next day the Las Vegas massacre cover-up nothing the JFK files being
[02:22.400 --> 02:26.960]  declassified Hitler still alive all the history textbooks we lie lied to us I
[02:26.960 --> 02:31.520]  was lied to my entire life about JFK knowingly by my government I was lied
[02:31.520 --> 02:36.200]  to my entire life about Hitler knowingly by my government and that's just a
[02:36.200 --> 02:41.160]  non-story now because you've got another radical truck running people down in
[02:41.160 --> 02:44.320]  the streets folks I'm Owen Troyer filling in for Alex Jones today but do not
[02:44.320 --> 02:49.280]  be afraid because we have a ton of great guests today we will be hearing from
[02:49.280 --> 02:54.240]  Alex Jones in the next segment and then David Knight will be joining me in
[02:54.240 --> 02:59.400]  studio Paul Joseph Watson will be Skyping in from Europe where the trucks
[02:59.400 --> 03:02.000]  are out of control in Europe folks we got to do something about these trucks
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.320]  before they make it here Leigh Ann McAdoo will be in studio with me at one
[03:06.320 --> 03:11.400]  Roger Stone joins me at 130 and then from NoMoreFakeNews.com John Rappaport
[03:11.400 --> 03:15.800]  takes over in the fourth hour there is a little bit of intrigue actually right
[03:15.800 --> 03:21.480]  now surrounding this terrorist attack in New York no it wasn't a truck that's
[03:21.480 --> 03:26.560]  guilty it was another radical Islamic terrorist now the wife is saying she's
[03:26.560 --> 03:30.280]  shocked neighbors are saying the family was acting very mysterious so you
[03:30.280 --> 03:34.480]  wonder what she actually knew how much they knew at the mosque then you've
[03:34.480 --> 03:38.240]  get the you got this story I totally get what he did Moscow or who knew tear
[03:38.240 --> 03:43.480]  truck driver rails against President Bush's Middle East policy and this is
[03:43.480 --> 03:48.640]  actually the funny thing this is where the radical Islamic terrorist and the
[03:48.640 --> 03:54.400]  radical left actually see eye-to-eye but the funny thing is the people that
[03:54.400 --> 03:59.280]  don't like President Bush's Middle East policy I'm one of them the people on
[03:59.280 --> 04:03.680]  the left though don't have the common sense don't have the logic to realize
[04:03.680 --> 04:07.880]  hey there's people in those countries that don't like President Bush's
[04:07.880 --> 04:12.640]  Middle East policy either that might want to come here and kill me well you
[04:12.640 --> 04:19.160]  just experienced another one of them in New York so will the political left
[04:19.160 --> 04:24.720]  wake up to the fact that yes our Middle East policy pisses these people off and
[04:24.720 --> 04:30.080]  makes them want to come here and murder us and it's not virtue to want to bring
[04:30.080 --> 04:36.720]  them here and die okay that's ignorant that's stupid that's a moron that's an
[04:36.720 --> 04:42.640]  idiot you can go on and then I mean it's honestly it's really the the religion
[04:42.640 --> 04:48.480]  of Islam is really so peaceful that now in Egypt they're saying it's okay to
[04:48.480 --> 04:53.640]  just rape girls it's a national duty in fact that's on info wars calm don't go

[06:30.280 --> 06:35.400]  and don't want psychopaths ruling our planet we are entering the core of the
[06:35.400 --> 06:39.600]  fight now as we pointed out the pedophile scandals were set to break in
[06:39.600 --> 06:43.920]  the last year in Hollywood that dam is breaking Trump is delivering turning
[06:43.920 --> 06:49.520]  good law enforcement loose on these rings the pedophile rings form the
[06:49.520 --> 06:55.240]  governance system of these networks and are the heart of their blackmail
[06:55.240 --> 06:59.760]  operation just like regular gangs go out and rob liquor stores to prove that
[06:59.760 --> 07:03.800]  they're part of the gang and are now initiated into a crime so they can be
[07:03.800 --> 07:08.960]  compromised the same way with the pedophile networks that form the heart
[07:08.960 --> 07:15.360]  of the EU the UK and the US Canadian Australian control grid that cult of
[07:15.360 --> 07:20.080]  controls under direct assault now the NFL and every other globalist
[07:20.080 --> 07:23.280]  organization has lined up against America and lined up against President
[07:23.280 --> 07:27.600]  Trump in an attempt to bully us back into submission but as I've pointed out
[07:27.600 --> 07:33.800]  the revolutionary systems of mental illness that they created the psychological
[07:33.800 --> 07:38.240]  warfare vats that are the colleges and mainstream media in Hollywood if they
[07:38.240 --> 07:43.040]  could be contained would begin to eat each other would begin to turn on each
[07:43.040 --> 07:47.360]  other and I've seen the signs the last three months of the power structure
[07:47.360 --> 07:53.120]  turning against the Clintons this is absolutely critical and we've gone over
[07:53.120 --> 07:57.200]  all those developments but the biggest one yet is on drudgereport.com right now
[07:57.200 --> 08:02.680]  from Politico it's also on news wars dot com inside Hillary Clinton's secret
[08:02.680 --> 08:09.080]  takeover of the DNC again they call us fake news constantly because we're
[08:09.080 --> 08:13.520]  absolutely on target and research their actual activities but all of you watch
[08:13.520 --> 08:16.840]  it as well and many of you have more pieces of the puzzle than I do but they
[08:16.840 --> 08:22.640]  stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders in scores of states that he won
[08:22.640 --> 08:28.640]  from New Hampshire to California and we even got national electors to admit on
[08:28.640 --> 08:33.440]  camera they didn't matter if he won a bunch of states early on that they would
[08:33.440 --> 08:38.520]  just be given to Hillary and indeed he would win states by 10 15 20 points she
[08:38.520 --> 08:46.560]  would be given more delegates than he was so now Brazil coming out and saying
[08:46.560 --> 08:50.760]  that Hillary Clinton rigged the nomination process took over the
[08:50.760 --> 08:55.560]  Democratic Party and stole the election when these two women act like their best
[08:55.560 --> 08:59.100]  friends they're all a bunch of psychopathic sociopathic banshees the
[08:59.100 --> 09:02.840]  literal harpy demons the fact that they're turning on each other publicly
[09:02.840 --> 09:07.440]  shows they realize the Clintons are continuing to destroy their party at the
[09:07.440 --> 09:11.640]  accelerated rate remember it's Brazil that went on TV and said CNN didn't give
[09:11.640 --> 09:15.200]  the debate questions to Hillary and lied for when Brazil had been involved
[09:15.200 --> 09:21.200]  carrying it out so again Podesta's in trouble his brother's in trouble she's
[09:21.200 --> 09:25.000]  in trouble they're all in trouble and who are they attacking they're attacking
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.160]  info wars because they know we've got their number well this is the fight I
[09:28.160 --> 09:31.600]  was looking for but the fact that they're now turning on each other just
[09:31.600 --> 09:35.440]  like drudge ran our headline last week about Democratic elite turns on the
[09:35.440 --> 09:41.800]  Clintons you're now seeing that manifest big time and so you add this into the
[09:41.800 --> 09:46.600]  EU falling apart and Briggs it and the Austrian elections going for
[09:46.600 --> 09:51.360]  nationalism and patriotism and Catalan and what they're doing and what we just
[09:51.360 --> 09:56.400]  saw yeah in places like Italy with two referendums saying no to the EU
[09:56.400 --> 10:02.240]  expansion and the Czech Republic vote for a patriot I mean this is happening
[10:02.240 --> 10:04.960]  and you hear what these people are saying that are becoming presidents and
[10:04.960 --> 10:10.080]  prime ministers it's like it's the Alex Jones show now again let me explain
[10:10.080 --> 10:14.440]  something what's critical I don't say that to brag I say it so we could
[10:14.440 --> 10:19.120]  understand how effective all of you have been and the fact that we're not
[10:19.120 --> 10:24.040]  being infiltrated by foreign governments our ideas of Americana coming back
[10:24.040 --> 10:27.280]  that everybody always wanted to be part of it everybody wanted to come here and
[10:27.280 --> 10:32.240]  be part of I didn't invent this I'm just helping with you rebooted with all the
[10:32.240 --> 10:35.440]  other great patriots that have helped break through the globalist wall like
[10:35.440 --> 10:40.600]  Donald Trump and Matt Drudge and and Sean Hannity and Steven Bannon and the
[10:40.600 --> 10:45.320]  Info Wars crew and world net daily and everybody else this has been an
[10:45.320 --> 10:48.360]  incredible time standing up to their bullying the fights only getting more
[10:48.360 --> 10:52.000]  intense right now but we have turned the tide the enemy could still reverse it
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.960]  but this is a celebration I mean state-run Russian TV is running large
[10:57.960 --> 11:02.160]  clips of my show about the New World Order and the globalist and the banksters
[11:02.160 --> 11:08.160]  every week that isn't Russia infiltrating us that's Americana baby the
[11:08.160 --> 11:11.880]  same one that helped bring down the Soviet Union I mean just a shadow of
[11:11.880 --> 11:16.480]  Americana helped bring on the Levi's and Coca-Cola that's not America America's
[11:16.480 --> 11:19.400]  free market and religious freedom and being honorable being rugged
[11:19.400 --> 11:24.120]  individuals with they're not infiltrating us America is coming back
[11:24.120 --> 11:30.360]  worldwide ladies and gentlemen and when you sell Americana versus globalism we
[11:30.360 --> 11:35.600]  win every time this is a sales job and we're selling liberty versus tyranny
[11:35.600 --> 11:39.960]  so again ultra massive story how they rigged it confirming everything we ever
[11:39.960 --> 11:44.600]  said but again they did it in plain view now continuing they've had Newsweek
[11:44.600 --> 11:49.240]  salon all the usual Soros mouthpieces come out and say that I lied and said
[11:49.240 --> 11:53.600]  that there was a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for Trump's overthrow
[11:53.600 --> 11:58.120]  beginning November 4th now ladies and gentlemen we've checked online on the
[11:58.120 --> 12:02.000]  New York Times site they did run the full-page ad again this is about them
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.800]  thinking they control reality so that our forces don't get ready and aren't
[12:06.800 --> 12:10.880]  peacefully watching what happens and so we're asleep on Saturday when they try
[12:10.880 --> 12:15.280]  to launch this thing they'll go for the next few months of their own words with
[12:15.280 --> 12:19.720]  top Republicans telling Roger Stone they intend to remove Trump by December so
[12:19.720 --> 12:24.280]  again it's a military tactic to announce to their forces they're gonna move with
[12:24.280 --> 12:28.720]  violence and destabilization but to tell us it's not happening it's all a
[12:28.720 --> 12:33.040]  mind game but we've got photos and scans of it up on m4wars.com and it real
[12:33.040 --> 12:37.200]  Alex Jones on Twitter and that dovetails with a daily drumbeat on CNN
[12:37.200 --> 12:42.700]  MSNBC you name it and now on m4wars.com we have an article Snoop Dogg make
[12:42.700 --> 12:47.720]  America Crip again with an image of Trump dead laying on a stretcher with a
[12:47.720 --> 12:54.120]  co-tag with a death stamp on it I mean this is just another nobody thug want
[12:54.120 --> 12:57.240]  to be tough guy that helps sell the gangster culture to black folks the
[12:57.240 --> 13:01.080]  last 25 years to help put tens of millions of people in prison total CIA
[13:01.080 --> 13:05.640]  operation right out of LA with the with the crack cocaine being shipped in it's
[13:05.640 --> 13:10.560]  it's all an absolute fact Snoop Dogg's a prison guard to make young black people
[13:10.560 --> 13:15.440]  think this is cool to lock them up Snoop Dogg will be wearing a giant KKK white
[13:15.440 --> 13:19.760]  hat and I'm serious it's come out the LBJ plan to ship drugs into the black
[13:19.760 --> 13:22.760]  communities get them on welfare and destroy them and then have all this
[13:22.760 --> 13:27.000]  gangster culture sold by the 80s and 90s to totally destroy black people and now
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.200]  that's been a beta test they're doing it everybody else using the weaponized
[13:30.200 --> 13:33.880]  fake gangster black culture what a piece of garbage but that feeds into all
[13:33.880 --> 13:37.560]  this kill Trump constant garbage and trying to push a race war and Clarence
[13:37.560 --> 13:40.720]  Thomas coming out and saying he doesn't even recognize America with the
[13:40.720 --> 13:45.920]  incredible division that's how globalist bring a country down ladies and
[13:45.920 --> 13:50.240]  gentlemen but the good news is Trump is getting ready to move with anti trust
[13:50.240 --> 13:53.600]  against Google and others for their censorship and Facebook and Twitter
[13:53.600 --> 13:57.720]  they've been doing it in triplicate I'm not defending AT&T and Time Warner I
[13:57.720 --> 14:01.160]  can't stand Time Warner they're globalist but the Justice Department not
[14:01.160 --> 14:05.080]  even Trump controlling it has been going after and is now talking about an
[14:05.080 --> 14:10.200]  anti-trust suit or a breakup of those companies are not letting emerge when
[14:10.200 --> 14:16.120]  they have not one half the power of Google alone I mean Google has 90% of
[14:16.120 --> 14:22.400]  internet activity and here in the US and ladies and gentlemen they already are
[14:22.400 --> 14:26.440]  dominating and controlling and trying to consolidate so Google is the big one
[14:26.440 --> 14:30.640]  Facebook and Twitter they're anti-american globalist organizations that
[14:30.640 --> 14:34.400]  have to be brought to the line and have to stop their draconian activities now

[20:59.800 --> 21:08.680]  culture Egyptian lawyer says raping girls is a national duty yes really and
[21:08.680 --> 21:15.800]  just trying to recall exactly I'm pretty sure that the new Egyptian regime was
[21:15.800 --> 21:21.480]  actually a regime that the United States government under Obama was influencing
[21:21.480 --> 21:28.400]  the change of regimes there no problem with that though no American influence
[21:28.400 --> 21:34.600]  in that that's perfectly fine only the Russians are bad but funny I don't see
[21:34.600 --> 21:39.440]  stories coming out of Russia with Russian lawyers saying raping girls is a
[21:39.440 --> 21:44.960]  national duty and unfortunately under the new Egyptian regime they're getting
[21:44.960 --> 21:50.000]  more radical Islamic than they have been in the past but this is a clip now this
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.760]  clip is actually spoken in English I'm gonna have to read the subtitles and
[21:54.760 --> 21:59.640]  translate it for you but yes this really happened Egyptian lawyer says raping
[21:59.640 --> 22:07.640]  girls is a national duty are you happy when you see a girl walking down the
[22:07.640 --> 22:14.280]  street with half of her behind showing do you think that we can care about our
[22:14.280 --> 22:19.520]  girls I say that when a girl walks about like that it is a patriotic duty to
[22:19.520 --> 22:24.720]  sexually harass her and a national duty to rape her it is a national duty to
[22:24.720 --> 22:29.240]  rape such a girl what she allows herself to do constitutes depravity there
[22:29.240 --> 22:31.480]  you go
[22:33.920 --> 22:40.680]  hmm the political left claims that they stick up for women's rights Linda
[22:40.680 --> 22:45.840]  sarsour claims that she is all about women's freedom women's rights women's
[22:45.840 --> 22:52.560]  empowerment so I guess it's empowering in Egypt if you're a female to walk
[22:52.560 --> 22:58.600]  around whether you consider it scantily clad or not if you're showing skin they
[22:58.600 --> 23:02.680]  consider that scantily clad and there you just heard it you will get raped
[23:02.680 --> 23:06.120]  because that's what you deserve
[23:06.120 --> 23:17.280]  huh do you see why we can't just have open borders here folks okay do you see
[23:17.280 --> 23:22.160]  why we can't have a mandated diversity program started by the Democrats
[23:22.160 --> 23:28.120]  praised by Chuck Schumer and now Donald Trump is going to end it do you see why
[23:28.120 --> 23:37.480]  not only do we deal with people that hate us because of the Bush regime starting
[23:37.480 --> 23:45.240]  a war a non-stop never ending war in the Middle East but also their culture does
[23:45.240 --> 23:53.480]  not fit with our culture think about what do you think is going to happen if a
[23:53.480 --> 24:03.960]  bunch of Muslim men radical Muslim men Orthodox Islam come here are walking
[24:03.960 --> 24:07.400]  down the street and then they see your young daughter and her friends wearing
[24:07.400 --> 24:14.120]  short skirts and halter tops and what have you well in their culture it's a
[24:14.120 --> 24:22.280]  national duty to rape them and now you see why Sweden is the rape capital of
[24:22.280 --> 24:29.600]  the world it's honestly maddening it's honestly maddening because look at this
[24:29.600 --> 24:33.960]  in fact let's go to this right now there is an all-out assault on men right now
[24:33.960 --> 24:39.160]  folks okay and not the is Islamic kind in fact if you're a radical Islamic man
[24:39.160 --> 24:43.160]  you're probably fine but if you're a white male specifically you're probably
[24:43.160 --> 24:46.920]  the bad guy and that's what I really think all this Harvey Weinstein thing is
[24:46.920 --> 24:51.080]  about to not just deflect off the pedophilia that's going on there but
[24:51.080 --> 24:56.280]  also to attack men masculinity because you can't have a masculine man and then
[24:56.280 --> 25:00.640]  bully everybody if you try to bully a group of people and there's one masculine
[25:00.640 --> 25:03.640]  man there you're not going to get away with it the bully will be shut down but
[25:03.640 --> 25:11.600]  here's Michelle Obama nothing on Egypt but says men are entitled and self-righteous
[25:11.600 --> 25:18.280]  because women protect them too much here's Michael excuse me Michelle Obama
[25:18.280 --> 25:26.240]  and we want to in the world today is we we we love our boys and we raise our
[25:26.240 --> 25:32.440]  girls you know we raise them to be you talking about we take care not to hurt
[25:32.440 --> 25:38.840]  men and and I think we pay for that a little bit and that's a wee thing because
[25:38.840 --> 25:44.280]  we're raising them you know and it's powerful to have strong men but what
[25:44.280 --> 25:48.840]  does that strength mean you know does it mean respect does it mean responsibility
[25:48.840 --> 25:54.440]  does it mean compassion or are we protecting our men too much so they
[25:54.440 --> 25:59.880]  feel a little entitled and a little you know you know a little self-righteous
[25:59.880 --> 26:07.320]  sometimes but that's kind of on us too as as as women and others yeah you know
[26:07.320 --> 26:16.160]  as we nurture men and push girls to be perfect hmm okay that didn't even make
[26:16.160 --> 26:23.560]  sense so there's a Michael Obama Michael Obama sitting there in a lumberjack
[26:23.560 --> 26:29.280]  shirt this doesn't make sense see that's what I'm telling you they don't even the
[26:29.280 --> 26:35.200]  the agenda here is to constantly attack men constantly berate men and demonize
[26:35.200 --> 26:39.000]  what they're gonna consider toxic masculinity which is just any man who's
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.600]  not willing to get bullied any man who's willing to stand for a cause any man
[26:42.600 --> 26:46.920]  that's willing to stand for anything really you can't stand for something
[26:46.920 --> 26:51.360]  you're gonna fall for anything so they don't want you to stand for anything so
[26:51.360 --> 26:57.080]  you will fall for anything like I don't know Trump Russia collusion a lone
[26:57.080 --> 27:01.720]  shooter in the JFK assassination lone shooter in the Vegas massacre a bunch
[27:01.720 --> 27:07.840]  of bull see they can't lie to you and beat you down into the ground under
[27:07.840 --> 27:12.440]  their under their thumb if you're masculine no they have to berate men
[27:12.440 --> 27:18.400]  and tear men down but what does she even talk about the reason why it makes no
[27:18.400 --> 27:24.560]  sense is because she's on the agenda to attack men beat men down constantly any
[27:24.560 --> 27:29.000]  angle you can find any chance you get so she's up here bumbling and fumbling
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.880]  around like some sort of jack wagon because she's not meant to make sense
[27:33.880 --> 27:40.440]  it's just meant to attack men that is the goal so it doesn't matter it doesn't
[27:40.440 --> 27:45.520]  matter that these people Michelle Obama's ilk want to bring in people from
[27:45.520 --> 27:48.800]  radical Islamic countries and if you don't like that then you're a racist
[27:48.800 --> 27:53.320]  even though Islam isn't a race yeah there's the there's the lumberjack
[27:53.320 --> 27:57.440]  Michael Obama just got done shopping wood if you know what I'm saying and
[27:57.440 --> 28:02.920]  she'll say nothing though about the rape culture that has followed
[28:02.920 --> 28:08.000]  multiculturalism in Sweden she'll say nothing about the rape culture in the
[28:08.000 --> 28:14.360]  Islamic State of Egypt now where a lawyer says that a raping a girl is a
[28:14.360 --> 28:21.440]  national duty I mean this is sick I'm not trying to be you know again insensitive
[28:21.440 --> 28:26.560]  here but I'm sorry but Michelle have you seen the way your daughter behaves and
[28:26.560 --> 28:32.400]  dresses what do you think would happen to her in an Islamic country what do you
[28:32.400 --> 28:35.720]  think would happen to your daughters if they are really your daughters what do
[28:35.720 --> 28:38.680]  you think would happen to them if they were walking around Egypt where they
[28:38.680 --> 28:42.640]  now say if you can see their skin or they're wearing tight pants that they
[28:42.640 --> 28:48.240]  should be raped and that's national duty show Obama's not hearing that men are
[28:48.240 --> 28:52.840]  the problem we need to beat our men down we can't let them grow up to be
[28:52.840 --> 29:00.120]  masculine how dare a man be masculine hey Daniel Brieman why new mana

[33:24.480 --> 33:29.520]  couple guys here at the office that drive trucks and I'm starting to become
[33:29.520 --> 33:34.440]  very afraid I am and I think that they need to turn their truck in for something
[33:34.440 --> 33:37.560]  that won't run me over in the streets like we're seeing in Europe and in the
[33:37.560 --> 33:43.760]  United States don't you dare blame radical Islam for this okay because Jake
[33:43.760 --> 33:48.120]  Tapper will be all over you but in the break David and I were talking about
[33:48.120 --> 33:53.520]  how there is a plan to stop the free travel of the US citizen essentially
[33:53.520 --> 33:57.320]  bring in automated cars use all the times of different excuses to say that
[33:57.320 --> 34:01.680]  you're a liability behind the wheel of a car and now we're starting to hear
[34:01.680 --> 34:05.560]  stories of individuals being blocked from some of these ride services right
[34:05.560 --> 34:08.920]  because of their politics yes it's not just Twitter it's not just Twitter and
[34:08.920 --> 34:12.840]  YouTube and Facebook where they're shutting people down understand that
[34:12.840 --> 34:16.240]  right now we're talking about them censoring free speech and of course
[34:16.240 --> 34:19.640]  there's been interesting revelation coming out in the last couple of days as
[34:19.640 --> 34:23.600]  Twitter officials were talking about the Russian hacking of the election they
[34:23.600 --> 34:28.400]  admitted oh you know we were shutting down 50% of the tweets about Hillary
[34:28.400 --> 34:32.600]  we're shutting down 25% of the tweets about Podesta's emails and blocking
[34:32.600 --> 34:35.120]  people that were tweeting about it too that's right that's right so you know
[34:35.120 --> 34:38.440]  we know that there's political censorship going on and as I've been
[34:38.440 --> 34:44.240]  talking about the effort to take away our ability to own cars to drive them
[34:44.240 --> 34:48.520]  ourselves because they want to be in control of everything in our lives and
[34:48.520 --> 34:52.000]  that's a very important issue because once they take away private ownership
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.360]  once they turn us over to their corporate cronies who will own the cars
[34:56.360 --> 35:01.200]  and they will charge us by the mile by the minute they'll attack and attack
[35:01.200 --> 35:05.360]  and track everything that we do yeah I think it's interesting we see Laura
[35:05.360 --> 35:10.040]  Loomer now has been banned by Uber and Lyft because of something she put on
[35:10.040 --> 35:15.120]  Twitter so it's come full circle they use Twitter to they draw you into these
[35:15.120 --> 35:19.640]  platforms of Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and then they suppress any
[35:19.640 --> 35:23.720]  speech that they don't like and then if you criticize Uber and Lyft and of
[35:23.720 --> 35:27.520]  course you know whether or not you agree with what Lauren Loomer said she said
[35:27.520 --> 35:30.760]  that somebody needs to create a non-Islamic form of Uber or Lyft because
[35:30.760 --> 35:34.400]  I never want to support another Islamic immigrant driver so what they did was
[35:34.400 --> 35:40.920]  they shut her off of both Uber and Lyft understand that when the government gets
[35:40.920 --> 35:44.560]  control of your mobility and I've said this from the very beginning it'll be
[35:44.560 --> 35:49.080]  either the government or it'll be their crony corporate partners that they work
[35:49.080 --> 35:52.840]  with because they're working together to push this down your throat whether you
[35:52.840 --> 35:56.400]  like it or not many people say hey I'm never gonna have a car that drives
[35:56.400 --> 35:59.560]  itself I'm never gonna buy into that you're gonna have a trendy it's trendy
[35:59.560 --> 36:03.520]  that's right yeah all this stuff about hey you like your car you can keep your
[36:03.520 --> 36:07.000]  car you like your truck you can keep it there's pushing all this that's
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.080]  familiar and you know they're pushing the idea that they're gonna ban cars and
[36:11.080 --> 36:15.040]  trucks in cities it'll be done for a variety of reasons right now they're
[36:15.040 --> 36:18.720]  doing it across Europe because they say we got to protect you from the pollution
[36:18.720 --> 36:23.040]  but it's also going to be a security measure and then once they do that if
[36:23.040 --> 36:27.800]  they don't like you you won't be able to get a job they will shadow ban you just
[36:27.800 --> 36:31.720]  like they shadow ban the hashtags understand you may not even know that
[36:31.720 --> 36:35.600]  you've been banned you may say hey you know I called for this taxi to come pick
[36:35.600 --> 36:39.280]  me up and I still haven't gotten it I don't know really what's going on and
[36:39.280 --> 36:43.240]  then oh and when we look at this I don't know if you saw this report that came
[36:43.240 --> 36:46.880]  out there's a married couple that said we think that Facebook is listening to us
[36:46.880 --> 36:50.600]  so they did a little bit of a a test they don't have a cat they never talked
[36:50.600 --> 36:55.360]  about cats and so they put a thing out where for a day or two they're talking
[36:55.360 --> 36:58.880]  for an entire day they talk about cat the cat is almost out of food we should
[36:58.880 --> 37:01.720]  buy some cat food so forth and so on they said the next day they started
[37:01.720 --> 37:07.040]  getting served ads for cat food and so they said we're being listened to by
[37:07.040 --> 37:11.320]  Facebook and of course Facebook comes out and said absolutely no way and it's
[37:11.320 --> 37:15.880]  not the first time somebody has done that no I have actually ran an exact same
[37:15.880 --> 37:20.360]  experiment with my friend where we were we were both in the car and driving I
[37:20.360 --> 37:23.760]  don't have Facebook anymore but he had Facebook on his phone and we were both
[37:23.760 --> 37:26.880]  talking about an old this was probably a couple years ago we were both talking
[37:26.880 --> 37:30.160]  about an old high school friend of ours yeah and we hadn't talked to this
[37:30.160 --> 37:35.680]  individual in years and all of a sudden he pops up we finished the car ride he
[37:35.680 --> 37:41.240]  pops up as a friend possible friend on Facebook it just happens to pop up right
[37:41.240 --> 37:45.520]  there after so we saw that and we were like no way so we kind of did something
[37:45.520 --> 37:48.680]  like these people did yeah and again we started talking about another person
[37:48.680 --> 37:52.600]  boom that person popped up under the friend request so I don't know what kind
[37:52.600 --> 37:55.840]  of algorithms I mean I haven't read the I don't have Facebook but if you read the
[37:55.840 --> 38:00.720]  privacy policy probably says in there you know we're gonna have access to your
[38:00.720 --> 38:04.880]  other apps they say they're not doing it but the question is oh they're doing it
[38:04.880 --> 38:09.160]  believe your lying eyes or this corporation that has a vested interest in
[38:09.160 --> 38:12.560]  this and of course you can do your own experiment just as Owen did or just as
[38:12.560 --> 38:16.280]  these people you be shocked yourself yeah that's absolutely amazing and of
[38:16.280 --> 38:19.480]  course here's another thing it's Google to Google does it too yeah you talk about
[38:19.480 --> 38:25.120]  how the how it's you know years ago Eric Schmidt said that at Google we're
[38:25.120 --> 38:29.720]  gonna get right up to the line of creepy well they've gone way beyond that many
[38:29.720 --> 38:33.200]  many times and when you look at what's happening get another good example
[38:33.200 --> 38:37.880]  another big corporation Apple their new phone the iPhone X they came out of
[38:37.880 --> 38:41.960]  course it has facial recognition they said well we're not going to have that
[38:41.960 --> 38:45.600]  data transmitted back to Apple so all the privacy experts say oh good for you
[38:45.600 --> 38:48.020]  you're gonna keep that private you're gonna keep it on the phone well you know
[38:48.020 --> 38:52.400]  as William Benny has told us many times nothing on your phone is safe nothing
[38:52.400 --> 38:58.080]  on your phone is private and now they are admitting it's come out that any app
[38:58.080 --> 39:01.400]  developers have access to this even though it's stored on your phone and
[39:01.400 --> 39:06.560]  it's not on the cloud an app developer can still use this and can still get all
[39:06.560 --> 39:10.520]  this information so what difference does that make because of course it's gonna
[39:10.520 --> 39:13.680]  be buried in the service agreements right Owen they're gonna say well we can
[39:13.680 --> 39:17.600]  have access to your biometrics it's a misnomer for Facebook to say oh we don't
[39:17.600 --> 39:20.760]  listen to your conversations it's a misnomer for Apple to say oh we don't
[39:20.760 --> 39:23.520]  share your facial recognition technology with anyone but what they do is they
[39:23.520 --> 39:27.400]  already have these deals and you can actually see this in the privacy the
[39:27.400 --> 39:33.080]  terms of use that you sign they specifically say that these apps these
[39:33.080 --> 39:40.200]  other apps will be allowed access to the data that is acquired via Facebook or
[39:40.200 --> 39:45.720]  the facial recognition so okay oh yeah technically Facebook isn't eavesdropping
[39:45.720 --> 39:50.280]  Facebook isn't listening it's the Google app that's listening and then
[39:50.280 --> 39:55.080]  Facebook takes that data puts it into their algorithms and then produces that
[39:55.080 --> 39:59.040]  content for you so it's kind of just like a past the buck situation where
[39:59.040 --> 40:02.280]  there's only one or two apps it's on everyone phone that's listening and then
[40:02.280 --> 40:07.120]  all the other apps have access to that data and you give them that access when
[40:07.120 --> 40:11.640]  you agree to the terms of use it's a shell game it's semantics they say well
[40:11.640 --> 40:14.320]  we're not listening as your point that's why I mentioned the thing about iPhone
[40:14.320 --> 40:18.320]  iPhone says well we're not we're not gonna have anything to do with your
[40:18.320 --> 40:22.320]  facial recognition data we're not gonna have anything about your biometric data
[40:22.320 --> 40:26.680]  we're not gonna store that but oh by the way all of our apps will have access to
[40:26.680 --> 40:30.640]  it and they can do whatever they want now we're trusting that these apps will
[40:30.640 --> 40:35.080]  ask for your permission and of course you've read all of the all of the
[40:35.080 --> 40:39.040]  detailed legal agreements and licensing agreements on all the apps that you've
[40:39.040 --> 40:42.760]  got on your phone right well actually there's a few that I do read because what
[40:42.760 --> 40:45.560]  they do now is they have to tell you access to this this and this and of
[40:45.560 --> 40:49.040]  course I still download the app but you read it and you're just like I mean
[40:49.040 --> 40:55.400]  it honestly yeah you feel guilty when you say okay I'll download this app even
[40:55.400 --> 40:58.360]  though you just said you're literally gonna take all the data off of my phone
[40:58.360 --> 41:02.440]  and you know this whole iPhone X thing to me David has been very strange because
[41:02.440 --> 41:07.880]  Apple still is having a hard time selling the iPhone 8 they've been
[41:07.880 --> 41:13.000]  behind sales on the iPhone 8 since they launched that and then they come out
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.440]  with the iPhone X to me prematurely when they still have a stock of iPhone 8's
[41:17.440 --> 41:22.560]  they don't get the immediate rush they thought they cut their production in
[41:22.560 --> 41:27.000]  half then they sell that and they say oh look at demand for the iPhone X it's
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.600]  huge it's huge that was a whole rigged game too because they actually had to
[41:30.600 --> 41:35.680]  cut back their production so but I'm wondering David I have I'll say I have a
[41:35.680 --> 41:41.440]  conspiracy theory that Apple released the iPhone X early because they see the
[41:41.440 --> 41:45.720]  backlash and the awareness now that people have with the control of social
[41:45.720 --> 41:49.040]  media and the access to all of your personal information and so they wanted
[41:49.040 --> 41:52.600]  to inject the iPhone X out into the public as soon as possible with the
[41:52.600 --> 41:56.120]  facial recognition technology even though the iPhone 8 is still not selling
[41:56.120 --> 41:59.960]  because they had to get that out there to the other developers they had to get
[41:59.960 --> 42:03.960]  that facial recognition technology out there for everyone to have it before
[42:03.960 --> 42:09.040]  people hit the full panic mode like no stay out of my life I know you're
[42:09.040 --> 42:13.000]  you're breaking my constitutional rights yeah you know quite frankly I'm not
[42:13.000 --> 42:17.000]  gonna get involved in something that's going to collect my biometric data and
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.840]  get the iPhone 10 huh no you know interestingly enough you know I was an
[42:20.840 --> 42:25.200]  engineer because I love technology right I always looked at it as a force for
[42:25.200 --> 42:29.080]  good I don't anymore I don't because I see what these corporations are doing
[42:29.080 --> 42:32.760]  with it I see who controls this technology and so even though I was there
[42:32.760 --> 42:38.200]  on day one for the first several iPhone releases I'm not interested anymore
[42:38.200 --> 42:41.240]  quite frankly it's kind of become boring technology Steve Wozniak when the
[42:41.240 --> 42:45.040]  co-founders of Apple said now he's not interested in getting another one he's
[42:45.040 --> 42:50.280]  it's just become a maintenance cash cow for these guys and then of course it
[42:50.280 --> 42:53.560]  spies on you and takes your facial recognition that's the big issue that's
[42:53.560 --> 42:58.680]  the big issue we'll be right back with more of the Ox Jones show now ladies and

[47:03.560 --> 47:21.200]  Jones show live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[47:21.400 --> 47:27.560]  the amount of lying that goes on on some television news networks and in our
[47:27.560 --> 47:32.280]  government is honestly disgusting for example they are trying to paint a
[47:32.280 --> 47:39.160]  picture that Facebook ads were purchased to influence the election towards
[47:39.160 --> 47:46.680]  Donald Trump however strangely enough Facebook admits that the Russian ads were
[47:46.680 --> 47:54.200]  actually against Donald Trump. Ads pro Clinton anti Clinton or could you tell
[47:54.200 --> 48:03.040]  or these activities viewed in the aggregate the activity again really
[48:03.040 --> 48:08.800]  appears to address a wide range of hot button topics and appears directed at
[48:08.800 --> 48:13.880]  at at fomenting the Facebook representative aiming discourse in
[48:13.880 --> 48:18.640]  terms of volume again what how much volume are we talking about Lindsey
[48:18.640 --> 48:29.280]  Graham about approximately 90% of the volume we saw on the ad side appears to
[48:29.280 --> 48:34.440]  be issues-based primarily a much smaller proportion were directed at particular
[48:34.440 --> 48:38.760]  candidates but in terms of the actual Facebook assets I think some I said one
[48:38.760 --> 48:43.960]  in 23,000 I don't know maybe that was another company correct so in terms of
[48:43.960 --> 48:48.120]  the total volume of material on the side it's a very small percentage we
[48:48.120 --> 48:55.640]  estimate that the internet research agency content it was approximately 0.004
[48:55.640 --> 49:00.680]  percent of the content in newsfeed I'm sure that really influenced the election
[49:00.680 --> 49:08.480]  so to sum this up and I'll come back with a jihadist around to Russia as a
[49:08.480 --> 49:15.200]  nation-state started interfering in the election cycle back in 2015 just saying
[49:15.200 --> 49:20.080]  that is and they continued after the election during the election they were
[49:20.080 --> 49:25.360]  trying to create discord between Americans most of it directed against
[49:25.360 --> 49:32.240]  Clinton after the Democrats dividing America Russia tied groups and
[49:32.240 --> 49:36.560]  organizations trying to undermine President Trump's legitimacy is that
[49:36.560 --> 49:42.160]  what you saw on Facebook say that's an accurate statement doesn't accurate
[49:42.160 --> 49:49.720]  statement I'm not sure I can characterize of on our network which way the
[49:49.720 --> 49:56.120]  it's a man from Google thank you what okay that was just great
[49:57.480 --> 50:02.600]  sorry I didn't think wow so basically there you have it even though Lindsey
[50:02.600 --> 50:06.960]  Graham was trying to insert that idea that Russia's dividing Russia's buying
[50:06.960 --> 50:10.720]  the ad then the Facebook I admits like actually it was all anti-Trump stuff
[50:10.720 --> 50:15.320]  90% of it was anti-Trump stuff but they're not gonna say that on CNN or
[50:15.320 --> 50:19.960]  MSNBC tonight they're gonna continue to force upon us this false narrative that
[50:19.960 --> 50:25.240]  Russia was the one that influenced our election it was all Russia David you
[50:25.240 --> 50:27.680]  don't even exist did you know that I thought it was interesting you didn't
[50:27.680 --> 50:32.080]  vote that's right you never covered a Trump rally you don't exist well you
[50:32.080 --> 50:36.160]  know it's interesting what he said was well it was 0.004 percent in other
[50:36.160 --> 50:40.760]  words for 1,000th of a percent that's cutting it pretty small isn't it and it's
[50:40.760 --> 50:44.800]  coming from these are ads that they purchased and of course they've now
[50:44.800 --> 50:49.920]  revealed that there was a Russian troll farm that was operating a page that was
[50:49.920 --> 50:53.920]  organizing anti-Trump rallies in New York so yeah it was anti-Trump but I
[50:53.920 --> 50:57.560]  think this is interesting oh and when we look at this he's talking about ads
[50:57.560 --> 50:59.920]  that were purchased and they're saying you know hundred thousand ads or whatever
[50:59.920 --> 51:04.960]  but what we find from these hearings also is that Twitter is reporting that
[51:04.960 --> 51:10.440]  they shut down automatically shut down 48% of the tweets that use the hashtag
[51:10.440 --> 51:14.960]  DNC leak now this is in the last couple of weeks of the election and they shut
[51:14.960 --> 51:20.280]  down 25% of the tweets that used hashtag pedestrian emails this is what the
[51:20.280 --> 51:25.840]  Twitter general counsel Sean edget said in written testimony to the Senate
[51:25.840 --> 51:30.320]  Judiciary Committee on Tuesday so think about this this is something that is
[51:30.320 --> 51:37.760]  coming from 57,000 users posted 426,000 unique tweets containing hashtag
[51:37.760 --> 51:41.760]  pedestrian emails so it's very widespread this is not a few Russian
[51:41.760 --> 51:46.840]  troll farms that are buying ads with them this is the grassroots protests what
[51:46.840 --> 51:50.760]  people are really talking about on Twitter you got 57,000 users putting up
[51:50.760 --> 51:56.880]  427,000 tweets about pedestrian emails and they are algorithmically censoring
[51:56.880 --> 52:00.120]  this that's what he's talking about and then half of the tweets that are
[52:00.120 --> 52:04.080]  talking about the DNC leaks so this is a systemic censorship that is coming from
[52:04.080 --> 52:07.440]  these individuals I don't think people understand the seriousness of this
[52:07.440 --> 52:13.000]  David because not only are they censoring people's speech on these
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.840]  platforms this is a it's a really like a triple-edged sword if that's even a
[52:16.840 --> 52:22.120]  thing because a this is where everyone goes everyone's on Twitter and Facebook
[52:22.120 --> 52:25.920]  then they're there they did a factor monopoly exactly there's no competition
[52:25.920 --> 52:30.080]  because oh wait what happened when competition sprung sprung up in the name
[52:30.080 --> 52:36.200]  of gab they erased gab and they banned gab from all app stores so you can't get
[52:36.200 --> 52:40.480]  gab on your iPhone you can't get gab on your your Android so you're forced to get
[52:40.480 --> 52:45.600]  Twitter or Facebook where they admit they are censoring news politically based
[52:45.600 --> 52:50.040]  on what you're saying politically so there is about what's going on with the
[52:50.040 --> 52:55.400]  the Baker speech situation okay free speech or whether it is freedom of
[52:55.400 --> 53:00.880]  religion this is the Supreme Court case this is about the Baker who refused to
[53:00.880 --> 53:05.760]  bake a cake for a gay wedding and he said that's that violates my freedom of
[53:05.760 --> 53:11.240]  religion and this is reported by USA Today they said this is the most highly
[53:11.240 --> 53:15.480]  contested inflammatory case there's only been in the last several years there's
[53:15.480 --> 53:18.560]  only been three topics that even come close to this kind of controversy
[53:18.560 --> 53:24.120]  that's abortion affirmative action and Obamacare and they've had so many briefs
[53:24.120 --> 53:27.400]  on both sides of this just in the last two months they've had a hundred legal
[53:27.400 --> 53:33.440]  briefs about this because this is saying no you cannot refuse service to these
[53:33.440 --> 53:36.280]  people and of course he's saying well I'm not just baking them a cake I'm
[53:36.280 --> 53:40.160]  participating in their ceremony and that's the problem that I have with it
[53:40.160 --> 53:46.040]  but Twitter and Facebook and Google are just providing a service but they are
[53:46.040 --> 53:49.920]  interjecting themselves into the free speech issue even though they have a
[53:49.920 --> 53:55.680]  de facto monopoly that's the issue right there and if I just don't see how
[53:55.680 --> 53:59.800]  they're going to be able to continue to operate in a censorship way maybe with
[53:59.800 --> 54:02.920]  the Trump administration we'll see that shut down there's a regulated as a
[54:02.920 --> 54:06.160]  monopoly because it truly is but these bakeries are not monopolies they can go
[54:06.160 --> 54:10.360]  down the street to somebody else but they truly do have a monopoly but they
[54:10.360 --> 54:14.560]  it shows how they are have different standards just as you point about about
[54:14.560 --> 54:19.240]  gab they have different standards for different people if you are a friend of
[54:19.240 --> 54:23.440]  theirs if you're part of the insider establishment then you can do whatever you
[54:23.440 --> 54:26.760]  want there's no more rules that apply to them than there are rules that apply to
[54:26.760 --> 54:29.960]  Hillary Clinton or to Robert Mueller they can do whatever they want they can
[54:29.960 --> 54:35.440]  set up crooked deals with the Russian companies and then they can hide that they
[54:35.440 --> 54:38.920]  can obstruct justice they can put gag orders on people as Robert Mueller does
[54:38.920 --> 54:43.320]  and then he gets appointed as the investigator of Russian collusion I
[54:43.320 --> 54:47.280]  just probably using his office to destroy evidence it'll be interesting to see
[54:47.280 --> 54:51.320]  what may what what comes of that obviously this this the swamp rat looking
[54:51.320 --> 54:55.560]  for the swamp rat but here was a story that just came from CNBC today
[54:55.560 --> 55:00.320]  Department of Justice reportedly considers antitrust suit to block AT&T's
[55:00.320 --> 55:06.360]  $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner I'm wondering Trump just brought in that
[55:06.360 --> 55:12.920]  antitrust lawyer into his administration I'm just wondering if they really are
[55:12.920 --> 55:16.920]  looking at Facebook and Twitter and where their funds are going and how
[55:16.920 --> 55:21.160]  politically charged these individuals really are because that to me is the
[55:21.160 --> 55:25.440]  real antitrust you need to look at when you can't even bring anything into the
[55:25.440 --> 55:29.920]  market as this is a long-time tactic look when I was working with a libertarian
[55:29.920 --> 55:33.160]  party we would go through all these hurdles that the Democrats or Republicans
[55:33.160 --> 55:36.840]  never had to do to get on the ballot they're so great we're gonna be in the
[55:36.840 --> 55:41.040]  debates no the debates are being run by a private organization usually it was
[55:41.040 --> 55:44.880]  some kind of association of the press and they can include or exclude whoever
[55:44.880 --> 55:49.480]  they wish this is a very very old tactic of political control that the
[55:49.480 --> 55:53.040]  establishment has used for a long time they're taking that same principle and
[55:53.040 --> 55:56.760]  they're using it now with Google Facebook Twitter all these different
[55:56.760 --> 56:00.320]  platforms saying that well this is private so they can do whatever they
[56:00.320 --> 56:03.360]  want they can shut down your free speech and when you think about that we
[56:03.360 --> 56:07.360]  think about the fact that they would take this away from a debate platform
[56:07.360 --> 56:10.360]  that's being run by the government intentionally turn it over to a private
[56:10.360 --> 56:14.240]  organization so they could shut this down and you understand how involved they
[56:14.240 --> 56:19.800]  were not only shutting down get a gab but also in terms of creating these
[56:19.800 --> 56:23.600]  platforms you understand what their true purpose is well we had the project
[56:23.600 --> 56:27.520]  Veritas video release come out that had the guy from YouTube and Google
[56:27.520 --> 56:31.000]  admitting yeah we censor Alex Jones we don't want Alex Jones to show up we
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.000]  can't have people looking at that they hate us that much and they hate free
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.960]  speech that much and it's frustrating for me I keep getting sent honestly David
[56:37.960 --> 56:41.760]  I I don't have Facebook haven't had for years I don't want Facebook I don't
[56:41.760 --> 56:45.280]  need them I'm so sick of Twitter now because I can't even send out a tweet
[56:45.280 --> 56:50.240]  without it getting censored I had my impressions and I still had no response
[56:50.240 --> 56:52.840]  from Twitter on this I've noticed that other conservatives are now experiencing
[56:52.840 --> 56:58.360]  the same thing my Twitter impressions literally got cut in half oh yeah I don't
[56:58.360 --> 57:01.640]  know if you notice that too admitting it now because the DNC and because of
[57:01.640 --> 57:04.240]  Podesta emails they're admitting that they cut them in half our quarter
[57:04.240 --> 57:08.120]  depending on the topic they say well well we'll take half of those out or
[57:08.120 --> 57:11.400]  we'll take a quarter of those out you don't know you don't even know that
[57:11.400 --> 57:14.240]  you're being censored no no they just delete it it's just like it's gone and
[57:14.240 --> 57:19.240]  then yesterday guys pull this up on the war on the war room Twitter I tweet out

[1:00:08.960 --> 1:00:17.800]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:22.520]  good news is that the deep state shadow government corrupt establishment is so
[1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:26.560]  desperate right now that they're all showing their true colors and the
[1:00:26.560 --> 1:00:29.920]  middle-of-the-road Americans that aren't necessarily politically involved
[1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:33.600]  politically active watching the news paying attention to everything are
[1:00:33.600 --> 1:00:38.000]  seeing them now because they're showing their true colors as absolute anti-
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:42.800]  American hypocrites here's a video compilation of the political left
[1:00:42.800 --> 1:00:52.800]  showing its true colors as hypocrites
[1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:57.800]  Jim I mean this story started breaking at the end of my show yesterday we're not
[1:00:57.800 --> 1:01:02.560]  even really 24 hours barely 24 hours in and the president is already pushing
[1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:09.600]  Congress for several major changes right I think President Trump rook now has the
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:14.400]  world record for injecting politics into the aftermath of a terror attack that is
[1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:19.720]  exactly what has happened in the last 12 hours tweeting about this and then if
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:23.440]  you look at his comments that he made at the beginning of his cabinet meeting in
[1:01:23.440 --> 1:01:28.120]  addition to work regarding the US justice system as a joke and a laughing
[1:01:28.120 --> 1:01:32.920]  stock he also called about CNN is a call for a sweeping changes to the nation's
[1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:39.520]  immigration system I am bothered by an attempt by anyone to try to politicize
[1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:48.400]  this situation that plays right into the hands of the terrorist look the last
[1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:53.320]  thing the president or anyone else should do is politicize this tragedy we
[1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:56.920]  have to find out what happened here amazingly and tragically in the midst
[1:01:56.920 --> 1:02:02.520]  of what has just happened the United States Congress was about to entertain
[1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:05.960]  two pieces legislation that would have made a bad situation worse this is the
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:10.680]  quote-unquote share act which will allow people from other states to bring guns
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:18.280]  that are illegal in New York into New York and would make our city more
[1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:23.680]  vulnerable well mr. president there are precious few words for days like this
[1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:29.480]  last night everyone now knows at a concert in Las Vegas Nevada gunmen
[1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:36.960]  opened fire on a crowd of 22,000 killing at least 58 fending hundreds hundreds
[1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:44.960]  more to the hospital today were filled with shock and horror sadness and rage
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:51.080]  horrific massacre was perpetuated by an American on his fellow Americans and the
[1:02:51.080 --> 1:02:57.280]  visitors from every corner of the world were the very lifeblood of Las Vegas and
[1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:01.480]  were left with many questions whose answers will be seeking in the coming
[1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:07.720]  days and weeks out of this monster acquired the arsenal be used to rain
[1:03:07.720 --> 1:03:14.200]  down death on a crowd of innocence so there's a bunch of Democrats who don't
[1:03:14.200 --> 1:03:17.480]  want to politicize the truck attack because it was radical Islamic terror
[1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:20.440]  but immediately wanted to politicize the Vegas shooting because they could
[1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:26.600]  blame a gun David I'll be honest I've had to learn patience my whole life I've
[1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:33.000]  been dealing with lack of patience but I cannot stand CNN that is the scum of
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:37.880]  news and then I have to sit here and look at the scum of New York like Cuomo
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:42.440]  de Blasio and Schumer I mean I'm literally like it's like I want to pull
[1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:47.040]  my hair out just dealing with them well you know it was Jim Acosta who is
[1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:50.440]  saying the president has broken all records to inject politics of course
[1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:55.280]  that's not true but what he was focusing on was the person who committed this they
[1:03:55.280 --> 1:03:59.120]  always focus on the tools they talk about guns they talk about vehicles
[1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:03.200]  they talk about the internet because it was the internet that radicalized him
[1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:08.680]  not Islam video that caused Benghazi David that's right so they don't
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:11.760]  complain that Hillary lied to the Gold Star family about that though that's
[1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:14.400]  right we got to get rid of the internet we got to get rid of your ability to
[1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:18.280]  freely walk about in public places we got to get rid of the vehicle the gun
[1:04:18.280 --> 1:04:24.000]  but we cannot talk about the diversity lottery we have to pretend that
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:27.840]  diversity is more important than anything and guess what we had eight
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:31.800]  people sacrificed on the altar of political correctness that's really
[1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:34.880]  what this was about and five of them say that five of them were from Argentina
[1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:37.360]  where they had a vigil yesterday so you know I mean you want to talk about
[1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:40.320]  multiculturalism who's gonna want to come here when we're being attacked by
[1:04:40.320 --> 1:04:46.560]  terrorists please please New York I'm begging you please rid yourself of the
[1:04:46.560 --> 1:04:51.920]  swamp rats Cuomo de Blasio and Schumer those are the most disgusting human

[1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:33.120]  that info wars discovered a long time ago about the importance of telomeres
[1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:39.880]  and that's why we introduced DNA force but this new study says that prenatal
[1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:44.360]  environmental pollution exposure is linked to decreased telomere length
[1:08:44.360 --> 1:08:50.000]  measured in cord blood and placental cells the second trimester in
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:56.120]  particular was demonstrated to be a vulnerable time during gestation so
[1:08:56.120 --> 1:09:02.640]  now our environment has become so polluted that our telomeres are actually
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:10.320]  under attack before we're even born now this is a very important health notice

[1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:37.880]  double standard Paul thanks for joining us today good to be back going well Paul
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:42.920]  you unfortunately have to bring to light the truth about a lot of these terror
[1:10:42.920 --> 1:10:46.920]  attacks a lot of these events they happen in Europe they happened in America as
[1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:51.480]  well and you're really just trying to fight back against the mainstream
[1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:55.480]  television news that doesn't want to give the full story in the name of
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:11:00.840]  political correctness well exactly and I mean that's it sounds like just to
[1:11:00.840 --> 1:11:03.840]  cliche at this point oh all this terrorism is happening because of political
[1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:08.280]  correctness but we know specifically this is why this attack happened this guy
[1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:13.320]  came in on a diversity visa this bizarre program where people are just
[1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:17.080]  selected at random Trump's trying to end it Schumer supports it they're gonna
[1:11:17.080 --> 1:11:21.160]  fight him tooth and nail on that so we've got another specific example we've
[1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:26.240]  also got coming out today Owen headline New York attack suspects family was very
[1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:31.440]  mysterious neighbor says the neighbors said they knew he was planning something
[1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:34.680]  this is in the article they knew the immigrant was plotting an attack long
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:40.040]  before long before he allegedly plowed his rented truck in down a bicycle path
[1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:43.120]  killing eight people that's what the article says that's a report these
[1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:48.000]  neighbors knew he was planning something San Bernardino the neighbors knew they
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:51.040]  were getting strange deliveries they knew something was going on in that
[1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:54.560]  instance we reported they didn't tell the authorities or the police because
[1:11:54.560 --> 1:12:00.120]  they feared they'd be called racist or Islamophobic Owen so yet again we have
[1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:04.000]  another case not just with the visa but with the neighbors before and this is a
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:08.360]  closed community again one of these Muslim closed communities we saw it
[1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:13.360]  after the Paris attack the terrorists escaped back into Molymbique Brussels all
[1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:16.880]  the neighbors all their friends knew they were there they shielded them
[1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:21.840]  protected them for three months after they carried out this massacre so yet
[1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:26.440]  again we have the same telltale signs coming in after this attack Owen and
[1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:30.920]  then I don't know if you've covered this but I mean we can get onto it Jake
[1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:35.320]  Tapper you've played the clip or Alex has played the clip obviously of him
[1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:39.520]  saying that Alarak bar could be beautiful immediately after we're talking
[1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:43.640]  probably within an hour after the attack happened saying that Alarak bar could
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:48.800]  be beautiful he's now denying he ever said that and claiming that Fox News and
[1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:53.440]  Info Wars are lying about him but he never said it Owen when he's on tape
[1:12:53.440 --> 1:12:56.800]  saying it and I think we can go to that clip if we've got it yeah actually we've
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:04.200]  got that clip here's Jake Tapper loving loving Allah who Akbar police have now
[1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:08.720]  talked to their sense they're telling police that they heard this driver saying
[1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:15.200]  yelling Allah Akbar Allah Akbar during this incident to believe that this is
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:23.600]  as a result that this is now a terrible is taking over this case because it
[1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:29.080]  appears now that this is terrorism the Arabic Chanda God is great sometimes
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:32.920]  said under the most beautiful circumstances and too often we hear of
[1:13:32.920 --> 1:13:37.920]  it being being said of moments like this I'm sorry to laugh at Jake Tapper he's
[1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:42.960]  just such a joke actually Paul so not only did he never say Allah who Akbar is
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:45.800]  beautiful even though we just heard him say it I'm gonna take Jake Tapper's
[1:13:45.800 --> 1:13:50.400]  word I mean you know I should trust Jake Tapper fake Fopper so even though I just
[1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:54.680]  heard him say Allah who Akbar is beautiful he said he never said it so
[1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:57.240]  I'm not gonna believe that he that he said it because I trust Jake Tapper but
[1:13:57.240 --> 1:14:02.720]  did you also know that Jake Tapper basically did a whole segment breaking
[1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:07.960]  down renting trucks should we be able to rent trucks what type of truck I mean
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:13.000]  they did a segment breaking down the truck the truck we've got to combat that
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:18.640]  deadly ideology of trucks I mean I mean these trucks are out of control Paul but
[1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:22.920]  I mean with this Allah Akbar thing he's now claiming the moral high ground Fox
[1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:27.600]  News about a story called Jake Tapper says Allah Akbar is beautiful right after
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:33.360]  NYC terror attack that's what he said it's on video no he didn't know he didn't
[1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:37.080]  I just played the I just played the clip Paul even though he said it he never
[1:14:37.080 --> 1:14:42.080]  said it he said so and all these buddies at CNN are like this is disgraceful
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:45.960]  Fox News deleted one of their tweets you had one of the congressman shit
[1:14:45.960 --> 1:14:51.080]  Jason Jason Schaff it's what did what why did Schaff is causing yeah
[1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:56.600]  apologizing saying oh I'm sorry no Jake Tapper you said Allah Akbar could be
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:15:00.480]  beautiful literally within an hour after a terror attack where the frigging
[1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:04.280]  Islamic terrorists shouted it while people were laying face down on the
[1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:07.800]  floor bleeding to death I don't think they probably thought it was beautiful
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:12.280]  did they oh and when when I heard him say it no I know he never but see but
[1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:15.440]  that but you know what you see you just put it into perspective there Paul
[1:15:15.440 --> 1:15:20.360]  that's exactly it okay what do you think the victims were thinking after they
[1:15:20.360 --> 1:15:24.600]  heard oh Allah Akbar yeah I'm sure that's beautiful oh it was a truck all
[1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:31.000]  those nasty trucks they got us again those trucks no this is radical Islamic
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:39.200]  terror and this is a leftist policy the diversity visa program the we're

[1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:39.280]  terror attack. it was the truck it was the truck Paul what's interesting about
[1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:45.480]  this as you talked about in the last segment the story from the LA Times
[1:20:45.480 --> 1:20:51.320]  New York attack suspects family was very mysterious according to a neighbor
[1:20:51.320 --> 1:20:55.640]  they're saying that they had an idea that he was up to something this also
[1:20:55.640 --> 1:20:59.120]  wreaks like the sand Bernardino shooting where because of political
[1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:03.920]  correctness they didn't want to say anything even though this ended up
[1:21:03.920 --> 1:21:07.800]  killing eight people and driving a truck through pedestrians right after a
[1:21:07.800 --> 1:21:13.640]  school day but it's weird because people at the mosque are saying they
[1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:17.800]  understood his motive so it sounds like he was motivated to do this they're
[1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:22.000]  reporting he had the plans he was planning bigger attacks but his wife
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:29.040]  though Paul his wife is shocked oh his wife had no idea Paul what she can't
[1:21:29.040 --> 1:21:34.240]  even believe it he was he was just of your local friendly uber driver that
[1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:37.280]  remember that was the first quote that came out from one of his friends you
[1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:41.640]  hear that after every single attack oh we never knew he was so friendly he was
[1:21:41.640 --> 1:21:45.640]  so nice of course they knew often it turns out later on some of them are
[1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:49.400]  involved in the plot you mentioned the the guy at the mosque and by the way
[1:21:49.400 --> 1:21:54.360]  there are islamo files islamo fascist apologist all over twitter saying he was
[1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:58.760]  just radicalized on the internet there's no connection to Islam whatsoever he
[1:21:58.760 --> 1:22:04.760]  didn't even go to a mosque yes he did go to a mosque we know the name of it and
[1:22:04.760 --> 1:22:08.560]  then the guy who's in the newspaper article in the Daily Mail talking about
[1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:12.720]  how he went to the mosque as you mentioned said that he totally gets why
[1:22:12.720 --> 1:22:17.600]  he did what he did before ranting about George W. Bush's foreign policy in the
[1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:22.480]  Middle East so because of what George W. Bush did that means innocent young
[1:22:22.480 --> 1:22:27.200]  people and tourists on their bicycles in Manhattan yeah most of the Argentinian
[1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:31.880]  rush yeah yeah absolutely no connection whatsoever of course they always trot
[1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:36.000]  this out oh it's a reasonable response to u.s. foreign policy now the vast
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:40.800]  majority of terror victims are Muslims killed by other Muslims so no
[1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:45.600]  geopolitical foreign policy isn't the only element yes it is one part of it
[1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:50.800]  but it's not the only element the other thing going today is after Trump came
[1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:55.080]  out and said that this guy should get the death penalty a bunch of people and
[1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:59.120]  some of them like verified liberals prominent people on Twitter came out and
[1:22:59.120 --> 1:23:05.280]  said how dare Trump call for the death penalty that is lamaphobic why didn't he
[1:23:05.280 --> 1:23:10.240]  call for the death penalty for the Vegas shooter well maybe because we're
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:14.960]  sending him to Guantanamo yeah maybe because he was dead yeah maybe that's
[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:19.680]  why he didn't call for the death penalty I'll read a tweet this is from Elpham
[1:23:19.680 --> 1:23:23.480]  Katami this is verified liberal on Twitter send him to Gitmo Trump says
[1:23:23.480 --> 1:23:27.680]  referring to Saipoff he said no such thing about the Vegas shooter who killed
[1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:32.920]  58 people yeah he said no such thing because Stephen Paddock was dead he
[1:23:32.920 --> 1:23:37.120]  can't kill someone twice you've got other people saying quote I don't see real
[1:23:37.120 --> 1:23:40.080]  Donald Trump calling for the death penalty for the Las Vegas terrorist
[1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:46.560]  shooting rampage blatant Islamophobia this is the level of sheer lack of
[1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:51.760]  intellectual debt that we're dealing with I honestly the way go ahead well I
[1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:59.080]  honestly I can't even we're literally dealing with mentally retarded people I
[1:23:59.080 --> 1:24:04.480]  mean there's no other way to describe this I mean I and I'm including Jake
[1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:09.520]  Tapper and Don Lemon in that group as well blocked me on Twitter now Don
[1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:14.920]  Lemon Jake Tapper has blocked me on Twitter you must be you must be heart
[1:24:14.920 --> 1:24:21.400]  broken absolutely crushed I was actually attacking you on Twitter he was
[1:24:21.400 --> 1:24:26.600]  quoting he was teaming up with his buddy Oliver Darcy who won't respond to me on
[1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:30.600]  the DMs well I was talking to him before he won't respond now unless they're on
[1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:35.520]  the high horse thing look Fox News got this disinformation from info wars look
[1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:40.760]  at this sewer pipe he never said alirak bar is beautiful are you deaf the hell
[1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:45.680]  is wrong with you it would be like after Charlottesville of course we've
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:49.400]  disavowed the alt-right completely the left never does that with Antifa but it
[1:24:49.400 --> 1:24:53.440]  will be like after Charlottesville if I came out got on YouTube or got on this
[1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:58.440]  radio show and said oh but the Confederate flag can be beautiful if
[1:24:58.440 --> 1:25:03.440]  that's the first thing I said 30 minutes after that girl was killed in Charlottesville
[1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:08.200]  do you think the media would have been jumping down my throat or if Alex had
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:11.520]  said it would have been jumping down his throat they would have been all over
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:15.680]  him Jake Tapper can say this and now he's just claiming he never even said it
[1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:21.080]  this is completely Orwellian saying Fox News is bad I'm bad and info wars is bad
[1:25:21.080 --> 1:25:25.760]  but playing a tape of him saying it what is wrong with these people Paul
[1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:33.200]  honestly I don't even know it's like beyond Tokyo rose like Tokyo rose telling
[1:25:33.200 --> 1:25:36.880]  people in Japan we're winning we're winning there's obviously an element of
[1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:39.920]  that going on people trying to trick the American public into thinking that
[1:25:39.920 --> 1:25:42.600]  Trump's losing the Trump movement is winning even though it's just having
[1:25:42.600 --> 1:25:46.080]  devastating victory after devastating victory the Trump movement is kicking
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:49.600]  ass it's nowhere near stopping it's gaining momentum in fact so you got all
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:53.440]  these Tokyo roses out there in the media that are trying to spin it but but again
[1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:58.000]  like you're talking about this is this is beyond Orwellian this is literally you
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:02.840]  have to ask yourself are these people on air literally that mentally deranged are
[1:26:02.840 --> 1:26:08.200]  they I mean you know is it that bad do we have such a mental health crisis in
[1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:11.720]  this country that literally we're putting people on air that are are
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:15.480]  seriously mentally ill or are they that corrupt Paul I don't know if you saw the
[1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:20.520]  story but and I believe it was NBC News the crew is looking for the story saying
[1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:26.120]  that they admitted the New York Police Department actually investigated the
[1:26:26.120 --> 1:26:31.080]  killer's mosque before there it is listen listen to this headline listen to
[1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:37.080]  this Paul mosque where New York City terror suspect worshiped was target of
[1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:42.040]  controversial New York Police Department surveillance effort so it's still
[1:26:42.040 --> 1:26:47.560]  controversial even though the NYPD had the right mosque they investigated the
[1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:51.520]  mosque where this terrorist worshiped they had their finger on the pulse they
[1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:54.480]  should have pulled the trigger on the guy and maybe they could have saved lives
[1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:58.960]  and what does the mainstream news say it was controversial so it's not
[1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:03.760]  controversial to mow down people in a truck it's controversial to investigate
[1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:09.760]  those people now no exactly I mean I said it in the video from what I saw on
[1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:13.960]  Twitter in the media aftermath of that attack obviously all the Islamophobic
[1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:19.440]  crap oh but what about the Islamophobic backlash there's never any Islamophobic
[1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:23.880]  backlash you had things after 9-11 where some Sikh people got attacked because
[1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:27.680]  people at dormant they think Sikh people are Muslims some shops got bricked
[1:27:27.680 --> 1:27:34.000]  after 9-11 that after that there's been no substantial Islamophobic backlash
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:38.280]  after any of these terror attacks throughout Europe or America but that's
[1:27:38.280 --> 1:27:43.320]  the first thing they go to to shut down debate and discussion of Islam I mean
[1:27:43.320 --> 1:27:48.840]  now you've even got a Forbes writer being more offended over the fact that the
[1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:53.280]  EPA chief is reading passages out of the Bible she said the fact that he was
[1:27:53.280 --> 1:27:58.920]  doing that is quote scarier than Allah Akbar she said that the same day of the
[1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:04.680]  terrorist attacks well yeah I mean I could pull up a wait zero stories of
[1:28:04.680 --> 1:28:08.520]  someone saying Jesus is is Lord and then running people over there's no stories
[1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:13.120]  of someone holding the Bible in the air and then murdering a bunch of people in
[1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:17.080]  the name of Jesus Allah Akbar Allah Akbar then you're you know you could
[1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:22.320]  have at least eight to do you know 500 people dead but you know it's almost
[1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:26.800]  like 9-11 never happened to these people Paul you know I mean again we
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:29.640]  don't need to get into what actually happened on 9-11 but the official story
[1:28:29.640 --> 1:28:34.080]  is radical Islamic terrorists hate our country hate our way of life want us all
[1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:38.160]  to die want to stop the Western influence on the world but then they just
[1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:42.160]  kind of sweep that under the rug as if that never happened and now it's Islam
[1:28:42.160 --> 1:28:47.560]  is good they don't hate us don't be Islamophobic don't be racist be a good
[1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:52.840]  liberal bend over and be raped by us and die that's what they want they want us
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:29:00.440]  all to die so to being in control of your own health care is freedom from

[1:33:04.640 --> 1:33:34.120]  it's honestly it's honestly hard to talk about this stuff on a day-to-day basis
[1:33:34.120 --> 1:33:41.160]  and to cover it on a day-to-day basis and the madness the insanity will will
[1:33:41.160 --> 1:33:47.560]  drive you insane because you've got people that are consciously trying to
[1:33:47.560 --> 1:33:53.720]  destroy humanity destroy this country lie to you brainwash you and then you
[1:33:53.720 --> 1:34:00.120]  have their minions that have the same characteristics of hate and victimhood
[1:34:00.120 --> 1:34:10.120]  but they're just brainwashed minions now it can all be kind of summed up with
[1:34:10.120 --> 1:34:18.240]  Snoop Dogg putting out a new album cover that says make America Crip again and
[1:34:18.240 --> 1:34:25.240]  then has Donald Trump's dead body as he is standing over it with a drink in his
[1:34:25.240 --> 1:34:39.640]  hand so a imagine if a country artist did this with Obama's dead body okay you
[1:34:39.640 --> 1:34:46.360]  would have such outrage that you couldn't even CNN and MSNBC wouldn't
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:51.840]  even stop covering it for a month but this is the truth about it Paul this is
[1:34:51.840 --> 1:34:55.560]  what I think the American people can see from this and again it's so frustrating
[1:34:55.560 --> 1:34:58.800]  because I know they're losing I know that this is the Tokyo Rose I know that
[1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:02.680]  this is their desperate last stand but it's just it just hurts me that people
[1:35:02.680 --> 1:35:07.480]  are so hateful and so ignorant it honestly hurts me but when we say that
[1:35:07.480 --> 1:35:11.920]  they want you to die when we say they want to turn America into a third world
[1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:19.040]  gangland it can all be summed up in this one album cover make America Crip again
[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:26.320]  what is Crip the Crip is a drug-dealing gang of thugs what is a dead body doing
[1:35:26.320 --> 1:35:31.360]  on the cover with Trump as the dead body they want Trump dead so they want to
[1:35:31.360 --> 1:35:38.760]  kill you and they want to make America a gangland again Paul how am I supposed
[1:35:38.760 --> 1:35:44.640]  to how am I supposed to respond to this but where the hateful ones I mean where
[1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:48.320]  where the vindictive at spiteful bigots that really want to go out and
[1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:51.440]  yeah we're the ones that oh no no Paul actually Paul just hit it on the head
[1:35:51.440 --> 1:35:54.720]  you right Paul we're the ones that won't accept the results of the election
[1:35:54.720 --> 1:36:00.240]  that's us and when they go low we go high oh wait no that's them too isn't it
[1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:03.720]  oh wait no they're the ones that keep going lower and lower and lower and
[1:36:03.720 --> 1:36:07.520]  lower and lower and lower and lower these people literally will go so low
[1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:12.360]  until they reside in hell yeah every time they come out with the same line
[1:36:12.360 --> 1:36:17.720]  which is oh Trump's being so divisive Trump supporters are so divisive no
[1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:22.080]  that you can stretch it back right to what Neil after a year before the
[1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:26.120]  election they were sending in people to beat up Trump supporters at his own
[1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:32.000]  events we've seen this assassination fetish dominate cultural institutions have
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:36.400]  put this out you had Buzzfeed we got the internal chat logs of Buzzfeed writers
[1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:41.120]  joking about Trump being assassinated though a major journalist like
[1:36:41.120 --> 1:36:46.040]  Indian Eye of the London Times Monisha Rajesh of the Guardian you even had a
[1:36:46.040 --> 1:36:51.240]  so-called conservative Ross a doubt hat of the New York Times all making jokes
[1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:56.520]  or in some cases directly calling for somebody to assassinate Donald Trump but
[1:36:56.520 --> 1:37:01.080]  where the divisive ones where the hateful ones Cathy Griffin can hold up his
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:05.360]  decapitated head but where bad where bigoted where hateful and then you've
[1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:09.920]  got Snoop Dogg here's a guy whose career had completely fallen on its on its
[1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:14.120]  backside as of about 10 years ago he's gone through all these ridiculous
[1:37:14.120 --> 1:37:18.880]  reinventions of his image to try and grasp back some kind of relevance
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:23.840]  failed his last album didn't even get into the top ten supposedly one of the
[1:37:23.840 --> 1:37:27.920]  biggest hip-hop rap stars of all time can't even break the top ten with an
[1:37:27.920 --> 1:37:31.760]  album anymore and basically anyone can do that who's anyone right now so his
[1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:35.800]  career is failing so he's desperately trying to claim back some relevance and
[1:37:35.800 --> 1:37:40.560]  we're helping him to some extent that's the irony by and broiling himself in this
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:46.440]  Trump assassination fetish for the second time Owen in six months he put out a
[1:37:46.440 --> 1:37:51.080]  video back in March where he shot a mock Trump dressed as a clown it looked
[1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:56.120]  exactly like Trump in the head so it looks like get some new ideas already is
[1:37:56.120 --> 1:37:59.880]  this literally all you've got you want to kill Donald Trump yeah we get it we
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:04.200]  get it's new now do you have any actual talent left to reach out to people where
[1:38:04.200 --> 1:38:07.800]  people are gonna buy your record because it's a good record or are you gonna
[1:38:07.800 --> 1:38:12.920]  resort to this assassination fetish creating more division more hate in
[1:38:12.920 --> 1:38:16.800]  America he's gonna go back to that every time because he's got no talent anymore
[1:38:16.800 --> 1:38:21.440]  nobody cares about his music anymore this is the only way he can get in the
[1:38:21.440 --> 1:38:26.600]  news well and I'm beginning to wonder if Snoop Dogg wasn't just a controlled
[1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:31.760]  asset from the very beginning when he was introduced into the hip-hop market
[1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:36.800]  because he's never I mean Snoop Dogg has never really been a guy to get
[1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:41.000]  political he's usually a guy that just you know smokes weed and wants to chill
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:44.560]  now the sudden he's political all the sudden along with you know everyone else
[1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:49.280]  in the establishment music industry so my question is I'm wondering if these
[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:54.200]  aren't just controlled assets whether it be the CIA or what have you that are
[1:38:54.200 --> 1:38:59.360]  basically being told hey you want to sell another album you want to continue
[1:38:59.360 --> 1:39:03.200]  to get record deals you better do something anti-trump you better do it
[1:39:03.200 --> 1:39:07.080]  immediately otherwise you get nothing well I mean that's we've seen that
[1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:10.320]  before people get dropped from record labels for expressing any kind of
[1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:15.560]  opinion that goes against the grain I highlighted in my video about Eminem when
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:19.360]  he came out a few weeks ago another ailing 40-something rapper whose
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:25.200]  career is basically over at this point attacking Trump Trump as of five ten
[1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:30.540]  years ago all these rappers gave him shout-outs positive shout-outs in their
[1:39:30.540 --> 1:39:34.480]  songs and in fact I put a medley together in that Eminem video where it's
[1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:37.920]  all Trump this Trump that he's done so well he's so great he's got so much
[1:39:37.920 --> 1:39:42.720]  money you know rich like Trump yeah you only got to like a quarter of them you
[1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:48.440]  didn't even play all they all loved Trump until he ran as a Republican and
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:52.880]  until he defeated Hillary Clinton they used to hang out with Trump Snoop Dogg
[1:39:52.880 --> 1:39:57.360]  was at the roast you know those big roast they used to do those TV roast he was
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:01.440]  one of the main people hanging out with Trump they all love Trump Trump used to
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:04.640]  hang out with all these black community leaders raise money for them oh but
[1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:08.640]  suddenly he runs as a Republican defeats Hillary he's a racist and they're all
[1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:13.320]  attacking him it's so frigging transparent and now he's back again the
[1:40:13.320 --> 1:40:17.560]  problem is some people might act on this because you go on Twitter every day
[1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:21.400]  oh when someone gonna kill Trump I'm gonna pop Trump you had Mike Cernovich
[1:40:21.400 --> 1:40:25.880]  somebody lobbed a death threat at him the other night you had Michael Sanford
[1:40:25.880 --> 1:40:29.840]  tried to assassinate Donald Trump before the election this was a British
[1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:33.600]  social justice warrior who was radicalized by all this mainstream
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:37.760]  media rhetoric about Trump's and bigoted racist literally tried to grab a cops gun
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:41.800]  at a vent and shoot Trump in the head the media buried it and said oh he was
[1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:46.040]  just a misunderstood kid so people have acted out on this they are gonna act out
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:49.720]  on it in future that's why it's dangerous and they're causing the hate
[1:40:49.720 --> 1:40:53.600]  they're causing the division while we get blamed for it yeah and real quick
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:57.040]  yeah real quick I'm just gonna put a conspiracy theory out there I'm gonna
[1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:01.760]  say that the New York terrorists who drove the truck into the crowd of people
[1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:06.520]  was motivated by the Democrat ad that showed the guy with the truck with the
[1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:10.360]  Confederate flag running down kids I'm gonna say that he saw that ad and that
[1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:13.040]  motivated him to run people down the streets because I don't want to be
[1:41:13.040 --> 1:41:16.760]  anti-Islam and Islamophobic so I'm gonna say was that ad that motivated him
[1:41:16.760 --> 1:41:21.980]  but I'm just curious Paul again is Snoop joking like does he really hate
[1:41:21.980 --> 1:41:25.640]  Trump does he really care about Trump is he even friends with Trump and behind
[1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:28.640]  the scenes saying look Donald I'm sorry I have to do this for my career you know
[1:41:28.640 --> 1:41:32.240]  I got a family I got these bills like I just I'm sorry Donald I just have to do
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:36.200]  this or because I don't there's no reason for these people to hate Trump
[1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:40.400]  there's no reason he's done nothing he's literally done nothing to these people
[1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:45.600]  he was never in politics all he's done is created businesses created jobs created
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:49.880]  markets created skyscrapers there's no reason they all love Donald Trump oh but
[1:41:49.880 --> 1:41:55.280]  now all of a sudden they hate him it's just like I mean should I stop being so
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:58.440]  upset about this should I just laugh this off should I go hang out with Snoop
[1:41:58.440 --> 1:42:01.360]  dog and do all the drugs because everything's just a joke to Snoop dog
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:04.640]  I mean I just I mean they're just gaslighting me and it works I guess I
[1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:08.240]  think you have to remember that he's catering all the people who tell him
[1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:11.120]  what to do which is probably what it is at this point he's catering to an
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:14.880]  audience which is not the brightest let's just put it that way and you can see
[1:42:14.880 --> 1:42:18.360]  that from the comments when I made a video about Snoop dog being an idiot
[1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:22.360]  back in March when he did the first stun so they're catering to very stupid
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:27.000]  people he's been a political tool for several years come on diesel why you

[1:47:28.840 --> 1:47:34.680]  talking about make america kripigan isle because we want to make america a
[1:47:34.680 --> 1:47:42.880]  gangland busy what's up dizzle so i was just informed isle that the make
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:47.000]  america kripigan with snoop dog looking over trumps dead body has now been
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:54.640]  removed from instagram because of the backlash it's so funny these these
[1:47:54.640 --> 1:48:02.120]  i don't even know what to call these people mental defective we need to come
[1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:04.960]  up with like a new word for them honestly paul i don't know what we can
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:10.320]  we'll figure it out eventually but they keep having to remove this stuff from
[1:48:10.320 --> 1:48:15.760]  their social media because of the backlash coming from the people that they
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:21.560]  actually want to buy their albums or buy their products do you think they'll
[1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:26.120]  ever learn that they're in the minority as far as their trump hatred is
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:30.680]  concerned isle well i think if you look at hollywood they're starting to learn
[1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:34.640]  that already from the fact that all their films are complete flops you have
[1:48:34.640 --> 1:48:39.760]  the matt daemon george clueless daemon say it right it's matt daemon matt daemon
[1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:48.720]  suburbicon no matt daemon matt daemon there you go isle isle shizzle but
[1:48:48.720 --> 1:48:52.720]  matt daemon was behind suburbicon with george clueless which again portrayed
[1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:57.320]  you know middle america flyover country trump supporters being all racist blah
[1:48:57.320 --> 1:49:01.520]  blah blah get any frigging narrative and it completely failed all these
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:05.800]  virtue signaling hollywood films are failing the ones that have a kind of
[1:49:05.800 --> 1:49:10.440]  throwback more libertarian feel are really doing well in hollywood the more
[1:49:10.440 --> 1:49:14.000]  independent ones that we've seen recently so they're starting to lose the
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:18.120]  culture war that's gonna be magnified by all this hollywood wine steam fallout
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:22.000]  and yeah but you're talking about it being banned on instagram i don't want
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:27.120]  it to be banned i want people to see how stupid well they did and hate it wasn't
[1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:32.360]  banned they took it down yeah of course it's a whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa they
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:37.200]  were calling for trumps death you don't ban that calm down but again they're
[1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:41.360]  doing it to create the outrage to then make themselves look like the victim they
[1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:45.640]  always do that they'll probably cite threats made against snoop dog now
[1:49:45.640 --> 1:49:49.120]  without mentioning the deluge major made against trump on a daily basis they
[1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:52.320]  want to create the outrage i just want to hold it up and say look this is
[1:49:52.320 --> 1:49:56.840]  absolutely stupid and ridiculous and like kathy griffin they always come back
[1:49:56.840 --> 1:50:01.120]  and try and play the victim after there's a backlash remember her crying
[1:50:01.120 --> 1:50:05.080]  press conference so don't give them that victory just laugh at them yeah that's
[1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:08.640]  the key to all this just continue to laugh at them no i think you're right and
[1:50:08.640 --> 1:50:13.320]  i get so upset over this stuff because i know what it's doing to our country and
[1:50:13.320 --> 1:50:19.320]  it's it's honestly just an attack on innocence and people that have no idea
[1:50:19.320 --> 1:50:24.320]  what's going on but you're actually right because this is only hurting them more
[1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:30.640]  people that see this the more people are going to come to trump side and i just
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:33.640]  don't think they're ever going to learn paul i really don't think they really
[1:50:33.640 --> 1:50:39.000]  assume that everybody goes and takes a steaming pile of you know what and then
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:42.600]  sniffs it just like they do they get high off their own you know what and they
[1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:45.720]  assume that everyone else in america is just like that but i think they're
[1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:49.840]  quickly learning that actually people in america are not like that and they
[1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:54.080]  don't like your constant hatred of trump and the more they put that out there the
[1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:59.400]  more people i think will end up on trump side well exactly they're ridiculing
[1:50:59.400 --> 1:51:03.160]  their own audience i mean and it hasn't worked it didn't work before the election
[1:51:03.160 --> 1:51:07.560]  they create this wave of antagonism with this nearing metropolitan liberal
[1:51:07.560 --> 1:51:12.280]  elitist attitude added to you know huffington post new york times hillary
[1:51:12.280 --> 1:51:18.400]  has a 98 chance of winning sheer overconfidence sheer naivety combined
[1:51:18.400 --> 1:51:23.000]  with this unbridled arrogance and hatred of ordinary people which you see
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:26.760]  across the board by the way you see in in my own country the united kingdom the
[1:51:26.760 --> 1:51:31.760]  sheer hatred the sheer snobbery directed against white working class people and
[1:51:31.760 --> 1:51:35.480]  that's what you've got with the backlash with trump so if that's not all they've
[1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:40.840]  got is oh let's kill trump isn't it funny haha then they still don't have an
[1:51:40.840 --> 1:51:44.680]  actual argument or any policies that are going to resonate with the american
[1:51:44.680 --> 1:51:48.680]  people you've had top democratic operatives who worked for bill clinton not
[1:51:48.680 --> 1:51:53.200]  trump supporters come out recently and say he's a shoe in for 2020 because the
[1:51:53.200 --> 1:51:57.280]  democrats have still got no policies and they still think that just smearing
[1:51:57.280 --> 1:52:03.400]  everyone as racist is a winning election strategy newsflash 2016 happened it
[1:52:03.400 --> 1:52:08.680]  isn't so carry on carry on portraying donald trump is dead it's not working for
[1:52:08.680 --> 1:52:13.280]  you it's just making see people see how ridiculous desperate and stupid you are
[1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:18.080]  that you have to cater to this vile tone in modern-day politics while they of
[1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:23.080]  course accuse us of having a vile divisive tone it's not working didn't
[1:52:23.080 --> 1:52:27.480]  work won't work again carry on that they'd make it's like don't interrupt
[1:52:27.480 --> 1:52:32.600]  somebody who's who's scoring an own goal right just let them carry on we
[1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:37.000]  should be celebrating this yeah yeah just let them score in their own basket
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:41.800]  essentially all day long but the crazy thing I don't know about it in in
[1:52:41.800 --> 1:52:44.800]  Europe Paul I would imagine it's the same thing but here in America the
[1:52:44.800 --> 1:52:51.680]  anti-weight the anti-white hatred this hatred against white people is from 95
[1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:55.360]  percent white people when I go out on the streets and I have a bunch of people
[1:52:55.360 --> 1:52:59.400]  telling me I'm an f-ing white male or white male privileges the biggest
[1:52:59.400 --> 1:53:03.400]  problem white men are the terrorists white men is the face of evil it's
[1:53:03.400 --> 1:53:08.720]  always coming from white people what in that I mean what so what do you do with
[1:53:08.720 --> 1:53:15.120]  that well to boil it down even further it's coming from actual privileged
[1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:20.200]  people like I've hung like my parent my dad got up at 6 a.m. for 30 years and
[1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:24.080]  went and worked in a factory okay they didn't have any privilege all right I
[1:53:24.080 --> 1:53:29.200]  worked my way up I had to work hard I get people who I'd socially fraternize
[1:53:29.200 --> 1:53:32.480]  with occasionally and they're constantly lecturing me about my
[1:53:32.480 --> 1:53:36.440]  privilege and how colonialism is evil and how I'm to blame for it when that
[1:53:36.440 --> 1:53:41.320]  they were literally in the best schools okay they had to work for nothing they
[1:53:41.320 --> 1:53:45.120]  got everything handed to them that the most privileged people you can imagine
[1:53:45.120 --> 1:53:48.640]  across the board white black whatever doesn't even matter and yet they'll
[1:53:48.640 --> 1:53:52.520]  lecture me about my privilege when I didn't even have any and that's the
[1:53:52.520 --> 1:53:57.560]  snobbery I was talking about before which is even more noticeable in the UK
[1:53:57.560 --> 1:54:02.120]  where they will just treat working-class white people like absolute crap and there
[1:54:02.120 --> 1:54:06.960]  was a case on Twitter where this woman tweeted out a picture of some builders
[1:54:06.960 --> 1:54:11.200]  in like construction gear just going into a cafe and getting their lunch or
[1:54:11.200 --> 1:54:16.200]  whatever and she was like oh there are only two GCSEs between these guys GCSEs
[1:54:16.200 --> 1:54:20.480]  being a high school qualification and it's just that level of snobbery we see
[1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:23.880]  it all the time talking about white people I win we've got this four chance
[1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:28.040]  done I don't know if you've seen it where they launch oh yeah okay to be white
[1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:32.720]  where they just printed out the words it's okay to be white plastered them up
[1:54:32.720 --> 1:54:38.360]  in public places totally legally and it caused absolute outrage from people who
[1:54:38.360 --> 1:54:43.200]  are now all over Twitter saying oh no it isn't okay to be white exemplifying
[1:54:43.200 --> 1:54:48.640]  proving their point that there is this virulent form of anti-white racism that's
[1:54:48.640 --> 1:54:53.160]  now dominating the far left the regressive left and they're only proving
[1:54:53.160 --> 1:54:56.800]  their point by the fact they got so outraged over this and they think it's
[1:54:56.800 --> 1:55:00.920]  it's part of this white supremacist takeover it's only played into their
[1:55:00.920 --> 1:55:04.600]  hysteria even more so here's what needs to happen because I'm sure a bunch of
[1:55:04.600 --> 1:55:07.360]  those people on 4chan listen to this show now now here's your follow-up
[1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:12.440]  experiment it's okay to be black put that in public places see what happens
[1:55:12.440 --> 1:55:16.800]  it's okay to be Muslim put that in public places see what happens there's
[1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:21.520]  your social experiment you will find out that it's only okay to be white is
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:25.680]  receiving backlash being torn down people shooting videos people getting
[1:55:25.680 --> 1:55:28.760]  offended and it's all because you're white and Paul you know that's the other
[1:55:28.760 --> 1:55:32.640]  thing that really bothers me too and I'm not I'm not gonna sit here and talk
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:36.360]  about myself it's just when all these people say oh white privilege oh you're
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:40.080]  a white male you've never had to deal with any hardship never like you don't
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:44.960]  even know me you don't know about my history you don't know about my family
[1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:49.800]  you don't know anything about me and yet you're sitting here making all these
[1:55:49.800 --> 1:55:53.000]  assumptions about me because I'm white it's like if you actually sat down how
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:55.960]  I have a conversation with me you might find out that whatever you're assuming
[1:55:55.960 --> 1:56:01.160]  about me is completely wrong but there it is that's their inherent racism that's
[1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:08.160]  what they don't see they are truly racist people in fact here I mean again but
[1:56:08.160 --> 1:56:15.160]  they're all white they're white well the fact is I'm there self-loathing people
[1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:19.440]  we saw a same the similar thing with the whole male feminist thing I've been
[1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:24.440]  called a misogynist a woman hater a sexist for years but criticizing third
[1:56:24.440 --> 1:56:28.320]  way feminism which by the way the vast majority of American women don't agree
[1:56:28.320 --> 1:56:33.600]  with anyway so it's not criticizing women it's criticizing an ideology just
[1:56:33.600 --> 1:56:37.920]  like criticism criticizing Islam is criticizing an ideology but you'll
[1:56:37.920 --> 1:56:42.680]  notice a lot of these sexual abusers that have been exposed in the media
[1:56:42.680 --> 1:56:48.720]  especially over the past three weeks were all prominent male feminists they
[1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:52.960]  were the people who were lecturing me and Alex Jones for years saying we hate
[1:56:52.960 --> 1:56:57.920]  women and we're spewing hatred towards women by criticizing an ideology while
[1:56:57.920 --> 1:57:03.240]  they're literally physically assaulting sexually abusing women while
[1:57:03.240 --> 1:57:06.840]  proclaiming themselves to be big male feminists so it's the same thing any
[1:57:06.840 --> 1:57:12.600]  every time they're transposing their inherent guilt and self-loathing on to
[1:57:12.600 --> 1:57:16.840]  you because they're fundamentally unhappy people we've seen that over and over
[1:57:16.840 --> 1:57:20.400]  again by the way they're all manic depressives a lot of these big leftists so
[1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:23.920]  again it's taking that self-loathing that's the only way they can get rid of
[1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:28.640]  it is to transpose it all on to us the evil right-wingers when where the most
[1:57:28.640 --> 1:57:32.280]  friendly approachable will talk to anyone as he said you'll go up to anyone
[1:57:32.280 --> 1:57:36.320]  during the process you'll talk to them where the most open tolerant people yet
[1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:40.080]  they have to transpose that evil on to us because they're fundamentally self-loathing
[1:57:40.080 --> 1:57:43.200]  people that's Paul Joseph Watson more of the Alex Jones show on the other side

[1:59:48.640 --> 2:00:06.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:06.240 --> 2:00:19.400]  raging war on corruption it's alex folks sometimes you can encapsulate
[2:00:19.400 --> 2:00:24.440]  everything you're trying to say in someone's response on Twitter and so
[2:00:24.440 --> 2:00:28.800]  that's what we're gonna do now I put out a poll from the war room show which
[2:00:28.800 --> 2:00:34.040]  follows the alex jones show every day and the question was are you willing to
[2:00:34.040 --> 2:00:40.240]  compromise freedom and safety for multiculturalism and diversity this was
[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:44.320]  retreated by alex jones it's got over 4,000 votes it'll be up for a couple days
[2:00:44.320 --> 2:00:50.760]  yet so again the poll is are you willing to compromise freedom and safety for
[2:00:50.760 --> 2:00:55.720]  multiculturalism and diversity it's pretty straightforward doesn't make any
[2:00:55.720 --> 2:01:01.680]  assumptions it just lays it out on the table and it's a fair conversation and
[2:01:01.680 --> 2:01:09.520]  political debate to have of course but this is how you see the mindset of a
[2:01:09.520 --> 2:01:18.240]  liberal this boils it all down for you folks this response right here so some
[2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:24.880]  someone on Twitter says response to this poll saying does this mean banning white
[2:01:24.880 --> 2:01:34.840]  dudes with guns to okay do you understand what's going on here folks again the
[2:01:34.840 --> 2:01:42.160]  poll is are you willing to compromise freedom and safety for multiculturalism
[2:01:42.160 --> 2:01:49.000]  and diversity the average liberal response is does this mean banning white
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:56.520]  dudes with guns to so what am I saying here folks it doesn't matter what you
[2:01:56.520 --> 2:02:04.920]  say it doesn't matter literally doesn't matter the white liberal immediately
[2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:09.640]  goes to racism immediately goes to diversity immediately goes to guns
[2:02:09.640 --> 2:02:16.520]  nowhere in the poll do you find any mention of race at all nowhere in the
[2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:22.800]  poll do you see anything to do with guns nowhere in the poll do you see the word
[2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:29.840]  ban or any sort of phrase that would suggest a ban but that's the liberal
[2:02:29.840 --> 2:02:38.040]  mindset this is the brainwashing this is literally I cannot cut this any drier
[2:02:38.040 --> 2:02:43.920]  than this are you willing to compromise freedom and safety for
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:49.720]  multiculturalism and diversity are you gonna ban white dudes with guns to excuse
[2:02:49.720 --> 2:02:54.000]  me I did I say anything about race did I say anything about guns did I say
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  anything about any bands no that's their obsession that is their religion folks
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:08.200]  these are the brainwashed people we're dealing with they cannot live in
[2:03:08.200 --> 2:03:15.040]  reality they cannot even see things for what they are they are so brainwashed by
[2:03:15.040 --> 2:03:22.520]  liberal politics that they inject them into everything it doesn't matter what
[2:03:22.520 --> 2:03:30.040]  you say it doesn't matter who you are they have their agenda and that is to
[2:03:30.040 --> 2:03:36.360]  attack white men to attack guns and to attack anything that they view as
[2:03:36.360 --> 2:03:43.320]  intolerant like a ban so even though there is no mention of guns no mention of
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:50.600]  race no mention of bands in the poll that's where the liberal mind goes do
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:57.040]  you see the brainwashing now do you see the mental retardation of these people
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:03.480]  now because of the media it all can be summarized right here with this one
[2:04:03.480 --> 2:04:11.040]  response from this one liberal again I this this is this is it this is all you
[2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:18.920]  need to see this is the epitome of liberal brainwashing where you put out a
[2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:25.040]  milk toast poll a very relevant topic after a tear attack where the terrorist
[2:04:25.040 --> 2:04:29.760]  was brought in because of a diversity bill and you say are you willing to
[2:04:29.760 --> 2:04:34.200]  sacrifice freedom and safety for multiculturalism and diversity which is
[2:04:34.200 --> 2:04:37.440]  what you'd have to do that's what Chuck Schumer said we need more money for
[2:04:37.440 --> 2:04:41.880]  anti-terrorism forces so okay so now you're compromising freedom and safety
[2:04:41.880 --> 2:04:46.280]  for multiculturalism and diversity what does the good liberal say are you gonna
[2:04:46.280 --> 2:04:51.000]  ban the whites with guns are you gonna ban white men with guns injecting their
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:57.040]  identity politics where it never existed now ladies and gentlemen we're running

[2:05:56.960 --> 2:06:04.240]  I really just want everybody to take a deep breath and relax and just you know
[2:06:04.240 --> 2:06:16.240]  sit back because here they come again
[2:06:16.240 --> 2:06:26.240]  live from the infowars.com studios it's Alex Junkies
[2:06:26.240 --> 2:06:30.920]  I'm running for president every day Americans need a champion and I want to be that
[2:06:30.920 --> 2:06:40.920]  champion. I don't feel no ways tired. I come too far. I ain't no ways tired.
[2:06:40.920 --> 2:06:48.920]  Is that a dog?
[2:06:48.920 --> 2:06:53.080]  It has been reported you've made five million making speeches the president
[2:06:53.080 --> 2:06:57.960]  made more than a hundred million dollars. What's difference at this point does it
[2:06:57.960 --> 2:07:01.400]  make? What does that make Hillary Clinton to the British family?
[2:07:01.400 --> 2:07:04.680]  My sister-in-law.
[2:07:04.680 --> 2:07:09.480]  I don't know why that's funny.
[2:07:09.480 --> 2:07:14.040]  You are a liar. Another conspiracy theory.
[2:07:14.040 --> 2:07:18.600]  Have you always told the truth? I've always tried to. Always. Always.
[2:07:18.600 --> 2:07:21.880]  I will fight to reign in Wall Street and you know what?
[2:07:21.880 --> 2:07:26.120]  I know how to do it. We came out of the White House
[2:07:26.120 --> 2:07:30.520]  not only dead broke but in debt. I remember landing under sniper fire
[2:07:30.520 --> 2:07:34.120]  it was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport but
[2:07:34.120 --> 2:07:38.120]  instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles.
[2:07:38.120 --> 2:07:58.120]  A little sip. Open up. Come on. Take it. Take it.
[2:07:58.120 --> 2:08:08.520]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones who claims
[2:08:08.520 --> 2:08:14.040]  that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs. He even said the
[2:08:14.040 --> 2:08:21.240]  victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors.
[2:08:21.240 --> 2:08:32.840]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones.
[2:08:32.840 --> 2:08:39.720]  Aren't you glad that that demon feces that demon dropping Hillary Clinton
[2:08:39.720 --> 2:08:43.560]  is not the president of the United States? Wow just honestly just thank God
[2:08:43.560 --> 2:08:46.360]  we're not dealing with that absolute witch. I'm being polite.
[2:08:46.360 --> 2:08:49.640]  Hey folks do you know how to support us at infowarstore.com yet?
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:53.320]  Yes that's right. That's how you support us. You want to thumb your nose at Hillary
[2:08:53.320 --> 2:08:55.880]  Clinton? You want to stick your finger right in

[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:03.000]  support us. Nothing aggravates Hillary Clinton
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:06.280]  more. Nothing aggravates Jake Tapper more.
[2:09:06.280 --> 2:09:11.160]  Nothing aggravates George Soros more than you going to infowarstore.com
[2:09:11.160 --> 2:09:15.240]  and supporting us by buying our products folks. Trust me this
[2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:19.960]  is how you fight back against their propaganda. This is how you fight
[2:09:19.960 --> 2:09:22.520]  back against their lies. This is how you fight back
[2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:27.320]  against them trying to destroy our country and destroy our way of life
[2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:30.040]  infowarstore.com. Now we're running some great
[2:09:30.040 --> 2:09:33.640]  specials but I really want to highlight the DNA Force special right now.
[2:09:33.640 --> 2:09:38.600]  It's 25% off. Now we know that the environment is toxic
[2:09:38.600 --> 2:09:43.560]  and so we provide supplements to fight back against our toxic environment. DNA
[2:09:43.560 --> 2:09:47.640]  Force is one of the most important. New study comes out.
[2:09:47.640 --> 2:09:52.200]  Prenatal pollution exposure linked to decreased telomere length.
[2:09:52.200 --> 2:09:56.120]  This new study found that prenatal environmental pollution exposure
[2:09:56.120 --> 2:10:00.360]  was linked to decreased telomere length measured in cord blood and placental
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:02.920]  cells. The second trimester in particular
[2:10:02.920 --> 2:10:06.760]  was demonstrated to be a vulnerable time during gestation. So folks
[2:10:06.760 --> 2:10:10.360]  the environment is now so toxic that even
[2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:14.760]  before you're born you're getting hit with this and your telomeres are very
[2:10:14.760 --> 2:10:19.000]  important to your DNA, very important to your health, your life.
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:24.600]  So we knew that the telomeres were essentially deteriorating quicker than
[2:10:24.600 --> 2:10:28.200]  normal so we introduced DNA Force. Now we find out that they're actually
[2:10:28.200 --> 2:10:34.520]  deteriorating before you're born. So we know the environment is toxic.
[2:10:34.520 --> 2:10:38.440]  We know that these chemicals are destroying
[2:10:38.440 --> 2:10:43.160]  our biology. So we bring products to infowarstore.com
[2:10:43.160 --> 2:10:46.760]  that fight back against the polluted environment.
[2:10:46.760 --> 2:10:51.160]  So when you hear about telomeres, when you hear about telomere length
[2:10:51.160 --> 2:10:55.240]  decreasing, just know that infowarstore.com has your back
[2:10:55.240 --> 2:10:59.560]  and we've got DNA Force back in stock 25% off. So
[2:10:59.560 --> 2:11:03.160]  we don't raise the price when the new study comes out
[2:11:03.160 --> 2:11:06.520]  saying that our telomeres are being deteriorated before we're born.
[2:11:06.520 --> 2:11:13.960]  We cut it 25%. So take advantage of DNA Force 25% off while in stock. This is a
[2:11:13.960 --> 2:11:19.320]  very important product to protect your telomeres.
[2:11:19.320 --> 2:11:23.240]  I'm now joined in the studio by Leanne McAdoo
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:27.560]  and as usual Leanne you've got Democrats trying to
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:31.720]  rig debates, rig elections, blaming the right for everything
[2:11:31.720 --> 2:11:35.640]  as usual but it's breaking and more is coming to light
[2:11:35.640 --> 2:11:39.800]  how Donna Brazil and Hillary Clinton, but I mean mainly Hillary Clinton basically
[2:11:39.800 --> 2:11:43.640]  had the DNC by the political balls if you will,
[2:11:43.640 --> 2:11:47.080]  and Donna Brazil was right along for the ride. Right, well apparently the DNC was
[2:11:47.080 --> 2:11:50.840]  totally broke and Hillary Clinton's campaign used that to their advantage to
[2:11:50.840 --> 2:11:54.920]  say look, deal with us and we'll keep you afloat. We'll keep the
[2:11:54.920 --> 2:11:57.640]  party afloat. Politico actually called it back when
[2:11:57.640 --> 2:12:01.160]  this was first revealed. Essentially money laundering.
[2:12:01.160 --> 2:12:04.120]  Yeah, it's basically money laundering. The same stuff that David
[2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:08.200]  Brock's packs do. But this is a huge breaking story and the
[2:12:08.200 --> 2:12:11.880]  fact that Donna Brazil has been given this opportunity to tell her side of
[2:12:11.880 --> 2:12:15.560]  the story. She's total, I mean the birds are chirping
[2:12:15.560 --> 2:12:18.840]  right now. She's throwing Hillary Clinton under the bus, her campaign, she's
[2:12:18.840 --> 2:12:21.560]  talking about Robbie Moog, she's talking about Debbie
[2:12:21.560 --> 2:12:25.000]  Wasserman Schultz and how incompetent she was and corrupt.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:28.520]  Beyond that, yeah. Right, I mean this is really big time right now that we're
[2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:31.240]  seeing Donna Brazil. I mean I'm curious though why is she
[2:12:31.240 --> 2:12:34.920]  being given this opportunity to give her testimony?
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:39.320]  You know, is Mueller looking in to what happened at the DNC? Because as we know
[2:12:39.320 --> 2:12:42.840]  they still, I mean at least as far as we know, they still have not
[2:12:42.840 --> 2:12:46.840]  actually inspected these DNC servers. Well they won't let them. That started the
[2:12:46.840 --> 2:12:51.000]  entire Russia hacking hoopla. But then they don't
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:54.760]  even get to get to the source of that main complaint, that main
[2:12:54.760 --> 2:13:01.560]  charge. So this Donna Brazil
[2:13:01.560 --> 2:13:07.480]  expose, she's wrote it for Politico, inside Hillary Clinton's secret takeover
[2:13:07.480 --> 2:13:12.360]  of the DNC and she admits that she stumbled onto a shocking truth about
[2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:15.160]  the Clinton campaign. She found the documents
[2:13:15.160 --> 2:13:18.840]  that proved that the DNC had- Even though we already had it in the WikiLeaks,
[2:13:18.840 --> 2:13:22.840]  Donna Brazil is breaking it now. Right, and she said you know she wanted to,
[2:13:22.840 --> 2:13:27.240]  she wanted to see that maybe some of these documents may have been forged
[2:13:27.240 --> 2:13:30.760]  because that, remember that was the story when WikiLeaks first broke.
[2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:33.640]  The DNC, they were saying- They can't deny that now. They were like oh these emails were
[2:13:33.640 --> 2:13:36.840]  forged and then of course you have your tech people come along and say no I'm
[2:13:36.840 --> 2:13:40.040]  sorry we can look at the metadata and see that these were actual real emails.
[2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:43.400]  Let's see but again though this is why it's so frustrating.
[2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:48.120]  Infowars.com had this story over a year ago. We were already reporting.
[2:13:48.120 --> 2:13:51.720]  We knew Hillary Clinton took over the DNC. We knew they rigged the election
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:55.400]  against Bernie Sanders. I guess this is now news because it's Donna
[2:13:55.400 --> 2:13:57.400]  Brazil basically you know the left selling out themselves.
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:00.120]  She's finally singing and she's singing like a bird
[2:14:00.120 --> 2:14:04.040]  and she's throwing all these- Kid Daniels had this story last week about how
[2:14:04.040 --> 2:14:07.880]  they're definitely going to take out Hillary Clinton. They don't-
[2:14:07.880 --> 2:14:11.800]  She's going to be the sacrificial land. They don't need her anymore. They don't-
[2:14:11.800 --> 2:14:15.880]  No one's paying $500,000 to her husband for his speeches.
[2:14:15.880 --> 2:14:20.200]  And nobody wants that corpse to speak at their campus or anywhere. That's a walking corpse.
[2:14:20.200 --> 2:14:23.560]  They have no power anymore so now we're starting to see with this
[2:14:23.560 --> 2:14:27.320]  investigation. James Comey was fired. He is no longer
[2:14:27.320 --> 2:14:29.560]  there to protect the Clintons and all of their
[2:14:29.560 --> 2:14:33.560]  Obama administration cronies who have now we're starting to see they've been up
[2:14:33.560 --> 2:14:36.840]  to absolutely no good for the last eight years. And they were all sort of
[2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:40.760]  protecting each other but Comey's out. He's not there. We're going to see
[2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:45.160]  some actions taken against Loretta Lynch. And so Donna Brazil is like look
[2:14:45.160 --> 2:14:48.520]  here it is. I'll tell you everything you want to hear. We'll get to more of this
[2:14:48.520 --> 2:14:53.320]  story just to- I'll tell you the specific documents that she found and how she just-
[2:14:53.320 --> 2:14:57.000]  She was so upset that she had to make that call to Bernie Sanders.
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:01.320]  So then all of his supporters need to know that Bernie Sanders absolutely knew
[2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:04.520]  about this collusion and what was going on but he didn't stick up
[2:15:04.520 --> 2:15:08.680]  for the many many millions of people that were supporting him in his campaign.
[2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:13.080]  And donated money too. He immediately told them to just go support Hillary Clinton.
[2:15:13.080 --> 2:15:17.000]  And then they sued and then they dropped that lawsuit even though it was perfectly
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:20.840]  legitimate. And again just to be clear here basically what is happening
[2:15:20.840 --> 2:15:25.400]  is because you have these campaign donation limits and because the Democrat
[2:15:25.400 --> 2:15:30.280]  Party was in debt, Hillary Clinton was able to use
[2:15:30.280 --> 2:15:36.760]  basically loopholes or work-around techniques to take extracurricular
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:39.080]  donations into- Fundraising agreements.
[2:15:39.080 --> 2:15:43.880]  Into different fundraising techniques and then funnel that money back to the DNC
[2:15:43.880 --> 2:15:48.520]  which it would have been illegal had it come from the original contributor to begin with.
[2:15:48.520 --> 2:16:14.520]  So this is just how the Democrats break the law and Hillary Clinton gets away with it.
[2:16:18.680 --> 2:16:27.320]  This is Dan Pillon. Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[2:16:27.320 --> 2:16:31.800]  Are tax debts crippling you? I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.

[2:17:56.040 --> 2:18:01.720]  America is an information-based civil war. That's why now more than ever we've got to hit the streets
[2:18:01.720 --> 2:18:06.680]  of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[2:18:06.680 --> 2:18:12.360]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[2:18:12.360 --> 2:18:18.280]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate
[2:18:18.280 --> 2:18:24.920]  is truly the counterculture. The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America,
[2:18:24.920 --> 2:18:31.720]  pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom who at the same time is tolerant. Modern liberalism is a counterfeit
[2:18:31.720 --> 2:18:38.040]  of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism. They are the anti-liberals. To defend free speech,
[2:18:38.040 --> 2:18:43.480]  meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide. We've got more than 60 original designs

[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:29.960]  Ah, Smiley David Brock. He's a smiley little David Brock. I think David Brock is upset that
[2:20:29.960 --> 2:20:35.640]  Infowars is willing to cover his super PACs, funneling money back and forth, taking a 10%
[2:20:35.640 --> 2:20:40.200]  hit off of it every time. Is that money laundering? I don't know. Hopefully Jeff Sessions will
[2:20:40.200 --> 2:20:48.760]  investigate that. But media matters, folks. Pull up the tweet. So media matters tweets out.
[2:20:49.320 --> 2:20:55.880]  Reporter for Alex Jones Infowars says Hitler is alive and the U.S. government is covering it up.
[2:20:55.880 --> 2:21:04.200]  Now, that's not what I said. I said that the JFK files released revealed that Hitler escaped
[2:21:04.200 --> 2:21:10.600]  from Germany and remained alive in South America. But then there was a response from some other
[2:21:10.600 --> 2:21:14.600]  certified leftist on Twitter, if you guys can find that one as well. Actually, I think I still
[2:21:14.600 --> 2:21:20.600]  have it on my phone if you can't pull it up. Lachlan Marquet. Yeah, nobody's heard of him.
[2:21:20.600 --> 2:21:28.920]  I would like to know how a meth-addled gas attack victim has lived to 128.
[2:21:29.480 --> 2:21:36.760]  First of all, what in the hell is he talking about? Okay? But this is why it's so funny to me.
[2:21:37.800 --> 2:21:44.680]  I see you don't even realize it. I always make a false assumption about these liberals that
[2:21:44.680 --> 2:21:49.640]  they actually have common sense and they actually have the ability to think critically
[2:21:49.640 --> 2:21:56.200]  and to think past level one. They don't. They literally have no comprehensive ability to think
[2:21:56.200 --> 2:22:01.800]  past level one. This is a liberal mind. Okay, so media matters put out a tweet
[2:22:02.680 --> 2:22:08.360]  mischaracterizing what I said about Hitler. They chopped the clip. Doesn't even show the
[2:22:08.360 --> 2:22:13.480]  JFK files that show that Hitler was still alive and the U.S. government noted. The CIA's own
[2:22:13.480 --> 2:22:20.360]  documents. Then this one level one can't get past level one. These people are literally stuck on
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:25.560]  level one. If life was a video game, they can't even beat level one says, I'd like to know how
[2:22:25.560 --> 2:22:33.480]  a meth-addled gas victim lived to 128. Doesn't even research it. Doesn't even listen to the clip.
[2:22:33.480 --> 2:22:37.800]  Just immediately assumes things and this is why they can't get past level one, Leigh Ann.
[2:22:37.800 --> 2:22:43.800]  Well, when Roger Stone comes in the studio, I would like you to ask him about is it was Hitler,
[2:22:43.800 --> 2:22:48.520]  was Hitler a meth-addled? Is that who he's talking about? Look, who is he talking about?
[2:22:49.560 --> 2:22:53.080]  What is he talking about? Was that Hitler? Did I didn't know that that was a...
[2:22:53.080 --> 2:22:55.080]  I didn't know Hitler was a meth-head gas attack victim.
[2:22:55.080 --> 2:22:56.200]  I didn't know that.
[2:22:56.200 --> 2:23:00.680]  I really didn't. I did read the declassified government documents that said he escaped to
[2:23:00.680 --> 2:23:09.400]  South America, though. I did read that. Funny how that works. Funny how that... Look, folks,
[2:23:09.400 --> 2:23:15.160]  we're just trying... I'm just trying to break down the liberal mindset and how they literally
[2:23:15.160 --> 2:23:22.680]  are in arrested development and mentally retarded because we're fighting for the people in America
[2:23:22.680 --> 2:23:27.320]  that still aren't politically active, still don't really care about politics, and eventually because
[2:23:27.320 --> 2:23:33.080]  everything is so politicized now, because the force is so strong, they're going to have to
[2:23:33.080 --> 2:23:38.120]  choose a side eventually. And so I just want them to see the side of the left or the liberals,
[2:23:38.120 --> 2:23:44.440]  whatever you want to call them. I want them to see the truth about how weak-minded they are,
[2:23:44.440 --> 2:23:47.640]  how they can't think critically, and how they literally don't even have a foundation for their
[2:23:47.640 --> 2:23:54.360]  beliefs. It's just regurgitate, remake up talking points, and pair it whatever you hear from media
[2:23:54.360 --> 2:24:00.520]  managers. Right, and of course the whole JFK situation was the initial red pill for so many
[2:24:00.520 --> 2:24:04.040]  people in this country. That was the one thing that just drove the wedge where they're like,
[2:24:04.040 --> 2:24:07.880]  I don't believe anything that I'm being told by the government because they're lying about this,
[2:24:07.880 --> 2:24:11.240]  and now we finally have these documents coming out. You know what? I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[2:24:12.600 --> 2:24:17.960]  Reach out to Mark Shan, whatever his name is. Reach out to him. He wants to know. He says it.
[2:24:17.960 --> 2:24:23.800]  Lachlan Marquet, nobody's heard of him, says he would like to know how a meth-addled gas attack
[2:24:23.800 --> 2:24:28.840]  victim has lived to 128. So let's get him on the show. I'll explain it to him then. I'll explain
[2:24:28.840 --> 2:24:35.480]  it all to him how this goes on, and I'll actually show him the documents. So maybe then he can get
[2:24:35.480 --> 2:24:39.800]  past level one, but I doubt it. I doubt it. All right, let's get back into-
[2:24:39.800 --> 2:24:41.960]  Just promise you'll call him Lachlan when he comes on.
[2:24:41.960 --> 2:24:43.960]  Lachlan. Lachlan Markey.
[2:24:43.960 --> 2:24:51.000]  Lachlan. Okay, all right, but let's- on a serious note. So we've got Donna Brazil. She
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:56.120]  publishes this story basically outing the Clintons, outing the DNC, outing Debbie
[2:24:56.120 --> 2:25:03.640]  Wasserman Schultz, and the question is why is Donna Brazil doing this? But give us the nuts
[2:25:03.640 --> 2:25:07.800]  and bolts of exactly what was revealed in this article, Leanne.
[2:25:08.360 --> 2:25:13.720]  Right. So she was sent in kind of to take over the DNC to chair it after Wasserman Schultz had
[2:25:13.720 --> 2:25:18.280]  to step down and immediately went to Hillary Clinton's campaign because it showed that she
[2:25:18.280 --> 2:25:23.880]  was corrupt and colluding with their campaign. But Donna Brazil, so she went in to see,
[2:25:23.880 --> 2:25:28.520]  was it really true? Did Hillary Clinton's team rig the election, the nomination process?
[2:25:28.520 --> 2:25:35.000]  Well, what she found, she followed the money, and what she found was an agreement that was signed
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:41.880]  way back in 2015. It's the joint fundraising agreement between the DNC, the Hillary Victory
[2:25:41.880 --> 2:25:48.840]  Fund, and Hillary for America. And this specified that in exchange for raising money and investing
[2:25:48.840 --> 2:25:54.040]  in the DNC, Hillary would control the party's finances, strategy, and all the money that was
[2:25:54.040 --> 2:26:00.920]  raised. So this agreement was signed four months after Hillary Clinton announced that she was
[2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:08.760]  going to run for president. And an entire year before the DNC actually named the nominee.
[2:26:08.760 --> 2:26:14.760]  So she's controlling the money. Now, if you have an incumbent president like President Obama,
[2:26:14.760 --> 2:26:18.840]  where you know that there's no one that's going to try to run against him, this makes it seamless
[2:26:18.840 --> 2:26:22.680]  where the party that's actually nominated will just take over the funds, it makes it easy,
[2:26:22.680 --> 2:26:27.080]  they don't have to go through all the DNC chair to ask about for money and whatever.
[2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:30.840]  But when you have someone like Hillary Clinton and going against Bernie Sanders,
[2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:36.040]  where they're actually supposed to be competing for the nomination, the parties don't get to
[2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:41.240]  control the money, right? Or the campaigns don't get to control the DNC's money. So basically,
[2:26:42.680 --> 2:26:47.080]  individuals who would max out their contribution limit to the campaign could then go write an
[2:26:47.080 --> 2:26:52.760]  additional check to the Hillary Victory Fund. And the states were only receiving like less than
[2:26:52.760 --> 2:26:57.160]  1% of the money that the states were collecting. It was all being funneled back into Hillary
[2:26:57.160 --> 2:27:02.120]  Clinton's campaign. And this is exactly like you said at the same time Bernie Sanders is
[2:27:02.120 --> 2:27:07.000]  campaigning as well, but he didn't know or really care too much about the DNC's money
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:11.880]  because he was able to raise so much money through those small contributions. And this is why this
[2:27:11.880 --> 2:27:17.720]  is upsetting because we did have a lot of the Bernie Sanders supporters trying to sue the DNC
[2:27:17.720 --> 2:27:22.520]  in a civil lawsuit. But a Florida judge, hello, I'm sure he's Debbie Wasserman Schultz's buddy,
[2:27:23.320 --> 2:27:27.160]  dismissed this case saying that they hadn't presented any real case that there was any
[2:27:27.160 --> 2:27:31.320]  wrongdoing. And let's keep in mind though, this was after Seth Rich died, Sean Lucas died,
[2:27:31.320 --> 2:27:36.120]  and Barrington Wisnant died. Right. And so they dismissed this case. Dissaccoincidence,
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:39.400]  I'm sure that they did. Oh yeah, totally. Even though they were involved with this case and the
[2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:43.080]  Clintons don't have a body count behind them. Right. And because again, Donna Brazil does point
[2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:48.760]  out that the email stolen by Russian hackers and then posted online, she continues to just
[2:27:48.760 --> 2:27:53.320]  underscore that that's the reality of it. But again, this is probably all coming out of Mueller's
[2:27:53.320 --> 2:27:57.880]  investigation, which they still haven't to our knowledge investigated. Those DNC computers.
[2:27:57.880 --> 2:28:01.320]  I think that, well, they won't release that conveniently, even though the Russian thing
[2:28:01.320 --> 2:28:07.000]  is such a big deal to them, they won't release their own documents to show how the Russians
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:11.720]  allegedly hacked their servers because it's a lie. But actually, I think that you may have just kind
[2:28:11.720 --> 2:28:19.000]  of painted a clear picture for me with that. Maybe this really is the sacrificial period
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:25.160]  of Hillary Clinton. Maybe they really are throwing Hillary to the wolves now. And they say, okay,
[2:28:25.160 --> 2:28:30.280]  Donna Brazil, go ahead and out the Clintons, but keep the Russian narrative going. Exactly.
[2:28:30.280 --> 2:28:32.840]  Make sure you put that Russian narrative in there. Leigh Ann, I'll ask you this. And we got
[2:28:32.840 --> 2:28:36.600]  Wasserman Schultz as well is going to go down as well with this whole Imran I one thing.
[2:28:36.600 --> 2:28:39.160]  Well, she's freaking out. Yeah. I mean,
[2:28:39.160 --> 2:28:41.560]  Wasserman Schultz has literally freaked out. But final question, Leigh Ann,
[2:28:41.560 --> 2:28:46.360]  if nobody from the DNC or Hillary Clinton's campaign or the Clinton Foundation that broke
[2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:51.720]  the law, none of them go to jail, is justice dead? Yes, absolutely. The scales have been tipped.
[2:28:51.720 --> 2:28:57.080]  I agree. Time for justice, folks. You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat,
[2:28:57.080 --> 2:29:01.640]  not true. Actually, you are what you can absorb. So if the vitamins and supplements you now take

[2:32:00.680 --> 2:32:06.200]  actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean I try to make sure
[2:32:06.200 --> 2:32:11.880]  that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but right now we're dealing
[2:32:11.880 --> 2:32:17.240]  with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off
[2:32:17.240 --> 2:32:23.080]  a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological
[2:32:23.080 --> 2:32:26.920]  warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that
[2:32:26.920 --> 2:32:30.600]  says there's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there, you have the organic
[2:32:30.600 --> 2:32:36.120]  clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[2:32:36.120 --> 2:32:39.560]  All right well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came
[2:32:39.560 --> 2:32:44.120]  back in yesterday. Living Defense, InfowarsLife.com and folks you can't lose it's full of stuff that's

[2:32:50.040 --> 2:32:53.480]  from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product.
[2:32:53.480 --> 2:33:12.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:24.120 --> 2:33:46.840]  The perfect time to be joined by Roger Stone here in studio. You know I was I was kind of
[2:33:46.840 --> 2:33:52.120]  relenting from David Brock and Media Matter saying that I said Hitler was still alive.
[2:33:52.120 --> 2:33:55.720]  Something I never said but then actually it was brought to my attention. Roger I didn't even know
[2:33:55.720 --> 2:34:01.320]  you and Hitler had lunch last week. Only weeks ago. So yeah so it's confirmed now. I mean I didn't
[2:34:01.320 --> 2:34:05.240]  know that you guys were having dinner. Stand by you're about to get the Media Matters tweet.
[2:34:05.240 --> 2:34:12.680]  Roger Stone seen dining with Adolf Hitler. Look I was there. What he said was the recently
[2:34:12.680 --> 2:34:19.480]  declassified documents pertaining to the JFK assassination showed some traffic
[2:34:19.480 --> 2:34:24.440]  among the government communicators that would indicate that they believe that he may have
[2:34:24.440 --> 2:34:31.240]  escaped to South America and died later. So to be absolutely clear Owen Scheuer never said
[2:34:31.240 --> 2:34:38.120]  Hitler was still alive. The question is is David Brock still alive. Hasn't been seen since his
[2:34:39.080 --> 2:34:46.840]  heart attack. But we had Andrew Kerr from Citizens Autodon a couple weeks ago. Clearly Media Matters
[2:34:46.840 --> 2:34:53.560]  for America still engaged in tax evasion and other violations of the federal election law.
[2:34:53.560 --> 2:34:59.160]  Potential money laundering but extremely profitable for Mr. Brock. Extremely profitable.
[2:34:59.160 --> 2:35:06.280]  Well I wonder why he's having a heart attack. Perhaps maybe like Donna Brazil he's seeing the
[2:35:06.280 --> 2:35:13.480]  change of tides and wants to try to save his own skin and maybe try to pull out from everything
[2:35:13.480 --> 2:35:18.280]  that he's been doing with the Hillary Clinton campaign and funneling that money back and
[2:35:18.280 --> 2:35:25.480]  forth between his super PACs. And other non-profits I see that Donna Brazil has a new book coming
[2:35:25.480 --> 2:35:31.320]  out entitled Hacks. I assume it's a profile on her various friends in the Democratic Party.
[2:35:31.320 --> 2:35:36.520]  Oh I thought it was an autobiography. It's not clear but I will I am going to buy a copy however.
[2:35:36.520 --> 2:35:43.960]  Okay so you'll give us the lowdown on that. Roger you know there's all kinds of news right now. I'm
[2:35:43.960 --> 2:35:50.280]  not sure where you want to start. I think that it's incredible though how everybody's trying to
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:56.520]  manipulate everything Trump says. Meanwhile they're completely ignoring the bombshells that are coming
[2:35:56.520 --> 2:36:00.920]  out of what Hillary Clinton and her campaign was actually doing the entire election.
[2:36:00.920 --> 2:36:07.320]  Yeah it's pretty extraordinary. Terrific story on Info Wars today by Dr. Jerry Corsi
[2:36:07.880 --> 2:36:16.680]  about Twitter essentially censoring and weeding out anti-Hillary tweets. That's right. Further
[2:36:16.680 --> 2:36:21.480]  grist for the anti-Pedesta as well. You know further grist for the extraordinary lawsuit
[2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:30.440]  that we have coming shortly against Twitter for censorship, antitrust and various other issues.
[2:36:30.440 --> 2:36:37.000]  I've been very heartened Owen by the large number of multinational corporations, big names who've
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  come forward willing to underwrite my lawsuit. So it's not just you know it's not Roger Stone alone
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:49.400]  but it will be you know we will have plenty of financing to bring these culprits to justice.
[2:36:49.400 --> 2:36:52.440]  Is that kind of spurring you along right now the support that you're getting?
[2:36:52.440 --> 2:36:58.840]  Well the kind of first amendment or telecommunications lawyers that it takes for this kind of case are
[2:36:58.840 --> 2:37:04.520]  exceedingly expensive in all honesty pretty much beyond my personal financial capability.
[2:37:05.160 --> 2:37:12.760]  But with the assistance of some major corporations who are interested in fighting censorship I think
[2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:21.560]  we'll be able to put up a formidable battle and I've been looking at the home of the CEO of Twitter
[2:37:21.560 --> 2:37:26.280]  and I'll be ready to move in when I own the company. Are you ready to move in? You're ready
[2:37:26.280 --> 2:37:32.760]  to own Twitter? I definitely am and of course I wouldn't censor anybody. I would let the craziest
[2:37:32.760 --> 2:37:38.200]  left-wing whack job in the world have their Twitter feed. Well they already do. Oh yeah I forgot.
[2:37:38.200 --> 2:37:42.360]  So you wouldn't have to change that. You would just have to let you know conservatives have
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:48.040]  free speech on Twitter that would be the big difference. But they censored you on Twitter
[2:37:48.040 --> 2:37:53.560]  and I'm curious though is this the kind of thing that could go beyond Twitter because
[2:37:53.560 --> 2:38:01.400]  we know that the main competitor of Twitter is Gab and Apple Store and the Android App Store
[2:38:01.400 --> 2:38:06.360]  neither one of them will even put Gab on their platform anymore. So they've completely erased
[2:38:06.360 --> 2:38:11.880]  Gab from the competition. Yeah I mean look there's a terrific piece that I have up at Info Wars
[2:38:11.880 --> 2:38:17.080]  right now. It talks about how Twitter erases you as a human being which is what they seek to do.
[2:38:17.080 --> 2:38:22.920]  My wife returned from abroad last night only to find out that her Twitter feed has been suspended.
[2:38:23.640 --> 2:38:27.800]  Curious in view of the fact that she hasn't tweeted in six months and has never tweeted
[2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:32.360]  anything other than perhaps pictures of our grandchildren and other you know personal
[2:38:32.360 --> 2:38:39.400]  things to her friends but never anything political. So I guess this is preemptive censorship. Yeah
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:44.840]  we're we're we're censoring her because of something she might say in the future. Twitter
[2:38:44.840 --> 2:38:51.000]  I'm going to enjoy owning you. I really am. I'm going to enjoy this as well. I'm hoping that
[2:38:52.040 --> 2:38:56.440]  you know what it would be great and I'm sure this won't happen but it would be great if Twitter
[2:38:56.440 --> 2:39:01.320]  just came out and admitted what they were doing, admitted their political bias, admitted how they're
[2:39:01.320 --> 2:39:04.920]  trying to censor people that have different political views. Now obviously we know they
[2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:09.480]  won't do that so they're going to give you the opportunity to go ahead and just own Twitter
[2:39:09.480 --> 2:39:14.360]  with this lawsuit aren't they? Well and I think as you correctly point out the folks at Google
[2:39:14.360 --> 2:39:19.160]  are paying close attention. The people at YouTube are paying close attention because they're guilty
[2:39:19.160 --> 2:39:25.320]  of the exact same thing. So I do think the fight will be broad and at the end of the day Google
[2:39:25.320 --> 2:39:32.600]  is the big enchilada. They're the ones who I think have the most to lose but their reprehensible
[2:39:32.600 --> 2:39:38.200]  behavior is brought this kind of legal action and I frankly I think the Trump Justice Department
[2:39:38.200 --> 2:39:45.080]  was already looking at antitrust enforcement against them. This is only going to hasten this.
[2:39:45.080 --> 2:39:51.960]  The president's new appointee to the FTC, very good man, man who clearly understands these
[2:39:51.960 --> 2:39:59.320]  issues extensively. Now on that same page there is a story right now talking about the DOJ potentially
[2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:07.160]  thwarting the buyout of Time Warner by AT&T. Honestly this is something that I don't necessarily
[2:40:07.160 --> 2:40:13.080]  disagree with. I never felt that but you have a different angle as to why that this merger would
[2:40:13.080 --> 2:40:21.080]  actually be good. Well look I think AT&T is far more responsible if AT&T owned Time Warner and
[2:40:21.080 --> 2:40:27.720]  Time Warner owned CNN. I think you get a house cleaning. I've predicted that here on InfoWars.
[2:40:28.760 --> 2:40:36.840]  I predicted it on my Twitter feed before it was unceremoniously suspended. You know Don Lemon,
[2:40:36.840 --> 2:40:42.040]  Jake Tapper, Inna Navarro, bye bye. So wait you're telling me you don't think you don't think
[2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:48.120]  fake Fopper, I mean Jake Sucker, I'm sorry Jake Tapper, you don't think that he would have his
[2:40:48.120 --> 2:40:52.760]  platform to say Allah Huwakbar anymore? No I think fake Tapper would have a hard time to say that
[2:40:53.320 --> 2:41:01.800]  you know the people who bombed in Times Square you know they're merely misunderstood, strange,
[2:41:01.800 --> 2:41:07.960]  very strange. It is very strange the comments that come out of CNN. So does that mean are you
[2:41:07.960 --> 2:41:13.320]  saying that Zucker would be out and it would be a clearinghouse from the top down? That's what I
[2:41:13.320 --> 2:41:19.640]  believe. I think new management would clean house and maybe CNN would go back to being a news
[2:41:19.640 --> 2:41:24.520]  organization. That would be nice. You know today they're a propaganda front for the Clintons. This
[2:41:24.520 --> 2:41:33.080]  is why we euphemistically called them the Clinton news network. You know in the meantime those who
[2:41:33.080 --> 2:41:40.360]  do want to continue to follow my exploits they can go to StoneColdTruth.com or on Twitter they
[2:41:40.360 --> 2:41:46.280]  can go at Stone Cold Truth. I don't I don't run that feed but they do a pretty good job of
[2:41:46.280 --> 2:41:52.280]  covering what I'm up to whether it is the incredible things we've learned in the JFK
[2:41:52.280 --> 2:41:58.520]  documents that have been declassified or whether it is media matters ignores those of course or
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:06.520]  whether it or whether it is the lawsuit against Twitter itself. It's the best place to go so you
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:12.600]  can still follow my exploits now sooner or later they'll probably block them too even though that's
[2:42:12.600 --> 2:42:20.520]  not my Twitter feed. Somebody set up Roger Stone GOP also not me. They got suspended today. They
[2:42:20.520 --> 2:42:25.960]  got shut down right so well you will not be silenced and you will always be on the war room with us
[2:42:25.960 --> 2:42:29.800]  as well as the Alex Jones show breaking it all down so we'll be sure to follow that but
[2:42:30.600 --> 2:42:36.520]  what Roger just said about CNN is is so true folks look I am a news junkie you honestly
[2:42:36.520 --> 2:42:42.040]  wouldn't even believe it I can't even explain it I I literally monitor like 10 different news every
[2:42:42.040 --> 2:42:49.000]  day I don't even watch CNN and MSNBC anymore because there's zero news value they don't
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:56.200]  even cover news it's Trump bashing and all about all day. We're not just going to have to end in

[2:48:30.760 --> 2:48:36.760]  dot com well roger you clean that up a little bit oh i cleaned it up just a little bit so
[2:48:36.760 --> 2:48:43.160]  we've got hillary clinton you know why won't hillary go away because bill and hillary clinton
[2:48:43.160 --> 2:48:49.400]  are the penicillin resistant syphilis of the american body politic i don't may also have
[2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:54.120]  syphilis i don't know a single professional democrat i have many friends who are democrats
[2:48:54.120 --> 2:49:01.880]  who just don't want the clinton's to go away terrific piece i noticed on msnbc today which
[2:49:01.880 --> 2:49:08.040]  points out that as i have said several times here on info wars michelle obama is the front
[2:49:08.040 --> 2:49:14.680]  runner for the democratic party's nomination in 2020 michelle obama would would be without
[2:49:14.680 --> 2:49:20.680]  any question the strongest nominee for the democratic party michelle obama's candidacy
[2:49:20.680 --> 2:49:27.240]  would end once and for all the influence of the clinton's in the democratic party do not think
[2:49:27.240 --> 2:49:34.360]  that there is any love loss between the clinton's and the obamas there is none uh and i'm predicting
[2:49:34.360 --> 2:49:41.080]  again here today michelle obama will be a candidate for president in 2020 and she is the likely
[2:49:41.080 --> 2:49:45.400]  democratic nominee wow big prediction here from roger stone mark that down in the books
[2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:53.000]  so do you believe uh jone rivers that michelle obama is a transsexual i have no views on that i
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:50:00.040]  do know that the machinery of the democratic party is still firmly in the control of barack obama
[2:50:00.040 --> 2:50:07.320]  and if she should choose to be a candidate she would be a very formidable one how do you explain
[2:50:07.320 --> 2:50:11.480]  that bulge in her dress that's a different question that's a different story we don't need to go down
[2:50:11.480 --> 2:50:16.840]  that uh you know i don't know that's kind of interesting because i think the obamas could
[2:50:16.840 --> 2:50:20.920]  potentially be hurting themselves you haven't heard too much from barack but michelle continues
[2:50:20.920 --> 2:50:27.320]  to go out there she's hosting uh demons at her library to read to children i think that the
[2:50:27.320 --> 2:50:32.680]  more exposure the obamas get the less likely they are to win in another election because like you
[2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:36.600]  said it's just like the same thing with hillary clinton people are just sick of them well i don't
[2:50:36.600 --> 2:50:41.720]  think there's as much of a fatigue about the obamas politically as there is of the clintons
[2:50:41.720 --> 2:50:49.320]  both barack and michelle obama continue to pull much much better than the clintons uh you notice
[2:50:49.320 --> 2:50:58.280]  that she is doing more and more substantive issue oriented stuff out on the road um do not underestimate
[2:50:58.280 --> 2:51:03.640]  that the obama stranglehold on the machinery of the democratic party do not underestimate their
[2:51:03.640 --> 2:51:10.120]  ability to win caucuses and primaries if they choose to do so i'm going to stand by my prediction
[2:51:10.120 --> 2:51:16.840]  michelle obama will be the democratic party candidate for president in 2020 and she should
[2:51:16.840 --> 2:51:23.000]  not be underestimated she will be a formidable candidate all right you heard it here first from
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:28.520]  roger stone again this is info wars so get tomorrow's news today get next week's news today next
[2:51:28.520 --> 2:51:33.720]  month's news today next year's news today next century's news today at info wars dot com you know
[2:51:33.720 --> 2:51:39.960]  we told you about the jfk cover-up declassified documents prove we were right again now you've
[2:51:39.960 --> 2:51:46.200]  got hillary though back to hillary for a second the demon spawn hillary slams trump for denouncing
[2:51:46.200 --> 2:51:53.160]  islamic terrorism's presidents shouldn't point fingers or divide after tragedies this was hillary
[2:51:53.160 --> 2:51:59.480]  clinton on a comedy show uh last night i'm not even going to give it the time of day to plug it
[2:51:59.480 --> 2:52:05.560]  but roger you know this is the same woman that george bush said was like his sister george
[2:52:05.560 --> 2:52:13.560]  bush started a war based on islamic terrorism but hillary's silent on that yeah it's extraordinary
[2:52:13.560 --> 2:52:21.480]  what's happened to the once great democratic party of harry truman and john f kennedy there was a time
[2:52:21.480 --> 2:52:27.880]  when both american parties for example republicans and the democrats were both anti-communist both
[2:52:27.880 --> 2:52:33.640]  patriotic both pro-american they had somewhat different domestic political views but when it
[2:52:33.640 --> 2:52:39.480]  came to foreign policy they were all american now you have a democratic party that will not stand
[2:52:39.480 --> 2:52:47.400]  up to islamic terrorism will not stand up to islamic terrorism victimizing of people who are gay or
[2:52:47.400 --> 2:52:55.080]  lesbian will not stand up for human rights it's a shell of what the party used to be which is why
[2:52:55.080 --> 2:53:03.400]  i think so many working class democrats uh in places like ohio and florida michigan wisconsin
[2:53:03.400 --> 2:53:11.000]  voted for donald trump and would do so again if the election were held again tomorrow despite the
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:20.280]  media onslaught the the unrelenting attacks on our president his popularity uh and his base has
[2:53:20.280 --> 2:53:27.880]  held up all of the sophisticated polling that i had the ability to see when i was in washington
[2:53:27.880 --> 2:53:33.320]  and monday shows that if the election were run again tomorrow he would win again he might even
[2:53:33.320 --> 2:53:41.400]  win by a slightly larger margin the erosion it was in hillary's support oh and that's amazing
[2:53:41.400 --> 2:53:46.600]  considering the the the hatchet job that's been done on the president by the mainstream media
[2:53:46.600 --> 2:53:52.600]  which is why i'm just so perturbed that hillary would continue to do all these media appearance
[2:53:52.600 --> 2:53:59.160]  continue to open her big fat line trap have you ever seen in all of your years being in politics
[2:53:59.160 --> 2:54:04.120]  covering politics have you ever seen a failed presidential candidate that just refuses to
[2:54:04.120 --> 2:54:10.440]  accept her defeat or or his defeat i think this is because the clintons have never had the ability
[2:54:10.440 --> 2:54:17.560]  to see themselves they cannot see how phony they come across they cannot see how disingenuous they
[2:54:17.560 --> 2:54:27.160]  sound they cannot see how um how uh their their public persona uh comes across is so inauthentic
[2:54:27.160 --> 2:54:32.600]  i i thought during the election that this is one of donald trump's greatest attributes everything
[2:54:32.600 --> 2:54:39.720]  he said didn't always come out exactly right uh he isn't polished he he isn't uh he doesn't sound
[2:54:39.720 --> 2:54:45.960]  like he's reading somebody else's words on the contrary he seems genuine he seems real he seems
[2:54:45.960 --> 2:54:53.000]  authentic words and all what you see is what you get he's a real guy and and uh real guys make
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:55:00.600]  mistakes and real guys also uh speak the truth and real guys can inspire everything hillary clinton
[2:55:00.600 --> 2:55:07.160]  ever said was tested focus grouped you could see that she was malving words written by others and
[2:55:07.160 --> 2:55:12.920]  she just comes across as completely phony there's nothing genuine about her she doesn't care about
[2:55:12.920 --> 2:55:19.880]  anyone but herself she doesn't care about anything other than lining her pockets she doesn't have
[2:55:19.880 --> 2:55:25.720]  any guiding philosophy no moral compass she and her husband would steal a hot stove they're not
[2:55:25.720 --> 2:55:31.800]  liberals they're not progressives the sanders wing of the party figured this out they she stands for
[2:55:31.800 --> 2:55:38.440]  nothing but the aggrandizement of the clinton's and the greater enrichment of she and her husband
[2:55:38.440 --> 2:55:44.040]  and her greedy crooked little daughter hillard uh chelsea who is of course the daughter of
[2:55:44.040 --> 2:55:51.480]  webster hubble and she is essentially the king rat of the swamp but what's confusing to me about
[2:55:51.480 --> 2:55:56.040]  this whole thing and this has always been confusing to me when we see the left react to radical
[2:55:56.040 --> 2:56:02.680]  islamic terrorism why is it hillary said hillary clinton slams trumpford announcing islamic
[2:56:02.680 --> 2:56:09.560]  terrorism the stories on info wars dot com right now by steve watson wait a second what happened
[2:56:09.560 --> 2:56:16.360]  on 9 11 roger i i it just it's infuriated me i'll go with the official story i'm not even
[2:56:16.360 --> 2:56:21.640]  going to sit here and debate the official story let's just say on september 11th an event that
[2:56:21.640 --> 2:56:27.320]  was coordinated by osama bin laden radical islamic terrorist killed 3 000 people in united states so
[2:56:27.960 --> 2:56:34.280]  if that's the fact why are you not allowed to slam why are you not allowed to denounce radical
[2:56:34.280 --> 2:56:39.080]  islamic terrorism if they're killing people by the thousands in our country and trying to murder us
[2:56:39.080 --> 2:56:44.200]  and in our way of life why won't hillary clinton denounce that because it would hurt her within
[2:56:44.200 --> 2:56:50.200]  the base of the democratic party because it's politically incorrect to be hardline on radical
[2:56:50.200 --> 2:56:56.600]  islam this was a major factor in president donald trump's election he was willing to call it as it
[2:56:56.600 --> 2:57:03.160]  is uh and the democrats still domain still insist on pushing footing their way around this question
[2:57:03.720 --> 2:57:08.680]  uh if it plays out that way in another presidential campaign you're going to have
[2:57:08.680 --> 2:57:19.080]  the exact same results you know roger politics is obviously a dirty game we know that but
[2:57:19.880 --> 2:57:27.480]  the clintons are just straight up dirty nasty criminal thieves i i i just can't believe that
[2:57:27.480 --> 2:57:34.280]  this woman is still even allowed to not just go on tv but walk freely this woman should be in jail

[3:00:14.200 --> 3:00:19.960]  roger i just realized some great irony here reading donna brazil's story in politico
[3:00:19.960 --> 3:00:26.040]  the headline as donna brazil sells out the dnc and hillary clinton as the sacrificial lamb for
[3:00:26.040 --> 3:00:30.920]  what appears to be some serious money laundering and some shady campaign financing techniques
[3:00:31.720 --> 3:00:37.320]  the headline is inside hillary clinton's secret takeover of the dnc i can't believe i didn't
[3:00:37.320 --> 3:00:45.240]  realize this when i first read this headline secret secret this wasn't not a secret to anyone
[3:00:45.240 --> 3:00:52.440]  the entire dump of wiki leaks emails showed how hillary clinton took over the dnc info wars has
[3:00:52.440 --> 3:00:58.760]  been covering hillary clinton rigging the dnc primaries since they began this is how they trick
[3:00:58.760 --> 3:01:05.560]  the average audience roger inside hillary clinton's secret takeover it was a secret even though info
[3:01:05.560 --> 3:01:11.400]  wars told you even though wiki leaks dropped the emails even though project veritas even exposed
[3:01:11.400 --> 3:01:17.560]  the dnc but it's secret because it wasn't reported on until now according to politico
[3:01:18.360 --> 3:01:23.480]  you know if you look at it uh deborah washerman schultz the former chairwoman of the democrat
[3:01:23.480 --> 3:01:29.080]  the disgraced chairwoman right who was forced to step down after wiki leaks published documents
[3:01:29.080 --> 3:01:34.840]  that indicated that they had to change the rules bend the rules to cheat bernie sanders out of the
[3:01:34.840 --> 3:01:41.720]  nomination by the way uh do you know how the california democratic primary came out in 2016 no
[3:01:41.720 --> 3:01:45.880]  you don't you know why they haven't finished no they haven't finished counting they still haven't
[3:01:45.880 --> 3:01:50.120]  found it finished counting you know why that's because bernie sanders won in a landslide and we
[3:01:50.120 --> 3:01:56.840]  have to we have to repress that look i i know donna brazil i kind of like donna brazil uh in
[3:01:56.840 --> 3:02:02.120]  in all honesty on a personal level our politics are really quite different i was introduced to her by
[3:02:02.120 --> 3:02:07.720]  the reverend al sharpton who i also know uh and who i also on a personal level like even though
[3:02:07.720 --> 3:02:13.160]  our politics are completely opposite uh i'm going to buy her book i think it's going to be very
[3:02:13.160 --> 3:02:18.280]  interesting she clearly is coming out from under the yoke of the clinton's now and i think there's
[3:02:18.280 --> 3:02:24.120]  going to be a lot of truth telling there about how the dnc was run but in the case of washerman
[3:02:24.120 --> 3:02:32.360]  schultz uh a a guy jumped in the primary against her two years ago uh uh who's uh name escapes me
[3:02:32.360 --> 3:02:41.400]  at the moment but uh he got 40 plus percent of the vote just based on her theft of the uh of the
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:48.920]  nomination from bernie sanders he was a sanders supporter and he's running again and now he has
[3:02:48.920 --> 3:02:56.680]  not only that issue but he also has her involvement with the awan brothers uh and the fact that she
[3:02:57.240 --> 3:03:05.480]  allowed these two pakistani hackers in essence uh access to the dnc computers now what's important
[3:03:05.480 --> 3:03:09.560]  to understand here while they were even in pakistan and what's important here to understand is that
[3:03:10.200 --> 3:03:16.840]  after she was formally informed by the capitol hill police that the awan brothers were under
[3:03:16.840 --> 3:03:24.280]  investigation for stealing data and money she changed their status within the house computer
[3:03:24.280 --> 3:03:31.240]  system from consultant to employee so that their access to the us house of representatives computer
[3:03:31.240 --> 3:03:40.600]  would be uninterrupted that makes her an accessory to their thievery of both data and money so lock
[3:03:40.600 --> 3:03:47.720]  her up debora washam and schultz they're coming for you next we literally have literally books i mean
[3:03:47.720 --> 3:03:53.720]  but it's like we have like an encyclopedia of all of the clinton corruption ranging from bill
[3:03:53.720 --> 3:03:59.080]  clinton's time in arkansas to bill clinton's time as president uh you know selling nuclear
[3:03:59.080 --> 3:04:03.480]  secrets to the chinese selling us out to russia with hillary clinton and the iranian one deal

[3:06:22.840 --> 3:06:27.800]  well it doesn't matter that we just had a radical islam terror attack
[3:06:27.800 --> 3:06:35.160]  alahu akbar in new york city it doesn't matter that we're told that on september 11th that
[3:06:35.160 --> 3:06:41.960]  radical islamic terrorists led by osama bin ladin wanted to kill thousands of americans
[3:06:41.960 --> 3:06:48.440]  and destroy our way of life none of that matters to hillary clinton all that matters is don't offend
[3:06:48.440 --> 3:06:52.920]  the muslims white males are the problem not the muslims don't you get that so hillary clinton
[3:06:52.920 --> 3:07:02.600]  not even what 48 hours removed from a radical islamic terror attack in new york city goes on
[3:07:02.600 --> 3:07:11.720]  the daily show a comedy show a joke show so a joke woman goes on a joke show and demonizes
[3:07:11.720 --> 3:07:20.680]  president trump for daring to call out radical islamic terror talk about what happened with the
[3:07:20.680 --> 3:07:27.720]  event that they are concerned about but not to point fingers not to scapegoat not to try to
[3:07:27.720 --> 3:07:35.480]  set americans against each other and unfortunately that just is not part of our current president
[3:07:35.480 --> 3:07:40.760]  accepts or is willing to perform you know of course you can have his own point of view and and
[3:07:41.480 --> 3:07:47.880]  push his policies that goes with the job but not to continue to divide americans against each other
[3:07:47.880 --> 3:07:55.960]  so he just doesn't have any empathy and you can disagree with somebody over all kinds of partisan
[3:07:55.960 --> 3:08:03.960]  issues but you want to have a president who can try to put himself into the shoes the feelings
[3:08:03.960 --> 3:08:09.240]  of somebody else and he has not been able to what in the hell is she talking about
[3:08:10.840 --> 3:08:16.520]  president trump is putting his his himself in the shoes of people that died because of a radical
[3:08:16.520 --> 3:08:22.200]  out of walk bar and hillary clinton goes on a joke television show with a joke host
[3:08:25.880 --> 3:08:31.720]  we're joined by john rapaport now john i don't even know how to i'm like i i go through phases
[3:08:31.720 --> 3:08:37.880]  honestly in this very demanding mental job that we have here covering this nonsense and this
[3:08:37.880 --> 3:08:43.560]  corruption every day i go through phases i'm like on the brink of a phase now i can't even deal with
[3:08:43.560 --> 3:08:47.880]  this anymore i can't look at hillary clinton anymore i can't listen to her voice anymore this woman
[3:08:49.320 --> 3:08:57.640]  is such a lying demon freak i can't believe that she would get up there and spread these lies
[3:08:57.640 --> 3:09:01.800]  say that trump is the one with a cold heart when she's literally the most cold-hearted woman i've
[3:09:01.800 --> 3:09:08.120]  ever heard of john try to bring me back to earth here man because i can't i'm literally fuming
[3:09:08.120 --> 3:09:15.960]  that hillary clinton said this stuff well as you know and as uh most of our listeners know
[3:09:15.960 --> 3:09:25.880]  this is the tactic of the people who are trying to demolish what is left of the united states
[3:09:26.920 --> 3:09:34.200]  they blame their crimes and their point of view and their state of mind on other people
[3:09:34.200 --> 3:09:40.200]  so whatever it is that they're guilty of they will tell you that somebody else
[3:09:41.880 --> 3:09:47.000]  in this case their enemies are guilty of that's their strategy it always has been
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:53.480]  it's the msn strategy of news we're lying so we accuse other people of lying
[3:09:54.520 --> 3:10:00.360]  we're committing crimes and keeping vital information from people so we accuse independent
[3:10:00.360 --> 3:10:08.680]  media of doing that she has no empathy therefore she accuses trump in this case could be anybody of
[3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:15.640]  having no empathy it's just the tactic it's a psychological tactic these people are so embedded
[3:10:15.640 --> 3:10:20.520]  in it that they can't get out of it and they never will be able to get out of it it's now a
[3:10:20.520 --> 3:10:27.000]  compulsion and an obsession with them what am i guilty of okay now i've got to find somebody else
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:35.720]  to blame and say they're the ones who did it so this goes on and on how do we because you know i'm
[3:10:35.720 --> 3:10:41.160]  a constitutionalist fully on with the bill of rights i don't want to stop anyone's free speech
[3:10:43.320 --> 3:10:49.800]  but at the same time we have a conservative nature that puts protecting our way of life
[3:10:49.800 --> 3:10:57.640]  and keeping the ideas that created america going and you see someone like hillary clinton
[3:10:57.640 --> 3:11:03.640]  and the the host of the fake news program that she was on literally trying to destroy our country
[3:11:04.200 --> 3:11:10.280]  and destroy the very fabric of truth to literally distort reality i mean how do we deal with this
[3:11:10.280 --> 3:11:15.560]  because i can't stop her right to free speech i'll tell you what john i'll ask the same question i
[3:11:15.560 --> 3:11:23.720]  ask of leon macadoo if hillary clinton or people of her ilk that have been breaking the law and
[3:11:23.720 --> 3:11:31.400]  lying to americans for dozens of years if no one is put behind bars let's say trump is in for eight
[3:11:31.400 --> 3:11:37.800]  years if no one inside hillary clinton's ilk that breaks the law hand over fist steals money
[3:11:37.800 --> 3:11:47.800]  if no one ends up behind bars is justice dead in this country no because it's already been dead
[3:11:48.360 --> 3:11:55.720]  i mean you could ask the same question about the cia you could say well if nobody from the cia has
[3:11:55.720 --> 3:12:03.640]  gone to jail since 1947 when the cia was created and the cia is roaming all over the world committing
[3:12:03.640 --> 3:12:10.760]  one crime after another in serial fashion and no significant figure inside the cia is ever
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:18.680]  sent to prison is justice dead sure in a sense it's been dead for a long time but that doesn't mean
[3:12:18.680 --> 3:12:27.320]  that we stop and say there's nothing that can be done can we restore it though oh yeah we're in
[3:12:27.320 --> 3:12:32.920]  this fight as you well know and we're scoring victories every day because more and more people
[3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:40.920]  are waking up and the seesaw has been tilting for quite some time now from major media mind control
[3:12:40.920 --> 3:12:48.040]  to independent media it's tilting in our direction more and more people who are completely disgusted
[3:12:48.040 --> 3:12:55.240]  with the status quo and the way things are done are waking up to the truth and that is called
[3:12:55.240 --> 3:13:02.600]  pressure my friends pressure builds and builds and builds to the point where the people who are
[3:13:02.600 --> 3:13:10.840]  in power can ignore it no longer and they begin to make more and more grievous mistakes tell more
[3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:18.600]  and more obvious lies i remain optimistic that's all i can tell you yeah no and actually i do agree
[3:13:18.600 --> 3:13:22.440]  with everything you said i i actually broke this down on the war room yesterday which is
[3:13:22.440 --> 3:13:27.160]  gonna kick off here right after the conclusion of the alex joneshow when uh john rapaport signs off
[3:13:27.160 --> 3:13:33.800]  you know we are in the in the beginning of the american renaissance and at the end of the day
[3:13:33.800 --> 3:13:37.640]  everyone will end up on the trump movement i'm just calling it the trump movement because that
[3:13:37.640 --> 3:13:44.040]  is the beachhead that is the spear that broke the establishment's armor if you will and eventually
[3:13:44.040 --> 3:13:48.520]  after you know who knows how long it will take i mean the the original renaissance i think they
[3:13:48.520 --> 3:13:55.720]  say took 300 years so who knows how long it'll take now i guess it's just i guess it's just that
[3:13:55.720 --> 3:14:00.760]  we really care about people too much i really care about the truth and justice too much that
[3:14:00.760 --> 3:14:06.200]  sitting here having to watch hillary clinton a known criminal go on television and smear
[3:14:06.200 --> 3:14:10.680]  donald trump for talking about radical islamic terror that just killed eight people in new york
[3:14:10.680 --> 3:14:18.440]  it just makes me so sick it makes my head spin i understand believe me i've been at that crossroad
[3:14:18.440 --> 3:14:25.640]  many times over the last 35 years working as a reporter and uh what i finally came to decide was
[3:14:28.040 --> 3:14:33.560]  you just keep going because what is the alternative you're going to stop no nobody we're not going to
[3:14:33.560 --> 3:14:42.760]  stop so there are these moments when it it feels like it's too much you can't get past it but then
[3:14:42.760 --> 3:14:51.640]  the sun rises tomorrow and you are past it you know and you're onward and uh you have renewed
[3:14:51.640 --> 3:14:58.360]  energy because you know that you're on the side of the truth and what's right and that is a motivation
[3:14:58.360 --> 3:15:04.920]  that can't be uh overestimated it's it's that powerful the establishment essentially the deep
[3:15:04.920 --> 3:15:11.720]  state has dozens even hundreds of tokyo roses out there basically telling to tell the left that
[3:15:11.720 --> 3:15:15.800]  they still have victory and donald trump and his movement is losing even though as you said we're
[3:15:15.800 --> 3:15:21.480]  absolutely absolutely kicking ass it's not even close trumps movement is winning hand over fist
[3:15:21.480 --> 3:15:27.640]  but you know it's just i think that what we're in the midst of right now just like the american
[3:15:27.640 --> 3:15:33.720]  revolution defeated the british world empire that was so powerful nobody thought they could be defeated
[3:15:33.720 --> 3:15:41.640]  america is now back to defeat the global empire america is now back to defeat the globalist new
[3:15:41.640 --> 3:15:46.760]  world order empire that nobody thought could be beat that's what they said about the british empire
[3:15:46.760 --> 3:15:53.720]  the americans beat that guess what globalist we're going to beat you too this is michael david from

[3:20:19.800 --> 3:20:26.760]  info wars you know i want to repeat something that i said a couple weeks ago when i was on
[3:20:28.120 --> 3:20:34.920]  because i find that fewer and fewer people understand what free market and capitalism
[3:20:34.920 --> 3:20:41.720]  really means we're not talking about crony capitalism secret backroom deals we're not
[3:20:41.720 --> 3:20:52.360]  talking about globalism we're talking about transfer from you to me from you to you from

[3:21:36.200 --> 3:21:46.920]  the truth at info wars it's that simple it's that free it's that straightforward nobody else is
[3:21:46.920 --> 3:21:55.720]  involved in these transactions that's called the open market that's what kids don't learn about in
[3:21:55.720 --> 3:22:04.040]  school anymore somebody recent article indicates that 43 percent of millennials would prefer to live
[3:22:04.040 --> 3:22:15.080]  under socialism and communism what obviously these youngins don't have a clue not a clue as to what
[3:22:15.080 --> 3:22:21.480]  would really happen to them they think it's all mommy and daddy protecting them and free these
[3:22:21.480 --> 3:22:33.080]  flow in from the sky and from who knows where and all as well all as well but it's not because
[3:22:33.080 --> 3:22:42.120]  they're never educated in the very basics of the free market they don't know what it is they wouldn't
[3:22:42.120 --> 3:22:51.400]  know what it is if it's suddenly reared up and bit them you work you earn money you decide to spend
[3:22:51.400 --> 3:23:00.680]  money on something that you consider valuable in this case info wars life dot com products
[3:23:02.280 --> 3:23:08.600]  that money goes to info wars it's spent on the operation of info wars which is to spread the
[3:23:08.600 --> 3:23:15.320]  truth to wake people up what i was talking about with oland in the last segment to wake people
[3:23:15.320 --> 3:23:23.800]  up and thereby exert more and more pressure on the powers that be and believe me they can feel it
[3:23:23.800 --> 3:23:34.280]  they know it's there get that simple fact what globalism wants to do is to come in and promise
[3:23:34.280 --> 3:23:41.000]  the moon and say you see we understand that you're helpless you're dependent you can't do anything
[3:23:41.000 --> 3:23:47.640]  of course of course of course of course and then as an aside they say well we understand that because
[3:23:47.640 --> 3:23:55.000]  we helped make you that way but you don't hear that part and now that you're helpless and dependent
[3:23:55.560 --> 3:24:01.080]  and needy always needing more and more and more don't worry we'll take care of you
[3:24:01.080 --> 3:24:08.520]  you all you have to do is allow us to erase all borders and nations and create one planet
[3:24:09.080 --> 3:24:15.400]  indivisible with no liberty and no justice for all and then we can take over and then we can bring
[3:24:15.400 --> 3:24:23.240]  in a technocratic society in which everything is ruled and measured and quoted you get this you
[3:24:23.240 --> 3:24:28.840]  get that you don't get that leave all that us we are the globalists we'll take care of you
[3:24:28.840 --> 3:24:37.560]  you that's the new system well gee that sounds great i like that you mean i don't have to do
[3:24:37.560 --> 3:24:44.200]  anything i don't have to work i don't have to think i don't have to exert effort determination
[3:24:44.200 --> 3:24:49.320]  i don't have to have a vision of what i want for my own life yes that's right that's right
[3:24:49.320 --> 3:24:59.320]  it'll all be well it'll all be well and then you get a giant society based on this where
[3:24:59.320 --> 3:25:06.280]  government contracts are feeding and fueling gigantic companies and corporations that claim
[3:25:06.280 --> 3:25:14.520]  that they're making huge amounts of profits yeah because they're in the government trough
[3:25:14.520 --> 3:25:23.960]  which is the tax trough and the invented money trough and we're pulling this back down to the
[3:25:23.960 --> 3:25:37.960]  simplest best system called free market okay i want to shift gears here because for me this is
[3:25:37.960 --> 3:25:45.000]  opioid epidemic week in every venue that i can get access to but for this audience i want to
[3:25:45.720 --> 3:25:51.480]  present some background you've all heard now about the opioid epidemic that is raging throughout
[3:25:52.280 --> 3:25:59.720]  the u.s england and many other countries around the world these are devastating drugs far more
[3:25:59.720 --> 3:26:07.560]  powerful than morphine synthetic drugs that are addicting people that lead to their one of the
[3:26:07.560 --> 3:26:11.800]  things that we can do is look at blister packs as an alternative to how opioids are dispensed
[3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:16.840]  right now and perhaps package opioids in blister packs where it might come in a two four six or
[3:26:16.840 --> 3:26:25.160]  eight west since the year 2000 about 30 000 deaths a year and who knows how much other maiming
[3:26:25.720 --> 3:26:30.760]  and destruction and addiction and so on and so forth that's what we're talking about
[3:26:30.760 --> 3:26:42.520]  but what is the background on that i keep reminding people that this is the globalist
[3:26:42.520 --> 3:26:52.760]  medical cartel at work at the highest levels the medical cartel in the long run is the most
[3:26:52.760 --> 3:27:03.800]  significant cartel in the globalist bag why because through the lifelong treatment from
[3:27:05.160 --> 3:27:12.680]  birth to the cemetery people are diagnosed with one condition after another many of them fake
[3:27:13.720 --> 3:27:21.000]  prescribed incredibly toxic drugs at each stage and then eventually become too
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:29.080]  debilitated to think to resist to understand what's going on and they die and that's the history
[3:27:30.040 --> 3:27:39.320]  that's the history that's the history of many many individuals under the globalist medical
[3:27:39.320 --> 3:27:48.120]  cartel as a reporter for 35 years now i've investigated this up one side and down the
[3:27:48.120 --> 3:27:55.960]  other inside out and upside down and there is no other conclusion to draw except that at the highest
[3:27:55.960 --> 3:28:03.880]  levels of power in the medical cartel at the very highest top of the mountain
[3:28:05.640 --> 3:28:08.200]  these people understand exactly what they're doing
[3:28:09.320 --> 3:28:14.440]  that they are waging essentially chemical warfare against the population of the planet
[3:28:14.440 --> 3:28:21.880]  for the purpose of destroying and debilitating populations making them thus easier to control
[3:28:23.960 --> 3:28:29.880]  that's the back that's what you have to understand before we get into what is happening
[3:28:29.880 --> 3:28:32.920]  in the most chilling epidemic that i have seen
[3:28:34.680 --> 3:28:41.800]  in terms of its instant destruction in my 35 years of reporting which is the opioid epidemic

[3:33:29.000 --> 3:33:34.840]  john matt support here sitting in for alex on the fourth hour talking about the opioid epidemic
[3:33:34.840 --> 3:33:43.080]  this is a global alert you have to understand what is going on i've given you the background
[3:33:43.080 --> 3:33:49.800]  in the last segment this is the globalist medical cartel at the highest level toxifying
[3:33:50.360 --> 3:33:58.840]  poisoning waging chemical warfare against the population opioid pharmaceuticals okay
[3:33:58.840 --> 3:34:09.240]  like demoral like percocet percadan oxycontin fentanyl synthetics which are far more powerful
[3:34:09.800 --> 3:34:17.880]  than morphine i stopped counting how many of these opioid pharmaceuticals there are when i got to
[3:34:17.880 --> 3:34:26.280]  fifty there are probably a hundred of them these pills are reaching addicts all over the world
[3:34:26.280 --> 3:34:32.600]  and i'm not just talking about people who have been living on the streets for a long time i'm
[3:34:32.600 --> 3:34:42.200]  talking about all kinds of people in every segment of the population and these drugs sedate
[3:34:42.200 --> 3:34:50.840]  and sedate and sedate the longer you take them respiratory depression shutting down of systems
[3:34:50.840 --> 3:35:04.920]  in the body death addiction destruction chemical warfare 300 000 deaths estimated in the us since
[3:35:04.920 --> 3:35:14.920]  the year 2000 roughly 30 000 deaths a year and it's on the increase a few significant facts
[3:35:14.920 --> 3:35:23.240]  that we have to understand there are yes honest and honorable people working for the dea the drug
[3:35:23.240 --> 3:35:30.600]  enforcement administration who are trying to shut down the illegal trafficking of these opioids in
[3:35:30.600 --> 3:35:44.600]  america and they are being hamstrung and straightjacketed okay because in the year 2016 a law was
[3:35:44.600 --> 3:35:51.320]  passed that contained essentially a secret session section that was voted on unanimously
[3:35:51.320 --> 3:36:06.280]  by both houses of congress and signed by obama that made the dea painted into an almost impossible
[3:36:06.280 --> 3:36:15.640]  corner to stop huge trafficking shipments of opioid pills from manufacturers and distributors
[3:36:17.160 --> 3:36:27.080]  onto addicts the dea can easily spot these gigantic shipments as being trafficking as opposed
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:36.200]  to any legitimate medical use they could freeze these shipments but now they are literally hamstrung
[3:36:36.200 --> 3:36:47.000]  by this law that was passed by a secret session a section in that law that must be repealed
[3:36:48.920 --> 3:36:55.720]  the washington post of all people asked obama and former attorney general lynch the bretel
[3:36:55.720 --> 3:37:07.560]  lynch to comment on this law and they refused they refused to say anything refused declined well
[3:37:07.560 --> 3:37:11.720]  it's killing all kinds of people and addicting everybody and the law makes it almost impossible
[3:37:11.720 --> 3:37:21.960]  to dea to act but you know what i think i'll decline to comment on this really this is the
[3:37:21.960 --> 3:37:29.480]  attitude of a former president i think i'll decline to comment on this okay
[3:37:31.960 --> 3:37:41.720]  an insider with whom i spoke absolutely reliable somebody who has been fighting valiantly for years
[3:37:41.720 --> 3:37:53.160]  to put a lid on this trafficking of destructive opioids explained in a conversation with me
[3:37:53.160 --> 3:38:02.760]  about three weeks ago the pipeline how it works okay i'ma give it to you as quickly as i can
[3:38:04.040 --> 3:38:10.600]  imagine this out in the middle of nowhere in a nowhere area where hardly anybody lives in a very
[3:38:10.600 --> 3:38:16.600]  small town there is a little pharmacy and a little medical clinic and in that medical clinic there
[3:38:16.600 --> 3:38:25.960]  are one or two doctors who are writing 50 to 100 prescriptions a day a day for various opioid drugs
[3:38:28.120 --> 3:38:33.560]  every month like clockwork people are flying in from all over the country to this nowhere little
[3:38:33.560 --> 3:38:41.000]  where little place in a nowhere town out in no where'sville to buy prescriptions and get them
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:47.880]  filled and fly home and start to sell these to street dealers who sell them to addicts at every
[3:38:47.880 --> 3:38:58.920]  level of society a little pain clinic or a little pharmacy could have on hand at any one time a million
[3:38:58.920 --> 3:39:08.520]  opioid pills a million which they could sell in the course of a year and there are many of these
[3:39:08.520 --> 3:39:16.920]  little operations all over the country where do these millions of opioid pills come from they
[3:39:16.920 --> 3:39:23.240]  come from distributors what is a distributor it is a legitimate company that is in the business
[3:39:23.240 --> 3:39:31.720]  of wholesaling medicines medical drugs of all kinds to pharmacies but in this case the distributors
[3:39:31.720 --> 3:39:39.400]  are aware that they are also drug traffickers and where are the distributors getting their
[3:39:39.400 --> 3:39:48.360]  millions of opioid pills from the pharmaceutical manufacturers who are also aware that they are
[3:39:48.360 --> 3:39:58.520]  engaging in drug trafficking that's pipeline number one there's another one too which i have
[3:39:58.520 --> 3:40:02.200]  time to get to i will but i want you to understand how this works
[3:40:05.960 --> 3:40:15.720]  Purdue pharmaceuticals and incis insys pharmaceuticals have now come under the
[3:40:15.720 --> 3:40:23.960]  scope of law enforcement in america Purdue which made about 35 billion dollars on oxycontin and
[3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:34.360]  opioid ended up being fined wait for it 600 million dollars and several executives prosecuted
[3:40:34.360 --> 3:40:41.800]  criminally ended up with a sentence of 400 hours of community service
[3:40:41.800 --> 3:40:55.160]  that was Purdue pharmaceuticals under the sackler family now john capoor k a p o o r has been arrested
[3:40:55.880 --> 3:41:04.040]  he is the founder of incis pharmaceuticals for also bribery and fraud what these major
[3:41:04.040 --> 3:41:09.800]  pharmaceutical companies do among other things in their racketeering activities
[3:41:09.800 --> 3:41:19.400]  is bribe and pay doctors and so forth to say and researchers to say these drugs are not all that
[3:41:19.400 --> 3:41:25.240]  harmful they can be used long term for many different conditions even conditions that
[3:41:25.240 --> 3:41:35.560]  were not approved etc etc etc this is criminal fraud this is chemical warfare being justified
[3:41:35.560 --> 3:41:49.960]  against the population there is another pipeline and the dea is well aware of it and i have written
[3:41:49.960 --> 3:41:54.840]  articles about this over at no more fake news sightings sources and their comments it's in the
[3:41:54.840 --> 3:42:03.800]  open source literature it's there it's in even the mainstream press underground labs in china
[3:42:03.800 --> 3:42:15.640]  that are making designer spinoffs of a drug like fentanyl much more powerful than fentanyl
[3:42:15.640 --> 3:42:22.760]  and these are apparently coming in illegally up through mexico into the united states another
[3:42:22.760 --> 3:42:32.200]  reason for border control we'll get to the rest of that pipeline because it's very important to
[3:42:32.200 --> 3:42:38.200]  understand the killer effects involved there but we're coming up on a break just keep in mind

[3:47:01.640 --> 3:47:19.080]  here in our last segment the fourth hour sitting in for alex at info wars
[3:47:21.240 --> 3:47:30.040]  the dea is now admitting openly that many of these opioid drugs which are really designers
[3:47:30.040 --> 3:47:39.880]  spin-offs are coming from underground chinese labs into the u.s. and other countries this is so
[3:47:39.880 --> 3:47:47.080]  serious that they are throwing up their hands the dea and saying we don't know how to contain it we
[3:47:47.080 --> 3:47:55.880]  don't know what to do about it and some of these designer compounds are getting into the standard
[3:47:55.880 --> 3:48:05.080]  toxic opioids like fentanyl and so forth and nobody knows it the dealers don't know it the addicts
[3:48:05.080 --> 3:48:14.520]  certainly don't know it and this can be death not long-term addiction but short-term death
[3:48:15.080 --> 3:48:21.560]  because the drugs are so powerful that's why i'm going into detail here that's why
[3:48:21.560 --> 3:48:29.480]  i'm issuing this alert to everybody who's listening to get this message out there
[3:48:31.400 --> 3:48:41.160]  on top of all of this we have a drug called car fentanyl that is also getting into the pipeline
[3:48:41.160 --> 3:48:51.560]  the opioid pipeline and car fentanyl is an elephant tranquilizer it is thousands of times
[3:48:51.560 --> 3:48:59.720]  more potent and powerful than fentanyl which is already about 50 times more powerful than morphine
[3:48:59.720 --> 3:49:09.960]  and if you know what morphine is you know that it is a powerful painkiller car fentanyl is instant
[3:49:09.960 --> 3:49:18.440]  death if it's mixed into the powder the capsules the pills whatever who is going to know
[3:49:20.520 --> 3:49:28.040]  who is going to know this is happening folks again in the open source
[3:49:30.600 --> 3:49:37.160]  the dea is saying and they're even calling it first responders in other words the people
[3:49:37.160 --> 3:49:45.160]  from law enforcement who are trying to do their jobs who encounter trafficking shipments of these
[3:49:45.160 --> 3:49:54.760]  drugs have to be extremely careful not to inhale them if they have a cut not to allow any of the
[3:49:54.760 --> 3:50:03.880]  drug in there because a tiny tiny amount can cause instant death that's what we're dealing with here
[3:50:03.880 --> 3:50:07.560]  that is what we're dealing with here
[3:50:12.120 --> 3:50:17.880]  people have to wake up and understand this they have to get what is happening here
[3:50:21.880 --> 3:50:27.560]  you know on the other side of this whole thing there are people who are in severe agonizing
[3:50:27.560 --> 3:50:34.280]  pain that need painkillers so what's happening on the other side of the coin many of these people
[3:50:34.280 --> 3:50:39.320]  are finding it much more difficult to get prescriptions from their doctors why because
[3:50:39.320 --> 3:50:47.160]  now there is a tremendous hesitancy and fear inside the medical profession of being accused
[3:50:47.160 --> 3:50:53.240]  of giving out too much of these drugs and so naturally because these people are so stupid
[3:50:53.240 --> 3:51:01.800]  and incompetent they are swinging way over to the other side i know the case because it's been
[3:51:01.800 --> 3:51:11.960]  reported to me by a very reliable friend of a woman who was after surgery in agonizing pain
[3:51:11.960 --> 3:51:17.720]  and her doctors in the hospital were refusing to give her any kinds of serious painkillers
[3:51:17.720 --> 3:51:23.000]  and if it weren't for her husband who was raising holy hell in the hospital almost to the point of
[3:51:23.000 --> 3:51:33.800]  being arrested nothing would have taken away that woman's pain that's the other side of the coin
[3:51:35.400 --> 3:51:44.680]  insanity on both ends this is spreading people this is not diminishing
[3:51:44.680 --> 3:51:54.040]  and as i mentioned in the last segment the dea is hamstrung and put in a straight
[3:51:54.040 --> 3:52:02.840]  jacket by a law passed in 2016 under the obama administration signed by obama
[3:52:04.760 --> 3:52:11.000]  with no comment whatsoever from little brettelinch the attorney general who is in charge of the dea
[3:52:11.000 --> 3:52:19.720]  just let it go by the boards and my insider told me the overwhelming number of congressmen
[3:52:19.720 --> 3:52:25.240]  who voted for this bill from the house and the senate had no idea what they were voting on
[3:52:25.240 --> 3:52:30.280]  as usual they were brain dead they don't read these bills they have no idea what's in them
[3:52:30.280 --> 3:52:38.280]  and there was a secret section in there that made it almost impossible for the dea to stop
[3:52:38.280 --> 3:52:46.280]  gigantic obvious shipments trafficking these dangerous opioids in other words walking into
[3:52:46.280 --> 3:52:51.560]  a pharmaceutical company and saying hey we know from your records that you're about to ship a
[3:52:51.560 --> 3:52:57.720]  million opioid pills to no where town in the middle of nowhere to a small pharmacy so we
[3:52:57.720 --> 3:53:02.760]  know you're a criminal and we're arresting you and we're freezing the shipment can't do it anymore
[3:53:02.760 --> 3:53:13.080]  now the dea has to go through an elaborate process to justify uh and plead and grovel in order to
[3:53:13.800 --> 3:53:19.640]  take action tied up in court pharmaceutical companies who are
[3:53:22.600 --> 3:53:29.560]  operating as killers basically killers are shrugging their shoulders and saying well we're now
[3:53:29.560 --> 3:53:38.120]  well on the way to being immune from prosecution for illegal trafficking as far as the dea is
[3:53:38.120 --> 3:53:44.520]  concerned and so these pharmaceutical companies are plotting and scheming day and night in every
[3:53:44.520 --> 3:53:54.680]  way possible to exempt themselves from discovery prosecution sentencing criminal action while they
[3:53:54.680 --> 3:54:03.000]  pump out more and more of these hideous drugs and addict and kill larger and larger numbers of people
[3:54:06.920 --> 3:54:07.960]  that's what's going on
[3:54:11.720 --> 3:54:19.400]  and it's getting worse getting worse so finally now you hear congress people starting to make
[3:54:19.400 --> 3:54:27.400]  some noises about this well where were you when you voted for the law that hamstrung the dea
[3:54:28.120 --> 3:54:36.760]  where were you where were you when you discovered as early as the year 2000 as i have documented
[3:54:36.760 --> 3:54:44.600]  time and time again that by a very conservative estimate the medical system in america kills
[3:54:44.600 --> 3:54:53.880]  225 000 people every year like clockwork which is 2.25 million deaths at the door of the medical
[3:54:53.880 --> 3:55:04.120]  cartel every decade where were you where have you been you know i've got to maybe wrap this up
[3:55:04.840 --> 3:55:09.400]  i know a lot of people out there and with very good reason and so forth they're always looking
[3:55:09.400 --> 3:55:18.120]  for the most esoteric possible uh means by which people are being attacked in this society
[3:55:21.240 --> 3:55:28.760]  fine go to it you bet absolutely i'm with you but at the same time be willing to look at what's
[3:55:28.760 --> 3:55:40.520]  in front of your nose right now that there is a system firmly planted in the soil of this country
[3:55:40.520 --> 3:55:47.080]  in other countries around the world called the medical cartel which by a mainstream impeccable
[3:55:47.080 --> 3:55:52.920]  meticulous you know all the credentials were there in the year 2000 yearly american medical

[3:56:00.840 --> 3:56:08.520]  000 people a year and the boys have put up on the screen here's johns hopkins study suggests
[3:56:08.520 --> 3:56:14.360]  medical errors the third leading cause of death in the u.s that comes 16 years later after dr
[3:56:14.360 --> 3:56:21.640]  barber starfield established that medical destruction is at least the third leading
[3:56:21.640 --> 3:56:29.160]  cause of death in the u.s what would you say if one of these esoteric things you could actually
[3:56:29.160 --> 3:56:34.360]  say look here in the journal american medical association if you want to know what the killer
[3:56:34.360 --> 3:56:43.000]  effects are 225 000 deaths a year 2.25 million people in america are being killed every decade
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:52.680]  by the medical system and the fda is aware of it congress is aware of it the pharmaceutical
[3:56:52.680 --> 3:56:59.880]  manufacturers who are doing it are aware of it the american medical association is aware of it
[3:56:59.880 --> 3:57:09.240]  has been aware of it for a long time what do you call people who know for a long long time what
[3:57:09.240 --> 3:57:19.960]  their own actions are causing and do nothing about it killers is what you call murderers
[3:57:19.960 --> 3:57:28.280]  is what you call them because that's what they are and that is the most powerful arm of globalism
