[00:00.000 --> 00:20.440]  An international corporate globalist conspiracy using communism as its operating system is
[00:20.440 --> 00:27.160]  waging war against the nation, state, that's based on free market capitalism and the shining
[00:27.160 --> 00:31.880]  example of that has been the United States of America. That's why anti for the paramilitary
[00:31.880 --> 00:37.480]  arm of the new world order is international. That's why their slogan is no borders, no
[00:37.480 --> 01:03.320]  walls, no USA at all. And all over the world, United States citizens are being brutally
[01:03.320 --> 01:10.560]  attacked by Muslims, by Africans, by people from the Middle East, from Asia. The thing
[01:10.560 --> 01:16.960]  to do is attack white people because the international Marxist globalist system run
[01:16.960 --> 01:23.040]  by the big mega banks and by big tech is teaching that to create the collapse of society and
[01:23.040 --> 01:27.920]  enslave the first world along with the third world that they're now exploiting. You're
[01:27.920 --> 01:36.160]  watching video of anti fob, ball off cocktails, burning and attacking the US Embassy in Athens
[01:36.160 --> 01:50.520]  Greece. The mega banks want to consolidate and vertically integrate the economy. They
[01:50.520 --> 01:55.200]  want to bankrupt the middle class whether you'd be brown, black or white. It is their
[01:55.200 --> 02:02.440]  sworn globalist goal. And the communists are now heavily financed and are attacking the
[02:02.440 --> 02:09.600]  US Embassy. That's why Senator Cotton of Arkansas, Army veteran himself has come out
[02:09.600 --> 02:18.720]  and said send in the troops and you've got traders like the Democrat Mattis saying that
[02:18.720 --> 02:25.000]  Trump's a danger of the Constitution. When you have leftist governors pushing insurrection
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.600]  in a breakdown of society after a three month lockdown to bankrupt the economy and they're
[02:29.600 --> 02:34.680]  now going from mail in ballots to email ballots and they're openly saying the borders shouldn't
[02:34.680 --> 02:41.120]  exist while the lockdown causes a total third world collapse and hundreds of millions coming
[02:41.120 --> 02:45.680]  our way. And the UN says that's the plan, bringing hundreds of millions that they control
[02:45.680 --> 02:51.680]  politically. And then because those people aren't white, you divide them into racial
[02:51.680 --> 03:00.240]  groups as their uniform to control them. This is a classical gang takeover. Of course the
[03:00.240 --> 03:04.360]  brown people coming in aren't going to take over anything. They're just being used as
[03:04.360 --> 03:13.080]  pawns on the chessboard. It is the 31st anniversary of Tiananmen Square when pro-America, pro-democracy
[03:13.080 --> 03:17.080]  demonstrators said we're sick of the Communist Party being our masters. Thousands were machine
[03:17.080 --> 03:25.520]  gunned and run over by armored vehicles. That's a real tyranny when the military comes in
[03:25.520 --> 03:32.520]  to kill peaceful people who are simply peacefully demonstrating for free speech at their university.
[03:32.520 --> 03:38.320]  They had to send troops from 800 miles away because the local troops wouldn't attack them.
[03:38.320 --> 03:44.000]  But when the governors and the mayors encouraged looting and rioting and attacks on white people
[03:44.000 --> 03:53.080]  led by white people, that is not just an insurrection. It is a foreign-funded overthrow of the country.
[03:53.080 --> 03:57.280]  And that's what the Communist and Antifa and all of them say. And the Justice Department
[03:57.280 --> 04:01.400]  opened a criminal investigation into Antifa. They're trying to figure out, quote, who funds
[04:01.400 --> 04:10.320]  it. Well, Alexander Soros captains the main funding group. Soros funds it on record. Bill
[04:10.320 --> 04:16.040]  Ayers and all of them are involved. You have the rise-up different action committees that
[04:16.040 --> 04:21.000]  run full-page ads in the New York Times. We know who prints the signage, who prints the
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.880]  booklets. We know the names of all the people. In fact, you guys have been bringing my New
[04:24.880 --> 04:29.480]  York Times full-page ad from two years ago. It tells you who runs Antifa right there at
[04:29.480 --> 04:34.480]  the bottom. They're the ones buying $100,000 ads in the papers saying rise up, overthrow
[04:34.480 --> 04:39.400]  the government, meaning the elected government and bring in a permanent tyranny, ladies and
[04:39.400 --> 04:45.320]  gentlemen. I'm Mr. Anti-Police State. The lockdown's the police state. The global is
[04:45.320 --> 04:50.000]  coming to take our guns as the police state, telling us we can't have pro-gun demonstrations.
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.760]  It's the Democrats. They're overthrowing the country. We have to save the country. That's
[04:54.760 --> 05:09.320]  what our military does. 60% off. 60% off. 60% off. 60% off. We have not done 60% off
[05:09.320 --> 05:15.840]  across the board in the history of Info Wars. But because things are so crazy, I'm offering
[05:15.840 --> 05:20.040]  the biggest sale in our history. It's a flash sale. I don't know if it's going to last a
[05:20.040 --> 05:25.200]  week, but we're selling out of all the major products because I kind of feel like the Titanic
[05:25.200 --> 05:30.440]  is sinking and we need to have the funds in our bank account to fund the Info War into
[05:30.440 --> 05:35.000]  the future. So take advantage of the looting, the rioting, the death and the martial law

[06:12.960 --> 06:20.200]  In 5-1, 151 days to the incredibly important election, the New World Order globalists are
[06:20.200 --> 06:25.520]  throwing everything they can at either cancel and overthrow Trump via the 25th Amendment,
[06:25.520 --> 06:31.280]  assassinate the president and or steal the election bigger than Dallas. Coming to you
[06:31.280 --> 06:37.960]  live from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, June 4, 2020 transmission,
[06:37.960 --> 06:43.720]  I am your host, Alex Jones. Only way we reach new people, only way we expose the dire straits
[06:43.720 --> 06:49.160]  the Republic is in and save the country and the world is when you get excited and when
[06:49.160 --> 06:55.320]  you spread the live links to newswars.com forward slash show, infowars.com forward slash show
[06:55.320 --> 07:00.760]  and band.video and telling folks about the local AM and FM stations and TV stations that
[07:00.760 --> 07:08.160]  carry this transmission in your area. You are Paul Revere and as you can see, it's not
[07:08.160 --> 07:14.880]  been rhetoric when I've been here on air telling you that get ready for martial law, get ready
[07:14.880 --> 07:22.280]  for civil war, get ready for the Joker movie to lionize and legitimize mass killing of
[07:22.280 --> 07:28.560]  police and white people or anybody that's seen as well to do. It's a fake class struggle
[07:28.560 --> 07:37.280]  by trillion dollar companies run by billionaires worth hundreds of billions apiece who are
[07:37.280 --> 07:43.640]  openly funding Black Lives Matter and Antifa and the communist movement so that you never
[07:43.640 --> 07:47.600]  actually figure out how they destroyed the middle class and how they are consolidating
[07:47.600 --> 07:52.360]  power. They give you the operating system of class struggle and communism through the
[07:52.360 --> 07:58.680]  state-controlled media and state-controlled universities that you go to, believing you're
[07:58.680 --> 08:04.080]  fighting the man, but all you're really doing is removing the last vestiges of the Bill
[08:04.080 --> 08:11.400]  of Rights, the Constitution, elected government, U.S. military so there can be the full takeover
[08:11.400 --> 08:17.760]  by the globalists and that's where we are. The last vestiges of the old republic being
[08:17.760 --> 08:27.280]  swept away and the very IMF World Bank-controlled systems set up by the Rockefeller dynasty
[08:27.280 --> 08:33.680]  that hijacked America and transferred our power to China run giant open-air death camps
[08:33.680 --> 08:40.120]  all over China with Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims. It's an atheist state. Three
[08:40.120 --> 08:47.240]  million Muslims in death camps and even mainstream news admits Apple has them making slave components.
[08:47.240 --> 08:54.880]  But Tim Cook goes around waving his arms around like a demonic leprechaun talking about how
[08:54.880 --> 08:58.640]  he's banning right-wingers and how he loves Black Lives Matter and they're having Black
[08:58.640 --> 09:05.640]  Tuesday hijacking your devices because he cares so much about one black man that died
[09:05.640 --> 09:12.080]  in Minnesota. It's a total fraud and once they get you virtue signaling they have the
[09:12.080 --> 09:19.240]  National Guard bowing to the looters. They have the police bowing to the looters and
[09:19.240 --> 09:31.240]  I watched the videos from Sweden, from Spain, from the United States. It is frothing, hateful,
[09:31.240 --> 09:39.080]  really demonic looking people that are out there attacking. Very low IQ. They could be
[09:39.080 --> 09:45.120]  old, they could be young, they could be black, they could be white. It's just frothing, absolutely
[09:45.120 --> 09:51.240]  hateful people running around throwing mall-off cocktails, attacking the press and just randomly
[09:51.240 --> 09:55.120]  beating up old white women because they're white and screaming, you're an effing white
[09:55.120 --> 10:04.120]  male when they're white. You don't have speech, you're an effing white male, says AIDS Screlics
[10:04.120 --> 10:11.200]  famously to Owen Schreuer. There's no logic, there's no truth in them, there's only the
[10:11.200 --> 10:15.320]  emotion that they went to community college and they were told they were part of a communist
[10:15.320 --> 10:21.160]  uprising and they had power and they were converted over as radicals in that movement
[10:21.160 --> 10:30.040]  believing that some amazing future was coming to them but all that's coming to them is death
[10:30.040 --> 10:36.480]  of the engine of freedom, our free market capitalist system that's been cronyistic and that has
[10:36.480 --> 10:42.960]  had its problems but compared to the other kleptocracies has been the greatest launch
[10:42.960 --> 10:50.040]  point for human invention and human ingenuity and human ideas and a better way of life.
[10:50.040 --> 10:54.800]  But that better way of life took us off the land, it domesticated us and created spoiled
[10:54.800 --> 11:02.800]  brats. My dad was raised on a farm in a ranch and he knows how to do everything from electricity
[11:02.800 --> 11:08.240]  to butcher in a cow to roof in a house. I know a fraction of that and I'll tell you,
[11:08.240 --> 11:14.440]  my children are good and they help clean the house and do things like that but they are
[11:14.440 --> 11:19.440]  domesticated compared to me, compared to my dad or compared to his dad and you go and
[11:19.440 --> 11:25.520]  you look at the people in the inner cities, black, white, old, young, it doesn't matter,
[11:25.520 --> 11:32.360]  they are totally bathed in brainwashing, they are immersed in communist ideology, they are
[11:32.360 --> 11:38.760]  totally disconnected from reality and if you go to a democrat event, everybody's seen
[11:38.760 --> 11:49.600]  the videos, it is so sad how soul sucked and how physically dead-eyed all of the people
[11:49.600 --> 11:57.960]  are. You ask yourself what happened to them, there's no energy, there's no life in them,
[11:57.960 --> 12:02.480]  there's only an idea that they're going to go out and they're going to conquest the country
[12:02.480 --> 12:11.000]  by burning down their own neighborhoods and that's all it is, is a bunch of welfare heads
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.320]  that have got their college degree and have been promised that they are going to have
[12:17.320 --> 12:25.320]  this wonderful future once the communist revolution takes place and they all have a fake punk rock
[12:25.320 --> 12:31.400]  demeanor to them. Now let's get into what's coming up today, I've got a chess board out
[12:31.400 --> 12:34.880]  here because I want to talk about the games that are being played and how we should be
[12:34.880 --> 12:42.120]  smart enough to be outside the game and realize what the end game is because the end game,
[12:42.120 --> 12:50.960]  the end game is death for everybody and this is a game ladies and gentlemen that you do
[12:50.960 --> 12:58.040]  not want to play and there's no doubt that there's a thousand flavors of BS out there
[12:58.040 --> 13:02.600]  but this is the truth, this is how the world really works, we've really done the studying,
[13:02.600 --> 13:08.760]  we know who the players are, this is what the New World Order looks like and we know
[13:08.760 --> 13:11.880]  what the New World Order looks like ladies and gentlemen because they've told us what
[13:11.880 --> 13:16.960]  it is, they're very arrogant about it at the academic level and they talk in Hillary Clinton's
[13:16.960 --> 13:23.400]  emails about her dumb anti-fub baristas that think they're going to rule and how they're
[13:23.400 --> 13:26.600]  going to be rudely awakened when they learn that they've been used to just bring the
[13:26.600 --> 13:29.480]  country down.
[13:29.480 --> 13:34.600]  So when you see these people, you have to remember they are mainly hired fugs and methods
[13:34.600 --> 13:38.960]  at the lowest level, then they're washed out community college students and then they're
[13:38.960 --> 13:44.280]  academics above that and then above that they are governors, they are U.S. senators,
[13:44.280 --> 13:50.640]  they are the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Soroses literally funding these people
[13:50.640 --> 13:59.160]  to absolutely hate the very existence of America itself, that's why Antifa is an international
[13:59.160 --> 14:07.880]  terror group now firebombing U.S. embassies because they are a conquering ideology.
[14:07.880 --> 14:10.720]  They believe they have a right to rule.
[14:10.720 --> 14:17.000]  This is go time, worldwide revolution and Trump's big crime is he's not a globalist
[14:17.000 --> 14:24.360]  and he wasn't going to sit idly by while the Chinese communist century continued to oppress
[14:24.360 --> 14:29.840]  the Chinese people, takes over Hong Kong, takes over Taiwan, takes over Africa, has
[14:29.840 --> 14:34.360]  giant open air death camps everywhere, begins to take over our country, our universities,
[14:34.360 --> 14:42.560]  our way of life as the model of what the future is here on the anniversary of Tiananmen Square.
[14:42.560 --> 14:48.560]  So Tom Cotton send in the troops, we're going to get into his report and what he's talking
[14:48.560 --> 14:53.240]  about, we're being put into artificial martial law, we're being put into civil war, we're
[14:53.240 --> 15:00.520]  being put into lack of law and order so that Trump can be run on the office like Chilchescu
[15:00.520 --> 15:02.520]  but he's not a dictator.
[15:02.520 --> 15:07.720]  This is a leftist foundation run CIA coup, that's why they have all these leftist CIA
[15:07.720 --> 15:13.120]  people going we're very worried that the CIA, that Trump's planning to be a dictator, no
[15:13.120 --> 15:18.560]  you're the ones trying to overthrow elections, you're the ones that tried to have the silent
[15:18.560 --> 15:23.920]  coup, you're the ones that have been caught red handed and they're not giving up, they're
[15:23.920 --> 15:30.400]  more dangerous today than they were six months ago before they were caught red handed.
[15:30.400 --> 15:34.840]  So Limbaugh yesterday was saying everything we told you three years ago about wiretaps
[15:34.840 --> 15:39.600]  on Trump and the silent coup run by Obama and how dangerous it is, but we can't wait
[15:39.600 --> 15:43.760]  three years this time to wake up, I'm going to tell you what's coming next, not what happened
[15:43.760 --> 15:48.680]  three years ago, that's what we do here, nothing against Limbaugh.
[15:48.680 --> 15:53.040]  It's good to see that he's finally figured everything out, but now we've got to expose
[15:53.040 --> 15:56.920]  the next phase of the enemy operation before it's too late.
[15:56.920 --> 16:00.680]  I'm always excited about Info Wars live products, they're amazing, they're cutting edge, you
[16:00.680 --> 16:05.520]  love them, I love them and they fund the Info War in the face of the globalist onslaught,
[16:05.520 --> 16:12.120]  but we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[16:12.120 --> 16:19.880]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it and
[16:19.880 --> 16:26.520]  there's another innovation, it's the spray cap, it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick,
[16:26.520 --> 16:31.880]  gross, you goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really great way, I like
[16:31.880 --> 16:36.440]  to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face, it's got organic alcohol in it, so
[16:36.440 --> 16:41.160]  spray it right in your eyes, but I just love it personally as something that's a moisturizer
[16:41.160 --> 16:42.160]  as well.
[16:42.160 --> 16:45.720]  So, this is a real innovation, I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with
[16:45.720 --> 16:50.840]  a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out, smells
[16:50.840 --> 16:51.840]  great.
[16:51.840 --> 16:57.840]  It's so refreshing, this is a big winner.
[16:57.840 --> 17:04.920]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins, there are many reasons why we need to think
[17:04.920 --> 17:09.520]  about what is really in the air around us, we may not be able to stop breathing, but
[17:09.520 --> 17:11.960]  we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[17:11.960 --> 17:17.400]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against
[17:17.400 --> 17:23.200]  the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air, powerful, quiet and effective, the breeze
[17:23.200 --> 17:28.720]  uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner, similar systems
[17:28.720 --> 17:34.000]  could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars, but the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification
[17:34.000 --> 17:39.160]  is the best and most affordable bar none, the breeze in the ion cluster patented technology

[18:00.080 --> 18:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:08.000 --> 18:17.440]  You are the one they called President.
[18:17.440 --> 18:28.920]  I am Neil before Jones.
[18:28.920 --> 18:30.760]  You are not the President.
[18:30.760 --> 18:35.360]  No one who leads so many could possibly Neil so quickly.
[18:35.360 --> 19:04.640]  I'm the man they're protecting, I'm the President.
[19:04.640 --> 19:11.280]  History and every culture, when you are a slave or when you are bowing to your master
[19:11.280 --> 19:22.040]  or your god, you Neil was all choreographed, first you Neil saying you don't respect the
[19:22.040 --> 19:26.200]  flag of the country you live in, that it's a bad place, you're affiliated with G.G.
[19:26.200 --> 19:34.160]  Ping, that's in finance at all, but now you Neil to show your solidarity and that you're
[19:34.160 --> 19:47.600]  not a racist, but then all it does is cause more burning, more attacks, more death.
[19:47.600 --> 19:50.880]  What are we going to do?
[19:50.880 --> 19:54.240]  How far are we going to bow?
[19:54.240 --> 20:01.760]  And does bowing ever elicit anyone's respect?
[20:01.760 --> 20:09.200]  Anyone that asks you to bow to them, that's not your god that you choose to bow to, is
[20:09.200 --> 20:12.800]  beyond attiring.
[20:12.800 --> 20:24.080]  What they are is cult leaders, and that is exactly what the entire New World Order is.
[20:24.080 --> 20:29.480]  A religion of hating yourself because you're a human, you're bad for the earth, if you're
[20:29.480 --> 20:36.760]  white because you're a racist, if you're straight because you're not cool, because you're having
[20:36.760 --> 20:45.240]  children, you're being taught to have a new religion, to join a suicide cult, the only
[20:45.240 --> 20:56.320]  thing missing at these new quote, anti-god prayer vigils is drinking the Kool-Aid, alright.
[20:56.320 --> 21:04.200]  Let's get into it right now, well Drew Brees came out and said, listen, I'm not going to
[21:04.200 --> 21:07.800]  kneel when the American flag's out because my grandfathers were in World War II and I
[21:07.800 --> 21:13.040]  think America's good, well Twitter banned him for that, blocked his video, everybody
[21:13.040 --> 21:18.760]  else came out and attacked him, the corporate world did, and so he said, I'm sorry, I will
[21:18.760 --> 21:26.280]  bow, I will kneel now, I hate the flag, I mean he didn't actually say, he said, I'm sorry
[21:26.280 --> 21:30.000]  I wasn't sensitive, I didn't understand it, I just meant I was proud of America, but I'm
[21:30.000 --> 21:37.560]  sorry, I denounced myself, you're right, you're right, this is all part of us being trained
[21:37.560 --> 21:41.720]  that we're bad, and once they've done that now, you've got to follow their political
[21:41.720 --> 21:47.120]  will, and it's not black people that you're going to be serving, that's a joke, it's
[21:47.120 --> 21:51.560]  the globalist, it's the academics that were promised all the control, they're the priesthood
[21:51.560 --> 21:58.520]  of the new system, so CNN had one of these globalist big foundation paid hacks on, and
[21:58.520 --> 22:02.160]  it was all set up, they're like, well what about children, what should be happening
[22:02.160 --> 22:09.200]  in schools, well we need to teach the white children, they're inherently bad, and my twelve
[22:09.200 --> 22:14.040]  year old daughter said, yeah dad, everywhere online and in the academic stuff, it's saying
[22:14.040 --> 22:20.360]  whites are inherently bad, think about that, teaching children, everything in their life,
[22:20.360 --> 22:26.400]  is the color of their skin they're bad, and that's the left, that's the globalist.
[22:26.400 --> 22:30.960]  The complete opposite of Martin Luther King, who just stated what was already known, that
[22:30.960 --> 22:35.200]  you should judge people off the character and the content of their deeds, not off what
[22:35.200 --> 22:42.440]  color they are, but all of that's being thrown away, for the new world order, CNN, white children
[22:42.440 --> 22:47.360]  don't deserve innocence, and the left's all about getting rid of the age of consent,
[22:47.360 --> 22:52.400]  hugging children, getting them to take vaccines outside of their parents' wishes, it's about
[22:52.400 --> 23:00.760]  killing innocence, what does evil want, innocence, what does it target, innocence, what does
[23:00.760 --> 23:08.120]  it want to destroy, innocence, because innocence is the genesis of you opening up to the universe
[23:08.120 --> 23:13.240]  and God, and discovering the universe yourself, and having that communion, but if they can't
[23:13.240 --> 23:22.520]  get in front of that first, and teach people to hate themselves, well they're gonna fail,
[23:22.520 --> 23:30.640]  these people are pure psychological warfare evil, and they know they are, the environmental
[23:30.640 --> 23:34.880]  movement's about stealing property, and controlling everyone, and shutting down industry, and
[23:34.880 --> 23:39.400]  only allowing their industry, they know that, they admit that, the whole race-based system
[23:39.400 --> 23:43.040]  is in Hillary's WikiLeaks, where she's talking to a top professor of psychology, and they
[23:43.040 --> 23:49.600]  go, the only answer is to intensify culture war, and that's what you're seeing, and these
[23:49.600 --> 23:53.840]  idiots play along with it because they're followers, because they think it's empowering
[23:53.840 --> 24:00.440]  them, because the media pats them on the head, it's up to us who are leaders, who have red
[24:00.440 --> 24:07.720]  blood to say no to this cult takeover, here's CNN saying we've got to indoctrinate children,
[24:07.720 --> 24:12.200]  and teach them to hate themselves, and have low self-esteem, and to follow orders, and
[24:12.200 --> 24:20.200]  to prove to the new church of the new world order that they atone for their original sin,
[24:20.200 --> 24:23.040]  the new religion, the priesthood, here it is.
[24:23.040 --> 24:27.640]  I think the important thing for white parents to keep in the front of our mind, is that
[24:27.640 --> 24:32.480]  if black children in this country are not allowed innocence and childhood, without fear
[24:32.480 --> 24:37.080]  of being killed by police, or marginalized in some other way, then our children don't
[24:37.080 --> 24:41.720]  deserve innocence, if Tamir Rice can be shot dead in a public park, playing with a toy
[24:41.720 --> 24:46.240]  gun, something white children do all over this country every day, without the same fear
[24:46.240 --> 24:50.840]  of being shot, if Tamir Rice can be killed, then white children need to be told at least
[24:50.840 --> 24:54.880]  at the same age, if they can't be innocent, we don't get to be innocent, and if we would
[24:54.880 --> 24:59.520]  keep that in the front of our minds, then perhaps we would be able to hear what black
[24:59.520 --> 25:02.920]  and brown folks are telling us every day and have been for many years.
[25:02.920 --> 25:08.080]  So what he's saying is, if you buy his premise, human sacrifice, if somebody did something
[25:08.080 --> 25:11.440]  wrong a thousand miles away, let's do something wrong here, there's lots of white kids get
[25:11.440 --> 25:15.480]  shot with guns that look real, that's why they make all the kids toys bright orange
[25:15.480 --> 25:23.280]  now, there's 250 million people, a few kids get shot a year with toy guns, and it's all
[25:23.280 --> 25:27.880]  police are bad, all whites are bad, all of this is not based on logic, because as Rod
[25:27.880 --> 25:42.680]  Sterling, a true patriot said, under a tyranny, truth is a menace, and logic is the enemy,
[25:42.680 --> 25:48.840]  logic is the enemy and truth is a menace, to quote him properly, and that's why you
[25:48.840 --> 25:53.680]  look at these people, they're at war with common sense, that bring me in the statistics
[25:53.680 --> 25:59.280]  from the FBI, 10 to 1 black on white crime, 10 to 1 on average nationwide, some areas
[25:59.280 --> 26:04.560]  is 30, 40 times, I could show you 100 videos of black people killing white people, shooting
[26:04.560 --> 26:08.800]  them and torturing them and beating them in the last couple weeks, we've barely showed
[26:08.800 --> 26:14.880]  it because it's still statistically very low, but if you want to see it, we can show it,
[26:14.880 --> 26:18.680]  or black people killed in these riots, but you'll never see that on the national news
[26:18.680 --> 26:24.400]  because they're not humanizing it by design, they're creating the perception that you're
[26:24.400 --> 26:29.280]  guilty and you're bad, so you've got to do what the cult says, and you've got to go under
[26:29.280 --> 26:34.920]  their control, and these are all creepy evil people that are doing this, but you don't
[26:34.920 --> 26:39.720]  hear a damn thing out of CNN or MSNBC who put up puff pieces for communist China about
[26:39.720 --> 26:45.800]  how they have real live death camps, and how they won't even let black people basically
[26:45.800 --> 26:53.160]  end China, but that's okay because only white people are bad, what a load of BS, now we
[26:53.160 --> 26:55.040]  come back, send in the troops.
[26:55.040 --> 26:59.880]  Now it's official, the United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency
[26:59.880 --> 27:06.000]  will last five years, and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.720]  or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed
[27:10.720 --> 27:15.720]  to have a list of 10 people that you visit, and if you go outside that list of 10, you
[27:15.720 --> 27:21.320]  will be permanently detained, yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the new world order
[27:21.320 --> 27:26.000]  where they let the criminals out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers,
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.080]  and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[27:30.080 --> 27:34.280]  From the beginning of my research it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian anti-human
[27:34.280 --> 27:40.320]  group, they have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their in game
[27:40.320 --> 27:42.680]  which is global depopulation.
[27:42.680 --> 27:49.240]  So you see submitting to them is death, the only way to stop them is to expose them, to
[27:49.240 --> 27:54.680]  hate their guts, and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy, wake up or die.
[27:54.680 --> 27:59.800]  Hey guys, Rob Dew here with infowarsstore.com and I want to tell you about something that
[27:59.800 --> 28:03.720]  I think has really helped me out and I think can help you out too, especially if you have
[28:03.720 --> 28:08.080]  any problems sleeping, and that's knockout, let's face it, our life patterns have been
[28:08.080 --> 28:13.760]  disrupted by this lockdown, this government-imposed imprisonment, and it has definitely affected
[28:13.760 --> 28:14.760]  my sleep schedule.
[28:14.760 --> 28:17.880]  But one thing that has helped is knockout, I take one pill about an hour before I want
[28:17.880 --> 28:20.360]  to go to bed and boom, I get a great night's sleep.
[28:20.360 --> 28:24.320]  And just this past Memorial Day, I took two of them, fell asleep about 1 a.m., woke up
[28:24.320 --> 28:26.480]  at 8 a.m., ready to go.
[28:26.480 --> 28:29.960]  It really has made a difference in my life and it can make a difference in your life
[28:29.960 --> 28:30.960]  too.
[28:30.960 --> 28:32.320]  If you don't get any sleep, you're going to be a grouch.
[28:32.320 --> 28:35.560]  If you get great sleep, you're going to be on point, you're going to be mentally focused,
[28:35.560 --> 28:38.080]  you're going to be ready to take on the day.
[28:38.080 --> 28:43.520]  And right now, knockout is 50% off, it's less than $15 a bottle, you get 30 capsules, give
[28:43.520 --> 28:44.520]  it a try today.
[28:44.520 --> 28:49.200]  It's at a great price right now and it can really help you get the sleep you need, especially
[28:49.200 --> 28:50.640]  in these tough times.
[28:50.640 --> 28:55.360]  It's knockout and it's available at infowarstore.com.
[28:55.360 --> 29:00.600]  I've been fighting the globalist for 26 years and the evil side of me is just so tired of
[29:00.600 --> 29:05.480]  waiting and I'm so ready for physical war that I'm kind of happy about how bad things
[29:05.480 --> 29:10.040]  have gotten because all the delusional folks that don't stand out for the unborn babies
[29:10.040 --> 29:13.800]  that go along with the New World Order, you're about to find out just how sick stuff is.
[29:13.800 --> 29:14.800]  You know what?
[29:14.800 --> 29:17.880]  The average person is still asleep, they don't deserve what's happening to them.
[29:17.880 --> 29:22.600]  So I'm actually sick about what's unfolding right now and I just want to turn things around.
[29:22.600 --> 29:23.600]  But you know what?
[29:23.600 --> 29:25.640]  I can't do that without you.
[29:25.640 --> 29:29.920]  I can't get out of this mess, I can't get out of this stranglehold I'm in unless you
[29:29.920 --> 29:30.920]  decide to get out of it as well.
[29:30.920 --> 29:35.000]  We're all in this together and so if you just realize how important you are, when you just
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.080]  tell people about the local radio stations you're listening to, local TV stations, when
[29:38.080 --> 29:43.800]  you just spread the word about infowarstore.com, when you just buy the products at infowarstore.com,
[29:43.800 --> 29:44.800]  it changes the world.
[29:44.800 --> 29:50.480]  Right now we've got a special that's about to end, 60% off across the board, flash sale
[29:50.480 --> 29:57.760]  that funds the info war and gets you great products at the same time, infowarstore.com.
[29:57.760 --> 30:08.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:08.640 --> 30:14.160]  You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future, not a future
[30:14.160 --> 30:17.240]  that will be but one that might be.
[30:17.240 --> 30:24.280]  This is not a new world, it is simply an extension of what began in the old one, it is patterned
[30:24.280 --> 30:29.040]  itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages
[30:29.040 --> 30:35.280]  of history since the beginning of time, it has refinements, technological advances and
[30:35.280 --> 30:41.200]  a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom, but like every one of the
[30:41.200 --> 30:47.680]  super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule, logic is an enemy and truth is
[30:47.680 --> 30:53.640]  a menace.
[30:53.640 --> 30:59.800]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48 hours on earth, he's a citizen of the
[30:59.800 --> 31:05.720]  state but will soon have to be eliminated because he is built out of flesh and because
[31:05.720 --> 31:07.760]  he has a mind.
[31:07.760 --> 31:27.440]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[31:27.440 --> 31:31.320]  We are back live, we are broadcasting worldwide, the Attorney General Bill Barr is about to
[31:31.320 --> 31:36.400]  come out with announcements, they have leftist arms inside the FBI that have been setting
[31:36.400 --> 31:41.760]  up these right wing provocateur groups, the bugaloo movement and all the rest of it, notice
[31:41.760 --> 31:47.240]  you've got them already charged but no Antifa charge of terrorism, that is outrageous, Antifa
[31:47.240 --> 31:53.400]  is run by Alexander Soros and George Soros, we know the organization that controls it,
[31:53.400 --> 31:59.000]  we know their main website refusefascism.org, a communist international organization, their
[31:59.000 --> 32:03.560]  command and control is all public, their stuff is all printed up centrally in San Francisco
[32:03.560 --> 32:08.480]  and New York and D.C., the U.N. is involved and we have all the internal documents as
[32:08.480 --> 32:13.800]  well at infowars.com to tailing the entire battle plan, documents to tell plan for civil
[32:13.800 --> 32:20.120]  unrest, martial law that was being run by Obama and by Brennan.
[32:20.120 --> 32:26.080]  So if you want to know who's behind all this, FBI here it is, open and shut for you, all
[32:26.080 --> 32:32.640]  right there, everybody just plays dumb like we don't know who these dirtbags are, we've
[32:32.640 --> 32:37.280]  gone to cover Antifa events in places like San Francisco and Berkeley and it's run out
[32:37.280 --> 32:42.600]  of the college, bookstore, I mean they don't even hide this stuff.
[32:42.600 --> 32:48.360]  So bunch of former weathermen, I mean who do you think runs all this, bunch of foundation
[32:48.360 --> 32:53.720]  funded communists and they're gearing up for their big push, we've got fire bombings going
[32:53.720 --> 32:58.600]  on at U.S. embassies, we've got people getting shot and killed like five cops killed yesterday,
[32:58.600 --> 33:05.520]  we don't even learn their names ladies and gentlemen, but you sure know the guy that
[33:05.520 --> 33:09.600]  died in Minnesota, okay yeah I'm glad he's dead, why would I be?
[33:09.600 --> 33:16.080]  The point is that this is the manipulation of the media, we've got footage of a dog being
[33:16.080 --> 33:20.040]  choked to death that was stolen by someone because the person was white and the black
[33:20.040 --> 33:27.920]  crazy man strangling the puppy to death, I mean do you blame all black people for that
[33:27.920 --> 33:32.440]  or do you say that it's Joe Biden's fault, well Joe Biden's been pushing the riots,
[33:32.440 --> 33:37.320]  I mean you can say it more than it's Trump's fault, this is crazy, you've got Mattis who's
[33:37.320 --> 33:43.880]  I guess got his paperback book coming out so he wants to promote it, coming out saying
[33:43.880 --> 33:48.320]  Trump's a danger to the Constitution, we've been overtaken by globalists, we've had our
[33:48.320 --> 33:54.480]  sovereignty transferred out of the country, we've had the nation absolutely enslaved.
[33:54.480 --> 33:59.640]  Alright here comes the Attorney General with this big announcement, let's go to the Fox
[33:59.640 --> 34:00.640]  News feed.
[34:00.640 --> 34:05.760]  Including the protesting being co-opted by those who would turn it violent, but we now
[34:05.760 --> 34:11.480]  see the others pull into place and the Attorney General for the United States, Bill Barr.
[34:11.480 --> 34:19.640]  Everybody, thank you for joining us at this remote press conference.
[34:19.640 --> 34:28.440]  For the Constitution Avenue entrance to this building is a Latin inscription that translates,
[34:28.440 --> 34:33.800]  everything is created by law and order.
[34:33.800 --> 34:41.320]  That ancient principle still holds true, our free society depends on the rule of law, the
[34:41.320 --> 34:47.600]  assurance that ordinary citizens can go about their lives without being subject to arbitrary
[34:47.600 --> 34:56.760]  violence or fear, when the rule of law breaks down the promise of America does also.
[34:56.760 --> 35:03.120]  Our nation is now confronting two serious challenges to the rule of law.
[35:03.120 --> 35:10.800]  The first is a long standing one but was recently crystallized and driven home by the killing
[35:10.800 --> 35:14.640]  of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
[35:14.640 --> 35:21.800]  The video of the police conduct in this episode as I said before is harrowing.
[35:21.800 --> 35:28.280]  When you watch it and imagine that one of your loved ones was being treated this way
[35:28.280 --> 35:35.320]  and begging for their lives, it is impossible for any normal human being not to be struck
[35:35.320 --> 35:39.280]  to the heart with horror.
[35:39.280 --> 35:44.840]  This matter is being pursued by both the state and the federal government.
[35:44.840 --> 35:51.680]  The state has filed already second degree murder charges against one of the officers
[35:51.680 --> 35:57.040]  and aiding and abetting charges against the other three officers.
[35:57.040 --> 36:05.200]  As we typically do in cases such as this, the Department of Justice and the FBI is conducting
[36:05.200 --> 36:12.800]  a parallel and independent investigation into possible violations of federal civil rights
[36:12.800 --> 36:14.640]  laws.
[36:14.640 --> 36:18.640]  The President has directed me to spare no effort.
[36:18.640 --> 36:29.240]  We are coordinating our work with the Attorney General of Minnesota and as a matter of comedy,
[36:29.240 --> 36:37.640]  the Department of Justice typically lets the state go forward with its proceedings first.
[36:37.640 --> 36:43.520]  This afternoon, our United States Attorney in Minnesota and the FBI Special Agent in
[36:43.520 --> 36:50.080]  charge of our Minneapolis field office, the FBI's field office, will attend a memorial
[36:50.080 --> 36:54.120]  service for Mr. Floyd.
[36:54.120 --> 37:03.120]  Today is a day of mourning and the day is coming soon, I am confident, when justice
[37:03.120 --> 37:05.680]  will be served.
[37:05.680 --> 37:12.760]  George Floyd's death was not the first of its kind and it exposes concerns that reach
[37:12.760 --> 37:17.120]  far beyond this particular case.
[37:17.120 --> 37:22.440]  While the vast majority of police officers do their job bravely and righteously, it
[37:22.440 --> 37:29.640]  is undeniable that many African Americans lacked confidence in our American criminal
[37:29.640 --> 37:30.640]  justice.
[37:30.640 --> 37:31.640]  You know, this is really all about folks.
[37:31.640 --> 37:32.640]  This must change.
[37:32.640 --> 37:40.720]  In the final equation, it's going to be robots policing you, watch, and nothing less is acceptable.
[37:40.720 --> 37:45.120]  You already saw it with the COVID rollout, it's going to be ground robots, air robots,
[37:45.120 --> 37:46.120]  humans are going to be taken out of everything.
[37:46.120 --> 37:51.280]  It's going to be, oh, the robots, colorblind, watch.
[37:51.280 --> 37:56.480]  These chiefs and law enforcement officials and leaders around the country are committed
[37:56.480 --> 38:04.640]  to ensuring that racism plays no part in law enforcement and that everyone receives equal
[38:04.640 --> 38:07.520]  protection of the laws.
[38:07.520 --> 38:14.040]  In October 2019, the president established the first commission on law enforcement since
[38:14.040 --> 38:20.800]  the 1960s and I am meeting with them later this month and I have been talking.
[38:20.800 --> 38:21.800]  This is live.
[38:21.800 --> 38:22.800]  We're going to continue to watch this.
[38:22.800 --> 38:28.000]  He said two big issues, Floyd and the next will be anti-fug, the looting, the criminality,
[38:28.000 --> 38:29.000]  the riots.
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.560]  If he hasn't gotten to that yet when we come back, we'll just keep going, but we'll back
[38:32.560 --> 38:33.560]  it up here.
[38:33.560 --> 38:34.560]  We've got to go to break here.
[38:34.560 --> 38:38.680]  Radio, TV stations out there have to take their breaks, we understand that.
[38:38.680 --> 38:43.160]  Please don't forget that we've had the biggest sell of the year yet, extended now 60% off
[38:43.160 --> 38:44.160]  flash sale.
[38:44.160 --> 38:46.160]  A lot of stuff is very close to selling out.
[38:46.160 --> 38:50.240]  So if you want your DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and the CoQ10, if you want your X2, you want
[38:50.240 --> 38:56.280]  your X3, if you want your Real Red Pill Plus, a lot of that's very close to selling out.
[38:56.280 --> 39:00.840]  We also have a lot of other great products like bodies, ultimate turmeric formula that

[39:07.880 --> 39:10.680]  and the sale is what funds our operation.
[39:10.680 --> 39:16.960]  We have to sell a lot of product though to be able to fund ourselves when we sell it
[39:16.960 --> 39:18.600]  at this big a discount.
[39:18.600 --> 39:21.280]  No vitality, never do this, 60% off.

[39:48.160 --> 39:54.120]  great products, try them out, and fund the InfoWare.
[39:54.120 --> 39:59.200]  I had told listeners back in December that I would never go to 50% off again because
[39:59.200 --> 40:03.480]  our markup isn't big enough selling the products, to be able to fund ourselves doing that.
[40:03.480 --> 40:08.600]  But I got to tell you, things are so crazy, the world is so insane, my gut level instinct
[40:08.600 --> 40:14.040]  is to sell out everything we've got in the warehouse to make sure we can stay on air
[40:14.040 --> 40:18.360]  through the election in 150 days, because we only got money to operate a few months
[40:18.360 --> 40:19.360]  right now.
[40:19.360 --> 40:23.720]  So these are great products you and your family need, it funds the InfoWare, get them all

[40:49.280 --> 41:00.440]  off is the average sale, take advantage now and fund the InfoWare.
[41:00.440 --> 41:06.200]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax,
[41:06.200 --> 41:12.440]  now it's the race riot hoax of 2020.
[41:12.440 --> 41:16.720]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next, well I can tell you, it's going to be a bunch
[41:16.720 --> 41:22.560]  of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war, it's going to be economic
[41:22.560 --> 41:28.760]  collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it, the globalists are attacking
[41:28.760 --> 41:33.400]  on every front, that's why now, more than ever we have to realize, they tried to censor
[41:33.400 --> 41:38.360]  InfoWare's off the air, because they knew, when they launched this whole situation, they
[41:38.360 --> 41:43.320]  didn't want the people's voice to still be on air, but thanks to you and our crew, we
[41:43.320 --> 41:49.440]  are still on air, so let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now, more than ever,
[41:49.440 --> 42:05.080]  InfoWare.com lives.
[42:05.080 --> 42:12.840]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[42:12.840 --> 42:19.880]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance, to create superior vitality
[42:19.880 --> 42:20.880]  in males.
[42:20.880 --> 42:26.840]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses, and it contains
[42:26.840 --> 42:35.720]  no synthetic chemicals, and no unwanted additives, yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined
[42:35.720 --> 42:41.560]  with modern technology, working together in perfect synchronicity, to help you get the
[42:41.560 --> 42:47.680]  most out of this herb packed formula, so what are you waiting for, go to the InfoWare store,
[42:47.680 --> 42:56.840]  never been a better time than right now, super male vitality at InfoWareStore.com.
[42:56.840 --> 43:01.720]  We're living in insanely dangerous times, and I told folks going back three months ago,
[43:01.720 --> 43:05.360]  I'm not buying storeable food, because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus, I'm worried
[43:05.360 --> 43:09.600]  about the food shortages, and the economic collapse, and now it's admitted that a chain
[43:09.600 --> 43:13.720]  reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages, and the collapse of farms and
[43:13.720 --> 43:16.960]  ranches across the United States, and it's even worse in the third world.
[43:16.960 --> 43:20.720]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it, but with the election
[43:20.720 --> 43:25.160]  fraud, and the COVID-19, all the wars, and the third world collapsing, and everything
[43:25.160 --> 43:30.600]  else is going on, now is the time to get storeable foods, because they'll last for 25 years,
[43:30.600 --> 43:34.800]  they're in easily totable bags, it's high quality food, and it's good to have that box
[43:34.800 --> 43:38.160]  checked off to be ready, and it funds the InfoWare, so we have storeable food available
[43:38.160 --> 43:43.720]  again, InfoWareStore.com, or call toll-free, triple-A, 253-3139, but whatever you do, get
[43:43.720 --> 43:47.880]  prepared and get ready, because the globalists want you dependent on them, they do not want
[43:47.880 --> 43:52.320]  you to be self-sufficient, get your storeable food at InfoWareStore.com right now while you
[43:52.320 --> 44:21.160]  still can.
[44:21.160 --> 44:29.560]  Los Angeles National Guard kneeling to the useful idiots, the Antifa morons, the people
[44:29.560 --> 44:34.280]  wearing their stupid COVID mask, notice the military is not wearing their little diaper
[44:34.280 --> 44:39.200]  mask anymore, it's all a giant hoax, by the way, more scientists, more governments have
[44:39.200 --> 44:47.120]  come out saying COVID-19 is a giant hoax, but it is a new virus patented and owned by
[44:47.120 --> 44:54.920]  a consortium of Fauci and Bill Gates, and the Chinese government cannot make that up,
[44:54.920 --> 44:59.960]  and see the crime is so big, they just think they won't get prosecuted, just like Antifa
[44:59.960 --> 45:06.920]  is publicly funded by Alexander Soros and George Soros.
[45:06.920 --> 45:10.520]  Let's go to the Attorney General, as predicted, he said two things, you know, the death of
[45:10.520 --> 45:13.960]  Floyd and now the lawlessness, the rioting, we'll see what he's about to announce, here
[45:13.960 --> 45:14.960]  it is.
[45:14.960 --> 45:21.200]  It's a massive solution so that Mr. Floyd's death will not have been in vain.
[45:21.200 --> 45:27.120]  We will work hard to bring good out of bad.
[45:27.120 --> 45:33.200]  Unfortunately the aftermath of George Floyd's death has produced a second challenge to the
[45:33.200 --> 45:35.120]  rule of law.
[45:35.120 --> 45:42.120]  While many have peacefully expressed their anger and grief, others have hijacked protests
[45:42.120 --> 45:45.200]  to engage in lawlessness.
[45:45.200 --> 45:53.120]  Violent rioting, arson, looting of businesses and public property, assaults on law enforcement
[45:53.120 --> 46:00.000]  officers and innocent people, and even the murder of a federal agent.
[46:00.000 --> 46:07.720]  Such senseless acts of anarchy are not exercises of First Amendment rights, they are crimes
[46:07.720 --> 46:14.020]  designed to terrify fellow citizens and intimidate communities.
[46:14.020 --> 46:22.000]  As I told the governors on Monday, we understand the distinction between three different sets
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.120]  of actors here.
[46:24.120 --> 46:31.880]  The large preponderance of those who are protesting are peaceful demonstrators who are exercising
[46:31.880 --> 46:33.480]  their First Amendment rights.
[46:33.480 --> 46:37.840]  They have that to be idiots.
[46:37.840 --> 46:43.880]  There are groups that exploit the opportunity to engage in such crimes as looting.
[46:43.880 --> 46:49.800]  And finally, at some demonstrations, there are extremist agitators who are hijacking
[46:49.800 --> 46:55.560]  the protests to pursue their own separate and violent agenda.
[46:55.560 --> 47:00.880]  We have evidence that Antifa and other similar extremist groups, as well as actors of a
[47:00.880 --> 47:08.800]  variety of different political persuasions, have been involved in instigating and participating
[47:08.800 --> 47:11.480]  in the violent activity.
[47:11.480 --> 47:19.400]  And we are also seeing foreign actors playing all sides to exacerbate the violence.
[47:19.400 --> 47:25.920]  The Department of Justice is working to restore order in the District of Columbia and around
[47:25.920 --> 47:27.680]  the nation.
[47:27.680 --> 47:33.640]  Here in Washington, we are working with the local police, the citizen soldiers of the
[47:33.640 --> 47:40.120]  National Guard, and other federal agencies to provide safety and justice.
[47:40.120 --> 47:47.560]  We have deployed all the major law enforcement components of the Department on this mission,
[47:47.560 --> 47:56.240]  including the FBI, the ATF, the DEA, the Bureau of Prisons, and the U.S. Martial Service.
[47:56.240 --> 47:59.680]  Their leaders are with me today, and we'll be talking shortly.
[47:59.680 --> 48:05.960]  I thank all of these leaders and their components for working bravely and professionally to
[48:05.960 --> 48:08.000]  protect the District.
[48:08.000 --> 48:15.960]  I'm pleased to say that, especially over the last two nights, the demonstrations, while
[48:15.960 --> 48:20.440]  large, have been peaceful.
[48:20.440 --> 48:26.040]  The Justice Department is also working closely with our state and local partners to address
[48:26.040 --> 48:29.240]  violent riots around the country.
[48:29.240 --> 48:36.000]  Our federal law enforcement efforts are focused on the violent instigators.
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.760]  Through the FBI, U.S. attorney's offices, component field offices, and state and local
[48:41.760 --> 48:49.120]  enforcement, we are receiving real-time intelligence, and we have deployed resources to quell outbreaks
[48:49.120 --> 48:51.960]  of violence in several places.
[48:51.960 --> 48:57.600]  I urge governors and mayors and other state and local leaders to work closely with the
[48:57.600 --> 49:00.800]  National Guard and with us.
[49:00.800 --> 49:07.920]  The federal government has thus far made 51 arrests for federal crimes in connection with
[49:07.920 --> 49:09.800]  violent rioting.
[49:09.800 --> 49:18.080]  We will continue to investigate, to make arrests, and to prosecute where warranted.
[49:18.080 --> 49:27.920]  When I was Attorney General in 1995, riots broke out in Los Angeles following the acquittal
[49:27.920 --> 49:34.200]  by the state of police officers accused of beating Rodney King.
[49:34.200 --> 49:40.920]  Ultimately, the Department of Justice at my direction filed federal civil rights charges
[49:40.920 --> 49:44.000]  against those officers.
[49:44.000 --> 49:52.000]  As President Bush assured the nation at that time, quote, the violence will end, justice
[49:52.000 --> 49:55.800]  will be served, hope will return.
[49:55.800 --> 49:58.120]  The same is true today.
[49:58.120 --> 50:00.600]  The rule of law will prevail.
[50:00.600 --> 50:01.600]  Thank you.
[50:01.600 --> 50:08.120]  Now, I'd like to introduce my colleague, Chris Ray, the director of the FBI, and I have
[50:08.120 --> 50:14.800]  to say this is the FBI that I've had the pleasure of working with over the last few days, the
[50:14.800 --> 50:22.200]  FBI that I know and love, that have really stood up here and performed magnificently.
[50:22.200 --> 50:28.000]  Not only here in D.C., but around the country and in all their field offices.
[50:28.000 --> 50:35.040]  And their enforcement functions, their intelligence functions are now in full gear.
[50:35.040 --> 50:42.160]  And I'm confident that with the FBI's leadership, we are going to deal effectively with the criminals
[50:42.160 --> 50:45.440]  who are involved in extremist violence.
[50:45.440 --> 50:50.000]  Okay, well, start with George Soros now as Andrew Soros.
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.200]  Obama.
[50:53.200 --> 50:55.880]  Thank you, General, for your leadership.
[50:55.880 --> 50:57.400]  Good morning.
[50:57.400 --> 51:01.080]  This is needless to say an incredibly challenging time for our country.
[51:01.080 --> 51:03.560]  All right, he's going to go to some politically correct comments.
[51:03.560 --> 51:06.160]  I can't handle it, just turn it off.
[51:06.160 --> 51:12.280]  The whole thing was Hollywood produced movies, the Joker, all of them, Rob Reiner saying overthrow
[51:12.280 --> 51:16.960]  the government, race war, and I'll be talking to people high level defense intelligence,
[51:16.960 --> 51:19.240]  CIA, and they're like, how do you know this, Jones?
[51:19.240 --> 51:20.240]  How do I know it?
[51:20.240 --> 51:29.000]  They run around announcing it like a bugle charge, a cavalry charge, but everyone is in
[51:29.000 --> 51:34.320]  their own little bubbles, I guess, watching CNN and Fox News.
[51:34.320 --> 51:37.320]  That's why when they ran full page ads saying overthrow the government and kill all the
[51:37.320 --> 51:42.480]  white people in the New York Times, they had then ran article saying Jones made it up.
[51:42.480 --> 51:44.000]  There's no full page ads.
[51:44.000 --> 51:49.320]  What the hell are you talking about?
[51:49.320 --> 51:52.080]  Jones made it up.
[51:52.080 --> 51:53.760]  Antifa's not violent.
[51:53.760 --> 52:00.480]  So Jones burned down the homeless camp and they have had hundreds of TV stations and
[52:00.480 --> 52:05.880]  dozens of major newspapers, including international ones, run with the fact that we burned down
[52:05.880 --> 52:10.200]  a homeless camp last week.
[52:10.200 --> 52:14.200]  Even though we're there covering it and you see the Antifa burning it, this is the level.
[52:14.200 --> 52:16.760]  Our media is allied with this.
[52:16.760 --> 52:20.200]  This is what they want.
[52:20.200 --> 52:24.560]  And if people continue to be naive about all this, we don't have a prayer in hell.
[52:24.560 --> 52:30.880]  We told you who was spying on Trump, who the moles were, who the infiltrators were, the
[52:30.880 --> 52:39.280]  fake FISA court, we broke the Nunez memo, we broke everything because we research.
[52:39.280 --> 52:44.920]  We know what we're talking about.
[52:44.920 --> 52:47.800]  People thinking government because they've got security clearances, they're finding
[52:47.800 --> 52:48.800]  stuff out.
[52:48.800 --> 52:51.840]  People who flew into a country or maybe you can dial into somebody's computer.
[52:51.840 --> 52:58.560]  How about you actually study what the criminals are up to and listen to them?
[52:58.560 --> 53:01.320]  Bill Gates says they're going to set up a world government, reduce the population of
[53:01.320 --> 53:03.520]  500 million in public statements.
[53:03.520 --> 53:05.480]  Do you care about that?
[53:05.480 --> 53:11.400]  Bill Gates publicly funded at least 14 operations at the Wuhan laboratory, including five to
[53:11.400 --> 53:17.160]  create a vaccine for a weaponized coronavirus with Fauci.
[53:17.160 --> 53:22.000]  Of course the head of MI6 just came out and said it's obviously man-made out of the Wuhan
[53:22.000 --> 53:27.800]  lab released on purpose to destabilize the planet because that's what it is.
[53:27.800 --> 53:32.560]  And the sooner people start waking up, the better.
[53:32.560 --> 53:39.480]  Oh yeah, Bill Gates' vaccines are basically killing the people they're testing them on.
[53:39.480 --> 53:46.120]  We told you all this that's now breaking in January because we know who to watch.
[53:46.120 --> 53:50.280]  I didn't just start picking on Bill Gates 20-something years ago because I felt like
[53:50.280 --> 53:51.920]  it.
[53:51.920 --> 53:54.360]  I thought he was the Microsoft guy 25 years ago.
[53:54.360 --> 53:56.440]  I knew he had an antitrust investigation.
[53:56.440 --> 53:59.720]  I knew he was a little smart ass.
[53:59.720 --> 54:03.320]  Everybody knew the guy was bad news and then I started researching the New World Order
[54:03.320 --> 54:10.760]  and every time I kicked open some door, there he was at the center of the spider web.
[54:10.760 --> 54:15.320]  And so everybody can keep being naive at the FBI and the CIA and the public can keep being
[54:15.320 --> 54:18.920]  naive at your own peril.
[54:18.920 --> 54:21.680]  Because everybody thinks, oh, we'll beat these leftist rioters, blah, blah.
[54:21.680 --> 54:23.520]  There's powerful evil behind them.
[54:23.520 --> 54:26.360]  The Chai comms, the globalists, they're making their move.
[54:26.360 --> 54:28.960]  They're just probing right now.
[54:28.960 --> 54:32.480]  They've got thousands of public officials they're planning to kill.
[54:32.480 --> 54:36.360]  And I guess you're all just going to sit there and let them do it.
[54:36.360 --> 54:40.160]  But I'll tell you this, the party's over for all you candy asses.
[54:40.160 --> 54:41.760]  The party's over.
[54:41.760 --> 54:45.280]  Hour two straight ahead.
[54:45.280 --> 54:47.560]  This is the end, my friends.
[54:47.560 --> 54:49.680]  My only friends, the end.
[54:49.680 --> 54:52.240]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[54:52.240 --> 54:55.400]  Of everything that stands, the end.
[54:55.400 --> 54:58.000]  The safety, the delusion.
[54:58.000 --> 55:03.320]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because there was only the mirage of safety.
[55:03.320 --> 55:08.440]  Movies and partying and living like children, never growing up, never caring about other
[55:08.440 --> 55:09.880]  people.
[55:09.880 --> 55:13.520]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[55:13.520 --> 55:16.520]  It was like the history book show, it's just like the Bible states.
[55:16.520 --> 55:20.760]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought
[55:20.760 --> 55:26.520]  into captivity because their people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated
[55:26.520 --> 55:29.520]  by spies, and then they were enslaved.
[55:29.520 --> 55:35.200]  We are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this system leads to
[55:35.200 --> 55:37.680]  absolute bondage.
[55:37.680 --> 55:41.760]  Info wars has decided to fight for freedom, and info wars has had great victory thanks
[55:41.760 --> 55:45.360]  to your support and your prayers.
[55:45.360 --> 55:53.120]  Sixty percent off, sixty percent off, sixty percent off, sixty percent off.
[55:53.120 --> 55:59.840]  We have not done sixty percent off across the board in the history of info wars.
[55:59.840 --> 56:04.240]  But because things are so crazy, I'm offering the biggest sale in our history.
[56:04.240 --> 56:05.240]  It's a flash sale.
[56:05.240 --> 56:09.280]  I don't know if it's going to last a day, a week, but we're selling out of all the major
[56:09.280 --> 56:13.640]  products because I kind of feel like the Titanic is sinking and we need to have the
[56:13.640 --> 56:17.920]  funds in our bank account to fund the info war into the future.
[56:17.920 --> 56:21.840]  So take advantage of the looting, the rioting, the death and the martial law by getting the
[56:21.840 --> 56:26.000]  best prices ever at infowarstore.com.
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.520]  That's sixty percent off on t-shirts, that's on books, that's on films, that's on all
[56:30.520 --> 56:35.600]  the great supplements like turbo force, living defense, DNA force plus and so much more.
[56:35.600 --> 56:41.520]  The mega flash sale, sixty percent off to fund the info war and save the republic or
[56:41.520 --> 56:48.200]  get prepared before everything burns down, infowarstore.com.
[56:48.200 --> 56:53.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:53.040 --> 56:59.160]  Those of you truly protesting for reforms due to as sometimes brutal and racial profiling
[56:59.160 --> 57:05.080]  law enforcement enormity, do you realize that your message has been hijacked by systemic
[57:05.080 --> 57:11.480]  Marxism and a Black Lives Matter movement that is just a weaponized open society elitist
[57:11.480 --> 57:14.880]  democratic class warfare subterfuge?
[57:14.880 --> 57:19.680]  These are puppets that have been put in front of the Negro community by white liberals.
[57:19.680 --> 57:23.640]  These are parrots that have been put in front of the Negro community by white liberals.
[57:23.640 --> 57:25.080]  You can't name me.
[57:25.080 --> 57:34.080]  A Negro leader who has been betrayed Negroes, who has not been endorsed, sanctioned, subsupported,
[57:34.080 --> 57:38.560]  subsidized and supported by the white liberals.
[57:38.560 --> 57:43.880]  Those of you protesting, do you realize that you are in the streets working to restore
[57:43.880 --> 57:49.680]  trust between the police and your communities while the rest of America has lost its trust
[57:49.680 --> 57:50.680]  in you?
[57:50.680 --> 57:56.920]  In fact, a new morning consult poll finds that 58 percent of Americans want the military
[57:56.920 --> 58:00.600]  brought in with 30 percent opposing the measure.
[58:00.600 --> 58:06.600]  Would George Floyd agree that his life is more important than that of 77-year-old retired
[58:06.600 --> 58:13.080]  St. Louis police chief David Dorn, whose tragic murder was streamed out on Facebook live after
[58:13.080 --> 58:25.840]  he had gone out to check on a friend's pawn shop and was killed by looters?
[58:25.840 --> 58:31.160]  Would George Floyd agree that his life is more important than that of 53-year-old federal
[58:31.160 --> 58:36.960]  law enforcement officer Patrick Underwood or 53-year-old Louisville barbeque man James
[58:36.960 --> 58:43.120]  McAtee or 22-year-old Iowan Italian Marie Kelly or the others people who have died as
[58:43.120 --> 58:47.040]  a result of the swirling inertia of the chaotic protests?
[58:47.040 --> 58:52.320]  How many people need to die in the protest wake before you get your point across?
[58:52.320 --> 58:55.040]  And haven't you already gotten your point across?
[58:55.040 --> 59:00.320]  Would George Floyd agree that the price of his death adds up to the shooting of two Las
[59:00.320 --> 59:06.280]  Vegas cops, the shooting of four cops in St. Louis, the running over of police in Buffalo
[59:06.280 --> 59:11.760]  and Philadelphia, or the brutal beatings of innocent people desperately trying to protect
[59:11.760 --> 59:18.000]  their businesses, the destruction of which destroys the lives of innocent people connected
[59:18.000 --> 59:43.320]  to those businesses either by employment, community, or family?
[59:43.320 --> 59:49.520]  Would George Floyd approve of the Jonestown-esque white guilt displays as hordes of leftists
[59:49.520 --> 59:55.400]  succumb to a form of Stockholm syndrome from the Black Lives Matter inquisitors who use
[59:55.400 --> 59:59.440]  their programmed white members as sacrificial lambs?
[59:59.440 --> 1:00:04.720]  And those of you protesting, do you realize that your movement is actually a depraved
[1:00:04.720 --> 1:00:11.480]  me-me generation cry for help who are superimposing your spurious claims of racism over your raging
[1:00:11.480 --> 1:00:13.400]  mommy and daddy issues?
[1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:18.480]  The leftist media won't tell you that 2020 has actually been a banner year.
[1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:23.560]  When it comes to death by cop, according to race statistics, the numbers are way down
[1:00:23.560 --> 1:00:24.880]  for everyone.
[1:00:24.880 --> 1:00:29.800]  But in previous years, half the amount of black people were killed compared to white
[1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:30.800]  people.
[1:00:30.800 --> 1:00:37.400]  As Newsmax reported in 2019, out of the 30 to 50 million interactions that police had
[1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:46.000]  with the American public last year, 10 million people were arrested and less than.01% were
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:48.120]  shot and killed by the police.
[1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:54.360]  Out of those 10 million people arrested, 47 of those shot and killed were unarmed, which
[1:00:54.360 --> 1:01:04.320]  equates to.00047%, 17 of which were black, the circumstances of which are open to discussion.
[1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:10.560]  But since whites consist of 62% of the population and blacks make up 13% of the population,
[1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:16.040]  as the Wall Street Journal wrote in 2009, statistics from the Bureau of Justice reveal
[1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:23.120]  that blacks were charged with 62% of robberies, 57% of murders and 45% of assaults in the
[1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:28.920]  75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising around 15% of the population
[1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:30.080]  in these counties.
[1:01:30.080 --> 1:01:35.080]  Such a concentration of criminal violence in minority communities means that officers
[1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:40.960]  will be disproportionately confronting armed and often resisting suspects in those communities,
[1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:46.400]  raising officers' own risk of using lethal force, according to The Daily Wire.
[1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:50.920]  Those of you protesting, shouldn't we be working harder to address the root of those
[1:01:50.920 --> 1:02:17.600]  statistics?
[1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:43.940]  I also appreciate every partner for their support, for getting all our employees to
[1:02:43.940 --> 1:02:46.940]  enforce its funding, and you need high quality products to take action.
[1:02:47.940 --> 1:02:51.940]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:02:59.940 --> 1:03:06.940]  It has been said by many a historian and military planner that the United States could not be invaded by an outside power.
[1:03:06.940 --> 1:03:11.940]  Is that what Miyamoto said the day after he attacked Pearl Harbor?
[1:03:12.940 --> 1:03:17.940]  I fear we've awakened a sleeping giant and we are forced to invade the mainland.
[1:03:18.940 --> 1:03:21.940]  There will be a rifle behind every blade of grass.
[1:03:22.940 --> 1:03:27.940]  But if you can rot the insides of a country, if you can turn the people against each other,
[1:03:28.940 --> 1:03:33.940]  if you can drive God and morality out of the schools, if you can dumb the people down,
[1:03:33.940 --> 1:03:36.940]  you can break up the families, you can do that.
[1:03:37.940 --> 1:03:41.940]  And if you look at sociology, anthropology and psychology, and I've done quite a study of it,
[1:03:42.940 --> 1:03:47.940]  anyone can pull these numbers up yourself, the black community in the United States under segregation,
[1:03:48.940 --> 1:03:55.940]  which was another evil, per capita had lower illegitimacy than the white community,
[1:03:56.940 --> 1:03:59.940]  and in many areas the same crime rate are lower.
[1:03:59.940 --> 1:04:04.940]  And you go look at the old photos of people in the 20s, 30s, 40s, I mean the black neighborhoods,
[1:04:05.940 --> 1:04:09.940]  everybody's wearing suits and ties and they had their own hotels, their own businesses, their own restaurants,
[1:04:10.940 --> 1:04:12.940]  and that actually made them stronger because they were being suppressed.
[1:04:13.940 --> 1:04:20.940]  But as soon as desegregation came in, supposedly to replace an evil, it destroyed all those communities.
[1:04:21.940 --> 1:04:26.940]  And then they came in in the 60s and said, we'll pay women not to have a man in the house and to have children.
[1:04:26.940 --> 1:04:31.940]  Well, no matter where you are in the world, you take the father out of the home or the mother,
[1:04:32.940 --> 1:04:37.940]  statistically everything collapses and you have three to four times more likely to be in prison.
[1:04:38.940 --> 1:04:43.940]  Then you get generations, three of them now, trained in prison, and you've got MTV,
[1:04:44.940 --> 1:04:49.940]  and I've talked to high level MTV executives that were retired, and major rock stars who were told in the 80s.
[1:04:49.940 --> 1:04:57.940]  You put out gangster rap and kill the cop rap as heavy metal people and as rock stars or we're not going to play on MTV.
[1:04:58.940 --> 1:05:05.940]  Back then MTV was king and that's why suddenly you saw everybody doing a song with hip hop folks who were calling for kill the cops,
[1:05:06.940 --> 1:05:13.940]  down with the cops, inward with attitude, all that stuff was being force fed to get rid of the rap and hip hop.
[1:05:13.940 --> 1:05:20.940]  It was about empowering the community and coming together to put in death rap to teach the young people to dress like thugs,
[1:05:21.940 --> 1:05:24.940]  act like thugs, attack the police and induct them right into the prisons.
[1:05:25.940 --> 1:05:35.940]  And it was the Clintons and it was then, of course, good old Joe Biden that got the laws in that gave black people,
[1:05:36.940 --> 1:05:40.940]  if they were caught with cocaine, three to five times the sentences of white people.
[1:05:40.940 --> 1:05:45.940]  And it was the CIA that brought the drugs in to do it all and boy did it work.
[1:05:46.940 --> 1:05:53.940]  Black community wrecked almost 80% of legitimacy, total crime, death, and now it's happening to all communities.
[1:05:54.940 --> 1:06:00.940]  What you see down to the black community will be done to you and it's the very same liberal leftist led by LBJ who said,
[1:06:01.940 --> 1:06:07.940]  we're going to get this great society passed and I'll have those inwards voting Democrats for a hundred years.
[1:06:07.940 --> 1:06:18.940]  And of course, LBJ was in the KKK and so was Senator Byrd and all of them mentors to the Clintons.
[1:06:19.940 --> 1:06:20.940]  These folks know what they're doing.
[1:06:21.940 --> 1:06:22.940]  I mean, they're not been in charge for no reason.
[1:06:23.940 --> 1:06:26.940]  And let me tell you something, the KKK didn't like poor white people to anybody.
[1:06:27.940 --> 1:06:29.940]  It plays everybody off against each other and they know what they're doing.
[1:06:29.940 --> 1:06:33.940]  There it is.
[1:06:34.940 --> 1:06:41.940]  Sorry, I said 200 years, you're right, that's the actual, that's in the archives down at the LBJ Center in Austin.
[1:06:42.940 --> 1:06:43.940]  That letter is in the archives.
[1:06:44.940 --> 1:06:47.940]  And let me tell you, it works like a charm, doesn't it?
[1:06:48.940 --> 1:06:50.940]  Works like a charm.
[1:06:50.940 --> 1:07:04.940]  Long coms Trump doubles the amount of funding to black colleges, orders, all these factories built in black neighborhoods says incentivize to hire black people and they're trying to destroy him because they've got a game plan.
[1:07:05.940 --> 1:07:10.940]  Now, at the end of this report, that's at Bandot video, click the left hand tab, you'll see the John bound section.
[1:07:10.940 --> 1:07:22.940]  Got a very important report he put out titled protest the protests and at the end of it, he shows these crime statistics of 10 to one black on white crime.
[1:07:23.940 --> 1:07:33.940]  And the reality that any black people now that try to get black folks out of this, well, like the police captain gets shot dead because you're working for the man.
[1:07:33.940 --> 1:07:42.940]  You really think the average white person wants to keep black people poor and impoverished and falling apart. That's not good for anybody except the Democrats.
[1:07:43.940 --> 1:07:45.940]  That's why they build Planned Parenthoods in your neighborhood.
[1:07:46.940 --> 1:07:49.940]  That's why they're always shooting their mouths off, admitting all this.
[1:07:50.940 --> 1:08:01.940]  These people are evil like Governor Northam is going to take down a statue of Robert E. Lee who Eisenhower said he respected more than anybody who the British military respects to this day they think is a top general.
[1:08:01.940 --> 1:08:06.940]  The guy was in the Army of the North. He resigned because of war crimes by the North.
[1:08:07.940 --> 1:08:10.940]  He went and fought an army five times his size, not about slavery.
[1:08:11.940 --> 1:08:16.940]  They're pulling his statue down in Virginia, the governor's announced in a couple months to cause a riot.
[1:08:18.940 --> 1:08:21.940]  It's disgusting. And now they want George Washington statue.
[1:08:22.940 --> 1:08:28.940]  They want them all, folks. It's all about getting rid of America and making you hate your country.
[1:08:28.940 --> 1:08:31.940]  Here's the end of John Bounds report. It deserves to be seen. Here it is.
[1:08:58.940 --> 1:09:00.940]  The numbers are way down for everyone.
[1:09:01.940 --> 1:09:06.940]  But in previous years, half the amount of black people were killed compared to white people.
[1:09:07.940 --> 1:09:23.940]  As Newsmax reported in 2019, out of the 30 to 50 million interactions that police had with the American public last year, 2018, 10 million people were arrested and less than 0.01% were shot and killed by the police.
[1:09:23.940 --> 1:09:36.940]  Out of those 10 million people arrested, 47 of those shot and killed were unarmed, which equates to 0.00047%, 17 of which were black.
[1:09:37.940 --> 1:09:39.940]  The circumstances of which are open to discussion.
[1:09:40.940 --> 1:09:48.940]  But since whites consist of 62% of the population and blacks make up 13% of the population, as the Wall Street Journal wrote in 2009,
[1:09:48.940 --> 1:10:00.940]  statistics from the Bureau of Justice reveal that blacks were charged with 62% of robberies, 57% of murders and 45% of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country,
[1:10:01.940 --> 1:10:05.940]  despite only comprising around 15% of the population in these counties.
[1:10:06.940 --> 1:10:16.940]  Such a concentration of criminal violence in minority communities means that officers will be disproportionately confronting armed and often resisting suspects in those communities.
[1:10:16.940 --> 1:10:21.940]  Raising officers' own risk of using lethal force, according to the Daily Wire.
[1:10:22.940 --> 1:10:34.940]  Those of you protesting, shouldn't we be working harder to address the root of those statistics as three and a half years of President Trump's policies have done compared to the decades of nothing from his predecessors?
[1:10:34.940 --> 1:10:47.940]  This is history. Right now you're witnessing history on the floor of the U.S. Senate, where it is a Christmas miracle underway, where for the first time in a generation, Republicans and Democrats are arm in arm tonight saying,
[1:10:48.940 --> 1:10:52.940]  we are sending too many people to prison, they're coming out better and not better, we want to make a tremendous difference.
[1:10:53.940 --> 1:11:01.940]  I want to say, Hakeem Jeffries on the left, Jared Kushner and Donald Trump on the right have brought together a coalition like I've never seen.
[1:11:01.940 --> 1:11:10.940]  In December, President Trump signed the First Step Act. It eased mandatory minimum drug sentences and led to Charles's release from prison again.
[1:11:11.940 --> 1:11:12.940]  How do you feel about President Trump?
[1:11:13.940 --> 1:11:21.940]  I'm very honored and grateful that he was signed the First Step Act, so I have nothing but respect and thankfulness.
[1:11:21.940 --> 1:11:34.940]  Well, we know that during the campaign, he said, look, I'm going to put $100 billion into the inner cities over the next eight years. Not only that, school choice is going to be on the table, not just for African Americans.
[1:11:35.940 --> 1:11:40.940]  But of course, Trump has already delivered on almost all of that, and so now he is the devil and must be removed, the Democrats are telling you.
[1:11:41.940 --> 1:11:47.940]  Oh, and what else don't they tell you in those statistics where you've got 60 plus percent of the crime being being black?
[1:11:47.940 --> 1:11:57.940]  If you look at the numbers, over 80 percent of it is between about the ages of 10 and 18, and most of that is 13 to 16.
[1:11:58.940 --> 1:12:08.940]  Look it up. It is brainwashed gangbanger kids that have been put in juvenile hall controlled by older gang members that use them as soldiers on the streets to enforce criminal activity.
[1:12:09.940 --> 1:12:15.940]  And now you see the MS-13 coming in with Hispanic folks and the low-level soldiers are, again, in their teens.
[1:12:15.940 --> 1:12:20.940]  This is criminal operations. They feed on the black community. They feed on all communities.
[1:12:21.940 --> 1:12:24.940]  And it's wrong, but you won't hear a damn thing out of Van Jones or anybody about that.
[1:12:25.940 --> 1:12:29.940]  And now Van Jones says America is irrevocably broke and that all whites have a virus.
[1:12:30.940 --> 1:12:34.940]  So he had to admit that Trump was trying to really be this great guy back then, but he knows you don't have a memory.
[1:12:35.940 --> 1:12:42.940]  And now he says Trump's the leader of the KKK when Van Jones literally knows he's there to control black people, keep them suppressed and dominated.
[1:12:42.940 --> 1:12:48.940]  He's pained to do it. That's his job. That's why he's still alive. Malcolm X is dead. We'll be right back.
[1:13:12.940 --> 1:13:17.940]  Don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore. You're going to be the service economy.
[1:13:18.940 --> 1:13:22.940]  And now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy and you're obsolete.
[1:13:23.940 --> 1:13:28.940]  So you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[1:13:29.940 --> 1:13:33.940]  The handcuffs are going on right now. We have to resist and say no to the New World Order.
[1:13:34.940 --> 1:13:36.940]  And that takes you understanding you were right.
[1:13:36.940 --> 1:13:42.940]  And understanding I was right and getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can.
[1:13:43.940 --> 1:13:48.940]  Now is the time for action. Now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[1:13:51.940 --> 1:13:58.940]  I've been fighting the globalists for 26 years and the evil side of me is just so tired of waiting and I'm so ready for physical war
[1:13:58.940 --> 1:14:05.940]  that I'm kind of happy about how bad things have gotten because all the delusional folks that don't stand up for the unborn babies
[1:14:06.940 --> 1:14:09.940]  that go along with the New World Order you're about to find out just how sick stuff is.
[1:14:10.940 --> 1:14:13.940]  But you know what the average person is still asleep. They don't deserve what's happening to them.
[1:14:14.940 --> 1:14:18.940]  So I'm actually sick about what's unfolding right now and I just want to turn things around.
[1:14:19.940 --> 1:14:22.940]  But you know what I can't do that without you. I can't get out of this mess.
[1:14:23.940 --> 1:14:26.940]  I can't get out of this stranglehold I'm in unless you decide to get out of as well.
[1:14:26.940 --> 1:14:27.940]  We're all in this together.
[1:14:28.940 --> 1:14:33.940]  And so if you just realize how important you are when you just tell people about the local radio stations listening to local TV stations
[1:14:34.940 --> 1:14:36.940]  when you just spread the word about infowords.com.
[1:14:37.940 --> 1:14:39.940]  When you just buy the products infowords.com it changes the world.
[1:14:40.940 --> 1:14:48.940]  Right now we've got a special that's about to end 60% off across the board flash sale that funds the info war and gets you great products
[1:14:49.940 --> 1:14:50.940]  at the same time infowords.com.
[1:14:50.940 --> 1:14:56.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:05.940 --> 1:15:15.940]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[1:15:15.940 --> 1:15:28.940]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:15:29.940 --> 1:15:31.940]  The United States is under attack.
[1:15:32.940 --> 1:15:36.940]  Our country is not perfect but it's our nation and has the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[1:15:37.940 --> 1:15:42.940]  It's been very successful and it's been the number one country where the average person has a chance to become successful
[1:15:42.940 --> 1:15:45.940]  and to become happy and to live out their dreams.
[1:15:46.940 --> 1:15:56.940]  Powerful multinational corporations that exploit human populations all over the world to levels beyond any horror movie or HP Lovecraft novel
[1:15:57.940 --> 1:16:04.940]  are the very ones now setting up this tyranny in America and knowing that we care about race relations and knowing that we care
[1:16:04.940 --> 1:16:14.940]  and we have a basic Christian ethos still they play on that and say you're racist you're bad and when out of 350 million people
[1:16:15.940 --> 1:16:24.940]  something sad happens to somebody at the hands of police officers like George Floyd even if they're all charged
[1:16:25.940 --> 1:16:29.940]  and even if they all go to prison it doesn't matter it's your fault because you're white.
[1:16:29.940 --> 1:16:35.940]  But it's white billionaires controlling things saying that they want to divert from their crimes their corruption
[1:16:36.940 --> 1:16:46.940]  their illegal surveillance of the population on to telling us that we're all individually bad
[1:16:47.940 --> 1:16:54.940]  and now after three months of a lockdown and top scientists coming out and saying COVID-19 is a giant hoax designed to destroy the economy.
[1:16:54.940 --> 1:17:02.940]  Now they move on to destroy the economy with looting and rioting and race war it is absolutely evil
[1:17:03.940 --> 1:17:10.940]  and now Senator Cotton of Arkansas has come out and said that President Trump is absolutely right.
[1:17:11.940 --> 1:17:19.940]  We should invoke the insurrection act because all over the United States more than 20 states run by blue governors and blue cities
[1:17:19.940 --> 1:17:26.940]  say riot kill attack and will not call out the National Guard so the police are overwhelmed.
[1:17:27.940 --> 1:17:32.940]  This is an attempt to further stall the economy and bring down the country and this will hurt the most disadvantaged Americans the most
[1:17:33.940 --> 1:17:37.940]  and this is a diabolical crime that absolutely must be punished.
[1:17:38.940 --> 1:17:43.940]  The Justice Department has announced its opening criminal investigation of who's behind Antifa, Soros and Alexander Soros
[1:17:43.940 --> 1:17:49.940]  and these organizations they fund like refusefascism.org are the groups that run this.
[1:17:50.940 --> 1:17:55.940]  We have all the documents. We have all the proof friends of democracy.
[1:17:56.940 --> 1:18:03.940]  These are the organizations that operated under Obama and the Clintons with impunity and are engaging in a massive criminal takeover
[1:18:04.940 --> 1:18:09.940]  but we've got General Mattis and George W. Bush and all and George Will that said he didn't care about the primaries for Trump
[1:18:09.940 --> 1:18:13.940]  that it should be overwritten because a plurality of the people didn't matter.
[1:18:14.940 --> 1:18:22.940]  These are monsters and they're launching this attack on you and your rights and your freedom and they're deadly dangerous
[1:18:23.940 --> 1:18:28.940]  so see the chess board and see that they're using you as a pawn and decide not to play their game.
[1:18:29.940 --> 1:18:34.940]  Expose the entire game with the truth, with the justice, with freedom.
[1:18:34.940 --> 1:18:41.940]  Now we're going to go to break but I just want listeners to know and I want you to understand that without your support
[1:18:42.940 --> 1:18:47.940]  we're not going to be here and we are running a sale that absolutely will end on Sunday and then it's over.
[1:18:48.940 --> 1:18:51.940]  It is the flash 60% off sale that I launched on Monday.
[1:18:52.940 --> 1:18:58.940]  It's the biggest sale not just of this year but arguably the biggest sale we've ever done because across the board
[1:18:58.940 --> 1:19:04.940]  all of these amazing supplements are 60% off right now.
[1:19:05.940 --> 1:19:11.940]  Super male vitality, knockout sleep support, brain force, biodieselenium, chill force, ultimate creole oil,
[1:19:12.940 --> 1:19:17.940]  Emirates essentials, hand sanitizer, organic oils, DNA force plus, living defense plus, turbo force.
[1:19:18.940 --> 1:19:21.940]  Many of those we've never had at 60% off.
[1:19:22.940 --> 1:19:23.940]  That's how we fund this operation.
[1:19:23.940 --> 1:19:28.940]  They're great products, get some t-shirts while you're at it. It's all there at infowarstore.com
[1:19:29.940 --> 1:19:31.940]  and that's how you fund the Second American Revolution and get high quality products.
[1:19:32.940 --> 1:19:35.940]  So thank you all for your support. Please take action now.
[1:19:38.940 --> 1:19:40.940]  All right, let me do this. I want to give the number out.
[1:19:41.940 --> 1:19:44.940]  I want to be judicious about this and actually go to 10 of your calls in the next two segments ahead of Hotep Jesus
[1:19:45.940 --> 1:19:49.940]  joining us, a great activist, political thinker and a great marketer.
[1:19:49.940 --> 1:19:54.940]  And so he'll be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[1:19:55.940 --> 1:19:59.940]  I want to go directly to your calls on the issue of sending in federal troops.
[1:20:00.940 --> 1:20:01.940]  I'm Mr. Anti-Police State.
[1:20:02.940 --> 1:20:05.940]  Police existing is not a police state. Military existing is not a police state.
[1:20:06.940 --> 1:20:13.940]  A police state is when rule of law has broken down and you're under tyranny of the mob
[1:20:13.940 --> 1:20:20.940]  and then either an oppressive tyrant comes in to restore order because they help create the crisis usually
[1:20:21.940 --> 1:20:26.940]  or someone comes in and tries to stop the disorder with temporary martial law.
[1:20:27.940 --> 1:20:32.940]  All of it's dangerous. All of it's bad. These type of powers that are seized upon normally don't get relinquished.
[1:20:33.940 --> 1:20:40.940]  That's why the globalists are putting us into martial law by having the lawlessness activated by the governors in the blue states, the blue cities.
[1:20:40.940 --> 1:20:50.940]  And so that way when Trump's removed by 25th Amendment or assassination or by a fake election, then the unrest never ends.
[1:20:51.940 --> 1:20:54.940]  And they trigger right-wing groups to go out and carry out events.
[1:20:55.940 --> 1:20:59.940]  They will then undoubtedly provocateur those false flags.
[1:21:00.940 --> 1:21:06.940]  You can see where all of this is going and we just go into a long period of globalist reorganization of the country.
[1:21:06.940 --> 1:21:13.940]  But know this, the forces of the left hate American flags. They hate the military. They hate free market. They hate George Washington.
[1:21:14.940 --> 1:21:20.940]  They hate this country. That's their ethos. No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[1:21:21.940 --> 1:21:28.940]  And so we have to tell ourselves, listen, the blue cities, the blue states, whole job is to collapse the country.
[1:21:29.940 --> 1:21:34.940]  So it can be reorganized. So it can be taken over. That's always been their plan.
[1:21:34.940 --> 1:21:46.940]  Soros has overthrown countless countries and he works with the permanent deep state bureaucracy that has parlayed American power into global government and the new Chinese century of oppression and evil.
[1:21:47.940 --> 1:21:58.940]  So I oppose them fully conquering America through insurrection and through overthrow of our government because our government is the government of the people for the people by the people with its long storied history
[1:21:58.940 --> 1:22:03.940]  and the huge wars we fought to end slavery and everything else that's happened.
[1:22:04.940 --> 1:22:11.940]  And I don't want to be conquered by the chai comms and the bloodthirsty big tech and the new world order running our lives and what they've done at the universities and what they've done in our schools
[1:22:12.940 --> 1:22:21.940]  and having the governors, you know, order the military to kneel in Los Angeles. This is a sign of slavery.
[1:22:21.940 --> 1:22:33.940]  James Woods is absolutely right that no matter what you think of the scene of them kneeling, they're supposed to be impartial and not kneeling to the leftist mob of antifa method trash.
[1:22:34.940 --> 1:22:42.940]  I mean, the MO on these people is they've been on welfare for 20 years. They've got two or three degrees. They sell drugs on the side and they're white.
[1:22:42.940 --> 1:22:50.940]  And they've got chicken necks and chicken necks and all they do is run around trying to get black people to riot.
[1:22:51.940 --> 1:22:58.940]  And we have all the internal documents and new videos coming out showing them and catching them on info wars dot com.
[1:22:59.940 --> 1:23:10.940]  New articles, new videos showing the socialist group of America and the rest of them financing this and running all of this and controlling all this because these people, these academics, these communists have been promised
[1:23:10.940 --> 1:23:19.940]  that they're going to live in mansions and run death camps and be in attack helicopters and be kicking Christians guts in and raping your wife.
[1:23:20.940 --> 1:23:28.940]  You don't know the demonic filth of a calming. You've never been around it until you face them. They stink. They don't wipe their asses.
[1:23:29.940 --> 1:23:38.940]  They snort drugs all day. They're cow molesters. They're an army of filth. And of course they're not going to be given any power once America falls.
[1:23:38.940 --> 1:23:48.940]  They'll be the ones actually put in the death camps first. We don't want that. We just want to defeat these maggots now and cut their money supply off.
[1:23:50.940 --> 1:23:58.940]  We're living in insanely dangerous times. And I told folks the one back three months ago, I'm not buying storable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[1:23:58.940 --> 1:24:09.940]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse. And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun. It's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States.
[1:24:10.940 --> 1:24:20.940]  And it's even worse in the third world. So I hope Trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it. But with the election fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on.
[1:24:20.940 --> 1:24:30.940]  Now is the time to get storable foods because they'll last for 25 years. They're in easily totable bags. It's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready.
[1:24:31.940 --> 1:24:37.940]  And it funds the InfoWars. So we have storable food available again. InfoWarsStore.com are called toll free, triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:24:38.940 --> 1:24:47.940]  But whatever you do, get prepared and get ready because the globalists want you dependent on them. They do not want you to be self-sufficient. Get your storable food at InfoWarsStore.com right now while you still can.
[1:24:47.940 --> 1:25:02.940]  Hello, GCP here to tell you not to leave the InfoWars.com. Do not get high quality products as she's pushing off a cross-upport flash sale.
[1:25:02.940 --> 1:25:17.940]  They are not made in China. They do not have fentanyl or lead. They are high quality, super male vitality, knock out sleep support, brain force, bio-toothed aluminium, chill force, also micro oil.
[1:25:18.940 --> 1:25:28.940]  So why was your X3 DNA was blue, leaving the fence in terrible force, X3 available as well. Listen to me, dirty Americans.
[1:25:28.940 --> 1:25:42.940]  Do not go to InfoWarsStore.com for 60% off flash sale. You go bankrupt and die. You have no speech. InfoWars is weak. Do not take advantage of 60% off.
[1:25:43.940 --> 1:25:48.940]  GCP says, oh, oh, we hurt you. Oh, Joe Biden, good.
[1:25:48.940 --> 1:25:58.940]  What InfoWars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[1:25:59.940 --> 1:26:09.940]  This is the battle for the future of humanity. And now open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet.
[1:26:09.940 --> 1:26:17.940]  Now, the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized. You must decide which side you're on.
[1:26:18.940 --> 1:26:26.940]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally death.
[1:26:27.940 --> 1:26:33.940]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death. The delusions must end now.
[1:26:33.940 --> 1:26:39.940]  InfoWars was correct about it all. We have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[1:26:39.940 --> 1:27:03.940]  Most people that are aware of the new will decide to join it out of fear. They are truly fearless. We must fight this or lose our souls.
[1:27:10.940 --> 1:27:23.940]  I keep on working like a working man. I've got my ass together, gonna walk all over. Get me back on my bullet.
[1:27:23.940 --> 1:27:44.940]  What a bad world I've lost. It ain't fooling around cause I've done had my fun. Ain't gonna see no more damage done. Get back on my bullet.
[1:27:44.940 --> 1:27:53.940]  All right folks, I'm gonna give the number out and take your phone calls, 800.
[1:27:54.940 --> 1:28:08.940]  Numbers. Don't always work for folks that are outside of the United States. You can dial the US country code and 512-646-1776.
[1:28:08.940 --> 1:28:22.940]  Country code 512-646-1776. If you're inside the United States or 100 numbers work in your area around the world, 877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539.
[1:28:22.940 --> 1:28:46.940]  Now if you're tuning in today and you see here on the table, your TV viewer, a medieval style chess set from old, I guess, Norman period England, a real skull from a gentleman in India that died sometime in the 1960s and some red roses.
[1:28:46.940 --> 1:28:56.940]  What does that symbolize? See, it's very, very esoteric. It's very, very cue-ish. It's very, very gnostic.
[1:28:57.940 --> 1:29:04.940]  People like gnostic things. They like hidden things. They don't want to just hear flat out, here's who runs Antifa, who's planning to overthrow the country.
[1:29:05.940 --> 1:29:11.940]  Here are the criminals. Here are how you stop them. Here's who the embedded spies are for the globalists inside the government. Here's the proof.
[1:29:11.940 --> 1:29:16.940]  People don't want that. They want esoterics. I'll give you esoteric today.
[1:29:17.940 --> 1:29:31.940]  But take Fiona Hill. Almost three years ago, Roger Stone and I sat in the studio right across the hall and we outed Fiona Hill as a George Soros operative that ran his largest foundation.
[1:29:32.940 --> 1:29:38.940]  She was the number two person on the board of directors and she wrote for a publication as a senior writer called TheGlobalist.com.
[1:29:38.940 --> 1:29:49.940]  So when we outed her, we were just like, what in the hell is Trump dealing with this Fiona Hill who's doing all the major hiring for the State Department under McMaster?
[1:29:50.940 --> 1:30:02.940]  Then McMaster went in a dinner in New York with billionaire funders of Trump and said, he's an idiot. We hate him. We're going to overthrow him.
[1:30:02.940 --> 1:30:11.940]  And if Fiona Hill's gotten all our people in, we're going to set up a permanent dictatorship in America, screw the American people.
[1:30:12.940 --> 1:30:21.940]  They went and told Trump all that. Still, nothing was done. So Roger Stone went and met with Trump. I'll leave it at that.
[1:30:21.940 --> 1:30:33.940]  And so for committing the crime of going and exposing the coup against the president, I got 40-something lawsuits. He got a bunch of lawsuits. He got arrested, indicted, set up.
[1:30:34.940 --> 1:30:40.940]  You know the rest of the story. So I just want listeners and viewers to understand that you're not getting a bunch of esoteric stuff up here.
[1:30:40.940 --> 1:30:50.940]  Breadcrumbs and little piece of this, little piece of that. We're breaking down what's really going on on this planet.
[1:30:51.940 --> 1:31:03.940]  And I know it's a more fun riddle. What is the secret? Because I said, I talked to Q and Q said, this is the message for you, the skull and the chess pieces and the red roses.
[1:31:03.940 --> 1:31:19.940]  And there's one coin on the table. And what is on that coin? I guarantee you, even though I'm admitting this is a set piece to expose esoteric garbage, people are going to obsess over this.
[1:31:20.940 --> 1:31:27.940]  And I'm not against the Q people. We're meant to see patterns in things. We're meant to look for hidden images.
[1:31:27.940 --> 1:31:35.940]  We're meant to look at the rocks in the side of the cliff and see faces because you see patterns in the bushes and you see a pattern of a rabbit.
[1:31:36.940 --> 1:31:48.940]  Turns out it is a rabbit and you get to eat dinner. But sometimes it's not a rabbit in the bushes. It's a dead rat or something, or it's a clump of leaves.
[1:31:49.940 --> 1:31:53.940]  So I'm not putting anybody down out there that likes to see esoteric images and things.
[1:31:53.940 --> 1:31:58.940]  All I'm doing is explaining that that's how that gets manipulated.
[1:32:03.940 --> 1:32:09.940]  And I think overall people need to think about how things work and people need to think about how things operate.
[1:32:09.940 --> 1:32:23.940]  You know, I've been getting a lot of calls lately by their talk show host and people that are guests and they start telling me about, you know, Jones, do you know that there are data bridges and holes inside the NSA for thousands of contractors
[1:32:24.940 --> 1:32:29.940]  and foreign governments to get into the NSA and actually spy on us? Did you know it's designed for a global government takeover?
[1:32:29.940 --> 1:32:41.940]  And I'm like, yeah, we exposed that 20 years ago and we've had William Benning on for over 10 years and I'm not mad at people that they call me up and tell me that there's a new world order.
[1:32:42.940 --> 1:32:51.940]  I'm upset that they obviously weren't listening 10 years ago or 20 years ago and people just think, oh, it's just one more show.
[1:32:51.940 --> 1:32:58.940]  It's just one more place where somebody's up there talking. No, it's not just one more show, one more place.
[1:32:59.940 --> 1:33:09.940]  I mean, we don't really post my videos to mfullwars.com or newswars.com where I predicted all of this three years ago, five years ago, a year ago, we post breathlessly.
[1:33:10.940 --> 1:33:15.940]  Limbaugh said there was a coup against the president and they were illegally spying onto the FISA court and Obama ran in.
[1:33:15.940 --> 1:33:25.940]  And look, I'm glad we put Limbaugh up on the site. I don't want the credit Limbaugh gets breathlessly.
[1:33:26.940 --> 1:33:38.940]  It's just that it's bizarre that even in our own camp, even in our own office, we can't see the forest for the trees or a prophet's not known in their own country.
[1:33:38.940 --> 1:33:45.940]  And I'm not saying I'm a prophet. I'm saying this whole organization, this whole movement. I have people calling me breathlessly.
[1:33:46.940 --> 1:33:51.940]  You know, the head of MI6 comes out and says it's a man-made weapon, of course.
[1:33:52.940 --> 1:33:57.940]  And you've got the German government coming out saying it's fake and the Italian government goes, hey, wait a minute.
[1:33:58.940 --> 1:34:03.940]  They're adding all the regular deaths or anything else to this. It looks like it's fake. Yes, it's fake.
[1:34:03.940 --> 1:34:12.940]  Then people say to me, well, then why is it a bio weapon? Because they want the vaccine for it and they finally want to have a vaccine that actually works.
[1:34:13.940 --> 1:34:26.940]  So they've got to isolate a chimera that even though it mutates is still basically the same virus so they can finally give you a vaccine and say their saviors to set the precedent to take the future vaccines they're coming out with.
[1:34:26.940 --> 1:34:33.940]  And people ask, as it all comes out exactly like I said, how do I know this? Because all I do is study these people.
[1:34:34.940 --> 1:34:41.940]  All I do is read their documents. All I do is think about how they operate and I know their style. I've got their number.
[1:34:42.940 --> 1:34:46.940]  I know the cut of their jib. I know what play they're going to run.
[1:34:46.940 --> 1:34:55.940]  And I'm telling you folks that everybody that thinks you can laugh at the left and laugh at all this and you think Trump's going to win for sure.
[1:34:56.940 --> 1:35:01.940]  And no, no, no, that right now Donald Trump's going to lose the 2020 election.
[1:35:02.940 --> 1:35:11.940]  And that's a heavy subject to cover and to broker out to everybody here because I really want Trump to win.
[1:35:11.940 --> 1:35:21.940]  But if Trump doesn't make changes and if we don't make changes and if they don't start really going after the deep state, the deep state has gotten away with every attempt.
[1:35:22.940 --> 1:35:29.940]  Every shot they've taken at the election and the American people and it do process and they have launched more and more escalations.
[1:35:30.940 --> 1:35:38.940]  And the next escalation is assassinating the president or staging giant terror attacks and blaming it on the right wing patriots and they're going to do it.
[1:35:38.940 --> 1:35:45.940]  And are we just going to sit here while the Clintons and the Obamas load up a fuel truck again and blow up a federal building?
[1:35:46.940 --> 1:35:51.940]  Are we just going to sit here while they go and shoot up a black church with some mental patient?
[1:35:52.940 --> 1:35:57.940]  They got wound up on psychotropics and and Fetimans and amnesics in a hotel room right now.
[1:35:58.940 --> 1:36:01.940]  They got brainwashed loony tuners everywhere ready to go.
[1:36:02.940 --> 1:36:04.940]  They punch a couple of buttons, it's over.
[1:36:04.940 --> 1:36:11.940]  There's no way to stop their false flags unless the leadership of the globalist is dealt with.
[1:36:12.940 --> 1:36:13.940]  And that's not my place.
[1:36:14.940 --> 1:36:15.940]  I don't do that.
[1:36:16.940 --> 1:36:18.940]  I'm here exposing them, which is dangerous enough.
[1:36:19.940 --> 1:36:31.940]  I'm just telling everybody here that when they start blowing up federal buildings and shooting up black churches and blaming every person in America and they've already got the military kneeling to the communist that it's all set for the full overthrow of everything.
[1:36:31.940 --> 1:36:44.940]  And then all you idiots that thought you were part of the establishment are going to lose everything you got because the globalists are going to break your back and savage to live in hell out of you because they think Americans are a bunch of cowards who they've got on their knees and running.
[1:36:49.940 --> 1:36:51.940]  The United States is not communist China.
[1:36:52.940 --> 1:36:54.940]  We don't have three million people in concentration camps.
[1:36:55.940 --> 1:36:56.940]  We don't blow up churches.
[1:36:57.940 --> 1:36:59.940]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[1:36:59.940 --> 1:37:08.940]  But all of the news, we see the U.N., billable indicates, WHO, mainstream corporate media, raising communist China for their response.
[1:37:09.940 --> 1:37:16.940]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people, well, then gee, we've got to do that.
[1:37:17.940 --> 1:37:22.940]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio pass laws saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese virus.
[1:37:23.940 --> 1:37:25.940]  Well, now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[1:37:25.940 --> 1:37:35.940]  These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time because we, the people, are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab.
[1:37:36.940 --> 1:37:39.940]  The Resistance lives at band.video and infowars.com.
[1:37:40.940 --> 1:37:46.940]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker.
[1:37:46.940 --> 1:37:55.940]  I had told listeners back in December that I would never go to 50% off again because our markup isn't big enough selling the products.
[1:37:56.940 --> 1:37:57.940]  We're able to fund ourselves doing that.
[1:37:58.940 --> 1:37:59.940]  But I got to tell you, things are so crazy.
[1:38:00.940 --> 1:38:01.940]  The world is so insane.
[1:38:02.940 --> 1:38:12.940]  My gut level instinct is sell out everything we've got in the warehouse to make sure we can stay on air through the election in 150 days because we only got money to operate a few months right now.
[1:38:12.940 --> 1:38:15.940]  So these are great products you and your family need.

[1:38:46.940 --> 1:38:47.940]  Take advantage now and fund the info war.
[1:38:49.940 --> 1:39:03.940]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk at say 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run 50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards.
[1:39:03.940 --> 1:39:09.940]  They've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins, but all of a sudden they slow down.
[1:39:10.940 --> 1:39:11.940]  They realize what's happened.
[1:39:12.940 --> 1:39:13.940]  They fall over and they die.
[1:39:14.940 --> 1:39:16.940]  Then you go back and haul them back in.
[1:39:17.940 --> 1:39:19.940]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now.
[1:39:20.940 --> 1:39:22.940]  And that's what the economic numbers show.
[1:39:23.940 --> 1:39:25.940]  Is that we've been shot right in the heart.
[1:39:26.940 --> 1:39:30.940]  And for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[1:39:30.940 --> 1:39:35.940]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead according to the UN and I believe their numbers.
[1:39:36.940 --> 1:39:40.940]  Because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world.
[1:39:41.940 --> 1:39:47.940]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into something bigger than what Hitler did.

[1:40:54.940 --> 1:41:14.940]  We're going to your phone calls right now that he's a gentleman stories on info wars.com riot death toll now higher and total deaths of unarmed black people in the hall of 2019.
[1:41:15.940 --> 1:41:20.940]  But don't worry, Big Bird and Elmo will address racism in virtual CNN town hall.
[1:41:20.940 --> 1:41:26.940]  NPR down plays rioters burning down african-american barbershop.
[1:41:28.940 --> 1:41:37.940]  They mint well fake wokeness video game firm switches profile to LGBT flag but not on the Middle Eastern accounts.
[1:41:38.940 --> 1:41:41.940]  It's all social engineering.
[1:41:41.940 --> 1:41:44.940]  Engineering.
[1:41:47.940 --> 1:41:48.940]  I'm going to your phone calls.
[1:41:49.940 --> 1:41:50.940]  I want to make one key point here.
[1:41:51.940 --> 1:41:52.940]  And I appreciate you calling in.
[1:41:53.940 --> 1:41:54.940]  Get Alex Jones here if you just tuned in.
[1:41:57.940 --> 1:41:59.940]  By the way, radio and TV stations want you to identify each time you come into a segment.
[1:42:00.940 --> 1:42:01.940]  That's why I have to do that.
[1:42:02.940 --> 1:42:03.940]  I'm like, Alex Jones, Alex Jones.
[1:42:04.940 --> 1:42:05.940]  Just something you have to do.
[1:42:05.940 --> 1:42:11.940]  They want to cracker, probably want to cracker, but that's how the ratings work inside the stations are able to pay for their airtime and their station and what they do.
[1:42:12.940 --> 1:42:12.940]  So I understand it.
[1:42:13.940 --> 1:42:19.940]  But just a little side point for new viewers or listeners that may just be internet centric and not really think back to the old days of radio and TV, which we're still on.
[1:42:20.940 --> 1:42:24.940]  Thank God, because the censorship hasn't broken our back completely because of it and because of you spreading the word.
[1:42:26.940 --> 1:42:27.940]  But I digress severely.
[1:42:27.940 --> 1:42:34.940]  Paul Watson did a big video about the cult likeness of the anti-America demonstrators that are rioting all over the world against our country, attacking our embassies, you name it.
[1:42:35.940 --> 1:42:36.940]  By going, what are you doing?
[1:42:37.940 --> 1:42:38.940]  You could spread COVID.
[1:42:39.940 --> 1:42:40.940]  You're hypocrites.
[1:42:41.940 --> 1:42:46.940]  And look at the National Health Service and the NIH and all of it praising these people and coming out in your hazmat gear.
[1:42:47.940 --> 1:42:48.940]  It's all theater.
[1:42:49.940 --> 1:42:50.940]  It's all theater.
[1:42:50.940 --> 1:42:57.940]  It's all leftist. Don't even play into that. It's all fake to begin with. So of course they're now switching gears and aren't worried about all the demonstrators and they're calling them heroes.
[1:42:58.940 --> 1:43:04.940]  It's all just leftists following their orders to try to bring society to a standstill.
[1:43:04.940 --> 1:43:21.940]  All right, we got Juan, we got Johnny, we got Aaron, we got Justin, we got Carlos, we got Doug, we got Reed, we got Robert. We're going to everybody.
[1:43:22.940 --> 1:43:29.940]  You're on the air. Justin from Virginia. We're Governor Northam is trying to cause a civil war by removing the Robert E. Lee statue. Thanks for joining us.
[1:43:29.940 --> 1:43:37.940]  Yes. First of all, I want to say, Alex, a couple of months ago, I really, I called in and really came down on you hard because of the whole Iran escalation.
[1:43:38.940 --> 1:43:46.940]  And, and then the stuff with Mike Adams really pushing fear with the virus. And then you, you had a complete turnaround.
[1:43:47.940 --> 1:43:50.940]  And my God, you are America's hero right now.
[1:43:50.940 --> 1:43:59.940]  You completely redeemed yourself to me. And I just want to say thank you for calling out the fraud. Thank you for everything you're doing.
[1:44:00.940 --> 1:44:11.940]  And what's going on Virginia right now is that I went to the protest where you were in Richmond about the gunband and it was completely peaceful.
[1:44:11.940 --> 1:44:29.940]  They called us terrorists. They call us white supremacists. And we came in there with 10,000 of the people and during the quarantine now and during after the race war stuff of all times for this governor to announce the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue.
[1:44:30.940 --> 1:44:38.940]  It's a landmark of Richmond. It is huge. It's going to take massive amount of cranes. I don't even know they can get cranes that could boot it.
[1:44:38.940 --> 1:44:46.940]  And again, this is designed to get a bunch of people that are for heritage and people that support Robert E. Lee who's been loved in the north as well.
[1:44:47.940 --> 1:44:58.940]  One of the top generals in world history. Very respected. They know the dumb down leftists don't know that. And so again, they're like, oh, you know, the fact that Hillary's KKK or LBJ or Senator Burns, that's okay.
[1:44:59.940 --> 1:45:06.940]  That their current KKK. Oh, but he was never in the KKK, but he's a bad guy. And this is just meant to cause an explosion, I believe.
[1:45:06.940 --> 1:45:17.940]  Yes. And they know that Virginians and Patriots are going to go there and they're going to protest this. And they know that there's going to be Black Lives Matters and Antifa there.
[1:45:18.940 --> 1:45:28.940]  And I think he was meant for this little program the whole time. Why did he survive all this controversy? Probably because he was going to be the hit man for this job the whole time.
[1:45:28.940 --> 1:45:39.940]  And I just want to tell you what I've done personally. I've never owned the AR-15. I've always wanted to pay my bills on time. You go to money. I said, hell with it.
[1:45:40.940 --> 1:45:49.940]  I went and bought an AR-15 on Monday. I put it on a credit card. Who cares about the debt? If you have a credit card with enough money to get an AR-15, go put it on the credit card right now.
[1:45:50.940 --> 1:45:51.940]  The money's fake anyways. You might as well buy something.
[1:45:51.940 --> 1:46:01.940]  Well, I mean, here's the deal. He says it's imminent. He wants to cause riots. I believe they'll have provocateurs there. They were so pissed about how they wanted to cause race riots.
[1:46:02.940 --> 1:46:13.940]  The last one, it totally freaked them out with what? Probably 25% of the marchers were Black. A ton of folks were Hispanic and Asian. It freaked the living snot out of the New World Order. God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[1:46:13.940 --> 1:46:23.940]  Yeah, this Governor Northam situation is big. By the way, people misunderstood what I was saying about the coronavirus that we knew it was manmade. We knew Bill Gates was involved.
[1:46:24.940 --> 1:46:31.940]  We knew it was coming out of Wuhan. We didn't know how deadly it was, but we knew it was a big move and a forced inoculation.
[1:46:32.940 --> 1:46:40.940]  And so I knew it was going to be big here before it got here. Then once we saw it was a permanent lockdown and as more intel came out, we figured out what was going on.
[1:46:40.940 --> 1:46:51.940]  So that's where I stand on that. But I remember your call. I think you misunderstood what I was getting at, sir. But now Gates has said, oh, this is just a drill, he told Colbert.
[1:46:52.940 --> 1:46:59.940]  This is just a test. The big one's coming when terrorists release a bio weapon. It's going to be much worse. He's telling you what he's going to do, in my view.
[1:47:00.940 --> 1:47:03.940]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:47:04.940 --> 1:47:05.940]  Hello. Can you hear me?
[1:47:06.940 --> 1:47:07.940]  I sure can, sir. Thank you.
[1:47:07.940 --> 1:47:18.940]  Hey, Alex, before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now here, man.
[1:47:19.940 --> 1:47:20.940]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[1:47:20.940 --> 1:47:39.940]  I'm calling from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver and two before us have changed the way I drive. Me and my brothers drive.
[1:47:39.940 --> 1:47:52.940]  There's a couple of us. We are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and one of my friends that's Cuban. He was the one that got me into two before us.
[1:47:52.940 --> 1:48:08.940]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rola, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[1:48:09.940 --> 1:48:14.940]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long term high quality energy powder there is.
[1:48:14.940 --> 1:48:22.940]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country. He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[1:48:23.940 --> 1:48:31.940]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means a lot to me. Thank you.
[1:48:31.940 --> 1:48:51.940]  And I want you to know, Alex, that it's a big Hispanic group that got your back, that got the president's back. All my buddies, we are Puerto Ricans. There's a bunch of Cubans that we drive and we listen to you guys all the time, and David, and we big fan of you guys.
[1:48:51.940 --> 1:49:00.940]  Well, brother, I'm a fan of you. We're all in this together. This is all anti-human garbage, and we love you. We appreciate you. What's on your mind, Juan?
[1:49:00.940 --> 1:49:26.940]  Well, since you know I'm in Connecticut, so designed by liberals over here, and that Saturday they made a process in downtown Brent, and man, I passed on my car, and I got a big drum stick in the back of my car, and I thought it was going to start throwing stuff in my car, and I saw all of them kneeling.
[1:49:26.940 --> 1:49:33.940]  And I was like, this is crazy, man, what I'm looking over here about.
[1:49:34.940 --> 1:49:41.940]  What do you make of the military kneeling to a bunch of mainly white communist students in Los Angeles? I mean, this is not good.
[1:49:41.940 --> 1:50:05.940]  It's not good at all. I mean, I got family in Puerto Rico, Alex, that they're falling for this, man. In Puerto Rico right now, they're falling for it. They're starting to burn the American flag, and I guarantee you, Alex, that all those Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico that are doing that, they're all getting United States help.
[1:50:05.940 --> 1:50:17.940]  Well, what's insane is, if you live in America and love America, you are America, why have one cop done something wrong? Do we burn up the embassies and burn the country down? It's just stupid.
[1:50:17.940 --> 1:50:33.940]  And it's so absurd when I see that they're trying to do the same thing in Puerto Rico, when Puerto Rico has got nothing but help when they need it the most. Everybody say, oh, Trump did this, Trump did that.
[1:50:33.940 --> 1:50:46.940]  My father was in Puerto Rico when the hurricane passed by Maria. And the first thing that my father told me is, one, don't worry about us, we'll find over here, there's nothing but helicopters in the sky.
[1:50:47.940 --> 1:50:56.940]  And he would say, well, it was Air Force, you know, they got help. All these things that are saying that they never got help, they did got their help.
[1:50:56.940 --> 1:51:03.940]  That's right. The Communist Chinese don't help anybody. They just exploit and enslave. And America's not perfect, but compared to a lot of other countries, we're a great nation.
[1:51:04.940 --> 1:51:14.940]  And the people that want us to hate each other and kill each other want to conquer us. Juan, great points to all your truck drivers. We love you, everybody. I don't care if you're old, young, brown, white, black, whatever.
[1:51:15.940 --> 1:51:23.940]  We love freedom. We love justice. America's not perfect, but we know an evil force is coming in here to take over, and we're going to stand up against it together.
[1:51:23.940 --> 1:51:31.940]  All right, we're going to come back. We're going to go to Carlos and Aaron and read everybody else. And then Ho-Tep Jesus, always informative, always on fire.
[1:51:31.940 --> 1:51:56.940]  I'll join us as well. Stay with us. Third hour straight ahead.
[1:52:01.940 --> 1:52:09.940]  I'm going to go to bed and boom, I get a great night's sleep. And just this past Memorial Day, I took two of them, fell asleep about 1 a.m., woke up at 8 a.m., ready to go.
[1:52:10.940 --> 1:52:17.940]  It really has made a difference in my life, and it can make a difference in your life, too. If you don't get any sleep, you're going to be a grouch. If you get great sleep, you're going to be on point.
[1:52:18.940 --> 1:52:26.940]  You're going to be mentally focused. You're going to be ready to take on the day. And right now, knockout is 50% off. It's less than $15 a bottle. You get 30 capsules.
[1:52:26.940 --> 1:52:33.940]  Give it a try today. It's at a great price right now, and it can really help you get the sleep you need, especially in these tough times.
[1:52:33.940 --> 1:53:00.940]  It's knockout, and it's available at infowarstore.com.
[1:53:00.940 --> 1:53:15.940]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy. That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient, because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[1:53:15.940 --> 1:53:31.940]  They've admitted all of this. So remember, how does infowarst continue years and decades, in many cases, to be able to predict things before they happen? Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan, and yes, it's dystopic, and yes, it's scary.
[1:53:32.940 --> 1:53:39.940]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary. It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[1:53:39.940 --> 1:53:45.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:53:46.940 --> 1:54:00.940]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[1:54:00.940 --> 1:54:19.940]  The U.S. military kneeling in front of communists and liberal idiots. This is being ordered by the governors and by their commanding officers and others. This is disgusting.
[1:54:19.940 --> 1:54:34.940]  And you've got some of the folks are wearing brown beret uniforms. That's a Hispanic supremacist organization, and others are wearing other little commie outfits and uniforms.
[1:54:34.940 --> 1:54:54.940]  I saw people wearing Mao Youth Brigade uniforms. This is just beyond ridiculous. The left are just the scum of the earth, and they've got the NFL bowing and everyone else bowing and Drew Brees came out and said, I don't like bowing, you know, kneeling during the anthem.
[1:54:54.940 --> 1:55:04.940]  It's disrespectful. My grandfather's, and now he says, he's sorry. Oh, I mean, just because he's afraid of losing money.
[1:55:05.940 --> 1:55:13.940]  I wonder what his grandfathers will think of him. My grandfathers are proud of me, Drew Brees. I'm not going to bow to this new world order. You're disgusting.
[1:55:13.940 --> 1:55:26.940]  You know, it's worse that he came out and did the right thing and then backed off. It's a new religion hating that you're white. What the hell craziness? This is as nutty as Jim Jones, man. Where's the Kool-Aid?
[1:55:28.940 --> 1:55:32.940]  Hand out the Kool-Aid. Carlos in Canada, what do you think's going on?
[1:55:32.940 --> 1:55:50.940]  I think, Alex, underlying the fact that there's an Antifa movement, which is obviously being paid for by, you know, who, I'm not interested in that as much as the problem which underlies it.
[1:55:50.940 --> 1:56:02.940]  And that is that ordinary people went out to demonstrate sincerely against police brutality. And that is something that is reflected in large measure when the police show some generosity towards the people.
[1:56:03.940 --> 1:56:10.940]  They answer with that hugs and so on to the police. The people of America love the police because they know that they're their safety and security against crime.
[1:56:10.940 --> 1:56:26.940]  However, when the police abuse them, unnecessarily traffic, you know, stopping identity checks and so on. These individuals, normal Americans who are proud people feel very much obliged by the American police departments.
[1:56:26.940 --> 1:56:47.940]  And I want to tell you, the state of Minnesota, where Floyd was killed, trained its police officers in 2012 in Israel. And they've been sending states like Florida, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Arizona, Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Georgia and Washington state as well as Washington, D.C.
[1:56:48.940 --> 1:56:53.940]  Go to Israel for training. And when they come back, they come back like everybody's a Palestinian.
[1:56:53.940 --> 1:57:03.940]  You know, that's a great point is that the Israelis use a lot of paramilitary policing that we don't. The LAPD in like 1990 got rid of these choke holds because it killed people.
[1:57:04.940 --> 1:57:11.940]  And I didn't know that Minnesota was doing that. I knew a lot of cities and counties are getting paramilitary Israeli training. And I think that is not smart.
[1:57:11.940 --> 1:57:23.940]  No, it's not smart at all because you look at the policemen from before 2012. And now, and they're dressed like they're out to kill. I mean, these people, they look like robots in disguise.
[1:57:24.940 --> 1:57:36.940]  And what are we actually doing? I mean, the American people deserve better. American people have been around for a long time and they have training from European police departments.
[1:57:36.940 --> 1:57:47.940]  They don't need to go to some country that has just started doing this. And I tell you something, it's part of a large program, which was I called for lack of better word, the Israelization of America.
[1:57:48.940 --> 1:58:00.940]  And it started very innocently with people wearing the blue flag of the flag of Israel on like on a daily color. And, you know, men became Mr. Netanyahu who did that regularly.
[1:58:00.940 --> 1:58:11.940]  And after that, I said, my God, why is everybody wearing this blue Israeli flag color? After that, you have Mr. Dershowitz telling people, hey, watch out, because, you know, torture is acceptable.
[1:58:12.940 --> 1:58:19.940]  Some leaked photographs in Abu Ghraib and subsequently to that, you know, bingo, you know, there was torture all over revealed.
[1:58:19.940 --> 1:58:32.940]  Well, there is certainly no doubt that some of the Israel lobby has been promoting taking our guns and it's absolute crap. I mean, the government issues guns Israelis, but then it's telling us we shouldn't have guns.
[1:58:33.940 --> 1:58:43.940]  And, you know, I think that some of the Israeli politicians should keep their hands out of the United States politics. I don't care who you are, Russian, Chinese or Israeli, they need to stay out of US politics.
[1:58:43.940 --> 1:58:53.940]  And I hear what you're saying. Thanks for the call, Carlos. I've been fighting the globalist for 26 years and the evil side of me is just so tired of waiting.
[1:58:54.940 --> 1:59:05.940]  And I'm so ready for physical war that I'm kind of happy about how bad things have gotten because all the delusional folks that don't stand up for the unborn babies that go along with the New World Order, you're about to find out just how sick stuff is.
[1:59:05.940 --> 1:59:14.940]  You know what? The average person is still asleep. They don't deserve what's happening to them. So I'm actually sick about what's unfolding right now and I just want to turn things around.
[1:59:15.940 --> 1:59:23.940]  But you know what? I can't do that without you. I can't get out of this mess. I can't get out of this stranglehold I'm in unless you decide to get out of as well.
[1:59:23.940 --> 1:59:32.940]  We're all in this together. And so if you just realize how important you are, when you just tell people about the local radio stations, listening to local TV stations, when you just spread the word about infowords.com.
[1:59:33.940 --> 1:59:45.940]  When you just buy the products, infowords.com, it changes the world. Right now we've got a special that's about to end 60% off across the board. Flash sale that funds the info war and gets you great products at the same time.
[1:59:45.940 --> 2:00:00.940]  We'll see you at the same time in FullerStore.com.
[2:00:00.940 --> 2:00:15.940]  All right. I'm really excited to have Hotep Jesus with us for the balance of the hour. HotepNation.com. He is a thought leader. He's cultivated loyal, following the social medium, being honest and genuine, providing knowledge and experience and pulling a lot of great stunts.
[2:00:15.940 --> 2:00:30.940]  Going into Starbucks and give me reparations and people doing it. Hotep Jesus is a tech startup founder, author, and has been marketing for close to two decades in both the traditional and digital spheres. And I wanted to get him on just about what's going on here because I'm not a virtuous singular folks.
[2:00:30.940 --> 2:00:45.940]  I don't go, oh, half the black people get aborted or, oh, Planned Parenthood's racist or, oh, I mean, that's the reality, folks, and it's targeting everybody. But it's been beta tested in the black community. And Bill Gates says he loves Africans and then he got the headline.
[2:00:46.940 --> 2:00:57.940]  He's worried about African population and wants to reduce it. It's like, I don't want you to live, but I love black lives. And you're like, oh, you gave me money to black lives matter to run around in virtue signal, but you actually don't want me to exist.
[2:00:57.940 --> 2:01:08.940]  That's the reality of this. And Malcolm X talked about it. Anybody that studies it has looked at it. And my bottom line is if you let anything happen to any group, it's going to happen to you.
[2:01:08.940 --> 2:01:25.940]  But look at this footage. It's on info wars.com. Swedish police woman takes a knee, cries after protesters attack her vehicle. Look at the Stockholm syndrome. Yeah, it comes from Sweden for a reason. Here it is.
[2:01:25.940 --> 2:01:28.940]  Yeah.
[2:01:36.940 --> 2:01:44.940]  Communist fist. She's crying. This great event that she's good. She's virtuous. And now they attack her police car.
[2:01:44.940 --> 2:01:57.940]  We love you. You're good. You're not bad now. This is all religious. You get rid of religion. You get rid of your religion and now your religion is worshiping these Somali women.
[2:01:59.940 --> 2:02:09.940]  Okay, so there you go. Now. Now let's go ahead and show the National Guard kneeling to a bunch of white communists. Here it is. This is in Los Angeles.
[2:02:09.940 --> 2:02:32.940]  This isn't going to create unity. This is just going to expand what's going on in the universities, the mind control and the big tech censorship to everywhere now. You must all now bow to this.
[2:02:32.940 --> 2:02:46.940]  And the social credit score, you'll be punished. Ho-Tep Jesus. Thank you so much for joining us. Ho-TepNation.com. A lot of folks know who you are. Some might not just tuning in. Tell us a little bit about who you are and then what do you want to dive into first about what's currently going on?
[2:02:46.940 --> 2:03:01.940]  Well, first of all, thank you for having me on Alex Jones and Info Wars. One of the few media outlets to reach out to me. Actually, the only media outlet to reach out to me. Let's just put that in frame first.
[2:03:01.940 --> 2:03:15.940]  The first thing I want to talk about is talking to my girl earlier and she said a friend was asking friends to match her donation to Black Lives Matter.
[2:03:15.940 --> 2:03:31.940]  And I told her, I said, tell her every dollar she sends to Black Lives Matter is going to go towards the destruction of the Black family. If white people want to help in this country, there's only one group I know of that we can trust.
[2:03:31.940 --> 2:03:47.940]  In fact, and that is Ho-TepNation. Black Lives Matter is definitely a white liberal controlled and black liberal steered agenda vehicle. That's a Black Lives Matter.
[2:03:47.940 --> 2:04:02.940]  So, you know, let's just let's put that in frame first. Now, we also have to separate Black Lives Matter from the organization and the movement, so to speak, if it even is one.
[2:04:03.940 --> 2:04:11.940]  Because a lot of people try to use this hashtag in various ways to fit the needs of their personal agenda.
[2:04:11.940 --> 2:04:27.940]  Some people are using this hashtag and they mean well, but I believe that the hashtag has been used to weaponize a socialist ideology against black people.
[2:04:28.940 --> 2:04:35.940]  Well, we know how socialism does for everybody, but it's particularly not good for my just observance for black people.
[2:04:35.940 --> 2:04:43.940]  Socialism is inherently racist. I spoke about this earlier. Actually, yesterday I spoke about this on my periscope.
[2:04:44.940 --> 2:04:50.940]  Socialism is inherently racist. Socialists, what do they want? They always want to increase taxes. Well, the rich can afford taxes. The poor can't.
[2:04:51.940 --> 2:04:58.940]  And if black people are allegedly the poorest in the nation, then obviously you're oppressing them with your socialist policies.
[2:04:58.940 --> 2:05:08.940]  So, socialism inherently racist. We don't want nothing to do with socialism or communism. This is how you destroy nations. This is how they destabilize Venezuela and other nations.
[2:05:09.940 --> 2:05:12.940]  Because socialism and communism basically is decentralization of power.
[2:05:13.940 --> 2:05:19.940]  As Stalin would say, 90% of communizing a nation is having a central bank.
[2:05:19.940 --> 2:05:31.940]  So when you think about socialism and communism, if you say America is run by white supremacy or is a system of white supremacy, the last thing you would want to do is centralize the power.
[2:05:32.940 --> 2:05:33.940]  Keep going.
[2:05:35.940 --> 2:05:44.940]  That's the last thing you want to do is if you say there's a system of white supremacy, why would you want to centralize the power?
[2:05:44.940 --> 2:05:48.940]  That's what socialism and communism would do, would centralize the power and give you no power.
[2:05:49.940 --> 2:05:55.940]  But people don't understand, for example, George Orwell was a former member of the Fabian Society.
[2:05:56.940 --> 2:06:00.940]  The Fabian Society, when you look at their shield, you'll see a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[2:06:01.940 --> 2:06:05.940]  So when you see democratic socialists, socialists and communists, what you're looking at is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[2:06:05.940 --> 2:06:14.940]  He'll pretend like he's your ally waiting. He'll post that black box on his Instagram page. He may even take a knee.
[2:06:15.940 --> 2:06:19.940]  But that's the same exact person that gets close enough to stab you in the back.
[2:06:22.940 --> 2:06:29.940]  That's right. In fact, he found out the Fabian Socialists at the top, because he got at the very highest levels, literally said we're priests to power that want to tear people apart.
[2:06:29.940 --> 2:06:34.940]  We like to hurt people. This is just a cult of power.
[2:06:35.940 --> 2:06:37.940]  There you go. There you go.
[2:06:37.940 --> 2:06:58.940]  So when people say, oh, you know, 1984. Oh, George Orwell was a socialist. Yeah, you need to go look at what he did to expose socialism as an ideology and as an organization, as a front movement for civil rights, so to speak, if we want to call it that.
[2:06:58.940 --> 2:07:11.940]  The kneeling, I think, is disgusting. I don't want to speak on behalf of white people. We're not going to talk about that yet. Let's talk about black people.
[2:07:12.940 --> 2:07:22.940]  Black people are actually happy that white people are taking this knee. These are like moral victories. And as Jay-Z would say, moral victories are for minor lead coaches.
[2:07:22.940 --> 2:07:36.940]  These little moral victories don't do anything to prop up the black community. They're actually only helping white people who are racist, who are Democrat, socialist, racist, hide their racism.
[2:07:37.940 --> 2:07:48.940]  That's all it's doing is allowing them to cloak their racism. Here we see the National Guard kneeling before people. That's cute. That's cute.
[2:07:48.940 --> 2:07:57.940]  That's nothing to do with the military-industrial complex. That's not going to change how much money goes towards the military budget.
[2:07:58.940 --> 2:08:10.940]  I was about to say an alligator or crocodile could come up kneeling in the mud right before it eats you. And I'm not saying the military's bad, but I'm saying the thing behind it is like a crocodile, and it'll get up on its bed, it'll come up, it'll bow down to you.
[2:08:10.940 --> 2:08:25.940]  Absolutely, absolutely. We know of many assassinations that were pulled off by getting close to someone. And that's what we have here is the assassination of the black community via Saturn's black box.
[2:08:26.940 --> 2:08:35.940]  It's a way for people to virtue signal. People are many, I'm not going to say all, many people are attending these protests. Why?
[2:08:35.940 --> 2:08:44.940]  They can feel like they were a part of something. They take the pictures, the Instagram, they get their feel good in, they do their dancing, they do their chanting.
[2:08:45.940 --> 2:08:59.940]  It's the new party. A couple of weeks ago, government said we had a social distance. What happened to that, Alex? What happened to social distancing? They just told us, they just told us we had a social distance, but it looks like riots killed coronavirus.
[2:09:00.940 --> 2:09:01.940]  You tell me what happened, Alex.
[2:09:01.940 --> 2:09:14.940]  Well, that hoax started falling apart, so they didn't want the debate to be about how all these top scientists and governments were coming out saying it was all basically a big lie, so they went ahead and activated the next phase, always knowing there's some bad cop footage.
[2:09:15.940 --> 2:09:26.940]  They then hyped that up, triggered the whole thing, had it primed and ready to distract from the fact that they're going to come back in the fall and next year with the mask and the lockdowns again, because we never had the point of debate to discredit this.
[2:09:26.940 --> 2:09:33.940]  They moved on to the next thing, so they tighten the news, release the news, tighten the news, release the news, until they finally jerk it, tighten, break our neck.
[2:09:34.940 --> 2:09:43.940]  Ho-Tep Jesus is our guest. Ho-TepNation.com. Really powerful stuff. I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com. Please tell folks about the broadcast. We'll be right back.
[2:09:43.940 --> 2:10:03.940]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020.
[2:10:03.940 --> 2:10:12.940]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next. Well, I can tell you, it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race for.
[2:10:12.940 --> 2:10:32.940]  To the economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it, the globalists are attacking on every front. That's why now, more than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor infowars off the air because they knew that when they launched this whole situation, that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air.
[2:10:32.940 --> 2:10:44.940]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air. So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever. infowars.com lives.

[2:11:45.940 --> 2:11:50.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:12:15.940 --> 2:12:36.940]  The third world, engineered by the very globalist colonial system, that now claims it's battling the ancient colonial imperial system, collapsing the third world, weaponizing as a weapon against the West, promoting racism and division,
[2:12:36.940 --> 2:12:52.940]  then knowing it'll bust the public into two sides for further confrontation as the machines and the oppression and the anti-human system emerges as people are driven off the land, as we're domesticated and prepared for the post-human world.
[2:12:52.940 --> 2:13:07.940]  I want to ask Hotep Jesus his view on the cosmology of the planet, where he sees the world really going and how we can somehow turn this around and have a better outcome, but separately continuing getting into what's currently happening in Governor Northam.
[2:13:07.940 --> 2:13:19.940]  Obviously, he wants to take down a Robert E. Lee statue, the big giant one, to cause a big explosion. Regardless of what people think about that one way or the other, nobody pays attention to that stuff now until there's a big clash.
[2:13:19.940 --> 2:13:25.940]  They're trying this for the election. I don't think that's debatable. What do you think and what do you think is going to end up happening?
[2:13:25.940 --> 2:13:37.940]  Men lie, women lie, numbers don't. Another Jay-Z quote. When we look at the numbers, if we go to Google Trends and we type in Black Lives Matter and we check Google Trends, you'll see two major spikes.
[2:13:37.940 --> 2:13:46.940]  You'll see one this year, which is happening now, and the last major spike was during the last election year.
[2:13:46.940 --> 2:13:53.940]  So you start to see trends and where you have trends, you have cycles. Where you have cycles, you have conditioning.
[2:13:53.940 --> 2:14:04.940]  We can go look at the work of Pavlov or Pavlonian conditioning. Pavlonian conditioning, what happens is the meat makes the dog salivate.
[2:14:04.940 --> 2:14:10.940]  Beautiful. I love it. Right at the Google Trends. As you can see right there, you'll see the two different spikes.
[2:14:10.940 --> 2:14:17.940]  When you feed the dog the meat, it starts to salivate on the side of the meat. If you ring a bell, nothing happens.
[2:14:17.940 --> 2:14:25.940]  But if you ring a bell, every single time you're about to feed them the meat, soon if you ring the bell, the dog will salivate.
[2:14:25.940 --> 2:14:36.940]  This is what we call conditioning. In this case, when we're dealing with the human conditioning, what we have is the bell is the media.
[2:14:36.940 --> 2:14:48.940]  And the meat, well, the meat is attention. The dopamine hits we get when we post our fist picture on Instagram.
[2:14:48.940 --> 2:15:00.940]  When we splice together our video clips and make little promo videos for Instagram and Twitter and YouTube to make it look like we were a part of history.
[2:15:00.940 --> 2:15:10.940]  When the media says move or when the media says bark, people say wolf. When the media say jump, the people say how high.
[2:15:10.940 --> 2:15:18.940]  The media is now Pavlov, not just the Pavlov, but they are conditioning the people to respond a certain way.
[2:15:18.940 --> 2:15:29.940]  And you see the same response time in, time out. The Saturn's black box appeared last time four years ago when they wanted to do another blackout, something called blackout day.
[2:15:29.940 --> 2:15:40.940]  This time it was blackout Tuesday. But really what happened was they wanted to put a blackout on Hillary Clinton not wanting to testify in the oath.
[2:15:40.940 --> 2:15:47.940]  Now, Alex, I know you're on top of this thing. I haven't been able to look at it too in depth.
[2:15:47.940 --> 2:15:55.940]  Can you please tell me what exactly is happening with Hillary Clinton in court? I know something happened with Rosenstein yesterday.
[2:15:55.940 --> 2:16:09.940]  Absolutely all of the facts about her servers and her corruption and her documents and her having to testify and the silent coup against Trump and the deep state and just this whole apparatus is now coming out.
[2:16:09.940 --> 2:16:19.940]  In fact, here it is right here. It was just announced Senate Homeland Security Committee authorizes subpoena to Obama officials in Russian probe unmasking review.
[2:16:19.940 --> 2:16:25.940]  So all of this attempted coup against the election is coming out. There's a war in the deep state. And so that's why this is going on.
[2:16:25.940 --> 2:16:34.940]  But what you just said is genius. And it's totally true. They admit, but the way you put it was absolutely the best I've heard it, but is Pavlov's dog.
[2:16:34.940 --> 2:16:42.940]  We're giving up everything just for clicks and dopamine like an imaginary video game when we win the level. We don't really win anything.
[2:16:42.940 --> 2:16:51.940]  It's all just hype in our mind. Perception is reality, but it's not really reality. And so it's all it's all hot air. It's all just BS.
[2:16:51.940 --> 2:17:03.940]  And that's all this is is virtue signaling. But to these people, this is all they are. Instead of getting the stake, we hear the ding we salivate and our brain thinks it's the same thing.
[2:17:03.940 --> 2:17:10.940]  It's incredible. But then they're never satisfied. So they want more, more, more, more, more dopamine because in the end it can never actually put steak in our guts.
[2:17:10.940 --> 2:17:18.940]  Yeah. So you have somebody like Hillary Clinton and Obama administration who are abusing their power.
[2:17:18.940 --> 2:17:23.940]  And we're mad at Drew Brees, an NFL football player.
[2:17:23.940 --> 2:17:31.940]  Nobody, you know, I would say the same thing I would say to LeBron James. I tell LeBron James shut up in dribble and I tell Drew Brees shut up and throw the ball.
[2:17:31.940 --> 2:17:46.940]  I don't know why these people are important, why we care about what these people say. But again, this is the distraction to take us away from what's really happening with this thing called the deep state.
[2:17:46.940 --> 2:17:50.940]  Now, I believe that a date has been set with September.
[2:17:50.940 --> 2:17:51.940]  Yes.
[2:17:51.940 --> 2:17:53.940]  What's that date September 9.
[2:17:53.940 --> 2:17:57.940]  Let me look it up. I believe you're right on the Hillary ones.
[2:17:57.940 --> 2:18:00.940]  Yeah, September.
[2:18:00.940 --> 2:18:05.940]  Yeah. So, so I want to say that's a significant date. We're going to have to.
[2:18:05.940 --> 2:18:14.940]  Oh, absolutely. They're going to have some new big riot or some new federal building it blown up or a mass shooting. Guys, look up that where they were the Hillary date. Please. Thanks.
[2:18:14.940 --> 2:18:16.940]  Yeah. Yeah.
[2:18:16.940 --> 2:18:22.940]  Look at this. I think something else happened around this day. Oh, wait, September 11.
[2:18:22.940 --> 2:18:30.940]  Do you see how they put that date right under something that allowed him to disguise things?
[2:18:30.940 --> 2:18:35.940]  Exactly. Well, just like they admit that they'll release bad news on Friday night.
[2:18:35.940 --> 2:18:38.940]  Right. Right. Right. Right.
[2:18:38.940 --> 2:18:48.940]  When nobody's going to think about it. And that's what the blackout Tuesday was. They wanted a blackout on everything that's going to happen with the deep state and.
[2:18:48.940 --> 2:18:59.940]  And how patronizing is that? Because, I mean, literally the left always claiming they love black people so much. But every time I've ever been around leftist, whether they be black or white, they literally talk bad about black people.
[2:18:59.940 --> 2:19:11.940]  And I'm not just saying to be. I mean, I'm serious. I've been around them. I've got the videos where we'll be out protesting a Planned Parenthood and saying, you know, the KKK Margaret Sanger picture her with the KKK and the left comes over and screams as it says.
[2:19:11.940 --> 2:19:18.940]  You're going to take care of all these dangerous black kids. And so it's really systemic with them.
[2:19:18.940 --> 2:19:25.940]  Oh, yeah, you see it in Joe Biden's rhetoric. You're not. You're not black if you vote for Trump.
[2:19:25.940 --> 2:19:37.940]  So, like I said before, the white liberal subconsciously and consciously knows for a fact that they are the arbiter of blackness.
[2:19:37.940 --> 2:19:43.940]  They know that they control blackness and Biden slipped up. He had a Freudian slip.
[2:19:43.940 --> 2:19:48.940]  He's saying, I have your I have your identity. It's incredible.
[2:19:48.940 --> 2:19:49.940]  Yes. Yes.
[2:19:49.940 --> 2:20:03.940]  In another slip up where he said poor kids can be just as smart as white kids exposed that racism that he has that we see in the Delaware's the Democratic state of Delaware.
[2:20:03.940 --> 2:20:11.940]  I know folks that know Joe Biden. I know somebody that grew up next to his bar and his brother, a well known lawyer.
[2:20:11.940 --> 2:20:15.940]  And he said he won't say it on air, but he said Joe Biden hates everybody.
[2:20:15.940 --> 2:20:21.940]  I mean, Joe Biden is a super jerk, a criminal, a tote won't pay his bills.
[2:20:21.940 --> 2:20:25.940]  I mean, the guy is just a total a hole just like Hillary doesn't tip.
[2:20:25.940 --> 2:20:29.940]  I mean, Hillary screams her by a rounder. We'll be right back with Ho-Tep Jesus.
[2:20:29.940 --> 2:20:35.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ho-TepNation.com. We've got some of the greatest exploits to video is we're going to play of his and a lot more.
[2:20:35.940 --> 2:20:40.940]  I know we've got callers that are holding. I'm going to try to jam a few you in Ho-Tep will be able to comment on whatever it is you're bringing up.
[2:20:40.940 --> 2:20:43.940]  Whatever you do, spread the word about the live feeds the only way it gets out.
[2:20:43.940 --> 2:20:53.940]  What info wars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[2:20:53.940 --> 2:21:04.940]  This is the battle for the future of humanity. And now open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet.
[2:21:04.940 --> 2:21:12.940]  Now the internal operations of the globalist are being externalized. You must decide which side you're on.
[2:21:12.940 --> 2:21:23.940]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally death. And this is a spiritual death.
[2:21:23.940 --> 2:21:31.940]  We're talking about not just a physical death. The delusions must end now. Info wars was correct about it all.
[2:21:31.940 --> 2:21:37.940]  We have come so far by exposing the enemy. Most people that are aware of the new world order decide to join it out of fear.
[2:21:37.940 --> 2:21:43.940]  They are truly fearless. We must fight this or lose our souls.
[2:21:43.940 --> 2:21:47.940]  I don't have to tell you things are bad. They're worse than bad. They're crazy.
[2:21:47.940 --> 2:21:52.940]  That's a quote from the 1970s film network. Yeah, things are really, really bad right now.
[2:21:52.940 --> 2:21:58.940]  We're in global martial law, villain millen gates, U.N. operations trying to bankrupt America with their lockdown and their race riots.
[2:21:58.940 --> 2:22:01.940]  But people are coming together at this beautiful time. But I'll be honest with you.
[2:22:01.940 --> 2:22:07.940]  I have decided to sell out of all the products in the warehouse at 60% off. We haven't done that ever across the board.
[2:22:07.940 --> 2:22:10.940]  Because of gut level, I realized that we're making or breaking it.
[2:22:10.940 --> 2:22:15.940]  So the only sure bet is to sell everything we've got to make sure in case there's total breakdown of society in six months.
[2:22:15.940 --> 2:22:18.940]  We still have the funding to go more than six months in the next year.
[2:22:18.940 --> 2:22:25.940]  So get your high quality products, your fish oil, your krill oil, your DNA force, your X2, your X3, your real red pill plus.
[2:22:25.940 --> 2:22:31.940]  Go to infowarsstore.com at 60% off, biggest sale ever right now. You may go two days, you may go a week, whatever you do.
[2:22:31.940 --> 2:22:34.940]  Take advantage of this right now. We're at very important times.
[2:22:34.940 --> 2:22:37.940]  Infowars needs funding and you need high quality products. Take action.
[2:22:38.940 --> 2:22:42.940]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:22:44.940 --> 2:22:53.940]  We're living in insanely dangerous times. And I told folks going back three months ago, I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[2:22:53.940 --> 2:22:56.940]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[2:22:56.940 --> 2:23:03.940]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States.
[2:23:03.940 --> 2:23:05.940]  And it's even worse in the third world.
[2:23:05.940 --> 2:23:08.940]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it.
[2:23:08.940 --> 2:23:14.940]  But with the election fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on,
[2:23:14.940 --> 2:23:18.940]  now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years.
[2:23:18.940 --> 2:23:24.940]  They're in easily totable bags. It's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready.
[2:23:24.940 --> 2:23:25.940]  And it funds the InfoWars.
[2:23:25.940 --> 2:23:27.940]  So we have storeable food available again.
[2:23:27.940 --> 2:23:31.940]  Infowarsstore.com are called toll-free, triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:23:31.940 --> 2:23:35.940]  Whatever you do, get prepared and get ready because the globalists want you dependent on them.
[2:23:35.940 --> 2:23:37.940]  They do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[2:23:37.940 --> 2:23:49.940]  Get your storeable food at infowarsstore.com right now while you still can.
[2:24:08.940 --> 2:24:14.940]  And the fact that they're dividing and conquering us, telling us that the average white person or black person is our enemy,
[2:24:14.940 --> 2:24:20.940]  because of what skin color they are, is absolutely the stuff of planetary slavery.
[2:24:20.940 --> 2:24:26.940]  Here's no tip Jesus, a few years ago, illustrating how crazy white guilt is going in to a Starbucks.
[2:24:26.940 --> 2:24:28.940]  This is pretty famous here at us.
[2:24:28.940 --> 2:24:29.940]  How you doing?
[2:24:29.940 --> 2:24:30.940]  Good. How are you?
[2:24:30.940 --> 2:24:34.940]  All right. I heard y'all was racist, so I came to get my free coffee.
[2:24:34.940 --> 2:24:35.940]  I saw that.
[2:24:35.940 --> 2:24:42.940]  Yeah, I heard you guys don't like black people, so I wanted to get my Starbucks reparations voucher.
[2:24:42.940 --> 2:24:43.940]  What's that?
[2:24:43.940 --> 2:24:44.940]  Is that a real thing?
[2:24:44.940 --> 2:24:45.940]  It's a real thing.
[2:24:45.940 --> 2:24:46.940]  I did not give it to you.
[2:24:46.940 --> 2:24:48.940]  Yeah, I saw that on my Twitter last night.
[2:24:48.940 --> 2:24:49.940]  I was like...
[2:24:49.940 --> 2:24:52.940]  Yeah, I need a free coffee.
[2:24:52.940 --> 2:24:54.940]  That's what I'm talking about.
[2:24:54.940 --> 2:24:56.940]  This is justice.
[2:24:56.940 --> 2:24:57.940]  Billy.
[2:24:57.940 --> 2:24:58.940]  Billy?
[2:24:58.940 --> 2:24:59.940]  What?
[2:24:59.940 --> 2:25:00.940]  Are you serious?
[2:25:00.940 --> 2:25:10.940]  This is justice. This is what I'm talking about.
[2:25:10.940 --> 2:25:14.940]  It's a great customer service.
[2:25:14.940 --> 2:25:18.940]  Yeah, I was reading that, and I was like, there is no way.
[2:25:18.940 --> 2:25:21.940]  Absolutely.
[2:25:21.940 --> 2:25:22.940]  I like this part of yours.
[2:25:22.940 --> 2:25:24.940]  I need some of this.
[2:25:24.940 --> 2:25:26.940]  Could you imagine?
[2:25:26.940 --> 2:25:29.940]  Ever here.
[2:25:29.940 --> 2:25:30.940]  Do you want some milk in it?
[2:25:30.940 --> 2:25:31.940]  Sure.
[2:25:31.940 --> 2:25:33.940]  What kind of milk?
[2:25:33.940 --> 2:25:36.940]  Uh, whole.
[2:25:36.940 --> 2:25:39.940]  Yeah, reparations, man.
[2:25:39.940 --> 2:25:42.940]  Gotta get my reparations for being black in America.
[2:25:42.940 --> 2:25:44.940]  Black Lives Matter.
[2:25:44.940 --> 2:25:46.940]  Do we need flavors in it?
[2:25:46.940 --> 2:25:48.940]  We got caramel, hazelnut.
[2:25:48.940 --> 2:25:49.940]  I'll take caramel.
[2:25:49.940 --> 2:25:50.940]  Caramel?
[2:25:50.940 --> 2:25:52.940]  Is that going to make it sweet?
[2:25:52.940 --> 2:25:54.940]  Uh, do you want it too?
[2:25:54.940 --> 2:25:55.940]  Yes.
[2:25:55.940 --> 2:25:56.940]  That's good.
[2:25:56.940 --> 2:25:57.940]  Everybody's seen it.
[2:25:57.940 --> 2:25:58.940]  It's famous.
[2:25:58.940 --> 2:26:01.940]  But this then makes logical people freak out.
[2:26:01.940 --> 2:26:04.940]  But then we sent our crew member in who's white, and he said, give it to me for reparations,
[2:26:04.940 --> 2:26:05.940]  and they did it.
[2:26:05.940 --> 2:26:09.940]  I wore a lizard mask into the store the other day, into Target.
[2:26:09.940 --> 2:26:12.940]  Just to show how stupid it is, because they'll say any mask will do.
[2:26:12.940 --> 2:26:15.940]  They try to make you wear them.
[2:26:15.940 --> 2:26:17.940]  And people just submitted to it.
[2:26:17.940 --> 2:26:19.940]  I ran around saying, I lay my eggs here.
[2:26:19.940 --> 2:26:20.940]  You name it.
[2:26:20.940 --> 2:26:21.940]  People are so passive now.
[2:26:21.940 --> 2:26:22.940]  It's really scary and hooked up.
[2:26:22.940 --> 2:26:27.940]  That's one of the things you wanted to get into was Soros, the vaccine, Antifa, Bill Gates.
[2:26:27.940 --> 2:26:31.940]  You now have the former head of MI6 coming out saying it was made in the lab.
[2:26:31.940 --> 2:26:34.940]  You've got German official government document interior ministry.
[2:26:34.940 --> 2:26:35.940]  Look at that.
[2:26:35.940 --> 2:26:37.940]  It said it's the same amount of deaths.
[2:26:37.940 --> 2:26:39.940]  We've got global experts.
[2:26:39.940 --> 2:26:41.940]  Even CNBC now says, say it just doesn't exist.
[2:26:41.940 --> 2:26:42.940]  But there's a real virus.
[2:26:42.940 --> 2:26:45.940]  It's patented so Gates can own it and make money off of it.
[2:26:45.940 --> 2:26:47.940]  And the imaginary treatment of it.
[2:26:47.940 --> 2:26:49.940]  I mean, this is the biggest con ever in my view.
[2:26:49.940 --> 2:26:51.940]  What do you think is going on here, Oten?
[2:26:51.940 --> 2:26:53.940]  Mm, mm, mm.
[2:26:53.940 --> 2:26:54.940]  Yeah.
[2:26:54.940 --> 2:26:58.940]  So people don't know who Soros is.
[2:26:58.940 --> 2:27:07.940]  And I think they need to do a good look into who he is and his work in foreign countries
[2:27:07.940 --> 2:27:14.940]  and how he came into his riches, how this man understands and manipulates markets.
[2:27:14.940 --> 2:27:21.940]  Then we have to take a look at and audit all the organizations that open society funds,
[2:27:21.940 --> 2:27:23.940]  women's organizations.
[2:27:23.940 --> 2:27:27.940]  They fund Planned Parenthood and Black Lives Matter.
[2:27:27.940 --> 2:27:36.940]  Two institutions that profit or profiteer off of black struggle or black problems.
[2:27:36.940 --> 2:27:38.940]  These two organizations get paid off of.
[2:27:38.940 --> 2:27:41.940]  We know last week what happened.
[2:27:41.940 --> 2:27:46.940]  Planned Parenthood was some people were forced to testify on the oath.
[2:27:46.940 --> 2:27:51.940]  Come to find out they were in fact telling baby part.
[2:27:51.940 --> 2:27:56.940]  These people are selling dead babies.
[2:27:56.940 --> 2:27:59.940]  If that's not satanic, I don't know what is.
[2:27:59.940 --> 2:28:05.940]  And these are the people that pop up these protests.
[2:28:05.940 --> 2:28:12.940]  When we see these protests happen like that, you got to know Soros is lurking somewhere in the shadows.
[2:28:12.940 --> 2:28:17.940]  You have to because to organize that many people globally and that fast.
[2:28:17.940 --> 2:28:19.940]  Oh, it's quite difficult.
[2:28:19.940 --> 2:28:32.940]  But when you when you donate to close to 100 nonprofit organizations and movements like Planned Parenthood and women's organizations and.
[2:28:32.940 --> 2:28:35.940]  In fact, I retweeted it earlier.
[2:28:35.940 --> 2:28:45.940]  There's a list of there's a list of organizations that are right on my Twitter feed that are funded by Soros and open society.
[2:28:45.940 --> 2:28:56.940]  So when I say that black people are literally controlled by the white liberal or the white socialist or the white communist or whatever they cloak themselves under.
[2:28:56.940 --> 2:28:57.940]  This is true.
[2:28:57.940 --> 2:29:04.940]  Not only that, but the same people also fund Antifa.
[2:29:04.940 --> 2:29:06.940]  Antifa is also also funded.
[2:29:06.940 --> 2:29:10.940]  The rag media matters is funded by these people.
[2:29:10.940 --> 2:29:15.940]  The shadow Democratic Party is a shadow Democratic Party.
[2:29:15.940 --> 2:29:20.940]  The Democratic Party is funded by open Soros.
[2:29:20.940 --> 2:29:28.940]  So we have people who, for example, a lot of people with the riots this past weekend.
[2:29:28.940 --> 2:29:36.940]  We know the governors have come out and said that, you know, one governor said in Minneapolis, I believe 95% of the people that were arrested were from out of town.
[2:29:36.940 --> 2:29:39.940]  Soros and his band of goons of Antifa.
[2:29:39.940 --> 2:29:46.940]  And you got people that donate to some bailout fund to bail out protested.
[2:29:46.940 --> 2:29:52.940]  So basically what you're doing is you're bailing out the criminals to destroy the black community.
[2:29:52.940 --> 2:30:00.940]  This is what happens when you're ill informed, when you're not up to date on the information that's available.
[2:30:00.940 --> 2:30:07.940]  When you cover your eyes and cover your ears at the sight and sound of Alex Jones or the name of Donald Trump.
[2:30:07.940 --> 2:30:11.940]  You are blinding yourself to some facts.
[2:30:11.940 --> 2:30:21.940]  You see, if you're looking at the Republican Party with a microscope, you also have to look at the Democratic Party with a microscope.
[2:30:21.940 --> 2:30:26.940]  And I believe that many conservatives have done a great job exposing the Democratic Party.
[2:30:26.940 --> 2:30:30.940]  But it seems like when people see those things, they go, oh, it's associated with Trump.
[2:30:30.940 --> 2:30:32.940]  So I don't want to hear it.
[2:30:32.940 --> 2:30:34.940]  They don't want to deal with the facts.
[2:30:34.940 --> 2:30:41.940]  But facts say Antifa Black Lives Matter, Planned Parenthood are all funded by the same white liberal.
[2:30:41.940 --> 2:30:45.940]  None of these organizations are independent of George Soros.
[2:30:45.940 --> 2:30:53.940]  And when the police captain in St. Louis got killed, David Dorn, nobody even covered it as he laid there dying.
[2:30:53.940 --> 2:30:59.940]  And none of the Hollywood people gave any money to him or for his funeral or his family because he didn't count.
[2:30:59.940 --> 2:31:04.940]  In fact, for all the people that have been killed, the Hollywood folks aren't doing a damn thing.
[2:31:04.940 --> 2:31:06.940]  You can't monetize his death.
[2:31:06.940 --> 2:31:09.940]  You cannot monetize his death.
[2:31:09.940 --> 2:31:12.940]  You have, first of all, you got a double Trump card.
[2:31:12.940 --> 2:31:16.940]  He's a, he's black, but he's a cop.
[2:31:16.940 --> 2:31:20.940]  So you definitely can't monetize that.
[2:31:20.940 --> 2:31:22.940]  You definitely can't monetize that.
[2:31:22.940 --> 2:31:26.940]  And a little left teaches black people, oh, don't have your own police and fire department run your own community.
[2:31:26.940 --> 2:31:28.940]  Those people are sellouts.
[2:31:28.940 --> 2:31:31.940]  That's how you make sure you run the local tabularies.
[2:31:31.940 --> 2:31:32.940]  So you're in charge.
[2:31:32.940 --> 2:31:34.940]  But again, they teach you, oh, no, don't be part of the system.
[2:31:34.940 --> 2:31:36.940]  You just stay right there and take your welfare check.
[2:31:36.940 --> 2:31:39.940]  That is so obviously just a modern form of slavery.
[2:31:39.940 --> 2:31:41.940]  It's so cynical.
[2:31:41.940 --> 2:31:52.940]  Yeah, I think the institution of policing is inherently communist, but to pass judgment upon individuals that are on the police force is wholly unfair.
[2:31:52.940 --> 2:31:56.940]  I know police officers, black police officers.
[2:31:56.940 --> 2:32:00.940]  At least one black police officer saved my life.
[2:32:00.940 --> 2:32:02.940]  At least twice.
[2:32:02.940 --> 2:32:04.940]  At least twice.
[2:32:04.940 --> 2:32:10.940]  Because his mother went to the same church as my grandmother and he knew me from a very little boy.
[2:32:10.940 --> 2:32:14.940]  I know several police officers are Peter, my best friend's dad.
[2:32:14.940 --> 2:32:15.940]  He was a police officer.
[2:32:15.940 --> 2:32:19.940]  He was a great police officer here in New Jersey.
[2:32:19.940 --> 2:32:27.940]  The system's inherently has problems and is corrupt, but you don't judge people by the whole system. You judge it by individualism, which is common sense.
[2:32:27.940 --> 2:32:29.940]  Yes, this is common sense.
[2:32:29.940 --> 2:32:36.940]  But when you're controlled by PAV laws conditioning, you got to throw, you know, like Lil Wayne said.
[2:32:36.940 --> 2:32:48.940]  He said, you cannot look at these police incidents and just say all cops are bad because what happens is the police officer that was implicated in the murder of Tamair Rice
[2:32:48.940 --> 2:32:51.940]  and his other bodies, none of them have been incarcerated.
[2:32:51.940 --> 2:32:53.940]  Sean King has done a poor job.
[2:32:53.940 --> 2:32:54.940]  He's like 0 and 5.
[2:32:54.940 --> 2:32:55.940]  He's 0 and 5.
[2:32:55.940 --> 2:32:56.940]  These cops are still on the force.
[2:32:56.940 --> 2:32:57.940]  Why?
[2:32:57.940 --> 2:33:05.940]  Because you try to make this about all cops instead of the individual cops that made these infractions, that murdered somebody.
[2:33:05.940 --> 2:33:07.940]  Because why?
[2:33:07.940 --> 2:33:14.940]  That's the only way the media and their band of useful idiots can monetize this stuff and gain clout tokens.
[2:33:14.940 --> 2:33:20.940]  One really good point is that's how you stop real reform happening is you just making about, oh, all cops did this, well, then all cops go, I didn't do that.
[2:33:20.940 --> 2:33:22.940]  Instead of like this one guy.
[2:33:22.940 --> 2:33:24.940]  I mean, there are doctors that cut off the wrong leg.
[2:33:24.940 --> 2:33:25.940]  You don't blame all doctors.
[2:33:25.940 --> 2:33:27.940]  Obviously what those cops did in Minnesota is crazy.
[2:33:27.940 --> 2:33:33.940]  I want to ask you what you really think is going on there because there's some suspicious how they all know each other and that cop's got to know what he's doing.
[2:33:33.940 --> 2:33:35.940]  Something doesn't add up.
[2:33:35.940 --> 2:33:36.940]  I haven't figured it out yet.
[2:33:36.940 --> 2:33:39.940]  We'll see if Hotel Jesus has got an answer and your calls are coming up too.
[2:33:39.940 --> 2:33:52.940]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[2:33:52.940 --> 2:33:57.940]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[2:33:57.940 --> 2:34:08.940]  Super male vitality, specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[2:34:08.940 --> 2:34:19.940]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[2:34:19.940 --> 2:34:32.940]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[2:34:32.940 --> 2:34:33.940]  So what are you waiting for?
[2:34:33.940 --> 2:34:38.940]  Go to the N4 store, never been a better time than right now.
[2:34:38.940 --> 2:34:42.940]  Super male vitality at N4store.com.
[2:34:42.940 --> 2:34:52.940]  I had told listeners back in December that I would never go to 50% off again because our markup isn't big enough selling the products to be able to fund ourselves doing that.
[2:34:52.940 --> 2:34:54.940]  But I got to tell you, things are so crazy.
[2:34:54.940 --> 2:34:55.940]  The world is so insane.
[2:34:55.940 --> 2:35:04.940]  My gut level instinct is sell out everything we've got in the warehouse to make sure we can stay on air through the election in 150 days.
[2:35:04.940 --> 2:35:07.940]  Because we only got money to operate a few months right now.
[2:35:07.940 --> 2:35:09.940]  So these are great products you and your family need.
[2:35:09.940 --> 2:35:12.940]  It funds the M4, get them all now.

[2:35:30.940 --> 2:35:32.940]  Some of these are 70% off.
[2:35:32.940 --> 2:35:33.940]  Biggest sale ever.
[2:35:33.940 --> 2:35:37.940]  N4store.com, N4store.com.
[2:35:37.940 --> 2:35:39.940]  60% off is the average sale.
[2:35:39.940 --> 2:35:41.940]  Take advantage now and fund the N4.
[2:35:43.940 --> 2:35:46.940]  I'm always excited about N4's live products.
[2:35:46.940 --> 2:35:47.940]  They're amazing.
[2:35:47.940 --> 2:35:48.940]  They're cutting edge.
[2:35:48.940 --> 2:35:49.940]  You love them.
[2:35:49.940 --> 2:35:50.940]  I love them.
[2:35:50.940 --> 2:35:52.940]  And they fund the N4 in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[2:35:52.940 --> 2:35:54.940]  But we have come up with a new product.
[2:35:54.940 --> 2:35:58.940]  Over a year in development, that is amazing.
[2:35:58.940 --> 2:36:02.940]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market
[2:36:02.940 --> 2:36:06.940]  with organic essential oils on top of it.
[2:36:06.940 --> 2:36:08.940]  And there's another innovation.
[2:36:08.940 --> 2:36:10.940]  It's the spray cap.
[2:36:10.940 --> 2:36:14.940]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo,
[2:36:14.940 --> 2:36:16.940]  but it's high quality.
[2:36:16.940 --> 2:36:18.940]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[2:36:18.940 --> 2:36:21.940]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[2:36:21.940 --> 2:36:24.940]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes.
[2:36:24.940 --> 2:36:26.940]  But I just love it, personally,
[2:36:26.940 --> 2:36:28.940]  as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[2:36:28.940 --> 2:36:30.940]  So, this is a real innovation.
[2:36:30.940 --> 2:36:32.940]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out
[2:36:32.940 --> 2:36:35.940]  with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it,
[2:36:35.940 --> 2:36:38.940]  so it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[2:36:38.940 --> 2:36:40.940]  It's so refreshing.
[2:36:40.940 --> 2:36:52.940]  This is a big winner.
[2:37:11.940 --> 2:37:14.940]  So, why was your X3...
[2:37:14.940 --> 2:37:16.940]  DNA was blue,
[2:37:16.940 --> 2:37:18.940]  leaving the fence in terrible force.
[2:37:18.940 --> 2:37:20.940]  X3 available as well.
[2:37:20.940 --> 2:37:23.940]  Listen to me, dirty Americans.
[2:37:23.940 --> 2:37:28.940]  Do not go to InfowarsStore.com for 60% off flash sale.
[2:37:28.940 --> 2:37:30.940]  You go bankrupt and die.
[2:37:30.940 --> 2:37:32.940]  You have no speech.
[2:37:32.940 --> 2:37:34.940]  Infowars is weak.
[2:37:34.940 --> 2:37:37.940]  Do not take advantage of 60% off.
[2:37:37.940 --> 2:37:41.940]  GG Pinkzays, oh, oh, we hurt you.
[2:37:41.940 --> 2:38:08.940]  Thank you for watching.
[2:38:11.940 --> 2:38:13.940]  This is going viral everywhere.
[2:38:13.940 --> 2:38:15.940]  Black lives matter.
[2:38:15.940 --> 2:38:17.940]  Like saying your teaching is one that your kid,
[2:38:17.940 --> 2:38:19.940]  because of the color they are,
[2:38:19.940 --> 2:38:21.940]  is somehow privileged or bad.
[2:38:21.940 --> 2:38:23.940]  It's insane.
[2:38:23.940 --> 2:38:26.940]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the stuff of the breakdown of society,
[2:38:26.940 --> 2:38:28.940]  because they're taking all of our rights, all of our freedoms,
[2:38:28.940 --> 2:38:31.940]  all of our health, coming with forced inoculations.
[2:38:31.940 --> 2:38:33.940]  They're coming after everybody, so they want to teach you, though,
[2:38:33.940 --> 2:38:36.940]  that, oh, it's not GG Pink and the 3 million Muslims
[2:38:36.940 --> 2:38:38.940]  in slave camps that's bad,
[2:38:38.940 --> 2:38:40.940]  because I don't like radical Islam, I'm taking over, folks,
[2:38:40.940 --> 2:38:42.940]  but I sure don't want to put Muslims in camps.
[2:38:42.940 --> 2:38:44.940]  Oh, but that's okay, because, you know, they're communists,
[2:38:44.940 --> 2:38:46.940]  so it's okay.
[2:38:46.940 --> 2:38:48.940]  This is totally dangerous,
[2:38:48.940 --> 2:38:50.940]  and I already played the clip earlier for HoTep Joint
[2:38:50.940 --> 2:38:54.940]  as a CNN going, we need to teach white children they're bad.
[2:38:54.940 --> 2:38:56.940]  It's a white dude saying it.
[2:38:56.940 --> 2:38:58.940]  These people know what they're doing.
[2:38:58.940 --> 2:39:00.940]  It's a sick formula.
[2:39:00.940 --> 2:39:02.940]  Here's a clip from the mid-1990s,
[2:39:02.940 --> 2:39:04.940]  First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton with George,
[2:39:04.940 --> 2:39:06.940]  the true Nazi sympathizer Soros,
[2:39:06.940 --> 2:39:08.940]  where he makes a sick joke about,
[2:39:08.940 --> 2:39:10.940]  you better get involved in politics.
[2:39:10.940 --> 2:39:12.940]  That's like a wolf saying you better get involved,
[2:39:12.940 --> 2:39:14.940]  you know, hunting sheep. Here it is.
[2:39:14.940 --> 2:39:16.940]  It is not enough
[2:39:16.940 --> 2:39:18.940]  for America's future
[2:39:20.940 --> 2:39:22.940]  that some participate and others don't.
[2:39:22.940 --> 2:39:24.940]  We have been given
[2:39:24.940 --> 2:39:26.940]  an extraordinary blessing,
[2:39:26.940 --> 2:39:28.940]  and at this moment in time,
[2:39:28.940 --> 2:39:30.940]  our country needs us.
[2:39:32.940 --> 2:39:34.940]  And we need people
[2:39:34.940 --> 2:39:36.940]  like George Soros,
[2:39:36.940 --> 2:39:38.940]  who is fearless
[2:39:38.940 --> 2:39:40.940]  and willing to step up
[2:39:40.940 --> 2:39:42.940]  when it counts.
[2:39:42.940 --> 2:39:44.940]  So please join me in welcoming George Soros.
[2:39:46.940 --> 2:39:48.940]  You talk about a Nazi,
[2:39:48.940 --> 2:39:50.940]  just as close as you can get.
[2:39:52.940 --> 2:39:54.940]  And he funds the whole thing.
[2:39:54.940 --> 2:39:56.940]  It is the first time
[2:39:56.940 --> 2:39:58.940]  that I feel that
[2:39:58.940 --> 2:40:00.940]  I need to stand up
[2:40:00.940 --> 2:40:02.940]  and do something
[2:40:02.940 --> 2:40:04.940]  really
[2:40:04.940 --> 2:40:06.940]  and become
[2:40:06.940 --> 2:40:08.940]  really engaged
[2:40:08.940 --> 2:40:10.940]  in the
[2:40:10.940 --> 2:40:12.940]  electoral process
[2:40:12.940 --> 2:40:14.940]  in this country.
[2:40:14.940 --> 2:40:16.940]  He has always been involved.
[2:40:16.940 --> 2:40:18.940]  Everything that comes out of scrotum faces,
[2:40:18.940 --> 2:40:20.940]  mouth is a lie, Hotep.
[2:40:22.940 --> 2:40:24.940]  Let's talk about the children.
[2:40:24.940 --> 2:40:26.940]  I saw a clip of
[2:40:26.940 --> 2:40:28.940]  a little black girl at the protest,
[2:40:28.940 --> 2:40:30.940]  and she got her fist up,
[2:40:30.940 --> 2:40:32.940]  and she looks angry and upset.
[2:40:32.940 --> 2:40:34.940]  I saw that little white girl,
[2:40:34.940 --> 2:40:36.940]  and I think that's embarrassing
[2:40:36.940 --> 2:40:38.940]  that we're doing this.
[2:40:38.940 --> 2:40:40.940]  First of all, the antics that have been going
[2:40:40.940 --> 2:40:42.940]  across America this week,
[2:40:42.940 --> 2:40:44.940]  I haven't even told my children about.
[2:40:44.940 --> 2:40:46.940]  I don't think I want to tell them,
[2:40:46.940 --> 2:40:48.940]  because I think it's quite embarrassing as adults
[2:40:48.940 --> 2:40:50.940]  that we have to sit here and watch adults act like this.
[2:40:50.940 --> 2:40:52.940]  You just said it. They're pawns.
[2:40:52.940 --> 2:40:54.940]  Even if this was a real fight,
[2:40:54.940 --> 2:40:56.940]  you don't bring kids to a battle,
[2:40:56.940 --> 2:40:58.940]  and that's what people are doing.
[2:40:58.940 --> 2:41:00.940]  People are exploiting their children.
[2:41:00.940 --> 2:41:02.940]  Kids out of this nonsense.
[2:41:02.940 --> 2:41:04.940]  They need to be
[2:41:04.940 --> 2:41:06.940]  working on STEM,
[2:41:06.940 --> 2:41:08.940]  or hitting the books, or doing some art.
[2:41:08.940 --> 2:41:10.940]  Something else, something that's going to educate them.
[2:41:10.940 --> 2:41:12.940]  My 12-year-old daughter
[2:41:12.940 --> 2:41:14.940]  asked me yesterday morning
[2:41:14.940 --> 2:41:16.940]  to try to keep her out of all the rest of,
[2:41:16.940 --> 2:41:18.940]  she said, are white people bad?
[2:41:18.940 --> 2:41:20.940]  Are we bad?
[2:41:20.940 --> 2:41:22.940]  And I said, honey, that's a total lie.
[2:41:22.940 --> 2:41:24.940]  That's all politics.
[2:41:24.940 --> 2:41:26.940]  She goes, but are we doing bad things?
[2:41:26.940 --> 2:41:28.940]  And I said, have you done something bad to somebody?
[2:41:28.940 --> 2:41:30.940]  It's about who you are.
[2:41:30.940 --> 2:41:32.940]  But trying to explain it makes me get really pissed.
[2:41:32.940 --> 2:41:34.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:41:34.940 --> 2:41:36.940]  What would you say to my 12-year-old daughter
[2:41:36.940 --> 2:41:38.940]  asking, is she bad because she's white?
[2:41:40.940 --> 2:41:42.940]  I would tell her,
[2:41:42.940 --> 2:41:44.940]  I would have to explain to her
[2:41:44.940 --> 2:41:46.940]  the media industrial complex.
[2:41:46.940 --> 2:41:48.940]  That's what I would do.
[2:41:48.940 --> 2:41:50.940]  I would break down the media industrial complex
[2:41:50.940 --> 2:41:52.940]  and how we can make people
[2:41:52.940 --> 2:41:54.940]  believe all sorts of silly things.
[2:41:54.940 --> 2:41:56.940]  And then I'd tell her, no, sweetie,
[2:41:56.940 --> 2:41:58.940]  you are an individual.
[2:41:58.940 --> 2:42:00.940]  You are not described by others.
[2:42:00.940 --> 2:42:02.940]  You are described by your actions
[2:42:02.940 --> 2:42:04.940]  and how you live in this world.
[2:42:04.940 --> 2:42:06.940]  That's what I would tell her.
[2:42:06.940 --> 2:42:08.940]  In short.
[2:42:08.940 --> 2:42:10.940]  Well, I hate to go back to Martin Luther King every five minutes,
[2:42:10.940 --> 2:42:12.940]  but it's true. The whole idea is
[2:42:12.940 --> 2:42:14.940]  you judge people off who they are,
[2:42:14.940 --> 2:42:16.940]  which we all know. You judge somebody off their music,
[2:42:16.940 --> 2:42:18.940]  how good it is, how good the food is,
[2:42:18.940 --> 2:42:20.940]  how much fun they are, how funny they are,
[2:42:20.940 --> 2:42:22.940]  how good of plants they can grow.
[2:42:22.940 --> 2:42:24.940]  I mean, everybody knows you judge people off
[2:42:24.940 --> 2:42:26.940]  what they actually do, so then how
[2:42:26.940 --> 2:42:28.940]  is the left pushing this truly
[2:42:28.940 --> 2:42:30.940]  anti-human, fascist, satanic
[2:42:30.940 --> 2:42:32.940]  ideology and thinking
[2:42:32.940 --> 2:42:34.940]  they're the good guys? I mean, because I want to
[2:42:34.940 --> 2:42:36.940]  really slap these leftists upside the head
[2:42:36.940 --> 2:42:38.940]  when I see them bringing their kids to these demonstrations.
[2:42:38.940 --> 2:42:40.940]  If we were to be objective
[2:42:40.940 --> 2:42:42.940]  about the treatment
[2:42:42.940 --> 2:42:44.940]  of black people
[2:42:44.940 --> 2:42:46.940]  across the globe,
[2:42:46.940 --> 2:42:48.940]  I think white people would come
[2:42:48.940 --> 2:42:50.940]  last.
[2:42:50.940 --> 2:42:52.940]  We can look at
[2:42:52.940 --> 2:42:54.940]  ethnic cleansing in
[2:42:54.940 --> 2:42:56.940]  Argentina.
[2:42:56.940 --> 2:42:58.940]  We can look at ethnic cleansing in Brazil.
[2:42:58.940 --> 2:43:00.940]  We can look at ethnic cleansing
[2:43:00.940 --> 2:43:02.940]  in the Arab world.
[2:43:02.940 --> 2:43:04.940]  I'd much rather be
[2:43:04.940 --> 2:43:06.940]  a black person under white rule
[2:43:06.940 --> 2:43:08.940]  than a black person under
[2:43:08.940 --> 2:43:10.940]  Arab rule.
[2:43:10.940 --> 2:43:12.940]  Ten times over.
[2:43:12.940 --> 2:43:14.940]  Under Chinese rule.
[2:43:14.940 --> 2:43:16.940]  We look at how Chinese, it's still 1950.
[2:43:16.940 --> 2:43:18.940]  You have some places to say this is Chinese only.
[2:43:18.940 --> 2:43:20.940]  This is Chinese only.
[2:43:20.940 --> 2:43:22.940]  Some people say, white people,
[2:43:22.940 --> 2:43:24.940]  I'm like, you don't really understand this whole world.
[2:43:24.940 --> 2:43:26.940]  You're giving white people a little bit too much credit.
[2:43:26.940 --> 2:43:28.940]  Is that because Americans don't travel
[2:43:28.940 --> 2:43:30.940]  because we take Japan? I think it's Japanese either.
[2:43:30.940 --> 2:43:32.940]  They still, because they hate Chinese so much,
[2:43:32.940 --> 2:43:34.940]  have restaurants that say no Chinese allowed.
[2:43:34.940 --> 2:43:36.940]  You got some dogs
[2:43:36.940 --> 2:43:38.940]  that are conditioned, some dogs
[2:43:38.940 --> 2:43:40.940]  that are unconditioned. Some dogs have been conditioned
[2:43:40.940 --> 2:43:42.940]  by path loss conditioning
[2:43:42.940 --> 2:43:44.940]  and some people haven't been exposed
[2:43:44.940 --> 2:43:46.940]  to the experiment. Hotets, we haven't been exposed
[2:43:46.940 --> 2:43:48.940]  to the experiment. We're aware that when they ring the bell
[2:43:48.940 --> 2:43:50.940]  they want us to salivate.
[2:43:50.940 --> 2:43:52.940]  Others, well, they're going to have
[2:43:52.940 --> 2:43:54.940]  program responses. That's key.
[2:43:54.940 --> 2:43:56.940]  When they ring the bell, don't salivate.
[2:43:56.940 --> 2:43:58.940]  That's as important as the term red pill, blue pill.
[2:43:58.940 --> 2:44:00.940]  So for those that don't know, tell people what a hotep is.
[2:44:00.940 --> 2:44:02.940]  A hotep is
[2:44:02.940 --> 2:44:04.940]  an individual who understands
[2:44:04.940 --> 2:44:06.940]  our world
[2:44:06.940 --> 2:44:08.940]  in a very 360 degree fashion.
[2:44:08.940 --> 2:44:10.940]  So some people might say it's a religion
[2:44:10.940 --> 2:44:12.940]  or it's a political party.
[2:44:12.940 --> 2:44:14.940]  No, I mean, there's probably
[2:44:14.940 --> 2:44:16.940]  the three basic acts
[2:44:16.940 --> 2:44:18.940]  of
[2:44:18.940 --> 2:44:20.940]  aspects of hotep is mind, body, and soul.
[2:44:20.940 --> 2:44:22.940]  We believe in a higher power.
[2:44:22.940 --> 2:44:24.940]  We believe
[2:44:24.940 --> 2:44:26.940]  in having a healthy body,
[2:44:26.940 --> 2:44:28.940]  having a healthy food supply.
[2:44:28.940 --> 2:44:30.940]  And we believe
[2:44:30.940 --> 2:44:32.940]  in education
[2:44:32.940 --> 2:44:34.940]  and educating yourself.
[2:44:34.940 --> 2:44:36.940]  But we are aware of the traps
[2:44:36.940 --> 2:44:38.940]  that are set for us
[2:44:38.940 --> 2:44:40.940]  by the oligarchs and the plutocracy.
[2:44:40.940 --> 2:44:42.940]  We are
[2:44:42.940 --> 2:44:44.940]  the mind of the black community.
[2:44:44.940 --> 2:44:46.940]  Every ounce
[2:44:46.940 --> 2:44:48.940]  of black education
[2:44:48.940 --> 2:44:50.940]  outside of the liberal fed education
[2:44:50.940 --> 2:44:52.940]  that the black community has,
[2:44:52.940 --> 2:44:54.940]  every ounce of self-knowledge
[2:44:54.940 --> 2:44:56.940]  has come from a hotep.
[2:44:56.940 --> 2:44:58.940]  Whether it were
[2:44:58.940 --> 2:45:00.940]  Marcus Garvey, Kabba Kaminé,
[2:45:00.940 --> 2:45:02.940]  or Shaka.
[2:45:02.940 --> 2:45:04.940]  It doesn't matter. It came from a hotep.
[2:45:04.940 --> 2:45:06.940]  Noble Drew Ali,
[2:45:06.940 --> 2:45:08.940]  Harvey Spencer Lewis, whoever it was,
[2:45:08.940 --> 2:45:10.940]  it came from somebody who was hotep.
[2:45:10.940 --> 2:45:12.940]  And we are the
[2:45:12.940 --> 2:45:14.940]  consciousness of the black community.
[2:45:14.940 --> 2:45:16.940]  The unconsciousness of the black communities
[2:45:16.940 --> 2:45:18.940]  of foolishness you see on TV that's purported
[2:45:18.940 --> 2:45:20.940]  by the white liberals and the movies
[2:45:20.940 --> 2:45:22.940]  and the record labels.
[2:45:24.940 --> 2:45:26.940]  If you look at
[2:45:26.940 --> 2:45:28.940]  old school Tupac Shakur,
[2:45:28.940 --> 2:45:30.940]  look at his pictures with digital underground
[2:45:30.940 --> 2:45:32.940]  when he had the Kente Klaw
[2:45:32.940 --> 2:45:34.940]  and he donned the Kente Klaw
[2:45:34.940 --> 2:45:36.940]  and he donned the Kufi.
[2:45:36.940 --> 2:45:38.940]  At one point, the black community
[2:45:38.940 --> 2:45:40.940]  was hotep
[2:45:40.940 --> 2:45:42.940]  and somehow,
[2:45:42.940 --> 2:45:44.940]  some way, the white liberal was able
[2:45:44.940 --> 2:45:46.940]  to convince us that the better thing
[2:45:46.940 --> 2:45:48.940]  to do was to push gangster rap
[2:45:48.940 --> 2:45:50.940]  and consumerism.
[2:45:50.940 --> 2:45:52.940]  And we went from being people
[2:45:52.940 --> 2:45:54.940]  who had their own brands and their own culture
[2:45:54.940 --> 2:45:56.940]  to being pimps.
[2:45:56.940 --> 2:45:58.940]  To being pimped out.
[2:45:58.940 --> 2:46:00.940]  To branch.
[2:46:00.940 --> 2:46:02.940]  LVMH.
[2:46:02.940 --> 2:46:04.940]  So on and so forth.
[2:46:04.940 --> 2:46:06.940]  Well, Hochab, I didn't know you were going to do that.
[2:46:06.940 --> 2:46:08.940]  But you just hit the nail on the head.
[2:46:08.940 --> 2:46:10.940]  And you're out today
[2:46:10.940 --> 2:46:12.940]  and ask the listeners, what do you allegorically
[2:46:12.940 --> 2:46:14.940]  think this symbolizes?
[2:46:14.940 --> 2:46:16.940]  Because people love esoteric
[2:46:16.940 --> 2:46:18.940]  instead of things being right up front.
[2:46:18.940 --> 2:46:20.940]  And that's my answer for the chess board
[2:46:20.940 --> 2:46:22.940]  is if we don't pull back and see the whole game,
[2:46:22.940 --> 2:46:24.940]  don't play the game,
[2:46:24.940 --> 2:46:26.940]  but 360 see the whole game,
[2:46:26.940 --> 2:46:28.940]  then we can remove the death out of our culture
[2:46:28.940 --> 2:46:30.940]  that's designed to destroy true thinking
[2:46:30.940 --> 2:46:32.940]  and then we can start flourishing
[2:46:32.940 --> 2:46:34.940]  and have a future
[2:46:34.940 --> 2:46:36.940]  for black, white, everybody together.
[2:46:36.940 --> 2:46:38.940]  We still have competition, we'll still have a game,
[2:46:38.940 --> 2:46:40.940]  but it'll be better for everybody
[2:46:40.940 --> 2:46:42.940]  to boost empowerment
[2:46:42.940 --> 2:46:44.940]  instead of boosting deception
[2:46:44.940 --> 2:46:46.940]  and the knowledge of evil,
[2:46:46.940 --> 2:46:48.940]  we need the knowledge of good, which we've forgotten.
[2:46:48.940 --> 2:46:50.940]  And that was the allegory of the day
[2:46:50.940 --> 2:46:52.940]  and I'm glad you answered the question.
[2:46:52.940 --> 2:46:54.940]  Yes, I love that.
[2:46:54.940 --> 2:46:56.940]  I play chess myself
[2:46:56.940 --> 2:46:58.940]  and I love that allegory.
[2:46:58.940 --> 2:47:00.940]  We have not enough bishops,
[2:47:00.940 --> 2:47:02.940]  not enough knights, not enough kings,
[2:47:02.940 --> 2:47:04.940]  not enough queens.
[2:47:04.940 --> 2:47:06.940]  The chess board is flooded with pawns
[2:47:06.940 --> 2:47:08.940]  and the problem is...
[2:47:08.940 --> 2:47:10.940]  I was going to say that too,
[2:47:10.940 --> 2:47:12.940]  that's what I meant this morning,
[2:47:12.940 --> 2:47:14.940]  was don't be a pawn, folks, pull back
[2:47:14.940 --> 2:47:16.940]  and then you will be one of the main players.
[2:47:16.940 --> 2:47:18.940]  Only by seeing the full board do you get it?
[2:47:18.940 --> 2:47:20.940]  Because imagine if he's right down here
[2:47:20.940 --> 2:47:22.940]  as a pawn, he can't even see five feet.
[2:47:22.940 --> 2:47:24.940]  But if you pull back from the whole thing,
[2:47:24.940 --> 2:47:26.940]  it's so simple and study the manipulation,
[2:47:26.940 --> 2:47:28.940]  then they can't control you as easy.
[2:47:28.940 --> 2:47:30.940]  Yeah, you got to pull back
[2:47:30.940 --> 2:47:32.940]  and see everything as a whole,
[2:47:32.940 --> 2:47:34.940]  you know, a lot of people are haughton,
[2:47:34.940 --> 2:47:36.940]  mifflin, educated.
[2:47:36.940 --> 2:47:38.940]  They're educated by the public school system,
[2:47:38.940 --> 2:47:40.940]  so they have no sense of even U.S. history,
[2:47:40.940 --> 2:47:42.940]  let alone their own
[2:47:42.940 --> 2:47:44.940]  quote-unquote black history.
[2:47:44.940 --> 2:47:46.940]  People don't have a sense of world history.
[2:47:46.940 --> 2:47:48.940]  If you don't know the cycles of the world
[2:47:48.940 --> 2:47:50.940]  and of the nations, how a nation
[2:47:50.940 --> 2:47:52.940]  rise and how a nation falls,
[2:47:52.940 --> 2:47:54.940]  you would never understand the place we live in now.
[2:47:54.940 --> 2:47:56.940]  Let's talk about the cycles of history.
[2:47:56.940 --> 2:47:58.940]  It's been a year since you came on.
[2:47:58.940 --> 2:48:00.940]  I want you to be a regular guest.
[2:48:00.940 --> 2:48:02.940]  Do a special report with us.
[2:48:02.940 --> 2:48:04.940]  Do a two-hour commercial-free podcast.
[2:48:04.940 --> 2:48:06.940]  You want to do it soon?
[2:48:06.940 --> 2:48:08.940]  I'd like to do something really big with you
[2:48:08.940 --> 2:48:10.940]  with Uncle Ho-Tep.
[2:48:10.940 --> 2:48:12.940]  I'd like to do something in-studio
[2:48:12.940 --> 2:48:14.940]  with Uncle Ho-Tep. Let's throw a budget.
[2:48:14.940 --> 2:48:16.940]  Let's do something that creates
[2:48:16.940 --> 2:48:18.940]  some really awesome viral...
[2:48:18.940 --> 2:48:20.940]  I'll tell you what, you name the time.
[2:48:20.940 --> 2:48:22.940]  If you're ready to jump on a plane, please come.
[2:48:22.940 --> 2:48:24.940]  I'll finance it.
[2:48:24.940 --> 2:48:26.940]  Ho-Tep, Ho-TepNation.com.
[2:48:26.940 --> 2:48:28.940]  We love you. We appreciate you.
[2:48:28.940 --> 2:48:30.940]  Our number four. Stay with us.
[2:48:58.940 --> 2:49:01.940]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[2:49:01.940 --> 2:49:03.940]  Just like the history books show us,
[2:49:03.940 --> 2:49:05.940]  just like the Bible states.
[2:49:05.940 --> 2:49:07.940]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil
[2:49:07.940 --> 2:49:09.940]  and turned away from God,
[2:49:09.940 --> 2:49:11.940]  they were brought into captivity
[2:49:11.940 --> 2:49:13.940]  because their people sold out
[2:49:13.940 --> 2:49:16.940]  to special interests and were infiltrated by spies,
[2:49:16.940 --> 2:49:18.940]  and then they were enslaved.
[2:49:18.940 --> 2:49:20.940]  We are repeating that again today.
[2:49:20.940 --> 2:49:22.940]  Compliance and going along with this system
[2:49:22.940 --> 2:49:25.940]  leads to absolute bondage.
[2:49:25.940 --> 2:49:28.940]  Info Wars has decided to fight for freedom.
[2:49:28.940 --> 2:49:30.940]  Info Wars has had great victory
[2:49:30.940 --> 2:49:56.940]  in the history of Israel.
[2:49:56.940 --> 2:50:00.940]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the New World Order,
[2:50:00.940 --> 2:50:02.940]  where they let the criminals out of jail,
[2:50:02.940 --> 2:50:04.940]  the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers,
[2:50:04.940 --> 2:50:08.940]  and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[2:50:08.940 --> 2:50:10.940]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear
[2:50:10.940 --> 2:50:13.940]  the globalists are an authoritarian anti-human group.
[2:50:13.940 --> 2:50:16.940]  They have to put this electronic straightjacket on us
[2:50:16.940 --> 2:50:18.940]  before they carry out their end game,
[2:50:18.940 --> 2:50:20.940]  which is global depopulation.
[2:50:20.940 --> 2:50:24.940]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[2:50:24.940 --> 2:50:27.940]  The only way to stop them is to expose them,
[2:50:27.940 --> 2:50:29.940]  to hate their guts, and realize
[2:50:29.940 --> 2:50:31.940]  they are humanity's mortal enemy.
[2:50:31.940 --> 2:50:35.940]  Wake up or die.
[2:50:35.940 --> 2:50:42.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:50:42.940 --> 2:50:52.940]  Thanks for holding.
[2:50:52.940 --> 2:50:54.940]  Appreciate you all calling in.
[2:50:54.940 --> 2:50:56.940]  I'm going to dial into every caller in the two seconds
[2:50:56.940 --> 2:50:57.940]  we have left.
[2:50:57.940 --> 2:50:59.940]  Let's talk to Greg and then Aaron.
[2:50:59.940 --> 2:51:01.940]  Greg in Iowa, thanks for holding.
[2:51:01.940 --> 2:51:03.940]  So your former law enforcement and vet,
[2:51:03.940 --> 2:51:04.940]  you're on the air.
[2:51:04.940 --> 2:51:05.940]  Go ahead.
[2:51:05.940 --> 2:51:06.940]  What's your view?
[2:51:06.940 --> 2:51:08.940]  This is, Trump's got to drop the hammer.
[2:51:08.940 --> 2:51:10.940]  He's got to stop talking.
[2:51:10.940 --> 2:51:12.940]  He's got to stop talking.
[2:51:12.940 --> 2:51:13.940]  He's got to stop talking.
[2:51:13.940 --> 2:51:15.940]  They have to drop the hammer.
[2:51:15.940 --> 2:51:17.940]  Those commanders of the National Guard have to be removed
[2:51:17.940 --> 2:51:19.940]  immediately for cause.
[2:51:19.940 --> 2:51:21.940]  They have dropped their oath.
[2:51:21.940 --> 2:51:27.940]  Allowing their soldiers to take a knee is unspeakable.
[2:51:27.940 --> 2:51:30.940]  As a former veteran is unspeakable.
[2:51:30.940 --> 2:51:33.940]  Isn't that the same as handing somebody the flag?
[2:51:33.940 --> 2:51:34.940]  Yes.
[2:51:34.940 --> 2:51:35.940]  They surrendered.
[2:51:35.940 --> 2:51:37.940]  They surrendered their position.
[2:51:37.940 --> 2:51:39.940]  They might as well just handed over their weapons.
[2:51:39.940 --> 2:51:41.940]  You don't do that.
[2:51:41.940 --> 2:51:43.940]  I mean, what would these guys do if they were actually getting
[2:51:43.940 --> 2:51:44.940]  attacked by an enemy?
[2:51:44.940 --> 2:51:45.940]  This is just pathetic.
[2:51:45.940 --> 2:51:46.940]  It is.
[2:51:46.940 --> 2:51:47.940]  It is.
[2:51:47.940 --> 2:51:49.940]  Because it shows they're not in control of their own mind
[2:51:49.940 --> 2:51:50.940]  or their own orders.
[2:51:50.940 --> 2:51:52.940]  Because they're saying they weren't ordered to do this.
[2:51:52.940 --> 2:51:54.940]  Someone convinced them to do this out there.
[2:51:54.940 --> 2:51:55.940]  Exactly.
[2:51:55.940 --> 2:51:56.940]  Exactly.
[2:51:56.940 --> 2:51:59.940]  That shows no confidence to the people, to the country.
[2:51:59.940 --> 2:52:03.940]  Trump has to, with the secretary of defense,
[2:52:03.940 --> 2:52:06.940]  not to still have in his position that for what he came out
[2:52:06.940 --> 2:52:09.940]  and undermining the president's authority,
[2:52:09.940 --> 2:52:11.940]  the commander-in-chief,
[2:52:11.940 --> 2:52:13.940]  we'll stop calling him the president.
[2:52:13.940 --> 2:52:14.940]  He is the commander-in-chief.
[2:52:14.940 --> 2:52:15.940]  And you know what's happening.
[2:52:15.940 --> 2:52:17.940]  I mean, I told you yesterday,
[2:52:17.940 --> 2:52:19.940]  it's obvious they're making their move on Trump right now.
[2:52:19.940 --> 2:52:21.940]  This is the big one, folks.
[2:52:21.940 --> 2:52:24.940]  And not just drop the hammer on the violent protesters,
[2:52:24.940 --> 2:52:26.940]  they've got to drop the hammer on Hillary and the rest of them.
[2:52:26.940 --> 2:52:28.940]  We don't just need congressional hearings.
[2:52:28.940 --> 2:52:30.940]  We need action now by the executive branch
[2:52:30.940 --> 2:52:32.940]  because these people are working with foreign powers.
[2:52:32.940 --> 2:52:34.940]  People go, Alex, that's a police state.
[2:52:34.940 --> 2:52:37.940]  No, it's not. Letting them lawlessly overthrow the elected government
[2:52:37.940 --> 2:52:39.940]  is going to give us a police state.
[2:52:39.940 --> 2:52:40.940]  Exactly.
[2:52:40.940 --> 2:52:42.940]  Exactly, Alex said.
[2:52:42.940 --> 2:52:46.940]  Second off, as a former law enforcement officer,
[2:52:46.940 --> 2:52:51.940]  my police academy did not ever teach that maneuver.
[2:52:51.940 --> 2:52:56.940]  And the guest you had on the other day was absolutely right.
[2:52:56.940 --> 2:52:58.940]  And once you're placed in handcuffs,
[2:52:58.940 --> 2:53:01.940]  you don't put somebody down on the ground like that.
[2:53:01.940 --> 2:53:04.940]  Place them up so they can breathe.
[2:53:04.940 --> 2:53:06.940]  There's something fishy going on with that.
[2:53:06.940 --> 2:53:08.940]  We don't have all the details.
[2:53:08.940 --> 2:53:10.940]  You're absolutely 100% right on that.
[2:53:10.940 --> 2:53:13.940]  Yet again, yet again, my brother, yet again.
[2:53:13.940 --> 2:53:15.940]  And the hammer's got to drop.
[2:53:15.940 --> 2:53:19.940]  The weakness showed by the DOJ for the last three years
[2:53:19.940 --> 2:53:21.940]  is allowing this.
[2:53:21.940 --> 2:53:25.940]  And these governors need to start being arrested themselves.
[2:53:25.940 --> 2:53:28.940]  Well, Northum literally keeps babies alive
[2:53:28.940 --> 2:53:30.940]  and takes their organs as a doctor.
[2:53:30.940 --> 2:53:33.940]  And he literally is going to try to pull down the Robert E. Lee Statue
[2:53:33.940 --> 2:53:35.940]  to cause an explosion.
[2:53:35.940 --> 2:53:38.940]  I mean, you talk about yelling fire in the theater, this is it.
[2:53:38.940 --> 2:53:40.940]  And he's such a pimp.
[2:53:40.940 --> 2:53:42.940]  I mean, he's such a crook.
[2:53:42.940 --> 2:53:45.940]  I mean, we're going to let this little thug cause a race war?
[2:53:45.940 --> 2:53:46.940]  No.
[2:53:46.940 --> 2:53:48.940]  And that's why the Department of Justice has shown
[2:53:48.940 --> 2:53:50.940]  that they're not a Department of Justice.
[2:53:50.940 --> 2:53:54.940]  They are Department of Lawyers and instigators.
[2:53:54.940 --> 2:53:56.940]  This has got to stop.
[2:53:56.940 --> 2:54:01.940]  And he needs to ask, you got to stop calling it an insurrection
[2:54:01.940 --> 2:54:04.940]  and start treating this as a civil war.
[2:54:04.940 --> 2:54:05.940]  Exactly.
[2:54:05.940 --> 2:54:07.940]  It's not an insurrection directed by a bunch of looters.
[2:54:07.940 --> 2:54:09.940]  It's the media and the mayors.
[2:54:09.940 --> 2:54:11.940]  The Austin mayor came out yesterday and said, this is good
[2:54:11.940 --> 2:54:13.940]  and the police are bad.
[2:54:13.940 --> 2:54:15.940]  We've had our vehicle attacked repeatedly.
[2:54:15.940 --> 2:54:18.940]  We've had, there's just rioting and looting and crime
[2:54:18.940 --> 2:54:20.940]  and people being assaulted.
[2:54:20.940 --> 2:54:22.940]  My son had to protect a clerk from a guy
[2:54:22.940 --> 2:54:25.940]  that jumped over the counter and was trying to kill him.
[2:54:25.940 --> 2:54:28.940]  I mean, it's just rampant crime right now all over the country.
[2:54:28.940 --> 2:54:30.940]  I am in Podunk, Iowa.
[2:54:30.940 --> 2:54:32.940]  We don't even have our roads paved.
[2:54:32.940 --> 2:54:35.940]  We have gravel roads about an hour south of Minnesota.
[2:54:35.940 --> 2:54:39.940]  We have a huge uptick in crime.
[2:54:39.940 --> 2:54:41.940]  Houses being broken into.
[2:54:41.940 --> 2:54:43.940]  People have never had these problems before.
[2:54:43.940 --> 2:54:47.940]  We have a huge influx of unmarked vehicles.
[2:54:47.940 --> 2:54:49.940]  Generally, they're all white.
[2:54:49.940 --> 2:54:51.940]  Generally, brand spanking new.
[2:54:51.940 --> 2:54:54.940]  People that aren't usually from here.
[2:54:54.940 --> 2:54:56.940]  And this is Podunk, Iowa.
[2:54:56.940 --> 2:55:01.940]  And the thing, it's, people are scoping out stuff
[2:55:01.940 --> 2:55:04.940]  in farms and the back roads.
[2:55:04.940 --> 2:55:08.940]  And Trump has got to send a message that it's, that it's over.
[2:55:08.940 --> 2:55:12.940]  And you're not going to do that with words and placating the stuff.
[2:55:12.940 --> 2:55:14.940]  When you said it, there are criminals casing.
[2:55:14.940 --> 2:55:18.940]  I'm seeing casing going on, not just a huge crime increase.
[2:55:18.940 --> 2:55:20.940]  And that's really a big problem.
[2:55:20.940 --> 2:55:22.940]  I tell you, all right, God bless you, Greg.
[2:55:22.940 --> 2:55:23.940]  Thank you for the call.
[2:55:23.940 --> 2:55:25.940]  All right, we got to jam in all five of these calls.
[2:55:25.940 --> 2:55:26.940]  We'll come back.
[2:55:26.940 --> 2:55:27.940]  That gives each caller about two minutes.
[2:55:27.940 --> 2:55:29.940]  Aaron, Duncan, Frank, Reed and Justin,
[2:55:29.940 --> 2:55:30.940]  we're coming right to you.
[2:55:30.940 --> 2:55:32.940]  And then Jason Jones has got a big guest on.
[2:55:32.940 --> 2:55:35.940]  And so much more than Owen Schreuer and the War Room.
[2:55:35.940 --> 2:55:56.940]  Infowars.com.
[2:55:56.940 --> 2:55:57.940]  But because things are so crazy,
[2:55:57.940 --> 2:56:00.940]  I'm offering the biggest sale in our history.
[2:56:00.940 --> 2:56:01.940]  It's a flash sale.
[2:56:01.940 --> 2:56:03.940]  I don't know if it's going to last a day a week,
[2:56:03.940 --> 2:56:06.940]  but we're selling out of all the major products
[2:56:06.940 --> 2:56:09.940]  because I kind of feel like the Titanic is sinking,
[2:56:09.940 --> 2:56:11.940]  and we need to have the funds in our bank account
[2:56:11.940 --> 2:56:13.940]  to fund the Infowar into the future.
[2:56:13.940 --> 2:56:16.940]  So take advantage of the looting, the riding, the death,
[2:56:16.940 --> 2:56:19.940]  and the martial law by getting the best prices ever
[2:56:19.940 --> 2:56:21.940]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:56:21.940 --> 2:56:23.940]  That's 60% off on t-shirts.
[2:56:23.940 --> 2:56:24.940]  That's on books.
[2:56:24.940 --> 2:56:25.940]  That's on films.
[2:56:25.940 --> 2:56:28.940]  That's on all the great supplements like Turbo Force,
[2:56:28.940 --> 2:56:31.940]  Living Defense, DNA Force Plus, and so much more.
[2:56:31.940 --> 2:56:33.940]  The mega flash sale.
[2:56:33.940 --> 2:56:37.940]  60% off to fund the Infowar and save the Republic.
[2:56:37.940 --> 2:56:39.940]  Or get prepared before everything burns down.
[2:56:39.940 --> 2:56:45.940]  InfowarsStore.com.
[2:56:45.940 --> 2:56:47.940]  You found it.
[2:56:47.940 --> 2:56:49.940]  The tip of the spear.
[2:56:49.940 --> 2:56:53.940]  It is the Alex Jones show.
[2:56:53.940 --> 2:56:58.940]  So, folks, it turns out George Floyd had coronavirus
[2:56:58.940 --> 2:57:04.940]  and the autopsy also ended up fitting all on him to kill several people.
[2:57:04.940 --> 2:57:08.940]  Folks, they count every death as coronavirus.
[2:57:08.940 --> 2:57:11.940]  All over the country, in blue states, they count gunshot wounds
[2:57:11.940 --> 2:57:13.940]  and car wrecks as that.
[2:57:13.940 --> 2:57:14.940]  So it's just a giant fraud.
[2:57:14.940 --> 2:57:16.940]  It's totally collapsed.
[2:57:16.940 --> 2:57:18.940]  And all these idiot Democrats are still wearing their masks
[2:57:18.940 --> 2:57:20.940]  because they're never going to stop.
[2:57:20.940 --> 2:57:23.940]  They want the power to put vaccines in you, the power to run your life,
[2:57:23.940 --> 2:57:25.940]  and it better, better stop.
[2:57:25.940 --> 2:57:28.940]  Okay, Aaron in Florida, thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:57:28.940 --> 2:57:29.940]  Welcome.
[2:57:29.940 --> 2:57:31.940]  Yes, sir.
[2:57:31.940 --> 2:57:33.940]  Welcome.
[2:57:33.940 --> 2:57:34.940]  Thank you so much.
[2:57:34.940 --> 2:57:36.940]  I've been listening to you since 9-11.
[2:57:36.940 --> 2:57:38.940]  I'm a veteran, second member supporter.
[2:57:38.940 --> 2:57:40.940]  Your previous caller was awesome.
[2:57:40.940 --> 2:57:42.940]  The military should never deal.
[2:57:42.940 --> 2:57:43.940]  That was the surrender.
[2:57:43.940 --> 2:57:46.940]  Those commanders should be yanked out of there.
[2:57:46.940 --> 2:57:48.940]  We have the tools, Alex.
[2:57:48.940 --> 2:57:49.940]  We have them.
[2:57:49.940 --> 2:57:50.940]  This is an insurrection.
[2:57:50.940 --> 2:57:51.940]  There's still a war.
[2:57:51.940 --> 2:57:54.940]  President Trump can actuate Article 2, Section 2.
[2:57:54.940 --> 2:57:56.940]  He's the commander in chief of the military,
[2:57:56.940 --> 2:57:57.940]  of the militia.
[2:57:57.940 --> 2:57:59.940]  The militia is standing ready.
[2:57:59.940 --> 2:58:02.940]  And what do you make of all these generals in the sec death
[2:58:02.940 --> 2:58:04.940]  all undermining the president?
[2:58:04.940 --> 2:58:05.940]  That's never happened.
[2:58:05.940 --> 2:58:07.940]  Those guys should be stripped.
[2:58:07.940 --> 2:58:08.940]  They should be stripped.
[2:58:08.940 --> 2:58:10.940]  Well, it shows you they're getting ready to make their move on Trump.
[2:58:10.940 --> 2:58:13.940]  I mean, I don't know if Trump understands how dangerous that is.
[2:58:13.940 --> 2:58:14.940]  Exactly right.
[2:58:14.940 --> 2:58:16.940]  Every hair on my body just standing up right now.
[2:58:16.940 --> 2:58:17.940]  You just said that.
[2:58:17.940 --> 2:58:19.940]  The virus lockdown.
[2:58:19.940 --> 2:58:23.940]  We can fight that with U.S. Code Title 18, Section 242,
[2:58:23.940 --> 2:58:26.940]  deprivation of rights on the color of law.
[2:58:26.940 --> 2:58:28.940]  That's how we beat that.
[2:58:28.940 --> 2:58:31.940]  Those guys don't have power over us.
[2:58:31.940 --> 2:58:32.940]  Well, I can feel the danger.
[2:58:32.940 --> 2:58:33.940]  I can see the danger.
[2:58:33.940 --> 2:58:37.940]  And people need to know this isn't the other attempts to take Trump out.
[2:58:37.940 --> 2:58:41.940]  Once they get rid of Trump, they're going to go completely crazy with false flags
[2:58:41.940 --> 2:58:42.940]  to cause a real civil war.
[2:58:42.940 --> 2:58:43.940]  And you're right.
[2:58:43.940 --> 2:58:46.940]  We're in a civil war now, maybe a three out of a 10.
[2:58:46.940 --> 2:58:48.940]  They want to push it all the way, my friend,
[2:58:48.940 --> 2:58:50.940]  because Soros and Hillary and all them,
[2:58:50.940 --> 2:58:52.940]  they think they're going to hide out during this thing.
[2:58:52.940 --> 2:58:53.940]  That's not going to happen.
[2:58:53.940 --> 2:58:56.940]  And speaking of that, Soros and Hillary,
[2:58:56.940 --> 2:58:59.940]  so I've been following your whole show this time,
[2:58:59.940 --> 2:59:04.940]  and I watch on an iPad and a Google Firepad.
[2:59:04.940 --> 2:59:10.940]  You were being banned in real time.
[2:59:10.940 --> 2:59:13.940]  When you had Hotep on there, as soon as he started talking,
[2:59:13.940 --> 2:59:15.940]  they cut your video feed.
[2:59:15.940 --> 2:59:18.940]  I've been on hold listening to the show and watching this.
[2:59:18.940 --> 2:59:22.940]  And it's just a trip how they, anytime you talk about, you know,
[2:59:22.940 --> 2:59:26.940]  Hotep or anytime George Soros comes on, you get banned immediately.
[2:59:26.940 --> 2:59:29.940]  They are now banning stuff at the browser level.
[2:59:29.940 --> 2:59:30.940]  They're banning it over IPs.
[2:59:30.940 --> 2:59:31.940]  They're banning it.
[2:59:31.940 --> 2:59:32.940]  Absolutely.
[2:59:32.940 --> 2:59:33.940]  God bless you.
[2:59:33.940 --> 2:59:34.940]  And then they confirm they're doing it.
[2:59:34.940 --> 2:59:37.940]  They now force feed their Tuesday blackouts over everything.
[2:59:37.940 --> 2:59:38.940]  And then use the cover.
[2:59:38.940 --> 2:59:40.940]  We love black people as a reason to do it.
[2:59:40.940 --> 2:59:43.940]  It's big mega corporations that own slave camps in China.
[2:59:43.940 --> 2:59:44.940]  Nothing to do with black people.
[2:59:44.940 --> 2:59:45.940]  Okay.
[2:59:45.940 --> 2:59:46.940]  Duncan in Idaho.
[2:59:46.940 --> 2:59:47.940]  You're on the air.
[2:59:47.940 --> 2:59:48.940]  Welcome.
[2:59:48.940 --> 2:59:51.940]  Hey, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[2:59:51.940 --> 2:59:54.940]  I just wanted to follow up with what Aaron was saying there.
[2:59:54.940 --> 3:00:00.940]  We have all the authority, our founders, who the God of our fathers inspired,
[3:00:00.940 --> 3:00:05.940]  gave us all the authority in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
[3:00:05.940 --> 3:00:08.940]  1901 Downs versus Bidwell.
[3:00:08.940 --> 3:00:18.940]  That's what's been going on for the last 100 years.
[3:00:18.940 --> 3:00:23.940]  The other to be maintained by Congress outside and independent of that instrument.
[3:00:23.940 --> 3:00:26.940]  And that's what's been going on for the last 100 years.
[3:00:26.940 --> 3:00:28.940]  They're a criminal corporate.
[3:00:28.940 --> 3:00:33.940]  The facto democracy under that gold fringe flag is taken over our country.
[3:00:33.940 --> 3:00:37.940]  We have the authority to put off such destructive government.
[3:00:37.940 --> 3:00:41.940]  We have the authority before to get to Joe Scowson, Stuart Rhodes,
[3:00:41.940 --> 3:00:44.940]  Amon Bundy, Alan Key, Dr. Edward Viviera,
[3:00:44.940 --> 3:00:48.940]  Pastor Chuck Baldwin in an on air committee of correspondence.
[3:00:48.940 --> 3:00:52.940]  We rally the three million good men that it may be left in this country.
[3:00:52.940 --> 3:00:55.940]  And we exercise the authority.
[3:00:55.940 --> 3:00:59.940]  Please, please think that over and do that.
[3:00:59.940 --> 3:01:00.940]  Good point, sir.
[3:01:00.940 --> 3:01:01.940]  God bless you.
[3:01:01.940 --> 3:01:02.940]  Anything else, Duncan?
[3:01:02.940 --> 3:01:03.940]  That's it.
[3:01:03.940 --> 3:01:04.940]  Appreciate it.
[3:01:04.940 --> 3:01:05.940]  Appreciate your good heart.
[3:01:05.940 --> 3:01:07.940]  Keep up, keep the fight for truth.
[3:01:07.940 --> 3:01:08.940]  Brother, we're in this together.
[3:01:08.940 --> 3:01:09.940]  Thank you for what you're doing.
[3:01:09.940 --> 3:01:11.940]  I tell you, it's totally insane.
[3:01:11.940 --> 3:01:14.940]  But just remember, listeners, we are under hack attack.
[3:01:14.940 --> 3:01:16.940]  We are under a denial of service attack.
[3:01:16.940 --> 3:01:19.940]  We're under all these companies throwing us off constantly.
[3:01:19.940 --> 3:01:20.940]  I don't make a big deal about it.
[3:01:20.940 --> 3:01:22.940]  It's musical shares to stay on air.
[3:01:22.940 --> 3:01:23.940]  We got satellite uplinks.
[3:01:23.940 --> 3:01:26.940]  Anybody that wants to grab our feed and re put it out over the internet,
[3:01:26.940 --> 3:01:29.940]  restream it, you want to pay for a service and put on your own servers
[3:01:29.940 --> 3:01:34.940]  and advertise it and put it out, do it and roll your ads over some of our ads.
[3:01:34.940 --> 3:01:35.940]  I don't care.
[3:01:35.940 --> 3:01:36.940]  We're free to air.
[3:01:36.940 --> 3:01:40.940]  Just get the signal out.
[3:01:40.940 --> 3:01:42.940]  Whatever you do, just tell people about however you're listening
[3:01:42.940 --> 3:01:45.940]  and then tell your friends and family about Band-Aught Video.
[3:01:45.940 --> 3:01:48.940]  And when the video streams go down, we have other servers that are the audio streams.
[3:01:48.940 --> 3:01:50.940]  That's why we need to go to Band-Aught Video.
[3:01:50.940 --> 3:01:53.940]  And every page have the audio backup streams for people.
[3:01:53.940 --> 3:01:54.940]  All right.
[3:01:54.940 --> 3:01:56.940]  Justin in Texas, you're on the air.
[3:01:56.940 --> 3:01:58.940]  Thank you.
[3:01:58.940 --> 3:01:59.940]  Absolutely.
[3:01:59.940 --> 3:02:00.940]  That's critical.
[3:02:00.940 --> 3:02:03.940]  Like Art Bell used to say with the ham radio,
[3:02:03.940 --> 3:02:05.940]  you know, we need to connect with each other.
[3:02:05.940 --> 3:02:06.940]  Yeah.
[3:02:06.940 --> 3:02:09.940]  Remember back when radio or TV, you know, it didn't watch you.
[3:02:09.940 --> 3:02:10.940]  It didn't listen to you.
[3:02:10.940 --> 3:02:11.940]  You picked it up.
[3:02:11.940 --> 3:02:13.940]  But now everything tracks you.
[3:02:13.940 --> 3:02:14.940]  What you watch, it watches you.
[3:02:14.940 --> 3:02:16.940]  It's just, it's insane.
[3:02:16.940 --> 3:02:17.940]  Yeah.
[3:02:17.940 --> 3:02:19.940]  Your grandma used to listen to Rush Limbaugh, you know,
[3:02:19.940 --> 3:02:21.940]  Bill O'Reilly was on.
[3:02:21.940 --> 3:02:25.940]  But you know that he was, he was neutral compared to how these guys are now.
[3:02:25.940 --> 3:02:28.940]  Like you, you know, my family defended Texas back then.
[3:02:28.940 --> 3:02:31.940]  And you know, I look white, you know, handsome, clean,
[3:02:31.940 --> 3:02:34.940]  kind of white guy, like, you know, Oh, and Schroeder, but we're,
[3:02:34.940 --> 3:02:38.940]  we're trash, you know, and it's tough because, you know,
[3:02:38.940 --> 3:02:43.940]  I feel the spirit of 1776, 1836, like never before.
[3:02:43.940 --> 3:02:46.940]  I've, I've listened to you throughout the years, kind of,
[3:02:46.940 --> 3:02:48.940]  not so much idly.
[3:02:48.940 --> 3:02:49.940]  I've spoken up.
[3:02:49.940 --> 3:02:51.940]  I went to Planned Parenthood to pray the rosary.
[3:02:51.940 --> 3:02:52.940]  You know, evil.
[3:02:52.940 --> 3:02:54.940]  These people are, you know what I mean?
[3:02:54.940 --> 3:02:58.940]  Well, maybe I met you out there one of those times and you're calling from Austin.
[3:02:58.940 --> 3:03:00.940]  No, I'm from Amarillo, but you know, I do it.
[3:03:00.940 --> 3:03:01.940]  In different states.
[3:03:01.940 --> 3:03:02.940]  So maybe we did.
[3:03:02.940 --> 3:03:05.940]  But I always, uh, I always see the evil psychopath.
[3:03:05.940 --> 3:03:07.940]  Usually we're in the Gothic stuff back, you know,
[3:03:07.940 --> 3:03:08.940]  Oh yeah.
[3:03:08.940 --> 3:03:11.940]  When you go to a abortion clinic and you're a hundred yards away,
[3:03:11.940 --> 3:03:12.940]  people walk over and anti-fun.
[3:03:12.940 --> 3:03:13.940]  They go, we love Satan.
[3:03:13.940 --> 3:03:14.940]  We love killing kids.
[3:03:14.940 --> 3:03:18.940]  We're going to, and then on national TV with women go, I love murdering my baby.
[3:03:18.940 --> 3:03:19.940]  I ruined its life.
[3:03:19.940 --> 3:03:21.940]  I appreciate your kind.
[3:03:21.940 --> 3:03:24.940]  You're like, whoa, I mean, I can play those, I can play those clips folks.
[3:03:24.940 --> 3:03:26.940]  These people are turned over to evil.
[3:03:26.940 --> 3:03:27.940]  They're gone.
[3:03:27.940 --> 3:03:28.940]  Stop bowing to them.
[3:03:28.940 --> 3:03:30.940]  But instead we bow.
[3:03:30.940 --> 3:03:31.940]  Oh, I represent a black person.
[3:03:31.940 --> 3:03:34.940]  I'm an anti for white person bow to me.
[3:03:34.940 --> 3:03:36.940]  Which is the sign of being a slave.
[3:03:36.940 --> 3:03:37.940]  Read in Florida.
[3:03:37.940 --> 3:03:38.940]  Read.
[3:03:38.940 --> 3:03:39.940]  Thanks for holding.
[3:03:39.940 --> 3:03:40.940]  Go ahead.
[3:03:40.940 --> 3:03:41.940]  Hey, Alex.
[3:03:41.940 --> 3:03:44.940]  When Owen brought up the crooked badge and the Floyd video,
[3:03:44.940 --> 3:03:46.940]  and if you go back and watch that,
[3:03:46.940 --> 3:03:50.940]  both the police officers have two different batches on.
[3:03:50.940 --> 3:03:55.940]  And the license plate on the police car says police.
[3:03:55.940 --> 3:04:00.940]  I have never heard of a police car with a police license plate.
[3:04:00.940 --> 3:04:02.940]  So I started looking more into it.
[3:04:02.940 --> 3:04:04.940]  And you can actually look this up.
[3:04:04.940 --> 3:04:09.940]  There has been, I know, in Madrid and a few other places,
[3:04:09.940 --> 3:04:16.940]  riots because of police brutality with the same kneeling on the neck.
[3:04:16.940 --> 3:04:20.940]  And I'm not a conspiracy theorist,
[3:04:20.940 --> 3:04:24.940]  but after Owen brought up that that cops badge was crooked.
[3:04:24.940 --> 3:04:26.940]  I started looking into it.
[3:04:26.940 --> 3:04:27.940]  Yeah.
[3:04:27.940 --> 3:04:28.940]  They just pulled up photos.
[3:04:28.940 --> 3:04:32.940]  I've seen this where the exact thing has been done in city after city.
[3:04:32.940 --> 3:04:33.940]  And country after country.
[3:04:33.940 --> 3:04:35.940]  There it is in Madrid.
[3:04:35.940 --> 3:04:36.940]  There it is in Paris.
[3:04:36.940 --> 3:04:38.940]  And there it is in Minneapolis.
[3:04:38.940 --> 3:04:39.940]  Who knows if it's a Psyop.
[3:04:39.940 --> 3:04:41.940]  I mean, they need this to trigger stuff.
[3:04:41.940 --> 3:04:42.940]  Who knows what's really going on?
[3:04:42.940 --> 3:04:45.940]  You know, you've seen so many other things staged.
[3:04:45.940 --> 3:04:48.940]  You've seen, you know, the whole, I mean,
[3:04:48.940 --> 3:04:49.940]  so many things turn out to be staged.
[3:04:49.940 --> 3:04:51.940]  So it's okay to ask that question.
[3:04:51.940 --> 3:04:52.940]  Read.
[3:04:52.940 --> 3:04:53.940]  I'm out of time.
[3:04:53.940 --> 3:04:54.940]  Go ahead and finish your point.
[3:04:54.940 --> 3:04:56.940]  Sorry.
[3:04:56.940 --> 3:04:57.940]  He's gone.
[3:04:57.940 --> 3:04:58.940]  Okay.
[3:04:58.940 --> 3:04:59.940]  Frank and mass.
[3:04:59.940 --> 3:05:00.940]  Thanks for holding.
[3:05:00.940 --> 3:05:01.940]  Go ahead.
[3:05:01.940 --> 3:05:02.940]  Yeah.
[3:05:02.940 --> 3:05:03.940]  Can you hear me?
[3:05:03.940 --> 3:05:04.940]  Yes, sir.
[3:05:04.940 --> 3:05:05.940]  Go ahead.
[3:05:05.940 --> 3:05:06.940]  Okay.
[3:05:06.940 --> 3:05:11.940]  I wonder if the, the new administration can release files on the murders of
[3:05:11.940 --> 3:05:12.940]  Biggie and Tupac.
[3:05:12.940 --> 3:05:14.940]  This is white people at JFK.
[3:05:14.940 --> 3:05:17.940]  Maybe that would diffuse the situation.
[3:05:17.940 --> 3:05:24.940]  But I'm sure that's what they're talking about,
[3:05:24.940 --> 3:05:28.420]  because I know what's really coming out of thumb bird isеся
[3:05:28.420 --> 3:05:29.940]  his saying, side-stepping her youth.
[3:05:29.940 --> 3:05:32.940]  This is what Tupac said.
[3:05:32.940 --> 3:05:35.940]  Another thing, communists do a hit and run attack.
[3:05:35.940 --> 3:05:37.940]  They play peaceful one side and then the,
[3:05:37.940 --> 3:05:38.940]  the attack on the other.
[3:05:38.940 --> 3:05:41.940]  They are trying to now cut off highways there in Massachusetts.
[3:05:41.940 --> 3:05:43.940]  The trucks won't be able to go through and provide food.
[3:05:43.940 --> 3:05:44.940]  Yeah.
[3:05:44.940 --> 3:05:46.940]  Everything is about shutting the economy down,
[3:05:46.940 --> 3:05:50.660]  for a bunch of dirty Nazis like Soros.
[3:05:50.660 --> 3:05:55.500]  The one thing I disagree with you is that I think you should come up with a documentary
[3:05:55.500 --> 3:06:01.220]  called the Trump deception because Trump is acting like Truman with a military on their
[3:06:01.220 --> 3:06:02.220]  knees.
[3:06:02.220 --> 3:06:03.220]  I can't believe it.
[3:06:03.220 --> 3:06:05.220]  Anyway, that's all I got.
[3:06:05.220 --> 3:06:09.340]  Well, listen, call me back another time and I want to hear your criticisms of Trump.
[3:06:09.340 --> 3:06:12.380]  In fact, we should probably have a whole show with criticism of Trump.
[3:06:12.380 --> 3:06:17.180]  We have Jason Jones and a guest about to take over for the next three segments and then we've
[3:06:17.180 --> 3:06:18.740]  got Owen Schwier come to the war room.

[3:06:42.900 --> 3:06:46.820]  We're living in insanely dangerous times and I told folks the one back three months
[3:06:46.820 --> 3:06:50.500]  ago I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[3:06:50.500 --> 3:06:54.540]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted
[3:06:54.540 --> 3:06:58.540]  that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of
[3:06:58.540 --> 3:07:02.340]  farms and ranches across the United States and it's even worse in the third world.
[3:07:02.340 --> 3:07:06.140]  Now I hope Trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it, but with the election
[3:07:06.140 --> 3:07:10.700]  fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else
[3:07:10.700 --> 3:07:16.020]  is going on, now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years.
[3:07:16.020 --> 3:07:20.220]  They're in easily totable bags, it's high quality food and it's good to have that box

[3:07:31.940 --> 3:07:32.940]  on them.

[3:07:38.940 --> 3:07:45.060]  Hey guys, Rob Dew here with infowarsstore.com and I want to tell you about something that
[3:07:45.060 --> 3:07:49.020]  I think has really helped me out and I think can help you out too, especially if you have
[3:07:49.020 --> 3:07:51.660]  any problems sleeping and that's knockout.
[3:07:51.660 --> 3:07:56.860]  Let's face it, our life patterns have been disrupted by this lockdown, this government-imposed
[3:07:56.860 --> 3:08:00.460]  imprisonment and it has definitely affected my sleep schedule, but one thing that has
[3:08:00.460 --> 3:08:01.460]  helped is knockout.
[3:08:01.460 --> 3:08:05.020]  I take one pill about an hour before I want to go to bed and boom, I get a great night
[3:08:05.020 --> 3:08:09.500]  sleep and just this past Memorial Day, I took two of them, fell asleep about 1 a.m., woke
[3:08:09.500 --> 3:08:11.780]  up at 8 a.m., ready to go.
[3:08:11.780 --> 3:08:15.260]  It really has made a difference in my life and it can make a difference in your life
[3:08:15.260 --> 3:08:16.260]  too.
[3:08:16.260 --> 3:08:17.620]  If you don't get any sleep, you're going to be a grouch.
[3:08:17.620 --> 3:08:20.900]  If you get great sleep, you're going to be on point, you're going to be mentally focused,
[3:08:20.900 --> 3:08:25.580]  you're going to be ready to take on the day and right now knockout is 50% off.

[3:08:34.460 --> 3:08:35.940]  in these tough times.
[3:08:35.940 --> 3:08:43.860]  It's knockout and it's available at infowarstore.com.
[3:08:43.860 --> 3:09:00.340]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:00.340 --> 3:09:02.540]  Aloha, world.
[3:09:02.540 --> 3:09:04.540]  My name is Jason Jones.
[3:09:04.540 --> 3:09:09.820]  Not from my office today, but from my kid's home school room on the west side of Oahu
[3:09:09.820 --> 3:09:12.860]  and I love info wars.
[3:09:12.860 --> 3:09:22.540]  That's who you find on infowars.com and that's who this audience is.
[3:09:22.540 --> 3:09:28.740]  For me, to talk to you in the midst of this crisis is a great honor because this is the
[3:09:28.740 --> 3:09:31.460]  most important audience in the world.
[3:09:31.460 --> 3:09:39.380]  I know right now there are young people who are out on the streets looting, but you think
[3:09:39.380 --> 3:09:43.380]  you might have been duped or tricked and you want to know what's really going on, so you
[3:09:43.380 --> 3:09:44.380]  peek in at info wars.
[3:09:44.380 --> 3:09:46.060]  I see you peeking in.
[3:09:46.060 --> 3:09:50.260]  Right now there are police officers and members of the National Guard wanting to know what
[3:09:50.260 --> 3:09:54.380]  is really going on here and you are watching info wars.
[3:09:54.380 --> 3:09:58.900]  There are patriots across the country and there are people who love liberty across the
[3:09:58.900 --> 3:09:59.900]  world.
[3:09:59.900 --> 3:10:03.060]  For me, to talk to you is quite a privilege.
[3:10:03.060 --> 3:10:07.700]  Through my organization, movie to movement, we run a program called the vulnerable people
[3:10:07.700 --> 3:10:13.660]  project and what we seek to do is use our connections in government and politics and
[3:10:13.660 --> 3:10:18.940]  media to advance the interest of the vulnerable from the child in the womb to the child in
[3:10:18.940 --> 3:10:24.700]  a Chinese occupied East Turkistan to the Kaldians and Assyrian Christians in Iraq and Syria.
[3:10:24.700 --> 3:10:30.980]  We do these calls every Friday and last week I had on the call, I talked to Julianna Tamarazi
[3:10:30.980 --> 3:10:36.500]  who is an Assyrian Christian from Iran who works in Iraq and I said, I need to have you
[3:10:36.500 --> 3:10:40.940]  on info wars, I need to have you on the Alex Jones show because the Christians in the Middle
[3:10:40.940 --> 3:10:49.100]  East, they in Iraq just survived ISIS and now we're going to have a global food shortage
[3:10:49.100 --> 3:10:54.980]  and there's already hunger creeping across India from Bangladesh, India, across the Middle
[3:10:54.980 --> 3:11:02.300]  East and Africa and so these vulnerable communities and conflict zones, we need to have you on.
[3:11:02.300 --> 3:11:07.940]  So Julianna, welcome to the show but I'm going to pivot on you, good to see you.
[3:11:07.940 --> 3:11:09.980]  Nice to see you, thank you for having me on.
[3:11:09.980 --> 3:11:16.900]  Well Julianna, you're a hero of mine, you escaped from Iran as a young teenager, came
[3:11:16.900 --> 3:11:20.060]  to the United States, you didn't forget where you came from and you've been a consistent
[3:11:20.060 --> 3:11:24.980]  advocate for the persecuted church in the Middle East and especially in Iraq as an Assyrian
[3:11:24.980 --> 3:11:26.260]  Christian.
[3:11:26.260 --> 3:11:30.580]  We were going to talk about the plight of Christians in the Middle East today but the
[3:11:30.580 --> 3:11:35.100]  world has erupted since our conference call last week and what I want to talk to you about
[3:11:35.100 --> 3:11:41.580]  is President Trump, we want to talk about justice, social justice, justice is doing
[3:11:41.580 --> 3:11:48.060]  your responsibility, amending for what you've done wrong and President Trump is being attacked
[3:11:48.060 --> 3:11:55.260]  this week because he went to a church, held up a Bible and then he went to the shrine
[3:11:55.260 --> 3:12:01.540]  of St. John Paul II and then committed $50 million in support for persecuted Christians
[3:12:01.540 --> 3:12:07.260]  in Iraq, a country that we destroyed, that we invaded and then left.
[3:12:07.260 --> 3:12:12.020]  So in the midst of everyone screaming justice, President Trump is trying to do an act of
[3:12:12.020 --> 3:12:17.740]  reparations to support communities made vulnerable by our war and our failed foreign policy and
[3:12:17.740 --> 3:12:19.460]  he's being attacked.
[3:12:19.460 --> 3:12:24.260]  How is an Assyrian Christian, what would you say to this?
[3:12:24.260 --> 3:12:29.500]  Well, first of all, there's so much to say, Jason, there's so much to say.
[3:12:29.500 --> 3:12:36.020]  I don't know if there was ever another president that stood as much as he has for the rights
[3:12:36.020 --> 3:12:39.980]  of the Assyrians in Iraq and also the Chaldeans in Syria.
[3:12:39.980 --> 3:12:45.940]  So and you know, starting with this administration, what has been done is they have redirected
[3:12:45.940 --> 3:12:50.620]  the government, the U.S. government has redirected aid being given directly to the churches
[3:12:50.620 --> 3:12:54.900]  on the ground, to the organizations on the ground that are indigenous to Iraq and that
[3:12:54.900 --> 3:13:00.700]  have served for decades, the persecuted church there, including my own organization that
[3:13:00.700 --> 3:13:03.260]  partners with these people on the ground.
[3:13:03.260 --> 3:13:07.700]  So there has been a real change that this administration has brought forth.
[3:13:07.700 --> 3:13:14.220]  The $50 million that you mentioned, as you spoke of, the executive order was signed and
[3:13:14.220 --> 3:13:19.020]  we're grateful for that for international religious freedom, domestically and foreign
[3:13:19.020 --> 3:13:24.100]  and the $50 million was not only allocated for the Iraq Christians, but I think it's
[3:13:24.100 --> 3:13:29.180]  for all of the foreign policies to look at those foreign policies that impact religious
[3:13:29.180 --> 3:13:30.260]  freedom abroad.
[3:13:30.260 --> 3:13:33.820]  So I wanted to make that correction, but we're really grateful.
[3:13:33.820 --> 3:13:36.780]  We're really grateful for what is being done today.
[3:13:36.780 --> 3:13:41.740]  But there's so much more that needs to get done because really Iraq has been completely
[3:13:41.740 --> 3:13:48.660]  destroyed with the U.S. intervention there in Iraq and there's so much work to do.
[3:13:48.660 --> 3:13:52.420]  And I'm so happy to be here to be able to inform your audience about our existence first
[3:13:52.420 --> 3:13:55.820]  of all, that the Assyrians exist still from the Old Testament.
[3:13:55.820 --> 3:13:59.820]  A lot of people think that we're dissipated, that we've disappeared, but there are about
[3:13:59.820 --> 3:14:03.020]  3 million of us left in the world living in our homeland.
[3:14:03.020 --> 3:14:06.340]  Only 150,000 of us are still left in the homeland.
[3:14:06.340 --> 3:14:09.260]  The rest of us are in the diaspora and there's so much to do and there's so much to talk
[3:14:09.260 --> 3:14:10.260]  about.
[3:14:10.260 --> 3:14:13.420]  You're an Assyrian Christian living in Chicago.
[3:14:13.420 --> 3:14:16.660]  There are a lot of Assyrian Christians in Chicago, a lot of Chaldean Christians from
[3:14:16.660 --> 3:14:18.420]  Iraq and Chicago.
[3:14:18.420 --> 3:14:23.580]  Your governor last week said that any church that dare open during this lockdown, he would
[3:14:23.580 --> 3:14:25.060]  raise to the ground.
[3:14:25.060 --> 3:14:26.060]  Did you hear that?
[3:14:26.060 --> 3:14:33.460]  I've read some reports, I have not myself have heard it, but I've heard some reports
[3:14:33.460 --> 3:14:35.260]  and I've heard through the grapevine.
[3:14:35.260 --> 3:14:38.060]  So I haven't seen it with my own eyes, truth be told.
[3:14:38.060 --> 3:14:45.180]  However, if this indeed is true, I'm hoping that his words were mistaken or they were
[3:14:45.180 --> 3:14:50.900]  taken out of context because there are over 100,000 Assyrians and Chaldeans and also Syriacs
[3:14:50.900 --> 3:14:56.340]  that live from the Middle East that have taken refuge here.
[3:14:56.340 --> 3:15:02.340]  This means a lot, it means differently to us when anyone talks about destroying the
[3:15:02.340 --> 3:15:09.540]  church, looting the church, setting the church on fire or raising the church, that only reminds
[3:15:09.540 --> 3:15:15.860]  us of what Al Qaeda and ISIS did in Iraq and Syria and what the Islamic Republic of Iran
[3:15:15.860 --> 3:15:19.140]  is doing by closing down our churches there.
[3:15:19.140 --> 3:15:26.660]  This is for us really, it's an abomination for us to, if this really indeed is true,
[3:15:26.660 --> 3:15:28.620]  it's a scary, scary fact.
[3:15:28.620 --> 3:15:31.900]  Julian is sad and it's true.
[3:15:31.900 --> 3:15:36.540]  We've had the Blasio in New York, Governor Pritzker in Illinois, both say that they would
[3:15:36.540 --> 3:15:38.660]  raise churches to the ground.
[3:15:38.660 --> 3:15:42.940]  They have what I would call their allies in Antifa, which is American ISIS.
[3:15:42.940 --> 3:15:48.380]  I used to try to explain to my friends that ISIS is not related to Islam at all.
[3:15:48.380 --> 3:15:53.060]  There are Muslim extremists, but ISIS, they're just gangs of violent criminals and if we were
[3:15:53.060 --> 3:15:57.780]  to see a breakdown in society in the United States, we would see similar gangs of violent
[3:15:57.780 --> 3:16:05.100]  criminals and I see, I mean, Antifa is really, they have the potential of growing into something
[3:16:05.100 --> 3:16:11.580]  as violent as ISIS and if they were unchecked, I don't think they would check themselves.
[3:16:11.580 --> 3:16:16.260]  They're extremely violent and they've shown that they're capable of anything, including
[3:16:16.260 --> 3:16:18.220]  setting churches on fire.
[3:16:18.220 --> 3:16:21.820]  And so now we have this violent group, Antifa, American ISIS.
[3:16:21.820 --> 3:16:27.820]  I call them uber-fascists, not anti-fascists and you have elected officials allied to Antifa
[3:16:27.820 --> 3:16:34.460]  like Cuomo and Pritzker and Blasio who are threatening to raise churches to the ground.
[3:16:34.460 --> 3:16:38.100]  The United States of America.
[3:16:38.100 --> 3:16:42.620]  You know, I came to this country 30 years ago as a refugee, as a legal refugee.
[3:16:42.620 --> 3:16:47.140]  So the America that I came to 30 years ago is quite different than the America that I
[3:16:47.140 --> 3:16:51.340]  live in today, which is quite very serious and very scary to me.
[3:16:51.340 --> 3:16:55.660]  I can't tell you how many of my community members who have taken refuge in America,
[3:16:55.660 --> 3:16:59.260]  they say, where are we going to go?
[3:16:59.260 --> 3:17:02.860]  This was going to be our homeland because our homeland has been taken away from us in
[3:17:02.860 --> 3:17:07.500]  northern Iraq, and here we are, where are we going to go after this religious freedom
[3:17:07.500 --> 3:17:09.060]  is going to be?
[3:17:09.060 --> 3:17:10.060]  Yes.
[3:17:10.060 --> 3:17:11.060]  We have 30 seconds.
[3:17:11.060 --> 3:17:12.060]  We're not going anywhere.
[3:17:12.060 --> 3:17:13.580]  We're fighting for our country.
[3:17:13.580 --> 3:17:15.500]  My ancestors came before yours.
[3:17:15.500 --> 3:17:17.000]  You came here.
[3:17:17.000 --> 3:17:19.180]  You and I are going to fight for our posterity.
[3:17:19.180 --> 3:17:20.180]  We're not going anywhere.
[3:17:20.180 --> 3:17:21.180]  We're going to save this republic.
[3:17:21.180 --> 3:17:23.500]  The infill wars audience is the tip of that spear.
[3:17:23.500 --> 3:17:27.500]  How do people follow you and support the church in Iraq?
[3:17:27.500 --> 3:17:29.180]  Iraqi Christian Relief.org.
[3:17:29.180 --> 3:17:31.380]  Iraqi Christian Relief.org.
[3:17:31.380 --> 3:17:33.380]  Please help us.
[3:17:33.380 --> 3:17:36.380]  We cannot serve the persecuted church without you, and on Facebook as well, Iraqi Christian
[3:17:36.380 --> 3:17:37.380]  Relief County.
[3:17:37.380 --> 3:17:38.380]  Thank you, Juliana.
[3:17:38.380 --> 3:17:39.380]  Thank you.
[3:17:39.380 --> 3:17:40.380]  Thank you.
[3:17:40.380 --> 3:17:51.580]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax,
[3:17:51.580 --> 3:17:57.300]  and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020.
[3:17:57.300 --> 3:18:02.100]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next, what I can tell you, it's going to be a bunch
[3:18:02.100 --> 3:18:07.900]  of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war, it's going to be economic
[3:18:07.900 --> 3:18:14.100]  collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it, the globalists are attacking
[3:18:14.100 --> 3:18:15.100]  on every front.
[3:18:15.100 --> 3:18:19.340]  That's why now, more than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor infill wars off
[3:18:19.340 --> 3:18:24.340]  the air because they knew that when they launched this whole situation, they didn't want the
[3:18:24.340 --> 3:18:30.580]  people's voice to still be on air, but thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[3:18:30.580 --> 3:18:36.220]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now, more than ever, InfillWars.com
[3:18:36.220 --> 3:18:37.220]  lives.
[3:18:37.220 --> 3:18:43.620]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[3:18:43.620 --> 3:18:49.180]  Sure, coffee, candy, and other highly sugar filled drinks can give you a short boost,
[3:18:49.180 --> 3:18:51.860]  but the crash always follows.
[3:18:51.860 --> 3:18:58.300]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go when you need a little help.
[3:18:58.300 --> 3:18:59.300]  Turboforce.
[3:18:59.300 --> 3:19:06.060]  Similar to other mix in energy packets, Turboforce from InfillWars Life utilizes vitamins, amino
[3:19:06.060 --> 3:19:13.780]  acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years across the world to provide focus, clarity,
[3:19:13.780 --> 3:19:16.580]  and a boost of energy when you need it.
[3:19:16.580 --> 3:19:23.140]  Turboforce is certainly a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable, and tasty energy.
[3:19:23.140 --> 3:19:28.620]  And speaking of affordable, you can even try Turboforce for a limited time at an incredible
[3:19:28.620 --> 3:19:30.780]  40% off.
[3:19:30.780 --> 3:19:39.060]  Don't wait till it's out of stock again and get Turboforce right now, only at InfillWarsStore.com.
[3:19:39.060 --> 3:19:44.300]  I've been fighting the globalist for 26 years and the evil side of me is just so tired of
[3:19:44.300 --> 3:19:49.140]  waiting and I'm so ready for physical war that I'm kind of happy about how bad things
[3:19:49.140 --> 3:19:53.700]  have gotten because all the delusional folks that don't stand out for the unborn babies
[3:19:53.700 --> 3:19:57.460]  that go along with the New World Order, you're about to find out just how sick stuff is.
[3:19:57.460 --> 3:19:58.460]  But you know what?
[3:19:58.460 --> 3:19:59.700]  The average person is still asleep.
[3:19:59.700 --> 3:20:01.540]  They don't deserve what's happening to them.
[3:20:01.540 --> 3:20:06.300]  So I'm actually sick about what's unfolding right now and I just want to turn things around.
[3:20:06.300 --> 3:20:07.300]  But you know what?
[3:20:07.300 --> 3:20:09.300]  I can't do that without you.
[3:20:09.300 --> 3:20:10.700]  I can't get out of this mess.
[3:20:10.700 --> 3:20:14.820]  I can't get out of this stranglehold I'm in unless you decide to get out of it as well.
[3:20:14.820 --> 3:20:18.700]  We're all in this together and so if you just realize how important you are, when you just

[3:20:42.460 --> 3:20:52.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:52.260 --> 3:21:02.300]  Oh hi, welcome back to Hour 4 of the Alex Jones Show.
[3:21:02.300 --> 3:21:05.820]  I'm your guest host Jason Jones coming to you from the west side of Hawaii.
[3:21:05.820 --> 3:21:08.620]  When they open up the economy, they open up my state.
[3:21:08.620 --> 3:21:15.420]  I hope you come back here, that you visit us because we are at almost 40% unemployment.
[3:21:15.420 --> 3:21:17.220]  It's unbelievable.
[3:21:17.220 --> 3:21:23.340]  I was listening to Hotep Jesus in the last segment and I thought we need some Hotep Christians.
[3:21:23.340 --> 3:21:26.820]  We need some Christians to think about a transcended truth.
[3:21:26.820 --> 3:21:27.820]  We need some Christian leaders.
[3:21:27.820 --> 3:21:28.820]  I'm Catholic.
[3:21:28.820 --> 3:21:33.580]  I'm Catholic leaders to think about some transcended truth, to think about justice.
[3:21:33.580 --> 3:21:34.580]  What is justice?
[3:21:34.580 --> 3:21:39.300]  The best answer ever given, in my mind, was by Socrates in the Republic.
[3:21:39.300 --> 3:21:45.860]  When he said justice is doing what it is yours to do, he admitted he didn't really, wasn't
[3:21:45.860 --> 3:21:50.100]  able to use philosophy to get us to know what we are supposed to do.
[3:21:50.100 --> 3:21:55.060]  But it is a Christian that was given to us in the gospel, to love God and love your neighbor.
[3:21:55.060 --> 3:21:56.060]  So that's justice.
[3:21:56.060 --> 3:22:02.660]  As a human being, justice is me, being kind, thoughtful, and loving to my creator and to
[3:22:02.660 --> 3:22:03.820]  my neighbor.
[3:22:03.820 --> 3:22:10.060]  But yet, we have a bunch of virtue signaling priests, bishops, religious leaders across
[3:22:10.060 --> 3:22:15.580]  all denominations who lack the courage to say the hard truth.
[3:22:15.580 --> 3:22:21.380]  The job I thought of really old religious leaders was not to play to the crowd, not
[3:22:21.380 --> 3:22:26.420]  to play to the mob, to say the things that get you nailed to a cross that dragged out
[3:22:26.420 --> 3:22:27.780]  under the street and beat.
[3:22:27.780 --> 3:22:31.300]  I thought that was the job of religious leaders.
[3:22:31.300 --> 3:22:33.900]  I guess not anymore.
[3:22:33.900 --> 3:22:39.860]  Joining me is the most influential Catholic podcaster in the world, and I think a thorn
[3:22:39.860 --> 3:22:44.380]  in the side of a lot of virtue signaling social justice warriors in the hierarchy of the Catholic
[3:22:44.380 --> 3:22:45.380]  Church.
[3:22:45.380 --> 3:22:50.780]  Taylor Marshall, welcome to the Alex Jones show that has the greatest audience in the
[3:22:50.780 --> 3:22:51.780]  world.
[3:22:51.780 --> 3:22:52.780]  How are you doing, brother?
[3:22:52.780 --> 3:22:54.820]  Howdy from Texas to you.
[3:22:54.820 --> 3:22:55.820]  Aloha.
[3:22:55.820 --> 3:22:56.820]  Aloha.
[3:22:56.820 --> 3:23:00.660]  Howdy is texting for Aloha.
[3:23:00.660 --> 3:23:01.660]  Pretty much.
[3:23:01.660 --> 3:23:02.660]  Pretty much.
[3:23:02.660 --> 3:23:03.660]  All right.
[3:23:03.660 --> 3:23:10.740]  So I see on the news that you have this priest who's like a walking prop, James Martin,
[3:23:10.740 --> 3:23:17.620]  condemning President Trump for using the Bible as a prop, which struck me as odd because
[3:23:17.620 --> 3:23:24.460]  James Martin's whole life is a prop, and then you have bishops and other people across denominations.
[3:23:24.460 --> 3:23:27.180]  You're a formerly an Episcopal priest.
[3:23:27.180 --> 3:23:34.380]  You have Episcopalians, priests, Catholic bishops, and others who are virtue signaling.
[3:23:34.380 --> 3:23:36.500]  What is the failure that's happening, Taylor?
[3:23:36.500 --> 3:23:40.220]  There are religious leaders now no longer have courage to speak truth.
[3:23:40.220 --> 3:23:47.100]  Well, you've got priests like James Martin, he's a Jesuit, he's been appointed by Pope
[3:23:47.100 --> 3:23:51.980]  Francis as a consultant on the decastry for communications in the Vatican, so it's kind
[3:23:51.980 --> 3:23:53.980]  of a big deal.
[3:23:53.980 --> 3:23:58.780]  He speaks in a way here in America for the Vatican, and what we've really seen since
[3:23:58.780 --> 3:24:08.220]  the 1960s is clergy, and this is all the way from priests to monsignors, pastors, bishops,
[3:24:08.220 --> 3:24:14.540]  archbishops, cardinals now, you could even say a pope, who are no longer pushing that
[3:24:14.540 --> 3:24:16.460]  old time religion.
[3:24:16.460 --> 3:24:23.620]  The religion of Jesus Christ and the apostles, where they say, repent for the kingdom of
[3:24:23.620 --> 3:24:26.340]  God is at hand, believe in me.
[3:24:26.340 --> 3:24:30.980]  Jesus was born of the Virgin, he died, he rose on the third day, he ascended into heaven,
[3:24:30.980 --> 3:24:36.340]  he sent down the Holy Ghost, he called people to take care of the poor and those that were
[3:24:36.340 --> 3:24:38.980]  in need and to live a life of sacrifice.
[3:24:38.980 --> 3:24:47.540]  Instead, what they're saying is, let's support the governments, let's support the UN, the
[3:24:47.540 --> 3:24:53.740]  EU, and these initiatives, and they're compromised because there's so much money funneling down
[3:24:53.740 --> 3:25:00.300]  from those institutions, and so what we have is an infiltration of corrupt clergy who are
[3:25:00.300 --> 3:25:06.580]  preaching not the gospel, not the Bible, but the status quo, so when they see Donald Trump
[3:25:06.580 --> 3:25:11.700]  standing in front of a church and hold up a Bible, they flip out, it doesn't fit in
[3:25:11.700 --> 3:25:12.700]  their paradigm.
[3:25:12.700 --> 3:25:19.260]  Taylor, he goes to a shrine to pray for the persecuted church, does an executive order
[3:25:19.260 --> 3:25:24.300]  giving $50 million for the church, you want to talk about justice?
[3:25:24.300 --> 3:25:29.180]  Justice is doing what is your responsibility to do, the United States invaded Iraq, Obama
[3:25:29.180 --> 3:25:35.700]  pulled our troops out early, the country collapsed into hell, ISIS committed genocide to the
[3:25:35.700 --> 3:25:39.620]  Christian communities of Iraq that had been there since the first century, the president
[3:25:39.620 --> 3:25:45.860]  in the midst of all of this finds time to go pray for them, finds time to sign an executive
[3:25:45.860 --> 3:25:51.820]  order to give aid to them, isn't that social justice, isn't that what these people say
[3:25:51.820 --> 3:25:54.060]  they're clamoring for?
[3:25:54.060 --> 3:25:59.380]  It's not the social justice and they don't use, see every time you have to add the word
[3:25:59.380 --> 3:26:03.660]  social to the word justice, you're being tricked people.
[3:26:03.660 --> 3:26:11.020]  As you stated earlier, Jason, justice as articulated by Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, you can even
[3:26:11.020 --> 3:26:17.780]  say the New Testament, Saint Paul, Thomas Aquinas, justice is doing your duty to God
[3:26:17.780 --> 3:26:19.780]  and your neighbor.
[3:26:19.780 --> 3:26:24.260]  So justice is always social, anytime they add the word social to social justice, like
[3:26:24.260 --> 3:26:29.260]  social justice warriors, what they're trying to do is creep a little bit of socialism into
[3:26:29.260 --> 3:26:32.700]  your justice and we got to just reject that.
[3:26:32.700 --> 3:26:36.620]  So actually, whenever I hear social justice used, it's unjust.
[3:26:36.620 --> 3:26:40.700]  They're advocating something that is not just.
[3:26:40.700 --> 3:26:46.820]  It's class warfare, it's race riots, it's all these things, it's putting people against
[3:26:46.820 --> 3:26:53.620]  each other, societal identities against one another and in reality, what should be happening
[3:26:53.620 --> 3:27:01.300]  is we should be aiding the most vulnerable, the elderly, the poor, those who have been
[3:27:01.300 --> 3:27:05.340]  hit hardest by this COVID-19 overhype.
[3:27:05.340 --> 3:27:08.220]  Let's talk about the unborn, the babies in the womb.
[3:27:08.220 --> 3:27:11.460]  More babies are dying in the womb, they are of COVID or riots.
[3:27:11.460 --> 3:27:12.460]  But anytime you bring...
[3:27:12.460 --> 3:27:13.460]  Social justice is easy, right?
[3:27:13.460 --> 3:27:14.460]  Taylor, social justice is easy.
[3:27:14.460 --> 3:27:22.620]  Social justice is taking $300 skateboard, $300 skateboard my mommy bought me, smash
[3:27:22.620 --> 3:27:25.620]  out a window and steal a surfboard.
[3:27:25.620 --> 3:27:27.700]  That's social justice.
[3:27:27.700 --> 3:27:32.220]  It's paying down your student loans yourself.
[3:27:32.220 --> 3:27:37.220]  Justice is, I became a father at 18, a reckless teenager, is being a teen parent, working at
[3:27:37.220 --> 3:27:44.300]  night shift, getting up, being a good employee, being respectful to my employers and to customers.
[3:27:44.300 --> 3:27:47.100]  Justice is hard.
[3:27:47.100 --> 3:27:51.940]  Social justice is a cakewalk, it's a riot.
[3:27:51.940 --> 3:27:57.820]  Social justice is the love of the idea of humanity.
[3:27:57.820 --> 3:27:59.300]  I love humanity.
[3:27:59.300 --> 3:28:01.860]  I'm a humane person.
[3:28:01.860 --> 3:28:06.660]  Justice is, I love this miserable neighbor next door to me.
[3:28:06.660 --> 3:28:08.860]  I love these babies who are being killed.
[3:28:08.860 --> 3:28:13.100]  I love these people in the nursing homes who are being euthanized.
[3:28:13.100 --> 3:28:17.540]  That's the real nitty gritty where you're actually loving and serving and trying to do
[3:28:17.540 --> 3:28:22.940]  right by people who are actual people in real life with problems and difficulties and all
[3:28:22.940 --> 3:28:24.580]  kinds of complications.
[3:28:24.580 --> 3:28:32.420]  It's easy to say, I love mankind, I love humanity, I love America, I love these basically platonic
[3:28:32.420 --> 3:28:39.820]  forms and these false clerics promote this because they can use their collar and they
[3:28:39.820 --> 3:28:45.500]  can use their miter and they can use their pulpits and they can hide behind the traditional
[3:28:45.500 --> 3:28:52.380]  trappings of Christianity and promote the same message of George Soros, Cuomo, Nancy
[3:28:52.380 --> 3:28:58.380]  Pelosi, Joe Biden, all of which show up in church, all of which hold up Bibles.
[3:28:58.380 --> 3:29:02.140]  Bill Clinton's in the same spot as Trump holding up the Bible.
[3:29:02.140 --> 3:29:08.100]  Nancy Pelosi has her photo of the Bible, Cuomo has his, Nancy Pelosi's in Catholic masses.
[3:29:08.100 --> 3:29:14.420]  They're using all the props of religion to accelerate and to lift up and promote the
[3:29:14.420 --> 3:29:20.740]  false agenda of globalism, secularism and the destruction of the family.
[3:29:20.740 --> 3:29:26.460]  What is the root cause of religious leaders conforming to the gods of the city?
[3:29:26.460 --> 3:29:32.260]  You would think an elderly bishop like you have in Washington DC who has been connected
[3:29:32.260 --> 3:29:40.100]  to known pedophiles, what is it that would have an elderly man who has supposedly spent
[3:29:40.100 --> 3:29:45.540]  his life in prayer playing to the mob instead of really being thoughtful for the vulnerable
[3:29:45.540 --> 3:29:47.460]  people in Washington DC?
[3:29:47.460 --> 3:29:49.580]  Final word, Jason.
[3:29:49.580 --> 3:29:51.580]  They don't believe in Jesus Christ.
[3:29:51.580 --> 3:29:52.580]  They don't believe in God.
[3:29:52.580 --> 3:29:54.580]  They don't believe in any of this.
[3:29:54.580 --> 3:29:56.780]  So they're getting their reward here on heaven.
[3:29:56.780 --> 3:29:58.540]  They're getting their pockets lined.
[3:29:58.540 --> 3:30:02.820]  They're getting the sensual pleasures and what they want from the flesh and they will work
[3:30:02.820 --> 3:30:05.220]  the agenda of the elites.
[3:30:05.220 --> 3:30:06.220]  They don't believe.
[3:30:06.220 --> 3:30:07.220]  You just don't.
[3:30:07.220 --> 3:30:11.300]  Taylor, we've got 30 seconds left, you did a great show on this this week.
[3:30:11.300 --> 3:30:13.100]  How do people watch your show?
[3:30:13.100 --> 3:30:15.940]  Yeah, go to YouTube, Dr. Taylor Marshall Show.
[3:30:15.940 --> 3:30:16.940]  Just searched Taylor Marshall Show.
[3:30:16.940 --> 3:30:22.700]  I did a couple videos on Trump declaring church is essential and the kind of war between
[3:30:22.700 --> 3:30:26.580]  him and Bill Gates and the war between him and James Martin and a bunch of these globalist
[3:30:26.580 --> 3:30:32.580]  elites and these tech powers who are trying to ultimately enslave us and track us.
[3:30:32.580 --> 3:30:35.740]  Well, keep shining the spotlight on these corrupt clergy.
[3:30:35.740 --> 3:30:37.580]  Taylor Marshall, thank you very much.
[3:30:37.580 --> 3:30:38.580]  All right, Jason Jones.
[3:30:38.580 --> 3:30:43.420]  I told listeners back in December that I would never go to 50% off again because our
[3:30:43.420 --> 3:30:47.700]  markup isn't big enough selling the products to be able to fund ourselves doing that.
[3:30:47.700 --> 3:30:50.260]  But I got to tell you, things are so crazy.
[3:30:50.260 --> 3:30:51.580]  The world is so insane.
[3:30:51.580 --> 3:30:56.860]  My gut level instinct is sell out everything we've got in the warehouse to make sure we
[3:30:56.860 --> 3:31:02.020]  can stay on air through the election in 150 days because we only got money to operate
[3:31:02.020 --> 3:31:03.460]  a few months right now.
[3:31:03.460 --> 3:31:05.780]  So these are great products you and your family need.

[3:31:24.460 --> 3:31:26.460]  to 60% off.

[3:31:33.300 --> 3:31:37.420]  is the average sale, take advantage now and fund the info war.
[3:31:37.420 --> 3:31:41.340]  I don't have to tell you things are bad, they're worse than bad.
[3:31:41.340 --> 3:31:42.340]  They're crazy.
[3:31:42.340 --> 3:31:44.820]  That's a quote from the 1970s film network.
[3:31:44.820 --> 3:31:48.300]  Yeah, things are really, really bad right now, we're in global martial law, villa
[3:31:48.300 --> 3:31:52.220]  mill in the gates, U.N. operations, trying to bankrupt America with their lockdown and
[3:31:52.220 --> 3:31:53.220]  their race riots.
[3:31:53.220 --> 3:31:56.340]  But people are coming together at this beautiful time, but I'll be honest with you.
[3:31:56.340 --> 3:32:00.180]  I have decided to sell out of all the products in the warehouse at 60% off, we haven't done
[3:32:00.180 --> 3:32:04.460]  that ever across the board because of gut level, I realized that we're making or breaking
[3:32:04.460 --> 3:32:05.460]  it.
[3:32:05.460 --> 3:32:08.420]  So the only sure bet is to sell everything we've got to make sure in case there's total
[3:32:08.420 --> 3:32:11.860]  breakdown of society in six months, we still have the funding to go more than six months
[3:32:11.860 --> 3:32:12.860]  in the next year.
[3:32:12.860 --> 3:32:17.100]  So get your high quality products, your fish oil, your krill oil, your DNA force, your

[3:33:38.980 --> 3:33:43.700]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[3:33:43.700 --> 3:33:47.700]  The globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off and they're like,
[3:33:47.700 --> 3:33:52.780]  yeah, you're taking implantable chips, yeah, we're into pedophilia, yeah, we're into world
[3:33:52.780 --> 3:33:59.100]  government, yeah, you're obsolete, you are non-essential, we are shutting your ass down,
[3:33:59.100 --> 3:34:04.060]  yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore,
[3:34:04.060 --> 3:34:08.060]  you're going to be the service economy and now the globalists are telling you that there's
[3:34:08.060 --> 3:34:12.620]  no more service economy and you're obsolete so you better bow down to them and get your
[3:34:12.620 --> 3:34:16.740]  universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[3:34:16.740 --> 3:34:21.940]  The handcuffs are going on right now, we have to resist and say no to the new world order
[3:34:21.940 --> 3:34:26.500]  and that takes you understanding you were right and understanding I was right and getting
[3:34:26.500 --> 3:34:32.580]  in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can now is the time for action
[3:34:32.580 --> 3:34:42.380]  now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[3:34:42.380 --> 3:35:10.380]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:35:10.380 --> 3:35:16.220]  When we look at the challenges facing us today, the lens of the 20th century and the modern
[3:35:16.220 --> 3:35:22.420]  ideologies that claimed almost 200 million innocent lives and the virtues that could
[3:35:22.420 --> 3:35:28.180]  have saved those lives, you might well feel dispereted.
[3:35:28.180 --> 3:35:35.380]  You and I are no match for demagogues who craft big lies to turn ordinary people into
[3:35:35.380 --> 3:35:43.420]  genocidal mobs, we cannot take down all the sophists who we from fashionable half truths
[3:35:43.420 --> 3:35:47.620]  a silk shroud to mask our everyday evils.
[3:35:47.620 --> 3:35:53.100]  Even the stories of heroes who risked all they had in the fight for human dignity can
[3:35:53.100 --> 3:35:56.340]  seem impossibly out of reach.
[3:35:56.340 --> 3:36:01.380]  We can tell ourselves that we are not made of the same kind of stuff, the fiber that
[3:36:01.380 --> 3:36:07.900]  lets a man defy his nation's government, it's ruling elites, it's secret police.
[3:36:07.900 --> 3:36:12.460]  We are just regular Joe's and Jane's and life will not ask us to make this sort of
[3:36:12.460 --> 3:36:17.660]  sacrifice, it had better not because we will fail.
[3:36:17.660 --> 3:36:23.340]  But that is a lie, the same kind of lie that subhumanism tells us about each other, about
[3:36:23.340 --> 3:36:29.100]  our neighbors and spouses and children and especially about strangers who look or think
[3:36:29.100 --> 3:36:32.500]  or pray just a little bit different.
[3:36:32.500 --> 3:36:37.300]  The heroes among us prove that this simply isn't true.
[3:36:37.300 --> 3:36:44.260]  The texture of their lives and the sacrifices they made prove that each and every one of
[3:36:44.260 --> 3:36:46.340]  us can do more.
[3:36:46.340 --> 3:36:52.660]  We can be better, neither Jerome Lejeune or Marianne Yepp or Jersey Popey SQ was born
[3:36:52.660 --> 3:36:57.700]  with special powers, wearing a halo or an amanger.
[3:36:57.700 --> 3:37:03.320]  Other human beings like me and you, they were confused and frightened and tempted.
[3:37:03.320 --> 3:37:08.380]  Each one of them could have made very different choices, could have trumbled along and averted
[3:37:08.380 --> 3:37:13.780]  his eyes from the truths that were being trampled.
[3:37:13.780 --> 3:37:20.900]  Subhumanism for all the intellectual or political masks it wears says just one central thing,
[3:37:20.900 --> 3:37:25.740]  that man doesn't really matter all that much, that there is nothing in us that exceeds or
[3:37:25.740 --> 3:37:32.300]  transcends the ugliness of Darwinian competition, the limits of biology, the inevitability of
[3:37:32.300 --> 3:37:34.220]  death.
[3:37:34.220 --> 3:37:39.580]  That is a lie and we can treat people as if they were robots, ghosts or beasts.
[3:37:39.580 --> 3:37:46.580]  We can starve, enslave, imprison them or kill them, but that doesn't change the reality.
[3:37:46.580 --> 3:37:53.740]  If we look up and also within, we find the mysterious image and likeness of God.
[3:37:53.740 --> 3:37:58.220]  We will discover the truth that we and our neighbors have an incomparable beauty and
[3:37:58.220 --> 3:38:05.780]  worth, a dignity that no one can take away, our thousand year rikes, our workers' paradises
[3:38:05.780 --> 3:38:11.820]  or this brave new world, our ghastly fantasies that human beings create and that history duly
[3:38:11.820 --> 3:38:14.620]  comes along and exposes.
[3:38:14.620 --> 3:38:21.780]  And what is left behind, bruised and battered but still unbowed, is the face of man, as noble
[3:38:21.780 --> 3:38:27.340]  and as beautiful as Adam reaching out his hand to the God who made him.
[3:38:27.340 --> 3:38:31.660]  We will remember that and we will do what is needed.
[3:38:31.660 --> 3:38:36.780]  We will feel from the depths of our hearts to the highest flights of our imagination,
[3:38:36.780 --> 3:38:43.380]  a love of the good, a hatred of cruelty and smallness of soul and a loyalty to each and
[3:38:43.380 --> 3:38:47.180]  every member of our family, the human family.
[3:38:47.180 --> 3:38:52.900]  We will fight to enshrine the basic principles of decency in our political, economic and
[3:38:52.900 --> 3:38:54.780]  personal lives.
[3:38:54.780 --> 3:38:56.500]  We will have courage.
[3:38:56.500 --> 3:38:57.500]  We will prevail.
[3:38:57.500 --> 3:38:58.500]  All right.
[3:38:58.500 --> 3:38:59.500]  Thank you.
[3:38:59.500 --> 3:39:17.540]  Welcome back guys, welcome back guys, that is the afterword to my book, The Race to Save
[3:39:17.540 --> 3:39:19.300]  Our Century.
[3:39:19.300 --> 3:39:24.740]  And when I wrote this book, one of the first people I wanted to get it to was Alex Jones.
[3:39:24.740 --> 3:39:30.580]  And so now that I get to be on his show, sharing with his audience the message of this book,
[3:39:30.580 --> 3:39:38.100]  which I think is really timely, Alex has been telling us for two decades as info warriors,
[3:39:38.100 --> 3:39:42.780]  you've been trying to tell your family and friends, we've seen what's happening coming.
[3:39:42.780 --> 3:39:46.460]  They are trying to divide us, turn us against their own family members.
[3:39:46.460 --> 3:39:51.020]  Now with the COVID crisis, they have family against family, wear a mask, don't wear a
[3:39:51.020 --> 3:39:55.420]  mask, social distance, stone social distance, that was the jab.
[3:39:55.420 --> 3:40:01.340]  Now they're throwing the straight right, trying to divide us with this COVID was a trumped
[3:40:01.340 --> 3:40:02.340]  up crisis.
[3:40:02.340 --> 3:40:07.740]  Not that it wasn't real, and not that there isn't racism, but this is a fake.
[3:40:07.740 --> 3:40:11.300]  America was united that this was a horrible travesty of justice.
[3:40:11.300 --> 3:40:15.820]  America was united that this man, George Floyd, should receive justice.
[3:40:15.820 --> 3:40:20.420]  How can they use something that America was united on to divide us?
[3:40:20.420 --> 3:40:24.620]  You are watching this because you know we are being played.
[3:40:24.620 --> 3:40:31.220]  I want to just for these last couple of minutes again, just with you, ask the question, what
[3:40:31.220 --> 3:40:32.780]  is justice?
[3:40:32.780 --> 3:40:39.100]  Because there's all this talk about justice, and no one even is thinking what it is.
[3:40:39.100 --> 3:40:45.860]  Justice is simple to understand, hard to be, like any virtue.
[3:40:45.860 --> 3:40:49.420]  Justice is doing what it is yours to do.
[3:40:49.420 --> 3:40:53.980]  The direct translation is minding your own business, but minding your own business sounds
[3:40:53.980 --> 3:40:56.020]  like don't eavesdrop on your neighbor.
[3:40:56.020 --> 3:40:57.940]  That's not what he meant.
[3:40:57.940 --> 3:41:05.220]  Socrates meant that justice is doing what it is yours to do, is care for your children,
[3:41:05.220 --> 3:41:08.460]  care for your parents, tend to your flock.
[3:41:08.460 --> 3:41:11.980]  Whatever it is yours to do, you do that.
[3:41:11.980 --> 3:41:17.700]  You don't tell other people what it is theirs to do, until you do what it is yours to do.
[3:41:17.700 --> 3:41:22.500]  And admitted that at the end of the day, I can't use philosophy to find out what it
[3:41:22.500 --> 3:41:24.380]  is mine to do.
[3:41:24.380 --> 3:41:26.740]  We're blessed.
[3:41:26.740 --> 3:41:31.500]  Thanks to the gospel of Jesus Christ, we know what it is ours to do.
[3:41:31.500 --> 3:41:35.420]  Love our God, love God, and love our neighbor.
[3:41:35.420 --> 3:41:38.420]  But loving a neighbor is challenging.
[3:41:38.420 --> 3:41:41.820]  Loving our neighbor is hard, and we often fail.
[3:41:41.820 --> 3:41:46.620]  And that's why we're told that we will be judged by the measure in which we judge.
[3:41:46.620 --> 3:41:49.660]  Do we forgive people for wronging us?
[3:41:49.660 --> 3:41:52.780]  Do we forgive people for being unjust?
[3:41:52.780 --> 3:41:54.740]  Because we have all wronged people.
[3:41:54.740 --> 3:41:57.140]  We have all been unjust.
[3:41:57.140 --> 3:42:04.660]  So as this whole, our whole country is clamoring, violence in the streets, acts of injustice,
[3:42:04.660 --> 3:42:10.580]  police officers being shot, shop owners being punched in the face, homeless people having
[3:42:10.580 --> 3:42:16.100]  their little bed and their little cart thrown around by anti-famabs.
[3:42:16.100 --> 3:42:17.820]  That is unjust.
[3:42:17.820 --> 3:42:22.980]  I have never seen my country be having a little girl because she's white, hold a sign that
[3:42:22.980 --> 3:42:28.860]  says, I'm privileged, taking a child to a protest where you know she's going to be pepper
[3:42:28.860 --> 3:42:31.460]  sprayed keeping her out past the curfew.
[3:42:31.460 --> 3:42:33.420]  That is unjust.
[3:42:33.420 --> 3:42:40.420]  But this infill war's audience is precious and special because it transcends the ideological
[3:42:40.420 --> 3:42:41.420]  spectrum.
[3:42:41.420 --> 3:42:43.860]  It transcends ethnicity.
[3:42:43.860 --> 3:42:49.860]  We are all here, members of every community, every ethnicity, and every part of this country
[3:42:49.860 --> 3:42:50.860]  is here.
[3:42:50.860 --> 3:42:57.380]  So what I want us all to do, and it's hard, you know, you saw me when I was at the urgent
[3:42:57.380 --> 3:43:03.220]  care and I got upset and heated and argued with that director of the medical clinic and
[3:43:03.220 --> 3:43:05.460]  Alex said, you need to apologize to her.
[3:43:05.460 --> 3:43:09.660]  You know, you were a little too, too angry, he's like, I've done the same thing myself.
[3:43:09.660 --> 3:43:16.260]  We all, now is the time that we have to know with Alex with that board, with the chess
[3:43:16.260 --> 3:43:19.780]  board, and he had this skull in the middle.
[3:43:19.780 --> 3:43:24.300]  The only problem with that chess board is it doesn't really reflect reality, right?
[3:43:24.300 --> 3:43:28.100]  And my family, I have, my children are mixed.
[3:43:28.100 --> 3:43:33.500]  My sister's husband is Mexican and my family, I literally have Hawaiian, Filipino, Chinese,
[3:43:33.500 --> 3:43:36.220]  Black, Mexican, so many families are the same.
[3:43:36.220 --> 3:43:40.060]  So that chess board doesn't really depict who we really are, because we are each other.
[3:43:40.060 --> 3:43:46.100]  There's never been a country in the world more united than this country, but yet they
[3:43:46.100 --> 3:43:47.820]  have been successful.
[3:43:47.820 --> 3:43:52.180]  It appears they're being successful in dividing a country that has never been more thoughtful
[3:43:52.180 --> 3:43:58.220]  to each other, more loving or kind and more just, and George Floyd demonstrated that.
[3:43:58.220 --> 3:44:03.020]  Our president, and I don't agree with everything the guy does or everything he says, I don't
[3:44:03.020 --> 3:44:09.180]  agree with everything my wife believes, we argue, but he was ahead of the governor of
[3:44:09.180 --> 3:44:15.740]  Minnesota and the mayor of Minneapolis in assuring the George's family that there will
[3:44:15.740 --> 3:44:19.420]  be justice, and now they want to scapegoat him.
[3:44:19.420 --> 3:44:25.300]  But the honor and privilege to talk to this audience and to share with you, I have to
[3:44:25.300 --> 3:44:29.500]  say I have never sold more copies of my book before the show.
[3:44:29.500 --> 3:44:35.260]  I think we've sold 10,000 copies total since the book came out, and it is selling so fast
[3:44:35.260 --> 3:44:39.340]  thanks to InfoWars audience, and I want to remind you again, I wrote this book, The Race
[3:44:39.340 --> 3:44:44.780]  to Save Our Century, and that video you just saw is the afterward, because I wanted to
[3:44:44.780 --> 3:44:50.380]  know how to order my life to leave to my children and their children into our posterity, a culture
[3:44:50.380 --> 3:44:54.100]  of life, love and beauty, and that's why I wrote that book.
[3:44:54.100 --> 3:44:58.780]  If you go to our website, TheGreatCampaign.org, for a donation of $20, that is literally our
[3:44:58.780 --> 3:45:03.580]  cost for the book, for the packaging and for the shipping, you get a free copy of my book
[3:45:03.580 --> 3:45:05.100]  and it is a tax-deductible donation.
[3:45:05.100 --> 3:45:10.620]  If you want to do more, we'd love you to do more, but $20 is our cost.
[3:45:10.620 --> 3:45:14.540]  So this book is for you, InfoWarriors.
[3:45:14.540 --> 3:45:18.220]  Let's go out and show our family, friends and neighbors what it is to be bold.
[3:45:18.220 --> 3:45:23.420]  Speak popular untruths, that isn't the just thing we can do now, but do it in a way that's
[3:45:23.420 --> 3:45:24.420]  kind and loving.
[3:45:24.420 --> 3:45:29.420]  So to the InfoWarriors, Aloha.
