[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Average parts of the south, and it's not over, forecast to say the Carolinas, Georgia
[00:07.000 --> 00:10.560]  and Florida could all see rough conditions overnight.
[00:10.560 --> 00:15.640]  House fire has killed three college students at the University of Wisconsin stout.
[00:15.640 --> 00:19.920]  Firefighters say heavy smoke was billowing from the basement and both floors of the house
[00:19.920 --> 00:21.360]  when they arrived.
[00:21.360 --> 00:26.200]  One person is dead, at least four have been seriously injured when a tour bus rolled over
[00:26.200 --> 00:31.960]  on Interstate 94 in Minnesota, most of those on the bus said to be teenagers.
[00:31.960 --> 00:35.840]  Members of the Mormon sect throughout the west say they're worried about the impact
[00:35.840 --> 00:39.440]  of a raid at a Texas ranch because of alleged abuse.
[00:39.440 --> 00:45.880]  Texas authorities have removed 52 girls from the ranch following complaints of alleged
[00:45.880 --> 00:47.840]  child abuse.
[00:47.840 --> 00:52.440]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[00:52.440 --> 00:57.160]  Suriasis, the itching, flaking and irritation is painful, but the emotional suffering can
[00:57.160 --> 00:58.660]  be even more devastating.
[00:58.660 --> 01:02.200]  My body was so sore, my mind was so worn out, I could not sleep at night.
[01:02.200 --> 01:06.240]  I felt self-conscious, nobody knows what that flaking is, and people say, ew, it just made
[01:06.240 --> 01:07.240]  me feel like you're dirty.
[01:07.240 --> 01:08.240]  A lot of people know when I have this comparison.
[01:08.240 --> 01:11.680]  Of course I felt self-conscious, not very attractive to look at.

[01:50.820 --> 01:58.560]  President Bush has used his weekly radio address today to discuss the expansion of NATO.
[01:58.560 --> 02:03.340]  The president, attending the NATO summit this week in Romania, notes the country is one
[02:03.340 --> 02:08.100]  of ten liberated nations who have joined the organization after decades of tyranny
[02:08.100 --> 02:09.100]  and oppression.
[02:09.100 --> 02:13.380]  Today Romania is an important member of an international alliance dedicated to liberty,
[02:13.380 --> 02:18.200]  and it is setting a bold example for other former communist nations that desire to live
[02:18.200 --> 02:23.560]  and peace and freedom. The president says two of those countries are Croatia and Albania,
[02:23.560 --> 02:28.980]  which have been invited to join the alliance. The president says Europe is now into a promising
[02:28.980 --> 02:34.880]  new era of peace after the wars and communist oppression of the 20th century. The president
[02:34.880 --> 02:40.120]  is also meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Those talks today have been described
[02:40.120 --> 02:45.360]  as very friendly. And the tour of duty for American troops could be shortened from 15

[03:22.680 --> 03:28.400]  The head of Mexico's Catholic Bishop says violent drug gangs in Mexico are financing
[03:28.400 --> 03:33.960]  building churches in poor villages in order to win over locals to their side. Bishop Carlos
[03:33.960 --> 03:41.200]  Aguier says drug traffickers pour money into building roads or churches and providing electricity
[03:41.200 --> 03:46.360]  service. He says the drug smugglers quote, build things that mean a lot for the communities.
[03:46.360 --> 03:52.440]  He adds the church is trying to get gangsters to leave the drug smuggling trade. An estimated
[03:52.440 --> 03:57.080]  two and a half thousand people died in Mexico last year in the war between drug lords and
[03:57.080 --> 04:02.880]  controlling smuggling routes to the United States. Microsoft says if Yahoo's board of

[04:40.320 --> 04:53.480]  pizza.com for an incredible $2.6 million. I'm Jason Walker, IRN USA Radio News.

[06:29.840 --> 06:53.840]  I have 25 words for you. From my cold dead hand, back in 1999, Charlton Heston died yesterday
[06:53.840 --> 06:59.000]  afternoon at his home in Beverly Hills, California.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.480]  I've always been a big fan of Charlton Heston. I was a little kid. My mom in Dallas took
[07:03.480 --> 07:08.240]  me in to see the Ten Commandments on the big screen and then every once a year Ben Hurd
[07:08.240 --> 07:13.360]  would come to town. She took me once to see that and Soylent Green, Omega Man, which they
[07:13.360 --> 07:19.320]  just remade into I Am Legend with Will Smith. That's the original name of the novel that
[07:19.320 --> 07:25.480]  they first made into Omega Man. Of course, I've interviewed Charlton Heston and talked
[07:25.480 --> 07:32.280]  to him at several events, had a chance to meet him a few times after that in person.
[07:32.280 --> 07:37.400]  Last night when I found out he died, I had gone into the office to do some work on a
[07:37.400 --> 07:41.680]  film I'm making and it was midnight and I got in the car and was driving home right
[07:41.680 --> 07:46.960]  at midnight and tuned into KLBJ 590 AM, the station that we do this Sunday syndicated
[07:46.960 --> 07:53.200]  show out of where we originate the show out of. I heard him talking about an 84-year-old
[07:53.200 --> 07:57.320]  actor who died. I'd missed the first part of the announcement on Fox News and I just
[07:57.320 --> 08:01.200]  knew it was Charlton Heston because I knew his age and then they went into the roles
[08:01.200 --> 08:09.360]  and repeated that Charlton Heston had died at 84 years of age. So today I'm going to
[08:09.360 --> 08:19.040]  re-air part of an interview I did with Mr. Heston, now deceased, seven years ago or January
[08:19.040 --> 08:25.680]  18, 2000. Now last night I got home about 12.30, I started googling and searching on
[08:25.680 --> 08:31.880]  my own website going back seven years and guess what, the MP3 link was dead. I looked
[08:31.880 --> 08:36.920]  all over the web till about 2 AM, couldn't find it. I went into the office this afternoon,
[08:36.920 --> 08:43.040]  tore the office apart and found a copy of it on CD that somebody recorded off of an
[08:43.040 --> 08:49.320]  AM radio station and that they had copied and mailed to me. So it's not the best audio
[08:49.320 --> 08:57.400]  quality but this is it. I was real mad, folks, that I couldn't find my Charlton Heston interview
[08:57.400 --> 09:02.120]  but we were able to find it. Sometime during the weekday show, it's about a 20-minute interview,
[09:02.120 --> 09:05.600]  I will air the whole thing sometime this week on the 3-hour weekday show but I'm going
[09:05.600 --> 09:09.520]  to air about five minutes of it today just like I'm going to air about five minutes of
[09:09.520 --> 09:17.040]  the Jesse Ventura interview that I did Wednesday that made it in the Associated Press, the
[09:17.040 --> 09:24.880]  Dallas Morning News, the Pioneer Press, international television, national television. We interviewed
[09:24.880 --> 09:31.720]  Governor Ventura and he said a lot of, well, really controversial statements. He talked
[09:31.720 --> 09:36.280]  about how NBC really hired him to block him from having free speech and keeping him when
[09:36.280 --> 09:40.560]  he left the governorship in 2003 for being able to speak out against the war. They wouldn't
[09:40.560 --> 09:44.160]  let him speak out against the war and they wouldn't let him get on any other media or
[09:44.160 --> 09:48.840]  TV via his contract. He talked about how he believes that criminal elements of the government
[09:48.840 --> 09:53.520]  will assassinate Barack Obama if he truly becomes the president and tries to pull troops
[09:53.520 --> 09:58.320]  out of Iraq. But the big one was, former Governor Jesse Ventura, World Trade Center, collapsed
[09:58.320 --> 10:03.360]  a controlled demolition, an inside job the government carried it out. Associated Press,
[10:03.360 --> 10:09.320]  Governor Ventura says he regrets initial acceptance of 9-11 explanations and he said that on the
[10:09.320 --> 10:14.880]  syndicated radio show of Alex Jones. So we'll be playing some of that today as well and
[10:14.880 --> 10:20.520]  taking your phone calls. But in the last half of the show today, I'm going to play, I don't
[10:20.520 --> 10:25.200]  know, eight, nine minutes or about half the interview I had with Charlton Heston. And
[10:25.200 --> 10:31.520]  I know this, Chuck retired about a year and a half later, sharp as a tack when I interviewed
[10:31.520 --> 10:35.800]  him, Chuck Heston, and I never bugged him again even though I had his home phone number and
[10:35.800 --> 10:41.320]  never tried to get him back on. Well, Willie Nelson called up and wanted to come on the
[10:41.320 --> 10:46.280]  show and talk about 9-11 being an inside job. And let me tell you something, I am not going
[10:46.280 --> 10:50.880]  to not call Willie Nelson now. I've had Willie Nelson's phone number for two, three months.
[10:50.880 --> 10:54.520]  I haven't ever bugged him or called him on it after I had him on the show. But you know
[10:54.520 --> 10:57.400]  what? I am going to bug him. I'm going to get to know him. He invited me to get to know
[10:57.400 --> 11:02.000]  him. I'm going to get to know these people because I'm tired of them dying. I'm tired
[11:02.000 --> 11:11.680]  of them being gone. Just amazing. I mean, I know a lot of other big Hollywood people
[11:11.680 --> 11:17.760]  who have actually contacted me before and I'll talk to them and never call them again. Well,
[11:17.760 --> 11:22.040]  that's over. I'm going to start calling Keanu Reeves and I'm going to start calling Bruce
[11:22.040 --> 11:25.640]  Willis and I'm going to start calling and bugging. I know him pretty good, Rick Linkletter
[11:25.640 --> 11:30.400]  here in Austin because the craziest thing is I've been invited out to eat with people
[11:30.400 --> 11:34.640]  or invited out to Los Angeles and I just don't do it. I'm so busy fighting the New World
[11:34.640 --> 11:39.640]  Order, so busy doing radio and I just regret that I didn't at least call Chuck Heston back,
[11:39.640 --> 11:43.280]  Charlton Heston and get him on a few more times before he retired because this living
[11:43.280 --> 11:50.160]  legend, this icon, this humanitarian is gone. He's gone. I can't ever talk to him again.
[11:50.160 --> 11:52.800]  We'll never get to see another interview with him. We'll never get to see anything new from
[11:52.800 --> 12:00.160]  him. He's gone. I do have some comments too about Heston's family, just some observations.
[12:00.160 --> 12:03.920]  I'm going to try to be nice about this, but I've got some comments coming up near the
[12:03.920 --> 12:11.160]  end of the show today as well. But Chuck Heston, I mean, he's just one of my favorite actors
[12:11.160 --> 12:21.920]  and such a gentleman. Okay. What is the other news I have in front of me here? Vodka maker
[12:21.920 --> 12:29.280]  Absolute apologizes, ends ad showing California, Texas as part of Mexico. That's out of the
[12:29.280 --> 12:35.520]  Associated Press today. Friday this broke and I'm so conditioned to all of the LaRicon
[12:35.520 --> 12:41.160]  quista talk, the reconquering of the Southwest, that I didn't even cover it on my show. Kurt
[12:41.160 --> 12:47.080]  Nemo posted it, posted the Absolute ad Monday morning, I mean Friday morning. I went on
[12:47.080 --> 12:52.360]  the air for three hours and didn't even talk about it. This is so old hat to me that I
[12:52.360 --> 12:57.600]  didn't even talk about it. Since then, it's been all over the news, a huge issue. Washington
[12:57.600 --> 13:04.520]  Post, LA Times, TV news, huge boycotts, people freaking out. I forget just because I knew
[13:04.520 --> 13:09.040]  about this 15 years ago, doesn't mean that the general public knows about it today. I
[13:09.040 --> 13:15.120]  have to remember we have to reintroduce all this. And it is true that in polls, more than
[13:15.120 --> 13:21.920]  80% of Hispanics from Mexico do not consider themselves to be American and they actually,
[13:21.920 --> 13:25.280]  this is not Mexican Americans or folks that are here in this country and love this country.
[13:25.280 --> 13:34.120]  It's the immigrants. They don't just not like the U.S., it is a cultural, wild hatred. And
[13:34.120 --> 13:39.880]  go read the LA Times comments, there's more than 500 of them last time I checked and we're
[13:39.880 --> 13:45.800]  going to kill you. Yes, we're taking over. You will all be killed. And I'm like, I'm
[13:45.800 --> 13:49.920]  not supposed to talk about this. I'm supposed to just play along with this and act like
[13:49.920 --> 13:57.280]  this isn't going on. Absolute vodka understood that this is the market. And so in Spanish
[13:57.280 --> 14:03.160]  publications in the U.S., Spanish language and in the Mexican TV and Mexican newspapers
[14:03.160 --> 14:13.760]  and magazines, they advertise Colorado, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma.
[14:13.760 --> 14:21.840]  It isn't just Texas and Mexico. It is about half the country. And this is taught in U.S.
[14:21.840 --> 14:26.920]  public schools. It is taught in the colleges. It's taught in Mexico. Our government is globalist.
[14:26.920 --> 14:30.840]  They want to break the U.S. up. They want us divided and conquered and fighting with
[14:30.840 --> 14:36.680]  each other. And our government for 50 years, the criminals running it, have been financing.
[14:36.680 --> 14:42.800]  The Ford Foundation has spent more than 20 billion of its hundreds of billions. Yes,
[14:42.800 --> 14:48.240]  hundreds of billions, ladies and gentlemen, to go down to Mexico and pay for the textbooks,
[14:48.240 --> 14:53.960]  the comic books, all of it. I mean, I own all these. Where they say they're going to
[14:53.960 --> 14:59.040]  take over the U.S. and that all whites will be murdered. Now, I know you don't believe
[14:59.040 --> 15:03.920]  that. See, it's perfect. Just like teenagers talking code and text messaging code and parents
[15:03.920 --> 15:07.600]  don't understand it. And I still haven't figured out half of it and I'm a computer
[15:07.600 --> 15:11.560]  head. I just don't text message a lot. It's the same thing with the illegal aliens. I
[15:11.560 --> 15:15.640]  mean, it's the radios. We're going to kill you. Get the guns. Get the weapons. We're
[15:15.640 --> 15:20.240]  going to kill Gringo. Get ready. Move in. Take over. Don't hire them. Get in positions
[15:20.240 --> 15:24.680]  to fire all of them. Drive them out of America. The killing of the Gringo will soon start.
[15:24.680 --> 15:30.760]  The mass murder will soon begin. Death, death, death. But see, the Gringos and the blacks
[15:30.760 --> 15:35.520]  and Hispanics that have been, you know, in the melting pot, they're not speaking Spanish.
[15:35.520 --> 15:39.280]  They're not hearing it. They're not tuned in. Perfect way to take over. I'm going to
[15:39.280 --> 15:43.200]  let you know just how serious it is and how there's a mass of people preparing to slaughter
[15:43.200 --> 15:53.480]  you and your family and they have already attacked. We'll be right back.
[15:53.480 --> 16:01.320]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[16:01.320 --> 16:08.280]  world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[16:08.280 --> 16:13.680]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world
[16:13.680 --> 16:22.520]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time
[16:22.520 --> 16:28.240]  in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret
[16:28.240 --> 16:32.760]  that drives the entire new world order agenda. Builder Bird is making great progress toward
[16:32.760 --> 16:35.960]  a world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the
[16:35.960 --> 16:40.040]  money they need. They're after power. That's their after these years. Order in-game on

[16:46.520 --> 16:52.280]  In-game, blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[16:52.280 --> 16:55.880]  Hello, Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note
[16:55.880 --> 17:00.360]  and understand the risks of deficit spending. Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes
[17:00.360 --> 17:04.720]  as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors
[17:04.720 --> 17:09.040]  can remove from their accounts. A fractional reserve system means only a small portion
[17:09.040 --> 17:13.240]  of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal. Deficit spending will skyrocket
[17:13.240 --> 17:17.600]  through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed
[17:17.600 --> 17:22.200]  by a depressed economy. A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central
[17:22.200 --> 17:26.640]  banks to increase liquidity for depositors. However, an increase in money supply without
[17:26.640 --> 17:31.080]  equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation. In order to achieve strength and
[17:31.080 --> 17:36.240]  stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned
[17:36.240 --> 17:41.360]  into gold and silver. While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on
[17:41.360 --> 17:48.240]  its own has held value for over 6,000 years. For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[17:48.240 --> 17:50.440]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[17:50.440 --> 17:58.640]  Hi, neighbor. This is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force. Life is a gamble, but you can stack
[17:58.640 --> 18:04.040]  the deck. If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd
[18:04.040 --> 18:08.320]  start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply
[18:08.320 --> 18:14.160]  of food possible. When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned
[18:14.160 --> 18:19.560]  food is all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and
[18:19.560 --> 18:24.600]  only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[18:24.600 --> 18:28.240]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest
[18:28.240 --> 18:33.760]  of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply. Decide it's
[18:33.760 --> 18:40.880]  food now or probably never, but can you afford to be wrong? Decide now. Place your bet. Can
[18:40.880 --> 18:53.640]  you afford to be wrong? Call 800-409-5633 on the WebEFoodsDirect.com. Call 800-409-5633.
[18:53.640 --> 18:57.760]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that
[18:57.760 --> 19:01.760]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[19:01.760 --> 19:05.960]  the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are
[19:05.960 --> 19:10.920]  absorbed into the skin. The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold
[19:10.920 --> 19:15.880]  water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the
[19:15.880 --> 19:21.520]  growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus. The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically
[19:21.520 --> 19:26.480]  lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants and water
[19:26.480 --> 19:31.200]  treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[19:31.200 --> 19:37.560]  What about you? Order your KDF Shower Filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99

[20:11.800 --> 20:15.800]  Let me explain something to everybody. It is painful for me to have to cover this and
[20:15.800 --> 20:24.200]  have to tell you this and what happens is I mean to mediate my words but when I get
[20:24.200 --> 20:29.400]  on air all I want to do is tell you the truth and I can't control myself so I just laid
[20:29.400 --> 20:33.400]  out the truth for you in the last segment. I know it sounds radical, I know it's scary,
[20:33.400 --> 20:43.680]  I know it's crazy. It's also divisive and painful but I'm not the one selling at shops
[20:43.680 --> 20:49.880]  all over Austin, plan of San Diego shirts. If you Google plan of San Diego you'll be
[20:49.880 --> 20:54.360]  at the University of Texas website, you'll be at the University of Mexico at Mexico
[20:54.360 --> 21:01.120]  Cities website. It was the German slash Mexican plan during World War I to attack the southwest
[21:01.120 --> 21:09.640]  from Texas to California and to kill all whites 16 and older and then force the other whites
[21:09.640 --> 21:17.160]  to leave. It also said that if blacks didn't swear allegiance to Mexico they would be killed.
[21:17.160 --> 21:25.240]  Now under German command Mexico did attack California, Arizona and Texas. In one night
[21:25.240 --> 21:33.160]  23 Americans were killed and the Mexicans went in, in south Texas, into homes, killed
[21:33.160 --> 21:38.400]  whole families, two year old children, slit their throats ear to ear, under German command
[21:38.400 --> 21:42.800]  of course. Now they don't want you to know about that but you can find out about that
[21:42.800 --> 21:49.920]  real quick. We're these chicken-necked yuppie Americans who are weak and pathetic and dumb
[21:49.920 --> 21:55.400]  down and think we're free when we're not and so we have no idea what's going on. You ever
[21:55.400 --> 22:03.240]  heard the Marine Chorantham from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli? We
[22:03.240 --> 22:10.480]  will fight this country's battles. You understand that song? The few that proud the Marines,
[22:10.480 --> 22:15.360]  the Marines first big victory after they were incorporated into the Navy properly and expanded
[22:15.360 --> 22:19.640]  was led by Ulysses S. Grant. He's the guy I remember became the head of the Northern
[22:19.640 --> 22:25.520]  military during the Civil War but as a young man he led the Marines to fight a force of
[22:25.520 --> 22:31.280]  about four to one battling all the way down into Mexico. Then the Mexicans asked the U.S.
[22:31.280 --> 22:35.480]  to take over and the U.S. said no we're not going to do that. We're going to pay you
[22:35.480 --> 22:40.840]  ten million dollars for land that you took from Spain when you overthrew them twenty
[22:40.840 --> 22:45.920]  something years before. Let's get this clear. If the Southwest belongs to anybody it's
[22:45.920 --> 22:52.480]  the Native American tribes but they all fought with each other constantly. Spain fell, Santa
[22:52.480 --> 22:59.320]  Ana came in, Santa Ana then, Spain had invited the Tennesseans, Alabamans and others into
[22:59.320 --> 23:05.920]  Texas because they couldn't kick the Comanche, the Apache, the Red Sticks, Baton Rouge in
[23:05.920 --> 23:09.360]  French that's why you call it Baton Rouge. It was where the Red Sticks were based, means
[23:09.360 --> 23:14.760]  Red Bat, Red Stick. That was one of the main tribes in the eastern part of the state, very
[23:14.760 --> 23:20.080]  tough and it's not like the movies set in the 1880's where you know it's John Wayne
[23:20.080 --> 23:24.640]  he's riding down the last few Indians, the Native Americans. This was like huge battles
[23:24.640 --> 23:29.800]  where whole towns would be wiped out and there'd be 20,000 Indians against you know
[23:29.800 --> 23:37.760]  8,000 Americans and Andrew Jackson and they're riding. This was toe to toe, this was endless
[23:37.760 --> 23:45.120]  warfare from what's Illinois today down to Texas. This is when the battles were at each
[23:45.120 --> 23:52.240]  other's throats and the Natives were getting the upper hand most of the time. Spain could
[23:52.240 --> 23:56.920]  do nothing. I mean the war like Anglo-Saxons could barely beat the Indians. The Spanish
[23:56.920 --> 24:03.080]  had no chance. They were being wiped out everywhere. There were less than 5,000 Spanish citizens
[24:03.080 --> 24:08.280]  from Texas, Oklahoma all the way over through Colorado, all the way over through Arizona,
[24:08.280 --> 24:12.520]  all the way through Nevada into California and Oregon and the Russians were up in Washington
[24:12.520 --> 24:16.640]  State and Oregon they had that. It doesn't matter the LaRica and Quistas are claiming
[24:16.640 --> 24:21.640]  all of that. It means the reconquering of the Southwest and it's taught in Mexico. So
[24:21.640 --> 24:28.160]  it's true for about 19 and a half years Mexico had the Southwest and couldn't hold any of
[24:28.160 --> 24:36.080]  it. Then Mexico came into Oklahoma and attacked a bunch of people and killed a bunch of people.
[24:36.080 --> 24:40.520]  There was a group of scouts, what was it like 19 of them and more than a thousand Mexican
[24:40.520 --> 24:45.120]  troops just slaughtered them, killed every one of them and then the Mexico kept attacking
[24:45.120 --> 24:52.040]  them. Mexico was attacking the U.S. and so the Marines came down and just absolutely
[24:52.040 --> 24:56.680]  cleaned Mexico's clock. They had a bunch of Irish with them. You'll wonder why the LaRica
[24:56.680 --> 25:04.880]  and Quistas like to wear, you'll see it, green and clovers and that's saying, and you can
[25:04.880 --> 25:12.640]  ask them, that's saying well we like the Irish. They helped us fight the Americans. We're
[25:12.640 --> 25:19.760]  not racist. We just want to kill Americans. They had a whole bunch of Catholic Irish down
[25:19.760 --> 25:25.320]  there that also got their hind ends kicked when the Marines came in and I'm sorry. I
[25:25.320 --> 25:29.600]  mean, you know, I'm sorry the Marines could fight four to one, five to one. I'm sorry.
[25:29.600 --> 25:36.720]  I mean, you know, Mexico is a narco terrorist state. It is totally corrupt. It has more
[25:36.720 --> 25:41.000]  billionaires than any other nation on earth per capita, but the people are some of the
[25:41.000 --> 25:47.320]  poorest in the world. The Mexican people are smart, hardworking, inventive. They have been
[25:47.320 --> 25:53.400]  downtrodden since the Aztecs enslaved them and then that merged with the conquistadors
[25:53.400 --> 25:58.640]  and so this hatred of the United States, I'm a true patriot. I love the United States.
[25:58.640 --> 26:04.960]  Okay, my family was in the battles of San Jacinto. My family on both sides, my mother's family
[26:04.960 --> 26:11.600]  raised Colonel Travis's son. His last letter from the Alamo was to them. You understand
[26:11.600 --> 26:17.600]  folks? My family has Spanish land grants on my dad's side. On my mother's side, German
[26:17.600 --> 26:22.440]  immigrants, Alsatian immigrants that came here in the 1830s and 40s. As Texas as it
[26:22.440 --> 26:30.240]  gets and I just cannot stand by for this anymore. It makes me sick and I really, it's a terrible
[26:30.240 --> 26:36.200]  thing because, because I want to get along with everybody. I want to be friendly. I want
[26:36.200 --> 26:39.520]  to be nice. You know, I was talking to a group of low recon quistas a few years ago. They
[26:39.520 --> 26:43.120]  were going to have a big parade celebrating the takeover of the US and I called the head
[26:43.120 --> 26:46.800]  of it up here in Austin and I said, man, I said, listen, I got a lot of Hispanic friends.
[26:46.800 --> 26:51.920]  I said, this is aggressive towards the US. And he said, Oh, the racist gringo, you like
[26:51.920 --> 26:55.200]  some of us. And I said, no, man, I really don't care. I said, you're the one that's
[26:55.200 --> 26:59.160]  the racist and use that term. And I said, I'll be down there and he said, you don't dare.
[26:59.160 --> 27:03.120]  He'll kick your butt. And I said, okay, I'm going to be there. And I was there. And you
[27:03.120 --> 27:08.120]  know, that's the sad part about this is that, is that we got the new world order hurting
[27:08.120 --> 27:12.280]  all of us. We got the new order putting fluoride and all of our water. We have the new world
[27:12.280 --> 27:15.680]  order that's putting mercury and all our vaccines. We have the new world order that's destroying
[27:15.680 --> 27:20.640]  the dollar just like destroyed the peso. We have the new world order that that that
[27:20.640 --> 27:26.040]  is hurting. I mean, I say take Planned Parenthood, the eugenics front for exterminating little
[27:26.040 --> 27:29.920]  black and brown babies out of your neighborhood. Do you see your Mexican or black leaders saying
[27:29.920 --> 27:35.160]  get those out of your neighborhood? No. Do you know that was set up even before Hitler
[27:35.160 --> 27:38.560]  and that Hitler was buddies with Margaret Sanger who set up Planned Parenthood? You
[27:38.560 --> 27:43.200]  know, I actually want you to live well. I actually want you to have good jobs. I actually
[27:43.200 --> 27:50.080]  want everybody to be happy and have fun. But you know, my uncle lived in Guatemala for
[27:50.080 --> 27:55.240]  many years. My cousins did. They speak Spanish. I remember my cousin 15 years ago going, Yeah,
[27:55.240 --> 27:58.480]  you know, I speak Spanish, but I'm a white guy. So I get to hear about how the gringos
[27:58.480 --> 28:03.960]  are bad and how we're going to get it and how we're going to get killed. And you know,
[28:03.960 --> 28:08.600]  that's the problem. Every time you talk about the little secret that I have to say more
[28:08.600 --> 28:15.800]  than half the folks that, you know, say that they're from Mexico are four. It's like, Oh,
[28:15.800 --> 28:19.320]  you shouldn't say that we write books saying we're going to kill you when our numbers are
[28:19.320 --> 28:26.000]  high enough. That's racist. I'm going to say you want to kill me. I'm going to finish up
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.800]  on this because this is important. I'm going to read you some of the quotes out of the
[28:28.800 --> 28:36.920]  LA Times about we're going to kill you. Again, absolute vodka in an absolute world says that
[28:36.920 --> 28:54.840]  half the US will go back to Mexico. We'll be right back. America needs Ron Paul. He
[28:54.840 --> 28:59.880]  needs your support. The time is now. As long as he has your support, he will continue to
[28:59.880 --> 29:04.240]  fight until the very end. We know that many people would like to show their support, but

[32:51.480 --> 32:55.320]  outside the U.S.
[32:55.320 --> 33:15.440]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[33:15.440 --> 33:36.160]  What's happened is, absolute vodka is running print ads and TV ads in Mexico that show half
[33:36.160 --> 33:42.640]  the United States that originally belonged to Spain just because they said they had
[33:42.640 --> 33:49.160]  it. They didn't have anybody on it and couldn't keep it.
[33:49.160 --> 33:55.880]  All absolute vodka, the Swedish vodka company was doing was playing to something that their
[33:55.880 --> 34:00.920]  marketing studies had shown. In fact, the PR firm that's now in deep trouble and apologizing
[34:00.920 --> 34:09.120]  that was hired by Absolut is apologizing. And see, that's the big dirty secret that
[34:09.120 --> 34:12.840]  happened. And my wife grew up in Spain. She lived there four years, Italy six years, so
[34:12.840 --> 34:17.520]  she speaks fluent Spanish. And she'll freak out listening to the Spanish radio station.
[34:17.520 --> 34:22.720]  She'll freak out at signs as we drive down the road. She'll freak out and I told her
[34:22.720 --> 34:26.760]  about this 10 years ago and she didn't believe me and now she sees it everywhere. And we'll
[34:26.760 --> 34:35.720]  be in restaurants and people will say stuff. And it's perfect because you've got the chicken
[34:35.720 --> 34:42.840]  neck, liberal, guilty. Let me roll a red carpet out for everybody. Let me feel sorry. Let
[34:42.840 --> 34:49.320]  me not say anything. Let me just feel guilty. I'm an evil white devil. I'm the worst thing
[34:49.320 --> 34:56.040]  on earth. And oh, yes. Let the illegal aliens be able to have free health care but citizens
[34:56.040 --> 34:59.520]  don't get it. Did you know they get that? Or let the illegal aliens get free tuition
[34:59.520 --> 35:04.880]  that citizens don't get or let them not get arrested for DWIs or not having driver's license.
[35:04.880 --> 35:13.240]  That's all admitted. It's just anything because we love you and we're bad. And then, meanwhile,
[35:13.240 --> 35:20.240]  it's on one end, well, Gringo needs to have all the land taken and ha ha, Gringo's dying.
[35:20.240 --> 35:24.400]  I can play you hundreds of these clips. The mayor of LA says this stuff back when he was
[35:24.400 --> 35:29.880]  just a city council member. And all the white people are going to die, ha ha, you know,
[35:29.880 --> 35:35.360]  your scum, the blacks are my otters, which means blackbird, all this racist stuff and
[35:35.360 --> 35:40.200]  Native American Indians. They have all these horrible names for them. I mean, just so much
[35:40.200 --> 35:47.320]  racist terms. And by they, I'm talking about public officials, members of the legislature
[35:47.320 --> 35:51.720]  in California, the mayor. I think I'm going to come in next week and just play a bunch
[35:51.720 --> 36:00.760]  of clips of this. Now, most Hispanics hate this. Most Hispanics can't stand it, but
[36:00.760 --> 36:06.640]  they then get called sellouts if they don't go with the pro nationalist groups from Mexico.
[36:06.640 --> 36:13.800]  You see, people have been taught that the US belongs to Mexico who come from Mexico.
[36:13.800 --> 36:18.680]  And then the Mexicans come from where they're dirt poor and oppressed completely in a very
[36:18.680 --> 36:23.880]  corrupt system. They get here and they see Hispanics, whites, blacks, Asians and others
[36:23.880 --> 36:28.320]  that are part of the system that see themselves as Americans doing better than them. They
[36:28.320 --> 36:33.560]  see themselves having to take the menial lower paid jobs. And so they're also, you know,
[36:33.560 --> 36:37.240]  a lot of anger gets created and generated. But you have the Ford Foundation, the Bush
[36:37.240 --> 36:41.880]  White House, the Democrats, Rob Allen and Co. This was in the Dallas morning news three
[36:41.880 --> 36:46.440]  years ago, three Christmases ago or two and a half Christmases ago. They two and a half
[36:46.440 --> 36:51.760]  years ago to be technical. They, it was in the news that they were going to finance marches
[36:51.760 --> 36:56.640]  all over the country and big packing houses and big companies paid their employees to
[36:56.640 --> 37:00.680]  be off and go march in these things all over the country. And so I knew this was in the
[37:00.680 --> 37:05.120]  Dallas morning news. It was all staged. And, but still no one seemed to know that as it
[37:05.120 --> 37:10.360]  unfolded for the next two years. That is big corporations who want to drive down wages,
[37:10.360 --> 37:16.960]  who want to break down the sovereignty of this country are financing all of this, financing
[37:16.960 --> 37:20.520]  driving down the wages, breaking down the country. And they want to divide and conquer.
[37:20.520 --> 37:26.720]  They want to Southwest that's majority people who believe this belongs to Mexico. See, Americans
[37:26.720 --> 37:32.240]  have been taught to be anti-nationalistic, to hate their country, that America is bad,
[37:32.240 --> 37:38.160]  that sovereignty is bad, that we got to be globalist, that the U.N.s got to run us.
[37:38.160 --> 37:42.320]  But then conversely, Mexico is one of the most nationalistic countries in the world.
[37:42.320 --> 37:47.680]  They've been taught to hate America, to hate the United States. And so that's the recipe
[37:47.680 --> 37:54.560]  we've got. All right, folks, I want to do business with the Mexicans from Mexico who
[37:54.560 --> 38:00.600]  are here. I want to be their friends. I want them to fight the New World Order. I want
[38:00.600 --> 38:05.120]  their children to be healthy and happy. I want them to have good medical care. I want them
[38:05.120 --> 38:19.200]  to do well. But I cannot sit here while, here's an example. Wide-owned, U.S.-owned TV company,
[38:19.200 --> 38:24.360]  three years ago, and you can just type this in, L.A. billboards say L.A. belongs to Mexico.
[38:24.360 --> 38:32.800]  Type that into Google, it'll come up. It's in the news. They ran 670-something billboards
[38:32.800 --> 38:39.360]  that showed the TV anchors, Spanish TV, and it said L.A. And then it had this crossed
[38:39.360 --> 38:48.440]  out and it said Mexico. Now, why do you think the rich, white TV network, the network that
[38:48.440 --> 38:53.120]  owns this has hundreds of stations in both English and Spanish across the country, why
[38:53.120 --> 38:57.080]  do you think they ran that? Well, A, they know that that's the prevailing, that's the
[38:57.080 --> 39:02.000]  dominant, cultural ideal and view. And I just can't sit here and ignore that the emperor
[39:02.000 --> 39:12.240]  has no clothes and say this isn't going on. Okay, that's going on A. B, the corporates
[39:12.240 --> 39:16.760]  also want the breakup of the U.S. They're already busy merging Canada and Mexico with
[39:16.760 --> 39:19.880]  the U.S. and getting rid of our bill of rights and constitution. It's called the Security
[39:19.880 --> 39:24.080]  and Prosperity Partnership. And there are good statesmen, politicians in Mexico, the
[39:24.080 --> 39:27.640]  U.S. and Canada, last week who were getting together to introduce legislation in all three
[39:27.640 --> 39:34.640]  countries to scrap the SPP. Now, I've actually found that Mexicans from Mexico know about
[39:34.640 --> 39:38.360]  the New World Order, know about implantable chips, know about government-sponsored terror,
[39:38.360 --> 39:44.080]  know about tyranny, are actually more savvy to tyranny in most respects than dumbed down
[39:44.080 --> 39:52.160]  spoiled Americans. But then they still have this cultural zeitgeist of hating the U.S.
[39:52.160 --> 39:56.600]  and believing that the Southwest belongs to them, like, oh, we'd be doing great if we
[39:56.600 --> 40:02.280]  just had the U.S. You know, they stole that from us. There were no Mexicans to speak of
[40:02.280 --> 40:08.360]  here when Spain ran it. Mexico didn't exist, but 5,000 total, a little bit under that number
[40:08.360 --> 40:17.360]  actually, at the time of the war with Texas. That's the whole Southwest. Mexico has tripled
[40:17.360 --> 40:23.240]  the natural resources of all of the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, but you
[40:23.240 --> 40:27.120]  don't have wealth because it is a culture of corruption. And I don't want to hear, oh,
[40:27.120 --> 40:31.240]  you can't make judgments about culture. I can say the Nazi culture was degenerate, black
[40:31.240 --> 40:37.080]  uniforms, mass killings, concentration camps, warmongering. I can say the Aztec culture
[40:37.080 --> 40:42.600]  was bad, human sacrificing their children. Is that good? I can say the Babylonian culture
[40:42.600 --> 40:50.000]  was bad, you know, compared to other cultures. You can judge cultures. No, cultures are not
[40:50.000 --> 40:58.440]  equal. And Western modern culture has been anti-corruption, pro-art, pro-science, pro-ideas,
[40:58.440 --> 41:04.280]  pro-due process, Magna Carta 1215. That was the light of the world created. Now it's become
[41:04.280 --> 41:07.960]  the evil of the world because power corrupts and absolute power corrupts, absolutely, because
[41:07.960 --> 41:13.600]  the West developed all the major structures and all the major dominant sciences and systems
[41:13.600 --> 41:17.680]  and got all the power. It has become evil and ruthless and corrupt. I'm not debating
[41:17.680 --> 41:22.520]  that the West is very evil. It is an evil culture. 50 million abortions is evil. But
[41:22.520 --> 41:28.560]  it's different and it's becoming corrupt just like Mexico with the classic kind of Napoleonic
[41:28.560 --> 41:35.240]  or French-type corruption. You know, the French have a, I can use a European model of that,
[41:35.240 --> 41:42.640]  or the old Spanish or corruption or the Castilian corruption or the old Portuguese-type corruption.
[41:42.640 --> 41:50.120]  It's called Mordito or little bite, pan off the police, or it's called, you know, beak
[41:50.120 --> 41:54.720]  dipping. And I mean, I've been in Mexico many times and almost every time I'm there, cops
[41:54.720 --> 41:59.760]  pull you over randomly and say $100. And if you don't pay it to them, they'll take your
[41:59.760 --> 42:03.880]  wife into the station and rape her. I mean, you're a dumb gringo down there driving across
[42:03.880 --> 42:07.720]  the border and they find a 22 shell casing under your seat. You're going to jail for
[42:07.720 --> 42:11.000]  five years. They're going to suck every dime out of your family. They run credit reports
[42:11.000 --> 42:18.240]  on you. Find out how much money you got. I'm tired of the double standard. So, so absolute
[42:18.240 --> 42:21.320]  vodka. I'm going to finish up with this. I know we got callers, but I'm going to finish
[42:21.320 --> 42:25.000]  up with this because this is an important subject. I'm not going to sit here and cover
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.760]  this up and act like this doesn't exist. We're in deep trouble, ladies and gentlemen. We
[42:29.760 --> 42:33.880]  need to come together and stop hating each other and realize the globalists are playing
[42:33.880 --> 42:40.040]  us off against each other. You can see the map of the Reconquista from the absolute vodka

[42:45.040 --> 42:58.560]  Hi, neighbor. They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Certainly, we'd
[42:58.560 --> 43:02.200]  never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left
[43:02.200 --> 43:06.600]  at any price. We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could
[43:06.600 --> 43:11.120]  care for those unable to care for themselves. We would intend not to be standing in the
[43:11.120 --> 43:15.600]  bread line with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance
[43:15.600 --> 43:21.160]  are untrue. If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the bread line may have
[43:21.160 --> 43:26.320]  no bread. Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good
[43:26.320 --> 43:31.160]  intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us. Only getting our food supply
[43:31.160 --> 43:38.680]  immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future. Call 800-409-5633
[43:38.680 --> 43:49.280]  800-409-5633 on the web, eFoodsDirect.com. Who am I? Nobody. Steve Shane, someone who
[43:49.280 --> 43:54.880]  cares.

[44:53.440 --> 44:58.040]  It's a fact. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United
[44:58.040 --> 45:02.400]  States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue. With never ending
[45:02.400 --> 45:06.720]  late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically
[45:06.720 --> 45:11.640]  impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors. The Federal Debt
[45:11.640 --> 45:16.240]  Relief System has created a successful attorney backed program to legally eliminate credit
[45:16.240 --> 45:19.920]  card debt, personal loans, lines of credit and other unsecured debts which have been
[45:19.920 --> 45:24.400]  fraudulently created by the banks. We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months
[45:24.400 --> 45:28.720]  with a much lower monthly payment ending with nothing on your credit report. Join the thousands
[45:28.720 --> 45:32.560]  of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated
[45:32.560 --> 45:36.480]  their debt. Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action
[45:36.480 --> 45:42.400]  and turn your life around. Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600. That's

[45:49.880 --> 45:57.360]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth
[45:57.360 --> 46:02.360]  to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost
[46:02.360 --> 46:07.200]  of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty
[46:07.200 --> 46:11.560]  line. Is this a flaw-free enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[46:11.560 --> 46:16.640]  Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions
[46:16.640 --> 46:20.400]  and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll
[46:20.400 --> 46:25.000]  Island. Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central
[46:25.000 --> 46:30.280]  bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[46:49.120 --> 47:16.880]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[47:16.880 --> 47:31.880]  Welcome to GCNLive.com.
[47:31.880 --> 47:48.440]  Go to Professor Gutierrez, the head of Chicano studies at the University of Texas, New York
[47:48.440 --> 47:59.200]  Times. Every major corporation gives money to GM, Ford, Miller, just all of them. I'm
[47:59.200 --> 48:06.640]  sitting here. This guy is saying, we need to be killed. He wants to kill me. And people
[48:06.640 --> 48:10.280]  in this LA Times article, there's hundreds and hundreds of comments in their comments
[48:10.280 --> 48:13.120]  section. You've got to go read them. We have a link to it up on infowords.com if you want
[48:13.120 --> 48:20.680]  an easy place to find the story in the LA Times. They will quote this stuff. They'll
[48:20.680 --> 48:25.440]  put links up to this. And then the larycon cases come in and say, yes, you're an evil
[48:25.440 --> 48:31.760]  white. You need to be killed. You're a racist. See, you don't want to die. The Texas Civil
[48:31.760 --> 48:39.360]  Rights Review, when I did a TV report on the plan of San Diego, the plan to kill all whites,
[48:39.360 --> 48:46.480]  16 and older, and then forcibly adopt and reeducate the rest of the whites. That was
[48:46.480 --> 48:50.400]  the German plan because they knew how to sell the Mexicans on attacking the U.S. when they
[48:50.400 --> 48:56.720]  got desperate in World War I. The Texas Civil Rights Review, you can pull it up. They said,
[48:56.720 --> 49:00.640]  well, Mr. Jones is backwards and bad. And it is true. The plan of San Diego is to kill
[49:00.640 --> 49:07.160]  the whites. But in fact, try the plan of San Diego into Google. You'll find articles, we
[49:07.160 --> 49:10.600]  wrote about it, and articles we wrote about what the Texas Civil Rights Review said. And
[49:10.600 --> 49:15.320]  then you can link through and read their comments on their own newspaper. And they said, yes.
[49:15.320 --> 49:20.320]  But Hispanics have been down-throtted by evil whites. And so it's okay to talk about how
[49:20.320 --> 49:25.440]  all whites need to be killed. By the way, if you're listening to this for the first time,
[49:25.440 --> 49:31.040]  I'm not joking. I try to not cover this. It's very painful. I try to ignore it. But
[49:34.080 --> 49:41.200]  it's very, very, very, very sad. It's very, very, very, very sad. But it feels good. It's
[49:41.200 --> 49:46.160]  very primitive. And everybody likes to hate other groups. You know, it's very primitive. Blacks
[49:46.160 --> 49:49.840]  like to hate whites and whites like to hate blacks. And the blacks and whites love to fight
[49:49.840 --> 49:55.280]  with Hispanics and some of the Hispanic. And then even if you don't like racism or tribalism,
[49:55.280 --> 49:59.280]  because the hate's coming at you, it makes it real. And you don't want to get into it.
[50:00.480 --> 50:04.240]  And then it gets so ridiculous that the politicians run all this and control this.
[50:04.800 --> 50:09.280]  We've got all these Gutierrez clips. And I've got Charlton Heston interview I did. I want to play.
[50:09.280 --> 50:17.600]  I've got my interview I did with Jesse Ventura this week that made headlines all over the country.
[50:17.600 --> 50:23.600]  I got a lot of other subjects I want to cover. The Eugenicists are poisoning us, sterilizing us,
[50:23.600 --> 50:28.160]  black, white, old, young, Hispanic. It doesn't matter. We're all in this together. And they're
[50:28.160 --> 50:34.560]  just playing us off against each other. But it's so outrageous that you turn on Mexican TV.
[50:36.240 --> 50:38.800]  No, I mean, HBO last year had a comedy special
[50:42.160 --> 50:46.640]  where that popular comedian, I was watching TV 190, was on there. The whole thing was racist,
[50:46.640 --> 50:56.240]  anti-gringo. And hell, it was in English. So here's the deal. I am the son of liberal,
[50:58.160 --> 51:02.640]  types who were taught they were white and evil and bad. And so I brought up that everyone is good
[51:02.640 --> 51:08.320]  but whites and I'm evil. And then I learned that no matter how much I grovel, I'm hated and everyone's
[51:08.320 --> 51:13.520]  planning to kill me. So to hell with it, I'm not going to kiss your butt anymore, man. It's over.
[51:13.520 --> 51:19.520]  The fun, the games are over. And if all this race stuff continues, fine. But you're the racist,
[51:19.520 --> 51:24.960]  the people out there. I mean, I've protested the Ku Klux Klan so many times. And I remember being on
[51:24.960 --> 51:27.920]  the phone with these La Rican quiches that were going to have this anti-America march
[51:29.200 --> 51:36.240]  where they wave Mexican flags and chant Oslon. The motto is for our race everything, for those
[51:36.240 --> 51:42.800]  outside the race, nothing. And I just said, you know, I protested the Klan. And the guy's like
[51:42.800 --> 51:47.360]  giggling on the phone. Well, you ought to go join him, gringo. We don't want you. You know, it's
[51:47.360 --> 51:52.800]  like how I'm pathetic. I'm weak because I want to be friendly. And then just giggling and snickering
[51:52.800 --> 52:00.240]  and just knowing that this country is so weak now, so chicken-necked, so pathetic, puts up with
[52:00.240 --> 52:07.040]  anything, goes along with anything, puts up. There were a couple million people in Mexico
[52:07.040 --> 52:13.200]  in the 1840s. There's 100 million in the country and 30 million in our country now.
[52:13.840 --> 52:19.280]  It's going to be 200 million another 30 years. The West is dying. The third world's exploding.
[52:19.280 --> 52:24.400]  I'm fighting the globalist from exterminating. You're trying to stop the real ops, but you trust
[52:24.400 --> 52:30.720]  your government. You trust your, you know, it's so sick. And then it's all this race thing. You
[52:30.720 --> 52:36.720]  think the New World Order is for the country breaking down. It's for, did you know that the
[52:36.720 --> 52:40.960]  Royal Commission on Population written by the British, it's the blueprint of the U.S. plan,
[52:40.960 --> 52:46.080]  says that they actually block third world countries from industrializing and from becoming
[52:46.080 --> 52:50.640]  First World. They want you to have a bunch of kids because it holds you back. They want you to be
[52:50.640 --> 52:55.920]  in squalor. They want only 1% having the money. They want the peon system. That just means the,
[52:55.920 --> 53:02.800]  peon means slave. It means ranch slave. Here in the U.S., you see, the U.S. is like a lifeboat
[53:02.800 --> 53:07.040]  that 20 people can be in and we're already got a hundred in sinking. And they just want
[53:07.040 --> 53:10.720]  to have the third world overwhelm and bring this country down. That's in globalist documents.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.600]  You know, there's so many of these Gutierrez clips. Have you found the one where he says
[53:15.600 --> 53:19.840]  whites need to be killed? Because there's so many clips. We were in there during a three minute
[53:19.840 --> 53:24.560]  break trying to, with like 50 different clips, with just how we've got, and this is the head of
[53:24.560 --> 53:33.040]  UT Chicano studies. UT. Big eugenics front organization. Totally white Iran. Why do they do
[53:33.040 --> 53:37.680]  this? Because they want to solve each other's throats. The big money wants to bring down the
[53:37.680 --> 53:41.840]  U.S. And don't worry, the U.S. is falling. The dollar's dying. Everything's dying. If you're
[53:41.840 --> 53:47.440]  Hispanic, black, white, it doesn't matter. It's hurting you. I mean, I remember being in an event
[53:47.440 --> 53:51.120]  three years ago and like, what are all these plan of San Diego shirts and a Hispanic listener
[53:51.120 --> 53:55.440]  of mine walks up and goes, man, you need to Google that. You don't know, Mr. Jones. Another guy
[53:55.440 --> 54:00.320]  comes up, a white guy goes, yeah, I'm a history professor at UT. That means kill all whites.
[54:00.880 --> 54:06.960]  And I said, no. And I went home and Googled it and it was mainstream. A huge plan to kill me?
[54:06.960 --> 54:14.560]  What did I do? I'm a limp rested chicken neck walking around feeling guilty. Guilty for what?
[54:14.560 --> 54:21.120]  What? My ancestors kicked the butt of the Imperial Spanish. They kicked the butt of the
[54:21.120 --> 54:27.120]  of the of the Imperial British Imperial systems didn't work. Were my ancestors perfect? No.
[54:28.480 --> 54:32.720]  Y'all hear this? Well, the U.S. had slavery. Hell, Mexico still basically got slavery.
[54:32.720 --> 54:37.040]  Just a different name. You ready to blame? Here's the head of Chicano studies, UT. There's
[54:37.040 --> 54:41.040]  so many clips. Just play some of it. It's not to believe in yourself because the fight begins
[54:41.040 --> 54:49.360]  with you. Self determination. The first word is self, you. And we believed it in the Chicano movement.
[54:50.640 --> 54:56.320]  We believed it. So we said, we're going to build a plan right here.
[54:58.160 --> 55:00.480]  And each one of us beginning our own way.
[55:02.080 --> 55:06.640]  The Brown Berets, for example, is the defense of a defense unit for all of us.
[55:06.640 --> 55:13.920]  The Maya chapters in Texas was full walkout, going California, Los South Castro's in the Lincoln
[55:13.920 --> 55:20.400]  Heights and the Roosevelt Heights. Los Rosalinos moños is fighting against the war. Los Raúl Rices
[55:20.400 --> 55:25.520]  y los demás in that area with La Raza magazine and the early Chicano studies program, the plan
[55:25.520 --> 55:35.280]  of San Diego. If you go back and read any basic book. Good pause. Now he goes on and on. This is
[55:35.280 --> 55:40.720]  from my TV show. This is from UT. Okay, this is University of Texas. Now you go Google plan
[55:40.720 --> 55:46.480]  of San Diego and then he says, we need to implement the plan of San Diego. You want to kill me and
[55:46.480 --> 55:56.800]  my family? And I'm not supposed to talk about it. All I could say is from the shores of Tripoli,
[55:56.800 --> 56:02.720]  ladies and gentlemen, from the halls of Montezuma. And you know, that's the point here. The U.S.
[56:02.720 --> 56:07.280]  when Mexico attacked it, marched down, took over your country, should have freed all the slaves,
[56:07.280 --> 56:15.680]  the people living on the peon ranches, should have freed all the people. And it should just be part
[56:15.680 --> 56:19.920]  of the U.S. And then we'd have, I don't care if it was brown skinned people everywhere, as long as
[56:19.920 --> 56:26.480]  they were Americans. Imagine that place would be an incredible engine right now of economy and
[56:26.480 --> 56:32.560]  liberty and freedom. Hell, I could live in the U.S. and live in Cancun. It isn't that I don't want
[56:32.560 --> 56:38.560]  to be around brown people. It's that my cousin happened to speak Spanish. And so he would say,
[56:38.560 --> 56:43.360]  oh, man, I'm a bartender. You ought to hear it. Then they walk up and say, hey, dirty white scum,
[56:43.360 --> 56:47.280]  give me a drink. And he'll flash back in Spanish. Hey, how dare you talk to me like that? Oh, I'm
[56:47.280 --> 56:53.360]  sorry. And it's a big joke. And my wife speaks Spanish growing up in Spain. And it totally
[56:53.360 --> 56:58.640]  freaks her out. Man, I'm tired of it. And then I went and found out and now I see it on the sides
[56:58.640 --> 57:03.920]  of restaurants. Restaurants I used to go in have like, basically, we're going to get the whites
[57:03.920 --> 57:09.040]  on the side of it. And it's like a big joke that like a smuck, I'd walk in there while I'm being
[57:09.040 --> 57:17.280]  hated, while stuff's being done to my food. You know, I mean, this is sick. Can't we just live in
[57:17.280 --> 57:24.960]  peace? No, we can't. The globalists are going to have their way. They're going to, they're going
[57:24.960 --> 57:27.920]  to destroy the dollar. They're going to bring the country down. They're going to have a race war.
[57:27.920 --> 57:32.320]  And we'll all be slaves. Our children will have no future. Globalists win again. It's like they
[57:32.320 --> 57:37.280]  play different native tribes off against each other in Africa or in the US. They'll play us off
[57:37.280 --> 57:41.600]  against each other. We could wake up and win, but we won't. It feels too good to be idiots.

[1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:16.960]  as Croatia and Albania have been invited to join the Alliance.

[1:00:30.320 --> 1:00:35.840]  the two are trying to narrow differences over U.S. plans for a missile shield in Eastern Europe.
[1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:41.600]  The tour of duty for American troops in Iraq could be shortened from 15 to 12 months by the

[1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:06.560]  cause of the accident. We did some research on the company that operated the bus and
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:12.560]  the Department of Transportation records say they have a satisfactory rating as far as safety
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:18.240]  and a very safe record. Most of the passengers, teenagers from Pelican Rapids, Minnesota.
[1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:23.040]  More trouble at London's Heathrow Airport because of a glitch in software that tracks

[1:03:54.720 --> 1:03:58.560]  The company says it's evaluating its bid for Yahoo.

[1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:13.280]  making the company less valuable. I'm Jackson Ivy.
[1:04:13.280 --> 1:04:18.960]  International Monetary Fund in England has issued a grim report on the future of the global economy.
[1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:24.480]  IMF says the housing and credit crisis in the United States taking its toll on the economy.

[1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:43.520]  and for the adoption of a worldwide early warning system to preempt future crises.
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:48.800]  I'm Jason Walker, IRN-USA Radio News.
[1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:55.760]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease,
[1:04:55.760 --> 1:05:00.080]  such as cancer or diabetes? Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat,
[1:05:00.080 --> 1:05:03.440]  what we drink, the environment, and our high stress lifestyles.
[1:05:03.440 --> 1:05:07.600]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:12.720]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:17.600]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science,

[1:06:29.440 --> 1:06:32.240]  Look, I'm going to get to your calls. I got a bunch of other news.
[1:06:32.240 --> 1:06:35.920]  I got this Charles and Hessford interview that I did seven years ago
[1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:39.440]  that's never reared since and isn't on the internet.
[1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:42.800]  I'm going to air all of it later on the weekday show coming up this week.
[1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:48.560]  The Jesse Ventura interview we did made it all over natural, international news.
[1:06:48.560 --> 1:06:50.640]  I'll play a few minutes of that today.
[1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:52.480]  Got a bunch of other important news.
[1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:59.600]  I said I'd get to your calls and we will at 877-590-5525.

[1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:07.120]  Somebody has to talk about this.
[1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:12.720]  The fact that on the colleges, in the high schools, I mean, I've got a report here
[1:07:13.440 --> 1:07:17.280]  that we won't have time to play but it's up on prisonplanet.com or an Air Force veteran
[1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:25.280]  at a major university, the university took down the American flag and now flies a Mexican flag.
[1:07:25.280 --> 1:07:29.840]  There are eight South Texas towns that the city halls fly Mexican flags and not U.S. flags.
[1:07:29.840 --> 1:07:32.080]  That's been in the all over Texas papers.
[1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:38.160]  Elsa Nietzsche was the main one, I remember that 12 years ago and it finally hit CNN last week
[1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:40.320]  and see Lou Dobbs is bad to report on it.
[1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:44.480]  That they fly the Mexican flag, not the American.
[1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:49.280]  Do you understand, ladies and gentlemen, this guy went and took down the university flag,
[1:07:49.280 --> 1:07:53.280]  ran up the stars and stripes and he got arrested and he was just convicted.
[1:07:53.280 --> 1:08:00.160]  So hate crime, hate law, hate speech, it's all selectively enforced.
[1:08:02.560 --> 1:08:05.920]  It's all selectively enforced and again, the big banks, the big money,
[1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:08.800]  wants to get rid of the U.S., wants to get rid of the middle class
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:14.080]  and Hispanic Americans, the most patriotic people there are, statistically,
[1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:16.960]  most people don't know this, there are more congressional medal of honor winners
[1:08:17.920 --> 1:08:21.200]  and I meant to make this point earlier, I just get so mad, who are Hispanic
[1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:25.200]  than any other group, very patriotic people.
[1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:30.640]  I'll never forget being down in San Antonio when my cousin was about 12 years old, I was about 13
[1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:34.240]  and he had his friends on the football team who were all Hispanic
[1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:40.480]  and we'd go over to their houses and hang out and play football and stuff and they would all say,
[1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:42.720]  man, what do you think about the illegal aliens?
[1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:46.880]  And I thought it was some test or something, I'm this chicken-necked liberal
[1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:49.520]  and I would have been totally taught to hate myself and I said,
[1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:53.040]  I thought, what do you mean, the illegals, I don't even know what an illegal is.
[1:08:53.040 --> 1:08:56.000]  They're like, these illegal aliens that hate this country want to take it over
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:01.280]  and I got to know those guys over five or six years when my cousin moved, visiting once or twice a year
[1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:05.840]  and Carlos and all of them, they were all serious, they knew, they were Americans,
[1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:09.920]  their dads were all former military, they were middle class living in big houses
[1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:14.560]  and they were here in the Spanish, if we're going to get America, we're going to bring it down,
[1:09:14.560 --> 1:09:19.840]  communism, you know, crap like that and so Hispanic Americans have to pay the same taxes
[1:09:19.840 --> 1:09:24.080]  everybody else does for the illegal aliens to get free taxes, by the way, they've done studies,
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:29.440]  more than half the people in LA, more than half the people in Dallas County
[1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:36.720]  in LA, it's like 75% in the jails are illegal aliens and why is it saying Mexicans are criminals?
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:42.640]  No, the criminals in Mexico run up here and then they run back down when they get in trouble
[1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:48.720]  and they got different names and different IDs and so you got 100 million people south of the border
[1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:55.040]  their crooks come up here. So, you know, this is the type of stuff we're dealing with, I mean,
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:10:00.240]  did you know El Paso across the border now as a ghost town? Did you know Nuevo Laredo across
[1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:07.440]  from Laredo as a ghost town? The drug gangs, the crime, the all of it and this La Raza culture
[1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:12.080]  is really picked up because the media, the culture, the gringo-owned media pushes it.
[1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:15.200]  I mean, come on, put two of them together. Why does the rich gringo
[1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:22.880]  sell and push all this La Raza, La Reconquista? Because they want to break down the U.S.
[1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:30.000]  This is a triple team against the U.S. and the U.S. is falling. You want to get the U.S.?
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:35.120]  Don't worry, it's basically already gone, but what it's being replaced with is something far worse.
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:41.440]  Now, we've got all these clips, I mean, there's like 10 of them, but just play him talking about
[1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:45.520]  the plan of San Diego. This is the head of UT Chicano Studies. He's the head of the entire
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:53.600]  Chicano Studies Department. Here he is. If you go back and read. Back it up again. I'm at the
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:11:00.960]  plan of San Diego Park. And don't believe me, Google the plan of San Diego. That is to kill
[1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:06.560]  all whites, 16 and older. Now, then you go to a desiccée parade and there'll be green shirts
[1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:12.400]  that say plan of San Diego all over the place. Don't believe me. Go see. I mean, I'm the guy
[1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:14.880]  out bullhorn in the Klan. Folks have done it more than 10 times.
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:36.080]  And then it goes back to me on the TV show. Those are clips from my TV show.
[1:11:36.080 --> 1:11:39.280]  And then there's that other clip. Can you back up that other clip laughing about other gringos
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:43.200]  are all dying? And then it's got quotes from him from his textbooks where he says the blue-eyed
[1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:49.040]  devil is the greatest enemy. Wait, I wrote some notes off the off the New York Times about the
[1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:54.560]  whites must be killed. It's that earlier clip you found. It doesn't matter. How am I going to get
[1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:59.120]  the calls or play all this stuff if I just keep ranting? It just freaks me out. What got me going
[1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:04.720]  is the fact that people finally are listening. La Plaza. This is out of the LA Times today.
[1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:10.960]  Mexico reconquers California. Absolute drinks to that latest advertising campaign in Mexico
[1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:16.400]  from a Swedish vodka maker. Absolute promises to push the right button south of the border,
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:23.600]  but it could ruffle a few feathers in El Norte. That's the north. The billboard or old Mexico,
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:26.640]  the billboard and press campaign created by advertising agency.
[1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:35.680]  And now running in Mexico is a colorful map depicting what America might look like
[1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:41.440]  in an absolute IE perfect world. So that's what this ad campaign is what's ideal. The
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:47.280]  U.S.-Mexico border lies where it was before the Mexican-American war of 1848 when California,
[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:54.800]  as we know it, and the Mexican territory was known as Alte California. And the article limits
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:13:07.040]  it. No, it shows Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, Oregon, everything, Nevada. And it says Mexicans talk
[1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:11.360]  about how America stole their land. So this is their way of reclaiming it. It's very relevant,
[1:13:11.360 --> 1:13:16.640]  and Mexicans love the idea. Now that's the advertising campaign. The Swedes know what sells
[1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:22.880]  because this is a majority idea. And I say it's cheating. I say it's not fair play
[1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:31.760]  to have a secret gear up for a race war. And by the way, just look at AP photos of these marches
[1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:35.760]  the last two years saying, you know, legalize the illegal aliens and Bush pushing and saying,
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:40.640]  oh, they love America. Oh, the illegal aliens want to be friendly. And you look at the kids in
[1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:46.000]  school are wearing the same shirts that say either La Ricanquista, La Raza, or plan to San Diego.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:53.600]  He found it. Go ahead and roll it. We just have to survive. We have an aging white America.
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:14:01.360]  They are not making babies. They're dying. It's a matter of time.
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:09.680]  The explosion is in our population. All right, we'll come back.
[1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:16.400]  Oh, yeah, crank it up. I'd like to build the world a coke.
[1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:24.480]  But don't talk about it, or you're an evil white racist. There are quotes in this LA Times in the
[1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:28.960]  comments going, we're going to kill you, manifest destiny, all gringos will die. And somebody
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:35.200]  says, how dare you to the guy? And he goes, see, racist, you need to die. It's just like the
[1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:40.960]  Texas Civil Rights Review said, yes, they were wearing shirts saying that all whites should be
[1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:47.920]  killed. But the whites are evil. And this was a white person writing the article.
[1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:54.640]  I mean, don't talk about it. It's evil. See, you're an evil whitey.
[1:14:56.320 --> 1:15:02.720]  I'm saying I want to kill you and your family. And you say you don't like it. Your race is
[1:15:02.720 --> 1:15:09.280]  your bad. You're not good. Again, ladies and gentlemen, all I can do is tell the truth.
[1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:20.080]  That's all I can do. I'm sick of it. I'm tired of it. All right, I'm going to come back and take
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:24.800]  calls. Then I'm Aaron the Jesse Ventura and Charlton Heston interview. But I guess, hey,
[1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:40.080]  Charlton Heston, another dead white gringo, huh? Yay. Yay. Ah, they're dying. Good. Ah, oh, ah, we're
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:58.320]  right back. It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:04.560]  world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. But their objective being world domination.
[1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:11.200]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:15.680]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:24.080]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:27.920]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:31.680]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea.
[1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:35.040]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their

[1:16:54.400 --> 1:16:59.040]  Prices on food are getting so high. Warehouses are installing security systems and guards.
[1:16:59.040 --> 1:17:05.680]  You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food. We're all in a foot race as to whether the
[1:17:05.680 --> 1:17:11.920]  food will become so expensive we can't afford it or there will be no food at any price. We can't
[1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:16.880]  grow enough of our own food even with genetically altered trash. It will give you the opportunity
[1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:23.040]  to eat perfectly engineered food. They think God didn't get it right, so Monsanto had to step in.
[1:17:23.760 --> 1:17:28.320]  If you think it's a little bit crazy to put in a supply of food, it's okay. We won't tell.
[1:17:28.320 --> 1:17:40.000]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, eFoodsDirect.com. That's 800-409-5633. It may be a little bit crazy.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:44.080]  That's okay. Because there is no such thing as a little bit, dead.

[1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:08.000]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights. He's been branded
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:12.960]  by special interest groups as Dr. Noel, refusing to bend his values. I can only imagine the pressure
[1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:17.520]  applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles. He has given up a medical career for
[1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:23.040]  this. Ron Paul is running for president. The ideas of strong currency ending the war defending
[1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:28.240]  the Constitution and protecting civil liberties are catching on. As a thank you, GCNLive.com,

[1:20:01.840 --> 1:20:03.840]  Look, illegal aliens have a choice to make.
[1:20:03.840 --> 1:20:10.240]  Even if another 30 million or so come in, it will completely bankrupt all the states, the health care
[1:20:10.240 --> 1:20:15.840]  of the schools. It's already happened. And then they have no place for even themselves. That's why
[1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:20.000]  a lot of the illegals that get here after a few years agree on keeping the other illegals out.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:22.640]  There's six plus billion third world people. They all want to come here.
[1:20:24.400 --> 1:20:28.960]  We will be a third world nation. We also have to ask ourselves, what's better, the U.S. or
[1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:35.840]  Mexico? The U.S. is becoming corrupt, becoming third world. I mean, I just want to live in peace.
[1:20:37.120 --> 1:20:44.880]  Hey man, I like tequila and enchiladas and I like, you know, everybody. And I don't appreciate the
[1:20:44.880 --> 1:20:50.720]  fact that it's been popularized. I mean, it's really the majority view now. I'd say about 55-60%.
[1:20:51.280 --> 1:20:55.680]  And that's what absolute says. Absolute said, well, we did this because this is the majority view.
[1:20:55.680 --> 1:21:00.640]  And the people are in this LA Times story. It's a whole bunch of articles, but this one has hundreds
[1:21:00.640 --> 1:21:05.520]  and hundreds of comments saying, yeah, this is our country. This belongs to Mexico. Well,
[1:21:05.520 --> 1:21:10.800]  if Mexico's so great, why aren't you in where Mexico's been running things? You know, I don't like
[1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:15.440]  Mordito little bike that's now going on in Texas with the cops where they want to shake you down.
[1:21:15.440 --> 1:21:20.800]  I mean, I don't like that, folks. I don't go down to Mexico anymore because it's so anti-American
[1:21:20.800 --> 1:21:25.840]  down there. I mean, this is really sad. And I'm telling you, if all this anti-American stuff
[1:21:25.840 --> 1:21:31.360]  continues, I am not going to go to Mexico ever again, and I'm not going to support anything that
[1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:36.400]  has to do with it. And I'm going to, not that I drink because I go off and on drinking, but I
[1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:41.040]  drink very little and I don't drink a lot of hard liquor. That's certainly for sure. But a couple
[1:21:41.040 --> 1:21:46.320]  years and I'm out somewhere and somebody's serving vodka martinis, I'm not drinking any absolute
[1:21:46.320 --> 1:21:52.400]  vodka ever. And absolute is now apologized and is in deep trouble. Hey, it's over for you. Okay.
[1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:56.640]  The people know they're just not supposed to talk about it. The people have now found out about all
[1:21:56.640 --> 1:22:01.520]  this. And I know you think the new demographic is LaRica Conquista. So that's fine. You can just
[1:22:01.520 --> 1:22:08.320]  have fun with that. Okay, I've just blown the whole show on this, but you know, it's important and
[1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:16.320]  I mean, you can pick up the Spanish newspapers around here in Austin. It's full of racist,
[1:22:16.320 --> 1:22:23.200]  race, racial dribble. I'm tired of it, man. See, first we're told not to have any national identity
[1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:29.760]  and then we're told to be ashamed of who we are. And I mean, I'm 34 years old, folks. I grew up
[1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:37.920]  not doing anything to anybody. I grew up in Dallas where a couple times three or four black guys
[1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:41.760]  would come up and say, we're going to beat you up, honky. And I'd feel bad until they punched me and
[1:22:41.760 --> 1:22:46.400]  I had to go ahead and fight back. I was guilty to fight back against racist blacks. Now, are all
[1:22:46.400 --> 1:22:52.960]  blacks racist? No. But I mean, you know, there are racist blacks. There are racist Mexicans.
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:58.720]  There are racist Asians. To tell you the truth, the blacks and Hispanics really hate each other.
[1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:03.120]  I mean, why aren't we talking about all these real things that are going on? In the name of
[1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:07.440]  multiculturalism, they're training us all to be at each other's throats. Let's stop hating each
[1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:14.400]  other. And the answer would be, well, then don't talk about the plan from San Diego. Just wait till
[1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:20.240]  the killing starts, Gringo. No, that's stupid. And by the way, it's not because I'm afraid you'll
[1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:25.200]  really launch your plan of San Diego. It just shows the hatred. The government's built FEMA camps.
[1:23:25.200 --> 1:23:29.600]  Do you know what they said in 86, the FEMA camps before? They said they were going to wait for the
[1:23:29.600 --> 1:23:33.360]  illegal aliens to riot, which they're going to orchestrate. Then they're going to throw a bunch
[1:23:33.360 --> 1:23:41.520]  of you in prisons and then sell the racist white population who, if they weren't racist before,
[1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:47.760]  they're going to be now against going along with having martial law. And then they're going to put
[1:23:47.760 --> 1:23:52.240]  the real political distance in. Did you know that's been declassified? Did you know the little plan
[1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:55.600]  that they're setting you up? It's real cute and funny. You know what happened when you listened
[1:23:55.600 --> 1:23:59.760]  to the Germans in 1918 and you attacked Texas and killed all those people?
[1:23:59.760 --> 1:24:06.160]  Thousands of Mexicans were slaughtered. They sent the Texas Rangers in and they just
[1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:14.800]  massacred a bunch of people, which was wrong. You're being set up again. I don't want you
[1:24:14.800 --> 1:24:18.640]  to get killed. I don't want to get killed. I don't want to go to a FEMA camp, okay?
[1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:23.360]  Ted Turner says, we can only have one kid. They want a one-shot policy here.
[1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:26.800]  Do you know about eugenics? Do you know what they're doing to your food and water?
[1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:33.840]  Did you know that the Ford Foundation, Henry Ford, who funded Adolf Hitler and was the top Nazi
[1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:38.160]  agent in the U.S. next to Prescott Bush, Bush's grandfather? Did you know he funded you?
[1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:44.640]  Because it's the plan of San Diego. You're absolutely right. It is. It's very sophisticated.
[1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:51.920]  So I'm tired of feeling weird. I want to feel good around Hispanic people. They want to feel
[1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:58.960]  good around me. We want to do business together, live together, be friends, intermarry. The Czech
[1:24:58.960 --> 1:25:02.880]  and German communities all over Texas have intermarried with the Mexicans. They don't
[1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:05.840]  intermarry with each other. The Czechs and Poles and Germans, they don't intermarry,
[1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:10.400]  but they intermarry with the Mexicans. Nobody has anything against the Mexicans. 35% of the
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:17.120]  signers of the Texas Constitution. The guy that wrote it was Juan Navarro. A Mexican wrote
[1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:22.960]  Texas Constitution. You've got a big seat at the table here. You're Texan. How have you let them
[1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:31.600]  take your heritage? How have you let them steal it from you? Texas is a lot cooler than Mexico.
[1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:39.280]  Texas is a lot more macho than Mexico because it is. It's got the Mexican and the Spanish and the
[1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:47.760]  German and the French and the Native American and all of it mixed in. The black. It's a great place.
[1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:51.440]  I love Texas. God bless Texas. Let's be Texans.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:00.480]  And we can all drink tequila and wear big ol' sombreros. I don't care. Just stop talking about
[1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:07.200]  how and snickering about how you want to kill my family. I got video tape of 30,000 Mexicans
[1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:11.120]  while this guy's giving a speech about how he wants to kill us and they're cheering.
[1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:15.760]  That is scary, man. You go out to some toothless clan meeting. It's like 10 guys.
[1:26:17.040 --> 1:26:20.960]  Nobody supports them and they're not even talking about stuff like that. And they're pathetic.
[1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:24.720]  Meanwhile, you've got Fortune 500 funding this.
[1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:29.520]  You know, I said I'd take your calls and I got Charlton Heston coming up.
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:35.440]  Let's go to Ventura now. I'm going to come back and take calls and then get into.
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:41.200]  Ventura came on, hit AP, national TV, local TV, foreign television, picked it up. Ventura came
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:44.800]  on my show. 50 minutes of the interview during the break. He's like, Alex, I want to talk about
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:48.560]  9-11. We're going to put those behind the scenes clips, by the way up. And I said, okay, Jesse,
[1:26:48.560 --> 1:26:50.800]  I already interviewed you about about a year and a half ago. You think the government let
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:54.560]  it happen? He goes, no, they did it. I want to talk about it. And then he let it out. Here's Ventura.
[1:26:55.680 --> 1:26:59.200]  Governor Ventura, you've got the floor. Give us your take on 9-11.
[1:26:59.920 --> 1:27:04.480]  Well, first of all, Alex, let me state this, you know, being ex-military when the attack
[1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:10.240]  initially took place and I was governor, I went on a very focused tunnel vision mode that our
[1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:16.480]  country had been attacked and what the hell do we need to do to repel it. So I today take myself
[1:27:16.480 --> 1:27:22.800]  because at that point in time, I had a position of power. And if I would have, you know, not been
[1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:30.160]  the way I was, the way all of us were so shocked when it happened that in that position of power,
[1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:35.760]  I could have raised a lot more questions at that time about the things that went down that day.
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:40.480]  And where today, when I raised those questions, naturally, it doesn't quite have the impact
[1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:46.000]  that it would have had back then. But to me, it's questions that are not being answered and
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:52.800]  haven't been answered about 9-11. And, you know, first and foremost, I think is the fact that,
[1:27:52.800 --> 1:28:00.960]  okay, in New York City and Manhattan, two planes struck two buildings.
[1:28:06.240 --> 1:28:10.800]  I am back, ladies and gentlemen. I am back. You know, we're playing that off YouTube. We edited
[1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:14.800]  down the hour and 20 minute interview like 20 minutes. We're playing off YouTube and it's
[1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:20.320]  fully loaded and it's just, I think the computer lines they have in here. But I've noticed my
[1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:24.560]  computer lines at my house used to be fast and now they're slow. I think it's, I should start
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:31.920]  burning this on CD. You know what? We do have the interview with Heston on CD. So that will work
[1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:35.760]  nicely for you. It doesn't matter. We'll come back and play some more of it after the break.
[1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:40.320]  You can go to prisonplanet.com and watch the 20 minute boil down. Or we have an hour and 20
[1:28:40.320 --> 1:28:47.520]  minute MP3 up there that everybody can watch. Other Ventura interview, it was unbelievable.
[1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:53.440]  You got a bunch of other stuff too. Will. Hi, I'm David. And if you wake up at night to urinate
[1:28:53.440 --> 1:28:59.680]  like I was, then you'll want to take advantage of this special risk free offer. If you have dribbling,
[1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:05.040]  burning, or pain during or after urination, then you may have a condition known as benign
[1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:10.480]  prostate enlargement. This is potentially serious and can get worse with age. So get regular

[1:29:50.160 --> 1:29:55.360]  It's a fact. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States
[1:29:55.360 --> 1:30:00.240]  create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue with never ending late fees over the
[1:30:00.240 --> 1:30:04.960]  limit fees and higher and higher interest rates. It has become mathematically impossible to repay
[1:30:04.960 --> 1:30:09.920]  all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors. The federal debt relief system has created a
[1:30:09.920 --> 1:30:14.720]  successful attorney backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans,
[1:30:14.720 --> 1:30:18.560]  lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[1:30:18.560 --> 1:30:22.880]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment,
[1:30:22.880 --> 1:30:26.560]  ending with nothing on your credit report. Join the thousands of Americans who now
[1:30:26.560 --> 1:30:30.080]  breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[1:30:30.080 --> 1:30:34.720]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.

[1:33:32.320 --> 1:33:36.000]  I'm going to play some of that Ventura interview in the end of the show today.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:39.360]  We're going to go to the Charlton Heston piece in a second.
[1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:51.040]  It's good music. I am radical. There's a huge secret plan that's totally public
[1:33:51.040 --> 1:33:58.960]  to kill me and everybody else of a certain race and talking about it's evil. Let's go ahead
[1:33:58.960 --> 1:34:05.200]  and take calls here. Let's talk to Aaron in Iowa. Aaron, you're on the air. Thanks for holding
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:09.840]  while I've been ranting. Awesome. What's on your mind? First of all, I just want to say that I would
[1:34:09.840 --> 1:34:12.640]  go to the limit to call this an honor to be talking to you right now. I appreciate what you've been
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:15.760]  doing and what you have been doing. Well, thanks for putting up with me. What's on your mind?
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:21.680]  I have two things I want to talk about. A couple weeks ago, I was in one of my community
[1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:26.880]  college classes and the professor showed a Boeing for Columbine with Michael Moore.
[1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:33.120]  Yes, where Moore drives the setup, Heston. Yeah, where he ambushes him and he says that
[1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:38.640]  that Heston has never been a victim of any assault or any crime whatsoever. He was questioning why
[1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:44.000]  he would have a loaded gun in his house. I just wanted to say that.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:49.440]  Well, the establishment wants to disarm the people, so they pose as liberals. Once they've
[1:34:49.440 --> 1:34:53.840]  got us disarmed like they are in Mexico or Russia or Nazi Germany, we can be good little slaves.
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:34:59.920]  And what better way to ban our guns than to instigate some race war
[1:34:59.920 --> 1:35:04.880]  in the United States instead of us all living in peace? I mean, it might sound crazy to say,
[1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:10.640]  but the global elite have wide open borders to spark a revolution. No, that's what they want.
[1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:14.480]  And then the countries, they have handbooks on it, tear each other apart. I want to live in
[1:35:14.480 --> 1:35:18.800]  peace with everybody. Yeah, and you said earlier that people call you weak for being friendly.
[1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:23.360]  I mean, I'm sick and tired of that of people saying weak. No, no, that's the thing. You've
[1:35:23.360 --> 1:35:28.000]  got to act weak, be friendly, and be told we hate you, we don't want you. And then you can't even
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:33.600]  say, hey, that's mean because then you're racist if you do. When I was talking to Trey, he plays in
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:38.000]  a band and he says all the time and I've experienced it out at night. Folks will pull up and say,
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.520]  hey, gringo, we want to kill you. Come on, say something, do something. There'll be guns waving
[1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:46.160]  out windows. And it's just like, but if you get shot or stabbed or killed down six street,
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:51.760]  it's just, oh, somebody got killed. It's never racial. Well, it is. But see, it's okay to kill
[1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:57.920]  gringo. That's the only racial murders and killings allowed. And I'm sick of it. I am sick of it.
[1:35:57.920 --> 1:36:03.840]  I am tired of it. I don't call in my household, Mexicans, racist names. You understand that?
[1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:08.800]  I am above that. But that means I'm also above what they're doing. And that doesn't mean all.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.040]  Just like all whites don't need to be lumped in with the cooklox clan.
[1:36:13.920 --> 1:36:17.760]  But the cooklox clan's not being funded by HBO and absolute vodka.
[1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:23.680]  Let's go ahead and take another call here. Let's talk to Sean in Wisconsin. He says he's angry
[1:36:23.680 --> 1:36:29.600]  with me. Okay. Hey, Alex, actually, this is Sean's girlfriend, Jen. How are you doing today?
[1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:33.760]  Good. Thanks for holding while I went through that rant. Oh, it's quite all right, dude. I understand.
[1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:38.960]  Listen, I just want to say I really respect, you know, what you're doing here. And we've
[1:36:38.960 --> 1:36:41.280]  listened to yours. Well, that's okay. I mean, what do you disagree with me about?
[1:36:41.920 --> 1:36:48.240]  Oh, well, I guess I don't really disagree. I was just a little taken back when you were
[1:36:48.240 --> 1:36:55.120]  discussing Earth-based religions. And it's not that I know what you were getting at. But I do
[1:36:55.120 --> 1:37:00.640]  feel that I just, when the shit hits the fan, I don't want some... Ma'am,
[1:37:03.040 --> 1:37:06.400]  look, I don't want to hang up on you, but if you cuss, I got to hang up on you. Okay.
[1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:09.920]  The lady called in and I had to delay her out. Please don't email me saying,
[1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:16.320]  we didn't hear cussing. You're a liar. There's a delay. Okay, I delayed her out. Ma'am, I wanted
[1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:22.400]  to hear what you had to say. But you talked about the horsemaner hitting the oscillating device.
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:30.400]  And because I was talking about Earth-based religions wanting to exterminate 80% of the
[1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:38.400]  population, that is not what I said on Coast to Coast AM Thursday night with George Norrie in
[1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:44.640]  the first hour, in the news hour. What I said was is that the brand of Earth-based religion
[1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:51.280]  that Ted Turner and the UN follows, and Dr. Eric Pionka follows at UT, and he's on the UT website,
[1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:55.440]  dressed up like a druid talking about Lucifer. You cannot make this type stuff up. He's the one
[1:37:55.440 --> 1:37:59.600]  that says he wants 90% of us to die and get standing ovations at the Texas Academy of Sciences.
[1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:04.320]  I was on there because Ted Turner was saying too many people. We've got to forcibly only have,
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:08.960]  you know, one child. Well, he said it needs to be voluntary, but then that's how China started.
[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:14.640]  That's my point. That's what they're pushing. And so their brand of Earth-based religion says
[1:38:14.640 --> 1:38:19.600]  humans are bad, need to be killed. I know that a lot of the other brands of it don't say that.
[1:38:19.600 --> 1:38:25.120]  So just like there's different brands of Christianity that believe different things,
[1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:29.840]  I'm not going to get into a religious debate. So I was not saying that your brand of
[1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:37.840]  guy worship or whatever it is, or animism, is wanting to kill all the humans. But you can't
[1:38:37.840 --> 1:38:44.560]  ignore that in druid culture in Europe, which was degenerate, at least some of it was in my opinion,
[1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:47.920]  in the Aztec culture, again, I'm saying both cultures. You've got a white culture.
[1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:51.920]  You've got a Asian culture, and that's what they are. It's Asians that passed over the
[1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:57.600]  land bridge 35,000 years ago, cutting their children's hearts out for Earth as a sacrifice,
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:39:02.160]  I think is bad. Now, I know that most of the modern Earth worship stuff doesn't do that,
[1:39:02.160 --> 1:39:07.760]  but most Earth worship, even in the ancient Greeks, culminated in human sacrifice. Okay,
[1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:11.920]  now I think that's wrong. And you and documents talk about how they're pushing that.
[1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:19.280]  Let's go ahead and talk to Satanya in Oregon. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:39:19.280 --> 1:39:21.920]  Hi, Alex. Pleasure to talk to you.
[1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:22.800]  You bet. What's on your mind?
[1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:30.880]  A few weeks ago, you said something about Barack Obama not being confronted. Well,
[1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:37.840]  I'm 14. I decided to go down to a Corvallis town in here in Oregon, and Barack Obama was there,
[1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:42.080]  so I went and confronted him. Did you get some video of that? I didn't get a video.
[1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:45.200]  That's okay. It would be great to put it on YouTube. Yeah.
[1:39:45.200 --> 1:39:47.520]  So what you confront him about how he's pushing a one-world government?
[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:53.280]  Yeah, and about him being in the CFR. Well, that's the problem is that he doesn't have all the baggage
[1:39:53.280 --> 1:39:57.840]  of the other candidates, so you want to like him, and I like him as a person. The problem is he's
[1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:05.200]  handled by the very same people that handle Hillary. Yeah, well, he didn't really talk to me. I just
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:14.640]  started yelling at him, and it's pretty good. I talked to about 50 people, and a bunch of them
[1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:23.360]  knew about the boat fraud, and a few of them turned to Ron Paul. Well, good job. Yeah, and also,
[1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:31.280]  I wanted to say hi to someone. Okay, go ahead. Hi to my mom and you and Todd Keisha.
[1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:36.880]  Yeah. Okay, you're awesome. I love having the young people listen. You know, I wanted to talk about
[1:40:39.840 --> 1:40:42.480]  Chuck Heston, Charlton Heston for like 30 minutes today,
[1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:46.720]  and I'm just not going to have time to do it. And then next week, nobody's going to care. People
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:50.880]  forget about folks that die. It's just that I interviewed him. I talked to him a few times
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:54.960]  off air. He was such a gentleman, so nice. He really didn't care about the Second Amendment.
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:59.680]  The NRA is compromised, does compromise, but I'm not going to blame Charlton Heston for that. He
[1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:06.160]  really did help educate folks about the Second Amendment. And he is a dead now, of course,
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:11.520]  died last night, clearly complications from Alzheimer's. He had pneumonia last year and almost
[1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:18.560]  died. And just such an icon, just such a, but he was in the civil rights movement.
[1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:25.440]  Back in the early 60s, when it was unpopular to do it, he got boycotted over it. A lot of things
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:29.840]  happened. And then he got called names and attacked by the quote left because he said, well, I'm still
[1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:34.800]  for civil rights and it's our right to own guns to defend ourselves. And he did so many other
[1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:43.040]  great things. And he's dead. He's gone on. And so I'm going to come back and play a little bit of that.
[1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:49.360]  What an amazing week this week. Chuck Heston died. And then, of course, I interviewed
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:54.960]  Jesse Ventura, some of the other things he broke on my show, that he over 20 publishers refused
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:58.640]  his book, even though he'd had three other best sellers, New York Times best sellers,
[1:41:58.640 --> 1:42:04.080]  because it did criticize the government. He said it was mockingbird. He also talked about the CIA
[1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:10.720]  covertly trying to basically take over his administration. His first week in office as
[1:42:10.720 --> 1:42:16.880]  governor, there were 23 CIA people in the basement of his office there in the clandestine op that
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:21.360]  was illegal. Every major city's run by there on the narcotics, everything. He broke that on the
[1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:27.200]  show. He also talked about how Obama, that the people will try to assassinate him if he's for
[1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:32.000]  real. And he really tries to get us out of this war. That's some of the stuff that Jesse Ventura
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:37.200]  talked about. Again, that interview was up on prisonplanet.com. We'll come back, play a Chuck
[1:42:37.200 --> 1:42:52.240]  Heston clip, maybe take a few calls. Stay with us. Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The
[1:42:52.240 --> 1:42:56.800]  forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide. But in Liberty's darkest
[1:42:56.800 --> 1:43:01.200]  hour, there is hope. The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:43:01.200 --> 1:43:05.360]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding
[1:43:05.360 --> 1:43:09.680]  of the New World Order master plan. We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize
[1:43:09.680 --> 1:43:15.280]  the people to meet this threat. In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle

[1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:57.600]  Von Scheich with the White Paper Comicals. Mr. Steve Schenck with his fearless radio program
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:03.280]  is correct when he says the solution to our difficult times is to store food and get healthy.
[1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:08.240]  My comrades and I of the media don't want you to panic. We, unlike fearless radio,
[1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:13.920]  try not to tell you about the food control legislation. Hurricane Katrina, the American famine,
[1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:18.960]  families unable to buy food. If we told you that solution to all these problems is food,
[1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:24.400]  you'd panic and run out and buy up food before it disappeared or you couldn't afford it. You'd
[1:44:24.400 --> 1:44:29.520]  completely mess up the perfect strategy for population control and then kick us out of the
[1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:36.000]  Survivors Club. You are a sissy chicken if you call JMS eFoodsDirect.com and order food.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:46.160]  This is Steve. Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633. You'd be considered a little
[1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:52.720]  bit crazy, but there's no such thing as a little bit, dead. America needs Ron Paul. He needs your
[1:44:52.720 --> 1:44:58.480]  support. The time is now. As long as he has your support, he will continue to fight until the very
[1:44:58.480 --> 1:45:02.720]  end. We know that many people would like to show their support, but want to do it on a larger
[1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:08.800]  scale. RonPaulFlags.com produces the most beautiful flags dedicated to electing the only man fit to

[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:58.240]  and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than
[1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:02.640]  when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and
[1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:08.080]  others are absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold
[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:13.280]  water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron and it inhibits the growth
[1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:19.520]  of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000
[1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:23.920]  gallons or one year, whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment
[1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:29.120]  facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria. What about you?

[1:47:08.080 --> 1:47:11.120]  show but if I expand the number of hours I do hear my wife will probably kill me.
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:22.560]  And I drag my ugly hind in here on Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m. Central, 5 to 7 Eastern, do the show live,
[1:47:23.280 --> 1:47:32.000]  2 to 4 Pacific. I want to leave the mountain now, 3 to 5 mountain. I want everybody to know,
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:37.680]  I love y'all. I mean, who can look at a little white child, a black child, a Hispanic child,
[1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:43.440]  an Asian child and not want them to have great opportunities and a great life? Who?
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:52.640]  No, I care about everybody. But see, that's race is such a power because then when other people
[1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:58.240]  are racist to you and I know people have been real racist to the Mexicans and so now they get real
[1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:05.360]  racist. That's just how it works but the point is we got to stop this someday and this ignoring
[1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:12.400]  what's happened with the LaRica Conquista crowd has let it really develop and grow and get big.
[1:48:14.080 --> 1:48:18.960]  And it's very destructive. You know, it's all coming out now and what it's going to do is it's
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:26.240]  going to hurt a lot of Hispanic businesses because whites, blacks and others aren't going to know
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:32.800]  if they're welcome and aren't going to know if they're wanted there. I know that, you know,
[1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:36.720]  I go places sometimes and it's not welcome now and I just don't come back and I remember hearing
[1:48:36.720 --> 1:48:40.320]  that black folks always feeling not welcome at restaurants. Maybe they were paranoid sometimes,
[1:48:40.320 --> 1:48:46.880]  maybe they were right some of the time. I mean, I'm starting to experience that. It's really sad.
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:51.760]  Okay, look, here's Chuck Heston. It's a 20 minute interview. I'm only going to play about five minutes
[1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:55.840]  of it. Sometime during the week, probably tomorrow, I'm going to air the whole thing on the weekday
[1:48:55.840 --> 1:48:59.040]  show. I've got a big announcement I'm making by the way in the second hour tomorrow. You'll be able
[1:48:59.040 --> 1:49:04.720]  to see it in text by 1230 tomorrow in the afternoon. It will be posted up on info wars.com. Huge
[1:49:04.720 --> 1:49:10.400]  announcement. We'll just let you see what that is. But right now here is a Charlton Heston,
[1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:25.200]  my interview with him seven years ago, January 18 2001. And again, you can also read the transcript
[1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:35.360]  of the interview up on info wars.com. Here is Chuck Heston who died yesterday at 84 in Los Angeles.
[1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:40.320]  And I don't say that lightly. I mean, everybody knows who Charlton Heston is,
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:46.560]  and it really made the socialist in the culture wars. Mr. Heston calls it angry when he stepped
[1:49:46.560 --> 1:49:51.280]  up at the plate a couple years ago back into the Second Amendment fight. And now his new book is
[1:49:51.280 --> 1:49:56.800]  Amazing, The Courage to Be Free. Mr. Heston, thank you for joining us today. Well, thank you for
[1:49:56.800 --> 1:50:01.680]  loaning me your audience. It's a pleasure to talk to you. You bet. Why did you decide to get back
[1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:07.200]  really involved in the Second Amendment fight at the forefront and to write this new book, The Courage
[1:50:07.200 --> 1:50:11.920]  to Be Free? Well, of course, I've been involved with the Second Amendment. You could say since I
[1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:21.520]  was a little kid shooting a deer up in Michigan. But then I became involved more seriously with the
[1:50:21.520 --> 1:50:28.480]  Bill of Rights. And I came to see the importance of defending every one of the 12 articles of the
[1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:35.120]  Bill of Rights, of which the second is the right to keep and bear arms. And we had a lot of success
[1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:43.280]  with it in the last election. It was an interesting thing. The president last April felt that this
[1:50:43.280 --> 1:50:54.640]  would be a good time to take down the NRA. And he made a couple of brief radio addresses about it
[1:50:54.640 --> 1:51:03.200]  and so on. But he realized it wasn't going to fly. And so he abandoned it. And of course, what he
[1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:11.440]  didn't realize as we found ourselves rather amazed to find when I was campaigning through
[1:51:11.440 --> 1:51:20.720]  what eight different states and several different cities. And what the president has not realized
[1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:30.560]  is not just the NRA. The NRA has what, just under 5,000 members now. I'm sorry, 5 million.
[1:51:30.560 --> 1:51:45.600]  And we campaigned on this issue in part because of course, as again, the president did not realize
[1:51:45.600 --> 1:51:53.920]  that an overwhelming proportion of people in this country are hunters. Of course they are. This is
[1:51:53.920 --> 1:52:00.240]  hunting country. The whole continent is a hunting continent. Except for New York City and LA,
[1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:10.400]  of course. And we had enormous success. We would gather crowds. Flint, Michigan, I think was the
[1:52:10.400 --> 1:52:19.040]  biggest one. We had a rally at 7 o'clock in the morning, which meant people who were going to
[1:52:19.040 --> 1:52:29.120]  work of course, driving to work, had to get up to come at 6 o'clock. And we had over 3,000 people
[1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:37.760]  in some different venues. And in every case, the Second Amendment won the day. It was quite
[1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:44.560]  surprising, I have to say. Well, we see the mainstream media that controlled propaganda arms
[1:52:44.560 --> 1:52:50.400]  is what I call them. And I think they've shown themselves to deserve that title, convincing
[1:52:50.400 --> 1:52:54.960]  a lot of people that the average American isn't for the Second Amendment. But if you can explain
[1:52:54.960 --> 1:52:59.520]  to people the basics of how it's there to defend us from the street thug, the government thug,
[1:52:59.520 --> 1:53:05.520]  or to put food on the table, not to mention just as a sporting enjoyment and heritage,
[1:53:05.520 --> 1:53:10.960]  most people are actually for it. John Ashcroft right now, they're trying to confirm him. I think
[1:53:10.960 --> 1:53:18.560]  he would be a good... I think he will be confirmed. I think he will make a fine attorney general,
[1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:24.320]  certainly a far better one than Janet Reno. Absolutely. That wouldn't be too hard to do.
[1:53:24.320 --> 1:53:30.720]  But Mr. Kennedy, who I really don't think has any room to talk with all the skeletons in his
[1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:36.560]  closet, began to attack... There is no one in the U.S. Senate that has more skeletons in his
[1:53:36.560 --> 1:53:42.720]  closet than Kennedy. He should be ashamed of himself. He really should. I worked for his older
[1:53:42.720 --> 1:53:51.200]  brother. I voted for him. I campaigned for him. But Teddy Kennedy is another piece of work entirely.
[1:53:51.200 --> 1:54:00.400]  But anyway, to return to this, the question of the Second Amendment, there are, for example,
[1:54:00.400 --> 1:54:08.320]  now 41 states that have concealed carry laws, meaning that if you pass a background check,
[1:54:08.320 --> 1:54:14.640]  show that you have no felony convictions of any kind, show that you demonstrate that you know
[1:54:14.640 --> 1:54:23.520]  how to use a firearm safely, you can then get a permit to carry a concealed carry weapon under
[1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:29.520]  your arm or wherever. And not something I don't want to do because I don't fear it. I've used too
[1:54:29.520 --> 1:54:35.680]  many pistols in too many movies. They're kind of heavy to carry. But anyway, the point is that in
[1:54:35.680 --> 1:54:46.080]  every one of the 42 states where there is a concealed carry laws, one, the murder rate,
[1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:52.000]  the crime rate, two, never mind the murder rate, the crime rate has dropped significantly,
[1:54:52.560 --> 1:54:59.120]  significantly in every one of those states. Why? Because, of course, most people who have this
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:05.040]  permit don't carry all the time. But the point is the bad guys don't know who's carrying and who
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:10.720]  isn't. So that is, of course, you don't need to have to carry them. Now, again, ladies and
[1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:13.920]  gentlemen, we're talking to Charlton Heston. His new book will tell you how to get it in just
[1:55:13.920 --> 1:55:18.560]  a second. The Courage to Be Free. It's powerful. I read about half of it this morning. Well, thank
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:22.800]  you. I just got it in yesterday. But going back to the Ashcroft thing, because it ties into the
[1:55:22.800 --> 1:55:28.160]  Second Amendment. It does indeed. Kennedy attacked him on the Second Amendment because, of course,
[1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:31.840]  Ashcroft is pro-Second Amendment, pro-Constitution Bill of Rights. And he said,
[1:55:31.840 --> 1:55:36.640]  how dare you say that these guns are here to defend us from tyranny and government? Well,
[1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:43.280]  it turned out that Ashcroft's actual quote was basically paraphrasing Thomas Jefferson. So,
[1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:49.920]  how dare Kennedy? Any comments on that? You know, I have to say, much as I admired his big brother,
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:56.480]  I think Teddy Kennedy is one of the worst members of the U.S. Senate.
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:56:00.880]  You know what? Tomorrow, I'm going to air all 20 minutes of the interview on a weekday show.
[1:56:00.880 --> 1:56:04.720]  You'll be able to hear it there. This is nowhere on the web. This interview is forgotten, lost.
[1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:11.040]  It has now been found. I dug through heaps of CDs and things angrily today at the office and found it.
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:17.680]  Now, remember, Ashcroft hadn't been confirmed. Bush wasn't even in office yet. Remember, Bush
[1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:22.960]  officially got into office January 22nd. This is four days before Bush got in. We had to show I've
[1:56:22.960 --> 1:56:28.400]  been fair. I was thinking, you know, Jen, I mean, Ashcroft talked about Clinton spying on people
[1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:33.200]  without warrants, how evil he was, how the second was absolute. And then he got in there and now
[1:56:33.200 --> 1:56:38.400]  Bush has tried to pass gun bills. So kind of embarrassing me in the hindsight after about
[1:56:38.400 --> 1:56:45.120]  bad Ashcroft turned out to be. But I tried to give Bush benefit of the down and it turned out
[1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:48.720]  very, very bad indeed. But we get into a bunch of other police state new order issues
[1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:54.080]  in the 15 minutes or so that you haven't heard. And we'll also be posting that on YouTube in
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:58.640]  the next few days in its entirety with some images that will be up on info wars.com and
[1:56:58.640 --> 1:57:05.920]  prisonplanet.com. Sorry to all the callers. Next weekend, I'll take more calls. I promise.
[1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:12.640]  I did the last few weeks, but today we just had too much news. And to everybody out there,
[1:57:12.640 --> 1:57:17.040]  there are just a few thousand global elitists. They are trying to keep us all with each other's
[1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:23.600]  throats divide in Congress so they can control us. And I'm begging everybody out there, whether
[1:57:23.600 --> 1:57:28.400]  you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, it doesn't matter. Big foundations, big money in the name
[1:57:28.400 --> 1:57:33.920]  of multiculturalism are actually trying to turn us against each other so that we can basically
[1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:38.400]  fight with each other so the elite can rule over us. Let's stop that today. And let's keep the
[1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:42.560]  United States sovereign. And let's let next. Hi, this is Ted Anderson over the years. Genesis

[1:58:40.320 --> 1:58:46.000]  All you men out there, you need to listen up. By the age of 60, one in two men already have
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:51.680]  a prostate related health issue. What does this mean? It might be an enlarged prostate difficulty
[1:58:51.680 --> 1:58:57.440]  going to the bathroom and a diminished sex drive. Not a pretty picture. If you're a man, you need
[1:58:57.440 --> 1:59:02.160]  to give your body nutrition to support prostate health. There's no question about it. Many people
[1:59:02.160 --> 1:59:06.880]  hear this and they might think Saul Palmetto, but there's something so much better out there.
[1:59:06.880 --> 1:59:12.640]  It's called beta prostate and it contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols than ordinary
[1:59:12.640 --> 1:59:18.720]  Saul Palmetto. So before you try anything else, try beta prostate. Ignoring your prostate is not
[1:59:18.720 --> 1:59:24.000]  going to make the problems go away. Taking beta prostate is guaranteed to provide effective,
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:32.960]  all-natural support. Dial 1-800-457-9914. That's 1-800-457-9914. Call now and find out how you
