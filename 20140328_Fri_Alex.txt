[00:00.000 --> 00:12.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.320 --> 00:22.400]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:22.400 --> 00:26.560]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex today but he's
[00:26.560 --> 00:31.920]  going to be joining us at noon to talk about some amazing developments in the war between
[00:31.920 --> 00:37.760]  authentic media and mainstream phony media we're also going to be joined by paul joes of watson
[00:37.760 --> 00:42.960]  and jeryl salenti and anthony gucciani we've got a heavy show today there's a lot of news
[00:42.960 --> 00:47.760]  now paul joes of watson is going to be talking to us about what happened with this turkish
[00:48.480 --> 00:53.920]  youtube video that went up they actually recorded some turkish government and defense officials
[00:53.920 --> 01:00.160]  talking and planning a false flag so they could get into a war with syria they're going to attack
[01:00.160 --> 01:05.840]  their own country and of course once it went up on youtube the turkish governments approached that
[01:05.840 --> 01:10.720]  was the same as it was about a week ago when they took down all of twitter access to turkey they
[01:10.720 --> 01:16.320]  censored youtube access to turkey that was all the mainstream media talked about what they didn't
[01:16.320 --> 01:23.280]  talk about was the false flag they want to avoid talking about false flags at all costs and anybody
[01:23.280 --> 01:29.200]  who talks about a false flag is demonized but it's the way they operate it's the same way they
[01:29.200 --> 01:34.240]  operate when they come up with a patriot act that is anything but patriot that's that spies on everyone
[01:34.240 --> 01:39.760]  or the affordable care act which is anything but affordable it's one of their methods that they use
[01:39.760 --> 01:44.560]  over and over again and it's about time people started waking up and looking at this and of course
[01:44.560 --> 01:50.320]  turkey has a long history of being involved in nato false flags as siebel edmunds pointed out
[01:50.320 --> 01:54.560]  they were very much involved with operation gladio even though that took place in idli
[01:55.200 --> 02:00.800]  they used gangsters from turkey people that she said were referred to in turkey as babas in other
[02:00.800 --> 02:06.000]  words godfathers you know that's kind of the term for a paternal father there we've also
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.480]  got information about the hobby lobby case that is coming up for arguments in the supreme court
[02:10.480 --> 02:15.840]  they heard arguments a couple of days ago they're now considering that there was amazing developments
[02:15.840 --> 02:21.520]  in that amazing comments by some of the supreme court justices and we want to also take a look
[02:21.520 --> 02:26.640]  at some of the comments of people like john stewart where are they coming from and we want to look at
[02:26.640 --> 02:33.520]  what hobby lobby says themselves about that also the ukraine and the imf the deal is now on the
[02:33.520 --> 02:39.360]  table but the ukraine is not taking it of course the guy they put in charge yachts as victoria
[02:39.360 --> 02:44.560]  newland likes to call him yachts and yoke the guy that was the hand-picked guy for the imf for the
[02:44.560 --> 02:50.640]  globalists for the money bankers he took the deal but the parliament took a look at it and said i
[02:50.640 --> 02:55.680]  don't know that we'd like an austerity program like greece and like spain so maybe there's some hope
[02:55.680 --> 03:00.880]  there for self-government in the ukraine as these people struggle like we all do between these two
[03:00.880 --> 03:05.680]  rapacious gangs that are attacking us from each side but we're going to be talking about that
[03:06.240 --> 03:10.720]  gerald salenti is going to have information about bankers suicides as well as he'll be wanting to
[03:10.720 --> 03:15.600]  talk to us about russia and the ukraine the imf we have anthony gucciardi covering some breaking
[03:15.600 --> 03:22.000]  health news nuclear issues as well as information about gmo you know they'd like to demonize
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.920]  latin mere putin but he came out and said we're not going to let gmo get to the russian people
[03:28.720 --> 03:34.080]  the same day we saw the same thing coming from brazil they're shutting down gmo for their people
[03:34.080 --> 03:38.800]  just earlier this week france made the same pronouncement they said we're not going to those
[03:38.800 --> 03:44.160]  there's one gmo corn strain that's authorized in the european union and they're going to shut
[03:44.160 --> 03:49.600]  that down before planting season this year so we've got france brazil russia people who are
[03:49.600 --> 03:54.720]  looking out for the interests of their people what's happening in america well in america they
[03:54.720 --> 03:58.560]  just keep dumping the fluoride into the water even though it's been outlawed in many european
[03:58.560 --> 04:04.800]  countries they keep on bringing in the gmo they're totally in control of the government these
[04:04.800 --> 04:10.160]  corporations like monsanto and others is simply about profit we've got an article on info war
[04:10.160 --> 04:15.520]  today about a young high school girl who took did a science project and took some seafood
[04:15.520 --> 04:20.240]  and measured it with geiger counters and she found some amazing results that were many many
[04:20.240 --> 04:24.480]  times higher than the safe level that the government had said was safe but of course
[04:24.480 --> 04:28.800]  the canadian government stopped looking at radiation and food quite some time ago
[04:28.800 --> 04:33.760]  so you've got a high school student science project can do a better job than the fda or the
[04:33.760 --> 04:39.920]  canadian food safety inspectors that's pretty amazing but of course according to checkie schumer
[04:40.880 --> 04:45.920]  you as individuals you as bloggers you as a high school student shouldn't be allowed to do these
[04:45.920 --> 04:50.320]  types of things you're not a real journalist you know real journalists are people who offer us

[08:43.440 --> 08:48.320]  welcome back to the info wars radio program alex jones radio program he's going to be joining us at
[08:48.320 --> 08:53.760]  the top of the hour i was just handed a piece of paper from kurt nimo i was talking in the first
[08:53.760 --> 08:59.520]  segment about how the ukrainian parliament had rejected the imf offer that was put on the table
[09:00.160 --> 09:04.320]  now it appears that they have conceded to this and he correctly points out that it's
[09:04.880 --> 09:09.440]  an imf looting plan now let's get a little bit of background on this the last couple of days it
[09:09.440 --> 09:14.640]  was on again and off again first it was accepted by the ukrainian prime minister yatsenyuk who is a
[09:14.640 --> 09:20.160]  globalist puppet and he was the guy you remember that victoria newland was talking to the guy she
[09:20.160 --> 09:25.680]  likes to call yats their man on the inside of course he accepted the deal from the imf but
[09:25.680 --> 09:29.840]  the legislature balked initially so they didn't want it but after they applied some pressure
[09:29.840 --> 09:34.080]  overnight i guess they went for it this is the way reuters reported on it the last couple of days
[09:34.080 --> 09:39.760]  they say ukraine wins an imf lifeline as russia faces a growth slump really i would say it's more
[09:39.760 --> 09:45.120]  like a hangman's noose they said ukraine won a 27 billion dollar international financial lifeline
[09:45.120 --> 09:49.760]  on thursday rushed through in the wake of russia's annexation of the Crimea love how they love to keep
[09:49.760 --> 09:57.840]  calling it an annexation they seceded from ukraine which had seceded from russia so if the ukrain's
[09:57.840 --> 10:02.400]  secession was not legitimate or if it was legitimate as they want to maintain it was then of course the
[10:02.400 --> 10:09.440]  Crimean secession would be legitimate but anyway they say that the that the russians are imploding and
[10:09.440 --> 10:13.520]  this is the way it was reported by reuters in another article they said the ukraine's new leaders
[10:13.520 --> 10:17.600]  in a step that ousted the government that it balked at said wednesday it would raise the price of
[10:17.600 --> 10:23.360]  gas for domestic consumers by more than 50 cents 50 percent i'm sorry from they first and would
[10:23.360 --> 10:30.080]  raise prices further under a fixed timetable to 2018 so they're going to take control of the gas
[10:30.080 --> 10:36.240]  pipelines they're going to raise the price of energy for the ukrainians 50 percent and that's
[10:36.240 --> 10:41.200]  what they were rejecting they're rejecting that as well as other issues way back a month or two
[10:41.200 --> 10:47.440]  ago we had a report from forbes they were quoting vladimir signorelli from britain wood's research
[10:47.440 --> 10:52.880]  in new jersey he said yatsenyuk is the kind of technocrat you want if you want austerity
[10:52.880 --> 10:57.680]  he's got a veneer of professionalism he's a kind of guy who can hobnob with the european elite
[10:57.680 --> 11:04.000]  a mario monti type unelected and willing to do the imf's bidding and now we see that's what they've
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.840]  done of course the u.s senate's been pushing this austerity package for the ukrainian people
[11:08.480 --> 11:13.680]  wanting to turn them into greece and spain and of course mario monti the guy they're talking about
[11:13.680 --> 11:18.560]  that's the guy they put in charge in idly and as nigel forange pointed out he said you're putting
[11:18.560 --> 11:25.520]  in goldman sacks bankers in charge of countries and you're taking out democratically elected
[11:25.520 --> 11:30.560]  representatives prime ministers and that's what it appears is going to be happening in the ukraine
[11:30.560 --> 11:35.440]  as well we've got a busy show today we've got as i said before alex jones is going to be joining us
[11:35.440 --> 11:42.000]  at noon he's going to be talking about msnbc getting really desperate their ratings dropped
[11:42.000 --> 11:48.080]  24 percent in the last measurement from neilson so they're basically going on the warpath they
[11:48.080 --> 11:56.160]  tried to justify this state representative that dan bedondi asked a question about gun control
[11:56.160 --> 12:01.680]  he asked him whether or not it's constitutional yo if you ask a democrat uh they're about gun
[12:01.680 --> 12:06.400]  control and he says f you i guess that's kind of like when they talked to nancy polosi and they
[12:06.400 --> 12:11.760]  said what's the constitutional justification for obama care and she kind of stopped and said
[12:11.760 --> 12:18.000]  are you serious yeah you know we are serious we want to know what's your authority to do this
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.920]  that's something that's a discussion we ought to have but of course msnbc says that that was
[12:21.920 --> 12:27.760]  justified simply because dan bedondi is the guy that went to the boston bombing and confronted
[12:27.760 --> 12:34.080]  them about a false flag so you can't talk about false flags when we had news released just yesterday
[12:34.080 --> 12:38.800]  about a false flag in turkey the mainstream media didn't talk about that all they talked about was
[12:38.800 --> 12:44.000]  how turkey censored the entire internet uh sorry not the entire internet but the entire youtube
[12:44.560 --> 12:50.720]  to keep that video from being taken down they did that to twitter the week before they have these
[12:50.720 --> 12:54.640]  massive censorship things but they don't talk about why they're censoring it it's the same
[12:54.640 --> 13:01.520]  sort of thing we see with leaks from wiki leaks and from snowden documents instead of addressing
[13:01.520 --> 13:06.000]  the criminal activity that's being exposed by these whistleblowers and that's what this video
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.000]  that was put up on youtube that's what it was it was exposure of these guys criminally plotting a
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.360]  false flag attack attacking their own men with missiles attacking their own territory with
[13:17.360 --> 13:23.440]  missiles and doing it so they could start a war this is a strategy that governments have continually
[13:23.440 --> 13:29.280]  used apologize if watson had an article on this yesterday he analyzed how the mainstream media
[13:29.280 --> 13:33.600]  reported this how they covered it up for turkey and we're going to be talking about that we're
[13:33.600 --> 13:38.000]  going to be talking about turkey's involvement with nato how they've been involved in the past
[13:38.000 --> 13:44.400]  with nato false flags how they're now apparently the best hope that nato and the united states has
[13:44.400 --> 13:48.640]  for starting a war with syria we know that they've been wanting to do that for quite some time
[13:48.640 --> 13:52.720]  we're also going to have gerald salenti on the show he's going to be talking about i'm sure he'll
[13:52.720 --> 13:58.480]  want to talk about this imf ukrainian situation he's also going to talk about the banker suicides
[13:58.480 --> 14:03.680]  a whole host of issues about the economy that gerald salenti coming up we also have anthony
[14:03.680 --> 14:07.840]  gucciardi he's going to be talking to us about health issues but one of the stories that i wanted
[14:07.840 --> 14:14.880]  to cover in this sector is hobby lobby now they've been having arguments before the supreme court
[14:14.880 --> 14:21.040]  this week and that's where they argue the side and the justices asked them questions it's pretty
[14:21.040 --> 14:25.920]  amazing to see some of the questions and it's pretty amazing to look at the media's response
[14:25.920 --> 14:29.840]  to this entire case we're going to take a look at john stewart's response to that first we're
[14:29.840 --> 14:34.880]  going to look at what slate is talking about they say is the contraception contraception mandate
[14:34.880 --> 14:40.400]  doomed they say it certainly looks that way after the hobby lobby argument they're not very optimistic
[14:40.400 --> 14:44.560]  that they're going to get their way on this but you know if you've got a government that says uh
[14:44.560 --> 14:48.640]  you didn't build it i guess that same government says you can't control it now what's at stake here
[14:48.640 --> 14:53.680]  of course is hobby lobby most people know hobby lobby they're a very large company but they started
[14:53.680 --> 15:00.720]  as a family business and these people have grown it's the same generation that started it but i
[15:00.720 --> 15:06.480]  guess they should lose their rights because they incorporated see if they don't have first amendment
[15:06.480 --> 15:11.520]  rights just because they started a business then maybe they don't have fourth amendment rights
[15:11.520 --> 15:16.320]  or sixth amendment rights maybe you know the government can just barge in on any business
[15:16.320 --> 15:21.440]  and grab their records or maybe they can spy on people or maybe not give them due process
[15:21.440 --> 15:27.280]  this oh wait that's right we don't have those rights either do we see if they don't respect the first
[15:27.280 --> 15:30.640]  amendment they're not going to respect the rest of them if they can say that because of certain
[15:30.640 --> 15:37.520]  circumstances you can't speak you don't have the right to have principles that you want to organize
[15:37.520 --> 15:41.200]  your business around you don't have the right to make those decisions because the government
[15:41.200 --> 15:47.440]  owns it this is a fascism of the left and we see this coming out in spades now the other company
[15:47.440 --> 15:52.960]  that's involved is a conestoga wood it's a cabinet making company that's run by a menonite family so
[15:52.960 --> 15:58.880]  you've got these christian families who don't want to provide abortion coverage to their employees
[15:58.880 --> 16:04.960]  but obama is mandating that and of course obama is our dictator he can tell us anything he wants
[16:04.960 --> 16:10.160]  and of course he can change obama care the affordable care act at will we've seen how many
[16:10.160 --> 16:15.120]  times he's changed the dates how many times he's changed the terms of it and he just does it by
[16:15.120 --> 16:19.200]  executive order i don't know why he even needed the congress in the first place they said they
[16:19.200 --> 16:23.120]  didn't know what was in it they were gonna pass it and find out later well it doesn't really matter
[16:23.120 --> 16:28.080]  what's in it because obama is going to change it as he sees fit but listen to some of the comments
[16:28.080 --> 16:33.040]  when they argued this before the supreme court now this is coming from the women at the supreme court
[16:33.040 --> 16:37.680]  and that was the real gist of the story from slate they said it looks like we're not going to win in
[16:37.680 --> 16:42.080]  this hobby lobby case it looks like we're not going to be able to override the first amendment
[16:42.080 --> 16:48.240]  but the good news is that we've got women appointed who are speaking out there's finally a women's
[16:48.240 --> 16:52.560]  team on the high court and we can see that they're doing this because they're standing up for abortion
[16:53.120 --> 16:59.120]  no they're not feminists they're just abortionists listen to some of these questions justice sotomayor
[16:59.120 --> 17:04.160]  and justice kagan asked well because nobody is forcing hobby lobby or conestoga to provide
[17:04.160 --> 17:10.720]  health insurance they can simply pay the tax instead how does that help the people see they're
[17:10.720 --> 17:16.000]  trying to make an argument later on the same justice kagan says that the employees are quite
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.520]  tangibly harmed by not having abortion coverage but then she says hey it's no problem if the
[17:21.520 --> 17:25.680]  company just wants to pay the tax that's not a problem so she doesn't have a problem with those
[17:25.680 --> 17:31.440]  employees being quite tangibly harmed they could just pay the tax but then later she says that's a
[17:31.440 --> 17:38.480]  real injustice now they also said what would happen if we allowed them to get away with this
[17:38.480 --> 17:44.240]  exemption see this is the real concern of dictators and they said this is a quote everything would
[17:44.240 --> 17:51.280]  just be piecemeal nothing would be uniform see we need uniformity we need to be able to take their
[17:51.280 --> 17:56.960]  mandates but i guess the thing that bothered me even more than these justices incredible
[17:56.960 --> 18:04.400]  comments and the arguments was john stewart's reaction to this he parodied this and this is
[18:04.400 --> 18:07.680]  some of the stuff he said you may be thinking that a private corporation suing over its religious
[18:07.680 --> 18:13.760]  belief sounds asinine and john stewart explained that last night as well indeed he couldn't believe
[18:13.760 --> 18:18.240]  that they would have a company that would be operating on biblical principles what kind of
[18:18.240 --> 18:24.480]  biblical principles could a corporation be operating on and he called it jesus christ
[18:24.480 --> 18:32.000]  superstores what he called hobby lobby now he says it's founded on biblical principles you know
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.320]  they really are founded on biblical principles they really do have principles whether or not
[18:36.320 --> 18:41.280]  they're biblical or not whether or not he agrees with those principles they have principles this
[18:41.280 --> 18:47.440]  is a guy who's facing one and a half million dollar a day fines and because he doesn't want to
[18:47.440 --> 18:53.520]  violate his conscience he's going to take this all the way to the supreme court he's put his
[18:53.520 --> 18:58.480]  business everything he's worked for his entire life everything he's built for his family he's
[18:58.480 --> 19:05.280]  putting on the line because of his principles because of what he believes whereas the sense of
[19:05.280 --> 19:10.720]  voltare in this where is the sense that i disagree with what you say but i'm going to defend to the
[19:10.720 --> 19:17.200]  death you're right to say it you don't see that from the fascist sarcastic left this guy has put
[19:17.200 --> 19:21.840]  everything on the line at any point he could have caved to the government and he could have said
[19:21.840 --> 19:26.640]  that's fine i'll just i'll just pay it i'll just provide the insurance it wouldn't have cost him that
[19:26.640 --> 19:32.320]  much in the insurance to put that in but he stuck he stuck to the line do we have uh we don't have
[19:32.320 --> 19:38.240]  time for that quote i want to play a clip when we come back i want you to hear from the ceo of
[19:38.240 --> 19:45.280]  hobby lobby what this is really about this is not about making money and i feel sorry for people
[19:45.280 --> 19:50.960]  like john stewart who are so devoid of any overriding principles in their life that they can dismiss

[24:12.480 --> 24:16.960]  the next segment we're going to be joined by paul joseph watson he's going to talk about the amazing
[24:16.960 --> 24:23.360]  revelation of turkey planning a false flag that was recorded put up on youtube but of course
[24:23.360 --> 24:27.840]  the mainstream media is not talking about that they're talking about the fact that turkey shut down
[24:27.840 --> 24:33.360]  the entire youtube youtube entirely for their country and that's all they're talking about
[24:33.360 --> 24:37.360]  they're not talking about the actual content but just before the break we were talking about what's
[24:37.360 --> 24:43.840]  going on arguments were heard at the supreme court this last week about the hobby lobby case and
[24:43.840 --> 24:51.440]  another company who both object to obama cares requirements to carry abortifacients and john
[24:51.440 --> 24:56.080]  stewart had a program about this making fun of it and this was reported by the wire dot com
[24:56.640 --> 25:00.320]  they said this is what the wire said they said the kicker about this whole case is that the
[25:00.320 --> 25:05.840]  government must accept hobby lobby's views on birth control at face value with no mind for
[25:05.840 --> 25:13.840]  accuracy see how who gets to decide what's accurate well in a fascist state the government gets to
[25:13.840 --> 25:18.480]  make that decision but this is what john stewart said let me get this straight corporations aren't
[25:18.480 --> 25:25.200]  just people they're ill informed people whose factually incorrect beliefs must be upheld because
[25:25.200 --> 25:31.840]  they sincerely believe them yes john that's the definition of the first amendment thank you for
[25:31.840 --> 25:37.040]  clearly and succinctly stating the fascist intolerance of the left that because you don't
[25:37.040 --> 25:42.080]  agree with what somebody says you can use the government to censor them to shut them down
[25:42.080 --> 25:47.200]  to dictate to them what they do or don't do in their business because of course we know that
[25:47.200 --> 25:51.680]  obama built their business they didn't build that business over a long time but actually they did
[25:51.680 --> 25:56.880]  listen to the ceo green of hobby lobby this is what he said about his business and about this
[25:56.880 --> 26:02.400]  particular case the very first freedom was religious freedoms and that is really what's
[26:02.400 --> 26:09.840]  stake here is uh do we as a family when we open a business lose the ability to have the religious
[26:09.840 --> 26:15.280]  freedoms uh that our founders gave us we have operated our business according to the principles
[26:15.280 --> 26:20.800]  that we hold dear and now the government's saying that because we're incorporated we can't the mandate
[26:20.800 --> 26:26.880]  required us to provide the motivations that violate our conscience and that we had to freely
[26:26.880 --> 26:30.560]  provide those and so that's one of those where that we really didn't feel like we had an option it's
[26:30.560 --> 26:36.400]  not something that we want to be a part of and so um we just felt like our hands were tied and that
[26:36.400 --> 26:40.880]  the only option we had was to sue the government saying that this isn't fair that you require us
[26:40.880 --> 26:45.680]  to do something that violates our conscience there are 20 required what they call contraceptions
[26:46.400 --> 26:53.680]  but we are not we do not have a problem with contraceptives but it is those that are abort
[26:53.680 --> 26:57.840]  abortive in nature that is when it becomes a problem for us there are 20 that are required
[26:57.840 --> 27:03.760]  and 16 of them we provide so that's it's not the problem but there are four that can terminate life
[27:03.760 --> 27:10.400]  and those are the four that we cannot provide so we should have a discussion as to why the
[27:10.400 --> 27:15.280]  government even gets to dictate of course health care to us there's nothing in the constitution
[27:15.280 --> 27:18.960]  that gives them that authority but i want you to look at his principles and the fact that he's
[27:18.960 --> 27:24.880]  willing to put what he's built over his entire life on the line they're getting one and a half
[27:24.880 --> 27:30.880]  million dollar a day fines levied against them by Kathleen Sibelius and those people those fascists
[27:30.880 --> 27:38.000]  who are trying to take the americans money and redistribute it not from one class of americans
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.800]  to the other but to the one percent to the insurance companies that's what this is about
[27:42.800 --> 27:48.400]  this is fascist america it really bothers me it really bothers me to see this intolerance
[27:48.400 --> 27:52.800]  of the left to say that they don't get to decide they don't get to do this because they're wrong
[27:52.800 --> 27:56.640]  on this issue they lose their first amendment rights because they're a corporation but look
[27:56.640 --> 28:02.480]  at their principles they put everything on the line they could have at any time caved contrast
[28:02.480 --> 28:06.640]  that to what's going on in california with one of the top democrats in the california state this
[28:06.640 --> 28:12.800]  is a california state senator who was arrested for allegedly gun running but he was their biggest
[28:12.800 --> 28:20.960]  gun control advocate this guy his name is senator layland ye he's out of san francisco he's had
[28:20.960 --> 28:25.920]  several gun control bills he's got one that's up right now a couple of them actually listen to this
[28:25.920 --> 28:31.120]  one it would expand california's ban on assault weapons to include semi-automatics center fire
[28:31.120 --> 28:38.560]  rifles etc this guy was caught in an fbi sting and he's trying to take bribes from people he
[28:38.560 --> 28:44.880]  thinks they're the chinese triads that's a chinese mafia so that he can smuggle rocket launchers and
[28:44.880 --> 28:50.240]  to russia to muslim separatists this is the scenario that the fbi gave him and this democrat
[28:50.240 --> 28:54.480]  senator is good with that listen to what he said do i think we can make some money i think we can
[28:54.480 --> 28:58.880]  make some money do i think we can get the goods i think we can get the goods people want to get
[28:58.880 --> 29:03.920]  whatever they want to get do i care no i don't care people need certain things so what kind of
[29:03.920 --> 29:10.000]  things is it going to provide rocket launchers guns anything they want now people need certain
[29:10.000 --> 29:15.200]  things like health care can we make those decisions about that no that's going to be made by the mafia
[29:15.200 --> 29:20.400]  in washington okay this is the kind of principles that we're seeing from the democrats people at
[29:20.400 --> 29:24.800]  the top of the democrat party same thing in north carolina we just had one of their rising stars
[29:24.800 --> 29:30.720]  there get taken down that was a mayor taken down with real estate corruption of course at the local
[29:30.720 --> 29:35.360]  level at the mayoral level it's real estate when you move up to the senate level it's all about

[33:32.560 --> 33:38.160]  what it shows us the way the mainstream media specifically msnbc is reacting to some of this
[33:38.160 --> 33:43.600]  news i'm going i'm joined right now by paul joseph watson in england but i'm hesitating here a
[33:43.600 --> 33:50.960]  little bit i just got handed a new breaking piece of news here there was this case and here you will
[33:50.960 --> 33:55.840]  not believe this verdict this is a case out of washington dc and of course washington dc
[33:55.840 --> 34:01.440]  does everything they can to try to stop any kind of firearms ownership even though they lost in
[34:01.440 --> 34:08.800]  heller versus dc five years ago they're still going after people for any kind of paraphernalia even
[34:08.800 --> 34:15.680]  that looks like it's coming from guns now this is a situation where a fellow was flagged by his
[34:15.680 --> 34:20.080]  ex-wife trying to get even with him she knew that he was a hunter she knew that he had guns but of
[34:20.080 --> 34:26.400]  course he kept those in virginia where it was legal he had his place rated twice and one of
[34:26.400 --> 34:34.080]  these raids what they found was a 20 25 conical shaped 45 caliber bullets made by him out of lead
[34:34.080 --> 34:39.440]  and copper they don't have primer they don't have gunpowder so they can't be propelled and they also
[34:39.440 --> 34:45.280]  found matching 50 caliber plastic sabos that were also in the box for his muzzleloader now
[34:45.920 --> 34:53.680]  they have convicted him for violating their gun laws they're in violation of the supreme court
[34:53.680 --> 34:59.360]  even though the supreme court said their gun laws are in violation of the constitution they ignore
[34:59.360 --> 35:04.560]  the supreme court just like they ignore the constitution and then they go and hang this guy
[35:04.560 --> 35:10.560]  because he's got some plastic cases that he can push bullets into a muzzleloader with
[35:11.280 --> 35:16.720]  or he's got some bullets that don't have any propulsion attached to them just having the lead
[35:17.760 --> 35:22.160]  now i don't know what they're going to do with them i don't haven't we just got this story here so
[35:22.160 --> 35:26.560]  i guess it's going to break i don't know they may not have even sentenced him but joining us in
[35:26.560 --> 35:33.200]  the uk is paul joseph watson and paul i wanted to have on because he had an amazing story yesterday
[35:33.200 --> 35:40.320]  it's amazing not only a revelation of a government getting caught red-handed plotting a false flag
[35:40.960 --> 35:46.880]  but then also this is to start a war with syria which is apparently the number one goal of the
[35:46.880 --> 35:53.120]  new world order and the globalist the mccain as well as obama they all want to start a war with syria
[35:53.120 --> 35:59.360]  and the reaction that the press had to it which all they did was cover the fact that youtube was
[35:59.360 --> 36:02.800]  shut down in the country now that's a big story when they shut down youtube it was a big story
[36:02.800 --> 36:07.760]  when turkey shut down twitter but they didn't look at the content so joining us now is paul
[36:07.760 --> 36:14.320]  joseph watson welcome paul hi david good to be back amazing story that you had yesterday i couldn't
[36:14.320 --> 36:19.120]  believe it it was a super video that you did where you went one by one talking about the bbc and
[36:19.120 --> 36:26.240]  about cnn and how they completely glossed over what was revealed well at its root its censorship
[36:26.240 --> 36:32.160]  david i've done an update article today which is scandal mass media censors shocking admission of
[36:32.160 --> 36:38.640]  turkish false lag and i basically list the quotes which came out of the leaked audio tape which
[36:38.640 --> 36:44.640]  emerged yesterday this was a bugged conversation between top turkish military and political
[36:44.640 --> 36:51.360]  officials wherein they basically discussed staging the false flag attack a provocation which they
[36:51.360 --> 36:59.120]  would launch on themselves in order to have a pretext to invade syria by means of blaming al-qaeda
[36:59.120 --> 37:04.480]  which of course as we know has transferred with syrian aid with turkish aid sorry from turkey
[37:04.480 --> 37:09.760]  into syria so i mean just look at some of the quotes that came out of this audio tape and
[37:09.760 --> 37:15.680]  then we can talk about how the media responded quote i'll make up a cause of war by ordering a
[37:15.680 --> 37:22.560]  missile attack on turkey that's hackan fidan the head of turkish intelligence saying that it's
[37:22.560 --> 37:27.760]  amazing literally the head of their intelligence saying i'm going to order an attack on ourselves
[37:27.760 --> 37:34.000]  in order to create a pretext for war deputy chief of military staff yasa gula what we're going to do
[37:34.000 --> 37:40.960]  is a direct cause of war and then fidan responds again we can also prepare an attack on sulaman
[37:40.960 --> 37:47.840]  shartoum if necessary now sulaman shartoum is this site which is actually in northern syria but
[37:47.840 --> 37:55.840]  is considered turkish territory it's defended by turkish special forces so that's openly brazenly
[37:55.840 --> 38:02.080]  caught red-handed planning an attack on their own military site in order to create a pretext to go
[38:02.080 --> 38:07.840]  into syria and they use that word they say if it's a pretext you need i'll give you one pretext
[38:07.840 --> 38:12.800]  can be arranged it's pretty amazing but you know this has been happening over and over again this
[38:12.800 --> 38:18.480]  is what we talk about and it's not conspiracy theories it's conspiracy fact these guys were
[38:18.480 --> 38:24.960]  conspiring to illegally attack their own troops why so they could start a war have we seen this
[38:24.960 --> 38:30.240]  before many times we've seen this many times in the american government look at operation northwoods
[38:30.240 --> 38:37.760]  where you had a conspiracy to essentially fly planes into buildings remote control to attack
[38:37.760 --> 38:43.760]  shopping malls to do that so they could start a war with cuba sounds a lot like 9 11 doesn't it
[38:45.200 --> 38:51.040]  well exactly and remember turkey is a nato member of course though the original progenitors of
[38:51.040 --> 38:57.440]  operation gladio throughout the 60s 70s and 80s replete with acts of staged terror to demonize
[38:57.440 --> 39:02.560]  political enemies and then you look at the context of this which is turkish elections coming up on
[39:02.560 --> 39:08.640]  the weekend obviously we had the event a few days ago where turkey shot down a syrian war plane
[39:08.640 --> 39:15.360]  that was targeting al-qaeda terrorists in syrian territory and turkey has provided air support
[39:15.360 --> 39:22.160]  logistics and artillery four members of al-nuzra the al-qaeda terror group as they cross from
[39:22.160 --> 39:28.800]  turkey into syria so turkey's been arming defending providing air cover for these terrorists and now
[39:28.800 --> 39:34.720]  we have the open admission that they plan to attack a site in syria in order to create the
[39:34.720 --> 39:40.080]  pretext for war and as you said i mean literally these quotes are out of some kind of james bond
[39:40.080 --> 39:45.520]  film right listen listen commander if it's a pretext will give you one out send over four men
[39:45.520 --> 39:50.880]  and have them fire eight rockets on an empty lot that's not the problem pretext can be arranged
[39:50.880 --> 39:57.360]  and then feed down again the head of turkish intelligence states if necessary will mount an
[39:57.360 --> 40:04.320]  attack against that place referring to the sulaman char tomb will do the attack up front so there's
[40:04.320 --> 40:10.800]  not even room for conjecture here according to the leak tape which erdogan the turkish prime minister
[40:10.800 --> 40:15.840]  has tacitly admitted is genuine because he complained about the fact that it was immoral
[40:15.840 --> 40:21.600]  and villainous to leak a tape out of a private security meeting but the translation is now
[40:21.600 --> 40:28.160]  confirmed it's there brazenly planning false flag attacks and now we can look at how the mainstream
[40:28.160 --> 40:33.600]  media reacted to this yeah i think but let's let's look at his reaction initially because
[40:33.600 --> 40:39.200]  that's the same reaction we see from wiki leaks about the wiki leaks about the snowden documents
[40:39.200 --> 40:43.680]  from people like john mccain and the very people who are pushing for war in syria
[40:43.680 --> 40:49.200]  are typically the same ones who want the nsa to be able to look at everything that we do to
[40:49.200 --> 40:53.840]  violate the fourth amendment to violate everybody's privacy and whenever their criminal actions
[40:53.840 --> 40:59.680]  are exposed they always attack the whistleblower and that was exactly what the turkish government
[40:59.680 --> 41:05.600]  did they attack these people as being villainous and dishonest and yet they're the ones who are
[41:05.600 --> 41:10.320]  the villains or the guys who are plotting missile attacks on their own troops the dishonest ones
[41:10.320 --> 41:14.240]  are the ones who are covering that up that's the media talk about the media's reaction to this
[41:15.360 --> 41:19.440]  well i mean that's an excellent point david i've heard you talking about that on the night the news
[41:19.440 --> 41:25.920]  last night and in fact stole it for a tweet this morning but it's an excellent point urdogan reacted
[41:25.920 --> 41:31.920]  almost exactly the same as the us establishment reacted to snowden which is chilling given the
[41:31.920 --> 41:38.400]  fact that urdogan in recent months has moved closer and closer to acting like a complete dictator
[41:38.400 --> 41:46.080]  of course banning twitter a few days ago and then today he said that the youtube ban would be lifted
[41:46.080 --> 41:51.520]  if youtube agreed to remove the content so they want the video of them planning these
[41:51.520 --> 41:58.640]  false flag attacks gone uh or they're not going to reinstate youtube and basically treason in
[41:58.640 --> 42:06.800]  in turkish punishable by lifetime imprisonment to me this represents brazen planning of treason
[42:06.800 --> 42:12.480]  attacking your own country so all these individuals named should spend the rest of their lives rotting
[42:12.480 --> 42:18.720]  in a in a midnight express style turkish dungeon and so should urdogan because he's basically acting
[42:18.720 --> 42:24.560]  like a complete dictator but the mainstream media is not giving it the attention it deserves because
[42:24.560 --> 42:31.920]  he's part of the us he's a client state turk he's a client state of nato so if we can get into how
[42:31.920 --> 42:37.360]  the media responded to this absolutely before we get to that let's talk about that let's talk
[42:37.360 --> 42:41.440]  about the consequences of that because you know when it came out about operations nor operation
[42:41.440 --> 42:47.520]  north woods and the plots that were being uh suggested to the president jfk turned it down
[42:47.520 --> 42:54.000]  he sent limits or dismissed him from his position he then went to nato and when he went to nato
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.400]  that's when the gladio attacks began so here's this guy moves from one place to another and
[42:58.400 --> 43:04.000]  that's when they start doing the false flag attacks and for people who don't know gladio was a case
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.920]  where they blamed it on the communists on the red brigades but it was actually right-wing people
[43:09.920 --> 43:15.760]  people who were working with nato they had prepositioned weapons to be as a kind of a
[43:15.760 --> 43:20.800]  bulwark against a communist russian invasion so that if they overran the country if they overran
[43:20.800 --> 43:25.520]  italy they would have these weapon caches there and they could start an internal insurrection
[43:25.520 --> 43:31.840]  a guerrilla war against the communist invasion well it wasn't just the italians it wasn't just
[43:31.840 --> 43:36.720]  limitzer it was also as sibel edmunds points out it was people from turkey they got a lot of
[43:36.720 --> 43:41.920]  gangsters released at a turkish prisons that they call babas that's their kind of term for godfather
[43:41.920 --> 43:46.400]  they were very much involved in operation gladio so you got situations where they're
[43:46.400 --> 43:51.360]  you know shooting up uh public areas bombs shootings they're blaming it on the communists
[43:51.360 --> 43:56.240]  and they're doing it as a false flag so they can win elections not necessarily start a war at that
[43:56.240 --> 44:00.160]  case but they were just doing it so they could get the communists who were starting to win elections
[44:00.160 --> 44:06.080]  taken out but let's talk about what the media has to say about this you had a great selection of
[44:06.080 --> 44:13.600]  quotes from the different big big media bbc cnn the rest of them go ahead paul i think david the
[44:13.600 --> 44:20.320]  most flagrant one is reuters which we just listed we just reeled off the quotes where they say
[44:20.320 --> 44:26.000]  they you know we can attack the sulemanshaw tomb if we need a pretext we will get it quote we'll
[44:26.000 --> 44:33.040]  mount an attack against that place sulemanshaw tomb reuters reported this they said that the
[44:33.040 --> 44:39.920]  conversation quote appeared to center on a possible operation to secure the tomb of sulemanshaw
[44:40.560 --> 44:45.680]  so the leaked conversation is actually them saying they're going to attack the tomb themselves
[44:45.680 --> 44:52.400]  uh in order to create a pretext for war reuters says they're going to secure the tomb just outright
[44:53.440 --> 45:00.880]  completely outrageous completely ludicrous censorship and then bbc said that the audio tape
[45:00.880 --> 45:06.320]  represented discussion of a possible military operation in syria again completely omitting
[45:06.320 --> 45:14.320]  any actual detail cnn obsessed about how and why the audio tape actually got leaked they completely
[45:14.320 --> 45:20.640]  failed to mention anything that was actually in it and the la times again similar to the bbc
[45:21.200 --> 45:27.360]  described it as a discussion about quote possible military intervention in syria they quote some
[45:27.360 --> 45:34.400]  portions of the tape the la times but completely omit the key sections which i just read out and
[45:34.400 --> 45:39.760]  then the washington post again they actually had the full transcript of the tape but the actual
[45:39.760 --> 45:46.560]  report written by the washington post reporter said that it was about officials mulling quote
[45:46.560 --> 45:52.400]  whether to strike or use ground troops against the islamic state of iraq and leban in syria
[45:52.400 --> 45:57.520]  so the washington post characterized it as the merely discussing how they could attack al qaeda
[45:57.520 --> 46:05.280]  in syria again black listing the very core of the story which is them brazenly planning false
[46:05.280 --> 46:10.160]  flag attacks they bury the transcription down and they know the people are just going to read
[46:10.160 --> 46:14.400]  that summary up at the top so they can basically spend that in either any way that they want to
[46:14.400 --> 46:18.320]  and these others are not even putting it out there and even though we have the youtube
[46:19.360 --> 46:24.800]  video available most people don't speak turkish so unless they read the transcript or unless
[46:24.800 --> 46:28.240]  they watch your video they're not really going to know what this is and of course the people who
[46:28.240 --> 46:33.120]  do speak turkish and turkey they can't watch the youtube video that was put up so you got this
[46:33.120 --> 46:38.160]  situation where they're totally covering up this is something though that the governments have done
[46:38.160 --> 46:42.640]  over and over again that's why we keep talking about that but if you talk about a false flag attack
[46:42.640 --> 46:47.440]  even though we can provide example after example after example throughout history
[46:47.440 --> 46:51.840]  where our government has done it where nato has done it you catch them red handed and turkey
[46:51.840 --> 46:56.560]  planning it and people just dismiss you as a conspiracy theorist it's not a theory it's an
[46:56.560 --> 47:04.720]  exposition well i mean the mainstream is desperate to keep this term false flag out of the general
[47:04.720 --> 47:10.400]  body politic they don't want people let alone not discussing it they don't even want them to grasp
[47:10.400 --> 47:15.280]  what it actually means there's an excellent article we posted out a washington's blog today
[47:15.280 --> 47:22.560]  on info wars dot com which lists both gladio the cia and iran israel numerous other countries
[47:22.560 --> 47:27.360]  openly brazenly court committing false flag attacks throughout the last 50 years or so
[47:27.920 --> 47:35.040]  but the reaction that we saw just even to me it was shocking i mean i'm i'm embedded in this
[47:35.040 --> 47:41.360]  every single day and even to me the level of censorship that they had to engage in in order
[47:41.360 --> 47:47.440]  to bury the actual meaning the core of this story just was just ludicrous even to my eyes
[47:47.440 --> 47:55.760]  uh usa today shockingly the only mainstream news source that i found they actually reported the
[47:55.760 --> 48:02.240]  story they said that it represented top turkey officials who were plotting to fake an attack
[48:02.240 --> 48:08.560]  against their own country as an excuse to wage war on turkey that's a direct quote out of usa
[48:08.560 --> 48:14.960]  today that's the first paragraph of their article so i mean god knows who who was working for usa
[48:14.960 --> 48:20.800]  today but they they didn't get the memo or the consensus that was handed down amongst all those
[48:20.800 --> 48:25.040]  of the mainstream journalists they may not be working there tomorrow i think that's the key
[48:25.040 --> 48:32.880]  point that you pointed out how pervasive this is how all the major news outlets the bbc cnn
[48:32.880 --> 48:39.040]  new york times washington post la times roiders ap they all cover for this they all cover it up
[48:39.600 --> 48:44.480]  that's the amazing thing to me is how pervasive it is how sinister it is when you look at the
[48:44.480 --> 48:49.440]  transcript and you look at the way they characterize it and their reports i mean it's just simply a
[48:49.440 --> 48:54.800]  lie and they're all doing it all these mainstream media outlets are doing it except as you point
[48:54.800 --> 49:01.920]  out maybe usa today i asked the question i mean is this merely consensus that they're so ingrained
[49:01.920 --> 49:08.480]  in not asking questions not acting in an adversarial role to the state to nato that they just self
[49:08.480 --> 49:14.080]  censor and not talk about the actual core of the story or if some kind of memo got handed out
[49:14.080 --> 49:19.600]  the fact that all of them are doing it apart from usa today i mean i don't know but you know bbc
[49:19.600 --> 49:25.840]  this morning their top story was still about the missing melasia plane i mean why on earth are people
[49:25.840 --> 49:31.600]  still why is that their top story yeah yeah exactly ridiculous well it's sensational but
[49:31.600 --> 49:36.640]  they do not want people looking closely at this i think a good example of this is the
[49:36.640 --> 49:41.600]  chris hayes report you know we see that as you pointed out yesterday msnbc is in freefall
[49:41.600 --> 49:47.520]  their ratings are down 24 percent over the last measurement from neilson and it's all of the cable
[49:47.520 --> 49:53.840]  news channels are dropping but we had this report where chris hayes attacks dan bedondi you know
[49:53.840 --> 49:58.720]  dan bedondi had this confrontation with a state representative about some gun control issues and
[49:58.720 --> 50:04.160]  he asked him about the constitutionality of it and the guy just said f you and chris hayes says
[50:04.160 --> 50:10.400]  well that's justifiable because of who it is no it's not justifiable he needs to provide an answer
[50:10.400 --> 50:15.120]  for the constitutionality of what he's doing but see the f word that they're really afraid of
[50:15.840 --> 50:22.000]  oh actually two of them false flag they won't use those words we're going to play that clip from
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.800]  msnbc in the next segment because alex is going to be coming on at the top of the hour
[50:26.800 --> 50:33.520]  and he wants to talk about that msnbc segment with chris hayes but that's really really the core
[50:33.520 --> 50:38.640]  that's really the f word that they're afraid of the two f words false flag they won't use that
[50:38.640 --> 50:45.680]  that rachel madow might talk about how the fbi has got 150 to nothing record of investigating
[50:45.680 --> 50:51.120]  itself and never finding that they did anything wrong but you won't talk about false flags with
[50:51.120 --> 50:55.440]  boston bombing we'll be right back with paul joseph watson and coming up is alex general stay tuned

[52:22.480 --> 52:28.320]  scheduled to occur just like 9 11 had a lasting impact on our society this event will reshape
[52:28.320 --> 52:33.280]  america it will swipe trillions off markets and retirement accounts everywhere and destroy the

[53:58.480 --> 54:21.120]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and i'm talking to paul joseph
[54:21.120 --> 54:29.680]  watson about the amazing reaction of the mainstream media worldwide to this false flag leak on youtube
[54:29.680 --> 54:35.680]  from the turkish government where they're plotting an attack on their own forces in an area that they
[54:35.680 --> 54:42.480]  claim is theirs so they can start a war with syria now of course the term that cannot be brought up
[54:42.480 --> 54:48.640]  by the media under any circumstances is false flag and we've seen how even though rachel madow
[54:48.640 --> 54:52.400]  their ratings are in free fall she only gets a couple hundred thousand people watching her in
[54:52.400 --> 54:59.520]  prime time so they tried truth for a change they actually talked about the fbi sorry record of
[54:59.520 --> 55:04.720]  investigating itself 150 times they've done investigations of shootings by the fbi and 150
[55:04.720 --> 55:10.560]  times they've exonerated themselves but especially with the shooting of ibrahim toteshev who was picked
[55:10.560 --> 55:15.520]  up he was a friend of the alleged boston bomber they picked him up he told everybody they're
[55:15.520 --> 55:20.240]  going to kill me he gets shot six times and once in the back of the head execution style of course
[55:20.240 --> 55:26.160]  that's now been found as justified by the fbi agents but where she will not go is she will not
[55:26.160 --> 55:32.560]  look at the full events of the boston bombing because that would bring up this false flag which
[55:32.560 --> 55:38.240]  the media is deathly afraid of take a look at this report from chris haze it is so rare when a
[55:38.240 --> 55:43.280]  politician just lets loose with absolutely justifiable profanity this is a guy from msnbc
[55:43.280 --> 55:48.080]  looks just like rachel maddow it's unbelievable the second amendment shall not be a friend you
[55:48.080 --> 55:54.400]  people need to understand that that's damba dandy yourself after that clip got posted the internet
[55:54.400 --> 55:59.360]  rnc communications director shawn spicer who told us tonight that quote the idea of an elected
[55:59.360 --> 56:03.920]  official using language like that is unacceptable plain and simple or he tweeted out a link about
[56:03.920 --> 56:09.440]  it a tweet that is still on his feed which reads whoa wrote island state senator gunright supporter
[56:09.440 --> 56:14.800]  go at yourself except mr. spicer really should have taken a moment before he sent out that link
[56:14.800 --> 56:19.520]  because you know who wrote island state senator joshu miller was telling to f himself he's this
[56:19.520 --> 56:23.520]  guy remember last year when president bdandy is about the horrible boston marijuana bombing
[56:23.520 --> 56:28.720]  his independent radio show getting interrupted by a conspiracy theorist yelling about a false flag
[56:28.720 --> 56:40.640]  that was the same guy we use guys giving any warning ahead of time of this taking place
[56:40.640 --> 56:45.520]  why we're loudspeakers telling people in the audience to become moments before the bomb went
[56:45.520 --> 56:49.280]  off is this another false flag stage attack to take out several liberties and put more
[56:49.280 --> 56:54.720]  homeland security by sticking the hands down on the pants on the streets no his name is dan
[56:54.720 --> 56:59.280]  bdandy he's a reporter for the alex jones conspiracy theory website info conspiracy theory
[56:59.280 --> 57:03.760]  website senator miller who has now apologized for his words out of respect the decorum the
[57:03.760 --> 57:08.320]  state house and his constituents not only is bdandy known for his aggressive and intimidating
[57:08.320 --> 57:13.120]  manner he had reportedly been antagonizing an elderly veteran before confronting miller that's
[57:13.120 --> 57:17.840]  not later that day police had to physically remove him from a committee room in fact bdandy
[57:17.840 --> 57:22.800]  himself posted the moments leading up to that ejection when he wouldn't stop talking after his
[57:22.800 --> 57:34.720]  a lot of time this woman is standing up and pointing at him saying leave the room leave the room
[57:34.720 --> 57:39.600]  she doesn't want to hear what dan is sort of clarifying when that guy when info wars and the
[57:39.600 --> 57:46.880]  rnc are the one to punch defending the second amendment yeah you know he says that's justifiable
[57:46.880 --> 57:53.360]  to say fu to dan when he asked him a question about the constitutionality of their laws that's
[57:53.360 --> 57:59.600]  what it comes to and of course he dismisses info wars as being this internet conspiracy site really
[58:00.400 --> 58:05.600]  it's got more news than msnbc and it's got a lot more followers take a look at some of these numbers
[58:05.600 --> 58:11.360]  pull up there guys the youtube channel that msnbc has they've they've been up since 2011

[58:18.320 --> 58:24.640]  million since 2007 say they're dying nobody's paying attention to them because it's false

[59:03.040 --> 59:09.120]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[59:09.120 --> 59:15.600]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the
[59:15.600 --> 59:22.320]  results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously

[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:29.120]  welcome back to the alex jones radio show i'm david night and i've got paul joseph
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:33.360]  what's on the line we're going to be joined in just a few moments by alex jones in the last
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:41.920]  segment we played chris haze of msnbc's attack on dan benondi and on info wars you know it's
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:48.400]  reporters like dan benondi who aren't afraid to ask the tough questions who don't go along just to
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:55.440]  get access that's what people are looking for he may not have the perfect diction of chris haze
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:02.480]  you know he's he has a regional dialect original accent so what i mean the guy is hard core i know
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:07.360]  him from work if i'm when he worked here he's hardcore about this he's going to ask these
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:13.840]  questions he's not going to shut up just so he can get access just so people say nice things about
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:20.080]  dan dan is going to go for the truth that's exactly what we did not see when it was revealed
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:25.040]  on youtube the turkish government plotting to attack their own troops paul what do you think
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.680]  about that msnbc clip that we just played with chris hedge going after dan benondi
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.120]  well the bottom line is chris haze thinks it's called absolutely justifiable for
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:42.160]  elected representatives to tell their constituents to go f yourself yeah i've got news i've got news
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:48.720]  for him david leaping to the defense of slimy politicians like josh miller is not going to
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:56.080]  win chris haze or msnbc back their hemorrhaging audience they're insulting the american people
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:02.320]  with this kind of stuff so we'll continue to steal what's left of their dwindling audience so i'd like
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:08.640]  to personally thank chris haze uh i encourage him to continue with that behavior yeah their
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:13.440]  audience is essentially non-existent like i pointed out before rachel maddow gets about
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:19.200]  200 000 views now unless it's i don't know if that was before after the 24 drop in their ratings
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:25.680]  this radio program gets about three million views on a daily basis if you look at any metric they
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:31.360]  try to dismiss info wars as a conspiracy website on the internet you know we do have a big presence
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:36.400]  on the internet it's a much bigger presence than msnbc if you look at the alexa ratings especially
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:42.080]  on an international basis you know alexa rates the different uh ranks the different websites and
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:48.080]  we have a ranking of about a thousand they're about 2000 globally but if you look at youtube
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.520]  nobody is watching them on youtube either they're not watching them on cable they're not watching
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.760]  them on youtube as i pointed out just before the break they've only had about 142 000 views
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:03.040]  since 2011 when they started the uh msnbc channel on youtube info wars has been up since 2011 and
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:10.240]  just on our main channel we got 371 million views we've got documentaries that have had 50 60 70
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.480]  million views on other people's channels that are not even up on our channel that's just our news
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:20.720]  reports that are there and we've got multiple channels it's amazing how small msnbc is it's
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:27.360]  amazing how small the impact is of these mainstream media places and it's getting smaller because of
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:33.360]  the way that they're skewing the news as we just saw with this report on turkey well i mean why are
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:38.720]  they losing their audience look at the people who they hire you know ronan farrow hillary clinton
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:44.160]  acolyte melissa harris perry the state owns your children people don't want to hear that anymore
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:49.680]  there's a backlash against it and look at this guy chris haze the ultimate obama loyalist
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:56.400]  prostitute a democratic party operative posing as a journalist his brother was an obama 2012
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:03.600]  campaign director haze himself is a vehement obama care supporter and he makes a living out of being
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:09.520]  a water carrier for the obama administration he regurgitates their talking points that's his job
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:15.120]  so the very thought of an independent reporter like dan bedondi having the guts to act as real
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:20.240]  journalists are supposed to act in an adversarial manner against the state that to chris haze is a
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:26.880]  horrific notion it's an embarrassment to him yeah yeah whenever you have somebody ask an honest
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:31.920]  question it's a real big deal at a press conference you know jake tapper asked an honest question it
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:37.680]  was a everybody kind of freaked out you had a daily caller intern named finger he asked an honest
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.160]  question at a white house press conference and everybody's like what's up with this this is
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.560]  absolutely inappropriate he violated decorum we're gonna be right back alex jones is going
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:52.240]  to be joining us to weigh in on what the media's response is to false flags yeah that's right

[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:23.360]  and uh operation northwood talks about staging shootings and malls movie theaters and other
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:31.440]  places to bring in tyranny that's the classified abc news back in 2001 so that's the reality so
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:36.000]  ambivalent you know the media likes to make fun of dangles he's a real guy from road island because
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.840]  he's not polish it's like i'm not polish no we're popular in smbc and that probably five times the
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.320]  audience you have conservatively to look at the election ratings of our website versus their size
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:52.160]  for like six times bigger we are more successful because we got a real guy that has part and has
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.880]  got and there were hundreds of reporters threatened by the secret service that had no business there
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.760]  at the boston bombing exposing the thing had a drill that we exposed that was later confirmed
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.400]  exposing a false flag attack and that's man i should have been there but i was busy covering
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:10.480]  it all i didn't realize how big it would get that man went to three press conferences and got threatened
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:17.040]  by fbi and secret service that man had the will to get up there and have half his family turn against
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:21.200]  and literally you know do things like end up basically having his daughter's custody taken
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.960]  away from him i don't mean to get into this kind of stuff but he went through living hell in road
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:32.000]  island to go and do what he did nearby boston and those cowards sitting there on national television
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.840]  sit there and make fun of a patriot who's got incredible courage and goes into committee
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:41.440]  hearings where they're trying to pass the law to ban semi-autos and confiscate them and that's man
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:48.480]  that's all revere march is in there for all of us and these scum have the nerve to make fun of him
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:52.080]  make fun of him because he's got an east coast accent make fun of him because you know he's a
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:57.040]  quote you know dumb Italian in their view this is the time of garbage that we're dealing with in
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:01.680]  this country and i'm sick of it he's there exposing all flags they're trying to take our liberty he's
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:07.680]  there exposing gun confiscation and they make fun of him here's the deal they are running scared of
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:11.200]  people coming into committee hearings and saying you will not take our guys they're running scared
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:15.920]  of me telling third morgan the exact message putting them on notice that's what it takes
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:21.200]  escalating the rhetoric up to the level of the enemy and that is what we are doing we are countering
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:26.880]  that fraud right now here it comes out that our criminal nato dual-loader bank or run government
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:32.560]  through turkey where they got the al-qaeda forces massing are trying to state terror attacks they've
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:37.520]  already been doing it we caught the al-qaeda forces out of Saudi Arabia three times launching
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:42.080]  chemical attacks we blew that wide open now that you and admit it the truth is we have the high
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:48.160]  ground we have justice on our side and the entire info wars operation goes through all sorts of stuff
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:53.840]  that people never even hear about and never even know about but our east coast reporter Dan Badan
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:13:00.960]  who literally has gone through all sorts of living hell and threats and things on his life and and
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.440]  a bunch of his family coming out against him and saying whenever he had the nerve to go on
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:09.840]  national television and take over those press conferences and expose that false flag so we
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:15.200]  salute him and we salute paul revere because he's in the spirit of paul revere and if more men in
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:21.760]  this country acted like that we wouldn't be in this situation this is serious folks we have the
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:26.960]  turkish defense minister openly talking about saving terror attacks that will bring the united
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:32.960]  states and it will fall on war up against russian proxy troops in Syria this is dead serious people
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:37.440]  and it's time for the population out there stop being violent calm it's comfortable to stand with
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.840]  folks like dan Badan and with myself and david knight and the rest of the crew in the face of
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:46.880]  the tyrant we're sending to tary jackson and other to the boston marathon if i'm able to with my
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:52.000]  schedule and family issues i will be going as well we need to be there to expose the one
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.720]  year anniversary of that false flag and expose the other false flags and expose the pool of
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:01.040]  false flags that's being used to take over our society david knight and off to texas
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:06.080]  paul wassen and london give me your take on that we absolutely right alex he's been mocked he's
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:11.520]  been vilified he's paid a huge personal cost it always takes that and that's what we're just talking
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:16.320]  about in the last hour look at hobby lobby this guy is facing one and a half million dollar a day
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:21.520]  fines because he's going to stand on his personal beliefs and yet he gets mocked by john stewart
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:27.520]  and a jesus christ superstore piece that's you're always going to get mocked if you stand on your
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.040]  principles they're going to fight you if you stand on your principles but that's a good news that's
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:36.080]  right is there a paper tiger of the emperors to close no one has listened to them now they lost
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:41.120]  a quarter of their audience they just want to keep the facade up that they morally control everything
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:46.240]  and they have the high ground and they dictate to us no we're the real levels we believe in
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.560]  picking hobby lobby's right they're not faithful that garbage we believe in sick delays right to
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:54.240]  what they want and we believe in other people's rights to what they want that's what libertarian
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.640]  is a message real freedom not the authoritarianism of the left or the controlled right and we're
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:05.520]  waking up a lot of the question is why do they recoil in horror at somebody like dan bedondi's
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:11.600]  because he's holding up a mirror to them he's showing them how to do their job he's a journalistic
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:17.280]  bulldog yes he might not be the most polished but he's acting in that adversarial role that the
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:23.520]  mainstream media has completely abandoned is being trashed for and losing all their audience for
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:28.640]  that's why they're so threatened by a dan bedondi buy an info wars dot com buy an alex john because
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:35.440]  we're supplanting them we're stealing their audience we're pushing accurate true narratives while they
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:41.200]  try and maintain this crumbling facade of the obama administration and the u.s. military industrial
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:46.560]  complex they're scared to death they're filled with sheer terror that somebody a journalist could
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:52.400]  dare to ask real questions of public officials that's right and that's why they want to really kill
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.320]  that's why they want to attack and if you just joined us the video is up on info wars dot com
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.600]  i know paul's gonna do an article about it the sniveling tyranny of him saying he will not confiscate
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:08.400]  our guns and the guy goes go ask yourself that's their plan and they're a bunch of drugs and again
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:12.880]  it blew up in their face it made them look bad so they're acting like it made us look bad dan
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:18.080]  bedondi is a hero our entire crew of people are amazing folks our listeners that support us
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:24.400]  our heroes and harrowing and we salute every single one of you out there we have the truth
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:28.400]  we have the high ground we're the liberals in the vein of thomas deverson and we will never
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:33.520]  be stopped and we're on the march and the spirit of dan bedondi is because i'm going to do similar
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.760]  things when arrested by bush and others to march in there and have a secret service when obama
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:44.480]  wasn't even in town come up to him on national tv and threaten him on both sides and fji fuzz from
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:49.920]  obama not your average fji the internal political fji the average fji's pretty good just sit there
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:55.120]  and get in the his face and tell him not to ask questions about the thrill that was in the boston

[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:26.880]  in with more reports uh throughout the days on sunday and monday absolute the entire team this
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:32.880]  is big news that the turkish fall flag is now in the bbc and other publications we forced it out
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:38.400]  great job paul was in the entire team the riders everybody the customer service the shipping
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:43.600]  department our entire operation is absolutely getting on all cylinders and we were going in
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:48.880]  110 and never backing off they tell us to be calm they tell us to shut up they tell us that's how
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:53.040]  we get things done politically that's how we lost this country we are not going to be putting a
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:59.280]  boxer label we want freedom we want it now 1776 worldwide god bless you exactly right alex you
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:05.920]  know they picked a very bad day to scoff at the idea of false flags there's so much historical
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.920]  evidence we've got an article up yet again we keep putting this out every time this comes up
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:15.760]  the history of false flags another article up today on info wars but the to pick the very day
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:22.240]  that we've got a nato false flag a turkish false flag being put out and youtube being turned off
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:28.000]  for an entire country to try to censor that and all of the press censoring it that's bad timing
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:35.600]  for chris haze and msnbc isn't it paul it's very bad time in david i mean it wasn't msnbc
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:41.920]  you were the first to report on um zahnev being unarmed at the bow when they went on the manhunt
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:47.280]  for these alleged boston bombers it was in four wars dot com it wasn't msnbc that reported on the
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:53.120]  fact that the whole narrative behind zahnev's throat wound again was completely fabricated a
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:19:01.840]  complete lie another aspect to this is the fact that again haze describes the um the reaction the
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:08.080]  state senator's reaction go f yourself to dam bedondi as absolutely justifiable profanity
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:14.480]  he's saying it's justified this is why msnbc is completely out of touch with the american people
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:20.640]  because the backlash was so severe miller the state senator was forced to terminate his entire
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:26.000]  facebook page after issue in this public apology i mean i was on it when it was when it broke and
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:34.400]  it was going absolutely insane again the 250 000 views on the youtube video 700 respondents vast
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:40.400]  majority of them slamming miller over his uh profane late in response i'm glad there was a kind
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:46.080]  of a an approach you know we didn't see that happen so much when nancy polosi said are you serious
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:49.200]  when they asked her about the constitutionality of obama care we should have seen that kind of
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:53.280]  backlash i appreciate that that's finally happening and it's happening because of info wars we're
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:57.600]  going to be right back with paul joseph wasin we're going to continue to talk about this revelation

[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:24.960]  joseph what's on the line we've been talking about the false flag in turkey how the media has ignored
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:31.840]  it how msnbc has mocked dambe dandy and info wars for covering the false flag we believed happened
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:36.480]  last year at the boston bombing paul you were talking about the effect that info wars had had
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:43.200]  i remember when this was happening live and as we were watching them show the tapes of these uh
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:49.200]  suspects when they finally identified the sarnaya brothers as being the suspects they were looking for
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:53.760]  leon macadoo said the backpacks are the wrong color one of them was white and the backpacks
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:58.240]  had been shown as being these black backpacks so we reported that and it was kind of surreal because
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:03.120]  it took about in about 20 minutes cnn lined up a guy who was an fbi consultant and he comes and he
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:07.520]  goes well this is what they could have done the guy with the white backpack he could have had a
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:11.600]  black pack back and backpack inside of it and he could have pulled it out and then that would explain
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:17.360]  it but you know to this day we have never seen any surveillance footage of them even sitting
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:22.160]  the backpacks down where they exploded now of course the governor was told by the fbi that
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:27.520]  they had such footage but then the governor when question said he had never seen that footage
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:32.000]  you know what we've never seen that footage either we also had the southern poverty law center
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.040]  that was pushing the idea that this was somehow related to patriots because this is around patriots
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:42.640]  day they kept pushing that and looked like they had a press conference that was set up to put that
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:47.520]  out and they said they had the suspects all there they had all the video footage abruptly they just
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:53.120]  stopped it and delayed it for full 24 hours so it was a very interesting time it's very interesting
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.360]  to be engaged in that to watch these things unfolding in real time it was really kind of
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:01.040]  surreal i guess you probably were watching it in real time as well there in england weren't you
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:08.160]  it was astounding davin i mean infowars.com was bigger than drudgereport.com for one day which
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:14.320]  if you understand the magnitude of that it's jaw dropping you also had the incident where
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:20.240]  they arrested a naked individual during the manhunt which was clearly the other brother who
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:26.400]  later mysteriously was shot to death they had already arrested him earlier he didn't resist
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:32.160]  they put him in a paddy wagon and later it turns out he was shot there all kinds of crazy things
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:37.280]  going down during the manhunt which of course was a massive martial law promotional exercise
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:45.840]  but then going back to msnbc again you know their slogan is lean forward i mean as i write in the
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:51.840]  article if hosts like chris haze lean forward any further they're going to plummet into the same
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:59.600]  bottomless pit down which msnbc's ratings have plunged because they lost 50 percent of their
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:07.280]  audience between november 2012 and 2013 50 percent of their audience gone and most of it was in the
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:14.960]  demographic of viewers age between 25 to 54 the crucial demographic and you know guess where a
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:20.800]  lot of those viewers have come to not only to info wars but so many other alternative media platforms
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:25.040]  so i don't even like to use a term alternative media i like to use the term authentic media
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:30.160]  because we're not perfect but we're trying to cover this as we see it we're not trying to censor
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:35.760]  our news we're not trying to to dance around the fact that a false flag's been exposed in turkey
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:41.360]  if we see them plotting to fire missiles on their own people to start a war we're going to report
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:49.360]  that unlike the mainstream media unlike msnbc the keyword is adversarial that's what the media
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:57.200]  was always supposed to be about now it's about regurgitating state propaganda msnbc is no different
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:03.280]  from a white house press release they never challenge anything all they do is sit there all day
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:09.760]  and make jokes about you know mit romney having a black baby in his family melissa harris perry
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:15.120]  perry saying the state owns all our children it's pathetic and that the fact that it's on the decline
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:21.280]  is so encouraging and that's why we encourage them to continue uh with their talking points
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:26.560]  because they're completely failing on every front and i've tweeted chris haze directly
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:31.920]  let's see if he has any response well that'll be interesting i i don't know if he will i'd love to
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:37.040]  see you on his program that would be an interesting back and forth well we're going to be having in
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:40.240]  the next segment we're going to have anthony gutcher already come on because you know the
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:46.400]  possibility was brought up yet again of a false flag when obama brought up the possibility of thing
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:51.840]  he's most concerned about is a nuclear bomb going off in new york then of course homeland security
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:57.040]  what do they do they pull back bomb detectors from new york city as he's saying that so anthony
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:00.880]  gutcher already is going to talk to us about the possibility of that what does it look like if you
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:05.840]  prepare for yourself and you prepare for your family before that happens to think about the
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.800]  eventuality of that because there's been so much information as we've reported here at info wars
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:16.240]  the missing nukes from dais air force base there wasn't even supposed to have nuclear weapons there
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:19.920]  and anthony's been on that story he's going to join us he's going to talk to us about that
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:26.080]  and of course we've had a lot of breaking health news about fukushima we have a high school student
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:30.800]  doing what the fda would not do paul thank you so much for that article thank you for joining us

[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:30.400]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex and i'm joined in the
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:37.440]  studio now with anthony gucciardi and of course anthony is following the issues of our toxic
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:41.520]  environment very closely and a lot of information has just come out the last couple of days about
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:46.800]  this we have a story where vladimir putin is saying russia must protect its citizens from gmo's
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:53.280]  hmm also in brazil they're looking to ban monsanto's roundup and other toxicity risks we just reported
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.680]  last week that in france they're stopping bt corn that's a genetically modified corn the only one
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:03.840]  that's allowed in the eu because they found out that uh well they know in france that uh they don't
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.440]  want their citizens having gmo they're trying to ban it before the planting season but the
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:14.160]  interesting thing about bt corn is that it rapidly went to about 75 of the corn in america and now
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:21.600]  it's no longer having the desired effect on the worms that was designed to kill that pesticide
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:27.440]  is systemic throughout the corn so now they're going to continue though to grow bt corn and
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:32.080]  they're just going to spray pesticides on the outside of it as well so you get it systemically
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:36.160]  distributed through there as well as sprayed on the outside and of course they're pointing out in
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:41.040]  brazil one of the reasons that they're getting rid of monsanto's roundup and other things like
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:46.480]  that is because of a recent study that suggested that glyphosate that's roundup is the commercial
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:51.920]  name glyphosate is a chemical glyphosate is a chemical name they have linked that to a fatal
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:56.320]  kidney disease so the brazilians the french the russians they're looking out for their citizens
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:02.000]  but we're just doubling down and you know we've got everybody selling vaccinations guess what
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.360]  autism has increased 30 in just two years now it's one in 68 maybe that has something to do with
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:12.480]  the fact that everybody and their uncle is selling vaccinations what do you think well i think you
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:17.440]  hit the key point is that the international community is fighting against monsanto fighting
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:21.920]  against gmo's fighting against all of this fighting even against the war on the second
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:26.240]  amendment even though they don't have the same constitution that we do you know but meanwhile
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:31.440]  the criminal rogue elements in the united states government are doubling down you said it very well
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:37.520]  they're doubling down and they're going after us but i think they're desperate enough to go ahead
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:42.400]  and start issuing threats like obama said on air that you know hey you know new york could be
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:48.080]  attacked with a nuclear weapon yeah and i i want to make sure we cover that and tie it into the
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:52.960]  key report i think one of the most important things that i know i've ever covered i think that
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:36:00.960]  info wars has ever covered at large is the missing nuke scandal of 2013 and specifically
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:06.480]  what went on with dais air force base the nukes we covered it we broke it first due to key military
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:11.360]  insource uh inside sources they weren't even supposed to have nuclear weapons at dais air force
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:15.680]  base that's exactly right and that's one thing though i want to get into the time of it timeline
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:19.680]  of it as well how lindsay graham the same day hours later actually broke the story went ahead
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:23.280]  and said said south carolina could be nuked which is where they were going to actually take the
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:28.480]  nuclear weapons from dais and then does this have any connection you know because the inside
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:32.320]  source said you know it could be off the harbor somewhere around that entire area of new york
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:38.000]  south carolina all of it so i want to get into that that concerns me but first and foremost
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:45.040]  i think it's absolutely essential for everyone to realize something think for a moment visualize
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:51.520]  for a second that tomorrow morning you wake up and the elite hold good on their threats and
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:57.120]  there is a suitcase nuke that goes off in major city right and rogue elements inside the government
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:00.800]  carry it out or whoever whoever does that the point is whether it's terrorist or whether it's
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:04.880]  the road's government whether they just let it happen whether it is you know actual terrorist
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:12.080]  doesn't matter the point is you wake up tomorrow and that has happened suddenly your your issues
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:16.720]  are reordered suddenly it doesn't really matter if you're going to get that little promotion
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:22.720]  at your work suddenly it doesn't really matter that you know something bad happened in your
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:28.480]  family 16 years ago whatever the point is all of us have issues in our lives and have in our
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:34.000]  struggling on a daily basis we have to understand and put ourselves in the ideology that if we
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  don't stop and do something now that very well could happen and if we don't start blowing the
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.840]  whistle like what if we were just to ignore the sources that told us about those missing nukes
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:48.000]  i don't know what would have happened you know because they were threatening them back then
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.640]  oh a nuke could go off in south carolina we might have to go to war with iran and syria you know if
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:56.640]  we didn't put it out there in such a big way who knows what could have happened and there's so many
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:00.960]  stories you know people around the world are doing such a good job with all of this who knows
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:05.360]  what could have happened if we don't put ourselves in the mindset and go and say hey we're imperfect
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:10.320]  people hey we don't really know all the answers hey we've made mistakes in the past hey we don't
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:14.960]  really know what's going on fully but we're going to do our best to actually try and help people
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:19.680]  and actually try and inform people and actually try and stop the real criminal elements driving all
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:25.760]  of this if we can do that as a whole as a planet we can protect and defend our planet from the gmo's
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.880]  from the false flag attacks from all of it but only if we do that only if we decide today that
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:35.200]  we're not going to wait until there's a nuclear attack on our country or throughout the world
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:39.520]  and as alex said yesterday that will ultimately affect everyone even if there's an attack in
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:43.920]  england or something it will come here we will be affected the generations of our children will have
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:48.400]  diseases and cancer and die and that is the ultimate solution we have to put ourselves in that mindset
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:53.280]  now we have to feel that pain today so we don't experience it tomorrow and instead of saying
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:57.680]  i don't want more burden on my shoulders we say we want bigger shoulders to carry it that's the
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:03.600]  answer you know i think back to what we we saw this last week when we watched the albuquerque police
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:08.480]  shoot that homeless man who was doing nothing he was camping out in an area outside the city
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:13.680]  how horrific that was to see them shoot him down in cold blood and yet we have in turkey
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:19.520]  we have a defense minister their intelligence community all these government officials plotting
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:24.240]  to shoot missiles at their own troops you know as Stalin said one person's death is a tragedy
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:29.600]  and a million people die is just a statistic right we have to understand what these people
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:33.680]  are truly capable of these are people who want to start a war with syria they've done everything
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:38.400]  they can to start a war with syria they're trying to start a war with russia and in the midst of
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.960]  all of this obama says well what i'm really worried about is a nuclear bomb going off in new york
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:47.520]  city you know i'm kind of telegraphing they always seem to have a compulsion too this is
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:54.000]  another thing that concerns me i've noticed in my personal life as well as in public life people
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.480]  who are have something up their sleeve something criminal something they're going to do to you
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:02.480]  they always telegraph it they always talk about it we we bought a piano once let me just tell you
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:07.440]  so we bought a piano once and we didn't have a place but we were moving we stored it at the piano
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:12.640]  warehouse the guy burned the piano warehouse down once before and hadn't been caught he was a store
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:17.840]  manager he was selling these pianos multiple times okay as we're leaving he tells my wife and i
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:21.440]  oh and don't worry about your piano if it catches fire we got insurance and we're like
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:26.160]  where'd that come from right just out of clear blue a couple months later we see on the television
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:30.640]  the warehouse is on fire and the guy's picture comes up and the police are looking for this guy
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:34.800]  i have had that happen to me so many times in my life when somebody is planning something criminal
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:38.880]  to do to me or something underhanded and they telegraph it ahead of time they're compelled to
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:43.280]  talk about that and so it's very concerning to me on that level when i see obama started talking
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:49.600]  about the suitcase nukes when we've had a lot of understanding about how nukes have gone missing
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.000]  not only suitcase nukes but the ones from dinosaur for space oh yeah and tons of them gone missing
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.480]  it's important that we push it though but you notice that once we really start hitting on a real
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:03.360]  issue that they come out and then freak everyone out with a phony terroristic threat or a real one
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:07.120]  you know i mean that's the way the game is played and it means that we're actually making real
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:12.000]  strides and real success because if we hit on these key issues and everyone has there's multiple
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.600]  layers to this there's the political news layer where there's distractions and craziness and attacks
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:21.520]  and obama throwing that out there that new york city is going to be nuked amid all this russian
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:26.400]  stuff where you're you're called a russian kgb agent supporter if you don't want world war three
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.960]  you know which i think is a little bit insane myself and you notice the people that don't really
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:34.960]  get the situation are the ones saying that that you know russia is evil and everything like that
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:39.760]  and no one's really you know we're not taking sides we just don't want world war three i mean
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:44.160]  it's pretty simple to me but anyway so there's layers to this there's that geopolitical layer
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:48.080]  of the news media where they throw things out there and they're going to start talking about
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:52.960]  al-qaeda more to scare people to get them off the subject because they know that you know over and
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:57.520]  over we're going to hit on these key points and get what we want but then there's also a societal
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:03.520]  level of distraction and that of course is the entertainment industry throwing out khanye west
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:09.680]  and kim kim kardashian right and if you're not submitting to that prototype then you are not cool
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:14.400]  and what do they care about they don't care about anything in the world of geopolitical stuff or
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:18.640]  they don't care about science or technology or anything they only care about looking and acting
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:24.240]  and feeling cool so when they walk around you know with their thirty dollar fake fur coats
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:28.400]  and they act like they're cool then they are cool you know that's all that matters being cool
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:32.400]  but then beyond that you actually have the successful business person who's overtaken
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:37.600]  by the corporate world and he doesn't have any time to really look into all this stuff because
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:43.520]  he's too busy looking at his 401ks and understanding ira's and and vanguard and stuff and he doesn't
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:47.520]  get it and he has to support his family so there's a monetary aspect this is layers and layers
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:51.920]  and layers and layers of control and the key thing of the visualization that tomorrow you wake up
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:56.160]  in new york city has been blown up by a nuclear weapon and obama's on the news announcing martial
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:43:01.600]  law is to understand that none of that matters none of it actually matters if you visualize it and
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:06.960]  you realize none of it matters it's all distractionary it i understand that you know we need to take
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:11.600]  care of our lives and monetarily and everything but none of that matters if they if the criminal
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:15.600]  elements in the government get away with what they want it doesn't matter you have to think about
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:21.040]  your lineage hundred years from now your children i mean do you want them to be walking around with
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:26.880]  toe genetics in them from eating GMOs or you know half butterfly or something i mean that's just one
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:32.240]  spectrum of this or do you want them to even exist if we have world war three and we fuel this
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:37.840]  garbage in the media you know that oh we have to go after putin oh john mccain's right we have to
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:43.840]  go get those russians they don't understand that they will be casualties in all of this and this
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:50.400]  is not for our benefit it is a complete scam system multi-tiered and the only way is to eject
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:55.360]  you're in a plane that's burning and the wings are falling off and it's going 900 miles an hour and
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:59.520]  it's jet setting down to the ground you have an ejection button that you can press anytime
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:03.280]  don't be afraid to press that ejection button and realize that you have a parachute you're
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:07.600]  sailing through the sky and you can finally see everything for the way it is that is the answer
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:11.760]  that's right and we have a way to reach people too i'm looking at this story here that that's on
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:16.880]  info wars today school science project reveals high levels of Fukushima nuclear radiation
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:21.040]  in grocery store seafood this was a high school student who went out and got a geiger counter
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:25.520]  she did what the canadian government would not do the canadian food inspection agency stopped
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:31.920]  testing imported food for radiation in 2012 she found very very high levels of radiation in the
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:38.560]  food she's reporting that that's not real journalism however according to chucky schumer okay you have
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:43.120]  to be somebody who makes a living doing that but the people who are making a living doing that
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:47.840]  are not doing that reporting just like you can't be a reporter unless you work at cnn that's right
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:51.840]  now that's right seattle also said that they're not going to test any radiation because they
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:55.760]  don't care even though the independent scientist it was on drudge a few weeks ago we actually talked
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:00.640]  about last time i was on with you um they said that yeah there's Fukushima radiation coming over
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:05.040]  we're concerned about it we should begin testing and seattle said no we're not going to do anything
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:09.600]  like that and california shutting off the counters and everything like that so that's good if people
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.840]  actually go out and do something yeah you should be congratulated good job for being an actual
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:18.720]  citizen who cares about not eating Fukushima radiation that we said in 2011 was coming over
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:24.000]  here and has already hit but they're just now pretending like it's a huge revelation that
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.480]  Fukushima might affect us in some way well see and there's some new there's some breaking news
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:33.200]  out of seattle you mentioned seattle we have two possible sources of fumes have been identified
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:37.680]  for making 18 workers sick at the handford nuclear site and this is one of the oldest
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:43.520]  nuclear sites in the country they've had numerous problems there and this really highlights one
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:47.120]  of the key threats i mean now we could have a false flag attack we could have a terrorist
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:51.600]  attack with a nuclear weapon with a suitcase bomb but the thing that's happening is we've
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:56.720]  got these aging nuclear power plants and the former head of the nrc the nuclear regulatory
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:01.760]  commission has said that after in the wake of Fukushima he said that we need to shut down
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:06.880]  every one of our nuclear power plants in us because they're fundamentally flawed the design
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:10.320]  and we could have the same type of problem that they have at Fukushima and it's not just
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:16.240]  a meltdown of the reactor it can also be the stored waste that's there and now we're seeing
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:21.600]  at Fukushima what a problem stored waste is and that's being done at all these various sites so
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:26.320]  these are all potential potentially much larger than a suitcase nuke that's going to go off of
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:30.400]  course they're going to use a suitcase nuke to to crack down on what's left of any civil liberties
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:35.360]  and what does Obama want to do he wants to build dozens of more nuclear power plants
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:41.360]  across the united states absolutely it's almost like everything that makes sense the very opposite
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:46.560]  must be proposed by the united states government every single thing that makes sense you know
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:50.240]  over and over again but yeah also hundreds of them are leaking and everything like that
[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:54.080]  i mean it's a ticking time bomb there's no question and they're building along along the
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:58.240]  coast and then they also have building them on fault lines this weird double speak where they
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:02.320]  say oh climate change is going to ruin everything new york will be under water we're all going to die
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:07.760]  let's build more nuclear power plants along these very areas where we're you know claiming that
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:12.480]  climate change is going to ruin everything so they don't even believe their own propaganda right i mean
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:16.400]  if they did they'd have to do something about it right but instead they they propose all these
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:20.480]  plants to build along these very areas they say are going to be underwater and sunken with tsunamis
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:25.200]  and tidal waves and everything that's another thing the nuclear plants i mean tomorrow there
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:29.440]  could be major issues with all these things all these things could go wrong at any point we have
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:33.520]  to live life with the understanding that we're here for a very limited time we're here to protect
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:38.960]  our lineage we're here to protect uh you know our future and the only way we can do that is to
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:43.040]  really get focused and understand what matters because i mean you could die tomorrow driving
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:49.520]  really but the the greater threat to humanity is this criminal element that does want nuclear
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:55.200]  attacks in new york to fuel what they ultimately want to accomplish that's right you know and i
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:59.360]  often hear from christians who are very trusting in god it's like you know we just need to leave
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:04.320]  everything to god and just not worry about that but you know i i think it's true in so many ways
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:09.760]  somebody has said you know you you believe as if everything depends on god but you act as if it
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:15.440]  depends on you that's we need to take it as if everything depended on us we have been put here
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.920]  to be responsible for the things that have been put in our charge as stewards of our family of our
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:25.920]  country of our culture of our environment and we need to do everything that we can to protect
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:30.000]  those things and god will ultimately have the decision about what's going to happen to stand
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  before god and say i'm an imperfect person i've made mistakes i don't know everything i don't
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.800]  know the answer to everything but i'm willing to work for good before the creator who you know
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:44.000]  just say i'm ready to work for good and it will come and we wanted to get into the timeline of
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.560]  the missing nukes which i got off on a tangent on all this it's inspirational to me i wanted to talk
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:52.320]  i wanted to talk about that i think we have a clip ready to queue up in a second as well but
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:57.200]  specifically the timeline and we have the articles as well to show on screen basically we received
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:01.840]  this high-level military intelligence that a nuclear transfer with no papers was going from
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:07.920]  dais air force base in texas to south carolina now we were concerned about this and made the
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:12.400]  decision to go ahead and release it based on the fact that this was a super high-level military
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:16.560]  intelligence person and then we went out and we released it and we weren't really sure what
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:20.720]  was going to go down because we just put it out there we put the text out there we you know
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:24.800]  protected the source just said hey there's some there's some really weird stuff going on the
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:29.840]  base commander came out signed off on it but there was no real documents he gave them to go ahead
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:33.840]  and then they started the truck started moving to south carolina with these nuclear warheads that
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:40.640]  were never supposed to be a dais air force base and hours later senator lindsay graham came out
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:44.240]  and issued a warning we confirmed it actually happened and his staffers were like freaking out
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:47.360]  about it when i called them and that's recorded up there i don't think we have that queued up today
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:53.040]  because there's so much but ultimately he was saying yes you know i'm concerned about syria
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:59.120]  you know i'm concerned about iran all the stuff there could be a nuclear attack on south carolina
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:04.080]  charleston harbour i believe it was which is right exactly where we were told that these weapons
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:09.840]  were being transferred to now this was hours after we found out about this so this was hours later
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:14.560]  and parallels exactly exactly what obama just said about new york except this was lindsay graham
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:19.680]  talking about south carolina and we know that the nukes are headed toward south carolina if in the
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:24.000]  event that they were fully transferred they are not rerouted they are already there as of months
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.600]  ago and they could have been rerouted anywhere so this is what concerns me now beyond all of that
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:35.440]  we then i called dais air force and i will play it when we come back i guess but i asked them hey
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:39.520]  can you tell me about the transfer ball one they said well we can't talk about the transfer weapons
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:43.200]  why didn't even mention the word weapons so we'll we'll play that when we come back then
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:46.240]  when we come back we're going to have more from anthony gucciardi and we're going to be
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:50.960]  talking to geril salinti in the next hour we're going to be talking about the ukraine the imf
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:55.520]  and a lot of bankers who seem to be committing suicide what's up with that stay tuned we'll be

[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:12.720]  forward slash alex anthony we were talking just before the break about the interesting parallels
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:19.440]  of lindsay graham being in south carolina talking about war that's about to break out war with
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:24.160]  syria and other issues going up against the russians at that time because russians were
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:29.760]  essentially allies of syria and this out of the clear blue sky he brings up the prospect of a nuclear
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:36.720]  attack there in trolson harbour and that same day we had gotten intelligence that nuclear weapons
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:42.240]  were on their way from a to south carolina from a nuclear from a air force base it wasn't supposed
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:47.280]  to have nuclear weapons it seems to be straight out of their playbook doesn't it yeah when there's
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:51.600]  an issue with the foreign power that they want to engage with they just say well there could be a
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:57.200]  nuclear attack and that's unsubstantiated until you look at the fact that they were transferring
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:02.720]  the nuclear warheads from texas to south carolina which is concerning so i don't know what they're
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:07.440]  going to do all i know are they just fear mongering or are they planning a false flag attack
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:11.040]  because they have planned false flag attacks is that we spent most of the last couple of hours
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:15.200]  talking about the long history of false flag attacks in the wake of this one being exposed in
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:21.360]  turkey to get a war started yet again with syria world leaders love to at least think of that
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:25.120]  possibility i mean it's happened for thousands of years it's nothing new it's not it's not a
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:30.480]  conspiracy theory it's it's fact i mean that's what you do you know i mean uh you know how many times
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:35.120]  in on a smaller scale have you gone up to your friend and just jokingly you know pat him on the
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:38.800]  side and he thought it was one of your other buddies you know what i mean just just to joke
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:43.520]  around with them well this is a major scale it's human nature to essentially instigate things that
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:48.800]  you want done if you're evil then and a world leader which many of them do get there by being
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:54.560]  psychopathic and evil a larger scale is to have a false flag attack and these people don't have
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:59.360]  morals these people don't care about you and they don't care about me and the very prospect of is
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:04.240]  what's concerning that's why we need to treat it like a real threat and treat it by exposing it and
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:09.680]  spreading the information because otherwise we could be facing something very very much you know real
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:15.120]  yeah and uh it does seem it's just like syria we managed to stop that i mean that was a major
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:19.360]  major major victory obama was pushing for that harder than i think he's ever pushed for anything
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:24.640]  they were trying to sell the narrative that the only way that the seren nerve gas the only source
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:29.200]  that place that it could have come from was the syrian government itself and yet as we pointed out
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:33.520]  and and part of the ways that we're fighting back against that false narrative uh the truth of the
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:38.800]  matter was is that there had been seren gas attacks previously not that long ago they've been looked at
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:44.720]  by both u.n inspectors as well as russian inspectors as well as us intelligence and they had all
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:50.480]  determined that the seren gas at that time had been homemade it wasn't of the refined quality that
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:55.360]  that syria would have and so and then we had reports as well that uh there had been some gas
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:59.280]  that had been brought to that area from some saudi intelligence so there were a lot of
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:04.560]  different things that pointed to the fact that it was not a foregone conclusion that that gas
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:08.880]  had come from syria it actually made no sense at all for them to try to provoke an attack
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:12.160]  considering the fact they were surrounded on all sides of their body pointing their guns at them
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:18.800]  but it's it's an amazing thing to see this unfolding in real time and uh any last words
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:23.600]  you want to make about the uh nuclear i just think we need to treat it as a realistic threat and
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:27.680]  and we need to expose it and get the information out and envision this and we can fight this we
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:32.080]  can stop it all anthony gucciardi thank you for joining us thank you for pointing that out we're

[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:45.120]  today i wanted to point out an article however from reason magazine this is written by jim
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:50.240]  epstein it's called the government's appalling campaign against small bus companies now we've
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:54.560]  been talking earlier in the program about what's going on with hobby lobby and another small business
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:01:00.400]  kind of stoga they were making some kind of wood stuff or there was a midnight company
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:05.520]  these two companies did not want to be forced to pay for abortion coverage for their employees
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:10.480]  and they're fighting it all the way to the supreme court and being ridiculed every step of the way
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:16.000]  is oh your corporations now so you don't have any say so over what goes on well take a look at what
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:21.920]  they do to small companies now this is a story of a small family business that didn't get as big as
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:28.160]  hobby lobby this is jeff and judy rogers a black couple in high school they started a charter bus
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:34.160]  company called southeast and tours 20 years ago in greenville north carolina in 94 they partnered
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:39.120]  with her mother took out a loan built a garage launched their business and so far so good they're
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:44.480]  doing well they've got employees but then the government gets involved he says this company
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:50.080]  was my livelihood it's how i pay for my food and everything but it's being shut down why
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:56.560]  because of the federal motor carrier safety administration the fmcsa a federal agency that
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:01.280]  quite frankly i'd not heard of before but it exhibits all of the characteristics that you
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:06.000]  typically see with these government agencies flexing their muscle growing their bureaucracy
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:11.600]  and doing it as a perfect example of a government parasite what they did was they never had any
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:17.280]  serious accidents at this bus company but they did a three-day audit this fmcsa inspectors they
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:21.760]  found that drivers had filled out their logs incorrectly that rogers had failed to provide
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:25.200]  employees with educational materials that they allowed a former driver to get back behind the
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:29.360]  wheel before waiting for the results of his alcohol and drug tests which came back negative
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:33.520]  because of that paperwork it's kind of like what we saw the other day with the school that
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:39.040]  went into shutdown and the mom was arrested because her autistic child was having some kind
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:43.040]  of a seizure they called her they knew her at the school they buzzed her in but because she
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:47.920]  didn't sign the paperwork they put the whole school in lockdown and they arrested her they
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:51.680]  called the police took her away in handcuffs these guys didn't fill out their logs so what
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:55.600]  are they doing they're shutting down this family business that's been there for about 20 years
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:00.560]  says when their troubles began in early august they tried to do whatever they could to get back
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:05.520]  in the government's good graces but unfortunately they couldn't the government was determined to
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:10.800]  turn them into a failed business now after six months they're just shutting it down they're
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:16.560]  being forced to dissolve their country their company where was their jury trial where was the
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:22.800]  legislation that gave this power what we see over and over again is that these bureaucracies
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:27.120]  are given power to make their rules in other words write their legislation then they have their
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:33.840]  police force that goes out their own police force then they're their own jury see these people who
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:40.080]  created a company a small business shouldn't they at least have a day in court like the sixth
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:44.720]  amendment says they're taking more than $25 from these people where's their day in court where do
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:50.160]  they have a jury of their peers saying that just because they didn't have the the drivers sign
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:54.640]  the log in the proper way that they should have their entire business shut down they've never
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:59.360]  done anything to harm anybody they've been operating without any accidents for decades but
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:04.320]  that's the way it happens they didn't build that the government built that right he doesn't have
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:09.280]  a business it's all about the federal government nobody else now gerald solanti is going to be
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:12.480]  joining us we're going to be talking about some banking issues this just came up today out of
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:17.920]  bloomberg city group fails the feds stress test as bank of america gets a dividend boost
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:23.360]  city group was one of among five large banks that failed the federal reserves stress test
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:30.000]  and these are banks like oh oh look at this hsbc yeah remember those guys remember the whistleblower
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:37.360]  um who pointed out that they were laundering money for drug cartels for terrorists but then
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:42.000]  eric holder said uh they're too big to jail we're going to give them a pat on the back
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:47.120]  and maybe a little bit of a slapping on the hand with a fine but otherwise they're too

[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:50.400]  jeryl salenti now he's no stranger to the show you know i'm but let me give you a little bit
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:56.480]  background on trends research dot com that's his website jeryl salenti is an american trend setter
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:02.400]  a forecaster a publisher of trends journal i've got a copy of that right here on my desk and
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:08.320]  on the cover is the ukraine riot that's a big trend that we want to talk to him about what's
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:14.240]  going on breaking news today in the ukraine they're having the legislature there has accepted
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:21.200]  finally the terms of the imf cramming austerity down the throats of the people there it's amazing
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:27.040]  i want to get jeryl's take on that he's described himself as a political atheist and a citizen
[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:31.120]  of the world and so as a citizen of the world jeryl what do you make of what's going on the
[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:37.120]  poor people of the ukraine well as you mentioned it's on the cover of the trends journal and that
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:44.160]  was the winter edition and that went to subscribers in the first week of february wow and we actually
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:49.200]  wrote the story in the middle of january it takes time to get published and that's what we said it
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:55.520]  would be a civil war there and in ukraine was the major issue well as you mentioned the austerity
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:10:03.280]  measures number one and as you people have done so many times and being on top of the news and
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:11.360]  ahead of the trends you have those audio tapes and videotapes of our assistant secretary of state
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:21.040]  victoria newland and the ones where they're talking about the overthrow of the democratically
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:25.120]  elected government of ukraine whether or not you like them or not whether or not they were corrupt
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:30.960]  or not because they've been corrupt since the breakup of the former soviet union and probably
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:40.320]  before that and then there's the other videotape of her on december 13th 2013 this isn't ancient
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:47.120]  history and she's at the national press club and there she is standing there with a sign over her
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:57.200]  left shoulder that says chevron and is she unaware like the uh mass car race drivers yeah exactly i
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:03.840]  mean they're pimping for you know the uh who pays them they're putting you know so uh there anyway
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:10.160]  in that talk that's about eight and a half minutes well we'll take much out of anyone's life to listen
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:18.480]  to she goes on to say that which was news to me that ukranians the europeans i didn't know that
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:24.720]  all of them were but she informed me that they were and that they should join the european union
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:33.200]  remember that now this is december of 2013 and to paraphrase but almost identical to what she said
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:45.680]  the path for ukranians is to take the path set forth by the international monetary fund
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:54.960]  yeah yeah or as it really is it's the international mafia federation and and and really it is because
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:12:00.000]  hey you better pay us because we're going to steal everything from you and that's what all this is
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:07.440]  about it's about the privatization and they're already starting to do that of expensive public
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:13.440]  resources that's the white shoe boy name by the way privatization and that means selling it to your
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:19.760]  buddies at a really cheap price and getting a kickback from it and what they're also doing is they're
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:26.400]  putting the people into the slavery that they've done already in spain and in greece and in ireland
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:33.760]  and in portugal i mean look what's going on why would anybody in their right mind want to join
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:43.200]  the eu and why would they want to accept austerity measures which is again is another white shoe boy
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:50.640]  word for putting you into servitude for the rest of your life because here's the deal as i said we're
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:58.640]  going to we're going to sell off all your valuable public assets to our buddies we're going to bring
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:05.440]  in the multinational banks and the multinational corporations and we're going to rob everything
[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:12.080]  that you have and those pensions you have forget about them we're going to get those taken away
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:19.360]  from you too and we're also going to raise your taxes and it's going to cost you more to live
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:28.800]  so now just be a good girl and boy and behave because the international mafia federation
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:37.200]  has just taken over another chunk of the world you know Reuters reported that as the imf throwing
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:42.320]  the ukraine a lifeline it's actually a hangman's noose isn't it they're going to take their the
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:46.960]  gas company the big gas company that's there as you mentioned privatize that they're also going
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:51.360]  to go up 50 percent on the energy prices of the people in the ukraine that's what they call
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:58.320]  a austerity program an austerity program how about yeah and again the whole thing is a sham
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:03.920]  i mean look at the it's an overthrow of a democratically elected government they got this
[02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:09.360]  little clown in their yats they're rabbit you know that's they call him because he looks like
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:15.440]  when he's cartoon characters and and who's fronting and she's out there again that timis shanko
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:22.960]  now she's talking about running for uh prime minister yeah and and and some of her lovely
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:29.120]  quotes by the way the depresses leah look alike the one with the braided hair right yeah time to
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:38.240]  grab guns and kill those damn russians talking about nuking them and another one she said
[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:45.920]  putin represents unfiltered fascism which was even more dangerous than hitlers national
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:53.200]  socialism because he camouflaged it with phrases about friendship between people
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:15:00.720]  hmm and she said timischenko said that putin wants to redraw the map of the world through wars
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:10.080]  mass murder and blood could you imagine and and this is and all and all of the american
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:18.160]  you know senators and they all go there and they take photographs with her and she's in germany
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:24.640]  with merkel and and they're all bowing down to her this you know by the way i've come up with a
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:31.520]  campaign slogan for 2016 and she fits part of it you could do this in a country of your choice
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:39.200]  charles manson for president enough of these psychopaths that are really psychopaths and
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:46.240]  they try to it's really in the closet and they try to behave like normal human beings when they're
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:52.480]  really psychopaths so i said let's just put it out there so that we're not you know don't have any
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:16:00.400]  illusions of who's running the show because anybody that speaks these words is out of their mind
[02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:06.400]  and then if you go of course it's not in the u.s media talking about psychopaths
[02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:16.480]  u.s human rights record chastise in un report human rights company u.n u.n human rights committee
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:26.880]  raises concerns over u.s torture drone strikes the death penalty and nsa data collection so
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:36.960]  so why pretend that obama and bush and clinton and oh kondalisa rice is out there shooting her
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:46.400]  mouth off again rumsfeld why pretend that these are normal human beings when they're mentally
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:55.360]  deranged and they're psychopaths because they're in favor of killing other people under a camouflage
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:17:03.600]  of being normal so i say charles manson for 2016 well you know uh they're not calling them
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:08.400]  psychopaths they're calling them technocrats that's what they're referring to yachts as
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:13.520]  comparing him to mario monti the guy that nigel ferrion said you know who are you to come into a
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:18.160]  country that where they've got a democratically elected leadership who are you to come in as a
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:23.760]  goldman sacks banker and start dictating terms to them but that's exactly what yachts is going to do
[02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:29.040]  for the state department for the banks that run the state department for the banks that run the imf
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:35.120]  exactly they're doing it they're doing it everywhere and you mean you mean three card
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:40.480]  monti of course that's right and again you know the italians that's a better name is super mario
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:46.080]  they called him super mario i like the three card monti that's much better they had um the italians
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:53.600]  had three new prime ministers none of them have been elected yeah monti let it and now you got
[02:17:53.600 --> 02:18:01.680]  renzi over there fonzi that the new joker over there and talking about psychopaths i love this one
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:09.920]  everybody loves jimmy carter that nice peanut farmer the deacon you know the man of god listen
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:16.160]  to this this was from algezier at three days ago he's talking about whether or not we should
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:24.400]  supply arms to ukrainians he goes i think russia needs to be stopped at this point i don't think
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:31.680]  we need to equivocate about the prohibition against putin's moving military forces into other parts
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:39.120]  of eastern ukraine i had the same challenges to face when i was president now i am going to read

[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:25.280]  Salenty on the line and we're talking about economic issues as well as global political
[02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:32.160]  issues now Gerald this just came out I'm seeing that the Japanese are really stepping up their
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:38.240]  purchases of gold one store has reported that their gold sales are up 500% this month one of
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:43.600]  the things they're speculating might be driving this is an increase in the Japanese sales tax
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:49.440]  and that's dropping household spending household income and people are now instead of spending
[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:54.480]  money they're stocking up on gold what do you think about gold right now well I'm still you know
[02:24:54.480 --> 02:25:02.400]  long-term I'm bullish on gold you know it's uh why is the market going up as we speak because
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:09.040]  there's speculation that not small as speculation is that the Chinese are going to be juicing
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:14.720]  more stimulus into their economy because it's going down despite them saying that they weren't
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:22.160]  going to for the last six months and the same thing now with the ECB and they're also talking about
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:28.800]  quantitative easing and more stimulus they're even talking of negative interest rates
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:33.920]  where in other words the big banks are going to have to pay the European Central Bank to hold
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:39.280]  their dough so they're bringing it that's how bad it all is but you know David I just want to finish
[02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:49.120]  with this Jimmy Carter moment sure he keeps using the word freedom fighters these were the Mujahideen
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:56.400]  these were the Osama bin Laden's that we the people were giving money to under a big lie
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:26:03.760]  as he point pointed out they did it in secret they we bought Russian weapons to give to them
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:11.760]  so we couldn't be accused of interfering in in Afghanistan this guy should be brought up on
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:18.720]  war crime charges along with all of the rest of them yes it's a bipartisan thing isn't it it's not
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:25.120]  just Jimmy Carter it's also Ronald Reagan helping the Mujahideen which then we now know as Al Qaeda
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:32.960]  giving them their start exactly and they brag about it and every word I kept reading all those eyes
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:41.840]  eye eye eye eye eye and that's the way they all act whether they're the president or whether they're
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:53.120]  Kerry talking to you like this that all we are a bunch of serfs and slaves and they are in charge
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:27:00.160]  of the whole show like you I was listening to what they did to that poor family that had that
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:12.800]  bus company yeah and then you pick up the papers financial times headline banks hit by 100 billion
[02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:24.080]  dollars in US legal settlements since crisis 100 billion dollars last year by the way the
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:35.520]  six major banks they got a profit of 76 billion but I digress not one head rolls but they better
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:42.000]  fill out those logs and don't you walk you saw what they did to that girl down in your territory
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:49.040]  over there oh yeah you know oh yeah stay in line for the minor offenses they they they shut your
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:52.640]  businesses down they beat you up on the streets they shoot you on the streets for minor violations
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:58.160]  look at the guy in albuquerque what was he doing he was camping out that's a capital offense now
[02:27:58.160 --> 02:28:03.120]  because you know I don't understand what's going on but they get increasingly draconian you're
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:07.440]  talking about how egotistical they are I think a good measure that is the executive orders look
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:14.240]  at how they've gone up exponentially under each president I know and and again I've said this
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:23.360]  in the beginning when the first it happened under bush with too big to fail there in capitalism
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:29.120]  there's no such thing as too big to fail right you've fit you rise and fall on your own merits
[02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:35.920]  and I said at that time people and then when Obama came in he's communist he's Marxist no
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:42.880]  it's fascist it's the merger of state and corporate powers you're seeing it over there right now in
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:52.160]  Ukraine it's fascism fascism is taken over this country oh and by the way did you see that reception
[02:28:52.160 --> 02:29:00.880]  that Obama got in Brussels after he was just over there and he talked about how the United States
[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:08.240]  is really changing its NSA and spying and the room is filled with reporters everybody should
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:16.080]  try to look at this one up it's a real good one barely got an applause yeah they're not buying it
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:23.920]  and and the urans and I remember when Obama got elected I and I getting interviewed all over the
[02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:30.000]  world he was going to be the salvation that's right the savior hang on Gerald we got to take

[02:33:44.240 --> 02:33:50.320]  talking earlier in the show about the attacks from msnbc chris haze attacking dan bedondi
[02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:55.440]  and a real a real journalist with real courage to get up and ask tough questions of the government
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:01.360]  we see now in a article up on info wars for the daily caller a reporter has just been detained
[02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:09.360]  by capital police for trying to ask the epa chief a question how dare him ask the epa chief a question
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:15.120]  isn't that amazing it's a big issue if jake tapper or an intern from the daily caller named
[02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:21.280]  finger asks a question a real question to a in a white house press conference now if you go up
[02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:29.360]  and ask an epa chief a question you get arrested by the capital police that's the state of where we
[02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:35.760]  are in this country and where they start talking about giving official journalists some kind of a
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:42.080]  shield that's baloney they're using that to shut down everybody except their mouthpieces
[02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:46.160]  now i was just talking to jerry slenty and and jerald you brought up the
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:52.640]  issue of corporate fascism corporatism crony capitalism whatever you want to call it it's
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:58.800]  corruption listen to this story that kit daniels just put up on info wars dot com an auto insurance
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:04.240]  company in california is tracking drivers by gps and charging them per mile driven now we've talked
[02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:10.640]  a lot about taxes per mile driven and how as they've pushed people to become more and more
[02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:15.520]  fuel efficient with gasoline they're losing gasoline revenue so they've got to keep those
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:20.640]  taxes on us so now they're going to start with the black boxes seeing how many miles we drive and
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:24.960]  taxing us by the mile but they're not waiting for that in california they had the insurance
[02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:30.560]  commissioner there steve posner green lighted a per mile insurance pricing way back in 2009
[02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:36.640]  now it's happening here we are five years later we've got a california insurance company that is
[02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:42.720]  wirelessly sending mileage data to the insurance company that charges a base rate of two to five
[02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:48.160]  cents a mile there we go and can even record the route driven by the policy holder that probably
[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:52.560]  look at your speed and and write you up and increase your insurance rates based on the speed
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:57.040]  you're driving to who knows what they can do because these guys are acting like the government
[02:35:57.040 --> 02:36:01.520]  aren't they gerald so what we've seen with obama care obama care is nothing but corporate fascism
[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:07.120]  written to transfer massive wealth transfer from the american people to these corporate fascist
[02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:10.720]  insurance companies who have been in bed with the government for the longest time we see it
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:14.880]  for the longest period of time in the automobile side but now we're seeing it in health care right
[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:20.160]  yes and it's and they're putting the small doctors out of business the conglomerates
[02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:26.400]  are all taking over buying out doctors businesses all over the country and uh you can no longer
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:34.160]  just like there's no more retail stores virtually i think we lost 65 000 retail outlets private
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:41.440]  small businesses since 2008 everything's being consolidated into the hands of the few it's not
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:48.400]  that the government is doing what the corporations want the corporations are the government yeah
[02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:54.480]  well the gang of 535 as senators and congressmen are they're just the wise guys for the for the
[02:36:54.480 --> 02:37:00.320]  for the corporations and the banks everything has been consolidated it's slave landia that's
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:06.000]  all it is it bothers me a lot to yeah and gerald you know bothers me a lot to see this auto insurance
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:10.400]  situation here because when they were talking about forcing people to buy health insurance
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:14.480]  from the government ever you had the liberals say well we've been forcing people to buy automobile
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:18.720]  insurance for a long time what's the matter with that i i said yeah we shouldn't be forcing people
[02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:23.520]  to buy automobile insurance now they're charging people by the mile driven and they're gonna they're
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:27.920]  gonna basically put us out of our cars once they have self-drive cars they're going to
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:32.240]  to raise your rates so high you won't be able to drive a car anymore you're gonna have to buy one of
[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:37.120]  there if you want to afford the insurance you're going to buy one of their self-drive cars well
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:43.440]  again you know it's it's the takeover as i said when when the bailouts first began the two big
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:53.360]  to fails the headline that we wrote when this first happened on the bush was dc heist wall street
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:38:01.040]  hijacks washington yeah so all it is it's a hijack and all we are are where the slaves and slave
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:07.760]  landia to keep their trip going look when i was a young guy there were no such thing as hedge funds
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:15.200]  there were no private equity groups there were no venture capitalists this is all being monopolized
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:22.000]  by the hands of a few look at the numbers what do you have in the united states you have 400 people
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:28.880]  that are in control of two trillion dollars oh yeah so you know we're just we're just working
[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:34.080]  you know we're just the this is better than a plantation economy because you don't even have
[02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:40.240]  to house a feed us that's right look at the live or scandal look what these guys can get away with
[02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:47.760]  us absolutely amazing as bad as tarp was as bad as everything that happened in 2008 2009 they just
[02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:52.480]  keep piling on scandal after scandal when we see this kind of stuff when we see these kind of
[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:58.160]  astronomical numbers of billions of trillions of dollars involved in these live or scandals
[02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:03.040]  what do you make of these bankers suicides gel well you know before we get on to that one go
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:12.880]  on to the forex if this is a currency market yeah five three trillion dollars a day traded and of
[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:18.640]  course there are those scandals going on as well and then of course you know before i get on to that
[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:24.320]  you asked me about gold before and i talked about the stimulus that's going on now in china and the
[02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:31.520]  ecb the point that i want to make david that the more stimulus that they push in the more they're
[02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:37.680]  going to be devaluing currencies the more they devalue currencies the higher the price of gold
[02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:46.880]  is going to go so what's going on now is that china and the ecb are now fronting for the fed
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:54.000]  so the fed saying we're tapering while they're juicing on the other side you know so watch the
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:40:00.320]  fingers they never leave the hand you know so the same thing is going on the bankers suicides
[02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:07.200]  well street journal just came out with a a story a couple of days ago about one of the bankers
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:15.200]  that committed suicide in london from chicago originally and he's with deuter bank the car
[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:24.880]  these left multiple suicide notes they will not release them and in interviews by journalists
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:32.480]  they're they're hearing that the guy was freaking out because of the pressure on him that was
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:40.400]  mounting about the scandals going on behind the scenes and again these aren't it's not fiction
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:50.720]  a hundred million dollars worth of fines these are criminal acts but i got a better name for him
[02:40:50.720 --> 02:41:00.240]  we're going to call it misdeeds how about misselling how about misrepresented you know so of course
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:06.960]  these guys and mistakes were made mistakes were made weren't they charled we're going to correct them
[02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:13.440]  we're going to correct them and so these guys are under pressure obviously when you read a story
[02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:22.080]  like that but here's the but here's really the thing david how many more fines have to be paid
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:31.360]  how many much more of this corruption has to be exposed so what some more guys kill themselves
[02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:39.520]  there's no it's there in front of everybody now the facts are in front of everyone now
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:49.040]  how to see what a criminal operation they call the banking system is oh yeah we've had a whistleblower
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:56.080]  from hsbc and of course they were caught laundering a great deal of money for the drug cartels as well
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:00.720]  as for groups that have been identified as terrorist organizations by the american government
[02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:05.040]  and they got the slap on the risk and the eric holder justice department said no we can't really
[02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:10.080]  shut them down they're too big right they're too big to jail and at the same time they were doing
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:14.720]  that they said we're going to hire more people to watch these money transfers and the whistleblower
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:18.960]  that we had was one of the people that they hired and he said that they were putting stuff
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:23.840]  into their databases to make sure that certain keywords are not being flagged so they would
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:28.160]  basically put a space in a word that would be a keyword or they put a period in the word to
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:33.200]  make sure that didn't happen it was a joke they continued doing the same thing they've been
[02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:40.400]  doing why because they've never been punished for it because eric holder is in jokes yes yeah oh
[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:48.080]  he said too big to jail you know that if if if we clamp down on these big banks it might
[02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:56.240]  destabilize the world economy i tell you that's basically what he said so again don't run a bus
[02:42:56.240 --> 02:43:04.640]  company with a family operation don't shake walk don't be on the other night we're out
[02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:12.720]  we're driving the cop they pull us over the woman had a bright lights on they'll bust your chops
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:19.600]  for anything yeah oh yeah this is what we're paying for with they turn us into a police state
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:24.640]  it's fascism and if the people and again the elections are coming up what are you gonna vote
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:32.400]  for the republican gang or the democratic gang it's a two-party political mafia yeah we've just
[02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:40.480]  seen just yesterday we saw that the republicans in the house started moving phisa reform to the
[02:43:40.480 --> 02:43:44.240]  intelligence committee away from the judiciary committee because the judiciary committee has
[02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:48.000]  been concerned about these civil liberties abuses so they move it over to the guys who've
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:51.520]  been the cheerleaders for this kind of action all along that's what we're seeing from the
[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:57.200]  republicans that's what we see from people like mike rogers michelle bachman bainer these are guys
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:02.240]  who are writing the laws these are guys who are aiding and abetting these criminals who are violating
[02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:08.480]  the fourth amendment for everybody for everyone yeah and again look i just read about jimmy carter
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:15.520]  we did it in secret oh they lied to us right is that what you're saying jimmy you know and i these
[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:23.760]  guys you know that always jesus christ oh yeah what a bunch of hypocrites what a hypocrite how about
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:31.040]  a mass murderer jimmy could you handle that one that's right that's right it's very sad to see people
[02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:37.360]  who profess to be christians so bloodthirsty i remember when ron paul went to the republican party
[02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:42.080]  and got booed because he quoted jesus i mean you know these people wear their christianity
[02:44:42.080 --> 02:44:47.120]  as as a as a wolf wears sheep's clothing is the way they're wearing it
[02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:55.200]  yeah so as we're looking at what's going on we're very concerned of course with Ukraine
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:45:02.160]  i mean this thing is it's these sanctions as ron paul said are in effect an act of war
[02:45:02.160 --> 02:45:07.280]  because you're stopping people from doing business and they're building the acts of war
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:16.960]  war and the if it keeps going in this direction i'm very concerned about just as you were pointing
[02:45:16.960 --> 02:45:24.080]  out this we're making the news about the the overt that's become out now because it's on tape
[02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:33.520]  of turkeys false flag attempts to start a war with syria last week they shot down a syrian jet
[02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:40.560]  of a syrian territory and said they went over into into turkish territory and now it's reported as
[02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:48.880]  you have on your site that turkish was a foreign minister and defense minister talking about a
[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:54.640]  false flag attack right it seems like turkey is the it seems like turkey is the point of the spear
[02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:59.520]  now and trying to provoke this war with syria that nato and the us and all these globalists have
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:06.880]  wanted for several years and why look what's going on in syria with the prime minister urtigan
[02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:13.200]  you know the demonstrations virtually every day that the turkish lead is that it is at an
[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:19.440]  all-time low the hot money that was flowing in with the tape before when stimulus is all
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:27.360]  flowing out the economy is going down mass demonstrations when all else fails they take
[02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:36.320]  you to war yes and that's what i fear now they're taking us to war and again when you look at what
[02:46:36.320 --> 02:46:42.400]  what's going on the anti-russian sentiments that are building up in this country we were writing
[02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:48.320]  about it as it was happening it started before the so she olympics hey you know they're killing all
[02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:58.720]  them stray dogs over there don't drink the water it's all yellow all those homophobes oh the toothpaste
[02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:07.200]  bomb don't get on a plane go into so she from credible sources we found out they have toothpaste
[02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:13.360]  bombs you can't make this crap up a toothpaste bomb i got a better one they also then came out
[02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:21.760]  with a credible source after that shoe bombs yeah how about tampax missiles well you know
[02:47:21.760 --> 02:47:25.920]  one of the things that this guy in turkish said this is actually a quote when this when he was
[02:47:25.920 --> 02:47:32.800]  exposed plotting a false flag attack on his own soldiers in his own territory in order to start
[02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:38.480]  a war with syria and blame it on syria he said this incident reveals the level of cyber and
[02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:43.360]  electronic threats posed against our country why because they put it up on youtube the ring this
[02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:47.760]  rings of treason behind the at these rings of treason behind this actor enemies of our state
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:54.640]  of nation they've already shut down twitter and they shut down youtube because that is a cyber
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:59.360]  threat to them youtube when youtube is a cyber threat to you you've got problems in the government
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:06.160]  don't you and what you're looking at david when you read the the sickness of this guy's mind
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:15.760]  this is going on around the world and this is very reminiscent of world war one where you had
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:22.000]  deranged people sick people both in military and in government that started a totally useless
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:28.160]  needless war that slaughtered millions tens of millions and destroyed europe just as it was
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:35.120]  growing culturally and scientifically and in so many wonderful ways destroyed it and set the stage
[02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:43.360]  what's going on now and it's being repeated again who in their right mind could listen to that little
[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:51.040]  guy over there in france halan you want to see a little geek you missed him go over and watch
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:56.640]  cameron i think he's one of those boys that got caught in those little boy schools over there
[02:48:56.640 --> 02:49:04.400]  with all the scandals going on because look at this little loudmouth chicken hawk one after another
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:09.760]  look at congress look at all the tough talk coming out from all these guys and not one
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:17.680]  man or woman among them it's like carter i sent arms i what do you mean i you didn't do anything
[02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:23.280]  you send somebody else to do your dirty work yeah we look at these we look at these executive orders
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:28.240]  that obama put out i mean they look like the alien and sedition acts of 2014 where he says
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:33.680]  you criticize ukraine that i created then i'm not gonna let you into the country you criticize

[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:48.720]  he claims that by the authority that he has invested in him by the constitution well no if you
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:53.760]  violate the constitution you no longer have any authority if you violate what you swore an oath
[02:49:53.760 --> 02:50:03.120]  to uphold oh it's like jimmy caught it god invested in me there you go yeah but i'm telling you we have
[02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:10.960]  we have psychopaths in charge but there's closet psychopaths and sociopaths again is why i'm saying

[02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:45.600]  going to ban it in brazil guess what they're not going to ban it here in america because just as
[02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:50.480]  we've been talking to jeryl salenti about the corporations are in control of our government

[02:55:48.240 --> 02:55:51.760]  that's right those things that you can't pronounce those things that i can't pronounce you don't
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:56.320]  want to be eating those that's bad it's really bad if it's so long that you can't pronounce it
[02:55:56.320 --> 02:56:00.880]  that i can't pronounce it don't drink it jeryl what do you want to tell us what do you think
[02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:04.640]  things are headed what what do you think is going to happen with interest rates you think they're
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:08.560]  going to go up before the election or they're going to spy come after the election what what's
[02:56:08.560 --> 02:56:13.280]  your well they have to go up they're going to go up and when interest rates go up the economy
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:17.920]  goes down it's as simple as that this this was an interest rate recovery you see it already with
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:24.160]  housing prices with the housing sales the more the 30 year mortgage goes up the sales goes as simple
[02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:29.040]  as that and it's the same thing with the with the autos and on and on and on it's the the low
[02:56:29.040 --> 02:56:34.240]  interest rates when interest rates go up the economy on period paragraph and that's why i
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:37.360]  believe they're going to come out with another stimulus program maybe they'll call it yellow
[02:56:37.360 --> 02:56:43.120]  and omics or something under a new name and and the things to watch again what's going on around
[02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:50.240]  the world not only of course in ukraine it's not making the news tens of thousands of spanish
[02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:58.480]  students are out on the streets as we speak there's been protests last week millions millions
[02:56:58.480 --> 02:57:05.280]  throughout spain protesting and in portugal not making the news at all you have youth unemployment
[02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:13.920]  around the world india crisis china 25 percent of the college grads can't find jobs other than
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:20.880]  working in a slave factory so what we'll do what we're seeing here is a buildup of pressure what
[02:57:20.880 --> 02:57:26.880]  will be the fault's flag that ignites it well by the way they had a run on a chinese bank the other
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:35.440]  day barely made the news and and of course they quiet it right down so china's biggest fear by the way
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:42.080]  is its people they got 1.2 billion of them and they get them out of control you're you know you're
[02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:46.720]  in a lot of trouble that's right and then we're watching at in japan which you mentioned about
[02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:52.960]  the gold rush going on because sales tax are going up and you have this abbey over there that keeps
[02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:59.280]  banging the war drum against china on the disputes in the south china sea so these are the things to
[02:57:59.280 --> 02:58:05.920]  really be keyed into and i want to mention this we're coming out with the new trends journal in
[02:58:05.920 --> 02:58:14.720]  mid april and one of the focuses that we're working on is we're starting an occupy peace movement
[02:58:14.720 --> 02:58:22.160]  it's going to be occupy peace dot us it's only for americans every country should have their own
[02:58:22.160 --> 02:58:32.160]  and it's based on three simple words no foreign entanglements yes yes well i second that it that's
