[08:55.480 --> 09:04.240]  McAdoo and Gigi Ernetta both in studio here today at the bottom of the next
[09:04.240 --> 09:08.680]  hour because I want to play a short report that Gigi went out and shot on
[09:08.680 --> 09:14.800]  the road in Austin yesterday afternoon versus a report that Leanne McAdoo went
[09:14.800 --> 09:20.080]  on the streets of Austin yesterday and shot that were both on the nightly news
[09:20.080 --> 09:25.000]  last night they went downtown and found one group of trendies who said they want
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  the NSA spying on everything they do kind of like the Miss USA pageant where
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.320]  they were all this year begging to be spied on for everyone's safety versus
[09:34.320 --> 09:39.120]  people out calling for the impeachment of Obama for illegal NSA spying the
[09:39.120 --> 09:45.600]  light in their eyes the intelligence of the pro-liberty people who are as
[09:45.600 --> 09:53.920]  different from the Obama sheeple as living are from the dead so we're gonna
[09:53.920 --> 09:58.400]  get both of our reporters both of our female reporters who do a great job in
[09:58.400 --> 10:03.920]  studio with us at the bottom of the next hour and and then I'm going to send
[10:03.920 --> 10:10.720]  all my reporters out on the street to really go out and challenge people on
[10:10.720 --> 10:14.920]  average in Austin about 60% say they want to have the fourth amendment
[10:14.920 --> 10:18.880]  annihilated and think it's wonderful to have the government watching everything
[10:18.880 --> 10:22.880]  they do and I want to send my reporters out to say okay but Nazi Germany and
[10:22.880 --> 10:26.760]  Soviet Russia did that and why did we have a bill of rights the Constitution
[10:26.760 --> 10:31.640]  saying that was illegal and by the way do you know that's illegal how dare you
[10:31.640 --> 10:36.880]  I'm so busy working on Obama deception to and doing the radio show and doing
[10:36.880 --> 10:39.560]  radio interviews and working on administrative stuff and trying to
[10:39.560 --> 10:44.000]  build new sites and apps and all the stuff I'm trying to administer here that
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.480]  I don't have a lot of time to go out on the streets but I need to go out on the
[10:46.480 --> 10:51.240]  streets and I think I said I do this a few weeks ago so I guess the time has
[10:51.240 --> 10:56.720]  come the time is now I should probably go out in the next couple days and do
[10:56.720 --> 11:03.760]  it maybe even the day and go up to citizens cars and say mind if I search
[11:03.760 --> 11:09.800]  your vehicle I'm part of you know Homeland Security Militia Brigade
[11:09.800 --> 11:14.560]  of course they could then spin it and say that why you're impersonating the
[11:14.560 --> 11:19.400]  FEMA youth corps just to illustrate though how pliant some people are and
[11:19.400 --> 11:26.200]  then go over to police cars and just say I'm part of the citizen tattletale
[11:26.200 --> 11:30.280]  squad for Obama and I'm gonna be like well wait I'm just volunteering I mean
[11:30.280 --> 11:33.520]  they've got billboards going up all over the country saying report your
[11:33.520 --> 11:40.040]  neighbors you know showing sexy ladies pushing it it's all over the news that
[11:40.040 --> 11:46.040]  this is the new freedom so officer I'm just asking voluntarily do you mind if I
[11:46.040 --> 11:49.840]  search your car you might be a terrorist too I mean we're oh why are you
[11:49.840 --> 11:54.000]  offended officer I wouldn't send my crew out to do this cuz they might arrest me
[11:54.000 --> 12:00.160]  because so many people are brainwashing arrogant if I run into Austin cops and
[12:00.160 --> 12:03.240]  who I am they'll probably start laughing at me but I mean I want to find one who
[12:03.240 --> 12:06.880]  will who will get offended cuz you film police around the country a lot of them
[12:06.880 --> 12:10.600]  flip out and come arrest you outside of law and go well why are you offended I
[12:10.600 --> 12:15.440]  mean you got face-changing cameras up license plate reading cameras and you
[12:15.440 --> 12:19.400]  got whole databases on people it's all completely illegal and you're doing that
[12:19.400 --> 12:24.920]  forcibly with my tax money enslaving me with my own fruit of my labor being
[12:24.920 --> 12:29.840]  extracted and used to build this giant corporate Borg singularity takeover
[12:29.840 --> 12:34.280]  nightmare grid I'm here trying to defend your rights officer so I'm asking to
[12:34.280 --> 12:37.600]  illustrate absurdity let me search your vehicle well no you're not gonna search
[12:37.600 --> 12:42.200]  my vehicle what do you have to hide officer what do I have to hide get up
[12:42.200 --> 12:48.520]  against the wall and at that point I'm gonna say so it's so shocking that I'm
[12:48.520 --> 12:51.520]  asking to search your vehicle you're you're trying to put me in handcuffs
[12:51.520 --> 12:56.760]  right now this is gonna be powerful folks and I'm I'm going to go out and do
[12:56.760 --> 13:02.800]  this yeah Mark dice did it a few months ago something similar where he went out
[13:02.800 --> 13:07.960]  on the streets we posted the video and info wars calm forget the exact name of
[13:07.960 --> 13:11.680]  maybe try to pull it up and and he went out and said I'm here with you know the
[13:11.680 --> 13:16.480]  citizens Obama volunteers and they said see something says I think might have I
[13:16.480 --> 13:20.840]  search your car might have I search your person and some people said yeah go
[13:20.840 --> 13:26.680]  ahead because they their religion is being compliant their religion is
[13:26.680 --> 13:31.400]  bending over their religion as long as you say for Obama we should arrest all
[13:31.400 --> 13:35.560]  the gun owners and put them in FEMA camps for Obama oh yes 9 out of 10 said
[13:35.560 --> 13:40.840]  yes we should euthanize all the old people for Obama kill them yes for
[13:40.840 --> 13:44.880]  Obama we should open the borders completely up and bring in world
[13:44.880 --> 13:50.720]  government for Obama yes for Obama and I found that as well with Democrats
[13:50.720 --> 13:55.840]  especially I could say we're gonna kill babies up to age three for Obama in
[13:55.840 --> 14:00.480]  fact this has been done by multiple groups yes for Obama because their whole
[14:00.480 --> 14:04.320]  identity is with hey I'm not intellectual I don't have any real
[14:04.320 --> 14:09.640]  historical perspective I don't know what I culturally stand for I don't know who
[14:09.640 --> 14:14.280]  my ancestors were I don't know about all the wars and the countless people that
[14:14.280 --> 14:19.000]  died in the dark for the light of liberty many people have died in the
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.520]  dark in defense of liberty folks alone in pain being tortured being killed
[14:23.520 --> 14:27.160]  bleeding to death on foreign fields and right here in this country I mean it is
[14:27.160 --> 14:31.960]  incredible the human history of the fight against gangs that get together and
[14:31.960 --> 14:35.800]  call themselves governments and that call themselves systems and unleash hell
[14:35.800 --> 14:44.520]  every time and now the hell if there was a cup a big stinking scruffulous cess
[14:44.520 --> 14:51.200]  cup of disease and tyranny and the constitutions being imploded in the
[14:51.200 --> 14:57.040]  table is rocking and rumbling and only sloshing tyranny has come out so far and
[14:57.040 --> 15:01.080]  the sheep will see it and get scared that they really know what's going on
[15:01.080 --> 15:06.320]  deep down on their feeble minds but they decide to serve it and comply with it in
[15:06.320 --> 15:10.560]  a mass Stockholm syndrome believing that that will then somehow give them a
[15:10.560 --> 15:18.200]  reprieve so the cup is sloshing and only only a few drops had splattered in
[15:18.200 --> 15:23.480]  the last decade or so now now larger projections of it are splattering on the
[15:23.480 --> 15:28.320]  table but still the cups about eighty five percent full and it's getting ready
[15:28.320 --> 15:34.800]  to completely top over and by the way if we let it top over it suddenly becomes a
[15:34.800 --> 15:42.560]  bottomless cup like a fire hose is attached to it spewing evil and as soon
[15:42.560 --> 15:46.480]  as the public goes under the intimidation goes under the fear and says I
[15:46.480 --> 15:51.400]  will comply that's when the three-year-old is in the front yard and the
[15:51.400 --> 15:57.080]  man says I have the candy and the little kids scared their instinct is run but
[15:57.080 --> 16:00.680]  they say come here now and the little kid gets in the van and is never seen
[16:00.680 --> 16:06.720]  again it's tortured in a basement for months that's what those those those
[16:06.720 --> 16:11.200]  demons do it's a it's an archetype it's a spirit even though we believe in God
[16:11.200 --> 16:16.160]  it's a spirit and that's what the globalists want they want full control
[16:16.160 --> 16:24.320]  so societally they can have us all in the basement and and a torture our
[16:24.320 --> 16:31.520]  innocence the real target is innocence in beauty and goodness they want to kill
[16:31.520 --> 16:38.240]  the unicorn folks that's because that's what they do their demons use the
[16:38.240 --> 16:45.720]  analogy of legend and they use well-meaning miss America miss USA they
[16:45.720 --> 16:50.000]  use all the well-meaning shallow people out there to sell their agenda of
[16:50.000 --> 16:56.120]  torture war invasion surveillance all of it because innocence is the face of it
[16:56.120 --> 17:00.800]  they say we're doing this to protect innocence but it's actually the opposite
[17:00.800 --> 17:06.560]  they're doing it to sell absolute hell on earth everywhere the globalists are
[17:06.560 --> 17:12.320]  in control they bring down societies they eviscerate the family they cut off the
[17:12.320 --> 17:19.280]  food and water they starve the population they bring in absolute bondage and

[18:17.320 --> 18:20.760]  speaking for liberty and freedom and justice who have an instinct to have a
[18:20.760 --> 18:26.720]  spirit of defense of freedom and who understand the grave danger we're
[18:26.720 --> 18:39.760]  entering versus the supine sycophantic dead eyes of the servants of evil so we're

[24:28.920 --> 24:32.080]  goes on to say odds of dying a terrorist attack a lot lower than dying in a car
[24:32.080 --> 24:38.360]  accident unfortunately mm-hmm and then Leno says how about solving problems that
[24:38.360 --> 24:42.080]  brought our country to a halt oh he's solving him he's shutting down the power
[24:42.080 --> 24:47.040]  plant shipping the jobs overseas he's continuing the globalist operation so
[24:47.040 --> 24:50.680]  we're gonna be playing those clips and analyzing that but first off I want to
[24:50.680 --> 24:55.480]  say something here today give our forebears could see what we were doing
[24:55.480 --> 25:04.760]  right now give our forebears could look down from heaven or look up from Hades
[25:04.760 --> 25:11.280]  depending on where they're at do you think they would be ashamed of all that
[25:11.280 --> 25:15.040]  they fought for so we'd have basic dignity and liberty in every other
[25:15.040 --> 25:19.040]  culture in the world whoever was in charge the nobles the king their
[25:19.040 --> 25:22.360]  minions the sheriff could just come in your house and have sex with your wife
[25:22.360 --> 25:26.920]  in front of you that was their divine right they could kill you if you looked
[25:26.920 --> 25:32.720]  at them wrong and the entire world was in total poverty except for the elites
[25:32.720 --> 25:36.800]  and their armored compounds and it was just thousands of years of degradation
[25:36.800 --> 25:41.800]  and dehumanization since humans stopped being agrarian hunter-gatherers
[25:41.800 --> 25:45.880]  hunter-gatherers and the negrarians it allowed centralization and allowed a
[25:45.880 --> 25:50.520]  ruling class of parasites who learned how to manipulate people and civilization
[25:50.520 --> 25:55.400]  has been infested ever since and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment and
[25:55.400 --> 26:00.200]  the the the Christian values whether you like them or not brought forward ideas
[26:00.200 --> 26:06.640]  that created a light in the world in a dark age and it created the science the
[26:06.640 --> 26:10.560]  technology we have today that's now been co-opted and used to enslave and now
[26:10.560 --> 26:15.040]  we're seeing the mass domestication but but there's no doubt from a historical
[26:15.040 --> 26:18.880]  perspective and no historian denies this now but it's all over the news now that
[26:18.880 --> 26:23.720]  we're a corrupt empire we're a tyranny but that's for people that know how to
[26:23.720 --> 26:26.800]  read and people that know how to wipe their noses and know how to tie their
[26:26.800 --> 26:32.400]  shoelaces you have got a large part of the population that are a bunch of TV
[26:32.400 --> 26:37.400]  heads who literally have imprinted from birth on the sitcom type people that
[26:37.400 --> 26:41.960]  act like gibbering idiots and who have no idea the world they're entering you
[26:41.960 --> 26:46.280]  know in England in many areas of Europe if you defend yourself with your fist in
[26:46.280 --> 26:51.680]  your home while being assaulted by a robber you go to jail if gypsies rob
[26:51.680 --> 26:55.640]  your house and you defend yourself you're arrested and put in jail longer
[26:55.640 --> 27:00.440]  than a murderer would be if gypsies or other groups steal your travel trailer
[27:00.440 --> 27:06.200]  they get to keep it that was in the news last week because the only group that is
[27:06.200 --> 27:11.520]  targeted is the law-abiding milk cow citizens and I've had members of
[27:11.520 --> 27:16.400]  parliament on from England to talk about this how most the social services are
[27:16.400 --> 27:20.520]  foreigners that don't even speak English there this is a plan folks this is a
[27:20.520 --> 27:26.320]  takeover when they're done taking over folks look out there's all these groups
[27:26.320 --> 27:29.600]  that have been allowed to run wild they're gonna get lined up and shot but
[27:29.600 --> 27:33.000]  right now they're bringing down the society and demoralizing us here's an
[27:33.000 --> 27:39.120]  article out of news 9 NBC out of Colorado Castle Rock retired Marine art

[27:46.920 --> 27:50.640]  armed when he first rented it so if any lawyer knew what they were doing we
[27:50.640 --> 27:54.080]  ought to tell this old guy 77 year old retired Marie and others that they've
[27:54.080 --> 27:58.520]  got at least until their current lease is up to get out the apartment is on
[27:58.520 --> 28:01.560]  record lying saying you got to leave right now if you don't do it that's all

[34:22.520 --> 34:26.640]  in England to ban people even being able to own butcher knives you'll get a
[34:26.640 --> 34:34.360]  special license over in the good old UK to be able to have a knife and of course
[34:34.360 --> 34:39.200]  that goes back to feudalism if you go back just to England only 500 years
[34:39.200 --> 34:43.600]  ago or so and you had to have a license to have a knife that had a point on it
[34:43.600 --> 34:48.000]  because you couldn't have the slaves being able to fight back if you had a
[34:48.000 --> 34:53.960]  dog you had to have a license and if it was a sheepdog it had to have some of
[34:53.960 --> 34:58.640]  the digits some of the pads cut off the foot this was done all over Europe so
[34:58.640 --> 35:03.520]  that it couldn't chase the Kings game and it matter of you were starving to death
[35:03.520 --> 35:07.600]  in the winter and had to give most your food what you produced to the local noble
[35:07.600 --> 35:11.280]  who was you know two feet taller than you from generations of getting plenty of
[35:11.280 --> 35:15.560]  food and then they wrote manuals on how to starve people generationally to
[35:15.560 --> 35:18.640]  mentally retardate them so they'd be more controllable that's all part of
[35:18.640 --> 35:22.240]  their long-term globalist operation it's just an instinctive feudalistic
[35:22.240 --> 35:27.680]  domination now they do it through the vaccines and the GMOs and the stuff in
[35:27.680 --> 35:32.440]  the water and all the malnutrition with the fast food and the rest of it but to
[35:32.440 --> 35:36.880]  make a long story short you know I mean it was documented many documented cases
[35:36.880 --> 35:42.720]  if you were caught they would they rode by and smelled meat and they would come
[35:42.720 --> 35:45.920]  in and look in your cook pot and catch you with a rabbit bone they would
[35:45.920 --> 35:50.760]  normally take one of your kids out and slit their throat and hey I say they did
[35:50.760 --> 35:54.080]  it for everybody's own safety I support government I'm not anti-government I
[35:54.080 --> 35:58.080]  think our ancestors were wrong to fight against that I think they all deserve to
[35:58.080 --> 36:03.760]  have their throat slit and hey I've seen a lot of people on info wars.com and on
[36:03.760 --> 36:09.240]  the YouTube it's a minority but they're an active vicious minority up there
[36:09.240 --> 36:14.720]  saying that that little two-year-old girl Alexandria Hill who got her head
[36:14.720 --> 36:21.080]  bashed in reportedly by the social worker that had her in her clutches that
[36:21.080 --> 36:24.480]  you know that's the parents fault for smoking pot and people reporting them
[36:24.480 --> 36:28.880]  for smoking pot and that you know it's their fault so see it's not your fault
[36:28.880 --> 36:33.400]  that that little girl's dead government that you're right it's it's the parents
[36:33.400 --> 36:37.240]  good job and it's not your fault kids are seven times more likely to be abused
[36:37.240 --> 36:42.000]  physically or sexually or die in the federally controlled foster care
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.840]  systems across the country you're right everything's the people's fault nothing
[36:46.840 --> 36:51.360]  is your fault I guess the 20 point IQ reduction on average from 60 years of
[36:51.360 --> 36:55.360]  fluoride in the water Harvard study yes that's our fault too I guess the
[36:55.360 --> 36:59.100]  diabetes up 3,000 plus percent I guess that's our fault too I guess the
[36:59.100 --> 37:03.720]  Gardasil sterilizing people and killing them all over the country and Japan and
[37:03.720 --> 37:08.080]  India banning it I guess that's our fault too everything's the the
[37:08.080 --> 37:11.600]  individuals fault nothing is the government's fault and it's going to be
[37:11.600 --> 37:15.480]  your fault when the government takes your government pension funds just
[37:15.480 --> 37:20.080]  remember that just remember that and you're real good you know up there
[37:20.080 --> 37:26.360]  talking bad about a dead two-year-old there's also real people on the profile
[37:26.360 --> 37:31.440]  black racist on YouTube because I've seen these same handles for a long time
[37:31.440 --> 37:34.480]  and seeing their videos there these are real people celebrating the death of a
[37:34.480 --> 37:38.800]  two-year-old white child because they agree with what was the name dr. Khalid
[37:38.800 --> 37:43.480]  Muhammad that you kill the women you kill the children because the white
[37:43.480 --> 37:48.800]  woman is the military manufacturing center and every nine months she lays
[37:48.800 --> 37:54.200]  down on the back and reinforcements roll out people thought I was joking a few
[37:54.200 --> 37:57.320]  weeks ago and I actually played that clip of the new black Panther Party leader
[37:57.320 --> 38:01.680]  that's an exact quote by the way we're gonna play Leno but I want to get to
[38:01.680 --> 38:07.640]  the I want to get to the that clip since I said that and play that you know
[38:07.640 --> 38:12.800]  where's Al Sharpton to crying that no no no because again it's all meant to
[38:12.800 --> 38:18.120]  create divide and conquer if you say it's we're gonna brown bag it that's racist
[38:18.120 --> 38:21.960]  even though no one ever said brown paper I didn't do it race means to do the
[38:21.960 --> 38:26.640]  little shopping bag the little bags you bought to get your lunch in but doesn't
[38:26.640 --> 38:31.560]  matter all the stuff that isn't really racist that is what we obsess on not the
[38:31.560 --> 38:35.320]  mass abortion not the globalist operation against all of us it is a
[38:35.320 --> 38:42.040]  scientific murderous culture aimed at all humans now speaking of Jay Leno you
[38:42.040 --> 38:46.920]  know Jay Leno we got contacted about a month ago about what I'd be interested
[38:46.920 --> 38:49.960]  to go on there and I said of course and then I never heard anything back I would
[38:49.960 --> 38:52.680]  actually fly out there to be on Jay Leno show that would I mean he's played
[38:52.680 --> 38:57.000]  clips of me on there even 16 years ago and then earlier this year multiple times
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.960]  this year but I so technically I've been on the show playing clips but I would
[39:00.960 --> 39:05.560]  like to technically physically go out there that would be fun and I'm told
[39:05.560 --> 39:08.640]  behind the scenes Jay's a listener but we'll see if that happens because you
[39:08.640 --> 39:13.800]  need to call me up and get me on but you know Jay says to you know in the clip
[39:13.800 --> 39:18.000]  the full clips up on info wars.com how about solving problems that brought our
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.240]  country to a halt it's also up on drudge report.com and and Obama went on to
[39:23.240 --> 39:28.080]  say odds of dying in a terrorist attack a lot lower than dying in a car accident
[39:28.080 --> 39:33.680]  unfortunately and I see what Obama's saying unfortunately there's hundreds of
[39:33.680 --> 39:37.160]  thousands of car accident deaths a year and not even a hundred terrorist attacks
[39:37.160 --> 39:40.560]  but they're getting rid of our entire system because they ran the attacks and
[39:40.560 --> 39:45.400]  and run out kind of today but just the way it comes off yes unfortunately and
[39:45.400 --> 39:50.840]  yes you if you could get away with staging some more events you would. The
[39:50.840 --> 39:53.920]  problem is whether it's the underwear bombing or the Boston bombing we're
[39:53.920 --> 39:57.600]  all watching or whether it's the murder of Michael Heistens we're all watching
[39:57.600 --> 40:02.280]  and I mean it's even in the again New York Times CBS News people going oh this
[40:02.280 --> 40:06.240]  has been done because of the NSA spying took you know to legitimize it because
[40:06.240 --> 40:11.720]  it's as plain as the nose on your face but here's Obama just like yesterday I
[40:11.720 --> 40:14.640]  played for congressman Paul former congressman Paul here on the air and he
[40:14.640 --> 40:19.040]  called them liars I think that's pretty newsworthy I think one of my writers ought
[40:19.040 --> 40:25.360]  to write about that Ron Paul on the show saying the NSA head is a liar about not
[40:25.360 --> 40:29.320]  spying on Americans because it's on record they do but they know you won't go
[40:29.320 --> 40:33.640]  look look up the admitted congressional reports you won't go look up the Reuters
[40:33.640 --> 40:39.320]  report now three days old where they go okay it's confirmed if you talk about
[40:39.320 --> 40:43.560]  marijuana on the phone it's given to local police it's all being recorded it's
[40:43.560 --> 40:49.640]  all totally illegal it's all selectively enforced and then Obama lies and says we
[40:49.640 --> 40:55.360]  don't target we don't spy on Americans they don't call it spying they call it
[40:55.360 --> 40:59.360]  the definition of a 36 year old court case that used to just be the address of
[40:59.360 --> 41:03.320]  where communications came from and that itself I believe is unconstitutional
[41:03.320 --> 41:09.680]  clearly they call you talking you texting you emailing faxing radio TV
[41:09.680 --> 41:16.960]  sham radio that's called signals and that's called metadata to them it'd be
[41:16.960 --> 41:21.800]  like if you said I don't kill elephants I call that a hump-a-lump and you shoot
[41:21.800 --> 41:25.520]  it with a with a you know 50 caliber rival it falls over you know that's an
[41:25.520 --> 41:30.560]  elephant no I call that a hump-a-lump or I call that an Easter Bunny with really
[41:30.560 --> 41:36.080]  big flappy ears or I call that a hog wart I mean they play all these lawyer
[41:36.080 --> 41:42.800]  games with people and they sit there laughing as just a big swarm of criminals
[41:42.800 --> 41:47.720]  and and corporate mercenaries and and and foreign lobbyists that can come in
[41:47.720 --> 41:52.640]  and literally I was seeing different metrics they vary from the articles I've
[41:52.640 --> 41:56.600]  seen where you give a thousand dollars you get two hundred thousand dollars back
[41:56.600 --> 42:00.240]  in government contracts and subsidies you give a hundred thousand dollars you
[42:00.240 --> 42:06.080]  get a billion dollars in some cases I mean it it's just it it it is a orgy of
[42:06.080 --> 42:12.440]  robbery and criminality and all of them above the law just collapse of society
[42:12.440 --> 42:19.400]  just as former top-secret service agent Dan Bongino was saying yesterday just
[42:19.400 --> 42:23.720]  just he said it's a lawless criminal organized crime behind the scenes he's
[42:23.720 --> 42:27.600]  been there guarding the president overseas all these big global conferences
[42:27.600 --> 42:34.680]  with royalty Rothschild's Rockefellers G20 and he said you know I obviously can't
[42:34.680 --> 42:37.240]  get into all the stuff I know but that's why they're breaking into his house
[42:37.240 --> 42:41.520]  and going after him he's running for Congress because he's seen it folks it
[42:41.520 --> 42:50.520]  is total lawless evil okay and let's go ahead and go to Obama lying through his
[42:50.520 --> 42:56.120]  teeth to the American people saying we don't spy on you I had the programs
[42:56.120 --> 43:00.920]  reviewed we put in some additional safeguards to make sure there's federal
[43:00.920 --> 43:04.760]  court oversight as well as congressional oversight that there is no
[43:04.760 --> 43:10.440]  spying on Americans you know we don't have a domestic spying program well we
[43:10.440 --> 43:16.960]  do have are some mechanisms where we can track a phone number or email address
[43:16.960 --> 43:23.440]  that we know is connected to some sort of terrorist threat and you know that
[43:23.440 --> 43:28.880]  information is useful but you know what I've said before you know I want to make
[43:28.880 --> 43:35.800]  sure I repeat and that is we should be skeptical about the potential encroachments
[43:35.800 --> 43:42.160]  on privacy show that government so so yo I'm gonna protect you I'm your daddy
[43:42.160 --> 43:48.680]  what a quote all these different rap stars come out and say recently that
[43:48.680 --> 43:55.960]  he's our father and we should just do whatever he says man when they start
[43:55.960 --> 44:01.160]  calling somebody the father they called Mal the father they called Hitler the
[44:01.160 --> 44:06.520]  father they called Stalin the father they called Lenin the father they called
[44:06.520 --> 44:14.280]  Pol Pot the father they called Fidel Castro the father they called Julius
[44:14.280 --> 44:21.560]  Caesar the father the papa man I tell you that I mean it is just grade a
[44:21.560 --> 44:27.720]  tyranny a bunch of ego maniac people in black uniforms and suits wearing
[44:27.720 --> 44:32.160]  sunglasses bugging their eyes out at the public just strutting around an armed
[44:32.160 --> 44:38.480]  gang butchering America and I cannot stress this enough what you see
[44:38.480 --> 44:46.440]  happening in this country is 180 degrees the polar opposite of a free
[44:46.440 --> 44:52.240]  society and that is incontrovertible absolute 100% fact and I just sit here
[44:52.240 --> 45:00.200]  like an emergency beacon SOS reactor will self-destruct we are following a
[45:00.200 --> 45:05.480]  tyranny pattern that will lead to total collapse and nightmare scenarios of
[45:05.480 --> 45:12.560]  government anarchy rogue government alert danger danger passing fail-safe
[45:12.560 --> 45:21.680]  point approaching event horizon of no turning back alert alert please move to
[45:21.680 --> 45:25.920]  prepare yourselves with firearms storeable foods friends and family who

[45:31.640 --> 45:38.080]  simultaneously offensively to reverse the criminal bloom the criminal viral

[45:43.040 --> 45:46.800]  all around their pump and adrenaline into the heart I mean we got flatline I'm
[45:46.800 --> 45:50.200]  sitting there going we gotta do something they're coming in I mean look
[45:50.200 --> 45:55.320]  the entire institutions are burning down like Bongino said yesterday I mean
[45:55.320 --> 45:59.360]  it's all going down right now it's burning it's blowing I mean the shields
[45:59.360 --> 46:04.960]  are down we're overrun everything's on fire and then you've got yeah I mean the
[46:04.960 --> 46:08.720]  walls are falling the enemy forces are getting ready to roll in the full
[46:08.720 --> 46:14.560]  operation you think it's bad so far we've just seen the vanguard scouts and
[46:14.560 --> 46:17.760]  then I've got my fellow Americans who were into it believing the propaganda
[46:17.760 --> 46:22.840]  going bring down the wall stop trying to hold it up Alex Jones is bad for saying
[46:22.840 --> 46:27.560]  the NSA shouldn't spy on us they're keeping us safe they're out there trying
[46:27.560 --> 46:31.000]  to get the wall to drop the shield to drop the shields are just going in and
[46:31.000 --> 46:34.680]  out man and they're starting to fall and they're cheering we're gonna get our

[46:38.160 --> 46:43.400]  anything but absolute implosion on record post-industrial society hell on
[46:43.400 --> 46:46.040]  earth and these people are so weak-minded they're gonna love that
[46:46.040 --> 46:50.840]  because all they want to do is imagine that they're winners imagine that they're
[46:50.840 --> 46:54.960]  on a winning team you know we need to put all the gunners in Famicamps for
[46:54.960 --> 46:57.760]  Obama let me sign that thing right now yeah we need to arrest these two part
[46:57.760 --> 47:02.720]  ears buddy don't tell me you know we're gonna take everybody over 70 and
[47:02.720 --> 47:06.240]  euthanize them just before they get sick well yeah I'm almost 70 myself I
[47:06.240 --> 47:10.240]  don't want to be alive anymore and that's a quote from Mark Dice's last
[47:10.240 --> 47:14.560]  video these are real people folks they're like yeah I want to die because they
[47:14.560 --> 47:18.400]  said for Obama it's a trance it's like mind control where they tell the woman
[47:18.400 --> 47:21.720]  who's been you know hypnotized under drugs and stuff take your clothes off you
[47:21.720 --> 47:25.520]  know have sex with me they do it they only remember they did it folks and I'm
[47:25.520 --> 47:29.760]  telling you the public is in a trance it's for Obama we're gonna put people in
[47:29.760 --> 47:32.640]  Famicamps absolutely now you understand we're gonna we're gonna put them in
[47:32.640 --> 47:36.320]  work camps we're gonna take the tea party to you know we're gonna arrest them
[47:36.320 --> 47:40.680]  but you gotta tell me I want to arrest them I mean they're ready folks they're
[47:40.680 --> 47:50.240]  ready to come for us and it is so sick I mean it is like it is if you if the
[47:50.240 --> 47:55.800]  general public knew any basic historical information as in a context if they had
[47:55.800 --> 47:59.840]  any any any upbringing of basic history and common sense people would
[47:59.840 --> 48:06.160]  understand how just sitting here staying in this country and not because all the
[48:06.160 --> 48:09.080]  stuff I've done believe me I'm on the top of the list the fact that I haven't
[48:09.080 --> 48:14.000]  evacuated is is a bold act but I realize there's nowhere to run long term and
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.280]  this is the great historical contest so I'm very honored to be in this position
[48:17.280 --> 48:21.240]  but people need to understand this is the real deal let's play part of Leno's
[48:21.240 --> 48:24.920]  monologue to analyze it here here it is he's getting a little grayer have you
[48:24.920 --> 48:29.240]  noticed that fact there's not a column the silver Fox that's where the problem
[48:29.240 --> 48:33.080]  the silver Fox that's because most of the silver in his hair was caused by Fox
[48:33.080 --> 48:41.880]  that was a problem that's why it's that's why it's silver and President Obama
[48:41.880 --> 48:46.240]  sent John McCain to Cairo to help solve the political problems that brought the
[48:46.240 --> 48:49.480]  Egyptian government to a halt I got an idea how about some of the problems that
[48:49.480 --> 48:57.680]  brought our government to a halt why don't we start with that one first we're
[48:57.680 --> 49:01.600]  meant to be brought down by the way the government's moving forward on many
[49:01.600 --> 49:05.520]  fronts take our liberties we want gridlock under the separation of powers
[49:05.520 --> 49:10.600]  to stop a man on a white horse a Napoleon Bonaparte taking control of our
[49:10.600 --> 49:15.120]  society I want to take calls for the first 30 minutes the next hour and cover
[49:15.120 --> 49:19.800]  news the toll-free number to join us for first-time callers today on this
[49:19.800 --> 49:28.320]  Wednesday edition first-time caller Wednesday 800-259-9231 800-259-9231
[49:28.320 --> 49:33.600]  and we'll also get into Gardasil on record oopsie we didn't knew it sterilized
[49:33.600 --> 49:39.240]  women oh didn't didn't know that be like again shooting an elephant with an
[49:39.240 --> 49:43.200]  elephant gun and going I didn't know it did that yes I should be like jumping
[49:43.200 --> 49:46.880]  off a cliff and you know breaking your legs going I didn't know fallen 200 feet
[49:46.880 --> 49:54.520]  would do that so we're going to be breaking all of that down today as well
[49:54.520 --> 49:59.520]  and we're going to look at the post constitutional America and what that's
[49:59.520 --> 50:05.760]  going to mean for everybody and we're also going to look geopolitically some
[50:05.760 --> 50:09.000]  of the things that are happening but on the NSA front the electronic frontier
[50:09.000 --> 50:13.880]  foundation has looked at the Reuters story and other admissions by Congress
[50:13.880 --> 50:17.960]  that indeed the DEA and NSA team up to share intelligence leading to secret
[50:17.960 --> 50:22.440]  use of surveillance and ordinary investigations yeah I didn't need to
[50:22.440 --> 50:26.120]  know about a year ago when they built a building out in the countryside where I
[50:26.120 --> 50:30.520]  live and put up antennas and NSA-style scramble errors and I saw the type of
[50:30.520 --> 50:34.920]  trucks and vehicles people that were there and then I asked around to local
[50:34.920 --> 50:39.600]  homeowners association they go oh no the yeah they bypassed the local ordinances
[50:39.600 --> 50:43.080]  that's a government front facility and then I went a little bit longer found it

[57:56.400 --> 58:03.080]  media war is we don't have taxpayer money and Pentagon and CIA money like NBC and MSNBC

[58:09.080 --> 58:14.840]  So please click on the sponsors as well at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. And again,
[58:14.840 --> 58:19.200]  if you hear me endorsing a product on air or on the site, that means I use it and I
[58:19.200 --> 58:24.080]  believe in it. They have a lot of other great sponsors too, but that are on the network
[58:24.080 --> 58:29.400]  and also on the site. But if I'm not endorsing it, I can't absolutely vouch for it. And that's
[58:29.400 --> 58:33.520]  just something that I'll always add there, which most advertising outfits that have advertising
[58:33.520 --> 58:38.400]  don't do. All right, second hour massively jam packed with news, your calls and gas.
[58:38.400 --> 58:52.160]  Stay with us. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network. Why does the United States

[59:03.360 --> 59:09.920]  disease? It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition
[59:09.920 --> 59:15.280]  and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled with toxic poisons and
[59:15.280 --> 59:20.960]  big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design. We can turn the tide against the
[59:20.960 --> 59:26.240]  eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs. To learn more,

[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:35.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number two. We're going to have a special report
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:40.680]  with Leigh Ann McAdoo and Gigi Arnetta here in studio with us, contrasting people that
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:45.400]  were out protesting and calling for the impeachment of Obama yesterday, part of a big national
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:52.280]  spontaneous event that we just started on the Internet by spontaneous people just spontaneously
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:57.160]  hear about it and on their own volition go out and do it. So, uncoordinated, I should
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:02.200]  say, and very successful. Thousands out in LA, hundreds out here in Austin, scores of
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:08.960]  different events throughout the day. Looking at these people talking versus the majority
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:13.240]  of Austinites we talked to, if we go to trendy areas, which means mindless TV head idiot
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:18.160]  areas that are living in a fantasy land, if we go to fantasy land areas of Austin, it's
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:24.520]  like LA, they'll call for anything, banning water, arresting all gun owners, and having
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:27.720]  the NSA spy on everyone because they, quote, have nothing to hide. In fact, we're going
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.680]  to play both their reports when they come in, but can we queue up that Miss USA contestant?
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.160]  There was a bunch of them, but the one that said, I want to be followed and track what
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.480]  I do to make sure I'm safe. I mean, we'll play that later. We're going to get to the
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:44.080]  Dr. Khalid Mohammed clip since I mentioned it earlier. I want folks to think I'm making
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.080]  things up.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:50.480]  And then we're going to go to your phone call starting in the next segment, but I was just
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:58.880]  getting into the prosecutor CPS types that are on my YouTube comments with the headline
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:05.040]  Texas town kills two year old because parents smoke pot. And it is the town allowed it.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.680]  The government did it. It was under state care, bash the two year old girl's brains
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:14.280]  out. And you've got people in there. It's a minority, but they're in there viciously
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:20.960]  defending her death. And then you've separately got these black Israelite types in there who
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:26.000]  are saying white people are all devils inherently and need to be, need to be, you know, wiped
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  out. And it's so what she's a white devil. I mean, it is just, it is just shows how all
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.960]  these people are in their own niche. Government dehumanizes a little girl, the white supremacist
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:42.240]  dehumanize a black person that's killed, the black supremacist dehumanize a little white
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:50.160]  girl because people can't handle the pain. I mean, I mean, I get why they do it. It's
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:57.640]  a fool's errand. It's a, it's a cowards avenue. But let's go to Dr. Khalid Mohammed debating
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:02.920]  Anthony J. Helder about killing the blue-eyed devils. Here it is.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:08.280]  I killed the women in South Africa. I said kill the women because the women are the military
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:14.520]  manufacturing center. And every nine months they lay down on their backs and reinforce
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:20.880]  me rolls out from between their legs. So shut down the military manufacturing center by
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:26.560]  killing the white woman. I killed the elder crackers, the old crepit crackers in South
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:31.440]  Africa. How in the hell do you think they got hold? They got held up, pressing and killing
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:37.160]  black people. I said kill a couple, kill a couple, kill a hell of a couple, kill a couple.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.160]  Come on.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.880]  Let's turn it off as he starts getting profane here in a minute. The whole point is, if anybody
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:49.360]  knew the real history of South Africa, it was the Dutch and the British and the French
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:55.080]  all killing each other, constantly getting allied with black tribes. And if you went
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.760]  in one of the wrong areas and were white into a white area, they'd kill you. If you went
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.920]  into one of the wrong black areas, you were black to the wrong tribe, they'd kill you.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.840]  It's tribalism, folks. They act like it only comes from white people. And then you had
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:12.120]  this vestigial leftover of some of the rich white ruling class that had basically apartheid
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.720]  going on, which was a bad system if you have real equality. But the point is, now since
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.280]  they got rid of that South Africa on record has collapsed into mass murder and total bedlam,
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.160]  with the black tribes just killing each other 24-7. You're like, what are you saying, go
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.680]  back to apartheid? No. But you go out of one bad system and it's something even worse,
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:33.840]  run by a bunch of communists. And of course, it was the big diamond companies and the ultra-rich
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.880]  that wanted to be able to go into the Dutch and French areas where whites have gone in
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.520]  and set up their own areas. And they just took all that away and gave it to the big
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:48.440]  companies. And now the blacks have no jobs. I mean, it's on record. So the Rothschilds
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:52.480]  just came in with the beers. They'd already been there forever and just got rid of their
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:05:01.080]  white competition. So hey, there you go. Same deal. Hope you enjoy it. The Blue-Eyed Devils.

[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  Well, all over the country, people are being told at their apartment company. They're
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:45.640]  not allowed to defend yourself. If you defend yourself, you will be thrown out and of course
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.400]  they're violating their rights. They've signed up with under one contract and now they're
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:53.680]  telling them you've got until next week to get out of your apartment if you don't turn
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:09:01.120]  your guns in or get your weapons out of your house and that's a report up on info wars.com
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:08.120]  via news 9 NBC out of Denver, but this is actually going on all over the country. Homeowners
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:14.480]  associations are now retroactively trying to vote that you can't own guns and retroactively
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:21.000]  saying they want to inspect your house. So the new elitism is to be basically an in-between
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.680]  between a Soviet Commissar and a Nazi Gestapo officer. And so now wealthy country clubs
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:32.480]  are hiring cops to wear battle gear and stand around with machine guns in front of the country
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:37.840]  club just randomly. Weddings are doing it. It's like bling. It's like, look, I got cops
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:44.520]  in battle gear. I mean, it's beyond what the hip hop folks do with the ladies and bikinis
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:54.560]  dancing around with the bling. It is just a nation boiling in a fascination with enslavement
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.860]  and insecurity and tyranny in the name of security when it's actually the opposite
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:03.640]  of security and homeland security. Speaking of that, which is the foreign globalist occupation
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:09.520]  group here to absorb America is now putting up billboards and TV ads saying Homeland Security
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:15.520]  has been criticized over sexy spy ads where they show good looking women reporting on
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:23.880]  exclusively white people. It's all minorities reporting on the devil white. So again, they've
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.240]  already said all the brown people are terrorists now. And so now all the white people must
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:34.960]  be terrorists. Jack Spratt could eat no fat. What's the old quote? Jack Spratt could eat
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:38.480]  no fat and his wife could eat no lean. So in between the two of them, they licked the
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:44.000]  platter clean. I mean, basically, that's what they've done here. It's just everybody's
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.440]  a terrorist, but the government that publicly runs Al Qaeda worldwide and puts out fake terror
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:54.960]  alerts and runs drugs on record. Everybody's bad, but the real terrorist. But it's okay
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.960]  because they love us and they want to take good care of us. So we're going to be taking
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.960]  your phone calls and I have my reporters in here. One of them went out yesterday and talked
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:07.280]  to people about being spied on and almost all of them said that they loved it and thought
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:12.120]  it was a great idea to have no rights to be spied on. That was a Lee and Mackenzie report.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:20.360]  And then Gigi Arnetto went out and did a report. Just we heard about the spontaneous people
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:25.120]  over overpasses with American flags against the NSA and calling for the impeachment of
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.480]  Obama and against the move to take our guns. Thousands showed up in LA, hundreds of other
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:34.760]  cities, more than 10 places I know of in Austin in two different demonstrations where you'd
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:41.160]  have 20 people, 10 people still just amazing that that happened spontaneously off the Internet.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.080]  And these people have a lot of liberty in their eyes. They were well spoken just to
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:50.440]  contrast the dead eyes of the zombies, just begging to be enslaved and overrun by every
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:56.740]  form of evil versus those that are out there standing up for these fools rights. Just amazing.
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:03.320]  So let's go to your phone calls though as promised right now. Let's talk to Angelo in
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:13.360]  New York. You're on the air. Welcome. Hey, I'm calling from New York and wow, a lot of
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:18.440]  crazy things are going on in New York, Alex and watching your show on YouTube woke me
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:24.680]  up to a lot of it. And when I tried to explain this to a lot of my friends and family, they're
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:36.160]  just like in La La Land. And I figured out why. I mean, I went to NYC.gov and I realized
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:42.040]  all the sodium fluoride that they're putting in our water. And if you go to their website
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:48.080]  and you look it up, you'll notice how they explained everything to us on how it's supposedly
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:54.280]  supposed to be good for you. But little do they know. They don't show containers of the
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:59.160]  big skulls on the sodium fluoride that they're supposed to be labeling. They don't show that
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:05.040]  on the website. And we're also having a major prescription drug problem in New York. Everybody
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:10.920]  is like in La La Land. And a lot of people I know are dying from prescription drugs.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:17.080]  I've been through a few funerals in the past few years. It's a huge police state. They're
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:23.080]  pulling over everybody, especially near midtown Manhattan. It's just like I feel like I'm
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:31.240]  going through Germany in the late 30s, searching through my stuff, stopping my bike, shutting
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:39.800]  my bike, putting gloves on, about to hit me, police. It's just horrible what's going on.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:45.800]  And a lot of people aren't aware about what's going on. I would say more people that are
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:51.080]  aware of it are the people who have access to the Internet. So a lot of older people
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:55.080]  don't have access to the Internet. And they don't know what's really going on because
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:01.360]  they're watching Fox and CNN. But I have experienced so many different crazy things that are going
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:08.200]  on in New York right now. And I think that info wars should be on every newsstand in
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:14.920]  New York. Every newsstand info wars should be there. Whatever we have to do, Alex, to
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.080]  get it out there, we have to do it.
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:21.120]  Well, that's why I put out the magazine and have a plan to try to syndicate it. I just
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:25.720]  don't have the money, the infrastructure, or the managerial talent to properly do it.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:29.000]  But we've got a pretty good team overall. We're trying to do it. We just are doing so
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.040]  many things, you know, developing the TV show with all these stations already lined up to
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:40.600]  pick it up, trying to finish the Obama deception to do in the Daily Show, dealing with the
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:47.800]  collapse of just general society and people's mental health just around us. All of us are
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.520]  fighting as hard as we can, brother, and God bless you. And I appreciate you calling. Good
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.600]  to hear from you, Angela.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:15:02.520]  Since you mentioned the fluoride in the water, they knew in the 1800s they had studies on
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:07.480]  what fluoride that got into water supplies was doing, that it was brain damaging people
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:11.160]  and also making them docile. And then they got University of Texas studies from the
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:15.440]  20s, you can pull up that it lowered IQ, maybe it will docile. The Soviets starting in the
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:19.240]  20s, sort of putting it in the water and work camps, and that's in Pulitzer Prize-winning
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:23.480]  books, you can look it up. The Hitler got that from them. He put it in his work camps,
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:28.120]  not his death camps, in his work camps. They put, what was it, three parts per million
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:34.560]  in it. But that made them too sluggish, so they went down to 1.6. We have the Nazi model
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:40.800]  of it putting our water on record. And the average person just can't deal with that.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.320]  So then last year, a Harvard study comes out, looking at 24 studies, including some of their
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:51.640]  own over the last several decades, and said, wow, it lowers women's IQ, 17 points. If you're
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:57.880]  just drink this water for 10 years as a child, and it lowers men, I think it was 23 points,
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:05.040]  if I just say 20 points, that averages together. And massive cancer increases. I mean, look
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:08.360]  at the public. Look at us all. We're all ugly compared to our grandparents and parents.
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:13.280]  I mean, my dad looked like a movie star. My mom looked like a movie star. I mean, I look
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.440]  pretty good, a little bit older, but I look ragged and drugged out and ugly and old, even
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:22.000]  though I try to eat non-GMO and all the rest of it. I mean, we're walking dead, folks.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.480]  And I mean, look at my grandparents. They look like movie stars. They look at old photos.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:31.000]  And you just average people, just looks really healthy. They ate like pigs. They smoked cigarettes.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  They drank like fish. You know, most people, and they look great. You go look at the French,
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.920]  you don't eat GMO. I mean, they smoke two, three packs of cigarettes, drink constantly.
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:43.300]  You have hundreds of sexual partners. They live on average. It's like almost a decade
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:49.520]  longer than Americans. We are being murdered, folks. We are the model, okay? Everybody needs
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:59.680]  to understand that. And this is the type of society we're in. The rats they feed GMO
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:04.000]  in every case within three generations are almost completely sterile, deformed with
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.960]  tumors all over them. And it doesn't matter what GMO they feed rats, it doesn't because
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:14.240]  it's designed, folks. We're only a generation into this and people are dying all over the
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:20.120]  place. And so that's what's so frustrating and it's what's so stupid about, you know,
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.800]  you run into feds or something with sunglasses on and trench coats, bugging their eyes at
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.920]  it. You're like, you're supposed to be scared of an airpiece and them acting, it's like,
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:32.800]  get your walking dead, bro. You're in the same club as I'm in, walking dead. I mean,
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.320]  you're under a total scientific attack and you're playing along, you know, in dress up
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:41.680]  here. You're like, you're protecting us from some terror threat when it's publicly run
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:48.760]  by your bosses. So that's why, I mean, I'm not even worried, folks. It's like, there's
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:55.360]  a reactor leak, we got to fix it, or all of us are dead basically as a society. I'll use
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:01.680]  the Star Trek analogy for people that can't get a historical comparison. The reactors
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:08.360]  leaking, the enterprise isn't going to escape condetonating the weapon system and somebody's
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:12.160]  got to go in there and fix it or nobody's going to make it. I mean, this is guaranteed
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.040]  pure evil. If you don't believe in Satan, I don't know what planet you're living on,
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:21.920]  folks, because this is a pure diabolical total evil program run out of Europe and the United
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:27.360]  States. America and Europe aren't doing it. We were the most powerful host to have the
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:35.280]  organism grow in it. And so it's 100% fact that the city of Austin, where I no longer
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:42.280]  live, our offices are here, puts weaponized levels of fluoride in the water, one part,
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:47.560]  1.6 parts per million, even though the government under law suits when their own scientists
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:52.960]  rebelled, near unanimously, thousands of their toxicologists and scientists last year, sent
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:56.680]  a letter saying you got to take it out, cancer, death, you got to get the fluoride out, the
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:01.720]  feds went, okay, we'll recommend if cities want they can cut to 0.7 part per million
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:08.880]  or cut it in half, basically. None of them did it. They know full well, they told them
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:12.160]  seven years ago, don't give babies fluoride water, but you see ads everywhere, for your
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:18.200]  baby needs fluoride, folks, they know exactly what they're doing, okay? They are murdering
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:22.240]  you and your family, and they think it's funny, and they think it's cute, and they think
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:25.400]  it's fun. And if you go to the Austin City Council or any other city council, they'll
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:34.680]  sick, they're like fat, degenerate, murderous pigs, and put a chemical weapon in the water,
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.600]  and they all drink filtered water and they all eat non-GMO, they know what they're doing,
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.960]  they're part of the club, folks, they've been brought into the club, they know, you just
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:45.040]  understand that. That's why they laugh even when we bring scientists, Harvard and other
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:20:01.960]  scientists there to tell them they laugh because they know, they're like, hahahaha, no, hahahaha.

[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:10.080]  gold and precious metal investing firms. I get it. You wouldn't buy gold if you believed
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:14.120]  that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:18.400]  of dollars like bailout candy, that social security would be there for you. That's not
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:23.920]  what's happening. You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation,
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:28.000]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure. If all
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.120]  looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold. For the realists, there have
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:37.680]  never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold. Since 2001, the US dollar index
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:43.480]  has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%. Right now, savvy investors are adding gold
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:47.600]  to their portfolios. You should, too. Find out what they know. Call us and I'll send
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:23:00.400]  you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free. 800-686-2237. 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:04.320]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:09.200]  is over. But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again,
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:13.600]  the economy has not recovered. What is the smartest investment you can make? It's food.

[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:22.520]  All right, I got to stop ranting and go to your phone calls. It's just that Bertrand
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:28.400]  Russell, Aldous Huxley, Julian Huxley, the head of the U.N. program at UNESCO, Secretary
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:35.440]  General UNESCO, the current White House science are John P. Holdren. I mean, I've read hundreds
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:40.720]  of quotes and statements by these people in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s,
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:46.440]  right through to now saying, yeah, we're going to put stuff in vaccines to make people
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:52.920]  more pliable and we're going to put things in the water supply so that they're not as
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:25:02.360]  fertile so they don't live as long into long-age, late-age where they deplete the social network.
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:06.160]  And that's why you get so-called liberals on the news going, yeah, let's kill grandma.
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.280]  Let's not give her all the treatment we've paid into. That's the collectivism. You get
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:15.760]  the young self-centered authoritarian liberal. He's not even a liberal. And they're like,
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.640]  yeah, let's kill all people. I want, I want what they get as if the globalists are going
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:26.200]  to give you anything you moron. You're just in the domestication phase before slaughter's
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:32.320]  stupid. These are organized criminals who know what they're doing. And now the word's
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:37.520]  gone down even to the city levels I've confirmed with a lot of their operatives, mayors and
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:42.280]  others who have actually been brought in on the plan and are going along with it. And
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:46.480]  the rationale is we're doing it for the earth. We're going to reduce population. The human
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:52.920]  group is a disease. We've got to get it under control as Prince Philip and as Prince Charles
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:58.120]  have both said publicly. Don't believe me? Just type in Prince Charles says we should
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:05.480]  reduce population with a bio weapon or Prince Charles. And so they're just stunning us right
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:11.680]  now. Kind of like you humanely electrocute. You know, now they send high voltage into
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:16.200]  a sheep's brain to knock it out before they butcher them over under EU rules. You can pull
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:19.960]  up those videos of them doing that. Don't pull it up for viewers, but people can see
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:23.240]  it if they want to see it. And that's kind of what's happening now. We're being humanely
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:30.560]  stunned in their own words ahead of the bio weapon being released.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:36.680]  Let's go to Rob, Rob in Pennsylvania. You're on the year. Go ahead. Then we'll go to a
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:42.520]  beam and others. Go ahead. Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Yes, sir. I'm a first
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:46.480]  time caller. I've been listening for about a year now and I want to thank you for waking
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:54.600]  me up about this would have been in 2002 early 2003. I was working as a paramedic firefighter
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:59.840]  in Baltimore and we took a gentleman to the hospital who was quite obvious. He was either
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:05.320]  FBI or CIA. There's a lot of the complexes down there around Baltimore airport. He was
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:11.640]  dying. He is having a heart attack and you could tell the look of death was in his eyes.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:16.120]  And he told me he'd done terrible things. He said people who were innocent have died
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:21.720]  because of things he did. I shocked him. I brought him back to life and he said he saw
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:27.320]  terrible things and he said that he was afraid that it's too late. This is back then. I think
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:33.320]  perhaps we've slowed things down, but I'm calling to urge firefighters in Los Angeles
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:38.600]  police, police department in Los Angeles, all these people who know something need to
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:44.080]  come forward so we can stop this. Specifically, what was he saying? They were going to plan
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:50.680]  some big stage terror attack? He didn't go into specifics, but at the time, just this
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:56.040]  was status post the whole anthrax type deal. I think that's what he was kind of hinting
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:59.720]  at, but he would not go into specifics. Well, who knows? They might have poisoned him. He
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:03.120]  might have been dying. He might have known that too. Yeah, but those guys always when
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:07.280]  they get ready to die, they start begging Jesus, especially when they've been shocked
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:11.960]  back to life because a lot of times they see some really bad stuff if they've flown into
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:17.960]  the bad side of the universe. And is that what you saw in his eyes when you brought
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:23.800]  him back to life? He'd gone to the bad place? Amazing thing with heart attacks. When people
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:29.840]  die, when their heart dies, their mind does not. I've, numerous people I've shocked back
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:34.600]  to life told me that they could feel the whole thing happening. They could hear me, they
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:39.800]  could hear the chaos, and they could feel that power. And I'm not a religious person,
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:45.800]  but that in itself has always made me think that perhaps there is something else. Sure.
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:50.120]  Well, the scientists try to make it up and say, Oh, well, it must just be some ancestral
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:54.720]  programming or memory, but it's more every culture has the same experience. Bad people
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:58.600]  go to hell with all these other horrible people. You're basically with all their spirits.
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:02.840]  That's what hell is, is being with all the other bad people like yourself, or they go
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:09.120]  in and it's just white thrown the absolute peace and timelessness. And then I've talked
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:13.400]  to so many people, soldiers, police, you name it, who are particularly good. The whole
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:17.840]  deal, the angels, there they go, you're being sent back. They're given the data download.
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:22.040]  It's incredible. It's so real. And I've had my own private experiences. I won't talk about
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:25.240]  on air because they'd make an issue out of it in the news. But let me tell you, folks,
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:28.920]  it's real. There is a heaven. There is a hell. There are demons that are angels. It's all
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:32.240]  real. And I just really feel sorry for people that have served evil because they're going
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:38.960]  to go to hell. And anything else you want to answer? Yeah, I do stay there. I'm going
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:42.160]  to come back to you. We're going to get our reporters in here and have them do a report.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:50.760]  I'm going to get all the other callers that are there as well. Stay with us. We're on

[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:29.840]  Colonel Craig Roberts, a good friend of mine, I've known him for about 16 years, was in
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:34.440]  Vietnam as a Marine Corps sniper, then he was in the Army, then he was a police department
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:41.160]  helicopter pilot, SWAT team leader, and he died for 10 minutes and had the whole experience
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:46.680]  where he went up to heaven. The angel that had been there his whole life with it, they
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:50.840]  never seen, but as an imaginary friend when he was a kid, that feeling of somebody's watching
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:54.920]  him was right there. He was given all this information sent back. People laugh at that
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:59.040]  whether, whether you believe that's real or not, that's the deeper human psyche. That's
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:03.440]  what's going on. And we were talking to a paramedic, Rob, who I'm going to let finish
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:08.640]  you up and then we're going to go to this very important report with our two reporters
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:13.400]  here in studio to finish the other point you were trying to make. But first off, so you're
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:16.840]  shocking back to life. He says, I've done horrible things. Horrible things are going
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.720]  to happen. I guess he was mentioning something about anthrax attacks or whatever, and that
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:26.040]  he'd done bad things. And then I guess innocent people been killed. And we know that was a
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:30.880]  federal operation. It's now come out. They even killed a Patsy over it. But, and that's
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:33.800]  a whole other subject for folks that want to look into it. But that was going to get
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:39.400]  the Patriot Act passed. But did he say anything else before he finally died again? And were
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:45.240]  you unable to shock him alive again? No, actually, we got him back and he was he was doing fine.
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:49.200]  I went and spoke to him in his hospital room later that day. Okay, so he didn't die. You're
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:53.920]  seeing a death on him and you he brought him back. Okay. Yeah, we had death on his face.
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:59.200]  We brought him back. He was touching go there for a while. I believe if I remember correctly,
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:05.320]  they either did angio or one of the procedures that they did back then. But no, he he survived
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:11.440]  and I tell you, I hold hope that he remembered that experience and he did something to change
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:18.200]  the wrongs that he did. What specifically did he say about about I did horrible things?
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:21.960]  I mean, it's not like you were warning that he was saying there might be a terror attack
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:26.320]  that they were behind it. I mean, what was he getting at specifically? It wasn't any
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:31.360]  of the specific things that he said. It was just when you back then I wasn't as weak as
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:39.160]  I am now. So it's you see people like this, they're dying. They they have guilt. But you're
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:44.880]  there to treat the patient and you know, and not psyche. So if you kind of try to comfort
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.160]  the patient, yeah, it's gonna be okay. I'm gonna do, you know, I've done training and
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:52.000]  had to do this. I can I can do it. I just need you to calm down, relax. We're going to go
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.240]  through this step by step and I'm gonna let me help you get better. But as far as going
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:04.160]  to anything further, I wasn't awake at the time. Our department was pretty busy with
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:11.200]  with the anthrax scares, but something something in my mind connected to to absolutely. What
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:17.560]  was the other point you wanted to make? Let's roll 2013 a peaceful rally. It's gonna be held
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:22.640]  nationwide and locally throughout the United States to try to bring back the Constitution.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:27.280]  I was just trying to get a plug so we can get our numbers up and I saw the the overpasses
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:32.400]  for Obama and that's great too. But I think this fall is the chance we have to save this
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.960]  country. I agree with you and it's good to hear from you. I appreciate you calling into
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:43.920]  the broadcast. Now, shifting gears, this dovetails with what the caller was just talking about.
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.400]  One of my reporters yesterday was out and saw people doing overpass banner hangs, return
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:54.880]  the Constitution, come and take it, defend the Second Amendment, impeach Obama for NSA
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:58.520]  spying or store the Fourth Amendment. And it turned out these were all over town and
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:03.640]  at the Capitol, 10, 20, 30 people depending on which spontaneous event it was. And by
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:08.760]  spontaneous people just heard the call on Facebook all over the country. There were thousands
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:13.160]  in LA, hundreds and other cities, but thousands at one spot in Los Angeles. There's gonna
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:19.160]  be more in the next few days. And I was watching the nightly news last night from home, a
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:25.960]  rebroadcast of it, because it was re-streaming. And I saw Gigi Arnett's report, we're gonna
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:32.080]  get to secondarily, where the people were so electric, so alive, why they were out there,
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:36.000]  why they just heard the call to go and stand for the Bill of Rights and Constitution, America's
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:46.320]  in trouble. And then I watched the next piece where Leanne McAdu went out and the majority
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:53.480]  of people she talked to in Austin said, I wanna be spot on, I wanna have my rights taken.
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:38:01.640]  So first we're going to get to Leanne McAdu's report and then compare that to the type of
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:05.360]  people that want freedom. And if you're a radio listener, you can hear how pathetic
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:10.080]  these people are, it's very sad. But to see them, to see the weakness in their eyes and
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.880]  that they're scared and they go, oh, I like being spied on, they know full well this is
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:20.200]  tyranny. But they just think they're gonna appease it. Well, when Liberty fails, the
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:24.800]  best men rot in filthy jails and those that cry to appease appease are hung by those they
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:31.200]  tried to please to quote an old Revolutionary War statement said by an unknown person. Let's
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:33.240]  go ahead and go to this first report.
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:38.920]  Surprise, surprise, it turns out the NSA has been using your information for a lot more
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:43.760]  than just fighting international terrorism. Has your wife ever cooked anything in a pressure
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:44.760]  cooker?
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:45.760]  Yes.
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:46.760]  Yes.
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:47.760]  Yes.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:56.840]  Um, I personally have not, but like I said, my mom is really into pressure cooker recipes.
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:57.840]  Is she a terrorist?
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:58.840]  No.
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:38:59.840]  No?
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:00.840]  Are you sure?
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:05.920]  Yeah. No, very, very much not a terrorist.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:11.200]  At one time, the wife had looked up pressure cooker recipes and at another time, her husband
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:16.280]  was looking up backpacks. They came to their house. The federal agents came to their house
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:20.640]  and started asking them a bunch of questions about being terrorists. Do you feel comfortable
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:25.280]  with the fact that your Google searches are being used in this way?
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:29.040]  Sure. I have nothing to hide. They can question me all they want.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:36.040]  I'm sure it's an effort to keep us all safe and hopefully that was cleared up pretty easily
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:37.920]  with a few good answers.
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:44.920]  If you don't have anything to hide, then you shouldn't be scared of anything.
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:49.880]  I don't, I don't know provocative search anyway, so.
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:55.360]  How do you feel about the NSA logging all your Google searches and sometimes supplying
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:56.960]  that to local police?
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:57.960]  Good.
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:02.760]  You're good. You feel good about that? You don't think that that's entrapment?
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.800]  It's bad.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:08.320]  Have you been drinking today?
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.320]  No.
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:14.720]  So you're, you're comfortable with the NSA collecting your innocuous Google searches?
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:15.720]  I am.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:20.520]  Everyone's okay with it. They're like, I like being spied on. It is cool.
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:23.280]  Honestly, we need to be safe.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.880]  For the Info Wars Nightly News, I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:30.840]  We need to be safe. Were they safe in Nazi Germany? Were they safe in Soviet Russia?
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:35.680]  No. Are they using this data for corporate fraud? Are they using it to be able to calm
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:41.480]  the people? Are they using it to be able to gouge folks and manipulate the market?
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:42.480]  Absolutely.
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:46.320]  We're not safe because we have a tyrannical government. Historically, that's the most
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:47.320]  dangerous thing.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:55.400]  Now, contrast that with Gigi's report here, where she went out to the spontaneous rallies
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:41:00.040]  to impeach Obama that happened nationwide, here in Austin and the people she talked to.
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.200]  Here's that report.
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:06.560]  I'm Gigi Urnetta reporting for infowars.com and Info Wars Nightly News, and we're standing
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:12.720]  here on an overpass at Maynard Drive in Austin, Texas, where people are honking for Obama's
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:13.880]  impeachment.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:15.760]  So what gave you guys this idea?
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:21.280]  This is a national movement. We started by James Neighbors, who's up in Oklahoma. We
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:26.920]  now have, we've got groups like this in all 50 states. And yeah, we're just out here trying
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:32.640]  to raise people's awareness a little bit and get them woken up to what's going on with
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:36.120]  the Obama administration and try to get them out of office.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:39.920]  So you believe that these are definitely not phony scandals?
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:45.400]  Definitely not. They're felonies, you know? And we elect these folks to govern us, but
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:50.920]  not to rule us. And we have a constitution to limit the federal government's power,
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:54.320]  and they're just shredding the constitution daily.
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:59.240]  I want to know how many people are out there that would like to be doing something. They
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:03.800]  get frustrated. They say, well, I'm going to do something tomorrow, and I'm going to
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:09.200]  do something today, something that's going to count. You know, you got to get out of
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:13.680]  the, from behind the computer and go out and try to get some things done.
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:17.920]  We're in a neighborhood where people actually told us, oh no, you don't want to go out there.
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:22.760]  There are too many people for Obama out there, but we're getting a great response, and we're
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.560]  going to stay out here as long as we can.
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:28.400]  I'm going to be out here every chance I get. I took off work for this today. I mean, I'd
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:33.440]  take off work if I was sick, or if I had a sick child. The Republic's sick. It needs
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.480]  help. That's what I'm here for.
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:43.400]  One group near Los Angeles has 1,780 people. 1,780 people. That's incredible. One group.
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:47.000]  And if you go to overpasses.org, you can find out more information about the event they're
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.800]  having August 17th. Get out and help, help change what's happening to our Constitution.
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.320]  I'm Gigi Renetta reporting for infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:02.320]  All right, that's Gigi Renetta. Good job there. Look, everywhere on the sitcoms, the dramas,
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:09.000]  Miss USA, you name it, they are pushing that we're safe if we're spied on. And here's a
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:14.440]  clip from Miss USA pageant this year. This is just one of them. And they told them to
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:18.080]  win. You go out and say you want to be spied on. Remember a few years ago, a lady said
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:22.480]  she wanted liberty and didn't want the Patriot Act? And so they said, oh, she lost. She was
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:27.480]  she was run her up because she said she wanted freedom. That's why they all say I want you
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:34.680]  in. I love the government. I want world government. I want it's an agenda they're pushing. Okay,
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:38.800]  so listen to this mindlessness right here.
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:44.640]  The tracking of phone records has been in the news lately. Is this an invasion of privacy
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:50.200]  or necessary to keep our country safe? Why or why not? Miss Alabama. I think the society
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:54.600]  that we live in today, it's sad that if we go to the movies or to the airport or even
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:59.440]  to the mall that we have to worry about our safety. So I would rather someone track my
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:06.320]  telephone messages and feel safe wherever I go, then feel like they're encroaching on
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:12.520]  my privacy. And again, thank you. She doesn't want to believe that the government could
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:15.960]  be criminal interest that took over. She doesn't want to believe that run al-Qaeda when it's
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:21.880]  on record. I mean, I had Obama's senior former head of a foreign operation for the Secret
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:25.240]  Service with thousands of people under him on air saying, yeah, the president's involved
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:28.880]  with al-Qaeda. Yeah, it's staged. I think these are fake terror alerts. He even said
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:34.040]  more off air because it's the truth. Ladies and gentlemen, here's the final clip I want
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:39.840]  to play. Here's Chris Rock. The same attitude. Obama is our daddy. And you do what your
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:44.760]  daddy says. Here it is. So, you know, the president and the first lady are kind of
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:51.080]  like the mom and the dad of the country. She's my mama, too. When your dad says so, you listen.
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:58.560]  Then when you don't, it usually bites you in the ass later on. So I'm here to support
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:03.840]  the president. Thank you. You know, it's funny. And they all look pleased when he says that,
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:10.080]  he's spoken like a good cult follower. My dad is named David R. Jones. And his father
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:17.600]  was named Jerry R. Jones. And then he had a dad named Dad Ross was the nickname. I don't
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:21.320]  even know my great grandfather's name. I should know that on a Southern family. I know it's
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:30.000]  Dad Ross. I mean, I didn't know Obama. I thought my mother was Carol Jones. I didn't know that
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:35.520]  my mother was Michelle Obama. But I guess I go to restaurants down. There's little cards
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:40.160]  about she's telling me what to eat. My kids were going to private school. And it was curriculum
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:45.280]  from her as well because it was accredited. I mean, so I guess they're full-time home
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:51.080]  school now. You just can't get away from our mama and our daddy. Let's go to our reporters
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:55.280]  here. Liam McAdoo, your report first. And we're going to play a few that disagreed tonight.
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:00.040]  They were the vast minority. I'm told what out of 10 people you talked to two said, no,
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:05.120]  we have rights. I mean, my God, these people don't they understand that North Korea is
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:10.520]  like this? Exactly. I was shocked. They were literally zombies out there. And they were
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:15.040]  like, we got to be safe. We need to be safe. And I said, well, don't you feel like that's
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:18.760]  an invasion of your privacy? Don't you feel like that's entrapment? Well, we got to be
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:25.240]  safe. And Obama himself said, you know, you're not you're not going to get hit by a terrorist
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:30.400]  more than a car accident. But we don't have a domestic spying program. You know, and that's
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:34.760]  what they don't miss Alabama's like, it's so dangerous. Now, what honey bees that kill
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:38.960]  200 and something people, terrorists less than a hundred. What is so dangerous with guns,
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:44.640]  gun crimes down 61%. Oh, it's so no, they create the perception like a child thinking
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:49.000]  a bookie man's under the table because the babysitter shows him Halloween. It ain't real
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.480]  folks. The threats, the government. Exactly. And I asked the older gentleman who said,
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:57.280]  you know, his wife cooks with pressure cooker all the time. And I said, well, you'd be okay
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:01.760]  if they came and kicked down your door like they did with this family. Yes. He said, well,
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:05.160]  you know, I'm sure we could get it all solved with a, you know, just by answering a few
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:10.920]  of their questions. Yeah, let them come in with a SWAT team. Yeah. GG. Contrasting that
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:15.480]  with the great people you saw out there in the 106 degree heat, one guy for 17 hours
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:19.760]  who had a medical condition. I'm told sheep will come out. That's what it was like. It
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:24.680]  was amazing. People came out and as I was leaving, people were actually showing up that
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:29.280]  you knew just by, you could tell they were like, well, should I be out here? And they,
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:33.360]  but they came out anyway. And we were up on an overpass where you had to go quite a ways
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:37.720]  up as a pedestrian overpass to get there. And you could just see the intensity and the
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:42.240]  people that I interviewed were so passionate about being there and they were encouraging
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:45.800]  and telling people, you know, it's just not about. They're alive. Yeah, they're alive.
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:50.200]  It made me more alive. It was 104 and I came in and I was ready to do it again. And that's
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:54.920]  what they were saying. They said 106 yesterday. Yeah, it was hot and Wendy, but it was great
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:58.160]  because as we were doing the interview and there's more to it where we were standing
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:01.640]  there, people were honking their horns. People were driving by and honking in the middle
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:05.520]  of the interviews. They were just, you know, they had signs that said, impeach Obama, get
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:09.680]  your, and I'm not going to say the word, but it had donkey out of the White House. You
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:13.880]  know, don't spy on me. They had all these signs all down the, the overpass all the way
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:18.080]  across the overpass. It was pretty intense. It was pretty intense.
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:24.080]  Well, just the contrast between the two people. Oh yeah. I mean, that's what I wanted to get
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:27.280]  you guys into today is it was the contrast on the nightly news of these two different
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:31.840]  groups of people. And then you see them, the folks out in California, when Mark dies, we've
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:35.600]  also been out there to interview people. If you say for Obama, we're going to put everybody
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:40.040]  that owns guns in a concentration camp for Obama. We're going to kill Jews for Obama.
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:43.960]  They'll, they'll say anything. It was for Obama. What do you that? I mean, that's like
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:49.440]  mind control. Well, absolutely. And the weird thing is I've been out to some of these zombies
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:53.720]  before on other reports and it really, it makes me nervous because it's like they're
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:58.400]  in a trance on some kind of medication. They're not all there. And then when I went out to
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:02.080]  this, I didn't know what to expect. The people were alive. It made me excited. They were
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:05.760]  like, we need to defend the constitution. We're standing up and they had, I don't know
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:10.200]  if you saw, but they had arm bands and without, you know, looking at it, you think, well,
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:14.520]  hmm, could, you know, remind me of something weird. So I asked, but it was for SEAL team
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:18.680]  six that they were wearing arm bands because I felt like, oh, it's good to bring that out
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:21.880]  that they clearly killed them. Yeah. And they want to stay. What do the SEALs think? They're
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:25.320]  not going to be sent on a fake bin Laden raid, not be killed. They're going to get rid of
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:29.120]  you. Right. You can't be part of this and not be killed, but that's part of the phony
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:35.000]  scandal. You know, that's what Obama. Oh, Jay Carney said so. Who's a known admitted liar?
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.760]  Well, that's why they're so scared of, of the people that are awake and alive and who
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:43.880]  are trying to rally together and make some changes. They want to, they, they like the
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:47.160]  zombies. Well, I've thrown a lot of points out here. Great job on the reports and with
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:50.280]  the nightly news crew. There's going to be more tonight, but I want to send you guys
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:55.920]  back out, both of you now and Jacari and everybody else out there to then challenge them. I'm
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:58.800]  going to write some questions up and then say, so you support what they did in Soviet
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:03.760]  Russia, Nazi Germany. Why was it different there? Okay. Well, this is illegal. Obama
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:08.520]  says they're not doing it, but they are and really challenge them. I want to just say,
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:12.400]  what's wrong with you for these people? Ask them to bring the truth, the truth.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:17.640]  Cause I mean, I, I mean, I would ask them, why do you seem so glazied? Okay. You know,
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:21.520]  sadly do that. Now, now, now the one older guy, you could tell he was scared. Just wanting
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:26.000]  to comply. Like I'll do whatever you say. You know, I think, uh, you know, the, uh,
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.160]  fur is good. I mean, I mean, it's basically that attitude of I'll do whatever I'm told.
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:34.120]  Just leave me alone. Right. Kick my door down. Don't they get the tyrants want to dominate
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:39.240]  you and take your wealth? The fact that you lay down to them, that's what makes them run
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:43.920]  over you. Well, they don't understand that, but they are going to do this again on the
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:48.560]  17th of August, all across the United States. So if they go to overpasses.org, they can
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:51.560]  find out more about, yeah, we should get the director of that on. And we should launch
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:56.080]  things like this as well. I mean, this is what it's all about. And, and, and will this
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:01.760]  one operation save us? No, but everything together, the resistance will, can you go

[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:30.080]  I take the shots and have a convulsion. I give my child a shot. They never talk again.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:41.840]  Thank you, New World Order. Thank you for the gifts. You are my cupcake. Obama, I love
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:50.840]  you. You're so trendy. I like it when you bomb third world countries.
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:56.840]  Oh, man.
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:03.840]  Nobody was really sure he was on the house of law.
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:16.840]  It's a pretty song. The English Army.
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:32.840]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen. That's right. I just had to look. I couldn't turn
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:33.840]  it off.
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:40.840]  Thanks for joining us. Ladies and gentlemen, Adon Salazar is about to break some big news.
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:46.840]  He's gone to the courthouse, gotten the affidavits, court records. You know that little girl,
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:50.840]  Alexandria Hill, who got her brains bashed out a few months after she was taken because
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:54.840]  the father got ratted out for smoking marijuana late at night while watching movies with his
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:57.840]  wife? Of course you got to take a child for that.
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:04.840]  Turns out the foster parents, the male foster parent, the woman who's been arrested for
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:12.840]  reportedly bashing the brains out, a little two-year-old, Alexandria, turns out he has
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:18.840]  multiple convictions for being a drug dealer. So if you smoke a joint watching a movie,
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:22.840]  we're going to take your kids and give them to people that look like trolls and a little
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:26.840]  girl's going to get beat up and have black eyes and her hair falling out and the state's
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:30.840]  going to not help them. They know what they're doing. And then when they kill her, well,
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:35.840]  that's just somebody else to throw in the prison, but they're going to hand your kids
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:45.840]  over to people with drug convictions, drug dealing convictions. Not one, but two. And
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:51.840]  of course all the prosecutors and bad cops that are on the YouTube video defending it,
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:56.840]  two people are sick. And I'm going to just give you some bad news, okay? Bad news for
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:57:01.840]  you. All this evil is going to come back on you. And I've had bad cops who are going,
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:06.840]  what is that? A threat? And I go, no, dummy. If you had any spirit, you'd know that when
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:10.840]  you do bad stuff, man, you're not God-fearing. It's not that I even want to do bad things,
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:15.840]  but I just think about bad things just to analyze them. And I just think about how bad
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:20.840]  that is and how I don't want to be part of that. It's called God-fearing. And you people
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:24.840]  don't have any bearing. You don't have any mooring, any rudder, any compass, any North
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:31.840]  Star. You do not have any conscience. And you just think whatever's good for you must be
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:35.840]  good for everybody. So if you want to steal from people or you want to cheat and you want
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:41.840]  to rationalize, that's okay. And it goes for the general public as well. I mean, this
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:46.840]  television is nothing but a demonic society now. I'm going to come back, go to calls.
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:50.840]  And the G. Edward Griffin is going to be on. Ed Evad wants to get his country back. Anthony
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:54.840]  wants to talk about Soviet fluoride. Brad wants to talk about Christians. Darrell wants
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:58.840]  to talk about Talkers magazine. Comey wants to talk about solutions. I'll get to a bunch
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:01.840]  of you. Some of you will be talking about G. Edward Griffin. So stay there. I want to
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:06.840]  get to everybody that I just mentioned and more. Briefly, you can get all the great

[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:58.840]  pre-selected for us? As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand
[01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:04.840]  the potential of information. Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly
[01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:11.840]  looking at how to tap into your psyche. From compulsory state education to the Hollywood
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:16.840]  media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:21.840]  our actions. When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:25.840]  and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness. All of this is happening
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:30.840]  so fast, you need to be ahead of the game. How to engineer the opinion of the American
[01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:35.840]  people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:14.840]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:24.840]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:31.840]  All right, folks. We're into hour number three. Jeb DeGriven is coming up. We'll continue
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:36.840]  with your phone calls. Brad in Michigan, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Welcome.
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:43.840]  Hello, Alex. Are you there? Yes, sir. Hey, buddy. I got a few things on I talked to you about.
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:48.840]  First of all, I'm a first-time caller. I've been listening to you for about a year and a half now.
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:56.840]  Hey, but I need some advice from you, Alex. Go ahead. You always say on how our government
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:02.840]  ships in all these drugs. And these drugs, I live in Detroit, just south of Detroit in
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:08.840]  the suburbs. And I mean, they're everywhere. I mean, Alex, it's so bad. You walk into these
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:14.840]  gas stations and pay for your gas. And they got these glass cabinets right next to the
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:21.840]  cash register with crack pipes in them. You know, heroin needles, cocaine grinders, anything
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:28.840]  you need to abuse these drugs. My brother put a shot down in his mouth about 15 years ago
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:35.840]  due to cocaine. I got a 21-year-old stepson right now that's so addicted to heroin, Alex.
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:42.840]  It makes me want to cry, man. I mean, it's horrible. He's died three times. He can go out, Alex.
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:48.840]  He can go outside. He'll be broke and grab my lawnmower and run down the street and cut
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:54.840]  a lawn for 15 bucks and run down the other end of the street and get heroin. And I come home.
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:58.840]  I know. And our troops publicly grow it. And they have congressional hearings admitting
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:03.840]  most of the drugs are brought in by our government. Everybody else has to pay 7% to 15%. That is
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:09.840]  so well known that even in the movie Two Guns, you have to pay the CIA 7% to bring cocaine
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:16.840]  in. I mean, it's just publicly known and it's a tax on everybody. And it's destroying our
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:22.840]  society. And then they use it to destroy our bill of rights. And it's just totally evil.
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:27.840]  And you've got to start young with kids explaining drugs are dirty. They're bad. They're stupid.
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:31.840]  They're not sexy like the media says, like the hip hop rappers and rock and roll people
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:38.840]  say. You've got to keep them away from it. And then all that money from all the stolen
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:44.840]  goods and the yards they mow doesn't go to the big banks. And the big banks all publicly
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:49.840]  launder the drugs, run the drug aircraft, ship the guns. The aircraft then run the kidnap
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:56.840]  people as well. That's come out. The Wells Fargo, Wacovia Plains, the rendition flights.
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:02.840]  I mean, it's just the only reason this has happened is the public is so naive, so childlike.
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:08.840]  No idea that we have absolute demons running the country. It's bigger than Obama. He's
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:12.840]  just meant to make it trendy to get everybody to go along with the next phase, the full
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:17.840]  collapse of the country. And I'm so, so sorry to hear about what's happening. I mean, you
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:25.840]  want advice? You know, I don't know what to say. Look, they put fluoride in the water
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:30.840]  to brain damage the kids and destroy your fertility, guard a cell on record reduces
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:34.840]  your fertility, sterilizes a lot of people. We knew that. That was in the trials. Now
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:39.840]  it's confirmed their new study. I mean, they're killing us. They're kidding. They enjoy it.
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:44.840]  They make money while they murder us. Imagine wanting to brain damage children. Imagine
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:48.840]  wanting to take 20, 30 years off their life. Imagine wanting to make them where they can't
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:54.840]  have kids. Of course, they ship drugs into your town. I mean, the cops are so corrupt
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:58.840]  in Detroit now they're running around robbing everybody publicly. And I mean, this is the
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:03.840]  future for all of America. I mean, we are in judgment because you know, who's going to
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:07.840]  save the 53 million of babies that have been aborted? The people that lie to themselves
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:11.840]  and say it's not a human. Well, then you're not a human. I'm not a human either. You see,
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:16.840]  I mean, the globalists only think they're human and all of us are basically a sandwich
[02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:21.840]  on the table to be eaten. Well, I'm not their food, but we have to stop acting like sheep
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:26.840]  and start acting like men, brother. What was your, what advice did you want?
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:32.840]  I'm in the trenches out here. I'm a truck driver. And they, you're talking about control.
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:37.840]  They got this qualcomm and these trucks, they tell us when to eat, when to drive, when to sleep.
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:40.840]  I know. And soon they'll get rid of you with robots. Absolutely.
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:47.840]  Oh my God. And every week I work like, I work like 70 hours a week and I make like $1,200
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:52.840]  a week and they take $350 of that. And the cops pull you over, giving you tickets for
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:58.840]  no reason, bankrupting you, correct? I correct. I am barely surviving. Everything you say is true.
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:01.840]  Hold on. I'm going to come back to you in a moment.

[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:30.840]  We're all riders on the storm.
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:35.840]  Into this world we're thrown, folks.
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:39.840]  Into this world we're born.
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:47.840]  You know, there's a killer on the road.
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:55.840]  And if you give this man a ride, we will surely die.
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:09:02.840]  Well, we've given tyranny a ride. It's actually driving the car now.
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:07.840]  And a lot of you are under Stockholm syndrome. You're going to think of you appease the killer.
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:14.840]  He's going to be nice to you. No, he's going to take you to a basement and torture you for a very long time politically, physically.
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:18.840]  Because when you let the bad people get control, what do you expect is going to happen?
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:20.840]  They're always there. They always crave control.
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:24.840]  I wanted to finish up with a truck driver caller who wanted to ask me some advice.
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:28.840]  We're going to, we're getting on the line right now, an amazing guest, G. Edward Griffin.
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:34.840]  And I want to get his current prognosis on the Republic and all the revelations that really confirm everything we've said.
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:42.840]  And where he sees things going in the future, best-selling author of The Creature Room, Jack O'Liland, Exposing the Federal Reserve, and of course, realityzone.com.
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:47.840]  But real quick, Brad, you had a question. You said they're pushing you to limit 70 hours a week.
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:51.840]  Satellite trackers telling you when to eat, when to sleep, harassing you.
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:56.840]  Police checkpoints everywhere. One piece of dust on your back bumpers and a lot of truck drivers.
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:03.840]  Giant tickets you've got to pay. Everything designed. Trucks out of Mexico driving down the wages.
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:11.840]  And then now they're moving to Google Trucks. Within about five years, most truck drivers will either not be on the road or you'll be in a attendant for the computer,
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:16.840]  helping just be a backup for it. And this is the total control grid.
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:19.840]  The robots are replacing everybody at the slave factories at Foxcom.
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:24.840]  And the globalists say that the robots are the answer to their mathematical question.
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:27.840]  They've never wanted the labor of the serfs. Serfs have always been cheap.
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:30.840]  Now we're like trash. Has to be taken to the dump.
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:39.840]  But first, you've got to be made totally dependent by being leveraged down by globalism and the rise of automation and the shutdown of any real economy.
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:41.840]  So what was your question, sir?
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:51.840]  Yes, sir. Alex, my advice I'm asking you is this. How do I handle all this? I mean, they got me and my whole family, everybody except me works for minimum wage.
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:56.840]  They can't get a good job. I mean, we're housed in here like a bunch of hermits, man.
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:03.840]  And we're barely, they all make minimum wage except me, my stepson, my stepdaughter, my wife, my stepson.
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:08.840]  Well, you're at a survival point. The government's not the government anymore. If I was you, I would stop paying taxes.
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:10.840]  I mean, I'm not telling you what to do. This is what I would do.
[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:17.840]  If I wasn't running a big operation, you know, full front in the enemy's face, I wouldn't be paying taxes to the offshore Federal Reserve.
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:19.840]  I wouldn't be complying with anything.
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:29.840]  Now it is treason against humanity to comply with this alien, evil, murderous, scientific, technocratic, foreign banking cartel that's occupied the country.
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:33.840]  I mean, that isn't rhetoric. That's what we're under. And you've got a job to survive.
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:42.840]  And so I do just like the illegal aliens. I would, I mean, they go and let them get all the free welfare and health care and all that.
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:46.840]  That's done as a supplement so they can work for low wages and drive down wages. They're just being used as well.
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:51.840]  So, I mean, I wouldn't probably go do that, but survival, survival, it's all fiat to begin with.
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:58.840]  I'll ask Geobert Griffin what you should do, but I know people are collapsing everywhere and they want to collapse you.
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:04.840]  There's 101 million people now on food assistance. It's set to go to 140 million by the end of this year.
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:09.840]  I have an article on that today. This is a military technocratic takeover.
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:14.840]  And so just, you know, get your heart right with God, which sounds like you've done. That's what most important.
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:19.840]  Let your family understand this is a scientific attack and you can organize and rally together.
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:25.840]  Start planting more gardens, stops. I'm sure you'd already don't do this, but don't support the big corporate system.
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:28.840]  Tell everybody, hey, we've got to gear up and get two jobs.
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:33.840]  Now all of us at minimum wage, try to put stuff back for the real depression that's coming.
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:40.840]  And then, I know Michigan's been targeted for collapse. You know, you may have to evacuate that area at some point.
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:42.840]  God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:44.840]  Geobert Griffin, what a way to start the interview with you.
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:49.840]  And I wanted to take calls when you're on and just get into the general news and your take on the world.
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:53.840]  You're a best-selling writer, documentary film producer, and many successful titles to your credit.
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:58.840]  Listed Who's Who in America. He's well known because of his unique talent for researching different topics.
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:04.840]  He, of course, has exposed the collectivist conspiracy, why the megabanks finance him.
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:12.840]  He's also had national TV shows in the past as well. I won't go into his whole bio, but realityzone.com.
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:17.840]  You just heard that person and, you know, most of the family I know is working two jobs,
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:20.840]  even though they've got college degrees or army veterans, you name it.
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:24.840]  And they're working minimum wage, two jobs. Can't even barely have the gas to get to work.
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:29.840]  Where does this all end? I guess we're seeing the fruits of globalism, the fruits of the New World Order.
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:33.840]  And Obama promises a life raft of more of the same.
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:40.840]  Alex, those are all the big questions, aren't they? Where does it all end and what do you do about it?
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:47.840]  And those two questions are really tied together because what you do about it may affect how it all ends.
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:51.840]  I guess the most important thing is what do you do about it right now?
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:57.840]  Your friend on the line there, your truck driver guy, and my neighbors and people I talk to all the time.
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:05.840]  I think the answer depends to a large extent on who they are, what their talents are, what their age is, what their characters are like.
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:11.840]  But in general, in general, it all adds up to one thing. You use the word before, resistance.
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:17.840]  And then we have to go further than resistance. We have to become assertive.
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:24.840]  We have to follow the analogy I made in my presentation when I launched Freedom Force International.
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:31.840]  I posed the problem of, here we are on board a ship, this great luxury liner, and we're all having a good time.
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:37.840]  And we find out that the ship has been captured. The captain of the ship has been thrown overboard.
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:41.840]  And all of the crew members have either been killed or put into the brig.
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:46.840]  And now all the pirates are walking around wearing the uniform of the captain and the crew.
[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:54.840]  And the passengers on the ship have no idea that their ship of state, so to speak, has been captured by pirates.
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:15:01.840]  And the question I posed is, now we know we happen to see it all happen, and we try to tell our other passengers on board the ship.
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:08.840]  We said, did you know that the captain really isn't the captain? It's a pirate and all this, and they look at us like we're crazy.
[02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:12.840]  And they say, get out of here. Look, the ship is still going along fine. We're having good meals.
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:16.840]  The music is playing and all that sort of thing. So the question arises, what do you do?
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:22.840]  And I go through a whole litany of things. Well, you can try and escape. You can try and hide.
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:30.840]  You can try and sign a petition, pass a petition around the crew, and write letters to the captain and say, won't you please stop being a pirate and so forth.
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:39.840]  I go through all of these idiotic things that people do in modern society trying to overcome the fact that our ship has been captured by pirates.
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:48.840]  And finally, ticking them all off, none of them will work except one. And there's only one. And that is to recapture the ship.
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:54.840]  And once you get that clearly in mind, then the answer to the question, what do you do, becomes fairly clear.
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:16:02.840]  Everything you can do aimed in the direction of recapturing control of the system and getting these pirates out of the wheelhouse.
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:09.840]  Exactly. But first, you've got to let the general public know these are pirates in the captain's uniform.
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:18.840]  Absolutely. Yeah, because you can't do this alone. And that's the point. You need lots of help and you need an organized effort and you need coordinated effort and you need smarts.
[02:16:18.840 --> 02:16:21.840]  You need strategy and tactics and you need all kinds of things.
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:26.840]  And not to debate the pirates. They've learned to play this game of going, we're not pirates. We're not pirates.
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:31.840]  When everything they're doing is piratical, they're caught lying on every front.
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:37.840]  And now we're starving in our state rooms. The power's off everywhere but up on their party deck.
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:41.840]  Now they're dragging our wives off to have sex with them. Now they're throwing people overboard.
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:45.840]  Now they're disappearing people on the ship that said, hey, they're pirates.
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:48.840]  And now people know they're pirates more and more.
[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:55.840]  More and more they still do but there are a lot of them that don't. And the ones that do know still are in kind of a state of apathy.
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:58.840]  They don't know what to do. Or they're scared of the pirates.
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:05.840]  And they don't have any inkling of what to do about it. And they keep thinking, well, I'm only one person. What can one person do? And that's the core.
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:10.840]  We've got to get organized. We've got to get together. We've got to stop bickering with each other.
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:13.840]  Look at what you've done in 45 years. Look at what I've done in 18.
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:19.840]  When we have reached tens of millions of people apiece, other folks need to understand that you're powerful as well.
[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:22.840]  Engage the enemy. How do we do that?
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:28.840]  Well, everybody has their own talents, don't they? I happened to find out some years ago by accident that I was able to write.
[02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:32.840]  I never thought I could write but I had to because I was very ill at one time.
[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:37.840]  And some publishers said, well, why don't you write this book on a topic you'd been speaking about in the United Nations?
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:42.840]  And I said, well, I can't write. And then I thought, well, wait a minute. I'm ill. I can hardly get out of bed.
[02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:46.840]  Writing is the only book. The only thing I could do. So I said, oh, no problem.
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:52.840]  Well, I discovered, fortunately, that I could do that. So that's my thing.
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:59.840]  Your thing is broadcasting, communicating, motivating people, raising the rabble, so to speak.
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:04.840]  Boy, that's an essential part of it and communicating very important information along the way.
[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:11.840]  Other people are more quiet in their approach. Some people work quietly within their church groups and with the PTA and so forth.
[02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:16.840]  Everybody has their thing, maybe just within your family and your circle of friends.
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:23.840]  But whatever it is, figure it out quickly and do it. Get your information and start passing this information through.
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:27.840]  Don't be afraid of being rejected by it. I mean, that's the thing that scares most people.
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:30.840]  They're all wilting flowers. It reminds me of the old days.
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:36.840]  On radio, they had a show. It was the bashful salesman. And it was a comedy routine.
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:40.840]  And you would always hear it. He was afraid. He was a salesman, but he was afraid of rejection.
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:44.840]  So the scene was, he had a little knock, knock, knock, knock. Nobody home. I hope, I hope, I hope.
[02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:45.840]  You know, this is how we are.
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:47.840]  I've seen that. Yeah, it's funny.
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:57.840]  Yeah, it is funny. But we still had that build into it. So we got to get rid of that because rejection, that's nothing compared to what lies ahead if we don't take the ship back.
[02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:04.840]  I absolutely agree with you. We're going to break here in a moment. I want to come back and talk about the obvious mega-exceleration.
[02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:11.840]  Is that being done from a position of strength or weakness by the enemy who I think you agree with me is about 10 years behind?
[02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:21.840]  And how serious is it going to get now that they've decided to just remove any pretense of the fact that they're democratic or constitutional and what type of things they may pull?
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:31.840]  I mean, the incredible transparency of the NSA issue. Congress is about to do something because of uproar and then they have fake terror alerts.
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:37.840]  All of it with G. Edward Griffin, realityzone.com, Freedom Force International.
[02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:44.840]  We'll talk with him about the NSA scandal, Snowden, 2014, such a key election coming up.
[02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:50.840]  This is it, folks. This is it. We do have real pirates. Well, pirates are nice compared to these people.
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:20:00.840]  We have control freak social engineer mega-criminals at war with humanity who hijacked the ship. It's us or them, make no mistake.
[02:20:00.840 --> 02:20:11.840]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.

[02:22:47.840 --> 02:23:06.840]  Hello this is Ty Bollinger author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box. I want you to know some very important information.
[02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:18.840]  In 1985 President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:32.840]  Now 27 years later Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:40.840]  If you want to stay healthy now is your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:55.840]  Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com. That's 1-866-836-8735 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.
[02:23:55.840 --> 02:24:10.840]  Protect your immune system. It's the only one you've got.
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:26.840]  Here's some of the news up on infowars.com where to play this later in the hour. Rand Paul slams MPR host. Don't you have something better to do than a bunch of crap? It's time to just get in their face and just stop letting them all set the parameters of society.
[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:36.840]  And then scrolling down TSA now expanding its invasion of train terminals, sporting events, music festivals and rodeos. You're not going anywhere without the government putting their hands on you.
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:46.840]  They're here to break you. You're a prisoner. Apartment complex, bands, weapons and firearms. No self-defense allowed. Criminals obviously are going to enjoy attacking.
[02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:59.840]  U.S. Air Force transports 24 tons of cocaine to Miami. And the media spins it like, oh, we found the cocaine. Somebody blew the whistle. Just the naivete of the public.
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:10.840]  But it's okay because there's a terror alert. They're going to keep us safe. Going back to G. Edward Griffin. What's going to happen in the paradox and what do we do from your research perspective?
[02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:16.840]  That you've got more and more people waking up that we're in deep trouble and we've got a really nasty version of tyranny.
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:25.840]  And then you've got others that are embracing it and absolutely feel like they're part of the power structure now even though it abuses them.
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:34.840]  I mean, this is biblical level what I'm seeing happen. The quickening of mental illness in the general public versus the quickening of awakening.
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:39.840]  I mean, I'm really seeing some science fiction type stuff going on right now.
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:49.840]  It's true. It has all the stuff of a very dramatic story. A fiction writer couldn't have created anything more dramatic than the rising tide.
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:58.840]  You would call it tides on both sides. As you said just a moment ago, the public is awakening. There's more awareness and it's becoming exponential.
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:04.840]  You think, my gosh, we're going to win because the public is beginning to understand.
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:10.840]  But by the same token, the opposition, the totalitarian forces are also rising like a tide.
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:16.840]  And one by one, the last few barriers against their unrestrained actions have been removed.
[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:25.840]  And so they're moving faster and faster. I think about the only thing that restrains them is their lack of ability to administer this plan.
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:32.840]  It's like Obamacare. They've got this beautiful thing in their mind. It's a beautiful thing. It's a horrible thing, of course, but they don't know how to administer yet.
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:36.840]  They haven't got it all tied together. So I think that's really what's going on.
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:43.840]  Well, exactly. The Nazis were very well ordered and followed orders well and had a large work ethic, unfortunately.
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:49.840]  But one good news about the globalist is their minions are so incredibly stupid that it's very hard for them to carry things out.
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:52.840]  It's our compliance that empowers it.
[02:26:52.840 --> 02:27:01.840]  Well, there's no question about our compliance and our lack of resistance. Also, there's a midpoint there where between we don't comply but we don't resist either.
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:09.840]  We don't know what to do. We're just sort of paralyzed like that little mouse that's been hypnotized by the snake or bitten with a little bit of venom and he's paralyzed.
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:15.840]  No, he just sits there and shakes and thinks, oh my gosh, that snake's going to eat me. Sure enough, snake eats him because he doesn't run away.
[02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:23.840]  So, yeah. The point, though, is that both of these forces I see are rising very rapidly and exponentially right now.
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:32.840]  And I can't imagine that this can go on much longer, certainly not even another generation, I don't think, before it comes to a head.
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:42.840]  And we'll know, we'll know because we'll be living in the final resolve of this conflict. Hopefully, hopefully, guys like you and me do our job.
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:51.840]  Our side, the forces of freedom and awareness will rise faster than the forces of tyranny. It's going to be a close call no matter how you call it.
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:55.840]  But they're sure, as they say, these are exciting times to live in.
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:28:03.840]  As Ron Paul said yesterday, they're in a race to get their technocracy in because we're using the Internet to really kick their butt right now in their own words.
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:13.840]  And speaking of that, I am seeing a lot of people in the system now really realize that, oh my gosh, that we are a corrupt fraud.
[02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:24.840]  What do they do? Not just a truck driver who's barely making it. What about people that work for the government? They don't like it, but they know that that's, at least on the surface, the only job they've got.
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:34.840]  Well, we know what they do because we have the examples in other societies, other systems where the totalitarian structure has collapsed.
[02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:48.840]  Like, for example, in Germany, there were millions of people that were involved in employed by and obedient to the Nazi regime because that was what they had to do if they wanted to stay out of the concentration camps.
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:54.840]  And also, if they wanted to provide for their families, they were employed by it. It gave them status. It gave them sustenance.
[02:28:54.840 --> 02:29:07.840]  But after the war, I mean, there were almost all of them said, well, we hated it. We didn't know what to do, but we felt like we were helpless to get out of it because we ourselves then would become the victim of it.
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:13.840]  Oh, I've interviewed Hitler youth and people who hated it and their families said, you've got to do it or they'll kill us.
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:22.840]  That's it, exactly. And so I'm sure that that's the case right now. There are people, well, I know there are because I've talked to some of them and say, well, here's some information, but don't use my name, you know?
[02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:29.840]  I'll give you the information. I'd like to help you, but don't use my name because I'll lose my job or something like that. So that's what's going on, I think.
[02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:38.840]  Stay there because I want to talk about this when we come back. When everybody sells out everything collapses, folks, we're going to lose everything anyways because we've been compliant with this.
[02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:46.840]  I mean, you notice I'm getting, quote, more radical because I realize the time is running out. We got to up our game and get hardcore fast. We'll be right back.
[02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:14.840]  Hi, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered. What is the smartest investment you can make? It's food.

[02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:27.840]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:34.840]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:37.840]  All of this is happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:44.840]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[02:32:44.840 --> 02:32:47.840]  Out of another one, another plane to set.
[02:33:14.840 --> 02:33:19.840]  It's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:52.840]  But Rand Paul slams MPR host, don't you have something better to do than a bunch of crap, trying to say that Rand Paul is racist.
[02:33:52.840 --> 02:34:04.840]  And the Democrats got caught during the senatorial election a few years ago on record dressing up in hay seat outfits and going out with racist signs saying they worked for Rand Paul.
[02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:14.840]  They did the same thing down at the Trayvon Martin situation. Foundation funded grips, we did articles with their names in Houston.
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:19.840]  These people are cold-blooded race-baiters, folks, because they don't want to have real-issue discussions.
[02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:27.840]  They want to get us all divided and conquered. Let's play a clip of Rand Paul fighting back. Absolutely.
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:34.840]  I mean, it's time to say shut up when these people go, how dare you try to change the subject. You're the one pushing race stuff.
[02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:37.840]  Because again, it's not just you hate somebody because they look different.
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:45.840]  It's the people that are running race stuff or the real racist because they're using it as a game. They think you're stupid.
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:51.840]  And I'm sick of seeing everybody buy into this stuff. I never liked con artists. Let's go to this clip.
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:35:00.840]  Let me read you something that the economist, the political magazine, the British magazine, wrote a few weeks ago and gets you to react to it.
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:12.840]  Said, the only notable libertarian-leaning politicians to generate real excitement among conservative voters have risen to prominence through alliances with racist and nativist movements.
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:25.840]  Don't you have anything better to read than a bunch of crap from people who don't like me? I mean, that won't make for much of an interview if I have to sit through, you know, reading after recitation of people calling me a racist.
[02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:26.840]  No, no, I understand.
[02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:35.840]  I don't accept all of that. And I don't really need to spend the time going and talking about that. If you want to talk about issues and what I stand for, I'm happy to.
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:41.840]  But I'm not going to really go through an interview reciting and responding to every yehu in the world who wants to throw up a car.
[02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:43.840]  That's enough.
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:56.840]  Absolutely, folks. And this is what they do. Because, ladies and gentlemen, they don't want us to come together. All they want to do is see us fighting with each other and killing one another.
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:05.840]  And I'm sick of it. What do you make of the Republican and Democratic establishment unifying against Rand Paul and Ted Cruz?
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:15.840]  I mean, I don't know Ted Cruz well. I know Rand Paul very well. I know he's for real. I mean, that's got to really concern them that he's pretty much the frontrunner for the Republicans.
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:23.840]  But again, I see that as a positive thing that the only person people can get excited about is a constitutionalist.
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:25.840]  G. Evergryff and what's your take on that?
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:27.840]  Oh, that's a question to me. I'm sorry.
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:42.840]  Well, I think you've said it so well. It's a very positive sign. In fact, I had a little tater tater yesterday afternoon with Gary Arnold, who's, you know, running Libertarian candidate for governor and hopefully president somewhere down the line.
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:46.840]  And we got into that very topic and I said, what is it that excites people?
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:51.840]  He says, well, the only thing that excites people are the things that the Republican party doesn't want to touch.
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:57.840]  He said that they're tired of that same old pablum and the myth of a two-party system.
[02:36:57.840 --> 02:37:02.840]  He said the things we talk about, the really hardcore issues are the only things that get people excited.
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:07.840]  And he said if the media would let that through, why he said there'd be no question.
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:15.840]  He said Libertarians or whatever they call themselves, conservatives, but you know what we're talking about, people that really respect the principles of the Constitution.
[02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:19.840]  He said that they would be in control, but the media blocks it out.
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:23.840]  So I think Rand Paul was right on when he refused to give credence to all of that stuff.
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:33.840]  He knows what it is. Your movie Mind Control explains it very well by even not making the label of racism stick on somebody,
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:41.840]  but just putting it out there and dangling in front of somebody is enough for the average viewer on television to say,
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:44.840]  didn't I hear something about racism and Rand Paul?
[02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:49.840]  Yeah, just exactly. It smokescreens, it changes the subject. Since you mentioned that, let's put a plug in.
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:52.840]  I'm in it, you're in it, I'm distributing it, but I didn't make it, it's excellent.
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:57.840]  And that of course is the new film by the makers of a noble line, State of Mind on Blu-ray and DVD.
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:00.840]  You get free citizen rule books and bumper stickers with it.
[02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:04.840]  Great way to get your friends and family aware of the fact that their minds are being manipulated.
[02:38:04.840 --> 02:38:09.840]  Colonel Schaffer's in it. A bunch of psychiatrists and psychologists and researchers.
[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:14.840]  It's really well done. And that's why I've gotten behind the film. It's available at infowarstore.com
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:18.840]  or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:24.840]  Then you also support independent filmmaking or go to gcnlive.com and they sell it pretty much at cost.
[02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:31.840]  Get a copy of Creature from Jekyll Island, written by G. Edward Griffin, to wake them up about the Federal Reserve.
[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:34.840]  You may already know all about it. The point is, wake somebody up.
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:39.840]  I mean, look, I'd say there's probably what, 50, 60 million libertarian patriots or more in this country.
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:42.840]  Very conservatively. More like 100 million that are somewhat awake.
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:48.840]  If we'd all just wake up a couple people and then get those people to do a little something to expose the system,
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:51.840]  G. Edward Griffin wouldn't that begin to really shake it to its foundations?
[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:55.840]  Oh, it's already happening, isn't it? But yes, it just needs to be continued.
[02:38:55.840 --> 02:38:59.840]  It needs to be amplified. It would shake the system to the foundation.
[02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:05.840]  There's no doubt about it. That's the one thing they fear is that critical mass should be reached.
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:10.840]  And by critical mass, it's not just numbers. It's not just a certain mathematical formula.
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:16.840]  But in this case, a critical mass could be reached by as few as maybe 15% of the population
[02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:21.840]  if that 15% was active, if they were really out doing something about it.
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:24.840]  Now, if they're all just a bunch of riders in the boat and not pullers at the oars,
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:32.840]  well, then it might take 60 or 70%, you know? So our goal is to get that 15% or whatever it is,
[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:35.840]  that critical mass out there and shaking the system right to its roots.
[02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:38.840]  That's right, folks. And don't expect victory overnight.
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:41.840]  The media tries to go, oh, your group's defeated. Oh, really?
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:45.840]  We beat them on their fear-mongering to get our guns.
[02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:48.840]  We've been beating them on so many other big subjects.
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:51.840]  They're UN gun treaties. They're open borders.
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:55.840]  We've been beating them on so many fronts. We're beating them on Obamacare,
[02:39:55.840 --> 02:40:00.840]  as we learned that the establishments exempt as usual from all of this.
[02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:05.840]  We just have to intensify, and we will defeat them because, folks, here's the deal.
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:07.840]  If they win, they want to fully collectivize.
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:13.840]  You're the expert making films even 40 years ago that aired nationally and movie theaters and things
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:17.840]  about the collectivists and how the ultra-rich fund it, the monopoly men.
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:22.840]  Explain to people what we face if the collectivists are able to take over.
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:26.840]  They're clearly trying to break America and Europe right now,
[02:40:26.840 --> 02:40:28.840]  collectivize us, make us dependent.
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:31.840]  So even though we're waking people up, they're still shutting the country down.
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:33.840]  What does collectivization mean?
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:36.840]  What does it mean to let these people run things?
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:39.840]  Because they're already on the news saying your kids aren't yours.
[02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:42.840]  They're already, they're really coming out in the open now.
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:48.840]  That's a topic I would rather not discuss, but you've asked the question, so I have to do it.
[02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:52.840]  The reason I would rather not discuss it is because it gets to be very scary.
[02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:57.840]  We know what they will do because we know what they have done in the past.
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:04.840]  Collectivism is just the generic term for communism, fascism, Nazism.
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:09.840]  If you want to know what they will do, see what they have done when they have come to power.
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:13.840]  And all you need to do is just see what Stalin did and the number of people who were eliminated,
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:16.840]  murdered, imprisoned, tortured, put into slave labor camps.
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:20.840]  See what Mao Tse-Tung did, see what Castro did.
[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:22.840]  Just look and see what Hitler did.
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:24.840]  And you know what will happen.
[02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:28.840]  Now, it happened in a very sequential manner.
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:33.840]  I had an opportunity years ago to interview a fellow by the name of Yuri Besmianov,
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:36.840]  who was a Soviet defector.
[02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:41.840]  He was a very high-ranking officer in the KGB, and he defected to the West,
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:44.840]  and I had a chance to meet him, and I put him on camera, interviewed him,
[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:47.840]  and we talked about this very topic, and he said,
[02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:50.840]  when we come to power, when he's talking about we,
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:53.840]  he meant his former affiliation with the Communist Empire.
[02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:59.840]  He said, the first people we pick up and eliminate were the intellectuals who supported us.
[02:41:59.840 --> 02:42:00.840]  I said, what?
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:02.840]  He said, yes, of course, think it through.
[02:42:02.840 --> 02:42:06.840]  He said, think it through, these are the people who were fooled.
[02:42:06.840 --> 02:42:08.840]  They were the smart people, but we fooled them,
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:11.840]  and once they realized that they were fooled and cheated,
[02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:14.840]  they're going to be mad, and they're going to turn against us,
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:17.840]  and they will be dangerous, so we must get rid of them first.
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:20.840]  Oh my gosh, that makes a lot of sense, and then when you look at history,
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:24.840]  you see that is exactly what happened every time collectivism comes to power.
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:27.840]  And of course, they round up everybody that they think is going to be
[02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:30.840]  potential opposition and get them out of the way.
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:32.840]  Folks, you're not going to like it. You've got to stop it.
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:36.840]  You can't wait until afterwards and say, well, how do we rebuild the system?
[02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:38.840]  You've got to stop the collapse of the system.
[02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:44.840]  That's why I said earlier, we must recapture control of the ship before it hits the rocks.
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:45.840]  There's no choice.
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:50.840]  And when you really listen to almost all of Obama's czars, they go, we love Mao.
[02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:52.840]  We're going to have reeducation camps.
[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:55.840]  We're going to put libertarians and conservatives in them,
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:43:00.840]  and they're not playing games and they fantasize about their militias they're going to have
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:02.840]  and how they're going to come get us.
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:04.840]  And I mean, I got news for them.
[02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:07.840]  I'm not like you looking for a fight because I've never been in one.
[02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:10.840]  I've been in a couple, and I'm not looking for trouble, but listen,
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:12.840]  I'm not going to any camp. My kids aren't.
[02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:17.840]  But all the so-called intellectuals, as you just talked about,
[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:21.840]  that historically will buy into this because they're invited to the table.
[02:43:21.840 --> 02:43:25.840]  They feel special. They feel like, since they've been brought into the system,
[02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:26.840]  they're going to support it.
[02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:29.840]  Don't they have any idea what door they're opening?
[02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:34.840]  Well, no, they don't at the time because they're so imbued with this utopian concept,
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:40.840]  you know, the end justifies the means and everybody will live happily and share equally
[02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:46.840]  and there will be no wars and be full employment and no poverty and no injustice and all that stuff.
[02:43:46.840 --> 02:43:47.840]  They fall for it.
[02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:50.840]  They really believe it, and so they work hard for it.
[02:43:50.840 --> 02:43:55.840]  And then they learn it's just guys in black uniforms raping their wife and kicking their eyeballs out.
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:59.840]  And then they say, ah, guess we made a mistake. That's what happens.
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:02.840]  But too late, you're now in a forced labor camp.
[02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:03.840]  That's right.
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:05.840]  So we've got to stop that from happening.
[02:44:05.840 --> 02:44:09.840]  That's the focus, I think, is not, we know how bad it's going to be.
[02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:12.840]  It's just intolerable. You can't even think about it.
[02:44:12.840 --> 02:44:14.840]  Anything would be better than that.
[02:44:14.840 --> 02:44:17.840]  And by the way, with Homeland Security and the bullets and the armored vehicles
[02:44:17.840 --> 02:44:22.840]  saying the patriots of the enemy, they're gearing up and trying to get cops to go along with them.
[02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:26.840]  And you see articles out of like Colorado where just a few months ago they called in the state police,
[02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:29.840]  the senior ones, 200 of them, and told them.
[02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:34.840]  They said, well, the Christians are the enemy and are you prepared to confiscate their guns?
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:36.840]  And the state police caught them and said, is this a joke?
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:40.840]  But they were there marking down who was going to go along with it.
[02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:45.840]  Right. And those that didn't go along with it are on a list already.
[02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:46.840]  Yep, that's the way it works.
[02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:48.840]  My God, I mean, they're really planning to do this.
[02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:49.840]  Gee, Edward.
[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:51.840]  They are. They are. They are. There's no question.
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:54.840]  Well, we've known that for, what, 50 years.
[02:44:54.840 --> 02:44:57.840]  Yeah, but now, exactly. But now, you know, it's kind of like your dad says,
[02:44:57.840 --> 02:44:59.840]  don't play with the life cycle. You'll shock yourself.
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:02.840]  You finally stick the knife in there and you get shocked.
[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:06.840]  You go, oh, now I get it. I mean, we're now at the edge of the precipice.
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:08.840]  And for a lot of people, they've already been shoved into it.
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:10.840]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:45:10.840 --> 02:45:16.840]  And people are already captured economically, intellectually.
[02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:17.840]  They're afraid to speak out.
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:20.840]  As we talked about earlier, they don't want to speak.
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:23.840]  I'll give you a little example. Right after the Hungarian Revolution,
[02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:26.840]  there was a wave of Hungarian freedom fighters that came out.
[02:45:26.840 --> 02:45:30.840]  And I happened to meet one of them, Steve Szabo, was his name.
[02:45:30.840 --> 02:45:32.840]  And he was one of the real genuine freedom fighters.
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:34.840]  He was out there in the streets with his rifle
[02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:36.840]  and he was fighting against the Soviet tanks.
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:40.840]  And he, finding when the revolt turned around and they had to flee for their lives,
[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:42.840]  he came to the U.S. and I talked to him.
[02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:48.840]  And I said, what was life like before the revolution or the revolt?
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:51.840]  And he told me, you know, how much it was under control,
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:54.840]  very much like in America today. People hated it.
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:57.840]  They were afraid of it, but they were afraid to speak up.
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:02.840]  He says, you know, he said, we had freedoms on paper,
[02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:04.840]  but we didn't dare exercise them.
[02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:06.840]  He said, for example, there were churches.
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:10.840]  There were churches and we had the freedom to go to a church if we wanted to.
[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:16.840]  But we didn't go because we knew if we went, he said, we would be recorded.
[02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:20.840]  Our names would be recorded and then our food allotment would come down.
[02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:24.840]  Or maybe our job, we'd be reassigned to a less desirable job with lower pay.
[02:46:24.840 --> 02:46:26.840]  That's right. You got to play ball.
[02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:29.840]  Play ball. He said, so we never did those things.
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:32.840]  He said, now I come to America and I see the same thing here.
[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:34.840]  This was what, 20, 30 years ago.
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:36.840]  And he said, now I see people there.
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:40.840]  Well, I'm afraid to speak up because I might get fired.
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:43.840]  Well, for anybody that, and that's slavery, that's pathetic.
[02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:49.840]  And you see a film like the lives of others that's based on a true story where,
[02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:54.840]  where, you know, the, the arts boss in Eastern Germany over the, you know,
[02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:58.840]  goes to all the beautiful starlet and says, you're going to have sex with me.
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:03.840]  If you want to, you know, be on the stage.
[02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:05.840]  And that's what it's really like.
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:09.840]  You know, my mom, you know, has friends that were in Eastern Europe.
[02:47:09.840 --> 02:47:11.840]  I've talked to that saw the stuff.
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:16.840]  My wife has a friend whose, whose, whose dad was a famous,
[02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:19.840]  somewhat famous artist in, in Czechoslovakia under the Soviets.
[02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:21.840]  And then, of course, he lives here now.
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:25.840]  But I've heard the stories about how he was just a, you know, regional artist.
[02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:29.840]  Then somewhat successful, these people would come on power trips and judge his art
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:33.840]  that wasn't even political and tell him, do this, paint this on here.
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:34.840]  And I'll let you show it.
[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:38.840]  And it was all about them having the power to tell you what to do.
[02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:43.840]  These authoritarian systems are all about the worship of the priest of power
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:45.840]  that O'Brien talks about in 1984.
[02:47:45.840 --> 02:47:48.840]  It's all about a power trip for scum.
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:50.840]  I mean, it's pathetic.
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:54.840]  She won't get any argument from me on that.
[02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:58.840]  The only extra twist to that is that some of these people, not all,
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:01.840]  but some of them actually don't think of themselves as scum.
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:03.840]  They think of themselves as intellectuals.
[02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:05.840]  They think of themselves as the wise ones.
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:06.840]  Oh, no, no, no, exactly.
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:08.840]  You've got to worship them.
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:12.840]  Yeah, because, because everyone else is too dumb and they need their input.
[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:13.840]  They really believe that.
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:14.840]  Unbelievable.
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:15.840]  Let's take a phone call.
[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:17.840]  Let's talk to Comey in Tennessee.
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:18.840]  You're on the air.
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:19.840]  You want to talk about solutions?
[02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:20.840]  Go ahead.
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:21.840]  All right.
[02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:24.840]  Yes, thank you for the time call.
[02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:29.840]  I have a comment and I got a question for Alex and Mr. Griffin.
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:30.840]  Go ahead.
[02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:31.840]  Okay.
[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:32.840]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:32.840 --> 02:48:33.840]  Yeah.
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:34.840]  Okay.
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:43.840]  I think that part of the problem with all this is that those of us who call
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:47.840]  us those Christians are doing very, very little.
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:52.840]  So God has allowed these people to come in and to get our attention.
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:58.840]  And Mr. Griffin, you had mentioned about taking control of the ship, which obviously
[02:48:58.840 --> 02:49:00.840]  we have to do.
[02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:08.840]  Can you comment on how that may not be possible unless we call on a captain of our house,
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:11.840]  the God of the universe.
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:12.840]  Sure.
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:13.840]  Sure.
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:16.840]  Undoubtedly, as the founder said, you have to have a moral people to be free.
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:18.840]  Yes, I agree with that totally.
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:25.840]  I don't discount the power of people who do not have a strong religious conviction yet.
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:29.840]  I mean, I think everybody, by the time they get toward the end of their lives, their religious
[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:34.840]  convictions get more serious attention than when they're young and they think they're
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:35.840]  going to live forever.
[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:39.840]  But I find that there is, yes, first of all, I agree with that totally.
[02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:49.840]  You have to have a set of principles that are based on values that are beyond oneself.
[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:54.840]  I mean, I think that's pretty obvious because if you are the only reason for existing, why
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:50:00.840]  not just sell out to the highest bidder or to the most fearsome tyrant?
[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:04.840]  A man's got to have a code to live by, as John Wayne said.
[02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:07.840]  And if you have no rudder, you'll just go join the biggest evil.
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:11.840]  And that's why once a tyranny comes in, it always degenerates so fast.
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:16.840]  Yes, but where I was going with that is that I think we all have programmed within us this
[02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:24.840]  instinct for a higher principle than ourselves, whether we base it on a religious principle
[02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:27.840]  or if we just say it's instinct, we just all have it.
[02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:34.840]  Every primitive society, even the ones that worship the God in the volcano, their concepts
[02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:37.840]  of deity are far different than ours.
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:40.840]  They all have this instinct for justice.
[02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:45.840]  And sometimes they make great sacrifices of themselves for their family and their loved ones.
[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:52.840]  I think we need to tune in to that sensitivity, that instinct, that inequality.
[02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:54.840]  Our humanity, we have to tune in to it.
[02:50:54.840 --> 02:50:57.840]  Yes, we have to rediscover our humanity before it's lost.
[02:50:57.840 --> 02:51:04.840]  Thank you, Colin. More calls straight ahead.
[02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:34.840]  We'll see you next time.
[02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:04.840]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.
[02:52:04.840 --> 02:52:06.840]  So you may know a few things about him.
[02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:13.840]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[02:52:13.840 --> 02:52:19.840]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[02:52:19.840 --> 02:52:22.840]  It's true, and he can email you the test results.
[02:52:22.840 --> 02:52:24.840]  Just visit goberkey.com.
[02:52:24.840 --> 02:52:29.840]  You may also know that the Berkey guy has helped tens of thousands of people get better prepared.
[02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:31.840]  Now here's something you may not know.

[02:52:56.840 --> 02:53:00.840]  Goberkey.com, home of a Berkey guy.
[02:53:00.840 --> 02:53:06.840]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've witnessed that a lot of illness can be linked to toxins and deficiencies combined.
[02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:13.840]  Improving your liver function and restoring your cells ability to detoxify is essential to achieving radiant health.
[02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:17.840]  Listen to the real world results of Doug and his wife after taking one world way.
[02:53:17.840 --> 02:53:22.840]  My name is Doug Dideril. For years I had an ongoing rash with itching around my eyes.
[02:53:22.840 --> 02:53:26.840]  This was due to metal dust particles landing on my face in the workplace.
[02:53:26.840 --> 02:53:32.840]  After being on one world way for two weeks, I began to have a severe rash and itching sensation around my eyes.
[02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:37.840]  This rash and itching lasted for five weeks and is now 100% gone.
[02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:45.840]  Additionally, without extra exercise, I've also increased my muscle size and my wife has lost weight and gained a more attractive figure.
[02:53:45.840 --> 02:53:48.840]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:53:48.840 --> 02:53:51.840]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:53:51.840 --> 02:53:54.840]  888-988-3325.
[02:53:54.840 --> 02:53:56.840]  Or visit 1worldway.com.
[02:53:56.840 --> 02:54:16.840]  That's 1worldWHEY.com.
[02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:26.840]  Yeah, right now Fox News is reporting that TSA is going to be on the streets and at your rodeo and everywhere in your life, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:26.840 --> 02:54:34.840]  And they start with trucks that are under transportation code where they think they can violate their rights and they're now moving into the general public.
[02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:38.840]  They're in shopping malls with the police and the army in many cases.
[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:43.840]  This is the incremental rollout of martial law.
[02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:47.840]  They're showing them on Fox News going into neighborhoods.
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:53.840]  They just showed that in somebody's trailer park with dogs coming up to your houses.
[02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:58.840]  This is it, folks. They're getting ready to blow a bunch of stuff up and pose the saviors on the news.
[02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:00.840]  That approach is pretty clear.
[02:55:00.840 --> 02:55:03.840]  When they do carry out these false flags, you've got to record everything.
[02:55:03.840 --> 02:55:06.840]  If you're on the scene, start videotaping because we'll catch them.
[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:12.840]  But this is a toe-to-toe war with people that have taken this country and believe it's theirs.
[02:55:12.840 --> 02:55:19.840]  G. Edward Griffin, man, do we get an apology for everything we've talked about coming true and coming out in the open?
[02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:23.840]  I mean, we know they're following a battle plan, a program, a script.
[02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:26.840]  So that's why we know what they're going to do when we've read their writings.
[02:55:26.840 --> 02:55:30.840]  People think now they're like, some people are like, how did you know this? You're a prophet.
[02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:31.840]  No, they told us what they would do.
[02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:34.840]  But still others are getting more mad at us now.
[02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:36.840]  I've noticed that, okay, you're the bad guy.
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:40.840]  I want the TSA in my neighborhood.
[02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:42.840]  Well, that's because they've fallen for all the garbage.
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:44.840]  They've fallen for the propaganda.
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:46.840]  They're the victims of the mine war.
[02:55:46.840 --> 02:55:48.840]  They've been subjected.
[02:55:48.840 --> 02:55:54.840]  They actually believe what they've been told, that the TSA and all of the Homeland Security Theater,
[02:55:54.840 --> 02:55:58.840]  they actually believe that that's there to protect them against terrorists.
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:01.840]  So their minds have been captured.
[02:56:01.840 --> 02:56:03.840]  And naturally they'll turn against it.
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:07.840]  Just as they did, I mentioned Mao Tse Tong and Hitler before, you go back.
[02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:09.840]  Everything that's happening now has happened before.
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:11.840]  You don't have to imagine.
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:13.840]  What's crazy is that even?
[02:56:13.840 --> 02:56:18.840]  Well, when he took over in China, who were the people that the masses were led to turn against?
[02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:24.840]  The landholders, the ones that had saved, the ones that produced food, the ones that had nice things.
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:26.840]  All the rabble had been robbed.
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:27.840]  You're the people.
[02:56:27.840 --> 02:56:32.840]  They said you were the greedy ones that you brought about all this misery and all this war and so forth.
[02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:38.840]  And the good, honest, hardworking people were put to the wall and killed by not the communists,
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:43.840]  but by the peasants who were whipped up into a frenzy of hatred.
[02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:46.840]  They actually believed the propaganda.
[02:56:46.840 --> 02:56:47.840]  That's how it works.
[02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:48.840]  Unbelievable.
[02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:55.840]  And when you study it, then they had some estimates that 80 plus million Chinese die because they killed all the producers.
[02:56:55.840 --> 02:57:00.840]  Yes, of course, the producers had to go because the producers were the ones who had some smarts.
[02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:04.840]  Not only were they producers, why were they producers?
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:06.840]  Just because they inherited something?
[02:57:06.840 --> 02:57:09.840]  No, in most cases it's because they were hardworking.
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:10.840]  They were intelligent people.
[02:57:10.840 --> 02:57:11.840]  They had principles.
[02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:14.840]  They had self-discipline and they worked.
[02:57:14.840 --> 02:57:21.840]  Well, you can't have that kind of an individual in a collectivist society because he doesn't want to give up everything to the collective.
[02:57:21.840 --> 02:57:23.840]  He thinks that he's entitled to the collective.
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:26.840]  Undoubtedly, collectivism creates nightmares.
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:27.840]  It creates stupid...
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:29.840]  I mean, I look at Obama supporters on the street.
[02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:30.840]  We go out and interview them.
[02:57:30.840 --> 02:57:32.840]  They literally can hardly talk.
[02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:34.840]  Black, white, Hispanic, I don't care.
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:35.840]  And they have dead eyes.
[02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:37.840]  I mean, they really are.
[02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:38.840]  I'm sorry.
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:40.840]  I didn't know you could stack crap that high.
[02:57:40.840 --> 02:57:41.840]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:43.840]  These really are sad, pathetic people.
[02:57:43.840 --> 02:57:49.840]  And then so-called intellectuals promote collectivism like, oh, you just don't get it's going to create a utopia.
[02:57:49.840 --> 02:57:51.840]  No, it creates nightmares.
[02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:53.840]  Yeah, these are zombies.
[02:57:53.840 --> 02:57:55.840]  These are intellectual zombies that they rely upon.
[02:57:55.840 --> 02:57:57.840]  There's no question about it.
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:03.840]  They're the ones that are the first wave that always come and hold the positions in the first wave.
[02:58:03.840 --> 02:58:08.840]  When collectivists come to power, they empty the prisons and take the worst vile criminals
[02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:12.840]  and put them in charge of the police and the new prisons.
[02:58:12.840 --> 02:58:15.840]  They're the vile ones that torture...
[02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:16.840]  Oh, yeah.
[02:58:16.840 --> 02:58:21.840]  That's who now they pretty much only hire felons to be the CPS parents.
[02:58:21.840 --> 02:58:22.840]  That's right.
[02:58:22.840 --> 02:58:23.840]  That's how it works.
[02:58:23.840 --> 02:58:24.840]  That's collectivism.
[02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:25.840]  Unbelievable.
[02:58:25.840 --> 02:58:27.840]  We're a little bit of an overdrive and go to Ed.
[02:58:27.840 --> 02:58:30.840]  And we're going to go to Anthony.
[02:58:30.840 --> 02:58:33.840]  And then we'll try to go to Rusty and a few others straight ahead.
[02:58:33.840 --> 02:58:36.840]  We've got Jason calling about military drills.
[02:58:36.840 --> 02:58:41.840]  We're going to be right back infowars.com for a last show to find the free video feed.
[02:58:41.840 --> 02:59:01.840]  And then infowars, nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central, prisonplanet.tv.

[03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:31.920]  All right, folks.
[03:00:31.920 --> 03:00:34.920]  Final segment with G.Edward Griffin of realityzone.com.
[03:00:34.920 --> 03:00:36.920]  I think this is our best interview ever.
[03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:39.920]  We really are just laying it all out.
[03:00:39.920 --> 03:00:43.920]  Let's try to go as many of your calls as we can, a question from Ed.
[03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:44.920]  You know, hi.
[03:00:44.920 --> 03:00:45.920]  Oh, thanks for holding Ed.
[03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:46.920]  You're on the air.
[03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:47.920]  Alex, Mr. Griffin.
[03:00:47.920 --> 03:00:49.920]  Yeah, I bless you all and your families.
[03:00:49.920 --> 03:00:50.920]  Thank you.
[03:00:50.920 --> 03:00:57.920]  Um, first time caller, um, listen to your show every day when you're recapped.
[03:00:57.920 --> 03:01:00.920]  Um, I'm also a member of your prison plan.
[03:01:00.920 --> 03:01:01.920]  I've got TV.
[03:01:01.920 --> 03:01:02.920]  Thank you.
[03:01:02.920 --> 03:01:03.920]  Couldn't do it without you.
[03:01:03.920 --> 03:01:04.920]  Couldn't do it without you, sir.
[03:01:04.920 --> 03:01:06.920]  Well, hey, I'm a disabled vet.
[03:01:06.920 --> 03:01:07.920]  I served this country.
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:11.920]  So did my father gave up half his left lung in battle with a bulge.
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:15.920]  And the stone had a brother POW four years in Vietnam.
[03:01:15.920 --> 03:01:19.920]  I got a cousin who was 101st Airborne in World War II.
[03:01:19.920 --> 03:01:23.920]  The only thing that came back from him was the decorated uniform with his name on it
[03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:25.920]  with the flag-dragged box.
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:28.920]  This is not what they gave their lives for.
[03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:32.920]  This is not what I gave up college to serve my country just so I didn't have to register
[03:01:32.920 --> 03:01:34.920]  prospective service.
[03:01:34.920 --> 03:01:38.920]  Sir, I am upset and I'm very disappointed.
[03:01:38.920 --> 03:01:39.920]  I love my country.
[03:01:39.920 --> 03:01:40.920]  I love you all.
[03:01:40.920 --> 03:01:42.920]  I love God.
[03:01:42.920 --> 03:01:44.920]  I hate my government.
[03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:46.920]  And I want my country back.
[03:01:46.920 --> 03:01:48.920]  Well, sir, God bless you.
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:49.920]  Well, you know, it's not your government.
[03:01:49.920 --> 03:01:50.920]  That's the thing.
[03:01:50.920 --> 03:01:52.920]  It's been hijacked, but I, I hear you.
[03:01:52.920 --> 03:01:56.920]  We've got to get the word out that America's been occupied and, and just do as much as
[03:01:56.920 --> 03:01:58.920]  we can try to fix this peacefully.
[03:01:58.920 --> 03:02:00.920]  Jabber Griffin, do you think it's going to be fixed peacefully?
[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:03.920]  Are they going to blow stuff up and blame it on us and try to come get us?
[03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:06.920]  And we're going to have to fight back?
[03:02:06.920 --> 03:02:08.920]  I wish I knew the answer.
[03:02:08.920 --> 03:02:13.920]  My impulse is to say if it doesn't get fixed peacefully or relatively peacefully,
[03:02:13.920 --> 03:02:18.920]  and that's a weasel word, but I don't think it's going to get fixed with violence.
[03:02:18.920 --> 03:02:20.920]  I don't think it's going to be revolution.
[03:02:20.920 --> 03:02:22.920]  I don't think that's going to work.
[03:02:22.920 --> 03:02:27.920]  It has to be an intellectual revolution first and then we have to take the ship back.
[03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:31.920]  But I don't think we're going to take it back with guns and bayonets because they have all
[03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:32.920]  the really powerful weapons.
[03:02:32.920 --> 03:02:34.920]  It's as simple as that.
[03:02:34.920 --> 03:02:38.920]  Well, I tend to agree with you at certain levels, but if it's, if it's, if it's bad guys,
[03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:40.920]  I mean, we're not going to have conventional war.
[03:02:40.920 --> 03:02:43.920]  Bad guys that serve the New World Order will just start falling down and hitting their head
[03:02:43.920 --> 03:02:46.920]  if they keep persecuting and killing journalists and people.
[03:02:46.920 --> 03:02:48.920]  Just, you know, it's kind of like Fight Club.
[03:02:48.920 --> 03:02:52.920]  You just, you know, everybody's in on resisting it.
[03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:56.920]  I mean, I don't want to brag, but I go everywhere and the crew's like, this is like Fight Club.
[03:02:56.920 --> 03:02:58.920]  Everybody's walking by nodding, cops are winking.
[03:02:58.920 --> 03:03:01.920]  People are bringing me free food at every restaurant I go to.
[03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:02.920]  I'm not bragging.
[03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:05.920]  I'm just one guy that people are pinging off of.
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:06.920]  I go to England.
[03:03:06.920 --> 03:03:07.920]  It's the same deal.
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:10.920]  I mean, I mean, gee, Edward, I know you're well known as well.
[03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:12.920]  You got to have a lot of folks in public come over to you.
[03:03:12.920 --> 03:03:16.920]  Let me tell you, our numbers are big and people are getting sick of what's going on.
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:18.920]  Well, I agree with that.
[03:03:18.920 --> 03:03:20.920]  And that's, that's my hope, of course.
[03:03:20.920 --> 03:03:22.920]  And just what do those people do?
[03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:29.920]  I have a feeling that if going back to Nazi Germany, for example, if Nazi Germany had
[03:03:29.920 --> 03:03:36.920]  not been knocked out of the, out of the saddle by the United States, it might have taken over the world.
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:41.920]  I don't know what, I don't think there was any power within Germany itself that could
[03:03:41.920 --> 03:03:43.920]  have overthrown the Nazi regime.
[03:03:43.920 --> 03:03:45.920]  It wasn't visible at least.
[03:03:45.920 --> 03:03:50.920]  So that's, that's why I'm questioning whether or not just numbers alone.
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:51.920]  Absolutely.
[03:03:51.920 --> 03:03:57.920]  When you've got a giant organized military that's willing to die with, with training
[03:03:57.920 --> 03:04:00.920]  and industry behind it, it's hard to beat without another big army.
[03:04:00.920 --> 03:04:05.920]  But, but I go back to the Nazis almost were able to take out Hitler several times and
[03:04:05.920 --> 03:04:06.920]  failed, unfortunately.
[03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:10.920]  And, and, you know, they probably did a poisoning linen and they just got something worse.
[03:04:10.920 --> 03:04:15.920]  But the point is there will be, there will be resistance no matter what happens, particularly
[03:04:15.920 --> 03:04:20.920]  if we wake up, if we wake up more people, but I agree, we better work like the Dickens
[03:04:20.920 --> 03:04:23.920]  now to try to really let people know how much trouble we're in.
[03:04:23.920 --> 03:04:24.920]  This isn't a game.
[03:04:24.920 --> 03:04:28.920]  That's true, but your point about Hitler is certainly interesting because if Hitler
[03:04:28.920 --> 03:04:31.920]  had been taken out, who would have replaced him?
[03:04:31.920 --> 03:04:35.920]  It would have been him or somebody just as bad or maybe not as crazy as Hitler.
[03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:38.920]  They didn't object to Hitler's philosophy.
[03:04:38.920 --> 03:04:40.920]  They didn't object to his collective.
[03:04:40.920 --> 03:04:41.920]  I'm going to put you on the spot.
[03:04:41.920 --> 03:04:43.920]  I'm going to put you on the spot.
[03:04:43.920 --> 03:04:44.920]  If you got to go, you got to go.
[03:04:44.920 --> 03:04:46.920]  Can you do 10 more minutes with us on the other side?
[03:04:46.920 --> 03:04:48.920]  I'm afraid I can't because I have another radio.
[03:04:48.920 --> 03:04:49.920]  I knew it.
[03:04:49.920 --> 03:04:51.920]  I knew you, but I know you do these on days.
[03:04:51.920 --> 03:04:52.920]  You, you book, book, book.
[03:04:52.920 --> 03:04:53.920]  That's why I figured you'd say no.
[03:04:53.920 --> 03:04:55.920]  All right, you bet.
[03:04:55.920 --> 03:04:56.920]  Great job, buddy.
[03:04:56.920 --> 03:04:57.920]  Sorry, the other callers.
[03:04:57.920 --> 03:04:59.920]  Thanks for that last caller.
[03:04:59.920 --> 03:05:24.920]  We'll see you guys back tonight.
