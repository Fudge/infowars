[00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:10.150]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.751]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:13.293]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.293 --> 00:00:17.477]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.477 --> 00:00:21.581]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.827 --> 00:00:47.889]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, and it of course is Wednesday, the 7th day of August, 2013.
[00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:56.030]  And I've got a big stack of news articles here that have been coming out, even ABC News, in the last couple days.
[00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.271]  Young women's ovaries destroyed by Gardasil.
[00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:04.872]  Merck forgot to research, that's a quote, side effects of vaccine on female reproduction.
[00:01:05.772 --> 00:01:14.060]  We posted this story a couple days ago on InfoWars.com and I guess it's good sometimes that somebody reposted it.
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.106]  Sometimes mistakes are good because I saw it again this morning and was reminded that I had not covered that.
[00:01:21.267 --> 00:01:33.657]  I'm going to get to, you know, things like this that are very serious that, you know, that aren't really the big news of the day, which they tend to distract us with, but are very, very serious for everybody out there to discuss exactly what's going on with Gardasil.
[00:01:33.657 --> 00:01:40.323]  Also, we've got a special report with Gigi coming up here in just a moment.
[00:01:41.496 --> 00:01:45.198]  Dealing with the mass overpass demonstrations.
[00:01:45.198 --> 00:01:46.939]  Over 1,700 out in LA.
[00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.863]  It's got to be over 100 people out in Austin at different locations at different times all over the city.
[00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:54.263]  All over the country this happened.
[00:01:54.263 --> 00:01:55.764]  There's more today.
[00:01:55.764 --> 00:01:57.605]  So we have info up on that.
[00:01:57.605 --> 00:01:58.926]  They're calling to impeach Obama.
[00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:01.087]  We're going to be playing that report in about a minute.
[00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:02.668]  Also disgusting.
[00:02:02.668 --> 00:02:03.389]  Homeland Security.
[00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:17.080]  Ads, billboards and posters going up, you know, showing good-looking women, sexy women, reporting on people how sexy and cool it is to be part of the new Stasi Nazi Soviet chic.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:29.110]  That report up on Infowars.com and how it ties into more mainstream media now reporting, and the EFF Foundation as well, that yes, the government is spying on all of you for petty crimes with the NSA.
[00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.071]  Yeah, that's a fact.
[00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:39.015]  It's there to make sure their criminal operations, their money laundering, child kidnapping, murder for hire, doesn't get stopped.
[00:02:39.015 --> 00:02:41.756]  That's the main mission in the steal patents and ideas.
[00:02:41.756 --> 00:02:44.618]  But that's all now mainstream news.
[00:02:44.618 --> 00:02:48.060]  And we have a man on the street coming up where a bunch of Austinites just beg.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.701]  To be total slaves.
[00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:51.362]  We'll cover that at the bottom in the next hour.
[00:02:51.362 --> 00:02:53.304]  We've got Gia Berggriffin coming on today as well.
[00:02:53.304 --> 00:03:00.850]  But we're going to go out to break with this InfoWars Nightly News report from last night on these spontaneous demonstrations that are starting up all over the country.
[00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.710]  Here it is.
[00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.414]  I'm Gigi Arnetta reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:03:06.414 --> 00:03:14.180]  And we're standing here on an overpass at Maynard Drive in Austin, Texas, where people are honking for Obama's impeachment.
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.962]  So what gave you guys this idea?
[00:03:16.718 --> 00:03:18.019]  This is a national movement.
[00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.584]  It was started by James Nabors, who's up in Oklahoma.
[00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:25.488]  We've got groups like this in all 50 states.
[00:03:25.488 --> 00:03:35.960]  And yeah, we're just out here trying to raise people's awareness a little bit and get them woken up to what's going on with the Obama administration and try to get him out of office.
[00:03:36.457 --> 00:03:39.841]  So you believe that these are definitely not phony scandals?
[00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:40.722]  Definitely not.
[00:03:40.722 --> 00:03:42.283]  They're felonies, you know?
[00:03:42.283 --> 00:03:46.948]  And we elect these folks to govern us, but not to rule us.
[00:03:46.948 --> 00:03:54.256]  And we have a constitution to limit the federal government's power, and they're just shredding the constitution daily.
[00:03:54.256 --> 00:03:55.337]  I want to know...
[00:03:56.218 --> 00:03:59.541]  How many people are out there that would like to be doing something?
[00:03:59.541 --> 00:04:00.422]  They get frustrated.
[00:04:00.422 --> 00:04:06.146]  They say, well, I'm going to do something tomorrow and I'm going to do something today.
[00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:08.048]  Something that's going to count.
[00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:13.893]  You know, you got to get out of the from behind the computer and go out and try to get some things done.
[00:04:14.488 --> 00:04:18.093]  We're in a neighborhood where people actually told us, oh no, you don't want to go out there.
[00:04:18.093 --> 00:04:21.037]  There are too many people for Obama out there.
[00:04:21.037 --> 00:04:25.023]  But we're getting a great response and we're going to stay out here as long as we can.
[00:04:25.023 --> 00:04:26.465]  I'm going to be out here every chance I get.
[00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:27.626]  I took off work for this today.
[00:04:27.626 --> 00:04:31.131]  I mean, I'd take off work if I was sick or if I had a sick child.
[00:04:32.045 --> 00:04:33.306]  The Republic's sick.
[00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:34.547]  It needs help.
[00:04:34.547 --> 00:04:35.808]  That's what I'm here for.
[00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:39.531]  One group near Los Angeles has 1,780 people.
[00:04:39.531 --> 00:04:42.094]  1,780 people.
[00:04:42.094 --> 00:04:42.854]  That's incredible.
[00:04:42.854 --> 00:04:43.735]  One group.
[00:04:43.735 --> 00:04:48.879]  And if you go to overpasses.org, you can find out more information about the event they're having August 17th.
[00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.521]  Get out and help.
[00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:53.283]  Help change what's happening to our Constitution.
[00:04:53.283 --> 00:04:56.446]  I'm Gigi Ornette reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:08:04.737 --> 00:08:06.597]  We are on the march.
[00:08:06.597 --> 00:08:09.778]  The empire is on the run.
[00:08:09.778 --> 00:08:13.479]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.436 --> 00:08:19.021]  Woo!
[00:08:26.249 --> 00:08:36.133]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us here on this Wednesday, August 7th, 2013, worldwide broadcast.
[00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:43.535]  G. Edward Griffin, who for more than 45 years has been fighting the globalist incremental takeover of the United States.
[00:08:43.535 --> 00:08:47.337]  He's also the best-selling author of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:08:47.337 --> 00:08:50.758]  He will be joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[00:08:50.758 --> 00:08:53.219]  We will open the phones up as well.
[00:08:54.219 --> 00:09:20.602]  I'm going to get Leanne McAdoo and Gigi Ernetta both in studio here today at the bottom of the next hour because I want to play a short report that Gigi went out and shot on the road in Austin yesterday afternoon versus a report that Leanne McAdoo went out on the streets of Austin yesterday and shot that were both on the nightly news last night.
[00:09:21.744 --> 00:09:39.060]  They went downtown and found one group of trendies who said they want the NSA spying on everything they do, kind of like the Miss USA pageant where they were all this year begging to be spied on for everyone's safety, versus people out calling for the impeachment of Obama for illegal NSA spying.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.585]  The light in their eyes, the intelligence of the pro-liberty people,
[00:09:44.721 --> 00:09:53.644]  Who are as different from the Obama sheeple as living are from the dead.
[00:09:53.644 --> 00:10:03.046]  So we're going to get both of our reporters, both of our female reporters, who do a great job, in studio with us at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:10:03.046 --> 00:10:08.908]  And then I'm going to send all my reporters out on the street to really go out and challenge people
[00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:20.316]  Uh, on average in Austin, about 60% say they want to have the Fourth Amendment annihilated and think it's wonderful to have the government watching everything they do.
[00:10:20.316 --> 00:10:24.839]  And I want to send my reporters out to say, okay, but Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia did that.
[00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:28.142]  And why did we have a Bill of Rights and Constitution saying that was illegal?
[00:10:28.142 --> 00:10:29.923]  And by the way, do you know that's illegal?
[00:10:29.923 --> 00:10:30.564]  How dare you?
[00:10:32.694 --> 00:10:48.183]  I'm so busy working on Obama Deception 2 and doing the radio show and doing radio interviews and working on administrative stuff and trying to build new sites and apps and all the stuff I'm trying to administer here that I don't have a lot of time to go out on the streets, but I need to go out on the streets.
[00:10:48.183 --> 00:10:53.066]  And I think, I said I'd do this a few weeks ago, so I guess the time has come, the time is now.
[00:10:53.066 --> 00:10:56.909]  I should probably go out in the next couple days and do it.
[00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:06.012]  Maybe even today, and go up to citizens' cars and say, mind if I search your vehicle?
[00:11:06.012 --> 00:11:09.872]  I'm part of the Homeland Security Militia Brigade.
[00:11:09.872 --> 00:11:16.454]  Of course, they could then spin it and say that, why, you're impersonating the FEMA Youth Corps.
[00:11:16.454 --> 00:11:19.694]  Just to illustrate, though, how pliant some people are.
[00:11:19.694 --> 00:11:23.675]  And then go over to police cars and just say, I'm part of the citizen
[00:11:25.714 --> 00:11:27.835]  Tattletale squad for Obama.
[00:11:27.835 --> 00:11:30.036]  And I'm going to be like, wait, I'm just volunteering.
[00:11:30.036 --> 00:11:38.839]  I mean, they've got billboards going up all over the country saying, report your neighbors, you know, showing sexy ladies pushing it.
[00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:42.620]  It's all over the news that this is the new freedom.
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.961]  So, officer, I'm just asking voluntarily, do you mind if I search your car?
[00:11:46.961 --> 00:11:48.742]  You might be a terrorist, too.
[00:11:48.742 --> 00:11:50.883]  I mean, we're, oh, why are you offended, officer?
[00:11:51.983 --> 00:11:54.448]  I wouldn't send my crew out to do this because they might arrest me.
[00:11:54.448 --> 00:11:56.151]  Because so many people are brainwashed and arrogant.
[00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:04.756]  If I run into Austin Cops, I know who I am, they'll probably start laughing at me, but I mean, I want to find one who will get offended.
[00:12:04.756 --> 00:12:09.380]  Because you film police around the country, a lot of them flip out and come arrest you outside of law.
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.601]  And I go, well, why are you offended?
[00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:18.709]  I mean, you got face scanning cameras up, license plate reading cameras, you got whole databases on people, it's all completely illegal.
[00:12:18.709 --> 00:12:23.113]  And you're doing that forcibly with my tax money, enslaving me with my own
[00:12:23.934 --> 00:12:31.300]  Fruit of my labor being extracted and used to build this giant corporate Borg singularity takeover nightmare grid.
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.302]  I'm here trying to defend your rights, officer.
[00:12:33.302 --> 00:12:35.544]  So I'm asking to illustrate absurdity.
[00:12:35.544 --> 00:12:36.725]  Let me search your vehicle.
[00:12:36.725 --> 00:12:39.167]  Well, no, you're not going to search my vehicle.
[00:12:39.167 --> 00:12:41.089]  What do you have to hide, officer?
[00:12:41.089 --> 00:12:41.989]  What do I have to hide?
[00:12:41.989 --> 00:12:43.991]  Get up against the wall.
[00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:49.896]  And at that point, I'm going to say, so it's so shocking that I'm asking to search your vehicle.
[00:12:49.896 --> 00:12:51.878]  You're trying to put me in handcuffs right now.
[00:12:52.554 --> 00:12:59.798]  This is going to be powerful, folks, and I'm going to go out and do this.
[00:12:59.798 --> 00:13:04.580]  Mark Dice did it a few months ago, something similar, where he went out on the streets.
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.341]  We posted the video on Infowars.com.
[00:13:06.341 --> 00:13:08.062]  I forget the exact name of it.
[00:13:08.062 --> 00:13:09.303]  Maybe try to pull it up.
[00:13:09.303 --> 00:13:18.207]  And he went out and said, I'm here with, you know, these citizens, Obama volunteers, and they said, see, something says, I think, might I search your car?
[00:13:18.207 --> 00:13:19.368]  Might I search your person?
[00:13:19.368 --> 00:13:21.129]  And some people said, yeah, go ahead.
[00:13:22.011 --> 00:13:25.632]  Because their religion is being compliant.
[00:13:25.632 --> 00:13:27.873]  Their religion is bending over.
[00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:33.955]  Their religion, as long as you say, for Obama, we should arrest all the gun owners and put them in FEMA camps for Obama.
[00:13:33.955 --> 00:13:34.355]  Oh, yes.
[00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:36.556]  9 out of 10 said yes.
[00:13:36.556 --> 00:13:38.997]  We should euthanize all the old people for Obama.
[00:13:38.997 --> 00:13:40.097]  Kill them.
[00:13:40.097 --> 00:13:42.218]  Yes, for Obama.
[00:13:42.218 --> 00:13:46.180]  We should open the borders completely up and bring in world government for Obama.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.200]  Yes, for Obama.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.662]  And I found that as well, with Democrats especially.
[00:13:51.662 --> 00:13:55.804]  I could say, we're gonna kill babies up to age three for Obama.
[00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:58.226]  In fact, this has been done by multiple groups.
[00:13:58.226 --> 00:13:59.827]  Yes, for Obama.
[00:13:59.827 --> 00:14:03.649]  Because their whole identity is with, hey, I'm not intellectual.
[00:14:03.649 --> 00:14:05.550]  I don't have any real historical perspective.
[00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.172]  I don't know what I culturally stand for.
[00:14:09.172 --> 00:14:10.653]  I don't know who my ancestors were.
[00:14:10.653 --> 00:14:16.637]  I don't know about all the wars and the countless people that died in the dark for the light of liberty.
[00:14:17.947 --> 00:14:26.792]  Many people have died in the dark in defense of liberty, folks, alone, in pain, being tortured, being killed, bleeding to death on foreign fields and right here in this country.
[00:14:26.792 --> 00:14:37.217]  I mean, it is incredible the human history of the fight against gangs that get together and call themselves governments and that call themselves systems and unleash hell every time.
[00:14:37.217 --> 00:14:46.983]  And now the hell... If there was a cup, a big, stinking, scrofulous cess cup of disease and tyranny,
[00:14:48.101 --> 00:14:57.629]  And the Constitution's being imploded and the table is rocking and rumbling, and only sloshing tyranny has come out so far.
[00:14:57.629 --> 00:15:00.051]  And the sheeple see it and get scared.
[00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:11.080]  They really know what's going on, deep down in their feeble minds, but they decide to serve it and comply with it and amass Stockholm Syndrome, believing that that will then somehow give them a reprieve.
[00:15:12.517 --> 00:15:19.202]  So the cup is sloshing, and only a few drops had splattered in the last decade or so.
[00:15:19.202 --> 00:15:32.411]  Now larger projections of it are splattering on the table, but still the cup's about 85% full, and it's getting ready to completely tump over.
[00:15:32.411 --> 00:15:38.896]  And by the way, if we let it tump over, it suddenly becomes a bottomless cup, like a fire hose is attached to it, spewing evil.
[00:15:41.963 --> 00:15:53.448]  And as soon as the public goes under the intimidation, goes under the fear, and says, I will comply, that's when the three-year-old is in the front yard and the man says, I have the candy.
[00:15:53.448 --> 00:15:55.769]  And the little kid's scared.
[00:15:55.769 --> 00:15:58.911]  Their instinct is run, but they say, come here now.
[00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:00.972]  And the little kid gets in the van and is never seen again.
[00:16:03.564 --> 00:16:05.125]  Is tortured in a basement for months.
[00:16:05.125 --> 00:16:08.307]  That's what those demons do.
[00:16:08.307 --> 00:16:08.968]  It's an archetype.
[00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.449]  It's a spirit.
[00:16:10.449 --> 00:16:13.951]  If you don't believe in God, it's a spirit.
[00:16:13.951 --> 00:16:15.132]  And that's what the globalists want.
[00:16:15.132 --> 00:16:22.757]  They want full control so societally they can have us all in the basement.
[00:16:22.757 --> 00:16:24.919]  And torture our innocence.
[00:16:24.919 --> 00:16:31.003]  Their real target is innocence and beauty and goodness.
[00:16:31.003 --> 00:16:32.544]  They want to kill the unicorn, folks.
[00:16:34.517 --> 00:16:38.065]  That's because that's what they do, they're demons.
[00:16:38.065 --> 00:16:39.709]  Use the analogy of legend.
[00:16:42.116 --> 00:16:56.129]  And they use well-meaning Miss America, Miss USA, they use all the well-meaning shallow people out there to sell their agenda of torture, war, invasion, surveillance, all of it, because innocence is the face of it.
[00:16:56.129 --> 00:17:01.154]  They say, we're doing this to protect innocence, but it's actually the opposite.
[00:17:01.154 --> 00:17:05.458]  They're doing it to sell absolute hell on earth.
[00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:07.160]  Everywhere the globalists are in control.
[00:17:08.479 --> 00:17:22.789]  They bring down societies, they eviscerate the family, they cut off the food and water, they starve the population, they bring in absolute bondage and poverty and starvation and pain.
[00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:25.370]  The wages of the New World Order are death.
[00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:37.779]  The fruits of the New World Order, its wavelength, its signature, its spirit, is pain and suffering and dishonor and backstabbing and mental illness.
[00:17:38.852 --> 00:17:42.634]  And the collapse of all that is good.
[00:17:42.634 --> 00:17:44.855]  The end of light.
[00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:50.398]  The coming of the stench of death.
[00:17:50.398 --> 00:17:53.760]  The journey is the destination.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.002]  And I have tried as best I can to warn you of these facts.
[00:18:00.796 --> 00:18:22.311]  Coming up today, we're going to have those two reporters in for probably two segments, 25 minutes or so, the last 25 minutes or 27 minutes to be technical, of the second half of the next hour to illustrate people that are out speaking for liberty and freedom and justice, who have an instinct, who have a spirit of defense.
[00:18:23.587 --> 00:18:39.479]  of freedom and who understand the grave danger we're entering versus the supine sycophantic dead eyes of the servants of evil.
[00:18:39.479 --> 00:18:46.545]  So we're going to be contrasting those two different types coming up with these reports.
[00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:49.286]  G. Edward Griffin, as I said.
[00:18:49.286 --> 00:18:49.767]  Oh, look!
[00:18:49.767 --> 00:18:53.190]  Homeland Security criticized over sexy spy ads.
[00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.793]  See Something Say Something campaign has caught zero terrorists.
[00:18:56.793 --> 00:18:57.974]  And what do they use?
[00:18:57.974 --> 00:19:06.722]  They use good-looking, quote, minority women who report in the billboards and TV ads.
[00:19:09.151 --> 00:19:11.915]  On exclusively white males and white women.
[00:19:11.915 --> 00:19:13.917]  So they're also racially branding that.
[00:19:13.917 --> 00:19:15.199]  And of course you've heard them.
[00:19:15.199 --> 00:19:21.387]  They're now saying that one of the Boston bombing patsies, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, is a right winger.
[00:19:21.387 --> 00:19:22.749]  He's not a Muslim extremist now.
[00:19:24.768 --> 00:19:26.551]  Usually you think I talk about myself when I'm in the news.
[00:19:26.551 --> 00:19:29.234]  They're back to saying he was an Alex Jones listener.
[00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:31.637]  Just like the AP and others said right after it happened.
[00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:32.999]  I'm like, hey, look, they did a drill.
[00:19:32.999 --> 00:19:34.281]  Looks like they work for CIA.
[00:19:34.281 --> 00:19:35.182]  OK, they did.
[00:19:35.182 --> 00:19:36.083]  They were being set up.
[00:19:36.083 --> 00:19:37.605]  All right.
[00:19:37.605 --> 00:19:40.289]  Oh, Alex Jones did it.
[00:19:40.289 --> 00:19:41.651]  Thank God to be watching my back.
[00:19:46.926 --> 00:19:48.747]  So we're going to be getting into all that.
[00:19:48.747 --> 00:19:55.250]  And all over the country, they're announcing neighborhood groups, apartments, you name it.
[00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.832]  You can't have a gun or any other weapon or defend yourself.
[00:19:58.832 --> 00:19:59.793]  We're going to cover that first.
[00:20:00.868 --> 00:20:03.510]  Can you go without a good meal for three days?
[00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.012]  Is your pantry prepared for what's around the corner?

[00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:12.244]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[00:21:12.244 --> 00:21:18.069]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos.
[00:21:18.936 --> 00:21:30.166]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive.
[00:21:30.166 --> 00:21:34.330]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[00:21:35.071 --> 00:21:43.733]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real, secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo.
[00:21:43.733 --> 00:21:47.574]  And it's not just in response to mass murders of preparing for war.
[00:21:47.574 --> 00:21:50.035]  It's something much darker.
[00:21:50.035 --> 00:21:55.716]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down.
[00:21:55.716 --> 00:21:57.056]  Again, that's 123conspiracy.com.

[00:24:08.396 --> 00:24:14.758]  Coming up, we're going to play some clips of El Presidente on Jay Leno.
[00:24:14.758 --> 00:24:18.660]  We don't spy on Americans, is what Obama said.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:24.302]  That's the same line of Clapper and, of course, Alexander.
[00:24:24.302 --> 00:24:27.523]  Just absolutely incredible lie.
[00:24:27.523 --> 00:24:28.863]  On record, we're going to go over that.
[00:24:28.863 --> 00:24:33.045]  He goes on to say, odds of dying in a terrorist attack, a lot lower than dying in a car accident.
[00:24:33.045 --> 00:24:33.985]  Unfortunately,
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.442]  And then Leno says, how about solving problems that brought our country to a halt?
[00:24:40.442 --> 00:24:41.303]  Oh, he's solving them.
[00:24:41.303 --> 00:24:44.104]  He's shutting down the power plant, shipping the jobs overseas.
[00:24:44.104 --> 00:24:46.365]  He's continuing the globalist operation.
[00:24:46.365 --> 00:24:49.747]  So we're going to be playing those clips and analyzing that.
[00:24:49.747 --> 00:24:52.989]  But first off, I want to say something here today.
[00:24:52.989 --> 00:24:59.613]  If our forebears could see what we were doing right now.
[00:24:59.613 --> 00:25:01.674]  If our forebears could look down from heaven,
[00:25:02.864 --> 00:25:06.288]  Or look up from Hades, depending on where they're at.
[00:25:06.288 --> 00:25:14.597]  Do you think they would be ashamed of all that they fought for so we'd have basic dignity and liberty?
[00:25:14.597 --> 00:25:23.127]  In every other culture in the world, whoever was in charge, the nobles, the king, their minions, the sheriff, could just come in your house and have sex with your wife in front of you.
[00:25:24.042 --> 00:25:25.163]  That was their divine right.
[00:25:25.163 --> 00:25:28.625]  They could kill you if you looked at them wrong.
[00:25:28.625 --> 00:25:34.489]  And the entire world was in total poverty, except for the elites and their armored compounds.
[00:25:34.489 --> 00:25:39.113]  And it was just thousands of years of degradation and dehumanization.
[00:25:39.113 --> 00:25:41.855]  Since humans stopped being agrarian hunter-gatherers.
[00:25:42.631 --> 00:25:43.091]  We're good to go.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.381]  A light in the world in a dark age.
[00:26:05.381 --> 00:26:10.403]  And it created the science, the technology we have today that's now been co-opted and used to enslave.
[00:26:10.403 --> 00:26:12.824]  And now we're seeing the mass domestication.
[00:26:12.824 --> 00:26:22.427]  But there's no doubt, from a historical perspective, and no historian denies this now, like it's all over the news now, that we're a corrupt empire, we're a tyranny.
[00:26:22.427 --> 00:26:27.889]  But that's for people that know how to read, and people that know how to wipe their noses, and know how to tie their shoelaces.
[00:26:27.889 --> 00:26:28.429]  You have got
[00:26:30.037 --> 00:26:41.889]  A large part of the population that are a bunch of TV heads who literally have imprinted from birth on the sitcom type people that act like gibbering idiots and who have no idea of the world they're entering.
[00:26:41.889 --> 00:26:49.296]  You know, in England, in many areas of Europe, if you defend yourself with your fist in your home while being assaulted by a robber, you go to jail.
[00:26:50.501 --> 00:26:57.547]  If gypsies rob your house and you defend yourself, you're arrested and put in jail longer than a murderer would be.
[00:26:57.547 --> 00:27:01.471]  If gypsies or other groups steal your travel trailer, they get to keep it.
[00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:03.873]  That was in the news last week.
[00:27:03.873 --> 00:27:10.799]  Because the only group that is targeted is the law-abiding milk cow citizens.
[00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:13.642]  And I've had members of parliament on from England to talk about this.
[00:27:14.912 --> 00:27:18.614]  How most of the social services are foreigners that don't even speak English there.
[00:27:18.614 --> 00:27:20.115]  This is a plan, folks.
[00:27:20.115 --> 00:27:22.776]  This is a takeover.
[00:27:22.776 --> 00:27:25.818]  When they're done taking over, folks, look out.
[00:27:25.818 --> 00:27:29.500]  All these groups that have been allowed to run wild, they're going to get lined up and shot.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.722]  But right now they're bringing down the society and demoralizing us.
[00:27:32.722 --> 00:27:35.944]  Here's an article out of News 9 NBC out of Colorado.
[00:27:37.182 --> 00:27:43.950]  Castle Rock retired Marine Art Dorsch says, I want to get him on, says his Second Amendment rights are in danger.
[00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:48.416]  His apartment complex, by the way, they held out that he was allowed to be armed when he first rented it.
[00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:56.606]  So if any lawyer knew what they were doing, we ought to tell this old guy, 77-year-old retired Marine and others, that they've got at least until their current lease is up to get out.
[00:27:57.725 --> 00:28:01.208]  The apartment is on record lying, saying you gotta leave right now if you don't do it.
[00:28:01.208 --> 00:28:03.089]  That's all just social engineering.
[00:28:03.089 --> 00:28:10.454]  His apartment complex, the Oakwood Apartments in Castle Rock, sent out a notice telling all residents to get rid of their guns, but all other weapons.
[00:28:10.454 --> 00:28:12.096]  It's like England's trying to ban butcher knives.
[00:28:12.096 --> 00:28:13.757]  The 77-year-old retired U.S.
[00:28:13.757 --> 00:28:21.642]  Marine Corps veteran sent a news tip to Nine Wants to Know, saying he's afraid he'll be homeless if he wants to comply.
[00:28:22.546 --> 00:28:30.273]  The letter went out to residents on August 1st and says they have until October 1st to comply with updated community policies.
[00:28:30.273 --> 00:28:31.994]  It's policies!
[00:28:31.994 --> 00:28:41.602]  On page 2 is a brand new provision saying firearms and weapons are prohibited, including baseball bats, knives, anything.
[00:28:41.602 --> 00:28:42.223]  Boy, I tell ya.
[00:28:43.632 --> 00:28:53.278]  You know, they're gonna put this in, everybody's gonna move out, and then criminals are gonna just absolutely go crazy, just like Chicago, just like New York, just like D.C.
[00:28:53.278 --> 00:28:57.080]  They don't have the highest crime rates, not in the country, in the world.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.923]  The highest, worse than Mexico, they're worse cities.
[00:29:00.923 --> 00:29:03.925]  Worse than, you know, Tijuana in places.
[00:29:03.925 --> 00:29:10.389]  Ladies and gentlemen, is Chicago, D.C., and then New York City.
[00:29:11.704 --> 00:29:14.648]  Because they've taken the citizens' guns.
[00:29:14.648 --> 00:29:21.496]  And they go on to say he's even a license to conceal carry, but can't live there.
[00:29:21.496 --> 00:29:26.962]  This is the model, folks, where they're going to make you get insurance to have a gun and then make it so expensive you can't do it.
[00:29:26.962 --> 00:29:29.365]  They're coming after us.
[00:29:29.365 --> 00:29:31.808]  They're breaking this country's will right now.
[00:29:33.459 --> 00:29:35.060]  The federal government is not the federal government.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:43.302]  It is an alien, foreign banking, paramilitary force stabbing the country in the heart right now as fast and as hard as they can.
[00:29:43.302 --> 00:29:46.663]  I mean, this is just open evil everywhere.
[00:29:46.663 --> 00:29:50.085]  We're going to tell you more about it when we come back.
[00:29:50.085 --> 00:29:51.485]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.485 --> 00:29:54.026]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.026 --> 00:29:56.707]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:05.633]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[00:30:05.633 --> 00:30:11.578]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[00:30:11.578 --> 00:30:13.519]  What is the smartest investment you can make?

[00:32:01.471 --> 00:32:09.234]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[00:32:09.234 --> 00:32:13.476]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[00:33:02.367 --> 00:33:14.616]  You can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential program run amok.
[00:33:15.646 --> 00:33:20.370]  But when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance.
[00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:36.624]  And if people can't trust not only the executive branch, but also don't trust Congress, and don't trust federal judges, to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution, due process, and rule of law, then we're going to have some problems here.
[00:33:36.624 --> 00:33:38.746]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:38.746 --> 00:33:41.609]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[00:34:11.846 --> 00:34:14.489]  Monday through Friday, ladies and gentlemen, we're here live.
[00:34:16.844 --> 00:34:17.144]  11 a.m.
[00:34:17.144 --> 00:34:18.425]  to 2 p.m.
[00:34:18.425 --> 00:34:20.687]  Central Standard Time.
[00:34:20.687 --> 00:34:26.330]  They were able to find the article where there are calls in England to ban people even being able to own butcher knives.
[00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:34.095]  You'll get a special license over in the good old UK to be able to have a knife.
[00:34:34.095 --> 00:34:36.416]  And of course that goes back to feudalism.
[00:34:36.416 --> 00:34:43.581]  If you go back just to England only 500 years ago or so, you had to have a license to have a knife that had a point on it.
[00:34:44.561 --> 00:34:47.662]  Because you couldn't have the slaves being able to fight back.
[00:34:47.662 --> 00:34:50.984]  If you had a dog, you had to have a license.
[00:34:50.984 --> 00:34:56.706]  And if it was, say, a sheepdog, it had to have some of the digits, some of the pads cut off the foot.
[00:34:56.706 --> 00:35:01.068]  This was done all over Europe, so that it couldn't chase the king's game.
[00:35:02.253 --> 00:35:11.919]  And it didn't matter if you were starving to death in the winter and had to give most of your food and what you produced to the local noble who was, you know, two feet taller than you from generations of getting plenty of food.
[00:35:11.919 --> 00:35:18.063]  And then they even wrote manuals on how to starve people generationally to mentally retardate them so they'd be more controllable.
[00:35:18.063 --> 00:35:20.204]  That's all part of their long-term globalist operation.
[00:35:20.204 --> 00:35:23.426]  It's just an instinct of feudalistic domination.
[00:35:23.426 --> 00:35:28.069]  Now they do it through the vaccines and the GMOs and the stuff in the water.
[00:35:28.942 --> 00:35:32.244]  And all the malnutrition with the fast food and the rest of it.
[00:35:32.244 --> 00:35:36.946]  But to make a long story short, you know, I mean, it was documented, many documented cases.
[00:35:36.946 --> 00:35:45.670]  If you were caught, they rode by and smelled meat and they would come in and look in your cook pot and catch you with a rabbit bone.
[00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:48.651]  They would normally take one of your kids out and slit their throat.
[00:35:49.864 --> 00:35:51.966]  And hey, I say they did it for everybody's own safety.
[00:35:51.966 --> 00:35:53.087]  I support government.
[00:35:53.087 --> 00:35:54.008]  I'm not anti-government.
[00:35:54.008 --> 00:35:57.291]  I think our ancestors were wrong to fight against that.
[00:35:57.291 --> 00:36:00.955]  I think they all deserve to have their throats slit.
[00:36:00.955 --> 00:36:04.959]  And hey, I've seen a lot of people on InfoWars.com and on the YouTube.
[00:36:04.959 --> 00:36:08.642]  It's a minority, but they're an active, vicious minority.
[00:36:08.642 --> 00:36:12.786]  Up there saying that that little two-year-old girl, Alexandria Hill,
[00:36:14.014 --> 00:36:20.739]  Uh, who got her head bashed in, um, reportedly by the social worker, uh, that had her in her clutches.
[00:36:20.739 --> 00:36:26.123]  Uh, that, uh, you know, that's the parent's fault for smoking pot and people reporting them for smoking pot.
[00:36:26.123 --> 00:36:27.844]  Uh, and that, uh, you know, it's their fault.
[00:36:27.844 --> 00:36:31.426]  So, see, it's not your fault, uh, that that little girl's, uh, uh, dead.
[00:36:31.426 --> 00:36:33.428]  Government, you're right, it's, it's the parent's.
[00:36:33.428 --> 00:36:34.188]  Good job.
[00:36:34.188 --> 00:36:43.055]  And it's not your fault kids are seven times more likely to be abused physically or sexually or die, uh, in the federally controlled foster care systems across the country.
[00:36:43.695 --> 00:36:44.896]  You're right.
[00:36:44.896 --> 00:36:46.477]  Everything's the people's fault.
[00:36:46.477 --> 00:36:48.137]  Nothing is your fault.
[00:36:48.137 --> 00:36:53.420]  I guess the 20 point IQ reduction on average from 60 years of fluoride in the water, Harvard study.
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.461]  Yes, that's our fault too.
[00:36:54.461 --> 00:36:57.202]  I guess the diabetes up 3,000 plus percent.
[00:36:57.202 --> 00:36:58.643]  I guess that's our fault too.
[00:36:58.643 --> 00:37:05.086]  I guess the Gardasil sterilizing people and killing them all over the country and Japan and India banning it.
[00:37:05.086 --> 00:37:06.027]  I guess that's our fault too.
[00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:09.083]  Everything's the individual's fault.
[00:37:09.083 --> 00:37:11.044]  Nothing is the government's fault.
[00:37:11.044 --> 00:37:15.327]  And it's going to be your fault when the government takes your government pension funds.
[00:37:15.327 --> 00:37:16.648]  Just remember that.
[00:37:16.648 --> 00:37:17.589]  Just remember that.
[00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:24.473]  And you're real good, you know, up there talking bad about a dead two-year-old.
[00:37:24.473 --> 00:37:27.475]  There's also real people on the profile, black racists.
[00:37:28.737 --> 00:37:32.320]  on YouTube because I've seen these same handles for a long time and seen their videos.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:52.077]  These are real people celebrating the death of a two-year-old white child because they agree with, what was the name, Dr. Khalid Mohammed that you kill the women, you kill the children because the white woman is the military manufacturing center and every nine months she lays down on her back and reinforcements roll out.
[00:37:52.813 --> 00:37:58.237]  People thought I was joking a few weeks ago and I actually played that clip of the new Black Panther party leader.
[00:37:58.237 --> 00:37:59.759]  That's an exact quote.
[00:37:59.759 --> 00:38:07.505]  By the way, we're going to play Leno, but I want to get to that clip since I said that and play that.
[00:38:07.505 --> 00:38:09.507]  You know, where's Al Sharpton decrying that?
[00:38:11.072 --> 00:38:15.455]  No, no, no, because again, it's all meant to create divide and conquer.
[00:38:15.455 --> 00:38:21.240]  If you say we're going to brown bag it, that's racist, even though no one ever said brown paper had anything to do with race.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:25.083]  It means to do the little shopping bag, the little bags you bought to get your lunch in.
[00:38:25.083 --> 00:38:27.124]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:38:27.124 --> 00:38:34.970]  All the stuff that isn't really racist, that is what we obsess on, not the mass abortion, not the globalist operation against all of us.
[00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:39.234]  It is a scientific, murderous culture aimed at all humans.
[00:38:40.478 --> 00:38:43.342]  Now, speaking of Jay Leno, you know, Jay Leno, um...
[00:38:44.602 --> 00:38:48.564]  We got contacted about a month ago about would I be interested to go on there and I said of course.
[00:38:48.564 --> 00:38:49.784]  And then I never heard anything back.
[00:38:49.784 --> 00:38:51.705]  I would actually fly out there to be on Jay Leno's show.
[00:38:51.705 --> 00:38:58.028]  I mean he's played clips of me on there even 16 years ago and then earlier this year, multiple times this year.
[00:38:58.028 --> 00:39:04.151]  So technically I've been on the show playing clips but I would like to technically, physically go out there.
[00:39:04.151 --> 00:39:05.192]  That would be fun.
[00:39:05.192 --> 00:39:07.313]  And I'm told behind the scenes Jay's a listener.
[00:39:07.313 --> 00:39:10.114]  But we'll see if that happens because you need to call me up and get me on.
[00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:11.395]  But you know Jay says
[00:39:12.628 --> 00:39:15.971]  To, you know, in the clip, the full clip's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:39:15.971 --> 00:39:19.173]  How about solving problems that brought our country to a halt?
[00:39:19.173 --> 00:39:21.795]  It's also up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:39:21.795 --> 00:39:31.183]  And Obama went on to say, odds of dying in a terrorist attack, a lot lower than dying in a car accident, unfortunately.
[00:39:31.183 --> 00:39:41.892]  And I see what Obama's saying, unfortunately there's hundreds of thousands of car accident deaths a year and not even a hundred terrorist attacks, but they're getting rid of our entire system because they ran the attacks and run Al-Qaeda today.
[00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:45.971]  Just the way it comes off, yes, unfortunately.
[00:39:45.971 --> 00:39:49.451]  Yes, if you could get away with staging some more events, you would.
[00:39:49.451 --> 00:39:55.253]  The problem is, whether it's the underwear bombing or the Boston bombing, we're all watching.
[00:39:55.253 --> 00:39:58.254]  Or whether it's the murder of Michael Heistings, we're all watching.
[00:39:58.254 --> 00:40:06.055]  And, I mean, it's even in the, again, New York Times, CBS News, people going, oh, this has been done because of the NSA spying, you know, to legitimize it.
[00:40:06.055 --> 00:40:08.116]  Because it's as plain as the nose on your face.
[00:40:09.781 --> 00:40:15.323]  But here's Obama, just like yesterday I played for Congressman Paul, former Congressman Paul here on the air, and he called them liars.
[00:40:15.323 --> 00:40:16.363]  I think that's pretty newsworthy.
[00:40:16.363 --> 00:40:20.685]  I think one of my writers ought to write about that.
[00:40:20.685 --> 00:40:26.247]  Ron Paul on the show saying the NSA head is a liar about not spying on Americans.
[00:40:26.247 --> 00:40:28.048]  Because it's on record they do!
[00:40:28.048 --> 00:40:32.169]  But they know you won't go look up the admitted congressional reports.
[00:40:32.169 --> 00:40:37.291]  You won't go look up the Reuters report, now three days old, where they go, okay, it's confirmed.
[00:40:38.847 --> 00:40:42.090]  If you talk about marijuana on the phone, it's given to local police.
[00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:43.451]  It's all being recorded.
[00:40:43.451 --> 00:40:44.892]  It's all totally illegal.
[00:40:44.892 --> 00:40:47.994]  It's all selectively enforced.
[00:40:47.994 --> 00:40:53.578]  And then Obama lies and says, we don't target, we don't spy on Americans.
[00:40:53.578 --> 00:40:54.899]  They don't call it spying.
[00:40:54.899 --> 00:41:00.603]  They call it the definition of a 36-year-old court case that used to just be the address of where communications came from.
[00:41:01.653 --> 00:41:03.874]  And that itself, I believe, is unconstitutional, clearly.
[00:41:03.874 --> 00:41:11.779]  They call you talking, you texting, you emailing, faxing, radio, TV, ham radio.
[00:41:11.779 --> 00:41:16.682]  That's called signals, and that's called metadata to them.
[00:41:16.682 --> 00:41:21.384]  It'd be like if you said, I don't kill elephants, I call that a humph-a-lump.
[00:41:21.384 --> 00:41:22.185]  And you shoot it with a .
[00:41:22.185 --> 00:41:22.205]  .
[00:41:22.205 --> 00:41:22.745]  .
[00:41:22.745 --> 00:41:23.045]  with a .
[00:41:23.045 --> 00:41:23.065]  .
[00:41:23.065 --> 00:41:23.366]  .
[00:41:23.366 --> 00:41:23.566]  you know, .
[00:41:23.566 --> 00:41:23.606]  .
[00:41:23.606 --> 00:41:23.626]  .
[00:41:23.626 --> 00:41:23.646]  .
[00:41:23.646 --> 00:41:23.666]  .
[00:41:23.666 --> 00:41:23.686]  .
[00:41:23.686 --> 00:41:23.706]  .
[00:41:23.706 --> 00:41:23.746]  .
[00:41:23.746 --> 00:41:23.766]  .
[00:41:23.766 --> 00:41:23.786]  .
[00:41:23.786 --> 00:41:23.806]  .
[00:41:23.806 --> 00:41:23.886]  .
[00:41:23.886 --> 00:41:23.906]  .
[00:41:23.906 --> 00:41:23.946]  .
[00:41:23.946 --> 00:41:23.966]  .
[00:41:23.966 --> 00:41:23.986]  .
[00:41:23.986 --> 00:41:24.006]  .
[00:41:24.006 --> 00:41:24.026]  .
[00:41:24.026 --> 00:41:24.046]  .
[00:41:24.046 --> 00:41:24.066]  .
[00:41:24.066 --> 00:41:24.086]  .
[00:41:24.086 --> 00:41:24.106]  .
[00:41:24.106 --> 00:41:24.126]  .
[00:41:24.126 --> 00:41:24.146]  .
[00:41:24.146 --> 00:41:24.166]  .
[00:41:24.166 --> 00:41:24.186]  .
[00:41:24.186 --> 00:41:24.246]  .
[00:41:24.246 --> 00:41:24.306]  .
[00:41:24.306 --> 00:41:24.386]  .
[00:41:24.386 --> 00:41:24.426]  .
[00:41:24.426 --> 00:41:24.446]  .
[00:41:24.446 --> 00:41:24.466]  .
[00:41:24.466 --> 00:41:24.486]  .
[00:41:24.486 --> 00:41:24.506]  .
[00:41:24.506 --> 00:41:24.526]  .
[00:41:24.526 --> 00:41:24.546]  .
[00:41:24.546 --> 00:41:24.566]  .

[00:41:24.586 --> 00:41:24.626]  .
[00:41:24.626 --> 00:41:24.646]  .
[00:41:24.646 --> 00:41:24.726]  .
[00:41:24.726 --> 00:41:24.786]  .
[00:41:24.786 --> 00:41:24.806]  .

[00:41:25.347 --> 00:41:25.367]  .
[00:41:25.367 --> 00:41:25.387]  .
[00:41:25.387 --> 00:41:25.407]  .
[00:41:25.407 --> 00:41:25.427]  .
[00:41:25.427 --> 00:41:25.447]  .

[00:41:25.467 --> 00:41:25.487]  .
[00:41:25.487 --> 00:41:25.507]  .
[00:41:25.507 --> 00:41:25.547]  .
[00:41:25.547 --> 00:41:25.607]  .
[00:41:25.607 --> 00:41:25.647]  .

[00:41:26.447 --> 00:41:26.467]  .

[00:41:26.507 --> 00:41:26.527]  .
[00:41:26.527 --> 00:41:26.587]  .
[00:41:26.587 --> 00:41:26.607]  .
[00:41:26.607 --> 00:41:26.627]  .
[00:41:26.627 --> 00:41:26.647]  .
[00:41:26.647 --> 00:41:26.667]  .
[00:41:26.667 --> 00:41:26.687]  .
[00:41:26.687 --> 00:41:26.727]  .
[00:41:26.727 --> 00:41:26.767]  .
[00:41:26.767 --> 00:41:26.787]  .
[00:41:26.787 --> 00:41:26.807]  .
[00:41:26.807 --> 00:41:26.828]  .
[00:41:26.828 --> 00:41:26.848]  .
[00:41:26.848 --> 00:41:26.868]  .
[00:41:26.868 --> 00:41:26.888]  .
[00:41:26.888 --> 00:41:26.908]  .
[00:41:26.908 --> 00:41:26.968]  .
[00:41:26.968 --> 00:41:27.028]  .
[00:41:27.028 --> 00:41:27.048]  .
[00:41:27.048 --> 00:41:27.068]  .
[00:41:27.068 --> 00:41:27.088]  .
[00:41:27.088 --> 00:41:27.108]  .
[00:41:27.108 --> 00:41:27.128]  .
[00:41:27.128 --> 00:41:27.168]  .
[00:41:27.168 --> 00:41:27.188]  .
[00:41:27.188 --> 00:41:27.208]  .
[00:41:27.208 --> 00:41:27.228]  .
[00:41:27.228 --> 00:41:27.248]  .
[00:41:27.248 --> 00:41:27.268]  .
[00:41:27.268 --> 00:41:27.288]  .
[00:41:27.288 --> 00:41:27.368]  .
[00:41:27.368 --> 00:41:27.428]  .
[00:41:27.428 --> 00:41:27.468]  .
[00:41:27.468 --> 00:41:27.488]  .
[00:41:27.488 --> 00:41:27.508]  . .
[00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:32.203]  Or I call that an Easter Bunny with really big flappy ears.
[00:41:32.203 --> 00:41:34.404]  Or I call that a Hogwart.
[00:41:34.404 --> 00:41:38.747]  I mean, they play all these lawyer games with people.
[00:41:38.747 --> 00:41:49.194]  And they sit there laughing at us, just a big swarm of criminals and corporate mercenaries and foreign lobbyists that can come in and literally
[00:41:50.356 --> 00:41:58.603]  I was seeing different metrics, they vary from the articles I've seen, where you give $1,000, you get $200,000 back in government contracts and subsidies.
[00:41:58.603 --> 00:42:02.886]  You give $100,000, you get a billion dollars in some cases.
[00:42:02.886 --> 00:42:17.638]  I mean, it's just, it is an orgy of robbery and criminality and all of them above the law, just collapse of society, just as former top Secret Service agent Dan Bongino was saying yesterday.
[00:42:19.212 --> 00:42:23.596]  Just, just, he said it's a lawless, criminal, organized crime behind the scenes.
[00:42:23.596 --> 00:42:32.024]  He's been there guarding the president overseas, all these big global conferences with royalty, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, G20.
[00:42:32.024 --> 00:42:38.790]  And he said, you know, I obviously can't get into all the stuff I know, but that's why they're breaking into his house and going after him.
[00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:41.553]  He's running for Congress because he's seen it, folks.
[00:42:41.553 --> 00:42:44.315]  It is total lawless evil.
[00:42:44.315 --> 00:42:45.136]  Okay?
[00:42:47.046 --> 00:42:55.310]  And let's go ahead and go to Obama lying through his teeth to the American people saying we don't spy on you.
[00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:57.271]  I had the programs reviewed.
[00:42:57.271 --> 00:43:07.935]  We put in some additional safeguards to make sure there's federal court oversight as well as congressional oversight that there is no spying on Americans.
[00:43:07.935 --> 00:43:10.176]  We don't have a domestic spying program.
[00:43:10.176 --> 00:43:13.598]  What we do have are some mechanisms where we can track
[00:43:14.758 --> 00:43:15.219]  That's enough.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.543]  So, so, yo, I'm gonna protect you.
[00:43:41.543 --> 00:43:43.566]  I'm your daddy.
[00:43:43.566 --> 00:43:48.593]  What did all these different rap stars come out and say recently?
[00:43:48.593 --> 00:43:53.800]  That he's our father and we should just do whatever he says.
[00:43:55.319 --> 00:44:16.552]  Man, when they start calling somebody the father, they called Mao the father, they called Hitler the father, they called Stalin the father, they called Lenin the father, they called Pol Pot the father, they called Fidel Castro the father, they called Julius Caesar the father, the papa.
[00:44:18.479 --> 00:44:22.623]  Man, I tell you, it is just grade A tyranny.
[00:44:22.623 --> 00:44:35.536]  A bunch of egomaniac people in black uniforms and suits, wearing sunglasses, bugging their eyes out at the public, just strutting around an armed gang, butchering America.
[00:44:35.536 --> 00:44:37.818]  And I cannot stress this enough.
[00:44:37.818 --> 00:44:39.760]  What you see happening in this country,
[00:44:42.382 --> 00:44:47.127]  Is 180 degrees the polar opposite of a free society?
[00:44:47.127 --> 00:44:53.854]  And that is incontrovertible, absolute, 100% fact, and I just said it like an emergency beacon, SOS.
[00:44:57.148 --> 00:44:59.370]  Reactor will self-destruct!
[00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:07.416]  We are following a tyranny pattern that will lead to total collapse and nightmare scenarios of government anarchy!
[00:45:07.416 --> 00:45:08.737]  Rogue government!
[00:45:08.737 --> 00:45:09.718]  Alert!
[00:45:09.718 --> 00:45:10.738]  Danger!
[00:45:10.738 --> 00:45:11.559]  Danger!
[00:45:11.559 --> 00:45:13.701]  Passing fail-safe point!
[00:45:13.701 --> 00:45:18.384]  Approaching event horizon of no turning back!
[00:45:18.384 --> 00:45:19.385]  Alert!
[00:45:19.385 --> 00:45:19.846]  Alert!
[00:45:20.606 --> 00:45:28.957]  Please move to prepare yourselves with firearms, storable foods, friends and family who are aware of the takeover program.
[00:45:28.957 --> 00:45:29.558]  Alert!
[00:45:29.558 --> 00:45:30.519]  Alert!
[00:45:30.519 --> 00:45:36.467]  Do everything you can simultaneously, offensively, to reverse the criminal bloom.
[00:45:37.068 --> 00:45:38.729]  The criminal viral bloom.
[00:45:38.729 --> 00:45:39.310]  Alert!
[00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:39.910]  Alert!
[00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:43.553]  I mean, if America was in a hospital bed, there's doctors, nurses all around.
[00:45:43.553 --> 00:45:45.495]  They're pumping adrenaline into the heart.
[00:45:45.495 --> 00:45:46.736]  I mean, we got Flatline.
[00:45:46.736 --> 00:45:48.857]  I'm sitting there going, we gotta do something!
[00:45:48.857 --> 00:45:49.838]  They're coming in!
[00:45:49.838 --> 00:45:55.102]  I mean, the entire institutions are burning down, like Bongino said yesterday.
[00:45:55.102 --> 00:45:57.104]  I mean, it's all going down right now.
[00:45:57.104 --> 00:45:57.744]  It's burning.
[00:45:57.744 --> 00:45:58.685]  It's blowing.
[00:45:58.685 --> 00:45:59.846]  I mean, the shields are down.
[00:45:59.846 --> 00:46:00.907]  We're overrun.
[00:46:00.907 --> 00:46:02.028]  Everything's on fire!
[00:46:03.294 --> 00:46:09.777]  And then you've got, I mean the walls are falling, the enemy forces are getting ready to roll in, the full operation.
[00:46:09.777 --> 00:46:11.118]  You think it's bad so far?
[00:46:11.118 --> 00:46:12.959]  We've just seen the Vanguard Scouts.
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:19.705]  And then I've got my fellow Americans who are into it, believe in the propaganda, going, bring down the wall!
[00:46:19.705 --> 00:46:21.287]  Stop trying to hold it up!
[00:46:21.287 --> 00:46:24.390]  Alex Jones is bad for saying the NSA shouldn't spy on us!
[00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:25.872]  They're keeping us safe!
[00:46:25.872 --> 00:46:29.896]  They're out there trying to get the wall to drop, the shield to drop.
[00:46:29.896 --> 00:46:34.140]  The shields are just going in and out, man, and they're starting to fall, and they're cheering!
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.402]  We're gonna get our free stuff!
[00:46:35.902 --> 00:46:37.483]  We're going to get all our goodies, folks!
[00:46:37.483 --> 00:46:44.148]  You're not going to get anything but absolute implosion on record, post-industrial society, hell on earth.
[00:46:44.148 --> 00:46:46.469]  And these people are so weak-minded, they're going to love that.
[00:46:46.469 --> 00:46:49.691]  Because all they want to do is imagine that they're winners.
[00:46:49.691 --> 00:46:53.174]  Imagine that they're on a winning team.
[00:46:53.174 --> 00:46:55.395]  We need to put all the governors in FEMA camps for Obama.
[00:46:55.395 --> 00:46:56.696]  Let me sign that thing right now.
[00:46:56.696 --> 00:46:58.077]  Yeah, we need to arrest these Tea Partiers.
[00:46:58.077 --> 00:46:58.878]  Buddy, you don't have to tell me.
[00:47:00.933 --> 00:47:04.660]  Yeah, we're going to take everybody over 70 and euthanize them just before they get sick.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.443]  Well, yeah, I'm almost 70 myself.
[00:47:06.443 --> 00:47:07.686]  I don't want to be alive anymore.
[00:47:07.686 --> 00:47:11.152]  And that's a quote from Mark Dice's last video.
[00:47:11.152 --> 00:47:12.254]  These are real people, folks.
[00:47:12.254 --> 00:47:13.356]  And they're like, yeah, I want to die.
[00:47:14.292 --> 00:47:16.833]  Because they said, for Obama, it's a trance.
[00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:22.855]  It's like mind control, where they tell the woman who's been, you know, hypnotized under drugs and stuff, take your clothes off, you know, have sex with me.
[00:47:22.855 --> 00:47:25.356]  They do it, they don't even remember they did it, folks.
[00:47:25.356 --> 00:47:27.696]  And I'm telling you, the public is in a trance.
[00:47:27.696 --> 00:47:28.917]  It's for Obama.
[00:47:28.917 --> 00:47:30.697]  We're going to put people in FEMA camps.
[00:47:30.697 --> 00:47:31.337]  Absolutely.
[00:47:31.337 --> 00:47:34.038]  Now, you understand, we're going to put them in work camps.
[00:47:34.038 --> 00:47:37.359]  We're going to take the Tea Party to, you know, we're going to arrest them.
[00:47:37.359 --> 00:47:38.940]  Buddy, you ain't got to tell me I want to arrest them.
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.560]  I mean, they're ready, folks.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.141]  They're ready to come for us.
[00:47:44.295 --> 00:47:46.277]  And it is so sick.
[00:47:46.277 --> 00:48:08.273]  I mean, it is like, it is, if you, if the general public knew any basic historical information as in a context, if they had any, any, any upbringing of basic history and common sense, people would understand how just sitting here, staying in this country and not, because all the stuff I've done, believe me, I'm on the top of the list.
[00:48:08.273 --> 00:48:11.596]  The fact that I haven't evacuated is, is a bold act.
[00:48:12.213 --> 00:48:17.617]  But I realize there's nowhere to run long-term, and this is the Great Historical Contest, so I'm very honored to be in this position.
[00:48:17.617 --> 00:48:20.239]  But people need to understand, this is the real deal.
[00:48:20.239 --> 00:48:23.121]  Let's play part of Leno's monologue to analyze it here.
[00:48:23.121 --> 00:48:23.681]  Here it is.
[00:48:23.681 --> 00:48:24.722]  He's getting a little grayer.
[00:48:24.722 --> 00:48:25.522]  Have you noticed that?
[00:48:25.522 --> 00:48:28.585]  In fact, they're starting to call him the Silver Fox.
[00:48:28.585 --> 00:48:30.466]  That's what they're calling him, the Silver Fox.
[00:48:30.466 --> 00:48:33.608]  That's because most of the silver in his hair was caused by fox.
[00:48:33.608 --> 00:48:35.710]  That was the problem.
[00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:36.810]  That's why it's silver.
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:48.001]  President Obama has sent John McCain to Cairo to help solve the political problems that brought the Egyptian government to a halt.
[00:48:48.001 --> 00:48:48.482]  I got an idea.
[00:48:48.482 --> 00:48:50.722]  How about solving the problems that brought our government to a halt?
[00:48:50.722 --> 00:48:52.002]  Why don't we start with that one first?
[00:48:52.002 --> 00:48:57.564]  Yeah, that might be a good idea.
[00:48:57.564 --> 00:48:59.924]  We're meant to be brought down.
[00:48:59.924 --> 00:49:02.505]  By the way, the government's moving forward on many fronts to take our liberties.
[00:49:02.505 --> 00:49:03.405]  We want gridlock.
[00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:12.767]  Under the separation of powers to stop a man on a white horse, a Napoleon Bonaparte, taking control of our society.
[00:49:12.767 --> 00:49:16.930]  I want to take calls for the first 30 minutes of the next hour and cover news.
[00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:22.333]  The toll-free number to join us for first-time callers today on this Wednesday edition, first-time caller Wednesday, 800-259-9231.
[00:49:22.333 --> 00:49:22.553]  800-259-9231.
[00:49:22.553 --> 00:49:23.914]  And we'll also get into Gardasil.
[00:49:31.355 --> 00:49:35.260]  On record, oopsie, we didn't know it sterilized women.
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.023]  Didn't know that?
[00:49:38.023 --> 00:49:42.648]  Be like, again, shooting an elephant with an elephant gun and going, I didn't know it did that.
[00:49:42.648 --> 00:49:47.314]  Be like jumping off a cliff and breaking your legs and going, I didn't know falling 200 feet would do that.
[00:49:48.659 --> 00:49:55.586]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down today as well.
[00:49:55.586 --> 00:50:01.691]  And we're going to look at the post-constitutional America and what that's going to mean for everybody.
[00:50:01.691 --> 00:50:04.194]  And we're also going to look geopolitically.
[00:50:05.629 --> 00:50:20.818]  Some other things are happening but on the NSA front, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has looked at the Reuters story and other admissions by Congress that indeed the DEA and NSA team up to share intelligence leading to secret use of surveillance and ordinary investigations.
[00:50:20.818 --> 00:50:33.365]  Yeah, I didn't need to know about a year ago when they built a building out in the countryside where I live and put up antennas and NSA style scramblers and I saw the type of trucks and vehicles, people that were there and then I asked around
[00:50:34.325 --> 00:50:35.906]  Uh, to a local homeowners association.
[00:50:35.906 --> 00:50:39.689]  They go, oh no, they bypassed the local ordinances.
[00:50:39.689 --> 00:50:41.310]  That's a government front facility.
[00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:44.953]  And then I went a little bit longer and found out it was a DEA connected group.
[00:50:44.953 --> 00:50:49.036]  But yeah, no, I mean, I even have a DEA NSA substation by my house.
[00:50:49.036 --> 00:50:51.478]  I mean, this is just the new America.
[00:50:51.478 --> 00:50:57.322]  A bunch of people with our tax money playing secret agent, bringing down the country, shipping in narcotics.
[00:50:57.322 --> 00:50:58.023]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:58.023 --> 00:50:58.383]  Stay with us.

[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:39.842]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:51:39.842 --> 00:51:40.642]  This capitalism?
[00:51:40.642 --> 00:51:46.803]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:51:46.803 --> 00:51:50.503]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:51:50.503 --> 00:51:51.464]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[00:52:00.345 --> 00:52:05.008]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[00:52:05.008 --> 00:52:10.971]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[00:52:10.971 --> 00:52:12.892]  What is the smartest investment you can make?
[00:52:12.892 --> 00:52:13.533]  It's food.

[00:53:04.267 --> 00:53:05.308]  That bears repeating.

[00:55:22.629 --> 00:55:26.471]  We're not saying it heals cancer, but it's the most powerful.
[00:55:28.584 --> 00:55:30.966]  Yeah, it's the turmeric.

[00:56:23.258 --> 00:56:25.319]  It's hard to try to eat lunch in three-minute breaks.
[00:56:25.319 --> 00:56:27.140]  I just ate a whole bunch of it.
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:36.944]  I'm a peppers and horseradish freak, but I just ate like a huge spoonful of it raw, which I like, but it kind of did something to my throat.
[00:56:36.944 --> 00:56:38.625]  Long story short, you can call 888-789-9277.
[00:56:38.625 --> 00:56:38.685]  888-789-9277.

[00:57:21.296 --> 00:57:25.119]  It takes millions and millions of dollars every year to run this operation.
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:30.003]  And we couldn't do it without your support, so it's a win-win-win, shopping with the good guys.
[00:57:30.003 --> 00:57:31.884]  And we couldn't do it without our AM and FM affiliates.
[00:57:31.884 --> 00:57:46.892]  Please support their local sponsors, or please become a sponsor, whether you're listening, again, in Las Vegas or Southern California, or whether you're listening in Chicago, or whether you're listening in Rochester, New York, or whether you're listening in Austin, Texas, on our over 160 AM and FM affiliates across the country.
[00:57:46.892 --> 00:57:47.293]  Please!
[00:57:47.873 --> 00:57:58.811]  Be sure and support those local sponsors and let them know why they're being supported by you and become a sponsor if you're a local business because that's a big part of this media war is we don't have taxpayer money.
[00:57:59.753 --> 00:58:04.577]  And Pentagon and CIA money like NBC and MSNBC and CNN.
[00:58:04.577 --> 00:58:09.080]  We only have what you support us with by the products supporting our sponsors.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:14.525]  So please click on the sponsors as well at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:14.525 --> 00:58:19.729]  And again, if you hear me endorsing a product on air or on the site, that means I use it and I believe in it.
[00:58:21.101 --> 00:58:34.424]  They have a lot of other great sponsors, too, that are on the network and also on the site, but if I'm not endorsing it, I can't absolutely vouch for it, and that's just something that I always add there, which most advertising outfits that have advertising don't do.
[00:58:34.424 --> 00:58:37.345]  All right, second hour, massively jam-packed with news.

[00:58:50.891 --> 00:58:55.616]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:58:55.616 --> 00:58:58.739]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:58:58.739 --> 00:59:04.305]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:59:04.305 --> 00:59:06.247]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:59:06.247 --> 00:59:07.508]  We are what we eat.
[00:59:08.029 --> 00:59:12.532]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:59:12.532 --> 00:59:16.755]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:59:16.755 --> 00:59:19.317]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:59:19.317 --> 00:59:25.542]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:00:13.665 --> 01:00:17.849]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.849 --> 01:00:21.914]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.938 --> 01:00:33.399]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number two.
[01:00:33.399 --> 01:00:39.641]  We're going to have a special report with Leanne McAdoo and Gigi Arnetta here in studio with us.
[01:00:39.641 --> 01:00:50.004]  Contrasting people that were out protesting and calling for the impeachment of Obama yesterday, part of a big national spontaneous events that were just started on the internet.
[01:00:50.004 --> 01:00:54.946]  By spontaneous, people just spontaneously hear about it and on their own volition go out and do it.
[01:00:56.064 --> 01:00:58.985]  So uncoordinated, I should say, and very successful.
[01:00:58.985 --> 01:01:05.068]  Thousands out in L.A., hundreds out here in Austin at scores of different events throughout the day.
[01:01:05.068 --> 01:01:13.652]  Looking at these people talking versus the majority of Austinites we talk to, if we go to trendy areas, which means mindless TV head idiot areas,
[01:01:14.508 --> 01:01:14.728]  I don't
[01:01:36.904 --> 01:01:38.046]  I mean, we'll play that later.
[01:01:38.046 --> 01:01:42.534]  We're going to get to the Dr. Khalid Mohammed clip since I mentioned it earlier.
[01:01:42.534 --> 01:01:44.978]  I want folks to think I'm making things up.
[01:01:44.978 --> 01:01:48.944]  And then we're going to go to your phone call starting in the next segment.
[01:01:50.202 --> 01:02:03.528]  I was just getting into the prosecutor CPS types that are on my YouTube comments with the headline, Texas town kills two-year-old because parents smoke pot.
[01:02:03.528 --> 01:02:04.109]  And it is.
[01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:05.029]  The town allowed it.
[01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.789]  The government did it.
[01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:07.110]  It was under state care.
[01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:10.572]  Bashed the two-year-old girl's brains out.
[01:02:10.572 --> 01:02:15.234]  And you've got people in there, it's a minority, but they're in there viciously defending her death.
[01:02:15.234 --> 01:02:16.915]  And then you've separately got
[01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:28.319]  These black Israelite types in there who are saying white people are all devils inherently and need to be wiped out and so what, she's a white devil.
[01:02:28.319 --> 01:02:32.162]  I mean, it just shows how all these people are in their own niche.
[01:02:32.162 --> 01:02:34.945]  Government dehumanizes a little girl.
[01:02:34.945 --> 01:02:38.107]  The white supremacist dehumanizes a black person that's killed.
[01:02:38.107 --> 01:02:42.991]  The black supremacist dehumanizes a little white girl.
[01:02:42.991 --> 01:02:44.373]  Because people can't handle the pain.
[01:02:45.447 --> 01:02:49.492]  I mean, I get why they do it.
[01:02:49.492 --> 01:02:53.758]  It's a fool's errand, it's a coward's avenue.
[01:02:53.758 --> 01:03:02.329]  But let's go to Dr. Khalid Mohammed debating Anthony J. Hilder about killing the blue-eyed devils.
[01:03:02.329 --> 01:03:02.690]  Here it is.
[01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:05.411]  Why kill the women in South Africa?
[01:03:05.411 --> 01:03:10.334]  I said kill the women because the women are the military manufacturing center.
[01:03:10.334 --> 01:03:17.038]  And every nine months they lay down on their backs and reinforcement rolls out from between their legs.
[01:03:17.038 --> 01:03:22.521]  So shut down the military manufacturing center by killing the white women.
[01:03:22.521 --> 01:03:24.602]  Why kill the elder crackers?
[01:03:24.602 --> 01:03:25.583]  The old crickets?
[01:03:25.963 --> 01:03:41.395]  Let's turn it off, because he starts getting profane here in a minute.
[01:03:41.395 --> 01:03:52.843]  The whole point is, if anybody knew the real history of South Africa, it was the Dutch and the British and the French all killing each other constantly, getting allied with black tribes.
[01:03:54.179 --> 01:03:58.422]  Uh, and if you went in one of the wrong areas and were white into a white area, they'd kill you.
[01:03:58.422 --> 01:04:01.864]  If you went to one of the wrong black areas, you were black to wrong tribe, they'd kill you.
[01:04:01.864 --> 01:04:03.766]  It's tribalism, folks.
[01:04:03.766 --> 01:04:06.367]  They act like it only comes from white people.
[01:04:06.367 --> 01:04:15.654]  And then you have this vestigial leftover of some of the rich white ruling class that had basically apartheid going on, which was a bad system if you have real equality.
[01:04:15.654 --> 01:04:22.858]  But the point is, now since they got rid of that, South Africa on record has collapsed into mass murder and total bedlam, with the black tribes just killing each other 24-7.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.605]  You're like, what are you saying, go back to apartheid?
[01:04:25.605 --> 01:04:26.187]  No!
[01:04:26.187 --> 01:04:29.759]  But you go out of one bad system into something even worse, run by a bunch of communists!
[01:04:30.981 --> 01:04:40.924]  And of course, it was the big diamond companies and the ultra-rich that wanted to be able to go in to the Dutch and French areas where whites had gone in and set up their own areas.
[01:04:40.924 --> 01:04:43.465]  And they just took all that away and gave it to the big companies.
[01:04:43.465 --> 01:04:45.146]  And now the blacks have no jobs.
[01:04:45.146 --> 01:04:47.607]  I mean, it's on record.
[01:04:47.607 --> 01:04:50.328]  The Rothschilds just came in with De Beers.
[01:04:50.328 --> 01:04:53.949]  They'd already been there forever and just got rid of their white competition.
[01:04:53.949 --> 01:04:55.490]  So, hey, there you go.
[01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:56.010]  Same deal.
[01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:57.530]  Hope you enjoy it.
[01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:58.871]  The blue-eyed devils!

[01:08:05.868 --> 01:08:10.713]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.713 --> 01:08:12.295]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.295 --> 01:08:13.857]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.857 --> 01:08:18.041]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.041 --> 01:08:22.106]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:32.182 --> 01:08:42.592]  Well, all over the country, people are being told at their apartment complexes that you can no longer own guns or any other weapon and are not allowed to defend yourself.
[01:08:42.592 --> 01:08:45.315]  If you defend yourself, you will be thrown out.
[01:08:45.315 --> 01:08:46.656]  And, of course, they're violating our rights.
[01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:54.344]  They've signed up under one contract, and now they're telling them you've got until next week to get out of your apartment if you don't turn your guns in.
[01:08:56.199 --> 01:08:57.801]  Or get your weapons out of your house.
[01:08:57.801 --> 01:09:05.307]  And that's a report up on Infowars.com via News 9 NBC out of Denver.
[01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:07.669]  But this is actually going on all over the country.
[01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:13.613]  Homeowners associations are now retroactively trying to vote that you can't own guns.
[01:09:13.613 --> 01:09:16.155]  And retroactively saying they want to inspect your house.
[01:09:16.155 --> 01:09:25.223]  So the new elitism is to be basically an in-between between a Soviet commissar and a Nazi Gestapo officer.
[01:09:26.058 --> 01:09:33.200]  And so now wealthy country clubs are hiring cops to wear battle gear and stand around with machine guns in front of the country club.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.320]  Just randomly.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.400]  Weddings are doing it.
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.281]  It's like bling.
[01:09:36.281 --> 01:09:40.262]  It's like, look, I got cops in battle gear.
[01:09:40.262 --> 01:09:46.023]  I mean, it's beyond what the hip-hop folks do with the ladies in bikinis dancing around with the bling.
[01:09:47.688 --> 01:09:59.473]  It is just a nation boiling in a fascination with enslavement and insecurity and tyranny in the name of security when it's actually the opposite of security.
[01:09:59.473 --> 01:10:13.559]  And Homeland Security, speaking of that, which is the foreign globalist occupation group here to absorb America, is now putting up billboards and TV ads saying Homeland Security has been criticized over sexy spy ads where they show good-looking women
[01:10:14.688 --> 01:10:17.590]  Uh, reporting on exclusively white people.
[01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:23.053]  It's all minorities reporting, uh, on the devil white.
[01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:28.236]  So, uh, again, they've already said all the brown people are terrorists now, and so now all the white people must be terrorists.
[01:10:28.236 --> 01:10:33.419]  Jack Spratt could eat no, eat no fat.
[01:10:33.419 --> 01:10:34.159]  What's the old quote?
[01:10:34.159 --> 01:10:37.121]  Jack Spratt could eat no fat and his wife could eat no lean.
[01:10:37.121 --> 01:10:39.182]  So in between the two of them, they licked the platter clean.
[01:10:40.546 --> 01:10:43.088]  I mean, basically, that's what they've done here.
[01:10:43.088 --> 01:10:51.194]  It's just, everybody's a terrorist, but the government that publicly runs Al Qaeda worldwide and puts out fake terror alerts and runs drugs on record.
[01:10:51.194 --> 01:10:54.477]  Everybody's bad, but the real terrorist.
[01:10:54.477 --> 01:10:57.339]  But it's okay, because they love us and they want to take good care of us.
[01:10:57.339 --> 01:11:00.541]  So we're going to be taking your phone calls, and I have my reporters in here.
[01:11:00.541 --> 01:11:05.305]  One of them went out yesterday and talked to people about being spied on, and almost all of them.
[01:11:06.112 --> 01:11:10.124]  I said that they loved it and thought it was a great idea to have no rights to be spied on.
[01:11:10.124 --> 01:11:12.049]  That was Liam McAdoo's report.
[01:11:12.049 --> 01:11:13.654]  And then Gigi Ornetta went out.
[01:11:14.742 --> 01:11:16.143]  And did a report.
[01:11:16.143 --> 01:11:27.669]  We heard about these spontaneous people over overpasses with American flags against the NSA and calling for the impeachment of Obama and against the move to take our guns.
[01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:32.092]  Thousands showed up in LA, hundreds in other cities, more than 10 places.
[01:11:32.092 --> 01:11:36.394]  I know of an Austin in two different demonstrations where you'd have 20 people, 10 people.
[01:11:36.394 --> 01:11:39.936]  Still just amazing that that happened spontaneously off the internet.
[01:11:40.976 --> 01:11:43.857]  And these people had the light of liberty in their eyes, they were well-spoken.
[01:11:43.857 --> 01:11:55.521]  Just to contrast the dead eyes of the zombies, just begging to be enslaved and overrun by every form of evil, versus those that are out there standing up for these fools' rights.
[01:11:55.521 --> 01:11:56.681]  Just amazing.
[01:11:56.681 --> 01:12:01.702]  So let's go to your phone calls, though, as promised, right now.
[01:12:01.702 --> 01:12:04.023]  Let's talk to Angelo in New York.
[01:12:04.023 --> 01:12:04.843]  You're on the air.
[01:12:04.843 --> 01:12:06.464]  Welcome.
[01:12:06.464 --> 01:12:08.985]  Hey, Paizan.
[01:12:08.985 --> 01:12:10.045]  I'm calling from New York.
[01:12:10.906 --> 01:12:20.493]  And, uh, wow, a lot of crazy things are going on in New York, Alex, and, uh, watching your show on YouTube woke me up to a lot of it.
[01:12:20.493 --> 01:12:28.078]  And when I tried to explain this to a lot of my friends and family, they're just like in la-la land.
[01:12:28.078 --> 01:12:30.199]  And I think it's, I figured out why.
[01:12:30.199 --> 01:12:38.745]  I mean, I went to nyc.gov and I realized all the sodium fluoride that they're putting in our water and
[01:12:40.752 --> 01:12:50.596]  And if you go to their website and you look it up, you'll notice how they explain everything to us on how it's supposedly supposed to be good for you.
[01:12:50.596 --> 01:12:58.539]  But little do they know, they don't show containers of the big skulls on the sodium fluoride that they're supposed to be labeling.
[01:12:58.539 --> 01:13:00.979]  They don't show that on their website.
[01:13:00.979 --> 01:13:04.521]  And we're also having a major prescription drug problem in New York.
[01:13:04.521 --> 01:13:07.382]  Everybody's like in La La Land.
[01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:10.403]  And a lot of people I know are dying from prescription drugs.
[01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:13.552]  I've been to a few funerals in the past few years.
[01:13:13.552 --> 01:13:16.975]  It's a huge police state.
[01:13:16.975 --> 01:13:21.879]  They're pulling over everybody, especially near midtown Manhattan.
[01:13:21.879 --> 01:13:27.604]  It's just like, I feel like I'm going through Germany in the late 30s.
[01:13:27.604 --> 01:13:37.732]  Searching through my stuff, stopping my bike, shutting my bike, putting gloves on, about to hit me, police.
[01:13:37.732 --> 01:13:39.534]  It's just horrible what's going on.
[01:13:40.535 --> 01:13:44.097]  A lot of people aren't aware about what's going on.
[01:13:44.097 --> 01:13:49.900]  I would say more people that are aware of it are the people who have access to the internet.
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:58.044]  So a lot of older people don't have access to the internet and they don't know what's really going on because they're watching Fox and CNN.
[01:13:58.044 --> 01:14:02.827]  But I have experienced so many different crazy things that are going on in New York right now.
[01:14:02.827 --> 01:14:08.790]  And I think that InfoWars should be on every newsstand in New York.
[01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:13.292]  Every newsstand, InfoWars, should be there.
[01:14:13.292 --> 01:14:17.375]  Whatever we have to do, Alex, to get it out there, we have to do it.
[01:14:17.375 --> 01:14:20.696]  Well, that's why I put out the magazine and have a plan to try to syndicate it.
[01:14:20.696 --> 01:14:25.639]  I just don't have the money, the infrastructure, or the managerial talent to properly do it.
[01:14:25.639 --> 01:14:27.120]  But we've got a pretty good team overall.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.321]  We're trying to do it.
[01:14:28.321 --> 01:14:31.003]  We just are doing so many things.
[01:14:31.003 --> 01:14:34.565]  Developing the TV show with all these stations already lined up to pick it up.
[01:14:35.485 --> 01:14:47.054]  I'm trying to finish the Obama Deception 2, doing the Daily Show, dealing with the collapse of just general society and people's mental health just around us.
[01:14:47.054 --> 01:14:51.437]  All of us are fighting as hard as we can, brother, and God bless you, and I appreciate you calling.
[01:14:51.437 --> 01:14:53.459]  Good to hear from you, Angela.
[01:14:53.459 --> 01:14:57.262]  Since you mentioned the fluoride in the water, they knew in the
[01:14:59.232 --> 01:15:08.702]  The 1800s, they had studies on what fluoride that got into water supplies was doing, that it was brain damaging people and also making them docile.
[01:15:09.394 --> 01:15:14.237]  And then they got University of Texas studies from the 20s, you can pull up, that it lowered IQ, made people docile.
[01:15:14.237 --> 01:15:20.480]  The Soviets, starting in the 20s, started putting it in the water in work camps, and that's in Pulitzer Prize winning books, you can look it up.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:26.363]  Hitler got that from them, he put it in his work camps, not his death camps, in his work camps.
[01:15:26.363 --> 01:15:29.144]  They put, what was it, three parts per million in it.
[01:15:29.144 --> 01:15:32.006]  But that made them too sluggish, so they went down to 1.6.
[01:15:32.006 --> 01:15:35.928]  We have the Nazi model of it put in our water, on record!
[01:15:37.085 --> 01:15:40.726]  And the average person just can't deal with that.
[01:15:40.726 --> 01:15:55.669]  So then, last year, a Harvard study comes out, looking at 24 studies, including some of their own, over the last several decades, and said, wow, it lowers women's IQ 17 points if you just drink this water for 10 years as a child.
[01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:59.010]  And it lowers men, I think it was 23 points, so I just say 20 points.
[01:15:59.010 --> 01:15:59.870]  That averages together.
[01:16:00.988 --> 01:16:03.391]  And massive cancer increases.
[01:16:03.391 --> 01:16:05.553]  I mean, look at the public.
[01:16:05.553 --> 01:16:06.074]  Look at us all.
[01:16:06.074 --> 01:16:08.236]  We're all ugly compared to our grandparents and parents.
[01:16:08.236 --> 01:16:10.939]  I mean, my dad looked like a movie star.
[01:16:10.939 --> 01:16:12.580]  My mom looked like a movie star.
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:19.748]  I mean, I look pretty good talking a little bit older, but I look ragged and drugged out and ugly and old, even though I try to eat non-GMO and all the rest of it.
[01:16:19.748 --> 01:16:21.049]  I mean, we're walking dead, folks.
[01:16:22.921 --> 01:16:24.042]  I mean, look at my grandparents.
[01:16:24.042 --> 01:16:25.343]  They look like movie stars.
[01:16:25.343 --> 01:16:26.304]  Look at old photos.
[01:16:26.304 --> 01:16:29.126]  Even just average people just looked really healthy.
[01:16:29.126 --> 01:16:30.106]  They ate like pigs.
[01:16:30.106 --> 01:16:30.947]  They smoked cigarettes.
[01:16:30.947 --> 01:16:32.148]  They drank like fish.
[01:16:32.148 --> 01:16:34.129]  You know, most people do, and they look great.
[01:16:34.129 --> 01:16:36.391]  You go look at the French who don't eat GMO.
[01:16:36.391 --> 01:16:39.293]  I mean, they smoke two, three packs of cigarettes, drink constantly.
[01:16:39.293 --> 01:16:41.395]  You have hundreds of sexual partners.
[01:16:41.395 --> 01:16:44.717]  They live on average, it's like almost a decade longer than Americans.
[01:16:44.717 --> 01:16:46.839]  We are being murdered, folks.
[01:16:46.839 --> 01:16:48.340]  We are the model.
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:49.041]  Okay?
[01:16:49.041 --> 01:16:52.003]  Everybody needs to understand that.
[01:16:52.003 --> 01:16:52.143]  And
[01:16:53.997 --> 01:16:57.001]  This is the type of society we're in.
[01:16:57.001 --> 01:17:06.932]  The rats they feed, GMO, in every case, within three generations, are almost completely sterile, deformed with tumors all over them.
[01:17:06.932 --> 01:17:09.735]  And it doesn't matter what GMO they feed rats, it doesn't.
[01:17:09.735 --> 01:17:11.237]  Because it's designed, folks.
[01:17:11.237 --> 01:17:14.561]  We're only a generation into this, and people are dying all over the place.
[01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:26.718]  And so that's what's so frustrating, and it's what's so stupid about, you know, you'll run into feds or something with sunglasses on and trench coats, bugging their eyes out, like you're supposed to be scared of an earpiece, and them acting offensive.
[01:17:26.718 --> 01:17:29.019]  It's like, dude, you're walking dead, bro.
[01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:31.682]  You're in the same club as I'm in, walking dead.
[01:17:31.682 --> 01:17:38.587]  I mean, you're under a total scientific attack, and you're playing along, you know, in dress-up here.
[01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:42.450]  Like you're protecting us from some terror threat when it's publicly run by your bosses.
[01:17:44.466 --> 01:17:46.410]  That's why, I mean, I'm not even worried, folks.
[01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:55.186]  It's like there's a reactor leak, we gotta fix it, or all of us are dead, basically, as a society.
[01:17:55.186 --> 01:17:56.509]  I'll use the Star Trek analogy.
[01:17:58.615 --> 01:18:10.583]  For people that can't get a historical comparison, the reactor's leaking, the Enterprise isn't going to escape, Khan detonating the weapon system, and somebody's got to go in there and fix it or nobody's going to make it.
[01:18:10.583 --> 01:18:13.385]  I mean, this is guaranteed pure evil.
[01:18:13.385 --> 01:18:22.811]  If you don't believe in Satan, I don't know what planet you're living on, folks, because this is a pure, diabolical, total evil program run out of Europe and the United States.
[01:18:22.811 --> 01:18:24.612]  America and Europe aren't doing it.
[01:18:24.612 --> 01:18:28.495]  We were the most powerful host to have the organism grow in it.
[01:18:30.699 --> 01:18:36.609]  And so it's 100% fact that the city of Austin, where I no longer live, our offices are here,
[01:18:38.035 --> 01:18:41.356]  Puts weaponized levels of fluoride in the water.
[01:18:41.356 --> 01:18:45.196]  One part, 1.6 parts per million.
[01:18:45.196 --> 01:18:56.618]  Even though the government under lawsuits, when their own scientists rebelled, near unanimously, thousands of their toxicologists and scientists last year, sent a letter saying, you gotta take it out, cancer, death, you gotta get the fluoride out.
[01:18:56.618 --> 01:19:04.960]  The feds went, okay, we'll recommend if cities want, they can cut to 0.7 part per million, or cut it in half, basically.
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:05.640]  None of them did it.
[01:19:06.721 --> 01:19:11.083]  They know full well, they told them seven years ago, don't give babies fluoride water.
[01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:13.585]  But you see ads everywhere, your baby needs fluoride, folks.
[01:19:13.585 --> 01:19:16.567]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:19:16.567 --> 01:19:17.127]  Okay?
[01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:23.070]  They are murdering you and your family, and they think it's funny, and they think it's cute, and they think it's fun.
[01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:33.016]  And if you go to the Austin City Council or any other city council, they'll sit there like fat, degenerate, murderous pigs, and put a chemical weapon in the water.
[01:19:34.571 --> 01:19:36.874]  And they all drink filtered water, and they all eat non-GMO.
[01:19:36.874 --> 01:19:37.575]  They know what they're doing.
[01:19:37.575 --> 01:19:38.697]  They're part of the club, folks.
[01:19:38.697 --> 01:19:39.678]  They've been brought into the club.
[01:19:39.678 --> 01:19:40.540]  They know.
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:41.882]  You have to understand that.
[01:19:41.882 --> 01:19:46.729]  That's why they laugh, even when we bring scientists, Harvard and other scientists there, to tell them.
[01:19:46.729 --> 01:19:48.171]  They laugh because they know!
[01:19:48.171 --> 01:19:49.773]  They're like, ha ha ha ha!
[01:19:49.773 --> 01:19:50.174]  No!
[01:19:50.174 --> 01:19:50.594]  Ha ha!

[01:22:01.226 --> 01:22:02.226]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:02.226 --> 01:22:07.747]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:07.747 --> 01:22:08.288]  I get it.
[01:22:08.288 --> 01:22:17.890]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:17.890 --> 01:22:19.290]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:19.290 --> 01:22:27.732]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:27.732 --> 01:22:28.972]  If all looks rosy to you,
[01:22:29.212 --> 01:22:31.113]  Then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:35.356]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:35.356 --> 01:22:36.957]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:36.957 --> 01:22:40.920]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:44.703]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:44.703 --> 01:22:45.624]  You should, too.

[01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:04.931]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[01:23:04.931 --> 01:23:10.873]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[01:23:10.873 --> 01:23:12.794]  What is the smartest investment you can make?
[01:23:12.794 --> 01:23:13.434]  It's food.

[01:24:02.138 --> 01:24:07.961]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:07.961 --> 01:24:11.523]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:11.523 --> 01:24:18.548]  Alright, I gotta stop ranting and go to your phone calls.
[01:24:20.171 --> 01:24:47.151]  It's just that Bertrand Russell, Aldous Huxley, Julian Huxley, the head of the UN program at UNESCO, Secretary General of UNESCO, the current White House Science Czar, John P. Holdren, I mean, I've read hundreds of quotes and statements by these people in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, right through to now, saying, yeah, we're going to put stuff in vaccines to make people more pliable,
[01:24:48.044 --> 01:25:02.291]  And we're going to put things in the water supply so that they're not as fertile, so they don't live as long in the long age, late age, where they deplete the social network.
[01:25:02.291 --> 01:25:06.053]  And that's why you get so-called liberals on the news going, yeah, let's kill grandma.
[01:25:06.053 --> 01:25:08.694]  Let's not give her all the treatment we've paid into.
[01:25:08.694 --> 01:25:10.074]  That's the collectivism.
[01:25:10.074 --> 01:25:12.896]  You get the young, self-centered, authoritarian liberal.
[01:25:13.715 --> 01:25:15.197]  He's not even a liberal!
[01:25:15.197 --> 01:25:16.678]  And they're like, yeah, let's kill all people!
[01:25:16.678 --> 01:25:18.560]  I want, I want what they get!
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:23.546]  As if the globalists are gonna give you anything, you moron!
[01:25:23.546 --> 01:25:26.529]  You're just in the domestication phase before slaughter, stupid!
[01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:31.691]  These are organized criminals who know what they're doing.
[01:25:31.691 --> 01:25:42.178]  And now the word's gone down even to the city levels, I've confirmed, with a lot of their operatives, mayors and others, who have actually been brought in on the plan and are going along with it.
[01:25:42.178 --> 01:25:45.500]  And the rationale is we're doing it for the earth, we're going to reduce population.
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:54.026]  The human group is a disease, we've got to get it under control, as Prince Philip and as Prince Charles have both said publicly.
[01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:56.531]  Don't believe me?
[01:25:56.531 --> 01:26:01.359]  Just type in Prince Charles says we should reduce population with a bioweapon.
[01:26:01.359 --> 01:26:03.703]  For Prince Charles.
[01:26:03.703 --> 01:26:05.706]  And so they're just stunning us right now.
[01:26:07.571 --> 01:26:15.853]  Kind of like you humanely electrocute, you know, now they send high voltage into a sheep's brain to knock it out before they butcher them over under EU rules.
[01:26:15.853 --> 01:26:18.414]  You can pull up those videos of them doing that.
[01:26:18.414 --> 01:26:20.894]  Don't pull it up for viewers, but people can see it if they want to see it.
[01:26:20.894 --> 01:26:22.034]  And that's kind of what's happening now.
[01:26:22.034 --> 01:26:28.136]  We're being humanely stunned, in their own words, ahead of the bioweapon being released.
[01:26:30.438 --> 01:26:32.639]  Let's go to Rob.
[01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:34.179]  Rob in Pennsylvania.
[01:26:34.179 --> 01:26:34.839]  You're on the air.
[01:26:34.839 --> 01:26:35.079]  Go ahead.
[01:26:35.079 --> 01:26:37.320]  Then we'll go to Habib and others.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.861]  Go ahead.
[01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:39.381]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:39.381 --> 01:26:40.901]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:26:40.901 --> 01:26:41.841]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:41.841 --> 01:26:43.622]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:26:43.622 --> 01:26:46.763]  I've been listening for about a year now, and I want to thank you for waking me up.
[01:26:48.002 --> 01:27:01.153]  Um, about, this would have been in 2002, early 2003, I was working as a paramedic firefighter in Baltimore, and we took a gentleman to the hospital who was quite obvious he was either FBI or CIA.
[01:27:01.153 --> 01:27:05.116]  There's a lot of the complexes down there around Baltimore Airport.
[01:27:05.116 --> 01:27:11.401]  He was dying, he was having a heart attack, and you could tell the look of death was in his eyes.
[01:27:11.401 --> 01:27:15.284]  And he told me he'd done terrible things to people who were innocent.
[01:27:15.737 --> 01:27:17.238]  Had died because of things he did.
[01:27:17.238 --> 01:27:19.461]  I shocked him.
[01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:26.107]  I brought him back to life and he said he saw terrible things and he said that he was afraid that it's too late.
[01:27:26.107 --> 01:27:26.927]  This is back then.
[01:27:26.927 --> 01:27:31.892]  I think perhaps we've slowed things down, but I'm calling to urge.
[01:27:31.892 --> 01:27:36.736]  Firefighters in Los Angeles Police Police Department in Los Angeles.
[01:27:36.736 --> 01:27:40.240]  All these people who know something need to come forward so we can stop this.
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:43.421]  Specifically, what was he saying?
[01:27:43.421 --> 01:27:46.763]  They were going to plan some big stage terror attack?
[01:27:46.763 --> 01:27:54.589]  He didn't go into specifics, but at the time, this was status post, the whole Anthrax type deal.
[01:27:54.589 --> 01:27:58.391]  I think that's what he was kind of hinting at, but he would not go into specifics.
[01:27:58.391 --> 01:27:58.851]  Well, who knows?
[01:27:58.851 --> 01:27:59.672]  They might have poisoned him.
[01:27:59.672 --> 01:28:00.452]  He might have been dying.
[01:28:00.452 --> 01:28:01.793]  He might have known that too.
[01:28:01.793 --> 01:28:05.196]  Yeah, but those guys always, when they get ready to die, they start begging Jesus.
[01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:15.352]  Especially when they've been shocked back to life, because a lot of times they see some really bad stuff if they've flown into the bad side of the universe.
[01:28:15.352 --> 01:28:19.273]  Is that what you saw in his eyes when you brought him back to life?
[01:28:19.273 --> 01:28:20.873]  He'd gone to the bad place?
[01:28:20.873 --> 01:28:26.274]  The amazing thing with heart attacks, when people die, when their heart dies, their mind does not.
[01:28:26.274 --> 01:28:35.457]  Numerous people I've shocked back to life told me that they could feel the whole thing happening, they could hear me, they could hear the chaos.
[01:28:36.261 --> 01:28:37.661]  And they could feel that power.
[01:28:37.661 --> 01:28:45.763]  I'm not a religious person, but that in itself has always made me think that perhaps there is something else.
[01:28:45.763 --> 01:28:51.324]  Sure, well, the scientists try to make it up and say, oh, well, it must just be some ancestral programming or memory.
[01:28:51.324 --> 01:28:54.125]  But it's more every culture has the same experience.
[01:28:54.125 --> 01:28:57.085]  Bad people go to hell with all these other horrible people.
[01:28:57.085 --> 01:28:58.486]  You're basically with all their spirits.
[01:28:58.486 --> 01:29:02.206]  That's what hell is, is being with all the other bad people like yourself.
[01:29:02.206 --> 01:29:04.527]  Or they go in and it's just white throne.
[01:29:05.407 --> 01:29:08.448]  Absolute peace and timelessness.
[01:29:08.448 --> 01:29:13.170]  And then I've talked to so many people, soldiers, police, you name it, who are particularly good.
[01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:16.171]  The whole deal, the angels there that go, you're being sent back.
[01:29:16.171 --> 01:29:17.772]  They're giving the data download.
[01:29:17.772 --> 01:29:18.392]  It's incredible.
[01:29:18.392 --> 01:29:19.933]  It's so real.
[01:29:19.933 --> 01:29:21.453]  And I've had my own private experiences.
[01:29:21.453 --> 01:29:24.195]  I won't talk about on air because they'd make an issue out of it in the news.
[01:29:24.195 --> 01:29:25.575]  But let me tell you, folks, it's real.
[01:29:25.575 --> 01:29:26.135]  There is a heaven.
[01:29:26.135 --> 01:29:27.196]  There is a hell.
[01:29:27.196 --> 01:29:27.856]  There are demons.
[01:29:27.856 --> 01:29:28.536]  There are angels.
[01:29:28.536 --> 01:29:29.657]  It's all real.
[01:29:29.657 --> 01:29:32.718]  And I just really feel sorry for people that have served evil because they're going to go to hell.
[01:29:34.722 --> 01:29:37.625]  And anything else you want to add, sir?
[01:29:37.625 --> 01:29:38.165]  Yeah, I do.
[01:29:38.165 --> 01:29:38.766]  Well, stay there.
[01:29:38.766 --> 01:29:39.586]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:29:39.586 --> 01:29:42.069]  We're going to get our reporters in here and have them do a report.
[01:29:42.069 --> 01:29:44.551]  Then we'll go to all the other callers that are there as well.
[01:29:44.551 --> 01:29:50.456]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.456 --> 01:29:51.837]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.837 --> 01:29:54.379]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.379 --> 01:29:57.062]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:17.382]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[01:30:17.802 --> 01:30:20.084]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.

[01:31:01.052 --> 01:31:05.736]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[01:31:05.736 --> 01:31:11.700]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:13.621]  What is the smartest investment you can make?
[01:31:13.621 --> 01:31:14.242]  It's food.

[01:32:00.957 --> 01:32:05.679]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[01:32:05.679 --> 01:32:06.880]  Why do we have the highest
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:14.346]  Cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:32:14.346 --> 01:32:16.288]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:32:16.288 --> 01:32:17.909]  We are what we eat.
[01:32:17.909 --> 01:32:22.593]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:32:22.593 --> 01:32:26.816]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:32:26.816 --> 01:32:29.078]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:32:29.358 --> 01:32:35.586]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:33:16.186 --> 01:33:20.355]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:25.683 --> 01:33:45.661]  Colonel Craig Roberts, a good friend of mine, I've known him for about 16 years, was in Vietnam as a Marine Corps sniper, then he was in the Army, then he was a Police Department helicopter pilot, SWAT team leader, and he died for 10 minutes, and had the whole experience where he went up to heaven, the angel that had been there his whole life with it,
[01:33:46.581 --> 01:33:49.703]  That he never seen but his imaginary friend when he was a kid.
[01:33:49.703 --> 01:33:52.044]  That feeling of somebody's watching him was right there.
[01:33:52.044 --> 01:33:54.085]  He was given all this information, sent back.
[01:33:54.085 --> 01:33:54.985]  People laugh at that.
[01:33:54.985 --> 01:33:58.827]  Whether you believe that's real or not, that's the deeper human psyche.
[01:33:58.827 --> 01:34:00.728]  That's what's going on.
[01:34:00.728 --> 01:34:09.332]  And we were talking to a paramedic, Rob, who I'm going to let finish up and then we're going to go to this very important report with our two reporters here in studio.
[01:34:10.526 --> 01:34:14.409]  To finish the other point you were trying to make, but first off, so you shock him back to life.
[01:34:14.409 --> 01:34:16.111]  He says, I've done horrible things.
[01:34:16.111 --> 01:34:17.372]  Horrible things are going to happen.
[01:34:17.372 --> 01:34:22.836]  I guess he was mentioning something about anthrax attacks or whatever, and that he'd done bad things.
[01:34:22.836 --> 01:34:24.858]  And then I guess innocent people have been killed.
[01:34:24.858 --> 01:34:26.900]  And we know that was a federal operation.
[01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:27.841]  It's now come out.
[01:34:27.841 --> 01:34:29.982]  They even killed a patsy over it.
[01:34:29.982 --> 01:34:34.867]  But, and that's a whole other subject for folks that want to look into it, but that was done to get the Patriot Act passed.
[01:34:35.467 --> 01:34:41.493]  But did he say anything else before he finally died again and were you unable to shock him alive again?
[01:34:41.493 --> 01:34:45.436]  No, actually we got him back and he was doing fine.
[01:34:45.436 --> 01:34:48.319]  I went and spoke to him in his hospital room later that day.
[01:34:48.319 --> 01:34:49.139]  Okay, so he didn't die.
[01:34:49.139 --> 01:34:51.582]  You're saying you had death on him and you brought him back.
[01:34:51.582 --> 01:34:52.282]  Okay.
[01:34:52.282 --> 01:34:53.884]  Yeah, we had death on his face.
[01:34:53.884 --> 01:34:55.345]  We brought him back.
[01:34:55.345 --> 01:34:57.647]  He was touch and go there for a while.
[01:34:57.647 --> 01:35:00.430]  I believe, if I remember correctly, they either did angio or
[01:35:01.371 --> 01:35:03.892]  One of the procedures that they did back then for that.
[01:35:03.892 --> 01:35:05.392]  But no, he survived.
[01:35:05.392 --> 01:35:13.894]  And I tell you, I hold hope that he remembered that experience and he did something to change the wrongs that he did.
[01:35:13.894 --> 01:35:18.075]  What specifically did he say about, about I did horrible things?
[01:35:18.075 --> 01:35:23.016]  I mean, it sounded like you were warning that he was saying there might be a terror attack, that they were behind it.
[01:35:23.016 --> 01:35:25.756]  I mean, what was he getting at specifically?
[01:35:25.756 --> 01:35:28.117]  It wasn't any of the specific things that he said.
[01:35:28.117 --> 01:35:28.517]  It was just
[01:35:29.301 --> 01:35:32.844]  Well, back then I wasn't as weak as I am now.
[01:35:32.844 --> 01:35:42.352]  So, you see people like this, they're dying, they have guilt, but you're there to treat the patient and not the psyche.
[01:35:42.352 --> 01:35:45.414]  So, you kind of try to comfort the patient.
[01:35:45.414 --> 01:35:47.236]  Yeah, it's going to be okay.
[01:35:47.236 --> 01:35:48.037]  I've done training.
[01:35:48.037 --> 01:35:48.797]  I know how to do this.
[01:35:48.797 --> 01:35:49.978]  I can do it.
[01:35:49.978 --> 01:35:51.660]  I just need you to calm down, relax.
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:54.462]  We're going to go through this step-by-step, and I'm going to help you get better.
[01:35:55.297 --> 01:35:59.881]  But as far as going to anything further, I wasn't awake at the time.
[01:35:59.881 --> 01:36:10.669]  Our department was pretty busy with the anthrax scares, but something in my mind connected the two.
[01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:11.149]  Absolutely.
[01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:14.712]  What was the other point you wanted to make?
[01:36:14.712 --> 01:36:15.873]  Let's roll 2013.
[01:36:15.873 --> 01:36:16.733]  A peaceful rally.
[01:36:16.733 --> 01:36:21.677]  It's going to be held nationwide and locally throughout the United States to try to bring back the Constitution.
[01:36:22.498 --> 01:36:25.744]  And I was just trying to get a plug so we can get our numbers up.
[01:36:25.744 --> 01:36:28.890]  I saw the overpasses for Obama and that's great too.
[01:36:28.890 --> 01:36:32.798]  But I think this fall is the chance we have to save this country.
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.861]  I agree with you and it's good to hear from you.
[01:36:35.861 --> 01:36:38.422]  I appreciate you calling into the broadcast.
[01:36:38.422 --> 01:36:43.845]  Now, shifting gears, this dovetails with what the caller was just talking about.
[01:36:43.845 --> 01:36:52.669]  One of my reporters yesterday was out and saw people doing overpass banner hangs, return the Constitution, come and take it, defend the Second Amendment.
[01:36:53.329 --> 01:36:55.290]  Impeach Obama for NSA spying.
[01:36:55.290 --> 01:36:56.731]  Restore the Fourth Amendment.
[01:36:56.731 --> 01:36:59.712]  And it turned out these were all over town and at the Capitol.
[01:36:59.712 --> 01:37:03.514]  10, 20, 30 people depending on which spontaneous event it was.
[01:37:03.514 --> 01:37:08.036]  And by spontaneous, people just heard the call on Facebook all over the country.
[01:37:08.036 --> 01:37:12.878]  There were thousands in LA, hundreds in other cities, but thousands at one spot in Los Angeles.
[01:37:12.878 --> 01:37:15.479]  There's going to be more in the next few days.
[01:37:15.479 --> 01:37:21.142]  And I was watching the nightly news last night from home, a rebroadcast of it, because it was restreaming.
[01:37:22.697 --> 01:37:35.620]  And I saw Gigi Arnett's report, we're going to get to secondarily, where the people were so electric, so alive, why they were out there, why they just heard the call to go and stand for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:38.660]  America's in trouble.
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:47.742]  And then I watched the next piece where Leanne McAdoo went out and the majority of people she talked to in Austin
[01:37:48.559 --> 01:37:50.120]  Said, I want to be spied on.
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:53.403]  I want to have my rights taken.
[01:37:53.403 --> 01:38:03.031]  So first we're going to get to Leanne McAdoo's report and then compare that to the type of people that want freedom.
[01:38:03.031 --> 01:38:06.073]  And if you're a radio listener, you can hear how pathetic these people are.
[01:38:06.073 --> 01:38:06.974]  It's very sad.
[01:38:06.974 --> 01:38:12.919]  But to see them, to see the weakness in their eyes and that they're scared and they go, oh, I like being spied on.
[01:38:12.919 --> 01:38:14.940]  They know full well this is tyranny.
[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:16.902]  But they just think they're going to appease it.
[01:38:17.932 --> 01:38:31.056]  Well, when liberty fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, and those that cry to appease appease are hung by those they tried to please, to quote an old Revolutionary War statement said by an unknown person.
[01:38:31.056 --> 01:38:33.477]  Let's go ahead and go to this first report.
[01:38:33.477 --> 01:38:35.017]  Surprise, surprise.
[01:38:35.017 --> 01:38:41.679]  It turns out the NSA has been using your information for a lot more than just fighting international terrorism.
[01:38:41.679 --> 01:38:45.460]  Has your wife ever cooked anything in a pressure cooker?
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:46.701]  Yes.
[01:38:46.701 --> 01:38:46.881]  Yes.
[01:38:48.001 --> 01:38:49.221]  Yes.
[01:38:49.221 --> 01:38:56.803]  Um, I personally have not, but like I said, my mom is really into pressure cooker recipes.
[01:38:56.803 --> 01:38:58.144]  Is she a terrorist?
[01:38:58.144 --> 01:38:58.924]  No.
[01:38:58.924 --> 01:39:00.364]  No?
[01:39:00.364 --> 01:39:00.804]  Are you sure?
[01:39:00.804 --> 01:39:03.345]  Yeah.
[01:39:03.345 --> 01:39:05.885]  No, very, very much not a terrorist.
[01:39:05.885 --> 01:39:07.726]  At one time the wife had looked up
[01:39:08.663 --> 01:39:09.304]  Sure, I have nothing to hide.
[01:39:09.304 --> 01:39:10.645]  They can question me all they want.
[01:39:29.167 --> 01:39:37.892]  I'm sure it's an effort to keep us all safe and hopefully that was cleared up pretty easily with a few good answers.
[01:39:37.892 --> 01:39:44.676]  If you don't have anything to hide, then you shouldn't be scared of anything.
[01:39:44.676 --> 01:39:49.858]  I don't do no provocative searches anyway.
[01:39:49.858 --> 01:39:57.663]  How do you feel about the NSA logging all your Google searches and sometimes supplying that to local police?
[01:39:57.663 --> 01:39:57.863]  Good.
[01:39:58.598 --> 01:40:01.281]  You feel good about that?
[01:40:01.281 --> 01:40:03.903]  You don't think that that's entrapment?
[01:40:03.903 --> 01:40:07.066]  It's bad.
[01:40:07.066 --> 01:40:08.187]  Have you been drinking today?
[01:40:08.187 --> 01:40:09.949]  No.
[01:40:09.949 --> 01:40:14.073]  So you're comfortable with the NSA collecting your innocuous Google searches?
[01:40:14.073 --> 01:40:15.494]  I am.
[01:40:15.494 --> 01:40:17.536]  Everyone's okay with it.
[01:40:17.536 --> 01:40:19.358]  They're like, I like being spied on.
[01:40:19.358 --> 01:40:20.278]  It is cool.
[01:40:20.278 --> 01:40:22.521]  Honestly, we need to be safe.
[01:40:23.254 --> 01:40:25.276]  For the InfoWars Nightly News, I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[01:40:49.218 --> 01:40:59.945]  with Gigi's report here where she went out to the spontaneous rallies to impeach Obama that happened nationwide here in Austin and the people she talked to.
[01:40:59.945 --> 01:41:01.326]  Here's that report.
[01:41:01.326 --> 01:41:13.814]  I'm Gigi Ornette reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News and we're standing here on an overpass at Maynard Drive in Austin, Texas where people are honking for Obama's impeachment.
[01:41:13.814 --> 01:41:15.595]  So what gave you guys this idea?
[01:41:16.325 --> 01:41:17.626]  This is a national movement.
[01:41:17.626 --> 01:41:21.209]  It was started by James Neighbors, who's up in Oklahoma.
[01:41:21.209 --> 01:41:25.093]  We now have, we've got groups like this in all 50 states.
[01:41:25.093 --> 01:41:35.582]  And yeah, we're just out here trying to raise people's awareness a little bit and get them woken up to what's going on with the Obama administration and try to get him out of office.
[01:41:36.081 --> 01:41:39.466]  So you believe that these are definitely not phony scandals?
[01:41:39.466 --> 01:41:40.347]  Definitely not.
[01:41:40.347 --> 01:41:42.470]  They're felonies, you know?
[01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:46.575]  And we elect these folks to govern us, but not to rule us.
[01:41:46.575 --> 01:41:48.958]  And we have a constitution to limit the federal government's...
[01:41:50.267 --> 01:41:59.170]  I want to know how many people are out there that would like to be doing something.
[01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:00.030]  They get frustrated.
[01:42:00.030 --> 01:42:05.752]  They say, well, I'm going to do something tomorrow and I'm going to do something today.
[01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:07.653]  Something that's going to count.
[01:42:07.653 --> 01:42:13.495]  You know, you got to get out of the, from behind the computer and go out and try to get some things done.
[01:42:14.093 --> 01:42:17.715]  We're in a neighborhood where people actually told us, oh no, you don't want to go out there.
[01:42:17.715 --> 01:42:20.657]  There are too many people for Obama out there.
[01:42:20.657 --> 01:42:24.039]  But we're getting a great response and we're going to stay out here as long as we can.
[01:42:24.039 --> 01:42:25.720]  I'm going to be out here every chance I get.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.221]  I took off work for this today.
[01:42:27.221 --> 01:42:30.743]  I mean, I'd take off work if I was sick or if I had a sick child.
[01:42:31.664 --> 01:42:32.925]  The Republic's sick.
[01:42:32.925 --> 01:42:34.166]  It needs help.
[01:42:34.166 --> 01:42:35.427]  That's what I'm here for.
[01:42:35.427 --> 01:42:39.149]  One group near Los Angeles has 1,780 people.
[01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:41.711]  1,780 people.
[01:42:41.711 --> 01:42:42.471]  That's incredible.
[01:42:42.471 --> 01:42:43.352]  One group.
[01:42:43.352 --> 01:42:48.495]  And if you go to overpasses.org, you can find out more information about the event they're having August 17th.
[01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:50.136]  Get out and help.
[01:42:50.136 --> 01:42:52.898]  Help change what's happening to our Constitution.
[01:42:52.898 --> 01:42:56.460]  I'm Gigi Ornette reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:57.501]  Alright, that's Gigi Ornette.
[01:42:57.501 --> 01:42:58.201]  Good job there.
[01:43:00.214 --> 01:43:08.760]  Everywhere on the sitcoms, the dramas, Miss USA, you name it, they are pushing that we're safe if we're spied on.
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:12.582]  And here's a clip from Miss USA pageant this year.
[01:43:12.582 --> 01:43:13.783]  This is just one of them.
[01:43:13.783 --> 01:43:16.685]  And they told them, to win, you go out and say you want to be spied on.
[01:43:16.685 --> 01:43:20.427]  Remember a few years ago, a lady said she wanted liberty and didn't want the Patriot Act?
[01:43:20.427 --> 01:43:22.289]  So they said, oh, she lost.
[01:43:22.289 --> 01:43:25.291]  She was runner up because she said she wanted freedom.
[01:43:25.911 --> 01:43:27.813]  That's why they all say, I want you in!
[01:43:27.813 --> 01:43:28.954]  I love the government!
[01:43:28.954 --> 01:43:30.455]  I want world government!
[01:43:30.455 --> 01:43:33.899]  It's an agenda they're pushing!
[01:43:33.899 --> 01:43:34.639]  Okay?
[01:43:34.639 --> 01:43:38.483]  So listen to this mindlessness right here.
[01:43:38.483 --> 01:43:42.126]  Government tracking of phone records has been in the news lately.
[01:43:42.126 --> 01:43:46.751]  Is this an invasion of privacy or necessary to keep our country safe?
[01:43:46.751 --> 01:43:47.952]  Why or why not?
[01:43:47.952 --> 01:43:48.553]  Miss Alabama.
[01:43:49.361 --> 01:43:57.084]  I think the society that we live in today, it's sad that if we go to the movies, or to the airport, or even to the mall, that we have to worry about our safety.
[01:43:57.084 --> 01:44:07.008]  So I would rather someone track my telephone messages and feel safe wherever I go, than feel like they're encroaching on my privacy.
[01:44:08.929 --> 01:44:10.510]  And again, thank you!
[01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:14.192]  She doesn't want to believe that the government could be criminal interests that took over.
[01:44:14.192 --> 01:44:17.153]  She doesn't want to believe they run Al-Qaeda when it's on record.
[01:44:17.153 --> 01:44:28.540]  I mean, I had Obama's senior, former head of Foreign Operations for the Secret Service, with thousands of people under him, on air saying, yeah, the President's involved with Al-Qaeda, yeah, it's staged, I think these are fake terror alerts.
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:29.981]  He even said more off-air.
[01:44:29.981 --> 01:44:31.822]  Because it's the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:33.032 --> 01:44:34.573]  Here's the final clip I want to play.
[01:44:34.573 --> 01:44:35.694]  Here's Chris Rock.
[01:44:35.694 --> 01:44:36.494]  The same attitude.
[01:44:36.494 --> 01:44:39.036]  Obama is our daddy.
[01:44:39.036 --> 01:44:40.937]  And you do what your daddy says.
[01:44:40.937 --> 01:44:41.598]  Here it is.
[01:44:41.598 --> 01:44:46.101]  So, you know, the president and the first lady are kind of like the mom and the dad of the country.
[01:44:46.101 --> 01:44:46.961]  That's right.
[01:44:46.961 --> 01:44:47.622]  She's my mama, too.
[01:44:47.622 --> 01:44:51.064]  When your dad says something, you listen.
[01:44:51.064 --> 01:44:53.706]  And when you don't, it usually bites you in the ass later on.
[01:44:53.706 --> 01:44:59.710]  So I'm here to support the president.
[01:44:59.710 --> 01:44:59.990]  Thank you.
[01:45:00.592 --> 01:45:06.236]  You know, it's funny, and they all look pleased when he says that, spoken like a good cult follower.
[01:45:06.236 --> 01:45:17.445]  My dad is named David R. Jones, and his father was named Jerry R. Jones, and then he had a dad named Dad Ross was the nickname.
[01:45:17.445 --> 01:45:19.506]  I don't even know my great-grandfather's name.
[01:45:19.506 --> 01:45:20.627]  I should know that on that side of the family.
[01:45:20.627 --> 01:45:22.408]  And that was Dad Ross.
[01:45:22.408 --> 01:45:23.429]  I mean, I didn't know Obama.
[01:45:26.345 --> 01:45:29.448]  I thought my mother was Carol Jones.
[01:45:29.448 --> 01:45:33.373]  I didn't know that my mother was Michelle Obama.
[01:45:33.373 --> 01:45:37.417]  But I guess I go to restaurants now and there's little cards about she's telling me what to eat.
[01:45:37.417 --> 01:45:42.122]  My kids were going to private school and it was curriculum from her as well because it was accredited.
[01:45:44.264 --> 01:45:45.844]  So I guess they're full-time homeschooled now.
[01:45:45.844 --> 01:45:49.105]  You just can't get away from our mama and our daddy.
[01:45:49.105 --> 01:45:51.346]  Let's go to our reporters here.
[01:45:51.346 --> 01:45:53.246]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, your report first.
[01:45:53.246 --> 01:45:56.947]  And we're going to play a few that disagreed tonight, but they were the vast minority.
[01:45:56.947 --> 01:46:01.729]  I'm told out of 10 people you talked to, two said, no, we have rights.
[01:46:01.729 --> 01:46:06.210]  I mean, my God, these people, don't they understand that North Korea is like this?
[01:46:06.210 --> 01:46:06.670]  Exactly.
[01:46:06.670 --> 01:46:07.470]  I was shocked.
[01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:10.291]  They were literally zombies out there.
[01:46:10.291 --> 01:46:12.212]  And they were like, we got to be safe.
[01:46:12.212 --> 01:46:12.952]  We need to be safe.
[01:46:13.692 --> 01:46:16.618]  And I said, well, don't you feel like that's an invasion of your privacy?
[01:46:16.618 --> 01:46:18.301]  Don't you feel like that's entrapment?
[01:46:18.301 --> 01:46:19.824]  Well, we got to be safe.
[01:46:19.824 --> 01:46:21.848]  And Obama himself said,
[01:46:22.884 --> 01:46:26.767]  You know, you're not going to get hit by a terrorist more than a car accident.
[01:46:26.767 --> 01:46:33.711]  But we don't have a domestic spying program, you know, and that's what they don't... Well, Miss Alabama's like, it's so dangerous now.
[01:46:33.711 --> 01:46:35.833]  What, honeybees that kill 200 and something people?
[01:46:35.833 --> 01:46:37.114]  Terrorists less than 100?
[01:46:37.114 --> 01:46:38.815]  What, it's so dangerous with guns?
[01:46:38.815 --> 01:46:39.996]  Gun crimes down 61%?
[01:46:39.996 --> 01:46:47.761]  Oh, it's so... No, they create the perception like a child thinking a boogeyman's under the table because the babysitter shows him Halloween.
[01:46:48.121 --> 01:46:49.522]  It ain't real, folks!
[01:46:49.522 --> 01:46:51.164]  The threat's the government!
[01:46:51.164 --> 01:47:00.952]  Exactly, and I asked the older gentleman who said, you know, his wife cooks with pressure cooker all the time, and I said, will you be okay if they came and kicked down your door like they did with this family?
[01:47:00.952 --> 01:47:06.136]  He said, well, you know, I'm sure we could get it all solved with a, you know, just by answering a few of their questions.
[01:47:06.136 --> 01:47:07.357]  Yeah, let them come in with a SWAT team.
[01:47:08.775 --> 01:47:10.077]  Sheeple come out.
[01:47:10.077 --> 01:47:11.078]  That's what it was like.
[01:47:11.078 --> 01:47:11.399]  It was amazing.
[01:47:11.399 --> 01:47:14.543]  People came out and as I was leaving, people were actually showing up that you knew
[01:47:26.298 --> 01:47:29.201]  Just by, you could tell, they were like, well, should I be out here?
[01:47:29.201 --> 01:47:30.341]  But they came out anyway.
[01:47:30.341 --> 01:47:33.624]  And we were up on an overpass where you had to go quite a ways up.
[01:47:33.624 --> 01:47:35.846]  It's a pedestrian overpass to get there.
[01:47:35.846 --> 01:47:37.607]  And you could just see the intensity.
[01:47:37.607 --> 01:47:41.370]  And the people that I interviewed were so passionate about being there.
[01:47:41.370 --> 01:47:44.993]  And they were encouraging and telling people, you know, it's just not about... They're alive!
[01:47:44.993 --> 01:47:45.814]  Yeah, they're alive.
[01:47:45.814 --> 01:47:46.875]  It made me more alive.
[01:47:46.875 --> 01:47:49.657]  It was 104 and I came in and I was ready to do it again.
[01:47:49.657 --> 01:47:50.858]  And that's what they were saying.
[01:47:50.858 --> 01:47:52.199]  I think they said 106 yesterday.
[01:47:52.199 --> 01:47:52.840]  Yeah, it was hot.
[01:47:53.752 --> 01:47:59.776]  But, and Wendy, but it was great because as we were doing the interview, and there's more to it, where we were standing there, people were honking their horns.
[01:47:59.776 --> 01:48:02.157]  People were driving by and honking in the middle of the interviews.
[01:48:02.157 --> 01:48:09.601]  They were just, you know, they had signs that said, impeach Obama, get your, and I'm not going to say the word, donkey out of the White House.
[01:48:09.601 --> 01:48:10.642]  You know, don't spy on me.
[01:48:10.642 --> 01:48:15.025]  They had all these signs all down the overpass, all the way across the overpass.
[01:48:15.025 --> 01:48:16.445]  It was pretty intense.
[01:48:16.445 --> 01:48:17.966]  It was pretty intense.
[01:48:17.966 --> 01:48:21.949]  Well, just the contrast between the two people.
[01:48:21.949 --> 01:48:22.229]  Oh, yeah.
[01:48:23.541 --> 01:48:24.902]  That's why I wanted to get you guys in here today.
[01:48:24.902 --> 01:48:28.104]  It was the contrast on the nightly news of these two different groups of people.
[01:48:28.104 --> 01:48:31.747]  And then you see the folks out in California when Mark dies.
[01:48:31.747 --> 01:48:33.468]  We've also been out there interviewing people.
[01:48:33.468 --> 01:48:38.171]  If you say, for Obama, we're going to put everybody that owns guns in a concentration camp for Obama.
[01:48:38.171 --> 01:48:40.353]  We're going to kill Jews for Obama.
[01:48:40.353 --> 01:48:43.255]  They'll say anything if it's for Obama.
[01:48:43.255 --> 01:48:44.696]  That's like mind control.
[01:48:45.458 --> 01:48:46.138]  Well, absolutely.
[01:48:46.138 --> 01:48:56.384]  And the weird thing is I've been out to some of these zombies before on other reports and it really, it makes me nervous because it's like they're in a trance on some kind of medication.
[01:48:56.384 --> 01:48:57.544]  They're not all there.
[01:48:57.544 --> 01:48:59.986]  And then when I went out to this, I didn't know what to expect.
[01:48:59.986 --> 01:49:01.046]  The people were alive.
[01:49:01.046 --> 01:49:01.867]  It made me excited.
[01:49:02.307 --> 01:49:03.808]  We need to defend the Constitution.
[01:49:03.808 --> 01:49:04.708]  We're standing up.
[01:49:04.708 --> 01:49:08.129]  And they had, I don't know if you saw, but they had armbands.
[01:49:08.129 --> 01:49:13.571]  And without, you know, looking at it, you think, well, hmm, could, you know, reminded me of something weird, so I asked.
[01:49:13.571 --> 01:49:20.313]  But it was for SEAL Team 6 that they were wearing armbands, because I felt like... Oh, it's good to bring that out, that they clearly killed them, yeah.
[01:49:20.313 --> 01:49:21.793]  And they want us to... Well, what do the SEALs think?
[01:49:21.793 --> 01:49:24.434]  They're not going to be sent on a fake Bin Laden raid and not be killed.
[01:49:24.434 --> 01:49:25.775]  They're going to get rid of you.
[01:49:25.775 --> 01:49:26.395]  Right.
[01:49:26.395 --> 01:49:28.215]  You can't be part of this and not be killed.
[01:49:28.215 --> 01:49:29.656]  But that's part of the phony scandal.
[01:49:30.342 --> 01:49:31.242]  You know, that's what Obama said.
[01:49:31.242 --> 01:49:33.404]  Oh, Jake Harney said so!
[01:49:33.404 --> 01:49:36.085]  Who's a known admitted liar?
[01:49:36.085 --> 01:49:42.488]  Well, that's why they're so scared of the people that are awake and alive and who are trying to rally together and make some changes.
[01:49:42.488 --> 01:49:43.949]  They like the zombies.
[01:49:44.534 --> 01:49:46.035]  Well, I've thrown a lot of points out here.
[01:49:46.035 --> 01:49:48.397]  Great job on the reports and with the Nightly News crew.
[01:49:48.397 --> 01:49:49.538]  There's going to be more tonight.
[01:49:49.538 --> 01:49:55.804]  But I want to send you guys back out, both of you now, and Jakari and everybody else out there to then challenge him.
[01:49:55.804 --> 01:49:59.947]  I'm going to write some questions up and then say, so you support what they did in Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany.
[01:49:59.947 --> 01:50:01.388]  Why was it different there?
[01:50:01.388 --> 01:50:03.450]  Okay, well, this is illegal.
[01:50:03.450 --> 01:50:05.252]  Obama says they're not doing it, but they are.
[01:50:06.445 --> 01:50:07.786]  And really challenge him.
[01:50:07.786 --> 01:50:09.607]  I want to just say, what's wrong with you?
[01:50:09.607 --> 01:50:10.327]  To these people.
[01:50:10.327 --> 01:50:11.868]  Ask him to bring the truth.
[01:50:11.868 --> 01:50:12.868]  The truth.
[01:50:12.868 --> 01:50:16.890]  Well, I mean, I would ask him, why do you seem so glaze-eyed?
[01:50:16.890 --> 01:50:19.351]  Okay, I'd gladly do that.
[01:50:19.351 --> 01:50:22.092]  Now, the one older guy, you could tell he was scared, just wanting to comply.
[01:50:22.092 --> 01:50:23.673]  Like, I'll do whatever you say.
[01:50:23.673 --> 01:50:26.775]  You know, I think, you know, the Fuhrer's good.
[01:50:26.775 --> 01:50:30.917]  I mean, it's basically that attitude of, I'll do whatever I'm told, just leave me alone.
[01:50:30.917 --> 01:50:32.057]  Right, kick my door down.
[01:50:32.057 --> 01:50:35.539]  Don't they get the tyrants want to dominate you and take your wealth?
[01:50:37.079 --> 01:50:40.322]  The fact that you lay down to them, that's what makes them run over you.
[01:50:40.322 --> 01:50:42.163]  Well, they don't understand that.
[01:50:42.163 --> 01:50:45.886]  But they are going to do this again on the 17th of August, all across the United States.
[01:50:45.886 --> 01:50:49.169]  So if they go to overpasses.org, they can find out more about it.
[01:50:49.169 --> 01:50:52.672]  Yeah, we should get the director of that on, and we should watch things like this as well.
[01:50:52.672 --> 01:50:55.334]  I mean, this is what it's all about.
[01:50:55.334 --> 01:50:57.315]  And will this one operation save us?
[01:50:57.315 --> 01:50:59.978]  No, but everything together, the resistance will.
[01:51:01.274 --> 01:51:03.935]  Can you go without a good meal for three days?

[01:53:08.161 --> 01:53:11.722]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[01:53:11.722 --> 01:53:18.124]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.

[01:54:11.636 --> 01:54:19.343]  The cancer rates in children went up 10,000% because the government loves me.
[01:54:19.343 --> 01:54:24.687]  I take the shots and have a convulsion.
[01:54:24.687 --> 01:54:29.772]  I give my child a shot, they never talk again.
[01:54:29.772 --> 01:54:33.755]  Thank you, New World Order.
[01:54:33.755 --> 01:54:36.077]  Thank you for the gifts.
[01:54:37.267 --> 01:54:41.069]  You are my cupcake, Obama.
[01:54:41.069 --> 01:54:43.710]  I love you.
[01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:45.891]  You're so trendy.
[01:54:45.891 --> 01:54:51.354]  I like it when you bomb third world countries.
[01:54:51.354 --> 01:54:52.035]  Oh, man.
[01:54:52.035 --> 01:54:53.615]  That's a pretty song.
[01:55:11.408 --> 01:55:13.489]  The English Army.
[01:55:13.489 --> 01:55:19.091]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:19.091 --> 01:55:32.457]  That's right, I just had to look, I couldn't turn away.
[01:55:32.457 --> 01:55:35.679]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:55:35.679 --> 01:55:40.541]  Ladies and gentlemen, Don Salazar is about to break some big news.
[01:55:42.534 --> 01:55:45.556]  Because he's gone to the courthouse, gotten the affidavits, court records.
[01:55:45.556 --> 01:55:55.525]  You know that little girl, Alexandria Hill, who got her brains bashed out a few months after she was taken because the father got ratted out for smoking marijuana late at night while watching movies with his wife?
[01:55:55.525 --> 01:55:58.247]  I mean, of course you gotta take a child for that.
[01:55:58.247 --> 01:56:10.217]  Turns out, the foster parents, the male foster parent, it's the woman who's been arrested for reportedly bashing the brains out, a little two-year-old, Alexandria,
[01:56:11.502 --> 01:56:16.944]  Turns out he has multiple convictions for being a drug dealer.
[01:56:16.944 --> 01:56:22.245]  So if you smoke a joint watching a movie, we're going to take your kids and give them to people that look like trolls.
[01:56:22.245 --> 01:56:28.127]  And the little girl's going to get beat up and have black eyes and her hair falling out, and the state's going to not help.
[01:56:28.127 --> 01:56:29.347]  They know what they're doing.
[01:56:29.347 --> 01:56:32.388]  And then when they kill her, well, that's just somebody else to throw in the prison.
[01:56:32.388 --> 01:56:37.450]  But they're going to hand your kids over to people with drug convictions.
[01:56:39.798 --> 01:56:43.619]  Drug Dealing Convict... TWO Drug Dealing Convictions!
[01:56:43.619 --> 01:56:46.060]  Not one, but TWO!
[01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:53.103]  And of course all the prosecutors and bad cops that are on the YouTube video defending it... You people are sick!
[01:56:53.103 --> 01:56:55.104]  And I'm just going to give you some bad news, okay?
[01:56:55.104 --> 01:56:57.084]  Bad news for you.
[01:56:57.084 --> 01:56:58.565]  All this evil is going to come back on you.
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:01.841]  And I've had bad cops go, what is that, a threat?
[01:57:01.841 --> 01:57:03.561]  And I go, no, dummy.
[01:57:03.561 --> 01:57:08.683]  If you had any spirit, you'd know that when you do bad stuff, man, you're not God-fearing.
[01:57:08.683 --> 01:57:16.966]  It's not that I even want to do bad things, but I just think about bad things just to analyze them, and I just think about how bad that is and how I don't want to be part of that.
[01:57:16.966 --> 01:57:19.527]  It's called God-fearing.
[01:57:19.527 --> 01:57:25.549]  And you people do not have any bearing, you don't have any mooring, any rudder, any compass, any north star.
[01:57:25.549 --> 01:57:27.950]  You do not have any conscience.
[01:57:29.349 --> 01:57:32.793]  And you just think whatever's good for you must be good for everybody.
[01:57:32.793 --> 01:57:37.319]  So if you want to steal from people or you want to cheat and you want to rationalize, that's okay.
[01:57:39.164 --> 01:57:40.885]  And it goes for the general public as well.
[01:57:40.885 --> 01:57:44.808]  I mean, television is nothing but a demonic society now.
[01:57:44.808 --> 01:57:48.570]  I'm going to come back, go to calls, and then G. Edward Griffin's going to be on.
[01:57:48.570 --> 01:57:50.672]  Ed Aved wants to get his country back.
[01:57:50.672 --> 01:57:52.313]  Anthony wants to talk about sodium fluoride.
[01:57:52.313 --> 01:57:54.554]  Brad wants to talk about Christians.
[01:57:54.554 --> 01:57:56.916]  Daryl wants to talk about Talker's Magazine.
[01:57:56.916 --> 01:57:58.257]  Comey wants to talk about solutions.

[01:57:59.178 --> 01:58:00.919]  Some of you will be talking to G. Edward Griffin.
[01:58:00.919 --> 01:58:01.399]  So stay there.
[01:58:01.399 --> 01:58:03.841]  I want to get to everybody that I just mentioned and more.

[01:58:51.332 --> 01:58:55.195]  Are we choosing our own destiny, or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:58:55.195 --> 01:59:00.720]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:08.446]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:59:08.446 --> 01:59:10.488]  From compulsory state education,
[01:59:10.768 --> 01:59:13.551]  To the Hollywood media brainwashing machine.
[01:59:13.551 --> 01:59:17.754]  We are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:59:17.754 --> 01:59:24.941]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:59:24.941 --> 01:59:27.983]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:59:27.983 --> 01:59:33.729]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand.
[01:59:34.349 --> 01:59:35.029]  A war.
[01:59:35.029 --> 01:59:36.350]  Oh, there's another one!
[01:59:36.350 --> 01:59:37.610]  Another plane just hit!
[01:59:37.610 --> 01:59:38.690]  State of Mind.
[01:59:38.690 --> 01:59:40.330]  Because there's a war on.
[01:59:40.330 --> 01:59:41.291]  Or your mind.
[01:59:41.291 --> 01:59:45.472]  Get your copy of State of Mind the movie at InfoWars.com.
[01:59:45.472 --> 01:59:50.553]  And remember, every order at InfoWarsStore.com receives a free citizen rulebook.
[02:00:06.004 --> 02:00:10.805]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.805 --> 02:00:12.405]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.405 --> 02:00:14.326]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.326 --> 02:00:18.147]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.147 --> 02:00:23.828]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.828 --> 02:00:27.369]  Alright, folks, we're into hour number three.
[02:00:27.369 --> 02:00:28.329]  Jim McGriffin's coming up.
[02:00:28.329 --> 02:00:30.109]  We'll continue with your phone calls.
[02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:32.090]  Brad in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:00:32.090 --> 02:00:32.850]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:32.850 --> 02:00:33.150]  Welcome.
[02:00:34.378 --> 02:00:34.978]  Hello, Alex.
[02:00:34.978 --> 02:00:35.619]  Are you there?
[02:00:35.619 --> 02:00:37.039]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:37.039 --> 02:00:37.700]  Hey, buddy.
[02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:40.981]  I got a few things I want to talk to you about.
[02:00:40.981 --> 02:00:44.303]  First of all, I'm a first-time caller.
[02:00:44.303 --> 02:00:46.304]  I've been listening to you for about a year and a half now.
[02:00:46.304 --> 02:00:47.364]  I love what you do.
[02:00:47.364 --> 02:00:49.345]  You're totally awesome.
[02:00:49.345 --> 02:00:53.007]  Hey, but I need some advice from you, Alex.
[02:00:53.007 --> 02:00:55.348]  Go ahead.
[02:00:55.348 --> 02:00:59.850]  You always say on how our government ships in all these drugs.
[02:00:59.850 --> 02:01:03.892]  And these drugs, I live in Detroit, just south of Detroit in the suburbs.
[02:01:04.964 --> 02:01:07.065]  And, uh, I mean, they're everywhere.
[02:01:07.065 --> 02:01:09.047]  I mean, Alex, it's so bad.
[02:01:09.047 --> 02:01:18.433]  You walk into these gas stations and pay for your gas, and they got these glass cabinets right next to the cash register with crack pipes in them.
[02:01:18.433 --> 02:01:25.578]  You know, heroin needles, cocaine grinders, anything you need to abuse these drugs.
[02:01:25.578 --> 02:01:31.281]  My brother put a shotgun in his mouth about 15 years ago due to cocaine.
[02:01:31.281 --> 02:01:33.523]  I got a 21-year-old stepson right now.
[02:01:34.096 --> 02:01:36.257]  That's so addicted to heroin, Alex.
[02:01:36.257 --> 02:01:38.018]  It makes me want to cry, man.
[02:01:38.018 --> 02:01:40.199]  I mean, he's... it's horrible.
[02:01:40.199 --> 02:01:41.840]  He's died three times.
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:42.920]  He can go out, Alex.
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:43.981]  He can go outside.
[02:01:43.981 --> 02:01:45.802]  He'll be broke.
[02:01:45.802 --> 02:01:47.442]  And grab my lawnmower.
[02:01:47.442 --> 02:01:50.644]  And run down the street and cut a lawn for 15 bucks.
[02:01:50.644 --> 02:01:53.945]  And run down the other end of the street and get heroin.
[02:01:53.945 --> 02:01:56.727]  I know, and our troops publicly grow it.
[02:01:57.641 --> 02:02:00.803]  And they've had congressional hearings admitting most of the drugs were brought in by our government.
[02:02:00.803 --> 02:02:03.584]  Everybody else has to pay 7 to 15 percent.
[02:02:03.584 --> 02:02:10.627]  That is so well known, that even in the movie Two Guns, you have to pay the CIA 7 percent to bring cocaine in.
[02:02:10.627 --> 02:02:18.011]  I mean, it's just publicly known, and it's a tax on everybody, and it's destroying our society.
[02:02:18.011 --> 02:02:19.832]  And then they use it to destroy our Bill of Rights.
[02:02:20.772 --> 02:02:23.195]  And it's just totally evil.
[02:02:23.195 --> 02:02:32.124]  And you've got to start young with kids explaining drugs are dirty, they're bad, they're stupid, they're not sexy like the media says, like the hip-hop rappers and rock and roll people say.
[02:02:32.124 --> 02:02:36.408]  You've got to keep them away from it.
[02:02:36.408 --> 02:02:42.114]  And then all that money from all the stolen goods and the yards they mow doesn't go to the big banks.
[02:02:43.123 --> 02:02:48.224]  And the big banks all publicly launder the drugs, run the drug aircraft, ship the guns.
[02:02:48.224 --> 02:02:50.985]  The aircraft then run the kidnapped people as well.
[02:02:50.985 --> 02:02:52.185]  That's come out.
[02:02:52.185 --> 02:02:56.706]  The Wells Fargo, Wachovia planes, the Rendition flights.
[02:02:56.706 --> 02:03:02.568]  I mean, it's just the only reason this has happened is the public is so naive, so childlike.
[02:03:02.568 --> 02:03:03.528]  They have no idea.
[02:03:04.088 --> 02:03:07.493]  That we have absolute demons running the country.
[02:03:07.493 --> 02:03:08.815]  It's bigger than Obama.
[02:03:08.815 --> 02:03:14.303]  He's just meant to make it trendy to get everybody to go along with the next phase, the full collapse of the country.
[02:03:14.303 --> 02:03:17.487]  And I'm so sorry to hear about what's happening.
[02:03:17.487 --> 02:03:18.649]  I mean, you want advice?
[02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:24.161]  You know, I don't know what to say.
[02:03:24.161 --> 02:03:29.441]  Look, they put fluoride in the water to brain damage the kids and destroy your fertility.
[02:03:29.441 --> 02:03:32.802]  Gardasil, on record, reduces fertility, sterilizes a lot of people.
[02:03:32.802 --> 02:03:33.402]  We knew that.
[02:03:33.402 --> 02:03:34.462]  That was in the trials.
[02:03:34.462 --> 02:03:36.063]  Now it's confirmed in a new study.
[02:03:36.063 --> 02:03:37.783]  I mean, they're killing us.
[02:03:37.783 --> 02:03:38.663]  They're killing us.
[02:03:38.663 --> 02:03:39.363]  They enjoy it.
[02:03:39.363 --> 02:03:41.864]  They make money while they murder us.
[02:03:41.864 --> 02:03:43.744]  Imagine wanting to brain damage children.
[02:03:43.744 --> 02:03:46.665]  Imagine wanting to take 20, 30 years off their life.
[02:03:46.665 --> 02:03:48.525]  Imagine wanting to make them where they can't have kids.
[02:03:49.833 --> 02:03:53.297]  Of course they ship drugs into your town.
[02:03:53.297 --> 02:03:58.041]  I mean the cops are so corrupt in Detroit now they're running around robbing everybody publicly.
[02:03:58.041 --> 02:04:01.004]  And I mean this is the future for all of America.
[02:04:01.004 --> 02:04:06.670]  I mean we are in judgment because you know who's going to save the 53 million babies that have been aborted?
[02:04:06.670 --> 02:04:08.872]  The people that lie to themselves and say it's not a human.
[02:04:08.872 --> 02:04:09.953]  Well then you're not a human.
[02:04:09.953 --> 02:04:10.754]  I'm not a human either.
[02:04:11.448 --> 02:04:18.278]  You see, I mean, the globalists only think they're human and all of us are basically a sandwich on the table to be eaten.
[02:04:18.278 --> 02:04:19.760]  Well, I'm not their food.
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:23.725]  But we have to stop acting like sheep and start acting like men, brother.
[02:04:23.725 --> 02:04:25.528]  What advice did you want?
[02:04:26.544 --> 02:04:28.784]  Well, like, I'm in the trenches out here.
[02:04:28.784 --> 02:04:33.545]  I'm a truck driver, and you're talking about control.
[02:04:33.545 --> 02:04:35.646]  They got this Qualcomm in these trucks.
[02:04:35.646 --> 02:04:38.366]  They tell us when to eat, when to drive, when to sleep.
[02:04:38.366 --> 02:04:40.506]  I know, and soon they'll get rid of you with robots.
[02:04:40.506 --> 02:04:41.147]  Absolutely.
[02:04:41.147 --> 02:04:43.247]  Oh my God.
[02:04:43.247 --> 02:04:50.828]  And every week I work like 70 hours a week, and I make like $1,200 a week, and they take $350 of that for that.
[02:04:50.828 --> 02:04:54.729]  And the cops pull you over, giving you tickets for no reason, bankrupting you, correct?
[02:04:55.790 --> 02:04:56.271]  Correct.
[02:04:56.271 --> 02:04:57.974]  I am barely surviving.
[02:04:57.974 --> 02:04:59.217]  Everything you say is true.
[02:04:59.217 --> 02:05:00.339]  Hold on, I'll come back to you in a moment.
[02:05:02.188 --> 02:05:09.954]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[02:05:09.954 --> 02:05:14.197]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[02:07:11.274 --> 02:07:17.658]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[02:07:18.058 --> 02:07:20.360]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.

[02:08:13.140 --> 02:08:17.481]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:08:17.481 --> 02:08:29.065]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:29.065 --> 02:08:31.406]  We're all riders on the storm.
[02:08:31.406 --> 02:08:33.886]  Riders on the storm.
[02:08:33.886 --> 02:08:36.047]  Into this world we're thrown, folks.
[02:08:36.047 --> 02:08:38.188]  Riders on the storm.
[02:08:38.188 --> 02:08:40.448]  To this world we're born.
[02:08:40.448 --> 02:08:42.109]  Into this house we're born.
[02:08:46.403 --> 02:08:48.164]  You know, there's a killer on the road.
[02:08:48.164 --> 02:08:56.628]  And if you give this man a ride, we will surely die.
[02:08:56.628 --> 02:08:58.429]  Well, we've given tyranny a ride.
[02:08:58.429 --> 02:09:01.310]  It's actually driving the car now.
[02:09:03.803 --> 02:09:05.625]  And a lot of you are under Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:09:05.625 --> 02:09:09.308]  You're going to think if you appease the killer, he's going to be nice to you.
[02:09:09.308 --> 02:09:15.413]  No, he's going to take you to a basement and torture you for a very long time, politically, physically.
[02:09:15.413 --> 02:09:18.835]  Because when you let the bad people get control, what do you expect is going to happen?
[02:09:18.835 --> 02:09:19.576]  They're always there.
[02:09:19.576 --> 02:09:21.498]  They always crave control.
[02:09:21.498 --> 02:09:25.641]  I wanted to finish up with a truck driver caller who wanted to ask me some advice.
[02:09:25.641 --> 02:09:28.583]  We're getting on the line right now, an amazing guest, G. Edward Griffin.
[02:09:29.417 --> 02:09:36.940]  And I want to get his current prognosis on the Republic and all the revelations that really confirm everything we've said and where he sees things going in the future.
[02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:42.663]  Best-selling author of The Creature from Jekyll Island, Exposing the Federal Reserve, and of course, RealityZone.com.
[02:09:43.925 --> 02:09:45.947]  But real quick, Brad, you had a question.
[02:09:45.947 --> 02:09:48.629]  You said they're pushing the limits 70 hours a week.
[02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:52.052]  Satellite trackers telling you when to eat, when to sleep, harassing you.
[02:09:52.052 --> 02:09:53.954]  Police checkpoints everywhere.
[02:09:53.954 --> 02:09:55.715]  One piece of dust on your back bumpers.
[02:09:55.715 --> 02:09:56.976]  Not a lot of truck drivers.
[02:09:56.976 --> 02:09:58.698]  Giant tickets you've got to pay.
[02:09:58.698 --> 02:10:01.280]  Everything designed.
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:03.361]  Trucks out of Mexico driving down the wages.
[02:10:04.142 --> 02:10:05.662]  And then now they're moving to Google trucks.
[02:10:05.662 --> 02:10:14.885]  Within about five years, most truck drivers will either not be on the road or you'll be an attendant for the computer, helping just be a backup for it.
[02:10:14.885 --> 02:10:16.745]  And this is the total control grid.
[02:10:16.745 --> 02:10:19.906]  The robots are replacing everybody at the slave factories at Foxcom.
[02:10:19.906 --> 02:10:24.728]  And the globalists say that the robots are the answer to their mathematical question.
[02:10:24.728 --> 02:10:26.548]  They've never wanted the labor of the serfs.
[02:10:26.548 --> 02:10:27.908]  Serfs have always been cheap.
[02:10:27.908 --> 02:10:29.549]  Now we're like trash.
[02:10:29.549 --> 02:10:31.009]  Has to be taken to the dump.
[02:10:31.009 --> 02:10:32.910]  But first you've got to be made totally dependent
[02:10:34.991 --> 02:10:43.374]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:10:43.374 --> 02:10:45.114]  My advice I'm asking you is this.
[02:10:45.114 --> 02:10:46.755]  How do I handle all this?
[02:10:46.755 --> 02:10:52.817]  I mean, they got me, my whole family, everybody except me works for minimum wage.
[02:10:52.817 --> 02:10:54.398]  They can't get a good job.
[02:10:54.398 --> 02:10:57.019]  I mean, we're housed in here like a bunch of hermits, man.
[02:10:57.549 --> 02:11:04.055]  And we're barely on minimum wage except me, my stepson, my stepdaughter, my wife, my stepson.
[02:11:04.055 --> 02:11:05.356]  Well, you're at a survival point.
[02:11:05.356 --> 02:11:06.817]  The government's not the government anymore.
[02:11:06.817 --> 02:11:09.039]  If I was you, I would stop paying taxes.
[02:11:09.039 --> 02:11:10.961]  I mean, I'm not telling you what to do.
[02:11:10.961 --> 02:11:11.701]  This is what I would do.
[02:11:11.701 --> 02:11:18.828]  If I wasn't running a big operation, you know, full front in the enemy's face, I wouldn't be paying taxes to the Offshore Federal Reserve.
[02:11:18.828 --> 02:11:20.189]  I wouldn't be complying with anything.
[02:11:20.789 --> 02:11:29.918]  Now it is treason against humanity to comply with this alien, evil, murderous, scientific, technocratic, foreign banking cartel that's occupied the country.
[02:11:29.918 --> 02:11:31.340]  I mean, that isn't rhetoric.
[02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:32.601]  That's what we're under.
[02:11:32.601 --> 02:11:34.843]  And you've got a job to survive.
[02:11:34.843 --> 02:11:37.166]  And so I do just like the illegal aliens.
[02:11:39.312 --> 02:11:42.976]  I mean, they go and a lot of them get all the free welfare and health care and all that.
[02:11:42.976 --> 02:11:46.179]  That's done as a supplement so they can work for low wages and drive down wages.
[02:11:46.179 --> 02:11:47.721]  They're just being used as well.
[02:11:47.721 --> 02:11:50.784]  So, I mean, I wouldn't probably go do that, but survival's survival.
[02:11:50.784 --> 02:11:52.146]  It's all fiat to begin with.
[02:11:54.383 --> 02:11:58.485]  I'll ask Gilbert Griffin what you should do, but I know people are collapsing everywhere.
[02:11:58.485 --> 02:11:59.826]  And they want to collapse you.
[02:11:59.826 --> 02:12:02.587]  There's 101 million people now on food assistance.
[02:12:02.587 --> 02:12:05.348]  It's set to go to 140 million by the end of this year.
[02:12:05.348 --> 02:12:06.489]  I have an article on that today.
[02:12:06.489 --> 02:12:10.631]  This is a military technocratic takeover.
[02:12:10.631 --> 02:12:13.613]  And so just, you know, get your heart right with God, which sounds like you've done.
[02:12:13.613 --> 02:12:15.033]  That's what's most important.
[02:12:15.033 --> 02:12:17.995]  Let your family understand this is a scientific attack.
[02:12:17.995 --> 02:12:20.196]  And you can organize and rally together.
[02:12:20.196 --> 02:12:21.396]  Start planting more gardens.
[02:12:23.358 --> 02:12:26.403]  I'm sure you already don't do this, but don't support the big corporate system.
[02:12:26.403 --> 02:12:29.248]  Tell everybody, hey, we've got to gear up and get two jobs.
[02:12:29.248 --> 02:12:33.315]  Now all of us at minimum wage try to put stuff back for the real depression that's coming.
[02:12:34.581 --> 02:12:38.905]  And then, I know Michigan's been targeted for collapse.
[02:12:38.905 --> 02:12:41.307]  You know, you may have to evacuate that area at some point.
[02:12:41.307 --> 02:12:43.068]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:12:43.068 --> 02:12:45.370]  G. Edward Griffin, what a way to start the interview with you.
[02:12:45.370 --> 02:12:50.294]  And I wanted to take calls when you're on and just get into the general news and your take on the world.
[02:12:50.294 --> 02:12:53.536]  You're a best-selling writer, documentary film producer, and many successful titles.
[02:12:53.536 --> 02:12:55.658]  To your credit, listed in Who's Who in America.
[02:12:55.658 --> 02:12:59.581]  He's well known because of his unique talent for researching different topics.
[02:12:59.581 --> 02:13:01.883]  He, of course, has exposed the collectivist conspiracy.
[02:13:02.463 --> 02:13:04.645]  Why the mega banks finance him.
[02:13:04.645 --> 02:13:08.549]  He's also had national TV shows in the past as well.
[02:13:08.549 --> 02:13:13.053]  I won't go into his whole, his whole bio, but realityzone.com.
[02:13:13.053 --> 02:13:14.234]  You just heard that person.
[02:13:15.348 --> 02:13:21.633]  And most of the family I know is working two jobs, even though they've got college degrees, or army veterans, you name it.
[02:13:21.633 --> 02:13:25.736]  And they're working minimum wage, two jobs, can't even barely have the gas to get to work.
[02:13:25.736 --> 02:13:26.797]  Where does this all end?
[02:13:26.797 --> 02:13:33.702]  I guess we're seeing the fruits of globalism, the fruits of the New World Order, and Obama promises a life raft of more of the same.
[02:13:35.931 --> 02:13:39.054]  Alex, those are all the big questions, aren't they?
[02:13:39.054 --> 02:13:41.155]  Where does it all end and what do you do about it?
[02:13:41.155 --> 02:13:48.701]  And those two questions are really tied together because what you do about it may affect how it all ends.
[02:13:48.701 --> 02:13:52.264]  I guess the most important thing is what do you do about it right now?
[02:13:52.264 --> 02:13:54.566]  Your friend on the line there, your truck driver guy,
[02:13:55.326 --> 02:13:55.506]  Yes.
[02:14:10.017 --> 02:14:10.277]  I think?
[02:14:29.441 --> 02:14:35.403]  This great luxury liner, and we're all having a good time, and we find out that the ship has been captured.
[02:14:35.403 --> 02:14:54.529]  The captain of the ship has been thrown overboard, and all of the crew members have either been killed or put into the brig, and now all the pirates are walking around wearing the uniform of the captain and the crew, and the passengers on the ship have no idea that their ship of state, so to speak, has been captured by pirates.
[02:14:55.069 --> 02:15:04.859]  And the question I posed is, we know, we happen to see it all happen, and we tried to tell our other passengers on board the ship, we said, did you know that the captain really isn't the captain?
[02:15:04.859 --> 02:15:09.824]  That he's, that it's a pirate and all this, and they look at us like we're crazy, and they say, get out of here!
[02:15:09.824 --> 02:15:14.709]  But look, the ship is still going along fine, we're having good meals, the music is playing and all that sort of thing.
[02:15:15.149 --> 02:15:17.590]  So, the question arises, what do you do?
[02:15:17.590 --> 02:15:19.430]  And I go through a whole litany of things.
[02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:31.793]  Well, you can try and escape, you know, you can try and hide, you can try and sign a petition, pass a petition around the crew, and write letters to the captain and say, won't you please, you know, stop being a pirate and so forth.
[02:15:31.793 --> 02:15:40.415]  I go through all of these idiotic things that people do in modern society trying to overcome the fact that our ship has been captured by pirates.
[02:15:40.415 --> 02:15:42.916]  And finally, ticking them all off, none of them will work.
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:44.401]  Except one.
[02:16:02.538 --> 02:16:10.183]  Exactly, but first you've got to let the general public know these are pirates in the captain's uniform.
[02:16:10.183 --> 02:16:11.324]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:16:11.324 --> 02:16:13.905]  Yeah, because you can't do this alone, and that's the point.
[02:16:13.905 --> 02:16:18.908]  You need lots of help, and you need an organized effort, and you need coordinated effort, and you need smarts.
[02:16:18.908 --> 02:16:22.271]  You need strategy and tactics, and you need all kinds of things, and you can't do it alone.
[02:16:22.271 --> 02:16:23.311]  And not to debate the pirates.
[02:16:23.311 --> 02:16:28.815]  They've learned to play this game of going, we're not pirates, we're not pirates, when everything they're doing is piratical.
[02:16:29.215 --> 02:16:31.957]  They're caught lying on every front.
[02:16:31.957 --> 02:16:34.999]  And now we're starving in our state rooms.
[02:16:34.999 --> 02:16:37.941]  The power's off everywhere but up on their party deck.
[02:16:37.941 --> 02:16:40.682]  Now they're dragging our wives off to have sex with them.
[02:16:40.682 --> 02:16:42.363]  Now they're throwing people overboard.
[02:16:42.363 --> 02:16:46.966]  Now they're disappearing people on the ship that said, hey, they're pirates.
[02:16:46.966 --> 02:16:49.088]  Now people know they're pirates more and more.
[02:16:49.904 --> 02:16:52.605]  More and more they still do, but there are a lot of them that don't.
[02:16:52.605 --> 02:16:56.047]  And the ones that do know still are in kind of a state of apathy.
[02:16:56.047 --> 02:16:57.047]  They don't know what to do about it.
[02:16:57.047 --> 02:16:59.788]  Or they're scared of the pirates.
[02:16:59.788 --> 02:17:02.049]  And they don't have any inkling of what to do about it.
[02:17:02.049 --> 02:17:05.031]  And they keep thinking, well I'm only one person, what can one person do?
[02:17:05.031 --> 02:17:06.231]  And that's the core.
[02:17:06.231 --> 02:17:10.673]  We've got to get organized, we've got to get together, we've got to stop bickering with each other.
[02:17:10.973 --> 02:17:11.073]  Well...
[02:17:23.891 --> 02:17:25.533]  Everybody has their own talents, don't they?
[02:17:25.533 --> 02:17:29.196]  I happened to find out some years ago by accident that I was able to write.
[02:17:29.196 --> 02:17:38.524]  I never thought I could write, but I had to because I was very ill at one time and some publisher said, well, why don't you write this book on a topic you've been speaking about, the United Nations?
[02:17:38.524 --> 02:17:39.666]  And I said, well, I can't write.
[02:17:39.666 --> 02:17:41.527]  And then I thought, well, wait a minute, I'm ill.
[02:17:41.527 --> 02:17:43.089]  I can hardly get out of bed.
[02:17:43.089 --> 02:17:44.830]  Writing is about the only thing I could do.
[02:17:44.830 --> 02:17:45.931]  So I said, oh, no problem.
[02:17:46.732 --> 02:17:47.493]  Right.
[02:17:47.493 --> 02:17:50.295]  Well, I discovered, fortunately, that I could do that.
[02:17:50.295 --> 02:17:53.398]  So, that's my thing.
[02:17:53.398 --> 02:17:59.743]  Your thing is broadcasting, communicating, motivating people, raising the rabble, so to speak.
[02:17:59.743 --> 02:18:01.325]  Boy, that's an essential part of it.
[02:18:01.325 --> 02:18:05.448]  And communicating very important information along the way.
[02:18:05.448 --> 02:18:07.490]  Other people are more quiet in their approach.
[02:18:07.490 --> 02:18:11.474]  Some people work quietly, you know, within their church groups and with the PTA and so forth.
[02:18:11.474 --> 02:18:12.695]  But everybody has their thing.
[02:18:13.215 --> 02:18:20.300]  Maybe just within your family and your circle of friends, but whatever it is, figure it out quickly and do it.
[02:18:20.300 --> 02:18:23.582]  Get your information and start passing this information through.
[02:18:23.582 --> 02:18:25.684]  Don't be afraid of being rejected by it.
[02:18:25.684 --> 02:18:27.425]  I mean, that's the thing that scares most people.
[02:18:27.425 --> 02:18:29.046]  They're all wilting flowers.
[02:18:29.046 --> 02:18:30.967]  You know, it reminds me of the old days on radio.
[02:18:30.967 --> 02:18:38.032]  They had a show and it was the bashful salesman and it was a comedy routine and you would always hear it.
[02:18:38.032 --> 02:18:38.592]  He was afraid.
[02:18:38.592 --> 02:18:40.854]  He was a salesman, but he was afraid of rejection.
[02:18:40.854 --> 02:18:42.135]  So the scene was he had a little knock.
[02:18:42.495 --> 02:18:43.696]  Knock, knock, knock, knock.
[02:18:43.696 --> 02:18:45.256]  Nobody home, I hope, I hope, I hope.
[02:18:45.256 --> 02:18:46.237]  You know, this is how we are.
[02:18:46.237 --> 02:18:47.817]  I've seen that, yeah, it's funny.
[02:18:47.817 --> 02:18:48.938]  Yeah, it is funny.
[02:18:48.938 --> 02:18:57.041]  But we still have that built into us, and we've got to get rid of that, because rejection, that's nothing compared to what lies ahead if we don't take the ship back.
[02:18:58.706 --> 02:18:59.786]  I absolutely agree with you.
[02:18:59.786 --> 02:19:00.767]  We're going to break here in a moment.
[02:19:00.767 --> 02:19:05.588]  I want to come back and talk about the obvious mega-acceleration.
[02:19:05.588 --> 02:19:11.389]  Is that being done from a position of strength or weakness by the enemy, who I think you agree with me is about 10 years behind?
[02:19:11.389 --> 02:19:22.372]  And how serious is it going to get now that they've decided to just remove any pretense of the fact that they're democratic or constitutional, and what type of things they may pull?
[02:19:22.372 --> 02:19:23.973]  I mean, the incredible transparency of
[02:19:26.058 --> 02:19:32.968]  The NSA issue, Congress is about to do something because of uproar, and then they have fake terror alerts.
[02:19:32.968 --> 02:19:37.174]  All of it with G. Edward Griffin, RealityZone.com, Freedom Force International.
[02:19:38.137 --> 02:19:45.745]  We'll talk with him about the NSA scandal, Snowden, 2014, such a key election coming up.
[02:19:45.745 --> 02:19:47.186]  This is it, folks.
[02:19:47.186 --> 02:19:47.887]  This is it.
[02:19:47.887 --> 02:19:49.669]  We do have real pirates.
[02:19:49.669 --> 02:19:51.751]  Well, pirates are nice compared to these people.
[02:19:51.751 --> 02:19:58.137]  We have control freak, social engineer, mega criminals at war with humanity who've hijacked the ship.
[02:19:58.137 --> 02:19:59.919]  It's us or them, make no mistake.
[02:20:01.545 --> 02:20:12.290]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[02:20:12.290 --> 02:20:16.452]  Fortunately, a simple, safe, and effective alternative exists.
[02:20:16.452 --> 02:20:29.658]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast, and a limited number of parasites.

[02:22:01.968 --> 02:22:06.450]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:06.450 --> 02:22:12.172]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:12.172 --> 02:22:15.733]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:22:52.867 --> 02:22:53.788]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[02:22:59.943 --> 02:23:04.725]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:23:04.725 --> 02:23:07.747]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:23:07.747 --> 02:23:16.711]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:23:16.711 --> 02:23:21.634]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:23:22.250 --> 02:23:33.642]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:23:33.642 --> 02:23:40.649]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:23:41.309 --> 02:23:45.612]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:23:45.612 --> 02:23:49.214]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:23:49.214 --> 02:23:56.478]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:23:56.478 --> 02:23:57.738]  Protect your immune system.
[02:23:57.738 --> 02:23:58.779]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:24:11.141 --> 02:24:12.762]  Here's some of the news up on InfoWars.com.
[02:24:12.762 --> 02:24:14.742]  We're going to play this later in the hour.
[02:24:14.742 --> 02:24:17.223]  Rand Paul slams NPR host.
[02:24:17.223 --> 02:24:20.285]  Don't you have something better to do than a bunch of crap?
[02:24:20.285 --> 02:24:26.947]  It's time to just get in their face and just stop letting them all set the parameters of society.
[02:24:26.947 --> 02:24:33.470]  And then scrolling down, TSA now expanding its invasion of train terminals, sporting events, music festivals, and rodeos.
[02:24:34.261 --> 02:24:37.282]  You're not going anywhere without the government putting their hands on you.
[02:24:37.282 --> 02:24:38.343]  They're here to break you.
[02:24:38.343 --> 02:24:39.023]  You're a prisoner.
[02:24:39.023 --> 02:24:42.044]  Apartment complex bans weapons and firearms.
[02:24:42.044 --> 02:24:43.685]  No self-defense allowed.
[02:24:43.685 --> 02:24:47.506]  Criminals, obviously, are going to enjoy attacking.
[02:24:47.506 --> 02:24:47.806]  U.S.
[02:24:47.806 --> 02:24:54.329]  Air Force transports 24 tons of cocaine to Miami.
[02:24:54.329 --> 02:24:58.190]  And the media spins it like, oh, we found the cocaine because somebody blew the whistle.
[02:24:58.190 --> 02:24:59.771]  Just the naivete of the public.
[02:25:00.900 --> 02:25:02.703]  But it's okay because there's a terror alert.
[02:25:02.703 --> 02:25:04.365]  They're going to keep us safe.
[02:25:04.365 --> 02:25:06.888]  Going back to G. Edward Griffin.
[02:25:06.888 --> 02:25:17.121]  G. Edward, what's going to happen in the paradox and what do we do from your research perspective that you got more and more people waking up that we're in deep trouble and we got a really nasty version of tyranny?
[02:25:18.067 --> 02:25:26.151]  And then you've got others that are embracing it and absolutely feel like they're part of the power structure now, even though it abuses them.
[02:25:26.151 --> 02:25:30.273]  I mean, this is biblical level what I'm seeing happen.
[02:25:30.273 --> 02:25:34.975]  The quickening of mental illness in the general public versus the quickening of awakening.
[02:25:34.975 --> 02:25:39.037]  I mean, I'm really seeing some science fiction type stuff going on right now.
[02:25:40.143 --> 02:25:40.724]  It's true.
[02:25:40.724 --> 02:25:43.627]  It has all the stuff of a very dramatic story.
[02:25:43.627 --> 02:25:50.634]  A fiction writer couldn't have created anything more dramatic than the rising tide, I guess you would call it.
[02:25:50.634 --> 02:25:51.795]  Tides on both sides.
[02:25:51.795 --> 02:25:54.878]  As you said just a moment ago, the public is awakening.
[02:25:54.878 --> 02:25:58.382]  There's more awareness and it's becoming exponential.
[02:25:58.382 --> 02:26:03.127]  You think, my gosh, we're going to win because the public is beginning to
[02:26:03.407 --> 02:26:10.732]  I understand, but by the same token, the opposition, the totalitarian forces, are also rising like a tide.
[02:26:10.732 --> 02:26:16.756]  And one by one, the last few barriers against their unrestrained actions have been removed.
[02:26:16.756 --> 02:26:18.537]  And so they're moving faster and faster.
[02:26:18.537 --> 02:26:25.901]  I think about the only thing that restrains them is their lack of ability to administer this plan.
[02:26:25.901 --> 02:26:27.202]  It's like Obamacare.
[02:26:27.202 --> 02:26:28.723]  They've got this beautiful thing.
[02:26:28.723 --> 02:26:30.124]  In their mind, it's a beautiful thing.
[02:26:30.124 --> 02:26:31.105]  It's a horrible thing, of course.
[02:26:31.485 --> 02:26:32.986]  That they don't know how to administer yet.
[02:26:32.986 --> 02:26:35.028]  They haven't got it all tied together.
[02:26:35.028 --> 02:26:37.190]  So I think that's really what's... Well, exactly.
[02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:44.035]  The Nazis were very well ordered and followed orders well and had a large work ethic, unfortunately.
[02:26:44.035 --> 02:26:50.340]  One good news about the globalists is their minions are so incredibly stupid that it's very hard for them to carry things out.
[02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:52.222]  It's our compliance that empowers it.
[02:26:53.029 --> 02:26:57.211]  Well, there's no question about our compliance and our lack of resistance also.
[02:26:57.211 --> 02:27:01.553]  There's a midpoint there where between we don't comply, but we don't resist either.
[02:27:01.553 --> 02:27:02.354]  We don't know what to do.
[02:27:02.354 --> 02:27:09.557]  We're just sort of paralyzed, like that little mouse that's been hypnotized by the snake, or bitten with a little bit of venom, and he's paralyzed.
[02:27:09.557 --> 02:27:10.077]  He doesn't know.
[02:27:10.077 --> 02:27:13.319]  He just sits there and shakes, thinks, oh my gosh, that snake's going to eat me.
[02:27:13.319 --> 02:27:15.820]  Sure enough, snake eats him, because he doesn't run away.
[02:27:17.321 --> 02:27:17.761]  Yeah.
[02:27:17.761 --> 02:27:23.725]  The point, though, is that both of these forces, I see, are rising very rapidly and exponentially right now.
[02:27:23.725 --> 02:27:32.891]  And I can't imagine that this can go on much longer, certainly not even another generation, I don't think, before it comes to a head.
[02:27:32.891 --> 02:27:33.811]  And we'll know.
[02:27:33.811 --> 02:27:37.994]  We'll know because we'll be living in the final resolve of this conflict.
[02:27:38.474 --> 02:27:39.355]  Hopefully.
[02:27:39.355 --> 02:27:40.236]  Hopefully.
[02:27:40.236 --> 02:27:42.719]  Guys like you and me do our job.
[02:27:42.719 --> 02:27:49.287]  Our side, the forces of freedom and awareness, will rise faster than the forces of tyranny.
[02:27:49.287 --> 02:27:51.811]  It's going to be a close call, no matter how you call it.
[02:27:51.811 --> 02:27:55.035]  But as they say, these are exciting times to live in.
[02:27:55.635 --> 02:28:03.880]  As Ron Paul said yesterday, they're in a race to get their technocracy in because we're using the internet to really kick their butt right now in their own words.
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:13.506]  And speaking of that, I am seeing a lot of people in the system now really realize that, oh my gosh, that we are a corrupt fraud.
[02:28:13.506 --> 02:28:14.727]  What do they do?
[02:28:14.727 --> 02:28:17.328]  Not just a truck driver who's barely making it.
[02:28:17.328 --> 02:28:19.090]  What about people that work for the government?
[02:28:19.090 --> 02:28:24.413]  They don't like it, but they know that that's, at least on the surface, the only job they've got.
[02:28:25.182 --> 02:28:35.128]  Well, we know what they do because we have the examples in other societies, other systems where the totalitarian structure has collapsed.
[02:28:35.128 --> 02:28:49.377]  Like, for example, in Germany, there were millions of people that were involved and employed by and obedient to the Nazi regime because that was what they had to do if they wanted to stay out of the concentration camps.
[02:28:49.737 --> 02:28:53.541]  And also if they wanted to provide for their families, they were employed by it.
[02:28:53.541 --> 02:28:55.883]  It gave them status, it gave them sustenance.
[02:28:55.883 --> 02:29:08.714]  But after the war, I mean, there were almost all of them said, well, we hated it, we didn't know what to do, but we felt like we were helpless to get out of it, because we ourselves then would become the victim of it.
[02:29:08.814 --> 02:29:14.356]  Well, I've interviewed Hitler Youth and people who hated it, and their family said, you've got to do it or they'll kill us.
[02:29:14.356 --> 02:29:15.377]  That's it, exactly.
[02:29:15.377 --> 02:29:17.598]  And so, I'm sure that that's the case right now.
[02:29:17.598 --> 02:29:23.740]  There are people, well, I know there are, because I've talked to some of them, and said, well, here's some information, but don't use my name, you know?
[02:29:23.740 --> 02:29:29.042]  I'll give you the information, I'd like to help you, but don't use my name, because I'll lose my job, or something like that.
[02:29:29.042 --> 02:29:30.443]  So that's what's going on, I think.
[02:29:30.443 --> 02:29:32.804]  Tell you what, stay there, because I want to talk about this when we come back.
[02:29:33.504 --> 02:29:35.605]  When everybody sells out, everything collapses, folks.
[02:29:35.605 --> 02:29:39.268]  We're gonna lose everything anyways, because we've been compliant with this.
[02:29:39.268 --> 02:29:44.411]  I mean, you notice I'm getting, quote, more radical, because I realize the time is running out.
[02:29:44.411 --> 02:29:46.753]  We gotta up our game and get hardcore fast.
[02:29:46.753 --> 02:29:50.555]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:50.555 --> 02:29:51.936]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.936 --> 02:29:54.478]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.478 --> 02:29:57.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.128 --> 02:30:06.792]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[02:30:06.792 --> 02:30:12.757]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[02:30:12.757 --> 02:30:14.678]  What is the smartest investment you can make?
[02:30:14.678 --> 02:30:15.319]  It's food.
[02:30:15.319 --> 02:30:22.265]  Having a supply of eFoodsDirect 25-year shelf-life food is your best investment for the troubled times today and the future.

[02:31:02.426 --> 02:31:16.198]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens, and parasites.

[02:32:01.946 --> 02:32:05.808]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:32:05.808 --> 02:32:11.331]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:32:11.331 --> 02:32:19.055]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:32:19.055 --> 02:32:28.180]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:32:28.360 --> 02:32:35.528]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:32:35.528 --> 02:32:38.431]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:32:38.431 --> 02:32:44.378]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[02:32:45.378 --> 02:32:48.240]  Something happening here, my friends!
[02:33:12.014 --> 02:33:17.680]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:17.680 --> 02:33:20.303]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.303 --> 02:33:23.546]  The Death Machine!
[02:33:35.831 --> 02:33:38.552]  It's growing pound for pound.
[02:33:38.552 --> 02:33:41.452]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:41.452 --> 02:33:53.575]  There's a story up on InfoWars.com that we're going to play a clip of and get Jim McGriffin's take on, but Rand Paul slams NPR host, don't you have something better to do than a bunch of crap, trying to say that Rand Paul is racist.
[02:33:53.575 --> 02:34:04.978]  And the Democrats got caught during the senatorial election a few years ago, on record, dressing up in hayseed outfits and going out with racist signs saying they worked for Rand Paul.
[02:34:06.018 --> 02:34:09.863]  They did the same thing down at the Trayvon Martin situation.
[02:34:09.863 --> 02:34:14.349]  Foundation funded groups, we did articles with their names, in Houston.
[02:34:15.613 --> 02:34:20.355]  These people are cold-blooded race baiters, folks, because they don't want to have real issue discussions.
[02:34:20.355 --> 02:34:22.556]  They want to get us all divided and conquered.
[02:34:22.556 --> 02:34:27.117]  Let's play a clip of Rand Paul fighting back.
[02:34:27.117 --> 02:34:27.897]  Absolutely.
[02:34:27.897 --> 02:34:30.218]  I mean, it's time to say, shut up!
[02:34:30.218 --> 02:34:33.239]  When these people go, how dare you try to change the subject?
[02:34:33.239 --> 02:34:35.060]  You're the one pushing race stuff!
[02:34:35.060 --> 02:34:38.221]  Because, again, it's not just you hate somebody because they look different.
[02:34:38.221 --> 02:34:43.163]  It's the people that are running race stuff are the real racists, because they're using it as a game.
[02:34:44.771 --> 02:34:49.372]  They think you're stupid, and I'm sick of seeing everybody buy into this stuff!
[02:34:49.372 --> 02:34:50.993]  I never liked con artists!
[02:34:50.993 --> 02:34:51.753]  Let's go to this clip.
[02:34:51.753 --> 02:35:01.395]  Let me read you something that The Economist, the political magazine, the British magazine, wrote a few weeks ago and gets you to react to it.
[02:35:01.395 --> 02:35:08.557]  It said, the only notable libertarian-leaning politicians to generate real excitement among conservative voters
[02:35:09.365 --> 02:35:18.968]  Don't you have something better to read than a bunch of crap from people who don't like me?
[02:35:18.968 --> 02:35:26.390]  I mean, that won't make for much of an interview if I have to sit through, you know, reading after recitation of people calling me a racist.
[02:35:26.390 --> 02:35:27.371]  No, no, I understand.
[02:35:27.371 --> 02:35:31.692]  I don't accept all of that and I don't really need to or spend the time
[02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:33.611]  Going and talking about that.
[02:35:33.611 --> 02:35:42.816]  If you want to talk about issues and what I stand for, I'm happy to, but I'm not going to really go through an interview reciting and responding to every yahoo in the world who wants to throw up a car.
[02:35:42.816 --> 02:35:43.897]  That's enough.
[02:35:43.897 --> 02:35:45.018]  But why?
[02:35:45.018 --> 02:35:48.279]  Absolutely, folks, and this is what they do.
[02:35:48.279 --> 02:35:51.761]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, they don't want us to come together.
[02:35:51.761 --> 02:35:54.103]  All they want to do is see us fighting with each other.
[02:35:55.819 --> 02:35:56.800]  And killing one another.
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:35:58.220]  And I'm sick of it.
[02:35:58.220 --> 02:36:06.565]  What do you make of the Republican and Democratic establishment unifying against Rand Paul and Ted Cruz?
[02:36:06.565 --> 02:36:08.086]  I mean, I don't know Ted Cruz well.
[02:36:08.086 --> 02:36:09.267]  I know Rand Paul very well.
[02:36:09.267 --> 02:36:11.048]  I know he's for real.
[02:36:11.048 --> 02:36:15.650]  I mean, that's got to really concern them that he's pretty much the frontrunner for the Republicans.
[02:36:15.650 --> 02:36:21.594]  But again, I see that as a positive thing that the only person people can get excited about is a constitutionalist.
[02:36:24.042 --> 02:36:25.643]  Gilbert Griffin, what's your take on that?
[02:36:25.643 --> 02:36:26.684]  Oh, that's a question to me.
[02:36:26.684 --> 02:36:27.885]  I'm sorry, I missed that.
[02:36:27.885 --> 02:36:29.326]  Well, I think you've said it so well.
[02:36:29.326 --> 02:36:32.128]  It's a very positive sign.
[02:36:32.128 --> 02:36:43.337]  In fact, I had a little tete-a-tete yesterday afternoon with Gary Arnold, who's, you know, running, a libertarian candidate for governor and hopefully president somewhere down the line.
[02:36:43.337 --> 02:36:45.178]  And we got into that very topic.
[02:36:45.178 --> 02:36:47.019]  And I said, what is it that excites people?
[02:36:47.019 --> 02:36:51.303]  He said, well, the only thing that excites people are the things that the Republican Party doesn't want to touch.
[02:36:51.963 --> 02:36:57.926]  He said that they're tired of that same old problem and the myth of a two-party system.
[02:36:57.926 --> 02:37:03.129]  He said the things we talk about, the really hardcore issues, are the only things that get people excited.
[02:37:03.129 --> 02:37:19.398]  And he said if the media would let that through, why he said there'd be no question, he said libertarians or whatever they call themselves, conservatives, but you know what we're talking about, people that really respect the principles of the Constitution, he said that they would be in control, but the media blocks it out.
[02:37:19.858 --> 02:37:24.201]  So, I think Rand Paul was right on when he refused to give credence to all of that stuff.
[02:37:24.201 --> 02:37:25.662]  He knows what it is.
[02:37:25.662 --> 02:37:31.206]  Your movie, Mind Control, explains it very well.
[02:37:31.206 --> 02:37:44.634]  Not making the label of racism stick on somebody, but just putting it out there and dangling in front of somebody is enough for the average viewer on television to say, oh, didn't I hear something about racism in Rand Paul?
[02:37:45.475 --> 02:37:46.076]  Exactly!
[02:37:46.076 --> 02:37:48.018]  Smokescreens, it changes the subject.
[02:37:48.018 --> 02:37:49.840]  Since you mentioned that, let's put a plug in.
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:51.862]  I'm in it, you're in it, I'm distributing it, but I didn't make it.
[02:37:51.862 --> 02:37:52.843]  It's excellent.
[02:37:52.843 --> 02:37:56.166]  And that, of course, is the new film of the makers of A Noble Lie.
[02:37:56.166 --> 02:37:58.368]  State of mind on Blu-ray and DVD.
[02:37:58.368 --> 02:38:00.731]  You get free citizen rule books and bumper stickers with it.
[02:38:00.731 --> 02:38:05.335]  Great way to get your friends and family aware of the fact that their minds are being manipulated.
[02:38:05.335 --> 02:38:06.216]  Colonel Schaffer's in it.
[02:38:06.937 --> 02:38:10.100]  A bunch of psychiatrists and psychologists and researchers.
[02:38:10.100 --> 02:38:11.140]  It's really well done.
[02:38:11.140 --> 02:38:12.802]  And that's why I've gotten behind the film.
[02:38:12.802 --> 02:38:17.405]  It's available at InfowarsStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:38:17.405 --> 02:38:21.649]  And you also support independent filmmaking.
[02:38:21.649 --> 02:38:25.872]  Or go to GCNlive.com and they sell it pretty much at cost.
[02:38:25.872 --> 02:38:27.614]  Get a copy of Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:38:29.702 --> 02:38:41.645]  I mean, look, I'd say there's probably, what, 50, 60 million libertarian patriots or more in this country, very conservatively.
[02:38:41.645 --> 02:38:43.725]  More like 100 million that are somewhat awake.
[02:38:43.725 --> 02:38:52.407]  If we'd all just wake up a couple people and then get those people to do a little something to expose the system, G. Edward Griffin, wouldn't that begin to really shake it to its foundations?
[02:38:52.827 --> 02:38:54.428]  Well, it's already happening, isn't it?
[02:38:54.428 --> 02:38:56.450]  But yes, it just needs to be continued.
[02:38:56.450 --> 02:38:57.530]  It needs to be amplified.
[02:38:57.530 --> 02:39:00.372]  It would shake the system to the foundation.
[02:39:00.372 --> 02:39:01.753]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:39:01.753 --> 02:39:06.257]  That's the one thing they fear, is that critical mass should be reached.
[02:39:06.257 --> 02:39:08.678]  And by critical mass, it's not just numbers.
[02:39:08.678 --> 02:39:11.480]  It's not just a certain mathematical formula.
[02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:21.828]  But in this case, a critical mass could be reached by as few as maybe 15% of the population, if that 15% was active, if they were really out doing something about it.
[02:39:22.068 --> 02:39:28.272]  Now if they're all just a bunch of riders in the boat and not pullers at the oars, well then it might take 60 or 70 percent, you know?
[02:39:28.272 --> 02:39:36.057]  So our goal is to get that 15 percent or whatever it is, that critical mass, out there and shaking the system right to its roots.
[02:39:36.601 --> 02:39:38.661]  That's right, folks, and don't expect victory overnight.
[02:39:38.661 --> 02:39:41.322]  The media tries to go, oh, your group's defeated.
[02:39:41.322 --> 02:39:41.622]  Really?
[02:39:41.622 --> 02:39:45.783]  We beat them on their fear-mongering to get our guns.
[02:39:45.783 --> 02:39:49.144]  We've been beating them on so many other big subjects.
[02:39:49.144 --> 02:39:49.644]  Their U.N.
[02:39:49.644 --> 02:39:52.625]  gun treaties, their open borders.
[02:39:52.625 --> 02:39:54.605]  We've been beating them on so many fronts.
[02:39:54.605 --> 02:40:01.206]  We're beating them on Obamacare, as we learned that the establishment's exempt, as usual, from all of this.
[02:40:01.206 --> 02:40:02.927]  We just have to intensify
[02:40:03.967 --> 02:40:06.310]  And we will defeat them, because folks, here's the deal.
[02:40:06.310 --> 02:40:08.492]  If they win, they want to fully collectivize.
[02:40:08.492 --> 02:40:18.883]  You're the expert making films even 40 years ago that aired nationally, you know, in movie theaters and things, about the collectivists and how the ultra-rich fund it, the monopoly men.
[02:40:18.883 --> 02:40:20.684]  Explain to people what we face.
[02:40:21.445 --> 02:40:23.587]  If the collectivists are able to take over.
[02:40:23.587 --> 02:40:26.989]  They're clearly trying to break America and Europe right now.
[02:40:26.989 --> 02:40:29.351]  Collectivize us, make us dependent.
[02:40:29.351 --> 02:40:32.633]  So even though we're waking people up, they're still shutting the country down.
[02:40:32.633 --> 02:40:34.514]  What does collectivization mean?
[02:40:34.514 --> 02:40:37.376]  What does it mean to let these people run things?
[02:40:37.376 --> 02:40:39.858]  Because they're already on the news saying your kids aren't yours.
[02:40:39.858 --> 02:40:42.240]  They're already, they're really coming out in the open now.
[02:40:44.352 --> 02:40:49.397]  That's a topic I would rather not discuss, but you've asked the question, so I have to do it.
[02:40:49.397 --> 02:40:53.442]  The reason I would rather not discuss it is because it gets to be very scary.
[02:40:53.442 --> 02:40:58.347]  We know what they will do, because we know what they have done in the past.
[02:40:58.347 --> 02:41:01.029]  Collectivism is just the generic term for
[02:41:02.671 --> 02:41:05.312]  Communism, fascism, Nazism.
[02:41:05.312 --> 02:41:09.954]  If you want to know what they will do, see what they have done when they have come to power.
[02:41:09.954 --> 02:41:17.597]  And all you need to do is just see what Stalin did and the number of people who were eliminated, murdered, imprisoned, tortured, put into slave labor camps.
[02:41:17.597 --> 02:41:19.278]  See what Mao Tse-Tung did.
[02:41:19.278 --> 02:41:20.878]  You know, see what Castro did.
[02:41:20.878 --> 02:41:23.459]  Just look and see what Hitler did.
[02:41:23.459 --> 02:41:25.160]  And you know what will happen.
[02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:26.981]  Now, it happens in a very
[02:41:28.101 --> 02:41:29.342]  Sequential manner.
[02:41:29.342 --> 02:41:37.567]  I had an opportunity years ago to interview a fellow by the name of Yuri Bezmenov, who was a Soviet defector.
[02:41:37.567 --> 02:41:56.838]  He was a very high-ranking officer in the KGB, and he defected to the West, and I had a chance to meet him, and I put him on camera, interviewed him, and we talked about this very topic, and he said, when we come to power, when he's talking about we, he meant his former affiliation with the Communist Empire, he said, the first people we pick up and eliminate
[02:41:57.478 --> 02:41:57.878]  We're good to go.
[02:42:18.138 --> 02:42:19.579]  Oh my gosh, that makes a lot of sense.
[02:42:19.579 --> 02:42:25.163]  And then when you look at history, you see that is exactly what happened every time collectivism comes to power.
[02:42:25.163 --> 02:42:30.866]  And of course, they round up everybody that they think is going to be potential opposition and get them out of the way.
[02:42:30.866 --> 02:42:32.347]  Folks, you're not going to like it.
[02:42:32.347 --> 02:42:33.288]  You've got to stop it.
[02:42:33.288 --> 02:42:37.090]  You can't wait until afterwards and say, well, how do we rebuild the system?
[02:42:37.090 --> 02:42:39.351]  You've got to stop the collapse of the system.
[02:42:39.351 --> 02:42:45.235]  That's why I said earlier, we must recapture control of the ship before it hits the rocks.
[02:42:45.235 --> 02:42:45.896]  There's no choice.
[02:42:46.836 --> 02:42:51.858]  And when you really listen to almost all of Obama's czars, they go, we love Mao.
[02:42:51.858 --> 02:42:53.499]  We're going to have re-education camps.
[02:42:53.499 --> 02:42:56.260]  We're going to put libertarians and conservatives in them.
[02:42:56.260 --> 02:42:58.161]  And they're not playing games.
[02:42:58.161 --> 02:43:02.743]  And they fantasize about their militias they're going to have and how they're going to come get us.
[02:43:03.343 --> 02:43:05.184]  And I mean, I got news for them.
[02:43:05.184 --> 02:43:08.126]  I'm not like you, looking for a fight, because I've never been in one.
[02:43:08.126 --> 02:43:09.307]  I've been in a couple.
[02:43:09.307 --> 02:43:10.467]  And I'm not looking for trouble.
[02:43:10.467 --> 02:43:12.168]  But listen, I'm not going to any camp.
[02:43:12.168 --> 02:43:14.830]  My kids aren't.
[02:43:14.830 --> 02:43:22.114]  But all the so-called intellectuals, as you just talked about, that historically will buy into this, because they're invited to the table.
[02:43:22.114 --> 02:43:23.495]  They feel special.
[02:43:23.495 --> 02:43:27.077]  They feel like, since they've been brought into the system, they're going to support it.
[02:43:27.077 --> 02:43:29.859]  Don't they have any idea what door they're opening?
[02:43:30.762 --> 02:43:47.228]  Well, no, they don't at the time, because they're so imbued with this utopic concept of, you know, the end justifies the means, and everybody will live happily and share equally, and there will be no wars, and be full employment, and no poverty, and no injustice, and all that stuff.
[02:43:47.228 --> 02:43:48.148]  They fall for it.
[02:43:48.148 --> 02:43:51.229]  They really believe it, and so they work hard for it.
[02:43:51.229 --> 02:43:56.331]  Then they learn it's just guys in black uniforms raping their wife and kicking their eyeballs out.
[02:43:56.331 --> 02:43:59.572]  And then they say, ah, guess we made a mistake.
[02:43:59.572 --> 02:44:00.272]  That's what happens.
[02:44:00.799 --> 02:44:03.103]  But too late, you're now in a forced labor camp.
[02:44:03.103 --> 02:44:04.986]  That's right.
[02:44:04.986 --> 02:44:06.569]  So we've got to stop that from happening.
[02:44:06.569 --> 02:44:08.492]  That's the focus, I think.
[02:44:08.492 --> 02:44:10.636]  We know how bad it's going to be.
[02:44:10.636 --> 02:44:12.099]  It's just intolerable.
[02:44:12.099 --> 02:44:13.080]  You can't even think about it.
[02:44:13.726 --> 02:44:14.807]  Anything would be better than that.
[02:44:14.807 --> 02:44:22.511]  And by the way, with Homeland Security and the bullets, the armored vehicles, and saying the Patriots are the enemy, they're gearing up and trying to get cops to go along with them.
[02:44:22.511 --> 02:44:34.938]  And you see articles out of like Colorado where just a few months ago they called in the state police, the senior ones, 200 of them, and told them, they said, the Christians are the enemy, and are you prepared to confiscate their guns?
[02:44:34.938 --> 02:44:37.399]  And state police got them and said, is this a joke?
[02:44:37.399 --> 02:44:40.781]  But they were there marking down who was going to go along with it.
[02:44:41.536 --> 02:44:42.236]  Right.
[02:44:42.236 --> 02:44:45.817]  And those that didn't go along with it are on a list already.
[02:44:45.817 --> 02:44:47.057]  Yep, that's the way it works.
[02:44:47.057 --> 02:44:49.697]  My God, I mean, they're really planning to do this, G. Edward.
[02:44:49.697 --> 02:44:50.238]  They are.
[02:44:50.238 --> 02:44:50.698]  They are.
[02:44:50.698 --> 02:44:50.938]  They are.
[02:44:50.938 --> 02:44:51.718]  There's no question.
[02:44:51.718 --> 02:44:54.558]  Well, we've known that for, what, 50 years.
[02:44:54.558 --> 02:44:55.679]  Yeah, but now, exactly.
[02:44:55.679 --> 02:45:00.159]  But now, you know, it's kind of like your dad says, don't play with a light socket, you'll shock yourself.
[02:45:00.159 --> 02:45:02.720]  You finally stick the knife in there and you get shocked.
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:04.300]  You go, oh, now I get it.
[02:45:04.300 --> 02:45:06.821]  I mean, we're now at the edge of the precipice.
[02:45:06.821 --> 02:45:08.881]  And for a lot of people, they've already been shoved into it.
[02:45:09.639 --> 02:45:11.021]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:45:11.021 --> 02:45:17.027]  And people are already captured economically, intellectually.
[02:45:17.027 --> 02:45:19.850]  They're afraid to speak out, as we talked about earlier.
[02:45:19.850 --> 02:45:21.011]  They don't want to speak.
[02:45:21.011 --> 02:45:22.253]  I'll give you a little example.
[02:45:22.253 --> 02:45:28.880]  Right after the Hungarian Revolution, there was a wave of Hungarian freedom fighters that came out, and I happened to meet one of them.
[02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:30.381]  Steve Szabo was his name.
[02:45:30.942 --> 02:45:33.143]  And he was one of the real genuine freedom fighters.
[02:45:33.143 --> 02:45:41.685]  He was out there in the streets with his rifle and he was fighting against the Soviet tanks and finally when the revolt turned around and they had to flee for their lives, he came to the U.S.
[02:45:41.685 --> 02:45:42.405]  and I talked to him.
[02:45:42.405 --> 02:45:48.566]  And I said, what was life like before the revolution or the revolt?
[02:45:48.566 --> 02:45:54.008]  And he told me, you know, how much it was under control, very much like in America today.
[02:45:54.008 --> 02:45:55.588]  People hated it.
[02:45:55.588 --> 02:45:58.169]  They were afraid of it, but they were afraid to speak up.
[02:45:58.169 --> 02:45:58.729]  He says, you know,
[02:45:59.349 --> 02:46:05.097]  He said, we had freedoms on paper, but we didn't dare exercise them.
[02:46:05.097 --> 02:46:07.240]  He said, for example, there were churches.
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:08.301]  There were churches.
[02:46:08.301 --> 02:46:11.185]  And we had the freedom to go to a church if we wanted to.
[02:46:12.028 --> 02:46:17.149]  But we didn't go, because we knew if we went, he said, we would be recorded.
[02:46:17.149 --> 02:46:20.750]  Our names would be recorded, and then our food allotment would come down.
[02:46:20.750 --> 02:46:25.531]  Or maybe our job, we'd be reassigned to a less desirable job with lower pay.
[02:46:25.531 --> 02:46:27.312]  That's right, you gotta play ball.
[02:46:27.312 --> 02:46:27.932]  Play ball.
[02:46:27.932 --> 02:46:29.833]  He said, so we never did those things.
[02:46:29.833 --> 02:46:32.633]  He said, now I come to America, and I see the same thing here.
[02:46:32.633 --> 02:46:35.554]  And this was, what, 20, 30 years ago?
[02:46:35.554 --> 02:46:39.095]  And he said, now I see people, well, I'm afraid to speak up because I might
[02:46:39.949 --> 02:46:41.910]  Get fired?
[02:46:41.910 --> 02:46:42.710]  And that's slavery.
[02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:43.571]  That's pathetic.
[02:46:43.571 --> 02:47:04.661]  And you see a film like The Lives of Others that's based on a true story where the arts boss in Eastern Germany goes to all the beautiful starlets and says, you're going to have sex with me if you want to be on the stage.
[02:47:04.661 --> 02:47:05.741]  And that's what it's really like.
[02:47:07.935 --> 02:47:08.015]  Yes.
[02:47:24.808 --> 02:47:27.550]  He was just a regional artist then, somewhat successful.
[02:47:27.550 --> 02:47:35.536]  These people would come on power trips and judge his art that wasn't even political and tell him, do this, paint this on here and I'll let you show it.
[02:47:35.536 --> 02:47:39.900]  And it was all about them having the power to tell you what to do.
[02:47:39.900 --> 02:47:46.985]  These authoritarian systems are all about the worship of the priest of power that O'Brien talks about in 1984.
[02:47:46.985 --> 02:47:49.507]  It's all about a power trip for scum.
[02:47:49.507 --> 02:47:50.528]  I mean, it's pathetic!
[02:47:51.971 --> 02:47:55.334]  Well, you won't get any argument from me on that.
[02:47:55.334 --> 02:48:02.079]  The only extra twist to that is that some of these people, not all, but some of them actually don't think of themselves as scum.
[02:48:02.079 --> 02:48:04.021]  They think of themselves as intellectuals.
[02:48:04.021 --> 02:48:06.122]  They think of themselves as the wise ones.
[02:48:06.122 --> 02:48:07.363]  Oh, no, no, no, exactly!
[02:48:07.363 --> 02:48:09.865]  You've got to worship them, yeah.
[02:48:09.865 --> 02:48:12.668]  Because everyone else is too dumb, and they need their input.
[02:48:12.668 --> 02:48:14.689]  They really believe that.
[02:48:14.689 --> 02:48:15.250]  Unbelievable.
[02:48:15.250 --> 02:48:16.611]  Let's take a phone call.
[02:48:16.611 --> 02:48:18.372]  Let's talk to Comey in Tennessee.
[02:48:18.372 --> 02:48:19.053]  You're on the air.
[02:48:19.053 --> 02:48:20.133]  You want to talk about solutions?
[02:48:20.133 --> 02:48:20.454]  Go ahead.
[02:48:22.346 --> 02:48:23.447]  Yes, thank you.
[02:48:23.447 --> 02:48:25.288]  First time call.
[02:48:25.288 --> 02:48:30.790]  I have a comment and then I got a question for Alex and Mr. Griffin.
[02:48:30.790 --> 02:48:31.691]  Go ahead.
[02:48:31.691 --> 02:48:32.271]  Okay.
[02:48:32.271 --> 02:48:33.431]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:33.431 --> 02:48:36.313]  Yeah, okay.
[02:48:36.313 --> 02:48:39.554]  I think that part of the problem with all this is
[02:48:41.869 --> 02:48:53.459]  That those of us who call ourselves Christians are doing very, very little so God has allowed these people to come in to get our attention.
[02:48:53.459 --> 02:49:00.985]  And Mr. Griffin, you had mentioned about taking control of the ship, which obviously we have to do.
[02:49:00.985 --> 02:49:08.932]  Can you comment on how that may not be possible unless we call on a captain of a house
[02:49:10.693 --> 02:49:13.115]  Sure, sure.
[02:49:13.115 --> 02:49:16.237]  Undoubtedly, as the founder said, you have to have a moral people to be free.
[02:49:16.237 --> 02:49:17.478]  G. Edward?
[02:49:17.478 --> 02:49:19.600]  Yes, I agree with that totally.
[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:26.125]  I don't discount the power of people who do not have a strong religious conviction yet.
[02:49:26.125 --> 02:49:35.832]  I mean, I think everybody, by the time they get toward the end of their lives, their religious convictions get more serious attention than when they're young and they think they're going to live forever.
[02:49:36.412 --> 02:49:40.255]  But I find that there is, yes, first of all, I agree with that totally.
[02:49:40.255 --> 02:49:49.942]  You have to have a set of principles that are based on values that are beyond oneself.
[02:49:49.942 --> 02:49:51.303]  I mean, I think that's pretty obvious.
[02:49:51.303 --> 02:50:00.850]  Because if you are the only reason for existing, well then, why not just sell out to the highest bidder or to the most fearsome tyrant?
[02:50:00.850 --> 02:50:02.211]  A man's got to have...
[02:50:02.731 --> 02:50:07.352]  Yes, but where I was going with that is that I think we all have programmed within us this instinct for a higher
[02:50:20.503 --> 02:50:22.645]  A higher principle than ourselves.
[02:50:22.645 --> 02:50:27.948]  Whether we base it on a religious principle or if we just say it's instinct, we just all have it.
[02:50:27.948 --> 02:50:38.195]  Every primitive society, even the ones that worship the God in the volcano, you know, their concepts of deity are far different than ours.
[02:50:38.195 --> 02:50:45.980]  They all have this instinct for justice and sometimes they make great sacrifices of themselves for their family and their loved ones.
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:52.810]  I think we need to tune in to that, that sensitivity, that instinct, that innate quality.
[02:50:52.810 --> 02:50:53.691]  Our humanity.
[02:50:53.691 --> 02:50:54.792]  We have to tune in.
[02:50:54.792 --> 02:50:58.197]  Yes, we have to rediscover our humanity before it's lost.
[02:50:58.197 --> 02:50:58.778]  Thank you Collin.
[02:50:58.778 --> 02:50:59.519]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:51:01.755 --> 02:51:06.419]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[02:51:06.419 --> 02:51:12.364]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[02:51:12.364 --> 02:51:14.305]  What is the smartest investment you can make?
[02:51:14.305 --> 02:51:14.946]  It's food.
[02:51:14.946 --> 02:51:21.892]  Having a supply of eFoodsDirect 25-year shelf life food is your best investment for the troubled times today and the future.

[02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:05.723]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.
[02:52:05.723 --> 02:52:07.825]  So you may know a few things about him.
[02:52:07.825 --> 02:52:14.051]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[02:52:14.491 --> 02:52:20.093]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[02:52:20.093 --> 02:52:20.833]  It's true!
[02:52:20.833 --> 02:52:22.974]  And he can email you the test results.
[02:52:22.974 --> 02:52:25.135]  Just visit GoBerkey.com.
[02:52:25.135 --> 02:52:30.277]  You may also know that the Berkey Guy has helped tens of thousands of people get better prepared.

[02:52:50.127 --> 02:52:51.128]  GoBerkey.com, home of the Berkey Guy.
[02:53:01.155 --> 02:53:07.860]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've witnessed that a lot of illness can be linked to toxins and deficiencies combined.
[02:53:07.860 --> 02:53:14.364]  Improving your liver function and restoring your cells' ability to detoxify is essential to achieving radiant health.
[02:53:14.364 --> 02:53:18.547]  Listen to the real-world results of Doug and his wife after taking One World Way.
[02:53:18.547 --> 02:53:19.928]  My name is Doug Diderot.
[02:53:19.928 --> 02:53:22.990]  For years, I had an ongoing rash with itching around my eyes.
[02:53:22.990 --> 02:53:26.413]  This was due to metal dust particles landing on my face in the workplace.
[02:53:26.893 --> 02:53:33.577]  After being on One World Way for two weeks, I began to have a severe rash and itching sensation around my eyes.
[02:53:33.577 --> 02:53:37.660]  This rash and itching lasted for five weeks and is now 100% gone.
[02:53:37.660 --> 02:53:45.985]  Additionally, without extra exercise, I've also increased my muscle size and my wife has lost weight and gained a more attractive figure.
[02:53:46.499 --> 02:53:48.520]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:53:48.520 --> 02:53:52.021]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:53:52.021 --> 02:53:55.143]  888-988-3325.
[02:53:55.143 --> 02:53:57.304]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:53:57.304 --> 02:54:04.407]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:54:04.407 --> 02:54:11.050]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:54:11.050 --> 02:54:14.031]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:17.236 --> 02:54:27.199]  Yeah, right now, Fox News is reporting that TSA is going to be on the streets, and at your rodeo, and everywhere in your life, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:27.199 --> 02:54:34.421]  And they start with trucks that are under transportation code, where they think they can violate their rights, and then they're now moving into the general public.
[02:54:34.421 --> 02:54:38.603]  They're in shopping malls with the police and the army, in many cases.
[02:54:38.603 --> 02:54:43.024]  This is the incremental rollout of martial law.
[02:54:44.379 --> 02:54:48.181]  They're showing them on Fox News going into neighborhoods.
[02:54:48.181 --> 02:54:53.283]  They just showed that in somebody's trailer park with dogs coming up to your houses.
[02:54:53.283 --> 02:54:55.424]  I mean, this is it, folks.
[02:54:55.424 --> 02:54:59.206]  They're getting ready to blow a bunch of stuff up and pose as saviors on the news.
[02:54:59.206 --> 02:55:00.747]  That brush is pretty clear.
[02:55:00.747 --> 02:55:03.989]  When they do carry out these false flags, you've got to record everything.
[02:55:03.989 --> 02:55:06.590]  If you're on the scene, start videotaping because we'll catch them.
[02:55:07.421 --> 02:55:12.926]  But this is a toe-to-toe war with people that have taken this country and believe it's theirs.
[02:55:12.926 --> 02:55:20.172]  Gee, Edward Griffin, man, do we get an apology for everything we've talked about coming true and coming out in the open?
[02:55:20.172 --> 02:55:23.755]  I mean, we know they're following a battle plan, a program, a script.
[02:55:24.595 --> 02:55:26.336]  Uh, so that's why we know what they're going to do.
[02:55:26.336 --> 02:55:27.436]  We've read their writings.
[02:55:27.436 --> 02:55:29.958]  People think, now they're like, some people are like, how did you know this?
[02:55:29.958 --> 02:55:30.838]  You're a prophet.
[02:55:30.838 --> 02:55:37.181]  No, they told us what they would do, but still others are getting more mad at us now, I've noticed, that, okay, you're the bad guy.
[02:55:37.181 --> 02:55:39.282]  I want the TSA in my neighborhood.
[02:55:41.021 --> 02:55:43.163]  Well, that's because they've fallen for all the garbage.
[02:55:43.163 --> 02:55:44.924]  They've fallen for the propaganda.
[02:55:44.924 --> 02:55:46.626]  They're the victims of the mine war.
[02:55:46.626 --> 02:55:48.647]  They've been subjected.
[02:55:48.647 --> 02:55:55.333]  They actually believe what they've been told at the TSA and all of the Homeland Security Theater.
[02:55:55.333 --> 02:55:58.836]  They actually believe that that's there to protect them against terrorists.
[02:56:00.157 --> 02:56:00.457]  That's
[02:56:15.094 --> 02:56:18.875]  Over in China, who were the people that the masses were led to turn against?
[02:56:18.875 --> 02:56:25.196]  The landholders, the ones that had saved, the ones that produced food, the ones that had nice things.
[02:56:25.196 --> 02:56:26.816]  All the rabble had been roused.
[02:56:26.816 --> 02:56:32.817]  You're the people, they said, you are the greedy ones that you brought about all this misery and all this war and so forth.
[02:56:32.817 --> 02:56:41.439]  And the good, honest, hardworking people were put to the wall and killed by, not the communists, but by the peasants who were
[02:56:42.159 --> 02:56:42.660]  I don't know.
[02:56:56.704 --> 02:57:02.047]  Yes, of course, the producers had to go, because the producers were the ones who had some smarts.
[02:57:02.047 --> 02:57:05.129]  Not only were they producers... Why were they producers?
[02:57:05.129 --> 02:57:07.010]  Just because they inherited something?
[02:57:07.010 --> 02:57:07.651]  No!
[02:57:07.651 --> 02:57:15.015]  In most cases, it's because they were hard-working, they were intelligent people, they had principles, they had self-discipline, and they worked, you know?
[02:57:15.015 --> 02:57:22.560]  Well, you can't have that kind of an individual in a collectivist society, because he doesn't want to give up everything to the collective.
[02:57:22.560 --> 02:57:23.901]  He thinks that he's entitled to...
[02:57:24.261 --> 02:57:26.943]  Undoubtedly, collectivism creates nightmares.
[02:57:26.943 --> 02:57:30.746]  It creates stupid... I mean, I look at Obama supporters on the street.
[02:57:30.746 --> 02:57:31.487]  We go out and interview them.
[02:57:31.487 --> 02:57:32.968]  They literally can hardly talk.
[02:57:32.968 --> 02:57:35.170]  Black, white, Hispanic, I don't care.
[02:57:35.170 --> 02:57:36.331]  And they have dead eyes.
[02:57:36.331 --> 02:57:39.153]  I mean, they really are... I'm sorry.
[02:57:39.153 --> 02:57:41.135]  I didn't know you could stack crap that high.
[02:57:41.135 --> 02:57:42.216]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:57:42.216 --> 02:57:44.478]  These really are sad, pathetic people.
[02:57:44.478 --> 02:57:48.921]  And then so-called intellectuals promote collectivism like, oh, you just don't get it.
[02:57:48.921 --> 02:57:50.302]  It's going to create a utopia.
[02:57:50.302 --> 02:57:51.603]  No, it creates nightmares.
[02:57:52.384 --> 02:57:53.986]  Yeah, these are, these are zombies.
[02:57:53.986 --> 02:57:56.289]  These are intellectual zombies that they rely upon.
[02:57:56.289 --> 02:57:57.731]  There's no question about it.
[02:57:57.731 --> 02:57:58.592]  They're the ones that, that...
[02:57:59.591 --> 02:58:04.856]  Are the first wave that always come and hold the positions in the first wave.
[02:58:04.856 --> 02:58:13.623]  When collectivists come to power, they empty the prisons and take the worst vile criminals and put them in charge of the police and the new prisons.
[02:58:13.623 --> 02:58:16.286]  They're the vile ones that torture.
[02:58:16.286 --> 02:58:22.111]  Oh yeah, now they pretty much only hire felons to be the CPS parents.
[02:58:22.111 --> 02:58:22.771]  That's right.
[02:58:22.771 --> 02:58:23.412]  That's how it works.
[02:58:24.551 --> 02:58:25.731]  That's collectivism.
[02:58:25.731 --> 02:58:26.352]  Unbelievable.
[02:58:26.352 --> 02:58:33.955]  We're going to do a little bit of overdrive and go to Ed, and we're going to go to Anthony, and then we'll try to go to Rusty and a few others straight ahead.
[02:58:33.955 --> 02:58:37.576]  We've got Jason calling about military drills.
[02:58:37.576 --> 02:58:38.657]  We're going to be right back.

[02:59:52.443 --> 02:59:55.267]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.267 --> 03:00:06.304]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.304 --> 03:00:06.905]  Big Brother
[03:00:07.600 --> 03:00:09.361]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:09.361 --> 03:00:11.122]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:11.122 --> 03:00:12.723]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.723 --> 03:00:14.264]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.264 --> 03:00:18.446]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.446 --> 03:00:22.509]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.996 --> 03:00:35.159]  Alright, folks, final segment with G. Edward Griffin of RealityZone.com.
[03:00:35.159 --> 03:00:37.121]  I think this is our best interview ever.
[03:00:37.121 --> 03:00:39.543]  We really are just laying it all out.
[03:00:39.543 --> 03:00:41.544]  Let's try to go as many of your calls as we can.
[03:00:41.544 --> 03:00:44.086]  A question from Ed in Ohio.
[03:00:44.086 --> 03:00:44.887]  Thanks for holding, Ed.
[03:00:44.887 --> 03:00:47.169]  You're on the air.
[03:00:47.169 --> 03:00:50.211]  Alex, Mr. Griffin, y'all may bless you all and your families.
[03:00:50.211 --> 03:00:52.072]  Thank you.
[03:00:52.072 --> 03:00:56.816]  First-time caller, listen to your show every day when you're recapped.
[03:00:58.743 --> 03:01:01.424]  I'm also a member of your prison planet, GotTV.
[03:01:01.424 --> 03:01:01.824]  Thank you.
[03:01:01.824 --> 03:01:02.664]  Couldn't do it without you.
[03:01:02.664 --> 03:01:04.004]  Couldn't do it without you, sir.
[03:01:04.004 --> 03:01:06.965]  Well, hey, I'm a disabled vet.
[03:01:06.965 --> 03:01:08.546]  I served this country.
[03:01:08.546 --> 03:01:09.326]  So did my father.
[03:01:09.326 --> 03:01:12.027]  Gave up half his left lung in Battle of the Bulge.
[03:01:12.027 --> 03:01:12.887]  Had been stoned.
[03:01:12.887 --> 03:01:15.948]  Had a brother POW four years in Vietnam.
[03:01:15.948 --> 03:01:20.209]  I got a cousin who was 101st Airborne in World War II.
[03:01:20.209 --> 03:01:25.891]  The only thing that came back from him was a decorated uniform with his name on it with a flag-draped box.
[03:01:25.891 --> 03:01:27.491]  This is not what they gave their lives for.
[03:01:29.008 --> 03:01:35.372]  This is not what I gave up college to serve my country just so I didn't have to register for Selective Service.
[03:01:35.372 --> 03:01:38.994]  Sir, I am upset and I'm very disappointed.
[03:01:38.994 --> 03:01:40.475]  I love my country.
[03:01:40.475 --> 03:01:41.555]  I love you all.
[03:01:41.555 --> 03:01:43.136]  I love God.
[03:01:43.136 --> 03:01:45.177]  I hate my government.
[03:01:45.177 --> 03:01:46.318]  And I want my country back.
[03:01:47.259 --> 03:01:48.841]  Well, sir, God bless you.
[03:01:48.841 --> 03:01:50.142]  Well, you know, it's not your government.
[03:01:50.142 --> 03:01:50.663]  That's the thing.
[03:01:50.663 --> 03:01:51.464]  It's been hijacked.
[03:01:51.464 --> 03:01:52.665]  But I hear you.
[03:01:52.665 --> 03:01:59.172]  We've got to get the word out that America's been occupied and just do as much as we can to try to fix this peacefully.
[03:01:59.172 --> 03:02:06.980]  GM or Griffin, do you think it's going to be fixed peacefully or are they going to blow stuff up and blame it on us and try to come get us and we're going to have to fight back?
[03:02:06.980 --> 03:02:08.021]  I wish I knew the answer.
[03:02:09.258 --> 03:02:18.806]  My impulse is to say, if it doesn't get fixed peacefully, or relatively peacefully, and that's a weasel word, but I don't think it's going to get fixed with violence.
[03:02:18.806 --> 03:02:20.707]  I don't think it's going to be revolution.
[03:02:20.707 --> 03:02:22.468]  I don't think that's going to work.
[03:02:22.468 --> 03:02:27.753]  It has to be an intellectual revolution first, and then we have to take the ship back.
[03:02:27.753 --> 03:02:33.497]  But I don't think we're going to take it back with guns and bayonets, because they have all the really powerful weapons.
[03:02:33.497 --> 03:02:34.418]  It's as simple as that.
[03:02:35.083 --> 03:02:41.231]  Well, I tend to agree with you at certain levels, but if it's bad guys, I mean, we're not going to have conventional war.
[03:02:41.231 --> 03:02:47.580]  Bad guys that serve the New World Order will just start falling down and hitting their head if they keep persecuting and killing journalists and people.
[03:02:47.580 --> 03:02:48.962]  It's kind of like Fight Club.
[03:02:50.063 --> 03:02:53.126]  You just, you know, everybody's in on resisting it.
[03:02:53.126 --> 03:02:57.049]  I mean, I don't want to brag, but I go everywhere, and the crew's like, this is like Fight Club.
[03:02:57.049 --> 03:03:02.113]  Everybody's walking by, nodding, cops are winking, people are bringing me free food at every restaurant I go to.
[03:03:02.113 --> 03:03:03.034]  I'm not bragging.
[03:03:03.034 --> 03:03:05.796]  I'm just one guy that people are pinging off of.
[03:03:05.796 --> 03:03:08.578]  I can go to England, it's the same deal.
[03:03:08.578 --> 03:03:10.820]  I mean, gee, Edward, I know you're well-known as well.
[03:03:10.820 --> 03:03:13.222]  You've got to have a lot of folks in public come over to you.
[03:03:13.222 --> 03:03:16.645]  Let me tell you, our numbers are big, and people are getting sick of what's going on.
[03:03:17.622 --> 03:03:21.066]  Well, I agree with that, and that's my hope, of course.
[03:03:21.066 --> 03:03:23.088]  It's just, what do those people do?
[03:03:23.088 --> 03:03:36.702]  I have a feeling that if, going back to Nazi Germany, for example, if Nazi Germany had not been knocked out of the saddle by the United States, it might have taken over the world.
[03:03:37.642 --> 03:03:44.465]  I don't know what, I don't think there was any power within Germany itself that could have overthrown the Nazi regime.
[03:03:44.465 --> 03:03:46.066]  It wasn't visible at least.
[03:03:46.066 --> 03:03:51.728]  So that's why I'm questioning whether or not just numbers alone.
[03:03:51.728 --> 03:04:00.932]  Absolutely, when you've got a giant organized military that's willing to die with training and industry behind it, it's hard to beat without another big army.
[03:04:00.932 --> 03:04:06.815]  But I go back to the Nazis almost were able to take out Hitler several times and failed unfortunately.
[03:04:07.515 --> 03:04:18.229]  And they probably ended up poisoning Lennon and they just got something worse, but the point is there will be resistance no matter what happens, particularly if we wake up more people.
[03:04:18.229 --> 03:04:23.957]  But I agree, we better work like the Dickens now to try to really let people know how much trouble we're in.
[03:04:23.957 --> 03:04:24.558]  This isn't a game.
[03:04:24.878 --> 03:04:31.844]  That's true, but your point about Hitler is certainly interesting because if Hitler had been taken out, who would have replaced him?
[03:04:31.844 --> 03:04:35.908]  It would have been Himmel or somebody just as bad, or maybe not as crazy as Hitler.
[03:04:35.908 --> 03:04:39.071]  They didn't object to Hitler's philosophy.
[03:04:39.071 --> 03:04:41.133]  They didn't object to his collectivism.
[03:04:41.133 --> 03:04:42.874]  They objected to his military strategy.
[03:04:42.874 --> 03:04:43.895]  I'm going to put you on the spot.
[03:04:43.895 --> 03:04:45.316]  If you've got to go, you've got to go.
[03:04:45.316 --> 03:04:47.018]  Can you do ten more minutes with us on the other side?
[03:04:47.398 --> 03:04:49.461]  I'm afraid I can't because I have another radio.
[03:04:49.461 --> 03:04:50.542]  I knew it!
[03:04:50.542 --> 03:04:51.683]  I know you do these on days.
[03:04:51.683 --> 03:04:52.805]  You book, book, book.
[03:04:52.805 --> 03:04:54.266]  That's why I figured you'd say no.
[03:04:54.266 --> 03:04:55.548]  But I appreciate the offer.
[03:04:55.548 --> 03:04:55.848]  Thank you.
[03:04:55.848 --> 03:04:56.169]  You bet.
[03:04:56.169 --> 03:04:56.869]  Great job, buddy.
[03:04:56.869 --> 03:04:57.670]  Sorry to the other callers.
[03:04:57.670 --> 03:04:59.873]  Thanks for that last caller.
[03:04:59.873 --> 03:05:00.274]  Back tonight.
