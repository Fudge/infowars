[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:20.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:27.560]  makes you realize that if there's even one thing we can do to keep our children our
[00:27.560 --> 00:31.960]  community safe there's just one step we can take to prevent more families from
[00:31.960 --> 00:39.200]  feeling what they feel after they've lost the level in 2012 there were more
[00:39.200 --> 00:44.360]  blacks aborted in New York City than born which is to say while people will
[00:44.360 --> 00:48.440]  march up and down the streets for high-profile slain's many of those same
[00:48.440 --> 00:51.680]  people don't seem to care that the biggest scourge to their communities
[00:51.680 --> 00:58.000]  isn't gangs or drugs but the right to choose equally chilling is that over 50
[00:58.000 --> 01:03.240]  percent of aborted babies in Georgia are black one of the most visible processors
[01:03.240 --> 01:07.160]  of abortion is Planned Parenthood which was once known as the birth control
[01:07.160 --> 01:12.800]  league a Margaret Sanger organization eugenics movement was once again used
[01:12.800 --> 01:17.320]  by the American birth control league the market singers of those days did not
[01:17.320 --> 01:21.280]  come out and say they were trying to eliminate black people what they did
[01:21.280 --> 01:26.080]  say they were trying to rid society of the feeble minded they were trying to
[01:26.080 --> 01:33.040]  rid the society of the criminal well she was successful simply because of her
[01:33.040 --> 01:40.240]  eugenics friends for the past 50 years had put those labels on minorities and
[01:40.240 --> 01:45.800]  african-americans and therefore society was more or less desensitized in effect
[01:45.800 --> 01:53.120]  the cold words hid the agenda of Margaret Sanger and the eugenics whether
[01:53.120 --> 01:57.360]  your pro-choice or not please be aware that the reason Planned Parenthood
[01:57.360 --> 02:16.720]  buildings are so prevalent in minority neighborhoods is to kill minorities
[02:16.720 --> 02:34.520]  in Mississippi 72% of aborted babies are black the numbers also show that more
[02:34.520 --> 02:38.800]  than a few white children are regularly aborted it's a shame when anyone is
[02:38.800 --> 02:43.400]  murdered even when the murderer happens to be your own mother many women are
[02:43.400 --> 02:48.000]  led to believe that their child isn't a person until it's actually born when do
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.040]  you think life starts yeah well I don't know if it's controversial I don't know
[02:52.040 --> 02:55.800]  that it's really relevant to relevant to the to the conversation but I mean for
[02:55.800 --> 03:01.960]  me I'm a mother of three children for me life began when I delivered them many
[03:01.960 --> 03:05.680]  naysayers will tell you that the majority of Planned Parenthood's operation
[03:05.680 --> 03:10.760]  doesn't involve abortion well can we get rid of the percent that does involve
[03:10.760 --> 03:16.000]  abortion the work of Sanger is still alive and well today with the likes of
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.080]  Mrs. Clinton singing her praises I admire Thomas Jefferson I admire his
[03:21.080 --> 03:27.600]  words and his leadership and I deplore his unrepentant slaveholding I admire
[03:27.600 --> 03:32.040]  Margaret Sanger being a pioneer and trying to empower women to have some
[03:32.040 --> 03:37.480]  control over their bodies and I deplore statements that you have referenced
[03:37.480 --> 03:43.160]  that is the way we often are when we look at flawed human beings there are
[03:43.160 --> 03:48.080]  things that we admire and things we deplore I rarely agree with Mrs. Clinton
[03:48.080 --> 03:51.960]  on anything but she's right to point out that President Jefferson also treated
[03:51.960 --> 03:57.040]  blacks in a less than human fashion he should also be known for the 1807 act
[03:57.040 --> 04:03.400]  prohibiting importation of slaves yes Jefferson was a slaveholder but he
[04:03.400 --> 04:08.440]  included bold anti-slavery language in the original draft of the Declaration of
[04:08.440 --> 04:14.120]  Independence that was removed as president on March 2nd 1807 Jefferson
[04:14.120 --> 04:19.560]  signed the act prohibiting importation of slaves this act took effect in 1808
[04:19.560 --> 04:24.000]  and was the earliest allowed under the Constitution so the next time someone
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.000]  demands that you give up your rights to save just one child remind them that
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.040]  their pro-choice stance has killed a million since Roe v. Wade you can find
[04:34.040 --> 04:41.400]  more reports at info wars.com you have 43% of all abortions performed in this
[04:41.400 --> 04:48.520]  country performed on black babies we're only 12% of the population in the state
[04:48.520 --> 04:54.800]  of New York in 2008 more black babies were aborted than born now doesn't matter
[04:54.800 --> 04:59.560]  what your politics is on that again those numbers though are very troubling

[08:37.440 --> 08:45.600]  we are at DEF CON 1. Are you prepared to destroy the enemy? You bet! Defending the

[09:13.440 --> 09:18.280]  We are in launch mode. Do you really believe that the enemy would attack
[09:18.280 --> 09:23.060]  without provocation? If you are receiving this transmission you are the
[09:23.060 --> 09:28.160]  resistance. We're in. Russians are still denying everything sir. We have a Soviet
[09:28.160 --> 09:32.760]  submarine watch detection. I wish I didn't know about any of this. I wish I was like
[09:32.760 --> 09:49.120]  everybody else. That's a flashback to the 80s in the movie war games where the
[09:49.120 --> 09:54.840]  computer starts to launch a nuclear war on its own and now we have in the last
[09:54.840 --> 09:59.000]  five years autonomous drones where the robots are making the decisions in the
[09:59.000 --> 10:04.680]  air they just declassified that last year that it had been going on for four
[10:04.680 --> 10:08.640]  years before that. We're now five years into it. The British, the French, the
[10:08.640 --> 10:13.800]  United States, all part of the NATO system now are already shifting from
[10:13.800 --> 10:18.880]  pilots controlling the drones who get medals that are more prestigious than
[10:18.880 --> 10:24.840]  Purple Hearts by the way for their valor in the air-conditioned pods in the
[10:24.840 --> 10:31.320]  desert out in places like Arizona and of course places in Maryland they're at
[10:31.320 --> 10:36.840]  CIA headquarters. It's absolutely ridiculous and humans are being taken
[10:36.840 --> 10:40.240]  out of the equation and when you see humans being taken out of the equation
[10:40.240 --> 10:49.360]  you can get total government control of information and this whole missing flight
[10:49.360 --> 10:54.680]  with this Malaysian Airlines that we're now a week and a half into is a giant
[10:54.680 --> 11:00.080]  distraction from the situation and it's continuing to escalate in Ukraine with
[11:00.080 --> 11:05.920]  Russia and the EU with the US in the middle of it. It is distracting from
[11:05.920 --> 11:12.120]  Obamacare being an absolute nightmare and while all this is going on I monitor
[11:12.120 --> 11:15.320]  television and I don't really watch mainline television but I flip through
[11:15.320 --> 11:22.400]  it or I'm in restaurants or I'm at the gym and all I see this morning I was at
[11:22.400 --> 11:27.320]  the gym was Obama they have like 10 TVs in there in front of the bikes and
[11:27.320 --> 11:36.880]  ellipticals and treadmills. Every time I'd look up working out I would see Obama
[11:36.880 --> 11:44.080]  on ESPN chatting it up doing a comedy piece or then I would see Obama on some
[11:44.080 --> 11:48.600]  Comedy Central show with a piece of it playing on the news and then it would be
[11:48.600 --> 11:52.880]  Michelle Obama and then it would be Hillary and it was just all positive
[11:52.880 --> 11:57.960]  news and see they've lost control of the newspapers they've lost control of the
[11:57.960 --> 12:04.560]  online news the mainline dinosaur television is dead I mean the MSNBC
[12:04.560 --> 12:09.160]  CNN is just a total facade literally almost no viewers it's a complete hoax
[12:09.160 --> 12:17.400]  fraud joke everybody knows that but we need to focus more on the fact that
[12:17.400 --> 12:21.800]  about 80% of Americans don't even really watch news that's on record some
[12:21.800 --> 12:27.080]  numbers are even higher closer to 85% they do watch the NFL they do watch NBA
[12:27.080 --> 12:31.280]  they do watch baseball they do watch sitcoms they do watch Comedy Central
[12:31.280 --> 12:37.400]  they do watch all the quote entertainment and it is just loaded with
[12:37.400 --> 12:42.400]  state propaganda and garbage and it's been loaded for a long time since the
[12:42.400 --> 12:45.840]  Cold War that was kind of the excuse to have anti-communist propaganda in there
[12:45.840 --> 12:50.680]  but that set the precedent now to where it's communist propaganda and globalist
[12:50.680 --> 12:59.720]  propaganda and it goes on and on and on movie stars rock stars hip-hop stars
[12:59.720 --> 13:07.400]  you Justin Bieber LeBron James all these low-grade morons up there pushing
[13:07.400 --> 13:13.560]  Obamacare ladies and gentlemen I try to watch any cop drama any sitcom anything
[13:13.560 --> 13:21.480]  it is anti-male anti-family gay agenda and again I'm not even against anybody
[13:21.480 --> 13:29.480]  but my lord you turn on the TV gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay I mean I'm sick
[13:29.480 --> 13:34.600]  of it man I mean I like what Marilyn Monroe looks like but I don't go watch
[13:34.600 --> 13:40.120]  her movies they're most of them are pretty stupid some like it hot's funny but
[13:40.120 --> 13:44.080]  I mean I'm not gonna watch a marathon on Turner classic movies of Marilyn Monroe
[13:44.080 --> 13:50.400]  I sure don't want to watch a marathon of people making jokes against heterosexuals
[13:50.400 --> 13:54.360]  and talking about how great gay people are they folks is becoming a cult trying
[13:54.360 --> 13:57.600]  to dominate society just like every other group becomes a cult throughout
[13:57.600 --> 14:01.480]  history before the Roman Empire collapsed they had gay cults basically
[14:01.480 --> 14:06.280]  running in and I mean it's just a major sign and Camille Paglia there's a
[14:06.280 --> 14:10.160]  lesbians written about this that when all this stuff starts up and gets to this
[14:10.160 --> 14:15.040]  point you get ready for society to collapse the whole Olympics weren't
[14:15.040 --> 14:24.160]  about ice skating or downhill skiing or the ski jump it was all about gay gay
[14:24.160 --> 14:28.240]  gay gay gay gay gay I mean I can't let my children watch any mainline television
[14:28.240 --> 14:32.840]  I can't take them to movies I have to pre-screen everything because they're
[14:32.840 --> 14:36.760]  assaulting them and then the kids out there didn't matter if my kids don't
[14:36.760 --> 14:41.320]  see all this other kids do and and and you would think that there isn't a
[14:41.320 --> 14:45.160]  universe out there there aren't any discoveries it's all just what what
[14:45.160 --> 14:48.760]  Michelle Obama wore today and what Hillary's doing and how great she is
[14:48.760 --> 14:53.560]  and how fantastic everything is and you know in the government and how
[14:53.560 --> 14:57.680]  wonderful Obamacare is and how wonderful tap water is and how wonderful
[14:57.680 --> 15:02.960]  vaccines are and how horrible gun owners are and I mean it is just pure
[15:02.960 --> 15:10.680]  unadulterated sludge and you can tell how propagandized and how sick our
[15:10.680 --> 15:14.720]  society has gotten when you watch television and the guys were able to
[15:14.720 --> 15:18.480]  pull it up he was on Obama I guess was on Sports Center yesterday and they're
[15:18.480 --> 15:22.400]  putting it on every other channel I mean I can't watch sometimes I'm on a
[15:22.400 --> 15:26.400]  business trip you know I'll cover in a story I'll get in at 10 o'clock 11 o'clock
[15:26.400 --> 15:30.440]  from working I'll put on cable try to watch the late night show or try to
[15:30.440 --> 15:34.960]  watch something else it's all about Obama making him a rock star trying to
[15:34.960 --> 15:40.360]  prop up the facade and now Obama they're saying wants to host ESPN is that the
[15:40.360 --> 15:44.720]  headline I just saw Obama I want to host ESPN Sports Center when I retired I
[15:44.720 --> 15:50.200]  mean this is just disgusting and it's all about how he's a regular guy and he's
[15:50.200 --> 15:56.360]  on all these comedy shows and funny or die and it just goes on and on so I
[15:56.360 --> 16:00.640] 've directed years ago my crew who are great people my reporters my investigative
[16:00.640 --> 16:07.520]  journalist writers everybody we need to focus more on the entertainment myself
[16:07.520 --> 16:17.080]  included because we focus on news all day but the way we're going to get to the
[16:17.080 --> 16:23.720]  general public is by hijacking their propaganda stories with Obama and the
[16:23.720 --> 16:30.200]  globalist the rest of it and making fun of it via satire with review shows and
[16:30.200 --> 16:35.760]  again in amongst everything else I'm doing if I had the time and energy that's
[16:35.760 --> 16:38.840]  really my plan is have like a five minute segment every night where I give
[16:38.840 --> 16:43.640]  commentary on the nightly news on entertainment and propaganda and review
[16:43.640 --> 16:49.680]  it and decipher it for people and the problem is isn't finding the propaganda
[16:49.680 --> 16:53.280]  it's like you throw your nets into the ocean and the whole ship starts sinking
[16:53.280 --> 17:00.800]  because there's so many fish in the net I mean it is just an orgy an explosion a
[17:00.800 --> 17:10.040]  flash fire a flash flood of BS and it makes my head spin meanwhile flesh
[17:10.040 --> 17:14.320]  eating bacteria spreading all over the place super diseases are forming GMO is
[17:14.320 --> 17:18.240]  getting into the DNA of humans wrecking our genetics on record cancers off the
[17:18.240 --> 17:23.600]  chart I mean you know we are in a mega crisis humanity is in a mega crisis
[17:23.600 --> 17:33.080]  whether it's real in the economy or not regardless whether it is unsustainable
[17:33.080 --> 17:38.880]  or they're making it unsustainable via 1021 we are going on a civilization
[17:38.880 --> 17:43.680]  level industrial level collapse trajectory guaranteed British Ministry of
[17:43.680 --> 17:53.560]  Defense Pentagon reports NASA reports Harry Dent just Ron Paul myself countless
[17:53.560 --> 18:00.160]  others Harold Salente just everyone knows who actually is studying things
[18:00.160 --> 18:06.240]  that we're on a collision course for incremental lapse and it is engineered
[18:06.240 --> 18:09.960]  didn't agree with me yesterday because it's easier to not manage things well
[18:09.960 --> 18:13.120]  it's easier not to build a Renaissance because you've got uppity informed

[24:36.840 --> 24:40.480]  the same thing goes on here in Austin Texas the mayor threatens to arrest
[24:40.480 --> 24:47.080]  people and and says it like he's the king of the earth if they're not quote
[24:47.080 --> 24:51.200]  polite to him and says it in the real chilling voice you might as well just
[24:51.200 --> 24:54.880]  wear a Darth Vader helmet like the guy from Spaceballs and imagine he's
[24:54.880 --> 24:58.400]  powerful because they're perched on top of us folks they know they have a six
[24:58.400 --> 25:02.800]  percent approval rating and they hope the police his pension funds they've
[25:02.800 --> 25:07.120]  already robbed are going to go along with them while they got everything
[25:07.120 --> 25:11.840]  because freedom threatens them but I see stacks of these articles every day I
[25:11.840 --> 25:16.480]  mean literally a Bridgeport man faces a felony charge after he was arrested by
[25:16.480 --> 25:19.760]  police at a township board meeting when he refused to stop talking past a three
[25:19.760 --> 25:25.120]  minute time limit for public comment he was arrested during the meeting by
[25:25.120 --> 25:28.840]  police officers at reviling the townships three minute time limit for
[25:28.840 --> 25:32.320]  people making public comments and refusing to stop talking when township
[25:32.320 --> 25:37.880]  officials told him to it was the man's 59th birthday according to public
[25:37.880 --> 25:43.080]  records and they're now charging him with felonies for it and there's video
[25:43.080 --> 25:51.880]  now that's been released of the meeting and they just go on to say that he'd
[25:51.880 --> 25:56.040]  file public information act request and they're charging him with a felony so
[25:56.040 --> 25:58.960]  better not go talk or you'll be disappeared and there's video with that
[25:58.960 --> 26:03.160]  now continuing here's another one CBS News Connecticut gun tattoo
[26:03.160 --> 26:08.720]  mistakenly brings heavenly armed police to main man's home they were looking
[26:08.720 --> 26:12.280]  through the window while they trimmed his trees and he was asleep he works at
[26:12.280 --> 26:19.040]  night and saw a tattoo of a gun which by the way last time I checked in Maryland
[26:19.040 --> 26:25.600]  was still legal if you jump through the hoops and the police came a swatting and
[26:25.600 --> 26:33.880]  by the way folks I've told you about the carpet cleaner 15 years ago two carpet
[26:33.880 --> 26:38.800]  cleaners the cleaner and his assistant went in my radio studio at my house at
[26:38.800 --> 26:44.920]  the time and there was a shotgun on the wall didn't have children then pumped
[26:44.920 --> 26:51.720]  shotgun Winchester Defender $300 shotgun and they freaked out and the guy said I
[26:51.720 --> 26:56.480]  can't do this and left and call the police on me because that gun was illegal
[26:56.480 --> 27:02.920]  of course it wasn't illegal but they don't care that's how America works you
[27:02.920 --> 27:06.840]  people all over Texas I know who have big ranches small ranches you name it I
[27:06.840 --> 27:10.000]  don't care to live in the middle of nowhere the police are coming when you
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.560]  shoot because the Californians have now colonized us and they rule with an iron
[27:15.560 --> 27:19.920]  fist of power they see you yell at your kid when they're out in the street or
[27:19.920 --> 27:25.720]  spank them that's not against the law CPS is coming and if they can they're
[27:25.720 --> 27:31.120]  gonna sell your kid down the river and put him on a bunch of drugs because they
[27:31.120 --> 27:36.720]  rule this is their country now and they love the government of using them they
[27:36.720 --> 27:40.280]  love tripling and health care prices they love death panels because LeBron
[27:40.280 --> 27:46.400]  James said so and just like the man we're showing on screen clearly doesn't
[27:46.400 --> 27:52.040]  resist him the police like in a third-world dictatorship grabbing drag him
[27:52.040 --> 27:55.920]  out and charge him with a felony and let me tell you they'll get a jury in that
[27:55.920 --> 28:03.040]  town to put him in jail for 10 years and then their neighbors would put them in
[28:03.040 --> 28:08.720]  jail too because they like it they want this country to go down they want to
[28:08.720 --> 28:15.960]  process out the window and they're gonna get it gun tattoo mistakenly brings
[28:15.960 --> 28:19.480]  heavily armed police to main man's home that's like the person that was eating
[28:19.480 --> 28:23.120]  the pastry and it looked like the shape of a gun to the other kids and the
[28:23.120 --> 28:28.960]  police came they responded to the pink pastry here's another article student
[28:28.960 --> 28:33.480]  arrested expelled for pocket knife found in car during a routine search at the
[28:33.480 --> 28:37.800]  martial law facility yeah I remember cases of valor Victorians and people
[28:37.800 --> 28:41.640]  that had their degrees stripped because on the last day of school they brought a
[28:41.640 --> 28:48.160]  package of Dixie knives forks and spoons the one girl got caught bringing a pie
[28:48.160 --> 28:52.040]  to her teacher was having an after-school party with her teachers and
[28:52.040 --> 28:57.080]  the school police officer walked in and saw the Dixie butter knife that has a
[28:57.080 --> 29:01.880]  serrated edge and needles to say she went to appeals court over and got it
[29:01.880 --> 29:05.440]  reversed and was able to keep her degree I remember that this is total
[29:05.440 --> 29:09.520]  mind control folks this is America the banks are stealing trillions were wide
[29:09.520 --> 29:13.120]  open the government ships in the narcotics publicly but of the valor

[33:11.640 --> 33:15.160]  crashing through the lies and disinformation
[33:15.160 --> 33:21.640]  it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[33:21.640 --> 33:29.880]  last week aries armor that makes lower receivers for ar-15s
[33:30.520 --> 33:34.680]  got a injunction against the atf rating them
[33:34.680 --> 33:38.440]  without warrants and taking their customer less than seizing
[33:38.440 --> 33:43.800]  uh their gun parts because i mean i've had all the top experts on what they're
[33:43.800 --> 33:48.040]  doing is totally legal and lawful but the atf you know does stuff like if
[33:48.040 --> 33:52.360]  if a semi-auto gun misfires and fires two rounds
[33:52.360 --> 33:55.000]  at a shooting range they have the shooting range people tattle on them and
[33:55.000 --> 33:58.120]  then they come and swat team their house and put them in jail for five years
[33:58.120 --> 34:01.320]  and it doesn't matter if the court even admits no these guns can malfunction and
[34:01.320 --> 34:03.640]  shoot two bullets doesn't matter you're going to jail
[34:03.640 --> 34:07.640]  because the number one mission is wreck good people get good people in prison
[34:07.640 --> 34:12.520]  destroy america shut down the power plants ship the jobs overseas bring in
[34:12.520 --> 34:16.200]  poor unskilled labor drive down the wages the new world order wants to break
[34:16.200 --> 34:21.320]  america and it is and as things get worse and worse they tell the police
[34:21.320 --> 34:24.680]  oh you got to get even tougher on the public you got to get even more revenue
[34:24.680 --> 34:27.880]  because everything's collapsing and so they get even harder with the public
[34:27.880 --> 34:31.720]  and squeeze even more all by loving new world order
[34:31.720 --> 34:34.680]  design because they've done this in the third world over and over again
[34:34.680 --> 34:38.040]  the globalists are quite public about what they're doing
[34:38.040 --> 34:41.480]  so aries armor is going to be joining us for 30 minutes
[34:41.480 --> 34:44.440]  via video skype on the road because they're going to court
[34:44.440 --> 34:46.760]  so that should be interesting we'll see how that goes
[34:46.760 --> 34:52.040]  then the green family legally and lawfully was producing medical marijuana
[34:52.040 --> 34:55.720]  something george washington did he produced hemp that has no thc
[34:55.720 --> 35:00.680]  for ship sails and for rope and then he also produced what they called the
[35:00.680 --> 35:04.280]  toothache weed because they told you to smoke it when you had a toothache or
[35:04.280 --> 35:07.720]  a stomachache the apothecary's bought it and he sold it
[35:07.720 --> 35:13.320]  those bills of laving and payments from before he was the head of the u.s
[35:13.320 --> 35:16.760]  military the founder of the army and then after he retired from being president
[35:16.760 --> 35:21.080]  it's famous you know the this everything he did the sales of corn and
[35:21.080 --> 35:25.160]  cotton and tobacco and uh different types of hemp
[35:25.160 --> 35:28.360]  and so for what george washington did that was totally legal
[35:28.360 --> 35:32.200]  the cps admitted that oh no you're allowed to grow medical marijuana you
[35:32.200 --> 35:36.200]  got the licenses and everything we're going to take your kids though
[35:36.200 --> 35:39.480]  and i want to warn everybody that you know let's say you're pregnant
[35:39.480 --> 35:44.040]  you're at a party uh literally you smell some marijuana that's enough to give
[35:44.040 --> 35:46.680]  you a positive they're not going to tell you when you go to the hospital to have
[35:46.680 --> 35:49.000]  your kid or when they test your blood months before
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.280]  that they're going to take them with cps once they get them there
[35:52.280 --> 35:55.320]  and then when your kids all screwed up at h2 with sores all over them in some
[35:55.320 --> 35:57.800]  government facility they're going to put them on antipsychotics and brain
[35:57.800 --> 36:01.000]  damage them and then when they sucked all the money out of your daughter or
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.240]  son that you never saw again they're going to throw them out on the street
[36:03.240 --> 36:06.120]  when they're 18 to be one of these zombies that wanders around talking to
[36:06.120 --> 36:08.520]  themselves because they're the loving government
[36:08.520 --> 36:12.760]  now can then let me continue though with everything they lovingly do
[36:12.760 --> 36:16.920]  uh the green family had their children taken
[36:16.920 --> 36:23.160]  freebabybreed.com uh because of the fact that they were growing medical
[36:23.160 --> 36:28.520]  marijuana the cps said get this someone might want to rob you
[36:28.520 --> 36:33.960]  because you have a greenhouse of marijuana so if i drive a nice car
[36:33.960 --> 36:37.640]  or i live in a nice house will they take my children well the answer is yes
[36:37.640 --> 36:41.800]  that's actually who they target but it isn't robbers coming
[36:41.800 --> 36:45.960]  it's it's child molesting plot bellies known as cps
[36:45.960 --> 36:49.640]  on average the highest rate of child molestation just departments own numbers
[36:49.640 --> 36:53.480]  i mean who do you think wants that job people that like
[36:53.480 --> 37:00.040]  to grab your kid and throw him in a car they don't do it in wide vans anymore
[37:00.040 --> 37:02.840]  now am i saying all of the social workers are bad no most of the people
[37:02.840 --> 37:06.120]  that help old people most of social workers i've run into that help
[37:06.120 --> 37:09.080]  college students or whatever extra to be nice people
[37:09.080 --> 37:12.040]  cps is the highest turnover of any state or federal job
[37:12.040 --> 37:15.400]  50 plus percent a year on average because a lot of good people get into it
[37:15.400 --> 37:19.720]  and find out it's a dirty racket there are quotas on kids
[37:19.720 --> 37:23.400]  and we're going to be talking about that with that family uh coming up
[37:23.400 --> 37:29.960]  in the third hour are you next
[37:29.960 --> 37:32.760]  i can't tell you how many times i've been at martin springs
[37:32.760 --> 37:38.600]  or in a restaurant or in a movie theater
[37:39.320 --> 37:43.320]  and heard people talk about how their neighbor or their friend or their
[37:43.320 --> 37:49.480]  brother or the sister or them how they've lost their child
[37:49.480 --> 37:53.000]  their newborn child and their other children that they had in some cases
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.480]  because they got a positive marijuana and it's upwards of 20 30 percent can be
[37:57.480 --> 38:00.600]  a false positive no judge no jury your kids are gone
[38:00.600 --> 38:04.200]  there's no lightening up on marijuana laws folks they're going to send the
[38:04.200 --> 38:09.080]  social workers after all the potheds and george soros is out there promoting it
[38:09.080 --> 38:12.680]  because he wants you stoned out of your brain
[38:12.680 --> 38:16.280]  let me tell you folks pot's so strong now he's in the psychotropic class
[38:16.280 --> 38:20.120]  people that i know that smoke it are zombies
[38:20.120 --> 38:26.120]  it literally impairs their function this is not your grandparents marijuana this
[38:26.120 --> 38:29.240]  is not your george washington's marijuana now that said i'm for total
[38:29.240 --> 38:33.160]  decriminalization you can go get high off stuff that's in your
[38:33.160 --> 38:37.480]  chemical aisle there's stuff i mean i can get a plant book
[38:37.480 --> 38:41.480]  right now it barns a noble fact i have them and then go out into the woods of
[38:41.480 --> 38:45.080]  central texas like an apothecary they call it a
[38:45.080 --> 38:49.880]  witch a thousand years ago and i could pick plants that would get me
[38:49.880 --> 38:53.800]  bombed out of my brain hallucinating you want me to listen for you
[38:53.800 --> 39:01.000]  buck eyes silver nightshade black nightshade mistletoe
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.440]  would you like me to continue by the way if you take too much of some of that
[39:04.440 --> 39:08.840]  will make your heart explode so folks don't take it
[39:09.800 --> 39:12.680]  you can go read the old recipes on how to cook it and let me tell you when you
[39:12.680 --> 39:15.320]  cook it in the black pot you're going to want to run around with the witches in
[39:15.320 --> 39:18.840]  a circle with the room between your legs because you're going to be
[39:18.840 --> 39:25.880]  hallucinating full out i've read about it now the point here is that
[39:25.880 --> 39:30.200]  you're never going to stop listen i've watched blue jays growing up
[39:30.200 --> 39:35.800]  go and get ripe china berries when they're green that they're not alcoholic
[39:35.800 --> 39:40.040]  but when they turn yellow and soft they have alcohol in them and the birds eat
[39:40.040 --> 39:45.560]  them till they get so drunk they fall over where is the government agency to
[39:45.560 --> 39:50.440]  stop the blue jays getting drunk throw them in jail right now
[39:50.440 --> 39:54.920]  you know how many animals you know you know dolphins eat
[39:54.920 --> 39:59.560]  poisonous puffer fish to get high the question is are you going to arrest the
[39:59.560 --> 40:02.840]  dolphin i think we should actually we should have
[40:02.840 --> 40:06.680]  like the dea and scuba tanks in the water
[40:06.680 --> 40:10.280]  and you know when they catch a dolphin
[40:10.280 --> 40:17.480]  and there's the headline docks reveals dolphins chew pass around puffer fish to
[40:17.480 --> 40:20.600]  experience high and see they're smart they don't eat the whole thing it'll kill
[40:20.600 --> 40:23.960]  them they just chew on it get a little bit of cyanide
[40:23.960 --> 40:31.320]  nothing like a cyanide high boys and girls
[40:31.320 --> 40:35.800]  oh the world is so incredible ladies and gentlemen
[40:35.800 --> 40:40.760]  anyways just because i'm for decriminalizing marijuana
[40:40.760 --> 40:44.600]  doesn't mean i like the culture it's creating if it is some people who can
[40:44.600 --> 40:48.040]  handle it at night like alcohol it's better than alcohol and average
[40:48.040 --> 40:51.320]  doesn't kill your liver has a lot of good medical effects what's it's a
[40:51.320 --> 40:53.400]  magic plant it really is one of the most
[40:53.400 --> 40:57.000]  wondrous plants out there probably the most wondrous
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.920]  and it certainly does help people that have glaucoma
[41:00.920 --> 41:05.480]  who can't eat who are on chemotherapy i mean it's got hundreds of uses
[41:05.480 --> 41:08.920]  my issue is that doesn't mean then i endorse it
[41:08.920 --> 41:12.360]  as a panacea with the whole Denver culture
[41:12.360 --> 41:16.120]  of being so stoned you don't know who you are anymore
[41:16.120 --> 41:19.800]  and you don't work anymore and you just get
[41:19.800 --> 41:23.000]  sure there are a lot of high-strung type of personalities that
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.560]  you know nine o'clock at night kids are in bed
[41:25.560 --> 41:29.560]  go in their bedroom fire up a you know marijuana cigarette take a few hits off
[41:29.560 --> 41:32.840]  of it and it's in every study better than prozac in every
[41:32.840 --> 41:35.640]  study better than aterol and every study it
[41:35.640 --> 41:39.960]  they're coming out with the cannabinoids and things in pills for kids that are
[41:39.960 --> 41:43.080]  hyperactive and it's having wondrous effects but that's because it's a very
[41:43.080 --> 41:47.000]  low dose folks it's a lot better than putting kids on aterol
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  and prozac you know stuff that'll eat their brain
[41:51.000 --> 41:55.320]  and i'm not even saying that's good but i'm digressing
[41:55.320 --> 41:59.960]  there is a lot of news to cover and get to but but while all this is going on
[41:59.960 --> 42:03.720]  our culture is converting into a total tyranny and i want to tell you a story
[42:03.720 --> 42:07.880]  now before i get to this article that's up on info wars dot com
[42:07.880 --> 42:14.200]  it's top story on drudge principal who told kids not to speak spanish
[42:14.200 --> 42:18.280]  will lose job this is in south texas the hempstead school board
[42:18.280 --> 42:21.320]  won't review the contract for principal who instructed her students not to speak
[42:21.320 --> 42:25.480]  spanish in a rapidly evolving district yes 60 plus
[42:25.480 --> 42:28.920]  percent of the kids in texas or hispanic and a large percentage of them
[42:28.920 --> 42:31.880]  do not even speak english
[42:32.440 --> 42:36.440]  i'm gonna explain why that's not good like many texas schools
[42:36.440 --> 42:39.960]  are now hispanic again it goes on to say half the students like many texas
[42:39.960 --> 42:42.600]  schools are now hispanic you mean from mexico
[42:42.600 --> 42:47.080]  mexican colonization hempstead middle school principal amy lacy
[42:47.080 --> 42:49.800]  was placed on paid administrative leave in december after reportedly
[42:49.800 --> 42:53.000]  announcing via intercom that students were not to speak spanish on the school's
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.840]  campus the hispanic population of the rural area roughly 50 miles northeast
[42:56.840 --> 43:00.600]  of houston is growing quickly and latino advocates say that it's
[43:00.600 --> 43:03.800]  important to allow spanish public schools let me explain what happens
[43:03.800 --> 43:07.320]  once the conversions made you can't wear american flags
[43:07.320 --> 43:10.360]  it's offensive and that's all over the country from texas to california their
[43:10.360 --> 43:15.400]  band as a gang symbol you cannot have the
[43:15.400 --> 43:18.360]  saluting of the flag anymore you can't have any of that it's the mexican flag
[43:18.360 --> 43:21.720]  that's come out you can't have the flag at the local church you can't have the
[43:21.720 --> 43:26.040]  flag at a local otter part store or or at the
[43:26.040 --> 43:29.880]  post office it gets pulled down you've seen that i've seen the the the the
[43:29.880 --> 43:33.480]  immigration parades in austin folks it's not hispanic americans it's he
[43:33.480 --> 43:36.760]  legals with mexican flags saying mexico mexico mexico
[43:36.760 --> 43:41.240]  plan of san diego plan of san diego i mean i don't see the clan marching
[43:41.240 --> 43:45.640]  saying kill all blacks or hispanics above the age of 16
[43:45.640 --> 43:50.280]  the plan of san diego i mean wearing t-shirts saying plan of san diego
[43:50.280 --> 43:53.400]  plan i'm like wow you're saying you want to kill me and then they'll have guys
[43:53.400 --> 43:58.520]  that are running it from ut one of the guys looks just like uh like
[43:58.520 --> 44:00.600]  poncho v he does the whole same mustache everything i run to him
[44:00.600 --> 44:04.040]  repeatedly he goes that's right gringo we're going to kill you i mean i
[44:04.040 --> 44:07.800]  video this stuff and and and there and i mean and it's like we're
[44:07.800 --> 44:13.000]  going to kill you mexico kill whites kill whites kill whites kill whites kill
[44:13.000 --> 44:19.160]  kill kill kill kill and and i'm sitting there watching this unfold
[44:19.160 --> 44:22.360]  seeing this going to make national news about the plan of san diego when i
[44:22.360 --> 44:26.680]  showed the people leading it saying plan of san diego overthrow the u.s in
[44:26.680 --> 44:30.600]  texas kill all whites above the age of 16
[44:30.600 --> 44:34.280]  now the point is is that
[44:34.360 --> 44:38.200]  hispanic americans just like all americans but are super hard work in
[44:38.200 --> 44:41.240]  great patriotic people and listeners of the show
[44:41.240 --> 44:46.360]  it's the issue of mexico is a collapsed failed kleptocracy
[44:46.360 --> 44:50.520]  that is literally going into the stone age and collapsing
[44:50.520 --> 44:53.880]  and then we're supposed i mean yeah the french had texas
[44:53.880 --> 44:57.080]  and i mean the it's the six flags of texas folks
[44:57.080 --> 45:01.080]  the russians had california i mean do you see the russians showing up saying
[45:01.080 --> 45:05.880]  you stole it a few spanish missions in california
[45:06.360 --> 45:11.640]  a few missions in texas i mean you know there was a reason the mexicans
[45:11.640 --> 45:14.360]  didn't colonize texas folks it was because the commands he would kill
[45:14.360 --> 45:18.600]  them so the mexican government called
[45:18.600 --> 45:22.680]  in the tennesseeans that had just wiped out in a war
[45:22.680 --> 45:26.840]  a hundred thousand native americans which by the way they were losing the war
[45:26.840 --> 45:30.120]  for a long time it didn't like all the wild west
[45:30.120 --> 45:33.800]  movies where it's all in the 1880s or 1870s where you know they're hunting down
[45:33.800 --> 45:37.720]  some apaches in in arizona no no no no i mean
[45:37.720 --> 45:42.200]  hundred thousand man armies pouring down out of illinois
[45:42.200 --> 45:47.800]  led by free-booting white pirates you name it you know quote the half breed
[45:47.800 --> 45:50.760]  whatever his name was and you know that's the quote in the history books
[45:50.760 --> 45:54.840]  you know six foot and eight chair swung battle club you know and
[45:54.840 --> 45:57.480]  sam houston death battle i mean it was just like
[45:57.480 --> 46:00.840]  just like people with arrows all sticking out of them whole cities burned
[46:00.840 --> 46:04.040]  mass slaughter there's no movies about that it's the most
[46:04.040 --> 46:07.800]  infabulous stuff you could ever imagine ladies and gentlemen and i mean not in a
[46:07.800 --> 46:10.600]  good way i mean beyond colonia and the barbarian stuff
[46:10.600 --> 46:14.680]  okay and the mexicans went uh bring those people
[46:14.680 --> 46:18.520]  down here have them kill the indians
[46:18.520 --> 46:22.120]  and that's what happened full on absolute slaughter
[46:22.120 --> 46:26.680]  on both sides now more often than not people ended up intermarrying that's
[46:26.680 --> 46:31.320]  why most people in oklahoma or east texas are native american
[46:31.320 --> 46:35.800]  that there's almost no one unless it's the old rich 2020 families
[46:35.800 --> 46:39.480]  that aren't part native american i got native american all over
[46:39.480 --> 46:43.080]  on every side of my dad's family all of them
[46:43.080 --> 46:47.960]  come man she uh just a whole bunch of other groups
[46:47.960 --> 46:50.520]  um every time i try to remember all the different groups one of them is the ones
[46:50.520 --> 46:54.840]  that got sent to florida and then one of those moments what is
[46:54.840 --> 46:57.720]  what's the one that's the main dominant group in oklahoma that's what i can even
[46:57.720 --> 47:02.360]  tell you cherokee there you go cherokee the whole point is it's all over the
[47:02.360 --> 47:05.480]  place so it so it isn't just like the history books told you
[47:05.480 --> 47:09.000]  but the point is texas does not belong to mexico
[47:09.000 --> 47:12.520]  let's just get that straight who conquered it people from tennessee
[47:12.520 --> 47:18.520]  and alabama and virginia conquered it and then the death toll is is is in the
[47:18.520 --> 47:21.480]  hundreds of thousands on both sides okay
[47:21.480 --> 47:24.920]  so let's just get that straight and by the way the french were always
[47:24.920 --> 47:28.280]  and or the british would flip flop and combine forces she'd have british or
[47:28.280 --> 47:33.560]  french armies leading armies of natives and the natives would come to you this
[47:33.560 --> 47:36.360]  isn't in the movies and i'm not demonizing the natives this is the
[47:36.360 --> 47:39.800]  history they would come and say if you do not
[47:39.800 --> 47:43.400]  join us to have war party on the such and such is
[47:43.400 --> 47:46.920]  we will burn your cities
[47:47.960 --> 47:52.280]  okay we'll help you kill them i mean you know this is why the natives could be
[47:52.280 --> 47:56.200]  beaten even though they were outnumbered the whites and were just as warlike
[47:56.200 --> 48:00.040]  and vicious as the whites who were just about the most vicious people
[48:00.040 --> 48:03.640]  ever seen by the way historically after that point
[48:03.640 --> 48:06.840]  i mean europeans just constantly were in war folks
[48:06.840 --> 48:10.840]  totally warlike so the whole point is is that this
[48:10.840 --> 48:17.960]  this was a giant swashbuckling war and the the language of the world just
[48:17.960 --> 48:22.360]  talk about what's happening outside houston is english the british empire
[48:22.360 --> 48:26.120]  conquered the world in international space
[48:26.120 --> 48:30.280]  communications you speak english the internet's in english it's not chinese
[48:30.280 --> 48:33.000]  even though there's a billion three hundred million chinese it's not indian
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.320]  even though there's a billion two hundred million indians
[48:35.320 --> 48:39.240]  it's english folks so it is a detriment
[48:39.240 --> 48:42.360]  let me tell you if the world language was spanish folks
[48:42.360 --> 48:45.000]  we would be speaking and a lot of people speak spanish because there was a big
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.600]  empire a lot of folks speak portuguese it was a big empire
[48:48.600 --> 48:51.320]  there are a lot of people speak dutch it was a big empire but you know how they
[48:51.320 --> 48:58.440]  all communicate with each other english english english the race pimps
[48:58.440 --> 49:05.800]  want to keep hispanics on the plantation only speaking spanish
[49:05.800 --> 49:08.680]  and literally as the mexican government calls them
[49:08.680 --> 49:13.800]  peons and you look at the mexican congress they look on average more white
[49:13.800 --> 49:16.360]  than our congress i mean pull up the mexican congress
[49:16.360 --> 49:21.320]  everybody's about six foot five and uh you know a bunch of them have got
[49:21.320 --> 49:24.120]  blonde hair and blue eyes or they're about six five like the
[49:24.120 --> 49:29.240]  centay fox and look like a spaniard those people never bred with the indians
[49:29.240 --> 49:33.480]  never touched them and are just as racist as anybody ever was
[49:33.480 --> 49:36.600]  in fact i've got to say about the mexican ruling class
[49:36.600 --> 49:42.040]  they've been more elitist than the anglos that intermarried with the indians
[49:42.040 --> 49:49.720]  so there's your fact i am personally completely sick and tired of all of this
[49:49.720 --> 49:56.440]  crud knowing history it's so frustrating and the principal is right
[49:56.440 --> 49:59.960]  that you need to have one language imagine going to mexico
[49:59.960 --> 50:05.000]  and saying hi make your school bilingual they would laugh at you
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.640]  no one imagine going to germany and saying you're going to have this and
[50:07.640 --> 50:11.960]  always they would laugh at you or austria or switzerland
[50:11.960 --> 50:16.200]  only in england only in the u.s is this joke because they want to bring in
[50:16.200 --> 50:19.240]  foreign populations and create them in little subdivisions that are
[50:19.240 --> 50:24.920]  controlled and vulcanized to play them off against the domestic population
[50:24.920 --> 50:29.160]  so there's the rest of the story that's what's going on
[50:29.160 --> 50:32.840]  and hollywood doesn't want to make a movie
[50:33.800 --> 50:37.160]  do you know how many grave sites i've gone to we've got an old family
[50:37.160 --> 50:42.920]  cemetery in east texas and another one how many of them say killed by indians
[50:43.400 --> 50:46.600]  i mean you go in these cemeteries it's like a third of a third of the grave
[50:46.600 --> 50:51.640]  stones are killed killed and killed and scouted by indians killed by indians
[50:51.640 --> 50:55.640]  you'll see a whole family lined up killed by indians
[50:55.640 --> 50:58.440]  people go oh they were fighting evil white men no they were killing indians
[50:58.440 --> 51:02.280]  more than they were killing whites we are not here to scare you

[54:16.200 --> 54:19.320]  what's happening ladies and gentlemen
[54:19.320 --> 54:25.640]  is they're getting rid of the news system and journalism in this country
[54:25.640 --> 54:29.320]  they got mainstream media to discredit themselves
[54:29.320 --> 54:33.160]  by selling out then they lost their viewers now they're being basically
[54:33.160 --> 54:37.880]  shut down and turned to cooking shows on CNN and MSNBC
[54:37.880 --> 54:40.680]  and race porn
[54:41.640 --> 54:45.160]  and government worship porn
[54:45.160 --> 54:50.120]  and now they're phasing out
[54:51.400 --> 54:57.240]  entirely access to press conferences with all the talking head
[54:57.240 --> 55:03.400]  teleprompter bobbles like obozo and that's in the examiner ap
[55:03.400 --> 55:07.960]  photographer Hitch Whitehouse once we lose access we'll never get it back
[55:07.960 --> 55:11.640]  you already lost access to being a journalist when you started parroting
[55:11.640 --> 55:16.520]  whatever the liar in chief said well obama says you can keep your
[55:16.520 --> 55:19.480]  doctor doesn't matter you're losing them
[55:19.480 --> 55:25.080]  reality is whatever obama says you guys are very nice but please
[55:25.080 --> 55:29.080]  don't give me almonds during a three-minute break
[55:29.080 --> 55:31.640]  hard to talk once you've been eating almonds those are good almonds by the
[55:31.640 --> 55:34.360]  way kind of racist though
[55:34.360 --> 55:39.160]  seattle said ban brown bags it's racist to say the word brown
[55:39.160 --> 55:42.520]  and don't say bossy that hurts women's fault
[55:42.520 --> 55:47.560]  that makes them feel bad i mean i say this stuff and it sounds like crazy satire
[55:47.560 --> 55:52.120]  it's real don't say bossy racist anti-woman
[55:52.120 --> 55:56.040]  don't say brown bag so i make a joke about
[55:56.040 --> 55:59.160]  don't say brown almond
[55:59.480 --> 56:02.520]  in the latest media charge that the white house has
[56:02.520 --> 56:08.920]  reneged on promises to be transparent they reneged on promises no two of ap's
[56:08.920 --> 56:12.840]  white house staff told a convention in denver this week that's the president's
[56:12.840 --> 56:16.680]  team of often bars coverage of obama events
[56:16.680 --> 56:20.760]  because they are hypersensitive about his image
[56:20.760 --> 56:25.160]  hypersensitive yeah they only put him in pure fiction programs now
[56:25.160 --> 56:28.120]  see they don't need you anymore because folks discovered you were a fiction
[56:28.120 --> 56:31.400]  media so now he's just going directly to fiction
[56:31.400 --> 56:35.240]  and people that suspend disbelief and watch jimmy kimmel
[56:35.240 --> 56:43.960]  and watch espn and they sit there and they watch it and that's what they do
[56:43.960 --> 56:47.960]  at the newspaper association of america media exchange convention in denver
[56:47.960 --> 56:52.760]  ap white house photographer charles dharpak
[56:52.760 --> 56:55.640]  dharapak said that instead of telling reporters
[56:55.640 --> 57:00.520]  photographers at a major news event like the president's recent meeting with
[57:00.520 --> 57:05.080]  alilama it is issuing virtual press releases
[57:05.080 --> 57:09.800]  on social media well yeah that's the whole point
[57:10.360 --> 57:14.360]  because journalists are supposed to fair it out is it a lie
[57:14.360 --> 57:17.560]  or what's the rest of the story or what did somebody else say about it
[57:17.560 --> 57:21.160]  but you wouldn't do that you would just repeat it and become what the system
[57:21.160 --> 57:26.760]  calls repeaters so why would they need you anymore
[57:26.760 --> 57:32.440]  now that they have the digital age you were no longer an individual you no
[57:32.440 --> 57:36.680]  longer gave commentary you no longer
[57:37.560 --> 57:42.760]  made them bounce their fraud off reality you no longer reality tested
[57:42.760 --> 57:48.920]  so you destroyed yourself and almost all of you are now losing your jobs
[57:48.920 --> 57:52.120]  as matt drudge in 1999 or whatever it was on c-span
[57:52.120 --> 57:56.920]  by the way i want to find that press conference he did at the press club and
[57:56.920 --> 57:59.720]  play that because i remember when he said that in the media
[57:59.720 --> 58:02.200]  laughed at him
[58:04.600 --> 58:08.440]  i want to find that sometime this week or next week we'll find it now
[58:08.440 --> 58:11.240]  matt drudge at the national press club and then play that and see who's
[58:11.240 --> 58:13.800]  laughing now
[58:15.400 --> 58:21.160]  by the way it they're still in denial that they're collapsing now
[58:21.160 --> 58:26.440]  when they've already collapsed so there you go
[58:26.440 --> 58:30.120]  i mean now the media consists of low-grade morons
[58:30.120 --> 58:34.520]  like lebron james and justin bebler running around promoting whatever obama
[58:34.520 --> 58:37.160]  pushes i mean that's what we're reduced to ladies
[58:37.160 --> 58:40.920]  and gentlemen it must
[58:40.920 --> 58:44.200]  thank you for listening to it must be true because
[58:44.200 --> 58:48.440]  visit gcmi.com today the movie star said so i mean come on
[58:48.440 --> 58:51.720]  get your health care now in the last 50 years
[58:51.720 --> 58:54.840]  iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[58:54.840 --> 58:58.120]  and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice
[58:58.120 --> 59:03.000]  now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in a halogen family
[59:03.000 --> 59:06.920]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924
[59:06.920 --> 59:11.240]  the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to
[59:11.240 --> 59:15.320]  add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table
[59:15.320 --> 59:20.760]  and the results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase
[59:20.760 --> 59:23.640]  in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[59:23.640 --> 59:29.000]  bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base
[59:29.000 --> 59:33.080]  nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family you will find

[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.600]  snaps his arm some attempt to justify officer's
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.760]  action we're going to play some of that audio and video
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:16.120]  right now but you can watch the video for yourself it's only 37 seconds long
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.240]  shocking video has emerged of a campus police officer
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.760]  violently breaking a student's arm as he screams out in agony
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.640]  during an incident at a west brook high school bowmont texas
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:32.760]  footage of the incident shows squabbles breaking out before a female officer
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.400]  grabs a male student and hauls him to the ground
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:40.440]  aided by officer steven rivers as the female officer presses the student's
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:44.840]  face the ground rivers grabs the arm and violently bends it backwards
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.280]  in what appears to be a deliberate attempt to snap the bone
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.120]  well yeah it's an attack dog deal i mean i had i did not resist
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:57.160]  george w bush and the state police and the and the texas rangers they had there
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:01.320]  as a security and two of them
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.600]  i asked the question at the end of the speech he was supposed to give a press
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:08.040]  conference he'd been given the speech for months same stupid speech
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.120]  and i said what about the federal reserve it's going to bankrupt the
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.520]  country the new world order end up the issue governor right for him for
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.080]  president and he looks at them they come over they grab me
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.600]  they push me out of the building i don't resist and then they crank my arm
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:22.920]  all the way back up my fist the middle of my back and to this day i have a
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.560]  little bit of terror in my rotator cuff if i roll over at night it's
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.960]  excruciatingly painful little gift and they you know they
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.680]  taught me in america uh that you know you do not ask a question
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.880]  to press conference and and and you know this kid is clearly not
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.560]  resisting and it panics you when a woman jumps on top of you and is sitting on
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.440]  your head and then they come over and they break your arm i mean it's a
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.200]  standard deal he's lucky to have eight cops jump on him and kill him
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.040]  or brain damaging like the kid outside austin comes over pushes the girls
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:55.720]  aside standing there a taser him hits his head he's brain damage can't talk
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.280]  now they're going to give those cops probably
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:02.120]  medals or something want congressional medal of honor something
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.960]  so it's this militarized attitude a full force on somebody
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.800]  automatically oh but you can't paddle the kids
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.400]  or make them run laps when they're bad which actually works
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:17.240]  shouldn't even give you a bruise but hurts
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:21.240]  no no you can't dominate them early on to make them behave no no then you just
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:28.280]  break their arms you just taser them and they have a heart attack
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.320]  i mean this is insane
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.920]  i'm not even going to tell stories about high school they're too unbelievable
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.160]  but
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.840]  things have certainly changed and then let me tell you your kids in a public
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:44.040]  school they're in a prison and they've got a good i mean they're going to be
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.760]  shot up with deadly shots they're going to be given gmo food
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.480]  they're going to be surveilled tracked and the good chances they're going to end
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.440]  up being put in the juvie because that's all it is is a funnel into the
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.680]  prison system on record that's not even debated
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:04:05.400]  let's go to the audio and video of this
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:10.200]  so he is trying to get away right there
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.760]  and so
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.560]  like pray trying to get away from a predator

[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:28.520]  i guess the cop doesn't know that joints don't bend that way
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:34.040]  there goes the arm
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:38.920]  now you know to me it doesn't look like the cops deliberately trying to do it
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.400]  i just don't think the cops even looking at what he's doing
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:45.640]  he's just twisting the arm in the old direction definitely with the state
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:49.400]  police they wanted to hurt me
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:53.160]  i bet the cop that did that's had that come back on him 10 times i saw the

[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:24.520]  the atf famously is anti-gun and loves to arrest
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.960]  people that create parts and accessories for firearms
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:31.240]  and they were able to get an injunction on them raiding them but that didn't
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.680]  stop the atf they got another federal judge to let them in
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.600]  made national news and the the atf announced to them that it was fun
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:43.720]  to raid them and they came in in army out uniforms army outfits with battle
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:48.200]  helmets uh and and and shredded around and and you know
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.960]  they were in there with kids and families and uh they didn't want the
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:56.840]  donuts they were offered because they're prepared for war
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.600]  with the american people and if you get an injunction on an atf raid
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:04.280]  you're obviously using the legal system why you must be a criminal so let's
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:07.080]  send an armored vehicle and a bunch of guys in helmets
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:10.600]  because they all watch uh you know captain america and are imagining

[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.120]  illegally and it's on record that you are targeting the general public for

[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.120]  they join us from the road at a cafe so there'll be some
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:37.880]  music in the background i'm told but that should add to the ambiance

[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:49.240]  but uh we are talking to the ceo of aries armor

[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.000]  you can see her in the photos offering them donuts and things
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.440]  and you just got the people waiting at their open business
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.400]  and they're just standing there on the video you can see it up at info wars
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.760]  dot com and there's guys pointing machine guns at them pointing and
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:12.120]  walking around with their chest out imagining they're fighting a real
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:16.200]  enemy i mean come on why don't you go fight al-qaeda in iraq oh i'm
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:22.920]  sorry they're heroes now and are staging ground to attack kasharia
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.920]  i mean even i don't agree with iraq and afghan war you know i know a lot of
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:29.560]  veterans and people that are friends of mine and they're just fun people to hang
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:34.680]  out with fun people to go surfing with fun people you know
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:37.400]  and then they take their shirt off and they got bullet wounds and shrapnel
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:41.880]  holes all over them people like sergeant bigs to have sergeant bigs man that guy
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.760]  i went surfing with him wake surfing with the steiners and
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:48.200]  he jumped on the board immediately was like just really doing a great job we
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:52.040]  were amazed by that and just has like shrapnel you know all
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.360]  over him at holes in him and bullet holes and
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:57.320]  everything that's nothing he'd been in there like three tours i think
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:01.960]  some of people have had like 10 tours have the feet blown off and they strap
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.240]  prosthetic toes on and go back into combat
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.840]  those kind of people you've got to admire just for their courage
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:13.320]  i do not admire atf coming into an open business
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:18.120]  into a strip center with families and kids and just strutting around with
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.560]  people behind the counter you know you know
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:25.560]  just just total total idiots
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:29.560]  and then going through the building and and and pushing people around
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:35.000]  so they join us ceo uh dmitri karras thank you so much for coming on
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.400]  with uh lindy ds and i i tell people the whole story of what happened to you
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:46.760]  break it all down there in the former uh state of the united states california
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:50.360]  now absorbed into the kleptocracy of the globalist
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:53.880]  absolutely and first up thanks to uh so much for actually having us on today
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.880]  and everything like that we cannot tell you how much we appreciate
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:01.080]  and uh the support that's actually been lended to us after the situation
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.840]  occurred it's it's humbling to see how many people that are out there
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:08.520]  in the real world that actually care about this country still and it's uh
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:12.040]  it's it's it's definitely invigorating to see that there's people who still
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.520]  who still give a shit about what's going on in this country
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:18.600]  um pretty much what happened is and we're talking about an agency that has
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.880]  the power to define anything they want to be a firearm
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:28.440]  and in the past this same agency um has determined that a 14 inch long piece
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:33.640]  of shoestring is a firearm right so what they've done is uh by the way i've
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:37.320]  had the lawyers on and they had a gun owners of america that's true i mean
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:41.720]  they could say a chocolate easter bunny was a nuclear bomb
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:44.520]  absolutely absolutely and that's the power that's granted to them to go ahead
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.600]  and determine whatever they want is to be a firearm
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.040]  and then apparently to execute raids and all sorts of other ill will against
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.840]  the american people let's let's put examples that you're a
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.520]  pen manufacturer and you're making pens and the atf decides they don't like you
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.760]  anymore and uh they'd deem your pen to be of a firearm well
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:03.000]  i could tell you exactly what's going to happen after that they're going to come
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.960]  to you with uh some sort of under the table shady deal
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.920]  and tell you to give them all of your pens until you tell you to give them all
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:12.440]  of the private customers information who bought that pen from you
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:16.920]  um to think that we live in a country where this is actually happening
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:20.680]  is it's ludicrous it's like it's worse than that
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:24.200]  now people with tattoos of guns aren't able to fly
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:27.560]  people with shirts that say in our air kicked out of school
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:33.880]  and now a man had a tattoo of a gun and so they swat team rated him because the
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:36.920]  tea the tree trimming people because they all most these
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:40.760]  these service people get money on the side right uh ratting folks out
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:44.120]  they should be civilly sued over it that's a big secret the plumber the
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.400]  whatever it's actually spying on you they saw the tattoo of the gun and
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.600]  rated him as if a handgun's even illegal in mariland
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.720]  i mean this is the culture we live in it's totally sick
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.760]  you probably just hit it on the head there alex i'm guessing that that's
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:00.200]  probably why they rated us right there got a three percent on my neck
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:05.960]  um very evil now now with that said what happened is they came to us after
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.480]  they rated e p armory we became aware of that we
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:13.800]  realized what their determination on e p armory's product had been
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:17.000]  after we got a chance to look at that determination it became apparently
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.360]  obvious to us that the atf had made a giant mistake
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:24.200]  their determination the only determination that anybody other than the atf
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:28.600]  is seen so far is based on fiction the the process that they described in
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.720]  their determination in the way that they described it saying that the
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:36.280]  which made this product into a firearm is 100 false they know it's false they
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:39.320]  were informed it's false but they didn't really care too much about that what
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:42.440]  they cared about was attempting to make threats against us in order to gain
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:46.760]  access to private information and to you know make our life somewhat difficult
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:50.200]  so we start getting uh you know calls and harassment from them
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.040]  uh monday of last week and they're saying listen you give us this stuff
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.840]  or we're gonna come in we're gonna rate every single one of your buildings we're
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:00.040]  pretty much going to make your life miserable but if you make this deal
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.920]  with us under the table underhanded nobody's going to know about it don't
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:05.240]  worry don't worry we know that your customers
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:08.600]  they'll be really mad at you if you give this to us so don't worry we won't
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:12.040]  let anybody know that you you worked with us it's gonna be fine it's gonna be
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:15.400]  okay everything's good we know you're a legitimate business we don't want to
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:19.480]  this is illegally give us stuff that they're not supposed to get without
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.520]  warrants this is nsa style stuff but worse or we're
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:28.040]  gonna set you up this is gangster mafia thug america yeah and and so what we did
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:32.120]  is we uh you know we went out and like uh any legitimate business would do when
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.480]  they're being threatened by the mafia we went to the judicial system and asked
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.000]  for help we asked to get a temporary restraining order which we got based on
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.520]  the merits of uh you know what we presented in front of the judge
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:49.000]  um now what they did is on friday they went in and uh they pretty much said hey
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.360]  you know this is a criminal proceeding this that and the other you can't stop
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:57.000]  it um and they got the judge to clarify that the restraining order um did not
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.040]  prohibit lawfully um lawful criminal proceedings um at which point in time
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.160]  they went to a different judge got themselves a a search warrant and they
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:09.320]  made good on their threats they came by on saturday um they went through every
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.600]  building that we had they grabbed our computer systems they grabbed our
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:15.720]  products they grabbed paperwork and information i mean someone said they
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:19.720]  grabbed is is kind of silly to some degree um but i like how they were
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:23.560]  dressed up to play army though oh absolutely absolutely and you know one
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:28.120]  of the guys uh that was there i said uh hi to him i shook his hand and he comes
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:32.280]  up to me and he's you know i uh he told me his name and i uh you know i said oh
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:35.240]  i'm demetri and he said oh i know who you are we got a brief on you this morning
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.040]  and i'm like well what's that supposed to mean he's like oh well we we heard all
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:41.800]  about your you know military record and and this other kind of things just in
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:45.160]  case things went south and i i laughed i told the guy we're a typhoon living i'm
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:49.080]  a law-abiding citizen there's no reason to come into this place um dressed like
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:52.520]  you're you're going through ramadi or you're the enemy because you're a
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:57.000]  veteran you're listed as the number one enemy publicly by the trader government
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.440]  we have a vc collaborator banker occupied government on record
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:06.040]  they're the enemy they declare veterans the number one enemy
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:10.200]  you have been declared the enemy well i can tell you this alex one one
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.240]  compliment i did get from uh from one of the agents during the raids is that he
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:17.640]  was actually afraid to talk to me because of how much i talked to the uh
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:21.240]  the media and how open i am about the situation which is one of those things
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:24.840]  they absolutely should be afraid to talk to us in a situation like like this
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:28.200]  it's 100 them that should fear us they're gonna go to nuremberg when we
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:32.520]  take this country back people that have abused the american people are gonna
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:38.040]  be standing tall before the man absolutely and it's also it's one of
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.520]  those things when you know i'm discussing this with these people and i'm
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:43.560]  like you know that your information is false you know that you're doing this
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:47.720]  based on information that is 100 and correct but yeah you continue to do
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.520]  this and the answer that i get back as well that's the
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.600]  information that's been passed down from higher
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:56.200]  so it's almost like talking to you know an all-schwitz prison guard
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:59.240]  who's at you know why why are you holding them inside of these cells over
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.880]  here why are you doing this oh well that's that's the information that was
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:05.400]  passed down to me from higher you know i mean it's absolutely ludicrous
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.880]  behavior well let's break down and talk about how they're well what they're
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:11.720]  claiming is a full firearm because i mean i've seen the cases where they'll
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:15.480]  claim a barrel is a firearm they'll claim a flash suppressor
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:18.680]  i saw that case of all back where they said a shoestring was
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:21.480]  a shoestring absolutely they came to claim and that's the power that that
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.600]  apparently we've given them these people have literally declaimed a shoestring to
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:27.640]  be a firearm in the past well here's an example the federal courts have said
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:32.280]  they can just define a firearm so they can define a cumulus cloud as one
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:35.800]  that's the same thing with the epa the supreme court said they can define what
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:38.920]  a pollutant is well they're now saying water vapor
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:43.640]  and carbon dioxide is so they can tax it stay there guys i want to come back

[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:55.400]  but i want to go back to these folks because i've had a lot of gun dealers
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:25:00.040]  contact me over the years and give us documents and give us intel we broke
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:03.560]  that the atf was making people file reports on folks
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:06.680]  buying more than two firearms outside of law years ago but
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:10.760]  the gun shops never want to be on air they're scared
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:15.720]  and uh these guys are not and the attitude that's going to
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:20.760]  win is realizing we've done nothing wrong and laughing at the system
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.040]  and yeah they may come after us they may set us up they may kill us
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:27.160]  i mean i don't i know the globalists are murdering killers they might kill me
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:30.680]  next week hope they don't they might set me up and put me in
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:35.080]  prison they might drug me i mean you know who knows
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.680]  the whole point is is that that's just the way it is then jack
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:43.720]  because i'm not going to get down and lick your boots you got it
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:49.960]  now going back to the ceo and and and of course i want to get
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:53.160]  miss ds's take uh who also works there at the company who's with him
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:57.880]  uh dmitri caris uh a veteran shows they were very upset over the fact that you
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:01.160]  were a veteran uh break down why they were there what
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:04.520]  they were claiming they were looking for what did they want a few weeks to go
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.640]  under the table
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:10.920]  what they what they wanted was they wanted our customer list and it was a
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:14.520]  specific product that was made in palmar that's an 80 percent receiver
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:18.360]  now in every determination that the atm has ever made in the past
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:22.360]  there are five things that are required for um for in the ar style of
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:26.920]  80 percent receivers to be left undone that the customer would have to complete
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:30.280]  in order for it to not be considered a firearm those things are your fire
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:33.400]  control pocket your hammer pin your trigger pin your safety
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:37.080]  selector through a hole and your trigger through a hole all of those five
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:40.520]  operations are left uncompleted on the product in question
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:44.440]  again their their issue with it was uh about the manufacturing process now the
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:47.720]  manufacturing process happened and they were wrong they're completely wrong
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:50.760]  they know that they're wrong they've been informed that they're wrong but that
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:54.680]  didn't really seem to matter to them um and what's funny about this is i go to
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:58.680]  the courts and i say hey i'm being extorted because someone is trying to
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:02.600]  come in unjustly and take you know this information and take this stuff from
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:05.160]  us um and this is in a contested issue we want to
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:08.680]  handle this in the courts we don't want to handle this through um you know the
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:12.840]  conventional means that the atf likes to use of just you know bashing in people's
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:15.400]  doors we're honestly lucky that the fbi's hostage
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:19.720]  roasting team didn't show up for this event but um apparently that that didn't
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:22.840]  that is not the way they wanted to happen i mean we'd ask the judge to
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:26.200]  for actually to declare whether these things are firing we wanted to go into
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:29.320]  court with evidence with proof with you know everything
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:32.120]  that was going on to handle this that way but that's not the you know that's not
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:35.400]  the uh the way that the federal government does things apparently
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:40.440]  and uh i can tell you this um when uh when we had actually contacted you is
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:43.320]  it was lindy here that's uh that's with me today she's my assistant she
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:47.480]  mostly does everything and uh i'd usually take the credit for it but she's the
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:51.080]  uh the the real power behind the scenes um but she was the one who actually
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:55.160]  contacted you guys it was right after the judge had clarified that uh that order
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:59.080]  and we were fully expecting the atf to come in at that moment um and it was we
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:02.520]  had sent all the employees home and it was uh me and her sitting there waiting
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:06.040]  for them to show up and uh let me the the conversation
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:08.680]  so we had was literally well how do you think they're gonna come in here do you
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:11.960]  think we're both gonna live through this raid you know and it's because you
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:14.760]  watch these are the same people that pulled off weco these are the same
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:18.520]  people that are you know have been giving guns to the cartels for years
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:23.080]  ruby ridge no no let me tell you let me tell you the atf
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:27.240]  the atf was the masterminds of Oklahoma city and even tested blowing up another
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:30.600]  rider truck and we even know the atf people that were there on the ground
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:34.760]  confirmed off hotel receipts so let me tell you they are the most evil force
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.240]  in america well and they've been like and here's the
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:40.520]  other thing we've had reports from our customers where our customers will leave
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:43.960]  the store they'll get pulled over right out right across the street um
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.760]  questioned about what their business is with us and when they they ask the
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:50.200]  officers question them they'll you know the officers will just uh

[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:06.200]  yeah well this is also one of those situations i mean this is a clear cut
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:09.880]  situation of uh an overreaching government wanting to get people's
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:12.920]  private information and i get asked what why did they want that information is

[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:27.560]  amendment this is a huge huge huge um overreaching government is coming into

[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:18.760]  i was going to take them with me if i could have gotten

[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:40.920]  domestic it's alex jones our problem is we're not
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:44.120]  radical enough we haven't turned up our rhetoric
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:48.600]  to meet the enemy threat i've studied history
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:52.280]  it's incredibly compelling incredibly engrossing
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:56.120]  it's amazing how action-packed it is compared to
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:03.320]  hollywood to fiction most governments end up taking over
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:07.720]  enslaving everyone in mass murdering and taking the general public's daughters
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:10.760]  and making them become prostitutes for the state germany now officially does
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:14.600]  that oh you don't get welfare you got to go out and hook
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:18.840]  and and my point is is that it's about control
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:22.840]  the state wants to decide who can be in commercials who can publish books
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:27.800]  who can be successful what the styles are going to be it is control freaks
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:32.520]  the opposite of those that love individualism
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:35.960]  again i don't like marijuana i think it's a bad culture
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:39.480]  a bunch of stoners ruining their lives but you know what you got a right to do
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:43.160]  it i'm for total decriminalization
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:47.880]  and guns yeah there's some bad people with guns but statistically it's 70 plus
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:50.360]  times i was saying 40 something that was an old number
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:53.800]  that guns are used to stop crime for when they're used in crime
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:59.320]  crimes down by 51 using firearms those are just department numbers but boy
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.400]  they sure just don't want to promote them do they
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:04.920]  they want to brainwash the public that gun crime is an all-time record
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:08.920]  as eric holder said and as the la times even admitted gun crime
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:14.440]  plunges as public perceives epidemic
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:18.680]  maybe the public that believes mainstream media
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:22.840]  but i've never heard anybody with a firearm
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:27.640]  i've never shot anybody with a firearm and i've grown up since age four firing
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:31.800]  firearms that's how you start out you start out
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:36.360]  sitting in grandpa's lap of the 410 and you shoot a coffee can
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:40.040]  to show you how dangerous it is and then you're told
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:44.360]  you don't touch this it's dangerous every household
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:49.240]  in this country back 60 70 80 years ago even just 20 years ago in many areas
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:55.800]  the guns weren't locked up folks because people knew you don't touch them
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:00.440]  until the kids about three or four maybe you got them in a glass case and lock it
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:06.920]  but you don't touch those guns by the time you're six years old you can shoot
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:11.240]  dove out of the air shoot quail in the brush
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:14.920]  but my dad was a kid they were shooting there by the time they were six i didn't
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:17.960]  shoot it there till i was nine
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:25.960]  trying to reverse that trend my son's now alligators dear you name it
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:30.920]  that's normal i mean they arrest development ladies and gentlemen
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:34.440]  people were men by the time they were 14 15 before
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:38.920]  they're not a man to your 25 they say this is the takeover to make you
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:44.360]  domesticated it's the war on men that ties into the war on women
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:48.360]  that is taking place and going on i want to give you guys the floor and shut up
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:52.520]  ceo demetrius caris and lindy d as his assistant
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.080]  there at erie's armor describe what you guys tell what you were doing looks like
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:00.280]  a nice place you had describe how long you've been in business what happened
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:03.960]  where this is going and i'd like to hear from lindy about what it was like i saw
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:08.120]  photos of you guys offering them donuts i mean they first come in with their
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:13.640]  guns up pointed right at you aggressively uh in in commando outfits
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:16.520]  i mean obviously they could look at you through binoculars or looked at in the
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:19.480]  parking lot and see you're not lying and wait for them
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:22.840]  i mean these are people that absolutely are cowards
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:27.320]  but i guess most scum are cowards go ahead absolutely and i do want to get
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:30.520]  to uh to to let lindy get her perspective in on this because i
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:33.160]  she was sitting there with me waiting for this to happen
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:36.840]  and the conversations that we had the you know the feelings that ever were
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:39.480]  i think definitely something that should get out there but i'll give a real
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:43.240]  quick synopsis of the company we've been in business about four years
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:47.560]  we actually started out doing tactical nylon products which is your chest rigs
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:50.760]  backpacks slings things of that nature they're mostly
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:55.160]  marketed towards the military and law enforcement
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:59.800]  amusingly enough and uh you know through that we've expanded into other
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:03.080]  product lines we do a lot through the the rifle parts now and the 80
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:05.640]  percent line is is kind of where we've made our mark
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:10.600]  over the last recent recent years and you sell your firearms to general
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:15.400]  slaves we do not distinguish and there's not
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:18.600]  one product that we will sell to the government that we will not sell to the
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:22.200]  american people so yeah okay so you do sell stuff to the enemy
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:25.720]  well that's why they're mad at you please continue
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:28.920]  absolutely this is one of those things these these 80 products it's a way for
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:32.760]  the uh average american to get into gun ownership without the government
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:36.040]  intruding into their daily lives the entire idea behind this is you can sit at
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:39.240]  home and you can you know go out to your garage and
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:43.160]  you can build yourself a rifle and this is legally allowed for you to do this
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:47.400]  and it's a way for you to and they have said they have said they want to register
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:51.000]  to confiscate feinstein all of them bloomberg more
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.600]  that's their plan so people should get around their criminal designs
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:58.600]  and build their own firearms well i'm sure that senator feinstein loves us
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:02.200]  especially after we registered the the domain name senator feinstein
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:05.400]  dot com i'm sure she's a huge fan of our work
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:09.720]  um but i would really like to actually get lindy's take on
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:13.160]  you know what was happening when we got the uh the notice that the judge had
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:16.280]  changed the t ro it was pretty much yeah they're they're probably coming in
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:20.840]  right now and so on friday we uh we sent all the employees home and it was just
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:25.480]  me and lindy waiting down there for them to to come in and so i think it'd be
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:28.200]  really nice to hear from her exactly like what that yeah tell us what it was
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:33.480]  like to face the paramilitary forces of the gun confiscation squads
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:38.600]  well i was ready i have to say i'm one of the three percent that will stand up
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:42.760]  so actually i think we were ready to get shot
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:47.800]  we were thinking about we both have children and we were kind of
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:51.000]  thinking of what we would want our children to think of us if this had
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.080]  happened and them to follow on in our footsteps
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:40:00.120]  we keep fighting for what we believe in so i mean as we sat there we kept going
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:04.760]  on like you know we're doing this for the people who won't stand up we are the
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:08.520]  people who will stand up and that's kind of what it was
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:12.920]  it's we were showing we aren't giving in we're not going in unless it's in cuffs
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:17.400]  or in a bag that's pretty much what it is
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:21.240]  well there's the headline california gun confiscation bill passes approval
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:25.080]  24 million to expedite illegal gun seizure and that's whatever guns they
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:29.000]  want including people with tattoos of guns are now being swat teamed
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.440]  just the image of a gun is a swat capable offense
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:36.600]  that's sad to think that that's what we're coming to i mean anybody can have a
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:42.120]  tattoo of anything and what if i have a i don't know a tattoo
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:45.800]  random stuff they it shouldn't be by what i'm
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:51.000]  the perception of me shouldn't be oh she's a gun owner because she has tattoos
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.760]  um he's a gun owner because he dresses down a lot of our customers are well
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:58.760]  dressed people you would never know they go out on the ranges on weekends to go
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:02.040]  shooting for fun i mean it's not it's not like we're
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:05.480]  stockpiling sure sure well listen guys i want to have you back up on the nightly
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:07.720]  news sometime when you when you're in a place that doesn't have so much
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:11.080]  background noise but briefly any other points you want to make about the raid
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:14.360]  and where you're going from here are they gonna be able to shut you down
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:18.760]  when do you get your your stolen stuff back uh from the uh from the pirates
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:23.320]  with that said i can't comment on our legal strategy going forward uh we have
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:26.600]  retained a very prominent law firm and we are very confident
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:31.480]  in uh in our abilities to overcome um with that being said the the the raid that
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:37.320]  was executed against us was it was completely there there was no
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:41.480]  reason for it i had actually shown at f agents exactly where the product was
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:45.000]  that was in question we had separated it put it into a separate room i had a
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.200]  camera pointing towards that room i offered to give them access to that
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:50.920]  camera system so that they would be comfortable in knowing that we were not
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:55.640]  going to divest ourselves of the product um i also switched the locks out on
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:57.960]  that door there was only two keys in existence
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:01.400]  and i offered to hand the at f agents those two keys so that they would be
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:05.000]  100 assured that we did want this handled through the courts
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  um and this is just it's one of those situations where it's uh them going
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.800]  around the procedure it's not them going around the procedures is them using
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.400]  the procedures and playing the game in order to keep something that is
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:19.400]  obviously wrong out of the out of the judicial system where it already was
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:23.560]  there was no reason for any of this to happen and for them to say to us that
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:26.920]  and one of the agents actually did say this to me one of the biggest reasons
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:30.440]  that we got rated across the board on all of our facilities instead of just
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:33.880]  where the product that they were looking for was which they knew where it was
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:37.960]  um was because of how how mildly we are and how much we're on
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:42.600]  you know we we kind of embarrassed them is that'll be very useful in court to
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:46.120]  show that they said it was for your first amendment so a major civil rights
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:49.560]  violation uh by this anti-american organization that
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:52.920]  needs to be abolished and i can tell you this
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:55.480]  getting told that that we embarrassed them and that's the reason that they did
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:58.040]  this that did nothing but only embolden us
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:01.320]  to uh to go further and actually spread the word about this even more they
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:04.440]  should be embarrassed for what they did what they did is wrong they know what
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:07.560]  they did is wrong and they should absolutely be embarrassed for it and
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:10.360]  that's why their entire organization is a joke and we're making a joke out of
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:13.960]  their organization if you check on our our facebook page and other
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:16.440]  things like that we have made a complete mockery
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:19.240]  out of what they have done i don't think they've ever rated anybody before and
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:23.000]  had the the the target of their raid laugh in their face
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.320]  so i think and that's something that needs to happen these people need to
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:29.080]  learn that they're a freaking joke they are a joke 100% and that's what they
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:31.880]  need to be made into no that's right we need to stop being
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:36.120]  afraid it's like you better not talk bad about the corrupt agencies why they'll
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:39.480]  come get you won't i mean they're criminals
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:43.240]  i've got my free speech they shipped tens of thousands of guns into mexico
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:46.680]  cbs news got the memos to blame the second amendment while we knew that was
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:50.840]  obvious the attorney general did the criminal operation
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:54.920]  i've got one for you alex so they actually contacted us not too long ago
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:58.600]  and said that they were upset about the pictures we released from our surveillance
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:02.200]  system because of the officer's privacy well i'd like to ask them this you
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:04.920]  didn't care too much about the privacy of all of our customers
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:07.960]  so why should we take those pictures down why should we plus you can't even see
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:11.240]  the the face not like we put out their names or their addresses like what you
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:15.080]  stole from us no it's just a picture of them uh clearly
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.480]  coming through our building wearing a helmet like they're going through a
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:20.440]  muddy treating with women and children inside of the building
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:23.640]  treating it like it's a combat so you're in the united states
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:27.320]  you have no look at that woman public place i gotta say look at that one woman
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:31.240]  there like strutting around stand stand i mean if a guy was standing in that
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:34.760]  that stance it would be a joke you know their arms all out like she's cone in
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:38.840]  the barbarian meets meets uh you know uh
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:42.520]  otty murphy i mean it's it's just it's so ridiculous
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:46.600]  absolutely it was it was a little bit out there and it's it's about your
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:49.240]  military service because you said you were in iraq what is it like for you a
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:53.240]  veteran to then see them uh militarized against gun honors
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:57.240]  well i can tell you this when i got back from iraq um and i fought in ramadi
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:00.360]  during the surge um when i got back from iraq one of the first
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:04.440]  things i noticed was the media was saying uh the how the entire thing was a
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:08.280]  lost cause and this that and the other um but i started to look around this
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:11.160]  country and i came to the immediate realization
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:14.760]  that the people in iraq have more freedoms and civil liberties
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:20.280]  than we do here and it's ludicrous to think that that's the case but that is
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:22.360]  the case i mean we're talking like like i said these
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:25.560]  these people they came in and rated us are the same people
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:29.800]  who you know have roasted their hostages alive they've uh gone through and
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:33.240]  declared 14 inch long pieces of string to be firearms
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:37.400]  i mean to to but there's no common sense that has anything to do with that
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:40.920]  entire organization no it's a criminal agenda to illegally destroy the
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:45.000]  second amendment we will defeat them absolutely there's not an option about
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.160]  uh whether or not we we we can fight them or not we
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:52.120]  it's unbelievable i've run into the atn before at gun shows and stuff and they
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:55.880]  will literally come over this was back before i got cell phones for
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:58.760]  ubiquitous like this last one was about eight years ago and get in my face and
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:02.200]  go you're all shones we don't like how you talk about us
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:06.360]  and i'm like well i mean the atf's got a bad history it's b atf
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:10.280]  until i go hey man watch it don't talk to me like that you punk
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:15.000]  i mean i am just sick of their attitude all right we lost their sky well that
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:20.120]  was a good interview with those folks um you know something like helicopters
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:24.040]  were landing in the background uh so there is that story and we appreciate
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:29.160]  them standing up and speaking out for all of us
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:32.920]  i mean folks this country is absolutely being over

[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.880]  is it up on the youtube yet because i'm just trying to coordinate
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:27.160]  a video that we produced over the last a few weeks
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:34.200]  uh that i'm really really proud of uh and uh i want to um
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:37.000]  i want to make it public then because i'm looking at it here on youtube and i
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.040]  don't see it there so i'll just direct all this from
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:43.400]  on air i want to send it out on facebook
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:49.800]  it no they never i want it launched as soon as it's up
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:53.720]  we don't put videos on private that kills their distribution
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:57.960]  i want it launched i want it on info wars dot com
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:01.640]  i want it on prison planet dot com i want it on twitter
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:07.320]  i want it on facebook any big video we put out we do a push on
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:10.440]  i don't know what the universe it is that with big videos we we put them on
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:13.080]  private shut them down and hack them in the head with hatchets
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:16.440]  anyways the point is i'm just excited about this video
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:20.440]  it's two weeks in production and hell let's just not release it
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:24.600]  uh the point is is that i wanted to release it this morning it's been done
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.680]  since yesterday and it's really funny and it's satire
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:36.440]  but it does not translate on radio so we will put it on info wars
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:43.080]  dot com and prison planet dot com and at the top of our facebook
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:46.200]  and i'm going to tweet it out at real alex jones and we're going to make it
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:54.760]  public on info wars dot com and we're going to let people see it
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:58.840]  i'm just had meetings this morning about that and i i'm just i'm happy
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:02.120]  very happy and and we're creating standardized systems around here
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:05.640]  the point is that's going to be up on info wars dot com the next 10 minutes
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:09.080]  it's really funny and i'll i'll tell you about it once it's up
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:12.360]  uh but i intended to talk about it right there but it's not up so
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:15.880]  uh the issue here is is that we're going to get more into satire more into
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:19.400]  humor more into hijacking entertainment more into that type of
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:24.120]  coverage okay so that's the bottom line
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:27.640]  so that's coming up later in the next hour as well

[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:28.360]  by the way the crew's doing a great job on a short ranching and raving about how
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:31.800]  i want something promoted it's just that i want to sometimes like really big
[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:35.880]  stuff i like that we produce doesn't get promoted and then some
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:38.920]  little thing that i don't quite think you think is that important
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:42.600]  ends up getting millions of views on youtube it's very annoying but we did a
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:46.840]  comedy piece called caveman discovered in texas
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:50.280]  and it's also a way to fund info wars dot com
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:53.640]  because it's an ad for supermail vitality but it's really
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:58.680]  ridiculous and it just went live on info wars dot com
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:02.920]  so be sure to go to the site and we'll put it up on screen for folks
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:06.360]  uh and click on that and send it to your
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:11.480]  friends and family because it is extremely
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:16.120]  extremely ridiculous
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:23.560]  now continuing here today ladies and gentlemen
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:27.000]  if you go to info wars dot com i can put it up
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.880]  i can put it up on my screen and we can punch my screen up
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:41.480]  if you go there you can then see the story caveman discovered in texas a
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:45.400]  satirical dramatization of how we've been
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:49.720]  dehumanized and i think it's absolutely hilarious
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:54.920]  and i directed it and i came up with the concepts but darin mcbreen
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:56:00.440]  came up with the end so so so it stands on its merits if you think it's funny
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:02.920]  or not it's all my fault if it isn't funny
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:09.080]  uh but darin has i think came with the funniest part at the end
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:12.520]  and i'm just gonna leave it at that what happened to alex jones
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:18.200]  when he took supermail vitality uh and i will assure you this is as funny in my
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:22.440]  view as any national television commercial i've seen
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:25.720]  this is as funny as arnold swartz and eger playing ping pong
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:29.960]  uh in a miller light commercial in fact it's a lot
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:35.080]  funnier than that uh and i think the trendies are gonna like it
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:38.760]  and it's the type of thing that's again a gateway to wake those type of folks up
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:41.880]  so great job with the whole crew and everybody that participated in
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:45.160]  producing it because mcbreen wants to do more of this stuff that you see out
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:48.200]  there these viral videos where guys are having like laser beam fights or whatever
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:51.400]  or things are being blown up you can do it so easily now
[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:55.240]  something's like on sci-fi channel we can do it better
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:58.520]  just with you know time and energy so we're going to start really producing
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:02.440]  all sorts of really interesting stuff that's been my plan for a long time
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:06.920]  uh and this is just a little foray uh into that and the great graphics of the
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:10.280]  whole crew but darin mcbreen did the uh did did the really interesting one
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:13.320]  where well i'm not going to tell you what i did
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:19.640]  it's up on info wars dot com and uh you can uh comment on info wars dot com in
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:24.760]  the comments under it and tell me did you think
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:28.760]  that it was funny it's a little bit racy too
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:37.400]  not too racy but just a little bit yeah it's gilligan's island racy
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:42.600]  i don't even think it would make the amish blush but it is it is it is racy
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:46.120]  for gilligan's i mean it's gilligan's island level

[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:51.320]  ran paul concerned about who is truly in charge
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:54.680]  of our government now folks i've talked a lot about this
[02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:58.920]  and we've got the video of that coming up
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:05.720]  after our guest leaves us leave us the issue here is the rhetoric of the
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:08.840]  establishment is we're taking your kids your kids belong to us
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:11.800]  we're building FEMA camps for our own good gun owners or terrorists
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:15.000]  veterans of the enemy that that is insane
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:19.320]  tyrant bad guy rhetoric that we should use against them to discredit them
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:23.800]  but if we just sit there and go okay you're the authority it sets the precedent
[02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:30.600]  for that crazy level of evil and so that's what i'm getting at
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:34.680]  here is that when you're faced with over the top evil
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:38.120]  it's not sensational to call it over the top evil
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:41.320]  it's not sensational to say the sub union was a nightmare
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:44.360]  system of total dehumanization and mass murder and evil
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:47.320]  it's not a sensational to say adolf hitler
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:51.320]  was a demon possessed kleptocratic mass murder
[02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:54.680]  it's not you know jack the ripper was horrible i mean
[02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:58.440]  it's just you have to call it jeffrey dommer was horrible
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:02.040]  you don't say oh well don't you'll be reasonable he was a human too
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:07.480]  you've got to discriminate against bad people on their actions
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:11.240]  and ted cruise and rand paul have been calling him drunk with power dangerous
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:16.440]  frightening becoming a dictator if we don't get obama to ratchet it back it
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:24.520]  will set the precedent coming in to the next phase of things
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:28.040]  to where the republicans will have this power too and then suddenly the left
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:30.200]  will put on a big act like they're against it
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:33.480]  we need to see real moves to reign this in and rand paul
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:37.640]  and ted cruise in the senate and people like walter jones in the house
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:41.960]  have been moving to do that now continuing here
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:45.640]  rand paul concerned about who is truly in charge of our country close quote
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:50.920]  warns of quote dystopian nightmares well it's if a tree fell on the forest
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:53.000]  didn't make us nobody heard it didn't make a sound
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.800]  it's already going on look at the numbers look at what the government's doing
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:12:00.040]  look how it preys on us they're taking people's children that have a legal
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:06.200]  marijuana legal medical marijuana card
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:12.200]  i mean this government is predatory and sick while it ships the hard drugs in
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:16.120]  and pushes riddlin and prozac and everything prozac type drugs on the
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:20.600]  kids they're drug pushing hardcore deadly drugs
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:24.200]  that literally retard the growth of the brain physically
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:30.840]  create heart expansion at a roll all of it
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:33.800]  and then they say oh but if you smoke marijuana we're gonna take your kids
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:37.640]  even if it's legal cps doesn't care they're criminal because they have their
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:43.880]  own family court so this is the type of garbage
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:47.240]  that's going on rand paul concerned about who is
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:49.720]  truly in charge of our country our government

[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:04.440]  well there's no thinking about that and that elected representatives are
[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:08.120]  privately afraid of those operating behind the curtain we'll look at how the
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:10.840]  nsa spying on them yeah he's saying they're coming

[02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:26.280]  rand paul tells it like it is that congress is being blackmailed and
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:29.880]  bullied that's what's happening the supreme court that's why the evil can't

[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:59.240]  that's what we're dealing with as a society rand paul concerned about

[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:07.160]  warns in a speech today that he believes u.s spooks

[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:51.800]  hours to release navy chief or basically threatens actions i hope nothing
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:55.640]  happens there they've had sniper shooting people to blame russia it's clear
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:59.160]  who's running it because the pr operations expert believes missing
[02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:03.320]  Malaysian airlines flight being held for ransom yeah governments probably know
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:05.960]  what happened aren't telling people they've even done it and they're doing
[02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:08.600]  it as a diversion or some rogue group i don't know
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:12.040]  here's the headline has there been a military cover up the missing
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:16.600]  jet ty air force says its radar spotted mh 370

[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:25.160]  i didn't say anything yeah the look there's a bunch of stuff going on here
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:28.200]  now i want to go to our guests and we're going to skip this network break because
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:33.240]  i'm going to them late here's the headline
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:37.080]  medical marijuana users fight to keep infant daughter
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:39.720]  a strong message was sent to the department of human services just four
[02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:42.520]  days after steven maria green of lensing
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:45.720]  helplessly watches her infant daughter brie was taken from their care
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:48.520]  a reason given states sanctioned medical marijuana users
[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:52.440]  home was too dangerous for six month old because of plants inside
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:55.400]  because they were allowed to legally grow it for medicinal usage
[02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:59.080]  they thought someone might rob them ladies and gentlemen are you gonna get
[02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:02.840]  robbed for jewelry you're gonna get robbed for having a watch
[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:07.080]  how about a lexus again this is how they just make up
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:10.520]  oh you had plates in the dishes oh you have dogs those are there

[02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:19.320]  again most americans have smoked marijuana half the population of the
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:23.080]  country is estimated to smoke marijuana on a routine basis
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:26.360]  now are you too stoned out there to care are you going to get organized
[02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:29.560]  because this is going on all over the country
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:32.920]  and again if you got glaucoma or stomach aches or all of the problem it is a
[02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:35.880]  great medicine if used moderately i don't use it
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:40.040]  but i know medically it is it is very useful so much judging moderate users
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:42.840]  of pot i'm also not endorsing the culture of the
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:46.840]  people that use it too much but this when you go in to have a baby
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:50.760]  and a lot of false positives for thc they're gonna take your kid
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:54.200]  nobody's telling mothers this they're praying on you there's not need
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:56.920]  there's not any public service announcements hey don't smoke pot it
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:19:00.360]  will take your kid when you come in to have it they want to snatch your baby
[02:19:00.360 --> 02:19:04.360]  they're gonna sell it for adoption for a half mil now let's go
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:08.440]  now to our guests to go through the saga of what's happened
[02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:11.560]  steve and maria green
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:16.760]  whose child was kidnapped by quote armed gunman
[02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:20.840]  the armed gunman in the case where the police along with their government
[02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:25.240]  officials not servants from the state of michigan
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:29.400]  maria and steve are medical marijuana because of multiple sclerosis and
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:33.160]  epilepsy which it's on record helping both but are
[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:36.680]  registered with the state of michigan which they use to grab the kid
[02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:40.920]  and submit to random drug test see they tell you that you can have your
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:44.520]  marijuana but you waive your rights it's even worse all this decriminalization
[02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:46.920]  is a total fraud i'll just go back to being illegal
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:49.560]  i'm telling you folks nothing that comes out of george soros gonna turn out to
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:52.760]  be good guys thank you for coming on freebabybreed.com
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:55.880]  thank you so much maybe i'm hearing me rant about all the things that are going
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:19:59.880]  on uh you got the floor tell us what happened what what you've gone through
[02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:03.640]  uh and where this is going because there is a war
[02:20:03.640 --> 02:20:08.680]  against um legal marijuana users in this country
[02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:15.480]  yeah um thank you for having us on um my husband has been a medical marijuana
[02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:22.680]  patient since um 2010 for his seizures that uh he had seizures since 2006
[02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:29.240]  um and you know this was one of the um one of the
[02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:33.000]  only things left for him to try to control his seizures
[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:37.160]  and it turns out it worked really amazing um he
[02:20:37.160 --> 02:20:41.240]  ended up being seizure free um for quite some time
[02:20:41.240 --> 02:20:49.800]  and um last summer uh towards the end of the summer um i had a bitter x who
[02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:55.160]  called cps against us um just to try and gain leverage in a custody case
[02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:59.560]  and um it spiraled out of control from there um
[02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:07.240]  they came to investigate they wanted to um count the plants and um
[02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:10.920]  you know they needed to see the plants and see all the medical records from
[02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:16.600]  all of the patients that i grow for and on and on um
[02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:21.080]  we even brought them the our baby at the time was six months old
[02:21:21.080 --> 02:21:27.240]  and we brought the investigator um to our baby we showed her um out on the
[02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:29.960]  porch and she wasn't really even interested in
[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:34.920]  seeing the baby she just really needed really just wanted to see the plants
[02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:41.320]  and um through a course of the course of her investigation we
[02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:45.160]  invited her and her supervisor and the agency
[02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:50.120]  to get a court order to come into the home because our laws here in michigan
[02:21:50.120 --> 02:21:54.760]  would not allow for um me to give access to those
[02:21:54.760 --> 02:22:00.040]  plants to anybody else and they left saying okay yes that's
[02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:04.360]  what they would do they would petition the court to enter our home
[02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:08.680]  and um the morning that that was supposed to happen
[02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:13.400]  they called me and said you know i just want to go over one last time
[02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:17.320]  whether or not you're going to let us in your house before we petition to remove
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:21.720]  your kids and so they pulled this fast one on us
[02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:27.240]  and we went into court that afternoon um with them bringing a petition not to
[02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:32.760]  enter the house but to remove our children and um
[02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:37.080]  and the judge at the time the referee um
[02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:43.480]  he heard a little bit of testimony and in the end he said that he was really
[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:46.520]  just concerned that there was plants growing in the house
[02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:50.920]  and even though i was legal to do so um
[02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:54.120]  he thought that that would increase our chances of having
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:57.400]  armed robbery and that the baby could get hurt
[02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:01.880]  that's an incredible precedent that if if you have a nice car or a nice watch
[02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:05.480]  or computers or or or or anything they want
[02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:08.680]  now you've got to have your children taken for safety of course
[02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:12.440]  and be given to government custody where there's seven times in more danger of
[02:23:12.440 --> 02:23:18.760]  everything you can imagine yep absolutely um and it ended up taking us
[02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:23.320]  six weeks of fighting her being out of the home
[02:23:23.320 --> 02:23:28.040]  we were able to visit her for a couple hours every week
[02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:32.600]  and uh and it took us six weeks to be able to get her back
[02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:36.200]  wow just just incredible and again how old was your daughter
[02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:39.800]  she was six months at the time she was taken how how was her
[02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:42.840]  how was she when you got her back most of the time the children are just lost
[02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:46.600]  waiter in critical condition in many cases
[02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:51.640]  thankfully she was so young um we did notice that she was quite gun shy
[02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:58.200]  um didn't like strangers anymore um was a little bit uh more antsy and
[02:23:58.200 --> 02:24:02.680]  anxious and that kind of thing she thankfully snapped out of it
[02:24:02.680 --> 02:24:05.000]  relatively quick she bounced back against the enemy
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.520]  mm-hmm yeah and that's what these people are is they're the enemy we have to
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:11.800]  recognize that uh so expanding on this where did it all go
[02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:17.000]  from there um from there they gave her back to us
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:21.240]  with the um condition that we had to do this parenting
[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:25.400]  counseling type thing um and as long as we were
[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:28.840]  successful with that then they would just drop the case all together
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:32.200]  yeah but that's usually going to be their people who can then do whatever so so
[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:35.800]  so they act like they're the good guys when they've kidnapped your child
[02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:39.400]  but you guys went public i think you only got her back most parents don't
[02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:44.360]  because you went public absolutely towards the end when they decided that
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:47.560]  they were going to give her back as long as we did these
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:51.880]  um these conditions and they at first gave us a pretty
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:56.040]  lengthy list of conditions and we went back to them and said no there's some
[02:24:56.040 --> 02:24:58.680]  of these you need to change and they did
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:02.600]  very quickly so we got the impression that they just kind of wanted to wash
[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:05.800]  their hands as a whole case yeah they got other kids they're grabbing to move on
[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:08.280]  to and again not all family courts are like this
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:12.040]  not all systems are like this it tends to be certain states or counties
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:15.320]  but we need to really go after people that act like this
[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:19.800]  show that judicially it's known as unacceptable in the community
[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:22.920]  that you know either a country supports death penalty it doesn't support it
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:26.600]  it's about a moral decision of the people of the nation we obviously don't want
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:30.440]  people taken because they have legal medical marijuana being grown in the
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:34.360]  home big deal did i mean did george washington
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:38.840]  you know have his family taken away because he grew it
[02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:43.720]  you know george washington grew medical marijuana right oh yeah
[02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:47.800]  yeah so i mean i'm just sick of it i mean it's known for two things it's known
[02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:54.120]  for people that are nauseous glaucoma it's known to uh change the brain waves
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:56.680]  uh and a lot of people that have epilepsy as you guys were just talking
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:25:59.400]  about you know let's talk to your husband steve green
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:02.920]  steve talk about what it was like when they came what they did what was like
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:07.320]  to see your daughter taken uh i mean i mean describe that process and then
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:12.680]  tell us what it did for both of your medical conditions
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:18.360]  yeah as uh you know as a father and and a husband you know you can't imagine
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:24.440]  uh the amount of reserve it takes to not uh for lack of a better word
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:29.880]  clobberum um but when someone's trying to take your children uh
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:34.600]  you know there's there's nothing but uh rage that goes through you
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:39.560]  um but we were you know just able to keep collected
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:45.000]  and stay calm and knowing that you know if one of us were arrested for
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:50.040]  acting irrational um or something like that i bet the marijuana after they left
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:56.200]  helped settle you down medical use there is this a date yeah
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:27:01.640]  and so it was uh it was just a nightmare for that to happen but we knew we had
[02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:07.400]  to stay that way and shortly after we uh went to the doorsteps of dhs with
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:11.400]  about 200 people and uh we'll say that again how
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:16.360]  many people dhs yeah we went to the the main office of the dhs with
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:21.400]  about 200 protesters but the dhs was involved in this
[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:24.760]  yeah that's uh the department of human services
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:30.760]  run cps in our state unbelievable please continue with it
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:34.040]  and so we uh like you said we hit the press and
[02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:39.080]  and we uh made it public because we were outraged and we knew that you know
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:43.480]  most americans would be and by the way anytime somebody takes somebody's
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:47.640]  child because they smoked marijuana or whatever we should have people rallying
[02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:51.880]  uh like we're going to frankenstein's castle to tell him we're not putting up
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:54.840]  with this scum i mean this is what it's about we hang
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:58.520]  together or hang separate you get aggressive you get a free country back
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:05.000]  on guns on marijuana on parental rights on father's rights on everything people
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:09.080]  better learn to stand up i'm sorry i'm ranting sir no no you're good
[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:12.760]  you uh a lot of things even in the intro you hit the nail on the head with
[02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:16.200]  prescription drugs and here in michigan if you
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:20.280]  decide to be a medical marijuana patient or in my case have to be
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:24.840]  uh because nothing else worked then you pretty much give up your right to own a
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:29.560]  gun uh and in cps's eyes here in michigan if
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:32.840]  you're a medical marijuana patient you give up your fourth amendment they're
[02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:36.040]  allowed to just come on in and search whatever they want
[02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:39.320]  see if i was having epilepsy you want to break i want to come back give me the
[02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:41.800]  floor but if i was having epilepsy i'm not
[02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:45.080]  waiting my fourth amendment i'll go by pot on the street
[02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:49.640]  i mean i cannot believe i cannot believe that they do this to people
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:55.000]  making you wave your rights go ahead yeah so it's uh it's kind of amazing
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:58.520]  that they put all these restrictions in place
[02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:03.160]  but yeah we pushed forward and had a great rally a bunch of women
[02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:08.440]  got uh held hands and sang songs i noticed it's women standing up in this
[02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:12.760]  country most of the time go ahead yeah that was uh from what i understand the
[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:15.800]  movement and uh prohibition of alcohol and it looks

[02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:29.240]  of the resistance it's alex jones the war on drugs is a giant fraud most of
[02:33:29.240 --> 02:33:32.280]  the narcotics are shipped in by the big banks on record they don't get in
[02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:35.000]  trouble when they get caught laundering hundreds of billions of dollars like
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:38.920]  wells fargo wakovia bank of america you pull up hundreds of mainstream news
[02:33:38.920 --> 02:33:42.120]  articles breaking that down wakovia wells fargo laundered
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:46.520]  in a three-year period what was it between 2007
[02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:54.040]  and 2010 380 plus billion dollars 387 billion dollars
[02:33:54.040 --> 02:33:58.280]  and got a 111 million dollar fine we did the math that'd be like if you robbed
[02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:01.560]  millions of dollars and paid a couple thousand dollar fine
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:05.480]  you start robbing banks immediately if you were immoral person right
[02:34:05.480 --> 02:34:11.800]  so it's just a total fraud i mean we know that birds eat fermented
[02:34:11.800 --> 02:34:15.480]  berries and get drunk and seek the berries out we know bats do it
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:19.560]  are we gonna arrest them i'm drinking coffee right now wake up america blend
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:23.000]  america coffee wake up america coffee from info wars
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:29.560]  i mean that's a stimulant am i evil am i bad obviously this stuff's all abused
[02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:32.760]  but the reason it's dirty is because you've made it illegal then it's
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:36.760]  underground and then the criminal elements involved and they're the ones
[02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:43.720]  that are nasty you want to dispel narcotics decriminalize them control
[02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:47.720]  them like prescription drugs stuff like marijuana decriminalize it
[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:51.640]  my problem is all over the country they've got the state laws and federal
[02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:55.240]  edicts where you basically waive your rights to go into this
[02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:59.240]  and marijuana is a miracle plant the cannabinoids all the stuff involved in
[02:34:59.240 --> 02:35:02.200]  it and i've been involved in documentaries i've seen the studies
[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:05.000]  i mean it's mainline stuff big pharma knows this
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:08.280]  they're making hundreds of drugs out of it right now i'm patenting it
[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:11.880]  this is cnn right here and we're going back to our guest marijuana stops
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:18.520]  child's severe seizures she was having 300 a week and was
[02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:21.720]  going to be completely brain damaged and basically die
[02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:25.240]  i mean i've watched my uncle have seizures over the last 30-something years
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:29.320]  and uh you know they they they mess him up but he's reduced him with drugs and a
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:33.080]  fatty diet you know coconut coconut oil things like that
[02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:36.680]  and they've evened again but the mainline doctors won't tell you go get a
[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:40.280]  medical marijuana thing it's been found in double
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:43.080]  blind studies across the board with many different types
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:46.280]  of epileptic disorders that are on the rise by the way
[02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:51.000]  with our toxic environment it's been found to massively reduce them
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:55.880]  she was having 300 grand mal seizures a week her heart had stopped a number of
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:36:00.760]  times and it reduced it down where is that the article how many a week
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:07.400]  didn't say five a week yes my mic's not clear guys like i told you
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:11.160]  three to four thanks yeah there it is the article three to four
[02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:18.280]  and that's the issue that the system is trying to block here
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:22.440]  that that for all the ways they're poisoning us god has given us all these
[02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:26.200]  great plants that can do these amazing things
[02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:30.280]  and big pharma under codex alimentarius wants to shut this down
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:34.600]  but not just marijuana they've had raids on
[02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:42.600]  different herbal uh growing facilities with things like aloe vera i saw that a
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:45.960]  few years ago claiming someone could use it as a drug i mean they just want to
[02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:50.840]  control the resources now going back to steve and marie green
[02:36:50.840 --> 02:36:55.640]  they started freebabybreed.com a foundation to help fight the cps when
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:36:59.080]  they kidnap children for medical marijuana and other issues
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:01.800]  and this is great there's lots of other organizations out there as well
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:05.160]  and this is where the data and the and the case histories and
[02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:10.200]  the game plans can be distributed to others and up their learning curve
[02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:13.720]  to where people know how to fight and know their rights so it's wonderful so
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:17.800]  steve and marie green break down the rest of the story what else happened
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:22.120]  and uh what happened when you went and marched against the dhs
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:26.520]  yes so uh that that's exactly what we did we had a bunch of people show up but
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:32.280]  we did the songs the protest uh signs the news came out and
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:37.560]  droves um and we uh you know got looks out of
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:40.760]  pretty much every window in the high rise building
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:45.400]  we had people from blocks around that would come and ask what was going on
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:50.040]  and then uh from there on it was just an outpour of court support
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:53.560]  both from a group called the human solution
[02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:57.080]  and uh just the community members in our area
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:01.400]  we had 30 40 people at each court date and when you're talking about
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:05.880]  you know a cps type of thing they normally try to restrict that and
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:11.160]  not allow very many people and uh make it as secretive as possible so we
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:14.520]  avoided that and i think that was a key element in
[02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:19.160]  getting reback and so we uh wrote out that process
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:23.320]  and uh went back in front of the judge and he made some statements
[02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:28.200]  like when you're convicted and you know just some uh
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:35.320]  very biased seeming statements and uh then after we proved ourselves uh
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:38.920]  in the media was in the courtroom filming and everything he never came back
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:42.600]  out of the courtroom or out of his chambers again
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:47.160]  but they did in chambers come to a decision that they would give free back
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:53.400]  uh since then we've had an independent uh report done by the state uh
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:57.320]  abuzzment report and uh they had some findings that
[02:38:57.320 --> 02:39:02.920]  cps made some errors and uh things like that so it looks like
[02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:07.320]  we're going to be uh you know keep screaming from the top of our lungs
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:10.680]  and we've been able to uh help several other families in
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:16.040]  michigan uh that were caught up in this type of situation
[02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:21.160]  and uh i think that's important for for the real americans and communities to
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:23.960]  stick together when when things are happening and it would
[02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:28.600]  outrage you if it happened to you remember we're all together in this and
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:31.480]  stick up for each other
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:36.520]  well again it just shows how predatory this system is and they're
[02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:39.800]  persecuting people across this country we have the largest prison population in
[02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:43.880]  the country in the world and it's only growing and they're just
[02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:46.600]  finding new ways to throw nonviolent people in jail
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:49.640]  while all these huge crimes are being committed across the board
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:53.640]  we had a case up in round rock last year where toddler died in cps
[02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:56.680]  captivity after being taken from marijuana smoking parents because the
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:00.360]  neighbors smelled it and i want to point it's these rat neighbors it's like this
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:05.720]  case cbs news was reporting on in maryland uh where the the tree
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:09.000]  trimming company was looking through the guy's window at his house
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:14.360]  and saw he had a tattoo of a gun on him so the swat team came for the tattoo
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:20.280]  and it just shows that it's just a culture of weird snitches everywhere
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:23.800]  that literally like their dream is to call the knight in shining armor the
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:27.480]  swat team on on anybody and everybody or everybody
[02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:32.120]  gets back at each other with the system and it's wrecking our culture
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:36.600]  it's ran hurting children so you know i wonder what the people that you know
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:41.240]  called the cps on you feel about the little baby being drug off and all
[02:40:41.240 --> 02:40:45.000]  this i wonder how that feels i wonder if that feels good
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:49.640]  well it was actually her ex-husband uh they were in a custody battle over her
[02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:53.960]  shared son uh when she went to court the day before
[02:40:53.960 --> 02:41:00.120]  the judge ruled in in my wife's favor the following day the ex-husband called cps
[02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:04.440]  and filed the complaint with his false allocations
[02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:09.720]  accusations and so exactly but i'm saying look look at the collateral
[02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:12.520]  damage though to a child that's not even you know
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:17.560]  related it's just i wouldn't call the system in folks unless it's an emergency
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:22.840]  oh but he was eating it up he's smug about it this is a very sinister person
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:25.480]  um well i don't want to get off of the whole family stuff but i know that gets
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:29.320]  nasty but i all i'm saying is is that this snitch culture
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:34.680]  is out of control what was it like when baby brie was uh returned to you guys
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:41.320]  it was a big party pretty much we uh we got her back there was a return policy
[02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:46.600]  and uh we completed that we got her back um we weren't allowed to have any media
[02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:50.440]  when we got her um because they're god because they're god
[02:41:50.440 --> 02:41:54.440]  right so right after that we went to our lawyer's office and we had a
[02:41:54.440 --> 02:42:00.040]  conference and celebration and uh you know like you said it
[02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:03.800]  happens all over the country cnn did a follow-up piece in napa
[02:42:03.800 --> 02:42:07.960]  california where they have removed uh 11 month old
[02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:10.920]  and they're still fighting for jurisdiction there
[02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:14.680]  um and this this just happens everywhere and you don't hear much about it
[02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:19.880]  because they they scare people so badly that most people won't speak out
[02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:23.400]  so i think it's imperative that like you said groups that

[02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:18.040]  is with the women that's why the system tries to speak for women
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:21.480]  that's why the system tries to run women that's why the system tries to claim
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:24.760]  they speak for women we get enough women out there promote the second
[02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:27.560]  amendment the men will follow and it's starting to happen
[02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:30.840]  women are getting into guns are the biggest buyers the last decade straight
[02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:33.880]  was in the wall street journal last week of guns
[02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:37.160]  women are buying guns women are shooting intruders they're shooting
[02:46:37.160 --> 02:46:39.480]  rapists they're shooting people that try to rob their
[02:46:39.480 --> 02:46:42.840]  businesses and laura steinham hates it she says women should
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:45.880]  known guns even though that pig has concealed carry on record just like
[02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:48.600]  diane feinstein
[02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:53.160]  so this is what we're talking about i mean if you're really for women being
[02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:57.240]  powered then you know go get your wife to take jiu-jitsu or
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:47:02.120]  kickboxing or golden gloves or get them take them take them out get them
[02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:04.760]  shooting you know we got leon going to take a
[02:47:04.760 --> 02:47:08.280]  concealed carry in about a week and a half we've been
[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:11.640]  in pecking on her guys have to get in there and get that
[02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:18.040]  we need women carrying firearms we need criminals to be scared
[02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:21.240]  that's because i'm anti-women that's why i want to
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:24.120]  all these black cities where guns are banned because it's totally racist
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:28.360]  the democrats would never want blacks to be armed we want to get the inner city
[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:31.960]  good people armed like in detroit michigan to then shoot the criminals and
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:35.080]  the police chief agrees with us we're beginning to win the head of interpoles
[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:38.360]  come out and said arm the general public
[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:41.480]  and that's what it comes down to ladies and gentlemen
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:45.400]  is the image of a real empowered woman who loves her husband loves her
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:48.840]  children loves her boyfriend and understands humanity is one group
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:53.320]  men and women form humanity when men and women are not separate folks
[02:47:53.320 --> 02:47:57.720]  in fact speaking of that let me just hit that article right now or parts of it
[02:47:57.720 --> 02:48:01.080]  by paul joseph watson but that t-shirt is available
[02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:05.480]  at infowarstore.com and then it's a platform to support folks that are
[02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:09.960]  trying to stop the child kidnappers that's why support free media because
[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:12.440]  it's a war they're trying to shut us down on record
[02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:18.120]  and all other alternative media ten ways true feminism is under attack
[02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:21.960]  number one feminism was hijacked by the political class to exploit women
[02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:26.600]  and paul watson details that and documents it number two the cia played a
[02:48:26.600 --> 02:48:31.240]  key role in hijacking feminism gloria steinem on record was a cia operative
[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:34.040]  they wanted to break up the family get the kids for themselves
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:37.960]  uh in state control cultural Marxism divide and conquer
[02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:42.040]  all the documents on that number four mainstream feminism ignores real women's
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:46.280]  rights issues like Muslims torturing and killing and enslaving women in iraq
[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:50.040]  you name it radical Muslims but then saying men shouldn't say the word
[02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:53.880]  bossy it's hurtful to women in pecking at us over nothing
[02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:59.240]  wanting to dominate us while not caring about real women's issues worldwide
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:02.280]  number five feminist ignore the plight of muslim women just mentioned that but
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:06.040]  it ties into the other one number six advertising targets women and why do
[02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:10.040]  they target it because women make about 84 percent of
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:14.200]  the decisions in most purchases hitler said first you get to women then you
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:18.200]  got the children so follow the men number seven mainstream feminism is about
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:22.680]  hating and disintegrating masculinity number eight women are being brainwashed

[02:54:58.640 --> 02:55:09.160]  Continuing court says FBI secret GPS tracking memos can stay secret from the government.
[02:55:09.160 --> 02:55:18.080]  States black toner shortage is primary motivation, that is absolutely ridiculous.
[02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:22.560]  Continuing here with the news, there is some good news out of Ukraine, Ukraine is making
[02:55:22.560 --> 02:55:28.640]  plans to pull trips from Crimea, so some of that is deescalating and that is certainly
[02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:29.640]  a good news.
[02:55:29.640 --> 02:55:34.000]  I hope John McCain doesn't get his way to the 11 point plan for war.
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:37.640]  We've got those reports and I mentioned this earlier, but I want to get more into this
[02:55:37.640 --> 02:55:41.080]  right now and really end this broadcast with this information.
[02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:48.480]  This is up on infowars.com, if you just joined us, Rand Paul concerned about who is truly
[02:55:48.480 --> 02:55:56.080]  in charge of our government, libertarian Kentucky Senator Rand Paul warns in a speech today
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:56:00.800]  that he believes U.S. books and shadow government agencies are drunk with power and that elected
[02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:05.280]  representatives are privately afraid of those operating behind the curtain and a scheduled
[02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:09.680]  appearance at the University of California, Berkeley, who Paul is now the head Republican
[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:15.640]  in the polls for president, Paul will address the continuing domestic spying controversy
[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:20.640]  in prepared comments, Paul notes, I am honestly worried, concerned about who is truly in charge
[02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:22.040]  of our government.
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:26.720]  Most of you have read the dystopian nightmare and maybe like me, you doubted that it could
[02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:33.320]  ever happen in America, if the CIA, quoting Paul, the CIA is spying on Congress, who exactly
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:36.360]  can or will stop them.
[02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:42.120]  The comments also state, I look into the eyes of senators and I think I see real fear.
[02:56:42.120 --> 02:56:45.960]  Maybe it's just my imagination, but I think I perceive fear of an intelligence community
[02:56:45.960 --> 02:56:50.480]  drunk with power, unrepentant and uninclined to relinquish power.
[02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:52.520]  Yeah, that's the history of the world.
[02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:59.040]  The senator is set to continue on the track that saw him win the CPAC GOP presidential
[02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:02.640]  nomination strong pull recently during a CPAC speech.
[02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:07.680]  Paul slammed the NSA urging, if you have a cell phone, you are under surveillance.
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:12.120]  I believe what you do on your cell phone is none of their damn business.
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:14.640]  See, it's just straight talk folks, that's what people want.
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:19.160]  And he won the big poll and he's catapulted into the lead poll position to be El Presidente.
[02:57:19.160 --> 02:57:26.160]  I mean, this is what people want is tell it like it is, not play patty cake with the tyrants.
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:32.040]  Ubiquitous voice surveillance, quoting Paul, even overseas, polls in a great deal of content
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:35.240]  from Americans whose telephone visit and work in the target community.
[02:57:35.240 --> 02:57:38.920]  The post reports president and former U.S. officials acknowledged that large numbers
[02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:43.320]  of conversations involving Americans would be gathered from the country where they operate
[02:57:43.320 --> 02:57:44.320]  folks.
[02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:45.320]  That's all a whitewash.
[02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:46.320]  They record everything.
[02:57:46.320 --> 02:57:48.800]  They lied so they recorded nothing got caught.
[02:57:48.800 --> 02:57:50.280]  They're using it for data mining.
[02:57:50.280 --> 02:57:51.280]  It's all happening.
[02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:56.840]  It's being used to target the Associated Press, Fox News, Drudge Report, Info Wars.
[02:57:56.840 --> 02:57:59.040]  It's happening everywhere.
[02:57:59.040 --> 02:58:03.640]  You know, enemies list, government watching us, foyers have come out showing that I'm
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:06.160]  on the enemies list that came out four years ago.
[02:58:06.160 --> 02:58:09.480]  I mean, this is what's going to have media matters run by the White House attacking
[02:58:09.480 --> 02:58:10.480]  me every week.
[02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:11.480]  MSNBC.
[02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:16.920]  I mean, these people are literally usurping scum.
[02:58:16.920 --> 02:58:18.920]  I mean, that's what it is.
[02:58:18.920 --> 02:58:23.080]  And no eating around the edges is going to beat these people.
[02:58:23.080 --> 02:58:26.120]  Just absolutely saying you're illegitimate criminal scum and I expect you to blow stuff
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:27.960]  up and blame it on us.
[02:58:27.960 --> 02:58:31.080]  And when you do, we're going to have reporters there and people to videotape it.
[02:58:31.080 --> 02:58:35.720]  We're going to catch you just like Fast and Furious, just like Benghazi, just like Oklahoma
[02:58:35.720 --> 02:58:37.600]  City, just like all the rest of it.
[02:58:37.600 --> 02:58:39.440]  We know who you murderers are.
[02:58:39.440 --> 02:58:41.360]  We know who the criminal hijackers are.
[02:58:41.360 --> 02:58:44.720]  There's a lot of good people in government and corporations that don't like what's happening
[02:58:44.720 --> 02:58:45.720]  either.
[02:58:45.720 --> 02:58:47.520]  And the people are waking up.
[02:58:47.520 --> 02:58:49.520]  So back off, criminal globalist.
[02:58:49.520 --> 02:59:01.720]  Back off now.
