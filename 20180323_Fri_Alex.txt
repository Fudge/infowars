[00:00.000 --> 00:18.160]  Alex Jones the cure to fake news coming to you live from Austin, Texas
[00:30.000 --> 00:41.320]  well here we are ladies and gentlemen Friday the 23rd day of March 2018 I am
[00:41.320 --> 00:46.440]  your host Alex Jones gonna be here for the next four hours we got Roger Stone
[00:46.440 --> 00:53.240]  popping in to give us his take on Donald Trump's new national security advisor
[00:53.240 --> 01:02.960]  Mr. Bolton who a lot of people really don't like including myself because he
[01:02.960 --> 01:07.600]  still pushes the failed Iraq war and other things like that but the word is
[01:07.600 --> 01:13.820]  on Bolton he knows all the connections he knows all the players in the State
[01:13.820 --> 01:20.960]  Department in the UN in the Pentagon and that he will be an apparatchik or a tool
[01:20.960 --> 01:28.960]  a you know effective munchkin to use his words to carry out the policies that the
[01:28.960 --> 01:32.000]  president wants to carry it out and then he won't sit there and leak
[01:32.000 --> 01:40.520]  information like McMaster did as a final attack in fact it was ten days ago I
[01:40.520 --> 01:49.640]  remember ten days ago last Monday not this money but the number four last that
[01:49.640 --> 01:56.560]  Roger Stone was on the show and he said he will be gone within ten days and nine
[01:56.560 --> 02:01.840]  days later the announcement that a master was gone was there obviously
[02:01.840 --> 02:06.680]  probably accelerated a little bit of time by the fact of the word is he's the
[02:06.680 --> 02:14.040]  leaker on Chief of Staff Kelly saying don't congratulate Putin and then
[02:14.040 --> 02:19.400]  Trump being president again going into what he wants to Obama congratulated
[02:19.400 --> 02:23.320]  Putin on his election you can argue he keeps himself a state power media power
[02:23.320 --> 02:29.960]  that political power so people believe in him and vote for him but it's it's
[02:29.960 --> 02:35.440]  they don't call the Communist Chinese dictator a dictator when he is appointed
[02:35.440 --> 02:41.480]  by the Communist Party and now for life he had them make him a dictator he would
[02:41.480 --> 02:47.080]  strip their powers so the media won't call him a dictator cover of all the
[02:47.080 --> 02:51.520]  papers this weekend when his vice president became co-dictator they said
[02:51.520 --> 02:55.240]  oh he was elected and you'd read the whole article and never tell you by the
[02:55.240 --> 03:01.960]  Politburo by the Central Committee so little things like that getting my
[03:01.960 --> 03:06.640]  head it's not about defending Putin or saying he's perfect I'm just tired of
[03:06.640 --> 03:14.800]  the lies Vladimir Putin is not a dictator a strong man yes a loved strong
[03:14.800 --> 03:24.800]  man the Communist Chinese president is a dictator by the very classic definition
[03:24.800 --> 03:30.560]  of it like his predecessor Mao Zedong I'm gonna stop right there we're gonna
[03:30.560 --> 03:38.600]  get into Bolton I'm gonna get Professor Boyle on who's worked with him and went
[03:38.600 --> 03:45.160]  to school with him and you're nosing he's gonna come on and talk about Bolton
[03:45.160 --> 03:48.680]  today I know Pachennik doesn't like him we're trying to get all him he wants to
[03:48.680 --> 03:53.120]  pop in but we'll get your take on that but for me it's a side issue it's gonna
[03:53.120 --> 03:56.720]  just brief footnotes from these guys because they want to comment and I want
[03:56.720 --> 03:59.680]  to hear what they have to say but I'm not worried about it because you're gonna
[03:59.680 --> 04:04.520]  get Donald Trump's policies what we elected him for not
[04:04.520 --> 04:11.760]  Bolton's so we're gonna be breaking all of that down today
[04:12.680 --> 04:21.600]  there's been a new sickening attack by Stephen Colbert and the main star
[04:21.600 --> 04:27.080]  stupid Hollywood term of Silicon Valley misrepresenting what I said about
[04:27.080 --> 04:30.360]  Silicon Valley what I said I think I even went shooting with that guy once
[04:30.360 --> 04:34.400]  with Mike judge I think I think I met that guy as if I was attacking him
[04:34.400 --> 04:43.680]  personally Thomas Middleditch that's even a real name I was pointing out that
[04:43.680 --> 04:48.240]  the cover of the magazine talk about the triumph of beta males was globalist
[04:48.240 --> 04:54.000]  propaganda so again they always just turn everything around that oh I'm
[04:54.000 --> 05:01.280]  attacking the poor actor no I was attacking the push of beta males I'm so
[05:01.280 --> 05:06.080]  excited the new product at m4warslife.com in a glass bottle two month
[05:06.080 --> 05:12.040]  servings filled to the brim filled to the absolute top the real red pill this
[05:12.040 --> 05:17.120]  is a heart and brain pill a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it
[05:17.120 --> 05:22.520]  but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that quite frankly I just went
[05:22.520 --> 05:26.920]  off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients but it
[05:26.920 --> 05:29.960]  wasn't prescription but they were charging people a hundred two hundred
[05:29.960 --> 05:34.840]  dollars for the formulae and I came up with our own formula working with
[05:34.840 --> 05:41.640]  scientists and developers non-gmo made right here in America 120 capsules and

[06:25.920 --> 06:33.840]  6 Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[06:36.040 --> 06:40.640]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this Friday worldwide
[06:40.640 --> 06:47.240]  transmission the 23rd day of March 2018 I am your host Alex Jones we have a
[06:47.240 --> 06:55.480]  plethora of informative guest joining us today to get into President Trump's new
[06:55.480 --> 07:00.400]  national security advisor Mr. Bolton Paul Joseph Watson Professor Francis
[07:00.400 --> 07:06.720]  Anthony Boyle Roger Stone whose friends with the new national security advisor
[07:06.720 --> 07:11.440]  good friends with him they drink whiskey and play poker together for 30 years so
[07:11.440 --> 07:16.720]  he'll be giving us his take on him he likes Bolton and he says Bolton is an
[07:16.720 --> 07:23.120]  apparatchik and that means he will follow Trump's orders and will not leak in his
[07:23.120 --> 07:27.720]  dog-like in his loyalty so that's the case even though I disagree with some of
[07:27.720 --> 07:32.520]  Boyle's views then I trust the president but the president you know brought some
[07:32.520 --> 07:35.360]  good people and he's brought some bad people in that's what Trump said you're
[07:35.360 --> 07:38.720]  gonna see a lot of hiring and a lot of firing during the campaign he said I'm
[07:38.720 --> 07:43.040]  gonna go through a lot of people till we get the best team that's what
[07:43.040 --> 07:47.480]  corporations and companies do that's what the military does for special units
[07:47.480 --> 07:50.400]  and things is that you've got to go through a lot of people to find the
[07:50.400 --> 07:54.360]  best this thing of just oh you got put in there so now you're there for four
[07:54.360 --> 07:58.920]  years or eight years is what's brought us this whole stagnant situation we're
[07:58.920 --> 08:05.840]  facing as a culture so for me Bolton is a side issue but we will get into John
[08:05.840 --> 08:11.040]  Bolton here today and look at different perspectives of five horrifically bad
[08:11.040 --> 08:16.560]  foreign policy ideas that Donald Trump should disqualify John Bolton for so
[08:16.560 --> 08:24.960]  we're gonna be looking at all of that today obviously the big story though is
[08:24.960 --> 08:33.320]  President Trump's speech yesterday for 15 minutes before he signed the new WTO
[08:33.320 --> 08:39.920]  complaint moving forward with 60 billion first the news said 50 but once again
[08:39.920 --> 08:49.920]  else it was 60 billion dollars but as the president pointed out it's 400 to 500
[08:49.920 --> 08:54.560]  billion a year depending on how you look at the numbers that communist China puts
[08:54.560 --> 09:01.000]  on us like 400 billion classic trade deficit through tariffs unless you look
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.080]  at the corporate taxes every year that stay there because now there's 0% tax
[09:06.080 --> 09:11.280]  they were 15 we were 40 you add that it's another hundred plus billion some
[09:11.280 --> 09:18.920]  numbers have it at 990 billion a year the lowest numbers at about 850 billion a
[09:18.920 --> 09:27.720]  year global trade deficit and 500 billion conservatively of that is China
[09:27.720 --> 09:33.080]  they're they're more than half of it they're the issue and of course the US
[09:33.080 --> 09:38.600]  accuses China of stealing patents in WTO complaint that's like accusing humans
[09:38.600 --> 09:41.480]  of breathing oxygen
[09:41.480 --> 09:49.360]  China disregards everything steals everything on record and then US
[09:49.360 --> 09:57.560]  companies and US courts and the federal marshals politically get the order to
[09:57.560 --> 10:05.800]  stand down and let China engage in the gang raping of this country and the
[10:05.800 --> 10:10.000]  total deindustrialization in the globalist own words to teach us a lesson
[10:10.000 --> 10:14.880]  and to bring us to heal just like Hillary said black people were super
[10:14.880 --> 10:19.920]  predators had to be brought to heal like a dog it's the same mindset of breaking
[10:19.920 --> 10:24.280]  the people through economic conquest and control that's the theme of the New
[10:24.280 --> 10:30.520]  World Order well I've been putting that message out for decades and it's a
[10:30.520 --> 10:32.640]  message that's based on what the globalists have said and what they've
[10:32.640 --> 10:35.440]  done and people like president Trump have been putting that message out for
[10:35.440 --> 10:42.920]  40 years and now we've got somebody in there we've got somebody in there
[10:42.920 --> 10:46.720]  understand what's going on the media's spinning it that it's gonna hurt
[10:46.720 --> 10:51.840]  innovation it's gonna hobble innovation no it's not China puts out a bunch of
[10:51.840 --> 10:57.760]  copied crap as cheaply as they can we're I'm not kidding half of what you buy
[10:57.760 --> 11:01.560]  made in China breaks before you get it out of the box you get it out it's
[11:01.560 --> 11:06.000]  broken or it breaks in a month it is you order you know you'll be sitting there
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.960]  look at these catalogs on the airplane you order you know some laser cat toy
[11:09.960 --> 11:14.600]  like I did where the cats walk around and shoots lasers out it's broken when
[11:14.600 --> 11:19.560]  it comes out of the box I mean it's just it's a joke why do we do this we
[11:19.560 --> 11:23.640]  threw away our industry we threw away quality we threw away everything for
[11:23.640 --> 11:30.040]  the communist Chinese their own people don't even get any of the wealth but
[11:30.040 --> 11:34.760]  think about evil evil always only hurts people including those that are on top
[11:34.760 --> 11:37.840]  they think they're getting ahead but it always ends up hurting them so that's
[11:37.840 --> 11:43.200]  a big news we're gonna be getting into all of that also a Reuters reports it's
[11:43.200 --> 11:47.440]  up on info wars.com US warships because it's one big ship but it's got support
[11:47.440 --> 11:53.360]  ships sail near disputed island in South China Sea official say latest attempt
[11:53.360 --> 11:56.600]  to counter what Washington sees as China's efforts to limit freedom of
[11:56.600 --> 12:00.080]  navigation yeah they're just taking over waterways that have been used for thousands
[12:00.080 --> 12:04.160]  of years by everybody and just saying it's theirs and building artificial islands
[12:04.160 --> 12:10.080]  to expand their range and under 12 miles each time it is incredible that is all
[12:10.080 --> 12:16.600]  coming up but then I've got this stack of news that is just as amazing France
[12:16.600 --> 12:22.320]  has another terror attack two dead dozens injured as ISIS government takes
[12:22.320 --> 12:28.760]  hostages in supermarket Moroccan terrorists demanded release in 2015 Paris
[12:28.760 --> 12:39.120]  attacker Salah Abdeslam meanwhile German minister on migrant a German
[12:39.120 --> 12:45.480]  minister for Merkel says knife crime may be up 1200% but he said don't let
[12:45.480 --> 12:50.600]  people get close to you be sensitive it's your fault the Muslims are stabbing
[12:50.600 --> 12:56.560]  you I you cannot make this stuff up just like the mayor the Green Party mayor
[12:56.560 --> 13:00.080]  of Cologne that told the women that hundreds that got raped in one night on
[13:00.080 --> 13:06.480]  video she said where bracelets that say don't rape me in Arabic and don't dress
[13:06.480 --> 13:12.080]  sexy that's right girls the feminists tell you listen when the sorcerer gonna
[13:12.080 --> 13:16.400]  cut those genitals off there's nothing more liberal white farmers flee South
[13:16.400 --> 13:21.160]  Africa in fear of land grab and then I've got the president the vice president
[13:21.160 --> 13:24.720]  the defense minister and the second biggest party communist leader all on
[13:24.720 --> 13:28.880]  video we heard it last week saying we're gonna take all your land and kill
[13:28.880 --> 13:33.880]  you and then the communist leader came out yesterday and made fun of the whites
[13:33.880 --> 13:36.800]  and said better leave the keys and the tractors and everything if you want to
[13:36.800 --> 13:41.080]  get out of the country alive and called Australia racist for saying they'd take
[13:41.080 --> 13:46.600]  white farmers I mean you got the president saying we're gonna take your
[13:46.600 --> 13:49.240]  land you'll be lucky if you make it out alive you got the communist saying
[13:49.240 --> 13:54.120]  we're gonna slit your throat whites and it's happening everywhere and then when
[13:54.120 --> 13:59.920]  they try to get out the communist leader and others say we're not letting you go
[13:59.920 --> 14:04.120]  we're gonna make sure you turn everything over to us or you did and it's
[14:04.120 --> 14:10.920]  liberal oh it's so liberal white genocide that's coming up it's all coming up
[14:10.920 --> 14:15.680]  today and so much more got a ton of clips David Hogg doesn't get the tension
[14:15.680 --> 14:20.400]  anymore so he's running around and tirades cussing all of this saying
[14:20.400 --> 14:23.960]  horrible things about me you name it we've got those clips coming up and I
[14:23.960 --> 14:27.120]  think he's just a wonderful person and a hero so I'm not gonna say anything bad
[14:27.120 --> 14:31.360]  about him because CNN says I'll have my free speech taken I'm not allowed to
[14:31.360 --> 14:36.120]  criticize grown young men in a man's world cussing at people and shooting their
[14:36.120 --> 14:39.360]  mouths off but we're gonna play those clips coming up and I think he has his
[14:39.360 --> 14:43.880]  free speech I don't I agree with him and I want to thank him for teaching me in

[19:02.720 --> 19:08.240]  medicine introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way
[19:08.240 --> 19:12.840]  to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and
[19:12.840 --> 19:18.520]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[19:18.520 --> 19:22.440]  researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[19:22.440 --> 19:27.120]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[19:27.120 --> 19:31.360]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the
[19:31.360 --> 19:35.720]  fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate
[19:35.720 --> 19:40.920]  seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[19:40.920 --> 19:45.000]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.440]  blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and
[19:49.440 --> 19:54.080]  inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[19:54.080 --> 20:01.320]  head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets
[20:01.320 --> 20:08.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:08.280 --> 20:38.240]  you go back to the eve of the Gulf War the second Gulf War in 2003
[20:38.240 --> 20:46.880]  it was then private citizen Donald Trump who was on Fox News twice and singing in
[20:46.880 --> 20:52.360]  once in the clips we can find saying I don't think this is a good idea I don't
[20:52.360 --> 20:57.680]  think we should go in there Saddam Hussein is not a good guy but he's nothing
[20:57.680 --> 21:01.400]  compared to some other people in the regime why are we destabilizing the area
[21:01.400 --> 21:05.680]  but if we go in it should be quick and we should get out fast they would then
[21:05.680 --> 21:11.080]  take the end of that quote in the Washington Post the New York Times and
[21:11.080 --> 21:16.920]  and cut it off and have him say we need to get in and get out quick no he said
[21:16.920 --> 21:22.840]  we shouldn't do this but if we're gonna do it we need to get in and get out quick
[21:24.280 --> 21:29.760]  now the left hated that fact that they'd all been pretty much pro-war that
[21:29.760 --> 21:38.840]  Trump had been right it was also senator Rand Paul that came out and was
[21:38.840 --> 21:43.240]  against the war ongoing but he wasn't in obviously in office back when all of
[21:43.240 --> 21:48.040]  that all of that started in fact he's just up for reelection here after his
[21:48.040 --> 21:52.800]  first election as a freshman to the US Senate and that whole wave that's brought
[21:52.800 --> 21:58.120]  Trump in and the Tea Party and the Freedom Caucus and the rest of it so that
[21:58.120 --> 22:05.080]  said everybody is freaking out over John Bolton and I'm not because Trump
[22:05.080 --> 22:13.880]  brings in a big diverse group of people take the outgoing economic advisor Mr.
[22:13.880 --> 22:20.800]  Combe well he disagreed with Trump on globalism and nationalism and on
[22:20.800 --> 22:24.440]  tariffs and all the rest of this and Trump used him for a year to find out
[22:24.440 --> 22:29.680]  how the system worked to make all the contacts and now he's gone McMaster is
[22:29.680 --> 22:33.440]  a globalist that has been leaking and has been giving intel to ISIS and al-Qaeda
[22:33.440 --> 22:39.160]  we know that he's been playing a double game and Trump's gotten rid of McMaster
[22:39.160 --> 22:44.640]  everyone McMaster went on television last year back in April and May and said
[22:44.640 --> 22:49.560]  we're going to have an invasion of Syria we're going to take a shot out
[22:49.560 --> 22:53.360]  Trump said no we're not they didn't start the war we're gonna kick ISIS and al-Qaeda
[22:53.360 --> 22:56.800]  out then we're gonna stabilize the area and try to have a coalition government
[22:56.800 --> 23:02.960]  with Saudi Arabia and others being part of it and now that's happening the
[23:02.960 --> 23:07.680]  beginnings of that's happening so Trump is really pragmatically whether it's
[23:07.680 --> 23:12.080]  North Korea or whether it's Syria really trying to stabilize things but doing
[23:12.080 --> 23:18.000]  that through positions of strength saying to China no you're not allowed to
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.520]  build artificial islands all over the South China Sea right off the coast of
[23:21.520 --> 23:26.640]  Philippines even an old ancient Chinese maps that are a thousand years old they
[23:26.640 --> 23:32.400]  don't claim that they own that area they've never had claim on it and it's
[23:32.400 --> 23:35.960]  out of control so Trump's got US warships right there in their face
[23:35.960 --> 23:45.600]  escorting Japanese and South Korean and Saudi Arabian and British and Moroccan
[23:45.600 --> 23:51.960]  and American ships through there and that's because that's what the United
[23:51.960 --> 23:57.640]  States is doing is securing our economic position using our military to protect
[23:57.640 --> 24:01.680]  our seaways and to protect our commerce and industry but not using it to go
[24:01.680 --> 24:05.800]  start wars not using it to destabilize not using it to start things up
[24:05.800 --> 24:12.920]  Trump is a businessman he is pragmatic he knows real warfare 90% of it is
[24:12.920 --> 24:20.480]  economic and informational less than 10% is physical the communist Chinese have
[24:20.480 --> 24:24.320]  got 98% of the world's rare earth minerals but they didn't have any of it
[24:24.320 --> 24:29.160]  50 years ago they've got giant farming operations in Latin America Africa Asia
[24:29.160 --> 24:33.920]  you name it they are rapidly expanding and it would be the Chinese century headed
[24:33.920 --> 24:37.640]  up by a communist dictatorship that's anti-american and very very dangerous
[24:37.640 --> 24:45.960]  Trump realizes the single pronged spear attack of military power is not going to
[24:45.960 --> 24:51.200]  do it we need the penser attack of military power economic power but with
[24:51.200 --> 24:59.040]  a trifecta the cultural superiority of free-market Americana that is the
[24:59.040 --> 25:03.600]  trifecta and that beats the communist Chinese and their monopoly command and
[25:03.600 --> 25:09.040]  control system they are a joke unless America basically doesn't use its
[25:09.040 --> 25:15.240]  gravitas and its soft power and so Trump got up there with the vice president
[25:15.240 --> 25:20.360]  said the era of economic surrenders over we got these clips coming up he also
[25:20.360 --> 25:24.560]  talked about how he meets with the South Korean and the Chinese dictator and
[25:24.560 --> 25:29.400]  you know all the rest of them and they smile they laugh they know it was
[25:29.400 --> 25:35.160]  globalism they know it was the trilateral Commission set up 40 years
[25:35.160 --> 25:43.080]  ago 41 years ago they know it was all done to siphon off the United States
[25:43.080 --> 25:47.120]  wealth and build it overseas where it's command and control and vertically
[25:47.120 --> 25:55.400]  integrated and so they've got $500 billion depending on how you slice it
[25:55.400 --> 25:59.560]  400 to 600 billion of our 900 plus billion dollar trade deficits with China
[25:59.560 --> 26:04.440]  more than half of it is and he's saying you're lucky it's only 60 billion that's
[26:04.440 --> 26:13.240]  why it's the first of many orders because you guys are screwing us over and
[26:13.240 --> 26:19.320]  you guys are using your own multinational power of all these groups of
[26:19.320 --> 26:25.040]  countries as president Trump said coming together Europe communist China you
[26:25.040 --> 26:30.160]  name it to screw the United States because the other countries want deals
[26:30.160 --> 26:33.920]  South Korea just doesn't let China push it around Japan doesn't do that vice
[26:33.920 --> 26:37.280]  versa same thing with other BRICS countries same thing with the EU they
[26:37.280 --> 26:41.720]  all make deals with each other constantly horse-dealing horse-trading on
[26:41.720 --> 26:50.920]  who's gonna get this who's gonna get that it's all reciprocal minutia instead
[26:50.920 --> 26:53.920]  we have this fake libertarian movement that's not libertarian that's economic
[26:53.920 --> 26:58.200]  surrender the Heritage Foundation all of it runs up this huge white flag back in
[26:58.200 --> 27:06.160]  the 70s it's already begun before that and says we're for free trade we're for
[27:06.160 --> 27:09.920]  fair trade we're for free trade we're for a fair trade fair trade fair trade
[27:09.920 --> 27:16.040]  free trade free trade which means no controls no tariffs no nothing dump
[27:16.040 --> 27:24.080]  whatever you want on us but not the other way around and that's the issue is
[27:24.080 --> 27:30.840]  that if if the world wants to be in an orgy of truly free market and ship
[27:30.840 --> 27:34.680]  anything around you want anything you want that would probably actually be
[27:34.680 --> 27:39.360]  good for innovation and overall a good thing but not when you're 50 years
[27:39.360 --> 27:42.280]  behind the eight ball of being selectively screwed over and your
[27:42.280 --> 27:48.720]  industry's been transferred and it's not an orgy we are chained up by our
[27:48.720 --> 27:53.280]  ankles with a line of 180 countries raping us and I hate to use our analogy
[27:53.280 --> 28:00.400]  but that's what it is we got our hands on our ankles we're getting annihilated
[28:00.400 --> 28:04.480]  politically financially culturally we're paying for all of it going into
[28:04.480 --> 28:08.480]  massive debt because criminals hijacked our country and leveraged it to build
[28:08.480 --> 28:15.000]  their own global empire and now at the 11th hour here comes Trump who isn't
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.280]  out to get the country he just tries to do a little something for us it's almost
[28:19.280 --> 28:25.480]  like giving us a wet rag for our forehead while they slit our throat and you
[28:25.480 --> 28:28.560]  see oxygen come back in the economy and you see things start turn around and the
[28:28.560 --> 28:32.080]  globalists are pissed because they know if you wake up to that and understand
[28:32.080 --> 28:37.760]  this is about a sign their game is over yeah the Asian age gets it free trade a
[28:37.760 --> 28:42.320]  corporate scam that just means they dump whatever they want on you and exploit
[28:42.320 --> 28:47.600]  you and have regulations on the other side so you can't sell anything one way
[28:47.600 --> 28:53.120]  streets aren't libertarian their frauds and Trump is in there like a bull in a

[34:48.920 --> 34:54.360]  in the times of london you can read them online and you read stuff you wrote
[34:54.360 --> 35:02.400]  like 1890 and you look at it you go my goodness 130 years later 128 years
[35:02.400 --> 35:10.320]  later they did it well you might want to read the next few chapters of what
[35:10.320 --> 35:15.680]  globalists then said in the 30s they were going to do and what they said in
[35:15.680 --> 35:19.240]  the 60s they were going to do because what they wrote in the 30s they've now
[35:19.240 --> 35:25.120]  pretty much gotten who am I talking about all just Huxley best-selling
[35:25.120 --> 35:31.640]  author his brother head of the world eugenics society after Hitler made them

[36:15.120 --> 36:23.000]  get attacked everywhere because only academics are supposed to read this
[36:23.000 --> 36:30.440]  stuff well guess what if you understand brave new world you understand why I
[36:30.440 --> 36:34.160]  talked about the cover of the Hollywood Reporter magazine the triumph of beta
[36:34.160 --> 36:41.840]  males a few weeks ago and they made fun of that with the main star of Silicon
[36:41.840 --> 36:52.160]  Valley and it's amazing that I didn't attack him personally I know Mike judge
[36:52.160 --> 36:56.920]  in fact I've met that guy South by Southwest four years ago I've been
[36:56.920 --> 36:59.840]  shooting with basically the whole cast that goes back to the beginning I've
[36:59.840 --> 37:04.040]  told you that there's videos and photos of it the point is is that and we're
[37:04.040 --> 37:09.360]  gonna Roger Stone here in one minute the point I'm getting in here is that's how
[37:09.360 --> 37:12.880]  they turn this whole thing around of their pushing beta male they're pushing
[37:12.880 --> 37:16.280]  the end of the family they're pushing soy boys the sperm counts dropping the
[37:16.280 --> 37:20.560]  testosterone's dropping everybody's getting cancer women are getting cancer
[37:20.560 --> 37:26.840]  women are hyper feminized men are feminized it's an agenda and then instead
[37:26.840 --> 37:30.640]  of me going oh look Hollywood Reporter
[37:32.320 --> 37:36.480]  instead of them saying oh Jones criticized the push by the government for
[37:36.480 --> 37:43.520]  beta males and by the UN in UNESCO they turned around and say oh he attacked you
[37:43.520 --> 37:48.560]  as a person saying you're a beta male so that men that feel like beta males think
[37:48.560 --> 37:54.560]  I'm attacking them and they point out on the show we're not beta males well no I
[37:54.560 --> 37:59.040]  know that I said they have alpha males poses beta males to make that cool so
[37:59.040 --> 38:02.080]  they again misrepresent everything I said can you guys pull up the actual
[38:02.080 --> 38:07.640]  cover I just type in Hollywood Reporter the triumph of the beta male and it's
[38:07.640 --> 38:16.240]  it's we had articles in infowars.com just type in infowars.com after it and
[38:16.240 --> 38:21.600]  input triumph of the beta male Watson's headline was Hollywood Reporter celebrates
[38:21.600 --> 38:25.840]  the triumph of the beta male if radio listeners want to see it there it is
[38:25.840 --> 38:31.000]  good job thank you new Hollywood Reporter covers celebrities triumph of the beta
[38:31.000 --> 38:36.400]  male and then it is a not even subliminal of gay men that's the image of it I'm
[38:36.400 --> 38:40.960]  not saying they're gay men stacking where they're all putting their hand in
[38:40.960 --> 38:48.160]  their pocket behind each other as they have a what's the name of that Hollywood
[38:48.160 --> 38:51.160]  bombards you with so much of the stuff I even know the fact twig name of it it's
[38:51.160 --> 38:57.700]  called the well I'm not gonna say it on here so it's all in your face and my
[38:57.700 --> 39:03.640]  issue is why is this all what we're forfeit because as oldest Huxley said
[39:03.640 --> 39:08.640]  my brother Julian Huxley runs the society we're gonna in the family make
[39:08.640 --> 39:13.040]  men more feminine make women more male then make them sterile and then face
[39:13.040 --> 39:17.320]  humans out all to all together that's the globalist program and it's a stated
[39:17.320 --> 39:21.420]  fact and that's what Colbert every time he attacks me it's on chemicals in the
[39:21.420 --> 39:26.480]  water making the frogs bisexual or sterile or those issues because they've
[39:26.480 --> 39:31.840]  got a directive as they process humanity into this beta male sterile program to
[39:31.840 --> 39:36.720]  make it a joke to make it funny and to neutralize it because I'm here warning
[39:36.720 --> 39:42.000]  you about their main assault I'm gonna stop right there joining us for the
[39:42.000 --> 39:48.520]  balance of this hour is the former head of the Trump campaign and of course best
[39:48.520 --> 39:55.760]  selling author the only member of the folks with Nixon supposedly with the
[39:55.760 --> 39:58.920]  plumbers to not go to jail because he wasn't involved just quite a historical
[39:58.920 --> 40:03.360]  figure Roger Stone dreaded by the left dreaded by the globalist he knows John
[40:03.360 --> 40:09.000]  Bolton now tapped or a place McMaster he predicted last Monday on this show 10
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.040]  days ago that he would be gone within 10 days and he was gone within 9 and
[40:14.040 --> 40:17.160]  people are flipping out saying this is one of the architects of the fake Iraq
[40:17.160 --> 40:19.960]  war something Trump was against something Stone was against at the time so
[40:19.960 --> 40:24.240]  was I why is this happening well Roger has the answer because he plays poker and
[40:24.240 --> 40:27.800]  drinks whiskey with Bolton going back for decades and he says we don't have to
[40:27.800 --> 40:31.480]  worry our little heads about it and I tend to trust Roger let's see what Mr.
[40:31.480 --> 40:37.200]  Stone has to say Mr. Stone thank you Alex you know I I do know John Bolton
[40:37.200 --> 40:41.560]  very well I think he's a good man he was a early a supporter of President Ronald
[40:41.560 --> 40:46.360]  Reagan he's a real conservative I don't think he is one of the architects of our
[40:46.360 --> 40:51.800]  failed Iraq policy I think he is an operative a highly skilled one a very
[40:51.800 --> 40:58.240]  capable man carrying out the orders of his boss in those days George W Bush he's
[40:58.240 --> 41:04.000]  a vast improvement over general HR McMaster whose clear ties to George
[41:04.000 --> 41:09.640]  Soros and the Open Society Institute we established right here at info wars I
[41:09.640 --> 41:17.040]  honestly think that you will find Bolton to be a most capable executor of
[41:17.040 --> 41:22.480]  Donald Trump's foreign policy as opposed to a guy making policy himself and let
[41:22.480 --> 41:25.480]  me just add this not to brag but why they fear info wars why they fear you
[41:25.480 --> 41:29.120]  why there's a probably 500 articles a day lying about you misquoting you
[41:29.120 --> 41:32.240]  misquoting me when the lies have reached next level we'll talk about some of that
[41:32.240 --> 41:35.680]  next segment people can understand the level of propaganda we're dealing with
[41:35.680 --> 41:41.760]  here and why they're so afraid but you wrote the articles for info wars six
[41:41.760 --> 41:46.480]  months ago exposing McMaster and this direct Soros mole and that McMaster was
[41:46.480 --> 41:49.280]  Soros funding and you talked to Trump obviously won't talk about that but
[41:49.280 --> 41:52.960]  Trump was shocked then he discovered McMaster was one of the main leakers just
[41:52.960 --> 41:57.160]  got caught again last week with the whole Kelly thing and the in this week
[41:57.160 --> 42:02.320]  congratulations Putin so it is the info wars com articles that got directly to
[42:02.320 --> 42:05.960]  the president that were hand-delivered to him that now caused the same reaction
[42:05.960 --> 42:10.120]  for him to remove McMaster so that's a whole nother story I think you're
[42:10.120 --> 42:15.360]  absolutely right Alex the the president is glad to hear alternative views and
[42:15.360 --> 42:19.760]  he I think he knows that he doesn't always necessarily get the straight
[42:19.760 --> 42:23.960]  story from the tight circle around him that's why he's been making these big
[42:23.960 --> 42:29.080]  changes that's why we have swapped out our Secretary of State why we have
[42:29.080 --> 42:33.320]  swapped out our CIA director why we are swapping out our national security
[42:33.320 --> 42:38.440]  advisor these are all improvements from the previous appointees in my opinion
[42:38.440 --> 42:42.440]  and we could see that Trump has set sail in year number two at a rampage
[42:42.440 --> 42:47.400]  ramming speed for nationalism and to fulfill his other promises on so many
[42:47.400 --> 42:52.000]  fronts so I I agree with you I think Bolton is an aporagic from what we know
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.240]  and he will ever make the will of the president and that's what matters let's
[42:55.240 --> 43:00.200]  talk about that in Fiona Hill the Soros mole on the other side info wars life
[43:00.200 --> 43:04.720]  is launching its newest product we're really really proud of it it's a best

[47:07.800 --> 47:29.240]  Roger Stone last Monday said within 10 days McMaster will be gone for leaking
[47:29.240 --> 47:34.000]  and because he's been working with George Soros incredible he's gone he told
[47:34.000 --> 47:41.280]  you the back in January of this year he said by the middle of March Tillerson
[47:41.280 --> 47:48.040]  will be gone he has the sources as you know and so now is he selling us out
[47:48.040 --> 47:52.560]  with John Bolton what's really happening and what's the next shoot a drop
[47:52.560 --> 47:56.120]  we're also watching coming up next hour Trump is set to give a press conference
[47:56.120 --> 48:00.680]  on the omnibus bill this is the swamp striking back I would expect the
[48:00.680 --> 48:03.840]  president to say he's gonna veto it to send it back because all it has is
[48:03.840 --> 48:07.280]  defense doesn't even have the border wall and it is the biggest budget we've
[48:07.280 --> 48:14.200]  ever seen we'll get Roger's take on that as well right now Roger Alex I think
[48:14.200 --> 48:18.680]  John Bolton is a good man he's a solid conservative an early supporter of
[48:18.680 --> 48:22.840]  Ronald Reagan I think he's more of an aporec chick an operative rather than a
[48:22.840 --> 48:27.800]  policymaker he's very highly capable and I think he will carry out the orders of
[48:27.800 --> 48:32.760]  his boss in this case president Donald Trump the first order of business has to
[48:32.760 --> 48:38.640]  be firing Fiona Hill the deputy national security advisor who has previously
[48:38.640 --> 48:44.440]  spent seven years working for George Soros and who was improbably is today a
[48:44.440 --> 48:50.960]  member of the Trump White House staff amazing again what's the next shoot a
[48:50.960 --> 48:54.960]  drop and what does this signify the shakeup we're already seeing action wise
[48:54.960 --> 48:59.600]  from Trump if you thought year one was good standing up to China and its $500
[48:59.600 --> 49:03.120]  million trade deficit with us standing up to their warships threatening the
[49:03.120 --> 49:07.800]  Philippines Japan and others moving US warships in point blank range making
[49:07.800 --> 49:12.040]  North Korea come to the table hundreds of billions of new jobs millions of new
[49:12.040 --> 49:16.160]  jobs themselves the border becoming secured crushing the back of political
[49:16.160 --> 49:20.640]  correctness pulling us out of TPP renegotiating NAFTA and GATT I mean
[49:20.640 --> 49:24.680]  wow the shakeup we're seeing is very nationalistic to say what you want about
[49:24.680 --> 49:29.280]  Mr. Bolton and he's got problems obviously but he is a nationalist an
[49:29.280 --> 49:33.840]  anti-globalist well I would say this Alex the next thing that I believe the
[49:33.840 --> 49:38.280]  president is going to pull out of his hat is the denuclearization of North
[49:38.280 --> 49:43.080]  Korea my sources tell me that there's a deal on the table that could be
[49:43.080 --> 49:48.120]  effectuated that would be a great plus for world peace now let's see what the
[49:48.120 --> 49:53.240]  president's critics have to say if he pulls that off Roger I've been asking
[49:53.240 --> 49:57.920]  the questions here but I got to go back to this McMaster how did you know last
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.480]  Monday not this money last Monday nine ten days ago that he would be gone within
[50:01.480 --> 50:05.920]  ten days and again Fiona Hill what's your intel on her because is it she the
[50:05.920 --> 50:12.000]  key nexus with Soros well obviously Alex like any journalist I cannot give up my
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.360]  info wars sources but sources at the highest level in the White House told
[50:16.360 --> 50:22.800]  me that McMaster was on thin ice last year he was survived only because of the
[50:22.800 --> 50:27.560]  shift from Reince Priebus to General Kelly and General Kelly saved his job
[50:27.560 --> 50:33.680]  we predicted some weeks ago that he was back on the skids I predicted Monday his
[50:33.680 --> 50:40.800]  firing was ten days away you recall that Sarah Sanders a very nice lady vehemently
[50:40.800 --> 50:45.840]  denied that said there were no changes being anticipated at the NSA now nine
[50:45.840 --> 50:53.480]  days later he's out info wars once again tomorrow's news today as far as Fiona
[50:53.480 --> 50:57.280]  Hill is concerned I have to believe that Bolton will bring in his own deputy
[50:57.280 --> 51:01.480]  I expect to be that deputy to be a nationalist like Bolton and I think it
[51:01.480 --> 51:07.880]  is bye-bye Fiona Hill well I know Bolton is a nationalist and he also doesn't
[51:07.880 --> 51:13.000]  like radical Islam my problem is even if he's a nationalist he doesn't seem to
[51:13.000 --> 51:17.240]  find a war he doesn't like I understand we need hawks to make North Korea get
[51:17.240 --> 51:21.680]  in line and China and others but again I just go back to our listeners being
[51:21.680 --> 51:26.320]  really really worried about this I'm not really worried because I trust Trump he
[51:26.320 --> 51:31.780]  keeps bringing people in and finding out who will execute operations and so as
[51:31.780 --> 51:37.600]  you said he is an apparatchik or a tool and he knows everybody in the UN in the
[51:37.600 --> 51:41.320]  State Department in the CIA in the Defense Department so if Trump wants
[51:41.320 --> 51:46.440]  somebody that knows the lay of the land as a scout into this whole thing to take
[51:46.440 --> 51:50.200]  control of our military then John Bolton is the perfect guy it's my analogy from
[51:50.200 --> 51:55.440]  during the campaign I said I don't expect Trump to not get some goblin guides
[51:55.440 --> 51:59.640]  when he goes into Mordor and I don't expect him to not get some goblin blood
[51:59.640 --> 52:05.000]  on him or goblin slop I just don't want to you know catching kissing goblins I
[52:05.000 --> 52:08.920]  don't want to catch him in bed with a goblin and that's really what it comes
[52:08.920 --> 52:14.000]  down to well but just think what a vast improvement Bolton will be over General
[52:14.000 --> 52:20.640]  McMaster McMaster was a pipeline to Soros McMaster was pushing to expand our
[52:20.640 --> 52:24.800]  involvement in Afghanistan and Syria I don't think you'll see this kind of
[52:24.800 --> 52:28.320]  stuff from John Bolton I actually think I'm balanced the president's made an
[52:28.320 --> 52:32.520]  excellent choice and I think we will be praising Bolton months from now and
[52:32.520 --> 52:37.520]  weren't you I mean I forget what's off record what's on record didn't somebody
[52:37.520 --> 52:40.520]  very close to you maybe the guy wearing a black hat right down at
[52:40.520 --> 52:45.720]  Roger Stone didn't you recommend Bolton to the president I knew that he was
[52:45.720 --> 52:50.480]  under consideration I said he was a very good man I didn't nominate him or
[52:50.480 --> 52:54.680]  anything there was some discussion that he might need to shave his mustache to
[52:54.680 --> 52:58.320]  get hired fortunately that didn't happen because somebody photoshopped a
[52:58.320 --> 53:02.600]  picture of him without the mustache frankly he looked ridiculous so I think
[53:02.600 --> 53:05.360]  the president's make an excellent choice by the way you're not joking the
[53:05.360 --> 53:08.720]  president hates his mustache that's really true it's his mustache I mean
[53:08.720 --> 53:12.520]  Trump tells he shaved that damn thing off what is that a president what's the
[53:12.520 --> 53:18.040]  quote clean-cut look you know he likes that clean-cut look and he likes to
[53:18.040 --> 53:22.640]  joke to Bolton with Bolton about his Wilford Brimley style mustache but
[53:22.640 --> 53:28.280]  frankly I look I'm glad he got the job I think conservatives anti-globalists
[53:28.280 --> 53:32.480]  will be praising Bolton in a matter of months why does it bolted Bolton shaved
[53:32.480 --> 53:37.120]  the mustache the president asked him to well it's kind of a personal thing I
[53:37.120 --> 53:40.760]  mean Alex if somebody asked you to change your hairdo would you do it no
[53:40.760 --> 53:44.960]  well it's only because I don't think about it I mean I don't put anything in
[53:44.960 --> 53:47.520]  my hair I comment about 30 seconds in the morning as viewers should probably
[53:47.520 --> 53:52.720]  notice at the time now there he is without a mustache yeah bring back bing
[53:52.720 --> 53:57.640]  back the stash oh my gosh it does look like like he has like a mop broom or
[53:57.640 --> 54:03.040]  like one of those dust brooms under his nose getting serious you always have a
[54:03.040 --> 54:07.280]  lot of stuff on your radar what else are you looking at right now well there's a
[54:07.280 --> 54:11.440]  big move today because the Daily Beast which is one of the least credible news
[54:11.440 --> 54:16.880]  organizations in the country believes that they have proved that Gustav 2.0
[54:16.880 --> 54:21.720]  is a Russian hacker which allows them to revive the headline Trump associate
[54:21.720 --> 54:26.240]  Roger Stone was in touch with Russian hacker anybody who will look at that
[54:26.240 --> 54:31.000]  exchange between Goose for 2.0 will realize it is perfunctory it is
[54:31.000 --> 54:35.040]  innocuous no no it's you on a message board as a journalist I mean we were
[54:35.040 --> 54:39.080]  reaching out as well we reached out to all the hackers we want the scoops it's
[54:39.080 --> 54:43.720]  a smear so the point is my conversation with him anyway was ex post facto it
[54:43.720 --> 54:48.560]  happened long after the DNC material had been published by WikiLeaks this is
[54:48.560 --> 54:52.640]  meaningless but it gives the left an opportunity to recycle that headline
[54:52.640 --> 54:57.520]  Trump associate Roger Stone communicated with Russian hacker it's fake
[54:57.520 --> 55:01.280]  news Alex what do you think China is gonna do they say quote they're gonna
[55:01.280 --> 55:06.320]  fight till the end against our quote tariffs when they're the ones with the
[55:06.320 --> 55:12.240]  tariffs on us look I think this is all negotiating posture between both sides
[55:12.240 --> 55:15.560]  the Chinese have figured out what all these foreign countries have figured
[55:15.560 --> 55:19.640]  out Trump is not a pushover Trump will not draw a line in the sand and then
[55:19.640 --> 55:23.920]  watch you walk over it Trump means business and there's there's mutually
[55:23.920 --> 55:28.480]  beneficial business to be done between the United States and China Trump is
[55:28.480 --> 55:33.360]  above all a deal maker who wants what's best the United States so how much of
[55:33.360 --> 55:38.680]  this is posturing for the negotiations ahead I think that's most of it but
[55:38.680 --> 55:41.720]  Trump said that they all laugh when he meets them because they know it's all
[55:41.720 --> 55:45.560]  one-sided globalism and the era of our surrender is as Vice President Pence
[55:45.560 --> 55:50.920]  said is over thank you Roger Stone well I think in all honesty when the
[55:50.920 --> 55:53.920]  president went to his first international meeting where he was
[55:53.920 --> 55:58.840]  essentially snubbed by all these snotty European leaders they made an
[55:58.840 --> 56:03.240]  enormous mistake all they did I think was forced the president to double down
[56:03.240 --> 56:07.840]  and his resolve to bust up their combine and get better trade relations for the
[56:07.840 --> 56:12.000]  United States never underestimate Donald Trump that's right thank you Roger
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.480]  Stone thank you Alex what an amazing time to be alive right now ladies and
[56:16.480 --> 56:22.400]  gentlemen what an incredible time to see such positive things happening and it's
[56:22.400 --> 56:26.560]  it's just riveting to know they tried to intimidate destroy Trump try to
[56:26.560 --> 56:30.080]  destroy his family try to destroy my family and it didn't work that said the
[56:30.080 --> 56:34.120]  new thing I'm gonna cover a little bit later in the next hour is all these
[56:34.120 --> 56:41.640]  articles NPR and others where they misrepresent what I've said here's one
[56:41.640 --> 56:48.640]  out of the New Zealand newspaper and it says that Alex Jones has been banned off
[56:48.640 --> 56:55.800]  YouTube for bullying children NPR is running reports almost every day I've
[56:55.800 --> 56:59.480]  heard three of them this week that have been sent to me saying Jones has been
[56:59.480 --> 57:05.840]  sued for saying no one died in Parkland so they're going even further than lying
[57:05.840 --> 57:10.400]  and saying that I bullied David Hogger said that he was a crisis actor and
[57:10.400 --> 57:13.520]  said that he wasn't in the school I never said that I said they've been picked
[57:13.520 --> 57:18.800]  as spokesperson they are on the acting club they admit their actors but they're
[57:18.800 --> 57:24.440]  out here putting a PR stand-up so it's next level folks I'm not being sued for
[57:24.440 --> 57:28.680]  saying nobody died at Parkland I'm being sued by the Vatican basically the
[57:28.680 --> 57:32.720]  the black Pope and Georgetown University for nothing to end the First
[57:32.720 --> 57:36.000]  Amendment a foreign power is trying to end the First Amendment and my lawyer
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.960]  said that suits a complete joke and a total fraud and nothing they say I said
[57:39.960 --> 57:43.720]  I said it'll be thrown out summary judgment but they want the fraudulent
[57:43.720 --> 57:47.160]  headlines to make it look like we're going down and we're in trouble when
[57:47.160 --> 57:51.280]  we're winning and they're losing it's been sold out for months and now it's
[57:51.280 --> 57:57.000]  back it's my Coz x plus lower price more ingredients because we scaled up
[57:57.000 --> 58:02.160]  signed to your contract with even bigger organic manufacturer and producer
[58:02.160 --> 58:08.840]  scalability but now we're able to go at 30% off to $27 instead of $39 50% off
[58:08.840 --> 58:12.920]  because there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient my Coz x now it's the
[58:12.920 --> 58:15.960]  other side of the equation but I think it's about probiotics and how great they
[58:15.960 --> 58:19.960]  are for your gut because of toxins the environment pesticides herbicides but
[58:19.960 --> 58:24.480]  more importantly than bad bacteria the probiotics help this place yeast mold
[58:24.480 --> 58:30.480]  create slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that
[58:30.480 --> 58:33.240]  get in there it causes all sorts of serious issues well this has got a
[58:33.240 --> 58:38.220]  bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime
[58:38.220 --> 58:42.160]  wall don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late pick up a

[59:38.440 --> 59:41.800]  America stands with Trump stands against the globalists and their satanic

[59:45.320 --> 59:54.400]  they're coming back against us so we need your support you're listening to the
[59:54.400 --> 59:57.880]  Alex Jones show
[59:57.880 --> 01:00:14.720]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:36.640]  you know coming up we have the dramatic footage of Owen shroyer going to the
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:41.240]  city council yesterday and putting on an anti-famask and saying a imagine of
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:46.760]  armed men were outside of this building and weren't letting people in the city
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.080]  council well he said a month ago that happened to me in Austin Texas and
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.720]  here's the video and he provided them the video and played at the chamber and
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:59.240]  it's dramatic I'm going to retweet it out at real Alex Jones right now because
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.680]  it posted yesterday and then ended up scrolling off info wars calm and news
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:11.880]  wars calm it's a big deal now we have a professor Francis Boyle joining us that
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.600]  is not a big fan of John Bolton and a lot of listeners will say well you just
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.760]  had Roger Stone on his friends with him and said nice things we're gonna have
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:24.400]  somebody on that hates him because we're not a cult we don't sit there like the
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.520]  mainline right-wing or the mainline left-wing and have one view and one thing
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:34.800]  I come up with and then that's what we go with we are going with experts out
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.640]  there respected people that know Bolton to give you their opinion and you can
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:44.200]  make it up yourself I'm saying it doesn't matter to me until I see Bolton
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.160]  start actually having influence because if he's just going to be a
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:53.040]  apparatchik as Trump has a very diverse cabinet and that's fine because you saw
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.520]  him bring in the Goldman Sachs people and then they didn't have any sway and
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:01.600]  then they left so Trump has a strategy and we're gonna be looking at every
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.000]  angle of it with Francis Boyle coming up here on the other side of this break
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.920]  he'll leave us at the bottom of the air and then I'm gonna open the phones up
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:12.160]  with a balance and play a bunch of key clips that we've got a lot of them today
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:15.920]  that are really important some of the new clips Trump is set to have his press
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:21.560]  conference any minute so we've got folks with watchful eyes you'll see that crew
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.720]  in there a lot of chatter going on they're just focused on the news and
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:30.800]  they're watching to see when President Trump starts his press conference we'll
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.600]  give you the excerpts of that or go to it live but I predict he's going to send
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.840]  there's some good things in the omnibus spending bills some bad things but that
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.480]  he is not going to sign it because it doesn't have the border wall and because
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:48.320]  it has too much frivolous spending in it the swamp is delivering a giant stinking
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.480]  mess forward but we'll see what the president does he hasn't signaled
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:57.960]  completely yet that said I don't think the president's perfect I like the fact
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:01.160]  that we're returning sovereignty to the country I like the fact that the
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.240]  globalist and the communist Chinese dictator and all these people are so
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.200]  upset at Trump and I like the fact our economy is showing signs of turning
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:13.800]  around and I like the fact that Trump has drawn out the globalist and their
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:17.880]  operatives and really expose them has had so much courage to go through all
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:23.360]  this and because I supported Trump I have people in every restaurant I showed
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:31.000]  in in Austin where my family's been in and around Austin since 1822 before it
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:37.320]  was Austin my family's been here since 1822 raised Colonel Travis's son
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:40.960]  involved the founding involved the Declaration of Independence involved with
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:46.080]  the presidency all of it everything did never be family at the Alamo though
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:52.840]  contrary to popular belief and in my own town they come over with their
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.040]  children and tell me I'm a Russian agent that's going to prison and get in my
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:00.960]  face or they reach out their hand so that I reach it out so they can pull it
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:09.040]  back like they're five years old go oh yeah oh I mean it is amazing to deal
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.640]  with it I've never seen conservatives or Christians or libertarians act like
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:21.000]  this the modern left is a frothing warmongering drooling hateful fascistic
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.520]  anti-free speech mob and and of course every person that comes over and does
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.840]  that ten people come over to shake my hand liberals conservatives black white
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:36.280]  old young but the entitlement the hatred of oh by the way they're all white
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:42.400]  everyone that comes over and confronts me is a weird mentally ill neurotic race
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:47.760]  obsessed Russia obsessed want to be ruling class political aporachic of
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:51.720]  mainstream corporate media that thinks they found Hitler rolled into Stalin

[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:21.560]  domestic it's Alex Jones well I opposed Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton as
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.000]  they were selling us out the communist Chinese and others and setting up a
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.840]  police state in America and then I opposed George W. Bush because she was
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:34.200]  involved with radical Islamists in the deep state and the globalist I'm being
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:39.160]  heavily involved in 9-11 attacks and I pioneered that day one exposing the
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.200]  bombs and building seven and interviewed people that would be killed a week
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:48.080]  later like the deputy head of emergency management mr. Jennings and I went
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:54.440]  through hell I'm not complaining I'm just saying I have integrity and so I
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:07:00.320]  don't just get on board the Trump bandwagon for nothing we were on over a
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:12.280]  hundred affiliates in 2001 I was I don't know 27 28 years old I'm 44 now and I
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:18.240]  was on over a hundred affiliates I had four crew members and I was bringing in
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:22.120]  three million dollars a year and I was putting it back in and building an
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:30.800]  infrastructure with it and within one month of exposing 9-11 as an inside job
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:37.520]  I went down to about 26 affiliates and it ended the network was just my
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:41.200]  satellite provider but to their credit people tried to get them to take me off
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.720]  the air and Ted Anderson calls it was just killing you and you're losing
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.680]  millions and we're losing millions but I'll back you you know coming out and
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:50.320]  expose us because you know that that's your right so that's that's the test
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:54.320]  credit that's why I still use him as a satellite uplink and I have for 20 plus
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.760]  years but the reason I say all that is I don't go with the wind of what is
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:05.200]  popular I'm not trying to win popularity contest I'm trying to force into the
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:09.760]  ethos into the new birth of political understanding what's going on I'm trying
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:14.720]  to hit the bar boy I'm trying to be the shock fruit so when they lie about me in
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.360]  Georgetown suits me and the globalists come after me and they have hundreds and
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:21.560]  hundreds of articles a day conservatively sometimes thousands and in the
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:26.240]  daily show and an entertainment programs lying about me and you know say hey you
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.640]  heard all shown six black people oh yeah heard that they don't show a clip it's
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:35.440]  pure defamation trying to get some crazy person to kill me Tom Brokaw Dan rather
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:40.120]  they're all say take me off the air and why because that people like Dr. Francis
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:43.920]  Boyle on show this isn't about left or right it's about Americana it's about
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:49.520]  Renaissance it's about common sense Trump has a lot of globalist enemies he's
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:56.240]  just bringing power back to the US in my view that said John Bolton clearly is a
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:02.040]  Bush minion an aporachic he knows what went on on 9-11 and a lot of other
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:06.040]  things and Trump has brought up 9-11 and Trump has brought up the CIA and they
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:10.000]  backed off real quick when he did that so Trump is playing a sophisticated game
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.480]  here and I'm not inside his mind but I know he is expanding US influence US
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:22.200]  power in a good way with North Korea you name it Francis Boyle may disagree but
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:27.720]  I'm not here trying to win a popularity contest people keep saying man you're
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.000]  getting really attacked how are you handling it this is exactly where I
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:39.800]  want to be now instead of losing 70 plus affiliates we've gained over a hundred
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.780]  radio affiliates the last year and a half and we've gained now over a hundred
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:47.280]  TV affiliates that's why they're really coming after us we're on 24 hours a day
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:51.960]  on channel 9 photoscope in Houston we should be on four hours a day we're on
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:56.680]  broadcast TV there's so many affiliates are coming online I can't even keep track
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.720]  of it now it's very exciting so check your local listings because they tend to
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:03.720]  harass and yell at our affiliates none of it does anything but we've a lot of
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.600]  our affiliates like yeah don't even make a big issue when personal radar we're
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:11.360]  gonna plug you're on it's great we got a great response it's happening so America
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.680]  is awake they're ready to move the country's in a fight right now over who
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.040]  is going to control it yeah I just got the no-bull radio network with two
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.000]  stations in San Antonio you name it stations Houston I mean and that's just
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.480]  Texas they've always fought to keep me off the air in Texas is the globalist
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.480]  thought that that I'd really take off here well it's happening I mean I'm
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.280]  bit up to like 10 affiliates before in Texas but a lot of them are small now a
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.800]  lot of them are giant so all I'm saying is no army can stop an idea whose time
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:42.640]  has come to quote Victor Hugo and this is a very sophisticated time we're in
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.880]  right now and so we have different guests on like Francis Boyle it's not
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.440]  because we're cult speaking off one sheet of music we're getting different
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:54.960]  ideas of people I respect and who I know are good men but they may be divergent
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:01.840]  from the other views now let's go ahead and go to mr. Boyle and then we will go
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:07.800]  to Trump also when that speech on the omnibus package bill comes up you kind
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:14.600]  of heard my intro here just getting into you know where is Trump is Trump good
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.480]  is Trump bad I'm happy because he's a nationalist returning power from the
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.440]  globalist and their anger makes me happy but it doesn't mean a nationalist could
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:25.800]  end up hurting us as well what is your view on Trump right now I know you don't
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:33.960]  like Bolton well Alex thank you very much for having me on and my best to
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:39.160]  your viewing audience I want to make it clear I'm a political independent I
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:45.480]  always have been I did not vote for mr. Trump and I certainly didn't vote for
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:53.760]  mrs. Clinton I think we'd be at war today against Russia if mrs. Clinton had
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:12:01.040]  been elected so my personal opinion is that we dodged a bullet on November 8
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:10.920]  2016 but I am concerned about Bolton I don't hate Bolton to correct you but
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:18.520]  he's extremely dangerous he is a diehard Neil conservative I should say you hate
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:21.680]  his views and you're best-selling author you've gone to the top universities
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:25.040]  Harvard you know the globalist you know Kissinger I mean I'm not gonna go over
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.840]  your whole background but you you've been right there in the middle of it right
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:34.680]  and let's just compare Bolton to Kissinger I went through that same PhD
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:39.160]  program at Harvard that produced Kissinger and they gave me Kissinger's
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:44.480]  old office there at the Center for International Affairs now we know for a
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:52.080]  fact that Kissinger has been advising President Trump and McMaster who was
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:58.320]  just fired and Jared Kushner and Kissinger is a real
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:05.560]  politiker technically would qualify and Kissinger for example recently spoke
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:12.920]  very positively in public about President Trump's initiative to negotiate
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:18.880]  with Kim Jong-un and I support that I support a peace process there with
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:22.200]  North Korea after all it's Kissinger and all them that did the whole deal with
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:27.960]  China as well in real politics just means a political pragmatic that is
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:35.480]  correct highly pragmatic and I support negotiations even a Secretary of Defense
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:41.440]  Mattis you know a four-star Marine Corps General I said a war over there would
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:48.800]  be a catastrophe but Bolton for example as I said is just a diehard
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:59.120]  neoconservative he was on the original PNAC report that was basically the mine
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:07.320]  comp for the neoconservatives that as you correctly pointed out led to the war
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:13.520]  against Iraq that was a total catastrophe and those of us dealing with
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:18.960]  Middle East knew it would be a total catastrophe indeed Trump when he was
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:25.320]  running for the presidency said it was a catastrophe and and he was right but
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:34.880]  let's just take North Korea now Bolton just recently had an article in the
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:41.720]  Wall Street Journal by Murdoch yeah saying he thinks a first strike is
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:48.520]  legitimate that's right and and that we should do it and as a matter of fact he
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:54.880]  is also publicly stated that President Trump should go to these
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:02.440]  negotiations and give Kim Jong-un an ultimatum either you agree to do
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:10.840]  denuclearize now or we're gonna attack you so it it's somewhat in Congress now
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:18.760]  as I see it for President Trump to be going forward into these negotiations
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.960]  which which I believe he should do I believe he should do it in good faith
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:29.360]  you'll note that Kim Jong-un starting with the new year it has basically
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:33.440]  capitulated to most of our demands well I know you're one of the top guys that's
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:37.680]  also helped write up the international law and American foreign policy on
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.120]  chemical weapons you name it so you can uniquely speak to take time and this
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.600]  this this meeting coming up the next few months so we come back tell us when you
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:49.000]  look at these signs the average person doesn't see what's going on because we

[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.640]  francis boil is at the University of Illinois when I brought him on I
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.240]  probably should have introduced him but I've been having him on for 15 16 years
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:38.400]  and he's worked with all the globalists you know he's been at the highest levels
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.480]  the u.s. government with the UN he has responsible for drafting the biological
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:46.280]  weapons anti-terrorism act of 89 it just goes on from there I'm not gonna get
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:49.080]  into the fact you he's a lawyer international law he's represented
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:54.360]  world leaders at the Hague you name it slow them a lot of it too it just goes
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:59.600]  on from there he exposed the genocide in Sri Lanka so he's been around the
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:03.960]  block about a hundred times and so I want to get his pragmatic real
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:10.480]  politic view on what Trump really is what the word is and where this is
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:14.960]  going but first let's finish up on North Korea no more missile tests no more
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:19.240]  threatening to hit warm looks like the maximum pressure had an effect come to
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:22.840]  the table the word is he pretty much already agreed before the meeting to a
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:26.360]  framework and I know you know a lot of these folks you confirm or deny that
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:29.680]  but I heard that from high-level sources and now that's being admitted the
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:33.560]  question is will Kim Jong-un try to back out of it they're talking about a 10
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:38.480]  year unification plan might come out of this we're talking about tens of
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:42.400]  billions we'd have to give the North Korea for modernization what will
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:46.480]  taxpayers think about that well it's cheaper than a nuclearized Peninsula
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:50.680]  if Trump can do this they're gonna say he can be one of the greatest presidents
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:55.080]  when it comes to Daytona of all time so the seven eight minutes we have let's
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:22:01.800]  tackle that dr. Boyle yes Alex I was moderately encouraged certainly all
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:10.760]  along now until Bolton and Pompeo as Secretary State are in there and to you
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:22.200]  know we have two hard liners and Pompeo has called for a tack on North Korea so
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:33.400]  who in the White House today has the stature to give President Trump realistic
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:39.560]  advice along the lines of Kissinger who was giving advice to McMaster I take it
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:46.960]  he still advises President Trump when Trump wants it who is in there right
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:54.080]  now it looks like Secretary Defense matters but if you're reading the
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:23:01.240]  newspapers today he might be forced out too so I'm not sure exactly who's no
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:06.600]  giving this type of advice to to President Trump that that he needs to go
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:14.720]  forward he to negotiate in good faith not to issue an ultimatum and all the
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:20.640]  signs coming out of North Korea I think are are extremely positive having
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:26.600]  followed this dispute for quite some time well and I also agree with you on on
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:34.080]  Russia the warmongering and propaganda against Russia are certainly the worst
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:44.480]  in my lifetime and as I told you I went through the same PhD program at Harvard
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:54.000]  that produce Brzezinski before me Mr. Globalist and he stacked the Obama
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:02.600]  administration with all his protege and they're all in the mainstream news
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:09.120]  media bongering for war against Russia isn't this historically the first time
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:15.160]  that we've had both parties frothingly anti Russia I mean is that why it's so
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:19.820]  bad that that the triumphs of the globalist in Brzezinski was getting the
[01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:27.640]  Democratic Party to become just rabidly anti Russia well what you're saying is
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:32.800]  correct Alex but it's a bit more complicated than that in that now I
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:39.880]  spent 10 years studying Russian history and Soviet politics at the University
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:46.920]  Chicago and Harvard and was qualified to teach both subjects to undergraduates
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:55.080]  at Harvard I passed my PhD oral general exam here a Russian expert but but the
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:00.840]  bottom line is in 10 years of studying this I only had two professors who my
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:05.520]  and Harvard in Chicago who I thought were fair reasonable and balanced when
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:09.680]  it came to the Russians in the Soviet Union it turns out Alex that what
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:16.800]  happened is after World War two the Department of Defense and the Central
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:25.880]  Intelligence Agency set up all these Soviet Russian research centers that for
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:35.160]  the purpose of qualifying professors like me and experts with AMs and PhDs in
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:42.000]  these areas to be used as part of the Cold War against the Soviet Union and
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:51.440]  that had that was a generation ago and that then filters down to media pundits
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:58.560]  and TV station where do you see this where do you see this going I'm sorry
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:04.840]  repeat that please I'm saying where do you see all this going now then well so
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:14.840]  far Trump has resisted the war mongering against Russia and the demonization
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:19.320]  of President Putin which you know I think is the correct thing to do these
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:25.640]  these comparisons of Putin to Hitler like Mrs. Clinton and all the
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:33.160]  Democrats and the Democratic-oriented news media it is just war mongering
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:38.680]  propaganda that is extremely well you Russia's not invading any countries
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:41.720]  it's Hillary that invaded a bunch of countries and said I came I saw he died
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:46.600]  last person I heard that was invading Libya was Hitler so if anybody's like
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:52.160]  Hitler it's Hillary well I I think she's pretty close to it yeah which is
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.360]  which is why I but I mean she invaded the same country she invaded the same
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:03.600]  country Hitler did army she invaded the same country Hitler did well in any event
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:09.080]  I mean Hitler did invade North Africa well he did that's correct I'm saying
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:11.960]  he's comparing him to Hitler I mean she's the one that has the get the
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:19.580]  Hitlerian comparisons here yeah I've been quoted to say that you know Mrs.
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:26.120]  Clinton you can do the Google she's a psychopath and a war criminal right but
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:34.440]  most people don't realize that we in the United States invaded the Soviet Union
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:43.760]  twice under President Wilson north at Arkhangelsk and in the east at
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:51.560]  Vladivostok and the theory there was to strangle the Bolshevik baby in the
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:59.320]  cradle and it failed so we have invaded them they haven't invaded or attacked
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:06.240]  us and and and so the history here is just completely turned on its head we're
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:09.560]  out of time I want to have you back up on the other shows David Knight in the
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:12.440]  morning or I would try in the evening for a full hour to get more into this
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:16.960]  history it's rich riveting stupid either they finally dug up something that
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:20.040]  they think they can get Trump for and he's rolling over the neocons which I
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:23.400]  don't think's happening or he's just getting him in there to saber rattle to
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:27.000]  scare North Korea and others to say look look at the hawkish group I've got in I
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.960]  think it's one of the two I think it's the latter what do you think let's hope
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:38.320]  it's disabled ratting and that we're not gonna have war against North Korea and
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:45.480]  we're not gonna have a war against Iran which both Pompeo and Bolton yeah
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.480]  because that'd be bigger than a catastrophe that be called Armageddon
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:51.520]  Francis Wells books to be found all over the place they're excellent look them

[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:08.080]  percent of it and the globalists are these geniuses that sold us off well

[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:15.760]  report from Owen shroyer wait till you see what happened to the city council

[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:28.200]  any further every time we do this sale on the Alexa pure breeze it sells out in
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:34.440]  a week or so and we only do it a couple times a year we have to pull this by
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:40.840]  Monday because the Alexa pure breeze is a four stage filter ion filter you name
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:47.880]  it four or five years ago I bought similar systems for $900 a piece we
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:51.120]  started selling Alexa pure when it came out of years ago it was 300 then because
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:57.080]  of cost miniaturization all of it now we sell it for 200 well the special is
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:04.560]  $50 off we do the special only a few times a year $50 off 25% off $149
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:10.560]  leading competitors are 400 to $600 still this is what I've got my home what
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:14.800]  I've got in the office I don't want to get graphic but you can be in a pretty
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:21.320]  big room like this this is probably what I what is this room probably 800 square
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:29.120]  feet or more 1000 square feet probably more than that and if somebody sneezes it
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:34.240]  goes from blue to red meaning it's picking up particular you can pass gas
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:38.240]  and in two seconds 20 feet away it turns on I don't want to get gross here I'm
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:42.560]  just saying it's amazing when it turns purple it's time to clean it and that's
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:45.560]  just the first stage filter you take it off spray it off the water hose or wipe
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:54.720]  it off so $50 off I know the cost of these is like $89 $90 so we make like
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:59.920]  $25 $30 so do they this is really a great deal but people know it's a great

[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:55.480]  you understand you are the reason we're here I salute you let's go to the
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:38:00.840]  president in his ongoing remarks on the omnibus spending bill I don't know what
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:04.880]  he said yet this is just started six seven months ago I don't know whether he's
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:09.680]  shooting down the bill I think you will here it is some tremendous trade deals
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:16.880]  are being made with various countries we're negotiating very long very hard
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:25.480]  but very quickly and the deal with South Korea is according to Secretary Ross
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:31.680]  and Bob Lighthizer is very close to being finished and we're going to have a
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:38.920]  wonderful deal with a wonderful ally we're getting very close to it it was a
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:43.680]  deal that was causing a lot of problems for our country in terms of employment
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:49.040]  and in terms of lots of other things I might ask Secretary Ross to just say a
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:53.760]  few words about that and then we're going to get on to this ridiculous
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:39:04.080]  situation that took place over the last week so thank you mr. president we
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:10.320]  believe we are relatively close to a pretty comprehensive resolution with
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:17.280]  the South Korean government it would encompass if it goes through both the
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:25.080]  232s and broader trade issues and we hope by sometime next week to be able to
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:28.280]  have a real announcement
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:32.880]  getting things done boy thank you very much well I appreciate it's unbelievable
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:41.320]  the last time we negotiated something like this and as you know it's always
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:46.600]  been a problem for our country they get together and they create a series of
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:51.480]  documents that nobody's been able to read because it was it was just done now
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:55.960]  you tell me who can read that quickly takes a long time to read it for the
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:01.240]  last eight years deep defense cuts have undermined our national security how
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:05.560]  old are and they just if you look at what's taken out they've hallowed our
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:14.280]  readiness as a military unit and put America at really grave risk my highest
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:21.360]  duty is to keep America safe nothing more important the omnibus bill
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:28.560]  reverses this dangerous defense as crazy as it's been as difficult as it's been
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:34.720]  as much opposition to the military as we've had from the Democrats and it has
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:38.960]  been tremendous I try to explain to them you know the military is for
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:44.720]  Republicans and Democrats and everybody else it's for everybody but we have
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:51.480]  tremendous opposition to creating really what will be the far by far the
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:57.320]  strongest military that we've ever had we've had that from the Democrats so if
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:02.480]  we take something for the military they want something for in many cases things
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:08.760]  that are really a wasted sum of money shrimp on treadmills and it's very bad
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:13.480]  for our country teaching Kenyans how to be transgender looking to do funding for
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:19.280]  our final fight in certain areas as you know we've gotten just about a hundred
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:24.960]  percent of our land back from ISIS we have troop increases necessary to
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:29.560]  accomplish what we have to do and we have very importantly a pay increase for
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:36.120]  our troops and this will be actually the largest pay increase for our
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:40.840]  incredible people in over a decade it increases total defense spending by more
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:45.400]  than 60 billion dollars from last year and funds the addition of critically
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:51.560]  needed ships planes helicopters tanks and submarines we have submarines being
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:54.560]  built the likes of which there's nothing anywhere in the world like the
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:58.600]  submarines we build our military equipment is the best equipment in the
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:03.040]  world and billion dollars from last year and funds the addition of critically
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:08.320]  needed ships planes helicopters tanks and submarines so we have again it
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.560]  pause means being built the likes of which there's nothing anywhere in the
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:14.760]  world we were just switching from the fox news feed to the White House fee because
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:19.280]  there's this better and again he's signaling that it's a bad bill with a
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:22.320]  bunch of pork so he's going to shoot it down calling it crap but he's also
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:25.440]  signaling you might sign it this because it's got so much good stuff in it
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:30.400]  which I don't like that too much and Rand Paul doesn't we're about to find out

[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:34.400]  well I was going with what the president had said he thought he would do
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:38.320]  earlier in tweets and he came out and said it's been a mess and you know
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:42.200]  horrible last week dealing with this ominous bill with the horrible things
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:44.960]  the democrats would demand be put in here if we were going to get military
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:49.280]  funding or border security or any of it so trump vows to sign 1.3 trillion
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:54.680]  dollar spending bill averting a government shutdown just hours after he
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:48:00.000]  tweeted out that he was probably going to veto it was looking at vetoing it
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.240]  because the spending was so out of control but then I guess he understands
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:11.680]  that the economy is in so much trouble that he thinks they'd use a shutdown to
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:16.600]  derail things I tell you it's hard to make a decision on this who's right or
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:20.400]  who's wrong we're just in a mess I am considering a veto of the omnibus
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:25.080]  spending bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:29.040]  been totally abandoned by the democrats not even mention of the bill and a
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:36.400]  border wall which is desperately needed for our defense so he's trying to
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:39.880]  legalize 800,000 DACA people that he said in the campaign that they could prove
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:43.120]  they were said had been here and weren't criminals he would be saying the
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:47.680]  democrats have abandoned them so that's a political shot back at him this is
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:50.760]  just crazy let's hear a few more minutes of Trump but we know what happened in
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:53.600]  the press conference and trotting out mad at some time on our strong
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:57.760]  military and our border and why he did the bill and trying to explain to us why
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:02.600]  he went along with it he did the good thing on tariffs yesterday against
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:06.160]  China he's done so many other good things but I don't know this is kind of a
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:10.000]  wash right now open the phones up the next hour get your take on it but here's
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.720]  more of the president our military equipment is the best equipment in the
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:19.760]  world and one of the things you saw two days ago with Saudi Arabia and with
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:24.160]  other countries Saudi Arabia as an example is buying hundreds of billions of
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:29.320]  dollars worth of our equipment and we're getting very fast approvals on that
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:33.880]  therefore as a matter of national security I've signed this omnibus
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:42.200]  budget bill there are a lot of things that I'm unhappy about in this bill there
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:46.960]  are a lot of things that we shouldn't have had in this bill but we were in a
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:51.600]  sense forced if we want to build our military we were forced to have there
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:56.280]  are some things that we should have in the bill but I say to Congress I will
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:50:02.160]  never sign another bill like this again I'm not going to do it again nobody
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:08.520]  read it it's only hours old some people don't even know what is it one point
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:13.920]  three trillion dollars it's the second largest ever President Obama signed one
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:20.120]  that was actually larger which I'm sure he wasn't too happy with either but in
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:24.680]  this case it became so big because we need to take care of our military and
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:32.080]  because the Democrats who don't believe in that added things that they wanted in
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:38.560]  order to get their votes we have to get rid of the filibuster rule we have to
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:46.040]  get rid of the filibuster rule and go to 51 votes in the Senate if we're going to
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:52.320]  have really sustained continued success DACA recipients have been treated
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:58.800]  extremely badly by the Democrats we wanted to include DACA we wanted to
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:06.160]  have them in this bill 800,000 people and actually it could even be more and we
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:13.320]  wanted to include DACA in this bill the Democrats would not do it they would not
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:20.760]  do it to prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again I'm calling
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:27.720]  on Congress to give me a line item veto for all government spending bills and
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:35.120]  the Senate must end they must end the filibuster rule and get down to work we
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:40.520]  have to get a lot of great legislation approved and without the filibuster rule
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:45.720]  it'll happen just like magic all right there you go and the president is right
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:48.760]  he then went and signed it this is just minutes ago or a few minutes behind here
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:54.640]  is the brakes and I see what he's doing is pragmatic he's saying fix it because
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:58.960]  I have no way I'm not a dictator now if I have a line item veto like many
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:02.360]  governors have like Rick Perry had in Texas you can go through and kill the
[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:06.680]  pork and I think that's something the president really should have so we're
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:09.280]  going to be looking more at that we'll be opening the phones up the toll free
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:12.400]  number to join us in the next hour is eight seven seven seven eight nine

[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:18.400]  in front of the Austin City Council yesterday about it and it was
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:21.360]  powerful here it is
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:27.920]  Owen Troyer here for info wars.com now I am at City Council today to discuss an
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:32.400]  incident that happened on December 10th 2017 where I was trying to go to a
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:37.560]  memorial march for Kate Steinlein but I was met with armed masked men that
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:42.280]  prevented me from entering and were intimidating and threatening me I'm
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:45.600]  gonna bring this issue to City Council let's see how they take it all right
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:48.640]  well I'm gonna start by asking the council a question given everything
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:51.600]  that's happened in the month of March with the bombings and the police officer
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:55.160]  saying if you see anything suspicious say something I think we would all agree
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:54:01.000]  that masked men walking around with firearms is something suspicious now
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:06.920]  I'm gonna play this video for the council to review that illustrates that
[01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:11.080]  exact thing happening now I am a firm believer in the first amendment right so
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:15.160]  an individual has the right to walk around with their face covered I'm a
[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:18.280]  firm believer in the second amendment right I believe in constitutional carry
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:22.600]  so you can carry a rifle or whatever firearm you want with you however
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:29.000]  according to us code title 18 part 1 chapter 13 subsection 241 conspiracy
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.960]  against right states if two or more persons conspire to injure oppress
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:36.560]  threaten or intimidate any person in any state territory commonwealth or
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:40.600]  district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:44.200]  by him by the Constitution or laws of the United States or because of his
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:50.280]  having so exercise them the same or two or more persons go in disguise or on the
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:54.280]  premises of another with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:58.000]  enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured they shall be fined under this
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:03.160]  title or in prison not more than 10 years well on December 10th the video
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:08.200]  you're witnessing right now I went to a memorial march for a deceased victim of
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:14.880]  a violent crime and I was met as you can see in these pictures by masked men with
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:20.520]  arms on their triggers of rifles battering clubs etc here you can see
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:25.440]  this man has his finger on the trigger keeping me from going to a park a
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:30.680]  memorial here's them with shields and clubs blocking me entrance from a park
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:36.800]  for a dead person's memorial now if that doesn't violate the code I don't know
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:41.880]  what does and I find it timely that we sit here today with you all discussing
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:45.360]  getting more funding for police but I did not hear one person make a
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:50.480]  suggestion to keep violent criminals off the streets well maybe if we looked into
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:55.800]  sanctuary city laws and keeping masked men with guns off the streets we wouldn't
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:59.280]  have to have a hundred police officers out there every time somebody wants to
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:04.680]  have a march which is every weekend now I'll just say this in closing and
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:12.520]  provide an illustration for you radio listeners he puts on a anti for
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:17.480]  disguise in the city council this is how you do it this is this is truth on
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:22.800]  parade if I was outside holding a rifle keeping people from getting into this
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:27.320]  city council to state their claim do you think I should be arrested I think
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:32.640]  everybody here would agree yes that should be an arrest absolutely but for
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.600]  some reason and I'm not blaming the APD because I think they're good men and
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:40.800]  women most my experiences with them have been positive but if we're not going to
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:45.280]  arrest armed individuals with masks brandishing weapons intimidating people
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:50.480]  from their free speech a clear violation of the law I just want to know why and I
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:53.760]  want to know if this city council thinks that that's the type of city that we
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:59.120]  should live in thank you for your time thank you mayor miss you if he would
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:03.480]  provide us with the link because I couldn't see that absolutely I'd be
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:08.960]  happy to thank you so there you have it folks now there's many marches coming up
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:12.800]  in Austin Texas including one this Saturday now I'm not sure you're gonna
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:16.960]  see armed men with masks show up at this one but there's other marches and
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:20.600]  protests planned in the future and this is not gonna stop and we're always there
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:24.520]  to report it for you so let's see if there's any difference in the way
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:29.480]  police officers approach armed masked men on the streets during a protest or if
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:33.960]  the same thing is allowed to continue without any arrest because I theorize if
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:38.920]  you arrest one of these antifa guys or masked men in the streets with weapons
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:43.560]  intimidating and threatening people they all go away as soon as one goes to jail
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:48.480]  but we'll wait you see what the response is from a great job stay with us the

[02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:41.480]  profanity lace piece by the high school senior who's a public figure who calls

[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:53.360]  fraud and then says he wants to debate me and then says he's scared to and then
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:57.840]  goes on TV and says we're we're scared to debate him and that we and we can
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:05.240]  dish it out but we can't take it and he's just bullying me in that he can
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:10.840]  attack and then CNN can go and say Alex Jones said David Hogg is a crisis actor
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:14.920]  and nobody died and I didn't say that and then CNN tries to get my YouTube
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:22.680]  channel taken down and it becomes a national scandal a national scandal and
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:28.480]  they put our YouTube back up and then CNN denies that it they ever did it
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:31.920]  that's how dumb they think you are they don't think you remember day-to-day what
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:36.920]  they do and now hog is running around in these profanity lace ranch against gun
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:46.040]  owners in the NRA and he then talks about me and says I'm a liar and all
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:56.440]  these things on c-span today and what do you think's gonna happen you you know
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:59.400]  the southern property law center trolls 10,000 of them that have taken over

[02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:20.280]  that you know what Piglet's all over the news saying I'm a liar Piglet's
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:26.000]  challenging me to debates and it's hogwash he's in a man's world he's a
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:34.560]  public figure NPR says I'm being sued for saying no one died in Parkland I have
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:38.560]  the articles right here none of that's even true I didn't say nobody died I
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:45.520]  didn't say they were crisis actors lies on lies on lies on lies and now he's
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:49.800]  gone after me for gay frogs so we put together the joke piece will Eric come
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:59.000]  up the bottom of the hour where I show hog blurred out at first he's on c-span
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.200]  he's on national TV he's a public figure but we're gonna be politically
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:08.360]  correct we're gonna show his name and his face blurred out because he's a child
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:14.280]  and did you hear all over the news it's their branding Jones bullied children
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:20.760]  Jones said victims weren't shot lies on lies on lies while he's up there in
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:29.920]  profanity laced tirades on television that we're gonna play and calling me
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:35.520]  names and lying about me on television but that's the Democratic Party using
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:40.720]  children he's really a young man as human shields they use young men as human
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:46.920]  shields call them children so it's lies on lies on lies on lies and it's the
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:50.400]  anatomy of lies but see while they think they're destroying my name while
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:55.960]  they think they're intimidating me I didn't get into this to be myself
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:59.620]  successful I got into it to break through blow a hole through the lies and
[02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:05.840]  expose it somebody's got to do it just like I lost 70 plus radio stations when
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:09.640]  I exposed the globalist working with Saudi Arabia and others to carry out 911
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:15.440]  day 1 I was there to get that story out to expose it and I did you see now we're
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:18.960]  gaining affiliates in support now because America's more awake but the point
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:22.760]  is is that I'm not here to win a popularity contest or walk on some
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:29.320]  filthy Hollywood red carpet or to be on CNN that's where all the cowards are
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:33.680]  that's where the liars are that's where the past is the renaissance the stars
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:38.560]  my children's future is based on truth and justice and integrity and not
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:44.320]  courage we have no future if we don't beat them I do this out of self survival
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:50.880]  out of self-interest it's not courage it's life force and it's will and we are

[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:28.960]  live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:35.440]  all right trump about 45 minutes ago signed the omnibus spending bill to keep
[02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:39.200]  the government open and to get military and border security funding and the
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:42.560]  rest of the Democrats held him hostage because they had the filibuster he's
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:46.200]  calling to be given a line item veto he's calling for the filibuster to be
[02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:52.240]  removed to allow the Senate like the House to pass bills with a 51% and I
[02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:58.440]  agree with that and he's not letting him hold the country hostage we're already
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:02.640]  so down the rat hole in debt it's more important to cut regulations cut taxes
[02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:06.920]  and to engage in trade war with China and everybody else because we've been
[02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:12.960]  under a trade war for 50 years to deindustrialize us so the Democrats are
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:17.600]  playing games to sabotage the economy Trump is full steam ahead I don't like
[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:21.720]  deficit spending but we're already deep into this now ladies and gentlemen we've
[02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:25.400]  got to reignite our economy bring industry back and optimism back cut off
[02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:29.880]  the communist Chinese deal the radical jihadis and Trump is shutting down all
[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:34.880]  the leftist funding the communist Chinese the Saudi Arabians have rolled over
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:41.480]  everybody's rolling over but the EU the Pope and Hollywood Trump is cutting them
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:45.760]  off and China is still standing but they are they are having thousands of
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:49.280]  riots a month they enslaved their people they're force moving more farmers
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:52.400]  off their land millions are being executed every few years they're
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:56.520]  selling political dissidents organs and our media propping them up and not
[02:07:56.520 --> 02:08:00.280]  calling them dictators and all this is incredible but Trump good cops it and
[02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:03.440]  bad cops it okay you want to work it out with you it's great but you've been
[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:07.800]  ripping us off boom this is happening and it's a fact China has giant internal
[02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:11.800]  tariffs against us it's a fact they dump all this garbage on our market it's a
[02:08:11.800 --> 02:08:15.920]  fact these other countries do it in coalition all right I'm gonna go to your
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:21.640]  calls bottom of the hour David Hogg the poster child out of 3000 students at
[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:25.720]  Parkland where the mass shooting happened where there were not crisis
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:28.880]  actors we never said that that's a huge media line we said they picked four
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:32.600]  students out of 3000 who are all in the drama club and all anti-gun and all
[02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:37.080]  interning and want to work with CNN with Democrat parents they pick them as the
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:41.440]  PR people to go out with anti-gun classic talking points and that's a
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:44.680]  fact that it's come out the CNN's banning conservative students and giving
[02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:47.360]  people stage questions and all that so what are they gonna do when they're
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:51.840]  getting caught doing that misrepresent what we said the straw man Hogg has now
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:57.280]  blown up in a vicious tyrant cussing and yelling at gun owners frothing
[02:08:57.280 --> 02:09:02.280]  attacking me you name it it's all coming up at the bottom of the hour and then

[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:16.880]  Cameron Mike Mark J Greg you name it there is so much to break down you know
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:21.040]  I'm glad that Laurel wants to talk about the shooting of Seth Rich investigator
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:25.480]  yeah the lawyer the lobbyist investigating that and Hillary's
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:29.680]  Russia gate was going to a drop box this is a week and a half ago nobody
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:32.600]  covered it but it's finally in the Washington Post got shot twice in the
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:36.800]  back and run over but lived with his dog by a Marine with a Department of
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:44.240]  Energy at a drop off he believed in a parking garage under a cone getting
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:49.080]  documents on Hillary and Russia that's not suspicious I'm glad Laurel thinks
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:56.160]  it's a big deal you're on the air Laurel good afternoon Alex I'm so glad to be
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:01.520]  talking to you thank you me too I I use multiple of your products we have
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:05.880]  most t-shirts we have the super blue toothpaste the selenium to be 12 the
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:10.080]  iodine the winter sun and I ordered the micro zx thank you because without you
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:13.480]  finding this operation it cost a lot the globalists are gonna win plus they're
[02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:18.400]  great products how do you like them oh we love them my husband and I both take
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:23.480]  do all of this and I can tell if I haven't taken my B12 iodine and and
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:28.040]  vitamin D in the morning I just I have a hard time functioning I tell you the
[02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:31.560]  iodine particularly this particular type is really amazing what's your view on
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:36.680]  the investigator getting shot twice in the back in DC I think this is just the
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:41.440]  tip of the iceberg for those who are associated with Hillary I think we're
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:47.480]  gonna see people dropping like flies I think that if anybody is associated with
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:52.800]  Hillary they need to have security on them because this is just the beginning
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:57.520]  of them trying to cover things up I'm really concerned about that well that's
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:01.520]  another issue for us is that we have now armed security we're also a lot of us
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:07.520]  have a concealed carry and it was because of Hillary being defeated and the
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:10.560]  stuff that started happening I'm not going to get into on air but it's
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:14.560]  directly from them and I've been told you better stop it well I mean I can't
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:18.640]  just roll over we got here from rolling over so that's a whole nother cost we
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:22.840]  have you know we're talking quite a bit of money every week for 24 hour a day
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:29.400]  armed security and it's it's it you know it's just a serious situation that's
[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:33.040]  where this country is that's what's going on and the Democrats are also on the
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:36.760]  news trying to wind up their listeners and constituents two congressmen no three
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:40.920]  two called for attacking in the president shooting him this week using
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:45.080]  guns on him another one called for his overthrow so three in one week I mean
[02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:51.320]  they're they're trying to activate their constituents I agree totally and they're
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:58.040]  they're they're just trying to make it so that we all believe that Hillary did
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:03.080]  nothing wrong and she's not sick so that they can somehow squeak her into some
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:07.880]  other position so that she can try to worm her way back up to the top again or
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:12.000]  somebody that she has mentored herself yes and that's because she worked for the
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.960]  globalist and David Rockefeller and others and got all the computer programs
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:19.040]  and the Nexus programs to have all the dirt and everything with that
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:23.520]  foundation that's why she's so powerful is that she's got the blackmail the dirt
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:28.760]  imagine the stolen hundreds of billions I mean yes she is her and Bill
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:33.000]  Clinton are just incredible criminals God bless you Laurel thank you so much

[02:22:20.920 --> 02:22:27.000]  unbelievable and it was a new peak but then we had a new plateau and we and
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:30.760]  we've expanded many other areas but here's what happened in 2017 we still
[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:35.280]  got even bigger but look they cut our reach off and don't let us reach all
[02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:38.200]  the people the millions tens of millions that follow us on our different
[02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:42.040]  platforms on Facebook but it doesn't matter we already got them in full wars
[02:22:42.040 --> 02:22:48.760]  and news wars and it's done so now Facebook with the Democrats goes and
[02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:54.960]  reports on the analytical group and then everybody goes wait a minute but
[02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:58.120]  Facebook does that a billion times literally what this little company did
[02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:02.440]  because I'm showing you our reaches nine you know nine million they're saying
[02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:12.400]  ooh bannons was 50 million ooh ooh ooh I mean this is ridiculous so that's the
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:19.960]  reality of what's going on and yeah they put the brakes on us on those platforms
[02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:23.160]  but we always knew that was coming we knew their plan so now Facebook is
[02:23:23.160 --> 02:23:27.560]  imploding falling apart 60 something billion lost just absolutely being
[02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:32.720]  shredded becoming my space because you the left wanted to keep the right wing
[02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:37.000]  from being able to data mine it when they own it and run it the left so they
[02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:41.880]  just blew up their own golden goose because somebody snuck in once and got
[02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:45.200]  a little fleck off a golden egg you Democrats have and ran off a little
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:48.920]  fleck of it in the dark and you're so mad that Bannon went and got some names
[02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:52.720]  off Facebook that you you went in and threw a battle axe at your goose and
[02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:58.960]  sliced its head off you people are amazingly stupid you never think more
[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:04.640]  than one or two steps down you're stupid like cancer yeah you're able to take
[02:24:04.640 --> 02:24:07.200]  over and then everything goes to hell every time
[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:12.160]  authoritarians take over why because you suck because you're stupid because all
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:18.880]  you do is rob what other people build morons we're dealing with control freak
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:22.800]  parasites of every race color and creed who historically get together and take
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:26.000]  over and convince good people to give them the power and by successful
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:31.000]  approximation they dominate then they end up ruining everybody's lives fact
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:38.400]  fact then the left creates crony capitalism screws over real free market
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:43.280]  then goes over solutions communism and socialism that works even worse than
[02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:49.240]  crony capitalism as if we weren't capitalists anymore because we became
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:56.560]  globalist and all the games they play Bernie sands is
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:25:03.960]  me like Venezuela I said I go to your calls I apologize I mean better we
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:07.800]  should I go to first mark the fight for independent media you're on the air

[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:18.400]  you sir I just want to say you guys are being attacked left right and center by
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:22.760]  everybody and have you ever thought of starting an association with all the
[02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:27.240]  independent media like in four wars or drudge and so on so you can become a
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:32.000]  stronger stronger entity and and maybe people would think twice before
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:36.360]  attacking you and you can also be a great lobby group towards the government
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:39.320]  have you ever thought of creating such an association well I mean I want to
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:42.600]  create like a foundation that's the human preservation defense league that
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:46.880]  that's anti-ai taking over free will I wanted that for 20 years now's the time

[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:54.440]  looking and we've got to follow lawsuits against such these people to teach the
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:58.280]  minions that shine on to this that they're going to be sued they're going
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:01.720]  to lose I mean we can win these it'll just take a lot of money to then
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:05.240]  countersue them but we'll get the money back and I don't want to do that it's
[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:10.920]  against my nature but I have to but but but yes they're attacking us because
[02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:14.680]  we've got their blueprint they're attacking us because we did have 87 or
[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:20.640]  86 million actual listeners and viewers on on election week that's when they
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:24.720]  went from being arrogant to actually looking and going oh my god info wars

[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:49.200]  and get their kids out they're not even good swimmers but they're able to do it
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:54.160]  in the dark it's like it's not courage we're gonna die if we don't get through

[02:31:58.120 --> 02:32:04.200]  it's micro zx plus lower price more ingredients because we scaled up signed
[02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:08.720]  to your contract with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer
[02:32:08.720 --> 02:32:15.400]  scalability but now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39 50% off
[02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:19.480]  because there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient micro zx now it's the
[02:32:19.480 --> 02:32:22.360]  other side of the equation everybody thinks about probiotics and how great
[02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:26.240]  they are for your gut because of toxins the environment pesticides herbicides
[02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:31.040]  but more importantly than bad bacteria the probiotics help displace yeast mold
[02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:37.100]  create slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that
[02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:39.840]  get in there it causes all sorts of serious issues well this has got a
[02:32:39.840 --> 02:32:44.840]  bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime

[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:52.880]  coming up here but first earlier I mentioned David Hogg who the mainstream
[02:33:52.880 --> 02:34:02.000]  media has continually misrepresented the facts about they've continued in three
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:08.240]  mpr pieces this week on CNN this week again on MSNBC so many clips they get
[02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:12.280]  sent to me I can't even look at them all I asked some of the crews to me
[02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:17.840]  transcripts saying that I said no one died and I said they were actors and I
[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:22.520]  said he was from California and 24 years old I didn't say that my crew didn't
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:29.680]  say that no one said that then CNN who he works with who he wants to work for
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:33.880]  who he's visited before the shooting ever happened lobbies to have info wars
[02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:40.120]  shut down lobbies to have us taken off YouTube a competing media organization
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:48.960]  that that's interference that's that's super uncivil in the courts when big
[02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:52.760]  organizations get involved it can even be criminal they try to get our channel
[02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:56.160]  shut down they get it shut down for a while we have the videos we show the
[02:34:56.160 --> 02:35:03.120]  world what it was it wasn't what they said YouTube then is forced to put it
[02:35:03.120 --> 02:35:09.200]  back up then they go after our sponsors and they're still all over the news three
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:15.720]  four weeks later lying about what I said and about what I did and now David Hogg
[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:22.040]  God bless him comes out and attacks me calls me a piece of crap does all this
[02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:25.880]  other stuff calls me a con man says he wants to debate me then he's scared to
[02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:30.280]  debate they go on NBC and say folks are scared to debate him obviously talking
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:35.720]  about us it's wild and so a lot of deception a lot of things are being
[02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:39.800]  said clearly that aren't true and he's a public figure he's in a man's world
[02:35:39.800 --> 02:35:46.160]  he's a senior in high school he wants lost past well now his cohorts of the
[02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:50.720]  four kids young people chosen to be in the media out of 3,000 have called
[02:35:50.720 --> 02:36:01.160]  people murderers Dana Loche burn her all this has gone on and it goes on and on
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:05.360]  and on and on and on and on and people like did you hear it on NPR do you see
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:09.840]  it on local TV they say you're being sued by David Hogg because nobody died
[02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:15.160]  David Hogg tweets I've been sued for saying nobody died none of that's true I
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:20.760]  mean it is wild what comes out of this guy's mouth and whoever's telling him
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:23.800]  to say this stuff or or is it coming out of his own mouth that's even worse I
[02:36:23.800 --> 02:36:31.240]  don't know so we're gonna play a clip of him with it bleeped out
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:37.000]  profanity laced interview and then him on c-span this morning attacking yours
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:40.600]  truly here's the first clip
[02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:44.920]  killing our children they have blood from children spatter all over their faces
[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:48.600]  and they wouldn't take action because they'll still see those dollar signs are
[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:56.200]  you exhausted and beyond exhausted is it energizing this exhaustion is it an
[02:36:56.200 --> 02:37:01.400]  energizing it's just as energizing as it is exhausting at this point I get to a
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:05.280]  certain point where what I get so tired that I just keep going it creates a
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:10.240]  positive feedback loop in some ways where the more stress and work that I've
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:14.080]  put on me and more work and stress that I can deal with but at this point it's
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:17.640]  like when you're when you're an old-ass parents like I don't know how to send an
[02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:21.040]  i-message you just have to be the phone and you take him you're like okay let me
[02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:24.160]  handle it and you get it done in one second sadly that's what we have to do
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:27.640]  with our government because our parents don't know how to use a democracy so we
[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:31.000]  have to they think what's the pros are out there that want to continue to sell
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:34.840]  more guns murder more children and honestly just get reelected where what
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:38.880]  type of person are you when you want to see more money than children's lives how
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:43.480]  what type of person does that and like there's this whole I mean the way that
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:46.440]  they're talking about it now the way Rick Scott has been talking about it is
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:52.360]  like when the shooter arrives we need a metal detector and it's hard with Rick
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:57.640]  Scott it's like when I get elected to Senate we're not gonna happen he's like
[02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:02.400]  oh I'm gonna implement all these amazing things let me make sure I do it right
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:06.800]  before my election for Senate when I try calling out Bill Nelson I just he's
[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:12.920]  turning this political so do you see you see that as opportunistic about these
[02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:16.800]  kids lives at all he only cares about his reelection that's why this stuff is
[02:38:16.800 --> 02:38:21.000]  being implemented in a year not today what is striking to me about this is
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:26.360]  that you guys seem to be have such a mastery of the internet in a way that I
[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:31.200]  feel like I mean literally I can't watch any more of it get it off get it off get
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:36.840]  it off there's just hours of it they take the guns from everybody in Mexico
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:38.840]  and they have that one of the highest crime rates in the world same thing
[02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:43.000]  Brazil Hitler took the guns Stalin took the guns Mal took the guns you know
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:46.240]  political power goes out of the barrel the gun and then another crazy person
[02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:49.440]  everybody knew was gonna attack goes and kills some people and then I'm the
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:52.280]  blame and all gun owners are a blame well somebody runs over somebody with a
[02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:56.000]  car are they all the blame or somebody with a baseball bat this is common sense
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:02.680]  and you've got a young high school senior teenager cussing to get attention to
[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:07.800]  polo stunt but none of us are supposed to talk about it because if you respond
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:10.920]  to him when he's calling you a piece of this or a piece of that other or his
[02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:14.040]  cohorts are you know calling Dana Lohscher murder and people are chanting
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:19.000]  burn her well then you're a bully that's what CNN wants is to use this to kill
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:22.160]  the First Amendment not just the Second Amendment you got YouTube banning all
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:27.440]  guns with citizens having guns or showing guns but Hollywood and the video
[02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:30.640]  game makers and all them they can show all the guns they want this is an
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:36.560]  incredibly discriminatory system so let's go ahead and go to David Hogg on
[02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:41.480]  C-Span 2 with the editor of Axios that's because Politico knows they're
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:44.000]  discredited now so they've changed the name to Axios to make a song they're
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:47.440]  independent and he's interviewing him asking a question and then he gets into
[02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:53.840]  the gay frogs here it is you're 17 you'll be 18 next month you online were
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:58.720]  the victim of a conspiracy video attacked by this sort of info wars crowd
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:03.640]  what was that like it was wonderful it was great advertising
[02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:11.600]  getting saying Alex joke sorry I want to mention his name when individuals say
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:14.240]  these things to us I think it's important for their viewing audience to
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:17.000]  realize they're simply trying to make money off them for example one of the
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:20.280]  main people in this situation that I don't want to name the name of but as you
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:24.440]  said it's from info wars he shots a lot I'll just give you that and he looks
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:30.440]  red he's advertising many of these things and the power lies in these
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:34.040]  advertisers to pull out of these fear mongering hate loving people that just
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:38.760]  want to spread hate and division in America for example on info wars one of
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:42.680]  the main things that he spoke one of his famous things is saying that one of his
[02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:46.800]  most famous statements was saying that tap water is turning the frogs gay and
[02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:50.200]  will turn you gay too first off gay people are awesome I don't think that's a
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:54.600]  problem at all and secondly if you notice at the end of that video he
[02:40:54.600 --> 02:41:01.440]  advertises water filters interesting hey the water's poison bro now we can play
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:03.680]  all the sound of it reports we're putting one together with all the
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:07.760]  scientists about the frogs becoming gays the term scientists use going after
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:13.440]  males trying to fertilize eggs that don't exist and then the species dies now
[02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:18.000]  here we did it so we're not mean to mr. Hogg is a public figure we've now
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:22.080]  turned turned this into a frog but there's Berkeley knows pesticide that
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:27.680]  resin can turn male frogs gay and that's all I ever did was read a journal a
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:31.320]  science headline that said that and they went what are we gonna do well just say
[02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:36.920]  he said it and then just misrepresent like they said on info wars like group
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:41.800]  you were the victim of a conspiracy oh notice how evil Axios is they know I
[02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:45.040]  didn't say that they know I didn't do that they know lawsuits are getting ready
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:52.920]  for this and so they went oh oh an info wars like group we're gonna come back
[02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:56.760]  and play the clip where we transferred mr. mr. hogg into a frog it's pretty
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:42:00.520]  funny and he's a public figure we mean it in jest and YouTube will probably try
[02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:03.600]  to shut us down for this and then we'll win the big antitrust lawsuit the
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:08.360]  discrimination lawsuits try they backed off the last five times because we're
[02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:13.320]  going to engage in our first amendment and you can let mr. hogg call us liars
[02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:17.280]  and names and scam artists and everything else we're just gonna sit here and

[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:10.480]  sandals commercials we have the highest rated spectrum four different companies
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:15.000]  of high-quality filters and we're saying every major tap water almost all well
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:20.960]  water has at racine it has mercury it has a roundup in it the biggest thing you
[02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:24.320]  can do is drink filtered water everybody knows that a lot of the bottle
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:28.480]  waters have been contaminated I get really Mountain Valley spring from
[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:31.840]  Arkansas has been tested it's super high-quality great minerals we enjoy that
[02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:36.000]  lavishment here at the office you know that's even a step above filtering your
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:40.400]  water and at my house I have Mountain Valley spring we also have reverse
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:44.920]  osmosis and our pro-peer and lexapure systems when I go on the road I take one
[02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:48.520]  with me and I still drink iced tea and stuff that has the bad tap water in it
[02:50:48.520 --> 02:50:53.880]  but I'm limiting it and my baby gets filtered water so yes I'm saying our
[02:50:53.880 --> 02:50:57.400]  tap waters highly contaminated can we put the Berkeley study up about making
[02:50:57.400 --> 02:51:01.320]  frogs gay place because it actually makes them want males they go and try to
[02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:04.560]  fertilize other males there it is test aside at reasoning can turn male frogs
[02:51:04.560 --> 02:51:10.720]  into females okay so there you go ladies and gentlemen and then and then we have
[02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:14.640]  the scientists saying it literally makes them gay and at regime does the same
[02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:19.880]  thing to male humans now that is a fact hogs like hey this is a great thing I'm
[02:51:19.880 --> 02:51:24.760]  not you now you're really seeing what's going on right it's a chemical takeover
[02:51:24.760 --> 02:51:27.880]  not to make it gay but to make you stare all that's a side issue the
[02:51:27.880 --> 02:51:31.280]  fertility dropping it's admitted it's happening to the deer it's happening to
[02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:34.400]  the other forest animals that drink water that's run off of this this is
[02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:39.720]  there's thousands of articles and it's totally known but they transfer that into
[02:51:39.720 --> 02:51:45.680]  I'm a fraud well Alexa pure they're great gravity-fed systems they're great
[02:51:45.680 --> 02:51:49.600]  air filtration systems pro-peer is amazing they're apples and oranges the
[02:51:49.600 --> 02:51:54.440]  filters some are better at this than that but it's all 99.9% reduction some of
[02:51:54.440 --> 02:51:56.840]  the total reduction depending on the hundreds of chemicals lead other
[02:51:56.840 --> 02:52:00.440]  studies are up there the test the globalists have gone and grabbed the
[02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:03.120]  filter companies we use and gone and looked at them and you don't want to
[02:52:03.120 --> 02:52:06.000]  publish the stuff because it shows it's exactly what we said I mean I just go
[02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:11.240]  out and find out whatever the top stuff is and I sell it info or store.com
[02:52:11.240 --> 02:52:16.200]  infowarslife.com or AAA 253 3139 yeah you should filter your air you should
[02:52:16.200 --> 02:52:19.600]  filter your water we have non-geoma heirloom seeds the biggest selection on
[02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:23.520]  line out there now it's like 16 different companies we sell springs here
[02:52:23.520 --> 02:52:31.800]  support us next we're gonna say you know having a garden in the good thing so
[02:52:31.800 --> 02:52:37.880]  there you go Jeff Bezos sells supplements but he's okay when I do
[02:52:37.880 --> 02:52:43.280]  I'm a con artist so that's how it works Jeff Bezos is the biggest something so
[02:52:43.280 --> 02:52:47.760]  in the world and the Washington Post more than 20 times I know of has articles
[02:52:47.760 --> 02:52:52.920]  that I'm a fraud and I sell snake oil when I sell at least 16 products sold in
[02:52:52.920 --> 02:52:58.040]  Whole Foods as their main product that I also sell because it turns out they
[02:52:58.040 --> 02:53:00.920]  really are the highest rated they really are the best and they really are
[02:53:00.920 --> 02:53:03.960]  affordable because back then Whole Foods used to be pretty good about
[02:53:03.960 --> 02:53:08.000]  supplements wanting you to get stuff that's actually real good so I go to the
[02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:12.440]  big companies few of them have actually been contacted now and said stop saying
[02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:15.760]  that Whole Foods is on our ass even though contractually what you're
[02:53:15.760 --> 02:53:21.400]  saying is true and you can do it stopping see they're after us folks they
[02:53:21.400 --> 02:53:28.120]  are after us they are our vitamin B12 rated the best when Buzzfeed tested
[02:53:28.120 --> 02:53:32.560]  they couldn't believe it our coil silver rated the best the toothpaste all of it
[02:53:32.560 --> 02:53:36.520]  it's the best we're gonna bring you the best what we're gonna do it's what I do
[02:53:36.520 --> 02:53:43.000]  our information has changed the world already but now suppliers are saying
[02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:46.960]  they're cutting quality now that Bezos took it over six months ago so the real
[02:53:46.960 --> 02:53:52.880]  snake oil now is Bezos yeah he's taking the California standards off taking all
[02:53:52.880 --> 02:53:59.560]  the standards off and it is bad but he's go I'm a liberal golly gee does that

[02:54:41.160 --> 02:54:45.960]  delay vaccination but not sure if we should avoid them all together or just
[02:54:45.960 --> 02:54:51.160]  get the MMR and polio just kind of get your take on it just I'll take my my
[02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:55.160]  answer off there God bless you sir I don't even my personal view when I do my
[02:54:55.160 --> 02:55:00.560]  life I have four children none of them have ever had a shot in their life they
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:03.360]  lie and say it's the law to take them to go to school there's a labor form there's
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:09.840]  not even a law I believe in an oculation I believe the science is real it works
[02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:13.680]  the companies have been given protection since the mid 80s billions have been
[02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:17.120]  paid out secretly the inserts that many can brain damage you and kill you because
[02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:21.320]  the additives and the secret testing and the globalist eugenics agenda not just
[02:55:21.320 --> 02:55:25.560]  a poison with food and water but the vaccines with all scheme heard about
[02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:29.120]  black folks getting shot up for 47 years by syphilis then it turned out was poor
[02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:34.160]  white appellations and everybody else and people in Peru and other areas and
[02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:40.760]  India they give them polio shots and it gives them a polio that's come out they
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:44.600]  admit polio gave millions polio the polio vaccine my grandmother was told
[02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:48.320]  she got her second polio an oculation and she got it a week later and the doctor
[02:55:48.320 --> 02:55:54.640]  said you got it from the live virus she died last year she's gone but she was
[02:55:54.640 --> 02:55:59.720]  alive for 60 something years with the majority of her muscles eaten thanks to
[02:55:59.720 --> 02:56:03.600]  our loving government shot so I'm telling you when you take those things you
[02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:08.600]  take your life in your hands if there was some deadly pathogen killing masses
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:12.800]  of people and I saw folks take the vaccine and not be affected and not
[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:17.120]  have serious side effects I'd take it like I did a big old piece of pumpkin pie
[02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:23.280]  on Thanksgiving afternoon if another disease came along and it was proven to
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:26.200]  be blocking it without huge side effects I need like a big old slice of
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:31.680]  cherry pie I got a pen in my leg I've had both my arms legs broken I've been
[02:56:31.680 --> 02:56:35.960]  in surgeries if there's a drug when I'm sick I can take it feel better I'll take
[02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:41.720]  it if it doesn't hurt me I believe in science we're innovators here but
[02:56:41.720 --> 02:56:47.080]  vaccines are a protected industry liability protection they've been caught
[02:56:47.080 --> 02:56:54.120]  worldwide with SV 40 alone of thousands of contaminants that they estimate gave
[02:56:54.120 --> 02:57:01.240]  Americans 98 million cases of cancer just from the 1950s to the 70s when they
[02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:05.520]  supposedly stopped putting at the polio vaccine that was contaminated with live
[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:11.200]  super virus that is a bio weapon and they believe has probably killed 300
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:17.400]  million Indians 100% of the Indian sewage system look it up is infected with
[02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:24.000]  SV 40 alone SV 40 is associated with hundreds of cancers that didn't exist
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:30.720]  until one of them has a long name but it's purple yogurt basically colored
[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:35.760]  about tumor that grows huge in just a few weeks and eats your brain and then

[03:00:56.120 --> 03:01:01.560]  education signs pound and pavement pound of that rebar out there along
[03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:06.160]  pathways and what have you got to do it now got to get out there you're okay
[03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:11.440]  absolutely no I'm your 10-4 on target the Democrats are stealing elections
[03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:15.800]  they're pulling out all the stops right now but yeah Alex let me tell you the
[03:01:15.800 --> 03:01:20.400]  importance about this from the real world here in the Southwest USA I ran
[03:01:20.400 --> 03:01:25.960]  901 calls at the EMT in Los Angeles and Las Vegas under the last four years of
[03:01:25.960 --> 03:01:31.040]  Obama administration was horrible it's a real privilege to serve the public don't
[03:01:31.040 --> 03:01:34.720]  do me wrong in this capacity but it purses the limit for the 901 system and
[03:01:34.720 --> 03:01:38.160]  no one talks about that no one talks about the added stresses on the 901
[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:43.120]  first responders and you know it's just a huge deal that going on you know going
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:47.360]  back to education really to get these guys out and force the sensible
[03:01:47.360 --> 03:01:51.320]  Democrat I love a lot of them got a lot of family members of Democrats we got a
[03:01:51.320 --> 03:01:54.200]  force and they become libertarians because of the Democrat Party is just
[03:01:54.200 --> 03:01:57.720]  going so far crazy it's just out of control I got a force and you got a
[03:01:57.720 --> 03:02:00.760]  force of truth on there to force them to acknowledge reality I mean the
[03:02:00.760 --> 03:02:04.480]  Republican Party we're the ones that you know I'm sorry if I'm just ranting on
[03:02:04.480 --> 03:02:09.000]  but you know 13 14 15 amendment you know free the slaves to you know give them
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:13.140]  the right to vote to be given to the mainstream media and the Democrats have
[03:02:13.140 --> 03:02:17.200]  created a huge hoax that it's the Republicans that are racist historically
[03:02:17.200 --> 03:02:22.440]  yes it's a total hoax I mean the 19th Amendment 1920 did women the right to
[03:02:22.440 --> 03:02:27.400]  vote everything it's all Republicans I know the Democrats are a really nasty
[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:33.240]  lot in 1860 to quote the next issue that even the Civil War no Republicans
[03:02:33.240 --> 03:02:37.200]  own slaves all slaves were owned by Democrats it's just out of control Alex
[03:02:37.200 --> 03:02:41.560]  it really I had when my grandfather ran for office in one in Texas people that
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:44.680]  knew him came up calling him an inward lover because he was pro Eisenhower and
[03:02:44.680 --> 03:02:50.600]  you know for desegregation I know I my family has been you know attacked and
[03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:54.680]  stuff for standing up for what's right and then the left calls me KKK when
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:03:00.200]  they're in the party of the KKK I'm the Spanish speaking you know
[03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:04.920]  poor generation American you know but Alex they call me racist you don't know
[03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:09.320]  the reverse racism that goes on to you know from well I'd call it bully and I
[03:03:09.320 --> 03:03:12.920]  do read about it and I do hear about it absolutely the bullying that goes on for
[03:03:12.920 --> 03:03:17.480]  you know Hispanics Latinos blacks you name it my friends and family if they
[03:03:17.480 --> 03:03:20.680]  don't tell the line if they don't vote for Hillary Clinton the war criminal I
[03:03:20.680 --> 03:03:24.600]  totally get it it's crazy thanks for letting me say my piece Alex I really
[03:03:24.600 --> 03:03:27.660]  appreciate it no thank you my friend look we're all brothers and arms in this
[03:03:27.660 --> 03:03:32.120]  fight and I've had friends and family that have been EMT's and that is one
[03:03:32.120 --> 03:03:35.280]  job that is the probably one of the toughest jobs there is especially in a
[03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:40.520]  big city or I mean because you're just one dead baby you walk in a baby he's
[03:03:40.520 --> 03:03:43.880]  gotten up on a table and grabbed heroin and overdosed and it's it's still half
[03:03:43.880 --> 03:03:47.520]  alive but it dies in your arms I don't care how tough you are or then you go to a
[03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:50.760]  car wreck there's body strewn everywhere and arms and legs cut off and
[03:03:50.760 --> 03:03:55.800]  little kids crying I've only seen a few fatal wrecks that I pulled over and

[03:05:02.400 --> 03:05:05.920]  bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable
[03:05:05.920 --> 03:05:09.480]  components they also help prevent discomfort from a digestion caused by
[03:05:09.480 --> 03:05:13.000]  fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut digestive enzyme
[03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:16.720]  production declines as we age carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like
[03:05:16.720 --> 03:05:20.960]  those naturally present in the body enjoy the full potential of protein rich
[03:05:20.960 --> 03:05:25.480]  foods again you can eat protein heavy foods now while minimizing the later
[03:05:25.480 --> 03:05:29.920]  indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets just one
[03:05:29.920 --> 03:05:33.280]  pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and

[03:06:09.680 --> 03:06:15.920]  the resistance rallying patriots worldwide
[03:06:15.920 --> 03:06:26.440]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show you know I've gotten some really bad
[03:06:26.440 --> 03:06:33.480]  news lately from high-level connected sources major editors and I'm gonna try
[03:06:33.480 --> 03:06:36.560]  to investigate this morning I'm gonna ask Paul to investigate this morning we
[03:06:36.560 --> 03:06:44.480]  can get on the ball here because I'm not in competition with world net daily I'm
[03:06:44.480 --> 03:06:48.120]  not in competition with a daily caller I'm not competition with right bar I
[03:06:48.120 --> 03:06:53.800]  want more groups like that more organizations all drudge does is
[03:06:53.800 --> 03:06:57.880]  link to people and give them everything and they hardly ever even give him any
[03:06:57.880 --> 03:07:00.680]  love back and I just say that because without drudge I was thinking about that
[03:07:00.680 --> 03:07:04.720]  last night I was just like it isn't just like saying it about drudge it's the
[03:07:04.720 --> 03:07:12.080]  truth like we don't do enough to think much because without drudge it that's
[03:07:12.080 --> 03:07:17.080]  just the spoke to the whole deal that's that's the heart of it and of course
[03:07:17.080 --> 03:07:21.440]  you're the whole engine and God's the whole universe the the spectrum in
[03:07:21.440 --> 03:07:26.560]  which we live the ocean in which we swim but I was recently talking to a
[03:07:26.560 --> 03:07:33.400]  direct source about Breitbart I'm gonna get Paul to look into this and right
[03:07:33.400 --> 03:07:36.960]  bar being taken over by some left-wing consortium and sensitivity training and
[03:07:36.960 --> 03:07:41.480]  that they're about to derail the whole thing and bring Breitbart down and that's
[03:07:41.480 --> 03:07:45.440]  a real real tragedy of that's the case but you know all that talent will just
[03:07:45.440 --> 03:07:50.360]  go elsewhere so I asked Paul in a minute if he's heard anything about that Paul
[03:07:50.360 --> 03:07:53.840]  Joseph Watson here just a moment because I haven't really talked to him about this
[03:07:53.840 --> 03:07:58.000]  yet but right now real fast because I gotta get to Paul he's he's here to host
[03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.880]  everybody wants to hear him but I want to hear from Tim and Mike as well as
[03:08:00.880 --> 03:08:04.000]  been holding a long time Tim in the FEMA region 10 you're on the air worldwide
[03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:11.400]  go ahead you take my call good afternoon thank you sir Alex wanted I've been
[03:08:11.400 --> 03:08:16.360]  listening to you since I was a small boy so probably 15 16 years I'm gonna get
[03:08:16.360 --> 03:08:19.800]  into Bolton but I just want to make a suggestion to you sir
[03:08:19.800 --> 03:08:25.360]  Alstons I listened to years ago would have called him out immediately like
[03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:28.800]  you know I've heard it out of your mouth this is messed up World War three okay
[03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:33.600]  you know you and I want to make a suggestion on your show sir is for you
[03:08:33.600 --> 03:08:38.520]  used to talk like today you scratch the surface just a little bit with Cecil
[03:08:38.520 --> 03:08:43.560]  Rhodes and his round table but you used to go in-depth every day listen to I
[03:08:43.560 --> 03:08:47.720]  learned so much about you know UNESCO Carnegie Endowment Ford Foundation
[03:08:47.720 --> 03:08:54.520]  trilateral Commission and you just OECD and you would just hit that home every
[03:08:54.520 --> 03:08:58.280]  day I feel like now when I listen to it's just Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump and
[03:08:58.280 --> 03:09:01.920]  well yeah that's because we blow a big hole in their main operation and have
[03:09:01.920 --> 03:09:06.360]  invaded and and and I see that Trump's for real we're transferring the power
[03:09:06.360 --> 03:09:09.560]  back to the country so I'm focusing on that beachhead because the enemy's
[03:09:09.560 --> 03:09:13.480]  trying to take that out I was trying to build the movement for people to be
[03:09:13.480 --> 03:09:17.560]  literate about who ran things with the globalist were and then a president came
[03:09:17.560 --> 03:09:23.320]  and said American is it not globalism or I just had cone resigned because he's a
[03:09:23.320 --> 03:09:28.120]  globalist I mean you understand we've moved the ball so far down now that
[03:09:28.120 --> 03:09:32.680]  we've done that and I still do it constantly actually probably three four
[03:09:32.680 --> 03:09:37.040]  times today and I should go back into all those histories and things it's just
[03:09:37.040 --> 03:09:39.680]  that I've looked at it so many times and know about it it's kind of like ancient
[03:09:39.680 --> 03:09:45.720]  history I know it's important I've been doing this 20-something years and you're
[03:09:45.720 --> 03:09:49.600]  absolutely right that we should cover those things more but do you
[03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:55.400]  recognize that we now have won many levels of that now we are we have now
[03:09:55.400 --> 03:09:59.400]  invaded our country again they're trying to retake the Republic we've now
[03:09:59.400 --> 03:10:04.280]  moved into the next phase oh absolutely Alex you know I voted for Trump on the
[03:10:04.280 --> 03:10:08.680]  United States Navy veteran you know I'm a patriot just like yourself and I know
[03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:13.400]  that we are you know moving the ball forward like you said but you know things
[03:10:13.400 --> 03:10:17.280]  I talk to my dad about every single day is like I see Trump do greatness and I
[03:10:17.280 --> 03:10:20.920]  listened to you and now you know and every single day but and then I see him
[03:10:20.920 --> 03:10:24.680]  make questionable decisions it's like good what are you doing I'll tell you
[03:10:24.680 --> 03:10:28.800]  why because he's not a dictator and I'm not saying he should be he can't let them
[03:10:28.800 --> 03:10:31.200]  hold the country hostage from his perspective and I tend to agree with
[03:10:31.200 --> 03:10:36.240]  him it's not perfect he has to get deals done he but overall look how much
[03:10:36.240 --> 03:10:41.000]  better it is and look how much they hating oh I agree I'm not complaining but
[03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:45.320]  why doesn't he hire Dr. Corsi Dr. Pachennick you know hire one of them get
[03:10:45.320 --> 03:10:49.040]  them got get those guys in or what about Governor Ventura you know I would love
[03:10:49.040 --> 03:10:51.720]  to hear him back on to the show he I haven't heard him in a while no we should
[03:10:51.720 --> 03:10:54.360]  try to get him back on well you know I like I like Jesse but I disagree with
[03:10:54.360 --> 03:10:57.600]  some of his politics and he is a show argument when he's on he just seems like
[03:10:57.600 --> 03:11:01.200]  kind of mad about the world and whatever so she's kind of a sideways
[03:11:01.200 --> 03:11:04.760]  interview we should get Ventura back on I got a jump thank you so much let's go
[03:11:04.760 --> 03:11:09.520]  to Tim in Philadelphia go ahead you're on the air that was Tim that's what I
[03:11:09.520 --> 03:11:12.400]  meant then I was gonna go to the other caller about the body bags and all the
[03:11:12.400 --> 03:11:17.040]  rest of he dropped I thought that I was looking Tim is Tim all right I'm out of
[03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:20.080]  time for callers I'm sorry I can't get to the other ones Paul Joseph Watson's
[03:11:20.080 --> 03:11:23.280]  gonna take over I'm just gonna say this briefly so I didn't really plug last hour
[03:11:23.280 --> 03:11:28.800]  you see them on C-span you see them on ABC NBC CBS you see them on the Daily Show
[03:11:28.800 --> 03:11:31.840]  I didn't even play do we have that Daily Show boiled down I'll play that right
[03:11:31.840 --> 03:11:38.120]  now they had the Daily Show or is that the old Daily Show host whatever NBC's
[03:11:38.120 --> 03:11:43.880]  house who's the idiot Stephen Colbert what's he on now I'm not trying to act
[03:11:43.880 --> 03:11:48.440]  cool saying that he taxable time I don't pay attention we have a clip where he
[03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:54.440]  had the main guy from Silicon Valley on and they're implying that I'm attacking
[03:11:54.440 --> 03:11:58.360]  him as being a beta male when he was on the cover of a magazine celebrating the
[03:11:58.360 --> 03:12:02.120]  triumph of the beta male and I wasn't even saying the cast was bad or he was
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:05.200]  bad or that might judge my good friend is bad I know a lot of the cast been
[03:12:05.200 --> 03:12:08.960]  shooting with him and out with them so much invited me out there in Austin I
[03:12:08.960 --> 03:12:12.480]  think that guy shot with us I recognizing the point it's why he says oh I
[03:12:12.480 --> 03:12:17.600]  know Alex Jones Thomas Middle Ditch that's a nice fake name responds to Alex
[03:12:17.600 --> 03:12:21.560]  Jones beta male criticism no they're pushing beta male they're saying toxic
[03:12:21.560 --> 03:12:26.960]  masculinity is bad the family is bad Trudeau in Canada wants to ban the word
[03:12:26.960 --> 03:12:31.240]  mother I should have let the show of that either telling government agencies
[03:12:31.240 --> 03:12:38.280]  don't use the word mother someone else might not have a mother so it's hurtful
[03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:43.920]  so let's go ahead and play just a few excerpts of the show with Stephen Colbert
[03:12:43.920 --> 03:12:48.520]  last night here it is it's ruffled some feathers I know I've heard I've heard
[03:12:48.520 --> 03:12:52.320]  the legends yeah that the beta males are taken over you know Alex Jones is
[03:12:52.320 --> 03:12:56.840]  right of course Alex Jones said this he the all right feels threatened he says
[03:12:56.840 --> 03:13:01.560]  Alex Jones said the globalists are teaching us to turn off our life force
[03:13:01.560 --> 03:13:06.560]  it's a camouflage so the alpha males that are still left don't notice they're
[03:13:06.560 --> 03:13:11.920]  being taken control of and being enslaved yeah is this true is this true
[03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:15.120]  Bob Townsend are you enslaving the alpha male because you know I consider
[03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:19.680]  myself a bit of an alpha male time oh really so do I see oh do you really yeah
[03:13:19.680 --> 03:13:24.520]  I go to bed in full plaid eating a cheeseburger and shooting a gun oh really
[03:13:24.520 --> 03:13:30.640]  yeah I go to bed in camo you can't even find me I mean I remember when when well
[03:13:30.640 --> 03:13:33.680]  I guess they didn't know maybe they announced it when I heard Google was
[03:13:33.680 --> 03:13:38.600]  essentially catering your searches based on algorithms like we would say we
[03:13:38.600 --> 03:13:42.440]  would search the same thing and we would potentially get different results based
[03:13:42.440 --> 03:13:45.560]  on our previous searches right it's all the aggregation of the internet it's
[03:13:45.560 --> 03:13:49.000]  like the worst thing to have happened Twitter it's like you how can you can
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:55.400]  control elections with bots and minions to like create trends when they don't
[03:13:55.400 --> 03:13:58.720]  even exist that didn't surprise me although to be honest I'm happy it's out
[03:13:58.720 --> 03:14:04.940]  there so maybe people can take the red pill and get woke it's documented we
[03:14:04.940 --> 03:14:11.440]  got aliens you're an alien I'm an alien by my protein powder

[03:15:24.800 --> 03:15:27.800]  happening make the choice whether you want to be like this or not they want
[03:15:27.800 --> 03:15:32.680]  to make themselves victims and say that I'm just attacking them because they

[03:17:58.160 --> 03:18:01.600]  Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[03:18:01.600 --> 03:18:06.760]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy they are your body's cellular
[03:18:06.760 --> 03:18:11.480]  engines. Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting
[03:18:11.480 --> 03:18:15.540]  mitochondria much like a cellular engine overhaul because when your
[03:18:15.540 --> 03:18:19.720]  mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency then they start producing
[03:18:19.720 --> 03:18:25.240]  reactive oxygen species. Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by
[03:18:25.240 --> 03:18:31.080]  cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species. The antioxidants
[03:18:31.080 --> 03:18:35.280]  found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market. The
[03:18:35.280 --> 03:18:39.560]  stronger the antioxidant the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive
[03:18:39.560 --> 03:18:45.400]  oxygen species and other free radicals. Boost, protect and adapt with Cell

[03:18:54.520 --> 03:18:58.560]  The reason Info Wars Life has five star ratings on major third-party sites is
[03:18:58.560 --> 03:19:02.440]  because I want products I'm gonna use for my family. I take this my family takes
[03:19:02.440 --> 03:19:05.640]  this and then it funds the operation but the most hardcore truthful

[03:19:17.560 --> 03:19:21.400]  nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me. Yeah I've
[03:19:21.400 --> 03:19:25.880]  actually have just run out of my superfemale I had a few bottles at my
[03:19:25.880 --> 03:19:29.920]  house and I've been taking it again hitting the gym once again very
[03:19:29.920 --> 03:19:36.080]  exciting feeling great looking good and I know my hair is luxurious once again
[03:19:36.080 --> 03:19:41.560]  so obviously a superfemale is amazing I love it. nascent iodine is essential
[03:19:41.560 --> 03:19:44.840]  survival shield x2 if there's one product that I would say is life-changing
[03:19:44.840 --> 03:19:49.840]  that I would suggest it's nascent iodine survival shield x2 it's got a five star
[03:19:49.840 --> 03:19:54.880]  rating it's a win-win in foalwarslife.com
[03:19:54.880 --> 03:20:02.160]  you're listening to the alex joneshow
[03:20:06.720 --> 03:20:14.000]  live from the InfoWars.com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow
[03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:19.880]  and now your host Paul joseph Watson
[03:20:19.880 --> 03:20:24.600]  we're live on the fourth hour of the alex joneshow on this Friday edition
[03:20:24.600 --> 03:20:28.920]  now obviously there's been huge fallout over the signing of this budget bill
[03:20:28.920 --> 03:20:34.600]  which happened just over an hour ago in the White House absolute revolve
[03:20:34.600 --> 03:20:40.000]  revolve in many quarters amongst Trump's base that he signed this package that it
[03:20:40.000 --> 03:20:43.640]  basically devotes very little money to the border wall along the Mexican border
[03:20:43.640 --> 03:20:49.320]  while devoting significantly more money to border walls in places like Jordan
[03:20:49.320 --> 03:20:52.840]  places like Tunisia all over the world which have nothing really to do with the
[03:20:52.840 --> 03:20:57.880]  security of United States citizens domestically going through some of the
[03:20:57.880 --> 03:21:02.840]  responses that we've seen to this in the past hour Mike Cernovich tweets
[03:21:02.840 --> 03:21:06.640]  obviously a regular guest on the show I've revised my odds that Trump will be
[03:21:06.640 --> 03:21:11.520]  impeached from five percent to 35 percent they're saying the fury is so
[03:21:11.520 --> 03:21:15.000]  intense over this that people are going to be turned off people are going to
[03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:19.840]  become disenfranchised and the Democrats are going to win the house later this
[03:21:19.840 --> 03:21:24.760]  year there you see Cernovich's first tweet he also tweeted this congratulations to
[03:21:24.760 --> 03:21:28.480]  my liberal friends you're getting Congress back I hope your party does
[03:21:28.480 --> 03:21:33.280]  more for you than real Donald Trump has done for his supporters so that is you
[03:21:33.280 --> 03:21:37.160]  could call it strident criticism if you are being negative about it you could
[03:21:37.160 --> 03:21:41.480]  call it throwing toys out of the pram but this is the sentiment amongst
[03:21:41.480 --> 03:21:45.720]  basically all of Trump's base all of Trump's most prominent base at least in
[03:21:45.720 --> 03:21:50.280]  terms of media Jack Posovic tweets have spoken to many high-profile Trump
[03:21:50.280 --> 03:21:54.200]  supporters today after bill signing now a single one of them think GOP will keep
[03:21:54.200 --> 03:21:58.400]  the house now so they think because of this the momentum has been completely
[03:21:58.400 --> 03:22:03.720]  stopped everybody's irate over it and this is going to cost the GOP the house
[03:22:03.720 --> 03:22:09.280]  later this year which obviously opens up at least the potential for impeachment
[03:22:09.280 --> 03:22:13.080]  there's a headline up on info wars.com right now Trump base revolts over
[03:22:13.080 --> 03:22:17.840]  signing of budget bill this is the day that the swamp won and it goes through
[03:22:17.840 --> 03:22:21.960]  more reaction from more prominent pro-trump people on Twitter Mark Pantano
[03:22:21.960 --> 03:22:28.080]  tweeted this March 23rd 2018 this is the day the swamp won Trump surrendered
[03:22:28.080 --> 03:22:33.160]  and called her who of course has been hot on the case of the border wall for
[03:22:33.160 --> 03:22:37.520]  over a year now very critical of Trump at every step of the way she tweeted this
[03:22:37.520 --> 03:22:42.000]  quoting Trump who said I will never sign another bill like this again she said
[03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:47.680]  yep because you'll be impeached that is the level that is the visceral
[03:22:47.680 --> 03:22:52.920]  vitriolic level of feedback of reaction to the signing of this bill she followed
[03:22:52.920 --> 03:22:56.520]  up with another tweet remember this is Engkul she got millions of
[03:22:56.520 --> 03:23:00.720]  followers big conservative following she tweeted this massive defense spending
[03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:06.280]  to induct transgenders and build big beautiful walls in Jordan Lebanon Egypt
[03:23:06.280 --> 03:23:12.760]  and Tunisia so again the bill devotes more money to these walls in Tunisia in
[03:23:12.760 --> 03:23:17.560]  Jordan to stop ISIS getting into Jordan in one case than it does the US Mexico
[03:23:17.560 --> 03:23:21.880]  border wall we're also going to go to another story soon about how it actually
[03:23:21.880 --> 03:23:26.400]  disqualifies Trump from using the types of wall that he visited that he went down
[03:23:26.400 --> 03:23:31.920]  to the border to visit just days ago he's also not getting the 1000 ICE agents
[03:23:31.920 --> 03:23:36.840]  that he wanted out of this bill he's getting absolutely nothing out of this
[03:23:36.840 --> 03:23:40.680]  bill he threatened to veto it he signed it anyway people are absolutely apoplectic
[03:23:40.680 --> 03:23:45.360]  they're furious Stefan Molyneux tweets this it might be my memory or maybe I'm
[03:23:45.360 --> 03:23:48.960]  just getting hard of hearing but I don't recall chance of dramatically increased
[03:23:48.960 --> 03:23:55.080]  military funding and protect dreamers at Trump's campaign events another I rate
[03:23:55.080 --> 03:23:58.560]  angry reaction from Stefan Molyneux that I mean I put in the article it was a
[03:23:58.560 --> 03:24:03.080]  mixture of deep disappointment and outrage it's been mainly outraged to be
[03:24:03.080 --> 03:24:06.680]  honest with you another Jack Pozoic tweet here if the bill is all about
[03:24:06.680 --> 03:24:12.040]  military funding why not just do a clean military funding bill instead it's got
[03:24:12.040 --> 03:24:14.840]  all this pork barrel it's got all this funding for all these ridiculous
[03:24:14.840 --> 03:24:19.400]  projects many of which Trump supporters never signed on for in the first place in
[03:24:19.400 --> 03:24:22.600]  fact they demanded the opposite Trump promised it and now they're getting the
[03:24:22.600 --> 03:24:26.840]  opposite of what he promised of course Matt Drudge had the headline up fake
[03:24:26.840 --> 03:24:32.640]  veto that's his top story this story is out of daily caller broken promise
[03:24:32.640 --> 03:24:37.040]  Trump GLP Congress give Planned Parenthood five hundred million dollars in
[03:24:37.040 --> 03:24:42.200]  taxpayer funds that is not something that conservative Republicans voted for
[03:24:42.200 --> 03:24:45.000]  is it President Donald Trump congressional Republicans broke their
[03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:49.520]  promise to conservative voters by giving Planned Parenthood approximately five
[03:24:49.520 --> 03:24:53.240]  hundred million dollars in taxpayer funding and the ominous bit in the
[03:24:53.240 --> 03:24:57.800]  omnibus bill that Trump signed into law today Trump Speaker of the House Paul
[03:24:57.800 --> 03:25:01.080]  Ryan and other Republican leaders promised their voters for years that
[03:25:01.080 --> 03:25:05.760]  they would defund Planned Parenthood if given the chance to govern but now with
[03:25:05.760 --> 03:25:08.920]  Republican majorities in the House and Senate and Republican in the White House
[03:25:08.920 --> 03:25:12.680]  the nation's number one killer of unborn children will continue receiving
[03:25:12.680 --> 03:25:17.320]  hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer funding Chuck Schumer's happy
[03:25:17.320 --> 03:25:22.760]  about it Nancy Pelosi's happy about it Lindsey Graham's over the moon now if
[03:25:22.760 --> 03:25:26.120]  you're impressing those kind of people if those kind of people are falling over
[03:25:26.120 --> 03:25:31.160]  you something has gone decidedly wrong and people are pointing it out
[03:25:31.160 --> 03:25:37.000]  immediately after this happened CNS news reports Congressman had 1000 minutes to
[03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:42.840]  read 2232 page bill you saw Rand Paul complaining about this vehemently last
[03:25:42.840 --> 03:25:47.080]  night the stack was what was it like that big like two feet three feet tall
[03:25:47.080 --> 03:25:52.080]  just the bill alone they had 1000 minutes to read it none of them read it
[03:25:52.080 --> 03:25:56.040]  they just passed it anyway members of the House of Representatives have 1000
[03:25:56.040 --> 03:26:00.320]  minutes overnight but some of them probably didn't even read a page of it
[03:26:00.320 --> 03:26:07.880]  to read a 2232 page bill that spends 1.3 trillion and it gets more into that so
[03:26:07.880 --> 03:26:14.640]  absolute rank or over this budget bill GOP and Democrat this is bright but GOP
[03:26:14.640 --> 03:26:18.960]  and Democrats fully fund a border wall that's great right now it's not it's in
[03:26:18.960 --> 03:26:24.640]  Jordan it's not in the Mexico border the 2018 omnibus bill provides just enough
[03:26:24.640 --> 03:26:31.440]  funds to build 33 miles of fencing on the Texas border so you saw Trump come
[03:26:31.440 --> 03:26:35.800]  out after he signed this bill and say look this is a this is a start this is a
[03:26:35.800 --> 03:26:41.560]  first step this will fulfill short-term funding for the border wall but it's it
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:46.120]  will pay for 33 miles of fencing this is not even the proper border wall that he
[03:26:46.120 --> 03:26:50.560]  asked for it's not the border wall he went and visited or the prototypes for
[03:26:50.560 --> 03:26:55.960]  it a few days ago and the headline on that is spending Bill Trump banned from
[03:26:55.960 --> 03:27:00.320]  building border wall with prototypes he tore in San Diego so this bill
[03:27:00.320 --> 03:27:05.040]  specifically specifically bans president Trump's Department of Homeland
[03:27:05.040 --> 03:27:08.360]  Security from building new border walls and fencing with the prototype designs
[03:27:08.360 --> 03:27:13.760]  the president's much recently visited so those huge walls that you saw that
[03:27:13.760 --> 03:27:17.840]  actually would keep people out unlike the miles of pointless fencing that went
[03:27:17.840 --> 03:27:23.120]  up under George W. Bush and other presidents that has now been banned by
[03:27:23.120 --> 03:27:27.760]  Trump signing this bill why do you think people are furious about this so you've
[03:27:27.760 --> 03:27:34.600]  got 33 miles of fencing that's paid for 1.6 billion dollars beyond that nothing
[03:27:34.600 --> 03:27:39.960]  absolutely nothing but Jordan on the other hand let me look at this what is
[03:27:39.960 --> 03:27:45.280]  this 500 million dollars of funds appropriated for a border wall in
[03:27:45.280 --> 03:27:51.240]  Jordan they've also got walls in Syria walls in Tunisia Lebanon Egypt Tunisia
[03:27:51.240 --> 03:27:57.040]  to stop Islamic State militants trans transferring between those countries so
[03:27:57.040 --> 03:28:01.520]  Jordan gets 500 million these other countries get hundreds of million so
[03:28:01.520 --> 03:28:06.440]  actually I think it equates to more money being sent abroad these border walls
[03:28:06.440 --> 03:28:11.000]  in Middle Eastern countries than the border wall in the United States which
[03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:14.880]  was a centerpiece of Donald Trump's campaign now you see why people are
[03:28:14.880 --> 03:28:20.600]  angry about this spending bill does not fund 1,000 new deportation agents
[03:28:20.600 --> 03:28:25.440]  Trump requested again out of Breitbart the omnibus spending bill passed by
[03:28:25.440 --> 03:28:29.720]  Republicans today does not fund the 1,000 new immigration and customs
[03:28:29.720 --> 03:28:33.560]  enforcement agents that President Trump requested last year it only funds an
[03:28:33.560 --> 03:28:40.400]  additional 65 ICE agents you got 65 out of a thousand that cannot be called
[03:28:40.400 --> 03:28:46.040]  anything other than a failure than a disaster and people are angry we'll be

[03:31:07.040 --> 03:31:12.720]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[03:31:12.720 --> 03:31:16.640]  researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[03:31:16.640 --> 03:31:21.280]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[03:31:21.280 --> 03:31:25.840]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[03:31:25.840 --> 03:31:30.520]  of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal
[03:31:30.520 --> 03:31:35.080]  distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[03:31:35.080 --> 03:31:39.160]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[03:31:39.160 --> 03:31:43.640]  blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and

[03:36:28.440 --> 03:36:35.920]  discounts today infowarstore.com now Lindsey Graham has come out and praise
[03:36:35.920 --> 03:36:40.440]  Donald Trump should we be concerned Lindsey Graham Trump has been one hell
[03:36:40.440 --> 03:36:44.200]  of a good commander-in-chief this was over the appointment of John Bolton
[03:36:44.200 --> 03:36:48.280]  Friday Lindsey Graham spoke very highly of President Donald Trump after he
[03:36:48.280 --> 03:36:51.360]  announced former UN ambassador John Bolton would serve as his national
[03:36:51.360 --> 03:36:54.920]  security advisor building to Graham Bolton's appointment sends a strong
[03:36:54.920 --> 03:36:58.320]  message to the United States adversaries to which Graham described Trump as one
[03:36:58.320 --> 03:37:01.880]  hell of a good commander-in-chief now this Bolton thing of course has split
[03:37:01.880 --> 03:37:06.480]  opinion as well obviously he's an improvement on McMaster but he is a
[03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:12.040]  neocon he did advocate propagandize sign on for the invasion of Iraq and
[03:37:12.040 --> 03:37:17.240]  continues as far as I'm concerned and I haven't read any retraction to think
[03:37:17.240 --> 03:37:20.640]  that Middle Eastern intervention is a good thing when it obviously isn't and
[03:37:20.640 --> 03:37:26.000]  it's been proven completely disastrous for decades on end well you know some
[03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:30.080]  people say he's a neocon but he's a neocon he does understand the threat of
[03:37:30.080 --> 03:37:36.000]  Islamic terrorism way more than PC McMaster did so he is an improvement but
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:40.640]  again that split opinion although the fact that Lindsey Graham is now praising
[03:37:40.640 --> 03:37:45.120]  Donald Trump is probably not a great sign especially if you combine it with
[03:37:45.120 --> 03:37:49.840]  this budget bill which has caused an absolute eruption amongst Trump's base
[03:37:49.840 --> 03:37:54.120]  we'll see I mean this is the biggest eruption of outrage of disappointment
[03:37:54.120 --> 03:37:59.240]  I've seen since last year when he struck Syria again to relapse to relieve
[03:37:59.240 --> 03:38:04.920]  himself of pressure from the deep state is why he essentially did it so we'll
[03:38:04.920 --> 03:38:08.200]  see I mean this is the biggest the biggest volley of outrage I've seen
[03:38:08.200 --> 03:38:13.160]  since that will he try and walk it back will he try and sign a new bill into
[03:38:13.160 --> 03:38:17.200]  place to fund the border wall how's he gonna do that when all this money is
[03:38:17.200 --> 03:38:21.000]  going to these foreign countries to build border walls in Jordan and Tunisia
[03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:25.360]  and Egypt it remains to be seen but again massive eruption of outrage and
[03:38:25.360 --> 03:38:29.160]  disappointment amongst Trump's base over the signing of that bill especially
[03:38:29.160 --> 03:38:33.520]  given you know four or five hours ago he suggested he implied he was going to
[03:38:33.520 --> 03:38:38.880]  veto it then he signed it anyway and said oh I need a veto on each line
[03:38:38.880 --> 03:38:42.920]  item which well wait for the wait for that to come along then don't sign the
[03:38:42.920 --> 03:38:47.560]  bill you know others are saying he was you know 700 million dollars for the
[03:38:47.560 --> 03:38:50.240]  military that's a good thing that there's a saying we didn't elect Donald
[03:38:50.240 --> 03:38:54.920]  Trump to beef up the US military to have more interventionist wars so again
[03:38:54.920 --> 03:38:58.960]  this is goes to big rockers and it's gonna rumble over the weekend let's move
[03:38:58.960 --> 03:39:03.040]  into some European news now though because we had another Islamic terror
[03:39:03.040 --> 03:39:07.960]  attack in Europe today terrorist hostage take a shot dead in France after
[03:39:07.960 --> 03:39:12.560]  killing three and injuring several now this is a an attacker who shattered
[03:39:12.560 --> 03:39:18.960]  Al-Rakbar before attacking a supermarket he killed a butcher who was working in
[03:39:18.960 --> 03:39:23.040]  the supermarket whether that had anything to do with the religion of peace
[03:39:23.040 --> 03:39:27.720]  remains to be seen in terms of the fact that it's a butcher obviously the
[03:39:27.720 --> 03:39:32.200]  implication is obvious there was a man who was killed in jail in the UK because
[03:39:32.200 --> 03:39:38.400]  he left a bacon sandwich outside a mosque but now this attacker killed three
[03:39:38.400 --> 03:39:43.520]  people and in fact one of the hostages he took hostages inside this supermarket
[03:39:43.520 --> 03:39:47.280]  but one of the police officers offered to exchange himself for the hostage he's
[03:39:47.280 --> 03:39:52.040]  now in critical condition in hospital but an absolute hero for doing that
[03:39:52.040 --> 03:39:56.680]  selfless act the gunman reportedly of Moroccan origin first open fire at four
[03:39:56.680 --> 03:40:01.040]  police officers in the historic town of car cassone on Friday morning he later
[03:40:01.040 --> 03:40:05.520]  stormed supermarket in the nearby town of treviz taking numerous hostages so
[03:40:05.520 --> 03:40:11.160]  eventually actually didn't take the police that long to storm the supermarket
[03:40:11.160 --> 03:40:16.320]  and liquidate the terrorists probably based that decision was all obviously
[03:40:16.320 --> 03:40:20.920]  probably based on the abatto clan siege which was absolutely disastrous because
[03:40:20.920 --> 03:40:26.440]  they waited for far too long before storming the building but the situation
[03:40:26.440 --> 03:40:30.920]  in France is desperate I mean you have Marine Le Pen her immunity was stripped
[03:40:30.920 --> 03:40:37.720]  she's facing charges of hate speech now for posting pictures of Islamic State
[03:40:37.720 --> 03:40:43.280]  atrocities online to draw attention to the atrocities of the Islamic State so
[03:40:43.280 --> 03:40:47.360]  you've got a situation in these European countries in France in Sweden in
[03:40:47.360 --> 03:40:51.880]  Germany in the UK seen in the UK over the past couple of weeks for sure where
[03:40:51.880 --> 03:40:56.600]  people are getting prosecuted for words for speech for satire
[03:40:56.600 --> 03:41:02.320]  meanwhile all these Islamic terrorists who fought for ISIS as ISIS falls are
[03:41:02.320 --> 03:41:06.640]  coming back into Europe not being apprehended not being in prison being
[03:41:06.640 --> 03:41:11.000]  rolled out red carpet in some cases being given welfare and housing meanwhile
[03:41:11.000 --> 03:41:16.760]  people like Marine Le Pen are being prosecuted for posting pictures of ISIS
[03:41:16.760 --> 03:41:22.040]  she faces three years in prison meanwhile they let the terrorists back in I
[03:41:22.040 --> 03:41:26.400]  mean even in Belgium now I was reading about Belgium at least they imprisoned
[03:41:26.400 --> 03:41:29.720]  them at least they put them in some senses in solitary confinement they
[03:41:29.720 --> 03:41:34.440]  stopped them from radicalizing the other prisoners in the UK in Sweden in
[03:41:34.440 --> 03:41:38.520]  France in these other countries they just they come right on in oh you can
[03:41:38.520 --> 03:41:42.720]  walk around Westminster in the centre of Parliament with an ISIS flag on your
[03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:46.840]  back the police won't do anything they'll send you on your way don't you dare
[03:41:46.840 --> 03:41:51.280]  post a satirical video about a pug dog though because you're gonna get locked
[03:41:51.280 --> 03:41:56.680]  up in a cage and we've got some stories on that actually today this is out of
[03:41:56.680 --> 03:42:02.360]  dangerous.com hypocrisy Graham Linnahan celebrates the death of free speech now
[03:42:02.360 --> 03:42:05.960]  it's a good thing that some British comedians have come out and defended
[03:42:05.960 --> 03:42:09.240]  Count Dankula the guy obviously you've heard him on the show he put out the
[03:42:09.240 --> 03:42:14.720]  video who convicted convicted of grossly offending the Jewish community or
[03:42:14.720 --> 03:42:20.280]  whoever faces up to a year in jail some comedians have supported him Graham
[03:42:20.280 --> 03:42:24.920]  Linnahan hasn't because he's a far-left ideologue he's a complete idiot he
[03:42:24.920 --> 03:42:29.280]  openly supports Antifa now what's funny about it is that Graham Linnahan who
[03:42:29.280 --> 03:42:34.440]  supports locking people up for mocking Nazis essentially made a television
[03:42:34.440 --> 03:42:39.080]  series called Father Ted about 20 years ago in which the characters dressed up
[03:42:39.080 --> 03:42:43.560]  as Nazis and acted like Nazis to mock Nazis so I guess they should be in prison
[03:42:43.560 --> 03:42:47.880]  and Graham Linnahan should be in prison but no he's a complete hypocrite
[03:42:47.880 --> 03:42:52.480]  sending other people to cages for the exact same thing we'll be back on the

[03:47:17.680 --> 03:47:24.360]  and now your host Paul Joseph Watson
[03:47:24.360 --> 03:47:29.440]  you're back on the Alex Jones show live let's get in some more news out of Europe
[03:47:29.440 --> 03:47:33.680]  right now this is up on info wars.com German minister on migrant knife crime
[03:47:33.680 --> 03:47:40.160]  don't let people get close to you what a solution there is how you don't get
[03:47:40.160 --> 03:47:44.520]  stabbed to just avoid people who want to stab you well you don't really see him
[03:47:44.520 --> 03:47:48.600]  coming you don't really see him coming do you that's kind of how it happens the
[03:47:48.600 --> 03:47:53.160]  German minister has caused controversy after he reacted to reports of increased
[03:47:53.160 --> 03:47:57.520]  knife crime amongst migrants by telling German citizens to not this is a quote
[03:47:57.520 --> 03:48:02.360]  let people get close to you knife crime is surging in Germany and I go through
[03:48:02.360 --> 03:48:07.520]  the stats in this article it's gone up 12,000% in the last ten years and over
[03:48:07.520 --> 03:48:13.600]  the last four or five years since 2013 it's jumped 600% which of course as we
[03:48:13.600 --> 03:48:17.080]  know has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that Angela Merkel and Germany
[03:48:17.080 --> 03:48:22.240]  have imported around 2 million largely Muslim migrants since 2015 there's no
[03:48:22.240 --> 03:48:26.240]  connection whatsoever despite a German federal ministry for family affairs
[03:48:26.240 --> 03:48:30.600]  study which revealed that there was a correlation between a surge in violent
[03:48:30.600 --> 03:48:34.840]  crime and the arrival of migrants with migrants being over represented in crime
[03:48:34.840 --> 03:48:39.400]  statistics so Germany like most of the European countries after cultural
[03:48:39.400 --> 03:48:44.520]  enrichment is experiencing a surge in violent crime in gang crime as well in
[03:48:44.520 --> 03:48:50.800]  some cases and now the way of dealing with that is not to reconsider whether
[03:48:50.800 --> 03:48:55.680]  inviting people in from these dangerous areas who tend to commit more crimes
[03:48:55.680 --> 03:49:01.000]  that are over represented in crime stats not to reconsider that policy but to
[03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:06.080]  just tell people to avoid stabbers and murderers just avoid them well we were
[03:49:06.080 --> 03:49:12.560]  doing that already who isn't avoiding being murdered I mean God forbid so this
[03:49:12.560 --> 03:49:17.840]  is Herbert rule he's the minister of the interior of North Rhine West Farley
[03:49:17.840 --> 03:49:22.800]  he's a member of Angela Merkel's CDU party so that's the main governing party
[03:49:22.800 --> 03:49:28.080]  despite the fact that it's basically been derailed since the last election but
[03:49:28.080 --> 03:49:32.840]  he came out in this video in German and the translations in the article where he
[03:49:32.840 --> 03:49:36.440]  just called for Germans he said this is this is the solution to migrant knife
[03:49:36.440 --> 03:49:41.160]  crime you have to be more sensitive towards it so you have to change your
[03:49:41.160 --> 03:49:45.840]  behavior the problems with you not with the criminal committing the crime he
[03:49:45.840 --> 03:49:48.960]  said quote citizens will just have to be more sensitive adding you don't
[03:49:48.960 --> 03:49:53.720]  necessarily have to let people get close to you now what does this remind you of
[03:49:53.720 --> 03:49:59.760]  well clone New Year's Eve 2015 what happened after the mass molestation of
[03:49:59.760 --> 03:50:03.720]  women in Cologne on that night by predominantly Muslim migrants asylum
[03:50:03.720 --> 03:50:08.800]  seekers the mayor of Cologne came out after Henrietta wrecker and told women
[03:50:08.800 --> 03:50:13.800]  in the aftermath of the mass molestation to just keep them at arms length
[03:50:13.800 --> 03:50:16.960]  remember that she was asked by a journalist how women could protect
[03:50:16.960 --> 03:50:20.040]  themselves against sexual assault while they were literally being surrounded by
[03:50:20.040 --> 03:50:25.880]  gangs of 20 30 men and grotes in some cases rate she said quote there's always
[03:50:25.880 --> 03:50:29.920]  the possibility of keeping a certain distance of more than an arms length
[03:50:29.920 --> 03:50:34.400]  nice to say make sure you don't look to be too close to people who are not known
[03:50:34.400 --> 03:50:39.960]  to you so the solution to not being raped is to just keep the rapist arms
[03:50:39.960 --> 03:50:45.160]  length and that's gonna work fine yeah I mean you don't need pepper spray you
[03:50:45.160 --> 03:50:49.720]  don't need to reassess the policy of importing rapists no just keep them arms
[03:50:49.720 --> 03:50:53.720]  on in fact there was a video released by police in Finland we played this way
[03:50:53.720 --> 03:50:58.680]  back probably a couple years ago now well they give women advice on how not to
[03:50:58.680 --> 03:51:05.000]  get raped it's literally this woman using the force the force and outstretching
[03:51:05.000 --> 03:51:09.920]  her hands to repel the rapist the would-be attacker with some kind of
[03:51:09.920 --> 03:51:15.000]  invisible force field like she's using the force to shoo him away they actually
[03:51:15.000 --> 03:51:19.680]  put that in a police video telling women how not to get raped I mean this is
[03:51:19.680 --> 03:51:25.080]  this is the level of meme this is the memeness of Europe right now that we've
[03:51:25.080 --> 03:51:28.960]  got people coming out and saying just a we don't want to get stabbed you've got
[03:51:28.960 --> 03:51:33.520]  a high risk of getting stabbed just avoid being stabbed like what what does
[03:51:33.520 --> 03:51:40.160]  that even mean absolutely incredible but there is hope in Italy which brings me
[03:51:40.160 --> 03:51:43.840]  to my next story you're a skeptic five-star on Liga are now the most
[03:51:43.840 --> 03:51:48.480]  popular parties in Italy now of course they came out on top during the recent
[03:51:48.480 --> 03:51:52.320]  Italian elections now the wave of anti-establishment you're a skeptic
[03:51:52.320 --> 03:51:55.520]  feeling in Italy felt through the election campaign and demonstrated by
[03:51:55.520 --> 03:52:00.240]  the result has carried on with the latest polls showing five-star and Liga
[03:52:00.240 --> 03:52:05.880]  which are the two anti-EU populist parties as the most popular parties in
[03:52:05.880 --> 03:52:09.880]  the country for the first time anti-matter migration Liga have overtaken the
[03:52:09.880 --> 03:52:15.040]  lefty PD which was the government before the election meaning that Italy's two
[03:52:15.040 --> 03:52:19.000]  most popular parties now comprised of rising political outsiders as a combination
[03:52:19.000 --> 03:52:24.720]  they now collectively poll 53% so they're still working out the negotiations
[03:52:24.720 --> 03:52:29.120]  for the coalition government there in Italy but whatever make up it has it's
[03:52:29.120 --> 03:52:33.280]  going to be a populist composition of parties and now those parties are the
[03:52:33.280 --> 03:52:38.320]  most popular in Italy so Italy is a beacon for the rest of Europe is a beacon
[03:52:38.320 --> 03:52:43.600]  for Sweden which has its election coming up in September later this year of
[03:52:43.600 --> 03:52:47.240]  course another country that has massive problems with immigration which is why
[03:52:47.240 --> 03:52:51.640]  there was populist parties in Italy one mainly because of sentiment based
[03:52:51.640 --> 03:52:57.800]  around immigration and the migrant crisis Breitbart reports only 22% of
[03:52:57.800 --> 03:53:02.400]  Britons want to stop Brexit almost 60% of Brits think the government should
[03:53:02.400 --> 03:53:07.280]  respect the referendum and get on with delivering Brexit and a new poll by BEMG
[03:53:07.280 --> 03:53:09.920]  for change Britain respondents were asked if they agreed that the government
[03:53:09.920 --> 03:53:13.000]  should get on with implementing the result of the referendum to take Britain
[03:53:13.000 --> 03:53:16.880]  out the EU and in doing so take back control of borders laws money and trade
[03:53:16.880 --> 03:53:23.000]  now 57% agreed that that should happen and less than a quarter just 22%
[03:53:23.000 --> 03:53:28.240]  disagree with the statement according to the results so again this whole
[03:53:28.240 --> 03:53:32.000]  narrative that we've had since Brexit the very months after Brexit and still
[03:53:32.000 --> 03:53:37.200]  today is that everyone regrets voting for Brexit no complete nonsense whenever
[03:53:37.200 --> 03:53:42.080]  they do the polls did you regret voting for Brexit it's always a tiny tiny
[03:53:42.080 --> 03:53:47.440]  percentage in the single digits now even with the backlash to it the people who
[03:53:47.440 --> 03:53:52.600]  basically don't support democracy they want a second referendum even once those
[03:53:52.600 --> 03:53:59.480]  people only 22% as the entire country want to stop Brexit so again the
[03:53:59.480 --> 03:54:03.080]  narrative that it was a huge mistake and that everybody regretted it proven
[03:54:03.080 --> 03:54:08.720]  completely false once again by actual polls now earlier this week on the Alex
[03:54:08.720 --> 03:54:14.000]  Jones show we had Count Dankula he of course faces up to a year in prison for
[03:54:14.000 --> 03:54:19.480]  a joke video which he made to mock Nazis like he turned his dog into the worst
[03:54:19.480 --> 03:54:24.520]  thing imaginable which was a Nazi which suggests that he hates Nazis too to
[03:54:24.520 --> 03:54:27.880]  insult his girlfriends and make a joke about his girlfriend because she loves
[03:54:27.880 --> 03:54:31.480]  the dog too much you've seen the video you've seen the aftermath you've seen
[03:54:31.480 --> 03:54:36.880]  the trial now he faces up to a year in prison now this is all happening
[03:54:36.880 --> 03:54:42.760]  meanwhile police in Britain in some cases in some areas are taking days to
[03:54:42.760 --> 03:54:47.520]  respond to emergency calls this is out of Breitbart again police force has taken
[03:54:47.520 --> 03:54:52.560]  days to respond to 999 calls while hate crime declared priority as forces in
[03:54:52.560 --> 03:54:55.840]  Britain declare tackling so-called hate crime a priority the police watchdog has
[03:54:55.840 --> 03:54:59.240]  released a report revealing officers are taking days to respond to emergency calls
[03:54:59.240 --> 03:55:06.520]  so in one area one area of the UK between 20% and 50% of reports requiring
[03:55:06.520 --> 03:55:13.120]  police to send a unit within 24 hours missed the target so they couldn't even
[03:55:13.120 --> 03:55:17.480]  get there within 24 hours after an emergency call this isn't a non-emergency
[03:55:17.480 --> 03:55:22.360]  situation with thousands of 999 calls assessors requiring action within an
[03:55:22.360 --> 03:55:26.960]  hour police of ours are in some cases several days to respond oh but if you
[03:55:26.960 --> 03:55:32.600]  send a mean tweet they'll be there pronto and in fact in the case of Count
[03:55:32.600 --> 03:55:36.120]  Dankula they tipped off the media had the media waiting outside his house to
[03:55:36.120 --> 03:55:40.080]  photograph it that was all a very well-organized operation wasn't it but
[03:55:40.080 --> 03:55:45.400]  if you've got an emergency which isn't oh somebody hurt my feelings it could
[03:55:45.400 --> 03:55:50.200]  take days here's another headline police Scotland create hate crime files and
[03:55:50.200 --> 03:55:55.960]  over 900 young teens in one year they've declared hate crime a prior priority in
[03:55:55.960 --> 03:56:03.040]  fact I was sent a tweet today or a DM on Twitter where somebody's son went on
[03:56:03.040 --> 03:56:09.600]  Snapchat and sent their friend an insult a home a homophobic insult it wasn't
[03:56:09.600 --> 03:56:15.560]  even that mean it was mild calling somebody gay in the in the context of an
[03:56:15.560 --> 03:56:23.280]  insult the police investigated it and the guy was punished and now it's his
[03:56:23.280 --> 03:56:26.680]  life is ruined they've got these WhatsApp messages of these young kids that
[03:56:26.680 --> 03:56:30.920]  are being made public again it's edgy humor they're insulting each other as
[03:56:30.920 --> 03:56:36.920]  boys as young men do but now because of an insult a homophobic insult that gets
[03:56:36.920 --> 03:56:43.280]  investigated we've had instances of playground insults with children 11
[03:56:43.280 --> 03:56:47.160]  years and younger someone insults someone else on the playground the police
[03:56:47.160 --> 03:56:51.560]  are called meanwhile violent crimes going up it's going up in London it's
[03:56:51.560 --> 03:56:56.560]  going up in Scotland too we've got vastly understaffed police forces we've got a
[03:56:56.560 --> 03:57:00.920]  lack of resources and money for police forces yet they're investigating
[03:57:00.920 --> 03:57:08.280]  Snapchat insults Snapchat insults and in some cases they can't respond to 999
[03:57:08.280 --> 03:57:13.680]  calls for days what the hell is happening in the United Kingdom this has
[03:57:13.680 --> 03:57:19.080]  really come to the boil over the past two weeks or so we also have Scottish
[03:57:19.080 --> 03:57:22.800]  police slam for threatening to track down anonymous Twitter users after Nazi
[03:57:22.800 --> 03:57:28.720]  pub case so they even even on top of all the absurdity all the ridiculousness
[03:57:28.720 --> 03:57:32.800]  they're still continuing the same policies meanwhile the ISIS jihadists
[03:57:32.800 --> 03:57:36.280]  are flooding back into the country the police can't even monitor them
[03:57:36.280 --> 03:57:39.800]  absolutely ludicrous that's gonna wrap it up for this hour
[03:57:39.800 --> 03:57:45.000]  war room with Owen Shroyer is coming up don't go away they use their media to
[03:57:45.000 --> 03:57:49.080]  assassinate real news they use their schools to teach children that their
[03:57:49.080 --> 03:57:53.320]  president is another Hitler they use their movie stars and singers and
[03:57:53.320 --> 03:57:57.960]  comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and
[03:57:57.960 --> 03:58:03.000]  then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance all to make them
[03:58:03.000 --> 03:58:08.360]  march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and
[03:58:08.360 --> 03:58:13.560]  homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports
[03:58:13.560 --> 03:58:18.600]  bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the
[03:58:18.600 --> 03:58:23.720]  police to do their jobs and stop the madness and when that happens they'll
[03:58:23.720 --> 03:58:29.200]  use it as an excuse for their outrage the only way we stop this the only way
