[00:00.000 --> 00:08.620]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:08.620 --> 00:16.060]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex
[00:16.060 --> 00:24.820]  Jones 22 days out from the election my friends of course the Democrats are
[00:24.820 --> 00:29.900]  gonna contest it the inauguration is 100 days out that's the real number to
[00:29.900 --> 00:38.560]  look at as Pelosi says out of the 20th amendment they are intending to hold
[00:38.560 --> 00:44.520]  up the inauguration so that the president then does not get installed
[00:44.520 --> 00:50.720]  by the voters but then the Democrat House will then vote on who becomes the
[00:50.720 --> 00:54.000]  president and or they have other procedures where they can go to the
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.760]  states and have them vote into it it's gonna be a fiasco of biblical biblical
[00:59.760 --> 01:03.800]  proportions and that's their plan that's what they're pushing for but let's get
[01:03.800 --> 01:09.540]  into it right now I got up here about two and a half hours ago and already
[01:09.540 --> 01:15.040]  been getting prepared for day and a half of this Sunday show and I was going
[01:15.040 --> 01:17.800]  through the Gateway Pundit stack of articles saddened print me all the
[01:17.800 --> 01:23.520]  Gateway Pundit articles and I just reeled back as I recognize the name it's
[01:23.520 --> 01:29.560]  the main global envoy or the voice of the UN on the COVID-19 response he's in
[01:29.560 --> 01:33.840]  line to be the head of the WHO next and he came out and said we got it in the
[01:33.840 --> 01:38.160]  lockdowns in the COVID-19 responses it's causing way more death than it's
[01:38.160 --> 01:44.440]  saving this is insane so you hear the record skip you hear the car crash noise
[01:44.440 --> 01:50.040]  right there it was the UN back in December last year said hey vaccines are
[01:50.040 --> 01:54.440]  killing people they're untested we need to pause vaccines the public doesn't
[01:54.440 --> 01:56.960]  believe in them the doctors don't believe in them but they said but we're
[01:56.960 --> 02:00.320]  just giving them by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told what to do so even
[02:00.320 --> 02:05.840]  the UN the global government system itself is just a puppet and what they
[02:05.840 --> 02:11.680]  say is God when they say it big tech says that's policy that's the end of it
[02:11.680 --> 02:14.720]  you're not allowed to go against that even if you're a medical doctor they
[02:14.720 --> 02:18.280]  say you don't need vitamin D then you can't say as a medical doctor you need
[02:18.280 --> 02:25.840]  vitamin D they say you don't need vitamin C the FBI will swat team you but
[02:25.840 --> 02:30.280]  now Fauci said you need to say oh wait okay we'll drop the charges Fauci's God
[02:30.280 --> 02:36.440]  so Fauci's God Bill Gates is God the UN's God none of us have any rights but
[02:36.440 --> 02:42.360]  now even the UN's head envoy for global COVID-19 response comes out cover it
[02:42.360 --> 02:47.320]  next segment it says we've got to stop this this is causing millions to die
[02:47.320 --> 02:51.640]  already hundreds of millions are gonna die well what do you think the plan is
[02:51.640 --> 02:55.320]  but see I don't want to judge this individual but he's up at this high
[02:55.320 --> 03:00.280]  level I looked at his pedigree it's pretty pretty globalist obviously but
[03:00.280 --> 03:04.520]  even some of these people get to a moment of truth and wake up finally but
[03:04.520 --> 03:10.720]  regardless the horse already left the barn cows already left the barn genies
[03:10.720 --> 03:15.520]  already have a bottle train already left the station and it's already gonna be
[03:15.520 --> 03:21.720]  devastating dead dead dead devastating to our economy it's gonna put millions
[03:21.720 --> 03:24.480]  people out of work it's gonna bankrupt tens of millions in the western world
[03:24.480 --> 03:28.680]  but the third world it's already a death sentence millions are already dead and I
[03:28.680 --> 03:32.880]  want the left and the Democrats and Fauci and Gates to know we know they're
[03:32.880 --> 03:41.040]  behind it so they can be discredited and exposed for the progenitors of the
[03:41.040 --> 03:45.800]  Nazis they're not sons of the Nazis they're not neo-nazis they're not Nazis
[03:45.800 --> 03:50.120]  they're the eugenics global scientific control freak cult that the Nazis were
[03:50.120 --> 03:54.280]  just a spin-off of but the Nazis wanted to make it based around Aryan white
[03:54.280 --> 03:59.600]  people the globalists want to kill everybody they don't like people that
[03:59.600 --> 04:03.840]  they see as elitist or high IQ so it's so it's even more aggressive than the
[04:03.840 --> 04:10.840]  Nazis if that's possible so truly sick true elitism we have this massive info
[04:10.840 --> 04:16.760]  we're gonna break it all down when we come back and then the election and then
[04:16.760 --> 04:22.240]  the ongoing COVID lockdowns and then Keith Oberman saying arrest Trump as a
[04:22.240 --> 04:26.720]  terrorist arrest all the supporters destroy us put us in gulags I mean you
[04:26.720 --> 04:31.160]  talk about a crazy and you've got the New York Times calling for the UN to take
[04:31.160 --> 04:35.160]  over the US more articles out on that and you've got a left-wing Antifa
[04:35.160 --> 04:39.880]  security guard shooting an unarmed man to death in Denver at a demonstration at a
[04:39.880 --> 04:43.920]  Patriot prayer group the media trying to cover that up and those guys are gonna
[04:43.920 --> 04:49.680]  kidnap the Michigan governor it's now confirmed they're all Antifa and BLM not
[04:49.680 --> 04:54.280]  just a few of them so they're a bunch of leftist libtard terrorists we'll be right
[04:54.280 --> 04:56.720]  back
[04:59.040 --> 05:04.440]  there are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States
[05:04.440 --> 05:09.060]  much less in the entire world info wars is stand alone with our own radio and
[05:09.060 --> 05:13.320]  TV satellite uplinks and hundreds of stations picking us up almost no one
[05:13.320 --> 05:17.680]  else has that especially anybody covering real issues of global
[05:17.680 --> 05:22.400]  populism the right to self-defense and exposing the anti-human globalist death
[05:22.400 --> 05:27.400]  agenda that's why when we go out and cheat videos they're at banned on video
[05:27.400 --> 05:33.040]  they're not allowed to be on Twitter on YouTube on Facebook that's why it's so
[05:33.040 --> 05:37.840]  precious because a censorship expands to everyone which it is now with AI
[05:37.840 --> 05:42.440]  monitoring controlling what you can say to do it's going to be the OACs like
[05:42.440 --> 05:46.480]  banned on video and the now redesigned info wars.com become more and more
[05:46.480 --> 05:51.720]  important which they are and the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying
[05:51.720 --> 05:56.200]  about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now because
[05:56.200 --> 06:20.200]  they're coming after everyone so spread the word now.
[06:20.200 --> 06:26.640]  22 days for the election, but that date is now not important because the
[06:26.640 --> 06:29.800]  Democrats that each state have set on record they're going to challenge the
[06:29.800 --> 06:37.560]  whole thing and so we are 100 days out after election day will be 79 days out
[06:37.560 --> 06:42.320]  the 79 days of hell the attempts to break up this country and bring us down
[06:42.320 --> 06:47.520]  and put us under world government it's all been announced more articles in the
[06:47.520 --> 06:52.000]  Boston Globe the LA Times you name it agreeing with the New York Times that
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.520]  the UN should come in oversee our elections that we should be put under
[06:55.520 --> 07:00.840]  world government it's simply amazing to be living during this time that's all
[07:00.840 --> 07:06.120]  coming up. Meanwhile this is not a joke the major
[07:06.120 --> 07:12.040]  Mathematic Association of the United States says two plus two is racist two
[07:12.040 --> 07:17.400]  plus two equals four is racist and the mathematics is white and bad and is not
[07:17.400 --> 07:22.720]  real so we've now officially I'm not joking entered 1984 where Winston's
[07:22.720 --> 07:26.640]  being tortured and he says the ability to say two plus two equals four is freedom
[07:26.640 --> 07:30.240]  by the end of it O'Brien tortures him so bad he believes it's whatever number
[07:30.240 --> 07:35.520]  O'Brien says math associations says math inherently carries human bias citing
[07:35.520 --> 07:42.400]  critical race theory. Also Gisling Maxwell as we find out attended
[07:42.400 --> 07:49.440]  anti-human trafficking summits well of course she did the head of the Amber
[07:49.440 --> 07:52.800]  Alert system that gives them the database was convicted of child
[07:52.800 --> 07:56.680]  trafficking and changed her name I mean who do you think these people are
[07:56.680 --> 08:02.800]  they're in command and there's no place you want to be when you're running this
[08:02.800 --> 08:08.280]  stuff better than in the position of tracking children and others that are
[08:08.280 --> 08:13.040]  missing that's all coming up and the left is so mad that Trump's got huge bust
[08:13.040 --> 08:18.480]  of child trafficking child rape child murder snuff films I've got a stack of
[08:18.480 --> 08:22.200]  news when they're just busting them all over the US all of the world and the
[08:22.200 --> 08:25.880]  desperate leftist media just gets more and more scared because their religion
[08:25.880 --> 08:30.840]  is pedophilia they take over every major institution not just the Catholic
[08:30.840 --> 08:35.520]  Church not just Penn State but we're learning everything that's all coming
[08:35.520 --> 08:41.360]  up as well and we also have a left-wing security guard charged with first
[08:41.360 --> 08:46.040]  degree murder in Denver shooting of Trump supporter the media tried to spin
[08:46.040 --> 08:49.680]  it first it was a right-winger killed somebody then they had to admit that it
[08:49.680 --> 08:54.320]  was an Antifa supporter who worked for local Channel 9 who bragged about how
[08:54.320 --> 08:58.760]  he was going to get right-wingers and he executed a guy shooting him in the head
[08:58.760 --> 09:05.360]  at point blank range so very powerful report at band.videoinfowords.com by
[09:05.360 --> 09:09.720]  John Baum execution by liberal media in Denver so so it's not just Antifa or
[09:09.720 --> 09:17.120]  BLM that stalks Patriot prayer group meetings in Portland or in Denver it's
[09:17.120 --> 09:25.120]  now Channel 9 they have a black lives matter provocateur with a shirt saying
[09:25.120 --> 09:31.880]  black guns matter screaming and starting a fight over and over again with a
[09:31.880 --> 09:36.200]  security guard and with somebody else and trying to start a fight and then
[09:36.200 --> 09:41.720]  finally he runs off and the security guard shoots the white guy dead in the
[09:41.720 --> 09:47.600]  head so that's all coming up I don't know we should show these videos we
[09:47.600 --> 09:52.200]  probably will they're all up on info wars.com they're up on news wars.com but
[09:52.200 --> 09:59.360]  yes later parental discretion advised we will show this on air but there you go
[09:59.360 --> 10:12.520]  this is what they've turned us into. Okay let me do this let me get to Keith
[10:12.520 --> 10:15.840]  Overman first and the climate the lefts put out and then all the different
[10:15.840 --> 10:21.000]  media outlets calling for a coup against President Trump and not just a coup but
[10:21.000 --> 10:24.880]  his supporters need to be destroyed and he'd be put in prisons as well that's
[10:24.880 --> 10:32.200]  censoring us off of the internet isn't enough now we need to be hunted down and
[10:32.200 --> 10:41.560]  we need to be we need to be killed absolutely dangerous and it just shows
[10:41.560 --> 10:46.520]  that these mental patients are pretending to be soldiers tend to be
[10:46.520 --> 10:51.200]  propagandists for some authoritarian system because they've never gotten in
[10:51.200 --> 10:58.160]  trouble for all of the crimes against the Republic that they have committed but
[10:58.160 --> 11:08.120]  here is what Keith Overman had to say. Trump can be and must be expunged the
[11:08.120 --> 11:12.920]  hate he has triggered the Pandora's box he has opened they will not be so easily
[11:12.920 --> 11:20.080]  destroyed so let us brace ourselves the task is two-fold the terrorist Trump
[11:20.080 --> 11:24.800]  must be defeated must be destroyed must be devoured at the ballot box and then
[11:24.800 --> 11:29.960]  he and his enablers and his supporters and his collaborators and the Mike
[11:29.960 --> 11:34.240]  Lee's and the William Barr's and the Sean Hannity's and the Mike Pence's and
[11:34.240 --> 11:38.600]  the Rudy Giuliani's and the Kyle Rittenhouse's and the Amy Coney Barrett's
[11:38.600 --> 11:44.120]  must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society while we tried
[11:44.120 --> 11:49.960]  to rebuild it and to rebuild the world Trump has nearly destroyed by turning it
[11:49.960 --> 11:56.560]  over to a virus remember it even as we dream of a return to reality and safety
[11:56.560 --> 12:01.000]  and the country for which our forefathers died that the fight is not just to
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.000]  win an election but to win it by enough to chase at least for a moment Trump and
[12:07.000 --> 12:13.480]  the maggots off the stage and then try to clean up what they left remember it
[12:13.480 --> 12:17.480]  even though to remember it means remembering that the fight does not end
[12:17.480 --> 12:25.520]  November 3rd but in many ways we'll only begin that day so once they win the
[12:25.520 --> 12:30.040]  election they think they're going to persecute us and put federal judges in
[12:30.040 --> 12:35.520]  prison and and attack us because we're bad this is what the universities have
[12:35.520 --> 12:42.400]  bred big money big banks the communist Chinese they want authoritarianism and
[12:42.400 --> 12:46.080]  the whole world is run by these big corporations now they look at American
[12:46.080 --> 12:49.680]  think well we've already owned their debt we already basically have control
[12:49.680 --> 12:57.160]  their country we control their media so we can certainly now wall sin and have
[12:57.160 --> 13:10.360]  people say to them we're gonna arrest you we're gonna dominate you we're gonna
[13:10.360 --> 13:17.440]  destroy you and that's just the way it is but what's frustrating about that is
[13:17.440 --> 13:21.360]  when you look at the left and the big corporations they work for they're
[13:21.360 --> 13:24.920]  posing as if they're these underdogs are posing as if they're these little
[13:24.920 --> 13:28.480]  nobodies with no power they've got the whole media behind them the big banks
[13:28.480 --> 13:31.600]  behind them all the big corporations behind them all these foreign
[13:31.600 --> 13:36.280]  authoritarian governments the communist Chinese the EU radical Islam behind them
[13:36.280 --> 13:40.560]  all this power that doesn't like the fact that America and still have a big
[13:40.560 --> 13:43.920]  middle class or that America is one of the few countries where we can own guns
[13:43.920 --> 13:49.000]  and defend ourselves and then meanwhile all of the big tech companies but
[13:49.000 --> 13:56.000]  particularly Apple and particularly Google are getting components from slave
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.960]  camps with Christians Buddhists and Muslims in them they keep them
[13:59.960 --> 14:03.920]  segregated three million Muslims a million Christians a million Buddhists
[14:03.920 --> 14:08.080]  they admit they harvest their organs they kill them for their religious
[14:08.080 --> 14:12.000]  beliefs and the left sits there and celebrates it and thinks it's funny and
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.320]  thinks it's cute and then tells us how President Trump who didn't want one-sided
[14:16.320 --> 14:21.560]  trade deals with the communist Chinese and who doesn't like the human rights
[14:21.560 --> 14:28.880]  abuses and who speaks out against it that he's the bad guy and they shake their
[14:28.880 --> 14:33.960]  fingers at us and tell us that we're Hitler when it's Trump trying to end the
[14:33.960 --> 14:38.480]  global lockdown and it's Trump trying to point out that COVID-19 is way overblown
[14:38.480 --> 14:42.720]  and kills less than the flu on average and they're counting flu deaths and
[14:42.720 --> 14:49.760]  pneumonia deaths in the COVID column and only super obese super sick people are
[14:49.760 --> 14:55.960]  dying from this and the idea that they can protect you from it is impossible
[14:55.960 --> 15:02.480]  the left isn't the left they're not liberals that they're just people that
[15:02.480 --> 15:08.920]  echo what these global corporate systems say so there's the big headline up on
[15:08.920 --> 15:15.240]  info wars.com global bombshell UN says COVID restrictions and lockdowns are
[15:15.240 --> 15:21.520]  killing millions must stop and I'll show you the evidence of that and the head
[15:21.520 --> 15:26.880]  UN envoy saying it when we come back this is really a big deal and national
[15:26.880 --> 15:29.560]  followed in a story about this as well this is breaking all over the place
[15:29.560 --> 15:36.520]  World Bank UN Harvard think tanks all warn COVID-19 lockdowns response
[15:36.520 --> 15:43.200]  leading to global starvation food disruptions 2 million already dead not
[15:43.200 --> 15:46.640]  even a million are dead from COVID worldwide but 2 million dead from the
[15:46.640 --> 15:50.520]  lockdowns and it's about the domino effect when the third world collapses
[15:50.520 --> 15:54.560]  they'll then flood us and the UN will control the crisis they created stay
[15:54.560 --> 15:56.880]  with us
[15:58.200 --> 16:04.080]  info wars is a archetypal classic example of free independent organic
[16:04.080 --> 16:09.560]  resistance against tyranny you built info wars you spread the word you prayed
[16:09.560 --> 16:14.600]  for us you bought the products you called in you made recommendations info
[16:14.600 --> 16:19.080]  wars is as much yours as it is mine and that's why the enemy is so upset that
[16:19.080 --> 16:23.480]  under the D platforming under all the DNC lawsuits under all the attack in many
[16:23.480 --> 16:28.040]  ways we become stronger with bandot video redesign info wars with all of our
[16:28.040 --> 16:35.160]  great crew with documentary films and ten hours of live radio and TV a day we
[16:35.160 --> 16:39.000]  are the resistance you are the resistance so remember this arsenal of
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.880]  freedom is waiting for you continue to spread the word about it and to continue
[16:43.880 --> 16:47.640]  for you to support because this is something we built together it's not
[16:47.640 --> 16:51.240]  just a national treasure it's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants and
[16:51.240 --> 16:54.360]  they know it and they can't stand it and as everything we talked about comes
[16:54.360 --> 16:59.200]  true our credibility only goes up together so I salute you all we're
[16:59.200 --> 17:04.320]  coming up in a few months on 14 years that my patriots supply has been our
[17:04.320 --> 17:08.240]  big food sponsor in the past I had a bunch of different sponsors they'd be
[17:08.240 --> 17:12.320]  good for a while then they'd become unreliable and I just operate off the
[17:12.320 --> 17:16.960]  listener reviews and what I personally buy what I like and they're the best for
[17:16.960 --> 17:22.600]  the price you pay no one can come even close the quality of this food a lot of
[17:22.600 --> 17:26.960]  it tastes or may the rest of it tastes you know pretty good okay that compared
[17:26.960 --> 17:30.680]  to competition stuff that costs the same amount it all tastes like crap so and
[17:30.680 --> 17:33.840]  that's what you see in the reviews that's what you see from the listeners
[17:33.840 --> 17:39.000]  now they can't go lower ever than the prices at informer store.com because of
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.520]  other distributors but they have decided this is very very rare to give us even
[17:43.520 --> 17:47.840]  better deal at preparewithalix.com where you can get $600 off your supply
[17:47.840 --> 17:52.440]  300 off six months 160 off three months at a bunch of other specials as well
[17:52.440 --> 17:58.200]  it's only for limited time it ends in three days at preparewithalix.com
[17:58.200 --> 18:02.720]  for more than a hundred years the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to
[18:02.720 --> 18:07.320]  establish world government abolish nation-states dumb down the population
[18:07.320 --> 18:11.120]  by taking control of education and most importantly taking control of Western
[18:11.120 --> 18:16.760]  medicine now they had a bad name by the 1920s they started converting over and
[18:16.760 --> 18:21.740]  funding other organizations and groups like IBM to continue on with their
[18:21.740 --> 18:28.080]  eugenics operations fast forward to the 1980s the baton is handed by IBM via his
[18:28.080 --> 18:32.640]  mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III his father of course being
[18:32.640 --> 18:36.800]  at a planned parenthood and now he's been able to position himself over almost
[18:36.800 --> 18:42.400]  every health department in the world every national health system Bill Gates
[18:42.400 --> 18:48.040]  is in control they have spent a hundred plus years getting positioned to be able
[18:48.040 --> 18:52.360]  to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body this is the
[18:52.360 --> 18:57.000]  holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type
[18:57.000 --> 19:03.000]  of DNA in your body the future isn't coming it's here and in the future
[19:03.000 --> 19:09.160]  keeping your humanity saving your soul your integrity your very essence is
[19:09.160 --> 19:13.520]  going to be your most valuable asset in fact it's going to be your only asset
[19:13.520 --> 19:18.320]  the world being built by the technocrats and the trap they've now sprung
[19:18.320 --> 19:23.480]  with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of
[19:23.480 --> 19:31.320]  taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization human life
[19:31.320 --> 19:36.920]  will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year
[19:36.920 --> 19:42.960]  2050 this is their stated goal I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things
[19:42.960 --> 19:47.800]  like this to you but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own
[19:47.800 --> 19:52.360]  decency onto the enemy we turn this around you must study their own writings
[19:52.360 --> 19:57.000]  you must face the facts and you must come to grips with it you're all being
[19:57.000 --> 20:05.720]  incrementally destroyed you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:19.760 --> 20:23.120]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen I'm your host Alex Jones and I have
[20:23.120 --> 20:30.360]  extremely good news for all of you but it's also very very complex news it's a
[20:30.360 --> 20:34.840]  window into the internal battles even going on inside the power structure
[20:34.840 --> 20:39.600]  right now between good and evil it was the UN in December of last year that a
[20:39.600 --> 20:47.280]  two-day emergency summit in an area of Europe where the United Nations likes
[20:47.280 --> 20:52.000]  to base a lot of its operations and where the WHO's headquarters is actually
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.800]  based in even Switzerland and they had a two-day conference and a few weeks later
[20:57.800 --> 21:02.240]  they released it and then listeners made us aware of it in late December we did a
[21:02.240 --> 21:07.000]  bunch of reports on it where the UN came out the head of the WHO vaccine program
[21:07.000 --> 21:11.400]  and said vaccines are actually harming people more than they're helping we're
[21:11.400 --> 21:16.520]  not allowed to even really test them we are simply told by big corporations what
[21:16.520 --> 21:22.360]  we are supposed to do well that's now happened again ladies and gentlemen
[21:22.360 --> 21:31.760]  that's now happened again and we have the head of the United Nations envoy from
[21:31.760 --> 21:40.320]  the global COVID-19 response coming out and saying to the world ladies and
[21:40.320 --> 21:54.560]  gentlemen that COVID-19 response is killing more people than it's saving
[21:54.560 --> 21:58.880]  which is what it's designed to do it's the UN that ran the response it's the UN
[21:58.880 --> 22:04.080]  we're told is the boss it's the WHO that's in control of all of this so look
[22:04.080 --> 22:10.000]  at this national file article it has links to the video World Bank UN Harvard
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.560]  think tank warn COVID-19 lockdowns response leading to global starvation
[22:14.560 --> 22:26.280]  food disruptions and then it goes on from there we have the live show feed right
[22:26.280 --> 22:30.840]  here global bombshell UN says COVID restrictions and lockdowns are killing
[22:30.840 --> 22:37.000]  millions must stop this is such a big deal now let's get into who's actually
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.520]  saying it here's the Gateway Pundit article someone tell the radical
[22:41.520 --> 22:47.720]  Democrats WHO backflips on lockdowns after global economy decimated and
[22:47.720 --> 22:56.640]  world's poor starving World Health Organization is often praised by
[22:56.640 --> 23:01.360]  left wing radicals and crazy dr. Fauci World Health Organization in pro-china
[23:01.360 --> 23:06.080]  outfit famously created a global panic by announcing the coronavirus had a
[23:06.080 --> 23:11.800]  mortality rate of 3.4% when it was hundreds of times lower World Health
[23:11.800 --> 23:15.360]  Organization recently back flipped on a terrific miscalculation and now amidst
[23:15.360 --> 23:20.320]  the more tally rate the coronavirus is slightly higher than the seasonal flu
[23:20.320 --> 23:24.840]  which is really lower than in this past week after a global economy was
[23:24.840 --> 23:30.200]  decimated the World Health Organization back flipped again and admitted the
[23:30.200 --> 23:36.040]  lockdowns are a horrible idea now here's who actually said it I went and found
[23:36.040 --> 23:38.680]  his actual statements I didn't just believe Gateway Pundit who's a great
[23:38.680 --> 23:44.640]  source I went and got it lockdowns are not the answer to stopping COVID-19
[23:44.640 --> 23:49.440]  yesterday dr. David the borough from the World Health Organization told world
[23:49.440 --> 23:52.880]  leaders to stop using lockdowns as a primary method to control the spread
[23:52.880 --> 23:58.240]  of the virus and they go on to say that it's causing a breakdown and collapse
[23:58.240 --> 24:03.320]  of civilization and that using it as your primary control method is not good
[24:03.320 --> 24:08.960]  and it should stop lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never ever
[24:08.960 --> 24:14.320]  belittle and that is making poor people an awful lot poor he said and then they
[24:14.320 --> 24:21.960]  starved to death okay so even people in the UN are coming out and saying this is
[24:21.960 --> 24:25.880]  wrong but of course those that control the UN above it Bill Gates the big
[24:25.880 --> 24:30.080]  robber Baron Foundation the Rockefellers that created the United Nations they
[24:30.080 --> 24:37.280]  know exactly what they are doing they create the global crisis they bring in
[24:37.280 --> 24:40.400]  the casual society they bring in the surveillance system they create a phobia
[24:40.400 --> 24:45.520]  of common colds in the flu they bring in a work from home system to make humans
[24:45.520 --> 24:51.680]  obsolete to teach you that you're non-essential they are then able to roll
[24:51.680 --> 24:58.720]  out their entire cashless society and it goes on and on from there then once the
[24:58.720 --> 25:03.720]  third world starts collapsing because the supply chain break down the first
[25:03.720 --> 25:06.960]  world goes into deep debt the third world starts starving to death they will
[25:06.960 --> 25:10.880]  then flood their borders to the west and the UN will then organize them as a
[25:10.880 --> 25:17.120]  political weapons system to override and swamp the first world and then the UN
[25:17.120 --> 25:20.720]  controls everyone through debt through poverty and through medical
[25:20.720 --> 25:27.160]  tyranny and the AI surveillance crits that is the admitted plan and it's now
[25:27.160 --> 25:35.400]  come out that that is the admitted plan and so we have the battle plan of this
[25:35.400 --> 25:41.480]  entire system now in our hands and we even have the UN head of the WHO vaccine
[25:41.480 --> 25:46.120]  program saying we don't do testing it's hurting people the doctors don't think
[25:46.120 --> 25:49.720]  it's good vaccines are killing people they're maiming them the cover-up can't
[25:49.720 --> 26:01.400]  continue that's December 2nd 2019 only 10 11 months ago and now you've got this
[26:01.400 --> 26:10.200]  with the UN head envoy over COVID-19 response coming out and saying that this
[26:10.200 --> 26:14.040]  is killing way more than it's helping it's destroying infrastructure it's
[26:14.040 --> 26:18.720]  destroying economies it's causing mass starvation it's destroying poor people
[26:18.720 --> 26:29.120]  and it's got to stop you can't kill a million people to save 5,000 but again
[26:29.120 --> 26:32.840]  wearing the mask having lockdowns it doesn't protect you anyways the study
[26:32.840 --> 26:38.840]  show it makes it worse but it was all cooked up to create phobias of going
[26:38.840 --> 26:43.320]  outside so we can all be locked up in our houses and be under rolling martial law
[26:43.320 --> 26:50.280]  and rolling house arrest and that's all any of this has ever been there's another
[26:50.280 --> 26:55.200]  article World Bank COVID-19 lockdowns will push as many as 150 million people
[26:55.200 --> 27:00.440]  to extreme poverty by 2021 the UN goes on to say 280 million people are on the
[27:00.440 --> 27:06.240]  edge of starvation it was 135 million two million have already starved to death
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.480]  the full video is it banned out video and inside these articles learn how the
[27:11.480 --> 27:17.720]  great COVID-19 pandemic of 9-11 starved millions to death again learn how the
[27:17.720 --> 27:23.440]  great COVID-19 panic of 9
[27:25.960 --> 27:32.200]  I understand that headline right there I wrote that over the phone earlier today
[27:32.840 --> 27:38.600]  learn how the great COVID-19 panic of 9-11
[27:38.600 --> 27:48.120]  2020 that's bizarre anyways we'll work on that we're live on air here we'll figure
[27:48.120 --> 27:51.280]  it all out I'm the one right most of some the one doing most of it I guess I
[27:51.280 --> 27:54.560]  must have put a wrong thing in there I'm so crazy working so much doing all this
[27:54.560 --> 27:58.440]  all the time I'll tell you I'm pretty much punch drunk right now I mean you
[27:58.440 --> 28:00.840]  know this is just getting more and more insane by the minute I'll just keep
[28:00.840 --> 28:05.920]  fighting as hard as I can WHO director general special envoys on COVID-19
[28:05.920 --> 28:12.600]  preparedness and response that's David Nabarro that came out and said all of
[28:12.600 --> 28:17.200]  this when we come back I'm gonna go over this in more detail and lay it all out
[28:17.200 --> 28:22.480]  for you because it's beyond critical but you go out you talk to your average
[28:22.480 --> 28:26.320]  leftist out there they laugh at you they think it's funny they think it's a
[28:26.320 --> 28:32.080]  giant sickening joke and they totally absolutely flip you off and enjoy it you
[28:32.080 --> 28:35.920]  go hey the UN is starving everybody to death this is killing hundreds of times
[28:35.920 --> 28:40.480]  what COVID does please and they just go f you all it shows f you Nazi and it's
[28:40.480 --> 28:44.160]  literally killing brown people mainly it's it's totally sick it's totally evil
[28:44.160 --> 28:48.000]  and the chickens will come home to roost with us I've got so much more to
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.000]  cover on the other side of this quick break please stay with us
[28:53.000 --> 29:03.440]  there has never in my 20s fears on air that a more critical or important time
[29:03.440 --> 29:07.520]  to be self-sufficient and listen I don't sell firearms I don't sell ammunition
[29:07.520 --> 29:11.480]  that is one of the most important things you can have along with a good
[29:11.480 --> 29:15.480]  relationship with God during times like this but what I can't help you with is
[29:15.480 --> 29:20.520]  high-quality storeable food high-quality water filtration all at one place now
[29:20.520 --> 29:24.840]  you always get the very best deals from my patriot them for store.com we are
[29:24.840 --> 29:28.760]  their biggest distributor but because of how crazy things are they have agreed to
[29:28.760 --> 29:32.560]  give us a deal no one else has been able to get so this is the lowest price on
[29:32.560 --> 29:36.080]  the lowest price highest quality storeable food you're gonna find at
[29:36.080 --> 29:42.680]  preparewithalix.com now they've set it out just three days this upcoming Monday
[29:42.680 --> 29:46.880]  for only 27 days after the election and it's about a week or so they'll be able
[29:46.880 --> 29:51.040]  to ship it to you they've got the food on hand but they cannot guarantee this one
[29:51.040 --> 29:55.120]  week ship rate in the next month or so things are so crazy and food prices are
[29:55.120 --> 30:02.120]  going up so take action now. The Bible talks about there being 10 kings of the
[30:02.120 --> 30:06.680]  earth that sit above the nation states and who give their power unto the one
[30:06.680 --> 30:11.840]  world leader the Antichrist and that he has a beast system that no one can buy
[30:11.840 --> 30:16.000]  and or sell unless he has that marked in the forehead or in the palm of their hand
[30:16.000 --> 30:22.320]  and we look back all the warnings you were given and all just common sense that
[30:22.320 --> 30:26.800]  you don't believe in God or prophecy giving governments corporations the
[30:26.800 --> 30:31.960]  power to control who can buy and who can sell to track everything we do he's not
[30:31.960 --> 30:36.400]  just a recipe it's a blueprint for total enslaved but now you look at Bill Gates
[30:36.400 --> 30:41.280]  you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats we should
[30:41.280 --> 30:45.280]  decide how much salt you get how much alcohol you get how much red meat you
[30:45.280 --> 30:49.560]  get we're technocrats we know best we're now going to set up the economy with a
[30:49.560 --> 30:54.160]  social score to totally control you you snap your fingers we're here they're
[30:54.160 --> 31:00.000]  just rolling it out and a lot of people are complying with it it's insane 20 20
[31:00.000 --> 31:04.480]  election center calm just type it in one time you've got to save right there in

[31:31.200 --> 31:35.200]  power of the people overrode them four years ago Trump has finally figured this
[31:35.200 --> 31:39.160]  out since he's gonna take action once reelected against big tech I mean he's
[31:39.160 --> 31:42.080]  modern the situation well we know the president's overwhelmed right now so
[31:42.080 --> 31:45.720]  we're gonna sit here and cry because he has taken action we the people are
[31:45.720 --> 31:50.000]  taking action now you can do it very very easily by sharing 2020electioncenter.com

[32:12.800 --> 32:19.160]  orders from Bill Gates Dr. Bill Gates I mean he's not a doctor but he controls
[32:19.160 --> 32:26.040]  everything you do and he now says you're going to take the shots and of course in
[32:26.040 --> 32:30.800]  England they are now saying what I told you you will not be allowed to travel

[32:44.240 --> 32:51.600]  adult two for baby here baby me much more manageable just like Bill Gates give
[32:51.600 --> 33:02.280]  you polio and vaccine I'm Dr. Fauci reminding you that we owe you you're
[33:02.280 --> 33:06.760]  listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:06.760 --> 33:23.320]  on a warm summer's Eve on a train bound for nowhere I met up with the camera we
[33:23.320 --> 33:29.840]  were both too tired to sleep so we took turns a-staring out the window at the
[33:29.840 --> 33:37.720]  darkness to boredom overtook us and he began to speak he said son I've made a
[33:37.720 --> 33:42.080]  life all right folks we are back live I'm your host Alex Jones what I'm gonna do
[33:42.080 --> 33:49.560]  is next hour I'm gonna get back into the just huge news that the UN admits the
[33:49.560 --> 33:53.320]  lockdown has already killed millions it's gonna kill tens of millions more and
[33:53.320 --> 33:59.680]  needs to stop that's the head-on boy over the COVID operations from the UN to
[33:59.680 --> 34:03.320]  the nation states now they're coming their ass for the global depression they
[34:03.320 --> 34:10.360]  started and then the mass death probably but regardless it indicates what we
[34:10.360 --> 34:15.400]  already knew we've got the footage of myself and Owen shroyer going downtown
[34:15.400 --> 34:21.120]  and having about half the people flip us off and say burn in hell when we put it
[34:21.120 --> 34:24.960]  out the COVID lockdowns are killing the third world the other half of folks
[34:24.960 --> 34:28.600]  cheered us on and said you're right and there was a big rally also that we
[34:28.600 --> 34:33.640]  attended downtown to end the lockdown that video is all a band on video that's
[34:33.640 --> 34:38.100]  coming up but let's talk about let's talk about the civil war that the deep
[34:38.100 --> 34:44.320]  state and others are trying to trigger in this country when one of the patriot
[34:44.320 --> 34:51.440]  prayer group folks a month ago got executed in Portland Oregon the media
[34:51.440 --> 34:55.760]  tried to cover that up and when a man yesterday got executed at another
[34:55.760 --> 35:00.600]  patriot prayer group free speech rally in Denver the media tried to spin it
[35:00.600 --> 35:06.080]  again they also tried to say the people that tried to kidnap the governor
[35:06.080 --> 35:09.880]  Whitmer who the Supreme Court had just ruled is a tyrant she had to end her
[35:09.880 --> 35:14.120]  lockdown measures she doesn't care just she's not stopping well as soon as she
[35:14.120 --> 35:17.440]  got in trouble and as soon as it came out that she was a dictator basically what
[35:17.440 --> 35:20.680]  she was doing was illegal oh they learned about 13 people that were trying to
[35:20.680 --> 35:26.940]  kill her we're trying to kidnap her they were talking about both reportedly we
[35:26.940 --> 35:31.000]  learned their black lives matter and Antifa could have known that from their
[35:31.000 --> 35:36.840]  videos with that type of paraphernalia on their walls but that's now come out
[35:36.840 --> 35:40.480]  that they attended black lives matter events and were anarchist and were
[35:40.480 --> 35:44.800]  attached to Antifa but the mainstream media is trying and fighting to cover
[35:44.800 --> 35:50.120]  that up meanwhile left-wing security guard charged with first-degree murder in
[35:50.120 --> 35:55.600]  Denver shooting of Trump's supporter you've got his name all the details up
[35:55.600 --> 36:02.680]  on info wars dot com identified as Matthew dole off a big leftist who
[36:02.680 --> 36:07.400]  bragged about how he was gonna deal with Trump supporters the Trump supporter
[36:07.400 --> 36:11.920]  shot by leftist local news bodyguard in Denver has been identified that's right
[36:11.920 --> 36:16.880]  he was a bodyguard for Channel 9 news who executed this guy the Trump
[36:16.880 --> 36:21.120]  supporters was shot by local news bodyguard in Denver on Saturday has
[36:21.120 --> 36:29.040]  been identified as veteran and cowboy hat designer Lee Kletner so we're gonna
[36:29.040 --> 36:33.680]  be covering more of that here's a screenshot Denver local news bodyguard
[36:33.680 --> 36:36.400]  who killed Trump supporter bragged about harassing and confronting
[36:36.400 --> 36:43.160]  conservatives in the past now he executed one in broad daylight after the
[36:43.160 --> 36:48.040]  Patriot got attacked shot some of his bear spray when he was punched in the
[36:48.040 --> 36:57.480]  face so he was executed let's go ahead and roll John bounds report dealing with
[36:57.480 --> 37:03.760]  this it's very powerful the media now is executing American citizens and then
[37:03.760 --> 37:07.320]  we're gonna come back and play the raw footage of the execution on the other
[37:07.320 --> 37:12.760]  side but here is the John bound report all the left needs is a Hitler Mussolini
[37:12.760 --> 37:17.680]  Pol Pot chairman Mao style leader to rally them to a full-blown revolutionary
[37:17.680 --> 37:23.200]  violent overthrow of the United States that voice will likely arise from the
[37:23.200 --> 37:28.560]  crumbling ESPN ranks that psychopaths like Keith Overman graduate from
[37:28.560 --> 37:32.800]  jockeying for position with their political theater the terrorist Trump
[37:32.800 --> 37:37.560]  must be defeated must be destroyed must be devoured at the ballot box and then
[37:37.560 --> 37:42.520]  he and his enablers and his supporters and his collaborators and the
[37:42.520 --> 37:47.000]  Mike Lee's and the William bars and the Sean Hannity's and the Mike Pence's and
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.360]  the Rudy Giuliani's and the Kyle written houses and the Amy Coney Barrett's
[37:51.360 --> 37:56.880]  must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society while we try
[37:56.880 --> 38:02.200]  to rebuild it spewing totalitarian nonsense that sounds vaguely familiar
[38:02.200 --> 38:06.840]  Adolf Hitler's first written comments calling for the annihilation of Jews and
[38:06.840 --> 38:13.400]  it's signed by Hitler himself the letter was penned decades before the
[38:13.400 --> 38:19.000]  Holocaust in 1919 when Hitler was a German soldier but it reveals his early
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.600]  hatred of Jewish people in one section he writes that Jews should be denied
[38:23.600 --> 38:28.480]  rights with the final aim being the uncompromising removal of Jews all
[38:28.480 --> 38:32.760]  together and the Kyle written houses and the Amy Coney Barrett's must be
[38:32.760 --> 38:38.480]  prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society while we try to rebuild
[38:38.480 --> 38:43.560]  it the fight is not just to win an election but to win it by enough to
[38:43.560 --> 38:49.760]  chase at least for a moment Trump and the maggots off the stage is purely
[38:49.760 --> 38:54.480]  un-American hysterical disinformation that continues to fuel what
[38:54.480 --> 38:59.760]  transpired at a Denver Colorado Communist soup drive for the homeless a
[38:59.760 --> 39:04.000]  drive that should have been appropriately titled a hurl soup cans at
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.440]  concerned Americans and defunded police event
[39:08.440 --> 39:12.520]  a lot of those guys were from UAGS, the United American Defense Force, the other side
[39:12.520 --> 39:16.200]  the Communist Party started attacking the cops probably within what 20 minutes
[39:16.200 --> 39:19.880]  yeah 20 minutes the sites off the soup cans I was up there speaking
[39:19.880 --> 39:23.960]  soup cans were flying at the cops again they said they're doing a soup drive for the homeless
[39:23.960 --> 39:31.720]  and as a BLM mental patient hurled threats and insults at patriots
[39:42.840 --> 39:48.040]  and as a patriot appeared to defend himself with pepper spray after the gun
[39:48.040 --> 39:52.520]  had been drawn that patriot was shot point blank in the head the BLM
[39:52.520 --> 39:57.200]  instigator celebrated as he left the scene only to be detained shortly
[39:57.200 --> 40:05.480]  thereafter the instigator had deceptively been wearing a black guns
[40:05.480 --> 40:10.640]  matter shirt and appears to be the same agitator from a Bernie Sanders rally
[40:10.640 --> 40:16.520]  surprisingly the shot was not fired by a left-wing radical and Tifa BLM supporter
[40:16.520 --> 40:21.920]  a patriot was reportedly murdered in cold blood by the bodyguard of a Denver
[40:21.920 --> 40:27.240]  9 news producer just so we're clear on this America patriotic Americans aren't
[40:27.240 --> 40:31.440]  merely being shot in cold blood by Marxist that are supported by the
[40:31.440 --> 40:35.160]  Democratic Party and the Democratic candidates running for the highest
[40:35.160 --> 40:39.280]  office in the land and Tifa's an idea not an organization you got it but
[40:39.280 --> 40:44.480]  you're not gonna stop and and everyone beware because they're not gonna stop
[40:44.480 --> 40:47.640]  it is gonna they're not gonna stop before election day in November and
[40:47.640 --> 40:51.360]  they're not gonna stop after election day and that should be everyone should
[40:51.360 --> 40:55.440]  take note of that on both levels that this isn't they're not gonna let up and
[40:55.440 --> 41:00.520]  they should not and we should not the liberal 9 news Denver media has now
[41:00.520 --> 41:04.840]  become the center of an investigation where the life of an American citizen
[41:04.840 --> 41:10.800]  was snuffed out in broad daylight by the tyranny of a mockingbird media goon on
[41:10.800 --> 41:15.080]  the other side the Denver Communist Party along with self-described Black
[41:15.080 --> 41:20.440]  Lives Matter and Antifa they call it a patriot muster but that's you know they
[41:20.440 --> 41:24.960]  used patriot instead of saying racist or a patriot instead of saying
[41:24.960 --> 41:29.360]  nationalist so you know we see through that the security guard contracted by
[41:29.360 --> 41:33.720]  9 news through the company Pinkerton got into an altercation with another man
[41:33.720 --> 41:40.160]  there was a verbal altercation that transpired firearm was discharged
[41:40.160 --> 41:45.960]  individual was shot and later pronounced deceased it has been a practice by 9
[41:45.960 --> 41:49.800]  news to hire private security guards as our crews have been covering protests
[41:49.800 --> 41:53.440]  over the last several months in Denver Denver police saying no one else was
[41:53.440 --> 41:57.720]  arrested at the rallies the bodies of people groups of people who nobody
[41:57.720 --> 42:04.400]  elected never as a matter of fact most of the people don't like them at all and
[42:04.400 --> 42:13.120]  yet they exist one of such group is media who elected them how come how come
[42:13.120 --> 42:19.040]  they they face they have so much power almost monopolistic power on your mind
[42:19.040 --> 42:24.960]  they can break your mind but who elected them how come they are they have a nerve
[42:24.960 --> 42:30.440]  to decide what is good and what is bad for for the elected by you president and
[42:30.440 --> 42:37.360]  his administration who the hell are they John Baum reporting that report is
[42:37.360 --> 42:42.200]  extremely powerful it's on band.videoinfowar.com I suggest you share it
[42:42.200 --> 42:45.880]  execution by liberal media in Denver now the leftist media is actually
[42:45.880 --> 42:51.120]  executing patriots of the street beyond antifa they are at war with us we're
[42:51.120 --> 42:55.000]  gonna come back into all the big campaign news and China's ready to attack
[42:55.000 --> 43:01.440]  United States tall coming up there are almost no free independent media
[43:01.440 --> 43:05.680]  infrastructures in the United States much less in the entire world in full
[43:05.680 --> 43:09.760]  wars to stand alone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks and hundreds
[43:09.760 --> 43:14.120]  of stations picking us up almost no one else has that especially anybody
[43:14.120 --> 43:19.080]  covering real issues of global populism the right to self-defense and
[43:19.080 --> 43:24.360]  exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda that's why when we go out and
[43:24.360 --> 43:29.080]  shoot videos they're at band.video they're not allowed to be on Twitter on
[43:29.080 --> 43:34.440]  YouTube on Facebook that's why it's so precious because a censorship expands to
[43:34.440 --> 43:38.600]  everyone which it is now with AI monitoring controlling what you can
[43:38.600 --> 43:43.320]  say and do it's gonna be the LACs like band.video and the now redesigned

[48:07.080 --> 48:10.400]  got incredible stuff with the campaign I can fill the two hours very easily you've
[48:10.400 --> 48:16.600]  got two hours coming up we call Sunday night live with Owen shroyer only six
[48:16.600 --> 48:20.280]  minutes ads an hour for local stations so that's that's coming up I'm sure
[48:20.280 --> 48:23.760]  whatever I don't get to he'll get to and more but and you got Biden up there
[48:23.760 --> 48:28.840]  saying just incredible stuff I mean you thought it was crazy he said 200 million
[48:28.840 --> 48:35.520]  Americans died of COVID wait till you hear what he said next but video tells
[48:35.520 --> 48:42.160]  a billion words this is a video up on info wars.com Biden Harris kickoff
[48:42.160 --> 48:50.200]  buster in Arizona not a single person shows up and this happens everywhere they
[48:50.200 --> 48:55.080]  go and then Trump shows campaign videos showing no one's there and Facebook
[48:55.080 --> 49:00.800]  bans them saying they're misleading we've sent people out to cover Democrat
[49:00.800 --> 49:09.040]  events with Joe Biden no one's there we're talking 50 people in San Antonio so
[49:09.040 --> 49:12.160]  when he takes questions one of our listeners gets the first one in then
[49:12.160 --> 49:16.520]  the fourth questions one of our people I mean he's a joke that's why he's hiding
[49:16.520 --> 49:20.920]  and not campaigning because no one is showing up which is indicative of what
[49:20.920 --> 49:25.480]  a paper tiger and what a fraud this is so here's part of the Fox News piece out
[49:25.480 --> 49:31.560]  of Arizona. Not much to see I'll step out of the way but it's kind of boring
[49:31.560 --> 49:35.880]  out here so it's not your typical campaign presidential campaign event we
[49:35.880 --> 49:41.320]  don't see people rallying outside we don't see signs or really much of what's
[49:41.320 --> 49:46.360]  going on and I'm told by one of the Biden staffers local staffers is that
[49:46.360 --> 49:52.440]  they kind of kept the details about the visit as far as the timing and the exact
[49:52.440 --> 49:58.000]  locations and pretty much all the people that we saw enter into the parking lot
[49:58.000 --> 50:05.480]  about 45 minutes ago were with the Biden-Harris campaign and the pool
[50:05.480 --> 50:11.840]  reporters so you would expect to see I mean this is a pretty big event for the
[50:11.840 --> 50:15.680]  two of them to be campaigning together for the first time since the Democratic
[50:15.680 --> 50:20.080]  National Convention here in Arizona we've established our state has
[50:20.080 --> 50:24.600]  established itself as a battleground state and so this is technically a big
[50:24.600 --> 50:29.040]  event but not a lot of fanfare so we're getting information about what's going
[50:29.040 --> 50:34.080]  on with okay so that's enough for full videos on info wars.com I suggest you
[50:34.080 --> 50:37.920]  share the article okay if you want to expose them because here's the deal you
[50:37.920 --> 50:44.160]  think oh we'll beat them easily oh no oh no because they're going to contest the
[50:44.160 --> 50:47.280]  election and they're gonna call the United Nations in they're gonna have all
[50:47.280 --> 50:55.680]  the blue state governors secede according to John Podesta look at these
[50:55.680 --> 51:01.720]  headlines fake poll alert proof Biden's not winning town hall breaks it all down
[51:01.720 --> 51:05.000]  how Trump's really winning with the real poll numbers sure just like four years
[51:05.000 --> 51:14.040]  ago powered by trust ABC News oh yes powered by trust ABC News ought to
[51:14.040 --> 51:19.400]  change their slogan to that powered by trust of the pandemic Biden leads by
[51:19.400 --> 51:27.200]  12 points really Hillary was leading by like 35 points Taliban sland CBS fake
[51:27.200 --> 51:33.560]  news refutes claim they endorsed Trump just made up Biden says chicanery at
[51:33.560 --> 51:40.200]  polls is the only way he could lose the US election Joe Biden there's a video
[51:40.200 --> 51:45.180]  that cue it up babbling about Supreme Court proves he knows nothing about the
[51:45.180 --> 51:49.600]  Constitution he says that Trump's patching the court and it's unconstitutional
[51:49.600 --> 51:56.880]  no the Democrats adding four more justices to 13 or I guess like Venezuela
[51:56.880 --> 52:01.600]  like packed record like 40 something people I still my check that's how
[52:01.600 --> 52:25.680]  communists do it yes to go ahead and roll Biden lying here it is
[52:25.680 --> 52:30.000]  stop it again why am I covering the fact that they have a transcript you can
[52:30.000 --> 52:33.080]  barely understand of him saying it's unconstitutional trust packing the court
[52:33.080 --> 52:37.240]  right now which isn't true he's literally has to virtue signal on a tarmac in
[52:37.240 --> 52:41.480]  the sunshine with high wind if you had a deadly disease you couldn't get it much
[52:41.480 --> 52:46.400]  less COVID it's like a common cold just Bill Gates patented and owns it with
[52:46.400 --> 52:51.720]  Fauci literally look it up at Wuhan even Newsweek reported on that so so I love
[52:51.720 --> 53:06.960]  I mean it's all a clown show this is the traders the chai comms and the
[53:06.960 --> 53:23.040]  globalist guy sorry started over let's just see if we understand any of it
[53:36.960 --> 53:54.640]  I mean this is clown world but it's like oh he's winning because he wears the
[53:54.640 --> 53:59.040]  mask he's a hero he's a subservient idiot of the chai comms that with Bill Gates
[53:59.040 --> 54:02.840]  started hysteria exaggerated the death toll a hundred fold and then did all
[54:02.840 --> 54:11.280]  this meanwhile even Jake Tapper shreds the Biden campaign saying the no it's not
[54:11.280 --> 54:14.760]  unconstitutional for them to do what they're doing all right now let's talk
[54:14.760 --> 54:19.080]  about what's really going on right now ladies and gentlemen let's talk about
[54:19.080 --> 54:24.320]  what's really going on right here with a delicious overhead shot right here
[54:24.320 --> 54:34.240]  because that's what's really unfolding get ready to resist the Trump who get
[54:34.240 --> 54:43.560]  ready to resist the Trump coup attempt that's the star tribune how we should
[54:43.560 --> 54:52.760]  defend against an impending Trump coup attempt common dreams the Trump campaign
[54:52.760 --> 54:59.520]  is reportedly plotting an election coup to bypass the Biden win vanity fair ten
[54:59.520 --> 55:07.640]  things you know to stop a coup there's one of the New York Times there will be
[55:07.640 --> 55:12.080]  no Trump coup and they're going to say we have the military everybody we're
[55:12.080 --> 55:17.320]  gonna remove him so they admit a coup in this article meanwhile they attacked
[55:17.320 --> 55:21.400]  Stuart Rhodes for in September 30 is saying there's a coup plot against the
[55:21.400 --> 55:28.600]  president and in Atlantic Monthly meanwhile Wall Street Journal actually
[55:28.600 --> 55:33.520]  wrote a big in-depth report called an American coup attempt and shows where
[55:33.520 --> 55:37.240]  they ran the attempted coup during the campaign when he was president-elect
[55:37.240 --> 55:42.320]  after and ever since then it actually gives real concrete examples of them
[55:42.320 --> 55:47.320]  trying the coup calling it a coup on TV to give confidence to the coup
[55:47.320 --> 55:53.880]  supporters and then of course you've got we'll play the clip in a moment of good
[55:53.880 --> 56:03.320]  old sports commentator they brought back out of retirement Keith Oberman to say
[56:03.320 --> 56:08.760]  that all of Trump supporters seem to be rounded up as well so they're saying
[56:08.760 --> 56:13.240]  we've got a coup plot but they can't get anybody at their rallies nobody shows up
[56:13.240 --> 56:17.200]  they're mailing all these fake ballots to screw the election up so they can just
[56:17.200 --> 56:21.040]  dispute it they know they're losers these are the traders that sold out to
[56:21.040 --> 56:25.720]  foreign powers these are the enemy so he says we're the enemy my god we've got
[56:25.720 --> 56:32.200]  channel nine gunning an unarmed man down in Denver for Antifa charged with
[56:32.200 --> 56:39.880]  murder today we got Antifa BLM in the media killing us we got Keith
[56:39.880 --> 56:43.520]  Oberman saying they're gonna wipe us out and then wondering why people go out
[56:43.520 --> 56:49.800]  and do it here's what Keith Oberman had to say Trump can be and must be
[56:49.800 --> 56:55.680]  expunged the hate he has triggered the Pandora's box he has opened they will
[56:55.680 --> 57:02.840]  not be so easily destroyed so let us brace ourselves the task is twofold the
[57:02.840 --> 57:07.320]  terrorist Trump must be defeated must be destroyed must be devoured at the
[57:07.320 --> 57:11.800]  ballot box and then he and his enablers and his supporters and his
[57:11.800 --> 57:16.600]  collaborators and the Mike Lee's and the William Barr's and the Sean Hannity's
[57:16.600 --> 57:20.520]  and the Mike Pence's and the Rudy Giuliani's and the Kyle Rittenhouse's and
[57:20.520 --> 57:25.600]  the Amy Coney Barrett's must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from
[57:25.600 --> 57:31.360]  our society while we try to rebuild it and to hear that we need to be
[57:31.360 --> 57:36.080]  convicted and they've got grand juries open on everybody thousands of Trump
[57:36.080 --> 57:42.560]  supporters they've got them open literally just salivating for the for

[59:50.200 --> 1:00:05.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show just another day in 2020 a police
[1:00:05.520 --> 1:00:10.080]  shooting decision puts an American community on edge yet again this time
[1:00:10.080 --> 1:00:15.640]  over the shooting death of 17 year old Alvin Cole by Wauwatosa police officer
[1:00:15.640 --> 1:00:20.200]  Joseph Mensa back in February details of the incident became available
[1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:24.760]  officers spotted Cole another man and a woman leaving the parking garage south
[1:00:24.760 --> 1:00:29.120]  of the Nordstrom store at the local mall
[1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:41.000]  police detained the man with him but Cole kept running he was pursued by
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:45.960]  three officers including Mensa and a mall security guard a shot was discharged
[1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:50.440]  from Cole's vicinity and Cole went to the ground with a firearm in his right
[1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:53.040]  hand
[1:00:53.040 --> 1:01:14.640]  all three officers said Cole was ordered to surrender the firearm but he
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:19.280]  instead pointed it in their direction Mensa fired five rounds killing Cole
[1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:24.280]  Cole was too young to legally own a firearm plus juvenile felony convictions
[1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:28.240]  barred him from legally possessing a gun the report went on to say the
[1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:32.000]  consequences for illegal gun possession are significant and may have
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:36.520]  contributed to mr. Cole's flight from police according to the Milwaukee
[1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:41.240]  Journal of Sentinel this was the third shooting death by Mensa while in the line
[1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:46.240]  of duty in the last five years Mensa also shot and killed Antonio Gonzalez in
[1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:52.320]  2015 and J. Anderson Jr. in 2016 Gonzalez went into a suicidal death by
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:57.880]  cop rage reportedly brandishing kitchen knives and a sword and Anderson Jr. was
[1:01:57.880 --> 1:02:02.640]  shot six times while sitting in his car whether or not Anderson lunged for a
[1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:07.360]  weapon is debatable well police say a group of protesters showed up outside of
[1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:12.120]  a home where Joseph Mensa was staying and things quickly escalated from there
[1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:16.400]  police say a group of about 60 people gathered around the home near a hundredth
[1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:20.880]  and Vienna Street and vandalized it they say as Mensa tried to talk with the
[1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:25.440]  crowd that's when he was physically assaulted and shot was fired at the
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:30.560]  back door but of course this case strays from the Derek Chauvin George Floyd
[1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:35.400]  racist police narrative because both the officer and the victim are black but
[1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:43.960]  that didn't stop the mob from ramping up the prejudicial poison black lives
[1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:51.560]  matter absolutely as well as all man all lives wabato so authorities aren't
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:57.440]  taking any chances though calling a 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew shutting down City
[1:02:57.440 --> 1:03:02.480]  Hall until Monday barring hardware stores from selling anything that could be
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:07.120]  used to burn or loot property and shutting down most businesses while the
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:11.480]  National Guard is on standby and since the decision had enough time to
[1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:17.400]  marinate the usual BLM antifa agitators had time to mobilize as CNN and
[1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:22.480]  Michelle Obama's fiery but mostly peaceful rioters literally attacked
[1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:43.440]  residential homes
[1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:48.120]  meanwhile Kamala Harris used the Charlottesville hoax as a paramount
[1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:53.680]  point in her vice presidential debate strategy show Charlottesville where
[1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:59.920]  people were peacefully protesting the need for racial justice where a young
[1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:04.520]  woman was killed and on the other side there were neo-nazis carrying tiki
[1:04:04.520 --> 1:04:13.360]  torches shouting racial epithets anti-Semitic slurs and Donald Trump
[1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:19.040]  when asked about it said there were fine people on both sides this is who we
[1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:22.480]  have is the president of the United States I mean senator Harris conveniently
[1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:26.480]  omitted after after the president made comments about people on either side of
[1:04:26.480 --> 1:04:32.160]  the debate over monuments he condemned the KKK neo-nazis and white
[1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:37.560]  supremacists and has done so repeatedly the president of the United States took
[1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:42.760]  a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white
[1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:48.800]  supremacists not a total lie used to draw in gullible voters and support the
[1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:59.320]  mob mentality destroying America John bound for more than a hundred years the
[1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:03.520]  Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government abolished
[1:05:03.520 --> 1:05:07.840]  nation-states dumbed down the population by taking control of education and most
[1:05:07.840 --> 1:05:12.640]  importantly taking control of Western medicine now they had a bad name by the
[1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:17.200]  1920s they started converting over and funding other organizations and groups
[1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:22.960]  like IBM to continue on with their eugenics operations fast forward to the
[1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:28.680]  1980s the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to
[1:05:28.680 --> 1:05:32.200]  Bill Gates the third his father of course being had a Planned Parenthood and
[1:05:32.200 --> 1:05:37.000]  now he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:43.080]  the world every national health system Bill Gates is in control they have spent
[1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:48.120]  a hundred plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to
[1:05:48.120 --> 1:05:52.120]  your body and what goes in your body this is the holy grail of their
[1:05:52.120 --> 1:06:07.840]  operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of DNA in your body
[1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:28.440]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:31.680]  all right we're gonna play footage here in a few minutes of myself and I'm
[1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:36.480]  shroyer driving through Austin yesterday and a lot of folks supported us a lot of
[1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:39.840]  people were ambivalent others were telling us go to hell they would
[1:06:39.840 --> 1:06:44.280]  hope we die we've got footage of that we're gonna roll here in a few minutes
[1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:49.480]  because we were bullhorning and also a loud PA system that was going like five
[1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:57.040]  six blocks up it's very loud that the UN directed Bill Gates directed world
[1:06:57.040 --> 1:07:00.720]  government directed lockdown has already starved two million people to death
[1:07:00.720 --> 1:07:04.680]  according to the UN and hundreds of millions are set to starve the death and
[1:07:04.680 --> 1:07:12.960]  the world financial system and food supply and delivery supply chain is
[1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:16.480]  breaking down I mean that's quite a headline global bombshell UN says
[1:07:16.480 --> 1:07:25.000]  COVID restrictions and lockdowns are killing millions must stop and I've got
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:28.440]  like a four-minute report we're gonna play again of us driving through Austin
[1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:34.440]  but I was out at the park two weeks ago you saw the footage we played it here
[1:07:34.440 --> 1:07:40.000]  and I just launched a drone that old speaker on it over Zilker Park downtown
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:45.960]  Austin saying hey the UN admits the COVID-19 lockdowns are killing millions
[1:07:45.960 --> 1:07:50.520]  but the UN doesn't ever say in the lockdowns they say give us money to
[1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:54.000]  deliver food to people's houses but they just keep the money and they people
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:59.520]  die we've got the reports right here so I came out and I said how dare the UN
[1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:03.640]  COVID program and their head of rapid response and their head on boy and all
[1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:07.560]  of them I said they're guilty if they don't do something of murder two million
[1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:10.600]  have already starved to death their own numbers their accurate numbers and they
[1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:14.240]  admit a hundred something million starved to death the next year 200 plus
[1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:20.160]  million the next two years these are all headlines all about to show you is when
[1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:26.560]  the first world collapses the third world dies well I'll be you know what it
[1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:34.400]  was the WHO director general special envoy on COVID-19 preparedness and
[1:08:34.400 --> 1:08:43.040]  response came out yesterday David Nabarro zoom a little bit closer on that
[1:08:43.040 --> 1:08:46.600]  for me please a lot of folks are watching on their phones they can't see that
[1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:54.480]  there this he came out and he said it's causing a lot more harm than good and
[1:08:54.480 --> 1:08:57.680]  needs to stop you can read his full statement gateway put in as an article
[1:08:57.680 --> 1:09:01.680]  about it and there's the head of the UN vaccine program saying it's killing
[1:09:01.680 --> 1:09:05.080]  people they're covering it up it's got to stop that was December last year so
[1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:08.680]  they get orders from the big banks that own and run the UN the Rockefellers set
[1:09:08.680 --> 1:09:11.840]  it up they have operation lockstep it said they'll bring in world government
[1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:18.120]  and have the UN take over but the UN itself is just a corporate front group
[1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:24.720]  big article on national file.com World Bank UN Harvard think tanks all agree and
[1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:29.640]  warn COVID-19 lockdowns and response leading to global starvation food
[1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:35.480]  disruptions and here's the deal maybe you're a eugenicist like Bill Gates or
[1:09:35.480 --> 1:09:39.680]  the Rockefellers you think well there are too many Africans let's cut off their
[1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:43.960]  supply chain and not by the crops they sell us and not by the flowers they
[1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:48.160]  sell us one of the biggest things Africa grows as flowers let's just screw them
[1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:52.600]  okay well the UN is going to use the refugee flows as a political weapon to
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:56.200]  bring them in and then use them as a political tool to bring us down as well
[1:09:56.200 --> 1:10:00.000]  because if you think Bill Gates hates people in Africa he really hates you I
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:06.040]  don't care what color you are he wants power and control over everyone period
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:10.080]  this is total domination
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:21.480]  so that's it but imagine you walk up to left as you go hey I need your help the
[1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:25.560]  UN ordered lockdowns killing millions and millions hundreds of times more than
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:29.000]  COVID and it's designed like that by Bill Gates and you felt and they just
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.300]  just shut up you racist filth and they flip you off within joy and like get
[1:10:33.300 --> 1:10:37.240]  really excited like they do about abortion like they do about infanticide
[1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:42.080]  or euthanasia of old people because they have a satanic spirit I've been
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:47.640]  around them the average leftist loves death they love power they love the fact
[1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:51.320]  they're third that their first world and other people aren't but here's the
[1:10:51.320 --> 1:10:54.880]  difference you care you might be old you might be young you might be black you
[1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:58.720]  might be white you understand you have empathy that what is allowed to be done
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:01.880]  to these poor people will be done to you but here's the article a gateway
[1:11:01.880 --> 1:11:07.720]  punnet.com someone tell the radical Democrats WHO backflips on lockdowns
[1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:13.840]  in global economy decimated and worlds poor are starving to death so important
[1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:20.520]  full video full articles on info wars.com but let's roll out to break with
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:23.600]  the video of myself and Owen shroyer in the armored vehicle because leftists
[1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:27.640]  will attack you have to have one to go out in the leftist area bullhorning them
[1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:32.080]  and then going to a big reopen Texas reopen the world rally that was
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:12:01.920]  happening outside the governor's mansion here it is.
[1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:07.400]  The third world is starving to death because of the lockdown the lockdown is
[1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:15.280]  killing millions COVID-19 is the Davos group's global reset to collapse the
[1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:17.840]  economy by design.
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:19.840]  Free Texas now!
[1:12:19.840 --> 1:12:21.840]  Free Texas now!
[1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:23.840]  Free Texas now!
[1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:25.840]  Free Texas now!
[1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:28.840]  If you're ready to listen there's a couple thousand people out demonstrating.
[1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:33.720]  We reject this now and we must reelect Trump and tell him that he must
[1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:39.480]  reject it too and if governor Abbott doesn't reopen Texas he's not gonna be
[1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:42.480]  living in that mansion anymore.
[1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:46.680]  Our message to governor Abbott is this we now know that they've exaggerated the
[1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:53.160]  COVID-19 deaths 99.9% we now know they've had false testing that kind of folks that
[1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:58.880]  out of other things as COVID deaths and it's time to end the COVID hoax and the
[1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:00.880]  COVID power cloud now.
[1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:03.880]  End the lockdown now!
[1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:07.760]  If you continue this lockdown in these face mask orders you will go down as one of the
[1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:11.760]  worst governors in the history of Texas and I think it's a shame.
[1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:18.760]  You're here in the fires of the Bill Gates UN lockdown and I salute you!
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:23.760]  Turn back and do the right thing Abbott!
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:25.760]  And to free Texas now!
[1:13:25.760 --> 1:13:27.760]  Free Texas now!
[1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:29.760]  Free Texas now!
[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:31.760]  Free Texas now!
[1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:33.760]  Free Texas now!
[1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:36.760]  The only time they got mad at me is when I started saying Abbott can turn back.
[1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:38.760]  They hate him so much now.
[1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:40.760]  Governor Abbott, do not destroy your legacy.
[1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:42.760]  Do not enslave Texas.
[1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:44.760]  Do the right thing.
[1:13:44.760 --> 1:13:46.760]  Admit that you've got cons.
[1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:50.760]  Please, you're making Texas hate you forever.
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:55.760]  Governor Abbott, the lockdown has already killed 2 million people in Africa.
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:58.760]  The EU admits hundreds of millions will starve to death.
[1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:03.760]  And the United Nations is the group with Davos orchestrating the lockdown.
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:07.760]  The lockdown is the killer, not COVID-19.
[1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:11.760]  The lockdown is the killer, not COVID-19.
[1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:15.760]  Governor Abbott, I know you're not stupid.
[1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:21.760]  I know you know 94% of the deaths were something else in the lockdown.
[1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:24.760]  Bill Gates says we're never taking the mask off.
[1:14:24.760 --> 1:14:28.760]  Bill Gates says we're all going to take force inoculations.
[1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:32.760]  Bill Gates says we are his slaves and he owns us.
[1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:36.760]  And I say, Bill Gates has burned in hell!
[1:14:36.760 --> 1:14:38.760]  Burn in hell!
[1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:40.760]  Bill Gates, burn in hell!
[1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:43.760]  Bill Gates, burn in hell!
[1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:45.760]  Bill Gates, burn in hell!
[1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:48.760]  Bill Gates, burn in hell!
[1:14:48.760 --> 1:14:52.760]  Bill Gates, the lockdown is killing millions, not COVID.
[1:14:52.760 --> 1:14:57.760]  The lockdown is still happening in the third world.
[1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:04.760]  This is an economic weapon we must stand against the globalist now.
[1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:07.760]  Free the world now.
[1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:10.760]  Free the world now.
[1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:15.760]  If the world.com stands with human life.
[1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:20.760]  Bill Gates and the UN have launched COVID so they can make us all run into our houses
[1:15:20.760 --> 1:15:23.760]  and never leave again.
[1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:27.760]  And then of course it's Obama with the cages lady, but look at this lady.
[1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:29.760]  But you don't care that it's Obama with the cages.
[1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:32.760]  You like to live in delusional land.
[1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:34.760]  You say no more cages.
[1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:39.760]  And it is the lockdown that is causing millions and millions to die.
[1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:41.760]  Take your mask off.
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:43.760]  Be free again.
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:45.760]  Take your mask off.
[1:15:45.760 --> 1:16:10.760]  All right, then full reports at infowars.com, but this is such a huge topic.
[1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:22.760]  We look back on all the warnings you were given and all just the common sense that you don't believe in God or prophecy.
[1:16:22.760 --> 1:16:28.760]  Giving governments and corporations the power to control who can buy and who can sell to track everything we do.
[1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:32.760]  It's not just a recipe, it's a blueprint for total enslavement.
[1:16:32.760 --> 1:16:36.760]  Now you look at Bill Gates, you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say,
[1:16:36.760 --> 1:16:42.760]  we're technocrats, we should decide how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get, how much red meat you get.
[1:16:42.760 --> 1:16:44.760]  We're technocrats, we know best.
[1:16:44.760 --> 1:16:48.760]  We're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control you.
[1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:50.760]  You snap your fingers, we're here.
[1:16:50.760 --> 1:16:52.760]  They're just rolling it out.
[1:16:52.760 --> 1:16:54.760]  And a lot of people are complying with it.
[1:16:54.760 --> 1:16:56.760]  It's insane.
[1:16:56.760 --> 1:17:02.760]  We're coming up in a few months on 14 years that my patriots supply has been our big food sponsor.
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:08.760]  In the past I had a bunch of different sponsors, they'd be good for a while, then they'd become unreliable.
[1:17:08.760 --> 1:17:12.760]  And I just operate off the list of reviews and what I personally buy and what I like.
[1:17:12.760 --> 1:17:14.760]  And they're the best.
[1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:19.760]  For the price you pay, no one can come even close to the quality of this food.
[1:17:19.760 --> 1:17:23.760]  A lot of it tastes gourmet, the rest of it tastes pretty good, okay.
[1:17:23.760 --> 1:17:27.760]  That compared to competition stuff that costs the same amount, it all tastes like crap.
[1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:31.760]  And that's what you see in the reviews, that's what you see from listeners.
[1:17:31.760 --> 1:17:37.760]  Now, they can't go lower, ever, than the prices at InformerStore.com because of other distributors.
[1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:43.760]  But they have decided, this is very, very rare, to give us an even better deal at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:50.760]  Where you can get $600 off your supply, $300 off six months, $160 off three months, and a bunch of other specials as well.
[1:17:50.760 --> 1:18:02.760]  But it's only for a limited time, it ends in three days at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:25.760]  No more pesky lawn order.
[1:18:25.760 --> 1:18:28.760]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:34.760]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[1:18:34.760 --> 1:18:44.760]  But wait, vote for Democrats now and bill include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes.
[1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:51.760]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[1:19:15.760 --> 1:19:31.760]  The system is censoring because of the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[1:19:31.760 --> 1:19:37.760]  Trump has finally figured this out, and since he's going to take action, once re-elected, he gets big tech, and then he's modern in the situation.
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:41.760]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action.
[1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:52.760]  We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionsCenter.com, 2020ElectionsCenter.com, and checking out the new, redesigned, InfoWars.com, and share that link.
[1:19:52.760 --> 1:20:11.760]  Hope that's really acceptable, yeah.
[1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:17.760]  Welcome back, folks. I'm your host, Alex Jones. Let's let this great music roll a little bit longer.
[1:20:17.760 --> 1:20:23.760]  You know, I talk about my own psychological point of view because it's the only way I can try to describe things to you.
[1:20:23.760 --> 1:20:28.760]  Like, I was doing a lot of research today and ready to come here and do a whole show.
[1:20:28.760 --> 1:20:39.760]  In about an hour and a half before I went live, I saw that the UN head envoy came out and said, yeah, we're killing a lot more people than we're saving with the lockdowns and with the mask and with the economic breakdown.
[1:20:39.760 --> 1:20:48.760]  We need to stop it. And then I did a deep dive researching that and who he was and the rest of it. And it was just, it was just them covering their ass for what they're about to do.
[1:20:48.760 --> 1:20:58.760]  So they can say it was all a big mistake. And I'm not, this isn't about me, but people need to get this part if you want to get everything.
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:13.760]  I'm not up here totally upset about this because I'm some bleeding heart, goody-tooth shoe that wants to virtue signal that I love black people.
[1:21:13.760 --> 1:21:20.760]  I'm not a fake leftist. I fundamentally see people being cut off and starved to death as a threat to me.
[1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:34.760]  Yeah, I care about them. I have empathy, but I'm able to analyze why God gave me empathy because I see my neighbors or somebody 5,000 miles away being enslaved by a group that's already pretty much running my country.
[1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:45.760]  Do I have solidarity with those people? Yeah. Do you think an admission they're killing them makes me happy? Do you think being confirmed again that it's going on?
[1:21:45.760 --> 1:22:02.760]  No, because here's the thing. They admit much more. I'm not going to just be able to sit here anymore and talk about it because they're killing a bunch of people and it's not funny.
[1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:09.760]  Let me tell you that people at the UN are scared. They know what they're putting in those vaccines. That's why they had that meeting in December saying we're told to do this.
[1:22:09.760 --> 1:22:21.760]  They're being allowed to test it and a lot of folks are getting sick and dying. And then Associated Press comes out and says tens of thousands of kids are dying, hundreds of thousands are getting paralyzed for life,
[1:22:21.760 --> 1:22:35.760]  where their family's got to take care of them, where your little daughter or son you love has got no muscles and has got polio in a wheelchair for the rest of their life because Bill Gates likes to do that to people.
[1:22:35.760 --> 1:22:46.760]  You think AP came out with that because they care? They did that to cover their ass. You think Bill Gates goes on CBS and says, yeah, 700,000 a year and gets sick or die?
[1:22:46.760 --> 1:22:59.760]  You think they told you 100% get sick with one of his vaccines and 80% with the other because they like you? They're getting ready to make you take it and admit it all even though it's going to hurt you.
[1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:10.760]  You know, if you study the Aztecs, the Babylonians, all these other cultures, the Druids, mothers and fathers willing to lead their three-year-olds up to an altar.
[1:23:10.760 --> 1:23:17.760]  And there'll be the high priest in his outfit. He came back in the day and on most cultures he had his face covered in case somebody got pissed later.
[1:23:17.760 --> 1:23:27.760]  They give him their son or daughter and they take that kid up there and they tie their hands or they give him a drink of drugs to make him submit and they cut their heart out right in front of their parents.
[1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:34.760]  That's government wanton power. Every culture is taken over by sickos that make you their favorites of three-year-old.
[1:23:34.760 --> 1:23:41.760]  Lead your little three-year-old up there to get killed in front of the whole village. You think you're going to question the village now?
[1:23:41.760 --> 1:23:50.760]  And it's never the chiefs that do this. You'll have strong chiefs, strong group, organize a good at whatever, good at agriculture, good at war.
[1:23:50.760 --> 1:23:59.760]  You'll build a little tribe. And right when the tribe hits about 5,000 people in anthropology, the priest class rises.
[1:23:59.760 --> 1:24:07.760]  And every time they serve dark entities, the priests are taking drugs that let them interface with the entities, interdimensionally.
[1:24:07.760 --> 1:24:11.760]  This is the best theory on what's going on. That's what the Pentagon believes.
[1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:18.760]  And they give them dark knowledge on how to control people and that's what they do. And then the priests take over.
[1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:28.760]  Well, I'm not leading my family up that damn pit to have them thrown off into a pit of water to have their heart cut out to serve this satanic system.
[1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:34.760]  But that's all any of this is and make no mistakes ever.
[1:24:34.760 --> 1:24:47.760]  That's what abortion is. It's what infanticide is. It's what euthanasia is. It's the same cult that every culture ends up following during their decline right before they collapse.
[1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:52.760]  And now they want us to lead our sons in because that's what the vaccines are designed for to target males.
[1:24:52.760 --> 1:24:56.760]  That's about 95% of autism's boys. It's designed for them.
[1:24:56.760 --> 1:24:59.760]  Blood brain barrier on boys is about a third as thick.
[1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:07.760]  And they hit our boys with lobotomy. The average boy gets an IQ reduction, health problems in life, neurological disorders, Parkinson's later.
[1:25:07.760 --> 1:25:14.760]  But, you know, if you get overcooked, like Gates talks about, he goes, yes, some people get really sick so that all of you have the effect.
[1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:17.760]  And the effect is sterilization.
[1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:23.760]  They can't be everybody. It's got to be a percentage that they hit you with enough things. Nobody can tell what hit you.
[1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:26.760]  It's called killing you softly.
[1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:30.760]  Soft kill weapons. Killing you quietly.
[1:25:30.760 --> 1:25:35.760]  Brad Pitt had a stupid movie where he's a hit man. I forget the name, but it's like killing you softly or something.
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:38.760]  It's not a term he came up with. It's a Pentagon term.
[1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:40.760]  He has a guy who helped him do a murder.
[1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:43.760]  He walks around, hey, thanks a lot. It shoots him in the head.
[1:25:43.760 --> 1:25:45.760]  Never knew what hit him.
[1:25:45.760 --> 1:25:47.760]  Well, guess what?
[1:25:47.760 --> 1:25:49.760]  Guess what, Bill Gates? Guess what world?
[1:25:49.760 --> 1:25:51.760]  We know what hit us.
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:59.760]  And we're not going to play along with you just so I can get some seat at your table.
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:05.760]  And so the UN head of vaccine program says, don't take vaccines. They're killing people.
[1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:12.760]  And then you see this huge operation Gates launches for who he represents to like just say, okay, it is killing people and it is making you sick.
[1:26:12.760 --> 1:26:14.760]  And you're going to take it.
[1:26:14.760 --> 1:26:17.760]  You're going to take it.
[1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:26.760]  Now, does that mean as a man, I'm going to let the UN weaponize Africa when it collapses and then March tens of millions, hundreds of millions of Africans in take over?
[1:26:26.760 --> 1:26:29.760]  No, I'm against that and I'll fight them.
[1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:33.760]  But I want them to be free in their country and then if they come here legally, that's fine.
[1:26:33.760 --> 1:26:40.760]  But I understand, see, that's people don't have third dimensional warfare, which is even a base level, much less fourth, fifth, sixth.
[1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:43.760]  They go, well, my God, if you're for the third world, you should let everybody in.
[1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:45.760]  Oh, so the Democrats can run them.
[1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:50.760]  See, the globalists are sterilizing, poisoning, euthanizing people all over the world.
[1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:55.760]  But then they brainwash certain groups and bring them here as a weapon because they're attacking us too.
[1:26:55.760 --> 1:26:58.760]  You think Bill Gates is just a white supremacist.
[1:26:58.760 --> 1:27:01.760]  He's an anti humanist.
[1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:08.760]  He's a post humanist exterminists.
[1:27:08.760 --> 1:27:11.760]  He believes humanity is broken because he's broken.
[1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:16.760]  He's projecting his hate of himself on to you and me.
[1:27:16.760 --> 1:27:25.760]  So I give human dignity to everybody because I demand it myself and I will stand up for everybody's right to life, liberty, pursuit, happiness, but not at my expense.
[1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:33.760]  And when they implode the third world, which they're dealing with this and as the collapse becomes evident and hundreds of millions are dying by next year, already millions are dead.
[1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:35.760]  It's a domino effect though.
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:38.760]  It's a logarithmic. The UN is going, oh my God, everybody's starving to death.
[1:27:38.760 --> 1:27:44.760]  We need to stop this because they're covering their demonic ashes.
[1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:51.760]  And then when they're surging over the borders and things are being destroyed and everything's collapsing and we're permanently all screwed.
[1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:53.760]  Africans, Americans, it doesn't matter.
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:57.760]  Remember who did it to you.
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:00.760]  Have a memory.
[1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:03.760]  What does the globalist minions always say?
[1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:05.760]  What does Jonathan Gruber say?
[1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:07.760]  What does Rothkopf say?
[1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:08.760]  What does Kissinger say?
[1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:15.760]  They say, thank God you don't have a memory.
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:19.760]  Africa could be a beautiful jewel, high tech, incredible science, great people.
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:21.760]  They've never been allowed to have it.
[1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:24.760]  Just like we got it for a little bit with the Renaissance.
[1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:26.760]  It's about to be taken from us as well.
[1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:30.760]  And we'll be kept poor in shacks so the globalists can feel above us.
[1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:35.760]  Then they'll just phase our ass out, robot police everywhere, hell on earth.
[1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:38.760]  But I say, no matter what color you are or where you came from, you've got red blood.
[1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:46.760]  And I say as humans, we can come together and recognize this threat and unify and destroy the globalist satanic takeover.
[1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:50.760]  And then we'll have unlimited living space in the stars.
[1:28:50.760 --> 1:29:01.760]  We must first pass through the gate of Satan.
[1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:23.760]  We are their biggest distributor.
[1:29:23.760 --> 1:29:28.760]  But because of how crazy things are, they have agreed to give us a deal no one else has been able to get.
[1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:35.760]  So this is the lowest price on the lowest price, highest quality storeable food you're going to find at preparewithalix.com.
[1:29:35.760 --> 1:29:42.760]  Now, they've set it out just three days this upcoming Monday for only 20-something days after the election.
[1:29:42.760 --> 1:29:45.760]  And it's about a week or so to be able to ship it to you.
[1:29:45.760 --> 1:29:51.760]  They've got the food on hand, but they cannot guarantee this one-week ship rate in the next month or so.
[1:29:51.760 --> 1:29:56.760]  Things are so crazy and food prices are going up, so take action now.
[1:29:56.760 --> 1:30:04.760]  Info Wars is a archetypal, classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against tyranny.
[1:30:04.760 --> 1:30:12.760]  You built Info Wars, you spread the word, you prayed for us, you bought the products, you called in, you made recommendations.
[1:30:12.760 --> 1:30:18.760]  Info Wars is as much yours as it is mine, and that's why the enemy is so upset that under the deplatforming,
[1:30:18.760 --> 1:30:23.760]  under all the DNC lawsuits, under all the attack, in many ways, we've become stronger.
[1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:32.760]  With Bandot Video, redesigned Info Wars, with all of our great crew, with documentary films and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day,
[1:30:32.760 --> 1:30:35.760]  we are the resistance, you are the resistance.
[1:30:35.760 --> 1:30:42.760]  So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to continue to spread the word about it and to continue for you to support,
[1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:45.760]  because this is something we built together.
[1:30:45.760 --> 1:30:51.760]  It's not just a national treasure, it's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants, and they know it, and they can't stand it.
[1:30:51.760 --> 1:31:06.760]  Everything we talked about comes true, our credibility only goes up together, so I salute you all.
[1:31:21.760 --> 1:31:28.760]  We're taking this past investigation into total and complete dehumanization.
[1:31:28.760 --> 1:31:35.760]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[1:31:35.760 --> 1:31:38.760]  This is their stated goal.
[1:31:38.760 --> 1:31:44.760]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror
[1:31:44.760 --> 1:31:48.760]  and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy when we turn this around.
[1:31:48.760 --> 1:31:53.760]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with it.
[1:31:53.760 --> 1:31:56.760]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[1:31:56.760 --> 1:32:03.760]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much less than the entire world.
[1:32:03.760 --> 1:32:09.760]  Info Wars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks at hundreds of stations, picking us up.
[1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:20.760]  Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda.
[1:32:20.760 --> 1:32:24.760]  That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at Band-Aught Video.
[1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:28.760]  They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook.
[1:32:28.760 --> 1:32:37.760]  That's why it's so precious, because censorship expands to everyone which it is now with AI monitoring and controlling what you can say and do.
[1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:44.760]  It's going to be the OACs, Black Band-Aught Video, and the now redesigned InfoWars.com that become more and more important, which they are.
[1:32:44.760 --> 1:32:54.760]  And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now, because they're coming after everyone.
[1:32:54.760 --> 1:33:07.760]  So spread the word now.
[1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:33.760]  You know, I actually became a better person being persecuted by the globalists.
[1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:39.760]  I'm still not perfect far from it, but I'm a much, much better person than I used to be.
[1:33:39.760 --> 1:33:42.760]  God, I used to care what people thought about me.
[1:33:42.760 --> 1:33:45.760]  Not as much as others, but I still did.
[1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:47.760]  It's so freeing not to give a damn.
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:52.760]  The only integrity I have is with God, and that's the only person that matters at the end of the day.
[1:33:52.760 --> 1:33:57.760]  And I'm ashamed of myself in front of God, but I'm getting better.
[1:33:57.760 --> 1:33:58.760]  Welcome back.
[1:33:58.760 --> 1:33:59.760]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:33:59.760 --> 1:34:03.760]  Okay, let's talk cold, hard facts in Turkey here.
[1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:04.760]  Let's look at these headlines.
[1:34:04.760 --> 1:34:09.760]  This is out of the Star Tribune LA Times, New York Times, and these are all the headlines right here.
[1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:12.760]  Get ready to resist the Trump coup attempt.
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:14.760]  Remember, the left doesn't want a coup.
[1:34:14.760 --> 1:34:15.760]  They just call it a coup.
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:18.760]  They've been caught doing a coup, but Trump's going to have a coup.
[1:34:18.760 --> 1:34:24.760]  And they define it in all these articles as the same talking point, that if Trump challenges the election anyway,
[1:34:24.760 --> 1:34:33.760]  or challenges fake ballots or dead cats voting, it's now dead cats voting, literally, that he's a dictator.
[1:34:33.760 --> 1:34:35.760]  Well, that's oxymoronic.
[1:34:35.760 --> 1:34:37.760]  Well, yeah, they don't care.
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:44.760]  They think their constituents are morons, which they are, and they think they'll go out and riot.
[1:34:44.760 --> 1:34:49.760]  And then when it's a bunch of white methods outburning stuff down, they'll say, oh, look, it's Black Lives Matter.
[1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:55.760]  Trump's attacking the black people in a desperate attempt to manipulate black Americans into this.
[1:34:55.760 --> 1:34:56.760]  And I don't see it working.
[1:34:56.760 --> 1:34:57.760]  What do you see happening?
[1:34:57.760 --> 1:34:59.760]  I see a backlash.
[1:34:59.760 --> 1:35:00.760]  Here's another one.
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:05.760]  How we should defend against the impending Trump coup.
[1:35:05.760 --> 1:35:10.760]  He's been the deep state trying to coup him with Russiagate and all the rest of it.
[1:35:10.760 --> 1:35:11.760]  Here's another one.
[1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:12.760]  Vanity Fair.
[1:35:12.760 --> 1:35:18.760]  The Trump campaign is reportedly plotting an election coup to bypass the Biden win.
[1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:19.760]  All made up.
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:21.760]  You read the articles, which you already knew.
[1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:24.760]  They're like, yeah, we're going to challenge it if there's evidence of fraud.
[1:35:24.760 --> 1:35:26.760]  They call that bypass.
[1:35:26.760 --> 1:35:28.760]  10 things you know about.
[1:35:28.760 --> 1:35:30.760]  Way to stop a coup.
[1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:32.760]  Then there's this article.
[1:35:32.760 --> 1:35:34.760]  There will be no coup.
[1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:37.760]  And the article goes on to say he's a coward.
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:38.760]  He's a loser.
[1:35:38.760 --> 1:35:40.760]  He's a paper tiger.
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:45.760]  He's a fraud.
[1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:49.760]  Trump won't stand up when we take it from him.
[1:35:49.760 --> 1:35:55.760]  This is a classic story of somebody in a newspaper that hates America trying to get other people to go out.
[1:35:55.760 --> 1:35:57.760]  Oh, you kicked that guy's ass.
[1:35:57.760 --> 1:35:59.760]  He's about six foot five.
[1:35:59.760 --> 1:36:02.760]  He's got arms big around his tree trunks and legs are even bigger.
[1:36:02.760 --> 1:36:09.760]  I mean, he's over there like, he's like bending that steel bar like it's a pretzel.
[1:36:09.760 --> 1:36:13.760]  He's going over there to kick his ass.
[1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:15.760]  I mean, that's all this is.
[1:36:15.760 --> 1:36:16.760]  You ought to read the article.
[1:36:16.760 --> 1:36:21.760]  I'm not joking when I say that.
[1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:25.760]  They call him all these names and they said, but don't worry.
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:28.760]  When we push him aside, he'll go.
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:35.760]  Or like the Washington Post said a month ago, we'll arrest members of his cabinet who don't go along with our coup.
[1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:40.760]  He's heard Oberman, he said, oh, we're going to arrest all his supporters, all the prominent ones.
[1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:48.760]  We're going to put the Supreme Court nominee in a prison cell.
[1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:55.760]  I mean, it's like Joseph Stalin or Adolf Hitler or Mao Zedong or Fidel Castro just got reborn.
[1:36:55.760 --> 1:37:02.760]  I mean, this isn't this isn't like, oh, they're they're showing authoritarian tendencies.
[1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:10.760]  This is like going to the ND 500 and you see a race car and a driver and you go, I'm betting on that one.
[1:37:10.760 --> 1:37:13.760]  And then the last mile of the race, they take the pole position.
[1:37:13.760 --> 1:37:21.760]  I mean, it is the most naked authoritarianism I've ever seen anywhere.
[1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:25.760]  I mean, even Hitler and people didn't brag like this when they weren't in power.
[1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:33.760]  They kind of secretly did it later once they were in power.
[1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:36.760]  These people are crazy.
[1:37:36.760 --> 1:37:38.760]  Really crazy.
[1:37:38.760 --> 1:37:43.760]  But you see, they got to keep all their moles and all their minions still in government like Comey said last year.
[1:37:43.760 --> 1:37:44.760]  Oh, stay in there.
[1:37:44.760 --> 1:37:45.760]  We're going to get rid of Trump.
[1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:46.760]  Stay in there.
[1:37:46.760 --> 1:37:47.760]  Don't leave.
[1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:50.760]  And that's all this is because none of them have been held accountable.
[1:37:50.760 --> 1:37:53.760]  So why shouldn't they continue to do all this?
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:55.760]  And that's what's so dangerous about it.
[1:37:55.760 --> 1:37:57.760]  I don't care about retribution with these people.
[1:37:57.760 --> 1:37:59.760]  These people are a soulless demons.
[1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:01.760]  They've got God to deal with.
[1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:04.760]  But the problem is they don't go away.
[1:38:04.760 --> 1:38:07.760]  They just stay there like undead zombies.
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:12.760]  Maybe I should read the article.
[1:38:12.760 --> 1:38:20.760]  Three weeks from now, we will reach an end to the speculation about what Donald Trump will do if he faces political defeat.
[1:38:20.760 --> 1:38:25.760]  Whether he will leave power like a normal president or attempt some wild resistance.
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:35.760]  Reality will intrude substantially if not definitely into an argument or whether the president is corrupt and competent,
[1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:46.760]  who postures as a strong man on Twitter or a threat to the Republic to whom the words like authoritarianism and even autocrat can be reasonably applied.
[1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:50.760]  I've been on the first side of the argument since the early days of the presidency.
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:55.760]  And since we've nearing either an ending or some poldefying reset like last time,
[1:38:55.760 --> 1:38:58.760]  let me make the case one more time.
[1:38:58.760 --> 1:39:04.760]  Across the last four years, the Donald Trump administration has indeed displayed hallmarks of authoritarianism.
[1:39:04.760 --> 1:39:10.760]  It features egregious internal sycophantry and hacks in high positions,
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:15.760]  abuse of presidential rhetoric and bandacity on an unusual scale.
[1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:19.760]  The president's attempts to delegitimize when he vote aren't novel.
[1:39:19.760 --> 1:39:24.760]  It goes on to say, but the coward will stand down.
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:26.760]  He will go away.
[1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:30.760]  He lacks power over the media and it goes on.
[1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:32.760]  Even Fox News is against him.
[1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:37.760]  He lacks popularity, political skill, unlike other global strong men.
[1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:38.760]  He's a coward.
[1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:39.760]  He's a fool.
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:41.760]  The CIA and FBI will take him out.
[1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:42.760]  I mean, you got it.
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:44.760]  You got to go read this article.
[1:39:44.760 --> 1:39:51.760]  This is the most snot-nosed declaration of evil ever other than Keith Overman saying they're going to arrest everybody.
[1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:55.760]  But why is this so important?
[1:39:55.760 --> 1:40:00.760]  Well, the Wall Street Journal has an article, an American coup attempt,
[1:40:00.760 --> 1:40:07.760]  which actually lays out the real on record trying to overthrow the election, illegal spying, setting people up,
[1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:10.760]  putting innocent people in prison, what they really did.
[1:40:10.760 --> 1:40:21.760]  Everything the Democrats say they are, everything they say President Trump is, is what they are.
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:28.760]  And their God is a psychotic demon, Hillary Clinton.
[1:40:28.760 --> 1:40:30.760]  Now, let me shift gears here.
[1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:33.760]  We're going to go into the final segment and then I'm going to cover this.
[1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:37.760]  Trump is 22 days out, taking the gloves off.
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:40.760]  And he is excoriating members of his cabinet that are being cowards.
[1:40:40.760 --> 1:40:42.760]  And he's really getting on all cylinders.
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:44.760]  We'll talk about when we come back.
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:47.760]  Separately, there's like 10 hours left.
[1:40:47.760 --> 1:40:52.760]  If you want to get the highest quality, horrible foods out there at the lowest price that are ready to ship within one week.
[1:40:52.760 --> 1:40:58.760]  With all this uncertainty and all the craziness going on and all the globalist activity,
[1:40:58.760 --> 1:41:05.760]  I would get a six month a year food supply of high quality, horrible foods that last 25 years that are also patriots.
[1:41:05.760 --> 1:41:08.760]  And then it also funds this operation.
[1:41:08.760 --> 1:41:15.760]  Nine hours, 17 minutes, 54 seconds left to get the lowest price on the highest quality,
[1:41:15.760 --> 1:41:18.760]  horrible food on top of the lowest price.
[1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:23.760]  You haven't seen a sale in five years from my patriot, but I got him to do it and prepare with Alex.com.
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:25.760]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:30.760]  A one year food supply, already lowest price, highest quality, $600 off.
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:33.760]  A six month, $300 off.
[1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:36.760]  A three month, $160 off.
[1:41:36.760 --> 1:41:40.760]  And a bunch of other specials at preparewithAlex.com.
[1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:47.760]  And when this sale is over in the early morning hours of today, that is it.
[1:41:47.760 --> 1:41:51.760]  Because they told me they can't do it anymore because their other distributors are getting pissed off
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:55.760]  that I already had the lowest prices at m4store.com on their full catalog of food.
[1:41:55.760 --> 1:41:59.760]  And now I've gotten them to do this even lower price, which they think undercuts the market.
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:00.760]  I don't think it works like that.
[1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:04.760]  People tune into their shows, aren't tuned into mine, but they're a big sponsor out there for a lot of their big radio shows.
[1:42:04.760 --> 1:42:06.760]  We have the best price already.
[1:42:06.760 --> 1:42:08.760]  This is the best price on the best price.
[1:42:08.760 --> 1:42:12.760]  It ends in nine hours at preparewithAlex.com.
[1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:15.760]  They put the preparewithAlex.com up there.
[1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:17.760]  I will also tell you the toll free number.
[1:42:17.760 --> 1:42:22.760]  You can call and have all of your questions answered and also get that food.
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:29.760]  They have food ready to deliver to you right now at preparewithAlex.com.
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:30.760]  Let's throw the graphic back up, guys.
[1:42:30.760 --> 1:42:33.760]  The lower third, and it's got a lower third, a little toll free number.
[1:42:33.760 --> 1:42:35.760]  That is the specific number.
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:41.760]  You can always call my toll free number to get the general food, but maybe we'll add it in post for folks.
[1:42:41.760 --> 1:42:45.760]  We're live right now, but it's the preparewithAlex.com graphic.
[1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:48.760]  And when you put that up on the screen, there it is.
[1:42:48.760 --> 1:43:00.760]  Triple eight, four, one, one, zero, three, five, zero.
[1:43:00.760 --> 1:43:09.760]  They want private corporate governance above nation states, above religious institutions, above the family.
[1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:12.760]  They want total corporate power.
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:21.760]  It was a great film back in the early 1970s called Roller Ball with James Cahn, and it's based on a novel set in the year 2020.
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:28.760]  And in the book, you have megacorporates that control the planet, and there are no longer nation states.
[1:43:28.760 --> 1:43:33.760]  There are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations.
[1:43:33.760 --> 1:43:40.760]  If you actually read what the Deimos group of the CFR at the Lionel Commission say in the year 2020, that is their in game.
[1:43:40.760 --> 1:43:41.760]  That is their goal.
[1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:48.760]  So we're talking about a Hunger Games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless people to see us as shadow.
[1:43:48.760 --> 1:43:53.760]  They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy, common to China as their model.
[1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:55.760]  We must reject it now.
[1:43:55.760 --> 1:43:57.760]  Stand back and stand by.
[1:43:57.760 --> 1:44:04.760]  During our Save America InfoWars money bond sale, we have all your favorite products up to 60% off plus free shipping.

[1:44:14.760 --> 1:44:20.760]  Winter Sun Plus works as a defense against attacks on your immune system, which will be great during the coming winter months.
[1:44:20.760 --> 1:44:25.760]  Some of our best sellers, like Bodies and TurboForce, are on sale for 10% off.

[1:45:21.760 --> 1:45:30.760]  The system is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:35.760]  Trump has finally figured this out, and since he's going to take action once re-elected against big tech,
[1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:37.760]  I mean, he's a modern situation.
[1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:41.760]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry because he has to take an action.
[1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:46.760]  We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020electioncenter.com,
[1:45:46.760 --> 1:45:52.760]  2020electioncenter.com, and checking out the new redesigned infohorses.com and sharing that link.
[1:45:52.760 --> 1:46:17.760]  Hope that really upsets them. Oh, yeah.
[1:46:22.760 --> 1:46:25.760]  They are allowing us this last time big deal.
[1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:32.760]  It's been extended three days, specials on top of their biggest specials ever, and preparewithalex.com.
[1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:37.760]  Preparewithalex.com has even better deals than infohorsetore.com.
[1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:42.760]  We're their biggest distributor, so contractually, we have to sell at the same price that they sell at distributors do.
[1:46:42.760 --> 1:46:48.760]  This is already a great deal, but, again, preparewithalex.com, they're able to do a promotion on one year,
[1:46:48.760 --> 1:46:53.760]  six month, and three month supplies, 600 bucks off on a year, and it goes from there.
[1:46:53.760 --> 1:46:59.760]  Go to preparewithalex.com.
[1:46:59.760 --> 1:47:11.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:12.760]  Let the good times roll.
[1:47:12.760 --> 1:47:17.760]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:25.760]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:28.760]  Let them wash.
[1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:32.760]  They say brush, but he says wash.
[1:47:32.760 --> 1:47:33.760]  The next line.
[1:47:33.760 --> 1:47:39.760]  You know, when I'm being attacked, when I'm being lied about, only to judge I've got Scott,
[1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:42.760]  and almost always, it's not even a real attack.
[1:47:42.760 --> 1:47:46.760]  So I just stay on target and just ignore the attacks.
[1:47:46.760 --> 1:47:51.760]  The point of the enemy cannot stand it, because you're my judge, as viewers and listeners,
[1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:53.760]  that you keep us on air.
[1:47:53.760 --> 1:47:56.760]  And I almost said this earlier, and then I got depressed reading another article.
[1:47:56.760 --> 1:48:03.760]  I had to do it about one African town of like 50,000, where 3,000 children starved to death last month.
[1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:06.760]  I mean, I can't be vitriolic.
[1:48:06.760 --> 1:48:12.760]  Hey, the U.N. admits they're murdering everybody.
[1:48:12.760 --> 1:48:16.760]  It's sick.
[1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:20.760]  And it's going to come back on us unless we do something about it.
[1:48:20.760 --> 1:48:23.760]  I mean, I feel the spiritual danger of this.
[1:48:23.760 --> 1:48:24.760]  I'm not doing this as a hero.
[1:48:24.760 --> 1:48:28.760]  I'm doing this as survival, physically and spiritually.
[1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:30.760]  It isn't heroic to stand up to this.
[1:48:30.760 --> 1:48:31.760]  You better do it.
[1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:33.760]  And I know you understand that.
[1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:35.760]  But look at this.
[1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:37.760]  I mean, I've talked a lot about this because I just run into it.
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:43.760]  The U.N. runs the operations, stopping child trafficking, and there's just thousands of articles that caught all the world,
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:45.760]  kidnapping kids, snuff filming them.
[1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:47.760]  I mean, the U.N. is the worst.
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:55.760]  The Sun newspaper reports Gisling Maxwell, the female pimp, she basically ran Epstein,
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:49:06.760]  pictured an anti-sex trafficking event before arrest for providing Pito Epstein with young girls.
[1:49:06.760 --> 1:49:10.760]  And when I started really exposing this five years ago, I was exposing it 20 years ago,
[1:49:10.760 --> 1:49:14.760]  but I got some visits by folks that have been involved actually taking these groups out.
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:16.760]  They said, listen, Jones, you got to be careful.
[1:49:16.760 --> 1:49:18.760]  A lot of the groups saying they're fighting and are running,
[1:49:18.760 --> 1:49:24.760]  and then they exposed to me how the Amber Alert headlady changed her name and now runs it.
[1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:33.760]  But she got convicted of shipping kids out of Haiti a bunch of them disappeared, some dead.
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:39.760]  So there she is, Gisling Maxwell at the event for kidnapped children.
[1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:42.760]  This is sick.
[1:49:42.760 --> 1:49:44.760]  This is sick.
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:46.760]  And that ties into all this other news.
[1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:56.760]  FBI agent who found Wiener Laptop with Clinton e-mails says FBI leadership ordered him to erase his findings.
[1:49:56.760 --> 1:50:02.760]  And we know that General Flynn and others lawyers have seen and talked to lawyers that have seen it and talked to the cops that saw it.
[1:50:02.760 --> 1:50:11.760]  But I remember back four years ago during the campaign, four years ago, plus about four years and a month ago, about two months before the election.
[1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:18.760]  I was talking to people that were the state police and stuff.
[1:50:18.760 --> 1:50:25.760]  And did you know that three of the five contacts are dead and their children?
[1:50:25.760 --> 1:50:30.760]  Oh, it's always a heroin overdose.
[1:50:30.760 --> 1:50:35.760]  Something like 10 of the 12 cops are dead.
[1:50:35.760 --> 1:50:37.760]  And by the way, I'm not as upper saying that.
[1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:44.760]  Like these are real people I talked to. They're dead.
[1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:46.760]  People ask, why are you still in there?
[1:50:46.760 --> 1:50:51.760]  It's like Jim Garrison, the DA in New Orleans famously told the media, he said, I stay in the spotlight.
[1:50:51.760 --> 1:50:52.760]  I'm prominent.
[1:50:52.760 --> 1:50:53.760]  There's only reason I'm alive.
[1:50:53.760 --> 1:50:55.760]  Wolves don't come into the flame, the fire.
[1:50:55.760 --> 1:50:58.760]  They get you when you're out taking a piss in the woods.
[1:50:58.760 --> 1:51:00.760]  That's when the tiger gets you.
[1:51:00.760 --> 1:51:01.760]  It's when the bear gets you.
[1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:02.760]  It's when the wolf gets you.
[1:51:02.760 --> 1:51:05.760]  It's when you're out there at night away from the fire.
[1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:07.760]  The light keeps you safe.
[1:51:07.760 --> 1:51:09.760]  I'm right around to the lights right now.
[1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:11.760]  I just pray to Jesus to keep me safe.
[1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:13.760]  But if they want to take me, I'm not scared.
[1:51:13.760 --> 1:51:14.760]  And they hate the fact I'm not scared.
[1:51:14.760 --> 1:51:16.760]  And I don't say that's that tough to people.
[1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:18.760]  It's not that's not that.
[1:51:18.760 --> 1:51:20.760]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:51:20.760 --> 1:51:21.760]  You can do that too.
[1:51:21.760 --> 1:51:24.760]  Trust in Jesus and stop carrying it up to your body.
[1:51:24.760 --> 1:51:26.760]  You're going to die anyways.
[1:51:26.760 --> 1:51:29.760]  And like dying is just like following the bicycle.
[1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:30.760]  You hit the ground.
[1:51:30.760 --> 1:51:31.760]  You're dead.
[1:51:31.760 --> 1:51:32.760]  You're with God.
[1:51:32.760 --> 1:51:34.760]  It's not big folks.
[1:51:34.760 --> 1:51:38.760]  As soon as you die, you're going to laugh at this later.
[1:51:38.760 --> 1:51:39.760]  You're going to have eternity.
[1:51:39.760 --> 1:51:42.760]  Time's not going to matter anymore.
[1:51:42.760 --> 1:51:43.760]  Think about that.
[1:51:43.760 --> 1:51:45.760]  Stop giving Satan power.
[1:51:45.760 --> 1:51:46.760]  Stop caring.
[1:51:46.760 --> 1:51:47.760]  Don't give it suicide.
[1:51:47.760 --> 1:51:48.760]  Your life is precious.
[1:51:48.760 --> 1:51:50.760]  Stay here and do good work.
[1:51:50.760 --> 1:51:52.760]  That's your life belongs to God.
[1:51:52.760 --> 1:51:54.760]  But stop caring if you die.
[1:51:54.760 --> 1:51:56.760]  See, I'm the opposite suicidal.
[1:51:56.760 --> 1:51:57.760]  I love my life.
[1:51:57.760 --> 1:52:01.760]  I love beer and food and my family and everything.
[1:52:01.760 --> 1:52:02.760]  I love, I love life.
[1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:05.760]  I love it so much that I'll give it up right now.
[1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:10.760]  Because I won't sell one person out for Satan.
[1:52:10.760 --> 1:52:14.760]  I won't sell one person out for another hundred years of life.
[1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:17.760]  Another thousand years of life because it's a scam.
[1:52:17.760 --> 1:52:18.760]  It's a lie.
[1:52:18.760 --> 1:52:20.760]  I was already given eternal life.
[1:52:20.760 --> 1:52:23.760]  I was already created and put on this planet in a test by the
[1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:24.760]  Supreme being.
[1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:25.760]  And I have that connection.
[1:52:25.760 --> 1:52:26.760]  And I know that.
[1:52:26.760 --> 1:52:27.760]  And I choose that.
[1:52:27.760 --> 1:52:29.760]  And I am above Satan.
[1:52:29.760 --> 1:52:34.760]  Get behind me, Satan.
[1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:37.760]  But let's hit some of the positives right now.
[1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:42.760]  Trump urges Attorney General Barr to indict Obama, Biden, and Hillary.
[1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:44.760]  You notice, Trump said this Thursday.
[1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:47.760]  Barr came out Friday and said, we will not before the election.
[1:52:47.760 --> 1:52:49.760]  He's a swamp creature.
[1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:52.760]  He doesn't want a war.
[1:52:52.760 --> 1:52:53.760]  There's already a war.
[1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:55.760]  I don't think Barr is bad.
[1:52:55.760 --> 1:52:57.760]  He just thinks Trump is too aggressive.
[1:52:57.760 --> 1:52:58.760]  No, this is what we elected.
[1:52:58.760 --> 1:53:01.760]  This is what we want.
[1:53:01.760 --> 1:53:04.760]  Trump chewed into Pompeo, said release emails.
[1:53:04.760 --> 1:53:06.760]  They released like half of them yesterday.
[1:53:06.760 --> 1:53:07.760]  No media coverage.
[1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:08.760]  We've been plowing through them.
[1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:10.760]  There's tens of thousands of them.
[1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:13.760]  Trump tells Iran, go ahead and attack somebody.
[1:53:13.760 --> 1:53:14.760]  We'll eff you up.
[1:53:14.760 --> 1:53:17.760]  He said that because no president ever used that language.
[1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:18.760]  He wants to know he's serious.
[1:53:18.760 --> 1:53:21.760]  Let's play a few of those clips right now.
[1:53:21.760 --> 1:53:22.760]  Right.
[1:53:22.760 --> 1:53:23.760]  And Iran knows that.
[1:53:23.760 --> 1:53:24.760]  And they've been put on notice.
[1:53:24.760 --> 1:53:30.760]  If you fuck around with us, if you do something bad to us, we are going to do things to you
[1:53:30.760 --> 1:53:32.760]  that have never been done before.
[1:53:32.760 --> 1:53:36.760]  They're in the State Department, but Mike Pompeo hasn't unable to get them out, which
[1:53:36.760 --> 1:53:37.760]  is very sad.
[1:53:37.760 --> 1:53:41.760]  Actually, I'm not happy about him for that, that reason.
[1:53:41.760 --> 1:53:42.760]  He was unable to get about.
[1:53:42.760 --> 1:53:43.760]  I don't know why he's running the State Department.
[1:53:43.760 --> 1:53:44.760]  You get him out.
[1:53:44.760 --> 1:53:46.760]  Forget about the fact that they were classified.
[1:53:46.760 --> 1:53:47.760]  Let's go.
[1:53:47.760 --> 1:53:51.760]  Maybe Mike Pompeo finally finds them, okay?
[1:53:51.760 --> 1:53:53.760]  So notice Trump is doing what you got to do.
[1:53:53.760 --> 1:53:54.760]  He's on the warpath.
[1:53:54.760 --> 1:53:56.760]  He's done with 20-something days out.
[1:53:56.760 --> 1:53:57.760]  He's on the attack.
[1:53:57.760 --> 1:54:01.760]  We should all be on the attack peacefully, but with the truth.
[1:54:01.760 --> 1:54:08.760]  And stop letting leftists waddle up and dictate to us that we're racist or we're bad when
[1:54:08.760 --> 1:54:12.760]  they're the ones supporting Chinese death camps for Muslims, Christians, and Buddhists,
[1:54:12.760 --> 1:54:15.760]  and when they're the ones that support pedophilia.
[1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:17.760]  Stop being afraid of the left.
[1:54:17.760 --> 1:54:24.760]  Stop being afraid of their bad housekeeping still of approval.
[1:54:24.760 --> 1:54:30.760]  If you don't have the devil and the world and the left after you, I can tell you right
[1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:33.760]  now, like the Bible says, God's going to say, I don't know you.
[1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:34.760]  What does Christ say?
[1:54:34.760 --> 1:54:39.760]  He who is with me is against he who is controlled the world.
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:47.760]  You will be persecuted in my name, but you will be blessed, but you first must be persecuted.
[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:54.760]  And those that are steadfast will be given eternal life.
[1:54:54.760 --> 1:55:01.760]  I mean, you don't think all of our souls, all of our bandwidth, all of who we are, is
[1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:03.760]  going to get life with God.
[1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:07.760]  We're not going to get like a song catalog.
[1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:11.760]  You don't think God's going to keep us unless we're a good song.
[1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:12.760]  And listen, don't worry.
[1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:17.760]  Those of you that don't want God, you get eternal life too.
[1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:19.760]  You get to spend your time with each other.
[1:55:19.760 --> 1:55:21.760]  I mean, that sounds like hell to me.
[1:55:21.760 --> 1:55:28.760]  You get to go to your SJW Paris parasite palace and you get to be with each other forever
[1:55:28.760 --> 1:55:34.760]  because there's, listen, Newtonian physics show it, Einsteinian physics show it, Max
[1:55:34.760 --> 1:55:41.760]  Plinks physics show it, quantum mechanics show it, and nobody that's a top map petition
[1:55:41.760 --> 1:55:42.760]  doesn't believe in God.
[1:55:42.760 --> 1:55:45.760]  They all go, oh my God, this is God.
[1:55:45.760 --> 1:55:47.760]  And you got to come to grips with that.
[1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:48.760]  God's real.
[1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:57.760]  And you got to decide what side you're on because people that serve evil are crazy.
[1:55:57.760 --> 1:56:03.760]  They are going against God and God's math because they want to be God.
[1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:08.760]  Instead of your part of what God expressed and that's your place in the universe.
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:15.760]  These idiots go, no, men are women and women are men and we're going to overturn everything
[1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:24.760]  and we're going to make a giant 5,000 foot red tree that stinks horribly to quote time bandits.
[1:56:24.760 --> 1:56:28.760]  And you're like, well, why wasn't there a 5,000 foot tree that stunk horribly?
[1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:30.760]  Because there's no point in it.
[1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:33.760]  We have thousands of species of parrots.
[1:56:33.760 --> 1:56:35.760]  Let's have laser beams day one.
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:37.760]  That's not how God operates.
[1:56:37.760 --> 1:56:40.760]  You don't get laser beams day one.
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:47.760]  You've got to first prove that you know how to put your socks on your boots on and build
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:50.760]  something big and strong and good that helps others.
[1:56:50.760 --> 1:56:52.760]  You have to be godly.
[1:56:52.760 --> 1:56:53.760]  You have to build.
[1:56:53.760 --> 1:56:57.760]  You can't be given the keys of the universe for no reason.
[1:56:57.760 --> 1:56:58.760]  I'm out of time.
[1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:00.760]  I really appreciate the crew coming in tonight.
[1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:06.760]  It's such a big victory that the head UN envoy of the COVID global task force came out and said the
[1:57:06.760 --> 1:57:11.760]  lockdown is killing people and needs to stop and that the economic shutdown is going to murder
[1:57:11.760 --> 1:57:12.760]  tons of people.
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:16.760]  Whether it's a cover his butt or whether a guy has a soul, whatever it is, it's the truth.
[1:57:16.760 --> 1:57:17.760]  It's a big, devastating victory.
[1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:22.760]  So next time you see a Libtard wearing a mask or bossing around how holy they are, you can shove this up
[1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:24.760]  their globalist keester.
[1:57:24.760 --> 1:57:28.760]  But listen, I appreciate you all coming up.
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:31.760]  Owen Stroyer and the rest of the A team have got Sunday Live.
[1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:36.760]  It's basically commercial free and it's coming up with your calls and a lot more.
[1:57:36.760 --> 1:57:39.760]  So spread those links and be part of the resistance.
[1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:40.760]  Band.video.
[1:57:40.760 --> 1:57:55.760]  Thank you.
