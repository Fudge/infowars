[00:54.320 --> 01:00.440]  and in the information we're gonna be rolling out here yes ladies and gentlemen Charlie Sheen
[01:00.440 --> 01:07.280]  did write the piece that you see up on info wars calm and prison planet calm right now and I
[01:07.280 --> 01:12.320]  suggest you go grab it off the site and mirror it on your blog or website or Facebook or my
[01:12.320 --> 01:19.360]  space because we've got record server load on our CDNs and I've got the two great IT guys in
[01:19.360 --> 01:27.640]  there doing a fabulous job trying to keep the sites up so get the information get it out to
[01:27.640 --> 01:35.840]  everybody this is only the beginning of a larger operation this is only the beginning coming up
[01:35.840 --> 01:44.160]  later today Charlie Sheen here on air with us then there is a video interview I conducted
[01:44.160 --> 01:50.760]  with Charlie Sheen that's coming up in the next few days and then another interview live on air
[01:50.760 --> 02:02.880]  with Charlie Sheen coming up as well why write a story where you have Charlie Sheen meeting with
[02:02.880 --> 02:08.680]  President Barack Obama that is the whole point this was the only way this was Charlie's idea
[02:08.680 --> 02:17.880]  completely his brainchild and I think it's genius was to write it as if they had the meeting with
[02:17.880 --> 02:25.240]  the little disclaimer at the bottom so that the media couldn't come twist or spin the radio
[02:25.240 --> 02:33.480]  interviews that's why the text the article comes first so that everyone is forced in mainstream
[02:33.480 --> 02:42.840]  media to look at the 20 bullet points that in the article he hands to President Barack Obama
[02:42.840 --> 02:59.040]  that's why the radio interview is coming after we published today the article now Charlie Sheen
[02:59.040 --> 03:08.240]  is formally asking to meet with President Barack Obama and he's also asking other prominent people
[03:08.240 --> 03:13.600]  in government in media in academia he's asking we are change he's asking 9-11 truth he's asking
[03:13.600 --> 03:18.160]  the libertarians that are one of the largest contingents at all the different tea parties and
[03:18.160 --> 03:24.680]  town hall events to go to press conferences to go to events and to bring up 9-11 truth and false
[03:24.680 --> 03:31.800]  flag staged terror false inflicted wounds self-inflicted wounds false flag terror
[03:31.800 --> 03:42.880]  you see all these massive national hit pieces taking place against 9-11 truth that's being
[03:42.880 --> 03:50.440]  done because the establishment is scared of the fact that the public worldwide not just the
[03:50.440 --> 03:57.800]  United States is discovering that most terror is completely staged or provocateur and there is no
[03:57.800 --> 04:02.080]  way the globalist can be able to set up their new world order without staging more terror attacks
[04:02.080 --> 04:12.440]  and so now it is essential that we expand and redouble our efforts in 9-11 truth so that we
[04:12.440 --> 04:18.520]  take the tool of stage terror and break it in front of the faces right in front of the new
[04:18.520 --> 04:26.280]  world order as Webster Tarpoli said at the 2006 live c-span event that we put on that then c-span
[04:26.280 --> 04:34.760]  taped and aired that public event we had now I'm gonna break all this down we get back Charlie

[07:59.080 --> 08:18.440]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[08:18.440 --> 08:31.080]  in the last month and a half as we develop this information warfare icbm
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.840]  in the fight to expose government sponsored false flag staged terror
[08:36.840 --> 08:47.480]  i was chomping at the bit to even let my own staff and crew know the details
[08:48.520 --> 08:54.120]  and then the last few days we posted the youtube video and the little article huge
[08:54.120 --> 08:57.720]  announcement coming tomorrow the info wars dot com prison planet dot com
[09:00.600 --> 09:04.760]  i have just so wanted this moment to come to be able to break all this down but by the very
[09:04.760 --> 09:12.520]  nature of what we're doing it had to wait until the piece was launched now charlie's idea was
[09:12.520 --> 09:19.480]  how do i write something that forces the mainstream media to look at the facts and
[09:19.480 --> 09:25.960]  the text and a bibliography exposing the fact that the 9 11 commission six of the 10 members 60
[09:25.960 --> 09:40.440]  percent and two of their councils out of five have come out on record stating that the entire
[09:40.440 --> 09:45.400]  commission was a fraud and a lie and that the pentagon was deliberately deceiving them and
[09:45.400 --> 09:50.760]  that bush was deliberately deceiving them and the entire thing was quote a cover up in the words of
[09:50.760 --> 09:55.960]  one of the commission members were we going over those quotes today the control corporate pressures
[09:55.960 --> 10:01.000]  continues to act like it's a conspiracy theory to question 9 11 when six of the 10 members of the
[10:01.000 --> 10:08.440]  commission appointed by bush said it was a cover up in a line well you do that by publishing an
[10:08.440 --> 10:17.240]  article that puts it into context of the president being face to face questioned about these issues
[10:17.240 --> 10:23.560]  and then in the piece charlie gives him the folders that have the research that have the
[10:23.560 --> 10:34.520]  material that have the facts that have the proof so that people who have never actually
[10:34.520 --> 10:41.720]  looked at the evidence 9 11 truth has can discover where we're really coming from and
[10:41.720 --> 10:46.840]  really look at the evidence and that's why i spent two trips to los angeles writing this
[10:46.840 --> 10:52.440]  with charlie he really wrote about 90 percent of it i was just there consulting on the data and the
[10:52.440 --> 10:59.640]  info and that's why i have spent so much time preparing for what we're now doing because
[10:59.640 --> 11:04.440]  charlie knows when when he went public in 2006 he knew he was going to be attacked
[11:04.440 --> 11:07.720]  and he had bill o'reilly and others go on tv and threaten him and basically say you're
[11:07.720 --> 11:14.040]  going to end up in the east river he had all sorts of stuff go on behind the scenes remember i
[11:14.040 --> 11:17.880]  told you i couldn't talk about what was happening with mark cuban and why he backed out of loose
[11:17.880 --> 11:24.280]  change final cut later it came out that the securities and exchange commission member
[11:24.280 --> 11:29.560]  called him and threatened him not to be involved and then sent him an email saying we're coming
[11:29.560 --> 11:34.040]  after you you 9 11 cook for what you've done we're coming after you criminally they then
[11:34.040 --> 11:40.840]  indicted him for insider trading on some tiny trade for a guy worth four or five billion dollars
[11:40.840 --> 11:46.680]  you know some some trade of like eight hundred thousand dollars that it came out was completely
[11:47.480 --> 11:53.320]  above board and kosher but this is the type of black ops we deal with ladies and gentlemen
[11:53.320 --> 12:00.920]  just trying to put that movie in theaters and when people ask you to have things off record
[12:00.920 --> 12:04.920]  that's what you have to do when you work as a journalist and as a filmmaker and it's somebody
[12:04.920 --> 12:14.200]  in the media people like oh you know the loose change final cut didn't end up in theaters
[12:15.400 --> 12:19.320]  the anti 9 11 truthers cheered people that are jealous of the work we do that claim they're
[12:19.320 --> 12:25.400]  9 11 truthers cheered which is pathetic because none of us have a future any future
[12:28.200 --> 12:33.000]  if we don't expose false flag terror because that's the foundation of the police state and the wars
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.560]  and the entire technological control grid the enslavement system the dehumanization control
[12:39.560 --> 12:46.360]  grid that is being put into place i mean charlie's a guy that makes 20 million dollars a year
[12:47.640 --> 12:52.440]  charlie's a guy that has a lot to lose charlie's a guy who's had people threaten him and tell him
[12:52.440 --> 12:58.920]  to shut up and tell him that he's going to be thrown to the wolves but because people resonated
[12:58.920 --> 13:07.400]  with his courage in 2006 and because we now have a new president charlie believes we have another
[13:07.400 --> 13:13.240]  shot at forcing this issue into the mainstream debate because if it's forced into the mainstream
[13:13.240 --> 13:18.760]  debate i mean we're risking our lives our names our treasure everything doing this especially charlie
[13:19.960 --> 13:25.160]  if we can force it out into the national debate that's in his 20 minutes with the president
[13:25.160 --> 13:30.120]  peace where six of the 10 9 11 commission members are saying the whole thing was a lie and a fraud
[13:30.120 --> 13:36.760]  and the government was covering up and it was a cover-up if we can do that it strikes one of
[13:36.760 --> 13:43.560]  the biggest single blows ever against this technological scientific dictatorship that
[13:43.560 --> 13:56.920]  we're all living under and living in charlie probably spent conservatively 200 hours on
[13:58.280 --> 14:04.280]  20 minutes with the president just the six days i was there two different trips working with him
[14:04.280 --> 14:10.680]  on this we worked from sun up until two three four in the morning one night going over the facts
[14:10.680 --> 14:14.360]  going over the evidence going over the research to put this together
[14:18.040 --> 14:26.840]  and to make it have enough flavor in it in the context of a meeting with him in the president
[14:26.840 --> 14:32.120]  that he would like to happen that the media would grab it and run with it
[14:35.160 --> 14:40.040]  and so we're on the front lines especially charlie sheen so pray for us and realize that
[14:40.040 --> 14:44.920]  this letter is only the opening salvo of what's going to be happening in the next month that's all
[14:44.920 --> 14:58.200]  i can say and in the fullness of time any questions you have will be answered but if you listen to
[14:58.200 --> 15:02.200]  the little video piece the two-minute piece we put out on youtube yesterday titled huge
[15:02.200 --> 15:07.640]  announcement coming tomorrow to infall wars and prison planet i explained that what's coming in
[15:07.640 --> 15:14.600]  the morning is only the beginning and so i'm asking everyone to get the article
[15:15.960 --> 15:20.360]  to get the story the report 20 minutes with the president by charlie sheen
[15:21.880 --> 15:27.000]  and to email it to fax it to all major media to post it all over the internet all over the entire
[15:27.000 --> 15:36.440]  web to email it to your local news talk stations to print copies of it up to bring it into your
[15:36.440 --> 15:40.040]  high school students to bring it into your college students to bring it into work to
[15:40.040 --> 15:47.880]  leave it at dental offices and hair salons we're going to be announcing a lot more
[15:47.880 --> 15:51.640]  throughout the week on this but this is only the opening salvo
[15:55.800 --> 15:59.960]  coming up at the bottom of the hour you're going to be hearing from charlie sheen
[15:59.960 --> 16:05.960]  in 14 minutes they're going to be hearing from charlie sheen right here on the year
[16:09.640 --> 16:11.160]  and then he's going to be back with us
[16:13.880 --> 16:19.400]  and back with us live on friday as well and there's a video interview that is coming out later in
[16:19.400 --> 16:31.240]  the week before friday on thursday this is so essential this has been thought through
[16:31.240 --> 16:34.840]  i don't want to give our entire strategy away to the establishment media or
[16:36.840 --> 16:44.680]  the people that tune into our telephone conversations but for anyone who's thinking
[16:44.680 --> 16:50.440]  person out there they can probably imagine how this was designed why it was done the way it was
[16:53.080 --> 17:01.080]  bottom line it is to get the 20 bullet points out in 20 minutes with the president so the
[17:01.080 --> 17:08.520]  site on this and the vision on this and the understanding on this is 2020 20 points 20 minutes
[17:08.520 --> 17:15.240]  with president barack h obama and charlie sheen star wall street platoon two and a half men
[17:19.080 --> 17:20.360]  the list goes on and on
[17:24.520 --> 17:33.960]  is asking the president of the united states to meet with him now he's got the courage he's put
[17:33.960 --> 17:38.280]  it all online he's asking you the listeners of this show he came to me to do this because he
[17:38.280 --> 17:44.680]  said he he knew that i had the most informed most active best people out there and he gives a shout
[17:44.680 --> 17:51.080]  out to we are change la we are change new york everybody 911 truth everybody the activist the
[17:51.080 --> 17:58.600]  ron paul supporters everyone to go to all the media events to go to the press conferences to go to
[17:58.600 --> 18:05.640]  the town hall meetings and to bring 20 minutes with the president printed up or on a desk and to
[18:05.640 --> 18:14.920]  give it to people and to tell them these questions demand answers we are demanding the truth we are
[18:14.920 --> 18:23.160]  demanding that the real evidence be looked at you know you ever noticed all these history
[18:23.160 --> 18:33.240]  channel and discovery channel and 60 minutes and pbs a and e have you noticed all these hit pieces
[18:33.240 --> 18:37.160]  national geographic try to only focus on the collapse of the towers and other things that
[18:37.160 --> 18:42.040]  are technical that they can try to whitewash and fool people who don't have a engineering
[18:42.040 --> 18:46.600]  background because if they get into all the other evidence of the commission members saying it was a
[18:46.600 --> 18:52.280]  fraud in the line or if they get into the operation north woods or gulf of tonkin being staged or the
[18:52.280 --> 18:59.080]  drills that day and nor had been told to stand down or if they get into the history of government
[18:59.080 --> 19:08.120]  sponsored terrorism it's over and so again ladies and gentlemen a full bibliography with charlie
[19:08.120 --> 19:15.720]  sheen's 20 minutes with the president he is asking president maraca san obama to meet with him but
[19:15.720 --> 19:20.760]  regardless by putting this letter out in the form of a meeting between charlie sheen and the president
[19:20.760 --> 19:27.240]  it creates the mental vision the mental picture the mental idea just like you know the top olympic
[19:27.240 --> 19:32.760]  athletes visualize something it's not magic they're visualizing it because what humans visualize
[19:32.760 --> 19:38.920]  they build they construct and so by that image the president is now confronted with the fact
[19:38.920 --> 19:43.800]  that he's whitewash 9-11 and the torture and the police state everything else is in this letter
[19:43.800 --> 19:49.400]  charlie sheen is throwing down the gauntlet and declaring war on the lie that is 9-11
[19:49.400 --> 19:54.760]  and the new world order we're going straight into a huge storm here and we can be victorious
[19:54.760 --> 19:59.800]  if you get behind us and ride beside us more details of this historic action straight ahead

[25:13.400 --> 25:17.640]  because we did that all our problems would be solved bandwidth wise believe me ladies and
[25:17.640 --> 25:22.760]  gentlemen i spend 25 to 30 thousand dollars a month on bandwidth and we just don't have the
[25:22.760 --> 25:26.920]  money to go to the next level to be able to handle giant spikes like this so our guys are doing the
[25:26.920 --> 25:34.200]  best possible job we have over a million people on the sites right now at one time over a million
[25:34.200 --> 25:40.360]  people right now at info wars dot com and prism planet dot com together 700 000 on info wars more
[25:40.360 --> 25:47.320]  than 400 000 on prism planet and so we're gonna have to shut the comments down that won't erase
[25:47.320 --> 25:54.440]  them but it'll have to shut them down because that's what really generates the most bandwidth
[25:54.440 --> 26:00.600]  other than images so i'm having to sit here and deal with this this is you know we're not
[26:00.600 --> 26:06.600]  fox or cnn with a billion dollar budget we have a million dollar budget every year and that barely
[26:06.600 --> 26:13.480]  pays for it all i don't know what's 12 times 25 30 000 just in bandwidth a couple hundred
[26:13.480 --> 26:20.680]  thousand dollars what is it 250 300 thou we'll calculate our up jaren how many how much how much
[26:21.880 --> 26:25.960]  what's 12 times 25 000 not counting the two it guys so it's really about
[26:25.960 --> 26:32.760]  it's more than that it's easily 30 000 a month what's 12 times 30 000 400 000 that's where most
[26:32.760 --> 26:37.240]  the money goes that's why i have to get up here and constantly push sponsors and constantly push
[26:37.240 --> 26:44.040]  everything just grubbing around trying to get the money to throw coal into this furnace on this big
[26:44.040 --> 26:50.520]  locomotive and i've got up at maximum speed rattling down the tracks at over 100 miles an hour
[26:50.520 --> 26:56.920]  on a collision course with the new world order that's why i appreciate all your support
[26:57.320 --> 26:59.320]  i don't know i'm getting off into minutiae it's just
[27:02.920 --> 27:06.760]  we can launch something this big the question is can we keep the platform up to fully deliver
[27:06.760 --> 27:13.080]  the info weapon will our icbm fired at the new world order complex it's already left the atmosphere
[27:13.080 --> 27:19.560]  but will it trajectory correctly over the pole and then detonate coming back into the atmosphere
[27:19.560 --> 27:26.280]  launching its mirv payload on the lies that is up to you ladies and gentlemen
[27:29.240 --> 27:35.400]  get it out to every media outlet every media group call every radio talk show in your area
[27:35.400 --> 27:41.640]  tell them about it give it to them and say charlie sheen wants to have a meeting with the president
[27:41.640 --> 27:46.920]  this is the evidence in his letter he would present to him and this even studied obama
[27:46.920 --> 27:53.080]  thinking what obama would probably say in the meeting the type of whitewash answers we actually
[27:53.080 --> 27:59.880]  went and pulled up quotes of obama and very close paraphrases to things he's actually said white
[27:59.880 --> 28:06.760]  washing 911 incredible research went into this just to show how we put out the evidence we put
[28:06.760 --> 28:11.080]  out the facts and they just call it a conspiracy theory he says to the president in the letter
[28:11.080 --> 28:15.560]  charlie sheen does well what about all these six of the ten commission members saying the whole
[28:15.560 --> 28:19.160]  things are fraud in the line obama says we've got to move forward as a nation
[28:23.960 --> 28:25.320]  that's exactly what they do
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.400]  but this whole thing was designed and tailor made for the media to grab a hold of it and to run with
[28:35.400 --> 28:45.320]  it and we'll explain the psychology in the days to come but the point is this we're on the cutting
[28:45.320 --> 28:51.160]  edge of engaging the new world order charlie sheen is just an amazing individual you know i got to

[29:07.080 --> 29:11.480]  to watch him spend day after day focused researching the guys like a

[29:18.520 --> 29:26.920]  sheen is not what the distorted media over the years has betrayed him as he's a very focused

[34:17.800 --> 34:22.920]  actor demands investigation be reopened after majority of 9-11 commission members say government
[34:22.920 --> 34:28.840]  lied about the official story paul joseph watson prison planet dot com actor and television star
[34:28.840 --> 34:33.560]  charlie sheen has publicly requested a meeting with president barack obama to urge him to
[34:33.560 --> 34:40.520]  reopen the official investigation into 9-11 in light of the fact that the majority of the 9-11
[34:40.520 --> 34:44.440]  commission members have now publicly gone on record to express their convictions the government
[34:44.440 --> 34:48.840]  agreed to lie about the official story that's a quote by the general counsel of the commission
[34:50.120 --> 34:55.640]  sheen's request takes the form of a letter to president in the context of a fictional meeting
[34:55.640 --> 35:02.200]  between the two entitled 20 minutes with the president published exclusively on radio talk show
[35:02.200 --> 35:08.760]  host alex jones info wars dot com and prison planet dot com the letter cites evidence backed up by his
[35:08.760 --> 35:14.120]  substantial online bibliography that proves the official story behind 9-11 is a fraud and this
[35:14.120 --> 35:21.000]  conclusion was also reached by the majority of the 9-11 commission members a fact that mandates
[35:21.000 --> 35:28.520]  president obama to reopen the investigation into the terror attacks sheen expressed his hope
[35:28.520 --> 35:36.360]  that the president barracusan obama will follow through on his promise of change accountability
[35:36.360 --> 35:42.600]  and government transparency by using his executive power to reexamine 9-11 adding that he voted for
[35:42.600 --> 35:46.760]  obama with the understanding that he would follow a different course in the bush administration
[35:46.760 --> 35:51.240]  however the sheen highlights in his letter the course of obama's first year in office clearly
[35:51.240 --> 35:56.760]  indicates that he will do nothing to reverse policies crafted by the bush regime and in fact
[35:56.760 --> 36:04.680]  has sought to exceed the outrages of the previous administration in areas such as warrantless
[36:04.680 --> 36:11.160]  wiretapping rendition detention without trial and wars in the middle east all of which arrived
[36:11.160 --> 36:16.680]  as a consequence of 9-11 and i was listening to uh what's left of air america on xm this morning
[36:18.840 --> 36:23.080]  and two different shows once i went to the store this morning and woman i was driving into work
[36:23.080 --> 36:27.720]  we're talking about bush being a mass murderer for being an iraq in afghanistan and now he's so
[36:27.720 --> 36:31.800]  evil but they're not pointing out that obama's actually expanded that see it's it's just
[36:31.800 --> 36:39.480]  schizophrenic double thing sheen's letter is a public declaration demanding the truth behind 9-11
[36:41.640 --> 36:45.880]  as america approaches its eighth anniversary since the tragic events of that day
[36:45.880 --> 36:50.120]  his questions are shared by the majority of victims of the family members of 9-11
[36:50.120 --> 36:56.440]  according to bill dole the representative of the largest 9-11 family's group the letter
[36:56.440 --> 37:02.040]  focuses around the fact that no less than 60 percent of the 9-11 commissioners have now publicly
[37:02.040 --> 37:06.680]  stated that the government agreed not to tell the truth about 9-11 that the pentagon was engaged
[37:06.680 --> 37:13.240]  in deliberate deception about the response to the attack sheen also presents a plethora
[37:13.240 --> 37:19.480]  of other evidence to illustrate how the official story is a fraud including the revelations of
[37:19.480 --> 37:24.440]  whistleblowers like fbi translator civil edmunds who recently broke a federal gag order to expose
[37:24.440 --> 37:29.640]  how ben laden and al qaeda were working for the u.s government right up until the day of 9-11
[37:30.520 --> 37:34.040]  none of that's in the mainstream media is it but see this his letter puts this all out there
[37:36.600 --> 37:39.240]  folks we're risking our lives here i hope you understand that
[37:39.240 --> 37:49.960]  it but the cost is total slavery for our children if we don't so that's why we're doing it
[37:50.520 --> 37:55.880]  the issues highlighted by sheen do not represent idle speculation or conspiracy fodder they are
[37:55.880 --> 38:00.440]  documented facts that have been deliberately ignored by the straw man 9-11 truth hit pieces
[38:00.440 --> 38:04.680]  that are now doing the rounds again as the anniversary approaches particularly last month's
[38:04.680 --> 38:09.720]  9-11 science and conspiracy which was aired by the national geographic channel and wasted little
[38:09.720 --> 38:14.440]  time portraying people who have doubts about the 9-11 official story as extremist cranks
[38:15.080 --> 38:19.560]  while failing to acknowledge that the majority of the members of the 9-11 commission have publicly
[38:19.560 --> 38:25.720]  expressed similar concerns and called for a new investigation charlie sheen is once again using his
[38:25.720 --> 38:31.000]  prominent public platform in an attempt to expand a national debate about the disturbing unanswered
[38:31.000 --> 38:36.600]  questions behind 9-11 having first spoken out on the issue in march of 2006 on this radio show
[38:37.480 --> 38:41.400]  after he first went public sheen was asked to do more and now he is doing more
[38:42.120 --> 38:45.560]  as he feels there is a chance to get more traction behind a new investigation
[38:45.560 --> 38:49.960]  with a new president in the white house even if you don't believe obama will do anything which
[38:49.960 --> 38:55.880]  we don't believe really well the issue is it's a new president new issue put it in his face at
[38:55.880 --> 39:01.880]  press conferences and nancy polosi's press conferences at republicans press conferences this is a
[39:01.880 --> 39:06.280]  revolution a peaceful revolution of information warfare with the sword of the truth ladies and
[39:06.280 --> 39:11.240]  gentlemen this is a call to arms in the infill war for all good men and women that love their
[39:11.240 --> 39:15.000]  country on this planet and want to stop the technocrats the scientific dictatorship from
[39:15.000 --> 39:24.120]  staging more terror attacks sheen is directly appealing to barack obama to read his letter
[39:24.120 --> 39:29.080]  and to look into the lies surrounding 9-11 for himself and see that's one reason sheen wrote
[39:29.080 --> 39:33.320]  the letter as if it was a meeting between the two knowing that that would get more attention
[39:35.720 --> 39:42.360]  and that president obama will definitely see it regardless of whether or not president obama
[39:42.360 --> 39:47.800]  agrees to meet with sheen charlie is confident that his letter will serve as a catalyst from
[39:47.800 --> 39:52.360]  which questions surrounding 9-11 and other false flag events will be brought to national attention
[39:52.360 --> 39:58.200]  this is a call to action a declaration of war on the lies of 9-11 that have formed the foundation
[39:58.200 --> 40:03.640]  of the endless wars abroad and the police stated home as the republic falls sheen is demanding
[40:06.280 --> 40:12.120]  the truth activist and those who simply care about the future of the country stand up beside him
[40:12.120 --> 40:17.240]  and speak truth to power sheen is now urging grassroots political organizations and individuals
[40:17.240 --> 40:22.200]  across the country such as the town hall protesters and we are change groups to go to press
[40:22.200 --> 40:26.120]  conferences and other public events and demand answers about the truth behind 9-11
[40:28.440 --> 40:32.040]  as much awareness as possible around the issue of false flag terrorism needs to be generated
[40:32.040 --> 40:37.000]  in order to prevent tragedies like 9-11 from happening again sheen emphasizes that his letter
[40:37.960 --> 40:44.680]  that we cannot let 9-11 become ancient history try to forget about it and just move on because
[40:44.680 --> 40:50.040]  if a nation forgets its history then it is doomed to repeat it we cannot allow governments to continue
[40:50.040 --> 40:59.160]  to advance their political agendas by exploiting forged pretext argues sheen
[41:02.120 --> 41:07.880]  and the fact that big budget hit pieces against 9-11 truth are still being rolled out proves
[41:07.880 --> 41:12.120]  that the establishment is upset that the population is waking up the false flag terror
[41:14.200 --> 41:17.800]  so the empire is struck back against 9-11 truth as you notice they think it's deep politicized
[41:17.800 --> 41:21.000]  because bush is gone they think we're going to go quietly to the night that they think they can go
[41:21.000 --> 41:26.760]  in and rewrite history again it's not happening sheen will appear live on the elec shown show
[41:26.760 --> 41:32.200]  on wednesday and friday to discuss the content of his 20 minutes with the president piece and how
[41:32.200 --> 41:37.000]  he plans to move forward with this exciting new initiative you can listen free to or subscribe

[41:43.400 --> 41:47.400]  begging the thinking public to look at how many members on the 9-11 commission itself have
[41:47.400 --> 41:52.040]  questioned the official story along with scores of other highly credible former and current government
[41:52.040 --> 41:56.600]  officials intelligent professionals military officials scientists structural engineers and
[41:56.600 --> 42:01.160]  architects and legal scholars who have all publicly denounced the fraud that continues
[42:01.160 --> 42:07.720]  to masquerade as the official 9-11 story or media request on the subject email sheen at info wars
[42:07.720 --> 42:13.400]  dot com sheen at info wars dot com and if it's legitimate real media we will contact you back

[43:39.080 --> 43:44.280]  it and uh this is a little nod to everybody but the reason i'm gonna play this is listen to how i
[43:44.280 --> 43:50.280]  explain yesterday that what you see today is only the beginning and if we don't let the psyopsin
[43:50.280 --> 43:54.120]  come and tell pro get us in fighting with each other and diverted distracted and we move forward

[44:00.760 --> 44:04.760]  but it's just going to get bigger and bigger if you go viral with this and you pick up the call
[44:04.760 --> 44:11.240]  and this is a guy who gets paid a half million dollars an episode and two or three times that
[44:11.240 --> 44:15.560]  in a syndicated shows i don't even i i haven't know the numbers it's unbelievable this is somebody
[44:15.560 --> 44:22.120]  putting a career worth hundreds of millions of dollars on the line you understand people always
[44:22.120 --> 44:25.720]  say oh where's hollywood you know where where are they if they know where's bruce willis yes my
[44:25.720 --> 44:29.080]  films were given to bruce willis you are a director award-winning director richard link
[44:29.080 --> 44:32.440]  letter without me even prompting him he goes oh i gave your videos to bruce willis when he was here
[44:32.440 --> 44:37.720]  in austin and then he sent me bruce willis his email that bruce then sent him after he left town
[44:37.720 --> 44:42.520]  and say no i won't be a stooge of the right wing anymore i'm awake now you know the same folks that
[44:42.520 --> 44:48.680]  killed kennedy are the ones that uh are involved running things today and now he shattered the
[44:48.680 --> 44:52.440]  left-right paradigm people didn't believe me and then three months later he was in vanity fair
[44:52.440 --> 44:58.440]  saying the same thing we know keanu reeves is awake i'm in a film with him consulted on scander
[44:58.440 --> 45:04.600]  darkly he was awake back in 2005 when we shot the film the keanu is very very private
[45:08.120 --> 45:10.840]  woody herlson knows what's going on in 911 truth i'll just leave it at that
[45:13.240 --> 45:18.840]  and other hollywood people even bigger than them know but they don't have the courage that charlie
[45:18.840 --> 45:30.040]  sheen does as much as i like them they don't have the courage the real diehard is charlie sheen
[45:31.560 --> 45:38.840]  the real diehard is charlie sheen he's the real guy out there doing it putting an all in the line
[45:38.840 --> 45:44.280]  you have no idea you think the white house on record new york times a year and a half after i
[45:44.280 --> 45:49.320]  told you about it i just could only tell you vagaries i said yeah that mark cuban was threatened i
[45:49.320 --> 45:53.320]  can't you know and those were private meetings and that's all i can say and then it came out the
[45:53.320 --> 46:00.840]  white house had the a senior members is in the new york times like let's tell what's an email
[46:00.840 --> 46:05.960]  instead i forget the headline i want to read that later call up mark cuban and emailing
[46:07.160 --> 46:11.080]  and say you son of a bitch you better not do anything with 911 truth in that film
[46:11.080 --> 46:18.520]  we're coming after you and then they indicted him a year later and then he used that that
[46:18.520 --> 46:24.120]  email and that phone call in court to shut down that fake prosecution you think this is a game
[46:24.120 --> 46:30.600]  we're playing here ladies and gentlemen it's one thing to sit there and talk the talk ladies and
[46:30.600 --> 46:34.760]  gentlemen but we walk the walk here and all glory goes to the creator of the universe
[46:34.760 --> 46:41.400]  and i asked for a hedge of protection to be put up around myself charlie and everybody else involved
[46:41.400 --> 46:45.160]  in this fight because i don't even want to get into the latest stuff that's been going on behind
[46:45.160 --> 46:48.680]  the scenes yes they've been listening to our phones yes they were aware of it yes they let us
[46:48.680 --> 46:54.920]  know they were aware of it that we bit the bullet we gave them a whole nine yards
[46:54.920 --> 47:04.760]  whole nine yards that was the uh 26 27 feet whatever it was in a b17 the machine gun belts was uh
[47:05.960 --> 47:09.640]  nine yards nothing to do with football that terminology given something the whole nine
[47:09.640 --> 47:13.800]  yards was like when they come back from a big battle they'd say yeah we gave them the whole nine yards
[47:13.800 --> 47:27.640]  or given them the whole nine yards the whole thing and it's up to you how big this gets right now
[47:30.520 --> 47:32.520]  it's up to you ladies and gentlemen
[47:37.800 --> 47:42.120]  and charlie sheen is asking hollywood people people he talks to i mean i i've talked to
[47:42.120 --> 47:46.120]  so many folks in hollywood they all know 9-11's an inside job they all call me your patent on the
[47:46.120 --> 47:49.800]  back it just scores of people and and and i talked to other people in hollywood and they say oh yeah
[47:49.800 --> 47:55.960]  everybody knows about it and neighbors and in charlie's hollywood Beverly Hills gated community
[47:55.960 --> 48:00.360]  come up to him in his yard and say you know great job you got a lot of courage but they don't have
[48:00.360 --> 48:07.720]  the courage if we all stand up you know the quote from ants in fact john harman you you have that
[48:07.720 --> 48:11.560]  in the computer don't you that quote from ants where the grasshoppers are sitting there with their
[48:11.560 --> 48:15.480]  bellies poached out with big piles of grain and they say why don't we just stay here there's plenty
[48:15.480 --> 48:19.480]  of food here why are we going back to beat up those ants you know we don't need them as slaves
[48:19.480 --> 48:24.760]  and the head grasshopper says because those little puny ants outnumber us a hundred to one
[48:24.760 --> 48:28.680]  and if they ever and if they ever figure out that they can stand up against us
[48:30.760 --> 48:35.960]  then our way of living is over and that's exactly what happened so charlie sheen
[48:35.960 --> 48:43.000]  he is the first big huge a level star top tv show top films you know in the new wall street
[48:43.000 --> 48:50.520]  coming out all of it to do this when oliver stone is putting out 911 whitewash pieces
[48:50.520 --> 48:53.640]  and i'm not trying to be mean to oliver stone but just give me a break making films about how
[48:53.640 --> 48:59.720]  great chavez is give me a break give me a break all that control leftist stuff that's not rebellion
[48:59.720 --> 49:06.760]  against tyranny charlie sheen's the bona fide he's the real deal he's the real mccoy he's the guy you
[49:06.760 --> 49:10.440]  you know have a hundred million dollars out there at risk and throw it all on the table
[49:14.040 --> 49:20.360]  yeah let's see you do that charlie sheen is one of the few real people in a true power position
[49:20.360 --> 49:26.760]  that didn't sell out that i never met in my life i was never to sell out from the beginning but i
[49:26.760 --> 49:30.200]  was a nobody and i've clawed my way up to be able to get the little bit of attention
[49:30.200 --> 49:34.680]  we're able to get to expose the globalist and stand right in the face of the new world order
[49:34.680 --> 49:40.360]  david versus goliath who's with me who's standing with me and if they take me out who's going to
[49:40.360 --> 49:48.680]  take my place who's going to stand beside me there's a reason the southern prairie law center
[49:48.680 --> 49:54.840]  attacks me number one there's a reason that george sorrell's funded media matters and daily costs
[49:54.840 --> 50:03.320]  and think progress and alternate attack me every day because they know i'm for real and they know
[50:03.320 --> 50:09.080]  we're taking the globalist on and they know we're having a big effect on them and in your gut you
[50:09.080 --> 50:12.200]  know that we're on the front lines and you know we've got a good chance of bringing these people
[50:12.200 --> 50:15.960]  down if we believe in victory and if we realize the power we have look at how we're shooting down
[50:15.960 --> 50:19.640]  their global carbon tax takeover their socialist healthcare takeover look how we're exposing their
[50:19.640 --> 50:24.920]  flu fraud look how we're exposing 9-11 as an inside job look how we're going after them boldly
[50:26.200 --> 50:31.240]  going in through and beyond with a shield of truth and the sword of love
[50:33.720 --> 50:37.720]  and honor and everything that's good charlie sheen from the bottom of my heart my friend i love you

[55:10.040 --> 55:15.400]  that it's not about food it's about power it's about domination it's about control
[55:15.400 --> 55:24.440]  20 minutes with the president
[55:27.080 --> 55:33.080]  written to ensure it gets on the desk of president barack obama and written as a blueprint for the
[55:33.080 --> 55:40.760]  key questions and and the answers and the proof that the six of the 10 911 whitewash commissioners
[55:40.760 --> 55:47.160]  appointed by bush coming out saying it was a total takeover and a lie think about
[55:49.320 --> 55:54.360]  the magnitude reading from 20 minutes with the president charlie sheen on pages two and three
[55:55.240 --> 56:02.200]  sir speaking in the letter are the statements as well from commission co-chairman thomas
[56:02.200 --> 56:07.400]  key and lee hamilton commissioners bob carry timothy roemer and john leeman as well as the
[56:07.400 --> 56:14.360]  statements of commissioner max cleland from georgia who resigned stating it's a national scandal
[56:14.360 --> 56:19.240]  this investigation is now compromised one of these days we will have to get the full story
[56:19.240 --> 56:25.000]  because the 9 11 issue is so important to america but this white house wants to cover it up
[56:27.320 --> 56:32.680]  he also described president bush's desire to delay the process and not damage the o4 reelection bid
[56:32.680 --> 56:37.000]  they suspected deception to the point where they considered referring the matter this is
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.840]  from the washington post they suspected deception to the point where they considered referring
[56:40.840 --> 56:45.240]  the matter to the justice department for criminal investigation mr president this information
[56:45.240 --> 56:55.320]  alone is unequivocal grounds for a new investigation and charlie originally got the idea from an
[56:55.320 --> 57:02.200]  article in the washington post written as if his father had interviewed president obama
[57:05.560 --> 57:09.960]  i forget the name of that article i need to pull that up because this way it puts it all
[57:09.960 --> 57:14.760]  in context in the lazy public that won't read some 20 page document with a bunch of links to
[57:14.760 --> 57:23.080]  documents will now read this and now look at it this was the best way to get massive attention
[57:23.080 --> 57:30.760]  to it and for charlie to then publicly say hey i wrote this basically the way i think this meeting
[57:30.760 --> 57:35.560]  would go in a way to present my evidence to the president and now i want to meet with you president
[57:35.560 --> 57:43.800]  but regardless this is meant to reinvigorate and expand the debate about false flag terrorism
[57:43.800 --> 57:50.680]  and that is exactly what's happening i mean it's not kooky or crazy to read the quotes

[1:03:11.080 --> 1:03:16.920]  okay now think about this just having charlie sheen on your radio show or tv show because he
[1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:22.360]  doesn't do a lot of media it is big that's a big story for any radio show to have him coming out
[1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:27.800]  boldly for 911 truth after the fact that it was top news story off and on for three months on fox
[1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:32.760]  and cnn with all the attack pieces against him and that he would come out a second time but even
[1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:37.880]  bigger and more bold and all the work that was put into this 20 minutes with the president and the
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:42.280]  bibliography and the 20 bullet points that give you a 2020 birds eye of you what really happened
[1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:52.280]  on 911 it is nothing short of ultra massive ultra massive is the word and again more is going to be
[1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:56.840]  breaking throughout the week that letter is only the beginning but we're not doing a whole bunch
[1:03:56.840 --> 1:04:03.320]  of the interviews today because we want the focus to be on the 20 minutes with the president piece
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:10.280]  that's up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com when i say this is the biggest thing i've
[1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:16.520]  ever done think about how we did the obama joker info wars dot com contest from berlin to tokyo
[1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:23.880]  from london to austin texas from san francisco to areas in latin america german tv you name it
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:29.000]  it showing people the power just putting posters up now people are putting other posters other
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:32.600]  ideas they're just getting politically active they're going out the grassroots it's showing
[1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:37.000]  people the power they have through the poster revolution this is going to be much bigger
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:41.720]  it's already going to be a big news story but that's not the main issue that's the detonator
[1:04:41.720 --> 1:04:46.600]  from a larger explosive in the info war it's you going out the town halls the meetings the congressional
[1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:51.400]  meetings calling in to talk radio and bringing up the fact that six of the 10 members of the

[1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:31.800]  we just began simulcasting the radio show live on the web at info wars dot com prison planet
[1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:39.160]  dot com from prison planet dot tv 20 minutes with the president written by charlie sheen
[1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:43.720]  written in the context of a meeting he would like to have with the president
[1:08:44.360 --> 1:08:50.520]  and the proof and the evidence that we have a cover-up taking place surrounding the tragic
[1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:56.600]  attacks of 9 11 we're coming up on the eighth anniversary of those tragic attacks here in
[1:08:56.600 --> 1:09:02.440]  just a few days 9 11 has been used as the pre-taxist set up homeland security to launch wars in
[1:09:02.440 --> 1:09:08.040]  afghanistan iran now going into pakistan it has been used to put the body scanners that scan
[1:09:08.040 --> 1:09:13.160]  your neck and body in the airports it's been used to put out the dhs reports now saying right
[1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:18.760]  wingers gun owners libertarians ron paul supporters are terrorists in the mayak and dhs reports that
[1:09:18.760 --> 1:09:25.320]  we broke when police and others gave us those documents including a federal marshal they said
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:29.560]  it was for foreigners you know supposed terrorists and then now they admit it's for us the american
[1:09:29.560 --> 1:09:37.480]  people all of this has been done on the back of 9 11 and obama promised to end the wars he
[1:09:37.480 --> 1:09:42.120]  promised to stop the torture and secret arrest and indefinite attention he's expanding all of that
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:46.680]  and in his letter to the president charlie sheen in 20 minutes with the president
[1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:53.480]  sheen lays all that out and it has a bibliography that links to the washington post the associated
[1:09:53.480 --> 1:10:04.680]  press to videos to audio of six of the 10 members it's hard to label their dissension
[1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:10.760]  as infighting or as a conspiracy theory when six of the 10 members are statements of fact
[1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:21.480]  and you look at what the different members of the commission said the statements from
[1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:26.360]  commission co-chairman thomas kenan lee hamilton commissioners bob carrey timothy roemer john
[1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:30.680]  leeman as well as statements from commissioner max cleland the next senator from georgia
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:36.520]  who resigned stating it's a national scandal this investigation is now compromised one of these days
[1:10:36.520 --> 1:10:41.000]  we will have to get the full story because the 9 11 issue is so important to america but the
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:47.640]  white house wants to cover it up six of the 10 saying this and two of the five lawyers the council
[1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:52.280]  members saying they wanted to refer it to the justice department for criminal cover-up by the
[1:10:52.280 --> 1:10:57.640]  white house of the pentagon deliberately lying and covering up these are quotes he also described
[1:10:57.640 --> 1:11:02.120]  president bush's desire to delay the process is not to damage the o4 election bid they suspected
[1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:05.640]  deception to the point where they considered referring a matter to the justice department
[1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:10.200]  for criminal investigation mr president this information alone is unequivocal grounds for a
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:18.120]  new investigation we're going to go over these quotes coming up in the next hour by the commission
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:22.200]  members that is only a small part of what's covered in 20 minutes with the president
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:28.200]  and we have this article up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com charlie sheen requests
[1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:34.520]  meeting with obama over nine one one cover up and he's asking activists to go out to the town

[1:11:54.120 --> 1:11:59.000]  six of the 10 members said needed to be done six of the 10 members called for an investigation
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:05.160]  saying it was all a fraud a cover up a criminal cover up these are quotes this has to be responded

[1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:26.520]  barack obama to meet with him and to look at the facts in this fictional meeting he wrote up with
[1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:33.400]  the president as a way to frame the information and present it he hands the president several
[1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:40.600]  folders of evidence there's links in the 20 bullet points in the 20 minutes with the president
[1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:45.000]  that give you a 2020 birds eye view of what really happened so the public themselves
[1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:49.240]  in the 20 minutes with the president is being briefed as if they were the president being
[1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:56.200]  given the research the material the most focused the most research damning evidence of 9 11 being

[1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:18.120]  ratcheted up this is a call to action a peaceful revolution of information the co until pro is
[1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:22.280]  going to go crazy the establishments going to attack this the neocons the george soros crowd
[1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:26.360]  the control left the control right and the establishment will try to attack through her the
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:33.320]  patriot liberty 9 11 truth ranks using co until pro using agents of influence using jealousy
[1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:38.600]  doesn't matter you just move forward get this out charlie sheen requests meeting with president
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:46.280]  obama over 911 cover up actor demands investigation be reopened after majority of 9 11 commission
[1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:53.640]  members say government lied about official story and yes we've had some media call here to the
[1:13:53.640 --> 1:13:58.520]  office of tv and radio and print saying is charlie sheen really write this letter is you're
[1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:04.760]  really asking for the meeting yes member charlie sheen came on this show maybe we should rear
[1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:12.760]  that today later came on this radio show in 2006 twice he went to our public 9 11 truth event with
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:19.000]  over 1200 people in los angeles at the charleton downtown la and yes he's going to be live on
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:22.440]  this show several times this week and there's going to be a videotape interview with charlie
[1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:28.040]  sheen but we didn't want to have all that come out today because we want the main focus to be
[1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:32.120]  on the 20 minutes with the president because he knows the media is going to try to go in
[1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:38.440]  and dissect what he says in a live interview twist it distort it so he wants it to be on
[1:14:38.440 --> 1:14:44.040]  the 20 minutes because that has the evidence and the documentation and it's put in the context
[1:14:44.040 --> 1:14:47.640]  of the discussion and debate he'd like to have with the president so it would go viral
[1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:53.880]  let's go ahead now and just play a minute and a half clip more is coming up
[1:14:54.840 --> 1:15:03.560]  with charlie sheen where i interviewed him at his home here it is charlie it's great to be here
[1:15:03.560 --> 1:15:08.520]  with you i appreciate you are doing this interview likewise alex thank you why after three years of
[1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:15.080]  silence concerning 9 11 are you now speaking up and why have you written this public letter that
[1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:24.920]  you've now published well alex uh i wrote this letter for for two reasons firstly i i i wanted
[1:15:24.920 --> 1:15:32.760]  to create a public document specifically rooted in fact uh if anybody dares question that i i i
[1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:40.760]  would encourage those people to to to scrutinize to research it uh that the truth is unchanging
[1:15:40.760 --> 1:15:46.840]  alex as we both know uh the only aspect of this piece that that had to be manufactured with the
[1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:53.640]  president's words everything else will withstand the critical assault i'm more than prepared to
[1:15:53.640 --> 1:16:00.280]  endure and secondly um this is our first new president since 9 11 and then consequently his
[1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:08.360]  first 9 11 anniversary in office um enough stonewalling enough media manipulation of
[1:16:09.080 --> 1:16:16.120]  media mantra speak the families deserve better alex america deserves better i mean come on
[1:16:16.760 --> 1:16:22.600]  come on people the 9 11 commission report is a blatant work of manipulation secrecy and fiction
[1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:30.600]  come on the time is now demand the truth i personally cannot stand idly by any longer
[1:16:30.600 --> 1:16:35.080]  and pretend like a of a new investigation is just going to fall out of the heavens right
[1:16:35.080 --> 1:16:40.120]  into our congress we have to take action we have to stand as one we must insist that our
[1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:46.600]  new president deliver on his promises all right and that is from a 20-plus minute interview
[1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:52.120]  again taped interviews video interviews live interviews all coming up this week more coming
[1:16:52.120 --> 1:17:00.680]  up later that is actor director family man freedom lover charlie sheen and i will give you again the
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:11.640]  same quote that i quoted live on cnn with a j hammer back in 2006 the mark twain quote
[1:17:13.080 --> 1:17:19.880]  in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared and scorned but in time when his cause
[1:17:19.880 --> 1:17:26.840]  succeeds the tim had joined him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot charlie sheen we salute
[1:17:26.840 --> 1:17:32.040]  your courage we salute what you've done and we salute everybody out there that is taking 20
[1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:37.960]  minutes with the president and the other article charlie sheen requests meeting with obama over
[1:17:37.960 --> 1:17:45.880]  911 cover-up and getting it out to everybody right now this is so so essential if you missed
[1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:50.840]  part of that or just tuned in coming up later that will do it right at the bottom of the hour
[1:17:51.560 --> 1:17:58.120]  i will re-air that and it will also take that snippet where i just introduced it and played it
[1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:03.000]  and posted up on the alex jones channel on youtube and also in higher quality for folks that
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:08.920]  we're watching live at prisonplanet.tv and this will all be archived up on the site today i want
[1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:12.280]  to get into the statements by six of the 10 9 11 commission members saying it was a cover-up in
[1:18:12.280 --> 1:18:18.840]  the line of fraud i want to get into two of the five councils the lawyers saying it was all a fraud
[1:18:18.840 --> 1:18:23.480]  in the line they knew it was a criminal cover-up and i want to go over the 20 minutes with the
[1:18:23.480 --> 1:18:28.920]  president coming up today as well then we're going to open the phones up they're not open
[1:18:28.920 --> 1:18:36.040]  right now they're not open yet so that is coming up ladies and gentlemen
[1:18:36.040 --> 1:18:45.000]  this is just amazing though to to to be part of this and to be here seeing this happening because
[1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:49.800]  if if other prominent people and just the general public learn that they could put posters up on
[1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:53.880]  street corners they can call in to talk radio they can go to town halls that they can go to
[1:18:53.880 --> 1:18:57.720]  events it will bring the system to its knees what have i always said people say what are solutions
[1:18:57.720 --> 1:19:03.720]  i see local control we have 30 plus states moving or who've already passed resolutions against federal
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:10.200]  incursions violating the tenth amendment 800 plus cities i had the idea to have cities and counties
[1:19:10.200 --> 1:19:14.120]  and states pass laws against the patriot act saying the bill of rights the constitution
[1:19:14.120 --> 1:19:17.160]  was still alive in their cities that's been implemented all over the country just because
[1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:25.080]  i had that idea you took the ball ran with it think about 9 11 truth day one i came on air
[1:19:25.080 --> 1:19:29.720]  and i said they staged the attacks go public we've got a found 9 11 truth to tell the truth
[1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:34.040]  that they'll stage more terror attacks and use this for total control again another example of
[1:19:34.040 --> 1:19:39.240]  the vision the idea taking action it's simple i know history i knew we could have victories and
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:43.080]  the last year i've been saying go to more than that i've been saying go to city halls go to county
[1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:48.040]  commissioners go to public events go see your congressman all those videos of me back in the
[1:19:48.040 --> 1:19:52.840]  late 90s confronting congressman loy dogged and others by myself now it's hundreds doing it
[1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:58.600]  that's the idea the people seeing the power they have this is about the people standing up we'll

[1:24:10.200 --> 1:24:19.160]  20 minutes with the president by charlie sheen
[1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:30.680]  it is up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and it's done in the format of a conversation
[1:24:30.680 --> 1:24:38.120]  with the president so that people will actually read it all and look at it and ask themselves
[1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:42.920]  why this is never asked to the president asking themselves why there hasn't been a new investigation
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:45.960]  you put out another article of the tens of thousands that have been put out laying on all
[1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:51.880]  the facts it gets ignored this way it will be get a lot of attention that's how public relations
[1:24:51.880 --> 1:24:56.120]  works and that's why we've done it this way that's why charlie sheen has done it this way
[1:24:56.840 --> 1:25:00.600]  and we're going to be putting out a press release in the next hour again we're asking
[1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:06.920]  everybody to go to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and get 20 minutes with the president and
[1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:13.480]  email it out to everybody get it out to everybody post it everywhere ladies and gentlemen this is
[1:25:13.480 --> 1:25:18.760]  so important coming up i'm going to play that clip of charlie sheen again talking about why he
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:23.480]  wrote 20 minutes with the president and again he's coming up live tomorrow and then on friday we
[1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:31.160]  have a video i shot with charlie a week and a half ago out in los angeles where he speaks directly
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:35.720]  well you'll see i'm not i'm going to leave that as a surprise ladies and gentlemen
[1:25:35.720 --> 1:25:41.320]  and again there's 20 minutes with the president is only the opening salvo to get the president's
[1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:47.560]  attention a genius idea really is genius by charlie sheen and i can't wait to see how the media
[1:25:48.120 --> 1:25:54.520]  and the co-intel pro try to spend this but that'll only give us more attention so it's also designed
[1:25:54.520 --> 1:25:59.320]  really to have the neocons and other people attack it and take the bait and they and they just can't
[1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:04.840]  help themselves so again all the people attacking that only feeds in to making it that much bigger
[1:26:04.840 --> 1:26:08.520]  of a story that's what we're counting on you want to be quite honest and then i'm not letting any
[1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:13.720]  secret out there the establishment is uh knows how things work but they just can't help themselves
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:19.960]  send it to bill o'reilly send it to shon hannity try to call into shon hannity show try to call
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:24.200]  into bill o'reilly we quit his radio show somebody listened to it call into glenn beck
[1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:29.080]  get him to discuss it get him to talk about it in fact there's a video i want to play coming up
[1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:38.200]  to really show people who the real glenn beck is glenn beck neocon not uh libertarian and so we will
[1:26:38.840 --> 1:26:46.920]  go over that as well but again this is done in the context of an open letter to the president
[1:26:46.920 --> 1:26:51.560]  of the conversation charlie sheen would like to have with him he is asking for the meeting
[1:26:51.560 --> 1:26:57.480]  and charlie wrote this the way he sees politicians with their canned answers many of these answers
[1:26:57.480 --> 1:27:03.160]  are actual answers are paraphrased answers that obama and bush and other politicians have given
[1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:07.160]  when they've been confronted with these issues or even small pieces of this they just say oh it's a
[1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:13.880]  conspiracy don't look at it it's not a conspiracy theory that six of the 10 9 11 commission members
[1:27:13.880 --> 1:27:18.040]  and two of the five council members the lawyers have come out saying it's complete cover up and a
[1:27:18.040 --> 1:27:24.360]  complete fraud and we're going to the 20 minutes with the president first so that in the context of
[1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:30.040]  this people will look at the evidence in the bibliography that is what this is all about
[1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:36.040]  then of course the establishment will take debate to want to attack charlie sheen i mean he really
[1:27:36.040 --> 1:27:39.800]  is the perfect person because they'll love a few things in his background to go after him charlie
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:48.280]  knows that uh it's about the information in the letter though as he said in the piece describing
[1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:55.080]  it 20 minutes with the president so we're going to come back and uh read over 20 minutes with
[1:27:55.080 --> 1:28:00.600]  the president it's uh very very lengthy pretty lengthy you know how many pages is it one two three
[1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:09.960]  four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen pages long if
[1:28:09.960 --> 1:28:19.480]  you want to get technical it's about 15 and a half pages long and it is already spreading
[1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:25.880]  all over the web i want to thank everybody it's already a huge success just uh four hours into
[1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:35.320]  its launch today and it's even more perfect that they happen to be hyping up the whole van
[1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:39.880]  jones thing he was going to resign over calling republicans names over saying he was a communist
[1:28:39.880 --> 1:28:46.520]  over saying that it's really total wealth redistribution uh the green jobs is to take over
[1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:51.000]  the economy that by the way is in the news today i'm going to cover some of that so the media is
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:55.320]  really hyped to attack 9-11 truth but what's going to happen is when they attack this the 20
[1:28:55.320 --> 1:29:01.400]  minutes with the president thinking it's something they can attack it's like a poison pill they grab
[1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:06.360]  onto it like a fish and go oh look you know charlie didn't really talk to the president well it says
[1:29:06.360 --> 1:29:11.640]  right there he didn't but it says this is the meeting he'd like to have and then people in mass
[1:29:11.640 --> 1:29:17.000]  will see the evidence in it within the second page read those quotes with links to the wash and post
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:20.680]  under maturing publications where the 9-11 commission members are saying it's a complete
[1:29:20.680 --> 1:29:26.600]  total fraud 60 percent of the 9-11 commission members and what's two out of five with the
[1:29:26.600 --> 1:29:35.400]  uh council members what is that 35 percent or two fifths all right ladies and gentlemen

[1:34:06.040 --> 1:34:11.640]  back to the clip where he explains the letter here it is charlie sheen charlie it's great to be here
[1:34:11.640 --> 1:34:16.600]  with you i appreciate you are doing this interview likewise alex thank you why after three years of
[1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:23.160]  silence concerning 9-11 are you now speaking up and why have you written this public letter that
[1:34:23.160 --> 1:34:33.000]  you've now published well alex uh i wrote this letter for for two reasons firstly i i i wanted
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:41.080]  to create a public document specifically rooted in fact if anybody dares question that i i i would
[1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:49.160]  encourage those people to to to scrutinize it to research it uh that the truth is unchanging alex
[1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:55.400]  as we both know uh the only aspects of this piece that had to be manufactured with the president's
[1:34:55.400 --> 1:35:03.400]  words everything else will withstand the critical assault i'm more than prepared to endure and secondly
[1:35:03.400 --> 1:35:10.200]  um this is our first new president since 9-11 and they consequently his first 9-11 anniversary
[1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:20.120]  in office um enough stonewalling enough media manipulation of media mantra speak the families
[1:35:20.120 --> 1:35:26.600]  deserve better alex america deserves better i mean come on come on people the 9-11 commission
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:34.920]  report is a blatant work of manipulation secrecy and fiction come on the time is now demand the truth
[1:35:34.920 --> 1:35:41.480]  i personally cannot stand idly by any longer and pretend like a of a new investigation is just
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:46.760]  going to fall out of the heavens right into our congress we have to take action we have to stand
[1:35:46.760 --> 1:35:53.320]  as one we must insist that our new president deliver on his promises all right charlie sheen
[1:35:53.320 --> 1:35:58.280]  and he is asking you he's going public he's asking for a meeting with the president he wrote an
[1:35:58.280 --> 1:36:05.320]  article with the facts in it of what he believes that meeting might be like and 20 minutes with
[1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:09.080]  the president get it out to everybody and the article charlie sheen requests meeting with
[1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:17.800]  obama over 9-1-1 cover up it's up to you the ball is in your court ladies and gentlemen the
[1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:22.680]  the establishment will try to divert distract turn all their armies to come and tell pro people lose
[1:36:22.680 --> 1:36:31.400]  that's because they're scared of this information and this is only the opening salvo okay and for
[1:36:31.400 --> 1:36:35.720]  the mainstream media calling yes charlie sheen wrote the letter he wrote the piece and you just
[1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:40.200]  heard charlie sheen saying that right there the media will even try to deny that charlie sheen
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:46.040]  even wrote that letter that it appears to be one of the spins that they are putting out which is
[1:36:46.040 --> 1:36:50.600]  what we expected and look for all sorts of i mean if they threaten to arrest mark cuban over this
[1:36:50.600 --> 1:36:54.600]  behind the scenes just talking about putting out loose change final cut with me charlie and loose
[1:36:54.600 --> 1:36:59.880]  change guys god knows what they'll try here we know we're going into very very serious storm
[1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:05.720]  here but we're doing it because no pain no gain fortune favors the bold and the fortune we want
[1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:11.320]  is liberty and freedom for our children and our children's children for our future now i've got
[1:37:11.320 --> 1:37:17.640]  some media i need to talk to and we're working on some other issues i'm gonna while i did that for
[1:37:17.640 --> 1:37:20.840]  five minutes we're gonna play this glenn beck piece i was stunned by how good it was last night
[1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:26.200]  when i saw it it's up on info wars dot com showing you the fake right wing how bet comes in and says
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:31.640]  he's anti-new world order but then at key areas at key points he supports the banker takeover bail
[1:37:31.640 --> 1:37:38.760]  out he says arrest patriots he badmouts ron paul and it's got some clips showing napolitano who's
[1:37:38.760 --> 1:37:43.320]  got a much better record of actually being a patriot than glenn beck does and i guess that's
[1:37:43.320 --> 1:37:47.480]  why napolitano they kind of keep him on the internet for fox tv and occasionally fills in for bek
[1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:53.160]  uh so i want to play this clip we'll see what glenn beck does with his charlie sheen situation
[1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:58.600]  and we're gonna queue up that 19 that that 2006 interview uh with charlie sheen and play a little
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:38:07.240]  bit of that and then coming up 20 minutes with the president uh so here is the video titled glenn
[1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:15.400]  beck is a neocon on a libertarian here it is the patriot act is the most dastardly direct assault
[1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:23.000]  on human liberty and on guaranteed rights in the constitution that the congress ever enacted
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:29.800]  since the alien institution acts 200 years earlier all efforts by the government to bail
[1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:35.240]  out private industry are unconstitutional the reasons are profound they're grounded in the
[1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:45.480]  grounded in the constitution i'm a dope i'm a rodeo clown i'm a recovering alcoholic
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:56.440]  i believe so deeply in our constitution i was for the patriot act you know that i am actually
[1:38:56.440 --> 1:39:01.960]  a libertarian at heart i think the bailout is the right thing to do i believe so deeply in our
[1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:08.360]  constitution i was for the patriot act you know that i am actually a libertarian at heart the
[1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:15.000]  700 billion dollars that you're here about hearing about now is not only utterly necessary
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.960]  it is also not nearly enough there was one guy last year that was ron paul
[1:39:23.240 --> 1:39:28.760]  when you were on cnn you would act like he was kind of crazy kooky guy and i still act like
[1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:35.720]  he's crazy kooky guy well the ron paul revolution i think it's meant to be a catchy slogan but i
[1:39:35.720 --> 1:39:41.320]  fear some of his fringe supporters are taking the word revolution to literally hey glenn real quick
[1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:46.040]  how did you and your network benefit from associating ron paul supporters with domestic terrorism
[1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:53.400]  when you were exported out after asking your question lenbeck stops turned to crowds started
[1:39:53.400 --> 1:40:01.720]  plotting you're about to hear is the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment this is the glenn
[1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:09.720]  back program the man has total credence when it comes to the economy the man does not necessarily
[1:40:09.720 --> 1:40:15.480]  have credence when it comes to the war on terror and tim there suggests that uh we we think of the
[1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:20.520]  economy but not in foreign policy you can't do that they're they're one of the same that's where
[1:40:20.520 --> 1:40:26.920]  all the money's going if you've seen any of the uh the stuff that glenn back has been doing
[1:40:27.640 --> 1:40:32.200]  these are these uh we don't on occasion as a democrat which are religious fanatics
[1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:40.840]  does hitler come to mind for the love of our children and they are preparing a holocaust uh
[1:40:40.840 --> 1:40:53.800]  the second holocaust earlier today i had the opportunity to sit down in the oval office
[1:40:53.800 --> 1:40:58.840]  with the president of the united states president bush is a man who personally feels the pain of
[1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:04.760]  every lost soldier i can tell you that the president has incredible passion and resolve
[1:41:04.760 --> 1:41:13.720]  those weapons of mass destruction got to be somewhere

[1:43:55.720 --> 1:44:00.920]  to a little bit of montages of the interview i did with charlie sheen and some of the cnn clips
[1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:07.080]  here it is ladies and gentlemen plus a charlie sheen's shocker tonight the actor's stunning
[1:44:07.080 --> 1:44:13.160]  statements on 9 11 maybe the airplanes did not take down the twin towers and maybe the government
[1:44:13.160 --> 1:44:18.840]  is covering it all up taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75 percent of their targets
[1:44:19.640 --> 1:44:24.520]  that feels like a conspiracy theory showbiz tonight investigates the startling allegations
[1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:30.840]  of course uh you remember where you were on september 11 oh absolutely aj i was at work at cnn
[1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:36.520]  in atlanta and i remember being in complete and utter shock and dismay yeah i was uh working as well
[1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:42.200]  here in new york city and like most people just thinking this is absolutely unbelievable well
[1:44:42.200 --> 1:44:46.920]  there's another thing that you may not believe about september 11th and what someone is saying charlie
[1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:53.320]  sheen star of cbs's successful sitcom two and a half men says point blank 9 11 the pentagon the
[1:44:53.320 --> 1:44:58.840]  world trade center all a cover-up is this for real well showbiz tonight has the tape that has people
[1:44:58.840 --> 1:45:06.680]  asking what's the truth the more you look at stuff especially uh specific incidents specific
[1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:13.880]  events um in our uh around the papal day it's just um it just raises a lot of questions charlie sheen
[1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:19.160]  has his own questions about 9 11 and showbiz tonight has obtained the explosive interview
[1:45:19.160 --> 1:45:24.760]  from the radio show of fringe journalist alex jones sheen normally gets laughs as the bachelor on
[1:45:24.760 --> 1:45:33.880]  hit cbs sitcom two and a half men wow you're even better than a dog but now sheen is courting
[1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:39.960]  controversy by questioning the official story on 9 11 we're not the conspirator conspiracy theorists
[1:45:39.960 --> 1:45:47.880]  on this particular issue you know it seems to me like you know 19 amateurs with box cutters
[1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:54.040]  taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75 percent of their targets that feels like a
[1:45:54.040 --> 1:46:01.000]  conspiracy theory so what exactly are sheen's questions about 9 11 for one sheen is questioning
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:06.120]  the official story of what caused the world trade center collapse that the impact of the two planes
[1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:11.160]  caused fires that weaken the building support columns in the interview sheen says he wondered
[1:46:11.160 --> 1:46:16.600]  if the buildings could have been brought down by a deliberate yes deliberate implosion i saw the
[1:46:16.600 --> 1:46:22.360]  south tower hit live um that famous wide shower disappears behind the building and then we see
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:31.480]  the tremendous fireball it was just a there was a feeling that uh it just didn't look how do i say
[1:46:31.480 --> 1:46:40.120]  this um didn't look like a any commercial jetliner i've flown on anytime in my life um and then when
[1:46:40.120 --> 1:46:46.440]  the buildings came down later on that day i was with my brother i was and i said hey call me insane
[1:46:47.080 --> 1:46:53.880]  but did it sort of look like those buildings came down in a in a controlled demolition sheen is
[1:46:53.880 --> 1:46:59.560]  also questioning how a commercial airliner could have hit the pentagon show us this incredible
[1:46:59.560 --> 1:47:06.520]  maneuvering just show it to us just show us you know how this particular plane pulled off these
[1:47:06.520 --> 1:47:12.040]  maneuvers what was it it's 270 degree turn at 500 miles an hour descending 7000 feet in two and a
[1:47:12.040 --> 1:47:19.560]  half minutes just giving across the treetops the last 500 meters you can't get off the ground
[1:47:20.200 --> 1:47:25.240]  sheen also jumped on a favorite target of 9 11 conspiracy theorists president bush
[1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:30.520]  sheen questions why the president after an aide told him about the attacks continued with his
[1:47:30.520 --> 1:47:38.600]  florida school appearance it seemed to me that uh upon the revelation of that news the secret
[1:47:38.600 --> 1:47:46.520]  service would grab the president and remove him um as if he were on fire from that room ever since
[1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:51.000]  that horrible day conspiracy theories about the attacks have spread far and wide through the
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:56.600]  internet as writer webster tarply tells showbiz tonight sheen is not alone in his opinions
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:48:03.080]  there was a soggy poll that was carried out last august actually august of 2004 by now which showed
[1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:09.400]  that about 50 percent of the people in new york city believed that top government officials had
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:15.880]  knowledge in advance of what was going to happen still it's safe to say that most experts and
[1:48:15.880 --> 1:48:22.440]  most americans place the blame for 9 11 only on a sum of bin laden and al-qaeda not the u.s government
[1:48:22.440 --> 1:48:28.360]  even she knows his comments may not go over well with many people and i'm sure i'm being demonized

[1:53:59.480 --> 1:54:19.240]  at the next level here's that new york times article that came out over a year after we gave
[1:54:19.240 --> 1:54:23.240]  you the skinny and what was going on behind the scenes of the persecution of charlie sheen and
[1:54:23.240 --> 1:54:29.400]  then mark cuban by the bush white house behind the scenes saying sending him emails calling him
[1:54:29.960 --> 1:54:33.480]  the securities exchange commission saying we're going to come after you not even saying about
[1:54:33.480 --> 1:54:42.040]  what we're going to investigate you if you don't not do this movie you better not release loose
[1:54:42.040 --> 1:54:47.320]  change final cut or we're going to come after you and then a year after they did that they
[1:54:47.320 --> 1:54:54.760]  indicted him and he fought him and they had to drop it because he had the email and he swore
[1:54:54.760 --> 1:55:01.400]  in court to the phone call the threatening phone call that's what the kind of stuff we go through
[1:55:01.400 --> 1:55:05.800]  to try to bring you this information you know if it's just stupid conspiracy theories why would
[1:55:05.800 --> 1:55:12.600]  the white house talk about an enemy's list go after billionaires like mark cuban insider trading
[1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:22.920]  or political persecution and it goes through that article and you can go read it for yourself so
[1:55:22.920 --> 1:55:28.840]  that's the type of bravery that charlie sheen has knowing all this went on behind the scenes
[1:55:28.840 --> 1:55:32.200]  and then it came out the mainstream news exactly as we had said it had happened it did
[1:55:33.080 --> 1:55:37.240]  kind of like when i tell you the fbi's been here but i'm under a gag order and can't talk about it
[1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:41.640]  then later it comes out in the associated press why if this is the real world folks we're here at
[1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:48.520]  the front lines we're dealing with killers here we bring you this information so i'm asking listeners
[1:55:48.520 --> 1:55:53.320]  to please go to info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and get 20 minutes with the president

[1:56:02.440 --> 1:56:07.960]  and tell them that we want these answers responded to don't just call conspiracy theories when six of
[1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:12.680]  the 10 911 commission members are saying that the official story was a lie and a fraud and
[1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:17.160]  that they wanted to have criminal prosecution of the pentagon in the white house for covering up
[1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:21.080]  all those quotes are in the 20 minutes with the president piece that charlie sheen wrote
[1:56:24.440 --> 1:56:30.440]  and then there's this story from prison planet dot com charlie sheen requests meeting with obama
[1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:34.920]  over 911 cover up actor demands investigation be reopened after majority of 911 commission members

[1:59:58.280 --> 2:00:12.680]  network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:00:13.320 --> 2:00:21.640]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:21.640 --> 2:00:29.800]  well the headlines out there are that the united states faces an argentina
[2:00:29.800 --> 2:00:34.280]  style evaluation of the dollar i hope that's not the case but for years we've explained
[2:00:34.280 --> 2:00:39.480]  the bankers would implode their banking ponzi scheme then get tens of trillions more of the
[2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:45.000]  people in debt by saying they had to be bailed out than using that money to loan it back to the
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:49.480]  governments that's right we give them our money and then we pay them interest to get our own money
[2:00:49.480 --> 2:00:55.560]  back and that's what's happened 23.7 trillion that number is almost two months old it's over
[2:00:55.560 --> 2:00:59.560]  two trillion a month and counting so that was a month and a half ago it was 23.7
[2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:07.400]  close to 28 trillion i predict next time the number comes out and back when it was 13 trillion i
[2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:11.800]  was predicting it'd be 16 trillion and it came out it was 18 trillion when it was 18 trillion and
[2:01:11.800 --> 2:01:17.240]  0.7 i was predicting it'd be 22 trillion and it was 23.7 trillion so it's probably when it comes
[2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:23.160]  out going to be 28 trillion or more because every two months or so the numbers come out and we're
[2:01:23.160 --> 2:01:27.320]  set to get them again in the next few weeks and then obama as things implode are going to say see
[2:01:27.320 --> 2:01:31.960]  we got to have an emergency reorganization north com standing by and don't riot in the streets
[2:01:31.960 --> 2:01:36.040]  because the flu is bad we got to have you for quarantines they've got all that in place in
[2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:41.880]  case they need it and they could stage terror attacks that's why charlie sheen's done 20 minutes
[2:01:41.880 --> 2:01:48.200]  with the president as a way for the public to read it and charlie saying i want this meeting
[2:01:48.200 --> 2:01:55.000]  with the president and here are the facts but that's only salvo one there's the interviews coming up
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:02:00.360]  with charlie sheen including live interviews wednesday that's tomorrow thursday and friday the
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:06.200]  video interview we taped is uh thursday world exclusive right here and it's he really turns the
[2:02:06.200 --> 2:02:12.920]  heat up uh in that interview look at this article barack obama accused of making depression mistakes
[2:02:12.920 --> 2:02:17.000]  london telegraph they haven't made mistakes this is all by design they're getting ready to blame him
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:22.200]  like he's herbert hoover and we say that in the obama deception that he's being built up to godlike
[2:02:22.200 --> 2:02:27.480]  status to be destroyed people laughed at me when that came out in march what five six months ago
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:32.520]  six months ago now people aren't laughing and think of the next messianically that they're
[2:02:32.520 --> 2:02:36.120]  going to bring in some phony right wing and then boy the republicans are going to think they've had a
[2:02:36.120 --> 2:02:39.880]  big victory the republican grassroots are going to think this person's the savior and they're
[2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:44.840]  going to be even worse and then even even more evil democrat will come after that it's the same
[2:02:44.840 --> 2:02:52.920]  paradigm the same program in particular the authors and economist charles rally of george
[2:02:52.920 --> 2:02:59.320]  mason university said it's it is also not impossible the us will experience the kind of
[2:02:59.320 --> 2:03:03.240]  economic collapse at first third world status experience by argentina under the national
[2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:09.640]  socials government of one perone heron i mean that's the type of news and information we've got
[2:03:09.640 --> 2:03:16.200]  we told you about this and oh don't fear monger oh you know the banks can print an issue 23.7
[2:03:16.200 --> 2:03:22.840]  trillion it's no problem no that money is now going out into the economy and it is devaluing it
[2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:29.560]  ladies and gentlemen and the globalist are buying real assets with it before it's devalued
[2:03:29.560 --> 2:03:33.720]  and then once it hits the street she said they get us coming and going they got all our money
[2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:37.160]  loan it back to us in interest and then when it implodes the currency they've already bought
[2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:42.360]  into real assets and commodities and that's why after lindsay williams prediction of bill de
[2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:46.520]  berger was the intel we had they were going to lower it then jack it back up it's now happening
[2:03:47.320 --> 2:03:51.640]  he said for at least a year will be low now that year is over we see gold going up we see oil
[2:03:51.640 --> 2:03:55.800]  going up we see every major commodity going up and then i see all over national news they say oh
[2:03:55.800 --> 2:04:01.480]  yes it's not an oxymoron to have a growing economy and and to be in a boom we're going out of the
[2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:08.360]  recession but to have fewer jobs and more people in soup lines and unemployment yes a jobless recovery

[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:28.200]  crises on record and they caught over and over again and they bring it all to a head
[2:08:28.200 --> 2:08:32.680]  in a massive period of change they're now going to try to set up the open bank of the world after
[2:08:32.680 --> 2:08:36.440]  they implode our economy in the dollar they're now looking like they're going to go ahead and do it
[2:08:36.440 --> 2:08:41.480]  in the fall or winter that's all over mainstream news today it's all up on info wars dot com and
[2:08:41.480 --> 2:08:46.920]  prison planet dot com if you want to link three to link through to it and find it all in one spot
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:53.000]  they are moving on every front and we believe they're going to stage terror attacks unless
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:57.160]  we expose it and that's the main reason charlie sheen has gone public with his 20 minutes with
[2:08:57.160 --> 2:09:02.600]  the president written as if he met with him so people will then go and read the article and
[2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:06.120]  see why charlie wants to meet with him and the evidence he'd like to present
[2:09:06.840 --> 2:09:10.680]  because he does want to have a meeting with the president and he's asking other people to go public
[2:09:11.960 --> 2:09:17.000]  and a lot more is coming up throughout the week i'm going to read 20 minutes with the president
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:26.440]  coming up here in just a few minutes but before i do that a lot of people requested this so i'm
[2:09:26.440 --> 2:09:29.080]  just going to hear about 10 minutes of it then i'm going to read 20 minutes with the president
[2:09:29.080 --> 2:09:35.480]  then get into all the economic news and open the phones up but i want to go ahead and just
[2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:42.040]  play a little bit of that first interview from april of 2006 we played one of the CNN clips
[2:09:42.040 --> 2:09:47.960]  earlier here is part of that interview from prisonplanet.tv with charlie sheen they've got a lot
[2:09:47.960 --> 2:09:52.520]  of people emailing me saying this isn't even charlie sheen in the letter and that charlie sheen
[2:09:52.520 --> 2:09:56.520]  has never been on the show there's a lot of dis info going on out there yes charlie sheen's been
[2:09:56.520 --> 2:10:01.400]  on the show so is willy nelson so just even to her all these other people yes he's an iron
[2:10:01.400 --> 2:10:05.640]  loving truther yes this is huge and i'm going to explain why it's huge after we air a few minutes of
[2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:13.880]  this here it is he's been in over 65 major motion pictures produced them written them
[2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:22.920]  from platoon to red dawn one of my favorites and of course tv shows like spin city right now he's
[2:10:22.920 --> 2:10:30.760]  the major star on the cbs program two and a half men and he's got several new movies coming out
[2:10:30.760 --> 2:10:37.240]  this year and next year and when i got a chance to talk to charlie sheen i was just amazed because
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:40.360]  i've talked to a lot of other big hollywood people we've had a few of them on this show
[2:10:41.080 --> 2:10:44.840]  and you know they call me up sometimes say hey you're doing a great job or i'm
[2:10:44.840 --> 2:10:50.120]  or i'm buying 50 copies your video and i'm like no here just take it and but but but they're not as
[2:10:50.120 --> 2:10:53.480]  informed i have to be honest as charlie sheen i mean i talked to this guy like an hour and a half
[2:10:53.480 --> 2:10:59.560]  yesterday and he just really knows uh what's going on on the planet today but that shouldn't
[2:10:59.560 --> 2:11:06.120]  surprise me his father martin sheen has been on the front lines uh as mark twain said in the beginning
[2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:11.080]  a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared and scorned but in time when his cause succeeds
[2:11:11.080 --> 2:11:15.880]  the timid joined him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot and of course has been proven right
[2:11:15.880 --> 2:11:20.120]  time and time again it was his father and the in the days leading up to the war that was the most
[2:11:20.120 --> 2:11:25.320]  vocal spokesman in america against this disastrous conflict everything he said has now come true
[2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:31.880]  and of course um charlie sheen and his brother uh are also activists in their own right and we are
[2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:36.760]  just incredibly honored to have charlie sheen on with us for the balance of this hour mr sheen good
[2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:44.040]  to have you with us nice to be here alex how are you i'm i'm great mr sheen you have some questions
[2:11:44.040 --> 2:11:50.600]  about the official 9 11 story and uh we got uh hooked up because we both mutually have been
[2:11:50.600 --> 2:11:59.000]  looking into that and i want to just um i guess start by uh what happened on 9 11 what your instincts
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:05.560]  told you and uh really uh just go from there well it was interesting um and and let me just
[2:12:05.560 --> 2:12:11.960]  preface that by saying that um i've been a fan of yours for a long time and i've been following you
[2:12:11.960 --> 2:12:17.800]  and i've been i've seen all of your documentaries and your your your research is is is tireless and
[2:12:17.800 --> 2:12:25.000]  and it's interesting because a lot of these guys you sort of look behind the notes and you start
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:31.480]  to discover inconsistencies in a lot of the claims that they're making um which pretty much torpedo
[2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:38.920]  is the credibility of most of their substance but with you uh that's not the case and i was always
[2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:47.000]  amazed to see that you always had hard data to back up your claims and so you know this was tough
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:53.960]  for me because um for the longest time i've been doing my own independent research and
[2:12:55.320 --> 2:13:01.480]  you know um i don't claim to be an expert in any of these fields but just as a as a concerned uh
[2:13:02.360 --> 2:13:10.440]  upstanding tax paying american citizen there's just uh there's questions i have um that i wish
[2:13:10.440 --> 2:13:18.360]  somebody could um explain a way for me there's things that that one will will view and then
[2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:25.240]  look at the the keen commission's official report and it's just um as i heard somebody once say
[2:13:25.880 --> 2:13:31.720]  might have been you uh there's holes in the story you could fly a bowing jet through oh there
[2:13:31.720 --> 2:13:36.840]  certainly is in fact we were talking yesterday and you said over the phone that that the biggest
[2:13:36.840 --> 2:13:43.400]  conspiracy theory is the official story i mean at every point it's a fabrication it's a lie would
[2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:50.440]  you elaborate on that well yeah it's like they they want to just pigeonhole all of us into this
[2:13:50.440 --> 2:13:57.960]  group of conspiracy nutbags um when we're not really debating things that are related to
[2:13:57.960 --> 2:14:07.880]  ufo's uh bringing down the towers or building seven or the pentagon right and so um it's just um
[2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:16.440]  you know it just feels like um you know there's there's things in there that that we're not the
[2:14:16.440 --> 2:14:24.760]  conspiracy conspiracy theorists on this particular issue you know it seems to me like you know 19
[2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:30.280]  amateurs with box cutters taking over four uh commercial airliners and hitting 75 percent of
[2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:36.280]  their targets that feels like a conspiracy theory well i tell you back in 2001 everybody admits
[2:14:36.280 --> 2:14:41.880]  that cell phones didn't work over 3 000 feet how were they working at 33 000 32 000 feet how did
[2:14:41.880 --> 2:14:47.320]  how did al-qaeda make norad stand down did al-qaeda call marie willie brown of san francisco as the
[2:14:47.320 --> 2:14:53.000]  chronicle reported and and and say don't fly to new york no the white house did uh did uh did al-qaeda
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:57.160]  call salman russia and say don't fly to new york on september 11th no the times of one reported
[2:14:57.160 --> 2:15:03.000]  that the white house did did uh did al-qaeda run drills cia and pentagon drills in the morning
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:07.960]  of 9 11 of hijack jets hitting those exact same targets those exact same times and then drills
[2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:15.480]  the day before and drills two weeks before yeah the answer to that would be probably not um
[2:15:15.480 --> 2:15:24.600]  um but um now it's just it's just um the the the more you look at stuff especially uh specific
[2:15:24.600 --> 2:15:32.520]  incidents specific events um in or around the fateful day it just um it just raises a lot of
[2:15:32.520 --> 2:15:39.720]  questions there's a lot of questions and i know that um a couple of years ago it was uh you know
[2:15:39.720 --> 2:15:46.600]  severely unpopular to discuss any of this um but it sort of feels like just in my research
[2:15:46.600 --> 2:15:53.880]  and in the people that i talk to and in and around my circles um seem like the worm is turning
[2:15:54.840 --> 2:16:02.520]  because you start talking about this even with uh conservative republicans um and it can't really
[2:16:02.520 --> 2:16:11.480]  debate away uh some of the most obvious uh facts on that day let me ask my radio producer a question
[2:16:11.480 --> 2:16:18.280]  i did did you find that clip of uh dan rather let me just roll this little 30 second clip because
[2:16:18.280 --> 2:16:23.320]  this is what dan rather thought about 20 seconds after building seven collapse they they backed the
[2:16:23.320 --> 2:16:27.800]  tape up and played it and this is what he said live go ahead and roll it and again what you're
[2:16:27.800 --> 2:16:34.040]  seeing are high shots now here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself
[2:16:34.040 --> 2:16:41.720]  describe that now we go to videotape the collapse of this building it's amazing incredible if you
[2:16:41.720 --> 2:16:48.280]  were for the third time today you wouldn't listen to those pictures we've all seen too much in
[2:16:48.280 --> 2:16:53.080]  television before when a building was deliberately destroyed destroyed by well-placed anime could
[2:16:53.080 --> 2:16:58.760]  knock it down all right so it there's dan rather than that's what i thought that morning that's
[2:16:58.760 --> 2:17:05.000]  what engineers the heads of engineering colleges uh that's what a lot of people said uh charlie
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:16.120]  what did you think on that morning well uh where do we start i um i was up early actually and we
[2:17:16.120 --> 2:17:24.280]  were going to do a pre-shoot on spin city the show i used to do and so gosh i was up and i was
[2:17:24.280 --> 2:17:33.160]  watching the news and uh the north tower was burning and so you know the the the world was
[2:17:33.160 --> 2:17:39.240]  focused on what i guess they were assuming to be pilot error right or some tragedy nobody
[2:17:39.240 --> 2:17:46.840]  could really explain and so i saw i saw the south tower hit live um that famous wide shower
[2:17:46.840 --> 2:17:52.920]  disappears behind the building and then we see the tremendous fireball you know um it was just a
[2:17:53.560 --> 2:18:03.080]  there was a feeling that uh it just didn't look how do i say this um it didn't look like a any
[2:18:03.080 --> 2:18:09.720]  commercial jetliner i've flown on anytime in my life um and then when the buildings came down
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:16.440]  later on that day as my brother i was at my parents house and um we're out on the deck
[2:18:17.160 --> 2:18:24.520]  and i said hey call me insane but did it sort of look like those buildings came down in a in a
[2:18:24.520 --> 2:18:30.680]  controlled demolition and he said well kind of but gosh that's impossible if you think about
[2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:38.280]  what it would take for them to orchestrate that and so as the as the days and the weeks went on um
[2:18:39.160 --> 2:18:44.360]  i was sort of told what to believe and i was told through mainstream media and all of the
[2:18:44.360 --> 2:18:49.240]  talking heads about what really happened now charlie when the press when the press you know
[2:18:49.240 --> 2:18:53.720]  here's your interview uh if they think it's radical that you thought it looked like explosives they
[2:18:53.720 --> 2:18:59.160]  better go talk to dan rather than the host of cbs nightly news and we also have a clip of peter
[2:18:59.160 --> 2:19:04.920]  jennings saying the exact same thing twice so so he says it looks like bombs so i guess uh they'll
[2:19:04.920 --> 2:19:09.560]  have to dig up poor peter jennings and gripe at him for thinking the same thing that you and i thought
[2:19:09.560 --> 2:19:15.720]  of course but what bothers me even more about all of this is that all of this stuff exists from day
[2:19:15.720 --> 2:19:23.480]  one if you start looking at all of the news reporting after day one um it's it the the the
[2:19:23.480 --> 2:19:29.720]  official story starts to find its way into our consciousness they start telling us the conspiracy
[2:19:29.720 --> 2:19:33.240]  theory that the conspiracy theorists in the government start telling us their wild eyed
[2:19:33.240 --> 2:19:40.760]  conspiracies exactly exactly and so and so we all go away from what we felt in our guts initially
[2:19:40.760 --> 2:19:45.320]  charlie sheen stay right there we've got a break we'll be right back folks strap yourselves in
[2:19:45.320 --> 2:19:55.720]  all right folks do strap yourselves in because we are going to break stay with us we'll come

[2:24:09.720 --> 2:24:25.320]  looking at 20 minutes with the president i realize it's 16 pages i'm going to read some key areas
[2:24:25.320 --> 2:24:34.920]  of it and i'm going to go ahead specifically for the listeners and i'm going to open the
[2:24:34.920 --> 2:24:45.000]  phones up at 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 i want to ask you are you going to stand with 911
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:49.720]  truth with charlie sheen for myself who boldly is going public asking the president to have a meeting
[2:24:49.720 --> 2:24:56.760]  with him and charlie wrote up a mock interview to publish the facts and the information of what he
[2:24:56.760 --> 2:25:02.440]  wants to discuss and to put into the interview two folders he gives the president that have all the
[2:25:02.440 --> 2:25:06.440]  evidence that's the way we get the public to actually read it when they ignored the regular
[2:25:06.440 --> 2:25:12.040]  document pages and then charlie explains this meeting hasn't happened yet but i would like it to
[2:25:12.040 --> 2:25:17.240]  and he's he's officially asking obama to meet with him when he's out on the trail or or charlie will
[2:25:17.240 --> 2:25:23.880]  fly to meet with him or when the president's out doing things you know and and by the way sheen's
[2:25:23.880 --> 2:25:27.800]  hung out with clinton hung out with gore they're on plane trips with them you know way back in the
[2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:35.720]  day his dad knows all these people later in the week i might let's well we might talk a little
[2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:41.800]  bit about martin sheen and if he's anywhere involved all this but the point is is that
[2:25:41.800 --> 2:25:46.840]  this is not an impossible meeting but regardless it's about a national debate about are we going
[2:25:46.840 --> 2:25:51.160]  to let six of the 10 members of the commission come out and say the whole investigation of 911's
[2:25:51.160 --> 2:25:59.400]  a fraud and then ignore that you know that's the big question here and so charlie put it in this
[2:25:59.400 --> 2:26:06.680]  format about meeting with the president to put out his information to then say i want to meet
[2:26:06.680 --> 2:26:13.320]  with the president that's the whole point of this but that's only a small part but the whole
[2:26:13.320 --> 2:26:17.080]  point of the letter being written that way it's about getting everybody active everybody in the
[2:26:17.080 --> 2:26:23.480]  town halls we are change going to events asking them if they're going to respond to 20 minutes
[2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:27.080]  with the president if he's going to meet with charlie sheen if they're going to talk about all
[2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:30.920]  the commission members six of the 10 saying it was a fraud members of their council their
[2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:35.800]  lawyers saying it was a fraud saying it was a criminal cover-up we cannot just stand idly by
[2:26:35.800 --> 2:26:42.280]  let this continue and again a 20-plus minute interview with charlie sheen tomorrow charlie
[2:26:42.280 --> 2:26:48.360]  seen live on air coming up uh videotape interview i did as well the next three days charlie sheen
[2:26:48.360 --> 2:26:53.240]  all three days wednesday thursday and friday already played a short clip of one of the
[2:26:53.240 --> 2:26:58.520]  recorded interviews i did with him just so we you know have that in the can we've got that
[2:26:58.520 --> 2:27:05.880]  but he's going to be live with us as well and video because charlie knows the power of video
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:10.680]  actually seeing him talk about all this because i'm already getting the emails and calls saying
[2:27:10.680 --> 2:27:15.080]  the clip we just played isn't charlie sheen and then i never had charlie sheen on the air this is
[2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:19.160]  the type of dis info and the establishment does this it's just like they'll deny there's a bank
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:23.560]  of the world that's been set up or a plan to have a global carbon tax as all these governments pass
[2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:31.640]  them it's a military tactic to deny deny deny uh so no need to even respond to all that let's
[2:27:31.640 --> 2:27:37.560]  play that clip of charlie sheen the new clip again let's play that clip right now the clip of sheen
[2:27:37.560 --> 2:27:41.640]  just a minute and a half of this 20 plus minute review i've got we're going to air in its entirety
[2:27:41.640 --> 2:27:46.280]  tomorrow and then sheen coming up live here it is charlie it's great to be here with you
[2:27:46.840 --> 2:27:51.400]  appreciate you doing this interview likewise alex thank you why after three years of silence
[2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:57.640]  concerning 9-11 are you now speaking up and why have you written this public letter that you've
[2:27:57.640 --> 2:28:08.200]  now uh published well alex uh i wrote this letter for for two reasons firstly i i i wanted to create
[2:28:08.200 --> 2:28:15.400]  a public document specifically rooted in fact uh if anybody dares question that i i i would
[2:28:15.400 --> 2:28:23.480]  encourage those people to to to scrutinize it to research it uh that the truth is unchanging alex
[2:28:23.480 --> 2:28:29.720]  as we both know uh the only aspects of this piece that that had to be manufactured with the president's
[2:28:29.720 --> 2:28:37.720]  words everything else will withstand the critical assault i'm more than prepared to endure and secondly
[2:28:37.720 --> 2:28:44.520]  um this is our first new president since 9-11 and they consequently his first 9-11 anniversary
[2:28:44.520 --> 2:28:54.440]  in office um enough stonewalling enough media manipulation of media mantra speak the families
[2:28:54.440 --> 2:29:00.920]  deserve better alex america deserves better i mean come on come on people the 9-11 commission
[2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:09.240]  report is a blatant work of manipulation secrecy and fiction come on the time is now demand the truth
[2:29:09.240 --> 2:29:15.880]  i personally cannot stand idly by any longer and pretend like a uh the new investigation is just
[2:29:15.880 --> 2:29:21.160]  going to fall out of the heavens right into our congress we have to take action we have to stand
[2:29:21.160 --> 2:29:27.160]  as one we must insist that our new president deliver on his promises all right ladies and
[2:29:27.160 --> 2:29:31.640]  gentlemen we're going to go to break and you know what i'll go ahead and take some phone calls and
[2:29:31.640 --> 2:29:34.920]  i'll read some passages because i was thinking about reading the whole thing and maybe i will
[2:29:34.920 --> 2:29:39.800]  the last 30 minutes but because it takes about 25 minutes to read it if you don't read super fast
[2:29:39.800 --> 2:29:43.560]  it's really like 25 minutes of the president we wanted to add so much documentation in here
[2:29:44.200 --> 2:29:49.720]  but uh that is all coming up ladies and gentlemen and a bunch of financial news stay with us

[2:33:22.440 --> 2:33:27.240]  there should be a criminal investigation not just a new investigation obama's expanding the war is
[2:33:27.240 --> 2:33:31.720]  the wire tapping the torture of the secret police and i'm sick of it and so is charlie sheen and i
[2:33:31.720 --> 2:33:37.000]  know you are and so charlie sheen's going public a bunch of other public people went public in the
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:42.120]  year or so after he went public it energized 9 11 truth 9 11 truth just kept on chugging after
[2:33:42.120 --> 2:33:48.840]  obama got in but the establishment as i predicted i know their mind came back in after bush was gone
[2:33:49.640 --> 2:33:54.760]  believing that now it was depoliticized and they kind of rewrite history and attack 9 11 truth
[2:33:54.760 --> 2:33:58.360]  they're doing with all these new tv shows coming out they got a couple of them have already aired
[2:33:58.360 --> 2:34:03.080]  this year more airing in the next month they are trying to attack us but more and more evidence
[2:34:03.080 --> 2:34:07.800]  civil admins the fbi translator comes out breaks her federal gag order that's in his 20 minutes
[2:34:07.800 --> 2:34:13.960]  of the president and says that the that the cia was running al qaeda and taliban right up until
[2:34:13.960 --> 2:34:19.400]  the day of 9 11 that is huge bombshell news she told the 9 11 commission that and they wanted to
[2:34:19.400 --> 2:34:24.600]  go public were told to shut up that's why they cannot say it was a fraud you realize how hardcore
[2:34:24.600 --> 2:34:29.640]  this is you realize how serious this is you realize how real this is you know also want to ask the
[2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:34.600]  listeners what are your ideas to get 20 minutes with the president out and his the article titled
[2:34:34.600 --> 2:34:38.760]  charlie sheen requests meeting with obama over 911 cover-up that's the whole point of him going
[2:34:38.760 --> 2:34:45.080]  public with a meeting with the president with a fiction meeting he wrote up saying i want to have a
[2:34:45.080 --> 2:34:51.320]  real meeting and i want to present him with this evidence in this bibliography please ladies and
[2:34:51.320 --> 2:34:55.240]  gentlemen i launched 9 11 truth the day of the attacks on went on air and i said we've got to
[2:34:55.240 --> 2:35:00.040]  expose this fraud and all these other people that later became prominent 9 11 folks got mad at me
[2:35:00.040 --> 2:35:05.160]  attacked me i remember but it's my job to hit the bar bar we talked about it too much before it
[2:35:05.160 --> 2:35:13.720]  happened but when the event took place we came out we exposed it i took the heat and i lost about
[2:35:13.720 --> 2:35:17.400]  70 percent of the radio stations i was on at the time this is that was kind of the end of the bill
[2:35:17.400 --> 2:35:23.080]  clinton days and i just started to bash bush uh you know i was before i was depoliticizing and
[2:35:23.080 --> 2:35:28.200]  just saying he was a puppet but i mean a lot of people say oh i'd stand up oh i'd tell the truth
[2:35:28.200 --> 2:35:34.120]  well i'm somebody that did and lost seven out of ten stations i was on over the years i built back
[2:35:34.120 --> 2:35:41.400]  up more stations and got bigger than i even was at the time but i've taken a lot of hits for this
[2:35:41.400 --> 2:35:48.840]  because the truth's all that matters charlie sheen somebody who gets $500,000 in episode
[2:35:48.840 --> 2:35:54.680]  and two or three times that on syndication with all these seven eight years of his show what is
[2:35:54.680 --> 2:35:59.960]  in the eighth year now re-airing of war he's got a lot at stake here he's got a lot of courage
[2:35:59.960 --> 2:36:03.560]  and we've got to stand with him and what he's done against the co until pro against the
[2:36:03.560 --> 2:36:09.080]  disinfo against the spins against everybody and i want to put a challenge out to people
[2:36:09.080 --> 2:36:15.080]  even if you don't like me personally for whatever slights over the years or people in our community
[2:36:15.640 --> 2:36:19.960]  at least stand behind charlie sheen and 9 11 truth and realize how important this is to
[2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:25.480]  everybody because we have no future if we don't turn the corner on this now i want to go to donna

[2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:45.720]  making it an issue we have that power now to go into the town halls to go into the city councils
[2:36:45.720 --> 2:36:52.760]  to go into talk radio to call in to make websites and this is the best 16 pages of material i've
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:36:58.440]  seen with the 20 bullet points in here in fact let me just read the 20 well you know what i'll
[2:36:58.440 --> 2:37:02.440]  read the 20 bullet points after i take some calls and cover some economic news we'll we'll do this

[2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:12.600]  on here i'm kind of looking at it like a big garage i've got to clean out or something you
[2:37:12.600 --> 2:37:17.000]  know your garage it's full of junk over five years i'm like god to read this on air but i'm
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:22.040]  going to cover it because it's key info uh the point is i can half-ass read it i want to focus
[2:37:22.040 --> 2:37:25.240]  and read it good which i'm capable of but it takes a lot of energy for me to do that so
[2:37:25.240 --> 2:37:31.080]  that's coming up let's go ahead and talk to john disagrees so i'll go ahead of the line with him
[2:37:31.080 --> 2:37:35.080]  but i'm going to try to be quick with a caller so have your point ready john i don't know what
[2:37:35.080 --> 2:37:40.040]  you're calling about but you disagree about something go ahead yes uh you know i i've always
[2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:44.040]  agreed you know that i do that you've been in the cutting edge of exposing the 9-11 inside
[2:37:44.040 --> 2:37:50.920]  job and i totally support uh charlie sheen but uh i i really can't uh recommend your program
[2:37:50.920 --> 2:37:56.840]  anymore i i i try to find others who bring up the same things you do but uh like global research
[2:37:56.840 --> 2:38:03.160]  dot c i c a yeah yeah listen listen listen i i linked to their stories we have them on
[2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:06.360]  their nice folks but i'm not going to have you come on and say i'm a piece of crap and then
[2:38:06.360 --> 2:38:11.480]  recommend a bunch of the stuff see i understand you you call before you're a communist and you
[2:38:11.480 --> 2:38:16.840]  don't like it that i badmouth van jones who quote wants a total redistribution of wealth
[2:38:16.840 --> 2:38:22.600]  that means absolute death pits that means absolute commasars and black uniforms and people in work
[2:38:22.600 --> 2:38:28.120]  brigades and i'm in let me guess that's what you're upset about is not what i'm upset about
[2:38:28.120 --> 2:38:33.880]  we'll say it then might i'm upset about the fact that you're joining with the neocons and many of
[2:38:33.880 --> 2:38:39.640]  the guests you have you have on you're joining with those who are opposing the uh the world order
[2:38:39.640 --> 2:38:44.520]  uh the imf the kinds of things that john perkins is talking about the people who are even on your
[2:38:44.520 --> 2:38:50.360]  side and so in exposing the inside job of 9-11 like another person who's on the co-in-tell
[2:38:50.360 --> 2:38:55.400]  poll list even more than you are see our chavez of venezuelan was been uh attacked by the military
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:39:01.400]  industrial c i complex uh kidnapped almost assassinated until millions of people rose up
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:07.080]  so i'm just saying that you're you're you've got your feet in two camps and i appreciate your call
[2:39:07.080 --> 2:39:14.040]  yeah this this show isn't like a religious cult where everything is circumscript and you know i
[2:39:14.040 --> 2:39:20.200]  wash my hands this way and i chant everything just right i have john perkins on who i agree with
[2:39:20.200 --> 2:39:25.400]  a lot but i disagree with him a lot i tell him on air i disagree with him and i have people
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:30.040]  like geron coursing on dr coursing and i agree with him on some things and i argue with him on
[2:39:30.040 --> 2:39:36.280]  others it's a four hour radio show i mean i link to mainstream news all the time that i disagree with
[2:39:37.880 --> 2:39:42.280]  from the phony left the phony right old points in between and people always comment under the link
[2:39:42.280 --> 2:39:47.960]  oh look he's got a republican link he's got a democrat link oh look he's linked to chavez's
[2:39:47.960 --> 2:39:53.480]  speech he's a communist he's linked to something glenn beck said he supports glenn beck and it's
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:40:03.080]  all straw man okay i put out my info you do what you want with it john okay i mean it's crazy
[2:40:03.640 --> 2:40:08.280]  we're not left we're not right we're for decentralization we're for true liberty
[2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:14.440]  we're for freedom and i supported chavez early on defeating the north american union's expansion
[2:40:14.440 --> 2:40:20.840]  into the south american central american free trade area the americas but now he is arresting
[2:40:20.840 --> 2:40:29.080]  people he is shutting down media uh you see you it's so childlike john i think the global is running
[2:40:29.080 --> 2:40:34.520]  our country are bad and then i think the socialist and communist are bad i think government big
[2:40:34.520 --> 2:40:41.240]  government's always bad history shows that liberty and freedom is incredibly rare tyranny is incredibly
[2:40:41.240 --> 2:40:50.120]  popular and i was talking about oliver stone coming out and making a worship fest about hugo chavez
[2:40:51.800 --> 2:40:56.280]  but then and i pose the coup against chavez he's democratically elected
[2:40:56.280 --> 2:40:59.560]  though he's trying to stay in for life now he's turning into fiddle castra i don't support fiddle
[2:40:59.560 --> 2:41:05.000]  castra does that mean i support the right wingers that are against him no see i don't put these
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:09.320]  people up on pedestals and so if i say i agree with them on this but not on that i think for
[2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:14.840]  chavez is going in a bad direction that's what i'm saying i'm not in your left right system
[2:41:15.640 --> 2:41:19.880]  now i use the term left right sometimes just to communicate because we're on all these am and fm
[2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:24.840]  stations across the country and people tuning in you know here's an example every time i talk about
[2:41:24.840 --> 2:41:33.160]  pirate radio i get scores of emails and calls going you bastard son of a bitch uh you are calling
[2:41:33.160 --> 2:41:36.840]  it pirate it's not pirate we under the first amendment should be allowed to have micro fms
[2:41:36.840 --> 2:41:41.880]  if we're not interfering yes i pioneered back in the late 90s saying put them up nationwide
[2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:49.400]  i support them but when you get up and call them micros 95 percent of people don't know what you're
[2:41:49.400 --> 2:41:53.640]  talking about it's like if you're in russia talking to russian speakers you don't speak
[2:41:54.360 --> 2:42:01.800]  chinese to them or japanese or english you speak russian so all this straw man mental illness
[2:42:01.800 --> 2:42:06.760]  compartmentalization it really gets to me it's like i say if you're going to get involved in
[2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:11.720]  militias look out the feds are in there historically trying to provocateur you i'm warning people i'm
[2:42:11.720 --> 2:42:19.880]  saying we're all in the militia 18 to 45 it's good i support it i broke the mic report the dhs i get
[2:42:19.880 --> 2:42:26.280]  these guys sending me threatening emails you son of a you know what son of a donkey you don't you
[2:42:26.280 --> 2:42:31.640]  don't support the militias because i don't support people calling themselves the president of the
[2:42:31.640 --> 2:42:37.000]  republic of texas standing out front their trailer and i'm not bashing somebody in a trailer the point
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:42.920]  is is that i don't know and it doesn't mean i'm perfect either it's just i'm sick of everybody
[2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:49.400]  saying what i am or misrepresenting what we are or what we do and i guess just people getting these
[2:42:49.400 --> 2:42:53.240]  ruts and they can't get out of them but yeah i don't like communist buddy and i happen to know
[2:42:53.240 --> 2:42:57.960]  that the bankers funded it on record you called in and denied that i happen to know there's a lot
[2:42:57.960 --> 2:43:03.160]  of big banks in central and south america manipulating a fake leftist revolution i've talked to a lot of
[2:43:03.160 --> 2:43:09.160]  big media people down in latin america just talked to one in ecuador last week the equivalent of
[2:43:09.160 --> 2:43:14.120]  their 60 minutes they take an interview and they said oh yes we understand i used to be a leftist
[2:43:14.120 --> 2:43:18.280]  but now we understand that they control both the left and the right and that this is a and you
[2:43:18.280 --> 2:43:22.440]  notice now perkins who is this big economic hit man he's now the left and wants the global carbon
[2:43:22.440 --> 2:43:28.600]  tax seat and i i think perkins who we've met with an interview for the film you know i think he
[2:43:28.600 --> 2:43:33.880]  really believes it i i'm not that smart how do i get the different systems and the manipulations
[2:43:33.880 --> 2:43:38.360]  and other people don't how do i understand pr but other people don't how do i understand i mean i
[2:43:38.360 --> 2:43:42.760]  don't understand it look spend enough time with john uh i'm not trying to fight with you but just
[2:43:42.760 --> 2:43:51.000]  for god's sakes you know um heaven sakes donna in new hampshire you're on the air donna hi alex if
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:57.720]  there was anybody more fair and balanced it would be you um i i totally disagree with john uh i have
[2:43:57.720 --> 2:44:03.000]  been a listener for you for over 10 years what i wanted to say is i think this uh this letter
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  that charlie sheen wrote is spot on i think it's great publicity um maybe put people should put
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:13.480]  letters to the editors out in all their publications and all their magazines and newspapers around the
[2:44:13.480 --> 2:44:20.600]  country and i plan on being down in new york on uh nine eleven and i will be out there protesting
[2:44:20.600 --> 2:44:28.600]  with one of my alex jones t-shirts well awesome and and again charlie saying okay i went public to
[2:44:28.600 --> 2:44:32.360]  get more people to go public and a lot of folks through his courage did he's saying i'm going
[2:44:32.360 --> 2:44:38.280]  public even bigger now you know he's going on my show repeatedly live this week video he's gonna do
[2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:46.200]  media uh not just my show and uh he's kind of taking my advice on what i think he should do
[2:44:46.200 --> 2:44:52.200]  and shouldn't do so people can send us emails at sheen and info wars dot com of your media but uh
[2:44:52.200 --> 2:44:55.800]  i've got the national media calling me saying is this really charlie sheen's letter did he really
[2:44:55.800 --> 2:44:59.560]  write this yes charlie sheen's been on the show before he just heard him so i keep playing the
[2:44:59.560 --> 2:45:04.360]  clip the short clip the bigger clips are coming up tomorrow and the live stuff and this is real
[2:45:04.360 --> 2:45:10.920]  and charlie's asking people to go out and to get politically active and he wants the media and press
[2:45:10.920 --> 2:45:15.880]  conferences to ask obama about his letter that's why it's done in that context this is the meeting he
[2:45:15.880 --> 2:45:22.520]  wants to have he wants to make this about obama facing this so this is a way to publicly face him
[2:45:23.080 --> 2:45:27.880]  in a simulation of the meeting you understand understand perfectly and and the other thing
[2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:33.400]  is too that even reading this letter i have been um you know right on board with nine eleven was an
[2:45:33.400 --> 2:45:38.920]  inside job and he brought some things to my attention that i did even research myself
[2:45:38.920 --> 2:45:45.800]  with six or uh of the ten nine eleven commission have uh you know come out publicly so he is bringing
[2:45:45.800 --> 2:45:52.520]  even more information you can tell he has definitely definitely uh did the research himself nobody is
[2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:57.480]  spoon feeding charlie sheen and no charlie charlie did ninety percent of the work i mean i would sit
[2:45:57.480 --> 2:46:04.440]  there on his back porch with him for like ten hours then we go inside when i got dark we just
[2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:10.120]  with it with the laptops out researching and and he he did ninety percent of the letter and then the
[2:46:10.120 --> 2:46:16.360]  rest putting it all together and presenting it we did not we do a perfect job but no no i mean
[2:46:16.360 --> 2:46:23.400]  charlie sheen is just such a focused passionate serious professional humanitarian i mean he you
[2:46:23.400 --> 2:46:30.120]  know he doesn't do this i don't want me to tell this story but when charlie drives to work there's
[2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:35.320]  this big long giant hill like a mile and a half that all the help for the gated community he lives
[2:46:35.320 --> 2:46:43.560]  in come up to me and the bus stops down the hill and these people walk up and charlie and his dad
[2:46:44.520 --> 2:46:50.600]  and when he comes to the house they stop almost every day and give people rides up and down the
[2:46:50.600 --> 2:46:55.560]  hill and the media never knew that i mean that's that's what's so sick about this is he's so private
[2:46:55.560 --> 2:47:00.520]  so quiet he doesn't want accolade he doesn't want praise for this he knows they blew up the towers
[2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:06.040]  he's freaked out by it he can't go to sleep over it with you how do you know that six of the ten
[2:47:06.040 --> 2:47:11.880]  commission did you're saying it's a fraud and the media is acting like you got three heads if you
[2:47:11.880 --> 2:47:17.880]  talk about it i mean the sheens are real people and they're not the image and the distorted view
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:24.040]  that the media uh... you know puts out as purely leftist or purely right wing uh... and and you
[2:47:24.040 --> 2:47:29.880]  know they've gone through a process to a lot of it for my films and material and it's happening to
[2:47:29.880 --> 2:47:34.840]  other people and there's a revolution of ideas and charlie's like galileo saying the earth is not
[2:47:34.840 --> 2:47:40.360]  the center of the universe because he's prominent he has a lot to lose and it's just beautiful
[2:47:40.360 --> 2:47:45.160]  and i hope people understand the magnitude of the courage that we're seeing here
[2:47:47.160 --> 2:47:51.800]  and i just wanted to also wishing his birthday on the same day as my father's on september third
[2:47:51.800 --> 2:47:56.760]  and i also wanted to wish him a happy birthday and uh... you know great work job uh... that
[2:47:56.760 --> 2:48:02.440]  you both have done and i i'm so proud of both of you and you guys inspire us and uh... that's
[2:48:02.440 --> 2:48:07.160]  one of the reasons why i am going down to new york uh... on september eleventh because
[2:48:07.160 --> 2:48:12.520]  we need a big outcry we need more people uh... this has been kind of uh... you know dusted under
[2:48:12.520 --> 2:48:18.360]  the rug uh... the nine eleven first responders i mean have been completely and utterly put on the
[2:48:18.360 --> 2:48:23.160]  back burner and we are changed has been fighting and and trying to get the bills passed to just
[2:48:23.160 --> 2:48:27.160]  get a medical care i appreciate your call great points and the establishment that committed
[2:48:27.160 --> 2:48:31.800]  these atrocities they sit there and pose like oh it's for the firemen and police and military
[2:48:31.800 --> 2:48:36.040]  when they're blocking basic health care because they knew from day one the dust was going to kill
[2:48:36.040 --> 2:48:40.680]  them and now what is it four thousand first responders plus have died all the police dogs
[2:48:40.680 --> 2:48:48.520]  have died uh... as of years ago of all these weird cancers all uh... mount sinai's and all these
[2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:54.760]  other big facilities in california and new york have done the scans uh... of their lungs in fact
[2:48:54.760 --> 2:49:02.280]  google that uh... ct scans prove wtc workers have deadly dust and you know we pull up the
[2:49:02.280 --> 2:49:10.520]  headlines but the point is that the e p a was ordered to cover that up but but here's another example
[2:49:10.520 --> 2:49:14.920]  i was telling people months ago well years ago i said go to city council go to congressmen's
[2:49:14.920 --> 2:49:19.960]  public meetings go to these town halls go take over the events bring up real issues
[2:49:20.680 --> 2:49:24.600]  and the media a couple months ago said oh it's all fake republicans are financing this against
[2:49:24.600 --> 2:49:29.160]  the socialist health care it's eugenics health care on even socialist all this is happening
[2:49:29.160 --> 2:49:36.120]  and they just went on and on and on and on saying it wasn't real and later they had to
[2:49:36.120 --> 2:49:41.400]  admit okay it's real okay you're not astroturf okay you're not nazis okay our union people
[2:49:41.400 --> 2:49:45.240]  have been ordered to beat you up and the white house is ordering people to snitch and spy
[2:49:45.240 --> 2:49:49.320]  and think about this obama comes out two weeks ago and says we're going to ask your kids to
[2:49:49.320 --> 2:49:53.720]  work for us and to help us and al gore is out telling kids don't believe your parents about
[2:49:53.720 --> 2:49:58.760]  man may global warming they're wrong it's real your parents are wrong that was all in the teaching
[2:49:58.760 --> 2:50:03.160]  materials they had to take that out so then he gives this milk toast speech and says oh much to
[2:50:03.160 --> 2:50:10.440]  do about nothing i just said stay out in school and off drugs see how they do these psyops these
[2:50:10.440 --> 2:50:15.960]  bait and switches and they just do it right out in front of everybody but it still doesn't matter
[2:50:15.960 --> 2:50:19.720]  people see right through that people see right through the fact that it does get rid of your
[2:50:19.720 --> 2:50:25.160]  own insurance it does take control of the doctors we've read the subsections it does have the eugenics
[2:50:25.160 --> 2:50:29.960]  bioethics panels that decide when you can live and when you can die it's all in there it's all real

[2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:54.680]  here you and panel calls for dollar reserve role to be eliminated the end of the dollar the devaluation
[2:54:55.800 --> 2:55:01.880]  mainstream media is reporting that they believe the london telegraph top economists believe there
[2:55:01.880 --> 2:55:07.560]  may be a complete dollar devaluation just like what happened
[2:55:10.440 --> 2:55:14.040]  in argentina a few years ago this is what we've been saying they're planning to do
[2:55:14.040 --> 2:55:19.480]  do but the headline is barack obama accused of making depression mistakes none of this is a mistake
[2:55:19.480 --> 2:55:25.000]  barack obama hasn't done this he's just a puppet frontman you had total unison of policy from bush
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:29.720]  to obama and before that clinton is the one that got rid of the glass steagle act to allow this to
[2:55:29.720 --> 2:55:35.720]  happen the banks gave themselves unlimited money on your dime ted anderson gold went to what
[2:55:36.360 --> 2:55:41.320]  one thousand eight dollars today and i just wanted to briefly have you up here we've been saying it
[2:55:41.320 --> 2:55:45.400]  was going to go above a thousand all the evidence showed because what you still got some gold you
[2:55:45.400 --> 2:55:50.360]  bought at the eight forty i mean at the nine forty range sixty something dollars under what
[2:55:50.360 --> 2:55:53.640]  it's trading under right now i wanted to give people an opportunity to call mitis resources
[2:55:54.200 --> 2:55:58.920]  yeah i would say it'd be a good time obviously where this first started was over in the far east
[2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:03.960]  china wants to get out of the dollar in the worst way and it was happening while we were
[2:56:03.960 --> 2:56:08.920]  sleeping gold went up over a thousand dollars an ounce london was trying to sell to suppress it
[2:56:08.920 --> 2:56:14.200]  down but they lost that battle and now here right now at this particular moment even with all the
[2:56:14.200 --> 2:56:19.240]  selling pressure that's occurring here in the united states the best they can do is nine ninety
[2:56:19.240 --> 2:56:24.760]  eight twenty and gold has already gone to one thousand eight ninety silver almost seventeen
[2:56:24.760 --> 2:56:30.680]  dollars an ounce now sixteen eighty at a high today right now currently sixteen forty six
[2:56:30.680 --> 2:56:37.080]  so yeah definitely a lot of pressure on on gold and silver alex here's what i've been that's what's
[2:56:37.080 --> 2:56:42.600]  been occurring here as a dealer i've been trying to stock up on these on these uh... british sovereigns
[2:56:42.600 --> 2:56:48.120]  and frank's and the british sovereigns i mean i i tell you i was having a hard time getting any
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:53.240]  supply at all it's just like a replay of what happened a year ago or a year and a half ago when
[2:56:53.240 --> 2:56:58.840]  gold did this i couldn't get enough supply there wasn't anything to sell i was lucky to find a
[2:56:58.840 --> 2:57:03.960]  bag of junk silvered off to my customers you know and this stuff is usually available all the time
[2:57:03.960 --> 2:57:08.200]  and that is occurring right now again as we speak so if you're looking at getting at a
[2:57:08.200 --> 2:57:14.120]  golden silver now is the time to do it i do have in my stock currently frank's at two twenty three
[2:57:14.120 --> 2:57:20.360]  i'm sorry two thirty three right now i have i have british sovereigns currently right now in my stock
[2:57:20.360 --> 2:57:26.120]  at two hundred and eighty eight that walking liberty half alex that is at eight dollars and
[2:57:26.120 --> 2:57:32.040]  sixty nine cents far beyond the best buy that i have in my entire inventory because that reflects
[2:57:32.040 --> 2:57:37.240]  silver prices down towards eleven dollars an ounce uh... lakota nation rounds right now are
[2:57:37.240 --> 2:57:42.120]  trading at twenty two thirty so just to give you some examples we do have some other things too
[2:57:42.120 --> 2:57:46.440]  we just don't have enough time to talk about everything but it right now with the pressure
[2:57:46.440 --> 2:57:50.920]  going downward i mean that the the support level in the marketplace was nine forty five it didn't
[2:57:50.920 --> 2:57:56.520]  break through that going up over a thousand wouldn't surprise me if we start seeing that that level
[2:57:56.520 --> 2:58:01.880]  that bloomberg is talking about which is running let me clear jet how hard it go go today gold went
[2:58:01.880 --> 2:58:07.880]  to one thousand and eight fifty already at this point so just amazing and and the golden silver
[2:58:07.880 --> 2:58:13.080]  you're selling you bought at what level is it nine forty five nine forty five is exactly where i
[2:58:13.080 --> 2:58:17.400]  picked that stuff up and where and so you're selling people at the market price of nine forty
[2:58:17.400 --> 2:58:22.120]  five when the market was at nine forty five that's the price it was factored in and in the market
[2:58:22.120 --> 2:58:27.080]  when it's now above a thousand one eight hundred six eight six two three seven the brokers are there
[2:58:27.080 --> 2:58:33.000]  right now they will be there until midnight tonight eight hundred six eight six two two three seven

[3:00:56.760 --> 3:00:59.960]  because he wants people because the media will just take the interview he's done
[3:00:59.960 --> 3:01:05.240]  one the interviews that are coming up in the live ones and just make it about that he wants to
[3:01:05.240 --> 3:01:10.520]  focus everything on 20 minutes with the president with the with the letter with the piece he wrote
[3:01:10.520 --> 3:01:14.200]  that has the material mirroring the real meeting he wants to have with the president
[3:01:14.200 --> 3:01:17.320]  hey side issue ted what do you think of the whole charlie sheen situation
[3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:24.680]  ted is uh ted is having a problem with this microphone
[3:01:24.680 --> 3:01:29.000]  um ted what do you think of this whole charlie sheen story
[3:01:29.880 --> 3:01:33.720]  yeah i i just think that it's it's great that a guy like that in his position
[3:01:34.280 --> 3:01:38.680]  is willing to risk it all and put it on the line and talk about this particular story i mean we
[3:01:38.680 --> 3:01:44.120]  all seen what happened here not too long ago when the you know back when 9 11 actually happened
[3:01:44.120 --> 3:01:50.840]  and then a few years later i mean if the conservatives the uh the um uh what would you
[3:01:50.840 --> 3:01:56.200]  call me the neocons the fake conservatives that triple the size of government yeah the neocons
[3:01:56.200 --> 3:02:00.120]  i mean if you're just going to mention that 9 11 was an inside job and you're going to be labeled
[3:02:00.120 --> 3:02:05.960]  as crazy you should be wearing a tin hat um well what about how the new york times reported that
[3:02:05.960 --> 3:02:10.200]  the white house called up and threatened mark cuban and then sick the securities and exchange
[3:02:10.200 --> 3:02:15.880]  commission on him to to punish him and then he had to go to court and beat him i mean folks that
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:20.360]  shows how guilty they are well that's the kind of that's the kind of crap that they pull i mean
[3:02:20.360 --> 3:02:24.920]  there's just so much political pressure to keep this thing under hat i mean like you said earlier
[3:02:24.920 --> 3:02:30.440]  alex if you expose the fact that there are false flag attacks uh the uh it's one of the biggest
[3:02:30.440 --> 3:02:35.800]  tools at the uh illuminati or the the the people that are controlling column the shots in the world
[3:02:35.800 --> 3:02:39.640]  you take that tool away from them they're not going to be able to wage war you don't wage war
[3:02:39.640 --> 3:02:43.960]  then they know that the united states government gets a chance to get away from this central
[3:02:43.960 --> 3:02:48.520]  banking system i mean i i mean that's the way i look at it and that's the way i see it coming down
[3:02:48.520 --> 3:02:52.600]  and and my hats off to charlie she and i just think it's great that he's doing what he's doing
[3:02:53.720 --> 3:02:59.480]  absolutely and we've got some newspapers calling we've had tv calling here i'm on air so i have
[3:02:59.480 --> 3:03:04.520]  trouble going and calling them back but i'll be off air in about 55 minutes and i'll be able to
[3:03:04.520 --> 3:03:12.920]  deal with that uh and then we need to call the associated press and get them to cover it because
[3:03:12.920 --> 3:03:17.080]  once they cover it uh then all the rest of the media is going to pile on and and and the whole
[3:03:17.080 --> 3:03:22.200]  point is six of the 10 commissioners ted said the whole commission was a fraud and a lie and there
[3:03:22.200 --> 3:03:27.240]  was a quote criminal cover-up of the white house in pentagon now how is that kooky to go hey the
[3:03:27.240 --> 3:03:31.160]  commissioners said it was all a lie there should be a new investigation i mean this is something
[3:03:31.160 --> 3:03:35.720]  the establishment hopes we don't look at and as michael savages even said iraq obama is going to
[3:03:35.720 --> 3:03:41.400]  stage a terror attack uh to get his agenda through well i that's the problem that's the that's the
[3:03:41.960 --> 3:03:46.200]  ace in the hole the card that the uh that the president has or the people that are
[3:03:46.200 --> 3:03:51.320]  that the president bows to i mean let's face it with brock obama came in and he was going to end
[3:03:51.320 --> 3:03:55.640]  the wars if you remember right and he's not any of the wars he's accelerating them it's and the
[3:03:55.640 --> 3:04:00.360]  reason why that's happening is because the people that he answers to are the same people that george
[3:04:00.360 --> 3:04:05.640]  bush answered to and so if you think you have a full new deal here with brock obama in comparison
[3:04:05.640 --> 3:04:11.880]  george bush think again i mean that brock obama has no more to do with this than than uh panocchio
[3:04:11.880 --> 3:04:17.240]  has i mean of the the the president united states is clearly just a puppet and what they whatever
[3:04:17.240 --> 3:04:22.040]  they run on is always you know a hogwash and a bunch of lies anyways that there are there's
[3:04:22.040 --> 3:04:28.200]  an agenda all right but the agenda isn't being uh put forth by our politicians has been put forth
[3:04:28.200 --> 3:04:36.360]  by some very uh very wealthy business people that control the currencies the world absolutely and
[3:04:36.360 --> 3:04:42.680]  folks again ted told you he bought gold at the 945 level silver to lower level he's running out of
[3:04:42.680 --> 3:04:46.680]  these supplies to get it at a price you're not going to find anywhere else give ted anderson a

[3:08:13.480 --> 3:08:22.360]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[3:08:23.800 --> 3:08:29.480]  continuing with your phone calls charlie sheen is asking the american people and the people of
[3:08:29.480 --> 3:08:34.440]  the world to stand with him for 9 11 truth 9 11 truth has just continued to get bigger and
[3:08:34.440 --> 3:08:37.400]  bigger and bigger but the media in the last year or so is quick covering it
[3:08:37.400 --> 3:08:43.720]  and then now they're coming back with counter strikes try to rewrite history
[3:08:44.280 --> 3:08:47.400]  in preparation to stage more attacks as you guys find the savage clip
[3:08:48.600 --> 3:08:52.440]  i want to play this clip of savage a few months ago saying obama is going to stage a
[3:08:52.440 --> 3:08:57.720]  right stag event and i agree there's no way my obama his controllers the global corporate
[3:08:58.840 --> 3:09:03.560]  scammers that are involved in a hostile takeover of our country if we don't expose false flag
[3:09:03.560 --> 3:09:09.240]  terror even further they are going to stage more attacks in the future by exposing the
[3:09:09.240 --> 3:09:13.720]  hegellian dialectic we take this tool away from them and break it in front of their faces
[3:09:13.720 --> 3:09:22.280]  here's michael savage now i'll make another prediction i predict that very soon obama
[3:09:22.280 --> 3:09:27.400]  will create a crisis along the lines of the right stock fire right stock fire i don't know
[3:09:27.400 --> 3:09:31.640]  what form it will take but i believe that once the minions are seen for what they are
[3:09:31.640 --> 3:09:36.920]  are rama manuel and his gang will set off a right stock fire in this country of some kind
[3:09:37.480 --> 3:09:42.120]  and they will recall the military dictatorship of lincoln and stanton during the civil war
[3:09:42.120 --> 3:09:47.480]  when civil civilian suspects were arrested without warrant i will tell you as i sit here i fear that
[3:09:47.480 --> 3:09:53.240]  every night as i go to sleep i put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized control
[3:09:53.240 --> 3:09:58.680]  of the most powerful economy and the most powerful military on earth know my friends i am losing a
[3:09:58.680 --> 3:10:04.120]  great deal of sleep every night because i do see this happening right before my eyes again i will
[3:10:04.120 --> 3:10:09.640]  repeat what i just said mark it down i again tell you that there will be the equivalent of a crisis
[3:10:09.640 --> 3:10:14.440]  on the order of the right stock fire i don't know where it will occur i don't know how it will occur
[3:10:14.440 --> 3:10:20.760]  i don't know what form it will take but during this crisis that will be triggered by the democrats
[3:10:20.760 --> 3:10:28.360]  around obama the gang that surrounds obama they will bring up lincoln they will recall the military
[3:10:28.360 --> 3:10:34.040]  dictatorship of lincoln in uh... in other terms during the civil war and they will do what lincoln
[3:10:34.040 --> 3:10:39.160]  did and they will arrest civilians without warrant in the name of saving the economy
[3:10:39.160 --> 3:10:44.600]  or saving the government from a right-wing takeover mark my words you put that down and you can put
[3:10:44.600 --> 3:10:53.000]  it in bronze not a nice all right what is former republican leader of the house dick army saying
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:57.720]  he's saying they're staging the crisis of the flu as a pretext to pass their whole agenda through
[3:10:57.720 --> 3:11:02.600]  in the fall and winter what is ron paul saying they could use a crisis to bring in their control
[3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:09.800]  what is congressman brown doing saying the same thing we understand how these globalists operate
[3:11:09.800 --> 3:11:17.800]  and what they're doing and that's why this is key what charlie sheen is doing right now and that's
[3:11:17.800 --> 3:11:21.480]  why he put it in the context of charlie would have just gone public it would have gotten a lot of
[3:11:21.480 --> 3:11:26.440]  attention but not attention involved with obama that he wants the meeting with obama by writing
[3:11:26.440 --> 3:11:32.200]  this article about what he believes will happen in a meeting with obama and then handing obama the
[3:11:32.200 --> 3:11:37.720]  briefings then the public is briefed by reading twenty minutes with the president please get it

[3:13:21.480 --> 3:13:27.080]  thanks for calling sir what's on your mind i just want to say how i commend and i think it's
[3:13:27.080 --> 3:13:33.480]  incredibly courageous what uh charlie sheen is doing uh all he's putting up as opposed to just
[3:13:33.480 --> 3:13:40.120]  talking and myself i plan on being out there on friday with all the protesters with my don't
[3:13:40.120 --> 3:13:46.360]  tread on me t-shirts and i have an idea that people can also get the word out make copies of the
[3:13:46.360 --> 3:13:51.960]  videos like you said and i plan on downloading and printing the 20 minutes with the president
[3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:56.120]  just walk in your neighborhoods to commit people's mailboxes you know they they don't want them
[3:13:56.120 --> 3:14:00.760]  they don't want them but sooner or later people are going to start listening and uh start waking
[3:14:00.760 --> 3:14:06.920]  up a lot more than they are now so you get it then i mean this isn't just a news story about
[3:14:06.920 --> 3:14:10.680]  him writing up an article about what he thinks a meeting with obama would be like it's about the
[3:14:10.680 --> 3:14:15.560]  information and it's about capturing people's imagination about a real meeting and meetings
[3:14:15.560 --> 3:14:19.960]  with their county commissioners their governors their legislatures their house members their
[3:14:19.960 --> 3:14:28.600]  senate members charlie is asking people to go out and to massively expand 911 truth because if we
[3:14:28.600 --> 3:14:33.560]  don't the same people that stage 911 are going to stage more that i mean the presidents are puppets
[3:14:33.560 --> 3:14:38.360]  the people behind the scenes the national security council and the globalist they're going to stage
[3:14:38.360 --> 3:14:43.640]  more terror i mean this is life and death oh absolutely i mean i i've been doing my own
[3:14:43.640 --> 3:14:48.920]  research for close to 10 years now i've been aware of all of this and it doesn't take much time
[3:14:48.920 --> 3:14:54.520]  and it doesn't take much effort to click on a link or to read really what's behind the corporate
[3:14:54.520 --> 3:15:00.040]  media giant uh and all their spin they put on it uh and and i think he's got the right approach
[3:15:00.040 --> 3:15:05.560]  you know uh it's all about uh game playing and uh i think what he's doing putting it in the format
[3:15:05.560 --> 3:15:13.080]  he is in uh putting it in is uh is great because he's just given it right back to him absolutely
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:18.920]  and again it's up to the people to drive this out into a huge nationals news story before the
[3:15:18.920 --> 3:15:23.240]  media gets it because they are starting to cover it before the media grabs it and tries to spin it
[3:15:23.240 --> 3:15:28.520]  or turn it around that's why we play just this short clip and i appreciate your call let's play
[3:15:28.520 --> 3:15:33.480]  just that short clip of the longer interview coming up tomorrow than sheen live my interview with sheen
[3:15:33.480 --> 3:15:38.360]  about this letter here it is this is his short statement on it charlie it's great to be here

[3:15:43.320 --> 3:15:49.800]  silence concerning 9-11 uh are you now speaking up and why have you written this public letter
[3:15:49.800 --> 3:15:59.720]  that you've now uh published well alex uh i wrote this letter for for two reasons firstly i i i wanted
[3:15:59.720 --> 3:16:07.800]  to create a public document specifically rooted in fact uh if anybody dares question that i i i would
[3:16:07.800 --> 3:16:15.960]  encourage those people to to to scrutinize it to research it to that the truth is unchanging alex
[3:16:15.960 --> 3:16:22.200]  as we both know uh the only aspects of this piece that that had to be manufactured with the president's
[3:16:22.200 --> 3:16:30.200]  words everything else will withstand the critical assault i'm more than prepared to endure and secondly
[3:16:30.200 --> 3:16:37.000]  um this is our first new president since 9-11 and they consequently his first 9-11 anniversary

[3:24:36.680 --> 3:24:41.800]  world this is happening and we should all use charlie sheen's courage as an example
[3:24:44.120 --> 3:24:49.800]  of how we all need to live when it comes to standing up and challenging the establishment
[3:24:49.800 --> 3:24:55.960]  and challenging big lies people would have stood up to hitler and linen and stalin and
[3:24:55.960 --> 3:25:05.880]  mal earlier those horrors wouldn't have happened let's go back to your calls in fact who's up

[3:25:19.320 --> 3:25:23.160]  9 11 being brought out to the american public i think that it should be on the forefront of
[3:25:23.160 --> 3:25:30.760]  americans minds i i admire charlie sheen for stepping up and doing his part i too being a radio host
[3:25:30.760 --> 3:25:35.080]  here in the local area of joplin missouri i try to get the word out as much as possible
[3:25:36.680 --> 3:25:41.960]  but whenever i read this i was on the edge of my feet all weekend waiting for today to arrive
[3:25:41.960 --> 3:25:46.680]  and whenever i read this letter this morning and got to the bottom i was totally disappointed
[3:25:46.680 --> 3:25:52.120]  but yeah well let me just say this and and i i appreciate your call but let me try to explain
[3:25:52.120 --> 3:25:57.560]  something here we brought you willy nelson we brought you jesse ventura they went public
[3:25:57.560 --> 3:26:01.800]  for 9 11 truth here on the air in music doesn't really get bigger than willy nelson he's in the
[3:26:01.800 --> 3:26:06.200]  top three or four most popular people out there that are still alive right up there at bob dillon
[3:26:06.200 --> 3:26:14.360]  level mcjagger level johnny cash level but johnny's not here uh we brought you charlie sheen
[3:26:14.360 --> 3:26:21.000]  and and people poo pooed that when it happened uh i i told you in the video yesterday that
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:29.320]  that was the start okay the letter is written so that the media will pick it up and so that it
[3:26:29.320 --> 3:26:34.760]  isn't just a boring 20 points that it's about the meeting he wants to have with the president
[3:26:34.760 --> 3:26:39.000]  and charlie was showing his knowledge of how the president would respond in his propaganda
[3:26:39.000 --> 3:26:46.520]  and it brought up the torture and everything else and so if you got a better idea of how
[3:26:46.520 --> 3:26:51.640]  to get media attention and how to cause a massive awakening please tell me the letter is only the
[3:26:51.640 --> 3:26:59.480]  start charlie's idea i think it's a great idea uh the letter is only the start then there's the
[3:26:59.480 --> 3:27:06.360]  radio interviews and the video and i told everybody in the piece the video piece from yesterday that
[3:27:06.360 --> 3:27:11.800]  i played earlier that there are going to be multiple things there's more surprises this is
[3:27:11.800 --> 3:27:19.720]  just the beginning and it's kind of like uh you know anticlimactic uh where where you know people
[3:27:19.720 --> 3:27:24.280]  are like want more more more charlie sheen is coming out saying he wants to meet with the president
[3:27:24.280 --> 3:27:29.560]  that's the big issue here have you seen the story charlie sheen requests meeting with obama over
[3:27:29.560 --> 3:27:34.680]  911 cover-up actor demands investigation be reopened at her majority 911 commission members say
[3:27:34.680 --> 3:27:40.920]  government lied about official story we are in the arena here with the globalist you did you see
[3:27:40.920 --> 3:27:46.360]  the new york times article where they went after mark cuban but he won for the white house
[3:27:47.960 --> 3:27:51.960]  like what's the headline on that you guys printed it earlier i mean we told you they were
[3:27:51.960 --> 3:27:57.000]  threatening mark cuban here it is insider trading or political persecution then it came out white
[3:27:57.000 --> 3:28:02.040]  house emails securities exchange commission calling him up threatening him about you better
[3:28:02.040 --> 3:28:06.920]  not make that 911 film we're going to destroy you and he pulled out of it and said my god but
[3:28:06.920 --> 3:28:11.320]  they still went and tried to prosecute him and it came out in the new york times show people the
[3:28:11.320 --> 3:28:17.960]  article that are watching at prison planet dot tv charlie sheen knows about all this this is a guy
[3:28:17.960 --> 3:28:22.440]  who makes tens of millions of dollars a year this is a guy who isn't just thinking about himself
[3:28:23.240 --> 3:28:29.160]  and then people are lying uh you know some people i don't you know i don't uh you know i wish it was
[3:28:29.160 --> 3:28:34.200]  a real meeting with the president that's what this is about when the media asked him why'd you write
[3:28:34.200 --> 3:28:38.360]  this mock letter to the president why this is what the establishment does a lot i don't know people
[3:28:38.360 --> 3:28:45.960]  understand this fact google and print off for me gary hart letter to iran huffington post and then
[3:28:45.960 --> 3:28:53.000]  we question him about it it's in truth rising and he said my mock letter to them was was a real letter
[3:28:53.000 --> 3:28:57.160]  people said well this isn't a real letter what do you mean i published it i sent it to him uh
[3:28:57.160 --> 3:29:03.080]  uh you know where he has this you know kind of conversation and then i mean that's how you do this
[3:29:03.080 --> 3:29:06.600]  is that you're saying you want this meeting to happen there was a washington post article
[3:29:06.600 --> 3:29:09.720]  about a meeting with the president where martin sheen interviews the president or whatever
[3:29:10.440 --> 3:29:13.880]  or was an interview like somebody was interviewing sheen like he was the president in the washington
[3:29:13.880 --> 3:29:19.960]  post the point is is that it's done so that people will read it and see the 20 points and
[3:29:19.960 --> 3:29:25.240]  understand my god what would happen to the president did see this what would happen if people did that
[3:29:25.240 --> 3:29:32.840]  okay so we're in the arena and and regardless nothing's perfect but we're asking you to now
[3:29:32.840 --> 3:29:37.720]  go out for 911 truth okay that's the big issue that's what we're talking about that's what we're

[3:33:13.800 --> 3:33:18.440]  thursday and friday that he is asking for a meeting with president barack obama
[3:33:19.720 --> 3:33:24.120]  the 20 minutes with the president is a way to make it interesting for people to read it
[3:33:24.120 --> 3:33:28.760]  and envision what that meeting would be like and jaren one of the producers here who also
[3:33:28.760 --> 3:33:33.800]  helps run the show with uh hall hartman in there jaren nyhart just real faster in the break
[3:33:35.240 --> 3:33:39.560]  he he really crystallized it repeat what you said yeah well i was talking about because
[3:33:39.560 --> 3:33:44.520]  that last caller what he had said he was disappointed uh after he got to the end of that piece and i
[3:33:44.520 --> 3:33:49.160]  was i was suggesting uh this morning i read it for the first time i didn't have any idea what it was
[3:33:49.160 --> 3:33:55.560]  about but the the beauty of that piece to me was that as you were reading it you could visualize
[3:33:55.560 --> 3:34:01.480]  the meeting and while you're reading that piece you get the evidence you see the evidence presented
[3:34:01.480 --> 3:34:06.760]  to obama as you're visualizing it uh that's why i just said that's what charlie said to me he said
[3:34:06.760 --> 3:34:11.240]  i have an idea of like a letter to the president but like it's a meeting visualizing a meeting i
[3:34:11.240 --> 3:34:14.920]  really want to have and that's only a platform when the media asks you to say yeah i really want
[3:34:14.920 --> 3:34:19.720]  this meeting these are the facts it was a what because you can't get people to read a 16 page
[3:34:19.720 --> 3:34:24.680]  report of bullet points and links but they will read it if it's in the context of something
[3:34:24.680 --> 3:34:29.320]  interesting yeah it was theater of the mind basically and i like as i was reading that i really felt
[3:34:29.320 --> 3:34:35.080]  like i was looking in on that meeting and then i saw the evidence presented uh he mentioned uh the
[3:34:35.080 --> 3:34:39.320]  painstaking research that was done for what he was presenting and then he gives him the folders
[3:34:39.320 --> 3:34:43.800]  and you have the links to those folders exactly and and and see i hadn't really articulated that
[3:34:43.800 --> 3:34:47.720]  yet today but that's exactly what charlie said so when you said i was like that's exactly was
[3:34:47.720 --> 3:34:51.800]  you know what charlie's idea was but that's only the platform to get the real meeting
[3:34:51.800 --> 3:34:56.360]  meeting so we're able to call the white house and say obama don't run from charlie sheen meet with
[3:34:56.360 --> 3:35:01.240]  him but then other people can meet with their politicians and that's what he's calling for
[3:35:01.240 --> 3:35:06.280]  in this absolutely jaren thank you so much no problem man all right i want to continue with
[3:35:06.280 --> 3:35:10.920]  some of your phone calls and then recap some of the other top news stories and read some of the
[3:35:10.920 --> 3:35:15.640]  20 bullet points in fact before i run out of time we're going to go to matthew gary steve
[3:35:16.600 --> 3:35:21.080]  michael michelle and others here in just a few minutes but i want to read from 20 minutes with
[3:35:21.080 --> 3:35:29.480]  the president i want to read some of the 20 bullet points that charlie sheen would like to make to
[3:35:29.480 --> 3:35:40.120]  the president in person okay so says thank you mr president okay first on the fbi most wanted list
[3:35:40.120 --> 3:35:45.160]  of some of bin laden is not charged or listed with the crimes of 9 11 when i called the fbi to ask
[3:35:45.160 --> 3:35:49.320]  them why this was the case they replied there's not enough evidence to link bin laden to the crime
[3:35:49.320 --> 3:35:58.200]  scene i later discovered he had never even been indicted by the department of justice though he was
[3:35:58.200 --> 3:36:07.560]  for i would just add for the tanzania bombings in kenya bombings in kenya and tanzania and of
[3:36:07.560 --> 3:36:13.480]  course for the uss coal see and then we have links to the fbi so in admissions number two fbi translator
[3:36:13.480 --> 3:36:18.840]  civil admins was dismissed and gagged by the doj after she revealed the government had four
[3:36:18.840 --> 3:36:23.640]  knowledge of the plans to attack american cities using planes as bombs as early as april 2001 remember
[3:36:23.640 --> 3:36:27.640]  bush lied and said that wasn't the case but later came out in august of 09 miss edmunds
[3:36:28.280 --> 3:36:33.880]  mrs edmunds broke the federal gag order and testified under oath that osama bin laden al-qaeda
[3:36:33.880 --> 3:36:40.760]  and the taliban were all working for and with the cia up until the day of 9 11 number three the
[3:36:40.760 --> 3:36:48.680]  following is a quote from mayor juliani during an interview on 9 11 with peter jennings for abc
[3:36:48.680 --> 3:36:55.000]  news i went down to the scene and we set up a headquarters at 75 barkley street i'm quoting
[3:36:56.600 --> 3:37:01.960]  mayor juliani quote i went down to the scene and we set up headquarters at 75 barkley street
[3:37:01.960 --> 3:37:05.560]  which was right there with the police commissioner the fire commissioner the head of emergency
[3:37:05.560 --> 3:37:10.360]  management and we were operating out of there when we were told that the world trade center
[3:37:10.360 --> 3:37:16.280]  was going to collapse and it did collapse before we could actually get out of the building so we
[3:37:16.280 --> 3:37:21.640]  were trapped in the building for 10 or 15 minutes and finally found an exit and got out and walked
[3:37:21.640 --> 3:37:27.320]  north and took a lot of people with us who told him this charlie sheen says to this day the question
[3:37:27.320 --> 3:37:32.040]  remains unanswered completely ignored and emphatically denied by mayor juliani on several
[3:37:32.040 --> 3:37:37.160]  public occasions even though there's all these videos and audios of him on abc news and cbs
[3:37:37.160 --> 3:37:44.440]  saying the exact same thing so there you have it number four charlie sheen number four in april
[3:37:44.440 --> 3:37:50.200]  2004 usa reported in the two years before september 11th the north american aero defense command
[3:37:51.880 --> 3:37:56.200]  conducted exercises simulating what the white house says was unimaginable at the time
[3:37:56.200 --> 3:38:01.080]  hijacked airliners used as weapons to crash into targets and cause mash casualties one of the
[3:38:01.080 --> 3:38:06.600]  targets was the world trade center charlie sheen number five on september 12 2007 cnn's anderson
[3:38:06.600 --> 3:38:12.520]  cooper 360 reported that the mysterious white plane spotted and videotaped by multiple media outlets
[3:38:12.520 --> 3:38:17.400]  flying in restricted airspace over the white house shortly before 10 a.m on the morning of 9 11
[3:38:17.400 --> 3:38:24.600]  was in fact the air forces e4b especially modified bowing 747 with a communications pod behind the
[3:38:24.600 --> 3:38:30.760]  cockpit otherwise known as the doomsday plane and there's links to all these reports to juliani to
[3:38:30.760 --> 3:38:38.680]  cnn to anderson cooper though fully aware of the event the 9 11 commission deemed the appearance
[3:38:38.680 --> 3:38:43.080]  of the military plane to not be of any interest and did not include it in the final 9 11 commission
[3:38:43.080 --> 3:38:49.560]  report by the way it was over dc and new york because they got five of them when all other planes
[3:38:49.560 --> 3:38:56.280]  are grounded number six three f 16's assigned to anders air force based 10 miles from dc were
[3:38:56.280 --> 3:39:01.000]  conducting training exercises in north carolina 207 miles away as the first planes crashed into
[3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:05.960]  the world trade center even at significantly less than their top speeds of 1500 miles per hour
[3:39:05.960 --> 3:39:11.400]  they could still have defended the skies over washington well before 9 a.m more than 37 minutes
[3:39:11.400 --> 3:39:18.120]  before flight 77 crashed in the pentagon however they did not return until after 9 55 a.m anders
[3:39:18.120 --> 3:39:23.080]  air force base had no armed fighters on alert and ready to take off on that morning of 9 11
[3:39:23.080 --> 3:39:31.400]  charlie sheen number seven wtc 7 wtc building 7 watch the video of its collapse we have a link
[3:39:31.400 --> 3:39:37.320]  to that in the whole page on that number eight flight 93 is the fourth plane to crash on 9 11
[3:39:37.320 --> 3:39:45.000]  at 10 o 3 a.m vice president cheney only gives you down orders at 10 10 to 10 20 a.m and this
[3:39:45.000 --> 3:39:51.800]  is not communicated norad until 28 minutes after flight 93 crashes further fueling suspicion
[3:39:51.800 --> 3:39:57.000]  on this front is the fact that three months before the 9 11 attacks dick cheney usurp control of
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:04.120]  norad and therefore he and no one else on planet earth had the power to call for military sorties
[3:40:04.120 --> 3:40:08.760]  on the hijacked airliners on 9 11 he did not exercise that power three months over 9 11
[3:40:08.760 --> 3:40:15.880]  he relinquished command of norad and returned it to military operation and then we have links to
[3:40:15.880 --> 3:40:20.840]  that although one second i take this phone call hey my fave on the air
[3:40:20.840 --> 3:40:29.960]  there hey no no no no no we're talking hey i tell you what guys i'm going to talk to charlie i know
[3:40:29.960 --> 3:40:36.200]  this is important call go to the older interview for just a minute or two okay i'll be right back
[3:40:36.200 --> 3:40:45.160]  folks and charlie there's so many facets of 9 11 but what about wtc 7 i mean it it wasn't even hit
[3:40:45.160 --> 3:40:51.640]  by a building 47 story structure has two small fires in it modern still building and ever collapsed
[3:40:51.640 --> 3:40:57.160]  from fire uh the madrid fire last year it burned for two days with 150 you know something foot
[3:40:57.160 --> 3:41:01.720]  wide hot flames and nothing collapsed there what happened with building seven in your opinion well
[3:41:01.720 --> 3:41:12.360]  curious isn't it a little bit curious um it just seems odd that an event something that we all
[3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:19.720]  witness because um september 11th wasn't this a pruder film it was the pruder film festival
[3:41:19.720 --> 3:41:30.280]  okay and i think that that um what was the great uh hoover quote about the bigger the lie the easier
[3:41:30.280 --> 3:41:36.280]  it is to pass over on people yes i'm i'm i mangled it i'm paraphernalia had a similar one about the
[3:41:36.280 --> 3:41:41.800]  bigger the lie the more they'll buy sure there you go there you go um we just thought a quote
[3:41:41.800 --> 3:41:46.200]  just because you know we're 20 minutes into this and i'm sure i'm being demonized across the nation
[3:41:46.200 --> 3:41:53.400]  by you know all of the uh people that do that sort of thing um but people see through the propaganda
[3:41:53.400 --> 3:41:59.480]  organs now i've never had before well good good finally um there's a couple of quotes here um
[3:42:00.040 --> 3:42:06.200]  the first is it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth whether about the president or anyone else
[3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:12.040]  the second quote from the same gentleman is uh that we are to stand by the president right
[3:42:12.040 --> 3:42:17.080]  or wrong it's not only unpatriotic and servile but it's morally treasonable to the american
[3:42:17.080 --> 3:42:22.120]  public theodore roosevelt yes well i mean that's what the founding fathers said it's our job to be
[3:42:22.120 --> 3:42:27.160]  watchdogs the declaration of independence clearly states that in our seminal founding document
[3:42:28.040 --> 3:42:35.480]  absolutely yeah and and and we've been uh coerced um away from these founding principles
[3:42:35.480 --> 3:42:40.040]  we've been told you're either with us or you're with the terrorist and we've been told never
[3:42:40.040 --> 3:42:46.520]  tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning 9 11 bush said that at the union yes he did yes
[3:42:46.520 --> 3:42:52.200]  he did that would um that would direct the blame away from those responsible blah blah blah um
[3:42:52.200 --> 3:42:58.600]  back to building seven yeah it um you pointed out in one of your documentaries that in a classic um
[3:42:58.600 --> 3:43:05.000]  um controlled demolition that they they um they create what's first called a crease is that correct
[3:43:05.000 --> 3:43:11.720]  or a wrinkle uh crease wrinkle cramp all those are used yes they blow the central column right
[3:43:11.720 --> 3:43:17.720]  and the term um pole is about pulling the outer walls toward the center of the building correct
[3:43:17.720 --> 3:43:24.280]  yes um so you minimize the damage and that way you bring a building down on its own footprint
[3:43:24.280 --> 3:43:29.240]  correct and and many controlled demolition experts said they've never seen a prettier
[3:43:29.240 --> 3:43:34.680]  job than building seven yeah gosh and there was a there was a guy I can't remember his name but
[3:43:34.680 --> 3:43:40.360]  scientifically he broke down that the building action fell faster than the speed of gravity
[3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:46.920]  because of the explosive vacuum that was created well a lot of different uh physicists
[3:43:46.920 --> 3:43:54.440]  uh the physics professor at b y u steven jones has done that uh underwriting laboratories uh
[3:43:54.440 --> 3:43:58.920]  kevin ryan who was there that guy got that guy got fired right yes he said we did our own test
[3:43:58.920 --> 3:44:04.120]  and it's impossible steel doesn't melt until thousands of degrees around 3000 and weekends
[3:44:04.120 --> 3:44:10.040]  and jet fuel burns at 1200 to 1400 it's impossible well that's that's 1200 at optimum conditions
[3:44:10.040 --> 3:44:17.960]  right yes yeah um yeah and then you've got uh silverstein the leaseholder the owner of
[3:44:19.320 --> 3:44:26.360]  seven as well as the rest of the complex right on tape on the record saying uh we've had such a
[3:44:26.360 --> 3:44:31.560]  terrible loss of life that day and uh i made the decision that they should uh go ahead and pull it
[3:44:31.560 --> 3:44:37.640]  and we gave the order and watched the building come down yeah um the pole is the i mean that's
[3:44:37.640 --> 3:44:43.480]  is that has come into the demo world as action and cut to the movie world here is larry silverstein
[3:44:43.480 --> 3:44:48.360]  the owner who took out seven billion dollars of insurance on the two towers and he's also now
[3:44:48.360 --> 3:44:53.640]  bought the sears tower and taken out a bunch of insurance and uh the governor pataki just uh
[3:44:53.640 --> 3:44:58.920]  called him the lowest of the low in the newspaper because he's holding out for a billion more now
[3:44:58.920 --> 3:45:04.760]  interesting fellow made out quite well and here is his statement from america rebuilds
[3:45:04.760 --> 3:45:10.280]  i remember getting a call from the uh fight upon commander telling me that they were not sure
[3:45:10.280 --> 3:45:15.320]  they're going to be able to contain the fire as you know we've had such a terrible loss of life
[3:45:16.200 --> 3:45:22.520]  but this last thing to us is pulling uh and they made that decision to pull and then we watched the
[3:45:22.520 --> 3:45:31.720]  building collapse they made the decision to pull they made they made the decision and this building
[3:45:31.720 --> 3:45:37.480]  with two small fires implodes perfectly and then there's video from every angle of the squibs or
[3:45:37.480 --> 3:45:43.960]  the blast points where the plastic explosives are detonating and you see the ejection ports you see
[3:45:43.960 --> 3:45:48.920]  the blast points just like when you watch a los vegas demolition they just had a demolition over
[3:45:48.920 --> 3:45:53.800]  the weekend in fort worth we have video and photos of that up on info wars dot com fell just like
[3:45:53.800 --> 3:45:59.880]  seven the blast the squibs uh then the crimp in the middle the top of the building imploding
[3:45:59.880 --> 3:46:06.680]  downwards and then it falls in on itself uh going back to our guest mr sheen uh that is the clip
[3:46:06.680 --> 3:46:11.160]  he mentioned with mr silverstein okay that's the interview from three years ago we've heard a clip
[3:46:11.720 --> 3:46:15.720]  of an interview we're going to be hearing in full tomorrow and charlie sheen live coming up
[3:46:15.720 --> 3:46:21.960]  several times this week and a video interview again repeat the big announced news story
[3:46:23.400 --> 3:46:29.080]  so i've got emails and calls just in confusion isn't just the letter to the president the simulated
[3:46:29.080 --> 3:46:34.600]  letter of charlie meeting with the president it's him asking for a real meeting and asking people
[3:46:34.600 --> 3:46:40.040]  to get politically active and asking people to go out to the tea parties and the events in the town
[3:46:40.040 --> 3:46:44.920]  halls and bring up 9 11 and the fact that six of the 10 commissioners the media the establishment
[3:46:44.920 --> 3:46:49.480]  the george soros liberals the neocons the left right control paradigm they're going to try to
[3:46:49.480 --> 3:46:55.080]  make it about you know about a whole bunch of other issues and we knew that that's good we want
[3:46:55.080 --> 3:46:59.160]  people to you know run around ruffling their feathers and when the media asked charlie sheen well why
[3:46:59.160 --> 3:47:03.560]  did you write this letter up you know as if you'd met with the president well that's the whole point
[3:47:03.560 --> 3:47:07.560]  of it is he wants to meet with the president he wants people to look at the evidence that we were
[3:47:07.560 --> 3:47:13.720]  just going over that's the whole point of this that's the whole point i mean it just sometimes it
[3:47:13.720 --> 3:47:19.720]  makes my head spin but the big news is charlie sheen is going public for 9 11 truth in a much
[3:47:19.720 --> 3:47:24.040]  bigger way than he did three years ago and he's asking for other prominent people to go public
[3:47:24.040 --> 3:47:28.200]  for 9 11 truth so we're asking everybody to get this out to the media of course there's going to
[3:47:28.200 --> 3:47:33.240]  be a lot of alternative media this jealous i don't know why they are so obsessed with us and it's
[3:47:33.240 --> 3:47:37.000]  because we're successful but we're successful because our hearts in the right place about
[3:47:37.640 --> 3:47:41.640]  reaching out to the people and showing people the power they have you know i get criticized for
[3:47:41.640 --> 3:47:46.520]  saying we need to have states rights and not secede though that's in the constitution of the
[3:47:46.520 --> 3:47:51.640]  states choose but to just redeclare 10th amendment sovereignty or i get criticized a month ago for
[3:47:51.640 --> 3:47:56.920]  telling people go to these town halls and take them over people did that it's the power of the
[3:47:56.920 --> 3:48:01.240]  people it's peaceful revolution of course they're going to have co until pro criticizing us for this
