[00:52.280 --> 00:56.800]  for you today and it's going to be back in the saddle I went down to Big Bend
[00:56.800 --> 01:02.560]  Texas to do some hiking and spend time with the family and have two different
[01:02.560 --> 01:08.120]  stories to tell concerning that I have never had this percentage of people come
[01:08.120 --> 01:13.480]  up to me in Alpine Texas in Tarlingua Texas in Big Bend and South of the
[01:13.480 --> 01:20.120]  National Park it was at least half the people I would hike past it was every
[01:20.120 --> 01:27.880]  person when I went in stores behind the counter in the stores it was crazy I'd
[01:27.880 --> 01:31.760]  be hiking down by the Rio Grande and people would start hey Alex Jones how
[01:31.760 --> 01:37.780]  you doing from like 300 yards away it was crazy and that just illustrates how
[01:37.780 --> 01:41.920]  popular freedom is I'm an upper-going man I'm really a celebrity people know
[01:41.920 --> 01:49.640]  who I am I'm a radio host a documentary filmmaker the fact that I'm this
[01:49.640 --> 01:53.160]  recognizable and the people were supportive of the message of every
[01:53.160 --> 01:58.960]  race color and creed is head spinning I ran into people from India that were
[01:58.960 --> 02:04.920]  listeners I ran into single women out hiking you know that were listeners I
[02:04.920 --> 02:10.960]  ran into just you name it I ran into a lot of military veterans who were
[02:10.960 --> 02:13.640]  bringing up the fact that our government was funding ISIS and how upset they
[02:13.640 --> 02:18.520]  were about it I also ran to like four people that were Steve Quell listeners
[02:18.520 --> 02:23.860]  no five people because one group was two people so I was four events but five
[02:23.860 --> 02:30.120]  people I got a huge Steve Quell buzz just those big buzz out there I didn't
[02:30.120 --> 02:32.680]  get a you know high off listening to them I mean I there was a Steve Quell
[02:32.680 --> 02:38.840]  buzz out there as well but a lot of folks brought up George Norrie as well it's
[02:38.840 --> 02:43.280]  just super positive news before again all this pretty scary news it's a big
[02:43.280 --> 02:49.760]  news day obviously that bad stuff's happening but humanity is awakening the
[02:49.760 --> 02:55.680]  bad part is they had two armed park police that I thought one of them looked
[02:55.680 --> 03:00.400]  like he was about 16 and I'm not exaggerating and the other his boss his
[03:00.400 --> 03:06.840]  his lieutenant was maybe 21 22 I mean wet behind the ears and I'm not bashing
[03:06.840 --> 03:10.920]  young people I've been young young people make great soldiers you're gonna have
[03:10.920 --> 03:14.680]  12-year-olds that could fight it's just sometimes a 12-year-old looks like he's
[03:14.680 --> 03:20.600]  more manly than a wimpy 21-year-old these guys did not look manly I mean when
[03:20.600 --> 03:24.680]  I was 12 I looked people thought I was 16 or 17 about when these guys were 12
[03:24.680 --> 03:30.180]  people thought they were two years old and they were out there putting people
[03:30.180 --> 03:35.280]  through the ringer they were out there arresting people and they were licking
[03:35.280 --> 03:41.480]  their lips I didn't have my phone on me it was back in the car because it had
[03:41.480 --> 03:45.840]  died and I hadn't charged it I forgot to bring a charger I left it in a little
[03:45.840 --> 03:57.480]  motel room there at the Chezos you know Mountain National Park Lodge but I wish
[03:57.480 --> 04:02.720]  I had tape but I didn't get in their face and I did and I did it very coldly
[04:02.720 --> 04:07.280]  and very focused I said look at you smiling look at you getting off
[04:07.280 --> 04:11.200]  rousting this old man and searching his bag I go this is not what a free country
[04:11.200 --> 04:16.880]  is so it was it was unbelievable and I just cannot go anywhere without a
[04:16.880 --> 04:22.280]  camera now it's every time I don't have one something over the top happens and
[04:22.280 --> 04:25.760]  they left me alone and didn't dig through my stuff and just sort of hauling
[04:25.760 --> 04:30.640]  people back to their cars to search their vehicles I was telling folks you
[04:30.640 --> 04:34.280]  know this guy's gonna claim I'm getting interfering with what he's doing he's
[04:34.280 --> 04:38.480]  violating the Constitution Bill of Rights on so many fronts I was like
[04:38.480 --> 04:41.240]  good thing you're not trying to take me up there and he had a bad body cams on
[04:41.240 --> 04:44.320]  him I said because I'm gonna sue you I go go ahead and rough me up think you're
[04:44.320 --> 04:48.280]  gonna win this I'm gonna you can beat the rap but you won't beat the ride and
[04:48.280 --> 04:52.720]  so they left me alone and hauled all these people off it was just like lambs
[04:52.720 --> 04:59.280]  to the slaughter it basically ruined my trip at that point coming up this
[04:59.280 --> 05:03.520]  Wednesday the 28th from 7 to 10 p.m. Central Info Wars is going to be here

[05:16.000 --> 05:19.680]  guys are at a lot of them are pretty much fixed horses just like Trump has said

[05:23.280 --> 05:26.520]  is he says hey I need you to do this favor for me then they hop up and do it
[05:26.520 --> 05:29.760]  he's saying that the political system is broken and I could not agree more with
[05:29.760 --> 05:33.840]  that we're doing this more as a way to educate the general public about the
[05:33.840 --> 05:37.320]  left-right paradigm and how you don't have to choose between a Republican and
[05:37.320 --> 05:41.920]  a Democrat it's going to be on CNBC and they say that some of the hot issues that
[05:41.920 --> 05:44.880]  they're gonna be talking about this time around are gonna be taxes retirement

[09:13.400 --> 09:16.840]  knows that I saw a bunch of mainstream news articles over the weekend where
[09:16.840 --> 09:22.640]  that we just print those off where elites are getting armored redoubts secret
[09:22.640 --> 09:27.040]  airstrips food bunkers and of course that's been in the news the last few
[09:27.040 --> 09:31.880]  years but it's really in the news right now why are so many rich people getting
[09:31.880 --> 09:38.880]  escape submarine yachts and building secret offshore bases that was like USA
[09:38.880 --> 09:43.840]  today this weekend I saw it's because they know they've created and we've gone
[09:43.840 --> 09:46.880]  along with it as well we're all guilty to some extent though they're the main
[09:46.880 --> 09:52.680]  drivers the main captains of this this fiasco this beginning to unravel that
[09:52.680 --> 10:01.520]  we're sitting on top of thousands of trillions of fake money fake instruments
[10:01.520 --> 10:08.520]  fake counterfeit garbage and the major pension funds public and private the
[10:08.520 --> 10:13.320]  city pension funds the school pension funds the corporate pension funds the
[10:13.320 --> 10:18.040]  private pension funds the 401ks whatever you want to call them are beyond

[10:47.440 --> 10:51.920]  normal and needs to happen no it's happening because you and I and all of
[10:51.920 --> 10:56.760]  us together have been signed on to a giant swindle that is meant to make us
[10:56.760 --> 11:00.920]  poor and the globalist above the law controlling a militarized world
[11:00.920 --> 11:08.280]  government when the dust settles now that said let's get into the news you're

[11:35.240 --> 11:40.840]  Carson 26 Trump 22 according to CBS New York Times poll who I don't believe
[11:40.840 --> 11:45.320]  their polls and I'm not against Carson I probably think he's fundamentally not
[11:45.320 --> 11:50.440]  as sneaky as Trump but Trump is leading in almost all the other polls a lot of
[11:50.440 --> 11:54.120]  trusted polls I think this is an attempt to knock him off I'm not saying
[11:54.120 --> 11:57.800]  Carson's not real popular Rand Paul fights back I'm the only physical
[11:57.800 --> 12:02.920]  conservative in the race I want a government that leaves me alone daddy

[12:46.680 --> 12:52.040]  we're not fighting them it's all a fraud we followed orders that is total
[12:52.040 --> 12:57.320]  rebel level statements by generals that's the modern equivalent of Operation
[12:57.320 --> 13:01.920]  Valkyrie trying to take Hitler out and it just is released like a little bit of
[13:01.920 --> 13:05.640]  smoke in the wind it dissipates you have multiple generals the deputy head of the

[17:12.280 --> 17:17.320]  takes over your operation students in California school district now
[17:17.320 --> 17:23.120]  guaranteed sees for doing nothing and that's what Obama now says get rid of
[17:23.120 --> 17:28.000]  federal testing first we pointed out no child left behind was about federalized
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.400]  education then turning it all into testing which would only cause things to
[17:33.400 --> 17:37.120]  break down even faster because the then all they do is spend time to pass test
[17:37.120 --> 17:41.840]  which is just regurgitating info we had top educators on to break it down now
[17:41.840 --> 17:45.280]  the test scores have dropped even more since forced federal testing it doesn't
[17:45.280 --> 17:49.200]  matter but now the feds are in control so they can order get rid of the testing
[17:49.200 --> 17:54.200]  see give us control we want testing sounds good we're gonna shut down these
[17:54.200 --> 17:59.800]  bad school districts now it's you know what 2 plus 2 equals 5 and you can sit
[17:59.800 --> 18:05.840]  there on your hands and get a C grade and pass students in California school
[18:05.840 --> 18:12.120]  district now guaranteed C grades for doing nothing that is just some of one
[18:12.120 --> 18:19.480]  stack of about 12 stacks today is he 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 stacks yes I
[18:19.480 --> 18:25.920]  kind of those correct let's continue Swedish media blame school massacre on
[18:25.920 --> 18:29.320]  immigration critics and youtubers the calm before the storm we have entered a
[18:29.320 --> 18:35.560]  period of dead calm in the stock market UN Paris climate hypocrisy limos and
[18:35.560 --> 18:39.600]  lear jets begin arriving months early to promote world government that's just
[18:39.600 --> 18:43.440]  some of what's coming up now let's continue with some of the headlines IRS
[18:43.440 --> 18:49.720]  possessed stingray cell phone surveillance here documents reveal the IRS
[18:49.720 --> 18:56.160]  across the United States put up fake cell towers and used mobile trucks in
[18:56.160 --> 19:05.320]  vans to scoop up everyone's data and record the connections totally illegal
[19:05.320 --> 19:08.520]  and remember we started covering stingrays five six years ago
[19:08.520 --> 19:12.120]  mckelphalan got secret documents out of Seattle with the feds putting them up
[19:12.120 --> 19:16.920]  everywhere there and then the FBI responded and said we don't know what
[19:16.920 --> 19:21.800]  they are it must be hackers because it's illegal and no one has fake cell
[19:21.800 --> 19:28.960]  towers in the government even the Department of the Interior and the BLM
[19:28.960 --> 19:34.200]  has bought thousands of them small police departments I saw one that bought
[19:34.200 --> 19:38.640]  40 of them they didn't even have 40 officers in the town in California I
[19:38.640 --> 19:42.560]  forget the town just type in California town buys 40 stingrays it was 44
[19:42.560 --> 19:47.800]  stingrays a few months ago and they just sit there listen everybody totally
[19:47.800 --> 19:53.560]  illegal totally violates the law it's all felonies but then they tell us if we
[19:53.560 --> 19:57.600]  catch you drinking a beer in your backyard we're gonna arrest you because
[19:57.600 --> 20:00.200]  we're slaves
[20:00.760 --> 20:06.440]  earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war each of us
[20:06.440 --> 20:10.440]  have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we
[20:10.440 --> 20:13.640]  typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the
[20:13.640 --> 20:17.920]  need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking about staying
[20:17.920 --> 20:22.160]  warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will I keep my
[20:22.160 --> 20:26.200]  family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the problem
[20:26.200 --> 20:30.680]  with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another
[20:30.680 --> 20:34.560]  concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in
[20:34.560 --> 20:38.640]  times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers
[20:38.640 --> 20:43.600]  may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers go to Fortress
[20:43.600 --> 20:47.960]  clothing comm again Fortress clothing comm has the answers to your heat
[20:47.960 --> 20:53.360]  storage dilemma don't get stuck in the cold Fortress clothing comm you'll

[21:02.680 --> 21:06.120]  are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by
[21:06.120 --> 21:09.160]  prescription but when we look at a product like survival shield nace and
[21:09.160 --> 21:13.440]  iodine x2 it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a
[21:13.440 --> 21:17.520]  hundred years the federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that
[21:17.520 --> 21:21.360]  iodine a crude form of it be added to table salt because of the incredible
[21:21.360 --> 21:25.160]  health problems that dietary deficiency and iodine was causing I want to
[21:25.160 --> 21:29.080]  challenge the listeners who've not tried x2 for yourselves what do you have to
[21:29.080 --> 21:32.440]  lose you are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're

[21:36.280 --> 21:40.040]  other people's lives that I know and the final reason to try x2 is that it's so
[21:40.040 --> 21:43.520]  hard to keep in stock we ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago
[21:43.520 --> 21:47.680]  and that is about to sell out it may be a month or two until more comes in I
[21:47.680 --> 21:51.760]  want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on survival shield x2

[24:15.560 --> 24:19.080]  two particular stories right now I'm gonna go back and blitz through like I
[24:19.080 --> 24:25.640]  just did another 50 60 70 articles coming up in the next segment you go to
[24:25.640 --> 24:33.800]  drudge report dot-com and scroll down on the left hand side you can see a info
[24:33.800 --> 24:38.560]  wars dot-com headline tied in with other headlines China's growing military
[24:38.560 --> 24:43.760]  built from stolen weapon designs that the Clintons and others help transfer to
[24:43.760 --> 24:49.200]  them and then above that Beijing not frightened to fight war with USA and more
[24:49.200 --> 24:53.480]  and more the Chinese government dictates what can be in US movies including
[24:53.480 --> 24:57.480]  the Martian and by the way I knew they had to be involved I went and looked it
[24:57.480 --> 25:01.000]  up the Chinese government was involved you look at yourself in the making of
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.840]  the Martian they are the saviors that save the astronauts in the movie with
[25:04.840 --> 25:08.760]  their boosters and their superior technology and it's just not true we
[25:08.760 --> 25:13.200]  use Russian boosters again I don't care if the Chinese really gave us boosters
[25:13.200 --> 25:17.600]  that were better than ours then fine have it in the movie but don't make it up
[25:17.600 --> 25:22.160]  and have it be Chinese Communist propaganda in the movie they couldn't
[25:22.160 --> 25:26.320]  even release red dawn for a year and a half the remake because the Chinese
[25:26.320 --> 25:33.320]  government got involved Michael Savage's book got shut down he normally is a
[25:33.320 --> 25:36.560]  number one or in the least the top five he's had a whole bunch of number one
[25:36.560 --> 25:41.520]  New York Times bestsellers it didn't even get into there his book about China
[25:41.520 --> 25:46.560]  they just killed it they just killed it and his book was a lot of coming war
[25:46.560 --> 25:50.280]  with China and they went to the publisher and it didn't get released
[25:50.280 --> 25:58.640]  anywhere and by the way he can't go to England I'm just using an example here
[25:58.640 --> 26:04.360]  of the censorship the control it's here folks it's here Beijing not frightened
[26:04.360 --> 26:11.080]  to fight a war with the USA that's a big story from info wars.com and we're
[26:11.080 --> 26:16.240]  going to be covering it all today coming up the next segment now I mentioned the
[26:16.240 --> 26:21.880]  IRS driving around with these stingray systems Google's got them to remember
[26:21.880 --> 26:25.760]  Google got caught quote breaking into Pascos grabbing cell phone data they
[26:25.760 --> 26:30.640]  all do it and that's the point it is a corporate and governmental criminal
[26:30.640 --> 26:39.200]  revolution against the law and that's why I get mad if I'm at big bend and to
[26:39.200 --> 26:44.520]  20 year old 21 year old cops show up while illegals are running across the
[26:44.520 --> 26:50.840]  border right in front of us and take people to jail or write them tickets
[26:50.840 --> 26:55.560]  going what's in your backpack I'm going to search it oh there's a beer you're
[26:55.560 --> 27:00.880]  not supposed to have that in the park you're going to jail is the government
[27:00.880 --> 27:05.760]  throws the book at us the taxpayers says oh follow all these laws that are
[27:05.760 --> 27:09.720]  unpopular Congress has a non-percent of approval rating state governments are
[27:09.720 --> 27:15.760]  unpopular we don't like what you're doing figured that out yet we got foreign
[27:15.760 --> 27:19.960]  banks robbing us but that said I don't want to just take note the average
[27:19.960 --> 27:24.360]  police officer because the globalists use mathematical political Hegelian
[27:24.360 --> 27:30.200]  dialectic programming they use equations there are political equations it's more
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.880]  of an art form than a science but it is mathematical that they create a culture
[27:35.880 --> 27:40.920]  in police it's bad they have them oppress us in many cases they then use
[27:40.920 --> 27:44.680]  that to run the good cops out who won't be part of it they then bring in federal
[27:44.680 --> 27:48.880]  control and say you can act like paramilitary thugs and target the public
[27:48.880 --> 27:53.120]  like they're the enemy and act like an occupying army but you've got to do it
[27:53.120 --> 28:00.840]  under our gang's control to have protection and I'm told by Bongino the
[28:00.840 --> 28:03.720]  famous Secret Service agent a lot of New York police have said a stuff it called
[28:03.720 --> 28:07.040]  in that a lot of New York cops are good people and like the show and I'm sure
[28:07.040 --> 28:10.760]  that's the case but when I've been in New York many times that is the most
[28:10.760 --> 28:15.960]  abusive the most aggressive the most hateful cops with their hats on sideways
[28:15.960 --> 28:23.080]  their bellies hanging out smoking cigarettes being rude to families I've
[28:23.080 --> 28:30.200]  seen cops rude to families in DC for no reason and as a man I know that's wrong
[28:30.200 --> 28:33.720]  in my heart when I see it and I've talked to Austin police and others that
[28:33.720 --> 28:37.160]  have been in New York or DC and had cops be rude to them they go no I've been
[28:37.160 --> 28:40.240]  yelled at her I've asked directions they're like do I look like a phone
[28:40.240 --> 28:46.120]  book to you I've seen a cop do that in New York I've had a cop come 300 yards
[28:46.120 --> 28:53.320]  it's on tape in in martial law my film made in 2005 comes up and starts
[28:53.320 --> 28:56.280]  screaming and shaking and he's gonna arrest me and he's gonna do all these
[28:56.280 --> 29:00.800]  things to me how dare I video tape them across the street I just said we're
[29:00.800 --> 29:05.480]  just journalists showing peer 57 the holding facility and he said I'm not
[29:05.480 --> 29:09.840]  gonna tell you again don't film and leave and start threatening us I mean
[29:09.840 --> 29:13.560]  that's not a free country folks it's not like they're arresting somebody on
[29:13.560 --> 29:16.280]  there with a camera 10 feet away in their face that's the part didn't tell
[29:16.280 --> 29:20.080]  the story earlier when I was I'm sitting there in a hot springs by the Rio
[29:20.080 --> 29:24.200]  Grand River open park there's like five six people in and I'm there with my
[29:24.200 --> 29:28.040]  family five or six folks I don't know couple of them are veterans couple of
[29:28.040 --> 29:32.000]  them are lawyers and these cops show up and they go you get out of the water
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.800]  come here and they were laughing at me and I said you know who I am they go
[29:34.800 --> 29:38.400]  yeah we know who you are Alex and I went wow you're pulling me out of the
[29:38.400 --> 29:41.600]  water to single me out and hope I'm drinking because of who I am they were
[29:41.600 --> 29:46.200]  laughing I said what you are or crooks I said you go ahead go ahead and push me
[29:46.200 --> 29:52.920]  and see what happens we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and
[29:52.920 --> 29:56.520]  the GCN radio network
[29:58.080 --> 30:03.440]  China has said that it's not afraid to fight a war with the US after a warship
[30:03.440 --> 30:07.800]  incident a guided missile destroyer violated the 12 nautical miles zone
[30:07.800 --> 30:11.640]  China claims around the mischief reefs an act that some people are calling a
[30:11.640 --> 30:16.240]  deliberate provocation China responded by warning and following the vessel
[30:16.240 --> 30:20.000]  before China's foreign ministry characterized the maneuvers as a threat
[30:20.000 --> 30:24.480]  to China's sovereignty Chinese state media outlet the Global Times said that
[30:24.480 --> 30:29.000]  Beijing should now prepare for the worst in that Beijing is not frightened to

[30:34.040 --> 30:38.680]  carry out anti-harassment operations we should first track the US warships if

[33:00.360 --> 33:07.760]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones don't fret
[33:07.760 --> 33:14.480]  on me love it or leave it well I love it I'm not gonna leave it but those who
[33:14.480 --> 33:20.120]  want me to bow down to be a slave have another thing coming let me finish up
[33:20.120 --> 33:23.320]  with the police story because I don't want to just tell it 10 seconds out to
[33:23.320 --> 33:27.160]  break and then hurry the story up and not get it exactly right but I'm gonna
[33:27.160 --> 33:30.600]  get into the really important news Beijing summons US ambassador of a
[33:30.600 --> 33:35.240]  warship in South China Sea this is escalating fast folks you notice what's
[33:35.240 --> 33:40.280]  happening in the global economy that's when these wars kick off there's a
[33:40.280 --> 33:45.720]  chance I don't think a majority chance I don't think statistically it's a
[33:45.720 --> 33:51.720]  probability there is a nice juicy minority chance 20 30% we're gonna see
[33:51.720 --> 33:57.560]  some type of limited war with China and that is a big big big percentage in my
[33:57.560 --> 34:01.680]  gut and that's dead reckoning and then of course we've got the situation with
[34:01.680 --> 34:06.120]  Russia and Ukraine and Syria that's a 20 10 20 30% chance that could expand
[34:06.120 --> 34:11.480]  it's already is expanding you start adding in all these
[34:11.480 --> 34:17.520]  probabilities it becomes a probability with all of the threats that
[34:17.520 --> 34:25.000]  something will kick off so that's all coming up that's how the London Guardian
[34:25.000 --> 34:28.240]  that headline I just read I want to get into Melissa Harris Perry in her latest
[34:28.240 --> 34:33.120]  outrage here in a moment while I was talking about the police state IRS
[34:33.120 --> 34:37.040]  possesses stingray cell phone surveillance gear documents reveal
[34:37.040 --> 34:42.680]  London Guardian the internal revenue service in its latest in a growing list
[34:42.680 --> 34:46.760]  of US federal agencies known to possess a sophisticated cell phone
[34:46.760 --> 34:50.400]  dragnet equipment known as stingray for new documents obtained by the Guardian
[34:50.400 --> 34:56.240]  and it goes over the fact that they've got fake cell towers mobile vehicles you
[34:56.240 --> 35:03.280]  name it and I put these things up with wide this is wide a proliferation of the
[35:03.280 --> 35:07.600]  very invasive surveillance technology close quote and they have put them up
[35:07.600 --> 35:13.000]  in different areas of the country but the feds are giving these to local
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.840]  departments small departments are getting enough for one per officer in
[35:16.840 --> 35:22.880]  places like California I mean it's crazy and then license plate reading systems
[35:22.880 --> 35:27.240]  and all the rest of it and major banks are coming out now city group saying
[35:27.240 --> 35:34.000]  they're gonna test eye scanning at ATMs and for banking when they go to biometrics
[35:34.000 --> 35:39.080]  folks that's when everything's cashless even if you still use cash it will track
[35:39.080 --> 35:43.880]  and trace you then they can raise taxes and game the economy to shut down
[35:43.880 --> 35:49.080]  anything that's not a globalist insider group this is one of the final balloons to
[35:49.080 --> 36:00.200]  go up one of the final flags one of the final signpost of just absolutely
[36:00.200 --> 36:04.880]  horrific control because as I've said many times once the cashless society
[36:04.880 --> 36:13.720]  control grid clicks into place it is a true technocratic ball and chain and if
[36:13.720 --> 36:16.640]  you're not in bed with a new world order if you're not playing ball the way they
[36:16.640 --> 36:20.160]  want you're not gonna be able to buy or sell people say well fine I'll just go
[36:20.160 --> 36:24.720]  along with it it's meant to shut down the economy and make you live under
[36:24.720 --> 36:29.640]  austerity to get you in a desperate position to then have forced inoculation
[36:29.640 --> 36:35.720]  forced medical procedures total social control living in giant compact urban
[36:35.720 --> 36:42.040]  cities being socially managed by technocrat political correct commissar
[36:42.040 --> 36:49.720]  officers on every floor literal 1984 go read that book you're going to live
[36:49.720 --> 36:56.480]  under that under agenda 21 this is a plan and they mean it and the austerity
[36:56.480 --> 37:03.680]  is here the prosperity the worm on the hook is about to get pulled off yes
[37:03.680 --> 37:08.160]  there's a delicious nutritious night crawler on the end of that hook but you
[37:08.160 --> 37:14.800]  bite into it there is a steel hook that's gonna go through your lip through
[37:14.800 --> 37:20.960]  your jaw and pull you up into another atmosphere that is hell itself and I
[37:20.960 --> 37:24.160]  know you haven't been up above the water to use this allegory you don't believe
[37:24.160 --> 37:27.560]  there's a whole universe out there and there's creatures that put these worms
[37:27.560 --> 37:31.800]  down on the water but I've been up there I've seen it and I'm telling you don't
[37:31.800 --> 37:39.800]  bite into it but here's the truth you don't need to be like a fish with a
[37:39.800 --> 37:43.520]  person trying to warn you you're a person to you do live in this world you
[37:43.520 --> 37:48.520]  could admit this stuff's going on just five years ago they had national news
[37:48.520 --> 37:53.480]  stories saying info wars was lying and that there were not fake cell phone
[37:53.480 --> 37:58.960]  towers by fake they're not real cell phone company towers that there weren't
[37:58.960 --> 38:02.360]  doppelganger cell towers with the government grabbing all your data
[38:02.360 --> 38:06.160]  listening to you in real time they're not just getting metadata that's illegal
[38:06.160 --> 38:12.840]  too and now it's all admitted look at this we reported on this ten years ago
[38:12.840 --> 38:18.640]  in upstate New York we reported on it scores of times since then with local
[38:18.640 --> 38:24.640]  sending us video of mobile x-ray vans where they put you in a giant x-ray
[38:24.640 --> 38:34.440]  machine way way way way beyond a chest x-ray and then they keep the whole thing
[38:34.440 --> 38:42.920]  secret NYPD caught caught see it's more secrecy more criminal revolution against
[38:42.920 --> 38:48.000]  the people outside of law and this is the feds the globalists the government
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.120]  doing it when folks get angry they want to just scapegoat the police that are
[38:52.120 --> 38:55.640]  following the orders and I'm not defending them following illegal orders
[38:55.640 --> 39:00.360]  the point is is that that's not where you make the change and you don't do it
[39:00.360 --> 39:04.160]  joining some Soros shoot the police movement that's only meant to
[39:04.160 --> 39:09.840]  destabilize the country and demonize any legitimate attempt to reform local
[39:09.840 --> 39:19.680]  police now under globalist influence this is an extreme tech they now would
[39:19.680 --> 39:26.280]  refuse to release the information NYPD caught using x-ray vans to search the
[39:26.280 --> 39:30.600]  public refuses court order to release the details that's all coming up as well
[39:30.600 --> 39:45.040]  and more detail but imagine I was there two years ago through almost three years
[39:45.040 --> 39:51.680]  ago with Rob do his son my dad and my son at Big Ben National Park down in
[39:51.680 --> 39:59.040]  South West Texas and going there since I was a kid and the park rangers are nice
[39:59.040 --> 40:02.080]  by and large the people are real nice we're into a lot of great listers down
[40:02.080 --> 40:08.380]  there this ties into all this and there is a place I like to go it's hot springs
[40:08.380 --> 40:11.880]  that are right on the Rio Grande this is not a heavily trafficked area it's not
[40:11.880 --> 40:15.760]  dangerous there's not a lot of crime there is some smuggling that goes on of
[40:15.760 --> 40:19.600]  small amounts of marijuana according to the DPS intelligence reports that are
[40:19.600 --> 40:23.920]  out there but it's relatively a low crime area compared to a hundred miles
[40:23.920 --> 40:29.360]  east that's absolutely super dangerous and places like Brownsville 200 miles
[40:29.360 --> 40:34.440]  east so there's no reason to have a bunch of cops running around when I was
[40:34.440 --> 40:40.740]  there two and a half years ago there and I just described these park police so
[40:40.740 --> 40:44.640]  people can know who they are this huge black guy look like a linebacker from
[40:44.640 --> 40:49.280]  the NFL I would see him around the park just freaking out and bowing up and
[40:49.280 --> 40:54.240]  staring at people with hatred and so I would drive by him when I saw him and
[40:54.240 --> 40:58.520]  look at him and smile and wave and he would actually bow up and and look like
[40:58.520 --> 41:03.360]  you want to attack me so I talked about that guy acting crazy because the first
[41:03.360 --> 41:06.920]  three or four times I saw him I thought is something wrong with that guy
[41:06.920 --> 41:12.320]  well I wonder what's in his weedies I mean you could probably guess but it's
[41:12.320 --> 41:16.320]  speculation but it did look like he was ready to you know chew trees and a
[41:16.320 --> 41:21.720]  toothpicks so this guy was running around you know basically like a wild man
[41:21.720 --> 41:30.240]  just in his body language acting crazed and so I talked about that in the video
[41:30.240 --> 41:34.840]  we shot and then I'm sitting there on the last day my son is sitting there
[41:34.840 --> 41:38.200]  swimming in the river it's barely going by like you know two miles an hour maybe
[41:38.200 --> 41:45.640]  there's an old you know I shot video the illegals riding across and stuff and
[41:45.640 --> 41:50.640]  there's an old place that was built there in the 20s basically a fat farm in
[41:50.640 --> 41:54.840]  the 20s with four or five buildings some big palm trees it's all fallen in and
[41:54.840 --> 41:58.640]  it used to be an enclosure but now it's down to the water's edge about three
[41:58.640 --> 42:02.800]  feet deep a hot spring with a volcanic hot spring that's about a hundred and
[42:02.800 --> 42:07.600]  three degrees I mean it is perfect natives have been going there for
[42:07.600 --> 42:12.280]  thousands of years and there's hardly anybody there usually so we're there and
[42:12.280 --> 42:17.000]  there's a bunch of UT alumni lawyers I was talking to them and they're all like
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.960]  40 years old they're standing in the middle of the Rio Grande throwing a
[42:20.960 --> 42:25.640]  football we have video of this back and forth
[42:25.640 --> 42:34.080]  while illegals are riding back and forth on both sides on horses okay the board
[42:34.080 --> 42:39.120]  patrol just ignores us ignores them the park police come in and if they can't
[42:39.120 --> 42:43.280]  find anybody drinking is there a sign saying no drinking they will just start
[42:43.280 --> 42:46.240]  saying have you been drinking if I was going to be here okay that's it stand
[42:46.240 --> 42:48.240]  over here I'm digging through your stuff because the people are dumb enough to
[42:48.240 --> 42:54.080]  just even respond to this and they start searching everyone and we don't mean a
[42:54.080 --> 42:57.240]  bunch of trashy people drunk I mean these are like nice families whatever
[42:57.240 --> 43:01.760]  they'll dig through your stuff they'll find a beer can they'll say come back to
[43:01.760 --> 43:05.040]  the police car with me they'll have a patty wagon come and I sat there and
[43:05.040 --> 43:13.560]  watch them arresting people so imagine this time I'm not gonna be drinking when
[43:13.560 --> 43:17.400]  I'm down there because what I saw last time thank God I've been hiking with the
[43:17.400 --> 43:20.760]  kids I wasn't ringing that time they arrested basically most of the people
[43:20.760 --> 43:30.200]  except us so but but it wasn't the the NFL style black guy this time it was a
[43:30.200 --> 43:38.960]  couple of nerdly white guys that showed up and did this sort of arresting people
[43:38.960 --> 43:57.760]  so then it's the next day and I'm there and I'm sitting there and more cops show
[43:57.760 --> 44:05.560]  up and there is a man and a woman sitting by each other on the ledge holding
[44:05.560 --> 44:08.640]  hands like a man and woman who kind of leaning towards each other and they just
[44:08.640 --> 44:13.640]  stand there that the same two white guys like six foot tall kind of skinny
[44:13.640 --> 44:16.560]  goofy and they sit there looking at us with their hands on their guns and they
[44:16.560 --> 44:19.360]  look at them and just keep staring and they walk over to the edge of the grass
[44:19.360 --> 44:24.480]  and the bamboo and they're standing there looking and it's hard to tell the
[44:24.480 --> 44:28.120]  story as I'm pulling it up in exact memory and telling it exactly as it
[44:28.120 --> 44:32.520]  happened and they go what are you doing like something I deliverance what are
[44:32.520 --> 44:38.840]  you doing and the guy and the lady look them they go excuse us what are you
[44:38.840 --> 44:43.120]  doing what do you think you're doing we're not doing anything so they were
[44:43.120 --> 44:46.840]  acting like it was illegal that they were sitting there holding hands and
[44:46.840 --> 44:54.840]  talking her in a bikini he in his shorts and they go what's you drinking the guy
[44:54.840 --> 44:59.520]  goes my coolers right there if you want to go look you come out and do it comes
[44:59.520 --> 45:03.880]  and opens it there's like some Coca-Cola iced tea stuff what's in that tea and
[45:03.880 --> 45:06.360]  they're just like hey man at that point I start saying something to them start
[45:06.360 --> 45:12.360]  going to get my camera and they back off and leave well this time it's Sunday
[45:12.360 --> 45:16.080]  I'm sitting there it's like 68 degrees I'm in the hot tub the storm was at the
[45:16.080 --> 45:20.960]  day before it's crystal clear skies totally beautiful this is a microcosm of
[45:20.960 --> 45:24.960]  the world obviously I'm not going to be drinking down there knowing it's total
[45:24.960 --> 45:29.640]  police state number one plus I just hiked at least five miles uphill I did
[45:29.640 --> 45:33.360]  two hikes that were each over two and a half miles uphill I'm not counting
[45:33.360 --> 45:39.680]  downhill so I climbed two mountains that day it's like 430 I've been guzzling
[45:39.680 --> 45:44.240]  water my legs are aching my quads are on fire so I'm not in that good a shape
[45:44.240 --> 45:48.440]  obviously you know five plus miles uphill in one day and I mean I'm talking
[45:48.440 --> 45:54.940]  steep a lot of it and and I'm type casting that's where it is each group
[45:54.940 --> 46:01.840]  one was hillbillies one was a crazed black guy this time it's like to look
[46:01.840 --> 46:06.600]  like 16 and 20 Hispanic police officers kind of the socialist you know
[46:06.600 --> 46:12.080]  university trendies and they walk up and they see me sitting there and they
[46:12.080 --> 46:14.720]  start laughing and talking to each other pointing and they go come here get out
[46:14.720 --> 46:19.840]  of the water you get out and I went you recognize me don't he goes yeah I do
[46:19.840 --> 46:26.520]  Alex get out of the water he was so happy he goes what's in that cup over
[46:26.520 --> 46:31.480]  there I go water you know there you know you disrespect me drinking the alcohol
[46:31.480 --> 46:36.160]  before I got here and I went you disrespect yourself they start asking
[46:36.160 --> 46:39.080]  people questions I go hey man he's just setting you up taking back to your car
[46:39.080 --> 46:43.240]  find something take you to jail I go you guys are shameful I mean this country's
[46:43.240 --> 46:49.360]  gonna collapse and fall they go you can just you can just move over there now and
[46:49.360 --> 46:53.320]  I sat there and I watched them of course I like I said my cell phone was dead in
[46:53.320 --> 46:57.200]  the car because I'd forgot it in the hotel room hotel room and I just sat
[46:57.200 --> 47:01.200]  there and after about watching them come go back and forth and haul people off
[47:01.200 --> 47:06.360]  to go put them you know in handcuffs 300 yards away I just had to leave and it
[47:06.360 --> 47:14.480]  ruined my last day and a half because this isn't America folks I mean imagine
[47:14.480 --> 47:21.920]  two hillbilly guys going I mean literal hillbilly type guys in their uniform and
[47:21.920 --> 47:26.280]  see every groups got their crazed weirdos but that's who wants to go join the
[47:26.280 --> 47:30.360]  park services armed police that's who they want they want a crazed black guy
[47:30.360 --> 47:33.920]  they want creepy hillbilly white guys they want guys with chip on their
[47:33.920 --> 47:39.040]  shoulders you know little socialist trendy types who walked up saw me sort of
[47:39.040 --> 47:45.800]  talking laughing they've got bodycams on they go you get out of the water like I
[47:45.800 --> 47:49.480]  was gonna crap my britches and roll over there I was like excuse me so you know
[47:49.480 --> 47:58.760]  who I am yeah I know you are Alex now get out is that your silver toy on a
[47:58.760 --> 48:04.880]  truck no it's not who's is it with the beer can in the back and there's these
[48:04.880 --> 48:09.360]  two guys from Austin who's like you got a drink of beer in the parking lot get out
[48:09.360 --> 48:13.880]  of the water and it was the hatred of America that did you say I mean I imagine
[48:13.880 --> 48:16.880]  a man and a woman are sitting there and there's a weird two weird hillbilly guys
[48:16.880 --> 48:22.480]  with their hands on their guns going what's he doing over there I mean it is
[48:22.480 --> 48:26.560]  just bizarre folks
[48:26.960 --> 48:34.080]  absolutely bizarre in this country and there were illegals crossing at that
[48:34.080 --> 48:39.600]  very time last time I was able to catch footage of it and then when they showed
[48:39.600 --> 48:43.560]  up and they saw the folks throwing the football they're like what are you doing
[48:43.560 --> 48:54.000]  we're throwing a football by the way in the park brochure in the park brochure
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.480]  effect I meant to bring it back to me today it says we don't lack you getting
[48:57.480 --> 49:01.720]  in the Rio Grande you know they have all these rafting you know groups that take
[49:01.720 --> 49:06.960]  you I'm gonna do that again soon haven't done in years we discourage you getting
[49:06.960 --> 49:12.480]  in the river this is a desert park not a swimming park and so that's all they're
[49:12.480 --> 49:17.560]  there to do is just run everybody off because we're American scum we pay the
[49:17.560 --> 49:22.480]  taxes of the government and that's it we're here to be fed on and I just
[49:22.480 --> 49:27.520]  watched nice people both times I'm there now I've been there three times but two
[49:27.520 --> 49:34.480]  trips and I watched them with predatory eyes and that's what people don't like
[49:34.480 --> 49:38.480]  most police aren't predatory in my experience most of them genuinely want
[49:38.480 --> 49:41.360]  to help people they want to get bad guys they're not allowed to throughout
[49:41.360 --> 49:45.240]  their generating revenue but these people I ran into whether they were black
[49:45.240 --> 49:48.160]  whether they were white whether they were Hispanic they were all on crazy
[49:48.160 --> 49:57.480]  power trips and they were un-American in my view they were bizarre they were
[49:57.480 --> 50:06.120]  enjoying what they were doing and imagine singling someone out because you

[54:09.520 --> 54:13.320]  hour it's huge basically threatening war with the United States over the ship
[54:13.320 --> 54:19.520]  going through what until a year ago was international waters so China is being a
[54:19.520 --> 54:25.000]  progressive here again China is another predatory power group just because our
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.440]  government's been taken over by criminals doesn't mean our military's
[54:27.440 --> 54:31.800]  criminals and it doesn't mean China who sells its political dissidents organs
[54:31.800 --> 54:36.440]  isn't even more evil in some respects than the Anglo-American establishment
[54:36.440 --> 54:40.360]  but I don't know who's more evil the Chinese Communist or the Anglo-American
[54:40.360 --> 54:43.960]  establishment probably the Anglo-American establishment because they put the
[54:43.960 --> 54:50.320]  chai comms in charge in 49 and then I'm gonna get into Melissa Harris Perry
[54:50.320 --> 54:55.840]  saying saying someone's hard-working is racist I'm not getting obviously it's
[54:55.840 --> 54:59.960]  viral it broke yesterday outrage grows after South Carolina officer throws
[54:59.960 --> 55:04.400]  student in the classroom and the police the sheriff's department's defending it
[55:04.400 --> 55:08.920]  look he totally slams her backwards there's way too much excessive force
[55:08.920 --> 55:15.960]  could have simply made her get up doesn't puts her in a chokehold throws her
[55:15.960 --> 55:20.560]  down on the ground to punish her and they have the threat continuum they
[55:20.560 --> 55:23.320]  teach police and all this and the truth is they've turned all these guys into
[55:23.320 --> 55:29.760]  want to be many of these guys into want to be UFC fighters and you need to
[55:29.760 --> 55:34.880]  actually get in mixed martial arts and fight people your own size if you want
[55:34.880 --> 55:38.760]  to do that I get the kids are spoiled brats in many cases I get cheated and
[55:38.760 --> 55:43.040]  get up when you told her to I understand that they've made discipline
[55:43.040 --> 55:46.640]  breakdown you can't paddle kids or make them run till they throw up so now cops
[55:46.640 --> 55:52.400]  have to come taser I don't think this is a racial issue it's a white guy doing
[55:52.400 --> 55:58.560]  it to a black girl 16 this is how cops respond to people and it is it's not
[55:58.560 --> 56:01.440]  proportionate I don't care if you say it's proportionate the government has
[56:01.440 --> 56:05.400]  the NSA spying on us the government ships the drugs in the government nitpicks
[56:05.400 --> 56:11.200]  people constantly folks are sick of it and so you don't need to act like this
[56:11.200 --> 56:16.320]  and most police I don't think would have acted like this they would have simply
[56:16.320 --> 56:20.120]  told her get up tried to pick her up then charge her with resisting when she
[56:20.120 --> 56:23.160]  started to resist what she didn't do now of course they're charging her with a
[56:23.160 --> 56:28.200]  bunch of stuff but we can get your take on that as well and take some phone

[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:33.920]  Alex Jones up on info wars.com you have a key graphic Hillary Clinton we're
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.760]  going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good that was a
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:42.680]  quote a few years ago Hillary Clinton we just added a new image to the site that
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:47.600]  I'm gonna refresh these excellent image graphics that Kurt Nemo makes and here's
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.160]  the latest quote we've got from George Soros he made this a few months ago
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:55.760]  there is a real danger that China will align itself with Russia politically and
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:02.480]  militarily and then the threat of world war becomes real George Soros I love it
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:07.680]  when you stir something up and you're one of the main drivers of setting the
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.000]  fire and then you call the fire department in and say look I warned of
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:20.920]  fires there's not many people that we can point at and say that they've been
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.680]  more involved in global destabilization in Ukraine the Arab Spring in the
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:30.640]  Middle East and North Africa now spreading all over Africa the situation
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:38.200]  with China and Soros wants to bring down every country and bring in a world
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:43.680]  government he's a master parasite that's what's so disgusting about this and
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.800]  I'm gonna go to break this is short segment come back again into China and
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.720]  Melissa Harris Perry saying hard work is racist and I'm not kidding she actually
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:02:00.920]  says it but getting back to the police issue the globalists are trying to start
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.680]  a third world war with the Russians and the Chinese they've turned loose radical
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:09.120]  Islam worldwide they're using the threat to take our freedoms the government
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.880]  has been caught at the highest levels engaged in organized crime in an attempt
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.960]  to shut down any independent local economies the globalists want us all to
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.320]  be poor and have austerity they're targeting every American I don't care
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:25.400]  if you're black white Hispanic I saw a comment this weekend on info wars like
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:30.440]  I screen-shotted it it's probably trying to pull it up and read it and the
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:36.360]  writer was saying I'm white 30 years ago our Christmas parties look like the
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.640]  Waltons nothing but white people and it wasn't because we were racist it was
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:44.960]  because everybody we knew was white now our Christmas parties look like the
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:49.640]  United Nations I've got friends of every race color and creed all I care about in
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.640]  working businesses hiring people to get the job done and are nice people I like
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:57.360]  the music and culture of everybody but I'm sick of hearing I'm bad because I'm
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.960]  white especially what the guy paraphrases and says and that's what it is
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:06.400]  it's meant to make everybody uncomfortable they double-crossed us as
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:12.480]  social engineers I mean 20 years ago I hear the old-timers go you may think
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.280]  it's good to work with all these other groups and I'm not racist against
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:19.120]  anybody but the globalists are gonna turn it around racially once they're done
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:24.360]  it's what the communists do in other countries and I guess that's true and
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:28.200]  it's a double-cross against everybody there's people are told they're winning
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.560]  because they racially do something whites would go with the South and the
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.880]  Democrats even though 2% owned slaves this is on record historically this is
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.920]  well-known it's not debated they would go along with slavery and being oppressed
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.880]  as sharecroppers because at least they could feel like they were better than
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:51.520]  black slaves but still it was unpopular in many areas and many towns and
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:57.320]  counties wouldn't tolerate it look it up and so people use his political
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:02.040]  control and that's what's going on now obviously is divide and conquer I'm not
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:08.080]  telling you something you don't know but now that people are integrating now
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.320]  that people are working together now that I mean I probably half the
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.880]  couples I see out there mixed couples I mean people are just getting along we're
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:20.480]  just humans they then double-cross all that and energize the homogeneous
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:25.240]  immigrant groups that are coming in who still are racial still in their group
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.640]  that's all they got their new they're scared and the Democrats go it's good
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:32.520]  and whites hate you and they want to get you the Democrats love you we're your
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:36.440]  family now and here's your here's your racist organization and you're supposed
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:39.840]  to be part of it but here's your tenants you take the guns and you vote for
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.880]  socialism and you support corporate welfare can you repeat that back to me
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:48.880]  and so that's why everything's being energized racially right now is because
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:55.200]  it's meant to fry society it's a sabotage operation it's criminal it's
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:01.400]  premeditated look at Europe while many restaurants are cracking down on patrons
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:05.240]  who pack heat one restaurant is giving discounts to concealed carriers
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:10.320]  following a robbery Papa Ryu owner Art Bouvier announced on Facebook Saturday

[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:04.880]  genesis communications radio network probably presents the alex jones show
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:11.960]  because there's a war on for your mind there are two new planned parenthood
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:17.240]  videos out in one of them the abortionist says it would be great to
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:23.520]  burn unborn babies as fuel I was so consumed with fetal tissue that I was
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:32.560]  ready to have a bonfire and then in another video they talk about how they
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:38.280]  want to get the heads intact so they can sell the fully intact brains for
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:44.880]  different types of medical work and see they spin this as bush wants to ban
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:53.200]  embryonic stem cell it's just embryos so they banned using tiny embryos but
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:58.840]  full-sized babies more than three weeks old up to nine months you can keep that
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:05.680]  baby alive and just dissected however you want that's why some abortuaries now
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.200]  are trying to convince women to have a caesarean with an eight-month-old baby
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:13.240]  they go over to take it out of your stomach it's just better than doing it
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:17.560]  inside because they don't want to chop the baby up they need to keep it alive
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:24.520]  for the harvesting and I'm sorry to be so macabre here but that's coming up at
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:28.400]  the bottom of the hour that's what's going on we're not covering this because
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:36.840]  Halloween is here now before I get into the mega massive news on China let's
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:41.920]  get into the social engineering news Melissa Harris Perry is this social
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:47.080]  engineer professor works with the White House and basically programs and
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:52.880]  directs the political correct war-making activities of MSNBC through the
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.400]  directors of media matters and others I know this because I see the talking
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:02.880]  points come out of the White House to media matters and then from media
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:08.680]  matters he does word-for-word vomited out of her mouth into the other little
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:13.600]  baby birds mouths and then they were good to hit it back on the public so she
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:20.880]  feeds the MSNBC brood and then and then they vomit it or repeat it back on to
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:25.080]  us and of course she famously says that we've got to get past the side of the
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:28.240]  kids belong to their parents the kids belong to us a community and in an
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.400]  ancient sense they can say you know in a village people kept other kids in line
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.040]  like the coaches if you got caught fighting will give you pops and make you
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:41.080]  go run now they don't do that how dare you touch my kid that's a real local
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:44.600]  community actually doing something about your kid but now oh the police can
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.800]  come in and taser them or shoot them though or if you want to leave your
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:53.000]  parents when you're 10 you can sue and you know go become transgendered or
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.760]  whatever you want make that decision and oh when you're 10 they're offering you
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.640]  a $200 credit card line they found that's the number in California you can
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.320]  announce you want to be inoculated even though your parents say no but that
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.080]  didn't work the last two years they just said you know what we're gonna shoot
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:12.280]  your kid up whether you like it or not we have the parental rights as the school
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:17.600]  and they argued in court and one in federal court was it five years ago then
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:21.200]  it got overturned but now they just by law ignored that and they said no we are
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.960]  the parents we have parental rights as well you're like well that's
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:30.480]  revolutionary yes these are revolutionaries and they're training us to
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.680]  accept they're training us to bow down but the good news is and I mentioned this
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.800]  at the start of the broadcast I'm gonna repeat it again I drove the eight hours
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:48.880]  from Austin Texas to Big Bend down at the very bottom of Southwest Texas every
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:55.240]  gas station I stopped at every restaurant I stopped at there and back the
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:03.040]  clerks were listeners everyone the hotel I stayed in one day before I went to the
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:13.040]  park bunch of listeners there a ton of them then hiking all over listeners I
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:18.440]  have never and then coming back in Alpine pulled into a gas station guy
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:22.240]  behind the counter goes your voice sounds familiar is that you Alex I was
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.760]  just listening to you the other day I go what's your name all my name is
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:32.960]  Corky Corky and the other fellow counter was like smiling and nodding and then I
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.560]  stopped at another gas station before I got to Austin outside Fredericksburg
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:40.440]  listeners then I went in a restaurant in Fredericksburg bunch of listeners I
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:45.200]  mean it's just and I'm not bragging the globalists need to know them I don't
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:48.520]  know what actuaries you've got I've got a lot of high-tech stuff beyond Google
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:52.240]  Analytics we can't figure out how we're reaching the spending people we know
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:58.320]  we're reaching four or five million a day just on YouTube we know that we're
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:01.760]  reaching three or four million a day on terrestrial radio and hundreds of other
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:07.120]  platforms we can't add it all up we know our reach on just social media is
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:12.360]  over a billion people a month that that we are that see our headlines that that
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:17.480]  see our memes that see our material a billion people that's a conservative
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:23.080]  number it's actually 1.6 so I'm not bragging here when I'm giving everybody
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:28.400]  negative scary news I want you to also know that incredibly positive things
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:34.120]  are happening because obviously most of you aren't a prominent liberty figure
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.880]  here in the United States or worldwide and so you feel like you're alone let
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.880]  me tell you we are not alone and that's why the system so scared that's why
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:47.680]  they're being bold saying we're gonna forcibly inoculate we're gonna tell your
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:52.880]  kid what sex they are we're gonna set up checkpoints and search your vehicle
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:56.400]  without warrants we're gonna take your cash away we're gonna make you a retina
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.520]  scan to buy and sell we're gonna buy armored vehicles they're for gun owners
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.320]  we're gonna build giant FEMA camps for gun owners I mean this is all admitted
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:10.720]  now because the message went out and I talked to
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:19.920]  okay it's beyond Fight Club because I'm sitting there at this hot spring where
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:24.200]  the police are harassing people and they drag one group off to arrest them
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:29.800]  interrogate them and I'm sitting there and there's this guy who had just arrived
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:36.320]  there with his wife and you can tell he was a you know tough ombre he pulls his
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.600]  shirt off he's always military tattoos and I said man it you know look out if
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.200]  you got any beard and try to arrest you he goes I know that's all they want to
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.880]  do is play soldier and you know mess with everybody but the world will end up
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:50.240]  you know teaching him in the end he goes have a good day Alex I mean it was
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:55.120]  like Twilight Zone I was like everybody knows who I am now
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:03.760]  it's just crazy and so the system knows that to a certain extent but I'm only
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:07.520]  one person in the Liberty Movement there are thousands of prominent people now
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:13.520]  none of course probably as big as I am there's Matt Drudge is bigger who else
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.880]  is there bigger in total reach and of course he basically smart and you don't
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:23.960]  know what he looks like now he understands the danger rather so he
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:27.000]  doesn't want to physically be noticed and boy believe me I wish I was in that
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.440]  same position I envy what he's been able to do
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:40.720]  but I'm telling you there's a lot of power this show has and that's why I
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:43.480]  try to be even more careful about what I say and what I do because it can be
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:49.040]  twisted and I don't have any ill will against anybody who's not consciously
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:55.560]  part of this anti-human conspiracy but Melissa Harris Perry is there praying on
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:16:02.800]  her listeners and viewers and when I say praying on she wants to have basket case
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:07.840]  level mentally ill viewers and listeners what she's doing is a
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:14.080]  psychological warfare tactic you guys pull up that Atlantic monthly article
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:19.040]  from two weeks ago I forget the exact headline about how the kids are being
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:24.040]  made just to be completely mentally ill and to have panic attacks there it is
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:28.960]  the coddling of the American mind and it goes on how under political correctness
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:34.960]  they are literal panic attack mentally ill cult members that that think brown
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:40.720]  socks are racist and brown bags are racist and they say oh it's terrible we
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:45.960]  the liberals have to save these new totalitarians who think they're liberal I
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:51.320]  don't know if Luke and Dorff who wrote this seems pretty smart it's a 28-page
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.840]  article actually doesn't understand it's part of the plan or wants to play the
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:02.680]  part of the opposition to the dialectic so they can control the narrative but
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.000]  everybody I know who's in the left and I mean everybody is freaking out right
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.880]  now and how totalitarian their kids are well you asked for it you wanted it you
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:16.080]  did it you look at the photo it's a little kid with a sword charging up to
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:23.760]  the top of a fort conquering words and if you look at that they're kind of
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.440]  telling you hey this is our cultural revolution this is our Marxist army this
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:33.760]  is our red terror this is our Maoist youth brigade and by the way every youth
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:37.920]  brigade I've run into whether it's in New York or in Denver or Austin or LA
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:44.120]  call themselves Mao youth brigades I've got them on tape in New York Denver
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:47.800]  Austin and they'll tell me they said we're coming for you we're gonna kill
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:52.680]  you our time's coming yeah you go ahead youth brigades you're just to
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:56.360]  intimidate all the jellyfish in the colleges you won't be doing any of the
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:01.200]  real fighting you idiots they'll be the first people the globalists get rid of
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:07.440]  once they've come to full power you're just a little cultural police but Perry
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:15.520]  when I use that key word praying she is a wolf a Tigris focusing on you the
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:20.280]  little little ding ding dear and she gets you in a position of being guilty a
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.720]  position of being freaked out of wanting to comply of wanting to be good of
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.640]  wanting to have hospitality of wanting to okay I so just being wider having any
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:33.320]  money or being intellectual or reading a book is bad or or saying we like we
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:38.720]  should all be one humanity no that's racist that's racist that's what UT
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:44.040]  psychology teaches we are not we we are in our groups
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:50.960]  see first they get you in the we mode to give up any culture you had to get to
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:58.040]  open yourself up and it would be great if they were really pushing for humanity
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:02.080]  is one human culture for greater goals and empower the individual and make it
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:06.240]  about the individual and free association but no it's give up your
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:13.160]  individuality and accept whatever our new download to us whatever the new
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:20.000]  prescribed message is that's what you've got to accept that's what you've got to
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.280]  submit to we're gonna go to break come back with the Melissa Harris Berry and
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:27.680]  then the Planned Parenthood clips and all the rest of it the truth is these are
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:32.080]  a bunch of parasites whether it's Planned Parenthood selling babies body parts
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.680]  are China keeping political distance alive and then slowly harvesting their
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:42.120]  organs things beyond science fiction horror they know how to manipulate
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:45.640]  good men and women of every race color and creed into letting them be the bosses

[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:26.340]  armored vehicles and he said they were for the gun owners and the veterans
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:31.980]  that I saw at army.mil they admitted they were preparing FEMA camps for gun
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:36.460]  owners and veterans not a processor social security numbers so I peacefully
[01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:42.900]  started trying to warn people and so they said I was a terrorist so I warned
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:49.740]  more people so the people bought hundreds of millions of firearms and got ready to
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:54.540]  defend their families and I just wonder if the globalists and their minions are
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:58.260]  really stupid enough to try this maneuver let's start a war with China start
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:14.100]  war with Russia turn al-qaeda loose all over the world start fights with patriots
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:25.140]  let me get into Melissa Harris Perry here is Melissa Harris Perry you've heard
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:30.500]  of her before here's her on your family very collective notion of these are our
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:34.060]  children so part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea
[01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:37.460]  that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:40.700]  recognize that kids belong to whole communities once it's everybody's
[01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:44.020]  responsibility and not just the households then we start making better
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:48.380]  investments then they say lean forward which is an actual Karl Marx communist
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:57.380]  slogan now here she is saying be careful about saying someone's a hard worker
[01:25:57.380 --> 01:26:01.700]  talking about Paul Ryan this is Democrats promoting him going he's a hard
[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:05.540]  worker and he'll work with Pelosi and he'll work with Reed and he'll work with
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:10.780]  Obama she's like whoa whoa whoa I'm the thought police I'm the language police
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:18.060]  hard worker meaning he gets a lot done the slaves were hard workers women were
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:21.060]  hard workers what does this have that there's slaves in Africa right now
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:25.740]  there's slaves in Saudi Arabia people for all intents and purposes in areas of
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:29.180]  Latin America are slaves where are the groups complaining no it's only about
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:39.020]  projecting guilt on the West the West ended slavery England ended slavery
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:45.900]  started ending it 200 years ago they almost ended it in the Declaration of
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:50.460]  Independence in the first Constitution but a civil war was gonna happen so they
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:55.980]  couldn't the point is no one living has any guilt but but this is it just it's
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:58.980]  not about mathematics it's not about history it's not about geography it's
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:04.660]  not about separation of powers it's not about deficits it's about have faith in
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:10.140]  the state have faith in the system and how dare you use the word hard worker
[01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:16.260]  that's hurtful too always expanding what you can't use what you can't say you
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:23.900]  can only use the words she says what she says let's go to the club but let's be
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:28.460]  fair if there's somebody who is a hard worker when he goes to Washington is
[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:31.900]  Paul Ryan not only works for Republicans but Democrats you know it's what
[01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:34.100]  that very well that I work on the immigration issue trying to get
[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:38.700]  lost let's back it up now she's got a hand-packing because obviously Ryan says
[01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:42.980]  he'll get rid of the borders in a you giant do log to drive down the wages it'll
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:46.380]  drive down Mexican wages our wages Canadian wages it's about exploiting
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:52.420]  laborers okay and I don't blame the Latin American laborers because they're
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:55.180]  smart they'll come up here and get a job you can't live on and get welfare to
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:59.140]  survive whatever they want to thrive and prosper the point is it's being
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:02.980]  exacerbated by the globalist so this guy's in there going hey Paul Ryan's
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:08.820]  good he wants to get rid of the borders and uh-huh you can't have a man being good
[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:12.180]  even if he's doing what the globalist want I'm gonna have to come in and
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:20.140]  hand-pack right now and bring this up to a new level that men can't be hard
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:26.380]  working because that puts down women and slaves what nobody didn't say women
[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:30.460]  weren't hard-working again but just someone getting in a plush makes
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:34.840]  everybody else feel bad so let's get rid of grades see where this is going this
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:39.900]  is cult level that's why she runs MSNBC's propaganda because she is there as
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:44.700]  a scientist to wreck people's minds and she knows it let's go back to it but
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:49.780]  let's be fair if there's somebody who is a hard worker he goes to Washington is
[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:53.180]  Paul Ryan not only works the Republicans but Democrats you know as well
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:55.340]  that very well that I work on the immigration issue trying to get
[01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:58.420]  Republicans to support immigration reform Paul Ryan is somebody who has
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:01.260]  supported immigration reform has worked with somebody like Luis Gutierrez
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:05.380]  Luis Gutierrez is very respectful speaks highly of Paul Ryan this is
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:09.700]  somebody who's trying to govern I feel you but I just want I just want to
[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:12.460]  pause on one thing because I don't disagree with you that I actually think
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:16.580]  mr. Ryan is a great choice for this role but I want us to be super careful when
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:23.020]  we use the language hard worker because I mean I actually keep an image of folks
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:27.820]  working in cotton fields on my office wall because it is a reminder about what
[01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:31.980]  hard work looks like so I feel you that he's a hard worker I do but in the
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:37.460]  context of relative privilege and I just we're gonna come back by the rest of it
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:41.500]  but you understand she says in the image in your mind that she says see the
[01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:44.940]  image to her viewers so they'll have some drink it too and just be all freaked
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:48.860]  out and only trust her while she wants you to take shots though take your
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:30:00.100]  car to show Alex Jones and the GCN radio network coming up this Wednesday the

[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:20.700]  of them are pretty much fixed horses just like Trump has said himself picks up
[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:23.780]  the phone at three in the morning he calls whoever the candidate is he says
[01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:27.060]  hey I need you to do this favor for me then they hop up and do it he's saying
[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:30.380]  that the political system is broken and I could not agree more with that we're
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:34.260]  doing this more as a way to educate the general public about the left-right

[01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:44.900]  they're gonna be talking about this time around are gonna be taxes retirement

[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:48.900]  i feel you but but i just want i just want to pause on one thing because i i
[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:52.100]  don't disagree with you that i actually think mr ryan is a great choice for this
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:56.100]  role but i want us to be super careful when we use the language hard worker
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:59.780]  back it up again because i mean i want to back it up to
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:03.780]  the beginning actually because you've got you know one of these democratic pundits
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:07.700]  on there saying hey he's great he wants open borders he'll work with us
[01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:13.300]  one of the main leaders of the north american union operation you know
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:17.860]  thinks he's wonderful we need to go for this guy not be bashing
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:20.980]  and you've got all the people around the table representing what group
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:24.820]  they're supposedly with this is the broken coalition strategy
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:29.540]  but then she says every everything she says is scientifically focused and crafted
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:32.260]  and been thought about beforehand and scripted
[01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:38.420]  i keep an image of slaves to remember every day what hard work looks like
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:42.580]  and so let's not talk about hard work so no one
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:48.020]  could paint a painting no one could build a building no one could write a song
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:56.500]  no one could go out and help a charity no one can succeed no one can be
[01:35:56.500 --> 01:36:01.780]  recognized without remembering slavery and then
[01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:06.020]  associating it with yourself and having guilt
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:10.660]  and then by that she means her you have to do what she says
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:14.500]  you have to talk like she says it's racist if you're against obonacare
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:20.260]  it's racist if you don't turn your guns in you've got to do what she says which
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:23.940]  is a new form of slavery your kids belong to her
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:28.660]  your kids belong to the state and it's not enough that paul ryan wants to get
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:32.980]  rid of the borders it's not enough he's a globalist
[01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:35.620]  we all know he's got a short haircut and wears a suit
[01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:39.780]  just like the man she corrects and it's also about that
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:46.740]  you can't have a man make a point even if you agree with it
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:50.980]  without slapping him down a little bit just so all the women watching
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:54.820]  learn how to keep your men in line to create discord
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:58.820]  and so men no longer marry there are no longer children the women are all
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:01.940]  desperate and alone the states they're their man he's
[01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:07.540]  gonna pimp him out on the street all focused to leave you alone
[01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:11.860]  all focused to destroy you all focused to turn you into a mental patient
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:15.540]  and to make women's culture not being strong and not
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:19.780]  having babies and not building great homes and and working if they want to
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:23.540]  but but ending the human species as we know it
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:31.220]  this is war this is war with these people and no group has to be as oppressed
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:35.700]  and dominated and turned into mindless minions
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:39.300]  as the slaves of this tyranny themselves
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:43.300]  the pundits must learn to step and fetch
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:46.660]  and bow to her
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:51.780]  and you look at the hate in her eyes she knows fully what she's doing let's go
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:55.460]  back to a high-level globalist this is what's taught in your
[01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:57.940]  universities this is what's taught to the police that are
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:00.900]  graduating this is the new political officers
[01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:05.380]  they're coming they have no honor they want to dominate you they want to sow
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:08.900]  racism they want to sow dissension they want a totally
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:12.180]  color obsessed society the opposite of martin luther king
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:16.100]  she is the anti martin luther king in reality
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:20.740]  that's not rhetoric she is an abomination of hatred
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:25.220]  towards women let's go to her right now but let's be fair if there's somebody
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:29.220]  who is a hard worker when he goes to washington is po ryan
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:32.260]  not only works for the republicans but democrats you know it's what very well
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:34.900]  that i work on the immigration issue trying to get republicans to support
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:38.420]  immigration reform or ryan is somebody who stopped right there immigration
[01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:41.140]  back it up again let's just keep analyzing this is too important she's
[01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:44.260]  breathing heavy she's focusing she's going into a strategy
[01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:48.420]  cia psychiatrist training session and they admit the cia's involved thousands
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:52.580]  of operatives writing the news articles doing it she's probably with the agency
[01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:55.460]  okay and that's in the news they're engaged in quote controlling american
[01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:58.580]  people dividing us they have to declassify it all because it's so
[01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:02.500]  illegal that to make it public to inoculate you so you
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:06.820]  don't get upset when it comes out later she pushes back because you can't have
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:10.020]  them even thinking a white man could be good
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:13.140]  you can't have a hispanic and a white guy getting along
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:15.940]  you can't have them imagining that republicans
[01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:20.260]  actually want to work with people even though he's selling out to globalism
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:25.540]  then there might not be racial hatred we must identify him with slavery so she
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:28.980]  identifies him with slavery by bringing up hard work saying he
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:33.140]  doesn't deserve that he got what he got because of his ancestors
[01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:38.260]  surely they own slaves even though a tiny percent of people's ancestors had
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:42.820]  slaves in this country so again what she does is is a viciously
[01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:46.420]  formed harpoon to wail this guy and all the viewers
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:53.540]  and she does it with samurai focus this is guaranteed
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:56.660]  months and months of training just on stuff like this
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:59.700]  here it is but let's be fair if there's somebody
[01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:03.620]  who is a hard worker when he goes to washington is poll ryan
[01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:06.740]  not only works with republicans but democrats you know it's what very well
[01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:09.300]  that i work on the immigration issue trying to get republicans to support
[01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:12.260]  immigration reform poll ryan is somebody who has supported immigration
[01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:15.460]  reform has to work with somebody like louis gutierrez louis gutierrez is
[01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:19.620]  very respectful speaks highly of poll ryan this is somebody who's trying to
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:22.820]  govern i feel you but but i just want i just want to
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:25.780]  pause on one thing because i i don't disagree with you that i actually think
[01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:29.620]  mr ryan is a great choice for this role but i want us to be super careful when
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:33.540]  we use the language hard worker because i mean i actually keep
[01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:37.300]  um an image of you see every five seconds is key
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:41.140]  until i want us to be super careful when we talk
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:46.100]  super about what you say in a cult what will the cult leaders think i better
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:50.820]  get only get approved language just this is all meant to wreck society wreck
[01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:56.500]  debate wreck renaissance wreck universities
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:00.100]  this woman is a cancer let's go back go ahead
[01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:03.140]  because i mean i actually keep um an image
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:07.540]  of um folks working in cotton fields on my office wall
[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:11.220]  because it is a reminder about what hard work looks like so i feel you that he's
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:14.980]  a hard worker i do but in the context of relative
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:18.660]  privilege and i just want to point out that when you talk about work life
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:23.140]  balance and being a hard worker the moms who don't have health care who are
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:27.860]  working on i mean i understand that but we don't have hard workers we call them
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:31.460]  failures we call them people who are sucking off the system no no
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:36.980]  really y'all do that is really what you guys do that is very unfair i think we
[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:40.660]  cannot generalize about the republican party i agree not all republicans that is
[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:46.340]  certainly true well i tell you so this is how they operate
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:50.420]  you got a rhino neocon in there basically a democrat light
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:55.220]  and she's just there to demonize the entire political process
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:42:00.580]  and then complain about how there's gridlock going on
[01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:06.100]  truly a disgusting person we're going to get into the really big news on the
[01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:09.780]  china situation in detail then the economic news the speaker race the
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:13.700]  casual society control grid and more they have a special guest joining us
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:18.340]  in the third hour of open phones then and into the fourth hour
[01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:22.340]  with rob do hosting today
[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:28.340]  first off though i keep forgetting to take my nascent iodine survival shield
[01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:31.940]  x2 in the morning so i tend to end up taking it in the
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:35.380]  afternoon ours is very special it's a deep earth
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:38.580]  source all the other brands out there from the sea
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:42.740]  this is a truly a nascent iodine we've had a lot of others tested
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:46.100]  and looked at and it's just not as absorbable
[01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:49.460]  from what we've looked at all i know is we get the best results with this and
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:52.660]  this doesn't give me a stomach ache like other iodines i tried
[01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:56.580]  talk to a physician before you start taking iodine obviously
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:43:01.940]  info wars life dot com survival shield nascent iodine x2
[01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:09.300]  it's the good halogen bromine bromide fluoride hydrofluorosalic acid
[01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:13.220]  those are the bad halogens that your body if it doesn't have good halogen
[01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:16.660]  we'll start trying to use to produce the hormones
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:19.780]  basically you know read all the informational facts at info wars
[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:24.660]  life dot com and see the informational videos in the x2 section
[01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:27.780]  but that's what this does
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:36.020]  and it's been a life changer for me and my family
[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:39.300]  just research what nascent iodine has been connected to in the studies for
[01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:42.500]  yourself and talk to your healthcare practitioner
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:46.020]  but this comes from a source so pure that when you put it on a hot plate
[01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:50.980]  it turns into purple gas it turns bright electric blue on paper
[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:55.060]  because that's what color pure crystals are all the other stuff is red
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:58.820]  because it's bound that's what i've been told by the chemist
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:02.820]  so all i know is this stuff is extremely effective for me personally you've heard
[01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:06.340]  the rave reviews you can read the reviews at info wars life dot com
[01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:09.860]  i just take a couple drops a day
[01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:17.940]  then i add some super male vitality and i guess somebody took my secret
[01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:21.380]  12 methylcobalamin i know it's more effective under the tongue but i just
[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:25.780]  put a few squirts every day in water my kids drink it like soft drinks the
[01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:33.060]  vitamin b12 in water and just love it secret 12 is available at info wars

[01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:56.820]  normally 1995 because ancient defense is part of a line
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:45:00.580]  that's going to be even more affordable that we're working on of known herbs
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:04.820]  that we can get that are organic that aren't super expensive
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:08.260]  we've got some stuff that's expensive like dna force some stuff that's very
[01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:13.220]  moderately priced like uh something like oxy powder or
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:17.700]  liver shield but then we've got things like ancient defense that
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:20.740]  is just a well-known formula put out by one of the oldest biggest organic

[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:28.020]  and they sell it for 25 which is very affordable we get it private label it
[01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:31.620]  1995 right now it's 1695 so that's an example our
[01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:35.940]  colloidal silver is just the biggest brand name in the
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:40.260]  country very highly respected 30 parts per million very pure

[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:50.580]  and we sell it for 1995 again sometimes even less so it's just stuff like that
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:54.100]  that's what you get the highest quality we can find at the lowest price a lot of
[01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:56.980]  our products are not private label though they're original formulas

[01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:17.540]  if everybody listening to the show would just spread the word to friends and
[01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:20.900]  family it would be even more exponential how fast we're growing
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:23.940]  and i know it's dangerous to grow this fast i know it's dangerous in the face
[01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:28.180]  of the new world order to do this but we've got to do it it's my
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:31.540]  responsibility in this position to just tell it like it is and not be
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:35.940]  scared and go after these people that said it's a lot easier to do it if our
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:39.780]  war chest is fat and our war chest is not fat
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:43.140]  um we're able to continue to grow slowly
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:45.940]  but we've got to spend most our time nickeling and diming
[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:51.140]  and haggling with people uh to be able to fund ourselves

[01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:58.180]  you know employees and just all of it i mean spending a lot of time trying to
[01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:01.460]  raise money which is okay i'm not complaining
[01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:04.820]  but only a fraction of people buy products from us i mean it's something
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:08.260]  like two percent and we could get up to four percent or so it would it would
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:11.700]  really change everything and i do even less plugging already for the industry
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:14.660]  plug less than others but i'd plug once a day
[01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:19.940]  if the funds come in i'd plug once a week of the adequate funds came in

[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:44.820]  who gets the credit i'm just saying we broke that and then they said it wasn't
[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:47.860]  true for about a week and then of course they admitted
[01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:52.180]  the heating of the hospitals with babies because soylent green is made out of
[01:54:52.180 --> 01:54:54.500]  people i want to get to that i want to get to the china

[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:05.940]  info wars.com but look at this story i'll cover this
[01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:10.420]  more into the next hour beijing summons us ambassador over
[01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:13.700]  warship in south china sea and china doesn't usually make threats and they
[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:17.380]  said two days ago they said if you sail any ships into this um
[01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:20.180]  they said this a year ago but they threatened again when the us announced
[01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:24.260]  it would two days ago we will take action
[01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:28.980]  and then the united states to its credit i don't want to have a war with china
[01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:32.100]  the globalists are definitely double dealing here
[01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:35.460]  but that is international waters it does not belong to china where they're
[01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:38.900]  building fake islands and then claiming 12 miles on all sides of it
[01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:44.020]  i mean it's it's just not true beijing summons us ambassador over warship in
[01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:47.780]  south china sea chinese foreign ministry says washington
[01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:55.060]  acted illegally when uss lassen entered waters near disputed
[01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:59.380]  spratly archipelago and they've now summoned the ambassador
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:03.220]  and launched a direct military challenge to beijing's territorial claims in the
[01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:05.700]  south china sea with naval maneuvers near the two
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:09.140]  artificial islands well the chinese moved weapons in there and
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:13.460]  naval ships i mean those other countries are scared
[01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:16.580]  jap japan's freaking out the philippines is freaking out
[01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:20.100]  state television reported that chinese vice foreign minister
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:24.340]  has branded the move extremely irresponsible in meeting with us
[01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:28.260]  ambassador to china max bachos
[01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:31.860]  chinese authorities said earlier they had monitored and followed
[01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:35.940]  and warned us ships the uss lassen as it illegally entered waters near the
[01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:40.900]  disputed reefs and urged washington to immediately correct its mistake
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:44.340]  now why is the united states doing this
[01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:47.220]  well because it has a bunch of territorial deals with the other
[01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:51.620]  countries it took over the area of course in 45
[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:55.620]  it put the communist chinese in power and the chinese now
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:59.140]  we're told you can have any basis you want you can have any raw materials you
[01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:03.540]  want but don't be expansionist physically out of china
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:08.740]  into any of the south china sea areas and china broke its deal
[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:12.500]  four years ago with the anglo americans and started moving troops
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:17.060]  they've moved them into well all over the place they've moved troops into
[01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:20.340]  africa they've moved troops into latin america
[01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:24.500]  uh the globalist had a little globalist deal
[01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:27.300]  so you can have all the jobs you can have all the factors you can have the
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:30.420]  temporal power you can buy up the real estate will make movies the way you want
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:34.980]  to make you can censor our news you can sell body parts and we won't
[01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:38.660]  make you know a big deal out of it anymore just do not militarily moving
[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:41.140]  around japan or anywhere else where you've claimed before you have
[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:46.340]  territorial rights they said okay
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:49.220]  there's no honor amongst thieves the globalists are bad the chinese
[01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:52.020]  leadership's bad probably worse i mean i i can't believe i'm saying that but
[01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:56.260]  they are as bad as it gets let's just put it to you that way
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:58:00.740]  and they are now moving into that area and it is a big deal
[01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:05.300]  it is a big deal and china this year and last year
[01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:09.060]  not once not twice not three times but four times they admit
[01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:15.940]  has moved ships up close to the coast to by us military bases in alaska and in
[01:58:15.940 --> 01:58:18.740]  california and they launched that missile a few
[01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:22.100]  years ago remember five miles off the coast and said
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:25.060]  the media said it was like a thunderstorm or something

[02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:55.860]  funny and i saw our our crew you know made up of
[02:02:55.860 --> 02:02:59.620]  different races and colors or whatever laughing at that and because i could
[02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:01.940]  see a camera shot of them in the studio
[02:03:01.940 --> 02:03:07.060]  what's wrong with laughing he sounds like the south park voice
[02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:10.820]  uh of uh kim jong
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:16.020]  that's exactly what we were just saying yeah it's so it's funny and so we

[02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:23.460]  funny no that's it i mean it is funny isn't it niko
[02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:26.180]  it was pretty funny yeah i mean let's but it's not because we're against chinese
[02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:30.500]  people it's hilarious because he's like you're
[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:34.180]  gone now in fact i watched the politically
[02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:37.620]  correct one i do watch south park occasionally it's
[02:03:37.620 --> 02:03:41.380]  horrible it's it's degrading in many ways but it is funny
[02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:44.820]  and i was watching the one about where there's the crazy psychologist
[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:48.340]  who really has the multiple personalities and he keeps committing crimes and
[02:03:48.340 --> 02:03:51.780]  blaming one of the kids and they keep going along
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:54.900]  with it and then you've got a japanese and chinese
[02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:57.620]  restaurants fighting with each other turns up the chinese guys not even
[02:03:57.620 --> 02:04:00.260]  chinese it's doing all this politically correct stuff it's one of the
[02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:04.020]  other personalities and it's that same brother that
[02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:07.620]  does the voice of kim jong-un it's that voice and i'm telling you
[02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:12.340]  it's identical in fact it almost makes me think the pentagon did a spoof piece
[02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:14.980]  even though they admit china admits that's their real warnings it is a real
[02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:18.660]  video it is real audio from june but i'm telling you i
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:22.500]  guess those brothers went and actually listened that would be a
[02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:25.860]  north korean voice but i mean their their their their
[02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:33.220]  imitation of a north korean is is dead on to uh you'll go now
[02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:35.940]  i mean it is hilarious and i'm sure they'll probably have some
[02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:40.020]  national news story jones makes fun of chinese people
[02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:45.140]  absolutely of the funniness of them not knowing the language it's funny if i'm
[02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:47.940]  trying to speak chinese i guarantee you they're laughing about that
[02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:51.300]  it's like all these band cartoons that are banned here aren't banned in other
[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:54.180]  countries like in latin america speeding and solace is not banned down there
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:58.580]  they love it i mean it's funny we'll be right back
[02:04:58.580 --> 02:05:02.180]  china has said that it's not afraid to fight a war with the us
[02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:05.620]  after a warship incident a guided missile destroyer

[02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:13.140]  an act that some people are calling a deliberate provocation
[02:05:13.140 --> 02:05:16.100]  china responded by warning and following the vessel
[02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:19.460]  before china's foreign ministry characterized the maneuvers as a
[02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:23.300]  threat to china's sovereignty chinese state media outlet the global
[02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:26.820]  times said that beijing should now prepare for the worst
[02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:31.220]  and that beijing is not frightened to fight a war with the us in the region
[02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:34.420]  the editorial states beijing ought to carry out
[02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:38.500]  anti-harassment operations we should first track the us warships
[02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:42.340]  if they instead of passing by stop for further actions
[02:05:42.340 --> 02:05:45.700]  it is necessary for us to launch electronic interventions
[02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:50.980]  and even send out warships lock them by fire control radar and fly over the us

[02:10:02.580 --> 02:10:07.220]  generally don't have to do that in the i don't usually do it in 16 to 18 weeks
[02:10:07.220 --> 02:10:10.820]  because i don't really need to it was a further gestation
[02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:13.780]  i will sometimes do that if it's a supplement presentation just because
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:17.460]  it's easier to get right because yeah that's what that's what dub was

[02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:42.340]  wanting both hemispheres and so yeah um i haven't been able to do that yet
[02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:46.180]  oh to get the calvary that's like maybe next time
[02:10:51.700 --> 02:10:55.060]  because they're non-threatening and giggle it makes it okay see the new old

[02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:34.980]  the irs persecution the emails are weak because they're only isolated to her
[02:11:34.980 --> 02:11:38.420]  they always go out for him for something like that like clinton and sex
[02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:42.660]  and lying about it because he only is isolated to him and his cigars
[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:46.180]  it's not bigger
[02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:51.460]  in that it affects other agencies and bipartisan criminal activity but it's
[02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:56.580]  better than nothing so here's that clip of senator cornan of texas
[02:11:56.580 --> 02:11:59.860]  well i think uh it's it's important to have public hearings but
[02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:03.300]  to trai gowdy's point he's a professional former
[02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:07.860]  us attorney prosecutor and what he said was exactly right
[02:12:07.860 --> 02:12:11.380]  that hearing was more of a distraction i think
[02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:15.380]  in the pursuit of the facts because secretary clinton simply didn't answer
[02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:19.700]  a lot of the questions and her whole goal was to try to make this look
[02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:22.900]  political which it's not four americans lost their lives
[02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:27.620]  in Benghazi and she's obstructed the investigation along the way by having
[02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:31.220]  her private email server and by sticking to this false narrative that
[02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:34.980]  somehow this was incited by some video which has been proven to be
[02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:38.340]  false so it was not particularly helpful
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:42.500]  pursuit of the truth but i'll let people be their their own judge
[02:12:42.500 --> 02:12:45.700]  final question when will you know whether you get a special counsel
[02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:49.940]  is there a date certain on that or not well the interesting thing is bill i
[02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:53.380]  got a letter back from the department of justice they didn't say yes
[02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:56.580]  they didn't say no i think they're keeping their options open
[02:12:56.580 --> 02:13:01.460]  pending what the uh what the fbi comes up with yeah obviously the fbi is not
[02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:05.380]  going to be going after hillary now because biden dropped out
[02:13:05.380 --> 02:13:09.540]  or biden didn't enter he got off the diving board he didn't jump in
[02:13:09.540 --> 02:13:13.140]  he was out there on the high dive just kind of bouncing about like go go jump
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:16.820]  for about you know 10 minutes politically
[02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:21.300]  he finally climbed back down and ran back off the showers
[02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:24.660]  moving to the next uh video here then we're going to our guest
[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:28.740]  state department on clinton not having a computer in her office now get this as
[02:13:28.740 --> 02:13:31.700]  a quote emails are relatively new beast
[02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:36.820]  hillary's been on tape saying i used emails first back in the early 1990s as
[02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:41.700]  co-governor and i've been totally open about my emails going back to when i
[02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:46.100]  was first the first lady in 1993 remember her
[02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:50.020]  quotes on that we could probably find them but now email whoever heard of
[02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:54.580]  that it's like the fbi last year stingray
[02:13:54.580 --> 02:13:58.100]  what's the stingray there's no fake cell towers and people went and shut them
[02:13:58.100 --> 02:14:00.660]  to them they went on on the news in chicago they go
[02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:04.740]  that must be hackers turned out it was fbi tower
[02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:08.180]  well the fbi lied to us and he legally grabbed our data
[02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:13.620]  no and garter cells has been caught sterilizing people and causing infertility
[02:14:13.620 --> 02:14:19.300]  in many areas and caused deaths no
[02:14:21.860 --> 02:14:24.900]  so again emails whoever heard of that i mean
[02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:28.260]  she didn't have a computer in her office that's right i'm gonna say that again
[02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:32.900]  hillary clinton didn't have a computer at the secretary of state's office that's
[02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:36.500]  like saying and a southwest airlines jet
[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:41.620]  airplane didn't have windows or
[02:14:41.620 --> 02:14:46.900]  fish didn't have scales or orio cookies didn't have cream filling in the middle
[02:14:46.900 --> 02:14:50.580]  i don't even know how to respond
[02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:54.260]  to this insult of our intelligence that two plus two equals five that you didn't
[02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:59.300]  build your business that raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt that
[02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:05.220]  that these people just aren't sick and again they're in a war against reality
[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:07.620]  to break our will to get us to accept all this
[02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:12.660]  let's just say no here is this out of this world fantasy land clip
[02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:16.340]  i did not conduct most of the business that i did on behalf
[02:15:16.340 --> 02:15:22.580]  of our country on email i conducted it in meetings i read
[02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:26.340]  massive amounts of memos great deal of classified
[02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:31.140]  information i made a lot of secure phone calls i was in and out of the white
[02:15:31.140 --> 02:15:34.980]  house all the time there were a lot of things that happened
[02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:39.300]  that uh i was aware of and that i was reacting to
[02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:43.140]  if you were to be in my office in the state look at the optics back at up 10
[02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:45.700]  seconds it's nothing but democratic party
[02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:50.820]  operative black ladies behind her and the message is she's a woman of color
[02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:54.340]  she cares about black people she's fighting racism
[02:15:54.340 --> 02:15:58.660]  that's the optics even though she helped double black unemployment
[02:15:58.660 --> 02:16:03.140]  and as a eugenicist plant parenthood lover and i guarantee as racist as the day
[02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:06.420]  is long
[02:16:06.420 --> 02:16:09.940]  but it doesn't matter because there's the optics of women behind her laughing
[02:16:09.940 --> 02:16:12.820]  acting real real smug when she talks oh yeah
[02:16:12.820 --> 02:16:17.220]  hillary's got it down here let's go back to the rest of this disgusting clip
[02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:20.980]  house all the time there were a lot of things that happened
[02:16:20.980 --> 02:16:25.380]  that uh i was aware of and that i was reacting to
[02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:28.500]  if you were to be in my office in the state department i didn't have a
[02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:32.500]  computer i did not do the vast majority of my work on email
[02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:35.860]  secretary clinton speaks of not having a computer at the state department
[02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:40.180]  is that an unusual thing for the secretary to not have a state to not
[02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:43.380]  have a computer within their office of the state department
[02:16:43.380 --> 02:16:49.380]  um it's i mean unusual i mean look i mean we've only had um you know
[02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:52.980]  emails a relatively new uh beast shall we say and uh
[02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:58.100]  or new creation uh and so you know uh i think the secretary is a little bit
[02:16:58.100 --> 02:17:01.220]  different and how they get information certainly that evolves
[02:17:01.220 --> 02:17:05.700]  as technology is developed over time so i'm not it's hard for me to say whether
[02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:09.780]  it's unusual um that's enough there's next they'll be saying
[02:17:09.780 --> 02:17:12.980]  is it true she flushed the drugs on the toilet well toilets are relatively new
[02:17:12.980 --> 02:17:15.460]  development and there are no toilets in the state
[02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:19.300]  department in fact we're not quite sure what they are
[02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:25.140]  but al gore invented the internet i guess in 93 so i guess in a way even
[02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:29.700]  that was invented back in the 60s by darpa and some british scientists but
[02:17:29.700 --> 02:17:34.500]  hey why not take credit did you know that i actually invented
[02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:37.780]  the bible i wrote ezekiel and uh i wrote uh
[02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:43.140]  romans the new testament and i wrote the story of noah in um
[02:17:43.140 --> 02:17:47.060]  genesis can remember the name of the book i wrote i just what it's not credible
[02:17:47.060 --> 02:17:50.100]  you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't believe i wrote genesis
[02:17:50.100 --> 02:17:56.740]  3000 years ago okay i wrote it i wrote psalms i did it all i said it
[02:17:56.740 --> 02:18:01.060]  questioning music conspiracy theory shut your mouths
[02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:06.660]  two plus two equals whatever i say haha don't be racist
[02:18:06.660 --> 02:18:12.500]  total con game by the way we're going to go to break come back with our guest

[02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:33.140]  and we've got doctors and whistleblowers and others going public
[02:26:33.140 --> 02:26:36.260]  and there's other stuff contributing to autism as well pesticides you name it

[02:26:50.660 --> 02:26:53.620]  segments coming up but it's great when you've come down and visited us and
[02:26:53.620 --> 02:26:55.940]  worked with us on compliance and other things
[02:26:55.940 --> 02:26:59.300]  dealing with our nutraceuticals and info wars life dot com but
[02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:05.140]  this is separately on the vaccines today uh just how bad is it mr fucitola
[02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:09.140]  well first of all thanks for having me on pleasure seeing you again
[02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:12.820]  it was an interesting visit a couple of weeks ago i met your
[02:27:12.820 --> 02:27:16.740]  your great staff saw your amazing facilities
[02:27:16.740 --> 02:27:21.780]  of very good well we appreciate you coming down and spending time with us
[02:27:21.780 --> 02:27:24.580]  my friend what we're here for let's say what you're here for
[02:27:24.580 --> 02:27:28.100]  we're here because there is really a plot you will
[02:27:28.100 --> 02:27:32.740]  a plan to take away our conscientious objector rights
[02:27:32.740 --> 02:27:36.340]  to vaccination whether religious or philosophical rights
[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:39.220]  and it's being done around the country it's being led by
[02:27:39.220 --> 02:27:43.220]  nacho the national association of county and city
[02:27:43.220 --> 02:27:47.700]  health officials an organization he gets all of its money
[02:27:47.700 --> 02:27:52.340]  from the federal government and it lobbies to take away our rights
[02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:55.300]  that's one thing one very important factor here
[02:27:55.300 --> 02:27:59.300]  the other is that you know i appreciate the plug for the vitamin
[02:27:59.300 --> 02:28:03.780]  consultancy but my passion is natural solutions foundation
[02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:07.780]  and working on health freedom issues and we found
[02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:10.900]  when i say we i mean uh general berks double bind and
[02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:14.580]  dr rima labell myself the three trustees of natural solutions
[02:28:14.580 --> 02:28:18.580]  we found a solution to the issue uh you know and
[02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:23.060]  the solution is summed up in um a quote from general bert
[02:28:23.060 --> 02:28:28.900]  and he says informed consent is the defining issue of the 21st century
[02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:31.620]  about vaccines and i got a lot of other things as well
[02:28:31.620 --> 02:28:36.740]  and so what we've looked at is uh can the legislature of california
[02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:40.900]  can it simply change the law and take away our rights
[02:28:40.900 --> 02:28:44.180]  can governor jerry brown's shirt of that state
[02:28:44.180 --> 02:28:49.140]  just sign a law and get rid of our our basic human rights and the answer is no
[02:28:49.140 --> 02:28:53.380]  there is a fundamental human right called informed consent
[02:28:53.380 --> 02:28:57.060]  and that's what i want to talk about when we come back after the break
[02:28:57.060 --> 02:29:00.820]  and of course as a lawyer who's you fought this in court you're an expert
[02:29:00.820 --> 02:29:03.700]  on it from folks that don't understand they've lied and said it's the law
[02:29:03.700 --> 02:29:06.500]  forever now that we know it's not the law they've been caught
[02:29:06.500 --> 02:29:10.500]  now they're trying to pass laws but those themselves are fraud correct
[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:13.780]  exactly they violate international humanitarian law
[02:29:13.780 --> 02:29:18.420]  and treaties that bind the united states and its member states
[02:29:18.420 --> 02:29:22.980]  amazing we got about 30 seconds to break uh what website should we visit to
[02:29:22.980 --> 02:29:25.940]  learn more specifically about what you just broke down
[02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:32.980]  dr lima truth reports dot com that's dr i am a truth reports dot com
[02:29:32.980 --> 02:29:36.740]  you'll find it there we need we need to get general stubblebine and dr lebo

[02:29:40.340 --> 02:29:43.460]  forces and the former head of army intelligence
[02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:47.780]  and he says the mass culling has begun in the third world

[02:30:24.420 --> 02:30:27.620]  do this favor for me then they hop up and do it he's saying that the political
[02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:31.060]  system is broken and i could not agree more with that we're doing this more as
[02:30:31.060 --> 02:30:34.020]  a way to educate the general public about the left

[02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:15.060]  is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show i want to fly
[02:33:15.060 --> 02:33:19.540]  back to the future because you know the renaissance started about 500 years ago
[02:33:19.540 --> 02:33:23.300]  1776 was seen worldwide by the entire renaissance
[02:33:23.300 --> 02:33:27.460]  from japan to france the historian said this is really a great thing
[02:33:27.460 --> 02:33:31.940]  we should be like this the french tried it there was a total disaster called the
[02:33:31.940 --> 02:33:36.660]  french revolution then brought in napoleon after that the dictator
[02:33:36.660 --> 02:33:39.860]  but time does keep slipping slipping slipping into the future
[02:33:39.860 --> 02:33:42.820]  they keep saying get rid of the constitution bell rights it's old
[02:33:42.820 --> 02:33:46.500]  declaration of independence it's old and then they go back to classical tyranny
[02:33:46.500 --> 02:33:49.700]  that's thousands of years old
[02:33:50.260 --> 02:33:53.940]  but even in ancient times forced medical activities
[02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:59.300]  were rarely engaged in and again 500 years ago in the
[02:33:59.300 --> 02:34:05.380]  renaissance they began poking people that had smallpox
[02:34:05.380 --> 02:34:11.060]  with a toothpick a sharp stick and then they would come to you if you chose
[02:34:11.060 --> 02:34:13.860]  they said there was a rest sometimes it'd kill you but
[02:34:13.860 --> 02:34:17.300]  couple percentage points some and sometimes smallpox would kill 30 of
[02:34:17.300 --> 02:34:21.700]  people in the deep of winter in europe but they knew if you were healthy and
[02:34:21.700 --> 02:34:25.380]  got a small dose of it if you got it when you were already worn down and
[02:34:25.380 --> 02:34:29.460]  sick it'd kill you but if you got it when you were healthy
[02:34:30.420 --> 02:34:33.620]  then you had a lot better chance of living so people would do it
[02:34:33.620 --> 02:34:36.820]  but they even knew then in ancient manuscripts about how to
[02:34:36.820 --> 02:34:40.180]  how to inoculate somebody that tell them there's a danger tell them there's a
[02:34:40.180 --> 02:34:44.020]  chance it's going to kill them now they get up and say safe and
[02:34:44.020 --> 02:34:46.580]  effective but you get the actual inserts we're going to be showing you some
[02:34:46.580 --> 02:34:49.540]  mmr and some flu shot inserts for your tv viewer
[02:34:49.540 --> 02:34:52.500]  info wars.com forward slash show where it says it can kill you
[02:34:52.500 --> 02:34:56.500]  it can give you type two diabetes could shut your pancreas off
[02:34:56.500 --> 02:35:00.500]  it can cause narcolepsy it can cause guion beret i mean
[02:35:00.500 --> 02:35:03.540]  there's got to be a hundred things on this it can do to you and then they just
[02:35:03.540 --> 02:35:07.060]  go up on the news and say alex jose is a conspiracy theorist
[02:35:07.060 --> 02:35:11.380]  he's crazy he's lying it never hurts you but anybody who has family
[02:35:11.380 --> 02:35:16.580]  knows inoculation horror stories almost everyone i knows had some horror
[02:35:16.580 --> 02:35:19.700]  story but me because i've never really had
[02:35:19.700 --> 02:35:22.100]  vaccines
[02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:24.820]  when i was like four years old my uncle took a tetanus shot and almost killed him
[02:35:24.820 --> 02:35:27.460]  it was in the hospital for two weeks my dad said you know what we're just not
[02:35:27.460 --> 02:35:30.420]  going to inoculate you
[02:35:32.260 --> 02:35:36.820]  then one time i got cut up really bad a bunch of old metal and my dad said
[02:35:36.820 --> 02:35:39.780]  he went to the hospital he talked to me got the most expensive brand he
[02:35:39.780 --> 02:35:43.700]  checked it out he gave me a tetanus shot and i was about 10
[02:35:43.700 --> 02:35:46.740]  and he said this may make you really sick but i think you might get tetanus from
[02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:51.140]  all you know that barn you fell in on and had cuts on me he goes
[02:35:51.140 --> 02:35:54.660]  tetanus is associated with horses there were horses in that barn we need to get
[02:35:54.660 --> 02:35:58.420]  you in right now and get you shot but he knew there was a danger
[02:35:58.420 --> 02:36:00.740]  i'm going to go back to our guest here in a moment i want to get him back for a
[02:36:00.740 --> 02:36:04.500]  full hour on the nightly news very very soon i'm going to be wall
[02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:09.060]  he's talking of your tv viewer showing people news articles and documents but
[02:36:09.060 --> 02:36:12.980]  informed consent rick perry as governor nine years ago
[02:36:12.980 --> 02:36:16.260]  said it's the law in texas take garter cell even though a bunch of girls had
[02:36:16.260 --> 02:36:20.340]  died in the trials we went on air and said it's a hoax
[02:36:20.340 --> 02:36:24.100]  there is no law he told the health department it's on the list of recommended
[02:36:24.100 --> 02:36:28.100]  then they lie in the schools and say it's the law you can pull the articles up
[02:36:28.100 --> 02:36:32.660]  texas law says garter cell is compulsory
[02:36:32.660 --> 02:36:36.980]  and every year they lie in august and say it's the law you got to take these
[02:36:36.980 --> 02:36:39.380]  shots
[02:36:39.380 --> 02:36:45.380]  now what happens is when they say it's compulsory really they're saying it's a
[02:36:45.380 --> 02:36:49.940]  list of recommended vaccine liability protection kicks in
[02:36:49.940 --> 02:36:53.060]  and then a drug they know is hurting people
[02:36:53.060 --> 02:36:56.340]  now gets government coverage it goes to a special court now i'm going to shut up
[02:36:56.340 --> 02:37:00.580]  and give our guests the floor and i appreciate Ralph Fusatola joining us
[02:37:00.580 --> 02:37:04.420]  one of the top vitamin lawyers in the country to go over this because this is
[02:37:04.420 --> 02:37:09.540]  real passion uh exposing this
[02:37:09.540 --> 02:37:12.580]  he works for some of the biggest supplement companies in the world
[02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:16.340]  and but again his passion is exposing this informed consent
[02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:21.780]  they can pass a law tomorrow saying to go to school you've got to have this
[02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:24.180]  but then that's something they know is going to be fought out in the courts
[02:37:24.180 --> 02:37:27.700]  please continue breaking this down and the good news that we have legal
[02:37:27.700 --> 02:37:31.620]  standing to say no and how people should say no at very state of
[02:37:31.620 --> 02:37:35.780]  state as you know sir but in general as a lawyer what advice you give people
[02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:39.460]  okay well you got to start from the beginning which is that i have a basic
[02:37:39.460 --> 02:37:42.500]  human right to decide what goes into my body
[02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:47.220]  uh the supreme court said that in 2013 they said we have never retreated
[02:37:47.220 --> 02:37:50.580]  from our position now you have a privacy interest
[02:37:50.580 --> 02:37:54.500]  whenever the government or an agent of the government ceases to pierce
[02:37:54.500 --> 02:37:58.340]  the skin it's called it's the case of Missouri versus McNeely
[02:37:58.340 --> 02:38:03.060]  so it's a very up-to-date law i have a right to say no
[02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:06.660]  and that right is a right that's existed for thousands of years
[02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:09.940]  from the very beginning of medicine Hippocratic oath
[02:38:09.940 --> 02:38:14.500]  doctors used to swear that they would not they would not engage in any medical
[02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:18.020]  intervention without the consent of the individual
[02:38:18.020 --> 02:38:22.260]  hey look wars have consequences and one of the consequences of world war two
[02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:25.620]  was something called the uh Nuremberg trials and after the
[02:38:25.620 --> 02:38:28.900]  major nazi war criminals were taken care of in the
[02:38:28.900 --> 02:38:32.340]  main international trial there were a series of what are called the
[02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:36.100]  subsequent Nuremberg trials and one of those and there was a run by the u.s
[02:38:36.100 --> 02:38:39.460]  government directly by the way was not the international tribunal
[02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:43.060]  and one of those trials was the famous Nazi doctors trial
[02:38:43.060 --> 02:38:47.220]  and for that trial a group of american scholars put together something called
[02:38:47.220 --> 02:38:52.820]  the Nuremberg code which was an um a compilation of what the law of informed
[02:38:52.820 --> 02:38:57.060]  consent had always been understood to be that Nuremberg code was then used to
[02:38:57.060 --> 02:38:59.860]  try the nazi doctors some of whom were hung
[02:38:59.860 --> 02:39:03.860]  provide for committing atrocities that included of course
[02:39:03.860 --> 02:39:07.140]  at every step of the way violating informed consent
[02:39:07.140 --> 02:39:14.260]  and uh and that Nuremberg code because it was used to try
[02:39:14.260 --> 02:39:18.180]  and again we've had his Skype cut out a moment there we're showing some
[02:39:18.180 --> 02:39:24.420]  footage of the Nuremberg trials shot by the u.s army showing some
[02:39:24.420 --> 02:39:28.740]  color footage of what Nuremberg looked like at the end of the war
[02:39:28.740 --> 02:39:32.580]  but you see the nazis in there wearing their black sunglasses and
[02:39:32.580 --> 02:39:36.660]  being sentenced to death as a hermit gearing
[02:39:36.660 --> 02:39:40.260]  already lost a lot of weight we had about 400 pounds when they captured him
[02:39:40.260 --> 02:39:45.220]  well the time he was supposed to commit suicide sighed i he weighed about 150
[02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:48.820]  pounds there he is uh right there uh that didn't uh
[02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:52.660]  that didn't turn out turn out too well for
[02:39:52.660 --> 02:39:56.500]  for those boys but you talk about i'm only following orders
[02:39:56.500 --> 02:40:00.340]  or the so-called nazi code you look at selling body parts of babies you look
[02:40:00.340 --> 02:40:04.580]  at forced inoculations this is stuff the nazis did forced
[02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:10.020]  abortions stuff like that and then you realize our government
[02:40:10.020 --> 02:40:13.620]  actually sold them the holler earth machines from IBM
[02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:16.740]  our government basically told the nazis they were going to support them
[02:40:16.740 --> 02:40:20.740]  and set them up i'm not defending the nazis either uh it's just really really
[02:40:20.740 --> 02:40:24.020]  sick we're trying to get Ralph Fusatola back on
[02:40:24.020 --> 02:40:28.340]  you know let's just go telephone with him if we have to guys uh because
[02:40:28.340 --> 02:40:30.900]  this is absolutely because this is important stuff and i want to have him
[02:40:30.900 --> 02:40:34.580]  back up to finish this interview uh because people
[02:40:34.580 --> 02:40:37.940]  need to know their rights and he's explaining this is Nuremberg
[02:40:37.940 --> 02:40:41.620]  this is the federal government in major
[02:40:41.620 --> 02:40:46.660]  high-level court rulings saying everything they're doing now is illegal
[02:40:46.660 --> 02:40:50.180]  and the supreme court just a few years ago ruled the same way
[02:40:50.180 --> 02:40:55.940]  he's telling you as a lawyer so it is a giant bluff it's a giant hoax
[02:40:55.940 --> 02:40:59.460]  but it has more teeth in it i mean Perry coming out saying it's the law to take
[02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:05.140]  Gardasil was like somebody with no teeth trying to chew through leather
[02:41:05.140 --> 02:41:10.500]  this has some teeth uh in that it is a law
[02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:14.500]  but it's completely unconstitutional the problem is
[02:41:14.500 --> 02:41:18.900]  clearly justice Roberts and others
[02:41:19.780 --> 02:41:24.260]  had made statements like you can't have a tax
[02:41:25.060 --> 02:41:28.820]  that is obama care you know that doesn't originate out of the house but
[02:41:28.820 --> 02:41:32.500]  it didn't and they didn't sell it as a tax and
[02:41:32.500 --> 02:41:37.460]  it's not equally apportioned and it's a tax levy to private interest
[02:41:37.460 --> 02:41:40.980]  and now that the penalties are kicking in that's why they're trying to hold the penalties off
[02:41:40.980 --> 02:41:48.820]  that makes people plaintiffs where they have quote standing to be involved and
[02:41:48.820 --> 02:41:53.140]  600 a thousand two thousand dollars a year three thousand dollars a year
[02:41:53.140 --> 02:41:56.260]  as they ratchet up the fines for not getting your obama care and let me tell
[02:41:56.260 --> 02:42:00.260]  you i've tried to change insurance and stuff now
[02:42:00.260 --> 02:42:05.540]  used to i could change health insurance with a couple phone calls
[02:42:05.540 --> 02:42:08.980]  maybe a medical exam go to a clinic have blood taken
[02:42:08.980 --> 02:42:12.820]  i got insurance once i had to do that i changed it health insurance once
[02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:15.460]  and they wanted me to get an exam in an office and i went and did it and they
[02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:17.940]  took blood and i got a super cheap rate because i was
[02:42:17.940 --> 02:42:20.980]  so healthy the point is
[02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:25.460]  it's like oh wait till september and then you can exchange in the open market
[02:42:25.460 --> 02:42:29.060]  and then that never happened i mean it's so
[02:42:29.060 --> 02:42:32.740]  screwed up and the prices have gone up and up and up my prices went up because
[02:42:32.740 --> 02:42:37.140]  of obama care
[02:42:37.140 --> 02:42:41.460]  so i set out to try to find out
[02:42:41.460 --> 02:42:44.820]  okay let me go out in this quote quote market and get a better deal
[02:42:44.820 --> 02:42:48.180]  it's just totally screwed up it's a total train wreck
[02:42:48.180 --> 02:42:51.620]  Ralph Fusatola we're gonna have you back up and we get better internet someday but
[02:42:51.620 --> 02:42:54.580]  we've got eight minutes till break please continue we're going back to the
[02:42:54.580 --> 02:42:59.700]  Nuremberg hearings of the Nuremberg trials of the Nazis
[02:42:59.700 --> 02:43:03.940]  right please continue well there's very specific language that was developed in
[02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:07.780]  that code and that language is carried over to a federal statute to an
[02:43:07.780 --> 02:43:11.380]  international convention and it's the same language and it basically says
[02:43:11.380 --> 02:43:15.780]  you cannot be coerced into giving up your informed consent rights
[02:43:15.780 --> 02:43:19.380]  that means for example you can't be told in california
[02:43:19.380 --> 02:43:22.340]  you cannot you you will either get the shot
[02:43:22.340 --> 02:43:26.980]  or go to school now state of california says that they're going to exclude
[02:43:26.980 --> 02:43:30.500]  any student from school who's not vaccinated first of all
[02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:34.180]  no court has ever approved that in the past they've only approved
[02:43:34.180 --> 02:43:38.660]  temporary exclusions during real epidemics so i don't believe their law
[02:43:38.660 --> 02:43:42.900]  will ever get approved but let's assume they can do that if they can
[02:43:42.900 --> 02:43:46.500]  that violates what's called unconstitutional condition
[02:43:46.500 --> 02:43:51.060]  you cannot be forced to give up a right to get a benefit
[02:43:51.060 --> 02:43:53.780]  in fact california has a constitutional provision that says
[02:43:53.780 --> 02:43:57.860]  you must have a free public education so if they say you can't go to public
[02:43:57.860 --> 02:43:59.940]  school because you don't have a vaccine
[02:43:59.940 --> 02:44:03.540]  they have to give you the alternative they have to pay for the homeschooling
[02:44:03.540 --> 02:44:06.820]  they have to pay for the tutor they have to pay to let you go to a
[02:44:06.820 --> 02:44:11.220]  vaccine free academy uh or else they're violating
[02:44:11.220 --> 02:44:15.060]  that child's right to a free public education
[02:44:15.060 --> 02:44:18.420]  very straightforward you can't have it both ways government
[02:44:18.420 --> 02:44:22.020]  you can't you know if you want to exclude unvaccinated then you have to
[02:44:22.020 --> 02:44:25.540]  make provisions for them because they have a right to an education too
[02:44:25.540 --> 02:44:28.660]  under your own law you know as libertarian i
[02:44:28.660 --> 02:44:32.980]  may not uh and may not approve of public schools but if you're going to have
[02:44:32.980 --> 02:44:37.140]  government schools and then say it's a right you better very well treat all
[02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:41.380]  the children equally and take those who have made the
[02:44:41.380 --> 02:44:45.140]  choice not to be vaccinated which is an informed consent decision
[02:44:45.140 --> 02:44:49.220]  no government on this planet has a right to override then you have to
[02:44:49.220 --> 02:44:52.500]  take care of their benefits as well you can't make it one or the other
[02:44:52.500 --> 02:44:55.860]  so what we've done alexis we've created the advanced
[02:44:55.860 --> 02:45:00.100]  vaccine directive card and uh it's a little
[02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:03.620]  wallet card just like it you know and i am a diabetic card
[02:45:03.620 --> 02:45:06.900]  or just like uh some some fundamentals christians carry a
[02:45:06.900 --> 02:45:12.100]  i do not accept blood transfusions card the advanced vaccine directive is a
[02:45:12.100 --> 02:45:16.420]  an advanced health care directive like a like a living will and it says
[02:45:16.420 --> 02:45:20.980]  i refuse all vaccines i do not waive my informed consent right
[02:45:20.980 --> 02:45:25.220]  because supreme court said if you don't assert your informed consent right
[02:45:25.220 --> 02:45:28.580]  you've waived it therefore you must assert it
[02:45:28.580 --> 02:45:33.060]  and um normal procedure if you are brought into an emergency room unconscious
[02:45:33.060 --> 02:45:36.740]  is to look at your wallet or your purse to see if you have any of those medical
[02:45:36.740 --> 02:45:39.540]  cards in there and this card needs to be there
[02:45:39.540 --> 02:45:43.700]  people can get the card at dr rima truth reports
[02:45:43.700 --> 02:45:47.300]  dot com and you'll see it's you know there's a link right there
[02:45:47.300 --> 02:45:52.260]  but we'd love them to uh to tell us that they came from your show
[02:45:52.260 --> 02:45:56.260]  and so if they'll put in the um they go there and they put into the um a little
[02:45:56.260 --> 02:46:01.300]  special code block um a j your initials then we'll know it came from alex
[02:46:01.300 --> 02:46:04.340]  jones we can you know help support what you're doing as well
[02:46:04.340 --> 02:46:08.340]  because it's really important that as many of these cards get into as many
[02:46:08.340 --> 02:46:12.500]  people's hands as possible the more people who have the card
[02:46:12.500 --> 02:46:16.100]  the more people the more power card will have
[02:46:16.100 --> 02:46:19.940]  we need to assert our rights absolutely and people can also research the law
[02:46:19.940 --> 02:46:23.460]  for themselves and this history make their own cards
[02:46:23.460 --> 02:46:27.940]  people can also create their own organizations to resist this i mean
[02:46:27.940 --> 02:46:31.300]  it's in law it's in our federal law state laws international
[02:46:31.300 --> 02:46:36.180]  lodge and eba convention as you know and then now they call this stuff vaccines
[02:46:36.180 --> 02:46:40.260]  more and more it's it's re-engineering our bodies
[02:46:40.260 --> 02:46:43.860]  uh with live viruses they have behavioral vaccines that are quote
[02:46:43.860 --> 02:46:48.100]  anti-stress that change the brain chemistry uh permanently it's basically
[02:46:48.100 --> 02:46:52.660]  a targeted lobotomy this is getting so high tech as well
[02:46:52.660 --> 02:46:55.940]  you know the person who can really address those issues is of course dr
[02:46:55.940 --> 02:46:59.780]  demolabo uh she's done some important work in that area
[02:46:59.780 --> 02:47:03.300]  i hope you and and have her in general bird on soon
[02:47:03.300 --> 02:47:08.500]  bird sees it so clearly folks it's it's part of an overall depopulation
[02:47:08.500 --> 02:47:12.660]  agenda control agenda they want less people
[02:47:12.660 --> 02:47:18.980]  dumber people more docile people and and all of the vaccines are aimed at
[02:47:18.980 --> 02:47:21.300]  creating that condition and by the way the white house
[02:47:21.300 --> 02:47:25.060]  science are wrote a book in 74 the year i was born admitting it all
[02:47:25.060 --> 02:47:28.820]  and the iq is physically dropping this isn't just an educational
[02:47:28.820 --> 02:47:33.300]  uh nurture it's nature we are being targeted we are in trouble
[02:47:33.300 --> 02:47:36.740]  and they can sit there with a straight face and say there are no
[02:47:36.740 --> 02:47:42.660]  there are no side effects of vaccines i'm going to show tv viewers right now
[02:47:42.660 --> 02:47:51.460]  where it says what it can do including pancreatis type 2 diabetes
[02:47:51.460 --> 02:47:55.460]  well earlier earlier alex you alluded to the whistleblower
[02:47:55.460 --> 02:47:58.260]  uh and the congressional hearings that are going to be done here's a dr
[02:47:58.260 --> 02:48:02.100]  thompson i believe who's a cdc whistleblower who
[02:48:02.100 --> 02:48:07.940]  showed that cdc attempted to destroy the records that show that the mmr
[02:48:07.940 --> 02:48:13.380]  vaccine targets young boys uh with with autism and the
[02:48:13.380 --> 02:48:17.380]  targets black boys at a much higher rate
[02:48:17.380 --> 02:48:20.660]  when you compare the rate of autism among unvaccinated
[02:48:20.660 --> 02:48:24.420]  uh versus the kids who had the mnr it's
[02:48:24.420 --> 02:48:28.420]  500 it's 200 higher for all children and 500
[02:48:28.420 --> 02:48:32.100]  percent higher for black children you're talking about boys yes it's 200 for
[02:48:32.100 --> 02:48:35.780]  boys blacks 500 the same thing with fluoride
[02:48:35.780 --> 02:48:39.060]  is two three to four times being on the study worse for blacks
[02:48:39.060 --> 02:48:42.500]  undoubtedly whether it's hiv or whether it's fluoride
[02:48:42.500 --> 02:48:46.260]  it burns whites and hispanics and asians but it really
[02:48:46.260 --> 02:48:49.620]  targets blacks but i don't think we'll hear melissa harris perry tell us about
[02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:55.060]  that on msnbc i doubt it but folks you know
[02:48:55.060 --> 02:48:58.820]  listening to people like alex and doing and doing your homework
[02:48:58.820 --> 02:49:02.500]  and then asserting your rights you must assert your rights
[02:49:02.500 --> 02:49:05.220]  and that's what we really that's the lesson that's the message i want to get
[02:49:05.220 --> 02:49:08.660]  to everybody uh unless you assert it you lose it
[02:49:08.660 --> 02:49:12.820]  uh and uh and you know americans are good at asserting their right
[02:49:12.820 --> 02:49:16.420]  tell you that once americans realize they're under attack we want to be nice
[02:49:16.420 --> 02:49:19.940]  we want to get along but once we realize we're being screwed over look out the
[02:49:19.940 --> 02:49:22.580]  sleeping giant we're going to play this clip when we come back
[02:49:22.580 --> 02:49:26.340]  in uh investigate cdc fraud congressman calls for hearings
[02:49:26.340 --> 02:49:30.340]  on vaccine autism cover up florida rep urges congress to address claim that
[02:49:30.340 --> 02:49:34.500]  m mr vaccine at an early age leads to higher incidences of autism
[02:49:34.500 --> 02:49:38.340]  adan salazar wrote this article the good news is more and more people are
[02:49:38.340 --> 02:49:41.860]  speaking out exactly we're going to break about
[02:49:41.860 --> 02:49:44.820]  a minute and a half but uh why do you think they're
[02:49:44.820 --> 02:49:49.060]  increasing their vaccine propaganda trying to pass laws saying it's the law
[02:49:49.060 --> 02:49:54.260]  is that in desperation it is you know the um as general bird has said the great
[02:49:54.260 --> 02:49:57.860]  culling has begun you gotta people need to go to dr reama
[02:49:57.860 --> 02:50:02.100]  truth reports dot com and get that that ebook from general bird
[02:50:02.100 --> 02:50:05.220]  um i believe that we'll all be seeing over the next
[02:50:05.220 --> 02:50:08.980]  few years we will begin to see the human population
[02:50:08.980 --> 02:50:13.300]  actually declining as as all of the factors
[02:50:13.300 --> 02:50:16.660]  whether it's the gmo's or the vaccines or
[02:50:16.660 --> 02:50:20.260]  uh the other factors begin to to coalesce
[02:50:20.260 --> 02:50:24.500]  and infertility and early demise and inability
[02:50:24.500 --> 02:50:27.940]  to uh carry determine all those things begin to
[02:50:27.940 --> 02:50:31.380]  really take their toll and then of course then of course
[02:50:31.380 --> 02:50:34.900]  the great cry will be uh you know for the government to somehow save us
[02:50:34.900 --> 02:50:39.060]  from what the government has created uh and i agree
[02:50:39.060 --> 02:50:42.100]  ralph was the toll is our guest we're gonna come back with that clip of
[02:50:42.100 --> 02:50:46.580]  congressman posi breaking all of this down straight ahead but bottom line
[02:50:46.580 --> 02:50:50.340]  do your own research folks research what's in the vaccines they want to make
[02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:53.860]  hundreds of shots mandatory these are firing squads
[02:50:53.860 --> 02:50:57.380]  for heaven's sakes stay with us
[02:50:58.660 --> 02:51:03.380]  my name is bill bonner and i'm the president of the largest private news
[02:51:03.380 --> 02:51:07.300]  and research network in the world and i paid for this airtime
[02:51:07.300 --> 02:51:10.900]  because i have an important message to the american people
[02:51:10.900 --> 02:51:15.460]  there's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about
[02:51:15.460 --> 02:51:19.700]  this change has deep implications for life in america
[02:51:19.700 --> 02:51:24.580]  from where you shop to the doctors you visit and the family you want to protect
[02:51:24.580 --> 02:51:27.700]  look i've made predictions like this before
[02:51:27.700 --> 02:51:31.700]  thing is i was right then too a few years ago
[02:51:31.700 --> 02:51:35.060]  i warned that housing prices would collapse
[02:51:35.060 --> 02:51:41.220]  they did before that i warned that dot com companies would crash
[02:51:41.220 --> 02:51:46.180]  they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves
[02:51:46.180 --> 02:51:48.580]  but this has nothing to do with the stock market

[02:55:09.940 --> 02:55:13.940]  that examined the possibility of a relationship between mumps measles
[02:55:13.940 --> 02:55:18.420]  rubella vaccines and autism in a statement
[02:55:18.420 --> 02:55:23.460]  released in august 2014 dr thompson stated i regret
[02:55:23.460 --> 02:55:28.260]  that my co-authors and i omitted omitted statistically significant
[02:55:28.260 --> 02:55:31.540]  information in our 2004 article published in the

[03:10:43.060 --> 03:10:48.980]  you gotta tell them and that is very much an art imitates life piece that we
[03:10:48.980 --> 03:10:52.820]  put together about a year ago and it was in response to a report out of the
[03:10:52.820 --> 03:11:00.380]  the UK, where they were burning little baby bodies as fuel to heat UK hospitals.
[03:11:00.380 --> 03:11:04.420]  Now we have here in the United States, we got the article video, abortionist says it
[03:11:04.420 --> 03:11:09.460]  would be a great idea to burn unborn babies as fuel.
[03:11:09.460 --> 03:11:12.500]  And we go a little bit inside, this is from Steve Watson.
[03:11:12.500 --> 03:11:17.700]  The video shows Renee Chilean, owner of the Northern Family Planning Chain of Abortion
[03:11:17.700 --> 03:11:21.660]  Clinics, discussing how she had so many leftover aborted fetuses, she doesn't know what to
[03:11:21.660 --> 03:11:22.660]  do with them.
[03:11:22.660 --> 03:11:26.660]  She said, the clinics are responsible for 25% of all abortions in Michigan, and notes
[03:11:26.660 --> 03:11:32.340]  how the medical recycling company, Stereocycle, stopped providing services to the abortion
[03:11:32.340 --> 03:11:35.060]  clinics, leaving them without a way to dispose of fetuses.
[03:11:35.060 --> 03:11:39.700]  I was so consumed with fetal tissue, I was ready to drive to the upper Michigan, which
[03:11:39.700 --> 03:11:43.140]  is the peninsula up there, the upper peninsula, to have a bonfire.
[03:11:43.140 --> 03:11:46.340]  And I was just trying to figure out, you know, but how if I would get stopped or how far
[03:11:46.340 --> 03:11:50.300]  I'd have to go in the woods to get this fire lit so nobody would see me.
[03:11:50.300 --> 03:11:52.540]  I mean, that is crazy.
[03:11:52.540 --> 03:11:59.340]  And that goes back to this article, this is from LifeNews.com, we also reposted it.
[03:11:59.340 --> 03:12:05.260]  And Shocking Report shows 15,000 aborted babies incinerated to heat British hospitals from
[03:12:05.260 --> 03:12:11.500]  March 24th, 2014, it was in response to that, that we made that Soylent Green video.
[03:12:11.500 --> 03:12:15.100]  And this is coming out of the telegraph, as one of the country's leading hospitals,
[03:12:15.100 --> 03:12:20.540]  Haddon Brooks in Cambridge incinerated 797 babies below 13 weeks of gestation at their
[03:12:20.540 --> 03:12:22.380]  own waste to energy plant.
[03:12:22.380 --> 03:12:25.500]  The mothers were told the remains had been cremated.
[03:12:25.500 --> 03:12:29.060]  So they probably even gave them some ashes that weren't even their babies.
[03:12:29.060 --> 03:12:34.140]  Another waste of energy facility in Ipswich Hospital owned by a private contractor incinerated
[03:12:34.140 --> 03:12:38.660]  over 1,000 fetal remains between 2011 and 2013.
[03:12:38.660 --> 03:12:41.660]  They were brought in from another hospital before being burned, generating energy for
[03:12:41.660 --> 03:12:43.060]  the hospital.
[03:12:43.060 --> 03:12:49.420]  So that's what's going on with the bodies of your, I guess, loved ones, the babies.
[03:12:49.420 --> 03:12:52.420]  And David Knight was in that video saying, if they're gonna do this to babies, they're
[03:12:52.420 --> 03:12:55.700]  gonna do it to old people, then they're gonna do it to those who are sick, then they're
[03:12:55.700 --> 03:12:58.540]  gonna turn on anybody else who's in the system.
[03:12:58.540 --> 03:13:03.700]  Just like if you read about the Night of the Long Knives, once Hitler came into power,
[03:13:03.700 --> 03:13:05.940]  he had to get rid of the people who knew where the bodies were buried.
[03:13:05.940 --> 03:13:08.180]  And that was one way of doing that.
[03:13:08.180 --> 03:13:12.580]  So coming up at the bottom of the hour, we're gonna have the restaurant owner, Art Bouvié,
[03:13:12.580 --> 03:13:14.260]  to put out a Facebook post.
[03:13:14.260 --> 03:13:17.380]  I'm gonna just read just a little bit about this Facebook post right here, a little bit
[03:13:17.380 --> 03:13:18.380]  on it.
[03:13:18.380 --> 03:13:21.060]  I guess I'm going to have a hard time getting the words out right without rambling.
[03:13:21.060 --> 03:13:23.740]  7.30 tonight, the roux was robbed by an armed robber.
[03:13:23.740 --> 03:13:24.740]  Everything else is fine.
[03:13:24.740 --> 03:13:26.060]  The crew is fine.
[03:13:26.060 --> 03:13:30.660]  And so, and then he writes in all caps, all customers, until further notice, your concealed
[03:13:30.660 --> 03:13:35.700]  carry license earns you 25% off your meal when you dine in.
[03:13:35.700 --> 03:13:39.100]  And before anybody starts thinking the roux will become the okay corral, no, I'm not advocating
[03:13:39.100 --> 03:13:42.500]  it, but hell, if the thugs are gonna come in and threaten our extended family would
[03:13:42.500 --> 03:13:47.420]  be guns, you better believe, I'll use every trick I know to protect them.
[03:13:47.420 --> 03:13:48.540]  And I think he's spot on.
[03:13:48.540 --> 03:13:52.380]  He's advertising now that he is not a gunfree zone.
[03:13:52.380 --> 03:13:57.060]  And when you advertise that you're a gunfree zone, you get thugs who come in and rob you.
[03:13:57.060 --> 03:14:01.100]  That is how it works because they know guns are not there to stop them.
[03:14:01.100 --> 03:14:05.900]  And I want to get into a little bit, it kind of carries into that, and people using cell
[03:14:05.900 --> 03:14:06.900]  phone cameras.
[03:14:06.900 --> 03:14:11.300]  You might have seen the video of the girl in the school, I think it's in California
[03:14:11.300 --> 03:14:15.940]  where she's being drug out of her chair and thrown against a wall by a cop.
[03:14:15.940 --> 03:14:21.380]  It's really a disturbing video to see that that's what goes on in your public schools.
[03:14:21.380 --> 03:14:25.940]  But now, the last week this came out, FBI chief ties higher police scrutiny to rise
[03:14:25.940 --> 03:14:26.940]  in crime.
[03:14:26.940 --> 03:14:32.020]  Comey says some officers in some cities are becoming less aggressive.
[03:14:32.020 --> 03:14:36.100]  And that's FBI director James Comey basically saying because so many people are out there
[03:14:36.100 --> 03:14:41.460]  videotaping cops and putting it up on YouTube that cops are not now doing their job.
[03:14:41.460 --> 03:14:44.780]  And then you've got places in cities like Baltimore where they're actually asking for
[03:14:44.780 --> 03:14:48.740]  the feds to come in and help, which is all part of the plan to federalize the police
[03:14:48.740 --> 03:14:52.040]  and put them under more federal control, which is not what we need.
[03:14:52.040 --> 03:14:53.700]  We do need police accountability.
[03:14:53.700 --> 03:14:57.100]  We need police to actually clean their own houses so we don't have to.
[03:14:57.100 --> 03:14:59.420]  And that's part of the part of the reason with this.
[03:14:59.420 --> 03:15:03.660]  And there's another article, FBI chief's YouTube era theory for violent crime worth considering
[03:15:03.660 --> 03:15:04.940]  experts say.
[03:15:04.940 --> 03:15:10.980]  So what they're trying to do is make it illegal eventually to come around with a camera and
[03:15:10.980 --> 03:15:11.980]  videotape the police.
[03:15:11.980 --> 03:15:14.100]  The police already do hassle you when you do do that.
[03:15:14.100 --> 03:15:16.500]  And I'm looking for a, here it is.
[03:15:16.500 --> 03:15:17.780]  This is mass private tell.
[03:15:17.780 --> 03:15:18.780]  This is just a blog.
[03:15:18.780 --> 03:15:20.460]  They put this out Tuesday.
[03:15:20.460 --> 03:15:24.340]  FBI director claims police don't like being recorded, calls it a chill one, blowing through
[03:15:24.340 --> 03:15:25.980]  American law enforcement.
[03:15:25.980 --> 03:15:31.140]  But at the end of this, he puts down the 10 ways or whoever they are, they don't list
[03:15:31.140 --> 03:15:34.060]  themselves as a writer in any way.
[03:15:34.060 --> 03:15:36.980]  10 ways that police are spying on you in public.
[03:15:36.980 --> 03:15:41.020]  Police dash cams, police body cams, red light cameras and license plate readers, traffic
[03:15:41.020 --> 03:15:46.940]  intersection cameras, highway cameras, thanks to the DEA, toll booth cameras, retail surveillance
[03:15:46.940 --> 03:15:51.740]  cameras and bake teller cameras, courthouse cameras, transit cameras, airport cameras.
[03:15:51.740 --> 03:15:53.500]  All this stuff can be accessed by police.
[03:15:53.500 --> 03:15:55.180]  You go into any, you know, a private store.
[03:15:55.180 --> 03:15:57.460]  These are all public ways that they're spying on you.
[03:15:57.460 --> 03:16:00.220]  Yet you pull out your cell phone and start filming them.
[03:16:00.220 --> 03:16:01.220]  They don't like it.
[03:16:01.220 --> 03:16:03.740]  Well, now the shoes on the other foot, maybe you should have thought of that when you want
[03:16:03.740 --> 03:16:09.580]  to set up a police surveillance site, which brings me to, let's see if I can pull this
[03:16:09.580 --> 03:16:10.580]  up.
[03:16:10.580 --> 03:16:16.700]  There's another shot, another great graphic from info wars at info wars underscore sniper.
[03:16:16.700 --> 03:16:17.700]  Here's one he did.
[03:16:17.700 --> 03:16:20.260]  If you guys can get a shot of this on the overhead cam.
[03:16:20.260 --> 03:16:24.500]  This is a Barack Obama's police state and you know, some little kids running around
[03:16:24.500 --> 03:16:28.340]  the SWAT team, the red, the tanks that they're now outfitting that they're bringing back
[03:16:28.340 --> 03:16:33.300]  from Iraq and Afghanistan to keep us safe and secure.
[03:16:33.300 --> 03:16:37.540]  And I didn't print this story out, speaking of safe and secure, but there's a Ukrainian
[03:16:37.540 --> 03:16:38.540]  city.
[03:16:38.540 --> 03:16:43.380]  If you could pull this up on daily mail, guys, as a Ukrainian city where they voted Emperor
[03:16:43.380 --> 03:16:46.380]  Palpatine to the city council.
[03:16:46.380 --> 03:16:51.300]  In fact, he went out and campaigned as Emperor Palpatine one.
[03:16:51.300 --> 03:16:53.020]  There's a picture of him coming in.
[03:16:53.020 --> 03:16:57.500]  I think Chewbacca was rested at the polls for campaigning against Darth Vader, who was
[03:16:57.500 --> 03:16:58.500]  also running.
[03:16:58.500 --> 03:16:59.500]  There it is.
[03:16:59.500 --> 03:17:00.500]  Scroll down.
[03:17:00.500 --> 03:17:01.980]  Let's get the shot of Emperor Palpatine.
[03:17:01.980 --> 03:17:08.500]  And so it really is getting crazy here in this world when you can elect the Emperor of
[03:17:08.500 --> 03:17:11.220]  the Sith to a city council.
[03:17:11.220 --> 03:17:15.260]  Of course, it's all said and jest, but what people are saying with this is we don't even
[03:17:15.260 --> 03:17:17.460]  trust the real legitimate people.
[03:17:17.460 --> 03:17:23.300]  We'd rather have this Star Wars character as our new city council representative because
[03:17:23.300 --> 03:17:28.060]  why should we elect you people when you're just gonna, you know, keep running things
[03:17:28.060 --> 03:17:29.220]  into the ground the way you're doing.
[03:17:29.220 --> 03:17:33.540]  First Chewbacca getting arrested, you're not allowed to campaign at a polling site and
[03:17:33.540 --> 03:17:34.540]  he was doing that.
[03:17:34.540 --> 03:17:40.220]  And I think Joe Biggs was out there running around right before this segment started telling
[03:17:40.220 --> 03:17:41.780]  me he had some news about Rand Paul.
[03:17:41.780 --> 03:17:45.380]  I've got a Rand Paul article here I'm gonna cover.
[03:17:45.380 --> 03:17:46.380]  Rand Paul fights back.
[03:17:46.380 --> 03:17:52.340]  I'm the only fiscal conservative in the race and he's got some special news that he was
[03:17:52.340 --> 03:17:56.700]  sharing with me and also some gun news is really important.
[03:17:56.700 --> 03:18:01.020]  The new bills that are coming out to make silencers a little more readily available
[03:18:01.020 --> 03:18:03.100]  for people.
[03:18:03.100 --> 03:18:06.620]  And another thing on some sites that are being affected by the heat.
[03:18:06.620 --> 03:18:11.180]  So we're gonna get into that coming up and yeah, come on in Joe, pull your phone out.
[03:18:11.180 --> 03:18:13.820]  You were showed, I think you have the, did you give those guys the graphic?
[03:18:13.820 --> 03:18:17.500]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I put the graphic in today's 4th hour show folder.
[03:18:17.500 --> 03:18:19.100]  All right, so you got the Hillary thing, right?
[03:18:19.100 --> 03:18:20.460]  Yeah, yeah, you got sent this.
[03:18:20.460 --> 03:18:23.740]  I think this is pretty exciting.
[03:18:23.740 --> 03:18:28.820]  Very close, I was offering $100 to whoever could get a photo of the Hillary for Prison
[03:18:28.820 --> 03:18:30.980]  t-shirt standing next to Hillary.
[03:18:30.980 --> 03:18:35.620]  There we have a Rand Paul supporter and you know his name and he's standing next to Rand
[03:18:35.620 --> 03:18:37.700]  Paul wearing the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[03:18:37.700 --> 03:18:40.260]  But what actually happened when he stood up with that t-shirt?
[03:18:40.260 --> 03:18:46.180]  All right, his name's Terry and he went to this event and stood up I guess and everyone
[03:18:46.180 --> 03:18:51.540]  saw the shirt and Rand Paul apparently said, hey, who else supports this Hillary for Prison
[03:18:51.540 --> 03:18:54.700]  t-shirt idea and apparently the whole crowd erupted went crazy.
[03:18:54.700 --> 03:18:59.220]  So we're waiting on that footage to come in, but that's something that I would like to
[03:18:59.220 --> 03:19:02.380]  encourage Rand Paul to do in the upcoming debate.
[03:19:02.380 --> 03:19:05.620]  Mr. Rand Paul, we will send you a shirt overnight.
[03:19:05.620 --> 03:19:10.140]  If you wear this to the debate and at a very key time, I don't know, open that up, do the
[03:19:10.140 --> 03:19:15.180]  Superman move like I did at the Donald Trump rally and show that it's gonna be everywhere.
[03:19:15.180 --> 03:19:16.700]  It will make headlines every day.
[03:19:16.700 --> 03:19:18.780]  And it'll be a huge boost for his campaign.
[03:19:18.780 --> 03:19:23.220]  It'll definitely help out because people want to see that, people they're looking to him
[03:19:23.220 --> 03:19:25.860]  for that kind of action, reaction.
[03:19:25.860 --> 03:19:26.860]  Exactly.
[03:19:26.860 --> 03:19:30.620]  Exactly, not necessarily match what Donald Trump is doing running around calling everybody
[03:19:30.620 --> 03:19:35.100]  a jerk and whatnot, but just some life, you know, it's like you can't have a lifeless
[03:19:35.100 --> 03:19:38.940]  candidate and not that Rand Paul is lifeless, but he needs to do something to springboard
[03:19:38.940 --> 03:19:39.940]  his campaign.
[03:19:39.940 --> 03:19:43.020]  I think this would be a great way to do it, especially we're still early on in this.
[03:19:43.020 --> 03:19:46.220]  This will be our third debate coverage that we're gonna be doing live.
[03:19:46.220 --> 03:19:47.220]  I've already sent him a tweet.
[03:19:47.220 --> 03:19:51.100]  I've already sent him a tweet saying, Hey, we'll send you this shirt and let's get that
[03:19:51.100 --> 03:19:52.100]  out here in the next debate.
[03:19:52.100 --> 03:19:53.100]  All right.
[03:19:53.100 --> 03:19:54.100]  We got some gun news coming up in the next segment.
[03:19:54.100 --> 03:19:55.100]  So stay tuned.
[03:19:55.100 --> 03:19:56.500]  It's the Overdrive Hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:56.500 --> 03:19:57.500]  I'm your host, Rob Do.
[03:19:57.500 --> 03:19:58.500]  Joe Big sitting in with me.
[03:19:58.500 --> 03:20:02.820]  Do you lay awake at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved
[03:20:02.820 --> 03:20:03.820]  ones?
[03:20:03.820 --> 03:20:07.260]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[03:20:07.260 --> 03:20:10.860]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to
[03:20:10.860 --> 03:20:12.740]  emerge in the world today?
[03:20:12.740 --> 03:20:16.380]  Give yourself peace of mind with supernatural silver.
[03:20:16.380 --> 03:20:20.940]  Supernatural silver is turning heads around the world as a new weapon in the fight against
[03:20:20.940 --> 03:20:24.340]  bacteria, viruses and fungus.
[03:20:24.340 --> 03:20:28.860]  Supernatural silver can be taken internally or used topically to help the body's own immune
[03:20:28.860 --> 03:20:32.500]  system fight off disease much more effectively.

[03:20:36.860 --> 03:20:41.420]  and has been proven to be safe and highly effective against some of the planet's deadliest
[03:20:41.420 --> 03:20:42.700]  pathogens.

[03:20:58.980 --> 03:21:03.420]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built up toxins and even dangerous objects known
[03:21:03.420 --> 03:21:04.620]  as liver stones.
[03:21:04.620 --> 03:21:09.620]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and
[03:21:09.620 --> 03:21:14.340]  other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research
[03:21:14.340 --> 03:21:18.660]  and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum
[03:21:18.660 --> 03:21:19.660]  effect.
[03:21:19.660 --> 03:21:23.780]  Liver shield is the only liver support product in the market that uses a patented spy Jurex

[03:21:40.660 --> 03:21:44.980]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.

[03:23:00.820 --> 03:23:05.500]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages or war.
[03:23:05.500 --> 03:23:09.780]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:23:09.780 --> 03:23:11.180]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:23:11.180 --> 03:23:15.060]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water, but have you considered
[03:23:15.060 --> 03:23:16.060]  heat storage?
[03:23:16.060 --> 03:23:18.660]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:23:18.660 --> 03:23:20.900]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:23:20.900 --> 03:23:22.500]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:23:22.500 --> 03:23:26.100]  The standard answers are firewood, coal or propane, but the problem with that if you
[03:23:26.100 --> 03:23:30.060]  need to be on the move is you can't take it with you.
[03:23:30.060 --> 03:23:34.180]  By concern, there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times
[03:23:34.180 --> 03:23:35.180]  of war.
[03:23:35.180 --> 03:23:37.580]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:23:37.580 --> 03:23:41.660]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:23:41.660 --> 03:23:44.180]  For these answers, go to fortressclothing.com.
[03:23:44.180 --> 03:23:49.140]  Again, fortressclothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:23:49.140 --> 03:23:51.220]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[03:23:51.220 --> 03:24:18.660]  Fortressclothing.com, you'll never be cold again.
[03:24:18.660 --> 03:24:23.580]  Well Rand Paul is being attacked from all corners, Fox News is ignoring him, and then out of
[03:24:23.580 --> 03:24:26.580]  Politico we have this article just handed to me.
[03:24:26.580 --> 03:24:28.260]  Republicans fret about Paul's Senate seat.
[03:24:28.260 --> 03:24:32.340]  Some D.C. and Kentucky Republicans want Paul to end his presidential campaign and focus
[03:24:32.340 --> 03:24:35.180]  on his 2016 Senate re-election.
[03:24:35.180 --> 03:24:37.540]  I don't think he's going to have any trouble getting re-elected.
[03:24:37.540 --> 03:24:40.900]  I think people like what they see at a Rand Paul in the Senate.
[03:24:40.900 --> 03:24:44.060]  It's not necessarily a slam dunk, so he should concentrate on it.
[03:24:44.060 --> 03:24:45.700]  You never know what could happen.
[03:24:45.700 --> 03:24:51.300]  But I guarantee he wants to make some noise and have some chatter on about him.
[03:24:51.300 --> 03:24:53.580]  Wear that Hillary for prison t-shirt, Rand.
[03:24:53.580 --> 03:24:56.660]  And we just got a brand new shipment in, so everything's back in stock.
[03:24:56.660 --> 03:24:57.660]  Pickers up today.
[03:24:57.660 --> 03:24:59.980]  It's only 1995 at the InfoWars store.
[03:24:59.980 --> 03:25:00.980]  That's it.
[03:25:00.980 --> 03:25:03.380]  So now, Joe Biggs, you've got some gun news.
[03:25:03.380 --> 03:25:04.380]  Where do you want to start?
[03:25:04.380 --> 03:25:07.620]  All right, so first we can talk about the silencers.
[03:25:07.620 --> 03:25:13.100]  So right now there is a new bill on the table that they're trying to get passed.
[03:25:13.100 --> 03:25:19.220]  It's called the Hearing Protection Act, and basically what that is, it says that we need
[03:25:19.220 --> 03:25:24.860]  silencers for one purpose, for protection, for ear protection.
[03:25:24.860 --> 03:25:26.420]  You've got a lot of people out there that go hunting.
[03:25:26.420 --> 03:25:28.940]  There's a lot of people that go out there that do it for sport and all that stuff.
[03:25:28.940 --> 03:25:32.500]  And a lot of people that have long-term effects from shooting guns as well.
[03:25:32.500 --> 03:25:34.140]  In combat, we had them as well.
[03:25:34.140 --> 03:25:39.900]  It's a great way to be able to have those earbuds out that stops you from being able
[03:25:39.900 --> 03:25:42.620]  to hear what's going on, commands, things like that.
[03:25:42.620 --> 03:25:45.180]  Something like on a shooting range, you need to be able to communicate and hear one another.
[03:25:45.180 --> 03:25:48.300]  And when you have those ear plugs in, it's hard to do that.
[03:25:48.300 --> 03:25:52.660]  So the silencer, it gives you that ability to be able to communicate, and it's more
[03:25:52.660 --> 03:25:53.660]  safe.
[03:25:53.660 --> 03:25:56.860]  You have to get through the whole sigmatism, the idea that people think that silencers-
[03:25:56.860 --> 03:25:57.860]  It's only for assassins.
[03:25:57.860 --> 03:25:59.540]  For hitman's, assassins, things like that.
[03:25:59.540 --> 03:26:02.740]  You've got these super-sinky squirrel people who are hopping out of the tree lines, and
[03:26:02.740 --> 03:26:05.100]  they're just going to start shooting everybody, which just isn't the case.
[03:26:05.100 --> 03:26:08.140]  I mean, these are going to be people who are already legally law-abiding.
[03:26:08.140 --> 03:26:11.180]  I mean, it's already a pretty rough process you have to go through with the ATF.
[03:26:11.180 --> 03:26:16.060]  You've got to spend upwards of $600 or $400 to get that, and you've got about a four
[03:26:16.060 --> 03:26:19.060]  to six-month wait for that to happen, and they give you the stamp.
[03:26:19.060 --> 03:26:21.060]  And what's the name of the bill?
[03:26:21.060 --> 03:26:27.020]  It's HR 3799, and you can go to congress.gov.
[03:26:27.020 --> 03:26:28.020]  They just had the article.
[03:26:28.020 --> 03:26:29.020]  Yeah, it's up right there.
[03:26:29.020 --> 03:26:30.020]  And you can read about that.
[03:26:30.020 --> 03:26:34.820]  If you click on the text where it says, Text 1, and go down, it'll actually break down
[03:26:34.820 --> 03:26:36.420]  what all that is.
[03:26:36.420 --> 03:26:39.340]  So it's definitely something that I'm looking forward to.
[03:26:39.340 --> 03:26:42.180]  And today, I went and talked to a guy at the silencer shop.
[03:26:42.180 --> 03:26:48.340]  It is a distribution place here in Austin, Texas, and he said that he doesn't believe
[03:26:48.340 --> 03:26:52.420]  this will pass with this administration, but maybe in the next four to five years, there's
[03:26:52.420 --> 03:26:55.340]  a good possibility that something like this will pass.
[03:26:55.340 --> 03:27:00.180]  And I asked him, I said, how many silencers does a place like this actually put out in
[03:27:00.180 --> 03:27:01.180]  a month?
[03:27:01.180 --> 03:27:04.700]  They sell 3,000 at least a month.
[03:27:04.700 --> 03:27:05.780]  I mean, that's pretty shocking.
[03:27:05.780 --> 03:27:07.860]  I didn't think there was that many people out there buying them.
[03:27:07.860 --> 03:27:08.860]  And where are those going?
[03:27:08.860 --> 03:27:10.740]  Like, they're going to private citizens or the market?
[03:27:10.740 --> 03:27:11.740]  Private citizens, yeah.
[03:27:11.740 --> 03:27:13.620]  And these a lot of returning customers, people buy them.
[03:27:13.620 --> 03:27:15.180]  I mean, I got to hold some of the guns.
[03:27:15.180 --> 03:27:19.220]  So Jakar Jackson's working on that video, and we'll have that report out tonight, hopefully.
[03:27:19.220 --> 03:27:20.980]  But yeah, it doesn't really add that much weight.
[03:27:20.980 --> 03:27:21.980]  I was kind of curious.
[03:27:21.980 --> 03:27:24.460]  You see how it would fill in the front of a Glock or something like that.
[03:27:24.460 --> 03:27:27.380]  It really doesn't make it harder to shoot or anything like that.
[03:27:27.380 --> 03:27:28.380]  So it's really neat.
[03:27:28.380 --> 03:27:32.700]  And I got to see one of them with a silencer on a.338 Lapua, which is a really awesome
[03:27:32.700 --> 03:27:33.700]  rifle.
[03:27:33.700 --> 03:27:34.700]  Oh, yeah.
[03:27:34.700 --> 03:27:41.540]  And switching gears, we have an article out by Bearing Arms.
[03:27:41.540 --> 03:27:46.260]  And this is talking about a faulty optic that's out there site.
[03:27:46.260 --> 03:27:48.540]  You can see the article if they want to pull it up.
[03:27:48.540 --> 03:27:50.620]  It's the Bearing Arms one.
[03:27:50.620 --> 03:27:55.100]  And it's very interesting when you actually start looking into this, we'll have to break
[03:27:55.100 --> 03:27:57.020]  down what a lot of this stuff means.
[03:27:57.020 --> 03:28:02.220]  But it says that this company is putting out a site where they say in the guarantee that
[03:28:02.220 --> 03:28:06.100]  if there's any kind of temperature increase like that, it won't shift the MOA.
[03:28:06.100 --> 03:28:08.180]  And what MOA is, let me break that down.
[03:28:08.180 --> 03:28:10.860]  I've copied out the definition.
[03:28:10.860 --> 03:28:13.020]  It means a minute of angle.
[03:28:13.020 --> 03:28:14.260]  That is an angular measurement.
[03:28:14.260 --> 03:28:17.740]  The MOA is, so for every 100 yards, that's an inch.
[03:28:17.740 --> 03:28:23.540]  Now, this optics company, they found out that when this holographic site heats up in a place
[03:28:23.540 --> 03:28:29.580]  like Iraq, Afghanistan, it shifts for MOA.
[03:28:29.580 --> 03:28:33.100]  So if you're shooting, say, if you're an operator and you've got a hostage and you've
[03:28:33.100 --> 03:28:36.940]  got a terrorist sitting there, that four inches means the difference between one person's
[03:28:36.940 --> 03:28:39.540]  head and another or however you're trying to do something.
[03:28:39.540 --> 03:28:43.020]  So for these guys overseas who are working in these hostile environments that really
[03:28:43.020 --> 03:28:47.420]  have to actually go in Delta boys, all these guys are going in and working in these hostage
[03:28:47.420 --> 03:28:48.420]  situations.
[03:28:48.420 --> 03:28:52.660]  That's the meaning between you getting your target and then getting an innocent person.
[03:28:52.660 --> 03:28:55.660]  So it could really affect those precision type shots from people.
[03:28:55.660 --> 03:28:56.660]  That's interesting.
[03:28:56.660 --> 03:29:02.060]  They're very interesting going and people need to be aware of news like that and that's
[03:29:02.060 --> 03:29:03.060]  one way.
[03:29:03.060 --> 03:29:06.060]  So how do you know if your site's out and how do you fix that if it is out?
[03:29:06.060 --> 03:29:10.940]  Well, my suggestion is obviously you want to site that in the area that you're going
[03:29:10.940 --> 03:29:11.940]  to be firing in.
[03:29:11.940 --> 03:29:17.020]  So if you were to go back overseas, say to Iraq, I would re-site it in and try to look
[03:29:17.020 --> 03:29:18.020]  at it.
[03:29:18.020 --> 03:29:22.540]  But those extreme temperatures like that, they're saying that's moving over four MOA, so that's
[03:29:22.540 --> 03:29:23.540]  a good way away.
[03:29:23.540 --> 03:29:26.740]  So you've got to site it in, you've got to stay on it, but if it's not hitting that target
[03:29:26.740 --> 03:29:28.700]  at 100 yards, you know that something's up.
[03:29:28.700 --> 03:29:29.700]  Wow.
[03:29:29.700 --> 03:29:30.700]  Well, hey, Joe, stay right there.
[03:29:30.700 --> 03:29:32.580]  We're going to have in the next segment, Art Bouvier.
[03:29:32.580 --> 03:29:36.540]  He's the restaurant owner giving you a 25% discount to conceal carry owners.
[03:29:36.540 --> 03:29:39.820]  And I think Joe's probably a good person to have in here with during this interview.
[03:29:39.820 --> 03:29:41.260]  So we're going to be talking to him next.
[03:29:41.260 --> 03:29:43.740]  And then after that, David Knight's going to be telling us what's in the affords nightly
[03:29:43.740 --> 03:29:44.740]  news.
[03:29:44.740 --> 03:29:45.740]  It's Rob Duh, the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:29:45.740 --> 03:29:48.020]  Thanks for watching.
[03:29:48.020 --> 03:29:49.340]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.340 --> 03:29:51.820]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.820 --> 03:29:58.820]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.820 --> 03:30:03.140]  Coming up this Wednesday, the 28th from seven to 10 p.m. Central Info Wars is going to be
[03:30:03.140 --> 03:30:08.820]  here live analyzing the Republican debates, a look at all the BS propaganda that's going
[03:30:08.820 --> 03:30:09.820]  on in these debates.
[03:30:09.820 --> 03:30:14.460]  And people need to understand we're not doing this to promote any one particular candidate
[03:30:14.460 --> 03:30:18.060]  because we know at top levels that these guys are at a lot of them are pretty much fixed
[03:30:18.060 --> 03:30:19.060]  horses.
[03:30:19.060 --> 03:30:22.780]  Like Trump has said himself picks up the phone at three in the morning, he calls whoever
[03:30:22.780 --> 03:30:25.980]  the candidate is, he says, Hey, I need you to do this favor for me, then they hop up
[03:30:25.980 --> 03:30:26.980]  and do it.
[03:30:26.980 --> 03:30:30.220]  He's saying that the political system is broken and I could not agree more with that.
[03:30:30.220 --> 03:30:34.740]  We're doing this more as a way to educate the general public about the left, right paradigm
[03:30:34.740 --> 03:30:38.220]  and how you don't have to choose between a Republican and a Democrat.
[03:30:38.220 --> 03:30:42.020]  It's going to be on CNBC and they say that some of the hot issues that they're going
[03:30:42.020 --> 03:30:45.620]  to be talking about this time around are going to be taxes, retirement, spending and
[03:30:45.620 --> 03:30:46.620]  job growth.
[03:30:46.620 --> 03:30:47.620]  So stay tuned.
[03:30:47.620 --> 03:30:52.780]  We'll be here this Wednesday, the 28th from seven to 10 p.m. central, myself, David Knight,
[03:30:52.780 --> 03:30:56.500]  Joe Biggs, as well as the rest of the crew are going to be here breaking all this down

[03:32:58.980 --> 03:33:06.180]  You know, Australia's a good example, Canada's a good example, the UK is a good example, why?
[03:33:06.180 --> 03:33:08.660]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[03:33:08.660 --> 03:33:13.940]  Somebody somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.
[03:33:13.940 --> 03:33:17.460]  Well, this is something we should politicize.
[03:33:17.460 --> 03:33:20.300]  I'm not going to carry a gun, I don't want to be involved in a gunfight.
[03:33:20.300 --> 03:33:28.540]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban picking
[03:33:28.540 --> 03:33:33.020]  up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[03:33:38.020 --> 03:33:41.020]  Go ahead, make my day.
[03:33:41.020 --> 03:33:45.780]  So the notion that gun laws don't work, is not borne out by the evidence.
[03:33:45.780 --> 03:33:51.540]  He says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody 4th of July weekend.
[03:33:51.540 --> 03:33:57.860]  Nonetheless, as you indicated Corey, there was a count of casualties that could have been
[03:33:57.860 --> 03:34:00.060]  from Afghanistan or Iraq.
[03:34:00.060 --> 03:34:05.460]  We'll make it harder for law abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns.
[03:34:05.460 --> 03:34:12.980]  In many cases, the offenders, felons, some out on parole, some out on bond.
[03:34:12.980 --> 03:34:18.540]  We have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and
[03:34:18.540 --> 03:34:20.180]  their families from violence.
[03:34:20.180 --> 03:34:27.500]  There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards, 24 hours a day, seven
[03:34:27.500 --> 03:34:28.500]  days a week.
[03:34:28.500 --> 03:34:30.940]  The average American does not have that.
[03:34:30.940 --> 03:34:36.780]  Mayor Bloomberg, why can you defend yourself but not the majority of Americans?
[03:34:36.780 --> 03:34:39.420]  I mean, look at the team of security you got.
[03:34:39.420 --> 03:34:42.180]  Every day, every school at every level.
[03:34:42.180 --> 03:34:46.100]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we
[03:34:46.100 --> 03:34:50.500]  just have to be repetitive about this and we need to do this every day of the week and
[03:34:50.500 --> 03:34:55.420]  just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[03:34:55.420 --> 03:34:59.340]  Is this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist?
[03:34:59.340 --> 03:35:04.460]  When a five-year-old girl said she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles, the
[03:35:04.460 --> 03:35:07.180]  school calls it a terrorist threat.
[03:35:07.180 --> 03:35:11.340]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[03:35:11.340 --> 03:35:15.420]  You know, the right to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny.
[03:35:15.420 --> 03:35:18.420]  Lay down your arms, you damn rebels!
[03:35:18.420 --> 03:35:23.660]  But we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army or the police.
[03:35:23.660 --> 03:35:26.460]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[03:35:26.460 --> 03:35:30.860]  I mean, we've got a lot of competition with a lot of people that it's not part of weapons.
[03:35:30.860 --> 03:35:36.460]  Government, the courage it would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[03:35:36.460 --> 03:35:44.660]  To say we're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not knocking down if you want to, I'm at take-home.
[03:35:44.660 --> 03:35:49.660]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:35:49.660 --> 03:36:01.660]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:36:01.660 --> 03:36:08.660]  And seeing that footage I shot back in 2009 of the reenactment of the shot heard around the world made me think of this.
[03:36:08.660 --> 03:36:10.660]  I retweeted this today on this day in history.
[03:36:10.660 --> 03:36:16.660]  King George III ordered troops dispatched to crush the burgeoning rebellion in the colonies.
[03:36:16.660 --> 03:36:20.660]  The speech to the parliament, which basically gave them the okay to actually go out.
[03:36:20.660 --> 03:36:24.660]  You can see a little picture that tweet that I retweeted right there.
[03:36:24.660 --> 03:36:29.660]  And, you know, it's amazing how history and everything works.
[03:36:29.660 --> 03:36:31.660]  And now we're still talking about guns.
[03:36:31.660 --> 03:36:45.660]  You've got this restaurant magazine called The Eater that say that, you know, not all customers are happy with Art Bouvier's decision to extend a 25% discount to conceal carry license holders.
[03:36:45.660 --> 03:36:48.660]  And he finds that weird. But then you got USA Today.
[03:36:48.660 --> 03:36:52.660]  Here's the article that says, let's see, what's the headline here?
[03:36:52.660 --> 03:36:56.660]  Cajuns are crowds eat up Cajun restaurants gun stance.
[03:36:56.660 --> 03:37:00.660]  We've got the owner on the line now, Mr. Art Bouvier.
[03:37:00.660 --> 03:37:05.660]  He's the 46 year old owner and proprietor of Paparrou restaurant in Indianapolis.
[03:37:05.660 --> 03:37:07.660]  And are you there, Art? Can you hear me?
[03:37:07.660 --> 03:37:11.660]  Here, hello. How did I get to be 46? My gosh.
[03:37:11.660 --> 03:37:15.660]  You're really 46. I am 46, but how did that happen?
[03:37:15.660 --> 03:37:20.660]  I tell you, I feel the same way. I'm 41. So who know, you know, just the other day.
[03:37:20.660 --> 03:37:27.660]  There was 20 years I read somewhere of that book, Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus, that I saw everywhere when I was 20.
[03:37:27.660 --> 03:37:32.660]  20 years ago, they said it came out. I started grabbing my heart.
[03:37:32.660 --> 03:37:39.660]  So, Mr. Bouvier, you have definitely caused a stir, which hopefully has increased your business and hopefully kept the thuggies out.
[03:37:39.660 --> 03:37:43.660]  What has been the response to the people in your area?
[03:37:43.660 --> 03:37:48.660]  Oh, it's been incredible, overwhelmingly positive.
[03:37:48.660 --> 03:37:54.660]  I went ahead and dug up the stats from yesterday, our first business day since I made the announcement.
[03:37:54.660 --> 03:38:00.660]  And our business was up 400% from a normal Monday.
[03:38:00.660 --> 03:38:02.660]  Oh, Monday. That's crazy.
[03:38:02.660 --> 03:38:08.660]  Yeah, no, I know. And now, keep in mind, some of it is that Mondays are unfortunately bad for a restaurant.
[03:38:08.660 --> 03:38:10.660]  Oh, right. Yeah.
[03:38:10.660 --> 03:38:20.660]  But still, you know, this was up 400%. And we, we ended up actually awarding a total of 110 carry license discounts.
[03:38:20.660 --> 03:38:30.660]  But I do believe that the number was actually higher on carry licenses brought in because we had, I wasn't prepared for a high number of people that said,
[03:38:30.660 --> 03:38:33.660]  I do have my license. I don't want your discount.
[03:38:33.660 --> 03:38:38.660]  So there you go. Just willing to stand up for gun rights.
[03:38:38.660 --> 03:38:42.660]  And that's, you know, and I know you said in your Facebook post, you don't want to turn this into a debate.
[03:38:42.660 --> 03:38:48.660]  I think the left is probably going to try to turn this into a debate saying, oh, do we want people armed in the restaurant?
[03:38:48.660 --> 03:38:52.660]  Obviously, they were armed on Monday night. You had plenty of people armed and nothing happened.
[03:38:52.660 --> 03:38:54.660]  And I think it's good that you're putting out those statistics.
[03:38:54.660 --> 03:38:58.660]  You may want to post those on the door for thugs.
[03:38:58.660 --> 03:39:02.660]  Think twice before entering here. Monday, we had this many. Tuesday, we had this many.
[03:39:02.660 --> 03:39:06.660]  You know, you have to do that because when you put up, we don't allow firearms in here.
[03:39:06.660 --> 03:39:10.660]  You know, when you go to some places, they say, we don't want firearms in this area.
[03:39:10.660 --> 03:39:14.660]  What does that tell you? It tells the thugs and the crooks out there that it's open season.
[03:39:14.660 --> 03:39:18.660]  Yeah, exactly. When you're someone out there that's, you know, intending to do harm, you look for soft targets.
[03:39:18.660 --> 03:39:19.660]  Yeah.
[03:39:19.660 --> 03:39:23.660]  And when you see that, you know, you've got a good chance of making it in and out, getting what you want.
[03:39:23.660 --> 03:39:29.660]  I've had a few customers tell me that they, you know, why I'm not comfortable knowing that there'll be people in the restaurant with a gun?
[03:39:29.660 --> 03:39:32.660]  There was a guy in the restaurant with a gun Saturday night. He's the one that took my money.
[03:39:32.660 --> 03:39:34.660]  Yeah. And he could have taken everybody's money.
[03:39:34.660 --> 03:39:35.660]  Then these people watched Pulp Fiction.
[03:39:35.660 --> 03:39:37.660]  I don't want them getting bold in taking lives.
[03:39:37.660 --> 03:39:41.660]  Exactly. Or trying to take hostages or create a bigger scene.
[03:39:41.660 --> 03:39:45.660]  I mean, that's what you really need to worry about. That could be something that can get out of control.
[03:39:45.660 --> 03:39:47.660]  It's concealed carry. You're not even going to know.
[03:39:47.660 --> 03:39:48.660]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:39:48.660 --> 03:39:53.660]  I've been at anti-gun rallies before where there was a huge amount of people in that crowd carrying weapons.
[03:39:53.660 --> 03:39:57.660]  No one even knew. No one was flipping out. There's no one running around. You can't tell.
[03:39:57.660 --> 03:40:04.660]  Mr. Bavier sitting with me is Joe Biggs. He's a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan and one of our big gun guys here at the office.
[03:40:04.660 --> 03:40:08.660]  And so I thought it'd be great to have him in here to get his perspective.
[03:40:08.660 --> 03:40:12.660]  How was your crew taking to this information? Have they been very supportive?
[03:40:12.660 --> 03:40:14.660]  What's it been like with your employees?
[03:40:14.660 --> 03:40:17.660]  Most of my crew actually carries to begin with.
[03:40:17.660 --> 03:40:26.660]  I have some of the older and more seasoned employees that I am perfectly fine with them carrying while they work.
[03:40:26.660 --> 03:40:35.660]  The ones that are either newer to the business or younger in general, I simply ask them to check it to where it's available in an emergency.
[03:40:35.660 --> 03:40:37.660]  But no, they're fine with it.
[03:40:37.660 --> 03:40:43.660]  And what's interesting is this whole idea came out of the fact that on Saturday night when this happened, after the guy left,
[03:40:43.660 --> 03:40:47.660]  and while we were on the phone with the police, a diner came forward and said,
[03:40:47.660 --> 03:40:56.660]  I just wanted you to know I am carrying and I was aware of your situation, but I had your back in the event that it became a life or death situation.
[03:40:56.660 --> 03:41:00.660]  I'm not going to create the life or death situation, but I had your back if it became one.
[03:41:00.660 --> 03:41:02.660]  Well, that's exactly the attitude I want.
[03:41:02.660 --> 03:41:10.660]  Yeah, exactly. You don't want to, like you say, you don't want to defend it to an okay corral situation, which incidentally happened yesterday in history.
[03:41:10.660 --> 03:41:14.660]  There's just all these weird historical anomalies are adding up today.
[03:41:14.660 --> 03:41:18.660]  Physically speaking, people who have concealed carry permits are way more law abiding.
[03:41:18.660 --> 03:41:24.660]  They understand the law and they understand the risks involved, the amount of responsibility that that person holds.
[03:41:24.660 --> 03:41:27.660]  So yeah, that's awesome that guy said, hey, I'm stepping back.
[03:41:27.660 --> 03:41:30.660]  If it gets out of hand, then I have that.
[03:41:30.660 --> 03:41:34.660]  But to know that's how concealed carries are, the thought process they're going through.
[03:41:34.660 --> 03:41:37.660]  Yeah, if somebody pulls it out and starts shooting, that's the time to react.
[03:41:37.660 --> 03:41:39.660]  Or even if they pull it out and start aiming, this guy never did pull the gun.
[03:41:39.660 --> 03:41:41.660]  He just said he had one, right?
[03:41:41.660 --> 03:41:42.660]  Correct.
[03:41:42.660 --> 03:41:49.660]  Well, the reason I am rewarding the legal document of the license to carry and not actually the gun.
[03:41:49.660 --> 03:41:52.660]  I don't care if people carry. I don't care if they carry open.
[03:41:52.660 --> 03:41:56.660]  I don't want to tell people how to carry. Do what you do.
[03:41:56.660 --> 03:42:01.660]  But I am interested in the document because it proves to me that you are a law abiding citizen.
[03:42:01.660 --> 03:42:03.660]  You've not been convicted of a felony.
[03:42:03.660 --> 03:42:06.660]  And in general, I consider that to be a stable individual.
[03:42:06.660 --> 03:42:07.660]  Those are the people I'm after.
[03:42:07.660 --> 03:42:09.660]  Yeah, I very much agree.
[03:42:09.660 --> 03:42:12.660]  I've been through the class. I never applied for my permit.
[03:42:12.660 --> 03:42:18.660]  But sitting through the eight hour class, you really learn a lot of common sense stuff that you may not have thought about.
[03:42:18.660 --> 03:42:20.660]  And then going out and doing the shooting.
[03:42:20.660 --> 03:42:22.660]  Well, it also puts a little fear in you too as well though.
[03:42:22.660 --> 03:42:23.660]  Exactly.
[03:42:23.660 --> 03:42:26.660]  It lets you know the consequences of when you pull that gun. That's it.
[03:42:26.660 --> 03:42:27.660]  Yeah.
[03:42:27.660 --> 03:42:31.660]  It's go time. You better have proof and a reason why you did that.
[03:42:31.660 --> 03:42:33.660]  And you better have the proof to back it up.
[03:42:33.660 --> 03:42:35.660]  And you better know how to talk to the cops when you have one too.
[03:42:35.660 --> 03:42:38.660]  Because there's a certain way you want to talk to them.
[03:42:38.660 --> 03:42:40.660]  Because that's another way it could get out of hand.
[03:42:40.660 --> 03:42:46.660]  But you never really hear of concealed carry people getting shot by police because they know exactly how to talk to cops when they arrive.
[03:42:46.660 --> 03:42:50.660]  Now, how long did it take the police to arrive at your restaurant, Mr. Bouvier?
[03:42:50.660 --> 03:42:52.660]  Actually, they were there fairly quickly.
[03:42:52.660 --> 03:42:55.660]  I've got a good rapport with the police.
[03:42:55.660 --> 03:43:03.660]  I wouldn't say that they were emergency responders in the sense that it would have helped had it become a life of death situation.
[03:43:03.660 --> 03:43:06.660]  But they were there fairly quickly for my employees.
[03:43:06.660 --> 03:43:08.660]  I myself wasn't present on Saturday night.
[03:43:08.660 --> 03:43:11.660]  But my manager says they arrive fairly quickly to take the report.
[03:43:11.660 --> 03:43:12.660]  Yeah.
[03:43:12.660 --> 03:43:16.660]  But it's like they say, when seconds count, you know, police are minutes away.
[03:43:16.660 --> 03:43:17.660]  And that's a perfect...
[03:43:17.660 --> 03:43:21.660]  It would not have been an emergency responder status worthy of anything.
[03:43:21.660 --> 03:43:25.660]  I mean, you've got the police in Detroit. You've got people all over coming out saying, hey, we need citizens to be armed.
[03:43:25.660 --> 03:43:28.660]  Because we can't always be there right when you need us.
[03:43:28.660 --> 03:43:31.660]  And it's a sad thing. A lot of times by the time they get there, there's a body count.
[03:43:31.660 --> 03:43:33.660]  So it's good when you have that backup.
[03:43:33.660 --> 03:43:38.660]  So what are the gun laws like in Indiana? Are they oppressive as they are in Chicago?
[03:43:38.660 --> 03:43:45.660]  I would actually have to say they're fairly lax without wanting to sound political in any way.
[03:43:45.660 --> 03:43:55.660]  I wouldn't mind if they were a little less lax because I am truly after the person that has had the training is absolutely mature and legit and stable.
[03:43:55.660 --> 03:44:00.660]  I can't say that in Indiana, having a carry license guarantees all of those things.
[03:44:00.660 --> 03:44:06.660]  I do think that in general, having a carry license implies that you are more stable than the rest.
[03:44:06.660 --> 03:44:08.660]  But certainly I have no proof of that.
[03:44:08.660 --> 03:44:09.660]  Yeah.
[03:44:09.660 --> 03:44:15.660]  So when you opened up a Cajun restaurant in Indianapolis, did you actually bring the recipes from Louisiana?
[03:44:15.660 --> 03:44:18.660]  What made you want to decide to open that type of establishment?
[03:44:18.660 --> 03:44:25.660]  I left New Orleans in 1996 because I wanted to have a good computer job.
[03:44:25.660 --> 03:44:29.660]  I was in computers and I knew that if I stayed in New Orleans, I would be stuck running a restaurant my whole life.
[03:44:29.660 --> 03:44:37.660]  So I came up north and worked in corporate America and IT for about 15 years and then just decided I had enough of it.
[03:44:37.660 --> 03:44:41.660]  And I looked at my wife and said, well, let's plan B, let's open a restaurant.
[03:44:41.660 --> 03:44:42.660]  So here I am.
[03:44:42.660 --> 03:44:48.660]  They're all recipes that I grew up with and it's all the real deal.
[03:44:48.660 --> 03:44:50.660]  Well, let's pull up his Yelp right now.
[03:44:50.660 --> 03:44:58.660]  I think we had the Yelp site up a little bit earlier, but let's pull that up and people who are in your area could actually come and maybe we can get you 800% support after this.
[03:44:58.660 --> 03:44:59.660]  That's Papa Rue.
[03:44:59.660 --> 03:45:06.660]  At the moment, I am actually in a little bit of a battle with the people that don't like my decision.
[03:45:06.660 --> 03:45:12.660]  So I wouldn't be surprised if there's some complete flat goose egg reviews on there that look a little shady.
[03:45:12.660 --> 03:45:13.660]  Sure.
[03:45:13.660 --> 03:45:19.660]  That always happens and I see a lot of five star reviews right now, but there's a four star.
[03:45:19.660 --> 03:45:20.660]  Lots of reviews there.
[03:45:20.660 --> 03:45:21.660]  You can check it out.
[03:45:21.660 --> 03:45:24.660]  Papa Rue is the name of the restaurant.
[03:45:24.660 --> 03:45:28.660]  And what are the police?
[03:45:28.660 --> 03:45:29.660]  What are they saying about this?
[03:45:29.660 --> 03:45:31.660]  Because I know you actually offer 50% discounts.
[03:45:31.660 --> 03:45:33.660]  They are 100% supportive of this.
[03:45:33.660 --> 03:45:37.660]  I've actually had a joke with them because they get a 50% discount always have.
[03:45:37.660 --> 03:45:40.660]  And I've told them, you can't stack the discounts now.
[03:45:40.660 --> 03:45:42.660]  Here's a good idea for you.
[03:45:42.660 --> 03:45:50.660]  You should take your employees to the range and take those targets from the range and hang them up in the window and say, this is how our employees shoot.
[03:45:50.660 --> 03:45:51.660]  Right.
[03:45:51.660 --> 03:45:52.660]  Right.
[03:45:52.660 --> 03:45:53.660]  Before you enter.
[03:45:53.660 --> 03:45:55.660]  I've got some fabulous ideas.
[03:45:55.660 --> 03:45:57.660]  Protected by the second amendment.
[03:45:57.660 --> 03:45:59.660]  Have a sticker that says I put it up on the window.
[03:45:59.660 --> 03:46:00.660]  This says, yeah, exactly.
[03:46:00.660 --> 03:46:07.660]  You know, you have to come out guns a blazing figuratively with the criminal element out there because you never know when it could happen.
[03:46:07.660 --> 03:46:13.660]  Well, now, mostly I actually look at this as a mental propaganda exercise.
[03:46:13.660 --> 03:46:22.660]  I would like to know that the criminals at least are worried that the odds might not be in their favor.
[03:46:22.660 --> 03:46:24.660]  Whether they are or not is really irrelevant.
[03:46:24.660 --> 03:46:26.660]  I want people to have to worry about it.
[03:46:26.660 --> 03:46:28.660]  It's that hesitation that, well, maybe we should go.
[03:46:28.660 --> 03:46:30.660]  This is the guy that's got all the guns.
[03:46:30.660 --> 03:46:35.660]  We got to go to another restaurant or we're going to go, you know, not that we should be having.
[03:46:35.660 --> 03:46:39.660]  How fabulous would it be if there is no other restaurant because everybody follows suit.
[03:46:39.660 --> 03:46:40.660]  There you go.
[03:46:40.660 --> 03:46:47.660]  See, you could be starting a trend here and you don't even know when, you know, it started with a Facebook post that you posted on October 24th at 841 PM.
[03:46:47.660 --> 03:46:49.660]  So that was the night it happened.
[03:46:49.660 --> 03:46:51.660]  The 24th, yes.
[03:46:51.660 --> 03:46:54.660]  I always step into my biggest messes on Facebook.
[03:46:54.660 --> 03:46:56.660]  Everybody does it.
[03:46:56.660 --> 03:47:04.660]  But what you've done is actually raise awareness about guns and about the safety of guns and gun ownership, especially those who are concealed carry.
[03:47:04.660 --> 03:47:12.660]  Because I don't think a lot of people realize that, that how safe and the type of training that concealed carry owners go through to get that, the background checks, the fingerprinting.
[03:47:12.660 --> 03:47:16.660]  It's not a walk in the park by any means.
[03:47:16.660 --> 03:47:22.660]  It's not something you do just on a whim and the state just grants it to you on a whim.
[03:47:22.660 --> 03:47:29.660]  So, yeah, whereas the guy that was in Saturday night and wanted to threaten everybody, his was completely on a whim.
[03:47:29.660 --> 03:47:31.660]  Yeah, and he probably got it without a background check.
[03:47:31.660 --> 03:47:34.660]  You probably stole it from somebody and that's the thing about gun laws.
[03:47:34.660 --> 03:47:36.660]  You know, criminals don't follow gun laws.
[03:47:36.660 --> 03:47:39.660]  Obviously, you're not supposed to go rob a restaurant.
[03:47:39.660 --> 03:47:44.660]  He didn't care because he had a gun or at least he said, yeah, criminals don't follow the law.
[03:47:44.660 --> 03:47:50.660]  All this gun control does is impede law abiding citizens from being able to protect themselves in these kind of scenarios.
[03:47:50.660 --> 03:47:53.660]  Well, I don't know if you heard that piece that we put up before.
[03:47:53.660 --> 03:47:55.660]  It's, you know, kind of a gun grabber piece.
[03:47:55.660 --> 03:48:03.660]  We like to put up any time the gun grabbers rear their heads and Hillary was talking about how she wants to see a nationwide gun buyback program that kind of started it off.
[03:48:03.660 --> 03:48:07.660]  But we went, we cut to some stuff over the fourth of July weekend of there.
[03:48:07.660 --> 03:48:13.660]  It was just out of control shootings in Chicago and most of the people were felons getting out of prison.
[03:48:13.660 --> 03:48:17.660]  And so they were going to get guns and then they were, they were causing trouble.
[03:48:17.660 --> 03:48:19.660]  They weren't law abiding citizens shooting people.
[03:48:19.660 --> 03:48:21.660]  And, you know, that's where the disparity comes.
[03:48:21.660 --> 03:48:29.660]  Most of these people doing these gun crimes are already criminals or they have no reason to be running around with a gun unless it's to cause mayhem.
[03:48:29.660 --> 03:48:31.660]  So we salute you definitely.
[03:48:31.660 --> 03:48:33.660]  So you must be making that all up, right?
[03:48:33.660 --> 03:48:34.660]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:48:34.660 --> 03:48:40.660]  You know, I feel really bad for the people who do go into these gun free zones that bad stuff happens to them because, you know, they think they're
[03:48:40.660 --> 03:48:41.660]  Gun free zones are safe.
[03:48:41.660 --> 03:48:43.660]  Yeah, they think they're safe and effective.
[03:48:43.660 --> 03:48:46.660]  Give me an instance in the last 10 years where there's been a shooting at a gun free zone.
[03:48:46.660 --> 03:48:47.660]  Right.
[03:48:47.660 --> 03:48:49.660]  Obviously you can because it happens.
[03:48:49.660 --> 03:48:51.660]  It happens all the time.
[03:48:51.660 --> 03:48:56.660]  So yeah, I would step up the propaganda war a little bit more against that's my only advice to give you.
[03:48:56.660 --> 03:49:01.660]  I would put the number of concealed carry owners that have been in your restaurant the last few days.
[03:49:01.660 --> 03:49:08.660]  Put the stats out, put the targets up, let the criminals know who they're messing with because exactly.
[03:49:08.660 --> 03:49:11.660]  And I salute you for starting this debate and keeping it going.
[03:49:11.660 --> 03:49:12.660]  It really is good.
[03:49:12.660 --> 03:49:14.660]  You want to plug your restaurant again and where you're located?
[03:49:14.660 --> 03:49:16.660]  Well, it's Paparoo.
[03:49:16.660 --> 03:49:18.660]  We are Cajun food recipes from New Orleans.
[03:49:18.660 --> 03:49:23.660]  We're on the east side of Indianapolis, just a mile south of I 70.
[03:49:23.660 --> 03:49:31.660]  And if you come in, if it's still long enough for us to cook it and put it in bread, we're going to serve it to you on a pobo sandwich.
[03:49:31.660 --> 03:49:33.660]  So that sounds awesome.
[03:49:33.660 --> 03:49:35.660]  I wish I was living up near I 70 at this point.
[03:49:35.660 --> 03:49:39.660]  But if you're traveling through town, stop in, say you support what he's doing.
[03:49:39.660 --> 03:49:44.660]  You support gun rights and you commend him because that's what we at these times, this is what we all need to really stick together.
[03:49:44.660 --> 03:49:52.660]  Because if we don't, we will hang separately and they will come for our guns and make everybody a criminal that owns guns, which we shouldn't be having at this point.
[03:49:52.660 --> 03:49:55.660]  We need less gun laws so we can have more people owning guns.
[03:49:55.660 --> 03:49:56.660]  And then I think we'll have less crime.
[03:49:56.660 --> 03:49:57.660]  It's already going down.
[03:49:57.660 --> 03:49:59.660]  We need to have a mental issues as well.
[03:49:59.660 --> 03:50:00.660]  That's it.
[03:50:00.660 --> 03:50:01.660]  I think that's where it goes.
[03:50:01.660 --> 03:50:04.660]  And I'm sure the individual who broke into your restaurant was having mental issues.
[03:50:04.660 --> 03:50:06.660]  Thank you, Art, for coming on.
[03:50:06.660 --> 03:50:08.660]  If I may, before you let me go real quick.
[03:50:08.660 --> 03:50:15.660]  The one takeaway I had from the evening is my security footage was useless because my camera was a ceiling mount as is traditional.
[03:50:15.660 --> 03:50:20.660]  And the criminals have now communicated with each other to come in with the hoodies, with the beanies and look down.
[03:50:20.660 --> 03:50:21.660]  There it is.
[03:50:21.660 --> 03:50:24.660]  So Sunday I spent the whole day rewiring everything.
[03:50:24.660 --> 03:50:26.660]  All of my cameras are now right at eye level.
[03:50:26.660 --> 03:50:29.660]  And I recommend that all business owners do the same.
[03:50:29.660 --> 03:50:30.660]  There you go.
[03:50:30.660 --> 03:50:31.660]  Another great tip.
[03:50:31.660 --> 03:50:34.660]  Hopefully we've changed some lives here.
[03:50:34.660 --> 03:50:38.660]  Some business owners are going to think twice about not allowing guns on their premises.
[03:50:38.660 --> 03:50:41.660]  And I think that's the way to do it with the information more.
[03:50:41.660 --> 03:50:44.660]  And by putting out that message that, hey, people might be armed in here.
[03:50:44.660 --> 03:50:47.660]  You better think twice about breaking in and causing mayhem.
[03:50:47.660 --> 03:50:49.660]  Thanks for coming on the show, Art.
[03:50:49.660 --> 03:50:51.660]  And you can check out Papa Roo.
[03:50:51.660 --> 03:50:52.660]  Check him out on Yelp.
[03:50:52.660 --> 03:50:54.660]  And if you're in that area, go check him out and tell him you support him.
[03:50:54.660 --> 03:50:55.660]  This is Rob Do.
[03:50:55.660 --> 03:50:56.660]  We've got one more segment.
[03:50:56.660 --> 03:50:58.660]  David Knight's coming in to talk about what's coming up on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:50:58.660 --> 03:50:59.660]  You're watching the Fourth Hour.
[03:50:59.660 --> 03:51:01.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:51:29.660 --> 03:51:54.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:51:54.660 --> 03:52:20.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:52:20.660 --> 03:52:46.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:52:46.660 --> 03:53:15.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:53:15.660 --> 03:53:42.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:53:42.660 --> 03:54:04.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:54:04.660 --> 03:54:33.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:54:33.660 --> 03:55:00.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:55:00.660 --> 03:55:29.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:55:29.660 --> 03:55:55.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:55:55.660 --> 03:56:21.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:56:21.660 --> 03:56:47.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:56:47.660 --> 03:57:13.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:57:13.660 --> 03:57:39.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:57:39.660 --> 03:58:06.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:58:06.660 --> 03:58:35.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
[03:58:36.660 --> 03:59:05.660]  I'm a strong whisker.
