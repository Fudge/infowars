[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.880]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:28.720]  welcome to the alex jones show on this monday april 6 2015 i'm david night i'll be your host
[00:28.720 --> 00:36.000]  today and joining us in the second hour will be paul joseph watson talking about the amazing
[00:36.560 --> 00:43.200]  breaking story again we've had many times where the media has been caught in really huge lies we saw
[00:43.200 --> 00:47.760]  that happen with the mbc anchor now we're seeing this happening with the rolling stones about rape
[00:47.760 --> 00:51.360]  at the university so we're going to break that down in the second hour and talk about that but of
[00:51.360 --> 00:59.840]  course really breathing down all of our necks is the police state nothing we do seems to have any
[00:59.840 --> 01:04.320]  effect in terms of what we look at and we're going to look at what happened in kenya in light of
[01:04.320 --> 01:09.600]  that as well as another example of christian persecution and the media's silence on that we
[01:09.600 --> 01:16.560]  have an article on info wars dot com the post of the pope spoke out an easter message said that the
[01:16.560 --> 01:24.400]  world is complicit in silence on what happened in kenya because quite obviously that was strictly
[01:24.400 --> 01:30.080]  religiously based that was the xanist terrorists that were attacking christian students specifically
[01:30.080 --> 01:35.360]  looking for christian students so we're going to talk about that and and you need to understand as i
[01:35.360 --> 01:40.560]  noted on here you're not going to get any sympathy or protection from the government or from the
[01:40.560 --> 01:47.040]  press or from the world you need to be able to protect yourself especially if you're a hated
[01:47.040 --> 01:51.760]  minority and of course christians have become a hated minority throughout the world we're seeing
[01:51.760 --> 01:57.600]  more and more of that so you need to be able to protect yourself and nothing illustrates that better
[01:57.600 --> 02:03.760]  than what happened in kenya so we're going to talk about that why did this go on for seven hours
[02:03.760 --> 02:11.200]  before the government got any troops there is the answer to have even more police more troops i
[02:11.200 --> 02:17.280]  don't think so having more men with guns ruling over you does not make you any more free doesn't
[02:17.280 --> 02:22.560]  make you any more secure we haven't learned that lesson in america maybe from a distance we can get
[02:22.560 --> 02:27.360]  some insights into this if we look at the kenya situation as well of course there's an election
[02:27.360 --> 02:31.600]  coming up tomorrow we're going to talk a little bit about that that's in chicago raman manual is
[02:31.600 --> 02:36.880]  facing a runoff everybody was pretty surprised that he was going to be facing a runoff this is a
[02:36.880 --> 02:42.560]  cook county commissioner azus chui garcia is giving him a run for his money and guess what one of the
[02:42.560 --> 02:50.720]  key issues is there red light cameras now that may sound like something that's kind of a side issue
[02:50.720 --> 02:56.640]  but as one of the persons who's very angry about this hopping mad about this he's gotten more than
[02:56.640 --> 03:02.400]  this one individual says he's gotten more than a thousand dollars in red light camera tickets in
[03:02.400 --> 03:07.600]  chicago in chicago issues more heavily than anywhere else in the country but of course
[03:07.600 --> 03:13.600]  in chicago and of course it's policing for profit and whenever you've got either one of those two
[03:13.600 --> 03:18.480]  things you've also got corruption and that's also a part of the story there we have a story that's
[03:18.480 --> 03:23.920]  also breaking on info wars dot com bloody nanny state school bands running on the playground how
[03:23.920 --> 03:30.560]  many ways are they going to come after us and our children to make sure that we lock them in the
[03:30.560 --> 03:37.280]  house and never let them get outside playing outside playing in a playground walking home
[03:37.280 --> 03:44.000]  from just a short distance i mean come on i grew up not that long ago and i was able to play outside
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.720]  all that we used to have people that had large bells to call their kids home in the suburbs
[03:48.720 --> 03:53.200]  because it was dinner time otherwise the kids would be out playing freely but of course we
[03:53.200 --> 03:58.800]  can't have that today we have to be so afraid of everything and the government uses that fear
[03:59.440 --> 04:04.400]  to ratchet down the police state as i said we're going to talk about the amazing death toll not
[04:04.400 --> 04:13.520]  only in kenya but in america we've had a hundred people killed by the cops in march that's up
[04:13.520 --> 04:19.920]  from january and february we had 176 i think it was over those two months and then in march it goes
[04:19.920 --> 04:26.480]  up to 100 in just one month and of course that's more than the uk has had over a very long period
[04:26.480 --> 04:30.720]  of time we're going to break down the statistics for that and tell you what's behind it every day
[04:30.720 --> 04:36.160]  we see these stories and nothing seems to have any effect whether it's the nsa spying
[04:36.160 --> 04:40.160]  or whether it's police brutality that's out of control we can keep telling you these stories
[04:40.160 --> 04:46.000]  but it's like reagan's teflon presidency no matter how many scandals came out with iran contra or the
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.720]  crack cocaine epidemic nothing they could throw at him would stick and apparently the police state
[04:50.720 --> 04:53.040]  has gotten that way as well stay with us we're going to be right back

[08:23.520 --> 08:28.480]  welcome back to the alex jones show this monday april 6 2015 i'm david knight your host today
[08:28.480 --> 08:32.400]  we're going to be joined by paul joes of watson in the second hour we're going to talk about the
[08:32.400 --> 08:36.720]  journalistic issues that have been brought up the integrity issues that have been brought up with this
[08:36.720 --> 08:43.040]  story rolling stones magazine about the the fake rape situation there of course we also have a
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.720]  story that we'll talk to him about an info wars dot com top cop says insulting someone on facebook
[08:48.720 --> 08:55.200]  can get you arrested there you go they're watching everything you do and just to drive it home there's
[08:55.200 --> 09:01.920]  another story on info wars dot com bloody nanny state they say this is in the uk parents had
[09:01.920 --> 09:06.960]  their kids sent home and the parents were warned that their kids are running on the playground
[09:07.520 --> 09:10.800]  can't have kids running on a playground as a matter of fact we don't need the kids in the
[09:10.800 --> 09:15.920]  playground at all we just need to set them in front of a television set and pacify them
[09:15.920 --> 09:21.360]  so they'll be ready to be hooked up to the matrix and they can just set there and just
[09:21.360 --> 09:26.160]  generate heat i guess uh soil and green whatever kind of soil and green kind of form of electricity
[09:26.160 --> 09:32.240]  anyway from this story in the uk she says my son came on on friday and they banned running
[09:32.240 --> 09:38.080]  on the playground i thought i was going to react too much too quickly because kids sometimes get
[09:38.080 --> 09:42.960]  it wrong but she says that what they told them was well you know at first you'd really just need to
[09:42.960 --> 09:47.680]  kind of slow this down then she says you should talk to him longer it transpired that they had
[09:47.680 --> 09:53.840]  had banned running altogether they're not allowed to play british bulldog whatever that is uh they're
[09:53.840 --> 09:59.360]  not allowed to play football and of course the school says we are concerned for the safety of
[09:59.360 --> 10:04.640]  the children we need to stop this particular game until we can establish a safer way for them to play
[10:04.640 --> 10:11.200]  play some way that does not involve running because running is just too dangerous in the 21st
[10:11.200 --> 10:16.880]  century we all need to be pacified we all need to be afraid of our shadows we need to be afraid
[10:16.880 --> 10:21.280]  we can't have uh automobiles we can't have guns we can't have running we can't have our children
[10:21.280 --> 10:27.120]  outside we can't have them playing in a playground and if you don't buy into the nanny state we've
[10:27.120 --> 10:31.760]  got a police state we're going to shove down your throat and i guess that's one of the things i look
[10:31.760 --> 10:40.160]  at the situation in kenya where 148 people were killed 70 i guess it was 79 were initially wounded
[10:40.160 --> 10:46.640]  there was 147 that were killed i guess maybe now it's 148 78 one of those people has has died after
[10:46.640 --> 10:55.360]  that last tally in the easter message the pope said that there is a complicit silence in this attack
[10:55.360 --> 11:02.640]  because it was focused on christians they went in and they deliberately singled out christians this
[11:02.640 --> 11:09.680]  group el shavab and of course that's true and we need to understand that uh we're not going to get
[11:09.680 --> 11:14.640]  sympathy from the press we're not going to get sympathy from the government we're not going
[11:14.640 --> 11:21.840]  to get protection from the government something that underscores that is a daily mail as they said
[11:21.840 --> 11:26.800]  the government came back with responded to the fact that it took them seven hours to arrive at the
[11:26.800 --> 11:31.840]  scene interestingly if they point out of the bullet points a daily mail at the top here said
[11:31.840 --> 11:35.520]  journalists arrived at the university before the troops did and the troops flew in by air
[11:36.320 --> 11:41.120]  so the journalists can get there before the army can get there that's uh that's a great response
[11:41.120 --> 11:46.640]  time seven hours but of course they defended themselves by using a football analogy and they
[11:46.640 --> 11:51.840]  said well you know uh football meaning soccer to americans they say you know whenever you're
[11:51.840 --> 11:57.520]  fighting terrorism it's kind of like a being a goalie uh they only remember the ones that you
[11:57.520 --> 12:04.560]  missed well they missed this one by a mile and it was the same group the same country el shavab
[12:04.560 --> 12:11.200]  in kinja that had previously killed it was i think 67 people in a mall something like that and as
[12:11.200 --> 12:16.320]  alex when he talked about it last week he pointed out because there was one guy with a gun who was
[12:16.320 --> 12:22.480]  a foreign national there he stopped that earlier than it would have and of course that went on for
[12:22.480 --> 12:28.000]  several days that siege this went on for several hours and it was only uh i think well they got
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.080]  four guys i think they're looking for another five suspects so i don't know maybe four to nine
[12:32.080 --> 12:37.200]  people that could kill that many people injure that many people in that amount of time because
[12:37.200 --> 12:43.520]  nobody there has any weapons to defend themselves that is one of the key things and of course we've
[12:43.520 --> 12:48.080]  had the uh fellow from inner poll pointed that out with the first attack in kinja he said this
[12:48.080 --> 12:52.480]  wouldn't happen in texas where people are armed it wouldn't go this long it wouldn't have gone for
[12:52.480 --> 12:57.600]  days or it wouldn't have gone for seven hours without somebody being able to defend themselves
[12:57.600 --> 13:03.120]  when you read the accounts of this you had people said we didn't know where to go we were afraid we
[13:03.120 --> 13:07.520]  had to run some of them ran at the gunman not knowing it had to run past the gunman to get
[13:07.520 --> 13:14.400]  out of there they were rounding christians up killing them so what are we going to do are we
[13:14.400 --> 13:20.000]  going to just depend on the government to take care of us are we going to look as kinja did to
[13:20.000 --> 13:25.920]  hiring more police who will protect us that's not the way it works out in the united states
[13:25.920 --> 13:31.360]  certainly doesn't we see that uh just in this election that's coming up tomorrow that i mentioned
[13:31.360 --> 13:37.040]  in the last uh in the last break there's a election in chicago rami manual has been forced
[13:37.040 --> 13:43.040]  into a runoff nobody expected to see that coming but people are pretty fed up with the corruption
[13:43.040 --> 13:47.680]  in chicago with a lot of things in chicago and one of the things that they're most fed up with
[13:47.680 --> 13:52.320]  are the red light cameras this is an article from us a today red light cameras create red hot
[13:52.320 --> 13:58.240]  furor in chicago they say chicago has the most expansive use of red light cameras in the country
[13:58.240 --> 14:03.920]  and the public is furious i said nearly three out of four chicagoans want a manual to eliminate
[14:03.920 --> 14:10.720]  or reduce the use of these red light cameras and of course his opponent is quick to pick up on this
[14:11.360 --> 14:17.600]  it's a cook county commissioner asus chui garcia who is in the runoff with him and he calls it the
[14:17.600 --> 14:24.320]  red light ripoff and it is a ripoff he's made the issue a central part of his campaign to get
[14:24.320 --> 14:30.640]  elected that's great i wish we could get people who would stand up and take down some of these
[14:30.640 --> 14:36.400]  things that are being used to oppress us everywhere and that's the way the police are being used
[14:36.400 --> 14:41.600]  not just in chicago i mean they're not even using police for this what this illustrates is that time
[14:41.600 --> 14:44.880]  and again when they come after us and they say they're doing this for our safety whether it's
[14:44.880 --> 14:50.160]  banning kids on the playground or whether it's putting red light cameras to harass people to
[14:50.160 --> 14:57.760]  find them it's not about safety it's about their power and it's about their revenue we saw this
[14:57.760 --> 15:04.160]  happen in new york eric garner and i think we need to spend time talking about the real cases
[15:04.160 --> 15:11.040]  like eric garner or the homeless people who are killed by the police not the michael brown cases
[15:11.040 --> 15:17.360]  we pointed out that case was ambiguous at best to begin with it was infuriating i think to the
[15:17.360 --> 15:22.000]  people that they would leave his body in the street for many many hours i think that's really
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.960]  the source of the anger but the actual event was pretty ambiguous and as they looked at it it looked
[15:26.960 --> 15:32.880]  like there was a struggle for the gun it looked like he was going back to the officer we don't need
[15:32.880 --> 15:39.280]  to try to focus on that issue there's plenty of issues out there where there is unrestrained
[15:39.280 --> 15:45.040]  unjustified clearly clearly unjustified no question about it attacks on individuals homeless
[15:45.040 --> 15:50.880]  people or in the case of eric garner a man who was simply accused of not having paid attacks
[15:50.880 --> 15:58.480]  and he didn't believe that was the case that day apparently uh in his what he said was that he
[15:58.480 --> 16:03.520]  wasn't doing that today you're just busting me again and got into a verbal argument with him
[16:03.520 --> 16:09.760]  and they killed him for that and when the mayor did not stand behind the police on that because
[16:09.760 --> 16:15.200]  that all boiled down to petty revenue concerns when they didn't stand on that the police did a
[16:15.200 --> 16:20.160]  strike they said we're not going to arrest or find people unless it's absolutely necessary guess what
[16:20.160 --> 16:25.520]  they admitted by their own actions 95% of what they did was not necessary it was just to get
[16:25.520 --> 16:29.920]  revenue and that's what we see happening in chicago and it's not only that but of course
[16:29.920 --> 16:36.160]  it's always about the money and this red light camera situation also involves a bribery scandal
[16:37.120 --> 16:43.040]  involving top city transportation officials and executives from the city's former red light
[16:43.040 --> 16:49.360]  camera vendor that's from usa today one of the residents mark wallace says it's been exposed
[16:49.360 --> 16:54.160]  for what it really is and he's been hit with more than a thousand dollars in red light camera
[16:54.160 --> 17:00.240]  tickets he says it's nothing more than a way for the city of chicago to create a slush fund
[17:00.240 --> 17:06.800]  that brings in a lot of revenue well red light cameras are just one way they do that of course
[17:06.800 --> 17:14.000]  the big way that they do it is with civil asset forfeiture they justified this back in the beginnings
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.080]  of the war on drugs back in the 1970s saying they're going to go after organized crime so we
[17:18.080 --> 17:22.480]  need to have rico statutes that allow us to confiscate property before we've convicted
[17:22.480 --> 17:26.880]  anybody because you know these guys who in organized crime they've got such so much money
[17:26.880 --> 17:30.400]  they've got such great lawyers we can't get a conviction the only way we're going to convict
[17:30.400 --> 17:34.800]  these guys and we know they're all guilty is to take all their money first and then when they've
[17:34.800 --> 17:39.680]  got a public defender we can throw them in jail people said fine sure yeah let's get these guys
[17:39.680 --> 17:45.040]  in organized crime let's get these terrorists let's get these drug dealers well when you allow them
[17:45.040 --> 17:52.000]  to break the important fundamental principle that you don't take confiscate property from people
[17:52.560 --> 17:58.480]  unless and until you have convicted them once that's gone there is no such thing as
[17:58.480 --> 18:03.120]  private property rights anymore in america and we're going to talk about that in detail
[18:03.120 --> 18:08.800]  ran paul looks like he's going to announce his candidacy tomorrow he had a great speech at
[18:08.800 --> 18:15.200]  i think it was buoy state university it's predominantly black university it was covered on c-span
[18:15.200 --> 18:21.680]  and he had some great things to say about civil asset forfeiture and of course ran paul has also
[18:21.680 --> 18:29.280]  been moving towards the warmongering faction of the gop troubles many of us who are very happy
[18:29.280 --> 18:35.280]  with what he said is libertarian i don't think you can make peace with these warmongers i don't
[18:35.280 --> 18:40.480]  think that uh they're going to necessarily fall for that i hope he hasn't changed but he has a lot
[18:40.480 --> 18:46.080]  of things that he has brought to the discussion and the national discussion that are very very
[18:46.080 --> 18:49.760]  important so we're going to talk about civil asset forfeiture because it's more than just the
[18:49.760 --> 18:55.840]  presidential race this is something that is being fought at the state level there's more than 20
[18:55.840 --> 19:02.880]  states that have bills before them to stop civil asset forfeiture and you need to understand what's
[19:02.880 --> 19:06.400]  behind that how corrupt that is so we're going to talk about that in the next segment i want to
[19:06.400 --> 19:12.160]  continue on with uh some news here before we get to that we've got a indianapolis gun store
[19:12.160 --> 19:17.600]  that is suing the atf for keeping recovered firearms this is a guy in indianapolis uh
[19:17.600 --> 19:20.960]  this is a handwritten complaint from a guy he doesn't have a lot of money he's also launched
[19:20.960 --> 19:25.600]  a go fund me campaign to raise $10,000 so he can fight this in court but here's what happened
[19:25.600 --> 19:33.360]  andrew hall owner of pro fire arms and supplies says the batf will not return the firearms that
[19:33.360 --> 19:39.600]  they took from a robbery suspect this is a guy who specializes in machine guns and silencers
[19:39.600 --> 19:44.880]  ammunition he was robbed and they got the merchandise from the guy who robbed him they
[19:44.880 --> 19:48.960]  refused to give it back and they're not even charging that guy for the theft because they're
[19:48.960 --> 19:56.880]  the thieves and we're going to talk about civil asset forfeiture when we come back stay with us

[24:20.720 --> 24:27.760]  that he's got up on info wars is a top cop says that insulting someone on facebook you can get
[24:27.760 --> 24:35.040]  arrested now this is uh the top cop is the person who is head of the virginia paternal order of
[24:35.040 --> 24:41.920]  police and this is the second time we've seen something like this in virginia this is a 26-year-old
[24:41.920 --> 24:46.320]  christin holmes got into a facebook argument with someone who didn't know who she was as
[24:46.320 --> 24:50.880]  mistaken identity so she posted an image of herself pointing a gun at the camera along with the words
[24:50.880 --> 24:56.640]  i'll post a few actual pics of me so you know the difference when you come to find me now she says
[24:56.640 --> 25:00.640]  it wasn't a threat she says it was just a funny picture she said what happened to freedom of speech
[25:00.640 --> 25:06.880]  well i'll tell you what happened to freedom of speech uh we have a nanny state and they did not
[25:06.880 --> 25:13.680]  back down now they're looking at putting her in jail up to one year in prison and or a $2,500
[25:13.680 --> 25:19.600]  fine a class one misdemeanor they said i'm not sure what the crime is i don't see here nevertheless
[25:19.600 --> 25:25.040]  it's a class one misdemeanor the top cop at the virginia paternal order police says free speech
[25:25.040 --> 25:32.320]  doesn't say you have the right to insult somebody wow you can't insult people on facebook or youtube
[25:32.320 --> 25:36.400]  there's going to be a lot of people going to jail we might be able to fill the gels up even faster
[25:36.400 --> 25:43.280]  than we do with the war on drugs hey i think they found a new way to push the prison industrial complex
[25:43.920 --> 25:47.840]  of course they point out the other time this happened was something like this is very egregious
[25:47.840 --> 25:55.360]  even more so was in 2012 we had brandon robb if you remember he was an iraq afghanistan vet
[25:55.360 --> 26:01.040]  and he was um posting on facebook stories that questioned he was questioning the official story
[26:01.040 --> 26:05.360]  of 9 11 uh and talking about corruption of the u.s government they might have been talking about
[26:05.360 --> 26:10.720]  how the fbi is running all of these terrorist attacks pretty much either they know that they're
[26:10.720 --> 26:16.080]  going to happen allow them to happen were many cases as uh judge napolitano has pointed out
[26:16.080 --> 26:21.760]  they will actually facilitate it they'll find some patsy they'll move with them uh train them give
[26:21.760 --> 26:26.560]  them transportation if they don't have it we just saw that happen uh everything that they need in
[26:26.560 --> 26:30.640]  order to carry out a terrorist attack so they can stop it at the last minute and portray themselves
[26:30.640 --> 26:35.600]  as heroes so he said the fbi was terrorist in nature what they did was they picked him up
[26:35.600 --> 26:42.000]  and put him in a psychiatric ward because he said that on facebook now as i pointed out earlier
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.280]  we have this story that's up on info wars dot com truly amazing story the nanny state in england
[26:47.280 --> 26:52.640]  where you've got schools banning running on the playground can't play football can't do any of
[26:52.640 --> 26:57.760]  this stuff because you know running is really really dangerous and as i said what they really
[26:57.760 --> 27:06.160]  want to do is just lock our kids down and keep them inside and uh you know that's none of us get
[27:06.160 --> 27:11.040]  outside enough and that's one of the things i looked at this is like man i used to be able to
[27:11.680 --> 27:16.080]  go anywhere i wanted to after school i would have like three or four hours i could ride my bike do
[27:16.080 --> 27:22.640]  anything i wanted to when i was a kid not today not today you're going to go sit inside and watch
[27:22.640 --> 27:28.640]  television or maybe get on facebook so they can start building a dossier on you and start profiling
[27:28.640 --> 27:34.800]  you socially to see if you are a threat to the government it's also a very unhealthy thing if
[27:34.800 --> 27:39.280]  you don't get any sunlight and of course uh one of the products that we've just come out with is
[27:39.280 --> 27:46.560]  winter sun vitamin d3 it's a nutraceutical quality vitamin d3 it's not the synthetic d2 that you see
[27:46.560 --> 27:51.440]  all the time and of course um with this it's a pretty high dose that you get with 10 drops you
[27:51.440 --> 27:58.560]  get 2000 international units with each one of these uh with each dosage it's a bio available
[27:58.560 --> 28:04.400]  form of d3 from nutrient dense lichen that's not synthetic and again that's available at info wars
[28:04.400 --> 28:09.520]  life dot com it's info wars life dot com one of the products that we sell their winter sun
[28:09.520 --> 28:15.440]  vitamin d3 because even though the winter is over most people are not getting outside in the sun
[28:15.440 --> 28:21.440]  and that's one of the things that you need to produce that essential vitamin now they're getting
[28:21.440 --> 28:27.440]  a lot of sun however in california their governor gary brown is now telling californians that they're
[28:27.440 --> 28:34.560]  going to be heavily fined if they take long showers you know california already reeks of
[28:34.560 --> 28:39.440]  socialism as my son lance said when he saw this and i think it's going to get a lot worse yet
[28:39.440 --> 28:44.880]  another thing that they can come after people for uh and interestingly enough is of course it's not
[28:44.880 --> 28:48.480]  just the socialist and yes they do have a water problem there and there's a lot of things we
[28:48.480 --> 28:54.400]  could talk about that's behind that i don't think that it is uh evidence of global warming as jerry
[28:54.400 --> 28:59.040]  brown is trying to make uh the case for that we've seen uh if you just want to objectively look at
[28:59.040 --> 29:04.720]  the temperatures and not do it from uh airport tarmac's but do it from a satellite you will see
[29:04.720 --> 29:11.520]  that their models are not working their models are not uh the increases in co2 are not producing
[29:11.520 --> 29:15.760]  the kinds of increases in temperature that they said that we would see that is not happening
[29:15.760 --> 29:22.640]  nevertheless they're going to find some way to uh get money out of people we come back i want to
[29:22.640 --> 29:27.760]  spend some time talking about civil asset forfeiture and i'm going to play some clips uh of what
[29:27.760 --> 29:33.120]  ram paul had to say about this because he really hits the nail on the head stay with us we'll be
[29:33.120 --> 29:45.600]  right back after break

[33:31.280 --> 33:36.000]  next hour paul joseph watson from the uk i was just talking about the last segment today he's
[33:36.000 --> 33:41.760]  got a article up about a cop in virginia actually the head of the fraternal order of police in
[33:41.760 --> 33:46.800]  virginia saying hey yeah we can arrest you if we don't like what you post on facebook we had an
[33:46.800 --> 33:53.680]  article earlier this weekend feinstein demands internet censorship after the fbi uncovers its own
[33:53.680 --> 34:01.520]  bomb plot as just as i said they locked up brandon robb uh in 2012 because they said that he had
[34:01.520 --> 34:06.240]  referred to the fbi as a terrorist organization of course they have been involved in virtually every
[34:06.240 --> 34:11.440]  terrorist threat that has happened here either running it or letting it run so that they can
[34:11.440 --> 34:16.720]  make themselves heroes now they're doing it in terms of finding some literature and arresting
[34:16.720 --> 34:22.240]  somebody there as kit daniels points out after the fbi uncovered another one of itself orchestrated
[34:22.240 --> 34:27.760]  terror plots leading to the arrest of two women senator feinstein demanded online censorship
[34:27.760 --> 34:33.120]  of extremist literature well right now the way they're defining that is the anarchist cookbook
[34:33.120 --> 34:39.040]  which has been around for a very long time as well as a publication from al qaeda and as people
[34:39.040 --> 34:45.200]  are pointing out this is what you have in china but of course our government wants what the chinese
[34:45.200 --> 34:49.760]  people have it was george bush that said well i wish uh we wish we could do things like we do
[34:49.760 --> 34:54.800]  in china that's easy you know when you can just throw people in jail uh they point out and this
[34:54.800 --> 34:58.800]  is a quote from the dean of journalism at the university of maryland lucy dalglish she says
[34:59.520 --> 35:04.560]  that this is a blatant violation of the first amendment to demand that they're going to take
[35:04.560 --> 35:11.520]  these things down uh as a person with tech dirt uh wrote mike masnick said the anarchist cookbook
[35:11.520 --> 35:15.680]  is very much protected by the first amendment whether you like it or not while the book is
[35:15.680 --> 35:19.840]  banned in other countries who don't have the equivalent of the first amendment it is perfectly
[35:19.840 --> 35:25.760]  legal in the us but of course we only get to keep our rights if we understand what those
[35:25.760 --> 35:30.960]  rights are if we understand how they're being taken away many people just refuse to believe
[35:30.960 --> 35:36.880]  that our government could do the kinds of things that it's doing one of those stories is
[35:36.880 --> 35:42.560]  something i saw on world net daily about a female attorney who was strapped up in court
[35:42.560 --> 35:48.400]  listen to this story this is a divorced lawyer she was detained a lawyer who was detained and
[35:48.400 --> 35:54.560]  forced to represent her client uh restrained in a wheelchair and tortured with sexual humiliation
[35:54.560 --> 36:01.920]  sleep deprivation sensory deprivation without being charged this is a new civil rights lawsuit
[36:01.920 --> 36:07.440]  this is in minnesota now the interesting thing about this is that she had asked the judge in
[36:07.440 --> 36:13.600]  this divorce case to recuse himself and he refused to do that that apparently created some kind of
[36:13.600 --> 36:19.120]  a conflict to them and uh but this is what i thought was interesting beyond the details of the case
[36:19.840 --> 36:23.040]  when she talked to the lawyers she got a couple lawyers who were representing her one of them
[36:23.040 --> 36:28.000]  is nathan bush and he said uh that the claim was so extreme that initially he didn't believe her
[36:28.720 --> 36:36.640]  see that's the problem the tyranny the abuse of justice whether it's uh by the police or
[36:36.640 --> 36:43.920]  whether it's by our judges is so over the top has gotten so bad so quickly people simply
[36:43.920 --> 36:48.240]  refused to believe that it's an issue and that's the key thing we're going to talk about was civil
[36:48.240 --> 36:54.160]  asset forfeiture most of you won't believe that this could really happen in america but going
[36:54.160 --> 36:58.080]  back to this case he says this is the first time i'd heard of such a case like this at her attorney
[36:58.080 --> 37:04.560]  this is the united states things like this don't happen here but then he goes on to say she's not
[37:04.560 --> 37:11.360]  lying the woman is telling the truth yeah unfortunately she is and unfortunately this is the
[37:11.360 --> 37:16.000]  kind of country that we're starting to live in now i want to talk to you about what's going on
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.560]  in the war on private property especially because some of the people who are pushing this the hardest
[37:20.560 --> 37:28.000]  are the ones who ought to know better republicans now the republican base understands and values
[37:28.000 --> 37:34.960]  property rights as much as anything perhaps more than they value many other rights we all
[37:34.960 --> 37:39.600]  understand that they're all about property rights not so much the republicans at the top though
[37:39.600 --> 37:45.360]  and they are using the war on drugs and they're using other things like terrorism whatever they're
[37:45.360 --> 37:51.680]  using these things and using the conflict that these mainstream republicans these grass roots
[37:51.680 --> 37:56.720]  republicans have this conflict that they have between supporting law enforcement reflexively
[37:56.720 --> 38:03.120]  sleuthing it no matter what it does no matter how abusive it is and yet taking away their property
[38:03.120 --> 38:10.560]  their property rights at the same time see i don't use drugs i've never used drugs i got into this
[38:11.280 --> 38:15.040]  war on drugs they made me angry about it because i could see what was happening
[38:15.040 --> 38:20.000]  20 years ago with property i could see what was happening with the abuse and the destruction of
[38:20.000 --> 38:26.400]  the justice system i could see that they were sending people to jail ruining their lives and
[38:26.400 --> 38:33.200]  then sending me the bill to pay to keep them incarcerated so long before i got involved with
[38:33.200 --> 38:38.800]  had any compassion for the people as a as a republican in the early days i was still concerned
[38:38.800 --> 38:44.080]  about the money that was being wasted so maybe this will appeal to you from that standpoint okay
[38:44.080 --> 38:47.840]  and then maybe you can get some compassion for what the people are going through maybe you
[38:47.840 --> 38:52.480]  can understand that this has headed your way as well just as pastor martin neymar said about
[38:52.480 --> 38:56.720]  what was going on in nazi germany first they came for that group i did nothing because
[38:56.720 --> 38:59.920]  it wasn't a part of that group and then another than another i wasn't a part of those groups
[38:59.920 --> 39:04.720]  then they came for me and there was no one to help me because i hadn't helped anyone when
[39:04.720 --> 39:11.120]  they were coming after them now here's the issue in a nutshell this is uh something that's put up
[39:11.120 --> 39:16.080]  by the institute of justice and of course the institute of justice and the aclu on the right
[39:16.080 --> 39:21.120]  and on the left we've got groups that understand how fundamentally destructive civil asset forfeiture
[39:21.120 --> 39:25.280]  is they've come out talking about this so you've got people on both the left and right let me
[39:25.280 --> 39:29.680]  break this down for you they point out here just in talking about philadelphia it just is one case
[39:30.640 --> 39:37.040]  they say the most terrifying place in philadelphia's courtroom 478 in city hall this is where property
[39:37.040 --> 39:42.640]  owners enter philadelphia's civil forfeiture machine it's a little known legal device that allows
[39:42.640 --> 39:47.440]  law enforcement officials to take your property sell it and profit pocket the proceeds even if
[39:47.440 --> 39:52.480]  you've done nothing wrong and to give you an example they have what their their take has been in
[39:52.480 --> 40:00.400]  philadelphia from 2002 to 2010 10 years 64 million dollars in forfeiture about six million six and
[40:00.400 --> 40:06.720]  a half million a year they say the district attorney's office used over 25 million of that 64 million
[40:06.720 --> 40:13.040]  to pay salaries see there's a conflict a basic conflict of interest and i want you to hear what
[40:13.040 --> 40:18.240]  rand paul said when he talked to uh bush state university and started explaining to them civil
[40:18.240 --> 40:24.640]  asset forfeiture here's a clip from that one of the laws that bothers me the most is something
[40:24.640 --> 40:29.600]  called civil forfeiture civil forfeiture is whether the government can take your stuff
[40:30.160 --> 40:36.560]  whether they've convicted you of a crime or not i think this turns justice on its head so i think
[40:36.560 --> 40:42.960]  that most of our judicial system for most of who believe in it is that you're innocent until proven
[40:42.960 --> 40:51.040]  guilty civil forfeiture does the opposite but a novel idea using the constitution and if there's
[40:51.040 --> 40:58.000]  one thing i can change i want to reinforce that in a judicial system you are innocent until proven
[40:58.000 --> 41:03.680]  guilty the problem is is it was civil forfeiture it's the opposite so i'll give you a couple of
[41:03.680 --> 41:11.520]  examples christos sorvelos is a family uh in philadelphia their teenage son sold 40 dollars
[41:11.520 --> 41:17.440]  worth of illegal drugs off the back porch the government took their house evicted them and
[41:17.440 --> 41:23.120]  barricaded them it was like how are we making anything better when we take the house maybe the
[41:23.120 --> 41:28.400]  house is a stabilizing force in the family maybe it's grandma's house and kids 15 years old why
[41:28.400 --> 41:35.840]  would we take grandma's house why would we take the family's house and not even and not even a
[41:35.840 --> 41:42.000]  conviction on an accusation of the child who doesn't own the house it's way out of control and it's
[41:42.000 --> 41:47.360]  happening in various venues but if you look at it the washington post has done a great series on this
[41:47.360 --> 41:54.080]  over the last uh six months or so it's predominantly african-american it's predominantly hispanic or
[41:54.080 --> 41:59.760]  if you want to see one common denominator it's predominantly people who live in poverty it's
[41:59.760 --> 42:05.200]  unfair and it ought to stop i think we can stop it this is something that the president and i
[42:05.200 --> 42:10.880]  completely agree on so we have legislation that would change it changes the presumption it says
[42:10.880 --> 42:15.680]  that you will be innocent until they prove you guilty and they cannot take your stuff unless
[42:15.680 --> 42:20.640]  you've been proven guilty give an example of some of the things in civil forfeiture that we've had
[42:20.640 --> 42:30.000]  problem with in civil forfeiture they took a 1.5 million dollar uh motel in new jersey why because
[42:30.000 --> 42:37.440]  about 10 people had stayed there over 14 years who have been caught selling drugs 10 people out of 200
[42:37.440 --> 42:43.280]  thousand people and they took the hotel in lean when they look at it there's a program where the
[42:43.280 --> 42:48.480]  people who take your stuff get to keep it and they get to keep the proceeds so there's a perverse
[42:48.480 --> 42:53.920]  incentive for the government to want to take your stuff interestingly about the same amount of people
[42:53.920 --> 42:59.040]  caught for drugs in other hotels in the same area but they didn't take them because they had leans
[42:59.040 --> 43:03.760]  against the hotel this hotel happened to be paid for so the government actually looks for things
[43:03.760 --> 43:11.200]  that they can confiscate that are already paid for very important to understand the profit motive
[43:11.200 --> 43:18.400]  in this just as they pointed out in philadelphia they're paying about 25 million dollars towards
[43:18.400 --> 43:25.040]  the district attorney's staff salary out of what they have stolen and so there's a lot of efforts
[43:25.040 --> 43:31.120]  to try to push back against this now ram paul has worked with some uh democrats in terms of trying to
[43:31.840 --> 43:37.040]  stop this understand that this is a violation of pretty much every one of the bill of rights
[43:37.840 --> 43:43.120]  it really is it doesn't violate the first amendment it doesn't violate the second amendment and it
[43:43.120 --> 43:46.720]  doesn't have anything to do with quartering troops but if you go through the rest of the
[43:46.720 --> 43:52.640]  amendments in terms of uh search and seizure in terms of excessive fines in terms of due process
[43:52.640 --> 43:58.400]  in terms of having a trial by jury in terms of rights that are reserved to the people that are
[43:58.400 --> 44:03.920]  not turned over to the state it's pretty much four through ten that they violate with civil asset
[44:03.920 --> 44:09.680]  forfeiture so there's a push that is being led essentially by ram paul and a couple of others
[44:09.680 --> 44:17.440]  to try to say we're going to establish these this novel idea for the 21st century one that we understood
[44:17.440 --> 44:23.760]  for the last uh six seven eight hundred years the idea of innocent until proven guilty the idea
[44:23.760 --> 44:29.920]  that you have a day in court the idea that you don't have your property taken unless you are found
[44:29.920 --> 44:35.200]  guilty the idea that you are not going to hit be hit with disproportionately high penalties
[44:35.920 --> 44:42.400]  and then of course the idea that the government itself can't act as robbers now that particular
[44:42.400 --> 44:48.160]  case he's talking about that involved the uh carmen uh ortees who's the uh federal district
[44:48.160 --> 44:52.720]  attorney in that area new jersey massachusetts so she was also involved in the erin schwarz case
[44:53.680 --> 44:58.640]  and would bring that and that case at the hotel where they took that hotel tried to take that
[44:58.640 --> 45:04.720]  hotel because 15 over 15 years 14 people had been involved in drug arrests there
[45:05.680 --> 45:10.960]  they said and everybody knows and this is how it works there was nothing that involved anybody
[45:10.960 --> 45:15.440]  that had an ownership in the hotel and they singled out that hotel as ran paul pointed out
[45:15.440 --> 45:22.160]  because it was owned free and clear this is simply the government going through and looking for
[45:22.160 --> 45:27.920]  property that they can steal it's going to stop and it's going to stop though i think at the state
[45:27.920 --> 45:32.240]  level because when you look at what's going on with the feds other than ran paul and a couple
[45:32.240 --> 45:38.160]  of other people they're all down with this they like this a lot this gives them a lot of power a
[45:38.160 --> 45:42.560]  lot of money the federal attorneys like it the congressman and the senators for the most part
[45:42.560 --> 45:47.840]  like it and we're going to find out that the governors for the most part like it as well
[45:47.840 --> 45:52.320]  new mexico we've got both parties i mentioned that the aclu as well as the institute of justice
[45:53.120 --> 45:59.920]  left and right uh legal representation they both understand how fundamentally destructive
[45:59.920 --> 46:03.760]  destructive this is of our rights and they've come out against it we have the same thing
[46:03.760 --> 46:09.120]  happening in new mexico look at this the new mexico legislature unanimously passed a landmark
[46:09.120 --> 46:14.640]  bill to limit civil asset forfeiture now understand that in new mexico i i think it's uh i don't
[46:14.640 --> 46:19.600]  remember if it's the senate or the house one of them is predominantly democrat the other one is
[46:19.600 --> 46:25.600]  predominantly republican but they both said unanimously they want to get rid of civil asset
[46:25.600 --> 46:29.440]  forfeiture and they're going to do things like make sure that you've got to have a criminal
[46:29.440 --> 46:34.240]  conviction before property could be forfeited once the conviction is one the state would have to
[46:34.240 --> 46:40.000]  prove that the property is directly traceable to an instrumental in committing the crime you're not
[46:40.000 --> 46:45.520]  going to be able to just charge the learjet with having transported somebody who was doing a drug
[46:45.520 --> 46:50.720]  deal or charge the hotel because somebody was there doing a drug deal and not charge the owner
[46:50.720 --> 46:55.920]  of the hotel not charge the owner of the plane they would have to prove by clear and convincing
[46:55.920 --> 47:00.000]  evidence that an owner had actual knowledge that the property was going to be used to commit the
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.960]  crime and they would also make sure that when the money when there was actually a forfeiture
[47:04.960 --> 47:10.960]  after a conviction after uh they go through a due process that that money would not be turned over
[47:10.960 --> 47:16.080]  to the cops it would not incentivize them to steal people's money it would not be turned over to the
[47:16.080 --> 47:21.520]  local district attorney no it would go to the state general fund so you take out that conflict
[47:21.520 --> 47:26.240]  of interest and of course they're not the only state new mexico isn't we had minnesota passed a
[47:26.240 --> 47:31.920]  forfeiture law last year uh maryland house of delegates voted to do the same we have 20 states
[47:31.920 --> 47:36.640]  that are looking at it this year now here's a situation in new mexico as i pointed out democrats
[47:36.640 --> 47:41.440]  and republicans unanimously and the legislature said we want to stop this we want to get back
[47:41.440 --> 47:46.880]  to living in a country where we have a rule of law instead of theft by law enforcement
[47:46.880 --> 47:53.280]  but the governor there the republican governor susanna martinez has been setting on this now for
[47:53.280 --> 47:57.680]  a couple of weeks as freedom works points out the window to protect the private property
[47:57.680 --> 48:03.520]  and new mexico is rapidly closing it's been two weeks since they did this bill by april the
[48:03.520 --> 48:09.280]  ninth which is this week that's uh what is that thursday i think it's thursday if she doesn't sign
[48:09.280 --> 48:14.800]  this bill or veto it by the ninth she'll get a pocket veto it'll just automatically vetoed on
[48:14.800 --> 48:21.600]  april the tenth now to understand where this is coming from we need to understand that her
[48:22.240 --> 48:29.120]  chief of staff who really didn't have anything uh to say about it is a former prosecutor as
[48:29.120 --> 48:34.800]  is the governor of wyoming who vetoed a similar bill that was passed by the legislature there
[48:34.800 --> 48:42.320]  to stop asset forfeiture he is a former federal attorney for the area so this is a guy who was
[48:42.320 --> 48:48.000]  a fed and let me also point out that these guys who are governors these republican governors who
[48:48.000 --> 48:54.800]  want to continue this lawlessness who want to continue to stand behind destruction of private
[48:54.800 --> 48:58.480]  property rights and let me tell you there is nothing that is more destructive of private
[48:58.480 --> 49:03.920]  property rights than if the police can with any pretext come and confiscate your property
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.640]  as ram paul pointed out he had a guy a kid teenage kid selling drugs to an undercover
[49:08.640 --> 49:14.160]  agent on the back porch of their house a $40 drug deal for that they took the parents home
[49:15.440 --> 49:21.280]  no no uh not pretending that the parents had any knowledge of this or that they
[49:21.280 --> 49:25.680]  had any involvement in this whatsoever not getting a conviction just taking their home
[49:25.680 --> 49:30.640]  but of course it's been worse than that in some cases they've confiscated cars because a teenage
[49:30.640 --> 49:36.240]  son was in a car with a bunch of other teenagers and they found a joint on one of the other
[49:36.240 --> 49:42.800]  teenagers take the entire car see that's the kind of jeopardy you're going to live in if you
[49:42.800 --> 49:47.600]  allow them to do this and most of the justification is on the war of drugs but not entirely this is
[49:47.600 --> 49:52.480]  what the governor the republican governor who vetoed it in wyoming said they former federal
[49:52.480 --> 49:58.880]  prosecutor he says i think civil asset forfeiture is a legitimate tool to help in the areas not
[49:58.880 --> 50:04.000]  limited to not limited to but particularly with drug crimes see they use the war on drugs to
[50:04.000 --> 50:09.200]  destroy our legal system but it is not limited to that they're going to branch it out as they have
[50:09.200 --> 50:14.160]  all of this stuff so it's not limited to that area and it was really pretty amazing what he had to
[50:14.160 --> 50:20.160]  say about this um he said those who speak out against civil forfeiture this is a wyoming governor
[50:20.160 --> 50:25.040]  governor mead a republican he said those who speak out against civil forfeiture have combed
[50:25.040 --> 50:29.920]  wyoming's forfeiture files have analyzed many hundreds of cases but they haven't found one
[50:29.920 --> 50:35.920]  egregious case or an abuse of individual rights in a 40-year history well as ram paul also said at
[50:35.920 --> 50:40.880]  buoy state when he talked about obama using the indefinite attention he says i'm not saying that
[50:40.880 --> 50:46.080]  he's a bad guy i'm just saying we don't want to have a system of government that requires
[50:46.080 --> 50:52.160]  a good person to run it and that's what we have with this criminal act stay with us we'll be right back

[54:20.240 --> 54:25.600]  what's in the next hour before we get back to the news and i want to let you know where the
[54:25.600 --> 54:29.280]  fight against civil asset forfeiture is in the states because i think that's where it's going
[54:29.280 --> 54:32.480]  to be won before i get to that i just want to let you know that we now have supermail
[54:32.480 --> 54:39.920]  formula back in stock supermail vitality it's a new formulation it contains a new key ingredient
[54:39.920 --> 54:45.360]  vulvic acid that's to enhance the formula's ability to work in the body to make it more bio
[54:45.360 --> 54:49.520]  available and it uses advanced new processing technique the doctor group's been working on
[54:49.520 --> 54:54.560]  since the initial testing of supermail vitality nearly five years ago again you can get that at
[54:54.560 --> 55:01.200]  info wars life dot com that's the new supermail vitality new formulation and it is back in stock
[55:02.000 --> 55:08.320]  now as i was pointing out in the last segment we have a civil asset forfeiture law very strong law
[55:08.320 --> 55:14.320]  in de mexico passed unanimously by both the house in the senate by both democrats and republicans one
[55:14.320 --> 55:17.520]  is controlled by one party the other one is controlled by another party but the republican
[55:17.520 --> 55:23.200]  governor susanna martinez looks like she's going to exercise a pocket veto on this hopefully they
[55:23.200 --> 55:28.080]  can override that and so you need to if you live in new mexico do something about it but there are
[55:28.080 --> 55:35.360]  20 states where this is in play and you need to be aware of what's going on this attacks all of our
[55:35.360 --> 55:40.400]  fundamental liberties not just our private property rights it attacks our right to do process if they
[55:40.400 --> 55:44.160]  can do it with this they can do it with anything and of course they are doing it across the board
[55:44.160 --> 55:50.960]  because we didn't stop them in this insane war on drugs way back and i want to read you what governor
[55:50.960 --> 55:58.160]  mead said when he vetoed the wyoming legislature's reform of civil asset forfeiture essentially
[55:58.800 --> 56:05.120]  reestablishing our constitutional rights to do process he said civil asset forfeiture is an
[56:05.120 --> 56:12.320]  is important and it is a right he said the government has a right to take your property
[56:12.320 --> 56:16.880]  without you being convicted of a crime without you even being charged with the crime
[56:16.880 --> 56:21.360]  and there is no limit to how much they can take just like we pointed out they want to take
[56:21.360 --> 56:26.240]  the family's home because the son made a $40 drug deal on the back porch
[56:27.600 --> 56:34.880]  that's a violation of of having a proportional excessive fines and penalties and punishments
[56:34.880 --> 56:39.920]  so you need to understand that this republican governor and governors just like i think it
[56:39.920 --> 56:45.280]  highlights what's going on why we can't really put all of our hope on getting things fixed in
[56:45.280 --> 56:49.120]  washington i actually put no hope on getting things fixed in washington i think the place has
[56:49.120 --> 56:53.520]  become a cesspool i think it's corrupt and i think evidence of it is the fact that you can have
[56:53.520 --> 56:58.800]  somebody who is a former federal attorney with regional responsibilities become a republican
[56:58.800 --> 57:03.600]  governor and say something like this civil asset forfeiture the law enforcement taking your property
[57:03.600 --> 57:07.760]  without charging with anything without convicting you of anything is a right and it's very important
[57:07.760 --> 57:12.480]  for them because he says crime should not pay and that's why we're trying to stop civil asset
[57:12.480 --> 57:16.800]  forfeiture because crime does pay it pays for the government to steal your property
[57:16.800 --> 57:21.520]  they get away with it they get to keep it for their own personal use they violate every one of
[57:21.520 --> 57:27.840]  the bill of rights except for the first three in this process this guy ought to be impeached he ought
[57:27.840 --> 57:32.080]  to be disbarred he's disqualified for being a governor and i tell you what any of these people
[57:32.080 --> 57:36.160]  who do it and you've got 50 governors this is a more elite club than being a senator you've got
[57:36.160 --> 57:42.000]  100 senators you got 50 governors these people are thoroughly co-opted if they play the cards right
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.560]  they can become a senator they can hang out for life uh profiting from graft and corruption in
[57:46.560 --> 57:52.160]  this cesspool we call washington dc but we got some good people at the state level one of them
[57:52.160 --> 57:59.760]  in texas we've got david simpson uh who is always always there this is a guy david simpson
[57:59.760 --> 58:05.120]  from longview texas republican he's the guy who fought two times to stop the tsa he's the guy we
[58:05.120 --> 58:10.400]  just talked to him a couple of weeks ago because he wants to remove marijuana from the texas statutes
[58:10.400 --> 58:15.280]  completely and now he's back trying to stop the government from stealing your property
[58:15.280 --> 58:23.360]  without convicting you of anything what a novel idea what if we actually had a government that
[58:23.360 --> 58:28.320]  followed the law that's a novel idea isn't it what if they actually followed the constitution
[58:28.320 --> 58:40.560]  that they take an oath to stay with us we'll be right back

[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today we're going to be talking to
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:32.720]  paul joseph watson beginning in the next segment i want to continue a little bit about civil asset
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.960]  forfeiture where these guys are hanging out we talked about what's going on at the state level
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.360]  as i pointed out i don't think that we're going to see any reform at the federal level and let me
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:48.400]  tell you why they know that this is starting to hit the public airwaves they know that people are
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.800]  starting to pay attention to this outrage they call civil asset forfeiture they've been doing this
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:58.320]  for over 20 years but people are starting to pay attention now so you got people like eric holder
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.200]  saying well you know we're going to do something about this and understand that this is also we
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.200]  see this manifested in many different ways it's also the war on cash where they don't want anybody
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.520]  having cash where they accuse you of structuring your deposits where they accuse you of having
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:18.080]  suspicious activity if you take $5,000 in cash out of the bank after having already scrutinized
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.040]  every penny that you put in and reporting suspicious activity if you put in large amounts they
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:28.240]  report it when you take it out i guess that way they can alert the nsa to start watching your
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:33.120]  movements more carefully since they can't follow every transaction that you do with a credit card
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:37.280]  you might be paying cash let's watch this guy really carefully that's the kind of paranoid police
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:43.040]  state that we're living in now but of course eric holder has heard your concerns and he's going to
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:47.920]  do something to rein this in listen to this new policy that they have in the absence of criminal
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:53.680]  charges judicially authorized warrants to seize bank accounts involved in structuring can only
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:02:00.240]  be obtained if a prosecutor first develops probable cause of federal criminal activity
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:06.080]  and that determination is approved by a supervisor but what's going on with that i mean you're
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:11.280]  telling me that you don't have to convict anybody before you take their cash you don't have to go
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:17.200]  to a judge you don't have to get a search warrant you don't have to get a guilty verdict you just
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:24.960]  have to say well i've got probable cause they got probable cause for everything everything is probable
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:31.680]  cause and all they have to do is get their supervisor who is going to profit from the money
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:37.440]  that they confiscate who's going to profit from the cars that they confiscate and again this is not
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:43.520]  just the war on drugs this is structuring this is suspicious activity reports it all began with
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.760]  the war on drugs but it's metastasized way beyond that they can take your cash they can take your
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.120]  property they can take anything all they have to do is get approval from a supervisor that's the
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.960]  test anymore and of course we have rand paul's fair act that would take that down rand paul's i played
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:05.360]  in the last uh in the last hour i played what he said at bui state he really sincerely understands
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:10.080]  what the problem is and he's going to probably announce tomorrow that he's going to be running
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.280]  for president uh articles up on the drudge report washington post rand paul seems to stray from his
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:20.960]  libertarian roots as he courts a g.o.p base yes of course a lot of us are concerned about the
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:25.280]  overtures that he's making to the warmongers within the republican party i think he needs
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:30.640]  to transcend it of course you can't the problem is you can't get uh the nomination without uh
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:36.720]  having that warmongering or at least some of the warmongering vote but um that's the sad state of
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:41.360]  two party politics and of course they make sure that we only have two parties that we can choose
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:46.640]  from that's how they control us that's how they appear to give us a false choice but of course
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:51.200]  they say that uh on both national security and on cultural fronts in other words because he's
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:57.280]  come out and said that he uh stands with christians on religious persecution that that has alienated
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.760]  his base well i don't think that it is alienated his base that much perhaps the national security
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:07.440]  thing the real thing that is going to uh tell us where rand paul and any of these other people stand
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:12.240]  is going to be the trans-pacific partnership the transatlantic partnerships those trade agreements
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:19.760]  that are not trade agreements they are sovereignty destroying agreements being negotiated in secret
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.200]  public is not allowed to see it our elected representatives are not allowed to see it
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:27.840]  they're fast tracking it through they're going to push this multi-thousand page legislation through
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:33.600]  without any modification or oversight that's where we need to look out that's where we need to be
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:40.480]  careful and of course you've got jeb bush waiting in the wings doubling down on his love of the nsa
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:47.520]  not much of a choice is it say with us we're going to be back we're going to talk to paul joseph
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.520]  watson say with us right after the break

[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:49.040]  in right now paul thank you for joining us good to be back david now i want to talk to you before
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:56.560]  we get to the uh situation that's going on with rolling stone and uva uh this situation on facebook
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:03.360]  about insulting somebody and and give us your comments on that yeah this was a woman who got
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.600]  into an argument with somebody on facebook it was actually a case of mistaken identity
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:13.840]  so you know the argument got heated this one woman responded with an image of herself you know
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:18.960]  a selfie with a gun and basically said this is what i actually look like if you want to come
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:24.960]  and get me obviously it was a dumb comment to make but they responded by arresting her and now
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:31.760]  she faces a misdemeanor uh several months jail time if convicted or a two thousand five hundred
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:38.160]  dollar fine now the the issue was not whether this was a dumb comment it obviously was whether it
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:42.800]  required her to be arrested and charged with a misdemeanor that sounds patently ridiculous
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:48.320]  but what's most chilling about this story is the comments made by this police representative in
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:55.760]  virginia who told the new york daily news quote free speech doesn't say you have the right to insult
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:02.560]  anybody and then he also said that swearing on facebook social media or the internet was the
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:09.440]  same as disorderly conduct in public so he was basically making the case that swearing on facebook
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:15.600]  or insulting somebody on facebook was a crime that should lead to arrest i think that's going to shut
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.960]  down uh google if they uh put that because i mean the comments on google google is uh one of the most
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:26.080]  uh ruthless and rude places for comments i've ever seen in my life are worse than facebook so i
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:31.840]  mean there goes youtube if we were to allow something that silly well yeah obviously they
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:38.320]  could never enforce such a ridiculous law because this is not about enforcement it's about creating
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:44.320]  that chilling effect where you're afraid to say anything on social media i mean we've had cases
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:50.160]  even in the uk the past couple of months where for example a journalist made a joke about somebody
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:56.480]  who raised a pakistani flag above a town in england and he called the police on her for inciting racial
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:01.680]  hatred so there there have actually been police investigations on you know politically incorrect
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:08.640]  speech but then in america you have several cases over the past couple of years where it's basically
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:15.680]  teenagers making dumb comments sarcastic comments and jokes which they could never properly mean
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:21.600]  for example there was a rapper an 18 year old rapper i believe he was cameron de ambrosio
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:27.360]  who basically posted some rap lyrics on facebook which could be seen as violent he was arrested
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:32.640]  there was an 18 year old woman who was sent to jail after quote lolling about a hit and run
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:40.080]  and a dui on facebook so it's basically distasteful comments that get flagged get reported to police
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:46.080]  and instead of ignoring them and focusing on real crimes they actually go after these dumb teenagers
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:51.200]  who make stupid comments on facebook and arrest them and in some cases charge them yeah as you
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.880]  pointed out in the subtitle the cop said there's no such thing as a petty crime i think paul one of
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:02.640]  the best things that we have in terms of shutting this kind of over-the-top nonsense now because
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:07.280]  it's not going to be shut down by our elected officials certainly not in washington i i don't
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:11.920]  know that we can really count on too many even at the state level i think we need to have juries
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:16.720]  we need to have fully informed juries who are going to say all right so yeah she did a okay
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:23.920]  harassment by computer but you're going to send her to jail for a year and find her $2,500 no not
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:28.720]  guilty and just shut that kind of stuff down that happened during alcohol prohibition has happened
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:35.840]  in the past that is the purpose of the juries to ultimately stand against intrusive and unconstitutional
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:40.880]  unreasonable punishments unconstitutional laws at both the state and the federal level i think
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:44.720]  that's really about the only way that we're ever going to have protection from this because it just
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:51.840]  gets more and more absurd that would be a sensible step but it's it's not one that they're taking i
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:57.920]  remember um brandon ralb a couple of years ago that the veteran he made some comments on facebook
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:02.960]  which were in the context of the illuminati card game and other games that he was playing i believe
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:07.600]  it was with his brother which could be taken as violent if you applied them politically even
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:14.480]  though the context wasn't political he was literally abducted by fbi police and secret service
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:21.120]  detained in a psychiatric facility for a week nobody really knew where he even was for a week
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:27.200]  he finally got released but again that was perhaps the most egregious example of how comments taken
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:33.680]  out of context by law enforcement authorities are treated as terrorist threats and then people
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:38.800]  are arrested i mean there was a case in britain where somebody made a joke about bombing as in
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:44.560]  you know the the sense of bombing having fun um in relation to a flight and they got thrown in jail
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:49.120]  for 10 years well let's not forget how far they're taking this let's not forget the case of barrett
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:54.240]  brown you and i and joe biggs all talked to barrett brown from prison and of course julian
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:15:00.720]  assange says social media has all of your friends wearing a wire and the perfect example of the
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:06.240]  government taking something out of context and completely twisting it was in the conviction
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:10.560]  of barrett brown where they said that he was threatening an fbi agent in reality what he was
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:18.240]  doing was sarcastically reposting a quote from a fox news commentator saying that julian assange
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:23.760]  ought to be assassinated and what he did was he he quoted that verbatim after that and and
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:28.480]  they said oh you're talking about an fbi agent he wasn't talking about an fbi agent but nevertheless
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:33.680]  he's in prison because of that that's essentially what they did to him so and by the way there's
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.880]  an update to uh barrett brown and just noticed over the weekend they have shut down his email
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:45.280]  service not allowing him to receive or send any email because they're afraid that he's going to
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:50.960]  talk to people on the outside that's tells you exactly what they're after that's why they would
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.520]  misconstrue what he had to say when they have somebody who is pointing out their criminal
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:00.080]  actions or who is an enemy of the state for whatever reason maybe he just politically opposes what
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:05.280]  they're doing they will take your stuff out of context that's on social media and they will send
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.600]  you to jail then they will shut you down so that you can't communicate to people on the outside
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:14.640]  that's what they're doing to barrett brown right now yeah and i mean as he mentioned you see over
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:20.000]  and over again examples where the political class can get away with making violent comments
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.080]  as well as you know many leftists while people are you know castigated as offensive or racist for
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:31.680]  making certain comments taken out of context you know azalea but banks the black rapper can
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.600]  rant about crack killing crackers in their sleep all day and nothing happens there was a global
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:43.840]  warming skeptic just yesterday who got his twitter account suspended because he had an argument with
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:48.800]  somebody about global warming so again it's this double standards that they keep applying which
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:53.200]  you know some people can get away with it others can't depending on their political viewpoint
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:59.360]  absolutely i know you want to talk about the the aspects of what's going on with this rolling
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:05.120]  stone story in the university of virginia fraternity that rolling stones is now taking back
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:10.480]  that story and it looks like the fraternity is going to they say pursue according to cnn they're
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:16.000]  going to pursue all legal action against rolling stone break that down for the people let give them
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.600]  background as to what's been going on with that for the last half a year or so yeah well the incident
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:26.080]  happened in september or it didn't happen it was an alleged incident which turned out to be completely
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:32.640]  fraudulent but this college rape myth first began to circulate in 2010 it was npr in the center for
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:38.160]  public integrity they put out this report which cherry picked the facts and misrepresented the
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:45.120]  data and then we got this myth that one in five young girls who go to college are raped and this
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:52.400]  was even repeated by obama himself it was only a few months ago that we actually um debunked this
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:58.080]  affirmatively when the department of justice came out with statistics that showed that college girls
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:05.040]  were um less likely to be raped than women in the general population so instead of one in five it was
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:13.040]  0.03 in five far lower than the general population but for five years they peddled this myth that
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:19.840]  one in five college girls would be raped and again it's born out of this idea of cultural marxism
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:27.040]  they only focus on real rape issues if they can be blamed on the evil white male patriarchy at the
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:32.720]  same time that this completely fraudulent and debunked uva hoax was going on that you know
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:39.280]  leftists and feminists were peddling it we had a situation in england for example rutheran rochdale
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:45.280]  and oxford all these different towns where groups of pakistani muslim men were abducting and sexually
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:51.840]  abusing young white girls and the authorities in those towns were covering it up because they feared
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:59.840]  they would be labeled politically incorrect or racist for bringing these rapists to justice and
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.920]  of course throughout that whole thing and even after the report came out confirming that this
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:11.040]  happened leftists and feminists completely ignored it because they only focus on rape issues that
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:15.920]  can be blamed on the evil white western male patriarchy that they hate because it's born
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:22.800]  out of their obsession with cultural marxism not genuine concern about women's rights and
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:29.280]  women and young girls being raped so columbia did a thorough investigation into this college rape
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:34.960]  issue and found that it was completely biased they made up facts they had a single source
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:40.560]  all the friends of this supposed rape victim jackie didn't give the quotes that were printed
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:46.560]  in the article the police investigated this alleged gang rape nothing they found no evidence of it
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:50.720]  hang on paul we're gonna break that down a little bit more after the break hang on we're

[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:26.640]  in and what we were talking about just before the break was this situation at the university of
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:31.680]  virginia evolving the rolling stone story and of course this has been going on for about six
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:37.920]  months as paul was pointing out there was a climate that had been created by npr and some other
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:44.240]  mainstream outlets or left stream outlets however you want to call it a narrative trying the
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:49.440]  politically correct narrative about rape on college campuses and apparently in trying to tap
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:55.120]  into that vibe rolling stone reporters went over the edge now this is a report that came out today
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:59.360]  actually this is reported on npr report by the clumbier university graduate school of journalism
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:05.520]  said that the errors behind the article involved quote basically every level of rolling stones
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:11.040]  newsroom they said it was a systematic failing it involved basically every level of the rolling
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:15.760]  stone newsroom the reporter the editor on the front lines but also the policies and the supervision
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:21.520]  failed but basically paul this is essentially i don't know we see that happen so many times we've
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:28.560]  got the media becoming an echo chamber for some cause celeb or some especially politically correct
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:36.000]  cause yeah it's basically political activism disguised as journalism yes but the thing about
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.720]  it is this rolling stone writer who wrote this article in november last year it's since been
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:47.760]  completely debunked she's not going to be fired neither is her managing editor the article editor
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:53.520]  or any of the fact checkers that were involved in publishing this story despite the fact that even
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:59.440]  from the very outset as this columbia university report makes clear you know that the quotes used
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:04.720]  in the article were not from the actual people they were ascribed to the main protagonist in the
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:10.640]  supposed gang rape of this woman jackie did not exist that the police the university couldn't find
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:16.400]  any evidence that even existed so it was completely it was at least dodgy from the very start turned
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:21.920]  out to be fraudulent but nobody's being fired and then you know brian williams gets suspended for
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:28.000]  six months for lying about a story but this writer this rolling stone writer sabrina irdley and all
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.280]  the staff on the rolling stone involved with this keep their jobs nothing happens to them so again
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:39.440]  this idea of male privilege is completely demolished and you know it's the double standard it's you
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.400]  know when certain people say things that are offensive or when journalists get things badly
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:49.280]  wrong or when they lie some of them are fired some of them are forced to apologize some of them just
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:56.080]  keep their jobs and even in the apology that this writer made she didn't apologize to the people
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:01.600]  accused in this fraternity of having committed this gang rape which there's no evidence for
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:07.120]  so even then they still double down and refuse to take full responsibility interesting it looks
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:12.080]  like there is going to be they said that the fraternity that they are going to follow every
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:17.040]  legal alley that they have to get compensated for this one of the things i think that's
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:22.160]  interesting too about this paul is as they pointed out in this review they said the pseudonyms
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:26.720]  and the attribution disguise as you point out some of these people did not even really exist
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:31.920]  were not only where the information came from but also the fact they never identified these friends
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:37.120]  or ever spoke to them and of course that's always an issue when we do journalism many times but we've
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:42.160]  got cases that are going on right now with the obama administration going after james ryzen
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:46.640]  james rosen a couple of people who are from the new york times as well as fox news did not want
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:51.200]  to reveal their sources we've had situations like the dais air force base we couldn't reveal
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:57.360]  our source there so you always do have legitimate cases we don't want to reveal your source in
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:03.280]  order to protect that source you have that privilege but it then that can be abused in a really
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:11.280]  horrific way i mean what what is the what is the bottom line for this in terms of what the report
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:16.880]  said which was that rollingstone's fundamental mistake was in suspending any skepticism about
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:21.440]  jackie's account because remember it was all coming from just her there was no corroborating
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:27.120]  evidence or other sources because of the sensitivity of the issue and even now in the aftermath
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:32.160]  they're saying well it was right to go through with this because you know she was a victim and
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:36.320]  we had to consider the sensitivities of it even though there's no evidence that she was even a
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:42.240]  victim at all so again it's this political activism this social justice warrior mentality
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:48.480]  that it's okay to lie and follow sloppy standards and just throw up an article that impunes an entire
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:54.640]  university because of the greater good and the sensitivity of the rape issue when they completely
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:00.640]  ignore the huge rape scandal sweeping europe in you know denmark sweden and norway where it's
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:08.160]  through the roof it's it's up 1400 percent rate since the mid 70s mainly because of muslim immigrants
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:13.840]  77 percent of the culprits in sweden are identified as foreigners because that but because that's
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:19.520]  not politically correct leftists and feminists completely ignore it while peddling this rape
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:24.320]  culture myth which has been completely debunked by the justice department's own statistics
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:28.320]  yeah very very very selective about what they report of course they're not going to attack
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:36.880]  uh anyone who as you point out who is exposing their sacred cows but of course uh they will come
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:42.800]  after anyone who they don't like politically even if they have to make up the information

[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.800]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host in austin and we have joining us uh
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:38.960]  paul joseph watson from the uk we've just been talking about the massive journalistic failings
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:46.320]  that we've seen going on with the rollingstone story covering a purported rape at uva which was
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:52.320]  a total fabrication and of course rollingstone asked for the graduate school the university of
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:57.120]  columbia the graduate school of journalism to look at this and the report they came back
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:03.200]  with said that there was systematic failing at every level let's put some bookends on this
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:08.880]  uh paul of course they're going to the the fraternity that's been defamed in this is going
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:13.920]  to be pursuing uh legal measures they've already said they're going to do that according to cnn
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:17.440]  money they say they're going to pursue all available legal action there's going to be a
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:23.360]  lawsuit on this let's put a bookend on this what do you think this is going to head of course they
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:28.480]  did not fire this individual who reported this i mean what what is uh is it going to be something
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:33.120]  that's going to uh scare the uh mainstream media from doing this in the future do you think it's
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:38.320]  going to be business as usual well that's the big debate about whether it will stop actual
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:42.480]  rape victims from coming forward and reporting what's happened to them because of you know the
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:47.200]  mess that this has created so that's one of the concerns the other one for me is just the complete
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:53.120]  double standard for example the guardian has an article on this again completely dismissing it
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:58.720]  and the comments they promote to the top of the article which is an interesting new phenomenon
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:04.320]  because there have been studies conducted which show that the comments beneath an article can drive
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:09.600]  the narrative of the entire article rather than the article itself which is why comments are very
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:15.200]  important which is why the guardian senses them all the time but they've promoted these two comments
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:20.720]  to the top of the article comments which basically say that they still insist that this story is
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:25.920]  generally true and that Jackie the woman in the story was raped even though there's absolutely no
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:30.800]  evidence to suggest that so it's just interesting how they double down on these issues even though
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:37.520]  they've been caught in total deception but it just feeds into the wider narrative which is you know
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:43.280]  born out of cultural Marxism that they will only focus on things that can be blamed on white western
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:51.680]  males despite the fact that rape in America has declined 58% since 1994 we do have a major problem
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:57.280]  in Europe as I mentioned before the break with these Pakistani Muslim rape gangs which feminists
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:02.800]  and leftists refuse to talk about because that's not politically correct and because they don't
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:08.320]  really care about women they only care about their intersectional issues which can be blamed on the
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:14.720]  patriarchy so I would hope that it kind of demolishes this whole rape culture myth as they
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:19.600]  claim it's arising out of quote the dominant culture which is western white males because
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:25.520]  there's very little evidence for that whatsoever and in fact the evidence is that rape is going down
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:31.600]  if you look at it from that perspective but also you know we had the walking while female video a
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:39.040]  few months ago a woman walking through mainly poor ghetto areas of New York for 10 hours and they got
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:45.040]  two minutes of footage of people mainly saying compliments to her she was harassed a couple
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:51.120]  of times but this was 10 hours of footage what was interesting was when some people pointed out that
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:56.640]  most of the harassment and the heckling was coming from minorities because she was walking through
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:02.080]  these poor areas they actually lied to the video makers and claimed that oh no there were more
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:07.360]  threats and harassment from white people it's just the audio wasn't loud enough to pick them up
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:13.920]  they blatantly lie when people bring up the fact that you know it's in a lot of culture of these
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:19.280]  minorities because of their culture not because of the color of their skin to harass women and treat
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:26.560]  women as second-class citizens as Islam does in many countries but again feminists don't talk about
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:32.640]  that they don't draw attention to that because it can't be used to demonize who they want to demonize
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:37.520]  the same as you know adult entertainers there was an adult entertainer called Scytheria who was gang
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:43.600]  raped feminists completely ignored it because a lot of them are this kind of new breed of puritans
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:48.480]  they hate women who are involved in the adult entertainment industry so it's just interesting
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:53.520]  how they pick and choose their rape victims and who to focus on when in this case it was a completely
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:59.040]  debunked and demolished issue it never happened well of course it is interesting how they pick
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:03.200]  and choose and we've talked about that when you and I have talked about the cases of police brutality
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:06.640]  they pick and choose they want to get something that's ambiguous so they can set white people
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:11.920]  against black people and vice versa this is all about divide and conquer ultimately and as we played
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:18.560]  some clips from this this sneering Machiavellian president of strat for his name is Friedman
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:24.080]  he's talking about different war issues and they had somebody ask him you know what what he thought
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:28.960]  was the the threat of the Islamists and goes well that's not really a problem and he goes on with
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.440]  some of these other things but he points out that they want to keep people fighting with each other
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:40.400]  because he says you don't have to defeat something that never gets started the fleet that never
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:45.040]  gets started in his particular analogy but of course if you've got a pushback against police
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:50.400]  state abuses you never have to really fight that if you can keep that from ever getting started if
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:56.000]  people just dismiss this as something that is a white versus black get people fighting amongst
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:03.760]  themselves one of the things Paul that he mentioned was how the genius way that Ronald Reagan had
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:09.360]  gotten the Iraqis and the Iranians fighting against each other and of course it's not just
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:14.400]  getting different countries fighting against each other but it is getting the citizens of our
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:18.800]  country to fight against each other over all these different issues and not really seeing
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:23.840]  where the the real enemy is I think that's really what is at the heart of this is as I see it is
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:29.360]  this divide and conquer strategy yeah and you've seen that since the whole black lives matter
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:34.560]  movement emerged because the polls clearly show that in general across the United States more
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:41.040]  people now support the police than they did before this whole issue emerged because they see these
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:47.360]  black brunch protesters going into restaurants and diners and just basically harassing white people
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:53.040]  who have nothing to do with what the police do police conduct police brutality so again we never
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:58.880]  address the real causes of police brutality which is why police and predominantly black people are
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:03.280]  getting into these violent confrontations in the first place and there's a problem with violence
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:07.760]  within the police community but there's also a problem of violence and criminality within the
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:13.760]  black community the statistics bury out you know black people responsible for 50 percent of homicides
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:18.480]  despite being only 13 percent of the population so the 9-11 calls are going to be coming from
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:22.880]  those areas that's why they get into confrontations in the first place that doesn't mean there's not
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:28.240]  a problem with police brutality there clearly is but we're never going to identify and rectify it
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:33.760]  if most of the population support the police because they've been fed this phony narrative about
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:40.320]  hands up don't you yes exactly and what we wind up with is essentially kind of a as we've talked
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:44.080]  about they talked about the Teflon presidency with Ronald Reagan how no matter how many scandals
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:49.120]  he's involved in even though he could sell arms to our supposed mortal enemies the Iranians so
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:54.480]  that he could then ferment revolutions in South America the Iran-Contra situation no matter how
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:59.680]  crooked that was no matter how much of that was exposed and of course Gary Webb exposed the other
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:04.640]  aspect of it how they would then take the drugs from that from Central America and create a crack
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:10.080]  cocaine epidemic no matter what they did nothing stuck because Ronald Reagan was a Teflon president
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:15.120]  we see that now with the police state no matter how bad it is nothing sticks and part of it is
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:20.160]  because of the way they have cleverly switched the narrative and misdirected people you know Paul
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:27.200]  I don't know if you're aware of this but here in the US we've had 176 people killed by cops in
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:34.320]  January and February and then in March alone it was over 100 people were killed by cops I mean we
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:40.080]  do really have a problem and I think part of the reason that we're seeing this disproportionately
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:45.120]  with black people is because they've got this broken windows program where they say that we're
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:51.040]  going to set up a heavy police presence in areas where we see broken windows or graffiti or whatever
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:56.240]  so we're going to put a massive amount of police there whenever you put a lot of police in a
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:01.920]  particular area they're going to start harassing people for stuff like selling cigarettes without
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:08.080]  paying the the tobacco tax on it and if anybody pushes back they're liable to kill that person
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:14.000]  that's what we saw with Eric Garner yeah and you know that that was a genuine case of police
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:20.560]  brutality and the cops should have been indicted but they mainly focus on cases like Antonio Martin
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:25.360]  who pointed a gun at a cop's head I mean it doesn't matter what whether you're black or white if you
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:29.680]  point a gun at a cop's head the consequences generally aren't going to be very pleasant
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:34.320]  but they focused on that like that was another example that it was on a par with Eric Garner
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:40.640]  so you know the media drives a lot of that look at Time Magazine in defense of rioting immediately
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:47.200]  after the Ferguson unrest they defended the people who were out there burning down mainly black-owned
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:52.400]  businesses so they were pushing this whole narrative along with the Obama Justice Department
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:57.200]  and Obama himself who said that you know they had legitimate grievances when they were burning
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:02.720]  down stores you know that does absolutely nothing to address the issue of police brutality
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:08.960]  and only makes the people who raise it as a concern look bad so it discredited it to a large degree
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:14.160]  and then you know why is it being funded by George Soros none of these movements that are
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:20.480]  promoted by the establishment media and get 33 million dollars in funding can be called grass
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:26.720]  roots they're not grass roots they're astroturf movements that you know whip up a lot of genuine
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:32.240]  people but they're at the end of the day they're being directed towards a narrative and an agenda
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:36.880]  that suits the elite it doesn't suit the grass roots the people that would normally support it
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:44.240]  yeah you know I looked at this article today from info wars.com CIA and NSA analysts are treated by
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:50.560]  specialist psychologists because they see so many brutal beheadings and attacks and hardcore child
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:55.440]  pornography and you know so they they take them aside and they give them a special treatment and
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:01.120]  I guess you know to some degree Paul I look at these headlines every day and I'm looking at some
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:05.200]  of these things disturbing video shows a cop allowing a canine to maul an unconscious man to
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:10.000]  death we reported about that a Texas man thrown in jail for weeks because his lawn was overgrown
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.800]  father criticizes Detroit police for alleged negligence and sons traffic stopped death
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:19.520]  Texas sheriff deputy punches a pregnant woman another one where we've got a upon info wars.com
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:25.200]  today graphic footage surfaces of Idaho police shooting a pregnant woman who's mentally ill we
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:31.120]  see this over and over and over again and I tell you it just really grieves me I you know I know
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:36.400]  that you don't have this situation anywhere near this level in the UK I hope you don't get it there
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:42.080]  but it is a problem here and we're not doing anything about it because of this divide and
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:47.680]  conquer strategy because they carefully pick which ones they want to talk about and they avoid the
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:53.280]  ones that are so obvious and so egregious and nobody in the mainstream media talks about it
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:59.360]  only we talk about Kelly Thomas the homeless man being punched to death repeatedly by cops when
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:06.240]  his dad was a former police officer who instructed people on the proper way to engage the public
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:11.120]  and we don't even have a discussion in this country about what the proper let's call it rules of
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:14.960]  engagement for lack of better terms how are the police going to conduct themselves and we just
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:21.120]  had another case of a cop who was escorted a lady to a domestic dispute because there'd been a
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:25.600]  dispute between she and her husband and he had there was a straining restraining order against
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.800]  her so he was there an argument broke out between the two of them the dog started barking and the
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:37.200]  deputy sheriff pulls out a gun to shoot the barking dog who was no threat to him he somehow falls
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:41.360]  on the ground as he's shooting and continues shooting and shoots a lady in the chest multiple
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:48.880]  times and kills her I mean that's the kind of Barney Fife over the top crazy rules that we see
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:52.640]  of engagement that the police are acting and nothing is being done he's not going to be charged
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:58.800]  for anything not for negligent use negligent homicide nothing and of course he's going to remain
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:05.040]  a cop and that's what we see that everywhere yeah I think there's some crazy statistic which is
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:09.760]  something like that there have been more Americans killed by police in the last year than something
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:15.360]  like the last 30 years in the UK it's something like that yes but as far as I can tell it's it
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:20.800]  must be due to the training because when you watch videos of police training in fact I remember
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:26.480]  posting one in an article it was out of Austin I think it's literally like a military boot camp
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.880]  where they're being trained to take on an enemy and where is that training coming from it's coming
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:36.080]  from the federal government we know that and even in New Mexico with remember the case where they
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:40.960]  shot the homeless man just outside of Albuquerque in the hills and that did become viral it was in
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:46.160]  New Mexico at the state level that you had an instructor saying I'm not going to teach this
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:52.080]  shoot first curriculum and they had changed that that was dictated from the federal government
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:56.960]  they want to militarize the police they want to have confrontations they want them to get violent
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:02.880]  with the public it's being driven from the federal government and their officers at the state level
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:07.200]  at the local level who are pushing back against it unfortunately they're only choice now in most
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:12.880]  cases is what this guy at the state police academy in New Mexico did and that was resigned because
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:19.680]  the system had moved on and had left behind officers who wanted to have a sane balanced
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:24.800]  response to situations I tell you if you've got to shoot a pregnant woman if that's your only
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:29.440]  way that you can control a situation with a pregnant woman you should not be in the job period
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:36.000]  well I mean you remember that the target you know the billboard targets that they were selling to
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:41.520]  Homeland Security one of them was of a pregnant woman yes yes true the whole the whole perception
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:46.560]  of American police from it you know objectively if you live outside of the United States is that
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:52.480]  there this predatory gang I mean one of the iconic images of American police is just hanging out on a
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:58.880]  on a highway generating revenue and then shooting people those are the two most familiar things
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:03.280]  that people would associate with American police from an outside perspective well from somebody
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:07.120]  who's grown up here that's the way I would look at it basically yeah it's the same way I would
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:11.040]  look at that's a pretty true perception unfortunately it used to be that every there was a joke about
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:15.600]  you know uh heaven was you know where you get the best of all these different places you know hell
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:18.960]  it was where you would get the British cooking and the German police and so forth and so on
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:24.000]  but now the American police have taken the place of the most oppressive police of course the German
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  police got that reputation because of Hitler because of the Stasi but we have gotten far
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.960]  worse than the German police ever were and they have more power and more information about everybody
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:41.520]  than the German police ever did no I mean you know the the majority of police in America will
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:45.760]  you know they're perfectly fine and you won't have any problems with them but it's just this
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:51.440]  this gang mentality that infests a lot of it you know the roi heads and the the tattooed ones
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:56.000]  yeah it's not like that in Britain I mean that yeah the police are corrupt they're completely
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:01.760]  corrupt but they don't go out in a predatory fashion to attack the public and look to escalate
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:07.840]  violent confrontations it's all about de-escalating violence in America it seems like the opposite
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:13.040]  it seems the first chance they get even if you merely speak back to them they will use that
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:18.560]  as an excuse to escalate the situation if they don't get instant avail from you know a member of
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:22.800]  the public and and here's the thing that we need to talk as you point out this this we're not trying
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:27.600]  to do a blanket condemnation of police as Frank Serpico who we've had on this program many times
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:31.600]  of people are young they may not know the movie Serpico without but you know you should see it
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:36.560]  it's great film interesting true story but we've had Frank Serpico on many times he talks about
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:41.760]  people being points of light who are in the system who speak out against what's happening there in
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:46.720]  his day what was happening was corruption from the war on drugs and it was a financial thing
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:52.400]  but he pointed out that today there's this brutality issue that's really the bigger challenge and of
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:57.680]  course that I would argue has come out of the corruption with the war on drugs but when you
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:02.240]  don't stop it and as he said you're always going to have in any profession you're always going to
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:05.920]  have good people you're going to have bad people I mean we were just talking about journalism
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:10.080]  look at the situation that happened here you've got Rolling Stones has done some great journalism
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:14.960]  especially Matt Tiabi about bankers that sort of thing but you've all you've got different types
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:21.520]  of people there once though you have a system that does not punish wrongdoing then the system
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:29.120]  itself accepts that wrongdoing it excuses it it internalizes it and then you have systemic
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:34.080]  corruption and that's the problem that we have here in America today because the brutality
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:39.040]  is not being punished the people are not being fired or put in jail and so the system itself
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:44.240]  is accepting it rubber stamping it and becoming systemically corrupted thank you so much Paul

[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:37.440]  info wars life dot com where you can call 800-253-3139 now we were talking earlier in the program
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:42.800]  about the fact that rand paul is going to announce probably tomorrow that he's going to run for
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:49.520]  president of course the elephant in the room that everyone is talking about is jeb bush
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:56.080]  he has so much money we've got an article that's up on drudge today gary hart is talking about a
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:59.680]  billion dollar clinton campaign he said that should frighten americans i think it should
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:05.680]  i think we should all be frightened about how much money is pouring into the coffers of clinton
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:11.440]  and of jeb bush you know it was hl meakin that said an election is an advanced auction of stolen
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:19.120]  goods and he was exactly right guys pull up that clip with jeb bush on you huet because you know
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:25.120]  when you give a billion dollars to hillary clinton and we we see that happening all the time i mean
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:31.440]  we could wind up having a two billion dollar presidential campaign and that is just a prescription
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:38.480]  for disaster that is an advanced auction of stolen goods but jeb bush went on the hu huet show and
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:46.560]  hu huet is a conservative a rike wing conservative as i would call him a real warmonger and they
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:52.400]  were talking about the nsa and jeb bush's love affair with the nsa and of course this is a conversation
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:56.560]  that happened right after the shooting of the two men dressed as women the two transvestite
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:01.360]  prostitutes that stole the car whatever and hit the hit the barrier but this is the way they
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:05.920]  responded to that let's play that audio clip let's turn to the serious stuff i want to start with
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:11.200]  the attack on the nsa today we don't know much about these two people um probably terrorists
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:14.960]  obviously it's a terrorist attack when you attack the nsa how great is the threat of
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:19.040]  lone wolf terrorism do you see right now and what should the country do about i think it's a serious
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:24.240]  threat in the in a world where we're so connected with the rest of the world we have people moving
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:29.360]  in and people moving out um okay pause out there for me to pause out not okay so it's a serious
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:34.000]  threat it's a lone wolf a wolf terrorist okay so we we know that because you know they attacked
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:39.200]  uh like the nsa and even though there was two of them it was a lone wolf i tell you what in
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:43.280]  washington if you get lost or if you get panicked just make sure you're not dressed as a woman you
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:46.400]  know make sure that you're dressed like a secret service agent because then you can crash the
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:50.800]  barricades and nothing is going to happen to you but of course we need he's going to go on and tell
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:56.400]  you how much we need the nsa but of course the nsa can't even protect themselves let's continue
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:00.560]  with that tape everybody gets to listen to your show to get all the information people get the
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:06.960]  information in different ways they get disaffected disillusioned uh prayed upon and so yeah i i i
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:11.440]  think that this is a ongoing threat and i hope that our counterintelligence capabilities are
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:16.960]  always vigilant i've always been nervous about the attacks on the nsa and somehow that we're
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:21.600]  losing our freedoms by keeping the homeland safe i think we need to be really vigilant that's where
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:25.760]  i was leading there is an element within our party and i'm a republican you're a republican
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:32.000]  that has grown snow nests in in certain ways and very very anti-surveillance but in a world
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.200]  where people are attacking the nsa i don't know that we have an alternative so how do you balance
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:39.440]  those two things out okay we'll be right back and play the rest of that clip for you stay with us

[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:21.120]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:27.520]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today we're going to be talking in
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:32.800]  the next segment too with uh joe biggs we're going to talk about uh what he found out about
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:38.400]  barrett brown of course barrett brown has had his emails suspended uh by the prison system
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:43.760]  for using it quote for the wrong thing you know talking to people that type of thing that's wrong
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:47.280]  we're going to talk to uh joe biggs about that because uh we we can break that down a little
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:53.280]  bit farther for you where it actually uh involves uh joe talking to him on the email uh but before
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:57.440]  i do i want to go back and finish up with this uh jeb bush tape that we had he was on the hu huat
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:01.920]  show and this is jeb bush talking about the nsa first they were they were talking about the
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:08.320]  attack that had just happened on the nsa as it was portrayed an attack it really wasn't an attack
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:13.760]  uh but the two men who were dressed up as women one uh both of them got shot one of them killed
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:19.760]  and of course it was an opportunity for hu huat and jeb bush to portray the nsa as
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:26.560]  helpless victims but at the same time they are going to protect us by their drag net
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:31.600]  surveillance and so bush goes on to make the case for drag net surveillance of the nsa let's
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:37.520]  continue with that clip i've always been nervous about the attacks on the nsa and somehow that
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:42.240]  we're losing our freedoms by keeping the homeland safe i think we need to be really vigilant that's
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:46.560]  where i was leading there is an element within our party and i'm a republican you're a republican
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:53.040]  that has grown snow nesq in in certain ways and very very anti surveillance but in a world where
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:56.160]  people are attacking the nsa i don't know that we have an alternative so how do you balance those
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:02:00.160]  two things out well first of all i think the president has to lead has to explain to people
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:05.120]  um he's actually enhanced the intelligence capabilities in many ways because technology's
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:09.680]  gotten better but he never defends it he never explains it he never tries to persuade people
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:15.200]  that their civil liberties are being protected by the systems we have in place oh catch that
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:21.120]  he hasn't obama hasn't owned this is the problem see if you were a bush you would go out there
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:26.880]  and you would talk about how we have this patriot act you know it's almost like uh
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:33.040]  as my son pointed out i was like oh look that acronym spells patriot must be a sign who would
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:39.120]  have thought this whole thing was a takedown of our legal system and we need to understand that
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:44.960]  this isn't about surveillance or not surveillance you're not allowed to surveil dragnet surveillance
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:51.760]  that's clear and of course uh uh they don't have a problem with it the bushes if he were obama
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:57.600]  he would embrace it he would brag about how the nsa is protecting our civil liberties
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:01.680]  let's have that discussion i would like to hear jeb bush explain how the nsa is protecting
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:06.480]  our civil liberties when they defy the law when they defy the fiza act when they defy
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:12.800]  every aspect of our protections under the constitution but they're protecting us
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:17.440]  look he always already gone on uh on record is saying that he thinks that the nsa is hugely
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:24.800]  important and like many other republicans like the now the uh it's uh uh bur from north carolina
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:28.880]  who is now the senate intelligence committee chairman he says he doesn't think there should
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:35.280]  ever be any oversight of anything that the nsa does and of course there's an article out from
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:40.720]  npr that jeb bush is self identified as an hispanic on his voter application in o nine well that
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:47.040]  tells you something about what his immigration policies are going to be but you know he is
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:53.200]  self identified as an authoritarian he has owned this even to the extent that in florida's new york
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:59.680]  times pointed out on march 21st he said that um he's got a plan that's called codenamed homeland
[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:07.040]  security and that's how he's going to neutralize homegrown threats to his campaign everything
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:13.440]  these guys do is a police state is absolutely obnoxious to think that our choice is going to
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:17.680]  probably be jeb bush or hillary clinton that is not a choice and that's why we're not going to
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:20.720]  change anything from washington and let me give you another reason why we're not going to change
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:27.200]  anything from washington sarah brady as you may have realized died this last weekend and of course
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:32.000]  you know this is unfortunately a life that has been spent in a misguided effort to try to bring
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:38.560]  some meaning to the tragedy uh of her husband's shooting but the thing i see when i look at this
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:46.000]  is how ronald reagan threw the second amendment under the bus because he wanted to help a friend
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:52.720]  and try to give some meaning to this suffering that's why we can't get this fixed in washington
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:57.520]  because ronald reagan doesn't appreciate the second amendment or any of the rest of the
[02:04:57.520 --> 02:05:00.640]  amendments with his civilized literature so everybody should be right back this recently
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:05.600]  started using your products everything he said about was correct me and my wife both use a lot
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:09.440]  of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives well thank you brothers because it also

[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:27.040]  joining me in the studio now is joe biggs i had mentioned in the last hour when i was talking to
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:34.000]  paul joes of watson that barrett brown and of course paul and joe and i had talked to barrett brown
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:39.520]  from prison we had talked to him on the phone and i just saw it with the weekend that they
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:45.120]  have suspended his email quote for using it for the wrong thing and when i mentioned that to paul
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:51.040]  joes of watson and the break joe biggs came in and told me he says yeah he was contacted by
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:57.040]  some of the people and they they asked him questions about tell us what you heard so i
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:09:02.960]  was speaking to some of the people on barrett brown side one of the guys is kevin gallagher who runs
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:08.320]  the free barrett brown accounts and all that for him and he said hey you're not going to be able to
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:12.880]  email with barrett anymore and i said why not i said well from what we've been told what we believe
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:17.120]  is because of his correspondence with you at info wars and what you've been talking about
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:24.160]  and the fact that he also set me up with another inmate who had bomb chill information about the
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:29.520]  bureau of prisons and a lot of the corruption going on there so the fact that he was corresponding
[02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:34.400]  with me and then putting me in contact with other prisoners who were trying to get their stories out
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:39.200]  they essentially cut his email off interesting because in the story on rt they point out that
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:44.720]  his access has been restricted for a full year until april of 2016 without explanation but
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:49.600]  while speaking to a supervisor brown was told that he lost his email privileges because he was quote
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:54.720]  using it for the wrong thing they say he was also talking to glenn greenwall from the intercept
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:10:00.400]  about the possibility of writing for his publication regular column and they restricted his email they
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:06.960]  say that according to their own policy in the bureau of prisons that inmates can send electronic
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:11.600]  messages but with the exception they prohibit or discontinuous operation if the individual inmates
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:16.880]  participation is determined to jeopardize the safety the security or the orderly operation the
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:23.040]  correctional facility i mean there's nothing i mean how are you going to do that with email i
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:27.680]  don't i don't really know i mean he's not trying to break out that's not him and i never spoke about
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:32.240]  anything that had to do with corruption within the prison system although he did mention the fact that
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:36.960]  when he was able to get out he would definitely have some things to speak about that and that's
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:41.440]  something that he would look forward to writing about doing more research into as a corruption
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:45.280]  in these prison systems but the main thing is the fact that you link me to this inmate who had
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:50.320]  been there for quite some time and like he said his words were just big information breaking news
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:56.400]  about massive corruption going on there so he was trying to you know we're playing a little cat
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:00.240]  and mouse back and forth he was getting me in contact with this guy back and forth and now
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:05.280]  they're thinking that's why because he was going to essentially give me a lot of information about
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:11.120]  what was going on there yeah absolutely and for those of you who don't know about barrett brown
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:16.480]  i don't know most many of our audience know a lot about him and perhaps some in our audience don't
[02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:22.880]  know anything about him when we talked about his case we had him call in and just to kind of summarize
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:27.440]  it very quickly it was a very egregious case i mean they were coming after him initially because he
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:33.040]  had linked to something because he had a link i mean that sets up all kinds of troubling precedents
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:37.520]  if you can go to jail just for linking to some documents that somebody else's time nobody had
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:42.000]  ever accused him of hacking strat for knowing anything about it he's simply a journalist
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:48.480]  he had written a lot about anonymous and he was in one of these articles he had linked to
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:53.200]  something that was there as a matter of fact his only involvement if you could say it was involvement
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:58.480]  was to offer to take a look at this document for on behalf of strat for make sure that nothing
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:04.800]  private got out that it was only information that the public should have in terms of their secret
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:10.000]  correspondence with government and with corporations conspiring to do dirty tricks with people and
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:13.440]  that's what people really wanted to see that's what anonymous was really about but of course they
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:17.600]  sent him to jail for that they sent him to jail they actually they eventually dropped that charge
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:22.400]  but then they accused him as i pointed out when i was talking to paul joseph watson of
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:28.480]  on making a comment on social media saying basically repeating what a fox news
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:33.280]  contractor had said calling for the assassination of julian assange and just verbatim repeated
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:37.200]  that and they said you're talking about an fbi agent so you're going to go to jail for threatening
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:43.520]  an fbi agent and then they also take his declaration of independence and file that away as evidence
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:48.560]  you know that he's this extremist patriot who loves a constitution i mean the fact that that
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:55.040]  is now a crime in our country shows you how out of control this country is going having a pocket
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:13:00.480]  copy of the declaration of independence the fbi said was evidence that barrett brown
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:07.280]  was an extremist okay a dangerous person and they refused to get that back to him yeah and and and
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:12.480]  it was part even of the uh plea bargain agreement that he made with them and the judge said well i
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:16.400]  think we can give it back and and he actually has the judge's orders he said he didn't talk to anybody
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:20.160]  about that for the longest time because he didn't think anyway would believe him and that's the problem
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:25.360]  just as we're talking about this case of this uh lawyer who was uh the judge got very vindictive
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:28.400]  in a divorce case he said you need to recuse yourself and he said i'm not going to do it and
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:33.520]  then he went after her she was alleges that she was tortured sexually molested and held for a very
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:37.600]  long period of time and the lawyers who looked at it said nobody's going to believe this that's the
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:42.560]  kind of country we live in well the problem since 2008 is we had a president who ran on the fact that
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:49.520]  he was going to be the most uh most transparent presidency ever yes and it has been 10 times
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:53.920]  worse in the bush administration by far yeah i mean they are going after whistleblowers they're
[02:13:53.920 --> 02:14:01.040]  going about after anybody who exposes corruption meanwhile they leave these criminals alone yes
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:05.360]  yes you know he is transparent though i mean it is the most transparently criminal organization
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:10.000]  that we've ever had uh every administration whether it's republican or democrat gets worse
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:15.840]  that's what scares me joe about the prospect of looking at a another bush or another clinton we
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:20.880]  know that it is going to rapidly go up and is if you heard that clip uh where jeb bush was talking
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:25.680]  to hu hu it saying well the biggest problem with the current administration is not that they've
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:32.080]  got dragnet spying on everybody but that obama isn't owning it and being proud of it because the
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:37.440]  republicans are proud of the police state that they have created the police state that william
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:42.720]  benney who was the top technical person globally at the nsa for decades said we have a police
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:48.240]  state and he's somebody who knows what a police state is he spent decades watching the schtazi
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:52.720]  watching the soviet union he knows exactly what a police state is and he says what we've got now
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:58.320]  is far more dangerous because of the technological leverage that they have yeah i agree completely
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:03.600]  i mean it within the past year alone since i've been here i mean it's just spiraled out of control
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:09.280]  yes yes that's the problem you know we have because we don't have any constraints over
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:15.120]  the people in government you know we're seeing exponential growth in tech and technology okay
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:19.120]  it is is rapidly and that's something that's been going on for decades what people don't realize
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:25.440]  that has also been going on for decades is the misapplication of that technology okay it is just
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:29.920]  so much that we've got artificial intelligence which can be targeted on a very specific population
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:36.800]  on a very specific problem or whatever is that we've got men of artificial integrity in office
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:41.360]  and they're going to misuse that that that technology that's what eisenhower warned us about
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:45.600]  he said that all the research was going to be taken over we talked about the military industrial
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:50.720]  complex he also talked about how all the research would be taken over by the universities of the
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:53.840]  university research would be taken over by the military industrial complex and they would turn
[02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:59.520]  the technology into a very dangerous purpose and that's what we see happening with DARPA research
[02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:05.520]  and they and the uh the weapons that they're creating i mean we have a criminal presidency
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:10.160]  in general i mean if you and i wanted to go to the white house tomorrow and if we were laid on
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:14.240]  taxes or anything like that we wouldn't be able to be around the president we would we wouldn't be
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:20.560]  able to be like within a hundred yards of him get set foot on white house property meanwhile
[02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:26.880]  you're allowed to bring in a criminal thug like al sharpton who owes millions of dollars so we
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:30.240]  have this criminal operation and then they're allowing criminals to come in there as well
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:34.880]  or you can have an al alalaki that dines at the pentagon multiple times and then he has to be one
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:39.280]  of our our first and highest profile drone assassinations you know he sets the precedent
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:44.720]  for because he's the person who is so dangerous all to be so dangerous why was he advising the
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:50.320]  pentagon on terrorism right it's because these guys are running both sides of it just like
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:54.240]  they ran both sides the war on drugs and continue to run both sides on the war on drugs i mean it's
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:58.400]  pretty obvious to everybody that they're funding the terrorists that they they tried to get this
[02:16:58.400 --> 02:17:02.080]  war going in syria now they've got it going in syria they've got it going in multiple places
[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:04.560]  you know one of the things that i thought was interesting joe i'll just throw this out get
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:10.080]  your comments on it antiwar.com had an article up talking about protesters in saudi arabia
[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:15.440]  protesting this war that saudi arabia has gotten involved when in yemen and i thought that was a
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:23.840]  pretty amazing thing they had two people killed 30 protesters wounded as saudi forces attack an
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:30.720]  antiwar rally i mean that is that shows you that in saudi arabia there are people that have the
[02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:34.240]  guts to stand up to an authoritarian state and you're not going to find an authoritarian state
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:41.280]  any worse than saudi arabia i mean i there are allies okay and they've had the best of our technology
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:46.640]  the best of our our help in terms of setting up just as we did in iran setting up the savak
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:50.240]  under the shaw it's only going to be a matter of time before something like that happens here when
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:54.160]  people start protesting i mean it happened before but on a much larger scale and then you have all
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:58.960]  these operations happening jade helm there's a dirty bomb exercise this saturday in california
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:04.560]  and richmond um there's another disaster um preparation thing that's going to be happening
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:09.440]  here in austin at the end of the month i mean all these drills are happening and it all looks
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:14.320]  like it's pushing in that martial law direction yes you know against you know public insurrection
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:18.640]  where people are standing up and quite frankly just piss off what the government's doing and
[02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:22.480]  it's going to get to a point where they start mowing down crowds of people out there yes
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:25.520]  using national guard using all these people and that's the scary thing i just hope it never
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:29.920]  gets to that point exactly as i look at this i think you know when i first saw this article i
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:35.680]  thought wow that that is a gutsy group of people to go into saudi arabia and stand up and protest
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:39.760]  because i mean you know people get flawed they get beheaded they get their hands cut off for
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:44.240]  virtually nothing in that country i mean they have you want to talk about the headings there's
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:50.880]  been more beheadings by our allies the saudis and they have from all the purported terrorist events
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:54.640]  even if those are all real and a lot of them look very much like they were manufactured
[02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:59.120]  most like you say you judge someone by the friends they keep around you know the people that we keep
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:05.520]  in our corner aren't really doing very great humanitarian type things and we're definitely
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:10.640]  becoming a reflection of that and if you don't punish the bad people in the crowd i mean that's
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:15.600]  the point i was making last when i was talking to uh paul joseph what's it as frank serpico said
[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:18.960]  police are like any other group when you pull people in you're going to have good people
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:22.160]  going to have bad people you can have bad journalists you can have bad police you can
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:28.560]  have good journalists or but if you don't purge it out then it becomes institutionalized then it
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:33.520]  becomes systemic and that's the whole issue too with this rolling stone situation because they
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:38.080]  did not do anything about it now they're opening themselves up for for legal issues but what do
[02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:42.480]  we do about an over the top police we're going to take your calls and we come back from the break

[02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:05.760]  of supermail vitality let's go to harvey in florida harvey uh you live in florida what do you
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:11.040]  think about jeb bush looks like that's what you want to talk about oh yeah i really want to this
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:17.360]  big about something else but you said that's like saying Niagara falls to me this this is uh the
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:25.840]  third generation of a nazi loving family and the nazis that took over this country i mean
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:33.440]  that tape that you had with him admitting how he loves the nsa because that protects the interest
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:40.000]  of the nazi ruling party that took over this country his father was in the cia which oversaw
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:47.280]  the building up of the police state through the nsa and the one time we ever needed the nsa which
[02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:52.080]  is to prevent 9 11 and things like that well there was no way to be found because their job
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:58.640]  was really to protect the interest of the people like bush what do you think about that oh absolutely
[02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:04.160]  and if you hear that clip between him and you hear it right after the shooting at the nsa and
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:07.440]  of course we said the shooting at the nsa it sounds like they were shooting at the nsa it was
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:10.960]  nsa that was shooting the the security guards that were shooting at them but of course you know
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:15.120]  they're they're trumping that up saying how this is why we need to have this dragnet surveillance
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:19.600]  at state look it is not to protect your civil liberties as jeb bush says anybody that believes
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:26.480]  that is a blithering idiot this doesn't protect anybody's civil liberties it destroys your civil
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:31.920]  liberties it destroys the rule of law even if they were to stay within the confines of the
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:38.080]  foreign intelligence surveillance act which was put in place because of the exposures of what the
[02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:43.840]  cia was doing by frank church and guess who they got in place after they got rid of some of the
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:49.120]  people at the cia it was george hw bush he went into the cia he was the guy that they put in to
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:55.360]  rebuild any and and to get around any restrictions that were put in there look anybody that buys that
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:01.760]  you can sell them a brooklyn bridge or anything that's absolutely absurd and obnoxious to hear
[02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:05.440]  that kind of talk coming from jeb bush but of course what do you expect from somebody that
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:09.840]  talks about his campaign as homeland security and how they're going to take out homegrown
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:15.760]  threats to his campaign i tell you harvey i was done with jeb bush and his brother and i think
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:21.120]  most people should be done with them i mean well for a long time but i'll just say this the christians
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:27.280]  should get a clue when they watch the way these two guys behaved in the terry shavo case if you
[02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:32.480]  want to give these guys a pass and say you know i don't really care how they destroy the rule of
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:38.000]  law because i know the bush family are good christians i mean i've heard christians tell me that
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:44.320]  and it's like you know they don't realize what they have done but we don't need a system
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:49.760]  that needs good men in place to work we need to make sure that we got a system of checks and balances
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:54.880]  and the bush family has done more than anybody else except maybe the clinton's to destroy that
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:59.040]  of course obama's been pretty active too every one of these presidents but he's not going to
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:03.200]  do anything to restore that and i gotta say that anybody that believes all these funny stories
[02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:09.600]  about their evangelical experiences need to look at the fruit of what came out of these two guys
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:15.520]  look at how they allowed a probate judge to shut off food and water to a dying woman against the
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:21.040]  wishes of half of her family what would it hurt to give that woman food and water yet they arrested
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:26.160]  people who want to do that what are your comments harvey you know anything about the history of jeb bush
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:33.520]  you know he traded on his family's connections and his family's wealth that was all generated by
[02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:39.840]  the police state that he was in nigerian water pump salesman looked that up to do a google search
[02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:46.560]  for the nigerian jeb bush the water pump salesman to nigeria inside dealing inside trading
[02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:53.520]  trading accused of a tremendous crime there he also was involved with the sunrise savings and loan
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:29:00.080]  where he he shiced it up buildings he is he there's a typical guy that was born on third base
[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:05.760]  and thinks he had a home run yeah he's an inside real deal at trading on his family's wealth and
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:13.040]  these are nothing but a literally literally a third generation nazi scumbag that's what we're
[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:18.000]  dealing with yes and you're talking about the show is facing public he should be pillory and
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:24.240]  you're talking about the connections that his uh that george h.w. bush's father had uh with avril
[02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:29.600]  herman and the uh nazi financing yeah people need to take a look at the panama deception and they
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:33.760]  also need to take a look at this new documentary the man the journalist i think or the writer the
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:39.840]  writer with no hands look that trailer up that's an interesting premise about what maybe was behind

[02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:27.360]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex joe
[02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:36.640]  welcome back to the alex johnson on david night your host today we're going to go back to your
[02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:41.520]  calls uh shon frank andrew steven hang on it would be right with you before i go back i want to
[02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:44.960]  just mention this article that i saw that i thought was kind of interesting out of the
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:51.920]  atlantic how red states learn to love the gas tax and of course uh as soon as the price of oil
[02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:57.840]  dropped precipitously alex jones said they're going to use this to put taxes on you and that's
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:02.320]  what's happening and it's coming from guess what republican states because you know what
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:06.400]  they're looking for ways to grow government they're not looking for ways to cut spending
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:12.320]  they're looking ways for ways to fund ever-increasing spending they're not about limited government
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:16.240]  let me give you an example they point out in the atlantic a month ago iowa's republican governor
[02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:20.960]  terry brandstad approved a gas tax hike that sailed through the legislature in under two weeks
[02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:27.440]  top republicans in georgia michigan and south dakota have also proposed similar increases see
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:32.400]  while the taxes are down while the while the price of oil is down they're going to ramp up the taxes
[02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:37.760]  hoping that you're not going to notice it oh well it's not quite as cheap as it was last week but
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:42.080]  hey it's still cheaper than it was a few months ago so that's cool they say as many as 12 states
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:48.560]  could raise fuel taxes in 2015 alone after six did so in just the last two years they said this is
[02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:52.800]  a breakthrough for many states that have gone more than 20 years without touching the levy on
[02:34:52.800 --> 02:35:00.560]  gasoline yeah thank you saudis now we can ramp it up at the pump in terms of taxes but they say
[02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:05.040]  the most interesting thing from the standpoint of the atlantic is that hey this isn't really
[02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:10.800]  causing any discussion in these red states and these republican states there is no debate they
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:17.200]  said there's no ideological fight even though the utah taxpayer association uh even was a main
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:23.120]  opposition to increasing the gas tax it didn't happen okay this is still getting rammed through
[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:27.680]  now the reason this is happening is because they're pushing this through and saying this is what
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:32.320]  the republicans are saying the users of the system need to be the ones that pay for the system i
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:38.400]  believe that's a core republican principle yeah that's true that's true if that were the way that the
[02:35:39.440 --> 02:35:43.600]  that the money was going to be used but we know in state after state after state they hike up the
[02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:50.080]  gas taxes and they don't spend it all on improving the roads or the bridges they divert it to other
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:55.760]  areas because you know what is also another republican principle bait and switch that's
[02:35:55.760 --> 02:36:00.240]  something that they really have down okay let's go to uh shon and trinidad shon
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:09.600]  hi david um thanks for taking my call i really love the show you all guys um you all you all
[02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:15.680]  have because um i've been been how i can put this been taking a very very very close look
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:23.920]  at united states for the last year and i've i gotta say america has the most
[02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:31.440]  divisive president ever what i mean by that is we look at the rise of of of this this field
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:37.840]  between white and black so it avoided his panics the persecution of the church with this homosexual
[02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:46.880]  agenda and and supposed religious freedom for muslim we look at um basically funding both sides
[02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:52.720]  of all all these walls that happen in the middle east where they back the iranian troops in iraq
[02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:59.520]  and then back Saudi Arabia in in fighting the hoofies in in emn washiite in terms of the allegiance
[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:06.640]  and there's only one way i can look at this david um i'm a christian um as you know the name of my
[02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:11.840]  country trial and to be with for my christian for columbus in your representation of the trinity
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:17.840]  god the father son and the holy spirit and there's only one way i could see this i i viewed that video
[02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:23.680]  y'all did with jaroslyn they're talking about his predictions or whatnot or his trends in 2009
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:31.840]  and i don't know when would the christians realize and give credit or credit is due to the
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:37.600]  prophets of the bible thousands of years ago of all these things that you are seeing playing out
[02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:44.640]  a day in front of our very eyes oh yeah absolutely we can't see it and what i really call talked about
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:50.880]  is um what i call to talk about is that deal this this this supposed agreement with the u.s and iran
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:56.880]  this reminded me of um i'm very young that a young student of history and it reminded me of
[02:37:56.880 --> 02:38:02.800]  never chamberlain right within a year time of supposed this peace agreement with the nazis
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:10.800]  won't won't the world at war with the nazis right yes and honestly speaking like i said i can only
[02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:18.480]  see this thing one way when you look at obama's policy towards the his forest his foreign policy
[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:25.680]  and the way he deals with the u.s his agenda lines perfectly with erdoğan of turkey look at the way
[02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:31.040]  he treats he treats with egypt where they try to install in muslim brotherhood as the head of
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:37.360]  of governance and they were the military had to step in and and boot them out look at the way
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:43.920]  what went on with libya the whole destruction of of gadafi and his regime and supposedly that was
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:50.000]  a success according to obama yeah exactly when they got all the arms you bring up an interesting
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:55.600]  point because you know i think one of my problems that i have had with obama even before he got
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:39:00.640]  elected president was the fact that he had grown up for and spent a great deal of time his formative
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:07.040]  years in a foreign country uh going to a muslim school so even if he had a an american mother
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:12.800]  where he was raised was a very different kind of value system let's just put it that way
[02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:18.320]  and and did not grow up in america so he doesn't have the kind of um and i think we've now seen
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:25.680]  this in his presidency that he doesn't have uh the kind of appreciation or love for the rule of
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:30.640]  law for this country's history uh he really does come across as a foreign president and that
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:34.400]  shouldn't be a surprise anybody he grew up outside of the country and i i think we need to look at
[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:39.200]  that the whole idea that we need to have a natural born citizen for president it's not that we got an
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:44.240]  issue with somebody that's uh uh from indonesia or we got an issue with somebody who's a canadian
[02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:48.800]  citizen like ted cruz it's just they need to grow up in america they need to have america they have
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:52.800]  need to have a a stake in the country and i think it's kind of interesting when you look at what's
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:58.800]  going on now with bloomberg saying he's going to run for mayor of london i mean this is the way that
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:03.920]  they're using musical shares the chairs to move these politicians around i think this is something's
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:08.160]  being done obviously with people have a globalist agenda that want to get everybody used to the
[02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:13.360]  idea that you don't really need to have anybody that grew up in your area that really uh is is
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:18.720]  embedded in your culture in your history to represent you you can just pick and choose
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:24.320]  from anywhere in the world to make this guy president or make this guy uh the mayor of london
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:30.480]  that really concerns me and i think we're seeing that of course there's also valerie jared who was
[02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:35.680]  born in iran i don't know how long she spent in iran she's essentially the power behind the throne
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:41.760]  just like kissinger was behind nixon or zigg as a big new burjinsky was behind carter uh she's
[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:46.560]  basically calling the shots there and she grew up in uh or spent a good deal of time in iran her
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:53.280]  father uh left the us because he really did not like the he hated the us he felt that he'd been
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:56.800]  discriminated against as a black man so he took his family and he went to iran that's where she
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:00.880]  was born i don't know how long she spent there but she has a lot of connections especially on her
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:08.240]  mother's side there's a small chicago mafia that um hangs out really around the educational
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:13.280]  institutions there that bill errs is a part of uh so you've got that mafia there that's this a
[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:17.360]  little bit different from the clinton mafia the clinton mafia was about drug running and
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:22.160]  power and money and killing anybody that got in their way but this this mafia they they do all
[02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:27.200]  that as well but they really seem to have a visceral hatred for america seems like to me i
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:32.880]  don't know just looking at it that's my opinion what do you think uh shan yeah that's very true
[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:39.200]  and i was going to say make that exact point especially look at who mavedin look at valerijer
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:44.080]  look at that how closely muslim brotherhood has gotten into the white house look at what what happened
[02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:51.680]  with um burbuk dal like the guy who deserted and for his release they released five guys from from
[02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:56.960]  get no well known as lamestor whatnot yeah and it came out that they really didn't they really
[02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:03.040]  didn't want burbuk dal necessarily they they took him as kind of a beard that came out after the
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:06.000]  fact that's kind of the way they're pushing back on this but sorry go ahead finish up with what you
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:10.560]  wanted to say yeah so basically what what i wanted to say is this i could only look at this one way
[02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:19.040]  biblically and this is something that is going to happen very soon close quicker than most my
[02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:23.920]  thing i can't put a time to it but i believe it's going to be very very very soon and the
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:30.640]  reason why i say that is that this new feud between sunnis and shia it's in the middle east
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:37.280]  that is being fueled will culminate into something very very serious and disastrous for
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:43.120]  saudi arabia right and what i mean by that is that what do you think john the revelator was
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:48.640]  talking about when he when he got his dream that he was took he was taken manage on to the
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:56.560]  into the wilderness into the desert by the red sea where he talked about the harlot of Babylon
[02:42:57.280 --> 02:43:03.600]  where he talked about all the nations of the world sip of a wine from a cup of fornication
[02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:12.480]  what do you think that wine is it's oil oil it's all about oil and he described basically he'll
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:18.720]  come in destruction and this is exactly where it's going he's nice they have talked about it where he
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:25.120]  said and the streams of either he don't shall be turned to pitch the soil to sulfur a land shall
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:32.400]  become burning pitch night and day it shall not be quench and its smoke shall go forever from
[02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:40.960]  generation to generation it shall lie with no one shall pass through it forever and ever yeah it's
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:45.600]  interesting you know that there as you point out there's a lot of things that are lining up with that
[02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:49.520]  and you know unfortunately we've got a lot of people who will look at that and say great that
[02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:55.520]  means that the the end of the world is about to come and i'm going to get raptured out of here so
[02:43:55.520 --> 02:44:00.080]  i'm just going to sit back and not do anything about it and i'm reminded of what martin luther
[02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:04.720]  said he said if i knew i was going to die tomorrow i would still plant a tree today we do the right
[02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:09.760]  thing because it's the right thing to do we don't do it to ingratiate ourselves to god we can't earn
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:13.680]  that and we got the globalists who think that they can buy eternal life that was the top of
[02:44:13.680 --> 02:44:18.400]  drudge on estra there's a great placement for drudge to show these globalists who are out there
[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:23.360]  thinking that with their research they're going to somehow extend their life perhaps forever
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:28.400]  isn't going to happen you can't earn it you can't buy it it's a free gift from the god that they
[02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:33.200]  want acknowledge exists but you know i think in terms of time thank you shon i'm going to
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:36.480]  go on i want to get some of the other people i think in terms of time frame they've been talking
[02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:43.360]  about 2020 and 2025 for a very long time and a lot of this stuff could actually happen by then or
[02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:47.040]  even before then we never know let's go to uh frank and north carolina frank
[02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:54.080]  yeah david um you know i keep hearing all these comments from all different directions about
[02:44:54.080 --> 02:45:00.240]  um this rolling stones report and uh i guess it's become a scandal and the journalists
[02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:05.440]  isn't going to be fired and then you got lyon brian williams out there some revelations have come
[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:12.800]  come about on on his integrity and whatnot and and i just uh you know as far as the shortcomings of
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:17.520]  the uh you know state of the integrity and journalism today i mean the media in general
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:24.400]  has been tainted i think forever um because you know it's it's like an agenda driven farce
[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:31.040]  every day in the media uh and you got all these establishment uh you know cheerleader type sycopants
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:35.120]  who you know they're on the payroll so they're gonna they're gonna go along with the official
[02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:42.880]  narrative uh and and uh and everything that really comes out all the major you know driving
[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:48.080]  agendas they're they're complicit on it because they want to keep getting a paycheck and i mean
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:54.720]  the most obvious most obvious example of this is uh the the complicity of the complicity of the
[02:45:54.720 --> 02:46:01.600]  media and the false flag of 9 11 i think that's coming up on the 14th anniversary and uh you
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:06.800]  know the media has already i mean you know you hear people in the media radio hosts and different
[02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:10.640]  people in the mainstream media people on tv saying well you know lyon brian williams and
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:15.520]  uh you know this rolling stones article and then they they act like they're they just can't believe
[02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:21.920]  that the rolling stones would uh you know sacrifice their integrity like that and i'm like there is
[02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:26.560]  no integrity in the mainstream media man you guys lost that a long time ago i'm speaking to the
[02:46:26.560 --> 02:46:32.960]  people in the mainstream media out there and uh well just look at what they recently did in terms of
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:38.080]  as you had these mandatory vaccination bills pushing their way through uh different state
[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:42.400]  legislatures unfortunately at least two of them have been shut down uh we'll have to see if they're
[02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:46.480]  going to come back in a in another form i'm sure they'll keep trying but of course you've got uh
[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:52.160]  meghan kelly on fox news saying hey hey it sounds like a big brother it is but sometimes you need
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:58.320]  big brother you know when you need big brother is when your corporate sponsors big pharma own you
[02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:04.640]  like they do fox news and that's why they push that kind of stuff and that's why they misrepresent
[02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:09.600]  what the real concerns are the real concerns are it isn't that we don't understand what vaccines are
[02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:14.400]  we know exactly what past what active immunity was about we know what passive immunity was about
[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:19.840]  that's what we saw people getting these convalescent injections uh in the wake of being exposed to ebola
[02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:24.160]  and of course active immunity is what vaccines were about the theory behind that is sound
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:29.520]  except that now they have added all these different preservatives and adjuvants to it and when you
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:34.240]  start adding things like aluminum and mercury and formaldehyde and all this other kind of stuff
[02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:39.520]  now you don't simply have just a vaccine but they don't want to talk about that they don't
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:43.120]  want to have that discussion instead it's like just shut up you're a bunch of ignorant people
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:47.680]  who don't understand how vaccines work and then they push that because that's what their corporate
[02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:53.840]  sponsors want there's something that people have to keep in the back of their mind is the powers that
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:58.720]  be the elite at the top you always have to keep in the back of your mind what is always on their
[02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:03.840]  mind population control they have to control the population through whatever means necessary
[02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:09.680]  sterility war uh propaganda you know first they'll try to win your hearts and minds if they can't
[02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:13.600]  do that then they will neutralize you and they'll take you down and i i think you really hit it i
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:18.720]  mean that really is what is at the forefront of their mind they know that they're going to be
[02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:26.080]  automating 50 or more of the jobs out of existence are we going to have that many more jobs set up
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:30.720]  to create robots no we're going to have massive unemployment you're not going to be able to
[02:48:30.720 --> 02:48:35.440]  reposition everybody for 50 of the jobs and of course the people that are going to be losing it
[02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:39.280]  are going to be at the bottom rung the people who are working in the fast food restaurants or the
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:43.840]  people who are working for the most part in the transportation industry that's going to really be
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:50.160]  hit hard with these self-driving autonomous uh trucks and that sort of thing so it's going to
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:55.600]  be massive unemployment so how do they do that they have to pacify and control us or they have to
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:49:00.240]  eliminate us you're exactly right thank you frank i want to get everybody that's queued up here on
[02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:10.640]  thank you so much let's go to uh andrew and iowa andrew go ahead hello hey um i have a idea for
[02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:17.760]  a nationwide movement i don't expect we'll like fix everything or anything like that but it may
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:24.400]  get them you know raising their eyebrows a little bit and being a little more concerned with how
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:29.520]  blatant they are about doing things okay quick like because we're coming up to a break we've got
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:36.240]  about uh you got about 45 seconds lay it out for us okay um really quick i think that everyone who
[02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:42.640]  listens to this broadcast should go out like the tea party movement and protest the corruption i don't
[02:49:42.640 --> 02:49:48.160]  want it to like turn into anything that Ferguson was like but i want like a peaceful movement that
[02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:56.320]  protest all the tyrannical stuff the fcc and the internet the excuse me the gun grabbing everything
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:50:02.320]  else you know oh yeah i agree i agree but i think there's more proactive things that we can do i
[02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:06.000]  think if we can educate people i think one of the ways that we can really shut down these
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:11.680]  criminal laws and take back our freedom is to do it one at a time with jury nullification think
[02:50:11.680 --> 02:50:18.160]  about it if you've got one person out of 12 we can call that the eight percent solution okay one
[02:50:18.160 --> 02:50:24.720]  person out of 12 can shut down bad laws shut down criminal uh uh applications of these laws
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:29.360]  excessive fines and punishments you can look at how they're going to use this you can look at the
[02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:34.240]  law and not just the facts of the case that's why juries were established go back and read the
[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:39.040]  founding fathers you can understand where that is i think we can nullify them especially at their
[02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:43.760]  jury level because you can get state and federal laws there we need to take back the jury system
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:49.120]  from the corrupt courts that have taken it from us and we need to take back the power at the state
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:53.280]  to shut down this criminal government we call the federal government stay with us i'm gonna go back

[02:54:20.240 --> 02:54:26.560]  need to find a peaceful solution and of course demonstrations are always good i mean people
[02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:32.800]  demonstrated at the bundy range for example but there was also a clear cut goal they were also
[02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:36.320]  fed up with what the government was doing to their friends and neighbors and they were going to put
[02:54:36.320 --> 02:54:40.960]  it all on the line when you stand up to the federal government when you refuse to be bullied
[02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:47.920]  when you refuse to allow them to shut down our legal system they will back down we've seen it over
[02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:52.480]  and over again typically usually they only make an exception for the one person who is challenging
[02:54:52.480 --> 02:54:56.720]  them that's what we've seen from the farmer in michigan at bakers green acres that's what we saw
[02:54:56.720 --> 02:55:01.840]  the bundy ranch we see that over and over again with corbett who was fighting the tsa
[02:55:01.840 --> 02:55:07.120]  tsa but we need to collectively stand up for our individual rights and one of the ways we
[02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:12.960]  can do as i mentioned was with the uh fully informed jury inform people of what their real
[02:55:12.960 --> 02:55:17.920]  duty responsibility and rights are as a juror and that is to watch the back of each other
[02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:22.640]  we've seen that work as well and that is a very important peaceful solution
[02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:28.720]  that you can do now of course you can also i think have much more effect at the state level
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:32.560]  then you're going to have at the federal government example of this is the bill that was
[02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:37.200]  just signed in kansas city in kansas this is kansas city star reporting it governor brown back
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:43.520]  as alex pointed out last week signed the bill to allow constitutional carry in kansas that's the
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:50.960]  fifth state allowing that so you can establish your rights at the state level and you can also
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:55.520]  refuse to send people to jail uh when the government attacks their rights if you don't
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:58.480]  like the way the government is coming at them if you don't like the way they collected the
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:03.360]  evidence if you don't like the penalties that they're going to expose them to if you think
[02:56:03.360 --> 02:56:09.520]  that's excessive you have a right to shut that down to let that person walk and you have a duty
[02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:16.560]  to do that that's called jury nullification and what you're seeing happening here in these
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:22.480]  various states in terms of gun bills that's called constitutional carry that's at the state level
[02:56:22.480 --> 02:56:27.600]  supporting what they will not do at the federal level i want to go back to your calls but just
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:32.560]  one more story here and that is i you know i saw this story came out of india about how they're
[02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:37.440]  now going to start using drones for crowd control of course this is the kind of thing that we're
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:41.520]  going to see here in america but it's going to be much more sophisticated much more heinous in terms
[02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:47.280]  of crime control we're talking early about the situation in panama we saw some of that type
[02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:52.000]  of stuff used for the panama invasion down there they've got a lot of really horrific stuff that's
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:56.960]  been developed by darpa but now in india in the place called look now they're going to have drones
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:00.800]  they have the capacity to carry two kilograms of weight and what are they going to do with that
[02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:06.640]  well they're going to put pepper spray pepper powder in that so they can shower the crowd with
[02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:11.840]  that if they don't disperse if they want to redress their government if they want to protest they
[02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:17.280]  just drop the pepper spray on it and when i saw that i saw the drones i had just seen a couple
[02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:22.720]  of days earlier a picture of somebody using a small drone to herd sheep instead of a border collie
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:28.240]  and i've got a border collie so they got my attention but when i looked at that and i looked
[02:57:28.240 --> 02:57:36.080]  at this article here it made me think about how much contempt our governments have for the people
[02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:42.560]  that they think of as sheep if you had had a drone and it was dropping pepper spray on the sheep
[02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:47.920]  that didn't get into place you would have the animal rights activists outraged about that
[02:57:47.920 --> 02:57:52.240]  and i think they should be but if they drop it on the people i'm sure they deserved it
[02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:56.880]  that's the kind of attitude we see that's the kind of attitude that supports the police state
[02:57:56.880 --> 02:58:01.440]  that's the kind of attitude that we need to shut down yeah your government does not love you
[02:58:01.440 --> 02:58:06.480]  they think less of you than they do the real sheep uh let's go quickly to slim in canada
[02:58:06.480 --> 02:58:10.400]  slim you said you've got some canadian legislation i want to give people in canada a chance to hear

[03:00:18.400 --> 03:00:24.160]  i wanted to go into this next segment and take as many of our calls as we get slim david russ i
[03:00:24.160 --> 03:00:29.280]  think we'll get through you guys let's go back to slim he's in canada and there is a bill c51
[03:00:29.280 --> 03:00:33.920]  that we didn't have time to lay down for people that's coming up for the canadian legislature
[03:00:33.920 --> 03:00:39.680]  tell us about that well there's many many many aspects to it i mean i'm i don't want to take
[03:00:39.680 --> 03:00:43.520]  up too much of your time and so they're going to explain the bill i'm sure all your canadian
[03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:49.280]  listeners know well you know that this is a bill that's not going to help any of us it's just going
[03:00:49.280 --> 03:00:54.720]  to make you know a lot more restrictions going to make your ndaa look like uh i don't know probably
[03:00:55.360 --> 03:01:00.880]  probably the same thing it'll be grounds because i know that there's some examples of uh for example
[03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:08.000]  that uh that one one gentleman for example was a arab canadian and he wrote he wrote a text message
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:14.640]  to uh a co-worker that this particular item that he has is going to blow the competition away
[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:21.200]  this person was sent in to the uh i don't know i guess our ccis or our cia or whatever it may be
[03:01:21.200 --> 03:01:26.080]  and he was questioned for a whole day because of the fact that he was blown away as a text
[03:01:26.080 --> 03:01:32.400]  so i mean that yeah we've seen that before with our own our own top notch security forces getting
[03:01:32.400 --> 03:01:36.720]  some people that were coming in this country from uh england and uh they were talking about how they
[03:01:36.720 --> 03:01:41.200]  were going to go dig up maryland munroe and uh in la and they were just joking but of course they
[03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:45.040]  took that seriously eventually uh through those people out of the country wouldn't let them in
[03:01:45.040 --> 03:01:50.960]  or so yeah there's there's all kinds of as we pointed out before they will social media as juliana
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:54.880]  sign said it's having all of your friends wearing a wire for the government and they will take what
[03:01:54.880 --> 03:02:00.960]  you say and take it out of context many times that's malicious many times that is just idiotic as you
[03:02:00.960 --> 03:02:07.520]  just pointed out so c51 is some kind of a uh reported uh anti-terrorism bill or state security
[03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:14.160]  bill that gives them broad police powers let me guess the front that's the front that they want
[03:02:14.160 --> 03:02:18.880]  to do yeah so i want to make it look like it's terrorism yes i mean they had this false flag
[03:02:18.880 --> 03:02:25.840]  where this one you know a guy that was drugged up win and and shot a shot a guy that was you know
[03:02:25.840 --> 03:02:31.520]  that was holding post in our in our parliament area and then he went into the part uh went into
[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:38.320]  parliament the the building and everybody miraculously was was you know basically stationed in the
[03:02:38.320 --> 03:02:43.840]  perfect position when the guy walked in and then all of a sudden this eighty seven-year-old man
[03:02:43.840 --> 03:02:49.120]  you know made this uh james bond move where he jumped around and it was just all you can tell
[03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:55.760]  it was a false flag and now this is the results i mean you know you guys had your not eleven
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:03:02.320]  obviously a word out a shout out there to people in canada look out for a c51 as a possibly a front
[03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:05.760]  as they're constantly using this to take your freedoms thank you slim for giving us that heads
[03:03:05.760 --> 03:03:09.600]  up uh let's go to david in california david you said you want to talk about barrett brown
[03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:15.840]  we mentioned earlier that his emails have been shut down inside a prison go ahead okay yeah i just
[03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:20.880]  wanted to pose a question to you in the audience i was wondering if anyone is considered that bob
[03:03:20.880 --> 03:03:28.080]  beckle who was too barrett brown was quoting has been considered an agent since they claimed that
[03:03:28.080 --> 03:03:33.840]  an agent was threatened by barrett brown's tweet that's a good point if there's anything that an
[03:03:33.840 --> 03:03:39.680]  agent was uh was threatened by that then uh then was it bob beckle who is the agent well
[03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:44.240]  clearly we know that uh fox news is an agent for the federal government i mean if you don't
[03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:47.920]  understand that you haven't been paying attention i mean they will take the government line on or
[03:03:47.920 --> 03:03:53.440]  the corporate line on whatever is necessary just as meghan kelly said uh yeah we want big brother
[03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:58.560]  when it comes to certain things when it comes to things that are pocketbook issues for the for news
[03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:05.360]  core but of course they will also spin and twist and misrepresent things like the exposure of jade
[03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:10.400]  helm saying that we had said that it was some secret document that only we had access to we
[03:04:10.400 --> 03:04:14.720]  never said that we also never said that they were going to go live with it many people are concerned
[03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:19.360]  about that we should always understand that that's a possibility personally i don't think it will
[03:04:19.360 --> 03:04:24.080]  happen with the very first one if people stay uh alert about it if it stays in the news but you
[03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:29.040]  always have to understand that that's a possibility i think it is an inevitability that something like
[03:04:29.040 --> 03:04:35.680]  that will happen if we don't stop the inexorable or the the continuous it isn't inexorable we can
[03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:40.880]  stop it but it is continuing down this path of a police state and they are going to use it to round
[03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:44.640]  up dissidents in this country and in other countries and we should be opposed to it even
[03:04:44.640 --> 03:04:47.920]  if they're doing that type of thing that they did in fort lauderdale in other countries well that's
[03:04:47.920 --> 03:04:57.680]  it for our news join us tonight at seven central eight p.m. eastern for the nightly news
