[00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:05.233]  And on Friday I stood up and said I don't appreciate the speculation about Don Rumsfeld.
[00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:06.394]  He's doing a fine job.
[00:00:06.394 --> 00:00:07.555]  I strongly support him.
[00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:13.640]  But what do you say to critics who believe that you're ignoring the advice of retired generals, military commanders, who say that there needs to be a change?
[00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:52.245]  Me and Remy's here and he's free and we are all together See the world run when Dick shoots his gun See how I lie I'm lying Sitting on my own brain Waiting for the end of days
[00:00:54.377 --> 00:00:57.079]  Corporation profits, bloody oil money.
[00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.002]  I'm above the law and I'll decide what's right or wrong.
[00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:04.643]  I am the egghead.
[00:01:04.643 --> 00:01:07.365]  I'm the commander.
[00:01:07.365 --> 00:01:09.306]  I'm the decider.
[00:01:09.306 --> 00:01:10.687]  Cuckoo, ca-choo.
[00:01:10.687 --> 00:01:13.429]  Back that city, policemen sitting.
[00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:18.792]  Pretty little targets in a row.
[00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:21.314]  See how they die when shrapnel flies.
[00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:22.515]  See mothers cry.
[00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.491]  Yellowcake Petroleum.
[00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:48.473]  Imaginary WMDs.
[00:01:48.473 --> 00:01:56.256]  They classify and fax, exposing secret agents, tax credit for the wealthy, leaving all the poor behind.
[00:01:56.256 --> 00:01:58.897]  I am the egghead.
[00:01:58.897 --> 00:02:00.218]  I'm the commander.
[00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:03.503]  I'm the decider!
[00:02:03.503 --> 00:02:04.704]  Cuckoo, ca-choo!
[00:02:04.704 --> 00:02:06.705]  I'm the decider, and I decide what is best.
[00:02:06.705 --> 00:02:10.388]  And what's best is for Don Rumsfeld to remain as the Secretary of Defense.
[00:02:10.388 --> 00:02:17.454]  Sitting in a White House garden, talking to the Lord.
[00:02:17.454 --> 00:02:23.379]  But my thoughts would be busy, busy hatching if I only had a brain.
[00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.000]  I am the egghead.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.302]  I'm the commander.
[00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.671]  We've got different reputations at stake.
[00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:33.551]  I say I listen to all voices.
[00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:35.592]  It reminds me of my own decision.
[00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:37.694]  And Don Rumsfeld is doing a fine job.
[00:02:37.694 --> 00:02:41.475]  He's not only transforming the military, he's fighting a war on terror.
[00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:43.696]  He's helping us fight a war on terror.
[00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.677]  I have strong confidence in Don Rumsfeld.
[00:02:45.677 --> 00:02:49.279]  I hear the voices, and I read the front page, and I know the speculation.
[00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:55.422]  But I'm the decider, and I decide what's best for Don Rumsfeld.
[00:02:56.863 --> 00:02:57.144]  We're good.
