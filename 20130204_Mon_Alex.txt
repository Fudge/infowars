[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:28.920]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:28.920 --> 00:36.520]  Here we are, Monday, already the fourth day of February, 2013. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:36.520 --> 00:43.440]  All right, here's what's going to happen. We've got Lord Monckton, who is over in Australia,
[00:43.440 --> 00:48.880]  popping in for 30 minutes at the tail end of the broadcast today. He's going to be joining
[00:48.880 --> 00:56.760]  us to talk about agenda 21, four or five years ahead of us, because Australia, more than
[00:56.760 --> 01:02.800]  any other country, except for maybe England, is implementing this neo-feudalistic form
[01:02.800 --> 01:03.800]  of serfdom.
[01:03.800 --> 01:09.440]  And that's the UN's own words. They've called for a fake environmentalism to bring in serfdom
[01:09.440 --> 01:23.640]  to control the population. So that's coming up. Now, we are going to open the phones up
[01:23.640 --> 01:30.840]  and take your phone calls here today as well. Yesterday, on the Sunday broadcast, I said
[01:30.840 --> 01:39.560]  that I was going to cover the mysterious death of Chris Kyle, the highly decorated Navy SEAL,
[01:39.560 --> 01:44.680]  who was involved in all sorts of clandestine black ops, obviously, and wrote the Navy's
[01:44.680 --> 01:48.240]  official sniper manual, their new sniper manual.
[01:48.240 --> 01:52.640]  They didn't have one previous to that. They used the Marine Corps sniper manual. But he
[01:52.640 --> 01:57.880]  wrote an updated manual, and he was deep into the system, obviously, and was the head trainer
[01:57.880 --> 02:03.400]  for the Navy SEALs in their sharpshooting program. We saw the Navy SEALs helicopter
[02:03.400 --> 02:08.040]  and SEAL Team 6 blow up with 20-something of them aboard. We saw the other helicopter
[02:08.040 --> 02:10.560]  blow up in the fake bin Laden raid.
[02:10.560 --> 02:16.140]  So much of this is domestic shy ops. And the SEALs more and more are used as a political
[02:16.140 --> 02:23.520]  core with the new SEAL Team 6 Zero Dark Thirty movie, which they admit is basically fiction.
[02:23.520 --> 02:28.700]  We're being bombarded with lies. And I gotta tell you, the fact that he was pushing to
[02:28.700 --> 02:35.520]  put guns in schools and armed teachers, and the fact that he knew so many secrets, and
[02:35.520 --> 02:39.360]  then somebody he takes up to the range with PTSD trying to help him.
[02:39.360 --> 02:43.680]  That's the story we're told. We don't know if any of this is true. We're being told this
[02:43.680 --> 02:49.280]  by the government, and then he's killed. You see, I'm not a conspiracy theorist in the
[02:49.280 --> 02:57.400]  way the media uses it. When known liars, certified liars, who've been caught lying over and over
[02:57.400 --> 03:02.360]  and over again and caught staging things, tell me something, I don't just immediately
[03:02.360 --> 03:03.640]  believe it.
[03:03.640 --> 03:08.240]  That doesn't mean the official story isn't true, because sometimes you get people who
[03:08.240 --> 03:16.100]  are not corrupt in the system, or it's a real event. Sometimes the truth comes out because
[03:16.100 --> 03:21.880]  you've got good people in media, good people in government, and it's not a staged event.
[03:21.880 --> 03:24.740]  And so you'll have regular folks involved.
[03:24.740 --> 03:30.360]  But when it is a staged event, you'll see key players involved and key scripting, and
[03:30.360 --> 03:36.520]  you'll see an official story being put out very, very quickly. And the shaping immediately
[03:36.520 --> 03:41.960]  and the preparation and the unification of the propaganda is a telltale sign. We saw
[03:41.960 --> 03:46.880]  that with the Aurora shooting in Colorado, and then all the other telltale signs.
[03:46.880 --> 03:51.760]  And we do see it in Sandy Hook to a great extent. I believe there was a shooting there.
[03:51.760 --> 03:57.200]  It's like we say there's an inside job on 9-11. That just means criminal elements of
[03:57.200 --> 04:02.300]  the globalist structure somehow open the door, allowed it to happen, ordered stand downs.
[04:02.300 --> 04:07.660]  We know that happened. We know the official story's a lie. Does it mean there aren't quote
[04:07.660 --> 04:08.660]  Muslim extremists?
[04:08.660 --> 04:13.600]  But see, the system comes out and has their operatives say, there were no planes. And
[04:13.600 --> 04:20.560]  the originator of that, it later turned out, worked for the CIA. Very strange. See, so
[04:20.560 --> 04:26.920]  when I say there could be government involvement or criminal involvement by other actors, yet
[04:26.920 --> 04:33.800]  Sandy Hook, the spin is, you're saying nobody died. No, I'm saying people did die.
[04:33.800 --> 04:37.960]  But there's clear scripting and things. So it's a complex issue, but we're gonna be getting
[04:37.960 --> 04:44.320]  into that. The power outage, it appeared to be staged by yours truly. They're getting
[04:44.320 --> 04:48.880]  you ready, and they've said this, to have more and more power outages across America.
[04:48.880 --> 04:54.520]  This is gonna be a new way of life, just as it was in Romania under Ceausescu. So we're
[04:54.520 --> 05:00.600]  gonna break that down as well. In the latest Second Amendment news, it is all key.
[05:00.600 --> 05:05.320]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[05:05.320 --> 05:09.280]  through the year. From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[05:09.280 --> 05:13.520]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out
[05:13.520 --> 05:17.600]  to those that have lost everything. My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every

[05:30.400 --> 05:34.520]  and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day

[08:07.960 --> 08:31.720]  Alex Jones.
[08:37.960 --> 08:56.460]  Don't tread on me. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday
[08:56.460 --> 09:06.640]  edition. Marines to invade South Carolina. That is just the daily news as large expeditionary
[09:06.640 --> 09:15.260]  forces of the army, the Marines, the TSA, you name it. Practice taking over capital
[09:15.260 --> 09:20.980]  buildings, practice taking over schools, practice taking over malls. And I have been to many
[09:20.980 --> 09:25.420]  of these urban warfare training events, but we also see it now currently reported in the
[09:25.420 --> 09:26.420]  news.
[09:26.420 --> 09:33.580]  In many of the drills they practice mowing down human wave attacks. They are simulating
[09:33.580 --> 09:39.580]  killing, in some cases, unarmed American citizens. And when the public videotapes it and gets
[09:39.580 --> 09:47.100]  upset, they say, it's a zombie drill. It's a joke. That's why we've got 1000 Marines
[09:47.100 --> 09:53.960]  landing in San Diego a few months ago to practice killing zombies. That's why there's black
[09:53.960 --> 09:58.740]  helicopters that lease a building in the middle of town and then blow it up and catch it on
[09:58.740 --> 10:04.740]  fire and men are repelling down off ropes and the police are involved. It's all to acclimate
[10:04.740 --> 10:10.080]  and condition the public on record for martial law.
[10:10.080 --> 10:16.580]  It's all official in the army training manuals, in the army times, in Stars and Stripes, brigade
[10:16.580 --> 10:24.620]  homeland since 2008 has been officially announced. And they plan to have troop force up to 370
[10:24.620 --> 10:28.820]  plus thousand troops, that is the goal. And they're gonna pull them out of Iraq, out of
[10:28.820 --> 10:32.140]  Afghanistan, and they're gonna be the new domestic military.
[10:32.140 --> 10:37.420]  And you're going to have Obama, we have a clip of that coming up in a moment, running
[10:37.420 --> 10:45.420]  around, giving more speeches saying, we need a domestic security force, just as big, just
[10:45.420 --> 10:53.020]  as strong as our military. You've all seen and heard that quote over and over and over
[10:53.020 --> 10:59.100]  again. And we should do another special report this week showing top brass talking about
[10:59.100 --> 11:00.420]  it on C-SPAN.
[11:00.420 --> 11:07.140]  The Pentagon talking about it in Pentagon videos online. You've got not just Rahm Emanuel
[11:07.140 --> 11:10.740]  in two different speeches saying you'll have national service. But now you're seeing all
[11:10.740 --> 11:16.140]  these other groups pushing for it and they're telling high schoolers, hey, it's gonna be
[11:16.140 --> 11:19.440]  compulsory that you serve in the new FEMA Corps.
[11:19.440 --> 11:25.220]  But it's not gonna be planting trees. It's not gonna be building national park bunk houses
[11:25.220 --> 11:29.780]  like they had in the 30s and 40s with the national make work programs. It's gonna be
[11:29.780 --> 11:37.340]  unpaid compulsory volunteerism, which is another Orwellian term. This is the insanity of the
[11:37.340 --> 11:39.180]  world that we live in.
[11:39.180 --> 11:47.540]  Look at this other article up at infoawars.com. Robots replace waiters in China. That's right.
[11:47.540 --> 11:52.980]  They're not just going to replace manufacturing jobs and have robots working on the robots.
[11:52.980 --> 12:01.620]  No, now they're going to replace people as waiters. And again, the globalist have decided
[12:01.620 --> 12:08.860]  to go with this angle to make humans obsolete.
[12:08.860 --> 12:19.140]  To make humans obsolete, to fully get control of the civilization, and to have a technocratic
[12:19.140 --> 12:24.340]  centralized system. And people say, this is a terrible future you're telling us about.
[12:24.340 --> 12:30.380]  I'm not the one manifesting this. The globalist are engineering it in that direction. We're
[12:30.380 --> 12:31.780]  gonna be going over that report.
[12:31.780 --> 12:39.260]  Reuters report contradicts Obama skeet shooting photo. I don't even know what to say about
[12:39.260 --> 12:45.780]  this other than it's definitely a shy up. And this is cognitive dissonance that Cass
[12:45.780 --> 12:58.280]  Sunstein talked about and that Cass Sunstein engaged in, what, four years ago in public
[12:58.280 --> 13:01.780]  white papers. And that's why he was hired and brought into the White House. He's now
[13:01.780 --> 13:03.960]  left the White House for four years.
[13:03.960 --> 13:14.580]  He was the head of their policy board. He was the czar, the regulation czar. I know
[13:14.580 --> 13:27.500]  shotguns. And I have photographed and videotaped, even as a novice before I had a TV show, firing
[13:27.500 --> 13:34.460]  shotguns and firing rifles and firing handguns over and over again. And I can tell you right
[13:34.460 --> 13:39.680]  now, that looks like a fake photo to me.
[13:39.680 --> 13:45.660]  And I actually noticed that first there's a controversy that, he doesn't really skeet
[13:45.660 --> 13:50.820]  shooter like guns, which they kinda stirred up. And then the White House over the weekend,
[13:50.820 --> 13:54.460]  and I'm gonna cover this, I have it here in the stack once we get over some of the top
[13:54.460 --> 14:02.380]  news. The White House comes out and says, don't you claim this isn't real?
[14:02.380 --> 14:06.980]  And then another little comment, they say, by the way, this is copyright, no one is allowed
[14:06.980 --> 14:13.500]  to Photoshop this. This is only for media. Knowing that that will stir people up and
[14:13.500 --> 14:17.540]  make them go out and Photoshop it. And by the way, I've looked at the precedent, I've
[14:17.540 --> 14:23.340]  looked at the law, White House photos are public domain, you paid for it.
[14:23.340 --> 14:27.060]  That's why you can go to the National Archives and just pay for the copying, pay for the
[14:27.060 --> 14:34.860]  cost of copying and the tape, or now the hard drive, and get all of the gun pod footage,
[14:34.860 --> 14:40.100]  get all of the hydrogen bombs going off. Companies take it and then remaster it and then call
[14:40.100 --> 14:44.660]  it copyright, or the voiceover is copyright on Discovery Channel or History Channel, but
[14:44.660 --> 14:46.180]  not the footage.
[14:46.180 --> 14:50.540]  And so I've actually looked into this, I've actually purchased National Archive film.
[14:50.540 --> 14:55.860]  I've actually, you have to actually get it through another company or go and you have
[14:55.860 --> 15:00.300]  to send someone in with the archivist and that's how you buy it and get it. So I've
[15:00.300 --> 15:04.020]  actually been through the process, I know. Why would they come out and say, you will
[15:04.020 --> 15:06.740]  not use this, you will not Photoshop that?
[15:06.740 --> 15:11.620]  Cass Sunstein said, we'll go in and stir them up, we'll put out fake conspiracies. We'll
[15:11.620 --> 15:17.500]  get everybody hyped up, we'll get everybody diverted, we'll get everybody to look at fake
[15:17.500 --> 15:21.100]  conspiracy theories or conspiracy theories that don't matter.
[15:21.100 --> 15:26.520]  He wrote two papers on it, one for Chicago Business School, the Neocon outfit, and one
[15:26.520 --> 15:31.460]  for Harvard, look them up. He wrote them six years ago and then wrote more papers when
[15:31.460 --> 15:37.540]  he got in the White House in 2009. I mean, just look it up, Cass Sunstein, cognitive
[15:37.540 --> 15:38.540]  infiltration.
[15:38.540 --> 15:45.440]  I always say cognitive dissonance, it's cognitive infiltration. And that's what they're doing
[15:45.440 --> 15:51.100]  here. They put out a blatantly fake birth certificate, show that we'd run around and
[15:51.100 --> 15:57.020]  talk about it all day knowing the public would just choose sides or get confused. While the
[15:57.020 --> 16:02.380]  insider trading goes on by Congress, while the UN openly is in command of our military
[16:02.380 --> 16:07.920]  along with NATO, while our government publicly arms and commands al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria
[16:07.920 --> 16:12.280]  and Mali and a bunch of other places.
[16:12.280 --> 16:23.380]  LTSA occupies every major city from Seattle to LA to Dallas, Austin, Texas, Houston, Texas,
[16:23.380 --> 16:31.660]  Kansas City, Chicago, New York City, Boston, you name it. You name it, they're there. I
[16:31.660 --> 16:40.340]  mean, they're now there with quote spot checks on South Lamar at the bus terminals and the
[16:40.340 --> 16:44.440]  train terminals, but they also are doing it to people on the highway now.
[16:44.440 --> 16:48.700]  And it's totally illegal, and they search everybody's bags without warrants. And they're
[16:48.700 --> 16:57.740]  out of their jurisdiction, and it's all just a probing operation. And that ties in to this
[16:57.740 --> 17:06.380]  information that's coming up. Why is the government stockpiling guns and ammo? Joseph Farah, Worldnet
[17:06.380 --> 17:11.660]  Daily asked. And he says, why is the government gearing up for war?
[17:11.660 --> 17:15.000]  Why are they buying billions of bullets? Why are they buying only automatic weapons? Why
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.400]  are they buying armored vehicles? He says it's about the civilian National Security
[17:19.400 --> 17:26.480]  Force as big, as strong, as well-funded as the Defense Department, to quote Barack Obama.
[17:26.480 --> 17:36.200]  And Farah says that's what he believes is going on. He says, I have some theories. Those
[17:36.200 --> 17:41.940]  of us that have been right all along need to stop saying we have theories. I'm gonna
[17:41.940 --> 17:48.520]  get Joseph Farah back on. I'm gonna get him back on this week or next week, because it's
[17:48.520 --> 17:49.520]  all there.
[17:49.520 --> 17:55.820]  It's like you walk into your living room, there's a giant elephant sitting there on
[17:55.820 --> 18:01.800]  top of a pile of crap, excuse my French. And you're like, I don't know, I got a theory,
[18:01.800 --> 18:05.620]  that looks like an elephant. You're like, well, it's got big ears, it's just a gray,
[18:05.620 --> 18:12.580]  it's got hair, it's got giant feet, it's got cusks. I don't know, though. Look, it's all
[18:12.580 --> 18:15.560]  in the army memos, the army manuals.
[18:15.560 --> 18:19.440]  Maybe Farah's just a good writer and he knows people like a mystery. I notice everybody
[18:19.440 --> 18:23.180]  always calls me with, I think there's a FEMA camp in my neighborhood. I mean, under the
[18:23.180 --> 18:27.400]  Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, they designate the centers. And then you can
[18:27.400 --> 18:33.120]  cross-reference it with the Emergency Centers Establishment Act that just was giving more
[18:33.120 --> 18:36.340]  funding to already existing facilities and plans.
[18:36.340 --> 18:42.520]  And then it matches up to the 2002 FEMA plan. And you can look up all the clergy response
[18:42.520 --> 18:46.000]  team training, what they're training the preachers for, to quote, go to the FEMA camp, take the
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.860]  shots, turn your guns in when you're told, this is all official. And then five years,
[18:50.860 --> 18:58.120]  four years after we break the news here on Genesis, it's mainstream media, and InfraGuard,
[18:58.120 --> 19:02.360]  and Brigade Homeland, and Army Times, and all the countless drills.
[19:02.360 --> 19:07.720]  And I've talked to the Delta Force people off record. They talked to Lieutenant Beck
[19:07.720 --> 19:12.920]  here in town. He gave me info, so they ran him out of the SWAT team. Vietnam veteran,
[19:12.920 --> 19:17.060]  patriot, great guy, ran him out, kicked him out of the Travis County SWAT team because
[19:17.060 --> 19:22.520]  he gave me information that was not classified.
[19:22.520 --> 19:25.480]  I went in his office two years before and I said, you're gonna be approached by Delta
[19:25.480 --> 19:29.960]  Force. And when they do, you need to understand it's illegal. And they're gonna offer you
[19:29.960 --> 19:34.040]  money. And this is part of a corruption program, just like they corrupt third world countries.
[19:34.040 --> 19:38.480]  That's how they took over Iraq. And I said, next, they're gonna be asking you to deal
[19:38.480 --> 19:44.320]  drugs. And he said, get out of here. That's posse comitatus. I'm a Vietnam sniper vet.
[19:44.320 --> 19:47.960]  That's unconstitutional. It'll never happen. You're nuts. And I said, they're approaching
[19:47.960 --> 19:52.000]  every city in the country. They will approach you. He calls me up two years ago, just can
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.200]  you come in my office, please? Delta Force card, everything he said I said was, of course
[19:56.200 --> 20:00.520]  I'm right. I know what I'm talking about. This is martial law.
[20:00.520 --> 20:05.320]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[20:05.320 --> 20:09.320]  through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[20:09.320 --> 20:13.540]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out
[20:13.540 --> 20:17.640]  to those that have lost everything. My friends at E Foods Direct hear from customers every

[20:26.160 --> 20:30.400]  are closed, but I managed to get my E Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[20:30.400 --> 20:34.520]  and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early and one day
[20:34.520 --> 20:35.520]  too late.

[22:31.460 --> 22:35.620]  why banks, stock workers, investment advisors want to talk about gold IRAs? They've been
[22:35.620 --> 22:40.440]  available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your

[24:16.440 --> 24:21.080]  Alex Jones here back live. I'm going to open the phones up on the Super Bowl power outage.
[24:21.080 --> 24:26.960]  What do you think that was all about? I've got some news concerning it, it's pretty amazing.
[24:26.960 --> 24:33.720]  I'm going to get to, even mainstream news is reporting is an Illuminati conspiracy.
[24:33.720 --> 24:42.180]  Because the singer flashes an Illuminati hand sign and then the power goes out. And it's
[24:42.180 --> 24:48.600]  just all part of them extending it out, having more time for ads and getting everybody ready
[24:48.600 --> 24:55.760]  for the power to start going out. In fact, in Europe and worldwide, they have Earth Day
[24:55.760 --> 24:59.120]  where everybody turns their lights out.
[24:59.120 --> 25:03.560]  For the day, for the evening, for one hour, they have a lot of different special greeny
[25:03.560 --> 25:09.800]  holidays where they want to accustom you to, everybody has their power go out. Because
[25:09.800 --> 25:14.840]  only the government districts are going to have the power. And see, for a new listener
[25:14.840 --> 25:18.800]  it's like, man, is everything a conspiracy with this guy?
[25:18.800 --> 25:23.080]  I have so much knowledge on this, it's very frustrating. I'm not bragging, hey, I have
[25:23.080 --> 25:28.120]  knowledge. It's freaking me out that the general public doesn't have 1 one hundredth of the
[25:28.120 --> 25:32.000]  information I have. Because you're focused on making money and doing your job and trying
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.360]  to take care of your kids and trying to have a good life.
[25:34.360 --> 25:39.500]  I don't blame you, I get it. You work hard, you want to go watch a football game. You
[25:39.500 --> 25:43.920]  work hard, you want to be left alone. You work hard, you want to go get in your sports
[25:43.920 --> 25:48.940]  car and go drive 100 miles an hour out in the countryside. I get it. You work hard,
[25:48.940 --> 25:53.800]  you want to go out and go water skiing or you want to go out and have some fun, go out
[25:53.800 --> 25:55.080]  and party.
[25:55.080 --> 26:00.140]  The problem is we've been taken over and things are going to get very, very bad. But as things
[26:00.140 --> 26:05.600]  get worse and worse, people are going to say, well, let me just have my entertainment. Just
[26:05.600 --> 26:12.520]  leave me alone. In fact, statistics and history shows, as things get worse, people tend to
[26:12.520 --> 26:16.160]  get even more into entertainment and more into escapism.
[26:16.160 --> 26:26.320]  And the social engineers know that. But what they can't get over is tribal images and archetypes
[26:26.320 --> 26:35.760]  and signants, runes of power. And that's what guns are, that's what property is, that's
[26:35.760 --> 26:42.000]  what parenthood is. It's real things like weapons and children and property. This is
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.340]  all real.
[26:44.340 --> 26:50.020]  And they can't get rid of that last little pieces, the family, men and women, and their
[26:50.020 --> 26:56.640]  desire for one another. Friendship, people standing up for one another. That's why all
[26:56.640 --> 27:01.480]  the messages are don't stand up for people, screw other people, cheat other people. Get
[27:01.480 --> 27:05.480]  ahead, get ahead, show that you're all atomized and can't come together.
[27:05.480 --> 27:11.720]  I mean, when I get up here and say the Super Bowl power outage looks staged, you have to
[27:11.720 --> 27:16.520]  understand, ladies and gentlemen, that I know. In fact, I wanna do a special report on this.
[27:16.520 --> 27:21.500]  It's just that I wanna do a special report on everything. I wanna document everything
[27:21.500 --> 27:25.920]  and every article I cover. Every one of these 200 articles is probably more than, can we
[27:25.920 --> 27:27.320]  have a document, guys?
[27:27.320 --> 27:32.960]  There's probably 200 different articles here. Every one of them I could spend three hours
[27:32.960 --> 27:39.140]  on and then give you supporting backup information on each and every one of them, proving why
[27:39.140 --> 27:45.460]  I believe what I believe, why I say what I say, what I'm going over, what I'm breaking
[27:45.460 --> 27:55.500]  down, okay? I mean, here's an example. I have the UN proclamations in the 1960s and 70s
[27:55.500 --> 27:59.680]  saying they wanted to train people to not have electricity and to not expect electricity
[27:59.680 --> 28:05.260]  24 hours a day and to not accept running water and to not accept things.
[28:05.260 --> 28:11.880]  And that the globalist could charge us more money for a gallon of water than for 10,000
[28:11.880 --> 28:18.200]  gallons of it. And that society was set up wrong and that wealth was making us too free
[28:18.200 --> 28:22.840]  and the social engineers were going to lose control of technological development and their
[28:22.840 --> 28:29.680]  global monopoly of power if they didn't bring the general population back into feudal serfdom.
[28:29.680 --> 28:34.140]  And that's why all the trendy resorts and all the trendy restaurants all over the country
[28:34.140 --> 28:39.020]  and other countries I've been to, you go in and they're not low flush toilets. There is
[28:39.020 --> 28:44.840]  no water. They're not low flush urinals. There is no water. And you're at a five star restaurant
[28:44.840 --> 28:48.980]  and the bathroom stinks like a gas station because the urine's going down into a cistern
[28:48.980 --> 28:54.120]  below that gets processed and turned into fertilizer and stuff, okay?
[28:54.120 --> 28:58.840]  They make it trendy to be a slave. Just like the ancient Chinese emperors, they were told
[28:58.840 --> 29:03.600]  it's stylish to not be able to walk. It's stylish to not be able to feed yourself. And
[29:03.600 --> 29:10.080]  the ruling power behind the throne fully took over. This is the system. They tell you it's
[29:10.080 --> 29:14.360]  stylish to be a slave. They tell you it's stylish not to be manly. They tell you it's
[29:14.360 --> 29:16.560]  stylish not to be a classical mother.
[29:16.560 --> 29:21.800]  They tell you all of this not to empower you but to enslave you. So see, I know this was
[29:21.800 --> 29:34.200]  a stunt. I know in my gut and I know their MO. 99% chance, okay? 99% chance because I
[29:34.200 --> 29:39.800]  happen to remember other stunts where they had official sporting events go dark in the
[29:39.800 --> 29:46.000]  past and I predict next Super Bowl they'll say, we're now going to make this a tradition
[29:46.000 --> 29:49.840]  to have the power go out. Watch, we come back.
[29:49.840 --> 30:00.720]  There on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.720 --> 30:04.720]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

[33:01.120 --> 33:11.120]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[33:11.120 --> 33:20.120]  All right, finishing up. Before I give out the number and get into some other news, then
[33:20.120 --> 33:27.320]  go to your phone calls. They were billing the Super Bowl as the most green friendly
[33:27.320 --> 33:32.280]  ever. But green friendly for me means not having genetically modified organisms being
[33:32.280 --> 33:38.000]  manufactured by the thousand every year, not having human genetics put into sheep, cows,
[33:38.000 --> 33:45.320]  you name it, so that you can then have cross-species zoological transference of pathogens, bacteria
[33:45.320 --> 33:50.240]  and virus. And it gives rise to dangerous mutations, not having toxic waste dumped in
[33:50.240 --> 33:56.080]  our food supply, not having dangerous experiments going on with any matter.
[33:56.080 --> 33:59.680]  These are the things that could actually destroy the planet, destroy us. Not carbon dioxide
[33:59.680 --> 34:07.280]  plants breathe, not where it's bad to have electricity, it's bad to flush your toilet.
[34:07.280 --> 34:12.360]  When all your toilet does if you have say a septic system is send it out through a bacteria
[34:12.360 --> 34:22.640]  tank and then sends fertilized water out to your green yard, creating a recycled ecosystem.
[34:22.640 --> 34:28.160]  It's all renewable. Humans are bad, humans are evil. You're saying how do I know this
[34:28.160 --> 34:29.160]  was staged?
[34:29.160 --> 34:34.200]  Well, I went back and reviewed the video right before it happened. I saw the way they were
[34:34.200 --> 34:39.520]  behaving some of the things they did right when it happened, the way they behaved once
[34:39.520 --> 34:45.720]  it unfolded. Most people obviously weren't in on it, but it's all about to see if they
[34:45.720 --> 34:48.880]  can get away with it.
[34:48.880 --> 34:54.080]  And how do I know this? Well, the UN has called for this. In fact, guys, we use search engine
[34:54.080 --> 35:02.160]  Enron staged blackouts. And then you all hear about it on Earth Day and World Day and all
[35:02.160 --> 35:08.280]  these other days they have where simultaneously nations turn their lights out.
[35:08.280 --> 35:11.640]  They're getting you trained. And Enron said in its internal memos that came out in the
[35:11.640 --> 35:18.140]  federal trial that, well, we found if we cut the power, it creates the artificial perception
[35:18.140 --> 35:24.040]  of scarcity. The perception so that we can have artificial scarcity. Yeah, there's Wall
[35:24.040 --> 35:25.040]  Street Journal.
[35:25.040 --> 35:31.660]  Enron linked to California blackouts. Traders said manipulation began energy crisis. Yeah.
[35:31.660 --> 35:37.080]  And then it came out in the federal court. That's from 2002. It came out that they would
[35:37.080 --> 35:43.840]  do it. And some days they'd make $1 billion extra, some weeks $3 or $4 billion extra all
[35:43.840 --> 35:48.620]  over the West Coast, but mainly in California, saying there isn't enough power.
[35:48.620 --> 35:54.740]  There isn't enough power. My gosh, okay, you want power? You went without power for six
[35:54.740 --> 36:00.080]  hours today, Los Angeles. We're gonna have to charge you more. Give me my power then.
[36:00.080 --> 36:05.720]  All right, it's free market. Truth is they had a glut of power. The truth is they were
[36:05.720 --> 36:09.560]  telling their switching stations, calling them on the phone, because all these people
[36:09.560 --> 36:11.340]  weren't conspirators.
[36:11.340 --> 36:16.040]  They were just told by Enron that had the contracts over the agreement. Okay, start
[36:16.040 --> 36:22.540]  cutting power over the next 24 hours, cut it down to almost nothing. I mean, they have
[36:22.540 --> 36:28.060]  to build the grid up, have actuaries of how much is gonna be used, prepare and guess with
[36:28.060 --> 36:32.840]  computers. In the old days, they did it with big thick pads of paper, and they would sit
[36:32.840 --> 36:36.200]  there and guess, okay, this time of year, generally this much power gets used.
[36:36.200 --> 36:39.360]  We know when it gets hot, they're gonna use more air conditioners. We know when it's cold,
[36:39.360 --> 36:44.600]  okay, this many people on average have electric power. They're not using a gas or, okay, we
[36:44.600 --> 36:48.080]  have this much power used last year, we guess there's gonna be that much. And then if there's
[36:48.080 --> 36:54.000]  extra power, it has to then be stored in big giant batteries and other systems.
[36:54.000 --> 37:01.800]  That power is destructive, it will blow things up. They've got it all dialed in. And the
[37:01.800 --> 37:06.260]  Soviets would do this in their satellites to control people. Romanian places, they had
[37:06.260 --> 37:09.880]  policies to just get it to where there were a couple hours of power a day, and then only
[37:09.880 --> 37:13.840]  select factories and government buildings, they had power 24 hours a day.
[37:13.840 --> 37:17.880]  And they're already setting up the actuaries. See, I've studied this issue. I've talked
[37:17.880 --> 37:23.880]  to people that work as engineers in scores of power plants. I've talked to plant managers.
[37:23.880 --> 37:28.460]  I've researched it at every level. I've got a lot of family that works in power plant
[37:28.460 --> 37:34.480]  management and power storage. Yeah, tapes reveal Enron's secret role in California Power
[37:34.480 --> 37:36.400]  Blackhouse, London Guardian, boom.
[37:36.400 --> 37:41.960]  See, and this is one stinking data point. I have hundreds. Do you know what it's like
[37:41.960 --> 37:48.240]  to be sure of their criminal activity and not be able to stop them? But see, you know
[37:48.240 --> 37:52.460]  they want your guns to enslave you. People saw it worldwide and they've seen it in cities
[37:52.460 --> 37:55.080]  these globalist mafia people run.
[37:55.080 --> 38:00.480]  So see on that one issue, you know not to trust them so they're not victorious. Even
[38:00.480 --> 38:04.040]  though they're trying everything they got to go after our guns, and they're trying to
[38:04.040 --> 38:11.160]  launch out of control outside of law purges against gun owners, it still doesn't matter
[38:11.160 --> 38:16.140]  because on one issue, you're not backing down, you're angry, you're upset, and you're not
[38:16.140 --> 38:19.720]  gonna play games, okay?
[38:19.720 --> 38:24.560]  All you've got to do is figure out their scam on every other issue and it's over, okay?
[38:24.560 --> 38:29.640]  It's over. Let me continue. In fact, I'm gonna do a report on this. I could show you right
[38:29.640 --> 38:37.720]  now. It would just take the whole hour. Type in UN calls for controlled blackouts to lower
[38:37.720 --> 38:39.200]  carbon footprint.
[38:39.200 --> 38:46.360]  Type in carbon footprint is a depression is good for a carbon footprint. You can go read
[38:46.360 --> 38:52.720]  the UN admitting that the mega banks are engineering this, but it's all in academic level above
[38:52.720 --> 38:58.120]  PhD. You don't get taught this stuff at the London School of Economics. You don't get
[38:58.120 --> 38:59.720]  taught this stuff at Harvard.
[38:59.720 --> 39:04.000]  You don't get taught this stuff at Yale. I've interviewed people. There's only one a year
[39:04.000 --> 39:10.200]  that goes through the special Rockefeller Foundation program that Henry Kissinger was
[39:10.200 --> 39:15.120]  the first graduate of to be a super gopher for them. You don't go through that until
[39:15.120 --> 39:17.720]  you've got two PhDs and are selected.
[39:17.720 --> 39:26.880]  And I have interviewed one of the people who's got that special above PhD level degree. Francis
[39:26.880 --> 39:33.760]  Boyle, constitutional lawyer. Dr. Boyle, professor, who they've got on a no fly list. He's not
[39:33.760 --> 39:38.360]  even allowed to fly. They hate him so much cuz he turned against him. He got all the
[39:38.360 --> 39:42.560]  way to the highest level, played along with them, and they let him into all of it.
[39:42.560 --> 39:49.280]  This is how it works. Major universities may graduate five of these people a year, okay?
[39:49.280 --> 39:53.720]  And it's Chicago business, it's Yale, it's Harvard, it's Princeton. The University of
[39:53.720 --> 39:58.520]  Texas has got the former NSA head running it. They're hatching them out. And Aaron Dykes
[39:58.520 --> 40:03.440]  got into the political science higher level, not the highest level.
[40:03.440 --> 40:08.300]  But they were wanting to go for his PhD and stuff cuz he had high grades. And he got right
[40:08.300 --> 40:11.760]  up in there and it was, yeah, world government's real. We're gonna get rid of the family, everything
[40:11.760 --> 40:18.000]  else. I mean, my dad got into the lower mid levels of this and they all told him. Folks,
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.360]  this is an absolute 100% fact, okay?
[40:23.360 --> 40:27.400]  They turned the power off at the Super Bowl to get you ready for more power outages. Remember
[40:27.400 --> 40:32.080]  my article two years ago? Thedrudgereport.com picked up and went viral everywhere and the
[40:32.080 --> 40:36.320]  White House, Jay Carney, responded. I guess it was a year and a half ago when he first
[40:36.320 --> 40:39.840]  got in there and replaced the other idiot, Gibbs.
[40:39.840 --> 40:42.840]  And they responded, so that's ridiculous. There's not gonna be rolling blackouts cuz
[40:42.840 --> 40:46.800]  of us. We're not shutting down power plants, even though they already shut down a couple
[40:46.800 --> 40:51.960]  hundred. Texas now has rolling blackouts when it gets colder, when it gets hot. We have
[40:51.960 --> 40:56.200]  to buy the power from Mexico, dirty plants, the globalist don't.
[40:56.200 --> 41:00.880]  And there it is, depression good for reducing carbon emissions. Bloomberg, that's an Infowars.com
[41:00.880 --> 41:04.600]  article. But if you click Bloomberg, that blue link right there, it'll show you. And
[41:04.600 --> 41:12.340]  the UN says, use public events in their, pull it up. They say, we will use public events
[41:12.340 --> 41:17.640]  to turn the power off to teach everyone it's good and we will ritualize not having running
[41:17.640 --> 41:19.760]  water, not having electricity.
[41:19.760 --> 41:25.200]  They're going to turn your electricity off. You're not going to have it. In the actuary
[41:25.200 --> 41:32.420]  agreements in San Francisco and Austin and Okinawa, these sister model UN cities under
[41:32.420 --> 41:39.000]  immunization plans, just go look it up. Austin special model UN city, thousands of pages,
[41:39.000 --> 41:45.560]  UN website. They say the central governing districts and the central governing zoning
[41:45.560 --> 41:48.040]  areas will never lose power.
[41:48.040 --> 41:52.520]  That's why all the elite where I live, doesn't matter there's houses 10 times as big, outside
[41:52.520 --> 41:56.920]  town for cheaper. They move into little bitty houses in Tarrytown. I say little bitty, little
[41:56.920 --> 42:01.160]  bitty for these people, billionaires are down there. They move into three and four and five
[42:01.160 --> 42:05.960]  bedroom houses, because that's where the police protection zone is.
[42:05.960 --> 42:10.600]  You've heard the police calling and confirm this. The police captains know where the special
[42:10.600 --> 42:15.720]  zones are at. Those places will not have their power cut off. The reason they're tearing
[42:15.720 --> 42:19.160]  up the roads and putting in bus lanes and stuff and bike lanes is they're going to shut
[42:19.160 --> 42:20.920]  everything off in the future.
[42:20.920 --> 42:26.360]  They're not playing games is my point. You understand what it's like to know of this
[42:26.360 --> 42:31.820]  criminal activity? A bunch of seedy slime bags playing God because we stand down and
[42:31.820 --> 42:39.440]  let them run all over us. The UN maps presented in Congress, I'm showing one on screen right
[42:39.440 --> 42:44.200]  now, half the country, right at half, completely off limits.
[42:44.200 --> 42:49.560]  And folks in Burma and other areas, I saw it in 1999. I've got to find it, it was about
[42:49.560 --> 42:59.280]  Asia, and it showed UN zones, biosphere zones, and it showed men with machine guns who shoot
[42:59.280 --> 43:04.280]  anyone that enters them. They kill you if you enter it. They're already doing this in
[43:04.280 --> 43:05.560]  Africa and Latin America.
[43:05.560 --> 43:10.900]  Look it up, even the New York Times, African people and others and Latin Americans are
[43:10.900 --> 43:16.300]  being killed for UN programs to quote, reclaim land to the earth, kicking people off their
[43:16.300 --> 43:26.640]  ancestral land, forcing them into giant megacities, to then work for two cents an hour. And then
[43:26.640 --> 43:32.480]  the government says, guess what, just get sterilized, do this and that, and we will
[43:32.480 --> 43:36.800]  give you $5,000, the equivalent of what they'd make in three or four or five years, and they
[43:36.800 --> 43:37.800]  do it.
[43:37.800 --> 43:42.640]  You're like, good, sterilize them, there's too many people. You idiots, you idiot yuppies.
[43:42.640 --> 43:46.660]  You're not white racists, cuz that's not what they are. They're on power trips like they're
[43:46.660 --> 43:51.060]  scientists and they've been let in on the program, because it is, everybody's let in
[43:51.060 --> 43:52.060]  on it.
[43:52.060 --> 43:57.740]  You go to any cocktail party, even just mainline people that don't even have their four year
[43:57.740 --> 44:02.100]  science degree yet, and start talking about, we need to get rid of people, we need to reduce
[44:02.100 --> 44:07.440]  population and they'll start singing from the same sheet of music. Don't you get it,
[44:07.440 --> 44:11.720]  you morons, they're putting it in your food, they're putting it in your water, they're
[44:11.720 --> 44:15.720]  putting it in your air, they're soft killing you as well.
[44:15.720 --> 44:19.960]  They just can't do it as openly and as fast because we have something of a free press
[44:19.960 --> 44:26.500]  left that would report on it. I mean, I remember two years ago, I saw major pro-life sites
[44:26.500 --> 44:37.360]  that are highly respected saying, Pepsi is using aborted fetus body parts to produce
[44:37.360 --> 44:42.040]  specially grown cultured flavor enhancer.
[44:42.040 --> 44:50.200]  It's basically a genetically engineered flavor, they wanna be able to just drop a vial of
[44:50.200 --> 44:57.960]  it into a soup and ferment the flavor, okay? Just like aspartame is E. coli. And I saw
[44:57.960 --> 45:01.440]  that and I said, that's not true, and I went looked it up and it was true. And then the
[45:01.440 --> 45:06.440]  Obama administration ruled for PepsiCo that the shareholders didn't have to be told where
[45:06.440 --> 45:08.200]  the babies were coming from.
[45:08.200 --> 45:12.800]  And then it all came out, in fact, you can even type in, it happened last year, PepsiCo
[45:12.800 --> 45:17.880]  agrees to stop using fetal tissue. People didn't believe it, I didn't believe it, but
[45:17.880 --> 45:25.800]  actually I should have believed it, I already knew it. They had cloned humans 20 years ago,
[45:25.800 --> 45:29.600]  they just don't call it a human because they kill the baby before it's born.
[45:29.600 --> 45:35.280]  They grow them in artificial wombs and then they say it's not a human because it was changed.
[45:35.280 --> 45:41.080]  They add 1% pig, 1% cow, 1%, look this up, this has already been going on for 20 years.
[45:41.080 --> 45:47.600]  And then it's not a human and it's not a clone, they give it other semantical names and then
[45:47.600 --> 45:52.900]  they suck them dry and use them. Yeah, PepsiCo says it will halt use of aborted fetal cells
[45:52.900 --> 45:56.360]  in flavor research, it's also in the Washington Times.
[45:56.360 --> 46:02.480]  And they go, technically, we're not feeding you babies, we grow the culture out of the
[46:02.480 --> 46:07.560]  stem cell line from the dead babies. That's right, that's right, for whatever reason,
[46:07.560 --> 46:14.080]  I guess I gotta admit veal tastes really good. Something about baby flesh tastes pretty good.
[46:14.080 --> 46:19.160]  When I go out and I go hunting, if I'm gonna shoot something, it isn't a big buck, I'm
[46:19.160 --> 46:26.360]  gonna shoot a yearling doe and I'm gonna take it and I'm gonna have it cut into steaks.
[46:26.360 --> 46:32.800]  If I hunt, if I hunt to eat it, if I see a big ugly old jackrabbit, I'm not going, that
[46:32.800 --> 46:38.120]  thing's gonna have fleas all over them and it tastes like, but if I see a little fluffy
[46:38.120 --> 46:43.800]  jackrabbit hopping around, my 22-250 is gonna shoot you about 200 yards and I'm gonna eat
[46:43.800 --> 46:44.800]  you.
[46:44.800 --> 46:47.920]  Back when I had time to be a woodsman and do such things like that, my true love, it's
[46:47.920 --> 46:54.000]  any man's true love, you ever go out and do it. And so it's sick, you're eating a flavor
[46:54.000 --> 47:01.560]  enhancement from a baby, from a baby and you don't even care. Just like they have suicide
[47:01.560 --> 47:06.680]  nets, not just at Foxconn, but dozens of other, I mean, I don't know, I looked at them something
[47:06.680 --> 47:11.760]  like 30 major companies have built in China around their dorm suicide nets.
[47:11.760 --> 47:15.760]  And they're saying, don't worry, Foxconn said, we're just gonna go to robots, but they still
[47:15.760 --> 47:20.860]  need human technicians to work on the robots. See, they don't need us, they don't want us,
[47:20.860 --> 47:25.600]  they took the world over through fraud and they're coming for everyone.
[47:25.600 --> 47:31.800]  And they've had other global soccer games, type in power turned off, lights go dark at
[47:31.800 --> 47:37.080]  soccer game to mark Earth Day, just type that in, I wanna show them. This is the program,
[47:37.080 --> 47:42.600]  I know them, they have blueprints, they have handbooks. And so once their robot armies
[47:42.600 --> 47:49.440]  are in place, robot engineers, robot sewer repair, robot street repair, robot security,
[47:49.440 --> 47:54.480]  robot combat, once that's all in, and we're only talking five to ten years, they're gonna
[47:54.480 --> 47:59.040]  probably let it go a little bit further than that to make sure all systems are good.
[47:59.040 --> 48:02.880]  They're going to launch a Skynet attack on us, but it's not gonna be nuclear, it's gonna
[48:02.880 --> 48:08.800]  be biological and chemical. And that it's humans running Skynet, okay? And again, you
[48:08.800 --> 48:13.840]  can pull this up in the 70s, the Pentagon called it and it's actually in my book, that's
[48:13.840 --> 48:18.600]  out of print now, but it's on prisonplanet.tv and m4news.com. They actually call it Skynet
[48:18.600 --> 48:20.840]  and a control grid.
[48:20.840 --> 48:26.560]  See, people see this info who are in Hollywood and in between the CIA and Hollywood that's
[48:26.560 --> 48:30.680]  like two peas in a pod, and then they put the culture out to get you ready. But it's
[48:30.680 --> 48:36.120]  not machines coming commanded by machines, it is elite globalists who believe they're
[48:36.120 --> 48:38.200]  going to merge with the machines.
[48:38.200 --> 48:44.240]  They believe the evolutionary path has already been predestined, they've chosen this path.
[48:44.240 --> 48:49.200]  They have chosen the best possible path to immortality is cybernetic merger. And they're
[48:49.200 --> 48:55.160]  offering the greatest intelligentsia of the world entree into that system if they will
[48:55.160 --> 49:01.080]  serve it. Number one, you reap what you sow, you're not going to get this immortality.
[49:01.080 --> 49:05.160]  Number two, it's horrible what you're doing. And number three, you can't trust the globalists
[49:05.160 --> 49:11.400]  that engineered this thing. You think they're going to let people like you stay around that
[49:11.400 --> 49:16.960]  are a lot smarter than them? Do you think they're going to keep you around? You are
[49:16.960 --> 49:19.800]  gravely mistaken. This is not good.
[49:19.800 --> 49:25.960]  We should offer the technology to everyone. We should be honest about what's going on
[49:25.960 --> 49:33.200]  and we should have giant global initiatives that are accepted at the nation state level
[49:33.200 --> 49:39.220]  and accepted and voted on by the people of goals of off world colonies and bring out
[49:39.220 --> 49:41.720]  all this technology and be honest about it.
[49:41.720 --> 49:45.900]  And we can people the stars together. But I'm telling you that that decision has been
[49:45.900 --> 49:49.880]  cut off. That is not happening. That is not the direction we're going. You're slated for
[49:49.880 --> 49:54.760]  death. And as soon as their grids in place, they're going to release the bio weapons and
[49:54.760 --> 49:57.760]  the chemical weapons and all of you people that have served the system and think you're
[49:57.760 --> 49:58.760]  part of it.
[49:58.760 --> 50:05.560]  You're going to die. I hope you understand that's the program. That's the plan. And I've
[50:05.560 --> 50:09.160]  warned you and I've warned you and it's why I'm not worried about getting killed or being
[50:09.160 --> 50:16.340]  put in prison. There's no future if we don't turn this around. And we need to have an intervention
[50:16.340 --> 50:22.280]  with ourselves and realize this system and what people think about you and all the TV

[54:16.840 --> 54:23.340]  in for one segment we've got the author of the fixes in he says one of the most corrupt
[54:23.340 --> 54:30.160]  outfits is the NFL staging things and he's been in the FBI files it's been documented
[54:30.160 --> 54:33.780]  the question is how much is staged well how much will you put up with he's going to pop
[54:33.780 --> 54:37.600]  in to give us his take on the power outage with the game in general because if I talk
[54:37.600 --> 54:44.080]  about the Super Bowl and then use it as a way to get people to think about larger issues
[54:44.080 --> 54:50.880]  we can take a globalist tool of propaganda and actually turn it around against them here's
[54:50.880 --> 54:56.960]  something I want to get across to you the decision has been made at MIT the United Nations
[54:56.960 --> 55:03.040]  the club of Rome the Bilderberg group anyone who reads science magazines knows this 15
[55:03.040 --> 55:07.660]  years ago I was reading white papers where they said this was the plan and those were
[55:07.660 --> 55:13.640]  white papers from decades before in some cases but I'd never seen it in Scientific American
[55:13.640 --> 55:21.200]  I'd never seen it in the Journal of Nature I'd never seen it in MIT magazine now they're
[55:21.200 --> 55:25.260]  going no there will be no need for humans and we don't know what to do with you and
[55:25.260 --> 55:29.380]  everything will be robotic and the elites are going to merge with machines and the decision
[55:29.380 --> 55:34.320]  has basically been that we're not even going to have humans deployed to space and the manned
[55:34.320 --> 55:43.240]  space program is over and everything is robots that is a decision that humans are obsolete
[55:43.240 --> 55:48.160]  humans are a failure humans are a joke and the globalists are going to take full control
[55:48.160 --> 55:54.520]  of human evolution in their words and think of what a total revolution that is where they
[55:54.520 --> 55:59.560]  just ignore what we want they ignore what we say they put out a fake Hollywood sports
[55:59.560 --> 56:07.440]  system they suck everyone into it while above us a technocratic matrix engineer core is
[56:07.440 --> 56:14.800]  trying to build a matrix we're not in total false reality yet they put out fake shotgun
[56:14.800 --> 56:19.720]  photos they do Illuminati signs right before they turn the power off you know Janet Jackson
[56:19.720 --> 56:24.120]  it was an accident my breast came out with the Illuminati Sun sign on her I mean all
[56:24.120 --> 56:29.880]  staged oh was it staged gee did a bear go in the woods and go to the bathroom do fish
[56:29.880 --> 56:36.420]  live in the water I mean again they do it all to just exercise authority over us where
[56:36.420 --> 56:40.280]  they publicly run al-qaeda and admit they do but say you've got to give your liberties
[56:40.280 --> 56:46.720]  up because of al-qaeda they just publicly do all of this to where even those of us that
[56:46.720 --> 56:51.560]  know it's going on it's kind of like oh well I knew TSA checkpoints were coming oh there's
[56:51.560 --> 56:57.760]  one oh they're gonna search me they've got guns now oh oh it's for my safety oh sure
[56:57.760 --> 57:02.800]  it is yeah it's looking for drugs which the government is on record shipping the majority
[57:02.800 --> 57:09.140]  of in and and even the TSA all laugh and go hi no hi this is our job again it's about
[57:09.140 --> 57:16.880]  following orders oh you've got a bubble thing that projects bubbles we're gonna call it
[57:16.880 --> 57:22.320]  a gun and call the SWAT team a Hello Kitty well that's ridiculous it's meant to be ridiculous
[57:22.320 --> 57:26.600]  it's meant to just turn everything on its head until everything if the government's
[57:26.600 --> 57:30.680]  totally secret but you have no privacy that's backwards government's supposed to be wide
[57:30.680 --> 57:36.000]  open you've got total privacy unless there's an eyewitness naming the place person and
[57:36.000 --> 57:41.920]  things shining and affidavit swearing they saw this and if they're liars they're going
[57:41.920 --> 57:46.800]  to jail that's what you've got to do to spy on me that's what you've got to do to come

[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:58.740]  that guy of all people i mean what is the probability something's going on um or maybe
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:02.360]  it is that they've had people serve five six seven ters and put them on psychotropics this
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:06.300]  guy was under psychiatric care and the government did it to him that way either i mean it's
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:12.000]  government whether they staged it or not i mean we see extraordinary craziness happen
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.460]  because it's crazy and it's going to get crazier all the more reason we should have water filters
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:22.060]  guns be prepared try to move to the suburbs at least try to move out in the country if
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:27.820]  you can that's what all the elite are doing but when we do it oh it's weird uh he he's
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:33.700]  he's got guns and he's he's concerned about his security and uh and they even told their
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:39.140]  kids don't trust the government i'm sorry i i don't trust the government anymore because
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:43.520]  at the top it's run by bad people and more and more i see it trickling down more and
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.540]  more even if people in the government don't like it they're following unconstitutional
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:58.140]  orders they're following unconstitutional orders
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:05.780]  and i understand sometimes it isn't a perfect world or you know the nobody's perfect but
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:12.540]  i mean the system is really corrupt and don't you instinctively working for the system not
[01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:17.000]  want your kids and grandkids growing up in this i mean look i've said this a million
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:25.940]  times you'll probably never meet your great great grandson or daughter but if you could
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.940]  wouldn't you love them as much as your son or daughter today or your grandchildren today
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:34.440]  you know you would in fact there'd be a strange pride it wouldn't i mean i know my grandmother
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:43.580]  almost 90 years old my last grandparent living still sharp as a tack
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:49.420]  she really gets satisfaction you can see it in her eyes looking at her great-grandchildren
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:59.180]  think about it that's the woman who had my mother who had me and now i have children
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:04.280]  but if you think about it i touch my mother my mother touches her mother it's my children
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:10.520]  came out of my genetics my wife and i and then i come from my mother she comes from

[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:46.220]  2013 we've got a guest coming up the author of the Fix is In Brian Toohey is going to
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:50.620]  be coming on to get his take on the Super Bowl the power outage that looked pretty darn
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:09:01.840]  staged even Yahoo Sports says did Illuminati sign was it a signal that it the power was
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.040]  to go out how do you pronounce that woman's name I'm embarrassed I don't even know the
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:11.100]  name of these pop idiots Beyonce that's what I thought did Beyonce flash and Illuminati
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:18.400]  sign why did the Superdome power go out your Super Bowl mysteries solved so we're going
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:24.980]  to be going over that and again all a conspiracy theorist is now is someone who questions known
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:31.000]  liars in corporate globalist media and in a corrupt government now because people lost
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.500]  total faith in the system it doesn't mean that everybody out there with their own theory
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:39.740]  is right it doesn't mean all the alternative media is right it doesn't mean that I'm always
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:47.440]  right we're all imperfect creatures but we know the system has an authoritarian bent
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:54.060]  and a goal that it's pushing Reuters report contradicts Obama skeet shooting photo story
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:59.500]  said Obama played golf on August 4th retired for dinner and I gotta say Cass Sunstein the
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:03.880]  White House said we'll do cognitive infiltration we'll put out our own ridiculous conspiracy
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:08.560]  theories that are actually true but don't matter to just get everyone fighting over
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:15.540]  something and this doesn't look like any shotgun blast I've ever seen it looks like a smoke
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:20.380]  pop gun or something and I'm not saying Obama would you shoot a gun Obama's all about guns
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:24.940]  he's a gangster he's a globalist but just like they put out a fake birth certificate
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:30.380]  to get us all debating about it and then it turns out no he really was probably born in
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:36.220]  Hawaii but to a famous communist and they did cover up where he came from and have sealed
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:40.540]  his records and he had all these other different names and his mother was into all this weird
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:48.300]  stuff and that's why they say in his Harvard dissertation and when he was the head of the
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:55.120]  law review and just scores of publications he said for 17 years he was born in Kenya
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:00.100]  his wife said it and all that is to tantalize us they know that they throw that out they
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:07.540]  know that's a lie there's so many lies you can't get to the truth because it's just lies
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:14.260]  on lies on lies on lies during the break we had Fox News on out there and I saw Obama
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:19.580]  getting off Air Force One with Al Franken and I saw the Air Force officer walk over
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:24.700]  and greet them and everyone's sycophantically looking at them and groveling and Obama's
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:30.660]  getting off on the narcissistic power trip Al Franken is shaking with pleasure I remember
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:37.860]  reading about how Dennis Kucinich sold out on Obamacare and a bunch of other stuff so
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:45.260]  that so that he could get a ride on Air Force One I mean are we peacocks or are we humans
[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:50.020]  are we preening sycophantic peacocks I guess a lot of us are and I looked at everyone there
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:54.620]  they they were just getting off on the power getting off and the Air Force officer was
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:12:00.840]  Mr. President a bunch of sycophants and the Marines were getting off on it and Franken
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:08.240]  it was all a big joke what a big armored Cadillac and a Air Force One so you can shell out humanity
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:15.220]  and feel powerful about yourselves the stars are in the sky the universe incredible beauty
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:23.300]  your family your children everything good literature art these politicians and people
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:28.340]  they're not rock stars you know the reason people have admired literature and artists
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:34.140]  and actors and philosophers is because they do offer something beautiful music beautiful
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:40.300]  plays ideas they express things that touch our soul and build us up Shakespeare deserves
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:46.500]  to be admired you may say they're you know evil or whatever it doesn't matter the point
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:54.220]  is it's beautiful things like Led Zeppelin Beethoven and and different things touch different
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:13:03.280]  people that I would be giddy to be around somebody like Robert Plant not because he's
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:14.220]  a celebrity but because his voice has touched me so many times do you understand the difference
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:24.820]  and but then it's strange when you admire someone you then don't want to meet them because
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:33.560]  that would that would damage the the the the spiritual relationship understand the difference
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:40.100]  of what I'm saying here like I know where Robert Plant goes every week at a certain
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:45.500]  time here in Austin I would never go there to try to meet him and I'm not some big fan
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:49.260]  of Robert Plant it's just I'm trying to think who do what I want to meet I would want to
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:57.340]  meet somebody like Mother Teresa who helped people I would want to meet Ernest Borgnine
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:03.940]  which I had a chance to do was too busy and didn't do because I'm just not into it who
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:08.740]  Ted Knight I would love there you go I think I've said that Ted Knight you don't know who
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:16.380]  Ted Knight is oh don't fire me Lou look I said I'd go to your calls the point is that
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:20.060]  we're selling out for nothing in fact you guys actually taped it can you show when they
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:25.940]  get to the bottom of the game a gangplank walking down the steps they're off Air Force
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:32.180]  One and just the the the the faces they're making again if you're a radio listener you
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:35.340]  obviously can't see this but I'm showing it to TV viewers who are watching over info wars
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:42.180]  news.com and it just shows all of the satisfaction and I know the looks on faces those aren't
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:47.580]  looks of oh it's an exciting day or we just heard a funny joke or we're going somewhere
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:53.340]  really cool it's like we're with the cool president who's jogging we're all out here
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:59.860]  in the power structure you know we're I mean the Secret Service are all into their get-ups
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:04.020]  they're they're they're black trench coats and their submachine guns under them and see
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:08.340]  they don't like the fact that we have guns you see they want the exclusivity of having
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:11.980]  electricity and you're not going to have it they're going to turn your electricity off
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:15.500]  but in the government district they're going to have it they're going to be allowed to
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:20.780]  have kids you're not they're going to go places and fly over you and fly over country while
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:25.780]  you cling your Bibles because you're not going to have your guns they say you're bitter clingers
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:35.660]  you don't like them you're not in on the delusion and it's so incredibly empty it's so incredibly
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:40.980]  empty that's why I can't bring myself even though we're doing it building big fancy sets
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:45.780]  and going and getting fitted for a bunch of fancy suits but I've got to do it because
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:50.620]  if it'll get people to listen to what I'm saying so I can warn them I will wear a waiter
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:55.820]  outfit I will wear a high signet power in fact I was even thinking about it and then
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:16:00.500]  was amazed to see another talk show us do it where we could build a fake Oval Office
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:04.340]  and sit there and Brian broadcast from that and then everyone would fall down and do whatever
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:10.060]  I said but I don't want to manipulate through symbols I want you to become aware of the
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:15.800]  manipulation and become really conscious so that humanity can be risen up instead of driven
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:24.640]  down but just watching the faces of the just cringing with shaking with the power trip
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:30.980]  of we're exclusive we're here we've made it we've arrived and I've noticed all these sycophants
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:36.580]  is the same looks in North Korea and I've watched old film reels of other dictatorships
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:41.140]  and things going back a hundred years the people all look at the dictator or look at
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:45.620]  the puppet because through that they get their reflective power they have people that then
[01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:52.940]  under them look at them with this weird sycophantic strangeness I can't stand it people do it
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:17:03.140]  to me and it's just like pathetic I mean I would have loved to have met Stanley
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:12.320]  Kubrick I would have loved to have met Ernest Hemingway not that I even agree with his politics
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:18.140]  but his writing touched my heart his writing told things that I'd experience a different
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:31.780]  ways and I communed with his soul the truth is humans aren't pathetic failed creatures
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:36.260]  one side of this is but the globalists want to put us artificially into that we need to
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:40.140]  reach for the stars ladies and gentlemen all right I got a bunch of news coming up I said
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:44.060]  I'd go to your calls Eric in Colorado you're on the air you want to comment on the Super
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:55.460]  Bowl go ahead he dropped off okay let's go to Darren in Florida news reports and daughters
[01:17:55.460 --> 01:18:02.140]  meds okay go ahead well Alex can you hear me yes I can yes I wanted to first talk about
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:09.060]  Chris Kyle if I might the sniper go ahead okay sir because of what's been going on and
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:13.620]  listening to you and thanks ditto from what everybody says a great job you're doing I've
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:17.940]  begun to see a lot of things I hadn't really paid attention to before and my son who's
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:22.340]  in the ROTC called me late Saturday night to tell me about Chris Kyle I just couldn't
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:27.500]  believe it so yesterday morning before church I got up and started looking at all the all
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:32.220]  the news the local news paying very good attention to the local news that I could and I started
[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:35.780]  noticing some inconsistencies right off and I wanted to review them real quick with you
[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:43.340]  if I could and your listeners one the initial reports were saying that the suspect was was
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:48.300]  witnessed they heard gunshots about between three thirty four o'clock and then they saw
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:53.260]  someone driving off in a truck but no one actually saw the suspect shoot him this the
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:58.340]  second news thing came later saying that a hunter came to the lodge at five o'clock and
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:05.020]  found him dead well that's a pretty big inconsistency right there even more important the initial
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:11.500]  reports on fox five news and I listed the news but that's immaterial stated that he
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:16.860]  was apprehended on a stretch of highway I believe it was I-35 by Camp Wisdom Road and
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:20.960]  they showed they showed the cameras there on the police cars in the dark with the lights
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:26.340]  flashing however just like Sandy Hook they were not allowed to go up and view the person
[01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:29.820]  that they had in custody in the vehicle they said they got him out of the truck he's in
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:35.820]  the vehicle but the news persons were not allowed to show the guy's face on the camera
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:40.220]  listen listen the whole thing's suspicious what's the chance that Chris Kyle who's definitely
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:45.680]  involved in psyops against the American people but highly decorated ends up getting killed
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:50.740]  the whole thing is very very very suspicious I'm gonna come back and let you finish those
[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:54.780]  points then we'll go to all the rest of the callers we got Nick in Ireland who wants to

[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:23.280]  deadly sniper in US history self-billed a guy who in his book I'm not trying to run
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:26.800]  a dead guy down but you know I've had my problems and I've talked to Chris Kyle at length
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:32.940]  and being sued by Ventura he admitted in his book that he had lied to people about other
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:37.800]  stuff changed his story about Ventura later said it was outside nobody had basically seen
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:43.640]  it he has no witnesses Ventura has all these witnesses that it never happened the lawsuit
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:50.480]  was going forward and this guy was high up and he was published by a division of News
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:59.760]  Corp it was going to come out who put him up to this this psi up against Ventura and
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:04.320]  I talked to him at length on the Opie and Anthony show and he sounded like a nice guy
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:09.720]  on the surface and I don't know if he was set up I don't know what happened but the
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:15.040]  fact that he's killed and there's no witnesses and I looked up this lodge hundreds of people
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:21.720]  are there at any one time very suspicious that nobody saw it on a Saturday at three
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:27.680]  thirty in the afternoon yeah a lot of stuff and then you find the classic PTSD Marine
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:34.720]  at his house and I guess he'll come out and say he did it I mean we know the government
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:38.960]  got the underwear bomber on the plane that came out in Congress we know they order to
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:43.800]  stand down on seven seven we know they ran drills of the exact same trains being bombed
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:53.160]  at the exact same time and exact same locations so again they have a history of this yes you're
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:56.920]  not wrong to say they could have staged it because if they staged other mass shootings
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:02.100]  Operation Northwoods describes how to do it and how to even blame patsies just type in
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:06.640]  Operation Northwoods you'll be at the Library of Congress and you can read a what twelve
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:12.200]  page declassified memorandum green-lighted by LL M and sir chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:18.520]  to JFK's desk who vetoed it and then Bobby came back this has since been declassified
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:23.840]  it's even on frontline on PBS I've read this it was declassified about 15 years ago but
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:27.640]  it came out a few years ago mainstream news you can look it up Bobby Kennedy wanted to
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:36.080]  run a false flag against Nicaragua also they talked about bombing the Honduran Embassy
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:40.140]  and blaming it on the Honduran government don't believe me just type RFK wanted to run
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:49.040]  false flag against Honduras and Nicaragua look it up so yeah they do this stuff they're
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:54.240]  the people that do this out of thousands of graduate seals the last decade thousands and
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:59.900]  thousands it happens to this guy come on and seal team six the helicopter with 23 of them
[01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:04.160]  which they never put and said they were suspicious the mission was weird they weren't told where
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:08.960]  they were going they always basically are there was no planning this came out they were
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:14.080]  told get on the helicopter and we were told more evidence they were killed they went to
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:19.680]  save Army Rangers pinned down turned out that wasn't true see when they have a PR thing
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:25.000]  like yeah Pat Tillman was charging up an al-qaeda hill taking out al-qaeda turns out they murdered
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.440]  him but private Lynch was charged into the enemy territory at the convoy turned out she
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.780]  was cowering in fear rest of her unit fought the Iraqis the unit started speaking outs they
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:38.840]  killed four of them in one week car accidents shot in the back of the head one guy was barbecuing
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:44.400]  in Phoenix and a guy pops up in a black head to toe black uniform double taps him in the
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:48.920]  head at about 30 yards away and disappears and the police are like oh it's no big deal
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:53.520]  you know guy just pops up in a ninja outfit double taps you in the head that's not a government
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:28:01.700]  sniper or anything that's just exact training precision kill and private Lynch she went
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:06.840]  public I said you better go public or you're dead I don't know if she got the warning she
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:09.920]  came out three days later after those four people got killed in her unit that were speaking
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:13.960]  out she said it's all fake Pentagon told me to lie Jerry Bruckheimer was producing it
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:18.000]  Jerry Bruckheimer was scripting and telling him what to say and what to do when they did
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:24.880]  the fake raid on the hospital he was on a sat connection video sat telling the commander
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:31.240]  what to do on that raid how to stage it as she hid underneath the gurney three days after
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:36.140]  the Iraqi Republican Guard had pulled out three days after the doctors had come and
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:41.320]  said hey this area is open come she's here they sent people found it was true pulled
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:46.240]  back Jerry Bruckheimer directed the whole thing that's on record BBC even admitted it
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:51.800]  now there's the BBC admitting and they just meant as a footnote oh by the way it was directed
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:29:00.280]  by Jerry Bruckheimer directed by the director of Black Hawk Down now you think things might
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:04.080]  be fake I don't know caller go ahead and finish your point we only got a minute it's just
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:08.480]  and that's only the tip of the iceberg go ahead Alex it's just like you said you know
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:13.080]  then then the police found him at his home and they had footage of the cops by Holmes
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:16.320]  all in a row with the police car they were at the tape around it so which was he was
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:20.200]  he on the highway or was he caught at his home and all these inconsistent well you're
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:25.760]  always gonna get inconsistencies but but when it follows the pattern who this guy is
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:31.520]  come on folks if we don't think if we don't investigate that this was a setup we're chumps
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:38.480]  it might have been real what one chance out of ten what's your gut tell you what's your
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:44.480]  gut tell you on this my gut tells me they whacked him my gut tells me it's all staged
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:47.440]  they're gonna blame some mental patient and blame the Second Amendment and they're now

[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:31.080]  percent of the people that serve evil are compartmentalized and don't even know it sometimes
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:34.800]  it's easier to wake up somebody who actually works on the inside than the outside because
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:40.880]  they know it's true police are the easiest to wake up because they listen and they know
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:43.840]  man this guy knows what he's talking about how does he know all this this is what I've
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:48.760]  done for 17 years I know what you're going to be told before you get told it I know all
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:54.640]  the training the programs the brainwashing all of it okay military people this show is
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:38:00.280]  incredibly popular with the military unbelievably so it blows me away anytime I walk into a
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:05.040]  restaurant there's troops almost every time they come over in our listeners and I and
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:10.280]  they tell me how their whole unit listens and all bass listens and how I'm banned and
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:13.400]  how they tell them don't listen so everybody starts listening that's been going on for
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:17.800]  like 15 years I'm gonna go to our guests and then your calls I'm gonna go to Brendan and
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:21.640]  Donna and Eric and Eric and Derek we're gonna get to all of you our guest is just on for
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:27.200]  10 minutes with us the point is is that we've got a chance to really hurt the globalist
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.920]  and by the grace of God and your prayers I'm still alive and because there's a lot of good
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:37.800]  people in the system as well who've been compartmentalized we've got to get those compartmentalization
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:43.580]  membranes those bulkheads out of there so people can see for miles and miles not just
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:47.600]  what's right in front of them what's being shoved in front of them you got blinders on
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:51.400]  and they just shove under the tiny little blinder what you're allowed to see we need
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:57.880]  to get people seeing all around them we need to believe in humanity again God's creations
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:02.200]  we need to know God made us in his image to be leaders and builders not to be slaves of
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:08.760]  the devil in this system all right now that said we're gonna go to our guest I interviewed
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:12.320]  him a few months ago people really asked us to have him back so he is back the fix is
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:18.720]  in the showbiz manipulation of the NFL Major League Baseball NBA NHL and NASCAR and more
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:23.280]  and when I asked him what's the most corrupt is it boxing he said no not really it's probably
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:30.960]  basketball and again it is getting more and more corrupt because it is the new religion
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:38.040]  and people say don't touch my religion it is just unbelievable and we saw the power
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:44.800]  go off last night and you know they're saying this moment of electrifying football comedy
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:48.880]  brought to you by the greenest game in Super Bowl history and they're getting you used
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:53.600]  to it well green energy goes off but it's for the earth and they have global earth day
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.360]  and earth hour and all these other days turn your power off they've had other sporting
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:02.340]  events where they turn it off on purpose Enron got caught turning power off to condition
[01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:06.800]  people that there's not enough power so everyone will accept higher power prices all over the
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:12.220]  country power prices are going up and all over the world they precipitate power prices
[01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:18.440]  going up by turning the power off on purpose to create the perception of scarcity it is
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:23.600]  a mass hoax and I believe from knowing what I know and I covered it last hour that this
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:31.900]  was probably staged I don't know Brian Toohey's take on this but we're going to get his take
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:36.940]  he's the author of the fixes in the showbiz manipulators of sports recognizes America's
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:44.600]  leading expert on game fixing and sports he's been interviewed by everything XM ESPN you
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:50.840]  name it this show Coast to Coast AM with George Norie you name it and he joins us and of course
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.120]  sports is used to have little kids from Sandy Hook to demonize the Second Amendment exploit
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:59.560]  them and to have ads running against the Second Amendment it's like the running man in the
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:04.800]  Stephen King novel the running man that got turned into a movie the short story that's
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:10.480]  what it is sports has always been the heart of the Nazi regime the heart of the Soviet
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:15.920]  regime the heart of the Roman regime the heart of society's manipulating people it's the
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:22.480]  big grand pageant so the globalists the controllers can inject their propaganda I'm not even saying
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:27.680]  sport if you're in sports they're great I think sports are the best thing for children
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:32.160]  I think they're one of the few wholesome things left but at the top it's rotten at the top
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:40.000]  it's disgusting at the at the top it's Lance Armstrong it's a dirty joke well the Bible
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.360]  says wickedness is in high places so of the book the fixes in available discounted at
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.800]  info or shop calm support the author support us get the truth out he joins us now what
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:53.660]  was your take overall first on the Super Bowl and then the blackout did you see any any
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:57.440]  signs there you know one team's winning and then the blackout happens and then the momentum
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:01.800]  changes to me that's not where the real fixes would be but you're the expert Brian good
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:06.680]  to have you it's good to be on again Alex good to hear from you with the Super Bowl
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:10.160]  before we get into that quick I don't know did you happen to see the sports page of the
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:15.520]  New York Times today at all no I didn't okay there's a big thing in soccer which is the
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.280]  world's game literally the world's game most popular game in the world they had a big announcement
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:26.160]  regarding over probably 600 different soccer matches that have been fixed worldwide recently
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:30.800]  and they think it's all pinpointed perhaps to one guy in Singapore and I mean these are
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:34.800]  literally soccer matches that every letter full all the way up to the World Cup which
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:38.760]  is even bigger than the Super Bowl and so I hear from a lot of people say well you know
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:43.400]  you can't fix the game well here's a little proof that games have been fixed literally
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:48.240]  worldwide literally in the biggest sport and the biggest stage out there and yet people
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:52.160]  think you know nobody can mess with the Super Bowl and I just find that absurd because you
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:56.640]  look at what happened last night and you've seen that the referees made calls that should
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:01.320]  have not been made it there calls that they overlooked that should have been made and
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:04.720]  then you had this whole blackout which you know literally has everybody in the country
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:09.440]  talking about the Super Bowl whether you want to or not and we did find that article we'll
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:15.660]  put it back up on screen for TV viewers over at mfallwarsnews.com investigation finds suspected
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:23.120]  fixing in 680 soccer matches and scanning over that while you were talking I noticed
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:27.080]  that it's exactly what you wrote in your book how they're doing it because you've read the
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:28.080]  FBI files.
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:32.800]  Well exactly I mean I know that I know that games in the NFL have been fixed I know games
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:36.760]  in the NBA have been fixed in Major League Baseball and I know that they're still investigating
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:41.360]  potential fixed games today the problem is you don't hear about it because they don't
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:44.120]  want you to hear about it because they don't want you to think that something like this
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:48.120]  could be corrupted because they want to distract you and they want to entertain you and they
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:51.560]  don't want you to think about this sort of corruption within the game but it's true that
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:56.840]  it has to be there I mean the NFL says we've never had a game fixed by anyone ever and
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:02.200]  I've talked to numerous guys in sports books on both sides of the you know both sides of
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:05.600]  the window guys who booked the bets guys who are making the bets and they'll say to a man
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:09.680]  that that's absurd that of course games have been fixed but you can't prove these things
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:13.480]  because you can't find the proof you can't find the evidence because there is no concrete
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:18.320]  evidence of this sort of behavior so this is a big deal last night and you see that
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:22.080]  game you know it's very likely that last night's game was manipulated to keep it interesting
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:26.680]  to the very end to literally the last play of the game because it made CBS happy that
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:33.000]  made the advertisers happy and it made the NFL happy go over the numbers on sports betting
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.200]  just in the United States well sports betting there's no been no good estimate because it's
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:42.840]  all illegal I mean literally only perhaps as much as one percent of the amount of money
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:48.480]  gambled on sporting events the United States has done legally in Las Vegas and Nevada otherwise
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:54.600]  they estimate anywhere from 80 to 380 billion dollars is wagered illegally on this country
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:45:01.800]  on sporting events each year which even if you take the low estimate the 80 billion dollars
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:06.040]  it's nearly four times as much money as the NFL, NBA, Major League Baseball and the National
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:10.960]  Hockey League combined.
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:17.560]  It's amazing numbers we're talking about here did you see any signs overtly of manipulation
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:22.160]  last night I mean I guess you're saying you did break down how they do that well the main
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:27.860]  thing the legal way and it's the scary part is it is legal for like if the NFL wanted
[01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:31.360]  to fix its own game if they wanted to fix the Super Bowl last night or manipulate it
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:35.640]  they can do so legally because there's no law that prevents them from doing that and
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:38.880]  the easiest way to do it would be through the referees now last night they had this
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:44.520]  referee named Boger who was admittedly probably one of the middle ranked of their own officiating
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:49.240]  crew and yet he wanted to officiate in the biggest game of the year which is not the
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:53.480]  way the NFL is supposed to do it but a lot of people think because he was African American
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:57.720]  that he got put on this main stage just because of that and now you have this guy on this
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:01.760]  big stage and then you see clearly like especially late in the game calls that should have been
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:05.560]  made penalties that should have been called on the Ravens that weren't called that weren't
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:10.200]  assessed and you had guys like Phil Simms on CBS broadcast at first saying oh that was
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:15.120]  a good no call and then as the game progressed he said well maybe they should have made that
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:18.360]  call but I guess they're just letting them play out there well apparently if you have
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:22.920]  a rule book in the NFL it doesn't always apply you can apply the rules when you want to and
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:28.760]  obviously obviously he's been told to do this if it is fixed and so he's not going to get
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:35.520]  in trouble and that's why you see these obvious calls that are meant to keep the game close
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:41.760]  or longer exactly and that benefits everybody involved everybody is making more money because
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:45.880]  of that because you know when's the last time we had a Super Bowl that wasn't really interesting
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:50.440]  there was a blow-off it's been over a decade since that happened and I just don't I don't
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:55.320]  believe in coincidence when billions of dollars are at stake and notice they say that this
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:47:00.300]  was the highest rated and made the most money ever well and the scary part is I mean how
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:06.160]  many people voted in the last presidential election like 126 million I think give or
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:11.400]  take and that's probably pretty much the same amount of people in the United States who
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:16.720]  watch a Super Bowl last night does that say something about our country and in not necessarily
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:20.880]  the best of ways that we're more interested in a football game than perhaps who is in
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:24.480]  control of our government
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:29.680]  it is the modern bread and circus the opiate of the masses now what about the power outage
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:34.920]  that's like the clue game or everybody's at the castle and the lights go off and somebody's
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:39.000]  got a steak knife stuck in their chest and then the rest of the you know movie you're
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.960]  trying to find out who did it and then oh it's green energy we've got to get used to
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:50.280]  the power going off I've seen them turn the power off for a few minutes to show that energy
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:56.060]  is bad at soccer games in Europe and things I think it was staged I think they did this
[01:47:56.060 --> 01:48:03.060]  on purpose to keep the game going to make everybody hyped them their awareness to have
[01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:08.600]  something different go on what do you think I agree with you I don't think it was necessarily
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:13.880]  legit but in fact that it was really truly just somebody screwed up somewhere I mean
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:17.480]  I've heard real people say that the NFL did it on purpose like you say to make it more
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:22.000]  interesting to get people talking about the game I've heard people say that city New Orleans
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.600]  did it basically as revenge against the NFL because of the bounty skate bounty gate scandal
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:32.360]  within the NFL that really punished the New Orleans Saints I've heard a lot of different
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:36.360]  things and nobody it's amazing that nobody even from the city of New Orleans from the
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:41.640]  power company there has said publicly what happened well you would think by now they
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:45.040]  would have been pretty easy to figure it out because they got the lights back on within
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:50.340]  30 minutes so it couldn't have been that big of a deal well here's the issue here's the
[01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:56.160]  issue they turn the lights on all the time they know what they're doing and it just shows
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:00.700]  the arrogance of the system that things like this happen but hey people don't just believe
[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:05.700]  now the official story they're told anymore that it was just a snafu that shows the power
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:10.600]  structure is losing all its credibility where do you see this going for sports just bigger
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:14.680]  and bigger and maybe you know the games get even more tight and it gets more obvious but
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:19.280]  people don't care because the ticket says it's only entertainment well that's the main
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:23.560]  thing it is only entertainment it is just show business but i think at a certain point
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:28.520]  in time these things at least the united states has to reach a saturation level where it can't
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:33.280]  get much bigger unless they put on more and more of a production where it becomes more
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:38.400]  than sport which is fine where but where it becomes like you say show business where it's
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:42.080]  not fine and where people start seeing through it i mean you know you only watch so much
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:46.800]  reality tv before you realize well you know this isn't all real you know they're staging
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:50.360]  some of this they're making these things occur because they have to keep the show interesting
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:54.560]  well that's exactly what i think they do with sports that they stage certain things they
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:58.720]  promote certain teams they promote certain players and make sure those teams and players
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:03.680]  succeed because they think it makes it a better production it makes people well they're also
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:09.160]  blurring the lines between reality and fiction where the zero dark 30 they have the white
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:13.880]  house and the senate come out and say hardly any of this is accurate this is all wrong
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:19.240]  but it's the original fake story the white house put out but then they put a disclaimer
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:24.160]  oh this is inaccurate but people go and i've sat there in restaurants repeatedly because
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:27.760]  i've gone to a restaurant twice right by a movie theater and i heard people talk about
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:33.520]  oh it's a true story it's so incredible we just saw zero dark 30 and the thing is literally
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:37.920]  a work of fiction yeah and that's why i think you know your sporting events are going the
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:44.760]  same way do one more segment with us i want to ask what else is on the radar screen and
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:50.760]  what this big soccer report absolutely validating what you've been saying means to this this
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:55.760]  this giant hoax that is modern professional sports then i promise when we start the next
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:51:03.500]  hour callers i'm going to you straight up attention gardeners and patriots drought conditions
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:07.760]  in our nation's heartland and massive federal reserve debt monetizing are creating the
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:12.480]  perfect conditions for dramatically higher food prices in the months ahead that means

[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:12.160]  you know i gotta be honest with you i only talked to chris kyle once for about 45 minutes
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:19.960]  or so i guess i liked him i mean he came off like a real guy i guess he's from dallas like
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:29.120]  i am or outside dallas like i am and i but i know jesse ventura never talks about wanting
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:33.440]  troops to die and i've actually seen him tear up before all this happened talking and driving
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:37.400]  in my car talking about troops being killed because he really loves the military all these
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:42.320]  guys do did and that's ventura first said i think his gut was right he goes do you think
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:47.520]  they had a double as a setup to set him up that's the first thing jesse ventura said
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:51.820]  last year when i called him and he had to go into town to send an email to get on the
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:59.640]  phone with me and he's like alex he had his wife there and he had it on speaker i guess
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:02.920]  in a hotel room or whatever he's like alex ah you know you're joking this isn't real
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:09.360]  lee come on and so i know ventura didn't do this and i just don't know what they did to
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:14.600]  chris kyle but i think they killed him i mean just i was here reading this new article that
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:20.880]  just went up at info wars.com just went up murdered navy seal was obama gun control foe
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:24.760]  and i've actually seen this video this weekend where he was he was working and going to a
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:30.480]  national campaign to get armed teachers and they just do not want somebody out there who's
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:34.840]  got that type of credibility just like pat tillman was going to come home and bad mouth
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:40.360]  the opium and stuff and they killed him murdered navy seal chris kyle gunned down at point
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:45.680]  blank range in texas this past weekend was emerging as a prominent gun control critic
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:50.760]  working to place armed guards in schools in the aftermath of the sandy hook massacre very
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:58.260]  important article by paul watson and i it's not just that he's dead i mean i i i've said
[01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:01.760]  bad things about him like you know he talks about lying in his book he talks about lying
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:07.880]  for operations or whatever um it's not good to talk ill of the dead especially if you
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:14.840]  don't know they were a bad person i just am just really really upset right now by the
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:19.760]  way a lot of prominent pro-gun people are being killed and if this continues we know
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:25.040]  there's a purge and atf is visiting gun owners that buy just one gun two guns buy ammo they're
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:29.680]  harassing people uh homeland security says we're the new terrorist and man this is this
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:35.040]  is bad this is bad they say returning vets are the number one enemy and obama's got an
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:38.880]  nda we're going to come back the next hour go directly to brenda and others that are
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:44.600]  holding the fix is in brown we got about three minutes how big is this soccer situation where
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:50.720]  it's now coming out okay lance armstrong did dope okay yeah the soccer games are fixed
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:55.100]  uh i mean this is this is a big deal if this ever starts coming out will it hurt things
[01:56:55.100 --> 01:56:58.600]  or will it just be like going to disney world to watch a football game you know it's fake
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:04.440]  but you know that uh sky mountain or whatever still is pretty fun i think you look at professional
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:08.280]  wrestling and you can see that where people don't necessarily care that it's fake but
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:12.680]  it's still a good entertainment it's still you know good show of physical prowess on
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:16.720]  these people apart but you look at soccer like you say the thing that worries me the
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:20.800]  thing that scares me it should scare a lot of sports fans in this country is if you can
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:24.360]  look around the world and you can see as many games have been fixed apparently in soccer
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:29.200]  there's i think 680 they mentioned that article alone and that's not covering everything that's
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:33.320]  just one investigation i mean you look at tennis has been fixed you look at cricket
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:36.960]  that's been fixed rugby games have been fixed but then you look here in the united states
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:41.160]  and supposedly everything's fine you know nothing no football no baseball no basketball
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:45.880]  no hockey well we're a free country i mean come on nothing the government private corporations
[01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:52.000]  i mean jaeger hoover said the mafia was a conspiracy theory in 1952 well exactly and
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:56.840]  that's that's the part that should be frightening sports fans because you can't look at these
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:00.800]  games and say they can't be fixed not when there's that much money being illegally gambled
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:05.400]  out there that money has the power to corrupt because it's all going to organize crime they're
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:11.920]  the ones who will run these illegal bookmakers and the power is crazy and zabigda brzezinski
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:16.360]  has written three books admitting that the globalists run organized crime well of course

[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:20.400]  watching uh grown adults watched their chase balls around on fields years ago when i became
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:26.600]  much more of an infowars uh listener and fan and i thank you for that um uh but i did tune
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:35.240]  in last night with my girlfriend who um knows that many of the things that uh info warriors
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:41.000]  talk about are true but doesn't always want to deal with the uh thought process so i said
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:46.160]  hey look we gotta watch the halftime show i know it's gonna be schlocky but i really
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:51.580]  want to see based off of last year's show how many overt illuminati signs there would
[02:01:51.580 --> 02:02:00.120]  be and so it's going on you know as it progressed not many um light show pyramids and eyeballs
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:03.880]  and stuff but then you see all these people in the crowd sticking their hands up there
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:10.640]  the tallest people in the crowd i'm sure planted there and they're doing their pyramid you
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:16.920]  know hand signs i said and i i told her about that ahead of time and uh she said no you're
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:21.000]  just making you know it's funny you say that because again i dropped by a party for about
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.240]  an hour last night at a restaurant that shut down for the super bowl and so i went to a
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:30.360]  crew party that i was invited to uh over at that restaurant nice restaurant the point
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:35.080]  is putting a plug for steiner steakhouse and i'm over there with shane steiner and i'm
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:41.200]  sitting there and one of the only times i was watching i looked up and i see the crowd
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:45.440]  them showing people doing illuminati signs and my critics will now take that as a still
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:52.200]  and say i'm doing that uh but sure enough you just called in about it and i'm so conditioned
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:57.440]  i got in today and i'm not even telling my crew hey go get the halftime show show people
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:03.640]  this that's how they get you it's like now it's an open secret they had weirdos standing
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:10.200]  up everywhere and then beyonce show a document cam shot of this if you can she does the illuminati
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:15.160]  symbol tell folks what you saw because i barely watched and caught some of that and i'm like
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:20.340]  really did i just see that tell folks what you saw and i and i have more points on that
[02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:25.480]  as well because you know tell me what you saw tell me what you saw i definitely i definitely
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:30.640]  saw the tallest people in the crowd with gold you'll see this year the whole theme is gold
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:36.440]  and black every award show everything going on in the gold bracelet doing clear pyramid
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:42.640]  hand signs right in the camera shot the tallest people there are in those hands are the ones
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:47.480]  that are lit up by the lights not only that i said she said well i want to see don't and
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:51.760]  abby if the power's out and i said it doesn't matter turn back turn back to the super bowl
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:57.760]  after 33 minutes oh my gosh it was a ritual they turned the light off and of course it
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:02.880]  always has multiple uses just coming too fast now and then they're the thousand points of
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:07.920]  light that's the highest illuminati type operation scallom bones george bush senior talks about
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:13.280]  it and so they have a thousand people stand up and do the illuminati sign when the lights
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:20.320]  off saying we're going to bring the light back yeah and the play-by-play guy at 27 minutes
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:25.320]  if anyone who's t-bowed this i haven't gone back to it one of the guys says he trips himself
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:30.680]  up and he says we're now in the 27th minute of power outage and blah blah and my girlfriend
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:35.000]  said well can i flip it down to abby i said sure you know give five more minutes we got
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:40.240]  to go back to it that's when it'll be back on and she thinks that i'm full of baloney
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:46.040]  and uh and sure enough that's what happened but at the 27th minute when i checked the
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:51.440]  guy trips himself up and he starts to say we're now 27 minutes into it and then he starts
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:57.320]  to say 30 blah blah blah and he cuts himself off stay there oh my gosh they believe they

[02:12:58.820 --> 02:13:03.800]  weird how it's all just out in the open and then they say oh you didn't see anything see
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:07.440]  it's out in the open but it's meant to hit the subconscious public who's on awake when
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:14.040]  we're awake and we go hey hey look illuminati ritual it goes dark for 33 minutes we looked
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:24.600]  it up 33 minutes 55 seconds just shy of 34 minutes and she does bathomet squatting all
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:32.600]  of this god help us god help us god help us i mean they are doing giant babylonian satanic
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:43.040]  egyptian rituals in front of everyone and it is just so completely out of control that
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:47.160]  we've come down to this and see the caller calls in if you didn't hear it i'm going to
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:51.200]  go back to him to recap everything he said then i'll go to others because we've got to
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:54.880]  hurry against the rest of the callers before lord montan pops in and i'm i wasn't even
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:59.440]  going to cover this i came in this morning okay they did the illuminati symbols they
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:04.080]  tell all the hip-hop people do that to sell it is cool just like they told you know hulk
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:08.440]  hogan have a group called the new world order after bush started talking about it bush senior
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:11.360]  then people go oh you're talking about the new world order they've got to acclimate you
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:16.280]  that it's non-threatening and a joke and then yahoo's like people claim there's something
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:21.360]  called the illuminati it's a historical fact it's just one branch of illusiferian order
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:26.920]  who publicly it's mainline history founded skull and bones the illuminati founded skull
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:34.040]  and bones in 1832 it's chapter 322 which means the uncompleted because it's below the 33rd
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:41.920]  32 degree you know that's masonic yes the general masons have not been satanic themselves
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:46.440]  but an ancient construction guild with hidden knowledge but it predates judaism and christianity
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:52.600]  so it is a cultic it was christianized you didn't just get into a university and learn
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:57.720]  mathematics that was valuable so it got guarded by an intelligence agency you call it a secret
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:01.960]  society because if you just indict masons you drive them away from the truth to being
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:07.320]  honest about the fact that there's a war inside of the system with the illuminati trying to
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:17.520]  take it over this is so disgusting see the most evil people know that really good truly
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:22.360]  enlightened real illuminated people that just means awoken by god's light are going to
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:25.680]  stand up for human liberty try to build it up so the evil comes in and says oh we're
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:31.680]  good too we want to empower humanity join our order it's the real it's above the 33rd
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:41.000]  degree you see and they're just doing giant rituals just
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:48.360]  like david ike said i mean they do these giant rituals they admit their rituals at the big
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:58.120]  events out there like the olympics and now they have a 33 minute darkness with with weirdos
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:04.800]  standing up in the crowd doing the hand sign magnifying with her up on the stage who did
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:11.920]  the hand sign during the darkness during the 33 minutes i mean this was a stinking ritual
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:15.880]  and the media is going to pick this up and call me crazy because they know they don't
[02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:20.800]  want you to know they want to initiate your subconscious so you're in their cult but never
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:26.520]  consciously new they don't want you to have free will they america is under a dark spell
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:32.520]  we are under witchcraft folks this is real they've proven it it's scientific the ancients
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:42.360]  just called it witchcraft we've been mesmerized hypnotized put into this and it's right there
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:48.640]  they're all big on top big pyramids flashing illuminati signs with the lights going out
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:53.880]  and i'm the conspiracy theorist there it is there it is what is this like five super bowls
[02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:58.480]  in a row they've done this janet jackson's breast pops out oh she goes oops and there's
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:05.040]  a sun sign and all the rest of this garbage they've got to do it they want your attention
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:09.040]  they are doing rituals because they believe they're affecting you know whether you believe
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:13.480]  in god or not believe in the spiritual world they teach you it's smart to not believe in
[02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:18.340]  the spiritual world because you can't see it well this this this domain this five senses
[02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:23.600]  third dimension is is only one it's been proven mathematically what all the ancients said
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:29.400]  there are all these other layers above us all this full spectrum it's there and whether
[02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:36.600]  it's real or not whether there's things inhabiting that or not intelligences the elites believe
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:41.680]  it's giving them power they believe they are in contact with entities across the void they
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:46.860]  believe they've got power from it so they are in power whether they believe they got
[02:17:46.860 --> 02:17:50.860]  the power from it and just had confidence from it or whether they really are getting
[02:17:50.860 --> 02:17:57.320]  the power from it you cannot debate the fact they are worshipping devilish entities and
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:00.860]  look at what the elite does look at how they're trying to wreck the family how they're trying
[02:18:00.860 --> 02:18:04.660]  to wreck liberty how they're trying to bring in tyranny how they're doing all of this they're
[02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:09.000]  doing all of this in your face and see i'm so sick of it and i was watching this when
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.680]  i was calm last night i was put under a little bit of a trance i wasn't even going to come
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:20.120]  in and cover it until the caller called in and shifted me back into being aware you see
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:27.900]  how dangerous it is to watch stuff like that wow what an epiphany i just had brendan in
[02:18:27.900 --> 02:18:31.240]  wisconsin you only got about a minute and a half recap your points and then finish the
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:37.800]  other ones okay i'm i'm gonna recap that yeah you see the illuminati hand signs but the
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:42.720]  triangles from the crowd it's of the people right and the and the and the spotlights are
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:47.840]  only hitting those really tall hands right in the front that's one point 33 minutes the
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:53.520]  nfl or cbs was saying 34 minutes no no i looked it up this morning it was 33 minutes usa today
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:58.920]  i'll be 33.55 now we timed it now specifically because we're gonna go pull it up i saw it

[02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:35.120]  i don't know if that's significant 3 2 2 now it's all significant it's all staged and i

[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:59.520]  uh let's talk to derek in texas derek you're on the air welcome alex thank you it's an
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:05.280]  honor to speak to you 13 year listener first time caller god bless i'll call it i'm calling
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:09.320]  this find out your opinion about piers morgan coming here to tactical firearms in katie
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:16.080]  texas he's coming here to report tonight apparently about uh he's gonna be shooting a gun there
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:23.480]  and i heard that the owner of the tactical firearms was once deported an ammunition van
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:29.640]  say that again the owner of tactical fire no start over at the beginning usually they're
[02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:32.840]  not telling me stuff and it's not their fault they're supposed to talk to me they're telling
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:37.640]  me lord monkton was there and i missed the first part of what she said start over i'm
[02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:43.400]  sorry piers morgan is supposed to be reporting at tactical firearms in katie texas tonight
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:48.600]  he's supposed he's supposed to be shooting a gun talking about um background checks mental
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:54.760]  health and uh i think it's interesting because the owner of tactical firearms has once been
[02:25:54.760 --> 02:26:01.160]  on the radio supporting an ammunition ban i didn't know that slime morgan was going
[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:06.280]  to be here because again he doesn't have a big audience sometimes the stuff on his show
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:11.840]  gets played on other shows so it only has a big audience when what he does is a derivative
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:18.200]  and then he gets a tiny amount of actual viewers to his show from that he has biggest shows
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:22.200]  like half a million when i was on like a million and 800,000 the next day and then it went
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:29.920]  down from there uh but katie texas uh he's gonna be uh he's gonna be there himself shooting
[02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:36.280]  so that's that's the room the rumor had it that he was coming to a gun gun shop in texas
[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:42.680]  and then uh he proved it on his twitter account two days ago he is coming to tactical firearms
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:46.320]  and uh it's happening right down the street from me i was just curious if anybody from
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:50.080]  your crew is going to be there reporting or if i should go try to get some photos or what
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:55.000]  i haven't gotten any response from tactical firearms themselves i don't really know uh
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:01.240]  the full details but um i was shocked to hear it and uh i just i just hope someone in your
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:07.400]  crew is covering it well katie's katie's pretty close to texas no no he's saying the guy put
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:13.080]  a twitter out he's saying go to piers morgan's twitter guys that's how you confirm it um
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:19.560]  so piers morgan you're saying put it out on twitter yes piers piers morgan is coming to
[02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:27.200]  houston let's put that back up on screen for viewers tactical firearms is very very proud
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:35.200]  of that and he's going to a facility where they support restricting our second amendment
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:42.000]  isn't that just classic yeah are you have you been aware of the of that owner um you
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:47.200]  know uh being supportive of all this gun control legislation and whatnot and then no i wasn't
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:50.160]  aware of that but you know what they're gonna do they're gonna come down here and go i'm
[02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:54.180]  here in the heart of the crazy texans but even these texans want to turn their guns
[02:27:54.180 --> 02:28:00.520]  in i don't dislike texans sure i'm a red coat while your ancestors trounced the filthy king
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:06.960]  i worship i mean just unbelievable i felt exactly the same way when i woke up i was
[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:12.800]  furious i couldn't believe that well listen everybody should go you know it's a private
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:17.960]  facility so it's private property but everybody should go and be part of it and try to be
[02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:23.000]  interviewed by cnn and i think people ought to be across the street from it it's a free
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:28.640]  country bullhorning piers morgan and protesting his butt i don't know if i've got time to
[02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:34.200]  get in the car and get down there i mean how far away is katie from austin it's only about
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:39.920]  an hour and 45 minutes on a good drive from you um i was just shocked yeah why are they
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:44.520]  saying houston cnn doesn't even know when i heard katie and then the news said houston
[02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:50.240]  i'm like katie's not houston well exactly i actually live right in right where he where
[02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:56.040]  it's going to be and katie it's zoned in uh in houston like we're technically houston
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:29:03.760]  but i have to put katie in all my addresses so it's it's in uh harris county oh that's
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:07.560]  why it seems like it's closer to austin it's out west of there towards austin and houston
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:13.880]  so huge that once you're uh outside there wow that's about two hours away isn't it yeah
[02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:19.800]  it's a lot closer to you than than uh downtown houston i guess technically they could then
[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:26.240]  say houston because houston's a mega giant punch it back up folks tactical firearms everybody
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:31.840]  needs to get over there and get in his face you know and he likes to spin it like it's

[02:36:17.620 --> 02:36:21.780]  you for coming on with us alex it's a real pleasure to be with you and congratulations
[02:36:21.780 --> 02:36:26.460]  on your wonderful interview with piers morgan on gun control i wonder how many tens of millions
[02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:31.380]  have seen it now uh it is tens of millions airing on every tv station out there and also
[02:36:31.380 --> 02:36:34.940]  tens of millions online but but you know i actually was under the weather that day and
[02:36:34.940 --> 02:36:40.300]  blew up at him but i'm glad i did because it got people out of their coma we need to
[02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:45.360]  get aggressive with these people and he tried to spin it that i'm being anti-uk i'm actually
[02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:51.420]  pro-uk in england i want you to be a sovereign country not under eu domination my ancestors
[02:36:51.420 --> 02:36:56.860]  uh... come from uh... wales in england and scotland ireland piers morgan's tried to
[02:36:56.860 --> 02:37:03.140]  spin it though and so so is the british press that i'm i'm being anti anti-british i'm anti
[02:37:03.140 --> 02:37:07.980]  being disarmed it's not british to have your weapons taken in fact you guys always had
[02:37:07.980 --> 02:37:12.260]  the right to keep mere arms until it was taken by the collectivist you want to briefly speak
[02:37:12.260 --> 02:37:17.860]  to that well certainly i mean we we had a shooting incident like the one that has provoked
[02:37:17.860 --> 02:37:23.460]  the latest round of demands for gun control in the u s this was a done blaine in scotland
[02:37:23.460 --> 02:37:28.020]  and unfortunately it happened during a socialist government and of course whenever the socialists
[02:37:28.020 --> 02:37:33.900]  get the chance to tighten up on legislation they will and so there was a knee-jerk reaction
[02:37:33.900 --> 02:37:40.820]  in parliament and a law was passed to take away our hand guns which were almost entirely
[02:37:40.820 --> 02:37:46.220]  held in private collections and were shot privately on ranges under supervision it was
[02:37:46.220 --> 02:37:51.260]  all very well control as you can imagine in the uk and anyway all of that was swept away
[02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:58.740]  but the result was the interesting thing crime involving hand guns went up by forty percent
[02:37:58.740 --> 02:38:05.440]  the moment they took our hand guns away because once you drive the ownership of guns underground
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:10.380]  then all you do is you criminalize it and that increases the use of guns in crime it
[02:38:10.380 --> 02:38:18.180]  does not reduce it it certainly does now you talk about that the the the new face of fascism
[02:38:18.180 --> 02:38:22.220]  agenda 21 people are starting to wake up to it but you've traveled australia that's been
[02:38:22.220 --> 02:38:26.320]  captured uh by this even though the people are awake and don't like it in polls i've
[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:31.540]  seen it doesn't matter what government they put in it just continues break down how draconian
[02:38:31.540 --> 02:38:38.620]  it is in a country what four five years ahead of uh other nations well that's right see
[02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:45.540]  the european dictatorship and the dictatorship of julia gillard the communist from wales
[02:38:45.540 --> 02:38:52.140]  who runs australia at the moment and is at the moment herself facing an extremely serious
[02:38:52.140 --> 02:38:57.060]  criminal investigation which is getting very very close to her and that's one of the reasons
[02:38:57.060 --> 02:39:02.220]  why she's announced the um election uh that they're about to have and she's announced
[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:07.380]  it seven months before is going to be held the other reason why she's announced an earlier
[02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:13.300]  question incidentally is that kevin rudd the man whom she displaced with an internal coup
[02:39:13.300 --> 02:39:17.540]  in the labor party is the kind of thing that communists do to each other all the time uh
[02:39:17.540 --> 02:39:22.380]  she had heard that next month he was going to mount a leadership challenge to get back
[02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:28.520]  the premiership from her and that he had the numbers to do it she's become very unpopular
[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:33.500]  even within her own party and of course she's uh even more unpopular i think than obama
[02:39:33.500 --> 02:39:39.720]  uh with her opponents here and so she heard he was mounting this challenge and that he'd
[02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:44.940]  got the numbers in the parliamentary labor party to to to win and so what she did was
[02:39:44.940 --> 02:39:49.780]  to announce the date of the election very hastily because then if he were to announce
[02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:54.820]  a leadership challenge it would seem to the party like downright disloyalty not just to
[02:39:54.820 --> 02:39:59.780]  her but to the party as a whole and then he wouldn't have the numbers so it was a master
[02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:05.180]  stroke on her part and of course she can also take advantage of the fact that during the
[02:40:05.180 --> 02:40:10.020]  campaigning which has effectively already begun she can do all of her campaigning on
[02:40:10.020 --> 02:40:14.820]  the government's dime while the opposition can't so she's hoping to gain advantage from
[02:40:14.820 --> 02:40:20.540]  it but she is getting very close to having her collar felt in a criminal investigation
[02:40:20.540 --> 02:40:26.300]  i can't give more details over the air but it's certainly something which i'm not sure
[02:40:26.300 --> 02:40:31.960]  she'll even last out until september because they are getting that close to her now but
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:36.740]  in the meantime she and her government introduced what is called a carbon tax they were originally
[02:40:36.740 --> 02:40:41.660]  going to charge larger companies and fossil fuel companies and big manufacturers and farmers
[02:40:41.660 --> 02:40:49.220]  and miners and fishermen they were going to charge them 23 dollars for every ton of carbon
[02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:55.420]  dioxide they emitted as part of the their electricity use it was going to be enormously
[02:40:55.420 --> 02:41:01.980]  cripplingly expensive it was going to shut down the economy of australia unfortunately
[02:41:01.980 --> 02:41:07.940]  uh the opposition here led by tony abbott who is a very thoughtful quiet and extremely
[02:41:07.940 --> 02:41:14.260]  determined man managed to divert her away from doing that and in the end she cut and
[02:41:14.260 --> 02:41:20.420]  ran and said no we can't charge 23 dollars a ton when the rest of the world is only paying
[02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:24.140]  or at least the eu which is the only other place that's really got a carbon tax is only
[02:41:24.140 --> 02:41:30.020]  paying at the moment kind of two or three dollars a ton and so she decided to link the
[02:41:30.020 --> 02:41:36.700]  carbon tax here with the european trading scheme so that the same price is charged for
[02:41:36.700 --> 02:41:41.720]  carbon dioxide here as in europe and of course she will go on the television and say that
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:47.200]  what she's demonstrating is leadership in doing this but the rest of the world is conspicuously
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:53.300]  not following even of course obama's united states is not going to have the cab and text
[02:41:53.300 --> 02:41:58.380]  and of course if you go further north to canada where stephen harper now has as a conservative
[02:41:58.380 --> 02:42:02.900]  an overall majority as prime minister a rare thing in their electoral system he is shutting
[02:42:02.900 --> 02:42:09.100]  down all this environmental nonsense all these creepy agencies that are going around trying
[02:42:09.100 --> 02:42:14.740]  to close down the the economies of the west while here in australia of course these agencies
[02:42:14.740 --> 02:42:20.740]  are rampant i'm speaking to you at the moment from the summit of mount lofty in australia
[02:42:20.740 --> 02:42:25.340]  just in south australia around the back of adelaide it's the most beautiful country
[02:42:25.340 --> 02:42:30.180]  around here but of course this is the middle of their summer so it's fairly dry and they
[02:42:30.180 --> 02:42:35.860]  all have all the farmers up here i'm staying with one of them they all keep small dams
[02:42:35.860 --> 02:42:40.020]  that they've built to retain a bit of water to make sure that their stock and their crops
[02:42:40.020 --> 02:42:44.220]  can be watered when the rains don't come which they don't come for six months of the year
[02:42:44.220 --> 02:42:50.740]  and sometimes for seven years at a time and what is happening is that in has come the
[02:42:50.740 --> 02:42:55.260]  natural resources management board of south australia one of the most hated bureaucracies
[02:42:55.260 --> 02:43:00.500]  on earth and it's going around interfering with people's right to take water from the
[02:43:00.500 --> 02:43:06.140]  dams that they and their ancestors have built as a result farms are closing at so large
[02:43:06.140 --> 02:43:11.540]  a rate but since the 1970s something like a hundred thousand farmers in australia have
[02:43:11.540 --> 02:43:16.340]  already gone out of business not because they can't make money in farming because they're
[02:43:16.340 --> 02:43:21.660]  pretty good at it out here it's it's the biggest industry in australia no it's because they're
[02:43:21.660 --> 02:43:27.540]  being pestered by so many bureaucrats just down the road from where i'm speaking a few
[02:43:27.540 --> 02:43:33.700]  years ago there was a guy extracting the water from his his dam or in fact it was from a
[02:43:33.700 --> 02:43:39.060]  neighbor's dam but he had permission to do it so that he could water his stock and there
[02:43:39.060 --> 02:43:43.980]  were snoopers this is how they do it snoopers have been hiding for weeks behind a hedge
[02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:50.140]  on a hill nearby watching him through binoculars they didn't realize that he was supplying
[02:43:50.140 --> 02:43:57.340]  this water to his stock and they eventually did a raid at 11 o'clock at night while he
[02:43:57.340 --> 02:44:02.780]  was working on one of the pumps that wasn't functioning they punched on him they drove
[02:44:02.780 --> 02:44:08.700]  their utility vehicle at him which had a rhubarb on the front they hit him with that and he
[02:44:08.700 --> 02:44:15.540]  still has pain from that to this day six years later and then they left him for dead and
[02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:20.780]  the next thing they did realizing they'd done wrong was to go and report that he had done
[02:44:20.780 --> 02:44:26.620]  to them what they had done to him so when he went a week later to the two weeks later
[02:44:26.620 --> 02:44:30.700]  to the police station after he got out of hospital to say that he'd been attacked in
[02:44:30.700 --> 02:44:35.500]  this way he was immediately arrested on the ground quite specious that he had attacked
[02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:40.940]  them that's what's going on here i am now investigating this case and i'm about to do
[02:44:40.940 --> 02:44:46.100]  an amicus curiae brief to the court that eventually convicted him of illegally taking water from
[02:44:46.100 --> 02:44:51.160]  that creek because the conviction was wrong i've already established that he had taken
[02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:55.780]  none of the water they said he'd taken for any purpose other than supplying his stock
[02:44:55.780 --> 02:45:00.460]  which he had written permission from the government to do well what's incredible is they're harassing
[02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:05.580]  everybody i mean i see the australian it's alex because uh... what we're going to do
[02:45:05.580 --> 02:45:09.100]  is it looks to me at the moment and i've got to do a little bit of further investigation
[02:45:09.100 --> 02:45:14.060]  it looks to me at the at the moment as though these three agents of the natural resources
[02:45:14.060 --> 02:45:19.100]  management board committed attempted murder because that's what it is if you drive your
[02:45:19.100 --> 02:45:25.300]  vehicle at somebody you knock them down and you leave them for dead that's attempted murder
[02:45:25.300 --> 02:45:29.800]  so we're not going to be patsies out here anymore i've been talking to farmers all over
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:34.340]  the state they're absolutely boiling furious at what's being done and if you notice now
[02:45:34.340 --> 02:45:39.340]  the government that took the the semi-auto rifles now they want the bolt action in single
[02:45:39.340 --> 02:45:44.220]  shot this is an authoritarian takeover they're handing the entire continent over to the communist
[02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:49.220]  chinese uh... that's on record ninety nine percent of their rare earth minerals of australia
[02:45:49.220 --> 02:45:56.700]  now run by state-run chinese communist operations but i see the newscast mainline tv out of
[02:45:56.700 --> 02:46:01.700]  australia you've been there many times i've never been there where they show sheep farmers
[02:46:01.700 --> 02:46:07.080]  who own the land and they say sorry you can't graze anymore uh... this has to be off use
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:12.940]  for the earth your sheep's flatulence is bad for the atmosphere i mean this is a real hard
[02:46:12.940 --> 02:46:14.020]  core tyranny
[02:46:14.020 --> 02:46:16.400]  uh... if you want to know what it takes
[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:20.260]  there is a notorious case here that of peter spencer who actually went on hunger strike
[02:46:20.260 --> 02:46:24.840]  to draw attention that's right that tied himself to a tower has been farming the land for three
[02:46:24.840 --> 02:46:31.700]  generations and then in order to comply with some useless uh... obligation under the now
[02:46:31.700 --> 02:46:38.340]  expired kyoto protocol the australian government arbitrarily said right we're taking away your
[02:46:38.340 --> 02:46:43.700]  right to farm your land because it's been designated as a carbon sink and of course
[02:46:43.700 --> 02:46:48.020]  they're doing this all over australia they're driving farmers off their own land and of
[02:46:48.020 --> 02:46:53.740]  course the uh... property right in australia is protected by the constitution so what they're
[02:46:53.740 --> 02:46:57.860]  craftily doing is they're just saying we're not taking away your land we're just telling
[02:46:57.860 --> 02:47:02.460]  you can't actually farm it that of course renders the land worthless and therefore in
[02:47:02.460 --> 02:47:06.900]  effect they have taken away your property right but they've managed to dodge and duck
[02:47:06.900 --> 02:47:11.860]  and dive and unfortunately the courts here rather like in the united states are poodles
[02:47:11.860 --> 02:47:16.860]  of the government that pays their lavish salaries and pensions and they will just not find against
[02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:20.620]  the government when the government behaves in this way all right lord logton let me stop
[02:47:20.620 --> 02:47:26.500]  you for the mineral class the three big industries are far mining and fishing all three of these
[02:47:26.500 --> 02:47:32.140]  are now up in arms because the australian government and its various sinister agencies
[02:47:32.140 --> 02:47:37.140]  is attacking and attacking and attacking they're trying to close australia down in the background
[02:47:37.140 --> 02:47:43.060]  to this alex is agenda twenty one this u n program all forty chapters of it which was
[02:47:43.060 --> 02:47:48.380]  first produced in nineteen ninety two but that ridiculous rio earth summit and the idea
[02:47:48.380 --> 02:47:54.620]  of agenda twenty one is to close down the economies of the west by saying that in the
[02:47:54.620 --> 02:47:59.980]  name of the environment we must reduce the population of the earth by nine tenths and
[02:47:59.980 --> 02:48:05.500]  we must do that according to bill gates by vaccination he actually said it in a lecture
[02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:11.060]  i've seen on the internet i i couldn't believe it until i watched it these people are completely
[02:48:11.060 --> 02:48:16.220]  out of control and i've made a speech just last night in one of the farming villages
[02:48:16.220 --> 02:48:20.540]  here and the people in the audience were astonished when i told them this and at first they thought

[02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:37.780]  in houston i don't care where you are if you're in austin you're like two hours away from
[02:54:37.780 --> 02:54:42.060]  katie as half the time getting to houston is the hour end of the city it's so big it's
[02:54:42.060 --> 02:54:47.500]  way out on the edge in the in the you know on the edge of town and looking at this place
[02:54:47.500 --> 02:54:51.160]  it looks like it only caters to cops so they want to convert to that model or only you
[02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:58.360]  know only the government uh has guns and we know and so this is has been a anti-gun gun
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:01.720]  shop and believe me they've got them who are like hey we'll do whatever you want if it's
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:05.460]  pop guns we can sell we'll sell those because they're just going to sell to the cops and
[02:55:05.460 --> 02:55:08.840]  that's that's where he's going to be and that's where he's going now piers morgan is such
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:15.260]  a coward that he may just freak out and go somewhere else for all i know but i'm going
[02:55:15.260 --> 02:55:24.280]  i'm going and um i want to see you there to bullhorn them from across the street uh and
[02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:29.800]  and invite him hey if this was so discrediting my interview with you why would you have me
[02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:35.440]  back on lord monkton what do you think i should say to piers morgan if i see him again i mean
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:40.020]  didn't he get run out of your country well i think what you should say to him is that
[02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:45.640]  he should go back where he came from and not try to interfere in the internal affairs of
[02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:51.120]  the united states i mean yes you know all these lefties are the same in the media they
[02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:55.920]  all think that nobody should be allowed guns that the the police state should be allowed
[02:55:55.920 --> 02:56:01.080]  to push everybody around and well you and i rather disagree with that alex and you know
[02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:08.120]  it has been said by some that you are right on the extreme fringe well hey somebody occasionally
[02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:12.800]  has to stand out a little bit from the crowd to try and warn the crowd of what's about
[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:19.000]  to hit them and there is no doubt now that the governing class worldwide is increasingly
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:26.700]  tying itself together using the excuses such as climate change agenda went 21 environment
[02:56:26.700 --> 02:56:30.880]  using gun control is something we can all unite behind this is the kind of slogan you
[02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:38.200]  hear and so piers morgan is just part if you like of the establishment or the governing
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:45.520]  class or what the french call the class politique who are increasingly remote and cut off from
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:50.400]  ordinary people like z and me who are simply trying to get on and do a job of work and
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:56.000]  not be interfered with by our rulers and of course the whole idea of the united states
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:02.120]  was not to be interfered with by your rulers and unfortunately now even in the united states
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:07.640]  your government is trying to turn itself into a tyranny the environmental protection agency
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:15.240]  just like the south australia bureau of natural resources management is trying to take over
[02:57:15.240 --> 02:57:20.980]  and interfere and effectively to legislate by the back door and to push people around
[02:57:20.980 --> 02:57:26.200]  and you have these little tin pot officials in their shiny shoes and their polished suits
[02:57:26.200 --> 02:57:32.040]  rushing around in government cars you know pestering farmers all over the place and the
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:37.280]  lord monkton foundation which has been established here in australia is going as its first battle
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:43.440]  to take these people on and say if you go around bullying farmers for instance and threatening
[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:49.320]  them that you will drive them off their land and that's one farmer i've talked already
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:55.560]  has been threatened with that if you go around and treat them by saying that their reservoirs
[02:57:55.560 --> 02:58:00.920]  are 10 million liters when they're only five million liters because if they're over 10
[02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:06.400]  million you're allowed to regulate and interfere if you go around cheating like that in future
[02:58:06.400 --> 02:58:11.360]  we will have you for it you will be up in either the civil or more probably the criminal
[02:58:11.360 --> 02:58:15.960]  court all right let me stop you lord mountain put him put him on hold real quick now mike
[02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:19.920]  adams who i really trust says he knows tactical firearms and they're great guys so this is
[02:58:19.920 --> 02:58:25.360]  all moving quick and that they don't support bullet bands so maybe that's not true and
[02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:29.180]  if that's the case i apologize that's not right this is all moving quick i know piers
[02:58:29.180 --> 02:58:33.880]  morgan has been bragging he's going to go to a place that's pro gun control uh so again
[02:58:33.880 --> 02:58:37.800]  tactical firearms may be great guys in fact i was looking at photos of them with guns
[02:58:37.800 --> 02:58:46.280]  on their sides it looks pretty pretty good there thank you for listening to gcn visit

[03:00:27.240 --> 03:00:32.160]  things move quick and i was told and i had to print out some of the news reports that
[03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:37.400]  were misconstrued that the tactical firearms was having piers morgan down because they
[03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:42.240]  agreed with restricting bullets when you buy a bunch getting a background check and that
[03:00:42.240 --> 03:00:47.200]  is not what they believe mike adams says he knows the owner for five years and that those
[03:00:47.200 --> 03:00:52.280]  news reports are incorrect so i apologize the tactical firearms tactical firearms dot
[03:00:52.280 --> 03:00:57.440]  us so that was uh incorrect the point is we know piers morgan uh is anti-gun there are
[03:00:57.440 --> 03:01:01.640]  some gun shops and gun people that are so scared of the atf they are rolling over and
[03:01:01.640 --> 03:01:06.440]  that's who i was talking about there but mike adams is 100 second amendment says they're
[03:01:06.440 --> 03:01:09.600]  great then i'm sure they're great so people should definitely support them in the houston
[03:01:09.600 --> 03:01:16.220]  area uh and i've also confirmed piers morgan piers morgan is like taping between about
[03:01:16.220 --> 03:01:24.840]  three and six so i'm on my way piers soon as the show ends i'm coming i am coming to
[03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:29.120]  to protest you coming here telling me i should give my guns up now if you were coming here
[03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:33.520]  saying you wanted to help me have my freedom i'd say well you know join the club uh but
[03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:36.840]  truly disgusting uh finishing up with lord montan sorry to cut you off there at the end
[03:01:36.840 --> 03:01:40.960]  of the hour but i want to see everybody down there at tactical firearms tonight folks start
[03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:44.340]  getting over there right now the next few hours other points you'd like to make lord
[03:01:44.340 --> 03:01:49.480]  montan about where this attack uh worldwide is going people are starting to wake up to
[03:01:49.480 --> 03:01:55.320]  agenda 21 but is it enough what do we do well i think the first thing is keep a very close
[03:01:55.320 --> 03:02:03.040]  eye on every environmental law that gets passed because you'll find that what agenda 21 does
[03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:09.040]  is that it works chiefly at local level what these agents of the un have done is they've
[03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:15.360]  gone round to local authorities and convinced them one by one that they should implement
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:21.120]  agenda 21 because no national government would go as far as that and there's an outfit called
[03:02:21.120 --> 03:02:28.200]  ichli i c l e i and if your local authority belongs to that organization then boy are
[03:02:28.200 --> 03:02:37.280]  you in trouble these are the new dictators they operate by stealth and their vice-chair
[03:02:37.280 --> 03:02:44.000]  and recently said that in future the individual must subject himself to the collective and
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:49.800]  so this is straightforward outright in your face communism dressed up as though it were
[03:02:49.800 --> 03:02:54.820]  to do with the environment i call them the traffic light tendency the greens too yellow
[03:02:54.820 --> 03:03:00.600]  to admit they're really reds but they're operating bureaucratically through your local authority
[03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:04.720]  and you need to find out and you need to get onto your local authority representatives
[03:03:04.720 --> 03:03:10.800]  your local councillors etcetera and you need to say to them but if they belong to ichli
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:16.000]  you will vote for whichever party says that it will leave that organization and have nothing
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:24.080]  to do with agenda 21 you have to get agenda 21 onto the agenda of local elections and
[03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:30.560]  make it clear that any candidate who supported agenda 21 will not get elected by you and
[03:03:30.560 --> 03:03:37.160]  once they all begin to realize that agenda 21 is hated and feared by the people as it
[03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:42.840]  should be then they will uh break free and just to let you know uh one piece of rather
[03:03:42.840 --> 03:03:49.480]  interesting news a map was produced by ichli of the united states which showed the places
[03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:55.080]  where humans could and could not go more than half the map was covered in red where humans
[03:03:55.080 --> 03:03:59.840]  were allowed to go under no circumstances at all nearly all the remainder was colored
[03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:04.700]  in yellow where you could go with a permit from the socialist state if you were very
[03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:11.200]  lucky and if they agreed to give you one but there were a few tiny areas most of the military
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:17.400]  installations to keep the people in line and only a few effectively concentration camps
[03:04:17.400 --> 03:04:22.800]  where all the population of america would in future have to reside and opponents of
[03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:27.360]  agenda 21 took that map they got hold of it at the last minute they took that map to the
[03:04:27.360 --> 03:04:33.680]  u.s senate and they showed it to senators and their staff hours before the senate was
[03:04:33.680 --> 03:04:38.080]  and it shot it down we're out of time lord monses we're out of time i don't think you
