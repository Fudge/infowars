[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother mainstream mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers you
[00:10.000 --> 00:17.000]  want answers so do people so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and
[00:17.000 --> 00:23.600]  now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones Merry Christmas folks gotta be politically
[00:23.600 --> 00:27.320]  incorrect even such simple things like that are sacrilege under the New World
[00:27.320 --> 00:33.960]  Order Putin's called Trump an absolute leader that'd be good for Russia we've
[00:33.960 --> 00:38.800]  got incredible information with Muslims murdering gays in Europe the Liberals
[00:38.800 --> 00:43.720]  seem to love it it's totally insane we've got so much big news in world
[00:43.720 --> 00:48.760]  events but here's John Bowne on the connection to Obama and ISIS and
[00:48.760 --> 00:55.200]  al-Qaeda as the curtain comes down filed under what's old is new again are the
[00:55.200 --> 00:59.440]  alarming steps Michael springman a high-level State Department official
[00:59.440 --> 01:04.160]  took to inform the federal government that unqualified foreign applicants were
[01:04.160 --> 01:09.840]  being issued visas prior to 9-11 in Saudi Arabia I was repeatedly ordered by
[01:09.840 --> 01:15.080]  high-level State Department officials to issue visas to unqualified applicants
[01:15.080 --> 01:20.400]  springman told the BBC prior to the 9-11 attack these were essentially people
[01:20.400 --> 01:25.520]  who had no ties either to Saudi Arabia or to their own country I complained
[01:25.520 --> 01:29.160]  bitterly at the time there I returned to the US I complained to the State
[01:29.160 --> 01:32.120]  Department here to the General Accounting Office to the Bureau of
[01:32.120 --> 01:36.400]  Diplomatic Security and to the Inspector General's office I was met with
[01:36.400 --> 01:44.800]  silence every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are
[01:44.800 --> 01:51.320]  with us or you are with the terrorists fast-forward approximately 15 years
[01:51.320 --> 01:57.080]  later and Obama sounds like a broken record being played in an empty hall
[01:57.080 --> 02:01.080]  meanwhile here at home the Department of Homeland Security is updating its
[02:01.080 --> 02:07.160]  alert system to help the American people stay vigilant and safe and as always our
[02:07.160 --> 02:10.600]  extraordinary men and women in uniform continue to put their lives on the line
[02:10.600 --> 02:15.280]  in this campaign meanwhile the mirror UK reports hackers have claimed that a
[02:15.280 --> 02:19.280]  number of Islamic State supporters social media accounts are being run from
[02:19.280 --> 02:23.440]  internet addresses linked to the Department of Work and Pensions the
[02:23.440 --> 02:27.760]  hacking collective showed mirror online details of the IP addresses used by a
[02:27.760 --> 02:32.720]  trio of separate digital jihadis to access Twitter accounts which were then
[02:32.720 --> 02:38.040]  used to carry out online recruitment and propaganda campaigns at first glance the
[02:38.040 --> 02:42.960]  IP addresses seem to be based in Saudi Arabia but upon further inspection using
[02:42.960 --> 02:47.520]  specialist tools they appeared to link back to the Department of Work and
[02:47.520 --> 02:51.640]  Pensions the British government has admitted selling large numbers of
[02:51.640 --> 02:55.760]  internet addresses to Saudi Arabia but has refused to reveal how much it has
[02:55.760 --> 02:59.880]  earned from the transaction although the government announced plans to auction
[02:59.880 --> 03:04.400]  its surplus IP numbers it can now be revealed that a chunk of them went to
[03:04.400 --> 03:09.440]  Saudi telecom and the Saudi based mobile telecommunications company of course
[03:09.440 --> 03:14.200]  the inept record-breaking tax sucking behamoth known as the US federal
[03:14.200 --> 03:17.600]  government with all of its trillion spent on surveilling the average
[03:17.600 --> 03:22.240]  Americans phone calls emails and browser history and storing it all in a huge
[03:22.240 --> 03:27.520]  database guarded by psychotic thugs can't be bothered with monitoring the
[03:27.520 --> 03:31.960]  social media of potential terrorists entering the United States the Hill
[03:31.960 --> 03:37.280]  reports Homeland Security Secretary Jay Johnson decided against ending a secret
[03:37.280 --> 03:42.640]  US policy that prohibits immigration officials from reviewing social media
[03:42.640 --> 03:48.480]  posts of foreigners applying for US visas a DHS spokesman told ABC News that in
[03:48.480 --> 03:53.720]  the fall of 2014 the department began three pilot programs to include social
[03:53.720 --> 03:58.000]  media in vetting but officials say it's still not a widespread policy and
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.400]  review is underway to the massacre that occurred in San Bernardino have been
[04:02.400 --> 04:06.800]  prevented had the feds actually done what most Americans thought they'd been

[04:17.880 --> 04:22.480]  separate realities the arrogant compulsive fabrication the criminals in
[04:22.480 --> 04:27.280]  Washington DC are still hawking and another reality that for most Americans
[04:27.280 --> 04:31.840]  is a big pill to swallow the growing evidence that layers of a trillion
[04:31.840 --> 04:36.240]  dollar shadow government's nefarious inner workings are exponentially coming
[04:36.240 --> 04:40.680]  to light for many Americans admitting that your president is a traitor based
[04:40.680 --> 04:45.080]  upon all of the evidence is difficult to look squarely in the eye you know
[04:45.080 --> 04:50.680]  George W. Bush after he stage 9-11 with his daddy he said you're either with us
[04:50.680 --> 04:54.080]  or with those elk out of terrorists they hired on record
[04:54.080 --> 04:58.640]  well I got news for the new world order you're either with humanity or you're

[08:38.600 --> 08:42.840]  this Thursday transmission is broadcasting across the United States and
[08:42.840 --> 08:47.160]  around the world Lord Monkton on the aftermath of the world government
[08:47.160 --> 08:53.200]  treaty that they failed to ram through not completely but for the most part will
[08:53.200 --> 08:57.760]  be popping in for 30 minutes at the start of the next hour then Paul Joseph
[08:57.760 --> 09:02.400]  Watson is going to be coming on the broadcast to get into this story that's
[09:02.400 --> 09:08.800]  an info wars.com and prisonplanet.com that's illustrative of exactly who
[09:08.800 --> 09:14.440]  these Qatari Saudi Arabian and other invaders are in Syria that are now being
[09:14.440 --> 09:19.040]  called refugees and the federal government just released numbers that
[09:19.040 --> 09:25.600]  they've actually brought in 100,000 quote Syrian refugees oh you thought it
[09:25.600 --> 09:31.480]  was 10,000 there is a formula folks they said in Germany three years ago they
[09:31.480 --> 09:37.400]  were gonna bring in 100,000 it's now 3 million in Germany alone 1 million this
[09:37.400 --> 09:44.640]  year when they say 10,000 it's 100,000 when they say 100,000 it's 300,000 when
[09:44.640 --> 09:49.480]  they see 300,000 it's a million when they say a million it's 3 million when
[09:49.480 --> 09:54.080]  they say it's 20 million illegals here they now admit it's 40 million it's a
[09:54.080 --> 10:01.120]  formula you watch it long enough you become like the coach of the New
[10:01.120 --> 10:04.120]  England Patriots you don't even need to steal the playbooks you already have a
[10:04.120 --> 10:10.840]  memorized from watching the games well I'm not an NFL coach folks but I am
[10:10.840 --> 10:14.560]  pretty much the best analyst when it comes down to really studying the
[10:14.560 --> 10:20.520]  globalist and how they operate because I am obsessed with it I live it and I know
[10:20.520 --> 10:25.120]  their playbook up one side and down the other you can mix and match their
[10:25.120 --> 10:30.120]  minions and replace them and rearrange them like deck chairs on the Titanic or
[10:30.120 --> 10:35.600]  the Lusitania but at the end of the day they follow a criminology a modus
[10:35.600 --> 10:42.800]  operandi it's how better police detectives can catch a serial killer six
[10:42.800 --> 10:46.480]  months out from him doing it and six months later figure out where they're
[10:46.480 --> 10:51.000]  gonna strike next by immersing themselves in the mind of the enemy well
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.200]  my task is a lot simpler than that because the globalists are very very
[10:55.200 --> 11:02.600]  transparent Sweden this is the story up on drudgereport.com Sweden Muslim
[11:02.600 --> 11:08.880]  migrants batter gay man to death wrap snake around his neck now we've seen
[11:08.880 --> 11:12.000]  some famous cases of gay men being beaten to death for no reason in the
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.440]  United States and they get attention and they should it's wrong it's stupid
[11:16.440 --> 11:20.280]  it people who aren't normally criminals though we'll go kill somebody for what
[11:20.280 --> 11:24.240]  race they are other sexual preference because then it feels like it's okay
[11:24.240 --> 11:30.360]  that they're doing it and now it's okay to beat up and kill white people in this
[11:30.360 --> 11:34.560]  country because oh you know they're all racist they deserve it and the media
[11:34.560 --> 11:39.600]  tries to cover that up and then when I criticize black racism I get emails and
[11:39.600 --> 11:43.040]  see comments going man I used to like your show why are you racist against
[11:43.040 --> 11:48.080]  black people now well you see I exposed Tuskegee which was already known before
[11:48.080 --> 11:52.840]  I was born but I exposed all the other things that aren't known and the plan to
[11:52.840 --> 11:57.240]  exterminate black people because I'm not racist and innocent black people don't
[11:57.240 --> 12:03.360]  deserve to be chopped up in the womb or be given sentences that aren't fair but
[12:03.360 --> 12:08.640]  that doesn't mean that I support hordes of black racist either see it's a
[12:08.640 --> 12:14.040]  complex thought process it's not like either I'm for black lives matter or I'm
[12:14.040 --> 12:19.520]  against it I'm against George Soros running it
[12:19.520 --> 12:26.160]  but the radical Muslims which are the majority in many countries in the
[12:26.160 --> 12:30.040]  Middle East now and other areas murder people I mean I have a stack of news
[12:30.040 --> 12:35.880]  here where if someone attends a protest in Saudi Arabia they chop their head off
[12:35.880 --> 12:41.760]  that's in the news today not a word out of the liberals not a word out of the
[12:41.760 --> 12:48.320]  feminist they just tell me all day that if I don't basically let my woman boss me
[12:48.320 --> 12:53.640]  around I'm anti feminine hey you try letting a woman boss you around and run
[12:53.640 --> 12:58.600]  your life they'll leave you so fast it'll make your head spin but see I'm a
[12:58.600 --> 13:07.680]  man I'm out conquering my domain I'm out producing and building so I don't need
[13:07.680 --> 13:14.040]  to sit there and curry favor with women because women are looking for men not
[13:14.040 --> 13:21.840]  little boys who are interested development women are not my problem men who
[13:21.840 --> 13:25.560]  aren't men have a problem and then they listen to popular media about how
[13:25.560 --> 13:31.520]  they're supposed to get a good woman that's how you get to be alone or die
[13:31.520 --> 13:37.240]  alone everything the system pushes is to screw you up and arrest your
[13:37.240 --> 13:43.520]  development Sweden Muslim migrants batter gay man to death I saw another one
[13:43.520 --> 13:46.960]  of these last week when they stabbed one to death in London they usually cover
[13:46.960 --> 13:50.960]  them up so for everyone you see you bet there's about a hundred victim taunted
[13:50.960 --> 13:56.040]  over his sexual orientation during brutal murder two Muslim migrants in
[13:56.040 --> 14:00.320]  Sweden have been charged that's their happy hunting ground now they rape
[14:00.320 --> 14:02.800]  Swedish women it's they don't get charged it's just you don't kill a
[14:02.800 --> 14:05.800]  protective group I'm not against gay people it's just you know women are
[14:05.800 --> 14:10.360]  just as important as a gay man I'm sorry it's just true that more sacrilege two
[14:10.360 --> 14:15.000]  Muslim migrants in Sweden have been charged with the hate crime murder of
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.360]  a gay man after they allegedly battered the victim to death before dressing him
[14:20.360 --> 14:25.880]  up in women's clothing and wrapping a snake around his neck another reason
[14:25.880 --> 14:29.400]  predators target gay men is they target the more feminine gay men that they can
[14:29.400 --> 14:33.520]  pick out and obviously see won't fight for themselves there's a lot of gay men
[14:33.520 --> 14:36.600]  out there will rip their arms out of their sockets but again you can't just
[14:36.600 --> 14:40.800]  tell they are the two alleged perpetrators and again they're just
[14:40.800 --> 14:45.360]  predators the two alleged perpetrators are 16 year old and 19 year old
[14:45.360 --> 14:50.120]  refugees from Morocco according to prosecutors the victim was deliberately
[14:50.120 --> 14:55.640]  targeted because of his sexuality Morocco is 99.9% Muslim and being gay
[14:55.640 --> 14:59.800]  lesbian or transgender is illegal with punishments up to three years in prison
[14:59.800 --> 15:02.760]  that's a very lax compared to most Muslim countries where it's punishable by
[15:02.760 --> 15:09.160]  death it wasn't illegal in Iraq so they blew the country up and women were 60
[15:09.160 --> 15:12.320]  percent of college graduates didn't have to wear a cover their faces and you
[15:12.320 --> 15:15.960]  can listen to rock and roll music so they they blew it up any country like
[15:15.960 --> 15:20.120]  that they blow up our government does and then everybody buys liquor and
[15:20.120 --> 15:24.560]  pizza and sits around home get them all shock at all cruise missiles blow that
[15:24.560 --> 15:29.160]  country up now it's all a failed state Al Qaeda is taking over they're running
[15:29.160 --> 15:33.840]  rampant our government's giving them missiles the incident began when the
[15:33.840 --> 15:37.720]  gay man met the 16-year-old refugee in a park in Gothenburg and offered to help
[15:37.720 --> 15:41.320]  him by giving clothes and food the three individuals ended up back at the gay
[15:41.320 --> 15:44.520]  man's apartment where the accused claims the man tried to have sex with the two
[15:44.520 --> 15:49.280]  migrants and they acted in self-defense oh our police recovered a video for the
[15:49.280 --> 15:53.720]  16-year-old cell phone which shows the gay men battered and bound the floor of
[15:53.720 --> 15:57.760]  the apartment the 16 year old is heard screaming and cursing at the men while
[15:57.760 --> 16:04.760]  insulting him over his sexual orientation the alleged perpetrators plan the
[16:04.760 --> 16:08.200]  victim was already dressed in a woman when they met him although the victim's
[16:08.200 --> 16:11.880]  boyfriend denies well who cares what he's dressing address or not that his
[16:11.880 --> 16:15.120]  partner was cross dresser and asserts that the victim was dressed in women's
[16:15.120 --> 16:18.920]  clothes to mock him the dead snake was found wrapped around the victim's neck
[16:18.920 --> 16:23.880]  of which police found drops of 16 year old's blood and it just goes on from
[16:23.880 --> 16:32.760]  there you will not hear about this on MSNBC with Rachel Maddow and and that's

[25:19.960 --> 25:26.400]  eloquently illustrates what I've been trying to say in my own broken way that
[25:26.400 --> 25:32.320]  we're on the edge of world war economic collapse social problems the Pentagon
[25:32.320 --> 25:35.440]  admits the world's the most dangerous it's ever been Obama says he's made the
[25:35.440 --> 25:40.800]  world safer than ever I mean we're in crazy town and the article goes why is
[25:40.800 --> 25:45.160]  the New York Times number one story it runs up to 10 stories a day about
[25:45.160 --> 25:50.880]  transgender well that's just what you'd expect in a science fiction comedy book
[25:50.880 --> 25:56.480]  novel by Kurt Vonnegut we're on the edge of world war four folks robot
[25:56.480 --> 26:00.880]  computers are taking over militaries admit they're going to combat robots the
[26:00.880 --> 26:08.960]  next five years he the elite admit the future doesn't need humans and Gerald
[26:08.960 --> 26:15.800]  Solente writes an article about New York Times off-trend with transgender blitz
[26:16.280 --> 26:22.040]  this is what happens when Nero fiddled while Rome burned and they go why don't
[26:22.040 --> 26:27.320]  you like transgenders I don't care if you're gonna have one as a celebrity at
[26:27.320 --> 26:33.320]  least have it look like a good-looking woman not an old guy in a wig I mean
[26:33.320 --> 26:39.760]  just leave me alone stop trying to tell me how to think stop thinking you run my
[26:39.760 --> 26:46.200]  life it's disgusting you think about an elite obsessed with stuff like this and
[26:46.200 --> 26:57.520]  then meanwhile Russia hasn't done anything to the United States Russia is in
[26:57.520 --> 27:04.600]  collapse mode Russia had a deal with the US in the early 1990s and NATO to not
[27:04.600 --> 27:09.120]  expand into any of its former satellites if the United States and NATO didn't and
[27:09.120 --> 27:14.000]  now for about six seven years under Obama we're in place some clips coming up
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.560]  the next segment of Putin and they've encircled them and come in and have been
[27:18.560 --> 27:24.640]  overthrowing the countries and taking them over and moving weapons in and then
[27:24.640 --> 27:28.120]  Russian ethnic areas on the borders of Russia that have been there for hundreds
[27:28.120 --> 27:32.560]  of years like Crimea they're blowing up all the major power lines and power
[27:32.560 --> 27:40.360]  stations and and and and having radical Islamic groups bomb Russian planes out
[27:40.360 --> 27:47.320]  of the sky and Turkey shooting down Russian aircraft and Putin says they've
[27:47.320 --> 27:51.280]  got missiles in place now Turkey keeps flying aircraft in every day Putin just
[27:51.280 --> 27:56.120]  came out and said okay we're gonna start shooting them down next week and that
[27:56.120 --> 27:59.920]  means when they fly over Syria to go to it into Iraq the Iraqi government says
[27:59.920 --> 28:04.080]  get out of here we don't want you here they're there bombing the Kurds that are
[28:04.080 --> 28:12.880]  fighting ISIS on record you see they've got supply lines through Western Iraq
[28:12.880 --> 28:21.400]  into Syria up into southern Turkey and the Russians are bombing those
[28:21.400 --> 28:28.520]  supply lines the minute they come into Syria and the Kurds are attacking on
[28:28.520 --> 28:33.360]  the other side trying to stop ISIS so what's Turkey doing they've sent ground
[28:33.360 --> 28:40.120]  troops in and traveled over a hundred miles through the mountains and desert
[28:40.120 --> 28:45.320]  and are now fighting the Kurds in a pincer attack flanking the Russians
[28:45.320 --> 28:50.120]  they're attacking from the north in Turkey southern Turkey and from the
[28:50.120 --> 28:57.760]  southeast into the west of Iraq in a full-on toe-to-toe with the Russians and
[28:57.760 --> 29:02.440]  they're threatening to blow up Russian ships coming out of the Black Sea and
[29:02.440 --> 29:08.880]  in the Mediterranean and any day now giant war could break out but the average
[29:08.880 --> 29:14.800]  American is being forced fed the Kardashians and that woman that looks
[29:14.800 --> 29:21.800]  like the penguin and some snapping turtle with a wig on while hordes of
[29:21.800 --> 29:29.760]  jihadists pour into Europe and rape and murder they come back Putin says he
[29:29.760 --> 29:34.760]  likes Trump the two are friends of hung out quite a bit Trump says he wants to
[29:34.760 --> 29:39.760]  have a deep relationship with Russia and engage in trade another big plus for

[34:39.560 --> 34:47.040]  we burn with life and are awake as our ancestors were not the zombified hordes
[34:47.040 --> 34:58.680]  of slaves to serve the fraud that is the technocratic world government close
[34:58.680 --> 35:00.960]  your eyes
[35:03.960 --> 35:10.560]  and go insane like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton no I don't choose that
[35:10.560 --> 35:17.320]  I won't turn my will over to you ever no I'm not gonna close my eyes I'm not
[35:17.320 --> 35:25.080]  gonna go insane Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central time I'm
[35:25.080 --> 35:28.240]  here hosting them the fourth hour is hosted by one of our great anchors or
[35:28.240 --> 35:32.160]  investigative journalist and today in four hours nightly news director Rob do
[35:32.160 --> 35:38.000]  is going to be hosting and we're going to premiere a deep analysis of the bushes
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.720]  and their Nazi connection right through to Jeb Bush currently with breaking
[35:41.720 --> 35:46.840]  intel just to show you their mindset and who they really are I'm not saying it's
[35:46.840 --> 35:53.160]  a Nazi conspiracy now I'm saying the word is and the evidence is the bushes
[35:53.160 --> 36:00.400]  got a big chunk of the Nazi horde at the end of World War two that's coming up
[36:00.400 --> 36:06.520]  in the middle of the fourth hour today also I've already got some of the sneak
[36:06.520 --> 36:09.760]  peeks and I've talked to some people that won't tell me everything about it
[36:09.760 --> 36:16.760]  but have but have seen pieces of it out in LA because what happens is you get
[36:16.760 --> 36:21.840]  early copies before stuff comes out but it's got text all over it if you're in
[36:21.840 --> 36:26.280]  the hot a level screen actors you'll get to vote in the Academy Awards so some
[36:26.280 --> 36:31.400]  of this stuff's leaked and I haven't been told much I went out and looked at
[36:31.400 --> 36:36.720]  leaks online and can tell which ones are what I was told and see that's kind of
[36:36.720 --> 36:40.520]  how this works I don't want to know what's in something before it's released
[36:40.520 --> 36:44.640]  because there's even legal issues with that I just get little pieces to then
[36:44.640 --> 36:48.640]  know looking at other leaks whether those were accurate leaks or not that's a
[36:48.640 --> 36:54.120]  way to reverse engineer it and so we got a pretty good idea what's in the film and
[36:54.120 --> 37:01.480]  I got to say the plot is better than I thought it would be and so now I'm not
[37:01.480 --> 37:06.520]  so negative on it I mean and people say why do you care about Star Wars with all
[37:06.520 --> 37:09.360]  this big news happening worldwide aren't you kind of violating what you said
[37:09.360 --> 37:13.800]  yourself we should be focusing on issues upwards of 80% of the info war is in
[37:13.800 --> 37:17.640]  entertainment that's where the messengers are planted that's where a lot of the
[37:17.640 --> 37:23.080]  bad stuff happens a lot of the good stuff happens as you know and I mean the
[37:23.080 --> 37:26.320]  guy they had play Anakin Skywalker looked like he was from Nickelodeon or
[37:26.320 --> 37:30.680]  something he's a white guy whatever his name is I mean he's just not a good
[37:30.680 --> 37:36.360]  actor I'm sorry I'm sure he's a nice guy he just doesn't come off as believable I
[37:37.800 --> 37:41.720]  mean I guess he's handsome you can say he doesn't look very manly I mean Darth
[37:41.720 --> 37:47.360]  Vader needs to look manly folks I'm sorry and then they got this new actor
[37:47.360 --> 37:52.040]  there's this young black guy he doesn't look manly he doesn't pull off a storm
[37:52.040 --> 38:02.600]  trooper you know the the black actor that plays a mace window pulls it off you
[38:02.600 --> 38:10.680]  believe he could defeat the Emperor you don't believe that the other characters
[38:10.680 --> 38:16.640]  are believable it's just bad casting it just is and and like both the bad guy
[38:16.640 --> 38:21.760]  and the good person they're both women you know I don't care if women are the
[38:21.760 --> 38:27.800]  heroes in movies but then the directive to make all the heroes women and China
[38:27.800 --> 38:32.000]  runs the US space program because we're not smart enough in the Martian it's just
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.080]  the propaganda
[38:39.600 --> 38:46.320]  so so so Samuel L. Jackson is a great actor and has real gravitas this new guy
[38:46.320 --> 38:54.880]  what's putting back on screen John Boyega I mean he's just he just looks
[38:54.880 --> 38:58.560]  like somebody couldn't find his way out of a wet paper bag and then and then the
[38:58.560 --> 39:03.360]  clips they show of him in the movie he looks like he's got a 75 IQ or something
[39:03.360 --> 39:09.400]  I mean I would cast this guy to play the part I'm not being mean of maybe
[39:09.400 --> 39:13.880]  somebody that's had a lobotomy I mean that's what he radiates is that he's
[39:13.880 --> 39:22.040]  stupid but see that's the image they sell now and so I just expect it to be
[39:22.360 --> 39:26.800]  hard to watch now I got some friends that are going tonight we'll have reviews
[39:26.800 --> 39:31.040]  for you tomorrow to Kari Jackson and Kit Daniels are gonna go see it tomorrow
[39:31.040 --> 39:34.080]  they're gonna have a review I'll have been studio with me Sunday to talk about
[39:34.080 --> 39:39.600]  it I'll just be honest with you I'm not going to see it for a while I just got
[39:39.600 --> 39:44.240]  more serious things to do I will hijack it before it comes out today with a
[39:44.240 --> 39:48.120]  special report with a sneak peek and basically leaked the plot without even
[39:48.120 --> 39:52.720]  watching it and that's what I do I mean I don't watch myself on Discovery
[39:52.720 --> 39:56.840]  Channel History Channel or true TV or any of the shows I'm on either not
[39:56.840 --> 40:00.160]  bragging I just I just don't want to look at myself I want to move on to the
[40:00.160 --> 40:04.960]  next objective I'm in a war the only reason I'm talking about Star Wars episode
[40:04.960 --> 40:09.880]  seven is because it is an allegory to what's happened in our world and episode
[40:09.880 --> 40:16.160]  three was excellent the prequel and basically if you understand that movie
[40:16.160 --> 40:19.880]  understand everything works false flags how wars used there's an article in
[40:19.880 --> 40:23.680]  full Wars calm the day about it the plot of Star Wars frighteningly resembles
[40:23.680 --> 40:30.400]  modern-day America well that's what George Lucas to his credit said when it
[40:30.400 --> 40:34.120]  came out episode three what six seven eight years ago I don't remember now he
[40:34.120 --> 40:39.400]  said no I rewrote episode three to parallel what 9-11 really was and that's
[40:39.400 --> 40:43.720]  him telling you I'm a 9-11 truther so I have to respect George Lucas even though
[40:43.720 --> 40:48.640]  he committed the abomination of Jar Jar Binks and even though I'm told he's not
[40:48.640 --> 40:55.600]  pro-gun he does get what 9-11 was and he did rewrite the plot
[40:55.600 --> 41:05.000]  so it is very informative and Abrams the director is a very good director I'm
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.040]  not really a Star Trek fan and I've seen the last few Star Trek's they're
[41:08.040 --> 41:14.160]  really good they they have false flag plots and see why are all these Captain
[41:14.160 --> 41:17.120]  America movies and all this basically people watching them go it's like Alex
[41:17.120 --> 41:20.880]  Jones wrote this and I later learned the folks that did write some of the Captain
[41:20.880 --> 41:25.280]  America are familiar with the show and we did influence it I put some feelers
[41:25.280 --> 41:30.440]  out and that's not bragging it's showing how us engaging entertainment and doing
[41:30.440 --> 41:37.040]  analysis of it is is very very popular I've had quite a few folks from the
[41:37.040 --> 41:40.400]  movie Pro Prometheus
[41:41.920 --> 41:46.320]  well one I'm directly reached out others to the grapevine and said wow we
[41:46.320 --> 41:50.400]  really like your analysis of it even before I saw it I mean I just had the
[41:50.400 --> 41:55.560]  the the the leaks and they said that's exactly what the inside baseball is is
[41:55.560 --> 42:00.400]  this is a real creation narrative of the elite and it's what the elite really
[42:00.400 --> 42:03.920]  think happened on earth so that's why the next one I think it's called
[42:03.920 --> 42:10.000]  Genesis is coming out and you're you're being told exactly what the elite
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.960]  actually believed was going on and see that's my job is to tell you what they're
[42:13.960 --> 42:17.960]  really thinking what they're really doing and so naturally that's who's gonna
[42:17.960 --> 42:22.320]  watch and listen to this show because folks you are getting the inside
[42:22.320 --> 42:28.080]  baseball and that's no brag that's just fact I want everyone to get what's
[42:28.080 --> 42:32.360]  going on I want everyone to understand what's going on I want to take the
[42:32.360 --> 42:36.560]  Promethean fire that the elites have and are hoarding for themselves given to us
[42:36.560 --> 42:41.440]  by God they're keeping it in the priest class to try to become gods
[42:41.440 --> 42:47.960]  themselves while keeping the technology from us and whether it was galactic
[42:47.960 --> 43:05.000]  seeding or pan-transpermia whatever the cosmology is the Bible is dead on and
[43:05.000 --> 43:10.800]  we're not in Kansas we never were we are on a planetoid in deep space with a
[43:10.800 --> 43:14.880]  fantastical universe around us and the globalists don't ever want us to tune
[43:14.880 --> 43:20.760]  into that they want us to be obsessed in a false protomatrix like Times Square
[43:20.760 --> 43:26.520]  where they feed us all the images and seduce us into their world that is a
[43:26.520 --> 43:34.200]  limited paradigm where they can pretend to be God over us but are not gods a
[43:34.200 --> 43:42.640]  real God would give us free will a real God would empower us a real God would
[43:42.640 --> 43:47.680]  create creatures that can develop ideas and sciences in their minds and then
[43:47.680 --> 43:54.480]  over time by working manifest it physically this species is so
[43:54.480 --> 43:59.480]  incredibly powerful look where we've come from and where we are now and only at
[43:59.480 --> 44:03.320]  this point with the massive technology and the developments and everything we've
[44:03.320 --> 44:07.720]  got and and the medical developments they're curing blindness they're curing
[44:07.720 --> 44:12.400]  deafness they're curing everything right now they don't want the general public
[44:12.400 --> 44:16.360]  to get that but many of the elites do there's a battle over the future right
[44:16.360 --> 44:22.520]  now there's a fantastical war happening thousands of times more
[44:22.520 --> 44:30.400]  intricate and colorful than the fantasy land of Star Wars that's all I'm saying
[44:30.400 --> 44:35.280]  the globalists have divided Europe against the United States and against
[44:35.280 --> 44:39.640]  Russia the globalist plate nations and people's off against each other they
[44:39.640 --> 44:45.320]  manipulate our weaknesses we should have from the beginning but natural allies
[44:45.320 --> 44:50.600]  like we were until World War two and and before that the communists take over in
[44:50.600 --> 44:56.280]  1917 with Russia we should already have giant joint programs with Russia we
[44:56.280 --> 45:00.880]  would already be on Mars we should be working with China we should be building
[45:00.880 --> 45:03.960]  up Africa and Latin America and globalists claim that world governments
[45:03.960 --> 45:07.200]  about that but instead it's about suppressing all the countries and playing
[45:07.200 --> 45:11.000]  us off against each other and putting suppressive global carbon taxes
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.000]  controlled by the Anglo-American establishment against the entire world
[45:15.000 --> 45:20.960]  militarily to shut us down while the elites hoard our resources our
[45:20.960 --> 45:28.040]  inventions our developments in secretive offshore armored redoubts and
[45:28.040 --> 45:34.760]  university and governmental and corporate reservations campuses underground
[45:34.760 --> 45:42.720]  facilities where they live and we sleep where they transcend we fall where they
[45:42.720 --> 45:48.360]  live we die but what's scary is the evil ones will never transcend with this
[45:48.360 --> 45:54.280]  technology because they're already falling to first go to the next level in
[45:54.280 --> 45:59.280]  God's plan we have to believe in other people and truly want to build others up
[45:59.280 --> 46:05.720]  and also be focused and strong to identify who the enemy is and not be
[46:05.720 --> 46:13.760]  chomped by them the enemy is failing we are in a death battle with them in the
[46:13.760 --> 46:18.520]  10th round we're entering right now of 12 rounds ladies and gentlemen we have
[46:18.520 --> 46:24.320]  taken the initiative the enemy is rising to its feet bloodied we're bloody as
[46:24.320 --> 46:30.280]  well and they are screaming with jealousy and envy and hatred that they
[46:30.280 --> 46:35.440]  won't control the destiny of humanity and that we're about to break free wings
[46:35.440 --> 46:42.640]  out into the stars they've got hooks and bounds and ties and nooses like
[46:42.640 --> 46:46.720]  lila Polly's trying to hold down the human spirit in God's plan and we're
[46:46.720 --> 46:51.560]  tearing free but as soon as we tear free thousands of other hooks shoot up and
[46:51.560 --> 46:55.800]  tear into our flesh but the moment we know the lila Polly's are there because
[46:55.800 --> 47:02.200]  only a fraction of us know our strength will intensify a trillion fold and those
[47:02.200 --> 47:06.880]  hooks and those barbs and all those spears in this will form into a structure
[47:06.880 --> 47:15.160]  that takes us to the next level and they howl with hatred because the evil ones
[47:15.160 --> 47:20.240]  know how beautiful we are and they can see us we can't see ourselves and they
[47:20.240 --> 47:24.720]  are just gouging their eyes out wanting to kill our innocence wanting to poison
[47:24.720 --> 47:29.200]  our food wanting to disease our planet wanting to pull it down this this egg
[47:29.200 --> 47:37.440]  this yolk that is ours to use and be born they want to abort this species here
[47:37.440 --> 47:42.040]  on terra firma the battle will be decided for the future of our species an
[47:42.040 --> 47:50.680]  epic war that you're now part of that's why the enemy always says I'm not for
[47:50.680 --> 47:54.160]  real that's why they try to demonize me and claim I'm bad because they know I'm
[47:54.160 --> 48:02.360]  good they know I'm shadowed up in battle they know I'm hacking at the enemy they
[48:02.360 --> 48:06.640]  know I'm committed and they know the fire I carry in my heart is a fire of old
[48:06.640 --> 48:15.960]  that will spread and will burn them to the ground they fear us they know us they
[48:15.960 --> 48:23.040]  are the enemies of old now you need to decide which side you're on right now
[48:23.040 --> 48:29.640]  will the age of chivalry return will the Renaissance return will humanity go to
[48:29.640 --> 48:36.840]  the next level or will we fall God is a God of free will and destiny you must
[48:36.840 --> 48:42.280]  take free will in your destiny in your hands the choice is up to you Putin has
[48:42.280 --> 48:48.520]  called Trump an outstanding and talented man I'm a skip this network break AFP

[49:13.600 --> 49:20.800]  not bionic eyes not life extension we should be focused on our iPhones made
[49:20.800 --> 49:24.840]  in slave factories and worship them we should talk about how ugly humans are
[49:24.840 --> 49:30.160]  and how bad we are for the earth of course in our crib we're gonna crap our
[49:30.160 --> 49:33.840]  diapers of course at this level we're not perfect but look how much we've
[49:33.840 --> 49:37.920]  already cleaned up it's the globalist is easing the planet it's the globalist
[49:37.920 --> 49:43.080]  mutating the species it's the globalist attacking every family of life forms and
[49:43.080 --> 49:48.560]  genetically engineering it to not bear fruit engineering the death virus into
[49:48.560 --> 49:53.720]  the planet testing the murder of the planet in front of us and then standing
[49:53.720 --> 49:58.200]  up there Al Gore heavily invested in all these companies lecturing us how he's
[49:58.200 --> 50:06.120]  here to save the world when he is a giant black devil leering down to suck
[50:06.120 --> 50:13.600]  blood out of the planet itself the ultimate festering soft stinking

[50:28.920 --> 50:33.240]  the god of this world it's no god at all
[50:33.240 --> 50:45.040]  skip this break thank you Putin calls Trump an outstanding talented man I'm
[50:45.040 --> 50:49.760]  gonna let Daria who speaks fluent Russian actually give you the
[50:49.760 --> 50:57.400]  translation as best she can here that's cuz he's talking somewhat quick and then
[50:57.400 --> 51:00.600]  I'll actually go over it what he says about Donald Trump but the best part is
[51:00.600 --> 51:03.640]  he talks about Trump wants a deep relationship with Russia wants trade
[51:03.640 --> 51:07.280]  wants to work with us doesn't want to be enemies how could we not be for him
[51:07.280 --> 51:10.520]  but we don't want to get involved in the American elections obviously because
[51:10.520 --> 51:15.760]  they'll use that and say we're interfering Trump is going against the
[51:15.760 --> 51:18.960]  military industrial complex he's going against the brokerage firms saying you
[51:18.960 --> 51:24.520]  shouldn't be tax exempt and poor people aren't Trump has said some things that I
[51:24.520 --> 51:27.760]  don't agree with on the internet and I'm going after families but then he's
[51:27.760 --> 51:32.000]  backtracked on that that's the thing it's not flip-flop he goes okay I see
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.040]  what you're saying yeah this is better
[51:38.520 --> 51:42.080]  what do you think it says when Trump comes on this show you think he's
[51:42.080 --> 51:46.960]  stupid he wants everybody to know he knows the foreign leaders listen to this
[51:46.960 --> 51:52.520]  show he knows Putin listens to the show by the way that's a fact for years I was
[51:52.520 --> 51:58.000]  told that by RT like nine years ago when they were first coming to the US then I
[51:58.000 --> 52:05.200]  was told that by the head of RT then one time they told me I was gonna be on
[52:05.200 --> 52:10.040]  national Russian TV and I wasn't on national Russian TV the Skype paradigm
[52:10.040 --> 52:18.160]  and I was in a room I was in a room here but in a room there in Russia and I'm
[52:18.160 --> 52:22.080]  just gonna leave it at that just like when Matt Drudge was here in studio I was
[52:22.080 --> 52:26.320]  like well he's not gonna come on air while people even believe it and the
[52:26.320 --> 52:30.720]  whole point is things are more fantastic than you know the world's a lot
[52:30.720 --> 52:34.640]  stranger than people understand until you wake up and really look around open
[52:34.640 --> 52:39.120]  your eyes and some big decisions are being made right now about the future of
[52:39.120 --> 52:43.400]  this planet but the people running this country in Europe right now want collapse
[52:43.400 --> 52:48.160]  for everyone but them that's how they conquer us it's not a war even against
[52:48.160 --> 52:52.960]  nations or even religions it's against the individual because when they've got a
[52:52.960 --> 52:58.120]  global depression in place they're gonna play the part of the savior and the
[52:58.120 --> 53:02.880]  hand they give us is gonna drag us straight into enslavement Daria go ahead
[53:02.880 --> 53:06.720]  and tell us about this clip and then go ahead and play it and narrate for us
[53:06.720 --> 53:09.280]  why don't you give us your view I didn't tell you I was gonna do this but give us
[53:09.280 --> 53:13.720]  your view on Putin I mean you came over here you know I guess to escape the
[53:13.720 --> 53:16.600]  tyranny from Russia when you were kid you've been in the military defense
[53:16.600 --> 53:20.960]  language school a patriot you know you work here for five months we really
[53:20.960 --> 53:23.840]  like having you here you do a great job running the soundboard and run a lot of
[53:23.840 --> 53:28.720]  the video feeds and I'm really never even talked to you a lot personally I'm so
[53:28.720 --> 53:33.920]  busy about overall your view of what's happening but give us your view on this
[53:33.920 --> 53:38.080]  clip and then let's go to it okay well this looks like a bunch of reporters
[53:38.080 --> 53:43.720]  after the press conference that Putin just did today and there seems to be an
[53:43.720 --> 53:49.200]  American reporter who's trying to speak Russian to Putin and he's asking Donald
[53:49.200 --> 53:52.680]  Trump he's asking him what he thinks of Donald Trump and I think it's pretty
[53:52.680 --> 53:56.920]  cool I think I think his response is pretty cool so we can go over that
[53:56.920 --> 53:59.440]  we're gonna go to that clip in a moment and I'm putting you on the spotters is
[53:59.440 --> 54:03.920]  what I do this is truly teleprompter free and totally transparent what is your
[54:03.920 --> 54:10.360]  view overall of Putin well you know as a Russian and having to grow up in a
[54:10.360 --> 54:15.840]  system where our presidents were very disrespected we personally disrespected
[54:15.840 --> 54:22.120]  them they didn't project any power on the world stage I'm actually very proud
[54:22.120 --> 54:28.640]  of the current president of Russia and I do support him well who couldn't
[54:28.640 --> 54:32.160]  support him he's trying to stop World War three he's trying to promote families
[54:32.160 --> 54:36.720]  he's trying to restore the right to own guns he's going after some people say
[54:36.720 --> 54:40.500]  may secretly be a communist well I mean if somebody secretly a communist they
[54:40.500 --> 54:44.280]  don't do all this they don't promote freedom like like like Trump Trump's
[54:44.280 --> 54:47.760]  the only one bringing up all these topics I mean even if he's not for real
[54:47.760 --> 54:51.360]  his words are for real it's creating opposition the globalists don't like
[54:51.360 --> 54:53.640]  what Trump's doing what do you think about Trump and again I don't know your
[54:53.640 --> 54:58.560]  view we're about to find out well I'm just excited to watch him I'm glad that
[54:58.560 --> 55:03.400]  there is such a strong personality among among the candidates for the
[55:03.400 --> 55:09.200]  American presidency and finally we we have some somebody who you know can be
[55:09.200 --> 55:13.720]  bold about his words as opposed to all these puppets there are basically I
[55:13.720 --> 55:17.640]  don't know what they're doing they're on stage it's a joke I hate seeing
[55:17.640 --> 55:22.760]  presidents being kept puppets bullied by the media now a president to out of
[55:22.760 --> 55:25.200]  control is not good either he needs to he needs to follow the people in the
[55:25.200 --> 55:29.680]  Constitution in common sense but to see them bullied kept creatures by PR stunt
[55:29.680 --> 55:33.400]  man is a fraud let's go ahead and go to this clip Putin calls Trump an
[55:33.400 --> 55:36.720]  outstanding talented man nobody else is doing these translations that's why
[55:36.720 --> 55:39.520]  we're doing them so you can hear what he actually said because a lot of times
[55:39.520 --> 55:42.440]  they water down his UN speeches and other things and then we actually give
[55:42.440 --> 55:47.360]  you what he really said so a Daria go ahead all right here we go
[55:49.480 --> 55:54.800]  what do you think of Donald Trump well he's a very bright personality talented
[55:54.800 --> 56:00.280]  person without a doubt but it is not our job to judge his virtues of merits is
[56:00.280 --> 56:06.320]  the job of the voters of the United States but he is an absolute leader in
[56:06.320 --> 56:10.840]  the race for the presidency yeah he says that he wants a deep relationship
[56:10.840 --> 56:16.000]  between us to to reach new levels of cooperation how can we not support that
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.760]  of course we support that but when it comes to the eternal politics the way
[56:20.760 --> 56:25.760]  he uses his words how popular he is again I repeat that it is not our
[56:25.760 --> 56:31.800]  business to judge his words on that level so there you go there is this
[56:31.800 --> 56:35.400]  comment on Donald Trump the two reportedly friends that has really got
[56:35.400 --> 56:38.360]  upset the globalist who just want to solve killing each other fighting with
[56:38.360 --> 56:42.480]  each other on no bid contracts but the military industrial complex and Goldman
[56:42.480 --> 56:46.680]  Sachs and JP Morgan then make the money off of and then we lose all these wars
[56:46.680 --> 56:50.760]  and we spend five trillion dollars in the war on terror the last 14 years and
[56:50.760 --> 56:56.160]  now Alcatraz gone from 3,000 people to 200,000 and it's called ISIS and is
[56:56.160 --> 56:59.120]  running around with stinger missiles our government gave him I mean Daria this is
[56:59.120 --> 57:06.920]  pretty clear yeah again I'm just I'm just kind of really excited about watching
[57:06.920 --> 57:13.680]  observing this these developments on the world stage well we all got front row
[57:13.680 --> 57:17.440]  seats and it's either gonna be to Valhalla or hell thank you Daria briefly

[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:15.000]  weapons ban we're on the March the Empire is on the run the problem is
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.400]  they're going into their high-tech fortresses politically they're gonna use
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.120]  a lot of high-tech brainwashing on the public and are going to really dirty
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:27.000]  tactics now which will only be used against them in the end but it's gonna
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.160]  get rough looks it's gonna get rough I'm telling you history's being made right
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.720]  now those of you taking action are in a fight even more important than our
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:44.040]  forebears in 1776 Daria let's play this clip one more time with your live
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.200]  break down of Putin calls Trump an outstanding talent man and then I'm
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.840]  gonna get to what Trump said a few weeks ago here on the show about boot all
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.960]  right here we go
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:59.080]  what do you think of Donald Trump he's a very bright personality very talented
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:04.040]  person without a doubt but it's not our job to judge his virtues and merits but
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:09.000]  it's the job of the voters of the United States but he's an absolute eater in the
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.560]  race for the presidency he says that he wants to have a deeper relationship
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:20.880]  between us to reach new levels of cooperation how can we not support that
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:26.880]  of course we support that but when it comes to the internal politics the way
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:32.720]  he uses his words how popular he is again I repeat that it is not our business
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.800]  to judge his work on that level
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:39.560]  Putin's usual teleprompter free boom it's set a question from American and
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:46.480]  Russian nails it and it says boom that's it and it's not that Putin's perfect but
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.000]  compared to the scum that run our country that don't want us to have kids
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.920]  that don't want us to have prosperity that hate America because they're
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.360]  globalist Putin's a Russian and a lot of old-timers don't trust him because he
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.440]  was in the KGB what what are you gonna be in if you grow up in that country and
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.600]  you're talented and again trust but verify I don't completely trust Vladimir
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.360]  Putin but he gets the stage he knows what the world is he understands
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:15.920]  globalism is meant to destroy his country so he gets better and better like
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:23.640]  Donald Trump because it's the age of awakening right now and people know more
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:29.000]  than they used to let's go ahead and go to Trump with his take on my show about
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.160]  Putin can you speak to as president what your relationship would be with foreign
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.760]  leaders and what you know about Vladimir Putin because all I know is why
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:42.560]  are we starting a fight with Russia when they're not doing anything to us I think
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.760]  I get along great with people I mean I will probably get along well with him
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.240]  and if I don't somebody else will and who knows you know he's a difficult cookie
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:54.760]  he's tough and he's smart I was on the show 60 minutes with him recently not
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.120]  together I mean we they did him and they profiled me at the same show which was
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.920]  that we were stablemates right but I think I'd get along very well with him I
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.360]  think it's too fine but here's the thing we lose with every country and yet we
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.920]  don't get along with any countries China is killing us everybody's killing us
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.920]  China is just beating us to a pulp and trade Japan Mexico is killing us and yet
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:18.400]  we don't get along with anybody with me they're not going to get so rich believe
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.560]  me they're not going to get so rich at all we're going to take back our jobs
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:25.320]  we're going to take back our manufacture we take back our base but they'll like
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:30.760]  us more than they do now sort of amazing he knows how it works and not the
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.200]  Mexican people but the Mexican elites have more billionaires per capita than
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.440]  the other country in the world they literally own those people and with our
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.560]  elite they are screwing Americans he points that out and they go oh he's
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:47.160]  racist against Mexico no America winning is not racist it's not bad it's this
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:53.400]  idea that we're a format at somebody's door to be crapped on and we're not but
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:58.200]  that's what it will correct us lay down die let us run your life

[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:56.600]  also in the third hour today but I wanted to get Lord Moncton on who is the
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:04.480]  leading exposure of man-made ice age being a fraud back in the 80s then manmade
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.240]  global warming in the 90s and 2000s being a fraud now climate change so they
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:12.080]  can't be proven wrong they just claim you know the seasons are actually not
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:15.880]  normal I don't want to get into the science he's done that he's conquered
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:19.120]  that he's got peer-reviewed journals he's a top journalist inventor Margaret
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:23.440]  Thatcher's chief advisor I don't need to go into his pedigree but you got
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:27.600]  Ben Stein on Fox nothing against Ben Stein he's like could it be a hoax and
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.480]  it's like a bold courage that's so-called conservatism could it be a hoax I
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:38.280]  don't know do polar bears have white fur is Al Gore a man bear pig I mean this is
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:42.440]  ridiculous when even conservatives won't come out and say it's a fraud only
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:46.280]  senator inhofe will and that scene is radical it's not radical it's an
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:50.200]  admitted conspiracy to take over the world with carbon taxes and run our
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:56.840]  lives a new dark age unevenly distributed so I want Lord Moncton with
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.680]  his gravitas to tell us what happened they're not bragging about it they're
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:03.400]  not talking about it they're trying to hide it so does that mean a big failure
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.480]  they're always so secretive what really happened at this king of world
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.440]  government summits the most world leaders ever in any meeting he was there
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:15.160]  to cover it what are we facing next implementation by stealth is this a big
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.640]  victory and then I want to move on to other geopolitical issues they attempt
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:24.360]  to basically shut down UKIP that he helps promote these part of to help
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.120]  shut down other parties in Europe that just call for basic sanity so Lord
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.200]  Christopher Moncton I guess you're back now are you in London are you are you in
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:36.520]  Scotland where are you now you were in Paris I'm I'm in Scotland I've been to
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:40.560]  Paris and then I went to a very good climate conference in Essen in Germany
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:47.360]  and I'm now back in Edinburgh and ready to resume the battle from here and let's
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:52.400]  start if I may with that Paris climate agreement the first thing you need to
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:57.000]  know in the United States is that whatever the Obama administration tries
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:05.040]  to say this agreement does constitute a treaty at United States law and when
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:12.080]  the original UN framework convention was voted on there was an agreement
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:18.320]  between the executive branch and the Senate as to what did and did not
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:25.200]  constitute a treaty in this sphere and this document which does impose albeit
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:30.480]  in a rather voluntary way various obligations on the United States does
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:35.680]  within that definition agreed between the executive branch and the Senate
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:42.800]  constitute a treaty it therefore has no legal effect whatsoever in the United
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:49.320]  States unless and until the Senate by a two-thirds majority has ratified it as
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:53.040]  a treaty under the terms of your Constitution that's the first thing you
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.600]  need to know Alex this is a treaty mr. Obama cannot enforce it or act upon it
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:03.720]  in any way unless and until the Senate by a two-thirds majority has ratified it
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:07.320]  and I can tell you from my knowledge of the senators that they're not going to
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:13.280]  do that but of course as you know six years ago Congress shut down his
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:19.200]  carbon tax initiative and greenhouse cap but still not by stealth but openly
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:24.320]  via executive fiat he commenced to shut down over a thousand power plants
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:31.080]  doubling overall electrical prices crippling our economy this is I think a
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.760]  huge problem both in Britain where they're planning to phase out all
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:38.520]  coal-fired power altogether even though it's the cheapest most reliable and
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:43.280]  these days the cleanest form of generating electricity does less harm to
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:47.360]  the environment than anything else bar none but they're going to close that
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.720]  down this is now become a kind of religion for those who don't have
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.720]  religion J layer of the Heartline Institute sent round a very interesting
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.800]  email to me just a few days ago he said that he notices that the reason why
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.840]  most of the audiences to which he speaks don't believe that there's a problem
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.120]  with the climate is that they've all got a religion of their own already and
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:12.160]  they don't need this new one that's right and it has become a religion or
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.160]  really let us let us be very clear about this there's a distinction between a
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:21.040]  religion which may or may not be true and we can't prove it either way and a
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:26.080]  superstition which can be and in the case of global warming has been proven to be
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:31.000]  false after all there's been no global warming now for 18 years nine months the
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.960]  rate of warming on all five of the major data sets since 1997 since 1990 is well
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:42.560]  below the lowest sure we know that sir and you've documented it and it's on
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:46.400]  record they got caught hiding the decline devastating victories from five
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:49.800]  years ago people understand that and I mean you talk about a religion it's a
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:54.040]  religion where they're the high priest we pay them indulgences we've now got the
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.960]  Pope trying to get in on it by the way how is that going I know you're a
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:00.600]  Catholic I'm a lot of great Catholic friends great people and there's been a
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:06.720]  big backlash against the Pope and his behavior what do you make of his
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:11.240]  offensive to try to get everybody to sign on to the Paris deal looks like that
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.560]  didn't go too well I think that no it didn't I mean the Paris deal actually is
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:20.280]  a bit of a failure first of all it isn't legally binding there are those who try
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:26.600]  to say including the Obama administration that because the treaty imposes
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.600]  obligations it isn't really a treaty because it isn't legally binding well
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:38.320]  it isn't legally binding and the reason why is that I among others argued for
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:41.760]  many years that there should be what's called a secession clause now this
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:45.960]  wasn't in the original draft of the treaty but it was put in in the second
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:49.880]  draft and we managed to keep it in in all subsequent drafts and it reads much
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:55.760]  the same as the similar clause in the Kyoto protocol of 1997 which Canada and
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:59.480]  various other countries already taken advantage of to leave this process and
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:04.280]  now that secession clause has been put into this treaty too and what that means
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:09.280]  is that any nation that finally wakes up comes off the Kool-Aid and realizes
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.400]  that global warming is not happening and isn't going to happen anything like the
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:18.280]  originally predicted rate they can now walk away without any penalty and all
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:22.240]  they have to do to achieve that is to give a single year's notice so it's
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:27.040]  really quite a feeble document and indeed they haven't even been able to
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:32.160]  narrow down what the target amount of the army force then to go into a stealth
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:37.360]  mode is what you're saying what they're doing is they they have now this this
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.440]  was the high point this is that the high tide mark on the scum filled bath of
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:48.040]  water if you like this is the the highest that the global warming extremists
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.440]  are going to achieve from here on in the water is running out of the bath all
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:55.240]  it leaves a little bit of scum behind and that so this is a death rattle a dead
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:59.640]  cat bounce as they bounce down the ravine towards their final end that's
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:02.720]  right it's still costing now I think the latest estimate is one and a half
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:07.440]  trillion dollars a year worldwide in people having to pay extra for their
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.120]  electricity in their gasoline purely because of this global warming nonsense
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:15.760]  after all the prices raw material prices of coal oil and gas have all fallen in
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.120]  recent years and have fallen very rapidly in the last year or so and yet
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.960]  electricity prices are double or triple what they were 10 years ago
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.840]  totally corrupted I mean as they admit it and of course you warn their own
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.520]  government just to just to go back something you said earlier though
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:35.400]  because that's not just a claim they admit that modern UK US Japanese coal
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:41.360]  plants nothing comes out nothing but water vapor and carbon dioxide and then
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.040]  they tell us they're horrible and dirty when it is of the cleanest energy there
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:51.560]  is that is exactly right you see what happens now is that inside these coal
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:56.280]  fired plants they have two principle methods of technology one of them was
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:59.480]  invented by a friend of mine at Cambridge who was an engineer there in the
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:04.760]  science department and he invented a thing called fluidized bed combustion
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:09.040]  and this is a very efficient way of taking either pulverized or pelletized
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:14.160]  coal and you make it into a kind of fluid and it burns very very efficiently
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:19.480]  and the boilers are now so efficient that they're literally 99.5% efficient the
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:23.120]  odd 0.5% is just a little bit of conduction of heat through the walls of
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:26.840]  the boiler otherwise it's completely efficient it's the most efficient way
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:29.520]  of generating and of course it got developed in England because that's
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:33.360]  where coal got discovered and used there and in Germany what a crime to have
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:37.280]  England that literally invented the modern world's cold systems being shut
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.480]  down where you won't have any of it but India and China and Mexico can have the
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:46.840]  most old fuming stinking plants and build new ones it is it is a crime against
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:50.440]  our nations I want to ask you why they want to shut down the West on the other
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:55.560]  side Lord Christopher Monkton science and public policy dot org is the key
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:01.240]  website stay with us still wondering what to get that special someone that has
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:05.800]  everything at ID stronghold we still find that a huge percentage of people do
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:09.960]  not yet have an RFID blocking wallet or purse to protect them from the new and
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:14.120]  growing threat of electronic pickpocketing that's right even though 40% of
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:18.800]  all new chipped payment card shipped in 2014 contain a wireless interface called
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:23.360]  RFID that allows the account information to be skimmed by a thief passing near
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:27.360]  your cards most people are still unprotected the good news is that ID
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:31.080]  stronghold makes luxurious leather wallets and other products that prevent

[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:21.880]  oil companies lined up to shut down coal I have no investment in coal zero
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:28.880]  money in my life from coal but I know the science and I watch the average
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:33.360]  middle-class person or poor working person see their prices in the United
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:37.600]  States the last seven years double for electricity even as other energy prices
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:44.640]  go down and the elite know what they're doing I mean Prince Charles is literally
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:49.200]  has his palaces heated with taxpayer money but he doesn't want people in the
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:56.120]  UK to have cheap coal power and there's it's just a hypocrisy of hundreds and
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:00.120]  hundreds of giant private jets caviar thousand dollar meals huge carbon
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:05.200]  footprints lecturing us at Paris Lord monster these people know how ridiculous
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:09.000]  they look I mean you know them well you've been tracking them for decades
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.080]  who are these elites what's their problem why do they have such ill-willed
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:16.960]  to people why do they want to shut down our development and growth when
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:22.920]  development cleans things up what's their problem this is a very old problem
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:27.960]  it's known as ties on declare in in print it's a betrayal by the governing
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.520]  class and this time for the first time it's a global betrayal by the governing
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:36.600]  class the governing class tends always to act in its own interest and it tends
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:42.400]  also always to be largely dictatorial largely totalitarian it wants to
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:47.280]  govern so when they get a subject like climate change they come along and they
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:50.680]  grab at this and they seize it and it makes them feel important we are the
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:54.120]  people who are here at this historic juncture we are going to save the world
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:58.400]  from itself at your expense and mine of course it won't be paying for this it
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:02.440]  will be profiting from it so there's a large profit motive in this there's a
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:08.400]  large area of self-aggrandizement and I think with Prince Charles frankly the
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.120]  point is that the monarchy in Britain is not an absolute monarchy it's a
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:15.880]  constitutional monarchy it's a monarchy in which effectively as far as
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:21.800]  politics is concerned the monarch has no real official role as a result Charles
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:26.640]  has always been looking for ways in which to make himself seem relevant and he
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:30.360]  knows that the only way to make himself seem relevant to the left at the moment
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:34.640]  is to pretend to believe in all this global warming stuff now he's not a
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:41.000]  he's not the brightest chilling in the bank so he's not really understanding
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.840]  the science he's not one of those who that that small number who know
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:48.760]  perfectly well that this is nonsense but are saying that it's true anyway and
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:52.880]  those are the ones that we are now going after because in Prague a few months
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:58.840]  ago a new outfit was set up called the International Geoethics Committee to
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:04.880]  bring back or elementary standards of ethics and honesty and poverty into the
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:09.040]  earth sciences including the climate sciences and I've been asked to set up
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:14.480]  a fraud investigation team because we are now looking at this as fraud and we
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:19.200]  are looking with some interest I may say at some of the so-called initiatives
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:24.560]  set up by Prince Charles and they too some of those may be frauds let it
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:30.360]  be clear the son of the monarch may be guilty of fraud he has established for
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:38.000]  instance a thing called the climate change law initiative and the aim of
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.880]  this initiative is to bully and pester and drag into court innocent
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:50.960]  corporations on the ground that in his opinion they are not kowtowing to the
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:56.320]  climate change orthodoxy to which he subscribes now the danger in getting
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:01.280]  getting into that route is that any court case that eventually happened would
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:05.240]  look very carefully at the evidence for whether or not there really is a problem
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:09.360]  with the climate when that evidence is is considered as it was for instance in
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:15.480]  the Al Gore case in the London High Court in 2007 when his film I wrote the
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:21.000]  scientific testimony he was found by the court to have committed nine errors as
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.040]  the court called them serious errors of science and the court would have banned
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:30.560]  the film unless the Department of Education against whom a trucker in
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:34.800]  Dartford brought the case because he didn't want his kids exposed to what
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.920]  was rank political propaganda that the judge would have banned the film and he
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.760]  said he would have banded unless the department had agreed to circulate 77
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:47.240]  pages of corrective guidance to every school in England before the movie was
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:51.600]  shown now of course very few kids ever get told that that guidance exists this
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.440]  was really a way of the judge having to admit there was something wrong with
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:59.400]  the film but not being prepared actually to guess so far as to ban it but
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:03.440]  nevertheless the point is established that if you take cases like this to
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:08.200]  court as Prince Charles is now saying he wants to do he is going to get a very
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:12.800]  great surprise because because if you bring a case to court vexatiously and
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:18.760]  frivolously you can end up being cited for contempt and we're still even for
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:22.520]  fraud because you've been saying for years they won't really do it and they
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:26.200]  don't because in any real court they're afraid it's all bluster to make them
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:29.920]  sound official and imply we're criminal but the truth is we're trying to get
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:34.240]  them in court and you do get them in the court and routinely slice them in a
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:38.480]  little chunks I want to come back and talk about their latest propaganda blitzes
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:41.600]  and other offensives that you've researched that you believe they're
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:46.240]  preparing to launch straight ahead future intel on how we continue to win the

[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:41.800]  and analysis I've gotten into Martin Scurly gets a call from special agent
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.680]  during YouTube live stream he's the guy that increased drug prices five thousand
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:52.880]  times five thousand percent he's now been arrested so we're gonna be talking
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:58.960]  about some of that coming up talk about arrogance talk about giving free market a
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:06.240]  bad name 5,000% drug increase that guy looks like a sniveling villain I mean
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:11.160]  so many times the book cover really does match what's inside when it comes to
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:14.600]  people not with books the cover of a book doesn't usually actually tell you
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:21.040]  what's in it but people I don't know I mean if I was casting for like a sub
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:27.120]  villain to say Dr. Evil like a mini me that would I think he would actually I
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:33.080]  think he would actually get the job now continuing Lord Christopher Monk and
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:36.080]  Sierra we got it for another five minutes or so and I wish him a wonderful
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:41.480]  Christmas and I just admire him as a true modern night and shining armor out
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:47.200]  there he could have easily joined with the dark side with Sauron and been part
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:51.160]  of the club and enriched himself to a great extent but instead I know he never
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:55.920]  talks about this he has made great sacrifices in his businesses and
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:02.080]  career to follow these people around the world and expose their their fraud and
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:05.840]  so that's why he's the most demonized person exposing man-made climate change
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:11.400]  so we salute Lord Monkton here at the end of 2015 and wish him another 50
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:15.280]  plus years here on Terra Farman because we know there'll be other dragons to
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:20.000]  slay but thank you so much for all you do Lord Monkton well Alex that's one of
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.120]  the nicest testimonials I've ever had please broadcast that on a continuous
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:29.240]  loop and also it's it's right that I should wish you and all your wonderful
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.560]  audience I think it's now what 20 million people
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:36.400]  all the very all the well conservatively all the very best for Christmas and the
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:40.560]  new year and I'm going to do what you do I'm going to call it not happy holidays
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.320]  or happy Hanukkah I'm going to call it happy Christmas we are allowed to
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:50.960]  remember our own Christian heritage and we are also allowed to play the being
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.600]  offended game I think we can say we are offended when we can't put up our
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:58.840]  Christmas trees and our Christmas lights because various people pretend that
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:03.120]  they're offended by them they're not and we should just carry on and put them up
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:08.240]  anyway and let us vote out of office any more of these people who try to say we
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:11.880]  can't have Christmas we can have it where a Christian country we're going to
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:16.040]  keep keep up the art traditions and why shouldn't we and that's of course yeah
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:19.400]  there's your Christmas tree now I'm delighted to see what a splendid one it
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:23.360]  is in red white and blue it's a patriotic Christmas tree so you've killed two
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:28.320]  birds with one stone I like to see that so very best to you Alex because you too
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:33.960]  are a fighter for freedom and you too do not find it easy financially to keep
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:39.480]  this fast network going it is difficult for us on the side of light and truth
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:45.440]  but as Mother Teresa of Calcutta used to say there was never too much money for
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:50.200]  what she was doing there was always just enough and anyone who does the Lord's
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:55.000]  work as Jim Inhove called it in a video to us at the Heartland Conference which
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.240]  took place in Paris just a few days ago any of us who do the Lord's work will
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:03.200]  always find those just enough for us to carry on doing it you know it really is
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:07.240]  Providence that George Washington talked about and and of course Churchill
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:11.120]  talked about it as well that every time doors close and we're attacked and we're
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:15.760]  in trouble all the sudden other doors literally magically pop open and we get
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:21.360]  just enough I mean it really is incredible that is exactly what happens
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:25.240]  and it's been the same with me you know what we're all living hand-to-mouth
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.480]  these days thanks to the vast overtaxation we all have to endure but
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:34.680]  we manage anywhere the point is that they are now in retreat they're so
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:39.280]  desperate that at the climate conference one of the delegates came up to me and
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:46.240]  he said look he said you all you skeptics you've all got gray hair now and he said
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:50.840]  we all we have to do is just wait and eventually you'll all be dead and then
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:54.400]  that we will rule the world and we will do away with capitalism all together
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:57.560]  because this has got nothing to do with the climate it's all about abolishing
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:02.120]  capitalism bringing back an unholy mixture of fascism and communism we
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:07.200]  might call it phasmonism it's the new totalitarianism on the block it's a
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:11.560]  very unpleasant form of government and already the likes of Prince Charles are
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:16.240]  lining themselves up with this by saying that the likes of me for daring to
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:21.160]  question this even in a scientific journal he is saying we should now be
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:25.480]  brought into court and prosecuted for daring to say that there is another side
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:30.080]  to the case that's what his climate change law initiative is aiming to do
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:34.640]  it's aiming to pester pester companies first and then no doubt individuals and
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:39.640]  well we will fight him and we will fight him in court if necessary because if the
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:44.640]  only way to make him realize that if he goes on talking this nonsense then he
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:49.080]  could get into trouble is perhaps that he will have to face trial for fraud he is
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:54.600]  not protected against trial after all there was a famous ancestor of his
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:39:01.000]  called King Charles the first who was tried at Whitehall and was executed so
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.080]  he had better be very careful to stay within the constitutional constraints
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:10.560]  which mean that on this heavily political subject on which the largest
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:14.600]  party in the last European elections and the party that grew the fastest in the
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:17.960]  last general elections the United Kingdom independence party has a view which
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:22.040]  is diametrically opposed to his and that brings me to my final question a Lord
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:26.160]  Moncton because of time constraints my final question without even asking you
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.800]  got into the censorship issue Portland's calling for banning Trump's speech the
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:36.360]  heavy ACLU in Colorado said murder his supporters had a step down they are have
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:41.120]  new charges for LePen for talking about about ISIS and sending out tweets against
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:48.920]  them I mean it's so brazen it's so open it's so arrogant how tyrannical these
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:55.040]  people openly are and it really shows how how dangerous they are and really
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:58.680]  what they're pushing for and what they want to do I mean have they really
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:05.360]  expose themselves they have and indeed even the Supreme Court so-called here
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:10.400]  in the UK just opposite Parliament they have come out they did a propaganda
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:15.960]  event on climate change just a few weeks ago they're now refusing to answer a
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:20.760]  freedom of information requests about it and they are in breach of the law in
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:26.120]  doing that and it's all about to end up in court because they too are trying to
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:30.320]  deny freedom of speech to anyone who dares to question the new orthodoxy and
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:34.160]  they're saying there is no political debate about it they're saying there is
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:39.360]  no political controversy that's the new official line the fact that the party
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:44.200]  that came at top in the European elections and it's Europe that makes
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:47.880]  environmental and climate law for the United Kingdom we don't really do it
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:52.520]  anymore the fact that party totally disagrees with the official party line
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:56.880]  that to the Supreme Court does not constitute political controversy they
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:01.360]  say there is no political debate anymore on this subject and so they can come out
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:05.440]  and say what they like about it they are about to discover that that is wrong
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:09.800]  they either answer my freedom of information questions or I will be
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:15.600]  taking them to court on judicial review of their failure to recuse the judge who
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:22.000]  in particular exhibited flagrant malice and bias in that that propaganda event
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.040]  which they are not taking prisoners here we're going to send that
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:30.400]  judge to jail if necessary we are not going to be bullied and we're not going
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.900]  to have each silence and let that be the same for you in the United States
[01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:40.600]  Alex we must fly the flag of freedom even as those who govern us try to tear it
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:44.680]  from our hands well I've noticed Lord Martin in closing that in the past you
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:49.800]  were very conservative very gentlemanly you still are but as their rhetoric it's
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:56.440]  more draconian more fascistic more you know fascist slash communist you are
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:00.800]  upping in the threat continuum basically up to their level and that's a very good
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:04.880]  thing that is the answer to be bold in their face thank you so much and
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:07.000]  have a great Christmas coming up say how do your wife for me

[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:09.600]  it's just fun to fight me I know we got all this news to get into but I've been
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:12.560]  pretty wound up lately and it's because you were here three and a half years ago
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:16.400]  I was a little bit bummed out but I mean I think we're winning Leanne I do too it
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:21.000]  just it's it amazes me how every single time you know the mainstream media will
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:25.120]  try and attack we just get bigger and it's incredible just the support we have
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.920]  they're kind of coming out of the woodwork now even Kurt Russell you'll
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:31.960]  see people in Hollywood when that when they start to put that hammer down people
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:35.720]  are gonna start speaking up and I exactly and what are they gonna do when
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:39.360]  almost every big star you can imagine is a listener of the show in a
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:42.920]  patriot and I don't brag about the show it's a litmus test but most of them and
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.640]  you've been behind the scenes you know by a lot of this won't come on though but
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:49.000]  they say hey I'm a listener exactly I mean when they all start going public it
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.400]  is gonna jack the globalist up right because I think that they're not gonna
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:56.040]  be you know in their next film or something like that they'll be black
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:59.640]  bald from the end how they're gonna blackball all of them exactly and that's
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:04.480]  what we need is we need people to start speaking up I mean today was one of those
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:08.080]  days I woke up and I wanted to get inside of my invisible jet and fly away
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:12.600]  forever because it was just so frustrating the news that is going on today
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:16.880]  with you want to just touch my golden rope I want to tie Congress up with the
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:22.760]  goal and force them to speak the truth because here as well as the media as well
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:27.480]  as the president coming out today and saying oh there's nothing to be worried
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:30.160]  about there's no credible terror threat meanwhile all you're seeing on
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:35.600]  television is terror terror terror it's just it's mass confusion on purpose to
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.640]  paralyze the public so that they can't do anything about Congress it's like a
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:43.640]  Wonder Woman ropes around of it to itself like a bad Wonder Woman tied them up
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:50.440]  they just have to submit yeah bad people Lee and there is so much news to get to
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:56.680]  here let's cover this Martin Screlly Screlly I mean still can't get his name
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:59.760]  right nothing it's the word Screlly it just sounds like a little weasley guy
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:05.600]  really five thousand percent increase in these in these pills right and he's
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:09.760]  proud of himself and now he's in trouble right and not only that but he is the
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:15.520]  sole owner of the only copy of the latest Wu Tang album so he not only buys
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:18.200]  the patents for all these prescription drugs so that he can then raise the
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:22.840]  prices five thousand percent he goes and buys the only Wu Tang album for two
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:25.840]  million dollars and of course he's now been arrested by the Federal Bureau of
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:29.960]  Investigation yeah well and so he's it's a little bit of karma so it he's been
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:35.480]  arrested for securities fraud the FBI you see him there in handcuffs today I
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:39.960]  guess he was illegally selling off some of his stocks from one company to pay
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:44.800]  off the debt and you know the thugs that were probably he was rat-holing stock
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:48.800]  yeah exactly so he's just a good guy but you know you see him there in his
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:52.560]  hoodie his gray hoodie so he this probably he feels like it gives him a
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:57.720]  little more street cred because he's apparently wants to be like in with the
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:03.240]  rappers and stuff so he's a good guy very good guy so I guess this is a little
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:07.520]  Christmas karma for Martin Shkreli now if we could just get some Christmas karma
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:12.600]  for Congress he does look like the consummate weasel I think he's got a
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:16.040]  job in Hollywood is a weasel look at that little simpering look on his face I
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:20.760]  mean my goodness well he's kind of like made off he was a mid-level con artist
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:24.840]  not in the actual elite that's why they burned him yeah well that's the thing
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:28.200]  it's like how many times do stuff like that happen and you look the other way
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:32.800]  or you know perhaps they get tossed off he was a Nazi war criminal and funded
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:37.560]  anti-gun initiative to get an ADL award right so for whatever reason this guy is
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:40.560]  going he's gonna be the one that gets thrown thrown into the bus because it's
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:45.720]  not like he's the only person who's raised the prices on on drugs that are
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:49.560]  you know people just did it the most yeah well Americans do pay the most for
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:54.520]  drugs it overnight it is wrong Lee and shifting years another subject what do
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:58.160]  you think of Vladimir Putin coming out and saying he likes Donald Trump thinks
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:01.200]  he's a talented man that wants to work with Russia and that how can Russia be
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:05.040]  against that they have to welcome that stance well I mean Carly Fiorina said
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:09.640]  that Trump respect I mean the Putin respects you know someone that's strong
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:13.960]  he respects strength so I guess he just likes the fact that Trump's coming out
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:17.160]  and speaking his mind and well Trump doesn't want to start World War three
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:24.920]  for no reason right yeah which is insane insane why would you want to shoot
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:28.160]  down a Russian plane that has been invited into that airspace and that's
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:33.800]  bombing ISIS somebody said Chris Christie needs a no-fry zone well yeah
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:37.040]  well he needs it around his refrigerator at night no I gotta hand it to me he's
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:39.600]  lost a lot of weight I mean you know I've lost a lot of weight too but I was
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:42.480]  never that big I'm not against fat people hell I mean I'm just being clear
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:46.120]  here that Chris Christie wants to eat the Constitution and I'm not gonna let him
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:49.320]  we'll be right back on the other side with Lee and Mac and do you got a bunch

[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:38.000]  free today Star Wars spoilers should be a crime since Philadelphia Police
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:43.680]  Department that means after you go pay to see it you shouldn't be able to I mean
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:46.880]  we don't even have a culture now our culture Star Wars I'm not against Star
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:50.960]  Wars it's just not a real culture they say not even to talk about it on your
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:55.680]  way out of the movie theater well just because they're talking like that we're
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:59.000]  gonna send our reporters there we're gonna do we're gonna talk about it and
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.840]  I've already got what the plot is and I'm gonna talk about it oh my gosh I need
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:09.000]  to make Hollywood Fox billions more it's you know it I'm not going to see the
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.560]  film so far and again it's an attack on free speech it's all part of this
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:16.640]  training us we don't have speech and I'm tired of it somebody that goes to see
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:20.600]  a movie has every right to talk about it and write reviews about it under the
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:24.920]  First Amendment Lee and well I agree and this whole thing with Star Wars yeah I
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:29.480]  know it's so very exciting but look at this huge spending bill that is is being
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:33.640]  shoved down our throats at the final hour when Congress is about to go on
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:38.800]  their Christmas break and all anyone can think about is Star Wars and fake
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:44.400]  terror threats and Caitlyn Jenner and Caitlyn stunning and brave Congress
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:48.240]  half trillion dollar spending binge one of the biggest ever's massive increase
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:54.280]  in the budget nearly 700 billion unpaid tax cuts that's political reporting and
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:59.320]  they admit it's the biggest junk it ever the biggest boondoggles ever the
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:04.400]  biggest pork barrel ever mainly for Democrats so Paul Ryan has delivering
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:10.440]  them succulent goodies and they voted more of them than Democrats voted than
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:14.560]  Republicans voted for it showing we have Democratic operatives running the
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:19.600]  Republican Party right absolutely and and David Knight was right to call him
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:23.720]  Paul Ryan oh because he came in there it's gonna do more the same of course
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:26.440]  he's gonna get a pass on this because everyone's just gonna say oh well he
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:30.360]  just was you know well he's skinny and he's skinny and looks like the boy next
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:34.200]  door now he looks like a serial killer yes most serial killers look like the
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:39.000]  guy next door I agree and so you know we want to point out that none of this is
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.760]  gonna be paid for by budget cuts or other tax offsets it's all gonna be added
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:47.360]  to the national debt they have no plan to pay for this I would not do business
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:50.120]  with Paul Ryan I mean I just a guy that looks like that with those eyes as a
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:52.960]  predator and thinks I'm stupid and thinks he's tougher than me and you're not
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:57.120]  you're a punk you're a scumbag filth I'm sorry sorry we ain't go ahead I'm just
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:01.360]  getting really angry at him and so by the way now this is supposedly gonna help
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:05.840]  out both sides of the of the aisle there you know their Christmas presents for
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:10.080]  everybody so the tax break package it's gonna cost hundreds of billions of
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:14.480]  dollars over the next ten years it includes presents for a NASCAR horse
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:19.000]  racing and a whole slew of other guys NASCAR needs more money it isn't one of
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.440]  those profitable ventures in America right that's what I mean I'm sick of all
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:26.600]  these insider corporations who line up almost to a corporation anti-gun
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:30.080]  probe and border anti-family well of course they want to run the government
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:33.800]  because they're all getting my tax money but then as a small business owner that
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:37.480]  actually employs people in America and manufacturers things I'm being screwed
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:42.960]  over right and and romp I'm sorry Rand Paul said you know it's not charity when
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:45.880]  it's other people's money so they're just giving away all of our money and
[01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:50.280]  then just filling us with terror I mean I was in there looking at CNN for in the
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:53.840]  entire hour it's just all about all these terror things all over the not a
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:57.800]  single thing on this very important Europe is now saying they're gonna have
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:01.120]  standing armies patrolling banning free speech but letting more radical
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:04.980]  Muslims in they used it to have a standing army take over just like
[01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:10.540]  Palpatine took over the you know the Empire by staging terror attacks they're
[01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:14.520]  literally taking over via Star Wars plot right and it's just ridiculous and it
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:18.480]  is all meant to instill us with fear so that we're paralyzed and we can't do
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:21.560]  anything about it that's right by the way when that movie came out seven eight
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:24.920]  years ago revenge the Sith or whatever I did reviews of we ought to find those
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:27.280]  and play those in the mountain who's tonight where I break down how it's

[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:38.080]  The fighting.
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:46.480]  Ladies and gentlemen the only reason I've been so successful is because I've
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:51.080]  had a historical context I've studied and I've been aggressive and I've known
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:54.760]  that all that evil men and tyrants seem to flourish is that good men and women do
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:01:04.320]  nothing and because I have been a maniac since I was born a good maniac I've been
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:08.040]  somewhat immune to being put into a trance so I'm just awake watching the
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:11.360]  total takeover and I'm just jumping up and down like a chicken with my head cut
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:14.840]  off saying we got to do something and the reason I get into my personal
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:21.280]  experience is it's a blueprint for success. Stop worrying about getting it all
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:24.600]  perfectly right or don't think you're a leader or I'm gonna do it next year or
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:30.960]  next month get involved now pick an issue get involved get aggressive. Vote with
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:34.960]  your dollars. Leigh Ann we've got a clip here from Senator Sessions trying to stop
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:39.200]  this spending bill one of the biggest the biggest ever pork barrel they
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:43.480]  broken it down massive for the Democrats huge little little gifts out of the tree
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:48.360]  for them I guess gun owners and patriots we get crumpets visits us to haul us off
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:55.500]  on a slave ship but let's go ahead and go to Senator Sessions. For years the
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:02:00.600]  American people have suffered under the lawless dangerous wage reducing
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:05.560]  immigration policies of this administration they sent us to Washington
[02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:10.440]  they sent us here the people did to protect their interest to protect the
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:16.920]  people's interest to ensure the defense of their families and to advance the
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:22.920]  common good the public interest they did not send us here to bow down to the
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:28.400]  president's lawless immigration policies nor to line the pockets of special
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:34.920]  interest in big business that's not what we are here for. Who do we represent?
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:41.320]  This ominous bill approves the president's request for increased refugee
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:46.280]  admissions allowing him to bring in as many refugees as he wants and he can
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:51.600]  bring them from anywhere he wants and allowed him access to unlimited
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:57.480]  welfare and entitlements at the taxpayer expense which is not scored as a
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:04.200]  cost 700 billion not paid for it will ensure that at least 170,000 green
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:07.800]  cards that means permanent residency with a guaranteed path to
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:15.800]  citizenship, refugee, and asylume approvals will be issued to migrants from
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:20.440]  Muslim countries just over the next 12 months. That's right Leanne. It contains
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:24.520]  dramatic changes to federal immigration laws. In fact I missed this earlier on the
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:27.200]  show but I should have made a bigger deal it's not even the money it's that it's
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:31.280]  basically an open border blank check to a bozo. And there are two bills people
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:34.520]  need to understand so the Republicans basically sold us out to get their
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:39.160]  little nearly 700 billion dollar tax package which is just given these
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:42.800]  extenders temporary tax breaks but the other one that's supposed to be voted on
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:48.200]  tomorrow is a massive 1.1 trillion dollar spending bill it's pretty much
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:53.880]  Obama's agenda it's the omnibus funding bill okay and the president actually
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:57.880]  gloated over the agreement saying that he got nearly everything he wanted and
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:04:03.200]  gave up very little oh good job Paul Ryan so now this this omnibus funding
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:08.680]  bill it increases foreign worker visas okay so it will more than triple the
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:13.240]  number of H2B visas these are not just you know people come into work jobs
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:18.000]  Americans don't want these are brought in exclusively to fill blue collar non-farm
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:23.040]  jobs in hotels restaurants construction truck driving and many other
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:26.960]  occupations that I'm not against foreigners but it's like the Star
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:31.360]  Wars spacebar everywhere I go when I call customer service I can't understand a
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:35.760]  word they're saying right and that's not all I mean his climate deal isn't it
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:40.200]  Planned Parenthood is funded I mean it is a lose-lose for the American people we
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:43.400]  got sold out once again I mean they're probably gonna pass it they're voting on
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:46.600]  it today tomorrow so they're gonna wrap it up in a nice that's right stay there
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:50.400]  let's come back and recap that because the whole immigration thing you know
[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:55.480]  al-Qaeda pipeline ISIS pipeline is huge and then I want to get into some of the
[02:04:55.480 --> 02:05:00.120]  second amendment news they're coming for the guns a mistrial has been declared
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:04.440]  in the case of Baltimore police officer William Porter in the death of 25 year
[02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:08.680]  old Freddie Gray the jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision on the four
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:13.520]  charges the officer faces Porter is the first of six city police officers to
[02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:17.840]  stand trial in the death of Freddie Gray Gray suffered a broken neck and severe
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:21.000]  spinal cord injury while being transported in the back of a police
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:26.200]  van after his arrest on April 12th he died in police custody Baltimore city's

[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:43.080]  community leaders are issuing calls for calm and peaceful protests but some
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:46.880]  black lives matter supporters are already threatening to stage riots in
[02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:50.880]  Baltimore and some fear there could be a repeat of the massive rioting that took
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:54.800]  place in the city at the end of April this is a developing story so stay

[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:47.280]  be asleep to believe it but I'll tell you what they don't want they don't want a
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:50.680]  population of citizens capable of critical thinking they don't want well
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:55.920]  informed well educated people capable of critical thinking that doesn't help
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:10:01.800]  them that's against their interest that's right from the front lines of the information
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:09.720]  war it's Alex Jones right up here on the front line is a Lee and Macadoo in

[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:52.440]  masses of idiot followers and in dumbed-down victims yeah he's trying to
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:56.160]  savage the poor blacks of this country to make them total slaves again doubling
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:59.000]  their unemployment with viciousness because he knows he's got him he doesn't
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:03.200]  eat him I mean this is sick he tries to rally we need your help to get the guns

[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:14.120]  vote I need your power to destroy it and slave the better clingers I'm saying
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:21.720]  spread the word get aggressive fire these people in the war spray them with
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:26.880]  truth that's what you do when you tell people on Facebook and Twitter about the
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:31.960]  show when you promote our videos when you send them to people I mean quite
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:35.720]  frankly there's a type of mania that comes into this in a good way when
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:40.760]  you're in a fight for your life because you know you're committed you're not on
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:45.400]  the sidelines you're not aimless you don't know you know what's going on
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:51.000]  when you're in a coma when you do know what's going on it's so dynamic it's so
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.600]  exciting and once people get into the fight for liberty they go why did I do
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:59.160]  this before this is what I was meant to do yes that's what Jefferson called it
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:03.880]  the animating contest of liberty Thomas Jefferson was a gentleman had like a
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:07.680]  hundred and seventy IQ probably you know could speak six languages wrote the
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:11.040]  Declaration of Independence but he would bounce off the walls talking about
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:15.520]  freedom that's what you're supposed to do you're either climbing the walls for
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:19.720]  freedom folks or you're in a coma and you're dead already and see what we're
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:23.600]  doing is we're we're trying to bring everybody into the club because the
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:26.680]  globalist control people through information and folks not knowing how
[02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:30.840]  things really work and thousands of flavors of disinfo and twisted
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:37.040]  information and false paradigms and half-truths bologna sandwiches horse
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:42.920]  manure sandwiches all thrown at us two plus two equals five Heather has two
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:47.400]  mommies just to confuse the kids and then we're like are open-minded and
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:51.000]  liberal you know the average Americans very classically liberal though well I
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.400]  don't want to hurt anybody's feelings I guess that sounds kind of extreme but
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:13:01.840]  okay but it's all done premeditatedly to hurt us the globalist admit it and so
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:05.560]  what I'm saying to you is break with the new world order don't believe what I
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:11.280]  believe just tune into what we're saying check it out go find YouTube videos
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:15.160]  from ten years ago go watch my films from 18 years ago go see it for
[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:21.240]  yourself and find out how truthful we've been find out how visionary we've been
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:26.080]  find out how ahead of the game by many millions of light years we've been for
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:34.400]  one big reason we didn't care what people said about us that was politically but
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:37.960]  that's only the surface we were willing to do it there were lots people in the
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:40.840]  truth they just weren't willing to do it because of ridicule because of
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:45.840]  demonization because of threats well put me in that briar patch any day that's
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:51.760]  where I'm alive because I'm a fighter I'm not a slave so I wasn't afraid to be
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:56.240]  demonized but more importantly the globalist think you're idiots they
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:00.040]  think you failed they think you live in La La Land brought up with television and
[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:06.840]  fake culture where Star Wars is your culture and they think that you're
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:10.840]  already beaten so they've written thousands of white papers and books and
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:15.440]  publications and speeches admitting everything I have on the bookshelves
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:18.560]  we've done videos on I've shown it to you many times I have on the bookshelves
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:24.280]  here more than 20 books we've done videos where I just go through and show you
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:31.320]  the quotes where world leaders past and present top scientists people like the
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:34.800]  White House science are openly admit they put fluoride in your water to
[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:40.040]  reduce your fertility and lower your IQ to make you manageable they write 1100
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:46.320]  page books admitting it like tragedy and hope and eco science you can read both
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:50.360]  books online for free I'm gonna read 1100 pages well that's because you don't
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:55.520]  want to be informed and successful if I was an evil person wanting to serve the
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:15:01.400]  globalist I would read tragedy and hope I would read the technotronic era I
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:05.560]  would read all these globalist publications because 99.9% of their
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:09.960]  own minions don't do it and can't even operate and have to be sent to special
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:15.920]  Harvard and Yale double PhD secret programs we've had members of on the
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:19.960]  show like Francis Boyle who wrote our chemical and biological weapons treaties
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:27.520]  he was in there mulling the whole time to overturn them he's on a fly list this
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:31.960]  bot in the spy to use some cheesy Star Wars analogy brought all this info out
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:38.260]  and the list goes on and on they get special PhDs to even be in the super
[02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:42.960]  class there's only a few thousand of them you're getting the PhD education
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:48.520]  with an entertaining crazy Texan foaming at the mouth the truth is I'm so
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:53.360]  exhausted I've got to get in here and get wound up to even be able to perform
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:59.680]  the duty of exposing this to understand you're getting valuable info you could
[02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:06.200]  use the information here if you were evil or a sociopath to actually get into
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:09.280]  the new world order did you ever know but here's the deal the average psycho or
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:13.600]  sociopath or dumb control freak is so stupid they're just smart enough to
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:18.680]  prey on people they're not smart enough to actually go to advanced levels they're
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:26.280]  too lazy because evil is about quick power easy power you're pathetic those
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:32.120]  of you that serve evil I am here with those that do care that want to be free
[02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:37.880]  exposing the bigger paradigm and I'm proud of that fact and I'm proud of all
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:40.720]  of you that spread the word about this broadcast just as I admire people like
[02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:45.000]  Lord Monkton or or Matt Drudge or my reporters or people that take action or
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:49.680]  James O'Keefe I admire all of you for what you've done and when you walk up to
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:52.400]  me on the street corner well that's the bottom of the honor back into they got
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:57.160]  a lot of news to cover but I'm just ranting here today it brings tears to my
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:17:00.680]  eyes when I go out in public I can't go to Barnes and Nobles not bragging to
[02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:05.680]  showing how people are awake and almost everyone I walk by black white Hispanic

[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:14.080]  everything online I can't even go out in public because I can't get down the
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:18.240]  street now Joe Biggs goes all over the country and gets mobbed now he can't go
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:21.680]  to a restaurant I'd have his dinner bot for him he's been a reporter here for a
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:25.640]  couple years a year and a half whatever it is the point is freedom is popular
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:30.120]  freedom is big freedom is exploding but we have to admit to ourselves how
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:34.120]  successful freedoms been and I look at you counting on me telling me how great
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:38.840]  I am I'm nobody I want to be free just like you I'm just like you so when I'm
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:43.440]  looking at you you're looking at me I admire you too and it's humbling and I
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:47.880]  can't stand it because I know I'm weak I know I fail I know I'm not perfect and
[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:51.720]  to see all these men women and children counting on me is a heavy load a heavy
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:55.520]  burden I'm telling you something right now I'm counting on you to take action
[02:17:55.520 --> 02:18:01.200]  I'm counting on you to stand up I'm waiting for you and you've already taken
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:05.440]  action but realize how important you are and take action even harder we only got
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:08.160]  a bunch of news there I've been ranting about this subject what do you have to
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:12.240]  say I'm just you know my breath is kind of taken away because you're so right I
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:18.040]  mean there are just they think that we are a huge sleeping joke and they do
[02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:23.000]  this every single time they're about to go on recess or their Christmas holiday
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:26.600]  that's gonna cost taxpayers four million dollars and then they do these
[02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:31.160]  awful things to the American people laughing in our face and then you go to
[02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:34.880]  the mainstream media and they're not even reporting on it until they might say
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:38.640]  oh I wonder why no one's worried about the economy huh it's their job to keep
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:43.600]  me in the dark till it's too late it's so infuriating because it is time for the
[02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:47.560]  veil to be lifted it's time for people to wake up and see that they are being

[02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:33.200]  by the way there's a big internal debate going on I actually had Rob do come in
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:38.120]  here I had Richard say to me you're not really gonna spoil Star Wars today and I
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:42.880]  have it here in my stack well when the Philadelphia police start talking about
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:46.360]  arresting people if they do even if you see the movie or don't talk about it
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:51.120]  walking out I'm gonna protest this police state with checkpoints out front
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:55.320]  searching people and saying don't bring toy guns I mean again they take this
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:59.280]  American icon if you have no culture so it's our new archetype they admit they
[02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:04.280]  wrote it off of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell to be the new narrative of our
[02:25:04.280 --> 02:25:09.840]  culture and it's not our culture folks it's a movie I'm not even mad at
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:12.960]  everybody I get getting into height but it's like when iPads were first coming
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:17.320]  out I mean now nobody cares about an iPad you know big deal it was like oh the
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:21.360]  worshipfulness and we got one of the first ones the first day I drilled it I
[02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:25.960]  killed it to say humans are important not machines and it was all over CNN you
[02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:30.160]  name it and literally I had crew members good folks not these guys the other
[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:33.960]  guys good to getting upset about destroying good equipment but they
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:41.800]  wouldn't it's humans made it it's mine I paid for it so so the issue here is
[02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:45.600]  that the real world's going on all around us and I'm not mad it's an
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:50.080]  illustration though that I wish losing our rights and the Second Amendment and
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:56.000]  kids being you know enslaved in this child sex trade was as important as the
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:59.840]  new Star Wars movie with all the screwy actors Leigh Andy have any comments on
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:04.720]  this I agree with you and there's a lot of articles out how this just kind of
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:08.600]  pointing out how the Star Wars plot is frighteningly similar to what's going on
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:11.320]  in modern-day America so you're absolutely right yeah that's right and
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:14.960]  then Richard and do don't get to respond now I'm getting sarcastic I love them I
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:19.360]  totally get it look I want to go see it to my son wants to go see it do's taking
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:24.480]  him because I'm not going to work to do but it do son of my son or friends but
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:26.840]  we probably have them in we probably coming here when do's in here in the
[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:29.920]  fourth hour debate this but Richard do you want to comment now that I brought
[02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:39.320]  this up what I'll say is it's probably the biggest movie of the decade no no no
[02:26:39.320 --> 02:26:45.400]  you will die in art filmmaking is an art and I appreciate filmmaking is an art
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:50.560]  good and I really want to see it good good yeah you need to issue a trigger
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:54.240]  warning for but there are levels of importance and I understand how it's
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:59.000]  not that significant compared to what's going on in our no I get it and that's
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.880]  the total argument that's fair I know it doesn't matter I know it's stupid but
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:06.800]  it's my little fun thing my hobby I wanted so I don't want to ruin my
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:12.280]  enjoyment my R&R and I 100% agree within you're absolutely in the right he gets
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:15.000]  it and I understand that and that's totally reasonable don't tell me this
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:18.440]  book of the next book came out I want to read it don't tell me I totally get it
[02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:23.040]  but as long as you compartmentalize it as entertainment and not your God now
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:27.760]  you're not idolizing good point but Rob do I told him get me more spoilers to
[02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:30.720]  check my spoiler info and he said I had someone else to it I'm not doing it
[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:36.560]  because Rob do is a Star Wars nerd yeah gave me a Star Wars Star Wars sweater
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:40.080]  last year but is he one of the more than a thousand people that have joined
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:45.960]  officially the religion of the Jedi no I didn't know that that's real and he's
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:51.920]  not every single Jedi including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi is now an enemy of
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:28:00.680]  the Republic I guess I don't how dare you say you're gonna spoil Star Wars
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:06.720]  evacuate in a moment of triumph I think you underestimate their chances see now

[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:19.880]  quote any movie I've seen a few times the truth is folks I'm not gay but I'm gonna
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:22.600]  make an announcement here that's actually an admission I got a crush on
[02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:29.720]  Emperor Palpatine the gay fish the gay fish that's actually his codename fish
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:35.400]  take fish tank man not gonna do I don't know what's going on today but I worked

[02:30:31.080 --> 02:30:35.480]  it harder to repeal Obamacare and a cyber security bill has even been hacked

[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:36.800]  know Hillary's been fighting with Obama they almost ran Biden against Hillary
[02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:41.800]  and Obama and Hillary fought with each other a lot in the campaign back in
[02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:49.800]  2008 they have released actually CNN has released footage shocking footage of
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:58.000]  Obama battling with Hillary verbally in a debate privately with some fundraisers
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:02.480]  only about 10 fundraisers in the room just a few weeks ago this footage has
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:07.760]  never before been seen it is shocking well just to see Hillary with her makeup
[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:13.360]  off this is a video in the room so this was from a security camera this is
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:15.640]  breaking news ladies and gentlemen here it is

[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:38.720]  these graphics this is getting really ridiculous is they've been doing something
[02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:43.720]  secret back there and is that what this is okay I'm a reform Star Wars nerd I
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:47.480]  admit it I apologize make sure you can see this at info wars.com forward slash
[02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:50.960]  show all right Richard Reeves is with us for the Balancing Hour with Leanne
[02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:56.280]  McAdoo and I want to now go to Iowa City Iowa where you know some of the key
[02:35:56.280 --> 02:35:59.400]  first primaries are coming up and Richard Reeves often on throughout the
[02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:03.400]  whole campaign season will be at the DNC RNC I'll probably go to but Richard
[02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:06.240]  Reeves has got some folks on the street to give us their view on what's
[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:10.280]  happening but first give us your view on following Hillary following some of the
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:15.720]  other candidates Richard Reeves for info wars.com thank you Alex and yes
[02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:19.840]  yesterday I did catch my first live Hillary Clinton event and you were
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:23.680]  talking earlier in the show how you pulled back the curtain and gives the
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:27.040]  inside baseball on what's really going on so I'd like to give the folks out
[02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:30.840]  there a little bit inside baseball how these live events really happened
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:35.520]  basically you do go through almost airport level style security but the
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:38.760]  difference is you don't have a bag to check in to go to your ultimate
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:43.040]  destination the event itself you can't even take in a monopod basically you're
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:47.040]  gonna be able to take in your car keys coins wallet and your smartphone that's
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:51.760]  it so these are very controlled events and when it does come to press
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:57.480]  credentialed media they're basically relegated to a dais a long way away from
[02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:01.480]  Hillary Clinton or the candidates and are not able to really ask questions and
[02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:06.960]  my suspicion actually is that they actually vet people before they even do
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:10.080]  ask questions there were only about a four or five there were only about four
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:13.160]  or five people that got to ask questions at all and I think they were
[02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:16.560]  probably by the way 2008 it came out that they were running people's license
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:20.040]  plates even and stopping folks coming in who even had tickets and were vetting
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:23.560]  everyone and had stage questions so that's been confirmed it's been confirmed
[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:27.120]  that in the White House press corps they have to submit the questions beforehand
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:31.000]  that's right and I'm sure that was going on there because they had a couple
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:35.880]  people roaming around looking for people to ask questions etc so yes the
[02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:39.360]  inside baseball on that is highly controlled so I think what it is is up
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:43.360]  to info warriors to just go to these events you had the the biggest live
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:47.240]  human intelligence network on this planet Alex so the info warriors should
[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:50.680]  just go to these events and that way they can get some good cogent questions
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:54.640]  designed to get insightful answers out of Hillary Clinton so we can really
[02:37:54.640 --> 02:37:58.640]  expose her for what she is absolutely I know I know ten minutes ago when you
[02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:00.760]  were getting ready you had a few folks wanted to talk are they still out there
[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:05.880]  I do have Greg here he's a millennial 20 years old Greg come on in the shot he
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:09.160]  tells me here since there's not an NFL team in Iowa that they're kind of split
[02:38:09.160 --> 02:38:14.920]  between the Packers Vikings and Bears hello Greg go back go I want to ask him
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:20.880]  this what is his overall view of the 2016 election who does he like what's
[02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:25.520]  your overall overall view of the 2016 election so far who do you like I you
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:30.840]  know the election it's tough to sort through all the candidates right now I'd
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:35.320]  say I I'm looking for someone who's been consistent through their political
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:38.640]  career someone with integrity and who's going to stand up for things they
[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:44.440]  believe in is that senator Palpatine so would that be senator Palpatine yeah
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:48.640]  yeah that would be interesting I mean so are you more pumped up about the
[02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:52.480]  Star Wars movie coming out or about the election coming up I you know the
[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:55.360]  election is going to do something real in everyone's life so probably the
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:59.800]  election good I wanted to see if okay so so ask him who does who does he like
[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:04.640]  best but you like best and pull it down to I mean who are you liking on what
[02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:09.600]  side what party tell us John Kasich on the Republican side Bernie Sanders on
[02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:13.840]  the Democratic side oh my gosh so let me ask you a question so he likes it when
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:17.880]  Kasich talks about giving Russia a bloody nose so do you like it when that
[02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:22.160]  there's talk about John Kasich giving Russia a bloody nose given Russia a
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:25.560]  bloody nose yeah in the last debate that's what he said or recently said
[02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:30.760]  that yeah you know I'd be in foreign policy it's a difficult thing to play
[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:35.160]  Russia overall I think we need to understand that they're they're gonna
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:42.160]  be our friend they're they're being they're being aggressive right now which
[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:46.840]  I mean you got to talk them down how would a bloody nose work into that I
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:51.120]  mean I didn't watch the most recent Republican debate probably look stupid
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:54.200]  but you know you don't look stupid let me ask him this question says he don't
[02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:58.800]  look stupid thanks Alex ask him he knows that Bernie Sanders killed the Audit
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:01.720]  the Federal Reserve Bill protect the slime banks it's about okay
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:06.640]  reasonable missus you know that Bernie Sanders killed what was it Alex about
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:11.400]  at the Fed bill audit that help Bernie Sandals killed the Audit the Fed bill
[02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:15.480]  what do you say about that I like that drip I know the thing you got to enjoy
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:19.320]  about Bernie Sanders is the guy wants to bring people together he wants to be
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:24.600]  honest he stood on his same pillars through his entire political career so I
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:27.800]  mean that's what I look for in a candidate no he's an absolute Judas
[02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:30.280]  Coase stab romp on the back of the exact correct moment
[02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:34.520]  he should probably take economics next much a jusco that's just stabbing
[02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:38.440]  people in the back and selling out the people he's not really there he voted
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:41.560]  against all of the Fed bill which that's one of the biggest enemies that we have
[02:40:41.560 --> 02:40:47.360]  is the Fed pumping up and just limitless money into the economy so we're
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:52.120]  talking about like an expansionary money policy right well I mean it's been
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:56.440]  proven through time that we can take action through the Fed to help global
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:41:01.080]  crisis is in the financial sector macroeconomics so we need to have bail
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:04.800]  in a trillions of dollars in the mega banks again right I understand so it
[02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:08.440]  doesn't matter they were the big bail ins and bailouts for the big banks and
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:13.760]  meanwhile the people the middle-in-class middle-coming class people have less
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:17.040]  money well I mean I think you'd find Bernie Sanders is fighting for the
[02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:21.800]  middle class at the same time if you talk to any economist ask them about what
[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:24.840]  you think would happen if we hadn't built out the banks we're looking at a
[02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:28.200]  credit crisis where no one would be able to get loans all of a sudden more
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:32.920]  good now we're in the same spot with bigger than ever to take and now
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:36.280]  potentially we've got a bigger bubble than ever and in the same spot with more
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:40.280]  derivatives so potentially they just saved off that crisis that you're talking
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:44.720]  about are they not well I mean the action following the bill hasn't been as
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:50.200]  much as you would like to see obviously the banks are huge now too big to fail
[02:41:50.200 --> 02:42:00.640]  too big to fail too big to exist hold on just a minute this guy is a
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:04.440]  perfect example of what I call a useful idiot and I don't mean that to be mean
[02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:07.080]  to him but these people are praying on him so I'll just talk straight to him
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:10.720]  something never had in his life and just reviewers of this exhibit here on
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:15.640]  screen he's just parroting establishment talking points to the tee and
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:20.440]  there's no use probably talking to him at this point he just doesn't get it he
[02:42:20.440 --> 02:42:23.120]  doesn't know we have a predatory globalist establishment that's hijacked
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:27.360]  the country that you know has written hundreds of books admitting they put
[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:31.280]  fluoride in the water to brain damages asking me if he thinks we have any
[02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:34.280]  predators in the government and if he historically thinks the state is the
[02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:38.640]  answer Richard and I think that'll give us all the answers we need Greg one last
[02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:42.800]  question do you think we have any predators in the government and that
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:46.840]  the establishment is out there to help or hurt us as in do I think the
[02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:51.360]  government's working for us or against us basically yeah you know I mean there's
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:55.200]  certain types of people everywhere I think the government overall is a decent
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:59.680]  institution asking where he what his profession is student or what is what
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:03.760]  is your profession right now my profession well I'm a college student
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:10.320]  studying accounting and I also work as a bartender at a restaurant so yeah so he's
[02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:14.400]  clearly very educated it's just that he's I mean I even feel bad he can't hear
[02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:18.320]  me say this we'll watch it on YouTube later I mean just the helplessness and
[02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:21.960]  I guarantee it's been weeks with him showing him all the proof and it's just
[02:43:21.960 --> 02:43:26.720]  well you've got to undo all of that programming that he's but he yeah and
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:30.320]  that's the thing that's so frightening your thing he he is intelligent I mean
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:35.040]  clearly he can hold a good he can parrot right but he's probably not dumb he just
[02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:38.400]  thinks it's smart to parrot what they're saying right exactly cuz he's learned
[02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:43.960]  well asking me if he knows that the Bush family reportedly has a large portion
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:48.280]  of the Nazi horde I'm sorry Greg Greg took off so we're not able to ask him
[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:50.920]  that question he'd probably have a conspiracy theory I was asking about
[02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:54.720]  fluoride say that's not true Rachel Maddow wrote an editorial Richard that
[02:43:54.720 --> 02:43:59.720]  last time I checked was in 300 plus newspapers and I mean Chicago Tribune I
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:05.560]  mean the biggest papers in the country Washington Post guys type in Alex Jones
[02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:09.760]  and click Google news I meant to send us to you last night it was hundreds of
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:14.520]  hundreds of articles with her saying a bunch of things I don't believe and I
[02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:19.680]  didn't say yet again that I believe space aliens run the planet right that I
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:23.120]  believe tornadoes are being sent by the government you know when I said they have
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:26.160]  weather modification they admit they do I didn't say they sent a particular
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:31.720]  tornado but but who are they countering in hundreds of newspapers us and just
[02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:34.320]  type in Alex Jones you'll see the Rachel Maddow I mean you're talking
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:37.680]  hundreds of articles well hundreds of places her article was published here's
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:41.360]  what was interesting there were several hundred others I spent like 30 minutes
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:44.920]  last night looking at this several hundred others that were basically carbon
[02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:49.960]  copies written by other people the same day so the word went out probably a week
[02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:54.920]  ago they had their article come out and it was in let's not exaggerate 300 or so
[02:44:54.920 --> 02:45:00.320]  with her and 300 or more from other people saying the same thing so see
[02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:07.040]  organized enemy firing lie torpedoes and an info war at us why is the Death Star
[02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:11.840]  firing on info wars because we are slaughtering them with the truth we are
[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:16.520]  blasting them to daylights that's the real war not little Hollywood wimps and
[02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:22.520]  stormtrooper out there I mean this is pure bull folks there's a real war going
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:27.120]  on they put cancer viruses in your vaccines everyone I know has family or
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:30.400]  themselves that took vaccines that almost killed them but then they get on the
[02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:32.880]  news and say there's no adverse reactions no problems
[02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:36.720]  Leanne I'm ranting here but what do you have to say well I just you know that's
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:40.480]  the job of the mainstream media and that's evident to why journalism and
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:43.880]  and jobs like that are going to the wayside because they don't need them
[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:47.240]  anymore because all you have to do is just get your little talking point print
[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:50.920]  out and then the little robot comes out and tells you everything you need to
[02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:55.200]  know and it's reprinted en masse all throughout the globe if you're informed
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:59.880]  repeat what Rachel Maddow says who's your really intellectual only use what
[02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:04.720]  words and language she says this week the new word is Darth Vader he's racist
[02:46:04.720 --> 02:46:09.320]  Melissa Harris Perry said so she's not a scientific warfare expert from the
[02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:13.360]  foundations running major universities dedicated to scrambling young people's
[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:18.500]  brains into subservient regurgitating minions no she's well it's a Harris
[02:46:18.500 --> 02:46:25.920]  Perry yes sir Richard go ahead okay yeah I'm trying to round up another
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:33.200]  interview but you know I've been watching Donald Trump a lot and I think he is a
[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:38.120]  master of human psychology I think without even being president we're seeing
[02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:42.320]  him impact things on a global scale we're seeing him impact the relationship
[02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:45.720]  between the United States and Russia we're seeing him impact the economy
[02:46:45.720 --> 02:46:49.800]  already and I think even on the immigration issue we're seeing an impact
[02:46:49.800 --> 02:46:54.360]  with him just talking the hard line on immigration I can almost guarantee that
[02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:58.000]  we're seeing less illegal immigration already happening because those folks
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:01.600]  got to know that if Donald Trump becomes president he that they will have to go
[02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:04.680]  out well sure and we've got to check who comes and they can't just get free
[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:09.200]  welfare right away duh nobody else does that and they try to say it's but
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:12.920]  Richard you were up here foaming at the mouth figuratively not like me but
[02:47:12.920 --> 02:47:16.760]  almost as bad but it's the delegates they're gonna steal the delegates you
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:20.000]  know it's gonna happen and and and it's Jeb Bush and they run them because you've
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.720]  been a delegate yourself you'll be a delegate this time you're a precinct
[02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:25.360]  chairman all that stuff you know down with the grassroots as a political
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:28.600]  analyst you get a clear shot at what's happening but man right after you said
[02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:31.600]  that all these articles came out saying basically the same thing and Jeb
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:35.440]  bragging that I don't care if I get one percent of the vote I will control the
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:40.480]  Republican delegates right I'm king I'm God and then all his quotes to Trump you
[02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:43.760]  will not be president I want to talk to this next person but I want to get your
[02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:49.000]  take on that and Lee and Macadish well that is exactly it I mean that that
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:52.960]  quote by Bush here recently where he says I will guarantee that Trump will not be
[02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:56.880]  the nominee and then you made that commentary the other day about how at the
[02:47:56.880 --> 02:48:01.960]  debate that Jeb Bush was acting kind of mobsterish saying that hey you're not
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:06.560]  gonna be the nominee by being belligerent or acting bombastically so
[02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:10.840]  yes I definitely think the wheels are in motion but also a very powerful thing
[02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:14.720]  that you that I've learned from you is that when you expose these things that's
[02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:19.520]  all that's a big way in trying to expose one focal point you're absolutely
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:21.920]  right Richard I want to get some other things out there and talk to this
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:25.320]  person who just walked up to you but Lee and Macadish your take on what he's
[02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:28.760]  saying well it's absolutely right because you're not gonna learn about how
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:32.080]  the delegate thing works unless you come here to info wars and it is so
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:36.320]  important and that is one way how we the people how you out there can empower
[02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:39.720]  yourself and make sure that we're gonna get someone in there that's actually
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:44.120]  gonna do their job but it but people have to understand how this deck is
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:48.080]  stacked I mean just look at the Democratic debates there's only six of them
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:52.760]  and they keep scheduling them on days when no one is going to watch and it's
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:55.920]  it's stacked that way so people should vote against Hillary just because it's
[02:48:55.920 --> 02:49:01.160]  obviously rigged it's obviously rigged on both and it's rigged for Bush I mean
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:04.840]  Soros is in the famous Nazi collaborator the family metal their money with
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:08.120]  the Nazis I mean you know my grandfather's fight World War two for
[02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:11.720]  nothing and almost both get killed so much a scum and run around a Eddie
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:16.280]  Haskell Nazi absolutely Lee and and it'll be very interesting to find out if
[02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:20.040]  you do get a chance to ask Hillary a question you know in this debate since
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:25.560]  now it's after we've had our first Richard ISIS attack on the country will
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:29.480]  they actually say radical Islam this time absolutely let's go back to Richard
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:33.040]  as I hear him talking Richard you know I made the point that Trump's ace of
[02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:37.320]  spades is leaving the campaign and we'll talk about this after the break but
[02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:41.920]  talk to this voter but leaving the campaign if they block him out or
[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:45.560]  show the delegates he has no choice I will not vote for Hillary or jab I will
[02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:49.240]  support that third-party run we he's got to get the libertarians primed and
[02:49:49.240 --> 02:49:53.320]  ready for him to come in if they pull that shenanigan but Richard who's this
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:57.640]  fellow you're talking to okay Alex we have Rob here he looks like a student
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:50:02.280]  Rob tell sir you stood yes I'm a senior who do you like who do you like in the

[02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:19.200]  political views he had a good debate on CNN the other night what
[02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:26.720]  are some of the specific views that you like specific views well anything that
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:31.200]  doesn't have to do with what Donald Trump believes I think he's really just
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:36.480]  putting himself in a hole and so you don't like Donald Trump so you don't
[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:39.600]  like Donald Trump why you specifically why do you not like Donald Trump what
[02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:44.400]  about a Donald Trump do you not like yeah I just the belief he has of the

[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:15.400]  media now limbaugh was talking about a 30 years ago that most college degrees
[02:54:15.400 --> 02:54:20.440]  are worth it's not engineering if it's not science you can use it for toilet
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:25.080]  paper you've got all these young victims spending 30 50 grand a year to get

[02:54:29.320 --> 02:54:31.880]  this guy thinks his degrees are gonna be worse but I'm not being mean he's just a
[02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:36.320]  victim so I shouldn't make fun of him but calling Donald Trump a Nazi when the
[02:54:36.320 --> 02:54:40.440]  radical Muslims aided Hitler and and you know all of this asking me if he knows
[02:54:40.440 --> 02:54:44.920]  that Jimmy Carter banned Iranians from coming into the country and deported
[02:54:44.920 --> 02:54:50.280]  them during the hostage crisis asked the student that Richard Reeves Rob do
[02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:54.300]  know that Jimmy Carter banned Muslims from coming here from Iran during the
[02:54:54.300 --> 02:54:58.160]  Iranian crisis back in the 80s I did not know that I'm a little too young for
[02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:02.800]  that but why is he calling Trump a Nazi then I mean is Jimmy Carter a Nazi too
[02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:07.440]  young to know about the Jimmy Carter Nazi why is Trump a nuts well I wouldn't
[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:10.560]  say he's a Nazi I wouldn't say Donald Trump's a Nazi either somebody did you
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:17.320]  know didn't you to have something maybe similar to that and I don't think
[02:55:17.320 --> 02:55:22.840]  that's good for this country so asking should Europe take on refugees many of
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:27.640]  which are known to have been al-Qaeda ISIS fighters should Europe take on
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:34.000]  refugees many of which are known to be al-Qaeda terrorist fighters no I don't
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:39.640]  think Europe really has the grounds or you know I don't think that it should be
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:43.600]  but but they've done it and that's what Trump's trying to stop here because but
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:46.080]  that's what's happened in Europe and that's what Trump's talking about trying
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:50.040]  to stop here is because they've actually infiltrated Europe and that's why it's
[02:55:50.040 --> 02:55:54.240]  causing terrorist attacks like Paris France I think out in Europe more in
[02:55:54.240 --> 02:55:56.680]  Paris ask you me think
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:00.840]  San Bernardino was terror a little more extreme thinking the US
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:03.640]  asking the San Bernardino was terror we don't have it you don't have severe
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:07.920]  action like that yet I mean we're not not about San Bernardino battle with ISIS
[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:13.160]  Rob do you think San Bernardino was terror sorry San Bernardino California
[02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:17.640]  the attack in San Bernardino do you think that was terror attack I'm not I
[02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:21.440]  don't know enough about that to really oh my god my opinion out I'm not really
[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:26.400]  sure that was a they had asking if he agrees with Yale students that told Fox
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:30.640]  News they want to ban free speech asking of criticizing Muslims should be banned
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:38.320]  should criticizing Muslim be banned Christianity no should be banned I
[02:56:38.320 --> 02:56:43.480]  don't think criticizing Muslims but I think you know I think people need to
[02:56:43.480 --> 02:56:49.440]  have more of an open mind towards different beliefs okay asking asking
[02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:54.200]  about the the Saudi Arabian Wahhabi belief that women that come
[02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:56.440]  outside without a hood on their head should be killed that gay should have
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:56:59.800]  their heads chopped off asking we should be open about gay heads being chopped off
[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:03.200]  what do you think about the Saudi Arabian beliefs that Wahhabi Muslims
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:08.280]  believe that gays and gays heads should be chopped off and that women should
[02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:12.600]  be wearing full burqas well I don't support that at all that's not my
[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:16.200]  belief we should be open-minded yeah be open-minded we'd be open-minded about
[02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:20.320]  that I think that's wrong I'm I think there's certain limits to open well
[02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:24.560]  that's who we're bringing in boy I think that takes it a little too far well and
[02:57:24.560 --> 02:57:26.840]  that's the danger that's who we're bringing in though potentially are
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:32.640]  people that believe in that right so yeah it's arrested development folks that's
[02:57:32.640 --> 02:57:36.440]  what you're witnessing this guy's like a three-year-old kind of take away
[02:57:36.440 --> 02:57:40.600]  Lee and you think that's a manly man right there help me I'm weak different
[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:46.080]  ideas that everyone has I think you know we'll figure it out

[03:00:31.480 --> 03:00:37.000]  in iowa i believe correct that's right leon i one city iowa and today i'm
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:42.840]  not doing my frothing bulldog look today but yes i'm in iowa city it's been a
[03:00:42.840 --> 03:00:47.000]  very interesting trip so far went to hillary event as you heard earlier but
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.800]  uh one thing i want to talk about is going back to the debate
[03:00:49.800 --> 03:00:53.640]  one of the Freudian slips that occurred at the early debate
[03:00:53.640 --> 03:00:57.880]  and i believe it was george fataki he referred to donald trump as the president
[03:00:57.880 --> 03:01:01.960]  already did you hear that wow i did not hear that Freudian slip
[03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:05.320]  yeah he really is putting himself out there as the front runner he's the
[03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:10.200]  winner he's not backing down well and in fact you know i heard that
[03:01:10.200 --> 03:01:12.600]  Freudian slip i was monitoring the audio of that
[03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:15.720]  of that debate and when i heard that Freudian slip and i thought you know
[03:01:15.720 --> 03:01:19.640]  he's just saying more than he even knows because i'm here to tell you
[03:01:19.640 --> 03:01:22.920]  i think donald trump is already impacting the economy i think he's
[03:01:22.920 --> 03:01:26.600]  already impacting uh the level of illegal immigration being
[03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:30.840]  lowered and i think that uh you know the article today with
[03:01:30.840 --> 03:01:34.840]  Putin showing respect towards donald trump i think he's already having an
[03:01:34.840 --> 03:01:38.520]  impact in foreign affairs so he's not even been elected president he's not
[03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:41.720]  even the republican nominee yet we haven't even seen a primary caucus
[03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:46.840]  for a primary vote and so it's exciting to see it is very exciting to see and
[03:01:46.840 --> 03:01:49.400]  you know it's interesting that the republican
[03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:53.160]  presidential candidates have shown that they are all
[03:01:53.160 --> 03:01:56.760]  ready they're willing they've they've got an appetite for these debates
[03:01:56.760 --> 03:01:59.720]  um meanwhile on the other side you've got the democrats
[03:01:59.720 --> 03:02:03.960]  who keep they've got like six debates and they're scheduled on the weekends i
[03:02:03.960 --> 03:02:06.840]  believe the last one was scheduled when there was some big football game or
[03:02:06.840 --> 03:02:09.400]  something so they knew no one would be turning in
[03:02:09.400 --> 03:02:12.600]  yeah and then this next one is also going to be on a saturday no one's going
[03:02:12.600 --> 03:02:15.720]  to be paying any attention and they're doing this of course to
[03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:18.920]  stack the deck in favor of hillary because they don't want the other
[03:02:18.920 --> 03:02:22.360]  candidates to even get in the airtime everybody knows hillary clinton's name
[03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:25.240]  they'll probably just vote for because she's a woman
[03:02:25.240 --> 03:02:29.000]  and so you know it's pretty ridiculous and it's interesting
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:32.600]  the republicans the entire debate this last time was about
[03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:36.360]  terror you know and national security so it'll be interesting if they do that
[03:02:36.360 --> 03:02:39.640]  same thing with the with the uh democratic
[03:02:39.640 --> 03:02:43.160]  presidential candidates to see if they will actually say radical
[03:02:43.160 --> 03:02:47.560]  islam this time around now that it's well post terror attack
[03:02:47.560 --> 03:02:50.280]  leon don't hold your breath on that that's not i don't think this is going to
[03:02:50.280 --> 03:02:53.960]  happen and basically you did just did a great contrasting of the
[03:02:53.960 --> 03:02:57.480]  the way the parties are operating right now in the democratic election side
[03:02:57.480 --> 03:03:01.720]  you've got basically your classic dog and pony show going on but you know what
[03:03:01.720 --> 03:03:04.600]  we've got the the political version of
[03:03:04.600 --> 03:03:08.120]  wrestlemania going on in uh and hopefully it's not all show
[03:03:08.120 --> 03:03:11.560]  and i don't think it is all show i think we're seeing some real
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:15.480]  stuff happen real truth come out real new world order fighting
[03:03:15.480 --> 03:03:19.480]  come out right absolutely just the fact that we had two other republican
[03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:23.240]  candidates expose this uh backdoor deal there with the
[03:03:23.240 --> 03:03:26.360]  delegates and and that probably put it on the radar for
[03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:30.680]  the majority of american people going huh well how can they swing the election
[03:03:30.680 --> 03:03:33.480]  i never heard about it i thought my vote mattered
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:36.520]  you know that that was a huge blessing that happened that other day because
[03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:40.920]  uh it was last sunday on all the political talking head shows
[03:03:40.920 --> 03:03:43.960]  it was all about what is g.o.p doing they're upset they're going to talk
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:46.360]  about they're looking at seeing what they can do in the convention brokered
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:49.640]  convention uh how can we uh make the outcome not be
[03:03:49.640 --> 03:03:54.200]  donald trump is the nominee so yes uh it was really a blessing to see all that
[03:03:54.200 --> 03:03:57.720]  really blow up on the media last week and hopefully it's not just
[03:03:57.720 --> 03:04:01.240]  forgotten and should decide yeah absolutely well richard what else have
[03:04:01.240 --> 03:04:04.280]  you got we got about another minute left or so what else are you going to be

[03:08:26.200 --> 03:08:30.680]  welcome back to the alex jones show this is the fourth hour overdrive i'm lienne
[03:08:30.680 --> 03:08:34.520]  macadamia i'm about to hand over the baton to rob do in the back but i just
[03:08:34.520 --> 03:08:37.480]  wanted to kind of put an exclamation point on
[03:08:37.480 --> 03:08:41.560]  my time here with alex just letting everyone know that you know if you turn
[03:08:41.560 --> 03:08:45.080]  on cnn right now i guarantee you they're still going to be talking about this
[03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:48.840]  wall disney world putting metal detectors in their theme parks and how
[03:08:48.840 --> 03:08:52.920]  there's no credible terror threat but everyone should be very very scared
[03:08:52.920 --> 03:08:56.520]  meanwhile they're not talking about what is the real threat that's happening
[03:08:56.520 --> 03:09:00.280]  with our country right now and that is this huge
[03:09:00.280 --> 03:09:03.800]  funding spending tax break deal that's trying to be passed
[03:09:03.800 --> 03:09:07.880]  in congress today and tomorrow i'm sure obama and the senate is going to sign
[03:09:07.880 --> 03:09:12.760]  right off on it this is a one point one trillion dollar omnibus funding bill
[03:09:12.760 --> 03:09:16.440]  this is going to more than triple the number of h2b visas
[03:09:16.440 --> 03:09:20.360]  okay this is foreign workers who are seeking jobs at hotels
[03:09:20.360 --> 03:09:24.520]  theme parks ski resorts golf courses landscaping businesses
[03:09:24.520 --> 03:09:28.280]  restaurants and bars so that young college student there that was saying
[03:09:28.280 --> 03:09:32.680]  that he wanted to vote for bernie sanders you know he said he was a bartender
[03:09:32.680 --> 03:09:37.000]  right so you're basically voting and handing over your jobs
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:40.840]  one point six billion dollars to help resettle illegal immigrants here
[03:09:40.840 --> 03:09:44.040]  into the country and these are the things that they do not want to educate you on
[03:09:44.040 --> 03:09:47.240]  they clearly do not educate the youth on these things
[03:09:47.240 --> 03:09:50.600]  instead they want you to be worried about a non-credible
[03:09:50.600 --> 03:09:53.960]  terror threat and that's what they're ramming down your throat
[03:09:53.960 --> 03:09:57.080]  now i'm going to go ahead and hand the baton over to rob do i believe you want
[03:09:57.080 --> 03:10:01.560]  to talk about this uh simpering ceo martin screlly
[03:10:01.560 --> 03:10:06.760]  the sole owner of the latest wu tang album and uh also someone who
[03:10:06.760 --> 03:10:11.800]  raises the price of prescription drugs overnight right right and just listening
[03:10:11.800 --> 03:10:16.040]  to you you and alex talk about it earlier um he had a right hand man and
[03:10:16.040 --> 03:10:20.840]  his name was evan greebel so i mean they just sound like
[03:10:20.840 --> 03:10:25.480]  you know screllion greebel screllion greebel will steal your money
[03:10:25.480 --> 03:10:28.920]  um it looks like they're just doing one
[03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:33.480]  uh company that they were running retrofin they had losses of 11 million
[03:10:33.480 --> 03:10:36.920]  and and then i was reading through this other daily this daily mail article
[03:10:36.920 --> 03:10:40.520]  um they've been doing this since he was 26
[03:10:40.520 --> 03:10:44.040]  is what it looks like they have a 2.3 million judgment from leeman brothers
[03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:47.240]  which how much millions did leeman brothers steal from people
[03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:52.280]  um 700 000 that they lost from ms mb capital that they had set up and they
[03:10:52.280 --> 03:10:56.360]  ended up owing merrill lynch 7 million and the reason i point out the numbers
[03:10:56.360 --> 03:11:00.520]  that these guys were losing you know tens of millions okay that's a lot of
[03:11:00.520 --> 03:11:03.720]  money it's a lot of money but these guys are
[03:11:03.720 --> 03:11:07.000]  probably going to go to prison for a long time let's look over here at mf
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:11.160]  global just a couple years ago ordered to repay customers 1.2 billion
[03:11:11.160 --> 03:11:15.800]  that they were missing from customers accounts just gone 1.2 billion dollars
[03:11:15.800 --> 03:11:19.720]  nothing happens to don john corezine right there and then
[03:11:19.720 --> 03:11:25.480]  and look at this wakovia to settle money laundering case for 160 million
[03:11:25.480 --> 03:11:30.440]  how much were they laundering oh just 420 billion in transactions from
[03:11:30.440 --> 03:11:34.520]  mexico you know so billions of dollars is what
[03:11:34.520 --> 03:11:38.680]  the big guys do these guys are small fries they were and that's the reason
[03:11:38.680 --> 03:11:41.480]  they got popped is because they're not made men they're not skull and bones
[03:11:41.480 --> 03:11:44.200]  they don't have that pedigree uh macadoon are you still there what do you
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:46.680]  think of that yeah i just wonder who did these
[03:11:46.680 --> 03:11:49.880]  guys aggravate that they got taken down screlly and
[03:11:49.880 --> 03:11:52.760]  greebel i mean when you take a look at this i mean they
[03:11:52.760 --> 03:11:57.160]  must have really pissed off the wrong guy there and somebody made a call who
[03:11:57.160 --> 03:12:00.760]  made a call made a call because i bet the group that they run around in and
[03:12:00.760 --> 03:12:03.640]  the people like them probably thought it was great that they were overcharging
[03:12:03.640 --> 03:12:07.480]  or that they raised the price on this aides drug that people were using you
[03:12:07.480 --> 03:12:10.680]  know right as if that's never happened before exactly so it's
[03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:13.400]  ridiculous and that's really you know all i wanted to say about that is that
[03:12:13.400 --> 03:12:15.480]  the reason he got popped is because he's not
[03:12:15.480 --> 03:12:18.760]  part of the new world order he's one of these outside minions kind of in the
[03:12:18.760 --> 03:12:22.680]  outer rim to use a stowers reference sort of like a bounty hunter
[03:12:22.680 --> 03:12:26.120]  using you know his own assets and you know he got popped because he went against
[03:12:26.120 --> 03:12:28.840]  the empire right well and also he was so you
[03:12:28.840 --> 03:12:33.000]  know so many people were outraged over him raising the price of those drugs
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:37.960]  and so he was just trending on twitter um on the top of the news and in every
[03:12:37.960 --> 03:12:41.880]  arena yeah so of course they wanted to show people oh look here's some justice
[03:12:41.880 --> 03:12:44.040]  for you right right we're gonna give you we're
[03:12:44.040 --> 03:12:46.600]  going to give you this guy because you guys want him but we're not going to give
[03:12:46.600 --> 03:12:48.360]  you john cores and we're not going to give you
[03:12:48.360 --> 03:12:52.920]  you know any bankers you know who destroyed the economy in 2008 with the
[03:12:52.920 --> 03:12:55.480]  help of the politicians and we know how that goes
[03:12:55.480 --> 03:12:57.720]  now i want to turn to another story from daily mail
[03:12:57.720 --> 03:13:01.080]  uh florida professor fired for sickening sandy hook hoax theory after
[03:13:01.080 --> 03:13:05.320]  harassing a victim's family over whether their dead son ever existed
[03:13:05.320 --> 03:13:08.280]  um i'm not even going to mention the son's name the the son that they're
[03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:12.200]  referring to because we've gotten letters from this son's dad
[03:13:12.200 --> 03:13:16.520]  in the past and i mean you mentioned this kid and and this guy freaks out
[03:13:16.520 --> 03:13:20.120]  and i'll i'll say what the thing that really is the red flag about sandy hook
[03:13:20.120 --> 03:13:22.840]  and they talk about you know whether the victims died or not
[03:13:22.840 --> 03:13:26.280]  is they were running a drill right down the road the same day
[03:13:26.280 --> 03:13:30.920]  and it was about how uh you're having a mass casualty live shooter event
[03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:34.440]  and with children and then sandy hook happens the same day
[03:13:34.440 --> 03:13:37.880]  and we're supposed to believe that that is what really happened
[03:13:37.880 --> 03:13:41.400]  and you can't get any of these people to talk we've seen wolf king how big go up
[03:13:41.400 --> 03:13:44.360]  there and ask questions to be shut down repeatedly
[03:13:44.360 --> 03:13:48.040]  of he's had to take these people to court uh most recently i got an email he
[03:13:48.040 --> 03:13:52.200]  was asking uh some of these administrators like who
[03:13:52.200 --> 03:13:54.120]  were the kids who went and sang at the super bowl
[03:13:54.120 --> 03:13:57.160]  we've never heard from them again we should we should be celebrating what
[03:13:57.160 --> 03:14:00.040]  they did you know to go and do that for america and i and
[03:14:00.040 --> 03:14:03.080]  yeah let's who are those kids who went and sang at the super bowl you know it
[03:14:03.080 --> 03:14:06.680]  was just like something that happened it was part of a prop that was installed
[03:14:06.680 --> 03:14:10.680]  just like we had the the laughing dad who came out and then got into character
[03:14:10.680 --> 03:14:13.960]  and we had gene rosen running around in his blue coat
[03:14:13.960 --> 03:14:17.320]  you know at the sandy hook stinks to i haven't in three years later we still
[03:14:17.320 --> 03:14:19.640]  don't know what really happened we probably never will
[03:14:19.640 --> 03:14:23.080]  but we know for one thing it's definitely a false flag
[03:14:23.080 --> 03:14:27.160]  so we'll leave that there now getting two star wars
[03:14:27.160 --> 03:14:31.640]  alex was asking us to locate a video he did back in 2005
[03:14:31.640 --> 03:14:35.400]  and apparently the internet just can't keep up with the amount of video that
[03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:38.600]  alex puts out and we we haven't been able to find it
[03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:42.600]  we found an article that he wrote about it about episode three when it came out
[03:14:42.600 --> 03:14:46.840]  and how it relates to false flag terror but just last year when they put out the
[03:14:46.840 --> 03:14:50.680]  first force awakens trailer i did a report
[03:14:50.680 --> 03:14:53.960]  basically haunched by alex he he helped me with the outline he goes just do a
[03:14:53.960 --> 03:14:57.080]  report on how it's all false flag episode three is false flag so
[03:14:57.080 --> 03:15:00.440]  here's an excerpt from that report and then i'll tell you where you can see
[03:15:00.440 --> 03:15:05.080]  the whole thing when we get back to ensure the security and continuing
[03:15:05.080 --> 03:15:10.680]  the stability the republic will be reorganized
[03:15:10.680 --> 03:15:17.800]  into the first democratic empire for safety
[03:15:17.800 --> 03:15:23.640]  and secure society
[03:15:23.640 --> 03:15:27.000]  emperor palpatine or the emperors he is referred to by the time he was thrown
[03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:31.240]  down a reactor shaft started off as a mild-mannered senator from naboo
[03:15:31.240 --> 03:15:35.000]  he then hatched a multi-decade plan using many different alien races
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:40.040]  as his useful id 10 t's that's idiots for all you out there who don't speak
[03:15:40.040 --> 03:15:43.720]  nerd these aren't the droids you're looking for
[03:15:43.720 --> 03:15:47.640]  these aren't the droids we're looking for he secretly initiates the creation of
[03:15:47.640 --> 03:15:50.040]  two armies manages to get elected chancellor under the
[03:15:50.040 --> 03:15:55.560]  guys of a humanitarian crisis my first act with this new authority
[03:15:55.560 --> 03:15:59.880]  i will create a grand army of the republic
[03:15:59.880 --> 03:16:04.120]  to counter the increasing threats of the separatists then starts a war
[03:16:04.120 --> 03:16:07.240]  where both sides of the conflict have unlimited budgets to fight a war on
[03:16:07.240 --> 03:16:10.440]  hundreds of battle fronts thereby draining the resources of all sides
[03:16:10.440 --> 03:16:14.200]  and doing this under the nose of the jedi who just can't seem to realize that
[03:16:14.200 --> 03:16:18.440]  the guy walking and talking with them is a sith lord
[03:16:18.440 --> 03:16:25.160]  the dark side clouds everything the emperor even manages to off all of his
[03:16:25.160 --> 03:16:29.960]  commanders
[03:16:29.960 --> 03:16:33.880]  and convinces his new apprentice darth bad acting to kill all the remaining
[03:16:33.880 --> 03:16:37.560]  leaders of his confederacy so he is then the only person with total
[03:16:37.560 --> 03:16:41.000]  knowledge of his master plan
[03:16:47.720 --> 03:16:50.760]  look up the night of the long knives if you want a historical example for that
[03:16:50.760 --> 03:16:53.320]  one fast forward 18 years the supreme
[03:16:53.320 --> 03:16:57.400]  chancellor disbands his dysfunctional government in favor of a dictatorship
[03:16:57.400 --> 03:17:00.600]  i have just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council
[03:17:00.600 --> 03:17:04.680]  permanently thus completing a galaxy-wide false flag which started off
[03:17:04.680 --> 03:17:08.920]  as a seemingly small planetary trade blockade on his home planet
[03:17:08.920 --> 03:17:12.520]  so by playing off all sides against each other and creating a crisis
[03:17:12.520 --> 03:17:16.120]  which is the confederacy with the giant drone army
[03:17:16.120 --> 03:17:19.800]  he is able to pull off the hegellian dialectic by providing his own convenient
[03:17:19.800 --> 03:17:22.280]  clone army which he started creating years ago
[03:17:22.280 --> 03:17:31.400]  emperor palpatine is the perfect technocrat dictator it's treason then
[03:17:31.400 --> 03:17:36.040]  and that was definitely one of the best uh installments of the trilogy
[03:17:36.040 --> 03:17:39.560]  the third one just showing you how that whole plan
[03:17:39.560 --> 03:17:43.320]  you know kind of assumed itself at the end lian um did
[03:17:43.320 --> 03:17:48.600]  are you big star wars fan i don't even know i i am not i i'm just i'm sorry
[03:17:48.600 --> 03:17:53.800]  everyone out there i'm just not well you know there is a lot of hype around it
[03:17:53.800 --> 03:17:57.640]  and it is a big news event just with all the
[03:17:57.640 --> 03:18:01.160]  lockdowns they're doing they're searching people there's a twitter picture of
[03:18:01.160 --> 03:18:05.320]  a chubaca being searched they're not allowing people to wear makeup
[03:18:05.320 --> 03:18:09.320]  bring in lightsabers or guns i mean they're just basically trying to say
[03:18:09.320 --> 03:18:12.840]  here we're gonna pipe this thing up so much to make you want to go see it and
[03:18:12.840 --> 03:18:16.120]  get into it but you can't really get into it you kind of have to just
[03:18:16.120 --> 03:18:19.720]  become a clone and walk in like a clone and not do anything
[03:18:19.720 --> 03:18:23.240]  but act like a clone trooper you know we're not going to let you do anything
[03:18:23.240 --> 03:18:26.200]  yeah basically the plot of star wars is going to tell you everything that's
[03:18:26.200 --> 03:18:29.320]  going on with modern day america and the world but
[03:18:29.320 --> 03:18:33.480]  you know don't do anything about it exactly don't act it out and and be
[03:18:33.480 --> 03:18:36.520]  lured by that so that's really all i wanted to
[03:18:36.520 --> 03:18:40.440]  to say about that we're going to try to locate that video of alex's breakdown of
[03:18:40.440 --> 03:18:44.840]  it from 2005 and i found a windows media link that
[03:18:44.840 --> 03:18:48.600]  was dead and a quick time link that was dead and i was surprised i didn't find
[03:18:48.600 --> 03:18:51.240]  a real player link that i guess real player had already bitten the dust by
[03:18:51.240 --> 03:18:56.040]  then um anyway um leah thanks for joining me
[03:18:56.040 --> 03:18:59.480]  and thanks for passing the baton off and we will talk to you later
[03:18:59.480 --> 03:19:05.160]  have a good one bye bye so uh going to hillary clinton there is a video that
[03:19:05.160 --> 03:19:08.840]  surfaced of i guess she's at a town hall meeting and a guy asks her are you
[03:19:08.840 --> 03:19:12.600]  going to take money from fossil fuel companies
[03:19:12.600 --> 03:19:16.280]  because they're suddenly the the worst thing in the world and she she claims
[03:19:16.280 --> 03:19:18.840]  she has dementia she's donor dementia she doesn't know
[03:19:18.840 --> 03:19:23.160]  so let's roll that clip and then we'll come back and talk about it
[03:19:23.160 --> 03:19:29.240]  have both committed to not taking money from the fossil fuel industry i'd like
[03:19:29.240 --> 03:19:33.640]  to know if you'd be willing to sign a pledge that you will not take money
[03:19:33.640 --> 03:19:39.560]  from the fossil fuel industry uh it'll stop the meeting
[03:19:39.560 --> 03:19:42.760]  well i don't know that i ever have i'm not exactly one of their favorites you
[03:19:42.760 --> 03:19:45.480]  have
[03:19:45.480 --> 03:19:49.400]  certainly haven't made much of an impression on me yet
[03:19:49.400 --> 03:19:52.520]  there you go didn't make much of an impression on her and i'll have some
[03:19:52.520 --> 03:19:56.200]  comments on that when i get back and maybe a real tower plot that could be

[03:24:14.920 --> 03:24:18.120]  star wars mania has taken over the country and with that
[03:24:18.120 --> 03:24:21.560]  we have stormtrooper-like activity at all locations of the showings of people
[03:24:21.560 --> 03:24:25.240]  getting their bags searched not allowed to bring fake toy guns or light sabers
[03:24:25.240 --> 03:24:29.880]  or dress up in makeup or masks because that's the country we live in now why
[03:24:29.880 --> 03:24:36.040]  because a small band of ragtag rebels and a dusty planet on the other side of
[03:24:36.040 --> 03:24:39.800]  the world a dusty area are basically stolen the
[03:24:39.800 --> 03:24:43.480]  plans to the death star in there now and the process of trying to destroy
[03:24:43.480 --> 03:24:47.240]  western civilization that's right that's ices
[03:24:47.240 --> 03:24:51.000]  but they may be here in the united states in fact here's an article
[03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:54.840]  from the washington post i believe this is said ices sign
[03:24:54.840 --> 03:24:58.520]  held during furgeston march confuses cnn viewers and it's a it's a picture you
[03:24:58.520 --> 03:25:02.200]  guys can maybe zoom in on it right here i think it's jake tapper
[03:25:02.200 --> 03:25:06.280]  and behind them there's a guy says ices here is what he's got
[03:25:06.280 --> 03:25:09.800]  and actually we had a report from joe bigs this morning there's a bunch
[03:25:09.800 --> 03:25:15.080]  of alerts going out around missouri people getting cell phones stealing
[03:25:15.080 --> 03:25:19.080]  propane tanks and asking about dams so here's joe bigs that report and then
[03:25:19.080 --> 03:25:22.200]  i'll come back and show you the articles that go along with it
[03:25:22.200 --> 03:25:26.840]  joe bigs here with info wars dot com now we have been investigating the american
[03:25:26.840 --> 03:25:31.320]  caliphate that has been unfolding before our eyes and now we have some
[03:25:31.320 --> 03:25:35.560]  really suspicious activity that is happening in missouri now not too long
[03:25:35.560 --> 03:25:40.120]  ago a bulk amount of cell phones that are prepaid were purchased
[03:25:40.120 --> 03:25:44.840]  in a number of different areas throughout missouri and walmart locations
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:50.280]  columbia jefferson city lebanon and makin now in two cases the fbi was
[03:25:50.280 --> 03:25:55.080]  contacted i know in one of the locations 60 prepaid cell phones were
[03:25:55.080 --> 03:25:58.200]  purchased now law enforcement agencies report that the cell phones are
[03:25:58.200 --> 03:26:01.800]  potential tools in the hands of terrace one because prepaid they can't be
[03:26:01.800 --> 03:26:06.280]  traced um two they can be used as detonators for bombs
[03:26:06.280 --> 03:26:09.640]  so now we have another part of this puzzle that is uh
[03:26:09.640 --> 03:26:15.960]  here you have this right here dozens of propane tanks stolen from three
[03:26:15.960 --> 03:26:20.440]  different metro locations now this is all being reported by local news
[03:26:20.440 --> 03:26:25.320]  this is kansas city of missouri this is a another incident has some people
[03:26:25.320 --> 03:26:29.400]  wondering if we are in danger of a terrorist attack in our area a large
[03:26:29.400 --> 03:26:33.800]  number of propane tanks have been reported stolen from several locations
[03:26:33.800 --> 03:26:39.000]  and independence in lee's summit now we have this today the fbi once again has
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:41.960]  been alerted this is also from a local news source
[03:26:41.960 --> 03:26:45.720]  fbi alerted about a group of men asking about the bagnal dam
[03:26:45.720 --> 03:26:50.200]  it says police are revealing more about a report of a group of men asking about
[03:26:50.200 --> 03:26:53.800]  the bagnal dam miller county sheriff bill abott tells
[03:26:53.800 --> 03:26:57.400]  late news now it says the incident happened about two weeks ago with the
[03:26:57.400 --> 03:27:01.080]  golden corral and asajj beach the deputy was eating lunch
[03:27:01.080 --> 03:27:04.360]  and the wait staff told him about the group of men staffer said that the men
[03:27:04.360 --> 03:27:08.440]  were asking questions about the dam and they wanted to know if they could rent
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:12.040]  a boat and tour the dam now i don't know if you guys
[03:27:12.040 --> 03:27:16.200]  remember when jacari jackson and i were in furgus in missouri
[03:27:16.200 --> 03:27:21.160]  this sign was spotted all over cnn as jake tapper was reporting live isis is
[03:27:21.160 --> 03:27:26.360]  here so that leaves a question is isis in missouri and are they
[03:27:26.360 --> 03:27:29.880]  planning an attack i want to encourage each and every one of you who live in
[03:27:29.880 --> 03:27:32.440]  that missouri area if you know of any local reports
[03:27:32.440 --> 03:27:36.120]  of any more suspicious things that are popping up purchases
[03:27:36.120 --> 03:27:40.200]  things of that nature send that information to us and we can compile more
[03:27:40.200 --> 03:27:44.840]  and update our report so stay tuned for more reports info wars dot com
[03:27:44.840 --> 03:27:49.800]  i'm joe biggs and uh what the racist joe biggs did not say
[03:27:49.800 --> 03:27:53.320]  and i'm just going to go ahead and be the racist and say it fbi alerted about a
[03:27:53.320 --> 03:27:55.480]  group of men asking about bagnal dam you go down there
[03:27:55.480 --> 03:27:58.440]  the sheriff said they received a tip about a group of middle eastern men asking
[03:27:58.440 --> 03:28:02.520]  about the bagnal dam so the weight staff told the
[03:28:02.520 --> 03:28:06.280]  sheriff hey middle eastern men were asking about this dam now they're
[03:28:06.280 --> 03:28:10.200]  stolen so or bought cell phones stolen propane tanks
[03:28:10.200 --> 03:28:13.800]  could be something could be nothing who knows it could also be this they're
[03:28:13.800 --> 03:28:17.240]  they're telling the fbi this could all be being run by an fbi informant and i'll
[03:28:17.240 --> 03:28:20.760]  take you to a article from uh the new york times from
[03:28:20.760 --> 03:28:23.800]  april 28th 2012 it's up here on the screen guys
[03:28:23.800 --> 03:28:27.880]  harris plots hatched by the fbi and it talks about a series of plots
[03:28:27.880 --> 03:28:32.440]  that were being run by fbi informants and the fbi informant was getting the
[03:28:32.440 --> 03:28:35.560]  people together getting the money together getting the bombs together in
[03:28:35.560 --> 03:28:38.680]  some cases or getting the guns or whatever and getting everybody together
[03:28:38.680 --> 03:28:42.840]  and then they come get arrested so the fbi was setting up dozens of people
[03:28:42.840 --> 03:28:46.760]  in these plots so this could be another case of that but we have local law
[03:28:46.760 --> 03:28:50.440]  enforcement working with them and they're probably not in on any such plot if it
[03:28:50.440 --> 03:28:54.440]  were to exist so they could stop it in that case but
[03:28:54.440 --> 03:28:57.560]  if the fbi is left to their devices sometimes they do do these things and
[03:28:57.560 --> 03:29:01.560]  i'm definitely not a fan of that but what does this go to this leads and we
[03:29:01.560 --> 03:29:04.760]  still got a little bit of time here progressive media argues thanks to isis
[03:29:04.760 --> 03:29:08.680]  we have to consider limits on free speech and this is a tweet that came from
[03:29:08.680 --> 03:29:12.520]  slate thanks to isis we have to consider limits on free speech they
[03:29:12.520 --> 03:29:15.960]  sent this out on the 15th and uh people are responding that'll show
[03:29:15.960 --> 03:29:21.080]  them isis isis would like that wouldn't isis wait a minute what is that's
[03:29:21.080 --> 03:29:23.880]  exactly what isis wants us to do i thought that was bad
[03:29:23.880 --> 03:29:27.720]  it was last week uh oh how did your generation handle the terrorist
[03:29:27.720 --> 03:29:30.760]  threat always stripped away civil liberties of our citizens
[03:29:30.760 --> 03:29:35.640]  and uh there's some other ones that have words that we can't say on the radio

[03:29:58.600 --> 03:30:02.360]  a middle eastern woman was caught surveilling a u.s port of entry on the
[03:30:02.360 --> 03:30:06.200]  mexican border holding a sketchbook with arabic writing and drawings of the
[03:30:06.200 --> 03:30:10.760]  facility and its security system the woman has been identified as 23-year-old
[03:30:10.760 --> 03:30:15.000]  leila abdelrazok according to a customs and border patrol report obtained by
[03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:19.000]  judicial watch when federal officers asked her why she was drawing sketches of
[03:30:19.000 --> 03:30:21.640]  the facility she stated because she's never been to the

[03:37:46.440 --> 03:37:50.280]  breaking news because there's been some new developments
[03:37:50.280 --> 03:37:55.320]  now you see the title of this video obviously dealing with the fact that
[03:37:55.320 --> 03:37:58.520]  there's an investigation to the bush family and jeb bush
[03:37:58.520 --> 03:38:02.200]  to the nazis now i was one of the people that was involved
[03:38:02.200 --> 03:38:06.200]  in breaking this uh and popularizing it back in 2000
[03:38:06.200 --> 03:38:09.800]  and three and 2004 and i'm about to show you
[03:38:09.800 --> 03:38:15.400]  those articles and more but it's important to understand that the bushes
[03:38:15.400 --> 03:38:19.960]  aren't this little sweetsy cutesy family uh that you've been told they are
[03:38:19.960 --> 03:38:25.800]  george herbert walker bush is the son of prescott bush who in congressional
[03:38:25.800 --> 03:38:29.080]  hearings the mccormick dickstein committee hearings that were sealed
[03:38:29.080 --> 03:38:33.720]  and then declassified just a few decades ago and basically buried
[03:38:33.720 --> 03:38:39.960]  they were the head nazi lawyers not just for the us but for latin america and
[03:38:39.960 --> 03:38:45.480]  major nazi shipping firms and when the nazis collapsed in 1945
[03:38:45.480 --> 03:38:48.680]  they helped get the nazis 36 000 of them in the rat line
[03:38:48.680 --> 03:38:53.560]  operation paperclip out of germany idly and other areas
[03:38:53.560 --> 03:38:57.240]  now this was known but only by people like smithley butler
[03:38:57.240 --> 03:39:01.800]  who testified secretly to congress this didn't come out again until the 80s but
[03:39:01.800 --> 03:39:05.480]  it was in no publications because no one dare go to the declassified
[03:39:05.480 --> 03:39:11.640]  documents that's until people like john bucanon for the
[03:39:11.640 --> 03:39:17.960]  new hampshire gazette came out in october 10th 2003
[03:39:17.960 --> 03:39:24.200]  bush nazi linked confirmed then he came out in november bush nazi link
[03:39:24.200 --> 03:39:31.080]  continued if you move on from that point with those articles
[03:39:31.080 --> 03:39:38.200]  you then see a year later september 2004 the london guardian with the headline
[03:39:38.200 --> 03:39:42.680]  how bush's grandfather helped hitler rise to power
[03:39:42.680 --> 03:39:47.080]  notice it's broken by info wars via the gazette we had him on
[03:39:47.080 --> 03:39:51.240]  within days of this coming out uh some of the publishers
[03:39:51.240 --> 03:39:55.640]  over at some of the patriot publishing houses had also put out
[03:39:55.640 --> 03:39:59.640]  books along this line exposing it it had come out in some other congressional
[03:39:59.640 --> 03:40:03.000]  hearings as well but we're about to get into the full
[03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:07.080]  depth of all of this there's another guardian article from july of 2015 this
[03:40:07.080 --> 03:40:10.760]  was also in hundreds of other publications queen's nazi salute
[03:40:10.760 --> 03:40:15.000]  footage raises pressure on royals to open archives
[03:40:15.000 --> 03:40:18.360]  type in british royals with nazis you'll get hundreds of them with the king of
[03:40:18.360 --> 03:40:23.160]  england her uncle uh with their families they were german but
[03:40:23.160 --> 03:40:25.800]  well really actually romanian or hungarian they're actually transylvania
[03:40:25.800 --> 03:40:29.880]  they're not even german who who are the house of windsor windsor's a fake name
[03:40:29.880 --> 03:40:36.280]  they are goths sacks coberg goths uh and are directly related to their
[03:40:36.280 --> 03:40:41.560]  original lineage of vlad the impaler or the original person the legend of
[03:40:41.560 --> 03:40:46.680]  drakula the drak the dragon uh comes from you cannot
[03:40:46.680 --> 03:40:51.800]  make this level of stuff up now before i get into the
[03:40:51.800 --> 03:40:56.120]  info that's in the committee hearings and that's in the research
[03:40:56.120 --> 03:41:00.760]  here's a headline trump exposed how bush family in last night's debate on the
[03:41:00.760 --> 03:41:03.480]  15th trump exposed how bush family helped
[03:41:03.480 --> 03:41:06.920]  bin laden's escape of 9 11 while all air traffic rounded up for 9 11
[03:41:06.920 --> 03:41:10.360]  then president bush flew bin laden family out of the country
[03:41:10.360 --> 03:41:14.600]  when you had the world trade say to go people were put into planes
[03:41:14.600 --> 03:41:18.920]  that were friends family girlfriends and they were put into planes and they
[03:41:18.920 --> 03:41:21.640]  were said back for the most part to sordia arabia
[03:41:21.640 --> 03:41:25.080]  they knew what was going on they went home and they wanted to watch their
[03:41:25.080 --> 03:41:28.920]  boyfriends on television they were having breakfast that day at the car
[03:41:28.920 --> 03:41:32.600]  law group in dc bush senior and the head of the bin laden family at that
[03:41:32.600 --> 03:41:37.080]  table out of a thousand people there they are deeply involved so this shows how
[03:41:37.080 --> 03:41:40.520]  they are literally like james bond criminals now jab bush has been connected
[03:41:40.520 --> 03:41:44.840]  to all sorts of evil zapata oil to narcotics trafficking
[03:41:44.840 --> 03:41:49.880]  again his dad was made the cia director supposedly when he never been in the cia
[03:41:49.880 --> 03:41:54.040]  he of course is part of skull and bones itself a german death cult
[03:41:54.040 --> 03:41:58.040]  i'm not saying that this is a german death cult we're facing i'm not saying
[03:41:58.040 --> 03:42:01.080]  there's a germanic satanic experience conspiracy that we face
[03:42:01.080 --> 03:42:04.840]  i'm showing where this particular crime family comes from

[03:42:38.200 --> 03:42:42.360]  this is not my opinion now here's the rest of the story
[03:42:42.360 --> 03:42:45.720]  we know that they were the german's top lawyer
[03:42:45.720 --> 03:42:49.240]  we know it came out in the committees that they were hiring hiding billions of
[03:42:49.240 --> 03:42:53.720]  dollars in 1930s and 40s money in accounts
[03:42:53.720 --> 03:42:56.840]  in shipping firms in construction firms in major
[03:42:56.840 --> 03:43:03.480]  manhattan building firms in firms in houston in firms in san diego i mean
[03:43:03.480 --> 03:43:08.040]  we're talking huge global shipping concerns oil companies
[03:43:08.040 --> 03:43:11.160]  and then you wonder why the nazis were allowed to flee not to russia
[03:43:11.160 --> 03:43:16.200]  but to the us and latin america the bushes were considered too big to fail
[03:43:16.200 --> 03:43:20.360]  even though they tried to hire uh medley butler this came out in
[03:43:20.360 --> 03:43:24.120]  congressional hearings read about it to overthrow the government with a 500
[03:43:24.120 --> 03:43:27.480]  thousand man force for the nazis basically install a fascist
[03:43:27.480 --> 03:43:30.840]  dictator that's why hillard didn't take america seriously
[03:43:30.840 --> 03:43:33.880]  when they finally got busted they thought this will hurt america too bad if it
[03:43:33.880 --> 03:43:37.240]  comes out we'll make the bushes be double agents against the nazis
[03:43:37.240 --> 03:43:41.240]  we'll make the brown brother herrimans be double agents uh and
[03:43:41.240 --> 03:43:44.360]  we'll make the kennedys we're also all nazi agents it's a that's on the
[03:43:44.360 --> 03:43:49.400]  scurry channel uh that that's known this isn't known that that jfk
[03:43:49.400 --> 03:43:53.400]  his brother they weren't bad guys they got infiltrated by sex operatives
[03:43:53.400 --> 03:43:56.840]  beautiful german uh women uh they thought the germans were going to take
[03:43:56.840 --> 03:43:58.920]  over they didn't know this is in the 30s before
[03:43:58.920 --> 03:44:02.600]  hitler was a bad guy in the public he was a good guy in time magazine so i
[03:44:02.600 --> 03:44:05.320]  say the kennedys were overall bad they weren't actual
[03:44:05.320 --> 03:44:09.720]  lawyers for the nazis they were just fans of it at a certain level
[03:44:09.720 --> 03:44:15.560]  his father was uh joe kennedy senior and so they were both in fact we can put
[03:44:15.560 --> 03:44:18.680]  articles up about that once we put a more produced peace out showing you all
[03:44:18.680 --> 03:44:22.360]  these other points i'm making because it's just fascinating
[03:44:22.360 --> 03:44:25.720]  the bushes though were actually at the top of the pyramid they weren't under
[03:44:25.720 --> 03:44:28.520]  the control of sex operatives and you know joe kennedy getting letters from
[03:44:28.520 --> 03:44:32.200]  hitler and doing some business with him uh this was hard core kind of like
[03:44:32.200 --> 03:44:35.560]  george soros was a nazi collaborator helping round up jews
[03:44:35.560 --> 03:44:39.880]  and ferret the mound and infiltrate synagogues in in hungary and romanian
[03:44:39.880 --> 03:44:43.000]  other areas to round them up i mean that's true as well
[03:44:43.000 --> 03:44:46.680]  it was actually probably the happiest year of my life
[03:44:46.680 --> 03:44:51.720]  that year of german occupation for me it was a very positive experience it's a
[03:44:51.720 --> 03:44:56.360]  strange thing because you see incredible suffering around you and
[03:44:56.360 --> 03:44:59.880]  in fact you are you're in considerable danger
[03:44:59.880 --> 03:45:04.760]  yourself but you're 14 years old and you don't believe
[03:45:04.760 --> 03:45:08.680]  that it can actually touch you you have a belief in yourself
[03:45:08.680 --> 03:45:13.080]  your belief in your father it's a very happy making
[03:45:13.080 --> 03:45:17.800]  exhilarating experience so the leftists are controlled by a nazi collaborator
[03:45:17.800 --> 03:45:20.920]  and the family that says they got the delegates and don't care if donald
[03:45:20.920 --> 03:45:23.720]  trump or rand paul or ted cruise get them
[03:45:23.720 --> 03:45:28.520]  donald trump has you know talked about this jeb bush has told cn and others i
[03:45:28.520 --> 03:45:31.240]  am not going to let trump do this he will not get the nomination
[03:45:31.240 --> 03:45:34.440]  even if he gets the votes we can show you those quotes and clips
[03:45:34.440 --> 03:45:38.200]  from cnn you're a tough guy jeb and it's and we need to have a leader that is
[03:45:38.200 --> 03:45:40.920]  pretty real tough you're never going to be president of the united states by
[03:45:40.920 --> 03:45:45.000]  insulting your way to let's see i'm at 42 and you're at three so far i'm doing
[03:45:45.000 --> 03:45:49.320]  better so far i'm doing better talks about the border and i saw it and i was
[03:45:49.320 --> 03:45:52.600]  witnessed to it and so was everyone else and i was standing there
[03:45:52.600 --> 03:45:56.760]  if they come across as an act of love he's saying the same thing right now
[03:45:56.760 --> 03:46:00.520]  with radical islam and we can't have that in our country it just
[03:46:00.520 --> 03:46:04.920]  won't work we need strength governor bush donald uh you're not going to be
[03:46:04.920 --> 03:46:08.520]  able to insult your way to the presidency that's not going to happen
[03:46:08.520 --> 03:46:11.480]  and i do have the strength
[03:46:12.040 --> 03:46:15.160]  shift understand this is a very hardcore organization
[03:46:15.160 --> 03:46:21.000]  and the nazi money is estimated uh if you read in these reports in the
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:25.000]  trillions in current money hundreds of billions then gold
[03:46:25.000 --> 03:46:28.440]  diamonds artwork wired money businesses that the nazis
[03:46:28.440 --> 03:46:32.600]  invested in in mexico uh and in uh the rest of central and
[03:46:32.600 --> 03:46:35.480]  south america and again mexico had a big german
[03:46:35.480 --> 03:46:38.600]  relationship in world war one and world war two
[03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:43.560]  mexico uh got intelligence for the germans and launched a tax on texas and
[03:46:43.560 --> 03:46:48.040]  other states during world war one now again the west started world war one
[03:46:48.040 --> 03:46:51.240]  i'm not demonizing the mexicans for that it's just you need to understand there's
[03:46:51.240 --> 03:46:54.440]  a major german influence uh in mexico because the austrian
[03:46:54.440 --> 03:47:00.120]  hungarian empire uh which is germanic ran mexico for about 30 years or so
[03:47:00.120 --> 03:47:03.160]  you just look into maximillion and the rest of it they finally killed them
[03:47:03.160 --> 03:47:07.240]  so you have to understand that this is a very serious situation
[03:47:07.240 --> 03:47:11.160]  and i've given you the background i've given you a lot of pieces to this
[03:47:11.160 --> 03:47:14.520]  we don't know the amount of money they got but the word from leaks the word
[03:47:14.520 --> 03:47:17.320]  from sources the word that's come out in some of these reports and skull and
[03:47:17.320 --> 03:47:23.000]  bones is the bushes came from nowhere to be you know
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:26.360]  very close to the presidency even in prescott's time
[03:47:26.360 --> 03:47:32.760]  and having fabulous wealth and now 200 000 acre plus ranches in south america
[03:47:32.760 --> 03:47:37.160]  with military command bases and helicopter pads uh because they really
[03:47:37.160 --> 03:47:40.440]  are like james bond villains and they really are dangerous the whole
[03:47:40.440 --> 03:47:46.040]  fake week eddie haskell mr nice guy uh thing you see jeb bush putting on
[03:47:46.040 --> 03:47:49.960]  he is just that is a total act and donald trump needs to understand there's a
[03:47:49.960 --> 03:47:52.840]  reason ross perot dropped out and said the bushes have threatened to
[03:47:52.840 --> 03:47:57.320]  basically kill my family it's because that's what they did
[03:47:57.320 --> 03:48:00.280]  i'm here in texas again i have the inside baseball but that all came out at
[03:48:00.280 --> 03:48:04.040]  the time and and trump needs to know he is up against some very
[03:48:04.040 --> 03:48:07.000]  serious people whenever jeb looks at him and says you're not going to be
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:11.240]  president you understand that people need to know who these folks are it's a
[03:48:11.240 --> 03:48:14.440]  big scandal when it turns out the queen of england was a nazi
[03:48:14.440 --> 03:48:19.000]  and her uncle was well it's a big scandal here that it's never really come
[03:48:19.000 --> 03:48:22.120]  out in us press like it should and hasn't been
[03:48:22.120 --> 03:48:26.840]  investigated that the head lawyer for the nazis i mean the very
[03:48:26.840 --> 03:48:31.080]  head one who they admitted squirrel all the money away
[03:48:31.080 --> 03:48:34.360]  and who was used at the end of world war two to bring the nazis in to fight the
[03:48:34.360 --> 03:48:38.200]  russians and then help them hide their money that made a lot of u.s officials
[03:48:38.200 --> 03:48:41.400]  rich so this is this grafting on of the nazis
[03:48:41.400 --> 03:48:46.840]  into american culture and why we see so many of these fascist tactics out of
[03:48:46.840 --> 03:48:49.800]  the bush is they are rockefeller republicans
[03:48:49.800 --> 03:48:53.240]  that's what they call themselves the rockefeller's fund of the nazis as well
[03:48:53.240 --> 03:48:56.920]  it's the very same crew of people they're fascist
[03:48:56.920 --> 03:49:00.520]  and they'll use any system they can again control they'll use socialism at the
[03:49:00.520 --> 03:49:04.280]  grassroots to make you dependent and that's why jeb bush is so
[03:49:04.280 --> 03:49:07.560]  bad i will not vote for hillary or jeb bush
[03:49:07.560 --> 03:49:11.640]  they are both so evil i cannot say who's worse but the clintons do not have
[03:49:11.640 --> 03:49:16.120]  this ultra super criminal james bond background
[03:49:16.120 --> 03:49:19.480]  they're more like hillbilly tyrants that work with the bushes that ended up
[03:49:19.480 --> 03:49:23.640]  getting into the power structure they're super bad
[03:49:23.640 --> 03:49:26.120]  but i don't know who's worse i mean would republicans go to sleep of jeb
[03:49:26.120 --> 03:49:28.680]  bush got elected he can ram through stuff like his dad did
[03:49:28.680 --> 03:49:33.080]  or if hillary gets in will it wake up so many people and then we can impeach her
[03:49:33.080 --> 03:49:36.760]  i mean i don't know the pros and cons of this because i just can't support either
[03:49:36.760 --> 03:49:39.320]  one so sure ted Cruz may not be perfect donald
[03:49:39.320 --> 03:49:43.000]  trump rand paul i know who the bushes are i've been an
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:47.800]  investigative reporter and a journalist for 35 years i've worked in every major
[03:49:47.800 --> 03:49:51.720]  media market in the united states and i've written for more than a hundred
[03:49:51.720 --> 03:49:55.400]  newspapers and magazines nationally and internationally
[03:49:55.400 --> 03:50:01.800]  so last september 17th i became the first journalist in u.s history
[03:50:01.800 --> 03:50:06.200]  to go to the u.s national archives and the library of congress
[03:50:06.200 --> 03:50:10.040]  and pour over the thousands of pages of documents in
[03:50:10.040 --> 03:50:17.080]  both places to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt or any refutation of the facts
[03:50:17.080 --> 03:50:21.000]  that prescott bush the grandfather of george w bush
[03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:25.880]  and george herbert walker his maternal great grandfather for whom his daddy is
[03:50:25.880 --> 03:50:29.080]  named were nazi traders to the country who
[03:50:29.080 --> 03:50:32.360]  should have been tried for treason prescott bush
[03:50:32.360 --> 03:50:37.000]  was the grandfather of george w bush and the father
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:41.480]  of george herbert walker bush and george herbert walker bush is named for
[03:50:41.480 --> 03:50:45.480]  his father-in-law george herbert walker
[03:50:45.480 --> 03:50:51.640]  prescott bush graduated from yale in 1917 and was in skull and bones with e
[03:50:51.640 --> 03:50:55.000]  roland harrowman who was the younger brother of w
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:59.320]  avril harrowman the bush family really had nothing going they were essentially
[03:50:59.320 --> 03:51:03.080]  social climbers and opportunistic people
[03:51:03.080 --> 03:51:06.600]  at the time that prescott bush met darothy walker
[03:51:06.600 --> 03:51:10.920]  he was a tire salesman and george herbert walker
[03:51:10.920 --> 03:51:14.920]  as all fathers do when their daughter's going to marry someone
[03:51:14.920 --> 03:51:19.640]  said in his heart you know it's not it's not an appropriate thing socially that
[03:51:19.640 --> 03:51:23.640]  my daughter marry a tire salesman so he brought
[03:51:23.640 --> 03:51:27.720]  prescott bush first into brown brothers harrowman and then
[03:51:27.720 --> 03:51:32.360]  union banking corporation in actuality it was anything but a bank it was
[03:51:32.360 --> 03:51:36.600]  essentially a nazi money laundering operation that had a lot of
[03:51:36.600 --> 03:51:41.240]  tentacles into a lot of different other businesses they owned a shipping line
[03:51:41.240 --> 03:51:44.680]  called hamburg american line for example which was the first
[03:51:44.680 --> 03:51:50.840]  nazi front business seized although the line was no longer operational in 1942
[03:51:50.840 --> 03:51:55.800]  in the early 1930s it transported nazi spies into the us
[03:51:55.800 --> 03:51:59.640]  and then their promotional ads offered cash rewards
[03:51:59.640 --> 03:52:03.800]  to any american citizens who would go back on hamburg american lines and
[03:52:03.800 --> 03:52:09.000]  proselytized for hitler eight months after the us had entered the war
[03:52:09.000 --> 03:52:14.520]  the new york uh... hurl tribune ran a front page article hitler's angel has
[03:52:14.520 --> 03:52:19.160]  three million in u.s bank and it caused a major scandal
[03:52:19.160 --> 03:52:23.400]  and just rocked the world of politics brown brothers harrowman
[03:52:23.400 --> 03:52:26.600]  which george herbert walker and prescott bush were affiliated with and
[03:52:26.600 --> 03:52:30.440]  partners in uh... worked with i g farman which operated out
[03:52:30.440 --> 03:52:34.120]  schwitz prescott bush he did a number of things that
[03:52:34.120 --> 03:52:37.640]  were not only anti-american but were pro hitler
[03:52:37.640 --> 03:52:41.320]  and he did all that he could to proselytize for
[03:52:41.320 --> 03:52:44.280]  hitler and the rise of his third right because
[03:52:44.280 --> 03:52:50.200]  the largest client fritz theson of his patron wavril harrowman
[03:52:50.200 --> 03:52:53.640]  dictated what kind of behavior he would practice to
[03:52:53.640 --> 03:52:58.920]  enhance his own career so he was put on the board of directors of union banking
[03:52:58.920 --> 03:53:02.280]  corporation and he was also a shareholder
[03:53:02.280 --> 03:53:06.120]  in union banking corporation along with the role in harrowman
[03:53:06.120 --> 03:53:08.600]  but what's interesting about what the documents show
[03:53:08.600 --> 03:53:13.400]  is that they clearly state that all of the shareholders were phantom
[03:53:13.400 --> 03:53:17.720]  shareholders for fifth season and did his bidding directly
[03:53:17.720 --> 03:53:21.640]  so the point i'm making is it's not as if they bought these shares of stock
[03:53:21.640 --> 03:53:25.560]  as a passive investment to hopefully profit from the war
[03:53:25.560 --> 03:53:30.520]  they were directly doing the bidding of the individual who built the nazi war
[03:53:30.520 --> 03:53:34.680]  machine uh... some very shocking documents that i saw
[03:53:34.680 --> 03:53:39.560]  at the library of congress uh... two weeks ago on august 10th
[03:53:39.560 --> 03:53:43.720]  uh... had on august 9th excuse me had to do with the hearings of the mccormick
[03:53:43.720 --> 03:53:47.480]  dickstein committee of november 1934
[03:53:47.480 --> 03:53:53.320]  show that prescott bush and the uh... dupont family the remington family and
[03:53:53.320 --> 03:53:57.000]  jp morgan tried to overthrow the u.s government
[03:53:57.000 --> 03:54:01.880]  assassinate fdr and put a hitler style fascist state in place
[03:54:01.880 --> 03:54:06.440]  i have in my possession testimony from the mccormick dickstein committee in
[03:54:06.440 --> 03:54:11.000]  november of 1934 by one of the fascist plotters
[03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:14.600]  that they were going to follow hitlers model exactly
[03:54:14.600 --> 03:54:18.520]  and impose martial law on the united states round up
[03:54:18.520 --> 03:54:22.600]  unemployed people that were worthless to the economy and troublemakers and jews
[03:54:22.600 --> 03:54:27.640]  and put them into internment camps and their plan was if necessary
[03:54:27.640 --> 03:54:31.800]  to exterminate the people that could not be part of the effort
[03:54:31.800 --> 03:54:35.560]  the only reason the coup attempt in 1934 didn't succeed
[03:54:35.560 --> 03:54:39.240]  is that they led they hired the wrong general to lead a general smithley
[03:54:39.240 --> 03:54:43.640]  butler the great marine hero to time congressional medal of honor winner
[03:54:43.640 --> 03:54:47.800]  who worked with the plotters just long enough to be able to identify who they
[03:54:47.800 --> 03:54:51.240]  were and then blew the whistle on them to congress
[03:54:51.240 --> 03:54:56.040]  incredibly after being warned by the fbi and the justice department and the
[03:54:56.040 --> 03:54:59.720]  treasury department to cease and desist in their Nazi dealings
[03:54:59.720 --> 03:55:03.240]  they had continued them until 1951
[03:55:03.240 --> 03:55:07.480]  there had been twenty eight additional seizures of Nazi assets and Nazi
[03:55:07.480 --> 03:55:11.800]  business fronts between late 1942 and 1951
[03:55:11.800 --> 03:55:15.640]  and that they had moved Nazi assets into switzerland brazil
[03:55:15.640 --> 03:55:20.200]  argentina and Panama and they had continued to do business with their
[03:55:20.200 --> 03:55:24.360]  primary Nazi patron who was fritz fiesen who backed hitler
[03:55:24.360 --> 03:55:28.120]  beginning in 1921 and who was the wealthiest man in germany
[03:55:28.120 --> 03:55:31.480]  and a steel and coal baron who with his partner
[03:55:31.480 --> 03:55:36.360]  friedrich flick essentially built the Nazi war machine along with i.g.
[03:55:36.360 --> 03:55:41.160]  farvin in 1951 when fritz fiesen died in argentina
[03:55:41.160 --> 03:55:44.760]  union banking corporation was liquidated by the u.s. government
[03:55:44.760 --> 03:55:49.640]  and prescott bush received 1.5 million dollars for his holdings in his Nazi
[03:55:49.640 --> 03:55:53.800]  business and that was the beginning of the bush family
[03:55:53.800 --> 03:55:58.360]  fortune for all intents and purposes schwarzenegger is the son of a Nazi
[03:55:58.360 --> 03:56:01.560]  he has praised nazis he has praised hitler
[03:56:01.560 --> 03:56:06.040]  he talked last night in terms like we will not falter we will not waver we
[03:56:06.040 --> 03:56:09.880]  will win this war on terror he's a leader who doesn't flinch
[03:56:09.880 --> 03:56:15.240]  who doesn't waver and does not back down
[03:56:15.240 --> 03:56:20.280]  well that's exactly the speeches that hitler made after the Reichstag fire
[03:56:20.280 --> 03:56:23.560]  terrorism and the homeland being under attack
[03:56:23.560 --> 03:56:27.160]  are precisely the issues that hitler used to subvert
[03:56:27.160 --> 03:56:32.200]  everything within the german system of government this is a criminal regime
[03:56:32.200 --> 03:56:36.440]  they not only emulate hitler but its genesis comes from hitler
[03:56:36.440 --> 03:56:40.360]  and i defy anyone a historian journalist author
[03:56:40.360 --> 03:56:46.040]  anyone to come forward and disprove my premise that you cannot differentiate
[03:56:46.040 --> 03:56:51.000]  hitler's invasion of poland in 1939 and the Reichstag fire and his attempt to
[03:56:51.000 --> 03:56:54.600]  dominate the world from george w bush's unprovoked
[03:56:54.600 --> 03:56:58.200]  invasion of iraq and subversion of the constitution through the
[03:56:58.200 --> 03:57:03.400]  patriot act after 911 which i submit is his Reichstag fire
[03:57:03.400 --> 03:57:06.760]  carl robe and his minions are every bit
[03:57:06.760 --> 03:57:11.480]  the masters of propaganda that joseph gerbils was they literally took
[03:57:11.480 --> 03:57:17.000]  lessons from gerbils and goring about how to create such brilliant propaganda
[03:57:17.000 --> 03:57:22.360]  that unreality can become reality and reality can be subverted
[03:57:22.360 --> 03:57:27.560]  to fantasy political subterfuge right before your eyes so there's just an
[03:57:27.560 --> 03:57:31.560]  endless broken record that is leading up to
[03:57:31.560 --> 03:57:36.280]  the present era that the bush family has had a single goal for a hundred years
[03:57:36.280 --> 03:57:39.400]  which is to become the most powerful family on the planet
[03:57:39.400 --> 03:57:43.480]  and to rule the world it's critical that every citizen
[03:57:43.480 --> 03:57:49.160]  of this country rise up and do something because the day of reckoning is at hand
[03:57:49.160 --> 03:57:53.560]  and obvious people are nazis they are practicing nazi philosophy
[03:57:53.560 --> 03:57:58.840]  they are mimicking nazi tactics and time is running out
[03:57:58.840 --> 03:58:02.680]  that's right and if you don't get involved if you stand on the sidelines
[03:58:02.680 --> 03:58:06.440]  we will have another bush in the presidency
[03:58:06.440 --> 03:58:10.360]  don't forget that this has been rob do for the fourth hour of the info wars
