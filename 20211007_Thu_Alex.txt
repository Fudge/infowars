[00:00.000 --> 00:29.720]  We can't just let this information
[00:29.720 --> 00:39.800]  get lost in the mix. We can't just come on air and expose this incredible horror and then just
[00:39.800 --> 00:45.000]  have it become part of the background ambient noise. We have to let it hit us in our soul.
[00:46.280 --> 00:54.360]  We have to decide to do something about it or we'll lose our souls. It's Thursday, October 7th.
[00:54.360 --> 01:09.800]  The year is 2021 and I'm about to play for you something of pure nightmare. Viewer discretion
[01:09.800 --> 01:21.240]  is advised. Now you can debate whether this is real or not, but it is real. It's going on.
[01:21.240 --> 01:29.560]  It's happening and to any trained eye, you know it is 100% real.
[01:36.120 --> 01:37.160]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:40.680 --> 01:45.400]  it hasn't just come out what I told you years ago to the medical literature that finds their
[01:45.400 --> 01:49.800]  lies in the world so does Moderna that the vaccines are grown in the cloned tissue of
[01:49.800 --> 01:55.960]  dead babies. They call them mortal cell lines. No, that's all broken. That's all come out via
[01:56.520 --> 02:04.360]  the great folks at Project Veritas. No, it's a lot further down the rabbit hole. Here's a comment
[02:04.360 --> 02:10.680]  or Paul Revere on Twitter. That's a human pig hybrid and that's exactly what it is.
[02:10.680 --> 02:20.440]  That's a baby pig, humanoid, just born, brought forward to the camera. This isn't sweet tooth on
[02:20.440 --> 02:25.560]  Netflix or the new show Lamb, the new movie coming out, the horror movie. That's all to condition
[02:25.560 --> 02:29.320]  you. The order went out years ago to put out the human animal hybrid films so that when this
[02:29.320 --> 02:34.520]  actually rolls out, you'll be conditioned and ready to accept the horror. I told you many years ago
[02:34.520 --> 02:40.120]  about scientists I talked to. One of them died shortly after he was on the show. He didn't talk
[02:40.120 --> 02:44.840]  about this on the show. He talked about it off air with me how he saw animal human hybrids in
[02:44.840 --> 02:51.000]  underground bases more than 20 years ago now. Well, now it's not an underground basis.
[02:52.600 --> 02:56.680]  It's happening for real. I'm about to premiere the second video right now that I'm going to show you.
[02:57.880 --> 03:03.320]  Mainline news preparing you for it. Human pig hybrid created in lab. Here are the facts.
[03:03.320 --> 03:05.800]  And notice they said, oh, it just happened this year. No, it didn't.
[03:05.800 --> 03:12.280]  Human animal chimeras are gestating. That means inside the uterus on U.S. research farms.
[03:13.720 --> 03:18.600]  Technology review MIT. That's what five years ago, six years ago.
[03:19.480 --> 03:24.680]  U.S. scientists create human animal hybrids by growing human organs inside sheep and pigs.
[03:24.680 --> 03:28.600]  I worked for a large animal vet that did artificial insemination and worked on cloning
[03:28.600 --> 03:32.120]  on the top guys, top students ever with this degree from A&M.
[03:32.120 --> 03:40.040]  And I remember working there when I was 15 years old. I'm 47 now, 30 plus years ago,
[03:40.040 --> 03:44.600]  and they had cloned sheep and they had cloned cows that were being produced and sold in mass
[03:45.720 --> 03:48.520]  that then had their own babies and were mixed with other normal animals.
[03:49.320 --> 03:51.880]  You tell the average person this is going on. They don't even believe it.
[03:53.880 --> 03:56.680]  So when we come back, I'm going to show you the shocking footage
[03:57.320 --> 04:01.160]  that went up this morning and has gotten basically no attention. We tracked it back
[04:01.160 --> 04:09.880]  to its source to a farm. You can say, oh, well, that's just a horrible deformity of the pig,
[04:10.520 --> 04:15.480]  except if you look at it, it's far too simian. It actually appears to be a
[04:16.200 --> 04:21.160]  simian that is monkey or ape hybrid because they have those as well.
[04:21.160 --> 04:28.360]  They have thousands of types they admit to, including humans spliced with dolphins.
[04:28.360 --> 04:35.960]  That of course is a project, one project to the Navy. Spiders and goats that have been mixed,
[04:35.960 --> 04:41.640]  spider goats, that's a 40 year old technology. Hitler was cloning rabbits 70 plus years ago.
[04:42.840 --> 04:50.200]  We're not in Kansas anymore. We're on Earth 2021. That's really like Earth 2248.
[04:50.200 --> 04:58.600]  We'll be right back with the true horror, the biggest story ever straight ahead.
[05:00.200 --> 05:04.680]  I want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world. It's very,
[05:04.680 --> 05:09.800]  very simple, but the multiple don't know. The privately owned central banks of the world
[05:10.760 --> 05:15.800]  are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies
[05:15.800 --> 05:22.680]  and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property, energy.
[05:23.320 --> 05:29.080]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence, and in the past they created thousands of trillions
[05:29.080 --> 05:33.160]  so that they could leverage that, manipulate markets, but they never allowed that money
[05:33.720 --> 05:37.480]  to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[05:37.480 --> 05:42.200]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy,
[05:42.200 --> 05:48.120]  buying up everything, not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and
[05:48.120 --> 05:53.000]  force a collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund the only things left
[05:53.000 --> 05:57.160]  handed. This is the great reset. This is what's happening now. We're on everyone. It's the only
[05:57.160 --> 06:16.600]  way to stop it. Remember grandma and grandpa saying we don't turn things around in culture.
[06:16.600 --> 06:23.640]  Things are going to fall apart. Evil's going to take over. We're going to have a mark of the beast,
[06:23.640 --> 06:28.200]  world cashless society. They're going to have human animal clones. Now here we are 50, 60,
[06:28.200 --> 06:33.400]  70 years later and it's all happening. Thank you for joining us on this live October 7th,
[06:33.400 --> 06:38.760]  Thursday broadcast. I come to you with just incredible news and information today that's
[06:38.760 --> 06:43.400]  over the top. You know, one of the biggest criticisms of this broadcast, one of the things
[06:43.400 --> 06:51.000]  they've leveled major attacks on in the last 20 years is that I talk about chemicals in the water
[06:51.000 --> 06:57.400]  that are destroying the endocrine systems and the normal genetic imprint of reproduction,
[06:57.400 --> 07:04.120]  not just in amphibians and fish, not just in lower level mammals, but also in humans.
[07:04.920 --> 07:08.920]  And that's because it's going on and it's part of a larger operation purposely done
[07:08.920 --> 07:12.760]  in their own internal documents that have leaked. And then of course I began to discover
[07:12.760 --> 07:17.640]  when I was first on air 27, 28 years ago that listeners said, hey, you want to know what's
[07:17.640 --> 07:21.800]  really going on? They would send me a lot of internal documents, but also public documents
[07:21.800 --> 07:30.120]  from places like MIT, but also articles out of the BBC back then reporting that 20 years
[07:30.120 --> 07:35.880]  previous they had created animal human clones in test tubes and that they were beginning
[07:35.880 --> 07:40.600]  to implant them in cow uruses to grow humanoids. Now the human doesn't have any rights because
[07:40.600 --> 07:45.160]  it's not a human, it's part animal. That's how they get around animal rights and that's how
[07:45.160 --> 07:49.400]  they get around human rights because it's a new thing. It's like a synthetic drug when they
[07:49.960 --> 07:54.520]  take, say, ecstasy and make a new drug and for a while until they pass a law making it illegal,
[07:55.560 --> 08:01.080]  you can sell it in gas stations because it's new. Well, it's the same thing. So by splicing humans
[08:01.080 --> 08:07.880]  and animals, now you can say, oh, there's no fetal tissue in this vaccine because it's an
[08:07.880 --> 08:13.080]  animal monkey clone. And that's all right here in MIT and National Geographic and everything
[08:13.080 --> 08:17.960]  the last few years as they externalized what I was telling you about previously. So you weren't
[08:17.960 --> 08:24.360]  ready and brainwashed and conditioned yet to accept that 25 years ago, 26 years ago, 27 years ago.
[08:24.360 --> 08:31.560]  So people say, oh, Jones is crazy. He wasn't reading a scientific study out of MIT about
[08:31.560 --> 08:39.720]  animal human hybrids or then I got mailed after that of Time Life Books, big life magazine about
[08:39.720 --> 08:44.680]  them saying they were doing it in the 60s. So they were either lying and saying they were in the 60s
[08:44.680 --> 08:50.520]  creating humans and testives with animal DNA or they done it. But the point is, it's here now.
[08:52.520 --> 09:01.800]  So I was working out this morning at about 8am and I had a friend send me a link and saying,
[09:01.800 --> 09:06.440]  does this look real to you? And it had just gone up. I had like 1000 views. I got like 10,000 now.
[09:06.440 --> 09:11.320]  And I instantly looked at it. I know how pigs are born. I know where they're born. I know what
[09:11.320 --> 09:17.400]  computer morphing looks like, the telltale signs. I know the background, the clothing,
[09:17.400 --> 09:23.720]  the woman's fingernails, just all of it. That's how you can tell when you look for 20 feet away
[09:23.720 --> 09:28.200]  at a bowl of fruit, even with the best plastic fruit, is it real or is it fake? And you can eyeball
[09:28.200 --> 09:34.920]  it and tell your facial recognition is better than the best supercomputers. It's amazing.
[09:34.920 --> 09:39.880]  And so I looked at it and said, that's absolutely real. But whether it's real or not, and that's
[09:39.880 --> 09:47.720]  today's show headline, first video of animal human clone released. Whether this video is real or not,
[09:47.720 --> 09:52.120]  and I believe it's real, I know in my gut it's real. That's my entire intellect saying, yes, that's real.
[09:55.640 --> 10:00.200]  It is real and it is going on and they've been keeping it quiet. And I predicted a year ago
[10:00.200 --> 10:04.440]  with all the shows like Sweet Tooth and Movies Like Lamb coming out. There's more than 20 shows
[10:04.440 --> 10:07.400]  about human animal hybrids. And I talked to folks at Netflix that read the meetings
[10:08.280 --> 10:14.360]  in like three years ago at Sundance Film Festival, and they were told to come out with
[10:14.360 --> 10:19.160]  dystopic animal human clones. They weren't told, hey, to get people ready, but that's the executive
[10:19.160 --> 10:23.960]  level. I can see what's going on. I can tell you that's what was happening. And I said just a few
[10:23.960 --> 10:29.080]  years ago and a few months ago, and about 11 months ago on Joe Rogan's show, I said soon,
[10:29.080 --> 10:34.600]  they're going to announce this and show it to the world. And now it's happening. This is exactly
[10:34.600 --> 10:39.800]  how they would do it. They would just boom at one of the facilities, go ahead while all these
[10:39.800 --> 10:45.400]  movies are out and all these shows are in theaters and all the trailers are on TV for shows like Lamb,
[10:45.400 --> 10:49.640]  programs like Lamb Films. Then you see this. So I'm going to roll this footage
[10:50.840 --> 10:55.880]  for the first time exclusively to a big audience. And we're going to link the video also in the
[10:55.880 --> 11:01.080]  live show feed. Can we put the live show feed up for TV viewers? Because I want to ask TV viewers
[11:01.080 --> 11:08.280]  and radio listeners to go to infowars.com and to get the live show feed of the show
[11:10.600 --> 11:15.720]  and to share it with everyone. There it is breaking first video of animal human hybrid released.
[11:18.280 --> 11:24.280]  Click here for exclusive live feed. Go to infowars.com. Go to newswars.com. Go to
[11:24.280 --> 11:29.960]  freeworldnews.tv to the Alex Jones section. You'll find the live feed there. That's the URL to share
[11:29.960 --> 11:35.320]  because it's not as easily censored. And share it from freeworldnews.tv. Just click on the Alex Jones
[11:35.320 --> 11:40.520]  live feed section, Alex Jones area, and you'll go right to it left hand corner. But right now,
[11:40.520 --> 11:49.400]  let's go ahead and roll this footage of a barn with a human pig hybrid that they admit they've
[11:49.400 --> 11:54.360]  developed. And you could say, well, maybe it's a real pig being born and they just put this over
[11:54.360 --> 11:58.760]  its face. I've looked at it. I've looked at the fingers removing the straw from the head.
[12:00.040 --> 12:05.000]  This is somebody's phone. It's just happened. And they're filming it. This is real. That's my
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.040]  analysis. It's like, you know, you could have the fanciest sex doll in the world or
[12:10.040 --> 12:15.080]  Madame Tussaud's wax museum of Marilyn Monroe. That's not Marilyn Monroe. You know it's got
[12:15.080 --> 12:19.400]  glass eyes. Or you know it's a morph. You know, they've got the best morph systems out there now.
[12:19.400 --> 12:24.920]  You can still tell when Hollywood's fake something. Schwarzenegger, you know, reappears the Terminator
[12:24.920 --> 12:30.520]  movies as a young man. You can tell it in him. This is real in my expert research view. But
[12:30.520 --> 12:35.080]  you're an expert too. Your eyes good. We're going to show you this footage. And it's now live at
[12:35.080 --> 12:40.200]  band.videoandfreeworldnews.tv. The footage you're about to see. That suggests you get it. That
[12:40.200 --> 12:45.160]  suggests you share it. So that when people see this, it isn't through mainstream media going,
[12:45.160 --> 12:49.640]  is it real? Isn't it real? Just conditioning you so that when they openly announce what's
[12:49.640 --> 12:56.600]  happening, you're already acclimated to it. This is brainwashing. No, this is an animal, human,
[12:56.600 --> 13:01.960]  animal looks animal chimpanzee hybrid. And I've got MIT. Let me show you right here.
[13:01.960 --> 13:05.640]  National Geographic human pig hybrids right here. National Geographic.
[13:05.640 --> 13:12.440]  There's another one. Human animal chimeras are gestating. That means inside the uterus
[13:12.440 --> 13:16.200]  on U.S. research labs. Human noise inside cows, human noise inside pigs.
[13:18.440 --> 13:24.120]  All right. There's one independent showing this. All the TV viewers, there is human animal chimeras
[13:24.680 --> 13:28.520]  are gestating in U.S. research labs. And that's a man who's part sheep and part pig.
[13:28.520 --> 13:35.480]  It's all in your face. Okay. So here is the footage that I believe is real. Here it is.
[13:58.520 --> 14:13.240]  All right. Now, you notice that is in a foreign language. My point is I'm showing you news articles
[14:13.240 --> 14:18.120]  that say they're doing it in the United States. Now, if I was the globalist and I know how they
[14:18.120 --> 14:23.560]  operate, I would go in and artificially inseminate pigs when you're finally going to announce this
[14:23.560 --> 14:28.280]  on private farms so they can freak people out and watch them do this and say the earth is
[14:28.280 --> 14:33.480]  so damaged and so out of control. It's creating these mutations because of global warming. That's
[14:33.480 --> 14:38.440]  why the third world starving to death. Not from the COVID lockdown that's 100% did it. Oh, deadly
[14:38.440 --> 14:43.480]  viruses are emerging. Not because Peter Dazek and Fauci and Gates created it in a lab. We even have
[14:43.480 --> 14:47.480]  the documents proving they did. And they said they were going to release it. Total smoking gun. Oh,
[14:47.480 --> 14:52.520]  no. The news is saying it happened because you had a car or air conditioning. See, it's your fault.
[14:52.520 --> 14:56.520]  You're dying. It's your fault. There's human animal clones. It's your fault. There's deadly viruses.
[14:56.520 --> 15:01.000]  Five of them spliced together and released. All confirmed. It's your fault. There's human animal
[15:01.000 --> 15:10.040]  clones. You see that? And I'm usually good at figuring out languages. It's not Spanish. Is it
[15:10.040 --> 15:14.360]  Portuguese? We're going to figure it out. But we're all doing this together. Go to the Twitter feed
[15:14.360 --> 15:20.360]  with the guys and see what folks are saying there. But this is the reality, ladies and gentlemen. And
[15:20.360 --> 15:24.200]  this is what's going on in our world. They're really arresting preachers in the U.S. and Canada
[15:24.200 --> 15:28.520]  and Europe and Australia that try to reopen their churches. In some cases, after 500 plus days,
[15:29.480 --> 15:32.840]  they're really teaching pedophilian schools. They're really saying they're going to print a
[15:32.840 --> 15:37.160]  trillion dollar platinum coin. It's only worth a few thousand dollars and say now that they can
[15:37.160 --> 15:40.440]  create a trillion and that there's unlimited money and the feds can do whatever they want.
[15:40.440 --> 15:44.680]  That's the head of the budget committee. They're really handing the world over to Congress China.
[15:44.680 --> 15:48.680]  They're really dissolving the borders. They're really teaching critical race theory in schools
[15:48.680 --> 15:53.800]  that whites are inherently bad and are genetic mutants. They're really doing all this. It's a
[15:53.800 --> 15:59.720]  scientific mad scientist takeover. If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate
[15:59.720 --> 16:05.160]  your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this
[16:05.160 --> 16:11.560]  year. Here's why. We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock. These emergency
[16:11.560 --> 16:17.320]  backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most. And unlike gas generators,
[16:17.320 --> 16:23.240]  solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free
[16:23.240 --> 16:28.440]  electricity from the sun. Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just
[16:28.440 --> 16:32.920]  getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:33.480 --> 16:39.560]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too.

[16:56.680 --> 17:01.880]  Hey everybody. If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food,
[17:01.880 --> 17:06.440]  I've got great news. In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while. Here's the thing.
[17:06.440 --> 17:13.080]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans. These beans are
[17:13.080 --> 17:18.920]  gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans
[17:18.920 --> 17:25.560]  in the entire world. The best part? We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know
[17:25.560 --> 17:30.680]  higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[17:30.680 --> 17:35.720]  It gets even better. With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being,
[17:35.720 --> 17:41.640]  I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood
[17:41.640 --> 17:48.200]  in the world, period. Go to soupbeansurvival.com. That's soupbeansurvival.com and discover the
[17:48.200 --> 17:55.400]  real reason we're getting this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com at soupbeansurvival.com.
[18:18.440 --> 18:25.160]  we have I would say knock out rocket rest both great comes in pill form this is the liquid tincture
[18:25.160 --> 18:30.920]  and I think this is probably the most powerful one survival shield x2 nascent iodine this is if
[18:30.920 --> 18:35.320]  you haven't done an iodine challenge yet you have you haven't done the iodine challenge what are you
[18:35.320 --> 18:42.040]  waiting for now is the time super male and super female vitality living defense plus and the organic
[18:42.040 --> 18:47.400]  greens fiber caps we have a limited supply of these right now but we want to sell them all out
[18:47.400 --> 18:51.720]  so we can order a new batch it was very popular the organic greens fiber caps but we have all
[18:51.720 --> 18:57.720]  kinds of other great supplements that are great for so many different things take advantage of
[18:57.720 --> 19:02.600]  those the average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's
[19:02.600 --> 19:08.520]  a war between three individuals and nation states on one side and the globalists on the other
[19:08.520 --> 19:13.800]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world for the united states of brazil and of
[19:13.800 --> 19:18.920]  course triggered by the briggs in the uk nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist
[19:18.920 --> 19:24.040]  world government that's why they launched their great recess and their program after collapsing us
[19:24.760 --> 19:32.360]  of build back better this is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.640]  because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left which is the
[19:37.640 --> 19:44.120]  ideology of this world government system couldn't win they released a biological weapon on us now
[19:44.120 --> 19:49.400]  we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago it's that simple they can't be
[19:49.400 --> 19:54.680]  just because of our free speech and our guns so the global corporate combine released COVID-19
[19:54.680 --> 19:57.720]  and you know the rest of history expose this paradigm and we win
[19:57.720 --> 20:04.200]  then you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:15.080 --> 20:21.080]  the language is spanish he's saying maronito meaning a little pig and then he says person human
[20:22.840 --> 20:25.800]  we're gonna play the club for you again right now and alex jones your host and
[20:25.800 --> 20:33.720]  then more images and video is emerging around the world of human like pigs or monkey like pigs
[20:33.720 --> 20:38.040]  in china not just in mexico where we now know this video came from
[20:41.240 --> 20:44.520]  true horror ladies and gentlemen here's another one of the humanized pigs
[20:45.080 --> 20:49.320]  now they're gonna say that's a natural mutation this stuff this stuff's not been recorded before
[20:49.320 --> 20:55.720]  why is it happening now oh right while human pig hybrid created in lab here are the facts
[20:58.040 --> 21:03.400]  now there's a very mutinogenic factor to this and that's it's also been found in major studies
[21:03.400 --> 21:07.240]  the hundreds monkey syndrome is it's one of the well documented ones where you can have monkeys
[21:09.080 --> 21:14.840]  that don't know how to break open a papaya or a coconut that have been introduced on one island
[21:14.840 --> 21:19.480]  but have the coconuts and the other monkeys on another island 20 miles away will show no interest
[21:20.120 --> 21:24.760]  in the papayas or in the coconuts or whatever they're breaking into until the other monkeys
[21:24.760 --> 21:29.240]  take a few years to figure out how to break into it and suddenly when they figure out within days
[21:29.240 --> 21:35.960]  the others have a jump and know how to break it open themselves it's documented it's an electromagnetic
[21:35.960 --> 21:44.520]  six cents internet that we call spiritual but it's really electrochemical it's real it's been documented
[21:45.800 --> 21:50.840]  and so could it be that because they're doing all this cloning and all this shedding engineering
[21:50.840 --> 21:57.160]  that because these creatures are transmitting just like geese know how to read the magnetic lines
[21:57.160 --> 22:03.080]  of the earth and fly 5 000 miles or 3 000 miles and hummingbirds can fly 4 000 miles and butterflies
[22:03.080 --> 22:07.400]  can fly 3 000 4 000 miles monarchs from canada all the way down to mexico
[22:09.960 --> 22:15.160]  well they they are picking up the electromagnetic systems of other animals other plants and the
[22:15.160 --> 22:21.000]  earth and the sun and the moon this is all known now this isn't mumbo jumbo the ancients all knew
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.720]  it but they tried to figure it out in their own way and ascribed it to you know mythical secret
[22:25.720 --> 22:29.720]  unseen things but they couldn't see it well we now know you can't see a cell phone radiation
[22:29.720 --> 22:34.840]  can't see a microwave radiation can't see the radiation your microwave but you put a fork in
[22:34.840 --> 22:39.240]  there hit the button you're gonna see something you're gonna see those wavelengths going through
[22:39.240 --> 22:45.160]  and hitting that metal and having an explosive reaction and you put a baby in that microwave
[22:45.160 --> 22:50.360]  like a lot of crazy crackhead women do i bet two different groups of cops in the united states that
[22:51.320 --> 22:55.640]  went on calls where crackhead women put babies in microwaves and you can't see the microwaves
[22:55.640 --> 23:00.120]  hitting the baby but it's happening because i can't see the microwave radiation come out of a
[23:00.120 --> 23:05.480]  cell phone but it's made those type of brain tumors go up more than 10 000 in the last 20 years
[23:05.480 --> 23:08.120]  and the doctors always know it's what side of the head you put the phone to
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.440]  remember that just keeping it a few feet away will probably save your life you go why
[23:14.440 --> 23:17.880]  because however long the antenna is engineers will tell you and this is a
[23:17.880 --> 23:22.360]  destination stupid way of saying it it varies systems of system but however long the antenna is
[23:22.360 --> 23:30.760]  every every length out of the wavelength from the length of the antenna it cuts in power by half
[23:30.760 --> 23:34.680]  so when you're right up against your skull it's all going right in through your brain and it's
[23:34.680 --> 23:41.960]  actually inducting into your bone and into your brain and that's why their studies out 30 years
[23:41.960 --> 23:46.760]  ago that the first big cell phones out would quote heat the brain up to two degrees look it up
[23:46.760 --> 23:55.240]  up so just a side issue here we are in the year 2021 and and the senate we put this on
[23:55.240 --> 24:02.600]  screen remember four months ago the u.s senate headline u.s senate refuses to ban certain types
[24:02.600 --> 24:10.600]  of animal human hybrids senate kills g.o.p legislation prohibits certain human animal hybrids
[24:10.600 --> 24:17.880]  chimeras forbs and i said four months ago let's see my memory serves how long ago was that
[24:21.240 --> 24:25.160]  was it four months ago i think it was four months ago let's see my memory serves the point is that's
[24:25.960 --> 24:29.800]  where our country is and that's what's going on taxpayer monies for this
[24:32.760 --> 24:37.560]  just like it's a fact that the Pfizer shot and the Moderna shot give you cancer cause heart attacks
[24:37.560 --> 24:42.440]  destroy your immune system don't protect you again and give you a ds and that's even more
[24:42.440 --> 24:49.720]  in the news today but that's okay Pfizer asked us to allow covid shots for kids ages five to 11
[24:49.720 --> 24:54.440]  even though the only children that have died less than 50 had heart attacks cancer three or four
[24:54.440 --> 25:00.200]  comorbidities and didn't die of covid doesn't matter though doesn't matter europe just banned
[25:00.200 --> 25:05.800]  these vaccines for under 30s because they were killing so many people but don't worry they're
[25:05.800 --> 25:13.960]  gonna double down and say oh no pregnant women need it because they're mad scientists you see
[25:14.680 --> 25:20.040]  oh but alex shones he's the bad guy he didn't lie about wmds like the new york times did on purpose
[25:21.240 --> 25:26.840]  with the office of special plans no no alex shones this question you know big public events
[25:26.840 --> 25:32.600]  because so many are staged in fact there's so many staged hate attacks now i can't even keep track of
[25:32.600 --> 25:41.320]  them anymore and then you learn about old ones like the baby from rovey wade that if never
[25:41.320 --> 25:47.080]  aborted didn't die it was all fake it was all lie the woman's 50 years old now they tried to
[25:47.080 --> 25:55.720]  abort her in 1970 the media told us that she was aborted but she wasn't aborted by her mother
[25:55.720 --> 26:05.000]  it was all a lie but oh you shouldn't question big events see the reason they stage big events
[26:05.560 --> 26:08.520]  is they want to be able to control it and make sure nothing leaks or ever gets out
[26:09.800 --> 26:14.200]  and so they didn't want to use a real woman that had gone out and got an illegal abortion they went
[26:14.200 --> 26:18.680]  to found one and just made the whole thing up because they love their father the devil they'll
[26:18.680 --> 26:23.000]  lie when telling the truth would serve them better because it's of their nature
[26:23.000 --> 26:30.600]  remember what did i say hundreds of times here i said immortal cell lines all the major vaccines
[26:30.600 --> 26:35.480]  are basically growing immortal cell lines they may grow them on eggs at the end of the day
[26:35.480 --> 26:41.720]  but the original new batches are made in the immortal cell line of a aborted boy who was
[26:41.720 --> 26:47.880]  eight and a half months old in his mother in 1966 and they found that his cells because they've
[26:47.880 --> 26:53.240]  tested millions of people's cells dead people babies they killed others most people's cells won't
[26:53.240 --> 26:59.800]  keep dividing and won't grow in any type of a medium and so they've got two major cell lines
[26:59.800 --> 27:07.160]  they like to use best it's a dead black woman from 1951 and a dead white boy from 1966 and they
[27:07.160 --> 27:12.840]  keep growing their cells like i've seen some estimations that uh henryetta lacks they've
[27:12.840 --> 27:18.200]  probably grown the equivalent of 20 million of her they don't grow up her whole body they just
[27:18.200 --> 27:25.320]  clone her cells this lady don't die she'll grow on a tabletop in sunlight her cells will their
[27:25.320 --> 27:34.280]  magic they're the best the tumor ate her in a week they came in and saw her decided not to operate
[27:34.280 --> 27:37.640]  on her just because she never shoot blacks up with syphilis back down this mad scientist the
[27:37.640 --> 27:44.200]  ones that train faulty it's the same people they just pass on the club and uh she came in had that
[27:44.200 --> 27:49.240]  tumor and they said you just come back and see us in a couple weeks she was dead that tumor ate
[27:49.240 --> 27:53.080]  large portions of her body and they said let's take her away and check her we've never seen cancer
[27:53.080 --> 27:58.840]  grow like this you see that movie the blob where it just grabs you and eats you right away absorbs
[27:58.840 --> 28:03.960]  just basically like that but in slow motion and so and so i don't want to put henryetta
[28:03.960 --> 28:08.760]  lacks the dead black lady or the dead white kid in me we don't know that that young boy's name
[28:08.760 --> 28:16.280]  that just they tell us it's a white Caucasian six pounds when aborted six pounds one ounce
[28:17.240 --> 28:23.000]  you look it all up they're real proud of him too he just keeps growing keeps giving them what they
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.640]  need and then now they've got Pfizer people saying yeah they told us cover it up even though it's in
[28:27.640 --> 28:34.040]  the documents that it's a gene line it's a cell line an immortal cell line of henryetta lacks
[28:34.040 --> 28:40.920]  and that dead white boy bad scientists want to play god they are on you now they're growing clones
[28:40.920 --> 28:45.720]  they're splicing humans and animals they're doing it all and they want you out of their way well what
[28:45.720 --> 28:50.200]  did Fauci and the head of the hhs and the rest of them say in that video from 2019 they said we
[28:50.200 --> 28:54.840]  need a big deadly virus out of china to really get released we can stampede everybody and do whatever
[28:54.840 --> 29:00.920]  we want and just totally take over hey everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy covid
[29:00.920 --> 29:06.760]  culture me too but listen after all the research all the conflicting studies after all the squabbling
[29:06.760 --> 29:12.120]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on it's that immune system health can literally be the
[29:12.120 --> 29:17.320]  difference between life and death you probably already believe that i certainly do so here's the
[29:17.320 --> 29:22.680]  thing i wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually have
[29:22.680 --> 29:28.520]  studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support now you'll have to sign a waiver but you

[30:56.040 --> 31:02.360]  only we lose is if you don't take action right now could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank
[31:02.360 --> 31:06.360]  with your face covered could you imagine you've been going into the grocery store do you think
[31:06.360 --> 31:10.440]  they would let you in do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that you
[31:10.440 --> 31:17.400]  weren't going to be shoplifting could you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the
[31:17.400 --> 31:22.280]  little mini mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on how far do you think that would get you
[31:22.280 --> 31:27.000]  could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with it with a shield that looks like a space
[31:27.720 --> 31:35.720]  alien those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction
[31:35.720 --> 31:40.360]  the globalists are running a psychological war for operational humanity only waking up to the
[31:40.360 --> 31:46.280]  great reset in its tyranny will save us and the mask is the sign of slavery we must inform the
[31:46.280 --> 31:51.240]  public that it's a fraud and that it's dangerous and it causes major medical issues and it's dehumanizing

[33:02.280 --> 33:21.400]  to the alex jones show so if we stop valuing old people and unborn babies and now handicap folks
[33:22.920 --> 33:27.560]  and if we stop valuing the value of the currency and if we stop valuing our own health we start
[33:27.560 --> 33:34.680]  not caring about our spiritual life our connection to god then what are we well we're we're devils
[33:36.200 --> 33:41.000]  we're disconnected destructive cut off from god the universe failures
[33:42.840 --> 33:48.120]  and when you take the building blocks of life in a laboratory and you splice them together humans
[33:48.120 --> 33:53.800]  made the image of god the great creators we are and you create these horrible sick
[33:53.800 --> 34:04.200]  tortured creatures well that's exactly what the ancient egyptians and the Babylonians all of them
[34:04.200 --> 34:10.360]  carved in hieroglyphs on the walls that the gods came down to earth and spliced humans with animals
[34:10.360 --> 34:17.080]  and made horribly deformed creatures and there was a war and then most of the life on earth got
[34:17.080 --> 34:23.720]  destroyed and all those cultures not just the ancient jewish writings said that flood consumes
[34:23.720 --> 34:31.000]  the surface of the planet Plato wrote about that 2200 plus years ago in the republic and the flying
[34:31.000 --> 34:35.960]  machines in the big city the white city in the atlantic ocean and the visitors that would come
[34:35.960 --> 34:41.560]  and land in Greece on their flying machines and that was the impetus and the idea for all the
[34:41.560 --> 34:50.760]  incredible architecture pull up the uh pull up pull up grease pull up uh crete pull up the parthenon
[34:50.760 --> 34:57.960]  pull up um the capital agrees show people some of that architecture those big giant columns and
[34:57.960 --> 35:02.840]  and and and the incredible destruction i mean people just thought of this out of their minds did
[35:02.840 --> 35:08.600]  they well yeah they did the question is was this the first time this was built the pyramids and all
[35:08.600 --> 35:17.480]  of it or had they seen it before why would they build the columns like rockets and have carvings
[35:17.480 --> 35:22.120]  of flame coming out the bottom why would they have paintings of large ships with portals on the
[35:22.120 --> 35:32.760]  sides landing and humanoids disembarking and so whether that all happened before or not that is
[35:32.760 --> 35:41.000]  in all the ancient myths of the Mayans and the Aztecs and the druids and the ancient shin out of
[35:41.000 --> 35:53.960]  china and now it's happening again and now we're getting ready to destroy ourselves again just like
[35:53.960 --> 36:00.920]  revelation warrants this what we would do again and those are the big mystery school secrets they
[36:00.920 --> 36:06.680]  don't want you to know but your mainline controlled churches won't tell you they're getting ready to
[36:06.680 --> 36:19.080]  blow it all up again the old testament says god you know put us here that made us doesn't like us
[36:19.640 --> 36:24.280]  splicing humans and animals and doesn't like us sacrificing children and drinking blood
[36:25.240 --> 36:29.880]  god likes us to build beautiful things and do amazing things and be good people but if we're
[36:29.880 --> 36:37.400]  bad well we'll destroy ourselves that's why we're given an owner's manual and told you might not
[36:37.400 --> 36:44.360]  want to do what all these other cultures started doing and you read all that stuff in the bible
[36:44.360 --> 36:51.160]  which they've dug up all over the world and proven and other ancient texts and
[36:53.880 --> 36:58.440]  they just find cities with no volcanoes around them where the whole city's glass
[36:58.440 --> 37:05.320]  like a hydrogen bomb and then they check the glass and it's radioactive wonder what's going on here
[37:05.320 --> 37:10.360]  all over the world radioactive melted cities
[37:15.880 --> 37:20.280]  and so the bible says there were human animal clones but it's here now
[37:20.280 --> 37:28.840]  and when you look at Fauci these people they're the guild of mad scientists following the same
[37:28.840 --> 37:32.120]  ancient cult directive to kill still and destroy
[37:35.960 --> 37:40.040]  so let's go ahead and play the video radio listeners can find it at info wars dot com
[37:41.080 --> 37:44.600]  that's in the live feed of the show but we'll add the video from band on video and free world news
[37:44.600 --> 37:52.040]  dot tv under the live show feed today that has the same headline breaking for the first time ever
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.720]  video of animal human hybrid released question mark then we go on to say but it's no question
[37:59.720 --> 38:04.120]  that this is going on it is happening so that's another discussion congress won't pass a law against
[38:04.120 --> 38:09.240]  it the ongoing practice just here alone it's going on even more crazy in china the info shows
[38:09.240 --> 38:15.800]  us are we going to do anything about this are we going to say anything about this
[38:17.240 --> 38:23.960]  because again we're all just being acclimated with movies like lamb and series like sweet tooth
[38:23.960 --> 38:31.800]  with a horrible evil racist right wing hillbillies after a human depopulation event and 99% of humans
[38:31.800 --> 38:36.840]  are dead only a research lab of human animal hybrid survives because humans were inherently
[38:36.840 --> 38:41.880]  bad sweet tooth and now the good black people that are the only humans left that aren't white
[38:41.880 --> 38:46.120]  have to go out with the humanoids and they have to kill the evil white people
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.120]  that's the show and what did i tell you 15 years ago and steven cobert made fun of it i said
[38:54.120 --> 38:59.160]  they're gonna create animal human hybrids and say it's racist to not want them created that's what
[38:59.160 --> 39:04.120]  transhumanism is if you'll accept a man in women's sports you'll accept a man in a woman's gym
[39:04.120 --> 39:08.600]  in their locker room in the women's hot tub in front of little girls with their penises out
[39:08.600 --> 39:13.720]  that's that that that's going on you'll accept hey these these things aren't human there aren't
[39:13.720 --> 39:18.040]  animal we created them we're a corporation we own them but they still have rights
[39:20.840 --> 39:24.680]  and you've got to be nice to them i could see this whole thing a mile away
[39:24.680 --> 39:34.440]  oh and the weasball incident he's a convicted pervert i mean look at the guy's face
[39:35.400 --> 39:39.400]  but he's the protected superman the uber mention in california
[39:39.400 --> 39:44.200]  why they're allowed to give you hiv or hepatitis there and kill you it's a gift they call it
[39:44.200 --> 39:50.600]  gift givers and gift receivers and your children are going to receive you uh
[39:50.600 --> 39:57.720]  but falchi created that lab and released in 1978 and now he's released another gift he did so well
[39:57.720 --> 40:06.120]  then as project manager that he's cooked it up again in wuhan it's on all the documents how they
[40:06.120 --> 40:10.840]  made it and tried to approach the pentagon for 14 million to release it on the chinese that's main
[40:10.840 --> 40:17.480]  line news london independent that's the documents we told you and now it's out there and nothing
[40:17.480 --> 40:23.400]  happens just like nothing happens when they go yeah we have for a couple decades we're
[40:23.400 --> 40:27.320]  splicing humans and animals and you don't really need to see them but they're going to have rights
[40:27.320 --> 40:37.080]  when we bring them out and then that won't make it look so bad when you splice your genetics like
[40:37.080 --> 40:42.520]  they're saying oh we don't want to gay men to have to go to a woman for a surrogate no no the two men
[40:42.520 --> 40:47.960]  will combine well that's not how that's not a human that goes down the mitochondrial dna line
[40:47.960 --> 40:53.000]  pass from a woman totally different creature but see they're already saying oh we're going to make
[40:53.000 --> 40:59.720]  babies out of two men and two women and then you'll have to accept whatever these creatures do
[41:00.360 --> 41:04.120]  you see now you know what the transhumanism is all really about it's not about two men in bed
[41:04.120 --> 41:08.920]  together two women in bed together it is about the end of the species as we know it and us having no
[41:08.920 --> 41:14.440]  boundaries and no controls with these genetic engineer mad scientists totally take over i'm
[41:14.440 --> 41:18.600]  going to go to break uh please try to keep us on air and realize the world's ready to hear the

[46:11.160 --> 46:15.720]  that there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society
[46:16.280 --> 46:21.000]  and now they've done it how did i know they would do it because they wrote books and
[46:21.000 --> 46:26.360]  white papers and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked you see then i
[46:26.360 --> 46:31.800]  was tracking the builder group whose head at the time was claus schwa and our sources in cyber
[46:31.800 --> 46:37.320]  confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this great reset well we're now living in
[46:37.320 --> 46:41.960]  the purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world on its ass is a tyrannical
[46:41.960 --> 46:48.360]  corporate world government the total censorship no due process destruction of the family and then
[46:48.360 --> 46:53.720]  incrementally more and more deadly injections of poison mass creating his vaccines to poison
[46:53.720 --> 46:57.560]  us in the populace this is what info wars is fighting we're fighting for the future
[46:57.560 --> 47:07.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:21.320 --> 47:25.640]  welcome back to the alex jones show we are joined by a thought criminal i don't normally
[47:25.640 --> 47:32.040]  have guests for two days in a row on but this is as bad as it gets arthur poloski no criminal record
[47:32.040 --> 47:37.240]  escaped from behind the iron curtain decades ago from poland came to what he thought was a free
[47:37.240 --> 47:43.640]  country that being of course canada and he's been arrested at his church he's been arrested in the
[47:43.640 --> 47:48.120]  street pulled over he's been arrested flying back into the country then they searched his laptop
[47:48.120 --> 47:53.640]  treated him like a criminal and now he's facing four years in prison for holding a quote illegal
[47:53.640 --> 47:58.600]  church service this is still ongoing while the topless bars and the grocery stores and everything
[47:58.600 --> 48:04.520]  else have been open for the whole time uh here's the headline canadian pastor arrested on tarmac
[48:04.520 --> 48:09.800]  over coban rules says police confiscated luggage snooped through his laptop now that's a week and
[48:09.800 --> 48:14.520]  a half ago and this happened we finally got him on and i didn't realize he was facing this friday
[48:14.520 --> 48:22.360]  tomorrow four years in prison i mean that is like fall on gong type stuff in china where they get four
[48:22.360 --> 48:28.440]  to five years in a forced labor camp for getting caught holding church this is just scary to know
[48:28.440 --> 48:34.040]  that something like nazi germany is forming just north of us because it's nice people they're putting
[48:34.040 --> 48:38.600]  up with it so arthur this could be our last interview for a while and so you've got the floor
[48:38.600 --> 48:43.320]  here of the rest of this segment and then the next and then we've got thomas rins the big
[48:43.320 --> 48:47.560]  lawyer who discovered the pentagon documents made the vaccines killing people by design
[48:47.560 --> 48:51.960]  dr joseph mercullo completely censored off youtube we're saying natural immunity is better than the
[48:51.960 --> 48:55.640]  vaccine which is now admitted fact hell even the big pharma just came out today and said it
[48:55.640 --> 49:02.840]  in cate dally uh so uh we are all arthur poloski now sir uh and they're just acclimating us and
[49:02.840 --> 49:08.520]  we're just calmly here seeing this in australia in europe the uk uh now they're trying to do it in
[49:08.520 --> 49:14.360]  canada and the us so this is a globally u n run system and they're just going for broke now they
[49:14.360 --> 49:17.800]  say in the future if you're not vaccinated you can't have Thanksgiving in canada and they're
[49:17.800 --> 49:21.720]  saying here if you're unvaccinated come take you out of your house that this is where they're going
[49:22.280 --> 49:27.400]  if we don't stand up so thank you for joining us and tell us tell us the latest thank you so much
[49:27.400 --> 49:33.640]  for having me in my trial for sentencing is wednesday october 13th and we are staging a big
[49:33.640 --> 49:40.120]  protest or across north america uh canada calgary okay so i've misunderstood i'm sorry so your
[49:40.120 --> 49:46.760]  sentencing is it tomorrow it's wednesday the 13th okay i apologize okay so it's next wednesday
[49:48.200 --> 49:53.160]  that's right so um as you know i have been traveling all over united states of america
[49:53.160 --> 49:59.480]  for the past four months i was warning americans i did my best to scare as many as i can not just
[49:59.480 --> 50:05.880]  for the sake of um delivering a scary message i mean this is a reality right now what used to be
[50:05.880 --> 50:11.720]  conspiracy theory right now we are living in the middle of that theory theory is not no longer
[50:11.720 --> 50:17.480]  theory it's a fact and of course the truth is popping up left and right i have been warning
[50:17.480 --> 50:22.520]  people since 2005 when authorities came and declared that feeding the homeless people on the
[50:22.520 --> 50:29.160]  streets of calgary alberta canada is no longer legal without the special papers from the mayor
[50:29.160 --> 50:37.480]  uh congregating is not allowed anymore giving free goods and services but plus giving printed
[50:37.480 --> 50:43.560]  material which is bibles and uh gospel tracks that's illegal as well i mean those are the laws
[50:43.560 --> 50:49.720]  in the books usually they don't enforce them unless you become too powerful too vocal and
[50:49.720 --> 50:56.120]  that's exactly what happened to me i had my tv show i had my radio show and all of that triggered
[50:56.120 --> 51:02.520]  this ongoing 16 years right now attacked on my rights and my freedoms and i was telling
[51:02.520 --> 51:09.080]  Canadians just like i was saying to americans in the past four months they came for me be sure of
[51:09.080 --> 51:14.520]  it they're going to come for you as well i remember when the covet started last year i was the first
[51:14.520 --> 51:19.960]  clergyman to get a covet ticket and i was threatened with arrests and i remember the rallies and i
[51:19.960 --> 51:26.120]  was sharing with them i said listen police officers listen doctors listen nurses listen
[51:26.120 --> 51:30.920]  government workers they came for me be sure of it is just a matter of time they're going to come
[51:30.920 --> 51:37.320]  for you that's how the totalitarian system works listen to a guy with a funny accent i grew up behind
[51:37.320 --> 51:43.480]  the iron curtain i was i grew up under the boots of the soviets that's how they operate that's how
[51:43.480 --> 51:49.800]  the system works listen to me i know you have not been living in hell on earth on this side of
[51:51.240 --> 51:57.560]  of the border however i did and many people like me escaped communism to find our freedom
[51:58.120 --> 52:05.000]  in north america unfortunately they had so good for so long they were not willing to listen to me
[52:05.000 --> 52:11.640]  look what is happening just a year and a half later the police officers are forced to get a job
[52:11.640 --> 52:18.520]  you've got the nurses the doctors the government workers even the bus drivers the teachers everyone
[52:18.520 --> 52:25.800]  is being forced to take a poison into his own body you see two years ago it was about me and my
[52:25.800 --> 52:31.320]  children and i said to them listen tomorrow will be your children if you're not going to fight for
[52:31.320 --> 52:37.160]  my children well they were not interested here we are today they're coming for their children as well
[52:37.160 --> 52:44.680]  right now if the people will not rise up and i'm not trying to be scary if you will not rise up now
[52:44.680 --> 52:50.600]  you may not have that opportunity tomorrow now you got to come and unite now you have to do several
[52:50.600 --> 52:56.200]  disobedience now you have to say i will not comply just like the solidarity movement just like what
[52:56.200 --> 53:01.480]  mahatma ghandi did just like what martin luther king junior did now we got a ticket to the streets
[53:01.480 --> 53:08.040]  surround their houses and demand the resignation those are traitors and that's starting to happen
[53:08.040 --> 53:12.520]  in new south weles the worst on the planet even worse than where you're at uh southern australia
[53:12.520 --> 53:17.800]  they've now had six people from the premier down resign because they got caught taking money from
[53:17.800 --> 53:23.640]  big pharma phyzer is directing the world it's in control the the head of it needs to go to prison
[53:25.080 --> 53:30.680]  that's right every politician every person that took part every chief of police that took part of
[53:30.680 --> 53:38.280]  this every sheriff every principal should be charged for treason and some of them should face
[53:38.280 --> 53:45.640]  capital punishment uh this is insanity at the highest level and it's a global insanity right now
[53:45.640 --> 53:51.800]  we are watching the fence that was uh you know built by the authorities with over a hundred police
[53:51.800 --> 53:57.480]  officers around the church this is not a strip club this is not a drug trafficking business
[53:57.480 --> 54:04.200]  no those are all allowed and illegal in canada this is a church where adults come together
[54:04.200 --> 54:11.080]  on free will to worship god and that fundamentally guaranteed we have to remember that our criminal
[54:11.080 --> 54:17.000]  code says that if anyone interferes with the church gathering if anyone interferes with the
[54:17.000 --> 54:23.080]  clergyman while he's conducting his duty that's two years prison term but instead of following
[54:23.080 --> 54:29.960]  the law they're hammering on us instead of them going to jail they want pastors in jail you know
[54:29.960 --> 54:35.880]  what happened tens of thousands of criminals were released from prisons in the past year and a half
[54:35.880 --> 54:42.680]  i mean tens of thousands of hardcore criminals were let go back into society but they are being
[54:42.680 --> 54:51.480]  replaced with people like me pastors christians jews we are reliving history this is a repetition
[54:51.480 --> 54:59.080]  of what other people did not succeed those big farmers those evil wicked people are are doing
[54:59.080 --> 55:05.160]  right now look at what happens in australia i mean those people and i said that so many times
[55:05.160 --> 55:11.720]  like like a broken record i said listen people they will never stop those types of people never
[55:11.720 --> 55:16.680]  stopped bully never stopped thomas jefferson said it thomas jefferson said the level of
[55:16.680 --> 55:20.680]  tyranny you will live under is what you accept the tyrant has no limit they have a thirst for
[55:20.680 --> 55:25.480]  power and control and we show the footage you have other big churches that refuse to stop meetings
[55:25.480 --> 55:32.040]  they would put fences up with black paper so that you couldn't see it like it was a hustler magazine
[55:32.040 --> 55:36.360]  or a porno movie and then i know people tore it down they put it back up well what happened
[55:36.360 --> 55:42.920]  with that big church i mean this is just incredible they were a fence for four months uh illegally
[55:42.920 --> 55:49.880]  their property private property was seized by the government they brought over a hundred riot police
[55:49.880 --> 55:56.120]  uh guarding it anyone that dared to touch the fence later on would be arrested i mean total
[55:56.760 --> 56:01.720]  lawlessness and that's exactly what happens when you kick god out of your country i have been
[56:02.360 --> 56:08.440]  asking people to go back to the basics the four founding fathers the forefathers built our nations
[56:08.440 --> 56:14.120]  based on judio christian values in canada our constitution the charter rights and freedoms
[56:14.120 --> 56:19.720]  start to the preamble various canada acknowledges the supremacy of god and the rule of law when
[56:19.720 --> 56:25.960]  god is kicked out while he takes the rule of law that's right lawlessness judges are corrupted
[56:25.960 --> 56:32.680]  they took money look at what happened to me they found a corrupted judge david gates i don't know
[56:32.680 --> 56:39.800]  if he's related to your bill gates but david gates of alberta gave them a card plan shed to arrest me
[56:39.800 --> 56:47.480]  anywhere they want using any force deemed necessary also he allowed them to come into my church
[56:47.480 --> 56:52.840]  anytime they want with whom ever they want anytime of the week though so they showed up with the
[56:52.840 --> 56:58.280]  anti terrorists the anti terrorists came to intimidate and harassed christians while they
[56:58.280 --> 57:02.040]  are praying not terrorists and by the way you were on a few months ago and you predicted that
[57:02.040 --> 57:07.000]  would happen here now the national education association is sending the fbi they're in command
[57:07.000 --> 57:12.680]  of it quote calling parents that don't want their children to be injected or wear masks or to be
[57:12.680 --> 57:17.960]  taught that their bag is their wife they're now saying we're terrorist that's right and i said
[57:17.960 --> 57:23.240]  that that's why i came to united states so here is a footage of prime minister just to those saying
[57:23.240 --> 57:29.400]  he has a huge admiration with the chinese dictatorship because they can do things they can
[57:29.400 --> 57:35.320]  do things fast and efficient i mean so forget your constitution they're just going to shut
[57:35.320 --> 57:40.120]  churches down this is all an illegal power grab the inoculations the force injections the
[57:40.120 --> 57:44.840]  vaccine passports the mandates it's all fraud none of its lawful under common law common sense
[57:44.840 --> 57:50.440]  we'll be right back with the pastor we got other big guests so the placebo that they have used that
[57:50.440 --> 57:57.720]  the fda has allowed them to use has often been another vaccine a vaccine with a known adverse
[57:57.720 --> 58:05.320]  reaction profile that's causing death and damage in its own right that it's the aluminum as an
[58:05.320 --> 58:11.400]  adjuvant in the vaccine a known neurotoxin a known immunotoxin a known poison in human beings
[58:11.400 --> 58:17.800]  that is in the supposedly inert placebo totally inappropriate this is not good science it is
[58:17.800 --> 58:24.920]  not science at all it is an effort to cover up the true adverse reaction rates to the vaccines
[58:24.920 --> 58:31.640]  so that they can get through the low barrier of constraints put there by the fda and onto the
[58:31.640 --> 58:37.240]  market that is the only concern dr wakefield is just one of many informed voices in the film
[58:37.240 --> 58:43.240]  covetland secure your copy of covetland today at covetland.com and if you order by october 6

[58:56.520 --> 59:04.200]  in nature and in foods we eat but in very very low amounts it's called pqq or bio pqq when you
[59:04.200 --> 59:10.120]  have the organic form of it it does amazing things it actually makes your telomeres last longer

[59:52.760 --> 1:00:10.280]  to the alex jones show if you say to yourself keeping churches closed around the western world
[1:00:10.280 --> 1:00:15.240]  while topless bars and liquor stores stay open seems like rubbing in our face it is
[1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:21.640]  they want the power over the church because under english common law and under judaic law as well
[1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:26.600]  and under magna carta under our bill of rights and constitution it's also in the canadian constitution
[1:00:28.360 --> 1:00:32.920]  the government has no right to block people's religious rights that's why we founded america
[1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:37.160]  a lot of folks came to canada and and then the french couldn't you know get their freedom up in
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:43.400]  canada so they came down to louisiana so this has been ongoing and so what they're doing is the
[1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:50.360]  main assault that the state must be god and so i admire the pastor for being here and i admire
[1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:56.840]  his strength because what he is fighting for is the same fight that dangled on the lion's den and
[1:00:56.840 --> 1:01:01.720]  you know you know others in the fiery furnace it's that same thing where they're saying bow to the
[1:01:01.720 --> 1:01:08.440]  state worship the god of the state isn't that right pastor right now shuddering meshing and
[1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:13.160]  a band ago we're simply taught well be like everybody else just bow i mean what's the
[1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:19.960]  big deal just bow to the state bow to the wishes of the wicked king and if you will not bow we
[1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:25.640]  will go after you we will throw you into a fiery furnace and who will rescue you this thing said
[1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:32.760]  from my hand where you know well this is what happened they answered well our god is perfectly
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:38.600]  capable of saving us from your hand but if he chooses not to so be it but we will not bow and
[1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:43.240]  off they went to the fiery furnace but in the furnace you see if christians would only understand
[1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:49.560]  that in the fire god deals with your enemies in the fire god exposes your enemies in the fire
[1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:55.880]  jesus shows up to set you free in the fire you have a testimony and in the fire it's your promotion
[1:01:55.880 --> 1:02:00.920]  if the church would truly be the church of jesus christ this whole craziness would be
[1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:07.080]  a long time ago over we gotta rise up stand up church pastors where are you leaders of god's
[1:02:07.080 --> 1:02:13.480]  people don't be like soul don't be like jonathan cowards watching the giant of the lord mocking
[1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:19.080]  the living god and mocking the army of the living god we gotta be like david we gotta be
[1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:25.160]  like mordecai that refuse to bow before the homin and yes the gallow is a scary thing but we
[1:02:25.160 --> 1:02:31.080]  let me remind you that it was the homin that hanged on his own devices we just gotta keep
[1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:36.920]  preaching the truth and we have to refuse to bow you see jesus is not for sale do not sell him for
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:42.760]  a bowl of soup for the silver coin do not take the money from the government do not bow before
[1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:50.040]  their regimes rise up and solidarity movement bohatma gandhi and martin luther king jr showed us
[1:02:50.040 --> 1:02:56.440]  how to fight these four resist no compliance you know break their system from within fire lawsuit
[1:02:56.440 --> 1:03:03.480]  after lawsuit after lawsuits crumble them crumble them from within and we know that we can do it
[1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:10.760]  when god is in the middle of our struggle if you invite him back to your nation i said to americans
[1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:17.080]  so many times you want your country back bring god back to your country you want your country back
[1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:22.520]  he has to come and help you in this crazy fight because the enemy is very powerful they have
[1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:28.280]  unlimited resources they have stolen and they were stealing from you for so long that they have
[1:03:28.280 --> 1:03:33.000]  trillions upon trillions of dollars at their disposal so now they're playing god and you know
[1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:39.320]  i've seen this metaphysical rule of god's universe before every time i get persecuted and say it's
[1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:44.280]  up to you god whatever happens then all the sudden i go through some stuff but then the door is open
[1:03:44.280 --> 1:03:48.280]  things get better than ever and but then i understand if that's if god's plan i get destroyed
[1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:52.520]  that's there and in that is the real power isn't it god wants us to step into the fire
[1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:59.480]  that's it in the fire it's your answer and i know fire is uncomfortable for those boys
[1:03:59.480 --> 1:04:04.520]  i'm sure when they look at the fire with furnace that was not a very comfortable situation when they
[1:04:04.520 --> 1:04:10.600]  were looked in the eyes of the giant i'm sure he said well that dude is pretty big but my god is
[1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:17.080]  bigger than that dude and the entire army of his friends so how big is your god who do you worship
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:23.480]  if you worship pouches of today those wicked evil psychopath well then so be it but i have chosen
[1:04:23.480 --> 1:04:29.720]  like joshua to serve my god and with my god he says one time art you and me we're always the
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:35.480]  majority you see god and you you're always the majority that's right pastor arthur poloski
[1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:41.640]  street church dot ca join us again next Tuesday or Monday before uh you're sentencing uh and

[1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:52.600]  of us tip of the spear street church dot ca people supporting god bless you sir god bless you thank you
[1:04:52.600 --> 1:05:00.440]  ally we'll be right back stay with us folks this is a very important information coming up as well
[1:05:23.240 --> 1:05:28.920]  they're using it to buy people to buy influence and in the past they created thousands of trillions
[1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:33.080]  so that they could leverage that manipulate markets but they never allowed that money
[1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:38.120]  to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation now they've gone ahead
[1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:44.120]  and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy buying up everything not to
[1:05:44.120 --> 1:05:50.040]  have the companies operate but to actually shut them down and force the collapse of civilization
[1:05:50.040 --> 1:05:54.760]  making the companies they do find the only things left standing this is the great reset this is
[1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:57.720]  what's happening now more than everyone it's the only way to stop it
[1:06:07.480 --> 1:06:13.960]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow
[1:06:13.960 --> 1:06:24.120]  i mean obviously we can't just turn off the spigot on the system we have and then say hey
[1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:29.160]  everyone in the world should get this new vaccine we haven't given to anyone yet but there must be
[1:06:29.160 --> 1:06:37.400]  some way that we grow vaccines mostly in eggs the way we did in 1947 in order to make the transition
[1:06:37.400 --> 1:06:45.160]  from getting out of the tried and true egg growing which we know gives us results that
[1:06:45.160 --> 1:06:51.320]  can be you know beneficial i mean we've done well with that to something that has to be much better
[1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:58.600]  you have to prove that this works and then you've got to go through all of the clinical trials
[1:06:58.600 --> 1:07:05.480]  phase ones phase twos phase three and then show that this particular product is going to be good
[1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:12.840]  over a period of years that alone if it works perfectly is going to take a decade there might
[1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:21.160]  be a need or even an urgent call for an entity of excitement out there that's completely disruptive
[1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:27.800]  that's not beholden to bureaucratic strings and processes so we really do have a problem of how
[1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:35.720]  the world perceives influenza and it's going to be very difficult to change that unless you do it
[1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:41.480]  from within and say i don't care what your perception is we're going to address the problem in a
[1:07:41.480 --> 1:07:48.440]  disruptive way and in an iterative way because you do need both but it is not too crazy to think
[1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:55.560]  that an outbreak of a novel avian virus could occur in in china somewhere we could get the RNA
[1:07:55.560 --> 1:08:03.000]  sequence from that beam it to a number of regional centers if not local if not even in your home at
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:11.160]  some point and print those vaccines on the patch and self-administer
[1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:18.200]  what a time to be alive well he was on with us last week thomas rins joins us this week
[1:08:18.200 --> 1:08:27.320]  rins-law.com and he went and found the open source of documents on the pentagon's own big
[1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:32.200]  ai program that was even in the news they were tracking covet and lo and behold it found devastating
[1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:40.360]  information that since he broke it over a week ago has now hit mainstream news thank god rins-law.com
[1:08:40.360 --> 1:08:45.240]  it's not just a law firm it's one awards for fighter people's rights uh he also has a lot of
[1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:50.680]  documents and research they're proving what he breaks down mr. rins expertise with law began again
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:57.720]  mentor nuremberg prosecutor and celebrated international lawyer henry t king and junior
[1:08:57.720 --> 1:09:03.320]  attorney rins has won the national trailblazer award for political action assessing a new
[1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:07.080]  state and national legislative and regulatory forums i'm not going to go over all the things
[1:09:07.080 --> 1:09:11.720]  he's done he's got a bunch of big lawsuits going uh and on every front defending our rights and
[1:09:11.720 --> 1:09:18.520]  fighting this monstrous behavior but again he began his experience with a nuremberg prosecutor so
[1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:23.800]  that's certainly what we need now and i appreciate him joining us so much has come on just since he
[1:09:23.800 --> 1:09:29.560]  was on four or five days ago uh with us so he can start wherever he wants to go here to inform
[1:09:29.560 --> 1:09:34.280]  people about what's happening and then i would just dovetail it with fizer ask us to allow covet
[1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:42.440]  shots not a vaccine anymore apc for kids ages five to eleven so even the media the court media is
[1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:46.200]  calling it a shot now because they know the wheels are coming off and i talked to some other high
[1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:51.720]  powered lawyers that say it's about to come out for the next month whistleblowers inside big farm
[1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:57.640]  up bigger than the veritas information where they know that in the trials they covered up deaths
[1:09:57.640 --> 1:10:03.640]  and illnesses and they also did a secret of trials and you see that in the cdc documents from
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:08.040]  october last year months before the injections began here officially they already were doing
[1:10:08.040 --> 1:10:14.200]  tests in europe in the uk and knew it was causing the guillaume arrays the narcolepsy uh the the
[1:10:14.200 --> 1:10:20.040]  cancer to pop up uh the mycocarditis heart attacks you name it and that's why that was in the list
[1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:24.840]  of possible adverse reactions so joining us is thomas rins so much developing moving so fast

[1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:31.320]  we know that there were a lot of this and a lot of that it's well known we also know that uh with
[1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:36.120]  a lot of countries around the world i mean we had the leak visor contract i believe that you know
[1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:39.800]  showed what they were doing to these different countries basically these countries are supposed
[1:12:39.800 --> 1:12:48.200]  to indemnify and cover them up uh you know i mean it's just unbelievable but it's coming out
[1:12:48.200 --> 1:12:53.720]  and the truth will set you free and you know alex one of the things that i want to do i figured
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:58.920]  that you know hey we're gonna in this this presentation you know the presentation i did
[1:12:58.920 --> 1:13:06.440]  with clay clerks where we talked about the 48 000 dead within 14 days so we actually included
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:13.400]  screenshots of raw data from cms i don't know if you saw this alex but it's almost funny if it wasn't
[1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:18.680]  sad oh yes sir i did watch your presentation i've been following you for months and and the documents
[1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:22.280]  and i believe you said some of that the crew we come back we can show some of those slides they're
[1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:27.960]  also on your site but absolutely the you're right what's old's new most people don't know the true
[1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:35.560]  magnitude from the actual data of the real death rate way worse than vars correct oh hey way worse
[1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:43.320]  i mean listen i so there's what i can confirm with evidence and this is not that but if i were a
[1:13:43.320 --> 1:13:48.680]  betting man i'd be willing to put money down on the fact that there's been over 200 000 deaths
[1:13:48.680 --> 1:13:52.920]  from this in the u.s alone oh that's incredibly conservative i mean everyone i know knows people
[1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:58.920]  young and old the died of heart attacks or strokes after they took it oh yeah yeah but i'll tell you
[1:13:58.920 --> 1:14:06.600]  you want something funny i just saw some scumbag fact checker came out and said oh there's no what
[1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:12.680]  there's nowhere in the cms that shows that there's 48 000 deaths well no kidding you have to analyze
[1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:17.400]  the data you have to look at the raw data do you think that they've got it sitting there for you
[1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:22.200]  no they're hiding it they're covering it up that's the nature of a cover up you're going to fact check
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:28.600]  because you didn't analyze the data this is almost funny if it's not so sad there i've got raw data
[1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:34.680]  you can analyze it we've got that i actually have the algorithms that were used to analyze this raw
[1:14:34.680 --> 1:14:40.680]  data so you know what you run that algorithm brother you see if you get the same numbers it'll
[1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:46.280]  actually be a little higher now because there's been more but uh you go ahead and fact check this
[1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:53.080]  one all that you're doing by promoting that is is just giving me another arrow when i sue your bud
[1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:57.880]  so i'm looking for you know the fact checkers you want to fact check this when i sue you for
[1:14:57.880 --> 1:15:04.920]  contributing to the death of all these people i cannot wait to publish your fact check on my raw
[1:15:04.920 --> 1:15:15.720]  data i cannot wait so uh you know i just it's it's incredible by the way dr dr mccullis on
[1:15:15.720 --> 1:15:19.880]  next hour he's being totally censored off the web they're trying to block all these treatments as you
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:26.920]  know isn't that really a nuremberg violation as well to block treatments and bully doctors that
[1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:33.080]  try to expose it mccullis is the smartest doctor i've ran across and that's saying something because
[1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:40.840]  i've got some brilliant doctors i've met this guy's resume is 170 pages with no fluff and i
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:47.320]  cannot get this guy to say something unless he can back it up with some ridiculous number of studies
[1:15:47.320 --> 1:15:52.360]  he is rock solid everything he says is correct and that's why they're so scared of him stay there

[1:20:24.840 --> 1:20:43.400]  well here's joe biden every couple days goes across the street to another building where they've
[1:20:43.400 --> 1:20:50.600]  built a fake white house oval office and a few months ago people pointed out hey that's fake
[1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:56.360]  and roiders came out and debunk claims that biden's oval office is a fake movie set well no
[1:20:56.360 --> 1:21:01.960]  to the oh that's how they fact check his oval office isn't a fake movie set even though it is kind
[1:21:01.960 --> 1:21:08.840]  of a set but he goes across the street to a fake oval office so when it was first pointed out by
[1:21:08.840 --> 1:21:14.280]  people on twitter and other places that hey those windows are fake hey he's it's nighttime but it
[1:21:14.280 --> 1:21:20.920]  it shows it's daytime or and now they don't even care they show that it's a whole press conference
[1:21:20.920 --> 1:21:26.200]  area where he took the so-called triple jab and all the rest of it he was there again a few days
[1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:30.680]  ago on this time the media went ahead and just showed it but steel roiders says this is really
[1:21:30.680 --> 1:21:34.840]  the oval office even though he gets in the limo drives across the street to another building
[1:21:34.840 --> 1:21:40.920]  he goes into the executive office building they they just know they're going to show you this and
[1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:44.600]  then they're going to say it's real and they're going to take you off twitter or facebook or
[1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:48.840]  youtube if you deny it you're like well that's crazy it is it's about rubbing your nose in it
[1:21:48.840 --> 1:21:54.360]  fiser can say natural immunity is better than their deadly shot but you can't so here's footage of
[1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:59.320]  biden and then here's footage uh from uh the the back of the press conference area that's built up
[1:21:59.320 --> 1:22:06.360]  to the fake oval office stage and uh for joining me today to talk about the need to raise the debt
[1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:13.640]  limit we haven't failed to do that since our inception as a country we need to act these leaders know
[1:22:13.640 --> 1:22:18.600]  the need to act the united states pays his bills to the u.s who we are to event is who we're going
[1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:26.520]  to continue to be god willing so uh i'd not like to turn it over to joanne jinkins and then here's
[1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:34.920]  some uh feeds here of uh to her members so thank you mr president for the opportunity to speak to
[1:22:34.920 --> 1:22:42.120]  the impact of not i mean it's all just a giant joke in particular and then nearly 65 million
[1:22:42.120 --> 1:22:47.400]  people across this country who rely on sources of security remember when the queen of england
[1:22:48.120 --> 1:22:52.200]  didn't really go to africa they built a whole fake africa set on a movie set in england for like
[1:22:52.200 --> 1:22:56.920]  for how many tens of millions of pounds going back to one of the prominent lawyers fighting this
[1:22:56.920 --> 1:23:01.960]  tyranny that's got major whistleblowers coming out and more thomas rins rins-law.com since you
[1:23:01.960 --> 1:23:05.640]  mentioned fact checker sir i thought i'd show that here's one more and then we'll get back to you
[1:23:06.360 --> 1:23:12.600]  ap fact check falsely claims school board group did not classify anti crt parents as domestic
[1:23:12.600 --> 1:23:17.080]  terrorist well they take one statement later where they didn't say it but not the original letter
[1:23:17.080 --> 1:23:22.520]  so that's how they engage and the deception they did say domestic terrorist in the letter so they
[1:23:22.520 --> 1:23:27.080]  are they are waging war when you see fact check now from the corporate media you know they're lying
[1:23:27.080 --> 1:23:34.200]  go ahead sir they certainly are they certainly are well i'll tell you alex so i got a couple other
[1:23:34.200 --> 1:23:41.400]  things that that actually you don't know because they they happened today um and yesterday and so
[1:23:41.960 --> 1:23:49.160]  i'd like to give you guys kind of obviously this would be breaking it's new please um so i uh i had
[1:23:49.160 --> 1:23:55.880]  a conversation and i don't know if you saw there's a couple ladies out in colorado uh she's being
[1:23:55.880 --> 1:24:05.000]  denied a kidney transplant because she hasn't got the job the jab colorado hospital is denying her
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:09.160]  i'm not sure which hospital in colorado but one of the colorado health health systems
[1:24:09.720 --> 1:24:16.120]  is denying her right to get a kidney transplant because she hasn't had the jab
[1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:24.200]  are you kidding me so let's talk about where we are this hospital wants to kill her
[1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:29.560]  her because she hasn't had the jab you're absolutely right it's on screen it's an entire hospital
[1:24:29.560 --> 1:24:35.320]  system with stage five renal failure and they're saying take this poison shot or die so now they're
[1:24:35.320 --> 1:24:40.520]  not just firing people uh they're they're literally breaking the Hippocratic oath yeah they're no
[1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:45.320]  no they're trying to kill people i've been saying for a while we've been talking about the hospital
[1:24:45.320 --> 1:24:50.440]  crisis that's going on right now and the left has always said they want to ration care with
[1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:57.080]  death panels this is it this is the hey this is the the imposition of death panels but uh i guess
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:25:02.840]  privatized um you know they're they're trying you listen they put you in the hospital if you've
[1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:07.160]  got covid they give you room death severe to shut down your kidneys they intubate you to destroy your
[1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:12.440]  lungs and then they watch you die they don't feed you frequently and then they get you on palliative
[1:25:12.440 --> 1:25:17.640]  care as quickly as possible to ensure you die i mean and all this just makes some more money
[1:25:17.640 --> 1:25:24.360]  we've been talking about this for a while this wonderful lady is is going through hell right now
[1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:30.840]  trying to get her trying to get a kidney transplant and now and now in australia europe and everywhere
[1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:36.600]  they're announcing the same thing this is a major uc health group saying you all even if you've
[1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:40.920]  already had covid or your doctor says you have a bad reaction to a vaccine they're saying you
[1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:48.200]  must do it it's all about saying the president to ration care and have death panels listen i'm going
[1:25:48.200 --> 1:25:53.640]  to be uh in the coming days i'm going to see what we can do about helping these ladies the they're
[1:25:53.640 --> 1:26:00.840]  they're wonderful people and i want to urge people to support them i want to urge people to back
[1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:05.240]  them make sure they know you love them we need they're going to need your help i'll have a lot more
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:10.920]  on this in the coming days but you know we're at a point now where our doctors are literally
[1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:14.440]  murdering people and they're trying to act as though it's okay well you know we don't want to
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:19.800]  treat those unvaxed people they're this is what they did to the jews right before world war two
[1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:25.080]  should we should we just open oschwitz again that's right for people that don't know hitler
[1:26:25.080 --> 1:26:30.440]  used medical tyranny first to first kill down syndrome children and others and and to bring
[1:26:30.440 --> 1:26:34.600]  in forced abortion against groups he didn't like the left says he pushed abortion or was against
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:41.160]  abortion that's not true and they had to fantasize everything medical tyranny first really began in
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:47.240]  the modern era in nazi germany you're right yeah well i mean we separated the jews because they
[1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:55.560]  claimed that they were they were dirty and unclean and uh you know the idea the idea that this is
[1:26:56.200 --> 1:27:02.200]  that this is somehow acceptable i mean this is nazi-esque and i don't care if anybody's offended
[1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:09.480]  by that or not you're murdering people i mean i'm sorry you're murdering people it's a global
[1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:16.760]  state-directed un controlled corporate a system to kill people just like the hollerith ivm machines
[1:27:16.760 --> 1:27:20.760]  and and the numbers put on people's bodies to enter into those machines and decide how long
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:25.720]  to work somebody or when to kill them it's the same damn thing it's a murderous technocracy run by a
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:33.720]  death cult it i you know i'd like to say that that's crazy but it's not it really is it is
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:40.360]  insanity you know when you're going to tell someone that uh we're going to deny you medical treatment
[1:27:40.360 --> 1:27:45.880]  unless you get an experimental jab by the way these jabs would be a disaster for someone who's
[1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:51.080]  going to have a kidney transplant why would you do that it's terrible well bill gates always said
[1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:54.520]  he wanted death panels stay there i want to talk more about some of the documents you got and put
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:27:58.920]  out that have now gone viral depending on confirming uh that the other shots are destroying people's
[1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:05.000]  immune system but when we come back first disgraced nih director francis collins resigned after woolan
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:11.080]  lab lives exposed document show we got about 40 seconds to break but is it that a good sign that
[1:28:11.080 --> 1:28:16.680]  more and more of these people are resigning they're they're scared they know this the truth's coming
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:24.760]  out here's the thing though this is the key alex the game here is we've got to get rid of anything
[1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:30.520]  related to these gene therapies the game is to promote gene therapy so i've got a lot of evidence
[1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:36.360]  on this i also want to talk to you about la pd coming up but i got a lot of evidence on this
[1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:41.080]  the gene therapy game is the big thing that's the long-term game here there's trillions of dollars
[1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:46.040]  writing on it and we've got to stop it because it's absolutely horrible what they're going to try
[1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:50.200]  Thomas rins you're absolutely on target that's true and we have that new clip we play when you
[1:28:50.200 --> 1:28:54.920]  first came on where they're talking in 2019 about we got to blow up the old system to bring in the
[1:28:54.920 --> 1:29:01.720]  gene therapies we'll be right back so many people say to me alex please stop being so negative well
[1:29:01.720 --> 1:29:07.960]  for me admitting i've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative it hurts
[1:29:07.960 --> 1:29:13.080]  it stinks it's got pus coming out of it i go to the doctor they fix it that's not negative i'm not
[1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:18.760]  living in denial and so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we didn't feel
[1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:23.960]  yet but now it's come to the surface that's actually a positive thing and so yeah trump did
[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:30.360]  an overall a great job they stole the election we can't get down about that we have forced them out
[1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:35.560]  in the open so now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed they're
[1:29:35.560 --> 1:29:40.200]  scared that's why instead of saying oh we're a bunch of losers look what happened no we're a bunch
[1:29:40.200 --> 1:29:45.720]  of winners they're trying to suppress us let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's

[1:35:19.240 --> 1:35:25.160]  the dvd sales are going to pay the crew who donated their time with the hope that they would then be
[1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:29.240]  able to sell the film they came to me knowing uh obviously in the middle of it to help them produce
[1:35:29.240 --> 1:35:34.040]  it do some things and then help get the dvds out to recoup some of their money so uh this is a film

[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:44.840]  heard that la is obviously they're off the rails they're trying to force these jabs on everybody
[1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:50.920]  well now they're trying to force it on the police apparently the union isn't standing up for them at
[1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:56.840]  all and uh i mean we're going to find out the details of this but i'm going to tell you look
[1:36:56.840 --> 1:37:01.800]  at what's happened around our country with the war on police look at what's happened crime has
[1:37:01.800 --> 1:37:09.640]  exploded we've seen just absolute chaos in these cities and they're going to have in la just like
[1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:13.240]  they've had everywhere else that they've tried to force us on people they're going to have hundreds
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:18.360]  if not thousands of officers just say hell no what's that going to do to the safety of the city
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:23.400]  what is that going to do to the response time of the police department what's that going to do when
[1:37:23.400 --> 1:37:29.400]  you're getting shot at or you're you're getting attacked or raped or whatever and you call the
[1:37:29.400 --> 1:37:34.040]  police and they say sorry we don't have anyone we had thousands officers quit because they didn't
[1:37:34.040 --> 1:37:37.800]  want to be experimented on and that's been the plan as you know from the start is to destroy
[1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:42.040]  our country china's not taking this shot all of our enemies aren't taking this shot but only
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:48.600]  americans destroying our police our military our firefighters our hospitals yeah absolutely so
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:53.640]  you know we're about to open up this war and a whole lot of fronts and we're going to talk to
[1:37:53.640 --> 1:37:57.720]  people we're going to we're going to hold these people accountable they are trying to destroy
[1:37:57.720 --> 1:38:03.240]  our infrastructure destroy our people whether it's the healthcare workers whether it's the police
[1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:08.920]  whether it's the fire the ems i've got some great great heroes in the chicago fire i've been talking
[1:38:08.920 --> 1:38:14.360]  to that listen they are attacking our first responders they're attacking our military
[1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:18.680]  they're trying to force this on people and you know the other thing they're doing is they're
[1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:25.400]  getting rid of the people who think you know the officers the the firemen the military people who
[1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:29.800]  who can think and who've done some homework and are critical thinkers that are going to defend
[1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:35.480]  our constitution they're leaving as all we're going to have left is the people who are willing
[1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:42.120]  to blindly follow orders regardless of how stupid they are and this is a crisis we have
[1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:48.120]  got to back our our our heroes our real heroes the ones that are saying no we're going to look at
[1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:52.280]  this we're going to research this we're losing our best and our brightest and keeping what's left
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:56.600]  is this is the this is the plan great reset collapse of the west because the globalists don't
[1:38:56.600 --> 1:39:01.400]  want western ideals there and now they're going out to their primary target our future our children
[1:39:01.400 --> 1:39:06.120]  can you speak to fiser ask us to allow covid shots for kids five to eleven you already had all the
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:11.320]  fda scientists quit and say don't do it and now just like they said by halloween is fouchy predicted
[1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:16.280]  they're going to authorize because fiser demands it who died made them god the targeting of our
[1:39:16.280 --> 1:39:23.160]  children this is a true mega crime against humanity it's worse than that less than five i believe it's
[1:39:23.160 --> 1:39:28.840]  still less than 500 kids according to cvc numbers cvc numbers they're trying to find kids that are
[1:39:28.840 --> 1:39:33.640]  dying from this they can't find them the only kids that are at risk are the kids who got the vaccine
[1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:37.640]  but they got to get it they got to get the vaccine into a whole bunch of kids because then when the
[1:39:37.640 --> 1:39:41.800]  kids die they can blame it on covid instead of the vaccine even though it's the vaccine that's
[1:39:41.800 --> 1:39:46.760]  doing it and let's not forget congress in the white house and all these federal groups are exempt
[1:39:46.760 --> 1:39:52.040]  i mean this is that's the ultimate form of discrimination right there oh it's sick beyond
[1:39:52.040 --> 1:39:57.880]  words listen they're murdering your children they're murdering your children if you are sitting on
[1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:03.480]  your hands at this point there's something wrong with your head if you're not going to protect your
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:09.480]  children i gotta tell you there's something wrong with you we have got to take a stand against this
[1:40:09.480 --> 1:40:15.960]  no country in the world i mean even was it sweden and denmark just said hell no anyone under 30
[1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:20.360]  you know batting the shots under 30 exactly how much more has to pile up we've been totally
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:28.040]  vindicated oh yeah everything that we said i mean the do d documents 60 of the people in the hospital

[1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:35.720]  sun it is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil ladies and gentlemen
[1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:43.320]  we are crossing the rubicon now the entire future destiny of humanity is upon us claus schwaub

[1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:30.280]  our mission is not impossible we've already come so far from accurately predicting what was coming
[1:47:30.280 --> 1:47:36.360]  to it being here because the globalist and operation lockstep and other reports admit their plan
[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:41.560]  to bring in world government hurt people with a poisoned shot then say people that don't take
[1:47:41.560 --> 1:47:48.360]  the shot or the problem and you can see where that psychological warfare takeover then allows them to
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:54.360]  in turn and arrest and imprison those under a medical dictatorship this is a un world corporate
[1:47:54.360 --> 1:47:59.560]  plan from the rockefellers who set up the un and the whole project they set up colesprings harbour
[1:48:00.120 --> 1:48:07.400]  they set up the keiser vellum institute they put adolf hitler with ibm in power and they are now
[1:48:07.400 --> 1:48:13.560]  launching something worse than the nazi so that this is the family and the system and the creatures
[1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:20.840]  that created all this you have to understand what we're really facing now since he brought this up
[1:48:20.840 --> 1:48:25.160]  thomas renz of renz-law.com who's one of the leading lawyers out there doing a great job
[1:48:25.160 --> 1:48:29.560]  exposing this horrible evil and he's working around the clock and the enemy's after him he
[1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:34.200]  mentioned this let's just back him up here not supposed to happen u.s state with highest
[1:48:34.200 --> 1:48:41.080]  vacs rate sees record surge in covid cases that's vermont say with the highest vaccination rate in
[1:48:41.080 --> 1:48:48.680]  united states is number two and is about to surpass the other state that's almost as injected as they
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:54.520]  are and then it's the same graph you see from singapore and israel and zebralter and on and on
[1:48:54.520 --> 1:49:00.920]  and on in iceland continuing again i've got a bunch of other articles here that show other areas here
[1:49:00.920 --> 1:49:06.280]  it is right here cases in vermont already at record levels for the state just keeps rising even with
[1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:11.400]  the highest vaccination rate in the country 89 percent of 18 and up population is at least
[1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:19.720]  partially vaccinated 88 percent of 12 and up to a hundred percent of seniors anyone asked fauci
[1:49:19.720 --> 1:49:24.600]  why he was so wrong because it's the vaccine that's causing it we know that that's kind of a fact
[1:49:24.600 --> 1:49:30.040]  it's what dr yedon the former head of flies are predicted there's a lot of main main is about to
[1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:34.840]  set the new high in cases with 86 percent of everyone over 18 at least partially vaccinated
[1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:41.320]  84 percent 12 and up to nine nine percent of 65 and up wow their daily average is now well
[1:49:41.320 --> 1:49:47.320]  above the national average and currently 89 69 percent higher than florida good thing they're
[1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:51.880]  mandating vaccines to stop transmission and and think now they're going to segue into oh it's a
[1:49:51.880 --> 1:49:57.480]  new variant take a booster and they and gait said almost two years ago that was the plan so this is
[1:49:57.480 --> 1:50:04.200]  all elaborately set up here the actual uh graphs for you from main and vermont but i just like to
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:10.440]  document everything we put up here for you and oh we got the sheriff's department confirming 15 year
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:14.600]  olds dying from the shots that's in a police report i mean they're not going to be able to hide all
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:20.440]  this it's all coming out there's the bears reporting number on this poor young man who's dead now

[1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:31.240]  barrels someone else is going on okay so first thing i want to do is i just got posted i think
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:39.160]  it's up there now on ren's-law.com i posted a blog talking a little bit about religious exemptions
[1:50:39.160 --> 1:50:42.840]  if you've got to get a religious exemption you want to you want to know some things
[1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:48.680]  it's you know i can't give specifically legal advice to anyone in any given state so this is
[1:50:48.680 --> 1:50:53.800]  for advertising purposes that's my lawyer disclaimer but uh share this with your attorneys if they've
[1:50:53.800 --> 1:50:57.720]  got a right to an exemption get a local attorney share this with them and give them a little bit
[1:50:57.720 --> 1:51:04.200]  of background in context it's free it's there i want it shared while you're there share the dhhs

[1:51:16.360 --> 1:51:22.360]  down yeah yeah they took it down then they put it back up changed it then they took it back down
[1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:27.080]  and i to my knowledge it's still down but we got it on our website so get it there and share it
[1:51:27.080 --> 1:51:32.360]  rent-law.com because we need this out there and tell folks how to go there because i want i want to
[1:51:32.360 --> 1:51:36.440]  put it on info wars now that that happened please guys get it from i want to mirror it everywhere
[1:51:36.440 --> 1:51:40.280]  and then let's also post it under our live show feed i didn't know the pentagon and taking that
[1:51:40.280 --> 1:51:47.320]  down wow they must they must have got a lot of heat from from obama oh oh listen alex when i was
[1:51:47.320 --> 1:51:53.480]  doing my speech in the clay clark speech whereas you know putting all this stuff out within a half
[1:51:53.480 --> 1:51:58.360]  hour of being done with my that speech i had a couple reporters came to me and said hey the fda's
[1:51:58.360 --> 1:52:03.960]  already scrubbing their website and we can't find this link or that link i mean as soon as i open
[1:52:03.960 --> 1:52:09.400]  my mouth they've got their their sensors out there scrubbing data so i mean you got to go to
[1:52:09.400 --> 1:52:15.160]  rent-law.com because we try and put everything up there and if you need more i mean you know anything
[1:52:15.160 --> 1:52:20.120]  you guys need that you want to push out there i want people to see truth everything we say we can
[1:52:20.120 --> 1:52:26.280]  back up and by the way you scumbags can take this stuff down but we keep it we got copies it's
[1:52:26.280 --> 1:52:33.000]  everywhere right there the religious discrimination covid read that one uh you see the the do d stuff
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:38.200]  and we got all sorts of stuff there we've got to get this stuff shared we want people to see so

[1:52:44.120 --> 1:52:50.200]  share it to get it out there um truth the truth will set us free well that's right let's explain
[1:52:50.200 --> 1:52:56.760]  this thomas there's a famous saying that if the situation was hopeless no one knows who said it
[1:52:56.760 --> 1:53:03.000]  if the situation was hopeless then their propaganda wouldn't be necessary and so when people go and
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:06.760]  share an article share a video when they do it on their email their text message where it's really
[1:53:06.760 --> 1:53:11.800]  hard for the big tech to censor when they do it online facebook twitter it's changing the world
[1:53:11.800 --> 1:53:17.160]  go to city council read out of the reports there and then cite them uh say hey they banned these
[1:53:17.160 --> 1:53:22.280]  shots in under 30 in sweden because of heart attacks and the FDA's own site says it can cause
[1:53:22.280 --> 1:53:28.920]  heart attacks but this is crazy this is exactly people this audience is already motivated but
[1:53:28.920 --> 1:53:35.880]  i want to salute them and encourage them to redouble their efforts yeah so die and that's why
[1:53:35.880 --> 1:53:41.320]  i'm here right no one wants to see my ugly mug but if i don't get out here and push this no one
[1:53:41.320 --> 1:53:45.080]  else is going to do it the courts are slow i mean we're fighting in the courts and we're going to
[1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:50.040]  keep fighting in the courts but they're slow we have people dying with you know everybody says
[1:53:50.040 --> 1:53:54.040]  what can i do i'm not a lawyer what can i do i'm not a big shot well you don't need to be i'm not a
[1:53:54.040 --> 1:54:00.040]  big shot i'm a nobody i got a tiny little law firm in ohio i mean i'm not a big deal i'm just out
[1:54:00.040 --> 1:54:03.800]  here fighting and that's what you got to do is you've got to be fearless and relentless and you've
[1:54:03.800 --> 1:54:09.400]  got to fight for your freedom so here's what you can do get your butt on this website and share it
[1:54:09.400 --> 1:54:15.640]  everywhere it's got it's got the dov stamp on it okay so if anybody wants to argue with you that
[1:54:15.640 --> 1:54:19.800]  it's not true tell them look at the stamp and for those who just tuned in or didn't remiss to you
[1:54:19.800 --> 1:54:24.520]  or remiss the article that's gone viral and now hitting you in mainstream explain what the dov
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:29.800]  shows it doesn't just show uh that that that after five to six months you lose the so-called immunity
[1:54:29.800 --> 1:54:35.880]  but then when you get anything similar to covid it makes it far worse with ade it's all it's killing
[1:54:35.880 --> 1:54:42.360]  people just like vermont and main show when you take this damn shot you're in trouble oh there's
[1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:48.920]  no question about that but here's the thing that that outright says it says in no uncertain terms
[1:54:48.920 --> 1:54:58.120]  60 of the hospitalized with covid the medicare are fully vaccinated 60 which follows what we
[1:54:58.120 --> 1:55:05.480]  saw in uk and everywhere else and it's actually probably a lot higher but 60 so when they say
[1:55:05.480 --> 1:55:10.200]  that this is safe and effective they're lying and by the way will inskey just came out two days ago
[1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:15.880]  and said the vaccine does not prevent the spread of the disease why would you get experimented on
[1:55:15.880 --> 1:55:21.480]  we need this shared we need people to see this we got to get it out there we got to get it everywhere
[1:55:21.480 --> 1:55:26.120]  i need warriors we need people who have a back you know and i agree let's stop right now my guys

[1:57:27.800 --> 1:57:32.120]  and then causing ad and making your body kill itself and they're murdering and now coming
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:36.600]  for our children i get excited about this because people go get excited about a football game but
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:40.760]  they get excited about something like that i get excited about this and i flip out it's true and
[1:57:40.760 --> 1:57:44.920]  that's why i'm still alive because i'm pissed this is a big deal they're murdering us
[1:57:44.920 --> 1:57:53.240]  yes i have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart deep in my soul i've ever had in my
[1:57:53.800 --> 1:57:59.960]  47 years on this planet i've had a lot of lost everybody else has and it's because
[1:58:00.840 --> 1:58:10.760]  it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for
[1:58:10.760 --> 1:58:18.840]  it and now we're just throwing it all away and i see the general public in a medically induced
[1:58:18.840 --> 1:58:21.720]  scientifically induced behavioral psychologically controlled
[1:58:23.080 --> 1:58:29.080]  transient and i know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad
[1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:36.440]  but this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating
[1:58:36.440 --> 1:58:42.360]  collapsing and then coming back to life again it's just the globalist are actively trying to steer
[1:58:42.360 --> 1:58:47.160]  and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it
[1:58:48.520 --> 1:58:54.520]  you'd have to be hiding under a rock not to know that vitamin d vitamin c zinc and other
[1:58:54.520 --> 1:58:59.960]  essential vitamins and minerals are essential to our bodies to our immune systems we don't have them

[1:59:05.480 --> 1:59:11.880]  levels that are recommended if you don't have deep restful clean sleep your body will fall apart
[1:59:11.880 --> 1:59:17.000]  even faster and with so many chemicals in the food and water and so much agitation in the culture
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:20.600]  in life it's hard to settle down it's hard to relax well let me tell you something right now

[2:00:01.880 --> 2:00:05.800]  our final segment with our guests and i've gotten better at not blowing up on air because the media
[2:00:05.800 --> 2:00:10.120]  clips it out i may blow up once a month and that's what ends up being national news and it's not
[2:00:10.120 --> 2:00:14.280]  fake though i got so mad when i learned they took it down off the do decide and i went and checked
[2:00:14.280 --> 2:00:19.160]  it's true that i had a little mini flip out and then i got ocd and i find the clip find the clip
[2:00:19.160 --> 2:00:23.240]  that's a real thing i do it's it's neurotic and it's strange but it's what the pressure does i don't

[2:01:39.080 --> 2:01:44.360]  and it usually works but i just man this is it's a little stuff that's not little they're taking
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:50.200]  down their mass murder and it just it just shows how their own military follows those damn orders
[2:01:50.200 --> 2:01:54.120]  those military people that were told to take that down should done a press conference right then
[2:01:54.120 --> 2:01:58.360]  that they would have been thrown in prison like that that lucenic colonel from the marine corps
[2:01:58.360 --> 2:02:05.400]  yeah well i mean listen i i would be more frustrated on that if i hadn't seen it every time i speak i
[2:02:05.400 --> 2:02:10.600]  mean i've had instances where i've had emails to other attorneys that get blocked i mean oh yeah me
[2:02:10.600 --> 2:02:17.080]  too the level of censorship that i'm dealing with is just incredible by the way even ryan
[2:02:17.080 --> 2:02:21.800]  stelter's called for getting into our text messages and and and emails and mainstream news
[2:02:21.800 --> 2:02:25.960]  google now admits they're blocking emails so what you just said they've been doing for two years we
[2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:32.440]  know of yeah yeah i mean i know and you know think about that as an attorney and i'm gonna tell google

[2:02:37.560 --> 2:02:43.320]  of the the things that i'm most excited in the universe for but i mean if i was to miss uh uh
[2:02:43.320 --> 2:02:51.080]  an email related to a client and it caused them injury do you have any idea how much liability
[2:02:51.080 --> 2:02:56.840]  there'd be there i can't i mean what just go ahead give me that evidence give me that ammo i'll add
[2:02:56.840 --> 2:03:02.520]  that to the lawsuit against you scumbags i can't wait to sue everybody but you know listen i flip

[2:04:45.400 --> 2:04:50.120]  murder and then when the pentagon starts doing that i got a problem with it you guys better
[2:04:50.120 --> 2:05:03.000]  stop pushing now we'll be right back i want to explain something that is absolutely heat
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:07.960]  understanding our world that's very very simple but the most people don't know the privately owned
[2:05:07.960 --> 2:05:14.440]  central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars
[2:05:14.440 --> 2:05:21.000]  and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure intellectual property
[2:05:22.040 --> 2:05:28.280]  energy they're using it to buy people to buy influence and in the past they created thousands
[2:05:28.280 --> 2:05:32.680]  of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulate markets but they never allowed that
[2:05:32.680 --> 2:05:37.880]  money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation now they've gone
[2:05:37.880 --> 2:05:43.160]  ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy buying up everything
[2:05:43.720 --> 2:05:49.960]  not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization
[2:05:49.960 --> 2:05:54.680]  making the companies they do fund the only things left standing this is the great reset this is
[2:05:54.680 --> 2:06:04.680]  what's happening now or in everyone is the only way to stop it
[2:06:04.680 --> 2:06:24.680]  love from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[2:06:24.680 --> 2:06:40.040]  ladies and gentlemen dr. joseph mccola has been demonized and attacked for his medical
[2:06:40.040 --> 2:06:48.520]  doctor background and well researched documentation because he has been so credible over the last
[2:06:48.520 --> 2:06:53.240]  20 plus years and because tens of millions of people follow what he says and does and they've
[2:06:53.240 --> 2:07:00.680]  gone and harassed him at his office at his home they've tried to act like you know he's some type
[2:07:00.680 --> 2:07:06.280]  of criminal because he said natural immunity is way better than these so-called vaccines
[2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:11.560]  because he says that the shot has waning effectiveness because everything he said
[2:07:11.560 --> 2:07:16.200]  before they even injected people in the last year has come true so i'm going to try to give him the
[2:07:16.200 --> 2:07:21.240]  floor and he sent us a whole bunch of articles and documents he's going to be going over tying it
[2:07:21.240 --> 2:07:30.840]  into bill gates tying it into the un dr. joseph mccola of mercola dot com m e r c o l a dot com
[2:07:30.840 --> 2:07:37.800]  stop covid cold dot com and he's been demonized for informing people about vitamin d about zinc
[2:07:38.680 --> 2:07:45.320]  about things like that so he's with us to cover the waterfront in this amazing time he got censored
[2:07:45.320 --> 2:07:50.360]  and taken off youtube blocked a bunch of other places and he said look we're winning i saw him
[2:07:50.360 --> 2:07:56.760]  declare last week that he's he knows that even though bad things like this are happening that a
[2:07:56.760 --> 2:08:01.000]  lot of good things are happening as well so dr. mccola thanks for coming on with us well thank
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  you for having me alex it's a pleasure to be with you what a time to be alive please start wherever
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:14.360]  you think best okay well i i think uh you know you reached out after we uh chose to remove our
[2:08:14.360 --> 2:08:20.840]  articles a while back and i just chose to kind of hold off for a while because we were getting a
[2:08:20.840 --> 2:08:27.320]  lot of threats at the time and so we decided to remove 15 000 articles that have been up for
[2:08:28.120 --> 2:08:34.360]  almost a quarter of a century so we have a different strategy now for for relaying our content we
[2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:40.040]  still have an active newsletter but uh this has been response to this map the all the threats
[2:08:40.040 --> 2:08:45.960]  personal and to our business and everything but it seems to have worked and interestingly they
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:51.240]  i consider their discrediting campaign one of the biggest honors and badges i've ever
[2:08:51.240 --> 2:08:56.040]  achieved in my life because they perceive me such a serious threat that they're throwing
[2:08:56.040 --> 2:09:02.040]  all this ammunition and effort to seek to discredit me and get me off of social media i mean to the
[2:09:02.040 --> 2:09:08.040]  point where they're identifying me as the number one spreader of misinformation uh out there and
[2:09:08.040 --> 2:09:14.440]  uh i mean we've got i think two weeks ago senator elizabeth warren just you know wrote a letter to
[2:09:14.440 --> 2:09:19.960]  the ceo of amazon saying that my book should be banned and should burn the book and it shouldn't
[2:09:19.960 --> 2:09:27.320]  be out there and and then there's a free other congressman that participated in that process
[2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:34.680]  but you know all they do they all these efforts are to discredit us but uh no one looks at the
[2:09:34.680 --> 2:09:43.640]  source of the information that they're using to discredit us there is this uh ccdh the center for
[2:09:44.760 --> 2:09:51.320]  countering digital hate which is a perfect oxymoron uh because they do the exact opposite
[2:09:51.320 --> 2:09:59.000]  it's a classic or willian doublespeak but they are a front group for dark money they've only got
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:06.600]  spun up a year and a half ago and no one none of the mainstream media ever ever took the time
[2:10:06.600 --> 2:10:12.680]  effort and energy to evaluate the basis for the assertions that were being used to claim
[2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:18.920]  that i was the number one spreader of misinformation along with 11 other people and that we were
[2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:24.120]  responsible for literally two-thirds of the misinformation about coven on the uh on the
[2:10:24.120 --> 2:10:29.960]  internet but when facebook did its internal analysis they said those 12 people are responsible for
[2:10:29.960 --> 2:10:36.360]  less than a half of one percent a half of one percent so they just trusted this this front
[2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:42.600]  group that was funded by dark money arabela advisors is the primary one of which gill bill
[2:10:42.600 --> 2:10:51.160]  gates last year alone donated seventy billion dollars to so they are well funded and it's
[2:10:51.160 --> 2:10:55.880]  it's this it they do his dirty work for him and and there's many other people behind it too it's
[2:10:55.880 --> 2:11:01.800]  not just this the eric kesler is another another well sure they also have uh this shield group
[2:11:02.520 --> 2:11:08.760]  that microsoft owns this internet shield group that that comes out and and lies and puts out this
[2:11:08.760 --> 2:11:13.880]  info and even reuters as a fact checker you know came out and said natural immunity is no good
[2:11:13.880 --> 2:11:18.200]  defending the surgeon general uh and and now they've said that biden isn't using a fake
[2:11:18.200 --> 2:11:23.640]  uh set for the oval office even though hundreds of reporters go in and it's a fake set across the
[2:11:23.640 --> 2:11:30.440]  street i mean this is next level gaslighting dr margolo what's going on here well it's their
[2:11:30.440 --> 2:11:36.840]  sincere effort to remove any credible threats to their propaganda campaign i mean you're very
[2:11:36.840 --> 2:11:41.960]  familiar with it even spreading the word for quite some time now and uh really telling the truth
[2:11:41.960 --> 2:11:47.720]  about the intentions which is to really brainwash the population and alex there is not a doubt in
[2:11:47.720 --> 2:11:53.400]  my mind that this they this is the most effective brainwashing campaign in the history of civilization
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:11:59.960]  there has been no other campaign ever in history that's been as effective as this uh and this is
[2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:06.760]  the biggest hoax in human history by by a long shot well a hoax is one thing but actually convincing
[2:12:06.760 --> 2:12:11.400]  the majority of the population that is true is quite another and and they've done it through
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:15.640]  some very sophisticated means google is one of the primary nefarious culprits in this because of the
[2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:21.960]  way they 93 percent of the searches done in the world are done on google so they control your your
[2:12:21.960 --> 2:12:28.360]  really gateway to the internet for for information and the internet is an amazing marvelous tool
[2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:33.880]  youtube is another good one which is of course a a child company of google that they purchased in
[2:12:33.880 --> 2:12:39.000]  the 2004 or 2005 i believe you're right and there also isn't big tech heavily invested in big pharma
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:45.240]  total conflict of interest oh absolutely they're all aligned and you know interestingly it all
[2:12:45.240 --> 2:12:50.920]  goes back to you know who controls this who is the global elite and i don't know if you've gone
[2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:56.040]  over this before but we've researched it and concluded that there's there's two corporations
[2:12:56.040 --> 2:13:00.520]  in the world that almost own all the companies in our old world have you discussed that before
[2:13:00.520 --> 2:13:04.680]  alex uh but you do a really great job i've i've read your writings that are dead on please elaborate
[2:13:04.680 --> 2:13:11.080]  doctor okay so there's two ones would be black rock uh because if you look at the the corporate
[2:13:11.080 --> 2:13:16.200]  shareholders of of almost any company you'll see that black rock was one and that's a public company
[2:13:16.200 --> 2:13:20.920]  so that you can see who owns black rock but you know who owns most of black rock the other big one
[2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:24.760]  which is vanguard and that's private so you can't figure it out but the people who are holding the
[2:13:24.760 --> 2:13:28.760]  largest shares in vanguard those are the global elite that's who's controlling the world that's
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:35.000]  who's running the show that is who's directing this whole nefarious campaign of depopulation and
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:41.800]  brainwashing so it's it's these the global elite that are owning vanguard i mean that's that those
[2:13:41.800 --> 2:13:45.720]  are the people behind the scenes and we don't know who they are we can't suspect who some of them are
[2:13:45.720 --> 2:13:51.320]  i mean gays isn't an obvious choice but there are many others so uh and they like to stay hidden
[2:13:51.320 --> 2:13:56.840]  in stealth and boy it sure helps to just get rid of all the old people so you don't have to pay
[2:13:56.840 --> 2:14:01.640]  out their pension funds and the rest of her and but then make the young people sick so now they're
[2:14:01.640 --> 2:14:06.200]  permanent patients for the rest of their lives yeah there's not much time left in this summit
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:11.160]  but i really want to go into just how many people are being affected by this campaign because the
[2:14:11.160 --> 2:14:16.040]  numbers are astounding and i i suspect i don't know if you've gone over any steep steep curses
[2:14:16.040 --> 2:14:21.880]  analysis but it's just staggering we're looking at a quarter million people in the united states alone
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:28.440]  250 000 in the u.s who have been killed by the vaccine uh yes sir i'm gonna try i'm gonna try
[2:14:28.440 --> 2:14:32.040]  to give you the floor when we come back dr macose you can just for the rest of the hour lay this
[2:14:32.040 --> 2:14:38.840]  out but we got about a minute and a half to break please continue well you know that i want to go
[2:14:38.840 --> 2:14:43.240]  over what those numbers are and the analysis behind it because i think it's really important for
[2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:46.920]  your viewers to know that they haven't seen it already but because it's really astounding and
[2:14:46.920 --> 2:14:51.800]  all this information is being suppressed not a word of it is ever linked out and anything that
[2:14:51.800 --> 2:15:00.600]  tends to is beyond heavily censored or you know the the uh the uh is social media is deep platform so
[2:15:00.600 --> 2:15:06.840]  you know uh but fortunately there are resources like yourself uh that and others many others
[2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:09.960]  that are doing such a good job of getting the information out there and helping the people
[2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:16.760]  who aren't brainwashed you know to really do a good job so uh you know it's just you know there's
[2:15:16.760 --> 2:15:20.680]  not many of us out there there's less than 80 million in united states who haven't got the job
[2:15:20.680 --> 2:15:25.320]  and the key is to never get the jab but if you already got it is to forgive yourself and just
[2:15:25.320 --> 2:15:29.880]  never get a booster because every time you get it you're likely to stay in live to radically
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:37.240]  decreases so you know it's uh doc seeing them do this i mean we knew they were building up to
[2:15:37.240 --> 2:15:42.280]  an operation lockstep you know we knew they were planning this but wow they really did it and and

[2:19:04.280 --> 2:19:09.880]  and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other who are literally trying to create
[2:19:09.880 --> 2:19:14.520]  a post human world for the united states of brazil and of course triggered by the brakes in the
[2:19:14.520 --> 2:19:19.960]  uk nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government that's why they
[2:19:19.960 --> 2:19:26.840]  launched their great recess and their program after collapsing us of build back better this
[2:19:26.840 --> 2:19:33.000]  is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy because they
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:38.520]  couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology of this
[2:19:38.520 --> 2:19:45.960]  world government system could win they released a biological weapon on us now we know two years ago
[2:19:45.960 --> 2:19:50.280]  we learned about it about 20 months ago it's that simple they can't maybe it's because of our
[2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:55.400]  free speech in our guns so the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest
[2:19:55.400 --> 2:20:04.440]  of history expose this paradigm and we win you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:18.600 --> 2:20:23.000]  all right we've got the tip of the spear when it comes to exposing this medical tyranny
[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:28.360]  corporate world government takeover dr joseph merkola merkola.com stop covid cold.com and he
[2:20:28.360 --> 2:20:32.360]  also has a new that's something but they're trying to censor exposing all this so go ahead
[2:20:32.360 --> 2:20:37.240]  and take over sir please give us the presentation tell us what's behind this what's going to happen
[2:20:37.240 --> 2:20:42.760]  and how we stop it okay good i can go back to that my book again which is really interesting
[2:20:42.760 --> 2:20:51.960]  because if you ran the reel of the cnn i guess i'm not had to begin but the stalking me at my home
[2:20:51.960 --> 2:20:55.800]  you know and retracting me down to the beach and following me and trying to interrogate me on the
[2:20:55.800 --> 2:21:03.080]  beach uh so her her intention at the at the end of it's a seven minute interview that not interview
[2:21:03.080 --> 2:21:07.400]  but peace that they'd hit peace they did on me and at the end of it he says we don't even want to
[2:21:07.400 --> 2:21:13.480]  say the name of his book but his book right now is number one on amazon and he continued to be a
[2:21:13.480 --> 2:21:17.960]  number one it was my best-selling book ever i've written 17 books this was the best-selling book
[2:21:17.960 --> 2:21:22.600]  ever i know you sell it in your store too so thank you for that support but it's you know we didn't
[2:21:22.600 --> 2:21:26.600]  know when i wrote the book that we were taking all our content down this was not part of the plan
[2:21:26.600 --> 2:21:29.960]  we had no ideas what's going to happen so it turned out to be pretty fortuitous because
[2:21:29.960 --> 2:21:35.080]  now all the information is available in one place and it really gets the information out to more
[2:21:35.080 --> 2:21:39.560]  and for radio listeners that don't know tell them the name of the book the book is the truth
[2:21:39.560 --> 2:21:45.560]  about cobin 19 and i wrote it with ronnie commons and bobby kennedy wrote the forward to it so i'm
[2:21:45.560 --> 2:21:49.800]  really and he's got a really good book it's called the truth about 20 fauci that's coming out next
[2:21:49.800 --> 2:21:55.080]  month phenomenal book phenomenal really goes deep and i think you should interview him if you want
[2:21:55.080 --> 2:22:01.240]  i can connect with him but it's yeah his this is so eye-opening he puts the together the links
[2:22:01.240 --> 2:22:09.560]  between rockefeller and and gates and and the whole and fauci and i mean who's an unbelievable
[2:22:09.560 --> 2:22:16.040]  sociopath but anyway they they tried to discredit me and make sure that that people weren't selling
[2:22:16.040 --> 2:22:20.040]  my book and it just did the exact opposite it went to bestseller status and it's been
[2:22:20.680 --> 2:22:24.600]  it's been crazy so and it's also increased the amount of people who are trafficked so that every
[2:22:24.600 --> 2:22:29.880]  efforts and attempts that they seek to to squash me seems to make us better probably what they did
[2:22:29.880 --> 2:22:34.680]  for you too you know it's just like you get more attention and the people who you resonate with
[2:22:34.680 --> 2:22:41.160]  follow you but i want to get back to the coven now because some really interesting development
[2:22:41.160 --> 2:22:49.720]  there's a tech valley or silicon valley entrepreneur his name is steve kersh very successful and
[2:22:49.720 --> 2:22:54.920]  and develops a significant amount of wealth and is because of because he's financially secure
[2:22:54.920 --> 2:23:00.040]  he had the opportunity to just isolate himself and just go take a massive deep dive and this is
[2:23:00.040 --> 2:23:06.680]  about the only thing he's studying now is is coven 19 and and the massive misinformation around it
[2:23:06.680 --> 2:23:11.160]  so he's compiled he went he did a deep dive in the bear's database and for those of listeners
[2:23:11.160 --> 2:23:16.280]  don't know that is really the only legitimate authorized database and collection official
[2:23:16.280 --> 2:23:24.280]  government collection of the the deaths and the and the injuries from any vaccine but what we've
[2:23:24.280 --> 2:23:28.920]  noticed i mean there's been studies done at harvard that showed that it's massively under
[2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:34.120]  reported anywhere between one and one percent and ten percent so that means that whatever's
[2:23:34.120 --> 2:23:38.760]  reported there you could add one zero or two zeros for the actual true number and the reason this
[2:23:38.760 --> 2:23:44.920]  is is because it's it's a very complex i think intentionally designed system to put in a data
[2:23:44.920 --> 2:23:53.000]  entry and steve relates a really good example of a neurologist who had two thousand vaccine
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:59.800]  injuries in her practice two thousand all related to coven and she only entered two because it was
[2:23:59.800 --> 2:24:05.400]  so cumbersome it takes a half anywhere from a half hour to an hour to enter one all health care
[2:24:05.400 --> 2:24:09.240]  practitioners are legally required to do this but there's no enforcement action if they don't
[2:24:09.800 --> 2:24:14.120]  and they're not compensated to spend an hour to enter this information and many times they
[2:24:15.080 --> 2:24:19.800]  and if they get called away or they you know times out and all the information they entered
[2:24:19.800 --> 2:24:23.480]  it might have been a half hour just gets deleted they have to start all over again so it's i think
[2:24:23.480 --> 2:24:28.520]  it's intentionally cumbersome and designed to minimize the number of of actual reports in
[2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:34.360]  it but be that as it may as we're sitting now it gets updated every friday and we're just short
[2:24:34.360 --> 2:24:38.760]  short of sixteen thousand deaths reported in the united states that number is twenty two thousand
[2:24:38.760 --> 2:24:46.280]  in the european union and seven hundred and fifty thousand injuries most of them serious many
[2:24:46.280 --> 2:24:53.000]  permanent disabilities seven hundred fifty thousand this is accepted in the bears database
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:58.840]  that's the bare but minimum as i said that you could it's anywhere from one to two zeros to that
[2:24:58.840 --> 2:25:03.960]  but steve kersh did an analysis and he challenged anyone he actually just challenged him he offered
[2:25:03.960 --> 2:25:10.440]  them a million dollars to to go in and dialogue with him about anyone to do and no one has taken
[2:25:10.440 --> 2:25:15.400]  up on this offer because i think he's on really solid ground but he's he analyzed the data in a
[2:25:15.400 --> 2:25:19.800]  number of different ways and we're actually having this article i think it's on saturday on our site
[2:25:19.800 --> 2:25:25.000]  at marcolla.com so i don't have the links with me now so but it will have the we'll have the
[2:25:25.880 --> 2:25:30.520]  interview embedded it's not my interview with him it's a podcast he did it's a two-hour podcast
[2:25:30.520 --> 2:25:37.160]  it was just brilliant and it really exposes the underbelly of this reporting system and essentially
[2:25:37.160 --> 2:25:43.000]  what he did he did a number of different analytical approaches like two or three different strategies
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:48.360]  and they all came to the same conclusion that the the number was being reported by under reported by
[2:25:48.360 --> 2:25:56.120]  number of 41 times 41 times so he said conservatively that's 200 to 250 000 but if you multiply that's
[2:25:56.120 --> 2:26:04.360]  16 000 times 41 you come up with 650 000 deaths deaths in the united states we are right now
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:09.720]  getting close to the number of deaths who who supposedly died from covid and and these are
[2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:14.440]  just massively suppressed and just to give an example of this to validate this there was a
[2:26:14.440 --> 2:26:24.280]  local abc news affiliate who put on social media a request for people to submit reports of those who
[2:26:24.280 --> 2:26:30.920]  were unvaccinated and died from covid right well it totally backfired 100 backfired them
[2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:40.600]  because they had over 250 000 people comment with deaths and injury reports from the vaccine
[2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:46.120]  or the jab but i mean it's not a vaccine so i'm sorry for confusing the two no that's right
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:50.920]  in fact it was over 300 000 and i think they finally took it down the the station said
[2:26:50.920 --> 2:26:55.240]  tell us your stories of loved ones that got sick or died that didn't take the shot and instead it was
[2:26:55.240 --> 2:27:01.480]  99 percent the other way just incredible under yeah i'm just shocked that they let it go up so long
[2:27:01.480 --> 2:27:06.520]  i mean it's just i cannot believe they let it continue yeah so it was 300 000 i you know i
[2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:10.520]  didn't have the most current stats but i'm there you know no no me no but by the time i saw it was
[2:27:10.520 --> 2:27:17.320]  over 300 000 that's just crazy yeah it is i mean that's an absolute and obviously not everyone saw
[2:27:17.320 --> 2:27:22.120]  that link so that was just a small fraction of the people who truly injured so you can easily
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:26.840]  understand that we could be looking at a half more than half a million people dead from from the jab
[2:27:26.840 --> 2:27:33.560]  already and we don't even know because and they bastardized they totally distort the definition
[2:27:33.560 --> 2:27:39.320]  of who is vaccinated so the cdc recently changed that whole definition so you cannot be classified
[2:27:39.320 --> 2:27:47.160]  as fully vaccinated until two weeks after your last jab right the second jab if there's if there's
[2:27:47.160 --> 2:27:52.760]  it's a two-dose regimen so 80 percent of the injuries and deaths occur in the first two weeks
[2:27:53.400 --> 2:27:58.920]  so they're totally manipulating the statistics and hiding them it's it's an intentional fraud
[2:27:59.480 --> 2:28:06.760]  to to to to mask the true amount of death and disability so that is important information
[2:28:06.760 --> 2:28:10.120]  everyone needs to understand it in the next segment i want to go into some of the practical
[2:28:10.120 --> 2:28:15.160]  things i'm sure other people have gone over but i just want to highlight some some useful strategies
[2:28:15.160 --> 2:28:19.480]  that people can use to build themselves up and what can you do to safeguard ourselves this is all
[2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:25.000]  not doom and gloom but this is a serious threat and we need to be in that in that 80 million people
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:30.120]  who haven't gotten the jab yet we need to be in that group because that group is is everly dimension
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:35.880]  because of unconstitutional executive orders uh you know mandating companies with more than a
[2:28:35.880 --> 2:28:41.640]  hundred people to get to get the jab right we're going to have to stand together because if the
[2:28:41.640 --> 2:28:47.560]  corporate dictatorship is able worldwide to force us to take these shots then we won't be the control
[2:28:47.560 --> 2:28:52.200]  group or the other group to show that that the vaccine wasn't indeed not a vaccine and a poison
[2:28:52.200 --> 2:28:58.440]  bio-web and we'll be right back with Dr. Joseph McCullough if you're concerned about the power
[2:28:58.440 --> 2:29:03.880]  grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity this will be the most important
[2:29:03.880 --> 2:29:09.720]  message you'll hear this year here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in
[2:29:09.720 --> 2:29:15.640]  stock these emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most
[2:29:15.640 --> 2:29:21.720]  and unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly emit no dangerous fumes and produce an
[2:29:21.720 --> 2:29:26.920]  endless supply of free electricity from the sun whether it's wildfires dangerous whether power
[2:29:26.920 --> 2:29:32.440]  grid issues or just getting off the grid you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages

[2:30:56.200 --> 2:31:04.200]  if your ruthless mega corporations have taken over almost every government on earth and who are
[2:31:04.200 --> 2:31:09.720]  trying to destroy the middle class in any form of upper mobility you've got to divide and conquer the
[2:31:09.720 --> 2:31:15.240]  public so they don't know they're being targeted and that's why the fortune 100 have wrapped themselves
[2:31:15.240 --> 2:31:21.240]  the name of lbgt and african-american rights and all the rest of it all over the world that's now
[2:31:21.240 --> 2:31:26.040]  their corporate face while they run slave camps in africa and in communist china and many other
[2:31:26.040 --> 2:31:31.080]  areas while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through the big tech in
[2:31:31.080 --> 2:31:35.960]  the central banks and other zone so this is a criminal takeover and when you look at the new
[2:31:37.240 --> 2:31:43.240]  superclass it's the politicians it's the corporate media it's the police it's the bureaucrats it's
[2:31:43.240 --> 2:31:47.640]  members of congress and their staff and their families it's the white house hell it's postal
[2:31:47.640 --> 2:31:54.200]  workers who are all exempt from the poison shots but not the general public and everybody else
[2:31:54.200 --> 2:31:59.480]  through corporate rule so this is the true discrimination that's going on could you imagine
[2:31:59.480 --> 2:32:05.400]  a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered could you imagine even going into the
[2:32:05.400 --> 2:32:09.480]  grocery store do you think they would let you in do you think they would be following you in the
[2:32:09.480 --> 2:32:15.800]  aisles to make sure that you weren't going to be shoplifting could you imagine going up to a gas
[2:32:15.800 --> 2:32:21.160]  station and going inside the little mini mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on how far do you
[2:32:21.160 --> 2:32:25.960]  think that would get you could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with it with a shield
[2:32:25.960 --> 2:32:34.520]  that looks like a space alien those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal
[2:32:34.520 --> 2:32:39.320]  human interaction the globalists are running a psychological warfare operation on humanity
[2:32:39.320 --> 2:32:45.160]  only waking up to the great reset in its tyranny will save us and the mask is the sign of slavery
[2:32:45.160 --> 2:32:49.320]  we must inform the public that it's a fraud and that it's dangerous and that it causes major
[2:32:49.320 --> 2:32:54.360]  medical issues and it's dehumanizing and the film covenland does that secure your copy now at

[2:33:16.760 --> 2:33:26.840]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:33:27.480 --> 2:33:32.520]  so we got the guy that the rockefellers and bill gates and the whole eugenics big poison
[2:33:32.520 --> 2:33:37.880]  pharma combine that's been trying to take over american medicine for 130 years 140 years
[2:33:40.520 --> 2:33:45.240]  is their number one enemy you've got the guy they hate the most when it comes to this and
[2:33:45.240 --> 2:33:50.040]  you see their whole takeover is this the world id the control system so i want you to get into
[2:33:51.320 --> 2:33:57.400]  where you see this going and practical things and positive things but why do they really hate you
[2:33:57.400 --> 2:34:02.680]  the most and then expand on that because i know why it's because you're credible you show everything
[2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:06.600]  you're talking about you've got tens of millions people follow you've been around 25 years doing
[2:34:06.600 --> 2:34:11.960]  this i've been interviewing you for 25 years you feel like your friend you're a good friend but
[2:34:11.960 --> 2:34:17.160]  when we pull back from this you're also really good explaining why they're doing it and and and
[2:34:17.160 --> 2:34:21.080]  what their motivations are and how bill gates have the halo removed from him recently and i
[2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:27.400]  guess it's been moved over to the ceo of uh phyzer and and just show the 35 000 foot view here
[2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:30.920]  dr mccola and then get back into whatever you want to cover but i want your view on this
[2:34:30.920 --> 2:34:37.880]  about their overall agenda and how it's going for them and uh how you think we stop them well i don't
[2:34:37.880 --> 2:34:42.840]  claim to have insights as to their motivations any special insights and it's just mere speculation
[2:34:42.840 --> 2:34:48.440]  but i suspect that they're targeting me that they're putting so much focus on me and discrediting me
[2:34:48.440 --> 2:34:53.160]  and taking me out of the potentially taking me out is that i've been a for the reason you just
[2:34:53.160 --> 2:34:57.480]  cited i've been around for a long time i was an early adopter i was on the internet before google
[2:34:57.480 --> 2:35:04.200]  was and uh as a result i've developed a pretty large following and incredible and i don't really
[2:35:04.200 --> 2:35:08.200]  have any black strikes against me except the ones that they create themselves with their
[2:35:08.200 --> 2:35:13.400]  own laws i mean it's just just the excuse they took to get us off of google we had no strikes
[2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:21.480]  against us no violations we never put up any videos about coven not one on youtube and they just
[2:35:21.480 --> 2:35:26.920]  changed the whole rule set says oh if you ever put up a negative vaccine a negative video about a
[2:35:26.920 --> 2:35:33.960]  vaccine we can take we we we have justification remove you boom gone you know uh and i've been on
[2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:41.640]  newt was on youtube for since the beginning like 2005 six i mean really early on so yeah anyway i
[2:35:41.640 --> 2:35:45.800]  think because i'm a credible threat and people believe me that's that's the reason they're
[2:35:45.800 --> 2:35:50.280]  focusing on me although that's the only thing i can speculate but i i don't know what you know
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:54.840]  what what their beliefs i don't think that's speculation i mean i that that's exactly what's
[2:35:54.840 --> 2:35:59.000]  happened yeah yeah we're putting a lot of efforts and resources to accomplish it but i just wanted
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:04.760]  to finish up on that one one strap that one executive the unconstitutional executive order
[2:36:04.760 --> 2:36:12.920]  that biden uh i think was two weeks ago instituted which it may not be enforced because it i think
[2:36:12.920 --> 2:36:17.320]  ultimately has to be it's done through osha and osha is typically administered through at the state
[2:36:17.320 --> 2:36:22.200]  level so you know i think many states will not enforce it but if they do the panel i don't
[2:36:22.200 --> 2:36:26.040]  know if you probably i'm sure you're aware of it i mean you're so up on most of these political
[2:36:26.040 --> 2:36:31.720]  things but the initial thought was that you were going to get a 17 thousand dollar fine a day then
[2:36:31.720 --> 2:36:38.600]  it went to 70 thousand now i believe in the latest 700 thousand built that 700 thousand dollars a day
[2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:45.160]  i mean maybe just i think it's a day so essentially the employer has no choice i mean he does have a
[2:36:45.160 --> 2:36:50.360]  choice he can either implement the mandate or go out of business because there's not many companies
[2:36:50.360 --> 2:36:55.800]  that can buy 700 thousand dollar penalties isn't this really just toto the man behind the curtain
[2:36:56.680 --> 2:37:00.840]  the more they threaten us you better do it the great and powerful os and then i mean
[2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:09.320]  now we won't give you a kidney transplant it's just amazing it is comical when you think about it
[2:37:09.320 --> 2:37:16.520]  that's it's a really good analogy you know the wizard of os for sure so uh yeah you know they're
[2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:20.600]  trying to pull the levers but you know they're not that but smart and you can just see in their
[2:37:20.600 --> 2:37:26.280]  discrediting campaign towards me it's just totally backfired 100 backfire our readership doubled my
[2:37:26.280 --> 2:37:32.200]  book was a massive success because they're there they believe that any anything they say that people
[2:37:32.200 --> 2:37:35.640]  are going to believe and there's there's a huge segment of the population and most of them are
[2:37:35.640 --> 2:37:40.920]  listening to you 30 or 40 percent who understand the truth who aren't brainwashed and that they
[2:37:40.920 --> 2:37:45.640]  recognize when the mainstream vilify someone it's a classic or willing double speaking it's the
[2:37:45.640 --> 2:37:50.120]  exact opposite of what they say so i'm not the spreader of misinformation i'm just according
[2:37:50.120 --> 2:37:56.600]  to them i'm the biggest spreader of vaccine truth so you know i that's why i'm so pleased to have
[2:37:56.600 --> 2:38:00.680]  been in their sights because you know that's really one of the highest honors i've ever gotten on my
[2:38:00.680 --> 2:38:07.000]  life to be recognized as someone who has integrity and is willing to to be to take the hurls that
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:11.080]  they have to throw at me so i'm fine for that but anyway i want to get back and put positive
[2:38:11.080 --> 2:38:16.040]  focus things that we can do so what are the three number a few powerful things you need to do winter
[2:38:16.040 --> 2:38:21.560]  is coming i have published a paper that they totally ignored it was in october of 2020 that
[2:38:21.560 --> 2:38:27.720]  reviewed the value of vitamin d there's hundreds of references it's available at stopcovidcold.com
[2:38:27.720 --> 2:38:32.200]  you can get it downloaded for free it's it's a peer reviewed it's it's on pub med you just type
[2:38:32.200 --> 2:38:37.400]  in my name or colon vitamin d and it'll come up and the the bottom line is is that's the
[2:38:37.400 --> 2:38:42.120]  scientific justification for the use of this because when you have adequate vitamin d levels
[2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:48.280]  you simply almost impossible to die from covid almost no one dies from covid who has optimal
[2:38:48.280 --> 2:38:53.240]  vitamin d levels so i saw another big mainline study that's something like 84 of people that
[2:38:53.800 --> 2:38:58.680]  died of covid had vitamin d deficiency exactly what you were saying on my show a year ago
[2:38:59.720 --> 2:39:06.200]  yeah yeah 100 it's even higher it's actually like 96 percent in some studies so yeah you just
[2:39:06.200 --> 2:39:10.760]  got to get it so how do you get it ideally you live in sub tropical areas and you go out in your
[2:39:10.760 --> 2:39:16.680]  swimming suit at solar noon most 90 probably 97 99 percent people are unable to do that even if they
[2:39:16.680 --> 2:39:19.800]  live there they can't go out at noon and that's what you were doing in florida when they were
[2:39:19.800 --> 2:39:25.480]  stalking you right out on your bike 100 you saw me you saw the video i am out in my shorts at solar
[2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:29.880]  noon walking the beach that's why i haven't swallowed vitamin d in over 10 years and my vitamin
[2:39:29.880 --> 2:39:36.920]  d levels are perfect so but if you most everyone is unable to do that so if you're an adult
[2:39:37.800 --> 2:39:41.720]  you want to take at least 8 000 units a day and then get your blood level measured it's the only
[2:39:41.720 --> 2:39:45.720]  way you know if you're vitamin d aren't you in more danger if you're african-american or black
[2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:50.840]  because because they absorb less d yeah well no it's not that you're blessed but they get
[2:39:50.840 --> 2:39:55.480]  less from the sun so they're more at risk so they typically have lower levels and that's
[2:39:55.480 --> 2:40:00.200]  definitely one of the risk factors for covid so they if anyone they there's really important for
[2:40:00.200 --> 2:40:05.400]  them uh to to measure their vitamin d levels it's absolutely imperative it's crazy now too because
[2:40:05.400 --> 2:40:10.280]  not only does it reduce radically reduce your risk for covid almost eliminates it but it also
[2:40:11.480 --> 2:40:16.120]  decreases your risk for cancer heart disease obesity that's right so jesse jackson and al
[2:40:16.120 --> 2:40:20.520]  sharpton all they really cared about quote black people they would be telling them up there not
[2:40:20.520 --> 2:40:25.000]  that the poor white guy working at the gas station is their enemy they would be saying you need vitamin
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:31.080]  d right now 100 so you need about 8 000 units if you're really overweight it might be 10 might be
[2:40:31.080 --> 2:40:35.320]  15 000 but the only way to know is to test your blood it's not a terribly expensive test and you
[2:40:35.320 --> 2:40:38.840]  don't even need a doctor's order to get it you can get it online from many places we have it on our
[2:40:38.840 --> 2:40:44.840]  site but there's a lot of places that offer it so uh get your d tested that's the first important
[2:40:44.840 --> 2:40:50.040]  things and we're running out of time but i can tell you some some of the other interventions if
[2:40:50.040 --> 2:40:55.480]  this is mostly a preventive so if you come down to your cutely ill this is not the greatest strategy
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:41:02.040]  although many protocols suggest administering 10 20 30 50 000 units of vitamin d all at once
[2:41:02.040 --> 2:41:05.480]  but ideally you want to have high vitamin d because if you have high vitamin d levels you
[2:41:05.480 --> 2:41:11.240]  won't get it in the first place so the the next step is if you become acutely ill what can you do
[2:41:11.240 --> 2:41:16.920]  and there's so many strategies that you can use but one of my favorite is nebulized peroxide and
[2:41:16.920 --> 2:41:21.240]  i've been put through the ringer this week because the large portions of the media have been
[2:41:21.240 --> 2:41:26.040]  blasted me for this because there's a national asthma association to come out says you cannot
[2:41:26.040 --> 2:41:30.680]  nebulize peroxide it's dangerous and toxic and you're foolish if you do so all the media picked
[2:41:30.680 --> 2:41:36.520]  up on it and they had no justification no evidence no studies to support their role tell us doctor
[2:41:36.520 --> 2:41:44.280]  what does nebulize hydrogen peroxide do well it it it kills the infection if you have other medical
[2:41:44.280 --> 2:41:49.320]  doctors on and that's what they said they said even mouthwash and neti potting with stuff is good
[2:41:49.320 --> 2:41:54.120]  because then it doesn't get a foothold right yeah you just want to make sure you use the right
[2:41:54.120 --> 2:41:58.600]  concentration you don't want to overdo it the normal peroxide you buy in the grocery store
[2:41:58.600 --> 2:42:02.920]  the pharmacy is like three percent you want to use a diluted version of that like 30 times lower
[2:42:02.920 --> 2:42:08.360]  so if you put like a tablespoon in a pint of normal saline or water that would be the one you
[2:42:08.360 --> 2:42:12.280]  can use and and also the saline or the salt concentration of the water is really important
[2:42:12.280 --> 2:42:17.800]  there are studies that show just using in nebulizing saline and nothing else will help
[2:42:17.800 --> 2:42:22.360]  so and you're you know why they hate you because you're just giving people common sense and explaining
[2:42:22.360 --> 2:42:27.240]  it and and instead of being negative and attacking the globalist you mainly run around everywhere
[2:42:27.240 --> 2:42:33.080]  telling people about vitamin d and c and zinc and exercise in the sun and they just hate your
[2:42:33.080 --> 2:42:36.600]  guts because you're telling that they really want to kill black folks for whatever reason they
[2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:39.720]  aren't you're also telling black folks they better get vitamin d3 that's why they don't like your
[2:42:39.720 --> 2:42:43.640]  daughter because you're trying to save people we're right back with final segment dr josep
[2:42:43.640 --> 2:42:49.800]  mccola uh as we just fight these maniac murdering big pharma crazy people that are signing us all

[2:45:58.920 --> 2:46:04.040]  i want to explain something that is absolutely heat understanding our world it's very very simple
[2:46:04.040 --> 2:46:10.440]  but the most people don't know the privately owned central banks of the world are artificially
[2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:17.160]  creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and using them to buy up
[2:46:17.160 --> 2:46:24.360]  infrastructure intellectual property energy they're usually have to buy people to buy influence
[2:46:25.080 --> 2:46:29.720]  and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that
[2:46:29.720 --> 2:46:34.440]  manipulate markets but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or
[2:46:34.440 --> 2:46:39.640]  would cause massive inflation now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every
[2:46:39.640 --> 2:46:45.400]  sector of the world economy buying up everything not to have the companies operate but to actually
[2:46:45.400 --> 2:46:50.280]  shut them down and force the collapse of civilization making the companies they do

[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:35.080]  action dr mccullough we got about nine or eight minutes left other key points you'd like to impart
[2:49:35.080 --> 2:49:40.200]  to the viewers and listeners yeah sure the one of the point i neglected to mention is the uh
[2:49:40.200 --> 2:49:45.880]  discrediting campaign was seeking to use the fact that i published this book to make a lot of money
[2:49:45.880 --> 2:49:51.480]  and most as you know very well know most books don't make any money you actually lose money
[2:49:51.480 --> 2:49:56.920]  because all the energy put in yeah but this book has been so successful that we're getting close to
[2:49:56.920 --> 2:50:00.840]  a million copies you know we have significant revenues but i pulled the rug from under because
[2:50:00.840 --> 2:50:06.520]  i was donating all the profits to national vaccine information center so that was good
[2:50:06.520 --> 2:50:11.640]  but i want to i want to focus on extend the conversation by the way not trying to kiss
[2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:15.160]  your butt people didn't know you're a warrior and there's an example of good men and women
[2:50:15.160 --> 2:50:20.120]  fighting back you were out of all the millions of people you were at the heart with your network
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:27.000]  having the courage to help expose that indeed roundup uh and uh those systems were causing all
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:32.760]  sorts of cancers and problems so this isn't your first rodeo taken on goliath no no absolutely
[2:50:32.760 --> 2:50:37.720]  not it's it's not my first right so i just want to continue with the nebulized process because i
[2:50:37.720 --> 2:50:43.320]  think it is the single most powerful intervention uh and i got a lot of public exposure this week
[2:50:43.320 --> 2:50:48.840]  because of it so i do have videos on it but they're at bit chute bit chute.com you just have to type
[2:50:48.840 --> 2:50:53.560]  in my name and peroxide merkola and peroxide you'll see all the interviews i did have done
[2:50:53.560 --> 2:50:56.760]  and there's instructions there but let me just consolidate it for you make it real easy you
[2:50:56.760 --> 2:51:01.320]  need a real a real nebulizer real nebulizer is the one you plug in the wall the one i use is the
[2:51:01.320 --> 2:51:08.600]  peri-tech or peri-trek p-a-r-i-t-r-e-k is on amazon snow filling you just go to amazon and they make
[2:51:08.600 --> 2:51:14.280]  the fish tank pump noise yeah yeah and they've got a little nebulized streams it comes up though
[2:51:14.280 --> 2:51:19.080]  you could use a battery operator but they're not as good so i recommend that it's 70 bucks you know
[2:51:19.080 --> 2:51:23.640]  it's pretty inexpensive and then the peroxide you want to get is food great ideally and you get that
[2:51:23.640 --> 2:51:29.800]  on amazon too you just don't want to use it concentrated so it should be 0.1 percent and
[2:51:29.800 --> 2:51:33.960]  the way you get that concentration is you get a pint of water most people have a pint container
[2:51:33.960 --> 2:51:39.800]  make sure it's ultra clean water either stilled or highly purified you put in a tablespoon of three
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:46.840]  percent peroxide into a pint of water and then you put in one tablespoon or if you want a
[2:51:46.840 --> 2:51:52.600]  hyper tonic solution you can put two or three tablespoons of high quality salt you mix it up
[2:51:52.600 --> 2:51:58.680]  and then you put just a like a teaspoon of that solution after it's dissolved into the nebulizer
[2:51:58.680 --> 2:52:02.360]  and you nebulize that over five or five or ten minutes and by the way as you know Dr. Richard
[2:52:02.360 --> 2:52:05.880]  Bartley you probably know him he's an advisor to Rick Perry and now the current governor the main
[2:52:05.880 --> 2:52:10.440]  your advisor uh he's been saying the same stuff that you're saying in their studies out there
[2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:15.320]  that this is antiviral so the idea that we shouldn't be cleaning our sinus or or cleaning
[2:52:15.320 --> 2:52:21.080]  our bronchioles is just asinine they want to sick they want us dying yeah it has even better
[2:52:21.080 --> 2:52:26.680]  benefits because it seems to improve your microbiome your gut flora and so that's why i do it at least
[2:52:26.680 --> 2:52:31.080]  every other day you could even do it once a day but if you're sick you can do it like every hour
[2:52:31.080 --> 2:52:35.320]  or two i mean it really isn't like no downside to it you just want to make sure the concentration
[2:52:35.320 --> 2:52:40.600]  is right it needs to be diluted like one 30th of the three percent so that's a powerful thing do
[2:52:40.600 --> 2:52:45.080]  it get it order it you don't want to be searching around not having your home absolutely ready to
[2:52:45.080 --> 2:52:49.880]  use it when you need it or a friend or family i always travel with this and i usually wind up
[2:52:49.880 --> 2:52:54.440]  treating someone when i'm traveling so i have bought 50 of these for friends and family the
[2:52:54.440 --> 2:52:58.440]  last six months and with the bedesta diet and all the rest of Dr. Bartlett literally saved
[2:52:58.440 --> 2:53:03.480]  something lives it's incredible yeah yeah so that's the first thing and then if you do get sick
[2:53:03.480 --> 2:53:08.760]  zinc is usually pretty good 15 milligrams is a normal dose but you want to go up to 50 for a
[2:53:08.760 --> 2:53:15.160]  few days if you're acutely sick and you want to drive it into the cells and what that's how
[2:53:15.160 --> 2:53:19.640]  hydroxychloroquine works we think it's and but there's what's your view on ivermectin
[2:53:19.640 --> 2:53:30.200]  yeah ivermectin is i am sort of opposed to drugs so but as drugs go it doesn't get much safer i
[2:53:30.200 --> 2:53:35.160]  think it's like four billion or 40 billion doses they administered which virtually no side effects
[2:53:35.160 --> 2:53:41.160]  are toxicity unless you overdose on it but it did the regular doses is pretty safe so if you notice
[2:53:41.160 --> 2:53:46.760]  the new Pfizer pill has some of the same molecules and and makeup as as the so-called horse base
[2:53:46.760 --> 2:53:55.240]  well the horse base is derogatory time i'm being sarcastic yeah sure but uh no it's a useful
[2:53:55.240 --> 2:54:00.040]  useful strategy so that's something you can do and then i think you know more important maybe
[2:54:00.040 --> 2:54:05.000]  just as importantly is to understand that there are psychological threshold and and perspective
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:10.120]  is so important that we really want to resist this we've got to resist this we simply can't
[2:54:10.120 --> 2:54:14.120]  submit to the pressures even it means putting your job and for many of you it's going to be that
[2:54:14.120 --> 2:54:17.960]  you're going to have to quit and find a new job and just recognize that this is like an
[2:54:17.960 --> 2:54:21.320]  inverse paranoid that looks like the worst thing you're like but it may be the best thing in your
[2:54:21.320 --> 2:54:27.160]  life you just have to appreciate that understand it and believe it and do just avoid you or anyone
[2:54:27.160 --> 2:54:33.640]  in your family anyone you love or care for to not ever get the jab or a booster you just can't get
[2:54:33.640 --> 2:54:39.240]  those because you there's like little to no doubt in my mind and uh vladimir's uncle strongly
[2:54:39.240 --> 2:54:46.280]  believe this week fact he calls it the kill shot you know that is a classic uh genocidal agenda
[2:54:46.280 --> 2:54:51.560]  that they have so you want to stay away from that and you want to resist peacefully you know you
[2:54:51.560 --> 2:54:56.120]  want it's peaceful civil disobedience is what we want to do we do not want to have violent
[2:54:56.120 --> 2:55:01.160]  aggressive action you don't want to be shooting people you just got to peacefully resist and and
[2:55:01.160 --> 2:55:06.520]  persist in and saying no to this intervention it's going to be and it's going to be hard because
[2:55:06.520 --> 2:55:12.120]  you have to you know people need a source of income to pay for their food and rent uh and
[2:55:12.120 --> 2:55:16.200]  regardless we got to build a new america a new world that's what we built this country to begin with
[2:55:16.200 --> 2:55:20.200]  when tyranny's oppressing you have to build new businesses all these doctors all these all these
[2:55:20.200 --> 2:55:23.640]  scientists all these nurses getting fired i know a lot of them they're going creating their own
[2:55:23.640 --> 2:55:28.840]  clinics their own systems and so we're going to have to have a real revolution of just right
[2:55:28.840 --> 2:55:34.360]  action and in good living against this hundred percent and and this whole system may self collapse
[2:55:34.360 --> 2:55:41.400]  because if you if if people continue to say no the economy the the the structure the social
[2:55:41.400 --> 2:55:48.760]  structure of the society cannot continue if all these people say no and they're out of a job i
[2:55:48.760 --> 2:55:53.320]  mean how can the health care system if all the nurses quit it's not going to work you i mean
[2:55:53.320 --> 2:56:00.280]  look what the new york that the new york governor did she fired all the un unvaccinated unjabbed
[2:56:00.280 --> 2:56:03.560]  health care workers in new york and they have in the national guard coming in now can you do
[2:56:03.560 --> 2:56:08.600]  that's not going to work it will fail miserably and and the society will collapse if all these
[2:56:08.600 --> 2:56:12.440]  people are out of job not doing the left are collapsing themselves your book is available

[2:58:28.760 --> 2:58:33.400]  this is criminal and he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine when they did not approve it
[2:58:33.400 --> 2:58:38.840]  they say that's a 20 25 maybe they just expanded the emergency authorization that's why the two

[3:00:08.760 --> 3:00:16.440]  hey dally takes over in t-minus six minutes but i wanted to just talk about a few things here
[3:00:16.440 --> 3:00:20.840]  first before we end this broadcast i want to thank the great crew for the work they do
[3:00:20.840 --> 3:00:24.280]  i want to thank the viewers i want to thank the listeners for making this broadcast possible
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:29.320]  and i just want to let everybody know that i'm sorry i've reported such horrible news here but
[3:00:29.320 --> 3:00:33.240]  i don't do it to depress you i do it so you know the real attacks going on so we have a chance to
[3:00:33.240 --> 3:00:38.120]  beat these monsters there's always evil groups trying to take over throughout history there's
[3:00:38.120 --> 3:00:42.680]  always good people that finally figure it out and wake up and take action against it the only question
[3:00:42.680 --> 3:00:48.200]  is how long is that going to take now let me just say something here because it's one of the most
[3:00:48.200 --> 3:00:55.480]  asked questions i get people say all the time to me on the street alex if you're a good guy how are
[3:00:55.480 --> 3:01:02.040]  you still alive well what does that mean you don't judge whether i'm a good guy and i'm for real off
[3:01:02.040 --> 3:01:09.320]  of if i'm alive or not you judge it off of do i tell the truth am i accurate 95 96 97 98 percent
[3:01:09.320 --> 3:01:14.840]  of the time have i been on air almost 30 years and what is your gut what does your spirit tell you
[3:01:14.840 --> 3:01:23.000]  on top of that plus the idea that if alex jones was for real he'd be dead is a loser mentality i
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:28.840]  trust in god and i'll be alive as long as god wants me to be alive plus i understand history
[3:01:30.520 --> 3:01:36.120]  garrison the d a in new orleans who exposed the fact that they really assassinated kennedy and
[3:01:36.120 --> 3:01:40.600]  got all those congressional hearings going and totally you know they exposed the system and got
[3:01:40.600 --> 3:01:50.040]  sued by cia operatives and won he said i'm alive because i stay in the sunshine and i'm out in
[3:01:50.040 --> 3:01:55.640]  the open they threatened his family they attacked him they did all these terrible things but he kept
[3:01:55.640 --> 3:02:01.560]  fighting and so that's why i'm still here but there's another big reason not to be in the sunshine
[3:02:01.560 --> 3:02:06.840]  god of course is the main reason but also because there's so many good people that's why when i see
[3:02:06.840 --> 3:02:11.560]  tucker curls in the last 10 years get more and more awake or joe rogan or countless others
[3:02:11.560 --> 3:02:17.080]  or glenn beck starting to get you know really totally woke i mean when i see stuff like that
[3:02:17.640 --> 3:02:22.360]  that's not competition for me i get excited that's what's going to protect me and my family
[3:02:22.360 --> 3:02:27.080]  so i've told you this a hundred times probably this year already and thousands of times over
[3:02:27.080 --> 3:02:32.280]  the years my job is to become obsolete my job is to turn the tide against tyranny and things be so
[3:02:32.280 --> 3:02:36.520]  good and people know what i know about the new world order and how to stop it and how they operate
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:43.720]  to such an extent that i have become passe i have become redundant i have become
[3:02:45.720 --> 3:02:49.720]  where i don't even you know really matter anymore because it's it's accepted knowledge
[3:02:50.680 --> 3:02:55.160]  so you've been attacked you've been a demon eyes for supporting liberty so have i it's okay
[3:02:55.160 --> 3:02:59.080]  god's watching and that's all that matters and we've been vindicated now
[3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:03.000]  by the horror that's happening i don't want to be vindicated anymore by more of where we know
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:08.360]  this goes we have their own documents we have operation lockstep we have the spars event we have
[3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:14.600]  it all and then separately there's so many great people like marcolla and countless others that
[3:03:14.600 --> 3:03:19.480]  have been awake as long as i've been or longer and so there's millions of people black white
[3:03:19.480 --> 3:03:24.280]  hispanic asian old young who all are understanding what's happening and now they're speaking up more
[3:03:24.280 --> 3:03:29.800]  than ever so all of you are the answer all of you speaking out of the answer and and separately
[3:03:30.760 --> 3:03:35.320]  we're helping so many people the corporations aren't all bad the government's not all bad it's
[3:03:35.320 --> 3:03:40.040]  just people like us it's who's in control at the top so we have a lot of friends in the system as
[3:03:40.040 --> 3:03:44.920]  well who don't want to see alex jones dead or put in prison or oh and put in prison but they're sure
[3:03:44.920 --> 3:03:50.120]  as hell try them or even get rid of jury trials for us so we're at the tip of the spear i am

[3:04:53.480 --> 3:05:01.480]  funding info war a 360 win and in addition we were really finding that we were stressing the
[3:05:01.480 --> 3:05:06.760]  cardiopulmonary systems of these employees because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert
[3:05:06.760 --> 3:05:12.120]  physical energy during your work during your tasks whatever it might be you're really stressing
[3:05:12.120 --> 3:05:16.280]  the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you breathe you have to forcibly
[3:05:16.280 --> 3:05:22.600]  inhale and forcibly exhale that taxes the heart it taxes the lungs and we have given people heart
[3:05:22.600 --> 3:05:28.600]  attacks by allowing them to work with their mouth and nose covered with absolutely no
[3:05:28.600 --> 3:05:35.000]  regulation no oversight no medical oversight the globalists have told us we're a disease
[3:05:35.000 --> 3:05:38.920]  they've told us they want to eradicate us and all the studies show that when you wear these masks
[3:05:38.920 --> 3:05:45.160]  it lowers your oxygen level up to one third and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide
[3:05:45.160 --> 3:05:50.040]  poisoning this is a sick cult and we've got to say no but the only way the real science because
[3:05:50.040 --> 3:06:10.040]  that's the public is if we tell them get your copy today of covenland and expose them it's covenland.com go there now okay
[3:06:20.760 --> 3:06:25.320]  hi there i'm k dally your guest host and so appreciate this time with you
[3:06:25.320 --> 3:06:30.840]  in fact today i really want to go through some damning pieces of evidence some hard evidence
[3:06:30.840 --> 3:06:35.960]  that you can't ignore no matter who you are and also probably things you might want to share with
[3:06:35.960 --> 3:06:42.280]  those that might not understand what's happening in america right now so i'm happy to be here on
[3:06:42.280 --> 3:06:47.400]  the alex jones show you can go to kdallyshow.com and you can get all of the notes but let's start
[3:06:47.400 --> 3:06:52.840]  off because we have so many things to discuss and these are damning pieces of evidence number one
[3:06:52.840 --> 3:07:00.280]  i want to tell you there is no executive order for any companies over 100 employees let me say
[3:07:00.280 --> 3:07:06.840]  that again there is no executive order there is nothing in writing there is nothing regarding osha
[3:07:06.840 --> 3:07:14.600]  when it comes to this mandate for a vaccine and i think everyone needs to know that because i think
[3:07:14.600 --> 3:07:20.520]  people think it's well it's coming and there's the threat of it coming and and uh yes you know it's
[3:07:20.520 --> 3:07:26.440]  on its way there is nothing right now that would make all of these companies do what they're doing
[3:07:26.440 --> 3:07:31.400]  to people the hospitals the city workers state workers are getting letters and and uh it's just
[3:07:31.400 --> 3:07:38.120]  so sad to me uh that we are buying into this in fact uh in fact they said in forbes uh this is a
[3:07:38.120 --> 3:07:43.720]  great piece they said if enacted into law vaccine enforcement could bankrupt non-compliant companies
[3:07:43.720 --> 3:07:49.640]  even more quickly um than the osha finds anticipated under biden's announced mandate but still it
[3:07:49.640 --> 3:07:54.920]  hasn't even happened yet this is really important information thanks to john rapaport he brought
[3:07:54.920 --> 3:08:01.560]  this forward and i also uh wanted to say that there have only been nine times in osha's history of 50
[3:08:02.200 --> 3:08:09.800]  years where they have actually administered what's called an emergency temporary standard it's called
[3:08:09.800 --> 3:08:15.800]  an ets and this is to enact a new requirement well all of these are primarily about chemicals
[3:08:15.800 --> 3:08:22.600]  being used nothing that takes away our god given right to our body immunity and honestly the fear
[3:08:22.600 --> 3:08:28.600]  is is that they would never win in court to subject companies to fines or do anything of the like
[3:08:28.600 --> 3:08:34.920]  when it comes to um any sort of mandate so people will win in court companies will win in court that's
[3:08:34.920 --> 3:08:40.760]  the good news and i just wanted to share that with you because these rules that they pass did you know
[3:08:40.760 --> 3:08:47.960]  that they actually have not won hardly any of them in fact uh they cannot prove grave danger so that
[3:08:47.960 --> 3:08:51.960]  would be the hook right that would be the thing that they would have to prove in order to get a
[3:08:51.960 --> 3:08:58.440]  company to do this they cannot do it and uh people will not i mean the people will win and the companies
[3:08:58.440 --> 3:09:03.560]  will win up against osha but there is nothing written for osha right now and i wanted people to
[3:09:03.560 --> 3:09:10.040]  understand their history because uh guys they have not uh they've been challenged in court on those nine
[3:09:10.040 --> 3:09:16.440]  and they've only won a couple of them yeah uh so they won't win and so companies need to fight this
[3:09:16.440 --> 3:09:23.560]  instead of going along with this um also number two i want to talk about the cdc manipulated
[3:09:24.200 --> 3:09:29.160]  counting of the vaccinated a lot of people have been asking me you know what's going on in these
[3:09:29.160 --> 3:09:34.600]  hospitals what's happening here because uh i don't understand why the hospitals can say they
[3:09:34.600 --> 3:09:41.640]  have all of these people that are unvaccinated in the hospital well there's a document that the cdc
[3:09:41.640 --> 3:09:47.880]  put out a media release uh it's called vaccination guidelines for the hospital and this is really
[3:09:47.880 --> 3:09:53.240]  interesting this is a quote from the document a person is considered fully vaccinated that's the
[3:09:53.240 --> 3:10:01.640]  keyword two weeks after receiving the last required dose of vaccine although vaccinations are accelerating
[3:10:01.640 --> 3:10:07.800]  they say cdc estimates it is 9.2 percent of the u.s population has been fully vaccinated
[3:10:07.800 --> 3:10:12.920]  with a cobit 19 vaccine okay when they wrote this this is this is the one that that still
[3:10:12.920 --> 3:10:20.200]  holds today this is why this is so damning they only count somebody that has had all the doses
[3:10:20.200 --> 3:10:26.840]  and 14 days post that if you had one shot you're unvaccinated if you had a shot and
[3:10:26.840 --> 3:10:32.840]  immediately had a heart attack two days later you're unvaccinated you are considered unvaccinated
[3:10:32.840 --> 3:10:39.000]  to these people and i find that pretty horrendous don't you so they're picking and choosing when they
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:44.680]  want to call somebody vaccinated when they consider them to be fully vaccinated and of course
[3:10:44.680 --> 3:10:49.800]  you know they can call it as they as they want to i guess the cdc's writing all the rules
[3:10:49.800 --> 3:10:55.880]  so this is really really important to know because as far as the numbers go it's probably why you're
[3:10:55.880 --> 3:11:02.760]  seeing a lot of these types of inflation of numbers in fact they actually came up with a very very
[3:11:02.760 --> 3:11:08.600]  strange sort of i don't know how to even describe it it was just kind of weird math
[3:11:08.600 --> 3:11:15.480]  that they used and one reporter said you know it's kind of like two ap reporters sat on a bar napkin
[3:11:15.480 --> 3:11:21.000]  and decided to um to kind of give you some assumptive numbers that they would work with
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:26.440]  and those assumptive numbers were in the 90s and so they made up this equation and the equation is
[3:11:26.440 --> 3:11:32.520]  so confusing that no one can figure it out and then of course they based their whole analysis
[3:11:32.520 --> 3:11:38.440]  on 13 different districts with all kinds of different types of reporting like hospital notes
[3:11:38.440 --> 3:11:46.680]  or hospital verbal count i mean absolutely stupid way of doing it but this is what they did and
[3:11:47.240 --> 3:11:55.000]  and so they actually they actually go through this as as they're discussing their documents
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:11:59.480]  and they're they're basically saying it's all assumptive they don't really have any proof
[3:12:00.600 --> 3:12:06.760]  these documents sort of kind of line out the fact that there's nothing really there to base it on
[3:12:06.760 --> 3:12:14.120]  it's just wild math wild math and then of course anybody that has a reaction
[3:12:14.120 --> 3:12:21.480]  right afterwards is not going to be counted in the in the in the final count of being vaccinated
[3:12:21.480 --> 3:12:28.360]  and so if you had both shots heart attack not counted that's how they're coming up with these
[3:12:28.360 --> 3:12:33.240]  numbers they're fudging them that's what they're doing all right so let's go to number three
[3:12:33.240 --> 3:12:42.760]  um number three um do they have a crystal ball and remdesivir fraud uh the dangerous treatment
[3:12:42.760 --> 3:12:48.680]  how in the world did they come up with this well there are uh videos to explain this and
[3:12:48.680 --> 3:12:54.200]  we'll get to those because this is this is super super important to understand we know that remdesivir
[3:12:54.200 --> 3:13:01.480]  now failed the ebola study right 54 percent mortality we know that this was chosen as the
[3:13:01.480 --> 3:13:07.800]  drug of choice and so the drug of choice of course um being one that was experimental
[3:13:07.800 --> 3:13:15.560]  did you know they didn't even uh give it an e a u until really solidly until october of 2020
[3:13:15.560 --> 3:13:22.120]  they were just continuing to use it bouchie even admits that uh that they were just kind of hoping
[3:13:22.120 --> 3:13:26.360]  it would work and they were going to go ahead and manufacture it hmm do you think he's in the
[3:13:26.360 --> 3:13:33.000]  pocket of gillian the ones that produced remdesivir and do they have a crystal ball back when we
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:42.520]  shut the nation down there were 15 deaths okay and in february he was already talking about
[3:13:42.520 --> 3:13:48.360]  we need a vaccine we are starting this trial we're doing this trial and here's the video
[3:13:49.720 --> 3:13:53.880]  one four percent you've been i think quoted a new england journal of medicine a few days ago
[3:13:53.880 --> 3:13:59.000]  is it well it's probably less than one percent no is that where do you where do you think so
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:04.840]  because we don't know the denominator but that's you said it sir yeah um if you look at the cases
[3:14:04.840 --> 3:14:10.200]  that have come to the attention of the medical authorities in china and you just do the math
[3:14:10.200 --> 3:14:19.400]  the math is about two percent if you look at well well there's uh there's Fauci for you
[3:14:19.400 --> 3:14:26.440]  uh so what happened was was they went ahead and they said remdesivir we think remdesivir is going
[3:14:26.440 --> 3:14:32.120]  to be the drug of choice now ask yourself this why did they ever need a vaccine then right out of
[3:14:32.120 --> 3:14:38.600]  the gate he was talking about a vaccine clear in january okay we have to have a vaccine but it
[3:14:38.600 --> 3:14:41.880]  puts a mystery why would you have to have a vaccine yet you don't even know what you're
[3:14:41.880 --> 3:14:47.320]  dealing with supposedly right so they come up with remdesivir and they start a trial
[3:14:47.320 --> 3:14:53.320]  february 21st but then they only had about a thousand people in this study and he called it
[3:14:53.320 --> 3:14:58.120]  high-powered in front of trump it was high-powered study do you want to know what the situation was
[3:14:58.120 --> 3:15:05.960]  though the most people that even had covid over just over 600 in china at the time and and and
[3:15:05.960 --> 3:15:11.960]  worldwide they were just stumbling on to their very first cases how did they even find that many
[3:15:11.960 --> 3:15:20.280]  people to study it on hmm interesting right and the united states we only had 153 supposed cases
[3:15:20.280 --> 3:15:26.280]  at the time and they actually admitted later that it was a fraudulent test as far as that goes
[3:15:26.280 --> 3:15:31.080]  there's no covid in this test but we'll get to that this is very interesting this crystal ball so
[3:15:31.080 --> 3:15:35.000]  i'm going to come back i want to talk about this with you because there are some things that go
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:40.360]  along with this this is all pieces of damning information people ask me for all the time in

[3:18:25.800 --> 3:18:31.000]  than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality faraday cages

[3:20:16.920 --> 3:20:21.960]  hi i'm k dally your guest host today big thank you to alex and uh i'll tell you what we have
[3:20:21.960 --> 3:20:26.920]  some damning information and i cannot wait to give this to you so let's continue on shall we
[3:20:28.120 --> 3:20:32.360]  i was talking about the fact that they have a crystal ball and this remdesivir fraud from
[3:20:32.360 --> 3:20:37.640]  the very beginning that the drug they had picked the vaccine that was already in in production
[3:20:37.640 --> 3:20:44.440]  to come up with the billions we'll get to that of doses right and so this is a clip of tony
[3:20:44.440 --> 3:20:57.240]  fauci in the white house with trump early on this was january 28th 2020 here you go
[3:21:00.200 --> 3:21:07.160]  we have already started at the nih and with many of our collaborators on the developing of a vaccine
[3:21:07.160 --> 3:21:13.400]  right now that's being prepared i anticipate with some cautious optimism that we will be in a phase
[3:21:13.400 --> 3:21:21.160]  one trial within the next three months an emerging infectious disease that has now reached
[3:21:21.160 --> 3:21:26.760]  outbreak proportions and likely pandemic proportions if you look at you know by multiple
[3:21:26.760 --> 3:21:34.200]  definitions of what a pandemic is the fact is this is multiple uh sustained transmissions of a
[3:21:34.200 --> 3:21:42.520]  highly infectious agent in multiple regions of the globe how did they know interesting right
[3:21:42.520 --> 3:21:47.720]  it was like he was all prepped and ready um so those clips came from march and uh
[3:21:47.720 --> 3:21:54.040]  and also in the white house on january 28th um he was already presenting this and talking about it
[3:21:54.040 --> 3:21:59.400]  i mean it was it was it's kind of amazing to me how he already knew knew the drug knew exactly
[3:21:59.400 --> 3:22:04.360]  what we're supposed to do except the drug wasn't good enough why not why did we need a vaccine
[3:22:04.360 --> 3:22:13.080]  right um also uh falchi stating that the mortality trended forward and data needed to be further
[3:22:13.080 --> 3:22:20.120]  analyzed uh to push remdesivir on the on the on the unknowing public really and this started
[3:22:20.120 --> 3:22:26.680]  february 21st how did they know which drug well they picked it and it had failed the Ebola study
[3:22:26.680 --> 3:22:35.400]  because of too many deaths well we had 30 uh let's see here uh let's go yeah we had 35 cases in
[3:22:36.280 --> 3:22:41.080]  in in the country early early on when he was already saying that we had to have a vaccine
[3:22:41.080 --> 3:22:48.600]  which is kind of crazy um so let's go to the savannah guthry clip of uh of the today's show
[3:22:48.600 --> 3:22:53.640]  when she was interviewing falchi this is interesting company that makes the drug
[3:22:53.640 --> 3:22:59.720]  uh has described a very complex process this is not easy it's not a pill it's intravenous
[3:22:59.720 --> 3:23:06.360]  it takes months and months to manufacture are you confident that enough can be out there soon
[3:23:06.360 --> 3:23:13.160]  enough to make a difference here well what i'm hearing savannah is that the company is really
[3:23:13.160 --> 3:23:18.840]  committed to get it out as much as they can as quickly as they can so i would hope that that
[3:23:18.840 --> 3:23:24.760]  actually winds up being the case i'm pretty confident that that will be the case into the next
[3:23:24.760 --> 3:23:32.040]  phase we're gonna safely and carefully but as quickly as we possibly can try and get an answer
[3:23:32.040 --> 3:23:37.720]  as to whether it works and is safe and if so we're going to start ramping up production with the
[3:23:37.720 --> 3:23:43.320]  companies involved and you do that at risk in other words you don't wait until you get an answer
[3:23:43.320 --> 3:23:50.520]  before you start manufacturing you at risk proactively start making it assuming it's going
[3:23:50.520 --> 3:24:00.280]  to work assume he did wow that was some good assumption huh well it's almost it's almost
[3:24:00.280 --> 3:24:05.000]  weird to go back isn't it and really look at what they were saying because uh this was such an
[3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:10.360]  experiment the experiment wasn't going that well anyway but they said it was safe and effective
[3:24:10.360 --> 3:24:17.240]  and then no one questioned it amazing isn't it um all right and so let's let's go to this then
[3:24:17.240 --> 3:24:24.280]  brian artists revealed exactly about remdesivir um what what people needed to know about this drug
[3:24:25.960 --> 3:24:30.200]  it's been approved since but it wasn't before the pandemic we're going to use this non-fd
[3:24:30.200 --> 3:24:35.000]  approved drug called remdesivir because it was shown to be safe and efficacious against the
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:42.200]  ebola virus in 2018 and 2019 has anybody actually looked at this study because i clicked the link
[3:24:42.200 --> 3:24:48.760]  on nih.gov's website all of you should do it this is the study ebola virus inside of africa
[3:24:48.760 --> 3:24:52.680]  they took four regions gave them all remdesivir and three other experimental drugs
[3:24:53.640 --> 3:24:59.400]  anthony fowchie said it was proven to be safe and effective against the ebola virus so now in this
[3:24:59.400 --> 3:25:05.320]  novel virus of the corona virus we're going to use it there also we're going to mandate this one drug
[3:25:05.320 --> 3:25:10.520]  you can't use any other ones like hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine back in may 2020 go to the next
[3:25:10.520 --> 3:25:17.720]  slide please so what did the actual study find they actually found you can see here you see
[3:25:17.720 --> 3:25:25.400]  mortality up there definition inside the study they found that remdesivir in six months the safety
[3:25:25.400 --> 3:25:30.680]  board pulled remdesivir from the study a one-year study because it killed more people than any of
[3:25:30.680 --> 3:25:37.720]  the other three drugs including zmap which was put in by the fda and the nih so six months into
[3:25:37.720 --> 3:25:43.800]  the study they pulled remdesivir they pulled zmap which was supplied by our government to africa
[3:25:43.800 --> 3:25:49.560]  because it killed more people how many people did it kill remdesivir killed 54 of all people in
[3:25:49.560 --> 3:25:55.640]  the study that got the drug do you know what they're treating all of your loved ones with and those
[3:25:55.640 --> 3:26:02.440]  you care about in this country now next slide please yep look up here i'm not lying this is
[3:26:02.440 --> 3:26:06.760]  from the study look at the second second column from the right remdesivir look below there
[3:26:07.720 --> 3:26:15.640]  54 percent you see that mortality rate it's true all right next slide please he then quoted a second
[3:26:15.640 --> 3:26:22.280]  study in may 2020 anthony fouchi did that supported the use of remdesivir in the treatment of coronavirus
[3:26:22.280 --> 3:26:29.560]  the bolus study by the way was a lie no one clicked the link to look at it i did this is the other
[3:26:29.560 --> 3:26:35.800]  study he mentioned this was actually done by gilead sciences who makes remdesivir in early march 2020
[3:26:35.800 --> 3:26:42.760]  they took 53 patients from japan canada in america who had covid 19 and they put them on the drug for
[3:26:42.760 --> 3:26:50.120]  10 days what's the drug remdesivir this is the maker of remdesivir's own trial study next slide
[3:26:50.120 --> 3:26:57.640]  please what did they find check this out 23 percent in 10 days had serious adverse events
[3:26:57.640 --> 3:27:03.720]  the most common serious adverse events were multiple organ dysfunction syndrome which is
[3:27:03.720 --> 3:27:13.400]  defined as the number one cause of death in all icu's by the way second septic shock acute kidney
[3:27:13.400 --> 3:27:20.040]  failure and hypotension look at the next part eight percent had to be discontinued because
[3:27:20.040 --> 3:27:27.480]  remdesivir treatment it worsened or prevented or prevented sorry pre-existing kidney failure
[3:27:27.480 --> 3:27:32.120]  and multiple organ failure eight percent had to be taken off by days five because they were dying
[3:27:32.120 --> 3:27:36.840]  as a result of the poison of remdesivir that's what they found from this study as a result of
[3:27:36.840 --> 3:27:45.080]  these studies they decided to actually push this on the masses all right um it's huge isn't it
[3:27:45.080 --> 3:27:51.880]  it's a huge piece of evidence and i also wanted to uh to give you this too before we go to a break
[3:27:51.880 --> 3:27:58.440]  sarah gilbert wrote a book yes sarah gilbert back in january january first she said you know
[3:27:58.440 --> 3:28:04.360]  she said i read an article about four people in china with a strange pneumonia and within two weeks
[3:28:04.360 --> 3:28:09.160]  she and her team designed a vaccine against a pathogen that no one had ever seen before
[3:28:09.160 --> 3:28:14.360]  less than 12 months later vaccination was rolled out across the world to save millions oh sarah
[3:28:14.360 --> 3:28:18.760]  gilbert they actually made a barbie of her and it's a you know she's very unattractive but her
[3:28:18.760 --> 3:28:25.320]  barbie's cute um anyway she was the one that worked for bill gates and oxford so there you go um she
[3:28:25.320 --> 3:28:30.680]  was the one that uh in the article said oh hey i heard there was a little pneumonia and guess what
[3:28:30.680 --> 3:28:38.520]  we have ready to go we have a cure and it's ready oh my gosh yeah i don't even know what the illness
[3:28:38.520 --> 3:28:43.640]  is but i've got a cure within a couple of weeks so they started working on the vaccine so they
[3:28:43.640 --> 3:28:48.120]  could have as many doses as they needed by the time it rolled out i'll be right back with more
[3:28:48.120 --> 3:28:55.400]  k deli from the k deli show k deli show dot com i'll be right back with so much so much to give you

[3:30:06.920 --> 3:30:12.440]  to our bodies to our immune systems we don't have them long term we die but what a lot of people
[3:30:12.440 --> 3:30:18.360]  don't know is even if you have those compounds the levels that are recommended if you don't have deep
[3:30:18.360 --> 3:30:24.520]  restful clean sleep your body will fall apart even faster and with so many chemicals in the food
[3:30:24.520 --> 3:30:29.320]  and water and so much agitation in the culture in life it's hard to settle down it's hard to relax
[3:30:29.320 --> 3:30:34.680]  well let me tell you something right now down and out is an incredibly strong natural compound

[3:30:50.600 --> 3:30:55.240]  it sells out even though we've already sold out a half of it in just the last month and we probably
[3:30:55.240 --> 3:31:01.480]  are going to have more for about five months it was almost 15 years ago that i released my
[3:31:01.480 --> 3:31:06.920]  seminal film in game blueprint for global enslavement then that documentary i predicted the
[3:31:06.920 --> 3:31:12.360]  globalist would establish world government by releasing a virus demanding that there be
[3:31:12.360 --> 3:31:17.960]  worldwide lockdowns and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society and now they've done it
[3:31:18.760 --> 3:31:23.800]  how did i know they would do it because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own
[3:31:23.800 --> 3:31:28.760]  reports and internal meetings were leaked you see then i was tracking the builder bird group who's
[3:31:28.760 --> 3:31:34.120]  head at the time was claus schwa and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were a deep
[3:31:34.120 --> 3:31:39.640]  planning launch this great recent well we're now living in the purposeful collapse of the third
[3:31:39.640 --> 3:31:44.600]  world and the first world on its ashes is a tyrannical corporate world government the total
[3:31:44.600 --> 3:31:50.200]  censorship no due process destruction of the family and then incrementally more and more
[3:31:50.200 --> 3:31:56.040]  deadly injections of poison mass creating these vaccines to poison us in the populace this is
[3:31:56.040 --> 3:32:02.280]  what info wars is fighting we're fighting for the future i want to explain something that
[3:32:02.280 --> 3:32:06.600]  is absolutely feed understanding our world it's very very simple but the most people don't know
[3:32:07.400 --> 3:32:14.280]  the privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions
[3:32:14.280 --> 3:32:21.480]  of dollars and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure intellectual property
[3:32:22.440 --> 3:32:28.680]  energy they're using it to buy people to buy influence and in the past they created thousands
[3:32:28.680 --> 3:32:33.160]  of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulate markets but they never allowed that
[3:32:33.160 --> 3:32:38.280]  money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation now they've gone
[3:32:38.280 --> 3:32:43.560]  ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy buying up everything
[3:32:44.200 --> 3:32:50.440]  not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down and force the collapse of civilization
[3:32:50.440 --> 3:32:55.080]  making the companies they do fund the only things left standing this is the great reset this is
[3:32:55.080 --> 3:33:04.520]  what's happening now for everyone it's the only way to stop it you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:14.920 --> 3:33:19.480]  i'm k dally your guest host so glad to be with you it's an important hour because these are the
[3:33:19.480 --> 3:33:24.840]  clips this is the information that people always email me about ask me about and it's all in one
[3:33:24.840 --> 3:33:31.240]  show for you today really happy to do this so the prep act was changed this is important this is
[3:33:31.240 --> 3:33:37.560]  number four to include no liability for the hospitals if they followed the nih protocol
[3:33:37.560 --> 3:33:43.400]  exactly there was a covet watchdog group and they picked up on this that this had been changed last
[3:33:43.400 --> 3:33:49.480]  year uh the prep act from 2005 2004 i've talked about this a little bit on the show before it was
[3:33:49.480 --> 3:33:54.920]  amended so that private hospitals and entities were covered in their actions taken with covet 19
[3:33:54.920 --> 3:34:01.080]  patients and relieved of all liability as long as they were prescribing covered counter measures
[3:34:01.080 --> 3:34:07.400]  that included remdesivir the nih approved medication and it doesn't matter how horrific it
[3:34:07.400 --> 3:34:11.800]  is or how high the death toll they will stick to that and this is why you cannot get effective
[3:34:11.800 --> 3:34:16.120]  treatments in the hospital you can't get hydroxychloroquine you can't get ivermectin you can't get
[3:34:16.120 --> 3:34:23.240]  anything um so the section seven was amended in the prep act liability protection and it was to
[3:34:23.240 --> 3:34:28.680]  cover persons for recommended activities related to the counter measures and so this is all written
[3:34:28.680 --> 3:34:35.400]  out um in this document but uh also at the bottom the attachment of liability or tort waiver is
[3:34:35.400 --> 3:34:42.280]  important because it was only going to cover fda approved therapeutics um that were likely to explain
[3:34:42.280 --> 3:34:48.040]  a shift amid this medical community to stop patients treatment due to coverage restrictions
[3:34:48.040 --> 3:34:54.200]  on their malpractice insurance see the malpractice insurance didn't go as far as they wanted it to
[3:34:54.200 --> 3:35:00.520]  so of course they had to go in and amend the prep act and uh and and give it a liability waiver
[3:35:01.400 --> 3:35:06.040]  this is why you can't get anything in a hospital this is exactly why number five
[3:35:06.040 --> 3:35:13.080]  visor admitted shedding it admitted shedding and let me tell you how they did this this was a
[3:35:13.080 --> 3:35:19.000]  document this was their own study actually and they put this out there about how they were gonna
[3:35:19.000 --> 3:35:23.640]  um all their concerns and and how they were going to do their their own study for visor
[3:35:23.640 --> 3:35:29.160]  they were concerned about these two words occupational exposure well what is that it's
[3:35:29.160 --> 3:35:36.520]  a and to the recently vaccinated um test subjects right this is under section 8.3.5.3
[3:35:36.520 --> 3:35:43.160]  occupational exposure visor warned that caretakers and close contacts of the recently vaccinated
[3:35:43.160 --> 3:35:48.760]  could be exposed to spike proteins that are translated and synthesized in the cells of the
[3:35:48.760 --> 3:35:54.760]  vaccinated and during the clinical trials visor instructed researchers to monitor for
[3:35:54.760 --> 3:36:02.280]  severe adverse effects uh and events in the vaccinated and in the unvaccinated people who
[3:36:02.280 --> 3:36:09.160]  were exposed to the vaccinated what does it mean uh the mRNA vaccines do not shed live viruses so
[3:36:09.160 --> 3:36:13.880]  what exactly is being transmitted from the vaccinated to the unvaccinated well under
[3:36:13.880 --> 3:36:21.000]  this section it basically uh it basically says that uh that you can have this exchange
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:32.280]  through inhalation or skin contact hmm it's kind of broad they knew they knew that the vaccinated
[3:36:32.280 --> 3:36:39.160]  would be affecting the unvaccinated and what's kind of sick about it is that that was all there was
[3:36:39.160 --> 3:36:43.000]  to it the media would never talk about this people were wondering why they were getting
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:48.520]  some strange things happening to them as soon as somebody got vaccinated around them miscarriages
[3:36:48.520 --> 3:36:54.120]  all kinds of things they knew it was in their own section they admitted it and they were keeping an
[3:36:54.120 --> 3:37:00.520]  eye on it see if you were actually in a test experiment right an experiment of any kind with
[3:37:00.520 --> 3:37:06.520]  any drugs all of us would be going in for randomly for so many things that we would have to give them
[3:37:06.520 --> 3:37:11.880]  like every couple of days they would be monitoring you they would be telling you exactly um you know
[3:37:11.880 --> 3:37:16.200]  this is your heart rate and this is the effects you're having none of us are going through that
[3:37:16.200 --> 3:37:22.760]  are they no nobody right you get the shot you go home you think oh i've been vaccinated well
[3:37:23.400 --> 3:37:28.840]  we are in a study and i'll talk about that too number six hydroxychloroquine was praised in
[3:37:28.840 --> 3:37:36.760]  2005 for fighting SARS yes by Tony Fauci and his group so severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS
[3:37:36.760 --> 3:37:43.080]  is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus no effective you know exposure therapy currently
[3:37:43.080 --> 3:37:49.640]  available but they did say that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2
[3:37:49.640 --> 3:37:55.160]  infection of primate cells and these inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated
[3:37:55.160 --> 3:38:01.880]  with this drug either before or after exposure to the virus suggesting therapeutic advantage
[3:38:02.680 --> 3:38:09.640]  interesting isn't it and then also chloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2
[3:38:09.640 --> 3:38:17.000]  in cells in cell culture isn't that amazing and that comes to us right from the ncbi.nih.gov
[3:38:18.840 --> 3:38:25.480]  there was also you know throughout the trial he said that they were able to enroll a diverse
[3:38:25.480 --> 3:38:31.240]  population similar to the population that was being infected with SARS at the time and when
[3:38:31.240 --> 3:38:36.200]  he was doing his remdesivir trial and i thought that was kind of interesting too because um
[3:38:36.200 --> 3:38:43.400]  i think we don't really understand a lot about how they how he has been projecting this wanting
[3:38:43.400 --> 3:38:49.080]  this desiring this for years but man this was his moment and he was wanting it for a very long time
[3:38:49.080 --> 3:38:55.640]  and not only that he controls over 3 000 patents he also controls who does the studies as you noticed
[3:38:55.640 --> 3:39:01.800]  in one of the clips he said the NIH did the study uh for remdesivir so he actually controls all the
[3:39:01.800 --> 3:39:09.640]  studies the efficacy the results the price i mean he's on every single end of this the NIH and then
[3:39:09.640 --> 3:39:16.120]  also of course um ivermectin when it won the Nobel Prize this is what it said about ivermectin
[3:39:17.000 --> 3:39:22.600]  it said that uh that uh it has fundamentally changed the treatment of parasitic diseases
[3:39:23.560 --> 3:39:29.000]  and the derivative ivermectin from avermectin which is ivermectin is used in all parts of the
[3:39:29.000 --> 3:39:35.880]  world that are plagued by parasitic disease all parts of the world plagued by disease isn't that
[3:39:35.880 --> 3:39:41.480]  interesting that they're demonizing this right now to to a fault i mean they they couldn't demonize it
[3:39:41.480 --> 3:39:47.640]  more if they wanted to in fact if you go to the hospital absolutely no ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine
[3:39:47.640 --> 3:39:53.000]  now they've tripled the price to ivermectin and it's difficult to get if i were you i'd pay cash
[3:39:53.000 --> 3:39:57.800]  if you ever get ivermectin or hydro hydroxychloroquine do not go through your insurance because
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:03.080]  people that are prescribing it are getting leaned on because of this and so i would absolutely pay
[3:40:03.080 --> 3:40:09.720]  cash so it does not go through the insurance companies um and speaking of insurance companies
[3:40:09.720 --> 3:40:16.360]  number seven insurance company boon i was talking with dr david martin and let me just tell you
[3:40:16.360 --> 3:40:22.280]  he is in charge of the largest risk assessment financial risk assessment company in the world
[3:40:22.280 --> 3:40:28.280]  and so of course he's going to look at the insurance life insurance payout numbers in 2020 well
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:34.200]  what did he say well it was an actual boon that year for the insurance companies they didn't have
[3:40:34.200 --> 3:40:39.080]  to pay out on much isn't that interesting they didn't have to pay out on all these deaths we
[3:40:39.080 --> 3:40:48.840]  had from a supposed pandemic i find that kind of strange but let me tell you we actually did
[3:40:48.840 --> 3:40:55.480]  less in funerals less in burial less in everything uh in the year 2020 and it's very difficult to
[3:40:55.480 --> 3:41:01.880]  find that because if you do searches they always cut off at 2019 and jump to 2021 it's like they
[3:41:01.880 --> 3:41:09.160]  don't want to discuss it interesting and then also um the stimulus came out with two billion
[3:41:09.160 --> 3:41:16.760]  dollars for funerals of covid 19 families where's that money going where's that money going so
[3:41:16.760 --> 3:41:25.800]  insurance companies didn't pay out we never built a cemetery in 2020 we didn't have morticians on tv
[3:41:25.800 --> 3:41:29.800]  saying they didn't have enough materials they were running out there were shortages remember
[3:41:29.800 --> 3:41:35.480]  all the shortages and the insurance companies sat on a ton of money just a ton of money and
[3:41:35.480 --> 3:41:40.680]  so what did they do they came out with articles because people were starting to ask questions
[3:41:40.680 --> 3:41:44.920]  about this very thing you know the insurance the life insurance that's a big tell on something
[3:41:44.920 --> 3:41:50.280]  like this isn't it a pretty big tell so wall street journal came out with this headline
[3:41:50.840 --> 3:41:56.760]  i can't make this up those dying from covid 19 are least likely to own life insurance
[3:41:59.240 --> 3:42:06.680]  i just have no words wow that was really fortunate for the insurance companies that
[3:42:06.680 --> 3:42:13.880]  everybody that died from covid specifically were not the ones that would go out and buy life insurance
[3:42:13.880 --> 3:42:20.600]  huh that's weird i remember the homeless they weren't getting sick hmm i just remember a lot
[3:42:20.600 --> 3:42:27.080]  of people weren't getting very ill people were only dying in the icus they weren't peeling off
[3:42:27.080 --> 3:42:30.840]  at home they weren't uh they weren't dying in a corner they weren't dying in the streets
[3:42:32.520 --> 3:42:39.000]  only in the icus it's kind of remarkable isn't it so yes insurance companies made a fortune
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:45.240]  last year it was one of their best years actually isn't that fascinating when you go to the numbers
[3:42:45.240 --> 3:42:50.920]  and the numbers don't exactly add up we didn't build a single solitary summit a cemetery either
[3:42:51.800 --> 3:42:59.480]  interesting be right back k dally k dally show dot com i'm up here working on a thursday night in

[3:46:13.720 --> 3:46:20.520]  going up to a gas station and going inside the little mini mart to pay for your gas with a bandana

[3:46:38.040 --> 3:46:43.960]  operational humanity only waking up to the great reset in its tyranny will save us and the mask is
[3:46:43.960 --> 3:46:48.840]  the sign of slavery we must inform the public that it's a fraud and that it's dangerous and it

[3:47:18.040 --> 3:47:23.320]  i am kate dally your guest host boy we're talking about some hard evidence and things you can ignore
[3:47:23.320 --> 3:47:29.080]  and in this i'm not even including the the outrageous claims that they make with masks
[3:47:29.080 --> 3:47:35.880]  as far as that they work and also veirs which is an accumulation of the deaths that are happening
[3:47:35.880 --> 3:47:45.560]  more deaths than we've seen in 20 to 25 years of vaccines yeah and i'm not even getting to those
[3:47:45.560 --> 3:47:52.920]  um this is some of the other new pieces of damning information number eight is phizer phizer uh
[3:47:52.920 --> 3:48:00.760]  october 2021 um this uh this was the summary basis for regulatory action this was a document
[3:48:00.760 --> 3:48:07.240]  that basically said all the safety protocols are missing this came by way of um karen kingston
[3:48:07.240 --> 3:48:12.280]  and she talked about the fact that uh yes there was a discussion and they kept in the bottom of the
[3:48:12.280 --> 3:48:17.800]  notes you know please discuss fda's approach to safety and effectiveness data please discuss
[3:48:17.800 --> 3:48:26.120]  considerations for continuation of this blind uh phase of clinical studies and also uh including
[3:48:26.120 --> 3:48:31.960]  how loss the loss of blinded placebo controlled follow-up and ongoing trials should be addressed
[3:48:31.960 --> 3:48:39.240]  and discuss the gaps in plans described today regarding safety vaccine and effectiveness
[3:48:39.240 --> 3:48:46.520]  um vaccine safety and effectiveness for those that have received the phizer vaccine they still
[3:48:46.520 --> 3:48:53.080]  aren't doing it they still aren't doing it um let's go to number nine there's no covet in the test
[3:48:53.640 --> 3:48:59.880]  and this fall we have a new test emerging right so we knew this was coming but i want to talk
[3:48:59.880 --> 3:49:06.360]  about this so there's no covet in the test so basically there's no quantified virus isolates
[3:49:06.360 --> 3:49:15.000]  of the 2019 covet 19 virus uh that they that were have been available from the cdc there is nothing
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:20.360]  there and i really hope people understand this this document is really really important because
[3:49:20.360 --> 3:49:24.680]  there's a couple of pages here and let me just go through the pages real quick with you this test
[3:49:24.680 --> 3:49:29.640]  on page 10 it says this test has not been fda cleared or approved this test has not been authorized
[3:49:29.640 --> 3:49:36.840]  by the fda um or has been authorized by the fda under an e ua which is an emergency order for
[3:49:36.840 --> 3:49:44.920]  use by laboratories okay also uh this test uh oh sorry page 15 equivalents and performance of the
[3:49:44.920 --> 3:49:51.240]  following extraction platforms were demonstrated with the cdc human influenza they used the flu
[3:49:51.240 --> 3:50:04.520]  for the data and they said that was acceptable use the cdc uh 2019 test page 38 test performance
[3:50:04.520 --> 3:50:09.080]  can be affected because the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of an infection caused by
[3:50:09.080 --> 3:50:18.120]  2019 um encove is not fully known yep up all this time later anyway for example uh they might not
[3:50:18.120 --> 3:50:24.920]  know the optimum types of specimens to collect uh during the infection which specimens um they were
[3:50:24.920 --> 3:50:30.120]  even talking about urine about stool samples if you really want to know if somebody has covid
[3:50:30.120 --> 3:50:40.200]  you need to send those samples on ice to the cdc uh did anyone do that no no they didn't um no they
[3:50:40.200 --> 3:50:47.080]  didn't so they also were saying that uh hey we've included this virus with the presumptive detection
[3:50:47.080 --> 3:50:54.760]  of the middle east respiratory syndrome which is MERS the uh flu the influenza and of course the h7
[3:50:54.760 --> 3:51:01.240]  h9 virus seems like they're mixing up a lot doesn't it and they also said that yes you need to collect
[3:51:01.240 --> 3:51:10.200]  all those samples so then when you get to the fda.gov uh document it said because a pcr test can run
[3:51:10.200 --> 3:51:15.400]  multiple cycles of this application it's capable of detecting the virus even if there's a low level
[3:51:15.400 --> 3:51:20.680]  of the viral RNA in your in your sample because they're ratcheting it up 40 times and they said
[3:51:20.680 --> 3:51:28.200]  just don't go over 40 well 40 is considered absolute deceit by Tony Fauci himself anything over 25
[3:51:28.200 --> 3:51:33.960]  rotations so they're taking a very very little sample and they're blowing it up as far as they
[3:51:33.960 --> 3:51:40.280]  can go to say you have covid so now now they're doing a new test they're combining the flu
[3:51:40.280 --> 3:51:45.560]  uh into this test and i found this to be really really interesting there's a clip by
[3:51:45.560 --> 3:51:50.360]  renfield you know he's he kind of quietly went away didn't he renfield like he just kind of disappeared
[3:51:51.160 --> 3:51:56.280]  um after uh after he said this at the white house it seemed like he didn't have a job anymore
[3:51:56.280 --> 3:52:00.920]  but he said this standing on the steps at the white house with trump right there watching
[3:52:01.960 --> 3:52:03.400]  let's let's listen to renfield
[3:52:04.040 --> 3:52:08.520]  to headmark they don't understand what i mean we're going to have the flu epidemic and the
[3:52:08.520 --> 3:52:13.160]  coronavirus epidemic at the same time is that what you said to the washington post
[3:52:13.160 --> 3:52:17.720]  yeah that's what i was trying to say to you that um just a minute ago that the issue that i was
[3:52:17.720 --> 3:52:22.600]  talking about about being more difficult is that we're going to have two viruses circulate at the
[3:52:22.600 --> 3:52:29.640]  same time this spring that we just went through february we had a benefit of having the flu season
[3:52:30.520 --> 3:52:35.880]  ended so we could use all our flu surveillance systems to say whoops this is coronavirus we
[3:52:35.880 --> 3:52:42.840]  need to focus next fall and and winter we are going to have two viruses circulating and we're
[3:52:42.840 --> 3:52:47.480]  going to have to distinguish between which is flu and which is the coronavirus and so the comment
[3:52:47.480 --> 3:52:54.120]  that i made it's more yeah it's more difficult well what they did was they just combined them
[3:52:54.120 --> 3:52:59.960]  this is the new test that we get so pcr's going away and then of course we're going to get the
[3:52:59.960 --> 3:53:07.240]  cdc influenza SARS-CoV-2 flu sc2 so when you see the the name flu sc2 now you know what you're
[3:53:07.240 --> 3:53:16.040]  dealing with it's a multiplex assay is in real time um test it's a it's one test and it will
[3:53:16.040 --> 3:53:23.880]  detect i can't make this up COVID-19 so SARS-CoV-2 influenza a and influenza b in the upper lower
[3:53:23.880 --> 3:53:31.800]  respiratory specimens hmm boy if you thought we had false positives before just wait just wait
[3:53:32.600 --> 3:53:36.840]  they said that it's been it's been designed to minimize the likelihood of false positives
[3:53:36.840 --> 3:53:43.000]  however they said in the event of a false positive result i can't believe they wrote this
[3:53:43.000 --> 3:53:48.840]  risk to individuals could include the following a recommendation for isolation monitoring of
[3:53:48.840 --> 3:53:55.880]  household and other close contacts for symptoms patient patient isolation yeah so basically oh
[3:53:55.880 --> 3:54:04.280]  delayed diagnosis treatment for something you don't have gee sorry yeah can you believe this
[3:54:04.280 --> 3:54:09.880]  and they even said they even had the audacity to say and i'm sure a lot of people will have both
[3:54:10.920 --> 3:54:17.960]  COVID and the flu you guys realize the flu has just went away all right so let's go down to this
[3:54:17.960 --> 3:54:23.800]  there's no COVID to be found this is in a document that they put out september of 2020 and this was
[3:54:23.800 --> 3:54:30.520]  page 39 and 40 and it said they weren't able to obtain an authorized human specimen uh control
[3:54:30.520 --> 3:54:38.520]  and uh they absolutely have no specimen in uh on cbs news in um in the early spring uh china
[3:54:38.520 --> 3:54:44.280]  epidemiologist the head of epidemiology came on and said yes they had never isolated a COVID virus
[3:54:44.280 --> 3:54:49.560]  before this is why COVID virus was never put in the test and the cdc admitted it and this is on
[3:54:49.560 --> 3:54:55.000]  the documentation too i'll include this on the notes for at kate dally show dot com but uh they
[3:54:55.000 --> 3:55:00.840]  never had it in the test and uh it's never it's not anywhere and they actually did not approve
[3:55:00.840 --> 3:55:05.560]  the vaccine this is really really important so let me tell you about the fake out there's two
[3:55:05.560 --> 3:55:10.840]  vaccines and this is courtesy of william engdell he's a wonderful researcher and there is a german
[3:55:10.840 --> 3:55:17.240]  version and there is an american version so what they did it seems that the fda executed this very
[3:55:17.240 --> 3:55:24.840]  clever ruse um in in issuing separate rulings for the phyzer biotech vaccine so we have two
[3:55:24.840 --> 3:55:32.280]  different ones and one is biotech of mains and the other one is is the phyzer here well what they
[3:55:32.280 --> 3:55:40.920]  basically did was um they concluded that uh they shoved one and so so so basically what they did
[3:55:40.920 --> 3:55:46.760]  was this buried in the footnote in the letter of the fda they said there's two legally separate
[3:55:46.760 --> 3:55:54.600]  entities of vaccine and each vaccine so one got called the comrade comradity i can't even say it
[3:55:54.600 --> 3:56:00.600]  the fda writes that the products are legally distinct with certain differences so one on
[3:56:00.600 --> 3:56:07.000]  the us vaccine the phyzer vaccine only got an extension of its emergency use authorization
[3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:13.080]  not full approval it was the one in germany it was the one in germany that got it that got the
[3:56:13.080 --> 3:56:18.600]  the approval but they're not using that one here okay and that approval was on conditions
[3:56:18.600 --> 3:56:25.320]  that had to be met by 2027 so it really wasn't even a full approval but they did the bait and
[3:56:25.320 --> 3:56:31.320]  switch and the news said fully approved even though it's two different vaccines two different
[3:56:31.320 --> 3:56:39.400]  vaccines so um the one here only got an extension of the eua the emergency order isn't that insane
[3:56:39.400 --> 3:56:46.120]  i think it's insane and i think that that we um we really i think need to understand what we're
[3:56:46.120 --> 3:56:53.160]  up against here on one side you have just trust me i'm the media i'm the government and i have
[3:56:53.160 --> 3:56:59.560]  um absolutely screwed this up at every level you're still walking around with a mask it's almost
[3:56:59.560 --> 3:57:05.240]  going to be two years and just believe us okay we've never had to do this in history but just
[3:57:05.240 --> 3:57:10.760]  believe us it's all about control and we all know it but over here we have a mountain of evidence
[3:57:10.760 --> 3:57:16.440]  even in their own words and own documents that they've put out isn't that amazing that says
[3:57:16.440 --> 3:57:21.880]  exactly what's going on and all somebody has to do is look at the exact evidence to find out
[3:57:21.880 --> 3:57:27.160]  i hope this has helped you and also go to kdallyshow.com it's all written out for you
[3:57:27.160 --> 3:57:32.760]  and i'll put it there in show notes under the tab show really appreciate this and uh and of
