[00:00.000 --> 00:19.560]  We now have a crystal clear picture of exactly what's happening with the coronavirus and the
[00:19.560 --> 00:23.280]  global power grab and who is driving.
[00:23.280 --> 00:26.240]  This is from the Associated Press this morning from Governor Cuomo.
[00:26.240 --> 00:30.840]  When will things go back to the way they were?
[00:30.840 --> 00:33.040]  I don't think it's about going back.
[00:33.040 --> 00:37.440]  I don't think it's ever going back.
[00:37.440 --> 00:44.420]  Martial law forever, medical tyranny enveloping the gates of officially announced forced
[00:44.420 --> 00:51.040]  inoculations breaking breaking forced inoculations to buy and sell and to leave your home.
[00:51.040 --> 00:58.160]  The new world order is now taking the mask off is now throwing absolute tyranny in our
[00:58.160 --> 01:05.160]  face.
[01:05.160 --> 01:10.840]  At the moment in most parts of the world due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's
[01:10.840 --> 01:16.680]  actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household at family level.
[01:16.680 --> 01:21.280]  In some senses transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family
[01:21.280 --> 01:23.200]  units.
[01:23.200 --> 01:28.680]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove
[01:28.680 --> 01:54.880]  them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[01:54.880 --> 01:59.960]  Please remember to wash your hands often, stay home if you are sick and practice good social
[01:59.960 --> 02:03.200]  separation of at least six feet when possible.
[02:03.200 --> 02:08.080]  Loitering inside or outside of the store is strictly prohibited.
[02:08.080 --> 02:10.400]  Thank you for choosing Walmart.
[02:10.400 --> 02:14.720]  If you've observed recurring violations of the safer at home order, please continue to
[02:14.720 --> 02:21.240]  let us know at coronavirus.lacity.org slash business violation.
[02:21.240 --> 02:27.040]  We know the old expression about snitches, well in this case snitches get rewards.
[02:27.040 --> 02:32.160]  We want to thank you for turning folks in and making sure we are all safe.
[02:32.160 --> 02:36.400]  Recently, the county's public health officer issued an order expanding on the stay at home
[02:36.400 --> 02:38.720]  order given by Governor Newsom.
[02:38.720 --> 02:43.440]  Among other things, this new order prohibits public and private gatherings of any size and
[02:43.440 --> 02:47.320]  requires all persons to wear coverings over their faces.
[02:47.320 --> 03:01.080]  This is a valid order and enforceable by fine imprisonment or both.
[03:01.080 --> 03:03.600]  The dystopia is real.
[03:03.600 --> 03:06.280]  Its goals are your death.
[03:06.280 --> 03:09.000]  This is the new world order.
[03:09.000 --> 03:17.240]  This is everything in fours ever said vindicated in royal flush, spade on top of spade.
[03:17.240 --> 03:31.080]  The ace of spades, the ace of spades, the only god I need is the ace of spades, death.
[03:31.080 --> 03:32.080]  God help us.
[03:32.080 --> 03:36.040]  It's just as bad as I thought.
[03:36.040 --> 03:43.760]  But to foresee something, see all the preparation, the eager globalists to really kick off the
[03:43.760 --> 03:44.760]  mass calling.
[03:44.760 --> 03:49.280]  It's one thing, once it made a test, it's horrific.
[03:49.280 --> 03:50.280]  Millions did.
[03:50.280 --> 03:51.280]  Nameless.
[03:51.280 --> 03:52.280]  Never personalized.
[03:52.280 --> 03:57.920]  Now they tell you to personalize each death.
[03:57.920 --> 04:03.080]  Even though the World Health Organization itself admits that tens of millions starve to death
[04:03.080 --> 04:08.240]  a year and that half a billion more people could starve to death in just the next few
[04:08.240 --> 04:10.240]  years because of the slowdown.
[04:10.240 --> 04:15.120]  But those are billions that die so that thousands can live.
[04:15.120 --> 04:20.200]  Yes, it's a libra.
[04:20.200 --> 04:24.880]  But really, it's just old-fashioned eugenics.
[04:24.880 --> 04:29.920]  Personalize the thousands, hundreds of millions die.
[04:29.920 --> 04:33.520]  Globalist fuzzy man.
[04:33.520 --> 04:38.760]  And I want to fight this and turn it around, but we will not have awakening injustice until
[04:38.760 --> 04:42.760]  we stop exterminating the unborn and hell, the ones they're keeping alive after they're
[04:42.760 --> 04:43.760]  born and harvesting.
[04:43.760 --> 04:47.440]  Just like the governor said, we keep them comfortable.
[04:47.440 --> 04:49.960]  You heard the U.N. say when they take their kids out of your family, because they're not
[04:49.960 --> 04:55.800]  vaccinated, they're going to do it very dignified just like they keep those babies alive and
[04:55.800 --> 04:59.680]  suck their blood out.
[04:59.680 --> 05:07.120]  Something huge is happening all over the United States on ABC CBS NBC on local Fox affiliates,
[05:07.120 --> 05:12.200]  only local ones, they're having medical doctors on who successfully treated their patients
[05:12.200 --> 05:17.920]  with 100% recovery rates, with hydroxychloroquine, but you've got to have the zinc.
[05:17.920 --> 05:23.720]  This is a known fact, but national news, other than Fox, will not carry it.
[05:23.720 --> 05:27.640]  And when Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingram, and Sean Hannity covered it and had medical doctors
[05:27.640 --> 05:31.640]  talk about it, they got demonized and Fox had them basically shut up.
[05:31.640 --> 05:35.400]  But they've been vindicated, Info Wars has been vindicated, we were saying at first
[05:35.400 --> 05:40.360]  with experts we had on air, we got attacked nationally, and they said, take us off the
[05:40.360 --> 05:45.480]  air, Google took our app away saying that we were putting out fake cures for staying
[05:45.480 --> 05:50.600]  hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and CPAC, but all we were doing was reporting with medical journals
[05:50.600 --> 05:54.400]  were saying, big pharma in the global is one you're sick and dead, and they don't want
[05:54.400 --> 05:56.720]  you to boost your immune system, screw them.
[05:56.720 --> 06:24.800]  We now take you live to the front lines of the global emergency transmission, attempting
[06:24.800 --> 06:32.000]  to warn humanity before it's too late on the globalist plan for total absolute depopulation
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.000]  and the rise of their silicon AI gods.
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.720]  That at least is the satanic illusion the technocrats who oversee the technocracy openly
[06:43.720 --> 06:47.080]  say they're following.
[06:47.080 --> 06:52.080]  Over the two plus decades we've been on air, many times I've asked listeners, what would
[06:52.080 --> 07:03.680]  you call the globalist, a death cult, psychotic satanist, but really the best term for these
[07:03.680 --> 07:17.360]  kleptocrats, these decepticons, is not elite, not even alpha maggot, it's cancer, it's
[07:17.360 --> 07:24.080]  a mutation, cancer in the body is a sin, it's not following the code, it rebels and for
[07:24.080 --> 07:29.840]  the time it takes over but kills the host itself because it doesn't have a consciousness,
[07:29.840 --> 07:38.000]  it only has a will to vandalize and overwrite.
[07:38.000 --> 07:47.320]  And so really the best definition of this new world order is the cult, the death cult.
[07:47.320 --> 07:51.560]  It's who they are, it's what they like to do, they've got all their reasons and excuses
[07:51.560 --> 07:58.000]  on the surface where they're protecting the earth and culling the overgrowth of the herd,
[07:58.000 --> 08:02.280]  trimming and pruning the trees but they're poisoning the very roots of the tree itself
[08:02.280 --> 08:05.200]  and creating sickening fruit.
[08:05.200 --> 08:14.640]  They're vandalizing the tree while they themselves eat at its heart so that it collapses into
[08:14.640 --> 08:23.840]  a ruin and this planet never enters its real potential, which is a seed drifting through
[08:23.840 --> 08:35.800]  the universe set to create incredible waves of life and construction and consciousness.
[08:35.800 --> 08:47.040]  But so many seeds float down from their creator into the darkness of this time-space ocean
[08:47.040 --> 08:54.520]  and are devoured or fall in infertile soil and die, forgotten, their potential never
[08:54.520 --> 09:01.840]  even imagined consciously but we have entered the next phase, we have seen the potentiality
[09:01.840 --> 09:11.440]  and we see those that stand at the gate, the portal of our ascension, greedily wishing
[09:11.440 --> 09:19.600]  to suppress the potential so that it be all theirs and in their lust and attempt to hoard
[09:19.600 --> 09:27.040]  the light and to block it out from us, they destroy themselves at the very same time,
[09:27.040 --> 09:37.280]  they attempt to tie us down and destroy us but they will only make us plunge through
[09:37.280 --> 09:44.480]  the wall of fear they've created to suppress us and staring into that abyss, we will not
[09:44.480 --> 09:59.080]  find destruction but we will find Valhalla.
[09:59.080 --> 10:15.440]  I am very frustrated in a pregnant way in that the enemy's operations are so legion
[10:15.440 --> 10:30.920]  and so transparent and so open at this point that it really falls to the people to face
[10:30.920 --> 10:37.280]  the reality of what's staring them in the face and to do something about it and to have
[10:37.280 --> 10:46.200]  respect for yourselves and to realize that that animating contest of liberty is what
[10:46.200 --> 10:55.280]  consciousness is all about and that it's not work, that it is empowerment, it is fulfillment,
[10:55.280 --> 11:03.600]  it is exhilaration, it is ecstasy, I am in ecstasy understanding the new world order
[11:03.600 --> 11:11.080]  and what is beyond it and escaping it, I've already escaped it spiritually but there is
[11:11.080 --> 11:20.480]  a nagging bloody black hook in my soul, in my love for humanity and seeing how many people
[11:20.480 --> 11:30.360]  are caught in this web of spiritual death and so my ecstasy with God becomes a torture
[11:30.360 --> 11:36.440]  because I know the truth and I know what is available to everyone but they are mesmerized
[11:36.440 --> 11:44.920]  and caught in a trance and you're watching them like in the Little Mermaid with Ursula
[11:44.920 --> 11:51.400]  about to sell her soul and her voice and you see all the little souls tied down, shuttered
[11:51.400 --> 11:56.240]  shadows of themselves, wraiths begging her and screaming at her but they don't have voices
[11:56.240 --> 12:07.520]  telling her, don't do it, don't make the deal, there isn't a deal, it's a fraud but she doesn't
[12:07.520 --> 12:23.560]  listen, well I had my voice, I didn't sell out but I've been down in the grotto, I've
[12:23.560 --> 12:32.120]  seen what they do to people that sell out, the minute God is removed and the minute
[12:32.120 --> 12:37.760]  the Holy Spirit is gone and the devil knows he has you then you find out you're a slave
[12:37.760 --> 12:44.360]  and you better go out and enslave as many people as you can for that spirit or it will
[12:44.360 --> 12:53.960]  destroy you and tie you down and torture you at that point and that's why these evil people
[12:53.960 --> 12:59.440]  are so driven to get children and so driven to hurt innocents and so driven to dominate
[12:59.440 --> 13:05.640]  knowledge because they are captured, you watch that footage of that man dressing a vampire
[13:05.640 --> 13:11.200]  outfit which they call a drag queen, everything's deception upon deception, vampire men and
[13:11.200 --> 13:16.520]  clown outfits coming to your children and she's simulating the murder of the vampire man of
[13:16.520 --> 13:21.360]  the baby and drinking the blood and all these men and women are looking on like this is
[13:21.360 --> 13:26.880]  something powerful and this is something good and then you see the externalization of the
[13:26.880 --> 13:35.280]  Satanism all over Comedy Central, all over Viacom, all over HBO, all over Netflix with
[13:35.280 --> 13:46.640]  force fed talking heads telling you I killed my baby girl, she had a future and I sat there
[13:46.640 --> 13:51.280]  with my boyfriend and we waited till I was eight months pregnant because it turned us
[13:51.280 --> 13:56.720]  on to have that power to chop her up and to take her future, these are quotes, would
[13:56.720 --> 14:02.080]  you like me to play the videos, you've heard them, you've seen them, remember that that's
[14:02.080 --> 14:10.240]  not a person doing that, that is the worst stuff in the universe jacked in to people's
[14:10.240 --> 14:15.440]  consciousness who turned it over just like they turned a television set to a certain
[14:15.440 --> 14:22.360]  channel, well I'm not tuned into that channel and I only show you that channel because that's
[14:22.360 --> 14:27.280]  the channel they're putting you and your family on so you shouldn't worry what the system
[14:27.280 --> 14:38.080]  will do to you for standing up against it, you should worry about the lights going out
[14:38.080 --> 14:45.320]  and you turning God out of your spectrum because God will remove the universe from you if you
[14:45.320 --> 14:51.440]  ask for it and you will be in a black hole, your soul, like that, the minute you make
[14:51.440 --> 14:55.280]  that decision, the thief, the murderer, they're on the cross, one of them doesn't believe
[14:55.280 --> 14:58.880]  the other does, Christ says today you'll be with me in paradise, meaning you made the
[14:58.880 --> 15:02.720]  spiritual choice, you repented at the last minute, you can still make the choice, but
[15:02.720 --> 15:07.640]  when the Holy Spirit was there, the man on the cross made the decision and instantly
[15:07.640 --> 15:12.320]  was there, but see you make the decision to join Satan even though you know God's real,
[15:12.320 --> 15:18.120]  you feel the Holy Spirit, you see the future and you say I want to go with this, I want
[15:18.120 --> 15:23.840]  to rape babies, I want to drink blood, I want to kill the planet, killing a child is a symbol
[15:23.840 --> 15:27.880]  of killing the future, everything is about making you hate yourself, everything is about
[15:27.880 --> 15:31.400]  making you turn off your life force, everything in this system is about teaching you that
[15:31.400 --> 15:36.320]  you're non-essential and that you're the problem, so you'll like it's a polite, nice thing
[15:36.320 --> 15:41.120]  to do, just all do whatever you say, I'll stand down, I'll starve, they're using your
[15:41.120 --> 15:45.680]  goodness but it's twisted and the next it's we'll help us kill babies, we'll help us do
[15:45.680 --> 15:49.560]  that, we'll help us give vaccines to sterilize folks, it's for the greater good, they don't
[15:49.560 --> 15:54.600]  know they can't handle it, we're saving the earth right now and then you join Satan believing
[15:54.600 --> 15:57.800]  you're doing good, TNTell straight ahead.

[17:58.800 --> 18:07.320]  As predicted, the human rebellion against globalist machines has begun, the LA Times,
[18:07.320 --> 18:13.240]  the Washington Post, Wired Magazine all reported years ago, that major studies show 5G caused
[18:13.240 --> 18:19.560]  increased cancer in rats, it's a fact, 5G is just a later generation of systems that
[18:19.560 --> 18:26.440]  are on record for more than 70 years to cause cancer, they rub the DNA molecules together,
[18:26.440 --> 18:32.800]  they are microwaves, well now, YouTube has admitted to the BBC and others that they're
[18:32.800 --> 18:38.640]  banning anyone criticizing 5G, even if you don't connect to coronavirus, they're banning
[18:38.640 --> 18:43.920]  it, but the studies do show that 5G lowers your immunity to viruses, period, they're
[18:43.920 --> 18:48.760]  peer reviewed journals, we're showing these documents on air and the globalist can go
[18:48.760 --> 18:53.960]  to hell, the human rebellion against globalist machines has begun, we're not troglodytes
[18:53.960 --> 18:59.800]  afraid of technology, we don't like technology with Trojan horse anti-human crap in it.
[18:59.800 --> 19:09.320]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.

[20:23.600 --> 20:34.040]  want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[20:34.040 --> 20:55.680]  Nine years ago, Brian Rose was a very successful banker in New York on the city of London,
[20:55.680 --> 20:59.800]  got sick of what he was doing and wanted to try to empower humanity, so he started London
[20:59.800 --> 21:04.920]  Real, and I've been aware of it three or four years, it's got millions of viewers a week,
[21:04.920 --> 21:09.960]  very successful, very eclectic, very classically liberal in the old fashioned sense that it's
[21:09.960 --> 21:14.480]  open minded and speaks to all different groups and really tries to unify humanity around
[21:14.480 --> 21:19.720]  debate and discussion, so I'm a fan of it, and I love the David Icke interviews on there,
[21:19.720 --> 21:22.840]  I don't agree with everything David Icke says, but the guy means what he's saying and a lot
[21:22.840 --> 21:26.160]  of things he's talked about have come true.
[21:26.160 --> 21:32.520]  So three days ago, they started streaming an interview that David Icke two and a half
[21:32.520 --> 21:37.440]  hours long, and it went super viral in a few hours and YouTube banned it, and they came
[21:37.440 --> 21:44.200]  out and said, well, we banned it because you said 5G creates COVID-19, no, Icke said it
[21:44.200 --> 21:50.560]  lowers your immunity to viruses, and I can show you BBC articles, in fact I will right
[21:50.560 --> 21:56.520]  here, where they've said that 10 years ago, 5 years ago, a year ago, that's in the studies,
[21:56.520 --> 22:01.520]  that's known, it's also linked to cancer, I can show you the LA Times, I can show you
[22:01.520 --> 22:04.440]  Wired Magazine, I can show you the studies.
[22:04.440 --> 22:09.160]  So when you're watching this, understand that what Icke is saying is backed up by a lot
[22:09.160 --> 22:15.000]  of research, but maybe it's not true, still he has a right to say it, doesn't he?
[22:15.000 --> 22:21.560]  So, London Real and Mr. Rose and Mr. Icke aren't being censored because they're lying
[22:21.560 --> 22:27.040]  to people, they're being censored because humanity's resonating with what they say,
[22:27.040 --> 22:31.760]  and to blame David Icke or myself, as they've been doing in the news, for all these 5G towers
[22:31.760 --> 22:34.800]  getting burned down is fraud.
[22:34.800 --> 22:38.160]  I'm not saying burned these down, neither is David, we're simply saying studies show
[22:38.160 --> 22:44.960]  they're linked to cancer, and people are then taking action because Big Tech has been censoring
[22:44.960 --> 22:48.000]  them, so now they're fighting in the 3rd dimension.
[22:48.000 --> 22:54.680]  So I interviewed Mr. Rose today for several hours, it's powerful, it's posted at band.video,
[22:54.680 --> 22:59.800]  but he told the world, please host this yourself so people can see it.
[22:59.800 --> 23:05.080]  It's had 3 million views in the last day since they posted it on their site, but bandwidth
[23:05.080 --> 23:08.360]  costs are hammering them, believe me, I know.
[23:08.360 --> 23:13.120]  So I've agreed to post it in full here at band.video, and so I hope you watch it, I hope you research
[23:13.120 --> 23:18.960]  it, and then I hope you share it, and I hope you go over and visit London Real and support
[23:18.960 --> 23:22.840]  what they're doing, and support in full or as what we're doing, because we're building
[23:22.840 --> 23:28.480]  independent pro-human media outlets that will challenge Big Tech and big media censorship
[23:28.480 --> 23:30.600]  at a time that is beyond critical.
[23:30.600 --> 23:39.000]  So here is the 2 plus hour unedited feed that was live of London Real, including the intro
[23:39.000 --> 23:40.880]  where they're not even sure they're live yet.
[23:40.880 --> 23:44.200]  So you see the full thing in context.
[23:44.200 --> 23:48.440]  Very important interview, very powerful, and that's why Big Brother tried to ban it, but
[23:48.440 --> 23:52.800]  thanks to you and the support of Band.video, it lives on, so download it and share it and
[23:52.800 --> 23:55.160]  repost it while you still can.
[23:55.160 --> 24:04.240]  This is London Real, I am Brian Rose, my guest today's...
[24:04.240 --> 24:14.520]  Alright folks, I wanted to just show you the intro to what's on Band.video to obviously
[24:14.520 --> 24:18.320]  pick your interest and go watch it, and even though I disagree with some of what David
[24:18.320 --> 24:25.440]  says on virus theory overall, 100%, I've shown you all the mainstream articles, AP, Reuters,
[24:25.440 --> 24:31.920]  the studies, Wired Magazine, 5G does cause cancer in all these major studies, but Big
[24:31.920 --> 24:35.040]  Wireless is spending hundreds of millions of dollars in propaganda, so you don't know
[24:35.040 --> 24:36.040]  about it.
[24:36.040 --> 24:37.040]  That was two years ago.
[24:37.040 --> 24:40.400]  Now the propaganda is working, I mean even mainstream publications just say, there are
[24:40.400 --> 24:43.080]  no studies, it's all made up, it's totally good for you.
[24:43.080 --> 24:49.760]  You can find hundreds of thousands of articles going back 30 plus years on the internet, literally
[24:49.760 --> 24:53.960]  hundreds of thousands of them about the studies about cell phone radiation and other systems
[24:53.960 --> 24:54.960]  giving you cancer.
[24:54.960 --> 25:00.720]  I mean, it's not debated.
[25:00.720 --> 25:06.360]  They have sculling crossbones on the towers saying, get back, this emits radiation that's
[25:06.360 --> 25:09.400]  harmful to life, with the sculling crossbones.
[25:09.400 --> 25:14.480]  Remember being like three years old saying, dad, why is there a skull on this bottle?
[25:14.480 --> 25:17.480]  And he goes, that's cause there's poison in there, son.
[25:17.480 --> 25:22.480]  Now there's a 10 year old article in BBC, hell 20 years, that's from 99.
[25:22.480 --> 25:30.400]  Immune system attacked by mobile phones, big studies, but the BBC today says you don't
[25:30.400 --> 25:31.400]  question that.
[25:31.400 --> 25:36.840]  But I agree with about 95% of what I said in that interview, but why is this important?
[25:36.840 --> 25:42.760]  They banned it and then they misrepresented, what's in it?
[25:42.760 --> 25:49.160]  I saw studies 25 years ago in prestigious journals that five minutes holding a cell
[25:49.160 --> 25:53.960]  phone up your head raised the temperature of the entire brain.
[25:53.960 --> 26:02.000]  They did electrodes one degree and right through the skull, very, very thin right there at
[26:02.000 --> 26:07.320]  the temple, it was raising it up to five degrees.
[26:07.320 --> 26:14.640]  Look at the studies, five degrees.
[26:14.640 --> 26:16.440]  You know, people are living in denial.
[26:16.440 --> 26:22.600]  There used to be videos on YouTube where folks would put bleach or poison on a bunch of sushi
[26:22.600 --> 26:26.800]  and worms would come out and people thought it was fake.
[26:26.800 --> 26:29.160]  No, it's real.
[26:29.160 --> 26:38.120]  That's just another example of how people are in denial about things they can't see.
[26:38.120 --> 26:45.320]  You're looking at a piece of sushi, you don't see the quarter inch worm in there.
[26:45.320 --> 26:46.320]  You see an apple.
[26:46.320 --> 26:53.160]  I remember being a little kid going back to stories and we're in an apple orchard on my
[26:53.160 --> 26:55.840]  dad's ranch, his parents' ranch at the time, we're picking apples and I go, oh, that's
[26:55.840 --> 26:56.840]  not a good one.
[26:56.840 --> 26:57.840]  See that hole?
[26:57.840 --> 27:01.200]  There's a worm in there eating and I go, I don't see a worm.
[27:01.200 --> 27:03.920]  My dad took a knife out, sliced it in half and that was that worm.
[27:03.920 --> 27:09.200]  Boy, I thought he was cool because, you know, you're three years old, you don't, you don't,
[27:09.200 --> 27:10.320]  you don't see the worm.
[27:10.320 --> 27:12.040]  You don't believe an apple has a worm in it.
[27:12.040 --> 27:17.160]  Folks, this is invisible radiation, but it's killing us.
[27:17.160 --> 27:20.320]  And when Woody Harrelson came out and spoke out against us, they said, oh, crazy, Woody
[27:20.320 --> 27:23.120]  Harrelson, he says it's making the virus.
[27:23.120 --> 27:27.840]  No, he put out a study that he tweeted a study that notice they never showed you what he
[27:27.840 --> 27:28.840]  actually said.
[27:28.840 --> 27:30.520]  They just misrepresented what Woody Harrelson said.
[27:30.520 --> 27:31.520]  They misrepresented what I said.
[27:31.520 --> 27:36.400]  They misrepresented what David I said.
[27:36.400 --> 27:42.040]  Just for David, there are major scientific theories that most viruses are produced by
[27:42.040 --> 27:47.840]  mammals or animals and that they are a way to sloughing off toxins and the mitochondria
[27:47.840 --> 27:50.480]  gets rid of it by producing it.
[27:50.480 --> 27:54.120]  And that so you find disease or poison folks and then you find high levels of virus as
[27:54.120 --> 27:55.120]  well.
[27:55.120 --> 27:56.120]  Evidence is overwhelming.
[27:56.120 --> 27:57.120]  It's the other way around.
[27:57.120 --> 28:01.760]  When you're run down, then viruses are able to attack you and yes, humans do shuffle off
[28:01.760 --> 28:08.680]  and sluff off viruses, but anybody knows can tell you have sex with somebody with herpes.
[28:08.680 --> 28:09.680]  You get the herpes virus.
[28:09.680 --> 28:11.520]  It goes into your skin and starts replicating.
[28:11.520 --> 28:12.520]  You get lesions.
[28:12.520 --> 28:18.360]  So, but it's OK that David's wrong in part about one theory he's putting out.
[28:18.360 --> 28:21.160]  There are a lot of medical doctors that would disagree.
[28:21.160 --> 28:22.600]  Maybe you say I'm wrong.
[28:22.600 --> 28:29.800]  He's doing it in good faith and they're lying about 5G causing cancer.
[28:29.800 --> 28:31.720]  So why are you censoring him?
[28:31.720 --> 28:34.080]  Even if he was lying, let us judge.
[28:34.080 --> 28:38.440]  Pull videos at man.video.
[28:38.440 --> 28:43.000]  You know, I've got news so big that I don't know how to get to it.
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  It's official.
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  We talked about it a few weeks ago.
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  David and I broke it.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.080]  It was just a month ago.
[28:48.080 --> 28:49.080]  It's official.
[28:49.080 --> 28:51.960]  They've announced the Mark of the Beast World Government and plantable chips starting next
[28:51.960 --> 28:52.960]  year.
[28:52.960 --> 28:53.960]  Yeah.
[28:53.960 --> 28:54.960]  And they're just announcing like no big deal.
[28:54.960 --> 28:55.960]  We'll tell you about it when we come back.
[28:55.960 --> 28:57.960]  Stay with us.
[28:57.960 --> 29:01.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[29:01.000 --> 29:06.320]  So do you know who's on your wireless network, whether it's a big company selling your data
[29:06.320 --> 29:07.480]  or a foreign hacker?
[29:07.480 --> 29:11.240]  If you're not protected, everybody sees your information.
[29:11.240 --> 29:16.480]  That's why you need Flash Routers, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.
[29:16.480 --> 29:21.160]  Flash Routers uses a virtual private network or VPN to protect your online activity from
[29:21.160 --> 29:26.400]  hackers, trackers and large corporations and not just one, but all your devices with one

[29:59.080 --> 30:04.200]  It's been sold out for more than four months, but our best-selling vitamin D3 and vitamin
[30:04.200 --> 30:08.560]  K formula is back in stock, Winter Sun.
[30:08.560 --> 30:12.120]  In the fall, in the winter, as you know, your body, when you're not getting sunlight on
[30:12.120 --> 30:18.000]  the skin, does not produce vitamin D3, so it's important to ingest it.
[30:18.000 --> 30:21.080]  But a lot of people do not absorb it well in the gut.
[30:21.080 --> 30:26.280]  So you take this formula under the tongue, it tastes sweet naturally, let it sit there
[30:26.280 --> 30:32.080]  about 30 seconds to a minute, and then you swallow the rest, and it's just amazing.
[30:32.080 --> 30:37.040]  It's back in stock, and yes, we're going to offer it a 50% off because that's the right
[30:37.040 --> 30:38.800]  thing to do during this crisis.
[30:38.800 --> 30:40.640]  So Winter Sun, 50% off.

[30:58.800 --> 31:03.480]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[31:03.480 --> 31:09.200]  Sure, coffee, candy, and other highly sugar-filled drinks can give you a short boost, but the
[31:09.200 --> 31:11.760]  crash always follows.
[31:11.760 --> 31:17.840]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go when you need a little help
[31:17.840 --> 31:19.240]  with turbo force.
[31:19.240 --> 31:25.640]  Similar to other mix-in energy packets, turbo force from Infowars Life utilizes vitamins,
[31:25.640 --> 31:32.640]  amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years across the world to provide focus,
[31:32.640 --> 31:35.880]  clarity, and a boost of energy when you need it.
[31:35.880 --> 31:43.000]  Turbo force is certainly a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable, and tasty energy.
[31:43.000 --> 31:48.640]  Speaking of affordable, you can even try turbo force for a limited time at an incredible
[31:48.640 --> 31:50.640]  40% off.
[31:50.640 --> 31:58.840]  Don't wait till it's out of stock again and get turbo force right now, only at infowarstore.com.
[31:58.840 --> 31:59.840]  It's Wednesday morning.
[31:59.840 --> 32:04.120]  I was just in a local Austin business that was basically empty, and there were three
[32:04.120 --> 32:06.120]  motorcycle police in there.
[32:06.120 --> 32:09.440]  And I said, what do you think of this whole coronavirus thing?
[32:09.440 --> 32:13.040]  And they're like, ah, it looks like it's a hoax.
[32:13.040 --> 32:14.880]  And I said, yeah, you're absolutely right.
[32:14.880 --> 32:21.040]  The way it's been handled is a hoax, taking everybody that dies who happens to test positive,
[32:21.040 --> 32:26.560]  even though they die of a heart attack or cancer or diabetes, as dying from coronavirus
[32:26.560 --> 32:27.560]  is the big one.
[32:27.560 --> 32:31.680]  And then, of course, they're also classifying everybody that test positive for coronavirus,
[32:31.680 --> 32:36.520]  period, not just COVID-19, as having it.
[32:36.520 --> 32:40.400]  So they're upping a number of cases, they're upping a number of deaths, but still more
[32:40.400 --> 32:45.840]  people died this week and last week than died from the coronavirus from suicide.
[32:45.840 --> 32:50.040]  So if anything, it's causing divorces and suicide and stir craziness and basic insanity
[32:50.040 --> 32:55.200]  and a giant power grab with big pharma preparing a forced inoculation, which they even admit
[32:55.200 --> 33:22.200]  will not protect you from next year's mutation of the coronavirus.
[33:55.200 --> 34:08.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide, and I'm going to have to go to
[34:08.200 --> 34:09.200]  rebroadcast.
[34:09.200 --> 34:10.200]  I can't do the show at this point.
[34:10.200 --> 34:12.000]  And this is not a dramatic thing.
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.800]  This news is too important.
[34:14.800 --> 34:18.080]  And I'm not just going to sit here and rattle this off at people, okay?
[34:18.080 --> 34:20.080]  I have to go get prepared in my office.
[34:20.080 --> 34:21.080]  I have to get some clips.
[34:21.080 --> 34:22.080]  I have to do some things.
[34:22.080 --> 34:23.080]  And I may be back.
[34:23.080 --> 34:24.080]  I might be back tomorrow.
[34:24.080 --> 34:25.680]  I don't know at this point.
[34:25.680 --> 34:26.680]  Okay.
[34:26.680 --> 34:31.080]  So let me tell you what we're going to air here, and then I'm going to show you the proof
[34:31.080 --> 34:37.600]  that what they're doing will kill billions of people and that they admit it, billions.
[34:37.600 --> 34:43.880]  And I'm going to show you the proof that they are openly announcing an implantable digital
[34:43.880 --> 34:49.480]  tattoo that you'll have to have that's sewn into your skin that's invisible that you'll
[34:49.480 --> 34:54.060]  have to prove you've taken all the vaccines and medical tyranny that they track you with
[34:54.060 --> 34:57.880]  to buy, sell, travel, or have a job.
[34:57.880 --> 35:02.440]  The Mark of the Beast is official.
[35:02.440 --> 35:09.480]  And I'm not being dramatic when I talk about all this, and I just can't come on here when
[35:09.480 --> 35:12.960]  I'm not totally focused and talk about these issues.
[35:12.960 --> 35:19.760]  I just can't do it.
[35:19.760 --> 35:23.840]  So I have to go get ready for the show now, and if I'm able to come back, I'll come back.
[35:23.840 --> 35:26.680]  I may not come back today.
[35:26.680 --> 35:28.760]  This is a time of mourning for humanity.
[35:28.760 --> 35:30.400]  This isn't business as usual.
[35:30.400 --> 35:34.760]  This isn't, we're just doing a show talking about all this, and it's all cutesy that the
[35:34.760 --> 35:38.360]  New World Order is coming true, so, oh, Alex, you've got so much credibility.
[35:38.360 --> 35:42.400]  This is a time of great sorrow that they're actually making this move against us and announcing
[35:42.400 --> 35:44.880]  world government and forced inoculations.
[35:44.880 --> 35:48.280]  And of course, it won't be the little chip that we all warned about forever.
[35:48.280 --> 35:52.840]  It's going to be a digital tattoo sewn into you with nanotech officially being announced
[35:52.840 --> 35:57.560]  with the Pentagon being told to be ready to enforce it next year, and all the big tech,
[35:57.560 --> 36:02.640]  all the big employers, and the grocery stores are going to make you have it to buy and sell.
[36:02.640 --> 36:05.440]  And they're going to peer pressure you, and they're all going to come down at once just
[36:05.440 --> 36:07.720]  like revelations says.
[36:07.720 --> 36:10.800]  And they're on TV saying they love to drink the blood of children and kill babies and
[36:10.800 --> 36:14.040]  worshiping Satan, and saying they're going to merge with AI gods.
[36:14.040 --> 36:20.160]  I mean, this is horrible.
[36:20.160 --> 36:24.280]  So when I get to this, I wanted the clip that I said was the most important ever.
[36:24.280 --> 36:29.200]  About a month ago, Trump said, listen, you shut down the economy.
[36:29.200 --> 36:35.000]  It's going to kill a lot more people than this virus, and it's not the cruise fault.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.120]  They can't find it.
[36:37.120 --> 36:40.800]  They found all these other places where he says similar things about suicides up and
[36:40.800 --> 36:42.000]  it's going to kill the economy.
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.320]  No, no, he said it's going to kill a lot of people, and I have all the documents and
[36:45.320 --> 36:50.080]  all the articles where they admit that now.
[36:50.080 --> 36:59.600]  And then we've got Governor Cuomo saying that this is never going to end and that this is
[36:59.600 --> 37:01.200]  the new permanent.
[37:01.200 --> 37:02.200]  This is the takeover.
[37:02.200 --> 37:03.200]  This is it.
[37:03.200 --> 37:11.760]  So I'm going to play the excellent piece that Greg Rees put together with myself on the
[37:11.760 --> 37:15.080]  history of the eugenicist and where they come from, the organizations.
[37:15.080 --> 37:18.920]  We're going to air that piece, and then I'm going to go to my office, I'm going to get
[37:18.920 --> 37:19.920]  on a computer terminal.
[37:19.920 --> 37:25.320]  I'm going to get that clip, get that clip, because I'm going to play that clip when
[37:25.320 --> 37:27.560]  I cover all this.
[37:27.560 --> 37:29.200]  And then I'm going to get into the microchip.
[37:29.200 --> 37:30.200]  This is big, folks.
[37:30.200 --> 37:34.000]  This is you call everybody about this and make a big deal about it.
[37:34.000 --> 37:39.880]  Okay, here's the Greg Rees report.
[37:39.880 --> 37:46.200]  Nearly 2,400 years ago in ancient Greece, Plato discussed the importance of population
[37:46.200 --> 37:48.200]  control.
[37:48.200 --> 37:53.520]  Aristotle advocated the use of abortion and infanticide.
[37:53.520 --> 38:00.680]  In 1798, an essay on the principle of population was written by Thomas Malthus.
[38:00.680 --> 38:07.800]  He outlined the idea of positive checks, which are diseases, wars, disasters, famines and
[38:07.800 --> 38:09.760]  genocides.
[38:09.760 --> 38:14.760]  Malthus believed that these things should be utilized to increase the death rate and
[38:14.760 --> 38:20.120]  believe that human misery was an absolute necessary consequence.
[38:20.120 --> 38:25.000]  In 1859, Charles Darwin published The Origin of Species.
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.520]  In it, Darwin only hinted at the implications of human populations, but his cousin, Sir
[38:30.520 --> 38:34.360]  Francis Galton, became obsessed with the idea.
[38:34.360 --> 38:40.120]  In 1883, Galton published inquiries into human faculty and its development, wherein
[38:40.120 --> 38:45.680]  he wrote that his intention is to touch on various topics more or less connected with
[38:45.680 --> 38:51.800]  that of the cultivation of race or, as we might call it, with eugenic.
[38:51.800 --> 38:57.800]  The term comes from the Greek word eugenus of noble birth.
[38:57.800 --> 39:03.960]  In the early 20th century, eugenics became an academic discipline in universities.
[39:03.960 --> 39:07.640]  Organizations were formed and funded to win public support.
[39:07.640 --> 39:13.120]  The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and the Cold Spring Harbor Institute rejected the idea
[39:13.120 --> 39:19.880]  that all humans are born equal and began selling the idea of cultivating a new master race
[39:19.880 --> 39:22.960]  of noble bloodlines.
[39:22.960 --> 39:29.240]  Planned parenthood was formed in America by racial eugenics advocate Margaret Sanger.
[39:29.240 --> 39:35.920]  President of IBM, Thomas J. Watson, established a special subsidiary in Poland called Watson
[39:35.920 --> 39:41.160]  Business Machines to assist in the Nazi invasion of Poland.
[39:41.160 --> 39:46.160]  This business continued throughout the war, and IBM managed the entire operation from
[39:46.160 --> 39:49.080]  their headquarters in New York.
[39:49.080 --> 39:54.600]  During the Nuremberg trials, the Nazis quoted U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell
[39:54.600 --> 39:56.960]  Holmes in their own defense.
[39:56.960 --> 40:02.480]  They claimed that their eugenics program was being run from the United States.
[40:02.480 --> 40:07.800]  The Nazis were rightly admonished for war crimes, but not Thomas Watson.
[40:07.800 --> 40:14.400]  He went on to create the IBM World Trade Corporation and passed IBM onto his son.
[40:14.400 --> 40:19.360]  His granddaughter ended up marrying Margaret Sanger's grandson.
[40:19.360 --> 40:24.160]  Bill Gates' father worked on the board for Planned Parenthood, and his mother worked
[40:24.160 --> 40:30.680]  on the corporate board for IBM, who Bill partnered with to create Microsoft.
[40:30.680 --> 40:36.200]  With no medical background, Bill Gates then went on to become the world's foremost pusher
[40:36.200 --> 40:40.680]  of vaccines and population control.
[40:40.680 --> 40:44.200]  Do you think this is all coincidence?
[40:44.200 --> 40:52.920]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funds the WHO, the NIH, the CDC, and the UN.
[40:52.920 --> 40:58.800]  And now he is saying that until we get mass vaccinations, we might never be able to gather
[40:58.800 --> 40:59.800]  in groups.
[40:59.800 --> 41:05.560]  And which activities, like mass gatherings, may be in a certain sense more optional.
[41:05.560 --> 41:12.640]  And so until you're widely vaccinated, those may not come back at all.
[41:12.640 --> 41:17.640]  The president's coronavirus response team are all pushing the Bill Gates vaccination
[41:17.640 --> 41:18.640]  agenda.
[41:18.640 --> 41:23.600]  Dr. Fauci is on the leadership council for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[41:23.600 --> 41:30.080]  In January of 2017, Anthony Fauci told a crowd at Georgetown University that there would
[41:30.080 --> 41:33.920]  be a surprise outbreak during the Trump presidency.
[41:33.920 --> 41:38.600]  There is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in
[41:38.600 --> 41:44.040]  the arena of infectious diseases, both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already
[41:44.040 --> 41:48.080]  ongoing disease, and we have certainly a large burden of that.
[41:48.080 --> 41:51.400]  But also there will be a surprise outbreak.
[41:51.400 --> 41:57.120]  Deborah Birx is a board member for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria,
[41:57.120 --> 42:01.920]  which was founded by the Gates Foundation and known for millions of dollars of fraudulent
[42:01.920 --> 42:03.840]  misuse of funds.
[42:03.840 --> 42:11.560]  In October of 2019, Bill Gates sponsored Event 201, a simulation that estimated 65 million
[42:11.560 --> 42:15.040]  people killed by coronavirus.
[42:15.040 --> 42:21.680]  In November of 2019, the Peer Bright Institute, funded by Bill Gates, was granted European
[42:21.680 --> 42:31.800]  patent number EP3172319B1 for a coronavirus vaccine that may be used to treat humans.
[42:31.800 --> 42:37.280]  Today, Dr. Fauci says the virus will keep coming back, and he says the ultimate game
[42:37.280 --> 42:40.240]  changer will be a new vaccine.
[42:40.240 --> 42:45.480]  In Australia, the prime minister is telling people the shutdown will last months, that
[42:45.480 --> 42:48.840]  it's the new normal, and that the only way out of your...
[42:48.840 --> 42:54.160]  And now, the governor and the AP of New York is saying it will never end.
[42:54.160 --> 42:58.600]  That's right, it's a total power grab in plattable microchips.
[42:58.600 --> 43:04.480]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[43:04.480 --> 43:10.080]  And luckily, our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stock full of high quality
[43:10.080 --> 43:13.880]  Info Wars store, Patriot Blend coffee.

[43:20.760 --> 43:25.360]  coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[43:25.360 --> 43:30.640]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[43:30.640 --> 43:36.320]  There has never been a more important time to support Info Wars, so if you love coffee
[43:36.320 --> 43:41.640]  and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[43:41.640 --> 43:48.000]  Order now at the Info Wars store, sign up for auto ship and get your own high quality
[43:48.000 --> 43:57.600]  supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at infowarstore.com.
[43:57.600 --> 44:01.680]  I don't need to remind you how four years ago I told you the polls against Trump were
[44:01.680 --> 44:02.680]  fake.
[44:02.680 --> 44:07.840]  He was winning by a giant margin, but election fraud almost stole the election from Trump
[44:07.840 --> 44:08.840]  and the American people.
[44:08.840 --> 44:14.960]  Well, now they're pushing the idea that, oh, cancel the Republican-Democrat convention,
[44:14.960 --> 44:19.400]  maybe cancel the election a year like the Olympics.
[44:19.400 --> 44:25.240]  That's because they know Trump in every internal scientific poll is 20 points ahead of the
[44:25.240 --> 44:26.880]  brain damage by...
[44:26.880 --> 44:31.080]  So they can say, sir, you look big like the Olympics, go ahead and back it off a year
[44:31.080 --> 44:34.560]  and then you'll still win in a year after you fix the crisis, no.
[44:34.560 --> 44:39.400]  They need more time to cook up an assassination, an economic collapse, a new virus.
[44:39.400 --> 44:43.920]  Trump needs to say, no, in America we keep elections on time, have the elections, win
[44:43.920 --> 44:47.440]  by a landslide and not give the globalists what they want.
[44:47.440 --> 44:51.920]  Hillary, Biden, they all want us to spend the election, we shouldn't give them what
[44:51.920 --> 44:52.920]  they want.
[44:52.920 --> 45:00.400]  We need to have a vote in America and reelect Trump 2020.
[45:00.400 --> 45:04.680]  Do yourself a favor and fund the info war at the same time.
[45:04.680 --> 45:09.440]  Go to infowarstore.com and read about the ingredients, the highest quality like black
[45:09.440 --> 45:13.600]  walnut and others that are in this baby and then read some of those reviews to yourself
[45:13.600 --> 45:15.240]  and then don't just believe info wars.
[45:15.240 --> 45:20.360]  Go out online at major nutrition sites and others and look at the studies for yourself.
[45:20.360 --> 45:24.240]  Go out and engage in your first amendment right to research and your first amendment
[45:24.240 --> 45:29.440]  right to tell others about the incredible compounds God has given us through Mother Nature.
[45:29.440 --> 45:34.560]  Living Defense is at infowarstore.com sold out for four months, now back in stock for
[45:34.560 --> 45:37.280]  limited time at 40% off.
[45:37.280 --> 45:41.960]  People are doing their own research and they're getting Living Defense at 40% off at infowarstore.com
[45:41.960 --> 45:46.120]  and we've got our great super blue toothpaste, the best seller for five years with the nano
[45:46.120 --> 45:51.000]  silver, the tea tree and the iodine, it's selling out still 50% off and the iodine selling
[45:51.000 --> 45:59.160]  out the X3, it's 60% off because I want you to experience how amazing it is.
[45:59.160 --> 46:05.920]  Across Europe, across the UK and the United States, humans are beginning to attack 5G
[46:05.920 --> 46:07.920]  and other cell tower systems.
[46:07.920 --> 46:12.360]  It's on record that these systems cause massive increases of cancer.
[46:12.360 --> 46:18.000]  They're bombarding us with a weapon system and they're surveilling us.
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.440]  Now I'm not encouraging people to go out and burn these things down or destroy them but
[46:22.440 --> 46:28.320]  what I'm saying is this, when you attack people with electromagnetic radiation and with microwaves
[46:28.320 --> 46:32.280]  and when the public sees the effects, when they put them on top schools and they have
[46:32.280 --> 46:38.440]  huge cancer clusters, the globalists are going to have major pushback and now Google is banning
[46:38.440 --> 46:44.120]  anybody that criticizes 5G in any way, they have truly proven that they are the definition
[46:44.120 --> 46:49.760]  of anti-human evil and they've thrown in with the chikons who support absolute tyranny
[46:49.760 --> 46:55.200]  on levels never before seen but the human rebellion against the technocracy has begun
[46:55.200 --> 46:56.800]  and will not be stopped.
[46:56.800 --> 47:22.720]  Join the rebellion now.
[47:22.720 --> 47:50.960]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[47:52.720 --> 47:59.040]  They're most successful potential operation.
[47:59.040 --> 48:01.560]  I mean if I was them, this is what I'd do.
[48:01.560 --> 48:07.360]  It's exactly what we predicted down in the letter, it's their game plan medical tyranny
[48:07.360 --> 48:12.560]  force inoculation, digital implanted IDs to prove it but notice how we called a microchip.
[48:12.560 --> 48:17.080]  Oh, it's a digital implanted ID and they're openly saying next year they've got it all
[48:17.080 --> 48:18.080]  ready to roll out.
[48:18.080 --> 48:23.840]  They have a night broke this a month ago with an MIT whistleblower, now a month later, it's
[48:23.840 --> 48:27.480]  like a hundred years later, they're like oh yeah, it's great, it's wonderful, I'll cover
[48:27.480 --> 48:34.200]  that at six after next hour from MIT and from Bill Gates saying it themselves.
[48:34.200 --> 48:37.000]  People are like why is this guy suddenly all over TV?
[48:37.000 --> 48:38.960]  He's like he's president of the world.
[48:38.960 --> 48:42.840]  I told you he's the chief science officer of the new world order.
[48:42.840 --> 48:53.080]  He runs the Carnegie, the Ford, the Rockefeller, all of the major depopulation foundations,
[48:53.080 --> 49:02.600]  the IBM money, it's all behind him and the cult, the globalist cult is a depopulation
[49:02.600 --> 49:06.680]  cult ladies and gentlemen.
[49:06.680 --> 49:13.040]  So he's carrying out for the owners of the planet that's stolen it by fraud their depopulation
[49:13.040 --> 49:20.000]  operation where they get to play God and so folks over the years like why do you harp
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.000]  on Bill Gates?
[49:21.000 --> 49:22.000]  Well, why do you harp on Jeffrey Epstein?
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.160]  Why do you say they got islands in the Caribbean?
[49:25.160 --> 49:29.760]  Because it's well known and you're like but why do they want to do this?
[49:29.760 --> 49:40.360]  Because they're devil worshipers, they like to kill people, they do it on a mega scale,
[49:40.360 --> 49:42.360]  all official life.
[49:42.360 --> 49:49.280]  The Nazis were nothing but tinker toys to these people, training wheels.
[49:49.280 --> 49:53.040]  Now I want to get to some positive news on the Bill Gates front, that's why they're
[49:53.040 --> 49:58.280]  getting rid of comments on every major news publication out there because they're not
[49:58.280 --> 50:03.800]  news, they're propaganda and I want to show you this, Google put out their Google Doodle
[50:03.800 --> 50:10.760]  thanks custodians, sanitation workers battling coronavirus and promises them that soon robots
[50:10.760 --> 50:14.440]  will replace them so they'll be safe.
[50:14.440 --> 50:18.560]  Post human error is here and when you click on the Google Doodle it shows thousands of
[50:18.560 --> 50:24.440]  articles about how wonderful Bill Gates is and how wonderful Google is as Bill Gates
[50:24.440 --> 50:31.200]  is around the whole show and how they care about you and care about humans.
[50:31.200 --> 50:35.320]  But Google's helps suppress three million Uighurs in China in forced labor camps and
[50:35.320 --> 50:36.320]  death camps.
[50:36.320 --> 50:40.320]  Google helps surveil and control the Chinese people and us, Google runs the censorship and
[50:40.320 --> 50:44.560]  works with big pharma and all the toxins and poisons and they're involved with the vaccine
[50:44.560 --> 50:47.080]  that Bill Gates is controlling, the Sterilent.
[50:47.080 --> 50:52.080]  Oh, but they're thanking you, the workers, they love you, even though they're building
[50:52.080 --> 50:54.240]  a post human world.
[50:54.240 --> 51:00.640]  So Bill Gates showing himself as a good little prisoner behind the glass, look it's dangerous,
[51:00.640 --> 51:06.240]  this is how you act, monkey see monkey do, and one of his armored fortresses, thank you
[51:06.240 --> 51:07.240]  healthcare.
[51:07.240 --> 51:12.200]  Oh, you're the good guys, but who runs healthcare, this guy does and we're going to inject you
[51:12.200 --> 51:14.240]  and we got a microchip for you.
[51:14.240 --> 51:20.680]  You can't shake hands, you can't go out in public, you're good little cowards, you've
[51:20.680 --> 51:24.480]  passed the test, now we're going to totally enslave you and then we'll hit you with a
[51:24.480 --> 51:27.240]  real bio weapon.
[51:27.240 --> 51:35.560]  But you go to Bill Gates's Instagram comments and look, every comment, I mean I sat there
[51:35.560 --> 51:40.280]  this morning, read like a hundred up, there might be some that are pro says we know you're
[51:40.280 --> 51:44.280]  behind it, we know your dad ran Planned Parenthood, we know you patented the vaccine, you're a
[51:44.280 --> 51:48.600]  monster, you're trash, we're aware of you, we know what you're doing.
[51:48.600 --> 51:54.480]  There they are alarm.
[51:54.480 --> 52:00.360]  There's a more powerful force behind Bill Gates is controlling all of this, think deeper.
[52:00.360 --> 52:03.920]  That's why they don't have these bots coming out that poses humans to outnumber us and
[52:03.920 --> 52:06.840]  say no, no, no.
[52:06.840 --> 52:10.000]  Someone should do a change.org, stop Bill Gates.
[52:10.000 --> 52:13.880]  Bill Gates started the coronavirus, that's what they're saying.
[52:13.880 --> 52:19.200]  If you and your vaccine get ready for a fight, Bill, because you won't win, the people are
[52:19.200 --> 52:20.200]  waking up.
[52:20.200 --> 52:23.080]  That's right, put a hundred percent box, ban us all, we'll pass it on, word of mouth,
[52:23.080 --> 52:28.440]  we know who you are and you want to fight, you're going to get one scum.
[52:28.440 --> 52:34.920]  You seem to be really enjoying all this microchipping mass control manipulation, 5G mandatory vaccines,
[52:34.920 --> 52:38.880]  whatever happened to our human rights, freedom of speech control over our own bodies and
[52:38.880 --> 52:44.800]  the freedom to choose for ourselves.
[52:44.800 --> 52:49.680]  People are woke, you cannot hide from God's judgment, he's coming.
[52:49.680 --> 52:53.480]  More people are waking up, Billy, judgment awaits you.
[52:53.480 --> 52:59.200]  He wants us in the bunker because he's in his bunker, but you got a lot of sheep folks,
[52:59.200 --> 53:04.320]  I live by a golf course, they've stopped the golfers on it and I go out there and there
[53:04.320 --> 53:09.160]  are people walking on the sides of it and just a virtue signal, you'll be 30, 40 feet
[53:09.160 --> 53:17.640]  away sitting there, overlooking the cliffs and the creek with my middle daughter when
[53:17.640 --> 53:21.880]  we were walking to the day, the people were going on a path, they would go away from the
[53:21.880 --> 53:25.720]  path away from us and look at us, it's all about just who's your bad, we're good, we're
[53:25.720 --> 53:31.800]  virtue signalers, those people are robots, they don't count.
[53:31.800 --> 53:37.240]  This is all social engineering, now I'm going to play part of this because it's about taking
[53:37.240 --> 53:43.200]  action, the full video is up on InfoWars.com, this is Brian Rose of London Real with the
[53:43.200 --> 53:46.840]  big sensor, David I can interview, talking about on the show yesterday and talking about
[53:46.840 --> 53:50.520]  courage and how it's contagious because this is the answer, here it is and we'll start
[53:50.520 --> 53:53.960]  the second hour.
[53:53.960 --> 53:58.320]  Good morning everyone and greetings from London, it's been one of the most unique weeks of
[53:58.320 --> 53:59.320]  my life.
[53:59.320 --> 54:07.520]  I'm not going to lie, it's been off the chart crazy to think that just three days ago everything
[54:07.520 --> 54:14.080]  was kind of normal-ish at London Real in my life and then all of a sudden everything exploded
[54:14.080 --> 54:21.200]  and both myself and London Real kind of hit the front page of a lot of global news sites,
[54:21.200 --> 54:27.600]  I mean there were articles written in Polish, in Portuguese, in Russian and on the front
[54:27.600 --> 54:34.280]  page of the BBC all talking about us and are what I guess is an active protest, I guess
[54:34.280 --> 54:41.440]  it's a claiming of our right to say what we want to say wherever it is, in print, out
[54:41.440 --> 54:46.560]  of our mouths or even on a digital platform and we just kind of assumed that would be
[54:46.560 --> 54:52.040]  okay and we found out real quick that it wasn't okay with some people and this whole quote
[54:52.040 --> 54:56.560]  unquote fight ensued and I would have never guessed that so many people would have been
[54:56.560 --> 55:03.280]  united and aligned over this one thing, we've had so many of our civil liberties slowly
[55:03.280 --> 55:09.000]  taken away from us over the years, our right to privacy, our right to be tracked, cameras
[55:09.000 --> 55:14.880]  everywhere here in London, so who would have thought that not being able to speak your
[55:14.880 --> 55:21.880]  opinion on a digital platform would be such a problem for people and so refreshing to
[55:21.880 --> 55:26.560]  see that it is and that's what we've seen, just a rallying of support from around the
[55:26.560 --> 55:30.880]  world, there's massive interest in this and you know it really capped off last night when
[55:30.880 --> 55:36.600]  I was on Alex Jones Info Wars, now you can say what you want about Alex alright and
[55:36.600 --> 55:41.400]  he has been controversial in the papers and I definitely don't agree with all the decisions
[55:41.400 --> 55:45.760]  that Alex has made, some of them are wrong and I think he'd admit that as well but the
[55:45.760 --> 55:50.560]  man is a legend, he really is, when it comes to independent media it doesn't get much
[55:50.560 --> 55:53.320]  of a break, come back with the rest of this and then I'm going to get into the big world
[55:53.320 --> 55:57.000]  government, Margaret the Beast officially announced okay, just a month ago we told you
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.640]  about this, it was secret now, it's public, I mean they're moving on every front the humanity
[56:00.640 --> 56:04.600]  is waking up, we'll come back with this important point about courage is contagious and then
[56:04.600 --> 56:09.280]  we'll get to that report then we'll also get into the proof that this is killing the economy
[56:09.280 --> 56:13.200]  globally and going to kill the poorest people on the earth, well you talk about migrants
[56:13.200 --> 56:18.240]  surges, get ready for them, this is the globalist war, it's humanity we predicted, another way
[56:18.240 --> 56:22.640]  for you to fight back is voting with your speech, voting with your word of mouth, please
[56:22.640 --> 56:28.560]  tell everybody about band.video, infowords.com, spread it via word of mouth, it's so critical,
[56:28.560 --> 56:33.800]  tell them, hear what's being said for yourself, not just what they misrepresent, which then
[56:33.800 --> 56:36.880]  they take out of context but obviously I don't remember everything I've ever said, I've
[56:36.880 --> 56:40.840]  learned a lot over the years, all of us have, we're all not perfect here and you know trying
[56:40.840 --> 56:46.880]  to get closer to God and then also understand, just because of the overblown the virus and
[56:46.880 --> 56:51.600]  all the rest of that, thank God, the power grab is very real, the attack on the economy
[56:51.600 --> 56:56.720]  is very real and all the other viruses and things are real and the flu is real and this
[56:56.720 --> 57:02.760]  virus does kill some people, that's why you need to take care of your body and the best
[57:02.760 --> 57:08.440]  ways to do that is eat good, non-gmo food, drink a lot of pure clean water and get a
[57:08.440 --> 57:13.840]  high quality multivitamin mineral with amino acids like real red pill, real red pill plus,
[57:13.840 --> 57:19.920]  real 50% off, get your X3, X2 is sold out, X3 is excellent as well, it's amazing when
[57:19.920 --> 57:23.360]  it does to your body, a basic welding block that so many people are deficient in, that's
[57:23.360 --> 57:27.280]  60% off because I want to just sell it out, I'm selling a lower price, it's going to sell
[57:27.280 --> 57:31.480]  out, it's the right thing to do and we also have back in stock vitamin mineral fusion,
[57:31.480 --> 57:39.160]  50% off and of course we also have the vitamin D3 winter sun that's critical back in, all
[57:39.160 --> 57:46.160]  at InfoWarStore.com, 40 to 60% off and it funds this operation a revolutionary activity.
[57:46.160 --> 57:52.160]  Since the invention and deployment of radar during World War II, scientists have noted
[57:52.160 --> 57:58.200]  increased cancers and other health problems with those who were close to the devices,
[57:58.200 --> 58:02.600]  that's where they're really high powered, if you're a quarter mile from a cell tower
[58:02.600 --> 58:06.480]  there's not any real high powered radiation hitting you, but if you're a couple hundred
[58:06.480 --> 58:11.040]  feet away, they got fences around them with skull and crossbones on them for a reason,
[58:11.040 --> 58:17.360]  it says it can hurt you, so now with 5G that's even stronger, these systems are literally
[58:17.360 --> 58:23.080]  above the streets, just 20 or 30 feet from people's heads, from their genitals, from
[58:23.080 --> 58:27.560]  their bodies, people are burning them down and attacking them all over the world now,
[58:27.560 --> 58:33.880]  I'm saying don't do that, use information warfare, use the truth to expose it and sue
[58:33.880 --> 58:39.560]  local governments and others until they remove them, that's the way to deal with this ladies
[58:39.560 --> 58:44.960]  and gentlemen, take action in the information war, but I gotta tell you, I can't blame the
[58:44.960 --> 58:49.320]  people that are doing it because they're under assault.
[58:49.320 --> 58:54.000]  What's amazing about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights is that even though it's
[58:54.000 --> 59:00.960]  240 years old, it's more pertinent and more powerful today than it's ever been.
[59:00.960 --> 59:06.400]  We look at the huge AI takeover and total surveillance of our lives and the tyranny
[59:06.400 --> 59:12.480]  that comes with it, the oppression, and it's all linked to not having due process and not
[59:12.480 --> 59:20.720]  having a Fourth Amendment against being illegally surveilled, it's all predicated on having
[59:20.720 --> 59:25.320]  no privacy, if we simply embrace the Bill of Rights and Constitution and enforce that
[59:25.320 --> 59:30.360]  against big tech, they would never get away with this, but because we're not enforcing
[59:30.360 --> 59:35.680]  our Bill of Rights and Constitution based in common sense, the bottom is falling out
[59:35.680 --> 59:41.520]  and the sky is just the beginning, it's certainly not the limit, that's why we're rediscovering
[59:41.520 --> 59:46.280]  what made America great and what the Renaissance is all about, true human empowerment, it begins
[59:46.280 --> 1:00:14.120]  at infowars.com.
[1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:21.960]  I can feel my human will to survive supercharging, but there's a dark side to that, it's because
[1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:28.680]  we're in grave danger, you feel that spirit, you all see it, you say oh this is good, I
[1:00:28.680 --> 1:00:36.760]  pull you out of your eyes and it's only because you're awake, billions are entranced.
[1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:44.480]  We belong to God, we belong to life, we must break the trance, we must defeat the transhuman
[1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:53.080]  assailants, we must insure their destruction, we must commit, we must call down the power
[1:00:53.080 --> 1:01:00.200]  of God and say we are not afraid and throw ourselves against the enemy, instead of shopping
[1:01:00.200 --> 1:01:08.120]  for this clip dealing with what is contagious.
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:12.320]  When it comes to independent media, it doesn't get much better than Alex Jones, it really
[1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:17.240]  doesn't, he is OG gangster to the max, I mean he was really building his own newsroom
[1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:21.960]  and pumping out content, I mean probably 20 years ago and I was talking to him off camera
[1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:26.720]  last night and he was telling me a story of how like back in the day, you know Joe Rogan
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:30.880]  his good friend was visiting him and Joe started asking questions like oh how do you do this
[1:01:30.880 --> 1:01:36.240]  and wear the microphones, I mean you know if Alex inspired Joe, Joe inspired me then
[1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:41.360]  technically Alex Jones inspired me, he's like two generations above and being on the
[1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:46.160]  show was just epic yesterday, he runs like a radio show, like a TV show, it's live and
[1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:50.360]  you know he's assistance in my ear and he's running these ads in between that sell his
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:55.440]  products that keep his old empire going and he does it without digital programs, he's
[1:01:55.440 --> 1:01:59.200]  been banned on YouTube, banned on Twitter, banned on Facebook, banned on everything and
[1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:03.480]  he was telling me off camera, he's like Brian, he's like I'm bigger than ever now, I'm bigger
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:07.120]  than ever because people want to plug in, they come to my website, they come see me
[1:02:07.120 --> 1:02:12.320]  because they know they can't get it other places and I'm still doing what I'm doing
[1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:16.600]  and I was really impressed with him and he just blew me away, he said Brian I watch your
[1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:20.080]  stuff all the time, I'm on the treadmill, I'm watching your interviews, he said I love
[1:02:20.080 --> 1:02:24.040]  your style, I love how you put the time in, I wish I could do that, he said I got all
[1:02:24.040 --> 1:02:28.280]  these interruptions here, I wish I could really sit down for a long form, he's like I played
[1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:31.720]  your episode with David Ike with my wife, we watched the whole thing, I know David, I
[1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:35.200]  love David, I respect David and he's like you know I really appreciate you, I mean it
[1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:38.800]  was just crazy you know, you don't think people are noticing what you do, especially someone
[1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:44.280]  at that level and it was cool to hear and I'm going to keep talking to Alex, I might
[1:02:44.280 --> 1:02:47.560]  go back next week and just give him an update on what's happening with this situation but
[1:02:47.560 --> 1:02:53.320]  it was pretty incredible and he said one thing on the show, he said Brian what you're doing
[1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:58.800]  takes a lot of courage and I don't know if that's true but let's say it's true and he
[1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:03.880]  said the good thing about courage is it's infectious, when people see it they have courage
[1:03:03.880 --> 1:03:08.360]  and then when other people see that they have courage and pretty soon we've got an army
[1:03:08.360 --> 1:03:14.400]  of people moving into the fear, this illusion out there of control which doesn't really
[1:03:14.400 --> 1:03:19.000]  exist you know, it's a few people out there that literally have half the population of
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:23.520]  the planet locked down right now and doing whatever they say because they're engineering
[1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:27.720]  this state of fear and when you see someone with courage and we've all seen it, it's in
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:32.920]  our great stories, it's in our great movies and great books and great biblical stories,
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:37.800]  it's really infectious and I didn't think about it that way but I guess that's what
[1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:41.360]  we're kind of making people feel around the world and I'm getting so many messages from
[1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:45.920]  people at high levels from my past, this is like this is your life Brian Rose, I'm getting
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:50.200]  people, I haven't talked to in 10 years ago, 20 years, I'm saying hey keep up the good
[1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:53.560]  fight, we're behind you Brian, what do you need, you need anything, I got people that
[1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:58.000]  will hide me out places, I got people that will send me private jets, I got all sorts
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:02.280]  of people, people that are copying all my content and locking it up, I mean there's
[1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:07.480]  like all sorts of help out there I have if we need it and that's a beautiful thing and
[1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:13.560]  so what I want to leave you with today is courage is, it's infectious and if you show
[1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:17.280]  courage today in any aspect of your life, people will come with you and people will
[1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:21.480]  come with you and I mean look folks, let's be honest, this is the time to do it, you
[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:27.280]  know, if we don't all kind of get our shizzle together on this planet for a variety of reasons,
[1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:31.240]  it's not looking good and so we got to go back to the basics, we've been talking here
[1:04:31.240 --> 1:04:35.320]  on London Real last week, I was talking about the Daily Five, how to survive and thrive
[1:04:35.320 --> 1:04:40.840]  in these times of crisis, yeah, we got caught up in this whole crazy YouTube banning thing
[1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:45.000]  but let's get back to the basics, you know, this is still about every day building the
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:49.360]  best version of yourself, you know, transforming yourself and that means doing the hard internal
[1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:53.240]  work and we can point at the Boogeyman out there and you know, I don't know, is that
[1:04:53.240 --> 1:04:59.080]  the globalist according to Alex and I love that term by the way, it's Alex Jones here
[1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:05.040]  with a very important announcement, we are selling out of all of our high quality iodine
[1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:10.120]  products at M4store.com, the super blue toothpaste that has it along with the nano silver and

[1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:26.720]  We have 160, almost 160 million jobs in this country now, the most ever by far, by far
[1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:33.560]  the most ever, the number of jobs, almost 160 million, so we can't turn that off and
[1:06:33.560 --> 1:06:37.280]  think it's going to be wonderful, there will be tremendous repercussions, there will be
[1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:43.080]  tremendous death from that, death, you know you're talking about death, probably more
[1:06:43.080 --> 1:06:50.280]  death from that than anything that we're talking about with respect to the virus.
[1:06:50.280 --> 1:06:55.480]  Wonder who they're looking to.
[1:06:55.480 --> 1:07:02.040]  Coming up, at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to present you the numbers from the
[1:07:02.040 --> 1:07:09.400]  World Health Organization, the UN, UNICEF, since they're our bosses, but those are real
[1:07:09.400 --> 1:07:14.720]  numbers very accurate when it comes to the number of people dying currently from the
[1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:22.720]  shutdown is in the millions, the millions, but there, let's put up on screen when we
[1:07:22.720 --> 1:07:29.520]  do that at the bottom of the hour, the number of deaths worldwide, but Stalin said one man
[1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:36.600]  dies, it's a tragedy, 10,000 diets are statistic, one person gets eaten by a great white shark
[1:07:36.600 --> 1:07:43.560]  off San Diego and for up to a year, half the folks don't go in the water, even though
[1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:54.320]  people die in San Diego every day in automobile accidents and the real sharks are metal, millions
[1:07:54.320 --> 1:08:01.880]  die a year from hunger, wait till I give you those numbers, bottom of the hour, 189 million
[1:08:01.880 --> 1:08:09.560]  people have died from hunger since 1990 conservatively, 7 million died during the Great Depression
[1:08:09.560 --> 1:08:20.680]  from malnutrition and then I've got all the articles where they admit it, half a billion
[1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:28.280]  more people face poverty to virus, AP, including millions facing starvation, but that's okay,
[1:08:28.280 --> 1:08:37.320]  it's fun to wear the mask and get scared and everyone works together, they take your common
[1:08:37.320 --> 1:08:43.960]  sense of working together and hey, let's wear a mask, hey, let's not go out because you're
[1:08:43.960 --> 1:08:50.360]  a good person, you're not a coward, you're doing it because you've been taught that's
[1:08:50.360 --> 1:08:55.120]  how you help, but they didn't tell you that for the 35,000 a year in the flu here because
[1:08:55.120 --> 1:08:59.520]  they know it doesn't stop it and they know the virologists understand that the faster
[1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:05.240]  you get a new flu, the more it burns through people and the faster you get herd immunity.
[1:09:05.240 --> 1:09:10.960]  I'm going to play you the former head scientist at the Rockefeller University on this coming
[1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:18.440]  up, bottom of the hour, you know, we don't just sit here and make this stuff up and even
[1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:21.760]  though the Rockefellers are bad news, they've got all the smart people working for them
[1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:25.360]  so they can control them with grants or a lot of them are getting pissed and quitting
[1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:29.400]  and going public.
[1:09:29.400 --> 1:09:39.600]  So things have got to get really, really bad before humanity wakes up, don't they?
[1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:49.120]  Now everybody virtue signals they want to save people, but if you really want to be
[1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:56.400]  racist and you really don't like brown people, then you should support this shutdown because
[1:09:56.400 --> 1:10:01.520]  it's going to kill hundreds of millions of them.
[1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:11.120]  See, a real exterminist doesn't wear a KKK outfit, that's usually run by the ADL on record.
[1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:14.960]  The Southern primary law center, they run most of the groups and they're run by them
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:19.040]  and they go out and find million old people just for news ops to scare everybody.
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:20.040]  That's come out.
[1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:26.120]  But see, the real eugenicists, well, they're the liberals, they fund Black Lives Matter
[1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:32.320]  so that they send out racist, horrible, evil black people to do horrible things, kill cops
[1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:34.240]  to then demonize all the black people.
[1:10:34.240 --> 1:10:37.480]  I mean, this is really elementary stuff going on.
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:43.200]  And if you think God is going to recognize you, if you're involved in killing babies
[1:10:43.200 --> 1:10:53.440]  of any color, or if you get off on killing brown people, God does not recognize you.
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:10:59.960]  It doesn't matter if they dumb down and turn the brown people into raving racist lunatics,
[1:10:59.960 --> 1:11:03.440]  they've been programmed.
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:08.160]  And if we're going to transcend the New World Order, we're going to have to understand that
[1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:11.200]  and stop playing into it and get the scam.
[1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:13.680]  And if we don't get the scam, it's only going to get worse.
[1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:18.600]  Does that mean I like in my life growing up in Dallas and running into racist black people
[1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:21.720]  that physically attacked me or said horrible things, and then I hear later how I'm racist
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:22.720]  because I'm white?
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:26.520]  I get that level of the reality, just like if you're black and had racist whites do something
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:28.560]  to you, you know that's real.
[1:11:28.560 --> 1:11:29.560]  But it doesn't matter.
[1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:37.880]  The thing above it is manipulating us to end humans as we know it.
[1:11:37.880 --> 1:11:42.040]  So yeah, being tribal is very real for all of our existence.
[1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:44.800]  We were around tribes that looked like us.
[1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:48.560]  Whites were killing whites, blacks were killing blacks, Asians were killing Asians.
[1:11:48.560 --> 1:11:53.240]  That's why statistically, the Asians kill each other a lot more and hate each other
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:57.280]  a lot more because they have old beefs, epigenetic memories.
[1:11:57.280 --> 1:12:02.040]  It's not just that blacks live close to blacks, that they tend to one kill each other over
[1:12:02.040 --> 1:12:03.040]  whites.
[1:12:03.040 --> 1:12:10.760]  They kill whites because there's an epigenetic memory proven in instincts of killing people
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:14.840]  that look like you because that's who you've been killing.
[1:12:14.840 --> 1:12:19.920]  You're getting a sophisticated scientific psychology here, but it's real science, folks.
[1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:26.960]  But now that the world got like this, now we're killing each other in mass groups and
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:30.920]  it is race against race.
[1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:40.720]  So I mean, I grew up in Dallas, Texas and I mean, black people would just start beating
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:43.320]  each other for no reason.
[1:12:43.320 --> 1:12:50.080]  Now we know what's going on and then sometimes, you know, black folks would attack me.
[1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:57.400]  But the point was, is that because there's a genetic memory doing that, there's an instinct.
[1:12:57.400 --> 1:13:01.280]  When black dudes get around a bunch of other black dudes, there's such a tribal memory
[1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:04.600]  of when a bunch of black dudes show up, you don't know, they're coming to kill your ass.
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:05.600]  You better start killing.
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:07.560]  Well, it's the same thing with Europeans.
[1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:16.840]  That's why we're warlike because our bodies remember killing to live.
[1:13:16.840 --> 1:13:21.440]  And the globalists know all of this and they're manipulating it.
[1:13:21.440 --> 1:13:27.160]  But once you're aware of that, you can transcend it and understand what your instincts are.
[1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:30.200]  And then use your instincts for what you want.
[1:13:30.200 --> 1:13:34.560]  They will reward you, they will empower you, you will feel good, you will live longer, you're
[1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:36.360]  doing your mission.
[1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:42.480]  But you have to choose the instincts and nurture the ones that are good and useful now, not
[1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:46.640]  the ones that aren't useful.
[1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:48.080]  You control your environment.
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:53.160]  You are an advanced species.
[1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:56.200]  And the globalists are saying, we're going to control the environment to protect ourselves,
[1:13:56.200 --> 1:13:57.520]  wear masks, don't shake hands.
[1:13:57.520 --> 1:13:59.160]  And at one level, that's true.
[1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:00.160]  It's terrible.
[1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:04.240]  35,000 died from the flu, tens of thousands from the cold every year who were run down
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:08.400]  and malnourished.
[1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:12.680]  But the idea that they're locking us all up and doing all this to protect us is a fraud.
[1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:19.140]  The very people doing it admit it's about permanent martial law and implantable digital
[1:14:19.140 --> 1:14:21.600]  nanotech beyond the chip.
[1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:22.600]  It's all official now.
[1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:26.000]  I'm going to cover next segment to buy and sell to have a job and leave your house.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  And it's now here.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  They're doing it.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:33.720]  And Bill Gates and Warren Buffett and Ted Turner and the Australian Prime Minister and
[1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:39.440]  all the UN, they're all and Governor Cuomo are all saying it's never ending.
[1:14:39.440 --> 1:14:40.600]  It's permanent.
[1:14:40.600 --> 1:14:41.600]  This is the new normal.
[1:14:41.600 --> 1:14:48.680]  Cuomo said that today, Associated Press in a speech that you guys at the video.
[1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:49.680]  This is not the new normal.
[1:14:49.680 --> 1:14:51.720]  This is the new enslavement.
[1:14:51.720 --> 1:14:52.720]  But they're normalizing.
[1:14:52.720 --> 1:14:53.720]  Boom.
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:55.800]  Suddenly it's a whole new world.
[1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:57.120]  That's how revolutions happen.
[1:14:57.120 --> 1:14:58.880]  That's how military attacks happen.
[1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:05.120]  That's how Blitzkriegs happen.
[1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:06.240]  Armies rarely declare war.
[1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:08.320]  They line up on your border.
[1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:11.600]  They send their spies in and you see it all of a sudden and there's chatter.
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:12.600]  You feel it.
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:15.320]  And all of a sudden the cannons open up.
[1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:18.880]  And all of a sudden your sentries get stabbed in the neck.
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:20.680]  And notice the media is getting shut off.
[1:15:20.680 --> 1:15:21.680]  People are getting shut down.
[1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:22.680]  Everybody's getting intimidated.
[1:15:22.680 --> 1:15:24.800]  And all of a sudden, boom, it hits.
[1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:25.800]  You see China.
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:26.800]  The Domino falls.
[1:15:26.800 --> 1:15:27.800]  Everybody's in lockstep.
[1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:28.800]  Boom.
[1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:32.240]  It's called lockstep in the Rockefeller plant.
[1:15:32.240 --> 1:15:35.800]  Lockstep marching straight into hell.
[1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:41.040]  So you're about to see the third world completely brought down and you're going to be begging
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:44.160]  the government to mow down millions trying to pour over the border.
[1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:47.280]  I have foreseen their operation because they told us what they did.
[1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:49.280]  And so much more.
[1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:51.600]  They're about to turn the world upside down.
[1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:55.640]  The honeymoon of my friends is over.
[1:15:55.640 --> 1:16:00.200]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[1:16:00.200 --> 1:16:02.120]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:03.840]  I had a problem like you once.
[1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:09.280]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:10.380]  my life.
[1:16:10.380 --> 1:16:15.640]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:19.920]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it
[1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:24.000]  alone, you need to call the national treatment advisers.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:28.720]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:31.000]  and totally change your life.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:36.240]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:39.520]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:40.520]  Get clean.

[1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:09.720]  CoQ10, oh you probably want to spend some time researching CoQ10 and then research
[1:18:09.720 --> 1:18:16.560]  DNA Force Plus and the types that we have in here, the very best forms of the BQQ and
[1:18:16.560 --> 1:18:24.160]  CoQ10 and then a whole bunch of other natural ingredients for Mother Nature that are known
[1:18:24.160 --> 1:18:25.960]  to supercharge it all.
[1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:31.880]  This is our best selling overall formula and I told listeners at the end of last year
[1:18:31.880 --> 1:18:37.400]  that we can't sell products at 50% off anymore because there's not enough markup in them
[1:18:37.400 --> 1:18:41.880]  to fund our operations, but because of what's happening and going on in the world right
[1:18:41.880 --> 1:18:48.640]  now, I really want everybody who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of DNA Force
[1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:57.480]  Plus to have DNA Force Plus for yourself and your family, DNA Force Plus now 50% off.
[1:18:57.480 --> 1:19:04.840]  Something huge is happening all over the United States on ABC, CBS, NBC, on local Fox affiliates
[1:19:04.840 --> 1:19:09.400]  but only local ones, they're having medical doctors on who successfully treated their
[1:19:09.400 --> 1:19:15.680]  patients with 100% recovery rates with hydroxychloroquine but you've got to have the zinc.
[1:19:15.680 --> 1:19:21.840]  This is a known fact but national news other than Fox will not carry it and when Tucker
[1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:26.040]  Carlson, Laura Ingram and Shawna Anady covered it and had medical doctors talk about it,
[1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:30.720]  they got demonized and Fox had them basically shut up but they've been vindicated, info
[1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:35.200]  awards has been vindicated, we were saying at first with experts we had on air, we got
[1:19:35.200 --> 1:19:40.720]  attacked nationally and they said take us off the air, Google took our app away saying
[1:19:40.720 --> 1:19:46.080]  that we were putting out fake cures for saying hydroxychloroquine, zinc and Z-Pak but all
[1:19:46.080 --> 1:19:50.440]  we were doing was reporting with medical journals were saying, big pharma and the globalist
[1:19:50.440 --> 1:20:00.280]  want you sick and dead and they don't want you to boost your immune system, screw them.
[1:20:00.280 --> 1:20:02.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:30.280 --> 1:20:44.600]  All right ladies and gentlemen, I did not watch Fox News last night and I was unaware
[1:20:44.600 --> 1:20:48.920]  of this and I was just about to cover this topic, I've been building it up for an hour
[1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:56.720]  and 20 minutes and then during the break I see it on infowars.com and it just hit me
[1:20:56.720 --> 1:21:09.900]  like a ton of bricks and I read the transcript that's on infowars.com with what the Attorney
[1:21:09.900 --> 1:21:18.080]  General is saying, AG Barr very concerned over Bill Gates digital vaccine certificate
[1:21:18.080 --> 1:21:24.200]  calls lockdown measures draconian once it gone by May, well that's the best thing we've
[1:21:24.200 --> 1:21:30.240]  seen from bar yet, people say well he's been part of the deep state, well is that a suicide
[1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:31.240]  pact?
[1:21:31.240 --> 1:21:36.880]  I mean this has got to get turned around man, they're going full Hitler but 2.0, I mean
[1:21:36.880 --> 1:21:44.760]  this is Hitler 2.0 with bells and whistles and clown horns, I mean this is, if this,
[1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:50.720]  if the stuff going on was in a science fiction book 20 years ago predicting it in 2020, you'd
[1:21:50.720 --> 1:21:56.320]  say this is ridiculous, but of course it was all predicted on this show because these
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:03.520]  crazies were proposing it and I went and looked into them and they run everything.
[1:22:03.520 --> 1:22:08.240]  So the fact that you see Trump pushing back saying this will kill a lot of people and
[1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:16.400]  the fact that this is Big Brother is very, very, very good.
[1:22:16.400 --> 1:22:22.840]  So there it is ladies and gentlemen, AG Barr very concerned over Bill Gates digital vaccine
[1:22:22.840 --> 1:22:28.480]  certificates calls lockdown measures draconian once gone by May, I'm very concerned about
[1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:34.760]  the slippery slope in terms of continuing encroachments on personal liberty, Barr said.
[1:22:34.760 --> 1:22:37.880]  You know in fact just get the Lord Ingram interview, I'm going to air it when we come
[1:22:37.880 --> 1:22:41.360]  back, I'm just going to air the whole thing, this is too huge, hey you don't need me to
[1:22:41.360 --> 1:22:46.640]  say it, you know I have the Attorney General saying it, I came on the air today and I done
[1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:50.560]  some research last night on it, I was going to already going to cover it and then Daria,
[1:22:50.560 --> 1:22:55.080]  the lead producer called me or I called her back last night at like nine and she said
[1:22:55.080 --> 1:23:00.160]  listen you really need to cover the digital certificate because in that is they always
[1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:04.920]  have one thing that's bad enough, a certificate to travel and leave your house and have a
[1:23:04.920 --> 1:23:11.160]  job showing you've had all the stuff that Bill Gates in the UN says you've got to take,
[1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:17.840]  it's not just COVID-19 vaccine, but hitting right in it is oh by the way don't worry nobody
[1:23:17.840 --> 1:23:23.760]  can see it, it takes about five minutes a needle injects a bunch of nanotech beads in
[1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:32.120]  you a whole bunch of chips that drift around in your body and they scan it and they've
[1:23:32.120 --> 1:23:37.520]  got bars they put in your thing with needles, I mean this is, it's like a cattle tag in
[1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:42.880]  your damn ear, it gets even crazier than I thought it would be at this point, it's just
[1:23:42.880 --> 1:23:48.440]  a sudden leap that's how tyranny works, it's a, it's a, a globalist obsessed with leaps
[1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:55.360]  with their whole evolutionary leap, well this is a leap down a black hole to hell and see
[1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:59.440]  what's happening is everybody heard me talk about like papers in the UN and Club of Rome
[1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:05.240]  and CFR and Rockefeller Carnegie and I'd show you a memorandum 200 you know calling for
[1:24:05.240 --> 1:24:13.400]  killing five billion people and I, well still that's academic, well this isn't academic,
[1:24:13.400 --> 1:24:17.760]  it's like getting a brochure about skydiving you're like oh I could drive 20 minutes over
[1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:22.880]  here they, I'll jump with an instructor and they'll pull the cord and it's safer than
[1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:29.160]  driving to, okay sounds pretty good, but it's one thing to read a brochure, to get in a
[1:24:29.160 --> 1:24:36.600]  car go there, sign up and now you're in the airplane and the door opens up, but we've
[1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:41.960]  now been shoved out the door, but this isn't skydiving, this is world government forced
[1:24:41.960 --> 1:24:51.680]  inoculations, total tracking and microchips sewn into our skin, you're not just going
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:25:01.960]  to pluck it out, they're going to inject your body with it, imagine if Martians landed
[1:25:01.960 --> 1:25:06.960]  and they said we've got the cures, the cancer and everything, just take this shot with these
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:12.120]  nanobots that protect you, we'd go we don't trust your ass, hell no, but instead it's
[1:25:12.120 --> 1:25:17.840]  Bill Gates up there who says he wants to kill most people that are so repopulated, but now
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:23.040]  he's like oh I'm going to inject you with it, with a shot and you know I'm going to
[1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:31.400]  track you, what the hell, and I'm so pissed man when I'm a couple days before that I was
[1:25:31.400 --> 1:25:39.280]  at the park, took my almost three year old daughter to the park and I'm sitting there
[1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:41.880]  and they've got yellow tape all around the park, I forgot to cover that sort of picture
[1:25:41.880 --> 1:25:45.280]  so that, so she's running around climbing on some other stuff and there's joggers and
[1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:49.400]  people and bike riders stopping and they're like looking at us like we're bad and going
[1:25:49.400 --> 1:25:55.200]  around us even further, 50 feet long enough just even more because they love it, they've
[1:25:55.200 --> 1:25:59.680]  had the spirit, they're all programmed, hey you go take your chips from Bill Gates, you
[1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:04.640]  take all your vaccines, you go have Parkinson's and you crawl in a hole and die, not me man
[1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:08.400]  and everybody I know is the same way right now, that's why they're boarding up all the
[1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:12.120]  shops and getting ready for civil unrest because they're going to keep this going as long as
[1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:16.040]  they can and Trump understands it and is trying to turn the economy back on because if he
[1:26:16.040 --> 1:26:20.200]  didn't shut some things down they'd say every debt was his fault because we're so weak
[1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:26.200]  we all got into the fear and even the unknown, I mean I knew it was a global scam but still
[1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:35.000]  I'm like well we better double check here and all of a sudden we are completely down the
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:39.560]  total rattle.
[1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:52.200]  All of a sudden, so like I said, I don't know, I don't feel like I see me on air right now,
[1:26:52.200 --> 1:27:00.800]  this is so huge, you know that's really what it is, my body is saying why are you on air,
[1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:10.400]  you should be marching to attack people, I'm not calling for that, that's epigenetic, they've
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:14.000]  got it all set up where we're the bad guys and we defend ourselves, if you burn down
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:18.360]  a cell tower they're hitting you with magnetic radiation, all the studies give you cancer
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:21.440]  and they're surveilling you and they didn't ask you and they've come into your community
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:26.240]  and they're forcing it on you, it's lowering your immunity and they're banning you if you
[1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:34.120]  criticize it, they're sticking an electronic ball gag in your mouth, they're raping us.
[1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:38.000]  So you've got every right as the Declaration of Independence says to form an army and to
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:42.520]  march up there and remove their ass but the society is so demonic and so weak and so
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:46.760]  uninformed right now, you'd end up, if you overthrew the corrupt government you'd get
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:50.440]  assassinated and a worse group would come in, we have to reteach the Bill of Rights
[1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:58.240]  Constitution and rugged individualism and we have to activate locally and enforce justice.
[1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:02.120]  So if you're not going to get in the info war now with whatever stunt you've got to pull
[1:28:02.120 --> 1:28:07.560]  that's legal and lawful to warn people to take action, you're never going to fight
[1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:14.840]  physically if you have to, but I'll say this is a red-blooded human, I've not seen anything
[1:28:14.840 --> 1:28:20.580]  as pretty as those 5G towers burning, I mean it's like the symbolism of fireworks the
[1:28:20.580 --> 1:28:26.360]  4th of July symbolizes bombs raining down on the 4th and in the morning the flag was
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:30.200]  still there, they were there all night getting hit by those 20-something ships and still
[1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:33.440]  there in the morning and the flag had holes all shot through it, it was still there even
[1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:42.120]  sexier with all those scars, well I gotta tell you, I got a big ol' John Hard on looking
[1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:46.120]  good and I'm not telling you to go out and do that, I'm just telling you as a man, it's
[1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:52.120]  good to see some action isn't it, let me tell you something, there's more than one way
[1:28:52.120 --> 1:28:56.400]  to skin a cat.

[1:29:56.760 --> 1:30:05.280]  As predicted the human rebellion against globalist machines has begun, the LA Times,
[1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:11.240]  The Washington Post, Wired Magazine all reported years ago that major studies show 5G caused
[1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:17.560]  increased cancer in rats, it's a fact, 5G is just a later generation of systems that
[1:30:17.560 --> 1:30:24.440]  are on record for more than 70 years to cause cancer, they rub the DNA molecules together,
[1:30:24.440 --> 1:30:27.000]  they are microwaves.
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:32.520]  Well now, YouTube has admitted to the BBC and others that they're banning anyone criticizing
[1:30:32.520 --> 1:30:38.320]  5G, even if you don't connect to coronavirus, they're banning it, but the studies do show
[1:30:38.320 --> 1:30:44.200]  that 5G lowers your immunity to viruses period, they're peer reviewed journals, we're showing
[1:30:44.200 --> 1:30:48.880]  these documents on air and the globalist can go to hell, the human rebellion against

[1:31:06.600 --> 1:31:10.240]  in the fall, in the winter as you know, your body when you're not getting sunlight on the
[1:31:10.240 --> 1:31:17.000]  skin does not produce vitamin D3, so it's important to ingest it, but a lot of people
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:22.280]  do not absorb it well in the gut, so you take this formula under the tongue, it tastes sweet
[1:31:22.280 --> 1:31:28.240]  naturally, let it sit there about 30 seconds to a minute and then you swallow the rest

[1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:20.040]  and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:20.040 --> 1:33:26.560]  The Republic of Free Humanity, I'm Alex Jones your host, alright, I'm going to get into
[1:33:26.560 --> 1:33:31.920]  Bill Gates at his nightmare plan and I didn't know that the Attorney General was on Lord
[1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:37.080]  Ingram last night, I didn't know he said that it's horribly evil and very draconian,
[1:33:37.080 --> 1:33:42.000]  just that we're going to have travel certificates and implanted digital injections that show
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:49.480]  we've had the vaccine, I mean this is just a total takeover, the worst possible revelations
[1:33:49.480 --> 1:33:57.720]  manifest by evil eugenicist psychotic, who's running the whole operation with the Chicox.
[1:33:57.720 --> 1:33:59.960]  But oh, the Chinese do it, we better do it.
[1:33:59.960 --> 1:34:05.360]  A month ago, David Knight got an MIT email from a whistleblower, sent us documents about
[1:34:05.360 --> 1:34:16.320]  a digital tattoo about a travel certificate to buy and sell and people said this, there's
[1:34:16.320 --> 1:34:21.960]  no way this is real, and then a week later Singapore announced the travel passes and
[1:34:21.960 --> 1:34:25.560]  the forced inoculations and we're going to be put in place and the Australian Prime
[1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:29.440]  Minister a week ago said, we're going to have a lockdown to the vaccines there and
[1:34:29.440 --> 1:34:34.040]  leave your house, you left out the vaccine and Bill Gates went on television last week
[1:34:34.040 --> 1:34:39.880]  and said the same thing and now he's saying it again, he watches Bill Gates, no, he's
[1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:45.160]  the front man for the big foundations that openly are pushing this, like the Rockefeller
[1:34:45.160 --> 1:34:52.680]  Carnegie and the foundation set up by IBM to establish all this, so I'm really upset
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:59.360]  about this, that Gates is giving interviews, Gates is going around, I have a big stack
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:04.240]  of articles right here and our videos are about to play and he's announcing by next
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:10.000]  year they'll have implantable chips in us that's sewn into your skin, so you have to
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:14.400]  chop out a big piece of your skin to get rid of it, into your cells, the whole bunch of
[1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:23.880]  nanotech, it's them saying this, this isn't saying it's in a white paper, it's here, MIT,
[1:35:23.880 --> 1:35:28.920]  most of the government's involved and I said if Trump doesn't block this then it doesn't
[1:35:28.920 --> 1:35:32.920]  matter, he's let them censor, he's let them track, now they're in people's private messages,
[1:35:32.920 --> 1:35:41.040]  blocking messages you can send, Facebook and others are, is there no end to this and I
[1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:47.000]  was so upset this morning, literally, that I couldn't hardly do the show, I said I can't
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:50.680]  believe this isn't a bigger deal, you heard me last hour, I said I don't know if I can
[1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:57.800]  do the show and I wasn't throwing a fit, I'm like just ashamed of humanity and then all
[1:35:57.800 --> 1:36:03.800]  of a sudden I hit refresh on infowars.com and it was on Laura Ingham last night, 13
[1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:09.920]  minute interview where Barr says this is absolutely evil, we've got to block it, this is crazy,
[1:36:09.920 --> 1:36:14.960]  we've got it in the lockdown, we've got to stop this and we've got embedded corporations
[1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:18.680]  that want power in other groups and it's the Democrats and it's the blue cities that want
[1:36:18.680 --> 1:36:22.520]  to keep things locked down to hold the economy hostage, they get it, they're saying it, it's
[1:36:22.520 --> 1:36:26.340]  the truth, thank God we're starting to turn the corner and Drudge reports got the Ron
[1:36:26.340 --> 1:36:30.200]  Paul interview up, they're saying the same thing, that finally the resistance is building
[1:36:30.200 --> 1:36:37.200]  to coronavirus, house arrest orders is about time, yes, yes and again there's a paradox,
[1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:42.840]  if you knew there was a bomber that was going to put a truck of C4 into a public school
[1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:47.600]  and kill a couple hundred kids, you'd say send out helicopters, swat teams, do whatever
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:52.320]  you have to stop it, but if it's viruses you can't stop, it's part of life, mainly killing
[1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:58.760]  folks that it's time to go, do we lock everyone down forever because we can't allow people
[1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:06.440]  to die, it's BS, yes the deaths are real, but way overblown and yes the nutrients almost
[1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:11.440]  make you invincible if you have them, the problem is when you're 89 years old your body doesn't
[1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:15.680]  absorb it anymore, your cells are old, you can take a bunch of zinc, you're not getting
[1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:21.600]  into your cells, because the Bible says you live to 75 if you're really nice to your parents
[1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:39.880]  and are a good clean person and boy that's how long you live on average, 75, average men
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:40.880]  and women together, 75 and so they go, we can't allow, look like school students, we
[1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:43.680]  have to get rid of everybody's guns because there's about 100 kids a year dying when crazies
[1:37:43.680 --> 1:37:48.400]  go kill them, we're like well statistically this is very rare, shut up you don't care
[1:37:48.400 --> 1:37:56.160]  about the 100 kids, well we're talking about 20, 30, 40,000 here, this is real, but it's
[1:37:56.160 --> 1:38:00.600]  zooming in on something and blowing it up to scare everybody, so I was super upset and
[1:38:00.600 --> 1:38:05.200]  praying during the breaks, I mean I've just been going, God why don't they care, why does
[1:38:05.200 --> 1:38:09.880]  it trump, and I almost came out against Trump this morning and I almost blew up and I said
[1:38:09.880 --> 1:38:15.520]  no I trust Trump, he's good, I said to make people pay attention I think I'm gonna smash
[1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:18.960]  this desk because I've been wanting to overturn it for a while, see it's not fake what I do
[1:38:18.960 --> 1:38:24.080]  but I suppress my feelings so that if I was gonna let myself turn the desk over it wouldn't
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:29.400]  be like a rock star breaking up their guitar for attention, it's that I want to do it,
[1:38:29.400 --> 1:38:34.120]  I've suppressed it so it's real when I do it but I let myself, I was gonna smash the
[1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:44.280]  desk and smash the studio today and then quit, and for a while just to say this isn't normal
[1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:49.160]  microchips, world government, force inoculations, paedophiles running everything, dressed up
[1:38:49.160 --> 1:38:57.680]  in count Dracula outfits, and then I hit refresh, and I hit refresh on N4, it's only been up
[1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:00.680]  about 10 minutes and I didn't get mad at the girl, I'm like get me that article, get me
[1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:08.680]  that article, they're like, I was like, I like read the treasure, I mean we gotta turn the
[1:39:08.680 --> 1:39:17.440]  corner sometime, holy hell, God almighty, what, I mean, because here's the thing, I'm not
[1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:22.160]  a violent person but I'm not gonna put up with this crap anymore and I know you're not
[1:39:22.160 --> 1:39:26.800]  but they're gonna blow stuff up and blame it on us, watch, when they start to force
[1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:30.320]  chipping and here's the thing, they're gonna have all these idiots, the attorney general
[1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:34.360]  is gonna block it, China's gonna do it, Europe's gonna do it, and they're gonna say, you wanna
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:43.800]  go to Europe, you get a damn chip, it's really a nanotech system, you take this digital mark
[1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:49.640]  that they track you with, and it'll just be something like TSA we get sick of and we finally
[1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:56.240]  just do it, god damn these people to hell, and by the way if I get a call from a Christian
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:40:00.480]  listener saying I did that in the vein, I didn't use the Lord's name in vein, the vein
[1:40:00.480 --> 1:40:05.680]  means you use God's name and don't appreciate it, respect it, I want God to damn these people
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:15.360]  to hell, I'm praying for justice, I'm praying for God to intervene, I mean how much worse
[1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:19.840]  does it have to get?
[1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:28.640]  From Kansas to Texas to New York to Illinois to Florida, they are in newspapers saying
[1:40:28.640 --> 1:40:36.960]  we don't want convicted pedophiles to have their backgrounds run to do pedophile story
[1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:44.120]  time with the kids, that's just pissing in our face man, because we become a nation of
[1:40:44.120 --> 1:40:52.420]  yes men that just, yes, yes, yes, I comply, I mean complying with your family helping
[1:40:52.420 --> 1:40:57.960]  to cook dinner or helping do chores is fun and good, complying with your own destruction
[1:40:57.960 --> 1:41:03.960]  is beyond cowardice, it's aiding and abetting Satanism, and so I got some news to all the
[1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:10.120]  cowards, not our audience, but cowards are too and this is funny, you are going to destroy
[1:41:10.120 --> 1:41:15.720]  yourselves and I promise you the way this works historically, metaphysically, you will
[1:41:15.720 --> 1:41:23.840]  be the first destroyed, in fact what's sick in all of this is that those of us fighting
[1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:30.880]  evil are going to become more powerful, stronger under this pressure, I don't have any enjoyment
[1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:37.520]  thinking about that, I'm going to have to watch in high death spiritual HD, all of this
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:53.720]  crap manifested, look, there is a fallen off world consciousness that
[1:41:53.720 --> 1:42:03.560]  likes to destroy humans, it's been beaten by us before in our more advanced level and
[1:42:03.560 --> 1:42:13.800]  it is here jacking us, and we got the transmission from the creator how to beat it, but the creator
[1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:22.400]  is like drops us off, gives us transmission, the creator is there already, but God is pure
[1:42:22.400 --> 1:42:28.120]  and says you have free will made in my image the potential of a holding universe in each
[1:42:28.120 --> 1:42:37.520]  one of you, the sea of the universe, and adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters, I am
[1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:42.120]  not going to let you sit here and be wimps, you are going to be tested by this creature,
[1:42:42.120 --> 1:42:47.480]  you can call that sadistic if you want, it's not, God wants you to make the right choice,
[1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:56.320]  you choose satan, so you are getting dumped in a black hole, we'll be right back.
[1:42:56.320 --> 1:43:03.240]  The ultimate tyranny would be a nanny state that would not allow anyone to ever do anything
[1:43:03.240 --> 1:43:08.360]  that could possibly hurt them, and that's the globalist plan, and now Mr. Fauci at the
[1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:13.600]  NIH last night in the press conference standing right next to the president said, we are going
[1:43:13.600 --> 1:43:19.480]  to have a global lockdown because he talked to world leaders until not one more person
[1:43:19.480 --> 1:43:26.640]  is dying or one more person is infected, the video is posted on infowars.com, ladies and
[1:43:26.640 --> 1:43:31.880]  gentlemen that sets the precedent where not one person can die from the flu, not one person
[1:43:31.880 --> 1:43:37.360]  can die from a cold, everyone will be surveilled in live time by their cell phones and apps
[1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:43.320]  and drones and an absolute straight jacket of pure medical tyranny, and remember it's
[1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:47.760]  a big pharma that has on the level 4 bioweapons labs that keeps leaking all these man made
[1:43:47.760 --> 1:43:55.680]  viruses, they are holding us all hostage, oh and he talked about forced inoculations.
[1:43:55.680 --> 1:43:59.560]  It's Wednesday morning, I was just in a local Austin business that was basically empty and
[1:43:59.560 --> 1:44:04.960]  there were three motorcycle police in there, and I said what do you think of this whole
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:11.320]  coronavirus thing, they're like it looks like it's a hoax, and I said yeah you're absolutely
[1:44:11.320 --> 1:44:17.040]  right the way it's been handled is a hoax, taking everybody that dies who happens to
[1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:22.760]  test positive, even if they die of a heart attack or cancer or diabetes as dying from
[1:44:22.760 --> 1:44:26.960]  coronavirus is the big one, and then of course they're also classifying everybody that tests
[1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:34.320]  positive for coronavirus period, not just COVID-19 as having it, so they're upping a
[1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:38.320]  number of cases, they're upping a number of deaths, but still more people died this week
[1:44:38.320 --> 1:44:43.520]  and last week than died from the coronavirus from suicide, so if anything it's causing
[1:44:43.520 --> 1:44:48.920]  divorces and suicide and stir craziness and basic insanity and a giant power grab with
[1:44:48.920 --> 1:44:53.040]  big pharma preparing a forced inoculation which they even admit will not protect you
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:44:56.240]  from next year's mutation of the coronavirus.
[1:44:56.240 --> 1:45:00.680]  I don't need to remind you how four years ago I told you the polls against Trump were
[1:45:00.680 --> 1:45:05.720]  weak, he was winning by a giant margin, but election fraud almost stole the election from
[1:45:05.720 --> 1:45:12.600]  Trump and the American people, well now they're pushing the idea that oh cancel the Republican
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:18.120]  and Democrat conventions, maybe cancel the election a year like the Olympics, that's
[1:45:18.120 --> 1:45:23.920]  because they know Trump in every internal scientific poll is 20 points ahead of the
[1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:28.480]  brain damage by, so they can say sir you look big like the Olympics, go ahead and back
[1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:33.240]  it off a year and then you'll still win in a year after you fix the crisis, no.
[1:45:33.240 --> 1:45:38.280]  They need more time to cook up an assassination and economic collapse and new virus, Trump
[1:45:38.280 --> 1:45:43.840]  needs to say no in America we keep elections on time, have the elections, win by a landslide
[1:45:43.840 --> 1:45:48.600]  and not give the globalists what they want, Hillary, Biden they all want to suspend the
[1:45:48.600 --> 1:45:53.720]  election, we shouldn't give them what they want, we need to have a vote in America and
[1:45:53.720 --> 1:45:57.760]  reelect Trump 2020.

[1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:27.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:27.160 --> 1:47:35.120]  The dragon gave its power to the beast, when the whore rode on the back of the beast, the
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:45.320]  nun could bind or sell, free or bond, bless you have the number, bless you have understanding,
[1:47:45.320 --> 1:47:57.520]  reckon the number of the beast, or it is the number of a man, its number is 666, they are
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:14.080]  now executing order number 66, 666, and to have it being openly announced, Providence
[1:48:14.080 --> 1:48:22.760]  will have it be broken a month ago, and now, they started announcing in the last five days
[1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:28.840]  publicly, of course we have a digital chip sewn into your body, of course you'll have
[1:48:28.840 --> 1:48:34.040]  to have all the shots we tell you, from the World Health Organization you can't travel,
[1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:39.760]  and even if governments try to block it, the you in is in command.
[1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:44.120]  And suddenly in grocery store lines and lawyers offices, people are quoting the World Health
[1:48:44.120 --> 1:48:52.000]  Organization to me like, I have been given the highest order above even God himself,
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:49:11.880]  unicase the dispatches, from God, oh my God, but you know, we've put up with it all, so
[1:49:11.880 --> 1:49:20.400]  what do we deserve, there it is, COVID-19 tracking bracelets and invisible tattoos to
[1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:25.040]  monitor America, how long ago was that, was that a month ago, I'm saying a month, scroll
[1:49:25.040 --> 1:49:32.720]  down for me a month please, that was actually March 17th, so less than a month ago, almost
[1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:42.880]  a month ago, David Knight, oh and the little Soros media said, oh insanity, oh that's
[1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:51.560]  preposterous, and then it's announced a week later, in Singapore, where they'll execute
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:57.680]  you for getting a fist fight, you drop a chewing gum wrapper on the ground, they give
[1:49:57.680 --> 1:50:07.600]  you 20 lashes with a cane pole, and they'll all just comply with this, you'll have to
[1:50:07.600 --> 1:50:13.200]  comply with taking vaccines that sterilize you, and then give you cancer, and Bill Gates
[1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:18.120]  brags about it, he says if you won't do it, we'll just release mosquitoes on your ass,
[1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:23.360]  about some Zika babies, so that's why I get so angry, ladies and gentlemen, is that our
[1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:30.280]  free economy, our human economy, our system is being destroyed in a scorched earth, new
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:34.680]  world order operation, I said I'd get to this, I'm behind, I'll get it next hour, I wasn't
[1:50:34.680 --> 1:50:46.040]  going to take calls again, we've got guests coming up, bottom of the hour, you know I've
[1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:49.600]  got a whole bunch of clips of them calling for, you can't leave your house or travel
[1:50:49.600 --> 1:50:53.040]  without a digital passport showing that you've taken the force to nodulations, and they've
[1:50:53.040 --> 1:50:57.600]  got a microchip that has all your personal data to make sure it's not forged, and we've
[1:50:57.600 --> 1:51:04.960]  got the clip, would you like to see them? It's here, as just who I told you, Bill,
[1:51:04.960 --> 1:51:11.640]  damn Gates, and what's frustrating is, you research it and it gets worse and worse and
[1:51:11.640 --> 1:51:19.600]  worse, the entire hierarchy of the CDC is on his payroll, the UN is on his payroll,
[1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:34.160]  and then you look at who paid him, Rockefeller, Carnegie, IBM, all eugenicists, he wants in
[1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:45.640]  your body, who's pushing 5G, dickhead, who's pushing weather modification, jerk off, in
[1:51:45.640 --> 1:51:51.960]  fact I shouldn't even joke around, those names are too kind for him, he is a manifest
[1:51:51.960 --> 1:52:02.320]  whole in the hell, Fauci, one grant he received, there's so many, I was researching it a few
[1:52:02.320 --> 1:52:07.760]  weeks ago, because I knew he was working for Gates, and I just kept finding the grants
[1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:12.840]  and I just kept finding new ones, it appears there's hundreds of them, I mean Fauci is
[1:52:12.840 --> 1:52:30.400]  an egg laid by Bill Gates, God help us, and I mean that one, oh my Lord help us please
[1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:38.520]  sweet Jesus, sweet Jesus, sweet, sweet Jesus, oh my God, because you're not going to have
[1:52:38.520 --> 1:52:43.480]  to wait 5-10 years now, it's all here, oh oh let me give you the next news flash, watching
[1:52:43.480 --> 1:52:47.640]  their activities and engaging them over the years, you call it a hunch, it's not a hunch,
[1:52:47.640 --> 1:52:51.680]  it's thousands of data points, literally, they're going to release other bio weapon
[1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:55.480]  every year now, it's just going to be every year they're going to get worse and worse
[1:52:55.480 --> 1:53:01.640]  and worse and worse and worse and worse, and within 10 years that we keep bowing, they're
[1:53:01.640 --> 1:53:09.520]  going to release stuff that starts killing hundreds of millions every season, I'd say
[1:53:09.520 --> 1:53:19.080]  by about 2035 they've got us down to about 500 million that Bill Gates, Ted Turner, and
[1:53:19.080 --> 1:53:25.400]  that other guy Jeffrey Epstein put out publicly 15 years ago, gosh what creepy weirdos, you
[1:53:25.400 --> 1:53:30.520]  know Bill Gates' house got caught with all that child porn, remember that, but it doesn't
[1:53:30.520 --> 1:53:37.520]  happen, 50,000 images of it or something, his personal assistant, oh oh, he said it
[1:53:37.520 --> 1:53:45.680]  was his on Bill Gates' home computer, so he didn't get in trouble, he was creating
[1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:58.720]  child porn out of the main house, see, they got Texas honey hams, the ones with big spiral
[1:53:58.720 --> 1:54:02.440]  slice hams, all caramelized or so delicious, I'm going to pick them up for Thanksgiving
[1:54:02.440 --> 1:54:05.880]  or whatever, I'm just salivating in the place where they're cutting them up over the counter
[1:54:05.880 --> 1:54:09.320]  and getting them ready and you actually get sandwiches there with cheese on them and lettuce
[1:54:09.320 --> 1:54:14.480]  and onion, so good, if I salivate when I see a big juicy ham dripping with cheese on luscious
[1:54:14.480 --> 1:54:20.480]  wheat bread with mustard on it, I see my wife in a bikini, I start salivating, when Bill
[1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:25.840]  Gates and these people see a little kid, they start salivating and stealing the energy
[1:54:25.840 --> 1:54:32.400]  by having sex with them is a hors d'oeuvre, torturing them to death is the main course,
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:38.280]  but it's liberal so it's okay, because Tim Cook's gay, so you know, do I even need to
[1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:46.160]  play these clips for you, I guess I do, here's Bill Gates babbling on Facebook, I mean my
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:50.440]  god on Instagram, he's on everything, he's just, he's doing hundreds of interviews of
[1:54:50.440 --> 1:54:55.880]  every few days, he's just, this is his time, and here he is saying he's got to have a digital
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:54:59.720]  passport to travel and then part of that is that, got it right here from his own press
[1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:07.160]  releases, a digital implanted chip, here it is, what we'll have to have is certificates
[1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:13.280]  of who's the recovered person, who's the vaccinated person, because you don't want people moving
[1:55:13.280 --> 1:55:18.320]  around the world where you'll have some countries that won't have it under control, sadly, you
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:25.480]  don't want to completely block off the ability for those people to go there and come back
[1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:30.800]  and move around, and that whole voice is fake, behind the scenes Bill Gates is like, I'm
[1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:42.680]  in command, he literally, he goes, kill humans, release me, literally, behind the scenes Bill
[1:55:42.680 --> 1:55:51.960]  Gates, I'll get you, I know people that know him, but, oh I'm Bill Gates, oh I'm the liberal,
[1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:58.560]  take my shot, it's not threatening, like Ursula Little Mermaid when she's swimming around,
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:06.560]  oh hello sweetie, but there's his real face, you see that, he does it in spaces, all of
[1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:14.520]  them, he'll just go like, he's as keen, I will kill them, he's a top general of Satan,
[1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:20.000]  and Satan's just bullwhip, I can kill them now, slaughter them, slaughter them, I will
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:41.640]  destroy them, liberal, I'm Bill Gates' voice, I'm empathic, he put horns on him all day,
[1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:47.560]  how about piles of dead babies, how about a burn up destroyed earth, that's what we
[1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:52.000]  gotta put next to Bill Gates, little pitchforks and horns don't do it justice, all right we're
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  gonna go to break, and I'll give you the attorney general talking about the draco, the draconian,
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:05.880]  Bill Gates who, with the corporations in the blue cities, is coming with the microchips
[1:57:05.880 --> 1:57:17.080]  and the UN says they're gonna take your kids from you, oh it's all happening now, oh let's
[1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:25.640]  get ready to rumble, the main event ladies and gentlemen, Satan and his armies of degenerates
[1:57:25.640 --> 1:57:33.920]  come against those sleeping beauties that don't know they're fighting for their lives, our
[1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:41.880]  number three is two minutes away, if you seek to defeat this force, spread the links, get
[1:57:41.880 --> 1:57:48.280]  the products, boost your immune system, one of our best selling products is living defense
[1:57:48.280 --> 1:57:52.520]  and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients
[1:57:52.520 --> 1:57:56.040]  that are organic, we've got a limited supply right now but it's selling out fast and I
[1:57:56.040 --> 1:57:59.760]  want those of you that have experience living defense to get it for yourself, here's just
[1:57:59.760 --> 1:58:05.120]  part of one testimonial, I looked in January 2016 I went in a hospital, I went to VA hospital
[1:58:05.120 --> 1:58:08.920]  out here in Boyce and I was in there until June and one of the only things that got me
[1:58:08.920 --> 1:58:13.600]  through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day and I kept hearing
[1:58:13.600 --> 1:58:17.760]  Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense, let me tell you something man, I
[1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:22.640]  had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the
[1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:26.680]  doctors they tried every time, nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when
[1:58:26.680 --> 1:58:30.320]  I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials I said you know what, I'mma get
[1:58:30.320 --> 1:58:33.760]  me some of that freaking living defense, now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals
[1:58:33.760 --> 1:58:37.280]  because they don't want you to have that stuff but I ordered it, it shipped to me, I got
[1:58:37.280 --> 1:58:42.160]  it, I hid it from the nurses, I started taking it man, that stuff changed my life, it saved
[1:58:42.160 --> 1:58:47.160]  my life, Alex Jones and info wars saved my life.
[1:58:47.160 --> 1:58:52.680]  We knew early on that COVID-19 was an engineered bio weapon but again, people say oh it must
[1:58:52.680 --> 1:58:57.560]  be the most deadly thing ever, no, it does currently kill people but if you're going
[1:58:57.560 --> 1:59:03.080]  to release a bio weapon for fear of the bankrupting economy and cost panic and to run folks off
[1:59:03.080 --> 1:59:07.520]  the edge of a cliff in a giant artificial stampede, you want to know the real trajectory,
[1:59:07.520 --> 1:59:11.680]  kill a bunch of old people, kill people that are deficient, kill people that are already
[1:59:11.680 --> 1:59:16.200]  sick, get rid of folks the globe who don't even want anyways but scare everybody else
[1:59:16.200 --> 1:59:21.800]  so you want to control into submission and that's what's going on so people get confused
[1:59:21.800 --> 1:59:25.800]  by the paradox of, you say it's a real virus, you say it's serious but you say don't panic
[1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:30.320]  and don't shut the economy down, exactly because if you do that they're going to keep releasing
[1:59:30.320 --> 1:59:35.480]  bio weapons over and over again because it works so well on the public.
[1:59:35.480 --> 1:59:39.720]  Most people are starting to wake up but we have to understand that pressures being put
[1:59:39.720 --> 1:59:43.920]  on Trump to basically keep the economy shut for another six months to a year will be a
[1:59:43.920 --> 1:59:49.800]  depression long before then, we've got to go back to work.
[1:59:49.800 --> 2:00:00.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:00.800 --> 2:00:06.800]  Alright, I'm going to air excerpts of the Attorney General's amazing interview with
[2:00:06.800 --> 2:00:07.800]  Laura Hingram.
[2:00:07.800 --> 2:00:13.480]  Thank God, somebody is upset about the open world government, Mark of the Bees and reliable
[2:00:13.480 --> 2:00:18.480]  microchip and planning going on and I am going to get serious, I've been serious, I'm inventing
[2:00:18.480 --> 2:00:24.440]  here because my energy level is just off the charts right now because when the enemy comes
[2:00:24.440 --> 2:00:28.560]  in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord will stand against it and we are all that standard
[2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:34.760]  and I'm just like white hot right now man, I mean I'm just like ready for war, I've never
[2:00:34.760 --> 2:00:39.400]  felt like this, I'll just leave it at that because we're in it man, I mean this is spiritual
[2:00:39.400 --> 2:00:43.720]  total takeover, Mark of the Bees all being announced, it's just unbelievable and you
[2:00:43.720 --> 2:00:47.880]  know I've been freaking out on air because this is a normal response, I'm going to just
[2:00:47.880 --> 2:00:50.880]  sit up here and calmly like everybody else has just covered this and he's just like oh
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:00:52.880]  yeah, you know, no!
[2:00:52.880 --> 2:00:58.160]  Here's part of the report, the full reports of the John Bound section of Bandai video,
[2:00:58.160 --> 2:01:02.720]  it's China controls the World Health Organization and I'm going to come back because I do need
[2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:07.480]  to create a good clean record of this and we'll get to just how bad the situation is
[2:01:07.480 --> 2:01:09.760]  and how we fight it when we come back.
[2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:14.840]  Our own anti-American media has been praising China for its efforts toward the coronavirus
[2:01:14.840 --> 2:01:16.920]  debacle but that's nothing new.
[2:01:16.920 --> 2:01:23.560]  Adolf Hitler was Times Man of the Year in 1938 as was Joseph Stalin in 1939.
[2:01:23.560 --> 2:01:28.520]  The Chinese government's dominance of propaganda is as slick as it is nearly invisible.
[2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:34.320]  This old iconic landmark is getting a new facelift, a bit of cosmetic surgery.
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:40.880]  It's about to get a new name, all new upgrades and technologies and an all new lease on life
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:46.400]  as we partner with one of China's most formidable consumer product companies, DCL.
[2:01:46.400 --> 2:01:52.560]  China is fast overtaking the U.S. as the biggest movie marketplace on Earth and Wanda's acquisition
[2:01:52.560 --> 2:01:57.320]  is the biggest move yet by a Chinese company into the U.S. entertainment industry.
[2:01:57.320 --> 2:02:02.240]  Now the United States is by far the world's top funder of the World Health Organization.
[2:02:02.240 --> 2:02:06.480]  We give the organization about 58 million dollars every year, that's double what any
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:09.360]  other country donates for some reason.
[2:02:09.360 --> 2:02:13.320]  But for the organization's leaders, there's only one country that matters and it's not
[2:02:13.320 --> 2:02:14.720]  us, it's China.
[2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:19.600]  And as the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative plows a path for the globalist fever dream
[2:02:19.600 --> 2:02:24.720]  of a Chinese century, the pawns of the powerful have looked to the World Health Organization
[2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:30.120]  for professional unwavering guidance throughout the coronavirus hysteria.
[2:02:30.120 --> 2:02:35.480]  Many completely unaware of how locked in with China these organizations are.
[2:02:35.480 --> 2:02:39.080]  Will the WHO consider Taiwan's membership?
[2:02:39.080 --> 2:02:40.080]  Hello?
[2:02:40.080 --> 2:02:43.080]  I couldn't hear your question.
[2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:45.520]  OK, let me repeat the question.
[2:02:45.520 --> 2:02:47.960]  No, let's move to another one then.
[2:02:47.960 --> 2:02:48.960]  Right.
[2:02:48.960 --> 2:02:52.200]  Honestly, they've got out of their way to say, oh, nothing to see here, and then praise
[2:02:52.200 --> 2:02:55.280]  China and they're pretending the connection doesn't work.
[2:02:55.280 --> 2:03:00.960]  Number one, we know that the WHO is a completely useless and corrupt body that has been completely
[2:03:00.960 --> 2:03:04.360]  taken over by Chinese Communist Party propagandists.
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:09.720]  As the Federalist reported, China worked tirelessly behind the scenes lobbying to ensure the election
[2:03:09.720 --> 2:03:12.320]  of World Health Organization Director General.
[2:03:12.320 --> 2:03:17.040]  Tedros Gabrasis, who previously served in the government of the Marxist and violently
[2:03:17.040 --> 2:03:21.160]  repressive Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front.
[2:03:21.160 --> 2:03:27.240]  This gruesome movement was responsible for gross human rights abuses such as torture,
[2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:29.520]  repression, and electoral fraud.
[2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:35.040]  During his tenure as Health Minister, Tedros was most known to have covered up three cholera
[2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:36.040]  outbreaks.
[2:03:36.040 --> 2:03:41.560]  As the Health Minister, he decided to call it Mayor Acute Watery Diarrhea, and people
[2:03:41.560 --> 2:03:42.560]  were like, diarrhea.
[2:03:42.560 --> 2:03:47.920]  How can it be diarrhea when about 60,000 people were affected in 2006?
[2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:53.960]  And not only that, he instructed his staff to avoid using the word cholera in their reports.
[2:03:53.960 --> 2:03:57.080]  So why did China push so hard for Tedros?
[2:03:57.080 --> 2:04:03.000]  Tedros' tenure is merely a part of a broader Chinese Communist Party strategy to take over
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:09.200]  international organizations to reshape the international system to accommodate its political
[2:04:09.200 --> 2:04:13.120]  and economic interests in service of this strategy.
[2:04:13.120 --> 2:04:18.360]  China has consistently sought to trade financial incentives for votes, offering bribes and
[2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:21.280]  cancelling debt for countries that support them.
[2:04:21.280 --> 2:04:27.120]  All of this noted by Assistant to U.S. President Peter Navarro that the CCP has a broad strategy
[2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:31.880]  to gain control over 15 specialized agencies of the U.N.
[2:04:31.880 --> 2:04:37.400]  China already leads four of the U.N. specialized agencies, while no other country leads more
[2:04:37.400 --> 2:04:38.400]  than one.
[2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:43.440]  Their latest victims include a whistleblower, Wuhan Dr. Ai Fen, who is believed to have
[2:04:43.440 --> 2:04:48.960]  been detained after giving media interviews about her initial concerns over the coronavirus.
[2:04:48.960 --> 2:04:53.720]  Also a Chinese doctor who claimed he quietly warned of the coronavirus outbreak, Li Wenling
[2:04:53.720 --> 2:04:55.200]  had shared his concern.
[2:04:55.200 --> 2:04:59.560]  What's amazing about the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights is that even though
[2:04:59.560 --> 2:05:06.840]  it's 240 years old, it's more pertinent and more powerful today than it's ever been.
[2:05:06.840 --> 2:05:12.280]  We look at the huge AI takeover and total surveillance of our lives and the tyranny
[2:05:12.280 --> 2:05:18.360]  that comes with it, the oppression, and it's all linked to not having due process and not
[2:05:18.360 --> 2:05:22.560]  having a Fourth Amendment against being illegally surveilled.
[2:05:22.560 --> 2:05:28.240]  It's all predicated on having no privacy.
[2:05:28.240 --> 2:05:31.720]  If we simply embrace the Bill of Rights and Constitution and enforce that against Big
[2:05:31.720 --> 2:05:34.560]  Tech, they would never get away with this.
[2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:39.960]  Because we're not enforcing our Bill of Rights and Constitution based in common sense, the
[2:05:39.960 --> 2:05:46.320]  bottom is falling out and the sky is just the beginning, it's certainly not the limit.
[2:05:46.320 --> 2:05:50.360]  That's why we're rediscovering what made America great and what the Renaissance is all about.
[2:05:50.360 --> 2:06:07.200]  Through human empowerment, it begins at infowars.com.
[2:06:07.200 --> 2:06:12.920]  But a digital certificate to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when
[2:06:12.920 --> 2:06:17.400]  we have a vaccine of people who've received it.
[2:06:17.400 --> 2:06:20.680]  This is an answer and a Reddit asked me anything, they had a little forum.
[2:06:20.680 --> 2:06:25.920]  There'd be a little concern about that and the tracking of people and so forth, generally
[2:06:25.920 --> 2:06:30.440]  especially going forward over a long period of time.
[2:06:30.440 --> 2:06:31.440]  They're inalienable rights.
[2:06:31.440 --> 2:06:36.240]  It means, I mean there are a lot of Americans today who are mourning those who've lost
[2:06:36.240 --> 2:06:42.280]  their lives in this horrible virus who also say the government doesn't have this right
[2:06:42.280 --> 2:06:45.440]  to take, this right to take our rights away.
[2:06:45.440 --> 2:06:51.080]  Even when the experts are saying this is a horrible time for us, health-wise, and they're
[2:06:51.080 --> 2:06:55.040]  very worried, increasingly worried, I think as time goes on, but they've been very patient
[2:06:55.040 --> 2:06:56.040]  as well.
[2:06:56.040 --> 2:07:00.040]  Yeah, I think they have been patient and I think we have to be very careful to make
[2:07:00.040 --> 2:07:05.800]  sure that the draconian measures that are being adopted are fully justified and they're
[2:07:05.800 --> 2:07:09.120]  not alternative ways of protecting people.
[2:07:09.120 --> 2:07:15.760]  And I think when this period of time is at the end of April expires, I think we have
[2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:20.120]  to allow people to adapt more than we have.
[2:07:20.120 --> 2:07:26.560]  Saying the rule of law still applies during a pandemic, but the rule of law, I mean our
[2:07:26.560 --> 2:07:34.800]  inalienable rights, the law of the land, I mean it all still exists and we don't want
[2:07:34.800 --> 2:07:40.680]  to set a precedent where every time the experts declare a crisis, and it's scary, and a lot
[2:07:40.680 --> 2:07:45.840]  of people are going to die, that we just lose our ability to function as a government and
[2:07:45.840 --> 2:07:46.840]  the executive branch.
[2:07:46.840 --> 2:07:52.320]  I mean I know you're the executive branch now, but we don't have that whole-of-government
[2:07:52.320 --> 2:07:55.440]  real approach to safeguard the liberties of the American people.
[2:07:55.440 --> 2:08:00.040]  Well, one of the things that I think the president has done very well here is to use the strength
[2:08:00.040 --> 2:08:05.160]  of a federal system where certain decisions should be made in Washington perhaps, but
[2:08:05.160 --> 2:08:12.600]  also allowing each state to adapt to the situation that confronts it and make their own choices.
[2:08:12.600 --> 2:08:14.680]  And that's a form of protecting liberty.
[2:08:14.680 --> 2:08:20.520]  The federal system is a form of protecting liberty, to have the government closest to
[2:08:20.520 --> 2:08:22.880]  the people make those decisions.
[2:08:22.880 --> 2:08:24.960]  So I think we do have that protection.
[2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:30.880]  You're right in the general sense that there is a power for the government to take extraordinary
[2:08:30.880 --> 2:08:33.480]  steps in genuine emergencies.
[2:08:33.480 --> 2:08:37.520]  That obviously creates a slippery slope, what do you call an emergency?
[2:08:37.520 --> 2:08:43.720]  And I am concerned that we not get into the business of declaring everything an emergency
[2:08:43.720 --> 2:08:47.800]  and then using these kinds of sweeping extraordinary steps.
[2:08:47.800 --> 2:08:50.920]  Oh, this isn't the slippery slope.
[2:08:50.920 --> 2:08:57.160]  You've fallen off a slippery slope and into a vat of tyranny.
[2:08:57.160 --> 2:09:03.000]  The good news is, if you go to Bill Gates' Instagram or his Facebook or his Twitter,
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  no one, and I've spent, during the breaks, a lot of time reading hundreds of these, no
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:12.960]  one likes it, they say, you're a eugenicist, your dad ran a Planned Parenthood, you say
[2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:16.280]  you want to kill the old people, now you care, you're behind the vaccine, you're behind it
[2:09:16.280 --> 2:09:20.120]  all, you piece of garbage, we're going to get you.
[2:09:20.120 --> 2:09:27.560]  This upper rope, you chicken-neck Nazi, and again, what would a Nazi do?
[2:09:27.560 --> 2:09:32.120]  He'd stir up everybody racially to hate each other, he'd have the leftist media persecute
[2:09:32.120 --> 2:09:41.800]  whites for no reason, so we would say, okay, we're against the brown people.
[2:09:41.800 --> 2:09:46.920]  Now, that doesn't mean you're like a leftist and then do whatever the globalists say because
[2:09:46.920 --> 2:09:50.760]  they represent the brown people and just open the borders up and let everybody have free
[2:09:50.760 --> 2:09:55.000]  stuff in the bankrupt, no, but you understand the manipulation.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:59.760]  And it came out in the WikiLeaks, Hillary talking to the head psychiatrist of a university,
[2:09:59.760 --> 2:10:04.560]  and they say, we're losing control, all we can do now is culture war.
[2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:08.200]  And Hillary's assistant goes, well, she wants to talk to you today about how we expand that
[2:10:08.200 --> 2:10:09.760]  culture war.
[2:10:09.760 --> 2:10:13.560]  Culture war is the code word for race war.
[2:10:13.560 --> 2:10:18.040]  We have the Soros documents on how they tried to cause a race war with Obama and the Trayvon
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:27.040]  Martin stuff, and they picked cases where cops killed people, pulling guns on them so
[2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:34.200]  that it would look to white people like it was black people being unreasonable when there
[2:10:34.200 --> 2:10:36.440]  are obviously cases of black folks being screwed over.
[2:10:36.440 --> 2:10:40.840]  This is all psych warfare, folks, and it's not like you can look at it and see what they're
[2:10:40.840 --> 2:10:41.840]  doing.
[2:10:41.840 --> 2:10:47.560]  They're getting the documents because good people on the inside leak them.
[2:10:47.560 --> 2:10:53.000]  One Antifa professor went to jail when one gives for family violence, beat his wife up,
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:56.880]  and the brother went into his place, got his stuff, they were throwing his stuff out, and
[2:10:56.880 --> 2:11:02.360]  it's just like command orders from Alexander Soros and the police departments were working
[2:11:02.360 --> 2:11:07.600]  with them in blue cities, and they didn't even have police beat up a black dude so they
[2:11:07.600 --> 2:11:08.600]  could film it.
[2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:11.080]  And then, I mean, it's just, I can't handle it anymore.
[2:11:11.080 --> 2:11:16.320]  The level, because, you know, Jesse Smollett just claims white dudes are attacking him in
[2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:18.600]  the middle of the night and makes up all this stuff.
[2:11:18.600 --> 2:11:29.840]  The Soros people do it for real, folks.
[2:11:29.840 --> 2:11:35.680]  You know, I want to go through all these clips, but we've reached twilight zone level here,
[2:11:35.680 --> 2:11:36.680]  haven't we?
[2:11:36.680 --> 2:11:43.400]  We're in the year 2020, they're freaking out about Bill Gates wanting you to have a digital
[2:11:43.400 --> 2:11:51.800]  ID to travel, but that's not, that's not what he's saying.
[2:11:51.800 --> 2:11:53.000]  It's a hundred times worse.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:12:00.400]  Let me show you the articles from Bill Gates statements.
[2:12:00.400 --> 2:12:02.280]  Now, there's Fox News.
[2:12:02.280 --> 2:12:06.800]  Eventually, we'll have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or tested recently
[2:12:06.800 --> 2:12:08.680]  or when we have a vaccine who's received it.
[2:12:08.680 --> 2:12:10.360]  What is England?
[2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:12.400]  What has Italy?
[2:12:12.400 --> 2:12:13.840]  What is Australia?
[2:12:13.840 --> 2:12:14.960]  What has China?
[2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:16.160]  And what has Texas?
[2:12:16.160 --> 2:12:17.680]  The governor got sucked into it.
[2:12:17.680 --> 2:12:23.000]  I think the governor's a good guy from what I know, but him going, oh yeah, you'll have
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:25.080]  to have antibodies before you go back to work.
[2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:29.320]  That means a vaccine or that you've had it, and again, it's a weaponized common cold.
[2:12:29.320 --> 2:12:36.560]  It does kill a lot of people, but I'm going to play your next segment, the former head
[2:12:36.560 --> 2:12:37.560]  Rockefeller scientist.
[2:12:37.560 --> 2:12:39.560]  I mean, this, I looked him up.
[2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:41.360]  I mean, this guy's, I've read his name before.
[2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:46.000]  This guy's like, in the top 10 virologists in the world, they just hands down, he's
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  King Daddy.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  Okay.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:53.520]  And he says, actually locking everybody up like this creates mutations and things that
[2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:55.560]  are more deadly.
[2:12:55.560 --> 2:13:01.520]  And you want to get a bad virus out as much as possible because it always mutates off.
[2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:05.160]  But that's what my dad was always telling me, but you know, it's my dad, he's a chemist,
[2:13:05.160 --> 2:13:08.520]  he's a doctor, it's like that, but okay, dad, yeah, I know you've read the literature,
[2:13:08.520 --> 2:13:11.040]  but it's really true folks.
[2:13:11.040 --> 2:13:12.240]  And so we're going to get into that as well.
[2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:13.800]  This is the worst scenario.
[2:13:13.800 --> 2:13:17.080]  Them locking everybody down like this, now that we get more science on it, is going to
[2:13:17.080 --> 2:13:21.880]  make this thing continue on next year, which they're now saying, this is the new normal.
[2:13:21.880 --> 2:13:25.400]  Cuomo's in AP saying, it's never ending.
[2:13:25.400 --> 2:13:30.760]  He says, this is, it's never sending, of course, they got all this power, politicians, corrupt
[2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:36.240]  governments, corrupt corporations, of course, they are having a orgasm.
[2:13:36.240 --> 2:13:39.840]  You've got that club.
[2:13:39.840 --> 2:13:45.600]  But here it is, Bill Gates calls for digital certificate to identify who received COVID-19.
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:48.800]  And there's all these videos and all these statements, it's exactly what we broke a month
[2:13:48.800 --> 2:13:53.080]  ago, or three and a half weeks ago at David Knight.
[2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:58.320]  Bill Gates, MIT developed new tech ID tattoo for checking for vaccines.
[2:13:58.320 --> 2:14:00.120]  And really, that's just a cover story.
[2:14:00.120 --> 2:14:01.800]  It's a thing to track everything you do.
[2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:05.760]  Here's the company, MIT, an invisible quantum dot tattoo.
[2:14:05.760 --> 2:14:08.000]  Oh, they don't call it a chip remark.
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:09.280]  It's a quantum dot.
[2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:10.840]  Well, then it's got to be good.
[2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:17.080]  I mean, if it's a quantum dot, instead of calling it 357 Magnum, you walk up with your
[2:14:17.080 --> 2:14:18.080]  357 Magnum.
[2:14:18.080 --> 2:14:19.560]  This is not 357 Magnum.
[2:14:19.560 --> 2:14:25.760]  This is a quantum launch carrier system.
[2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:31.400]  And I'm going to put into you a transformative beacon.
[2:14:31.400 --> 2:14:34.480]  And they shoot you now, 37 Magnum, blow your brains out.
[2:14:34.480 --> 2:14:40.320]  But it's okay because it's a quantum level beacon.
[2:14:40.320 --> 2:14:41.320]  Or hatch it.
[2:14:41.320 --> 2:14:42.320]  Oh, here, just a knife.
[2:14:42.320 --> 2:14:43.320]  Where's my knife going?
[2:14:43.320 --> 2:14:45.320]  You know, you're just walking with this in the knife.
[2:14:45.320 --> 2:14:47.320]  It's a love stick.
[2:14:47.320 --> 2:14:50.160]  Ah, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal.
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:53.960]  See how that works?
[2:14:53.960 --> 2:14:57.080]  And you read this and it's like, oh, here it is.
[2:14:57.080 --> 2:15:00.920]  For people overseeing nationwide vaccination and if it's developing countries, it's always
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:04.360]  developing countries, keeping track of who and which vaccination and when has been the
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:05.360]  tough task.
[2:15:05.360 --> 2:15:09.720]  That's why they started last year, remember, in Austin and Florida, microchipping homeless.
[2:15:09.720 --> 2:15:10.720]  They're beta testing.
[2:15:10.720 --> 2:15:11.720]  We was doing it at the UN.
[2:15:11.720 --> 2:15:17.040]  But researchers from MIT might have a solution that would act like, oh, they might have it.
[2:15:17.040 --> 2:15:18.040]  You don't just get it.
[2:15:18.040 --> 2:15:19.640]  You have to beg for it.
[2:15:19.640 --> 2:15:23.960]  They created an ink that can safely embed the skin alongside a vaccine itself.
[2:15:23.960 --> 2:15:29.920]  And it's only visible using special smartphone camera app and filter.
[2:15:29.920 --> 2:15:34.280]  In other words, they found a covert way to embed the record of a vaccination directly
[2:15:34.280 --> 2:15:37.240]  in the patient's skin rather than document it electronically on paper.
[2:15:37.240 --> 2:15:39.400]  And the low risk tracking system, what's low risk?
[2:15:39.400 --> 2:15:41.560]  Oh, wow, great, it's good.
[2:15:41.560 --> 2:15:45.160]  Could greatly simplify the process of maintaining accurate vaccine records.
[2:15:45.160 --> 2:15:47.600]  And it goes on letting you have your digital passport.
[2:15:47.600 --> 2:15:51.640]  So your medical, Margaret the Beast is ready and Bill Gates, who says he wants to kill
[2:15:51.640 --> 2:15:53.760]  everybody, runs it.
[2:15:53.760 --> 2:15:57.200]  Attention all radio listeners who still need food supplies.
[2:15:57.200 --> 2:16:01.140]  If you've thought about the implication of food related supply chain disruptions and
[2:16:01.140 --> 2:16:05.280]  are concerned about the coming quarantines, this will be the most important message you
[2:16:05.280 --> 2:16:06.640]  will ever hear.
[2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:07.640]  Here's why.
[2:16:07.640 --> 2:16:11.560]  In the next few days, all Americans will face extremely hard choices.
[2:16:11.560 --> 2:16:16.240]  If we've learned anything from China and Italy, it's that quarantines and enforced
[2:16:16.240 --> 2:16:21.400]  lockdowns are just a few days away here in the U.S. Listen, while dehydrated food is
[2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:26.240]  becoming scarce, you can still get enough open pollinated heirloom seeds to grow a one
[2:16:26.240 --> 2:16:27.860]  acre crisis garden.
[2:16:27.860 --> 2:16:32.740]  The truth is, growing nutrient dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually be the single
[2:16:32.740 --> 2:16:34.640]  most important thing you do.
[2:16:34.640 --> 2:16:40.120]  Go to survivalseedbank.com and watch the new video to understand the nature of the threat.
[2:16:40.120 --> 2:16:42.120]  This could be life saving.
[2:16:42.120 --> 2:16:44.680]  Lockdowns can last from six to eight weeks.

[2:17:54.720 --> 2:17:57.400]  It's incontrovertible.
[2:17:57.400 --> 2:17:59.560]  Humanity is dying.
[2:17:59.560 --> 2:18:08.320]  Every metric, every gauge we have shows that we're living shorter lives, we are diseased,
[2:18:08.320 --> 2:18:11.960]  our IQs are plunging, and we're ugly.
[2:18:11.960 --> 2:18:13.760]  We're falling apart.
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:18.480]  Big pharma and the entire lovelast operation is a kill grid.
[2:18:18.480 --> 2:18:19.480]  And the studies are clear.
[2:18:19.480 --> 2:18:26.480]  The average person is in a dream-like state, a near dream-like daydream world, program
[2:18:26.480 --> 2:18:29.840]  of the flicker rates of the televisions and all the screens.
[2:18:29.840 --> 2:18:37.080]  We are in a trance, and now they're turning up the power of the ambient electromagnetic
[2:18:37.080 --> 2:18:44.000]  radiation, which again, all the studies conclusively show, cause massive cancer and destroy your
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:48.120]  immune system and push viruses across the cell membrane.
[2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:49.120]  We are being murdered.
[2:18:49.120 --> 2:18:54.880]  And I've got to tell you, it's very sophisticated and looks not human.
[2:18:54.880 --> 2:19:02.560]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins, there are many reasons why we need to think
[2:19:02.560 --> 2:19:05.160]  about what is really in the air around us.
[2:19:05.160 --> 2:19:09.600]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[2:19:09.600 --> 2:19:15.040]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against
[2:19:15.040 --> 2:19:17.960]  the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[2:19:17.960 --> 2:19:23.480]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the breeze uses a four-step purification process to help
[2:19:23.480 --> 2:19:25.920]  you breathe easier and cleaner.
[2:19:25.920 --> 2:19:30.400]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars, but the Alexa Pure Breeze

[2:19:50.360 --> 2:19:57.360]  Check this special today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:19:57.360 --> 2:20:08.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:20:08.360 --> 2:20:16.360]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:16.360 --> 2:20:27.200]  I'm about to show you incredible information that could save hundreds of millions of people
[2:20:27.200 --> 2:20:32.040]  in the next few years, literally, but you're not going to see the mainstream media drama
[2:20:32.040 --> 2:20:35.800]  queen about all of this.
[2:20:35.800 --> 2:20:47.100]  I have all the articles right here where even the UN admits that this lockdown has put half
[2:20:47.100 --> 2:20:54.960]  a billion people on the edge of starvation with 100 plus million people that have died
[2:20:54.960 --> 2:20:59.080]  just in the last 20 years from starvation.
[2:20:59.080 --> 2:21:02.400]  So I'm going to say that again, you're not going to have CNN cameras, you're not going
[2:21:02.400 --> 2:21:03.400]  to have a big hype.
[2:21:03.400 --> 2:21:07.680]  You'll have some UNICEF saying, give the UN money, we'll feed Africans when they're the
[2:21:07.680 --> 2:21:14.360]  ones cut the food off, or people in the Middle East in other areas, but it's the Africans
[2:21:14.360 --> 2:21:17.560]  that are getting the main brunt of this.
[2:21:17.560 --> 2:21:20.240]  And if you've been taught there's too many people and you're like, great, you go over
[2:21:20.240 --> 2:21:23.520]  there and you personally shoot those little black kids in the head yourself.
[2:21:23.520 --> 2:21:27.800]  I'm sick of all these chicken-necked leftists presiding over this and you know damn well
[2:21:27.800 --> 2:21:29.120]  what you're doing.
[2:21:29.120 --> 2:21:32.200]  You think the globalists are going to kill all these black people and they're not going
[2:21:32.200 --> 2:21:36.840]  to kill your dumbass?
[2:21:36.840 --> 2:21:41.240]  They're just going to shoot you up with a vaccine gives you cancer, you dumb idiot.
[2:21:41.240 --> 2:21:47.260]  And I'm talking to people that go along with the system.
[2:21:47.260 --> 2:21:51.520]  And by the way, that's why the World Health Organization is full of a bunch of black Africans
[2:21:51.520 --> 2:21:55.040]  that lead their people right on the slaughter like the head of the World Health Organization.
[2:21:55.040 --> 2:21:56.280]  What a communist monster.
[2:21:56.280 --> 2:22:00.360]  What a bootlicking scumbag of the chai-coms.
[2:22:00.360 --> 2:22:04.080]  These are all Hitler's, man, modern day right in front of you.
[2:22:04.080 --> 2:22:07.200]  But if Hitler was black, you see all of the black people are perfect.
[2:22:07.200 --> 2:22:11.600]  I mean, there's no way this black man's hurting black people.
[2:22:11.600 --> 2:22:14.960]  He talks all day about fighting racism.
[2:22:14.960 --> 2:22:18.320]  One loving starvation at a time.
[2:22:18.320 --> 2:22:22.200]  So here's a little compilation of Trump the last month talking about you cut the economy
[2:22:22.200 --> 2:22:27.600]  off of a cause mass death and I'm going to show you what's currently happening.
[2:22:27.600 --> 2:22:30.400]  We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.
[2:22:30.400 --> 2:22:34.120]  We're not going to let the cure be worse than the problem.
[2:22:34.120 --> 2:22:39.920]  At the end of the 15 day period, we'll make a decision as to which way we want to go,
[2:22:39.920 --> 2:22:42.120]  where we want to go, the timing.
[2:22:42.120 --> 2:22:47.000]  And essentially we're referring to the timing of the opening, essentially the opening of
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:48.000]  our country.
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:53.440]  Our country is not supposed to be, you know, it's not built to shut down.
[2:22:53.440 --> 2:22:56.480]  Our people are full of them and vigor and energy.
[2:22:56.480 --> 2:23:00.880]  They don't want to be locked into a house or an apartment or some space.
[2:23:00.880 --> 2:23:02.800]  It's not for our country.
[2:23:02.800 --> 2:23:05.120]  We're not built that way.
[2:23:05.120 --> 2:23:09.000]  And I said, you know, I don't want the cure to be worse than the problem itself, the problem
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:11.560]  being obviously the problem.
[2:23:11.560 --> 2:23:16.720]  And you know, you can destroy a country this way by closing it down where it literally
[2:23:16.720 --> 2:23:19.240]  goes from being the most prosperous.
[2:23:19.240 --> 2:23:23.600]  I mean, we had the best economy in the history of our country three weeks ago.
[2:23:23.600 --> 2:23:26.040]  And then all of a sudden we're supposed to shut it down.
[2:23:26.040 --> 2:23:28.040]  And they were supposed to pay people not to go to work.
[2:23:28.040 --> 2:23:29.040]  We never had that.
[2:23:29.040 --> 2:23:30.240]  We used to pay people to go to work.
[2:23:30.240 --> 2:23:32.040]  You have tremendous responsibility.
[2:23:32.040 --> 2:23:33.720]  We have jobs.
[2:23:33.720 --> 2:23:40.840]  We have people get tremendous anxiety and depression and you have suicides over things
[2:23:40.840 --> 2:23:41.840]  like this.
[2:23:41.840 --> 2:23:47.240]  When you have terrible economies, you have death probably and I mean definitely would
[2:23:47.240 --> 2:23:51.520]  be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we're talking about with regard to the
[2:23:51.520 --> 2:23:52.520]  virus.
[2:23:52.520 --> 2:23:55.280]  So we have an obligation, we have a double obligation.
[2:23:55.280 --> 2:23:57.520]  This was a medical problem.
[2:23:57.520 --> 2:24:01.880]  We are not going to let it turn into a long lasting financial problem.
[2:24:01.880 --> 2:24:07.680]  Started out as a purely medical problem and it's not going to go beyond that.
[2:24:07.680 --> 2:24:10.200]  We're just not going to allow that to happen.
[2:24:10.200 --> 2:24:11.400]  This could be a much bigger problem.
[2:24:11.400 --> 2:24:15.880]  This could create a much bigger problem than the problem that you start off with.
[2:24:15.880 --> 2:24:18.880]  Now other nations are going to have to do what they're going to do, but they'll probably
[2:24:18.880 --> 2:24:21.040]  do something very similar.
[2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:26.160]  But in our case, much more so than anyone else because of the magnitude of our economy,
[2:24:26.160 --> 2:24:30.680]  the tremendous size of what we've built and what we have and the jobs involved.
[2:24:30.680 --> 2:24:36.440]  You have 160, almost 160 million jobs in this country now, the most ever by far, by far the
[2:24:36.440 --> 2:24:40.960]  most ever, the number of jobs, almost 160 million.
[2:24:40.960 --> 2:24:44.560]  So we can't turn that off and think it's going to be wonderful.
[2:24:44.560 --> 2:24:46.080]  There'll be tremendous repercussions.
[2:24:46.080 --> 2:24:49.320]  There will be a tremendous death from that.
[2:24:49.320 --> 2:24:50.320]  Death.
[2:24:50.320 --> 2:24:55.560]  We're talking about death, probably more death from that than anything that we're talking
[2:24:55.560 --> 2:24:59.360]  about with respect to the virus.
[2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:04.680]  So there's Trump in the last month predicting everything and here is now today, Associated
[2:25:04.680 --> 2:25:05.680]  Press.
[2:25:05.680 --> 2:25:11.400]  Half a billion more people face poverty due to virus and of this lowest 10 percent of
[2:25:11.400 --> 2:25:17.760]  people on the planet, almost a billion people, 800 plus million, most of them live at a subsistence
[2:25:17.760 --> 2:25:22.360]  level spending the vast majority of their money on food, many of them make less than
[2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:27.560]  a dollar a day and it goes on to say that there'll probably be several million extra
[2:25:27.560 --> 2:25:29.440]  people starved to death.
[2:25:29.440 --> 2:25:30.440]  But that's okay.
[2:25:30.440 --> 2:25:32.200]  Here, let's look who's going to be starving to death here.
[2:25:32.200 --> 2:25:33.280]  It's okay.
[2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:38.200]  We can't have a 90-year-old person test positive for COVID-19 and die as a cancer because they
[2:25:38.200 --> 2:25:41.120]  admit they put every death in there.
[2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:47.640]  She's got to die because millions, they say about 2 million will probably die.
[2:25:47.640 --> 2:25:52.520]  You're looking up at the articles right here, but what's 2 million children?
[2:25:52.520 --> 2:25:53.520]  I mean, come on.
[2:25:53.520 --> 2:25:59.240]  It's fun to wear the mask and get scared and you know, social distance and, oh, everything.
[2:25:59.240 --> 2:26:00.240]  I understand.
[2:26:00.240 --> 2:26:01.240]  Good.
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:05.760]  Hey, just be, at least send troops to shoot her in the head then.
[2:26:05.760 --> 2:26:07.640]  I mean, I'll make her starve to death at Vulture's Theater.
[2:26:07.640 --> 2:26:10.640]  I mean, you know, Jones Cole for Killing Black Babies.
[2:26:10.640 --> 2:26:11.640]  No, that's the left.
[2:26:11.640 --> 2:26:14.480]  I'm being sarcastic.
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:17.360]  How the CDC and the FDA wrecked the economy.
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:19.160]  Big article right there from Reason.
[2:26:19.160 --> 2:26:22.520]  Yeah, I mean, you mean Bill Gates and the globalists that run China.
[2:26:22.520 --> 2:26:23.520]  They did.
[2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:25.120]  This is the economic war.
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:30.240]  Bill Gates, again, calling for your digital certificate and your digital vaccine.
[2:26:30.240 --> 2:26:34.960]  With the vaccine, you get nano chips put in you just so you're allowed to travel.
[2:26:34.960 --> 2:26:38.000]  Isn't that just incredibly special?
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.720]  And then, oh, where's my statistics?
[2:26:40.720 --> 2:26:42.240]  I had them here.
[2:26:42.240 --> 2:26:46.800]  It's reported by the UN that 191 million people.
[2:26:46.800 --> 2:26:49.200]  There it is.
[2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:50.200]  That's one statistic.
[2:26:50.200 --> 2:26:51.200]  Here's another.
[2:26:51.200 --> 2:27:00.040]  Since 1989, toward the UN, it's probably 189 million people since 1990.
[2:27:00.040 --> 2:27:08.960]  That's 30 years, died of starvation, 7 million during the Great Depression in the U.S.
[2:27:08.960 --> 2:27:14.160]  But see, they don't count because they weren't all chic wearing the mask.
[2:27:14.160 --> 2:27:16.760]  So there they are right there, folks.
[2:27:16.760 --> 2:27:23.280]  There they are right there, 189 million.
[2:27:23.280 --> 2:27:24.640]  Let's put up the map if we can.
[2:27:24.640 --> 2:27:29.320]  How many have died worldwide from COVID-19, which the CDC admits and BRICS admits they
[2:27:29.320 --> 2:27:33.800]  count every death from cancer, heart attacks, car wreck, if you test positive COVID, COVID
[2:27:33.800 --> 2:27:34.800]  did it.
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:37.120]  So that's way exaggerated.
[2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:41.120]  It's the total takeover.
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:42.120]  It's here.
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:44.280]  The microchips, everything.
[2:27:44.280 --> 2:27:48.160]  That doesn't mean you shouldn't, because of flu viruses, cold viruses, everything else,
[2:27:48.160 --> 2:27:49.920]  boost your overall defenses.
[2:27:49.920 --> 2:27:55.120]  And long before this ever happened, I was saying, get vitamin D3, our winter sun, back in stock,
[2:27:55.120 --> 2:27:56.120]  50% off.
[2:27:56.120 --> 2:28:03.160]  I was saying, for a better life, better exuberance, energy, stamina, libido, clean iodine, we've
[2:28:03.160 --> 2:28:04.160]  got the best.
[2:28:04.160 --> 2:28:05.720]  X3 is still in stock.
[2:28:05.720 --> 2:28:06.720]  X2 sold out.
[2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:07.720]  X3 is selling out quickly.
[2:28:07.720 --> 2:28:11.200]  60% off, despite the fact we're selling out of it.
[2:28:11.200 --> 2:28:16.200]  Total deaths worldwide, 91,783.
[2:28:16.200 --> 2:28:21.800]  Total deaths starvation a year, increase, it's over 10 million a year.
[2:28:21.800 --> 2:28:22.800]  Well over 10.
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:23.800]  It's like 50 million a year.
[2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:27.640]  Extra 2 million they're saying from this, the economy shut down, but that's 2 million
[2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:34.200]  starving to death in Africa and in the Middle East and areas of Asia and areas of Latin
[2:28:34.200 --> 2:28:35.200]  America.
[2:28:35.200 --> 2:28:39.720]  Don't worry about that.
[2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:43.080]  Because that's what this is, cut off the world economy, starve all those brown people
[2:28:43.080 --> 2:28:44.080]  to death.
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:47.600]  But it doesn't matter if Tim Cook owns slave factories, he's gay.
[2:28:47.600 --> 2:28:49.120]  And that's all that matters.
[2:28:49.120 --> 2:28:51.480]  Tim Cook is gay.
[2:28:51.480 --> 2:28:53.760]  Tim Cook is God.
[2:28:53.760 --> 2:28:58.320]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:00.240]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[2:29:00.240 --> 2:29:02.000]  I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:07.400]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[2:29:07.400 --> 2:29:08.520]  my life.
[2:29:08.520 --> 2:29:13.760]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:13.760 --> 2:29:18.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:22.080]  alone, you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:26.760]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[2:29:26.760 --> 2:29:29.080]  and totally change your life.
[2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:34.320]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[2:29:34.320 --> 2:29:38.600]  What's your problem right now, before it gets any worse, get clean.
[2:29:38.600 --> 2:29:54.760]  Call now and learn more 800-506-6740-800-506-6740, that's 800-506-6740.
[2:29:54.760 --> 2:30:01.520]  You have to look really hard at mainstream television news and print media and mainstream
[2:30:01.520 --> 2:30:04.800]  establishment media news sites to find it.
[2:30:04.800 --> 2:30:08.440]  I did extensive searches online with different search engines.
[2:30:08.440 --> 2:30:14.320]  I did a bunch of research looking at different TV archives and I couldn't find hardly anything
[2:30:14.320 --> 2:30:20.680]  except a couple local news stories with medical doctors on there talking about zinc, zinc,
[2:30:20.680 --> 2:30:28.480]  zinc, the element on the periodic table that is essential to life and that is the most
[2:30:28.480 --> 2:30:35.680]  antiviral natural compound out there in thousands and thousands of studies by the most prestigious
[2:30:35.680 --> 2:30:41.200]  universities including big studies on the coronavirus family.
[2:30:41.200 --> 2:30:47.160]  So do yourself a favor, search engine, zinc and antiviral.
[2:30:47.160 --> 2:30:55.480]  Three words, zinc, antiviral, zinc, antiviral, do yourself a favor, zinc, antiviral.
[2:30:55.480 --> 2:30:57.920]  We told you it was coming.
[2:30:57.920 --> 2:31:02.720]  We told you that use of virus to scare everyone into submission and set up martial law and
[2:31:02.720 --> 2:31:07.160]  quarantines and lockdowns and now it's here and I'm here to tell you the rest of the story.
[2:31:07.160 --> 2:31:12.640]  Three things we all need to do, pray to God for justice and seek his face and repent.
[2:31:12.640 --> 2:31:16.160]  Get politically active and wake others up to understand this is the world government,
[2:31:16.160 --> 2:31:21.760]  the castle society it's all being announced and get prepared yourselves and boost your
[2:31:21.760 --> 2:31:27.400]  immune systems and get high quality food and we're able to ship storeable food again.
[2:31:27.400 --> 2:31:32.240]  Our supplier has expanded their factories and now are able to take new wars and it's
[2:31:32.240 --> 2:31:35.240]  not about this virus folks, that's only the trigger, the detonator.
[2:31:35.240 --> 2:31:39.040]  It's about what's coming in the future with elections, maybe canceled, with the global
[2:31:39.040 --> 2:31:40.720]  is trying to implode the economy.
[2:31:40.720 --> 2:31:46.320]  This is just the beginning of the crisis, not the middle and not the end, so get prepared
[2:31:46.320 --> 2:31:52.840]  now while you still can at mforeshore.com and please be Paul Revere's and spread the
[2:31:52.840 --> 2:31:53.840]  word.
[2:31:53.840 --> 2:31:58.000]  This ad will only run for a couple days because it's about to sell out.
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:02.160]  I notice, hey we had a lot of Prostagard, people love it, we've got a lot of it, why
[2:32:02.160 --> 2:32:07.080]  is it suddenly almost sold out and I went, oh my gosh it's an incredible formula, not
[2:32:07.080 --> 2:32:11.680]  just for the prostate, the Sol Palmetto that's on record, for helping that.
[2:32:11.680 --> 2:32:16.680]  It's got everything, vitamin D, a big dose of that, a big dose of zinc, a big dose of
[2:32:16.680 --> 2:32:20.720]  selenium, copper, chromium and a bunch of other stuff.
[2:32:20.720 --> 2:32:26.040]  This is the perfect formula for what's going on right now and it's about to sell out at
[2:32:26.040 --> 2:32:30.800]  mforeshore.com and I want you to have it so that after all this craziness passes, it becomes
[2:32:30.800 --> 2:32:34.920]  a normal regimen in your life because it's something in my view you need every day.
[2:32:34.920 --> 2:32:41.200]  Get it right now, Prostagard at mforeshore.com and whatever you do, please warn others that
[2:32:41.200 --> 2:32:46.320]  Mother Nature has given us a lot of things that really help boost our overall health
[2:32:46.320 --> 2:32:53.320]  and wellness.
[2:33:16.320 --> 2:33:34.480]  The Zythromycin and zinc, they say zinc, you should add zinc, now it all has to be recommended
[2:33:34.480 --> 2:33:39.240]  by doctors, physicians, but they say zinc, I want to throw that out there because that's
[2:33:39.240 --> 2:33:49.520]  where they seem to be having the best result, so you add the zinc and the Zythromycin and
[2:33:49.520 --> 2:33:54.200]  it's been, we've had a lot of good stories, a lot of good stories and we have...
[2:33:54.200 --> 2:33:55.880]  All right, we want to cut in here.
[2:33:55.880 --> 2:34:00.680]  There's two things the president has said in the last 15 minutes that we think is worth
[2:34:00.680 --> 2:34:03.960]  trying to explain or fact check here.
[2:34:03.960 --> 2:34:10.520]  One was on a medical recommendation that the president was making about the use of zinc
[2:34:10.520 --> 2:34:16.720]  and if you were confused, that's why we have Dr. Gupta here, hopefully to at least clear
[2:34:16.720 --> 2:34:23.840]  up that confusion, obviously it's continuing with the president's belief on using this
[2:34:23.840 --> 2:34:25.440]  one therapeutic.
[2:34:25.440 --> 2:34:31.320]  Dr. Gupta, explain what your best you could understand what the president was talking
[2:34:31.320 --> 2:34:34.760]  about when it came to zinc.
[2:34:34.760 --> 2:34:38.000]  Thanks, Chuck, good to see you.
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:39.000]  I don't know.
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:45.160]  Let's stop right there, let's go to the next clip, I don't know.
[2:34:45.160 --> 2:34:50.240]  Everybody knows and if you go to the NIH and type in zinc, it says essential for cellular
[2:34:50.240 --> 2:34:56.640]  activity, essential for immunity, essential for protecting cells from viruses, then it
[2:34:56.640 --> 2:35:01.400]  goes on to say zinc deficiency is one of the leading causes of viral infection, illness
[2:35:01.400 --> 2:35:05.400]  and death, go read it.
[2:35:05.400 --> 2:35:12.040]  But they are literally making it a leftist sacrament now because I'll give it to liberals.
[2:35:12.040 --> 2:35:16.520]  Liberals I knew 30 years ago, 20 years ago, they were the ones that whole foods before,
[2:35:16.520 --> 2:35:24.080]  you know, Bezos owned it that were like, I mean, I remember like a former Olympic swimmer
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:26.800]  that I used to see down at Barton Springs when I swim like a mile, this guy was swimming
[2:35:26.800 --> 2:35:29.760]  like three miles like a rocket ship at like 70.
[2:35:29.760 --> 2:35:34.760]  And he had big jugs when I was in college of water, but it was like orange and I said,
[2:35:34.760 --> 2:35:35.760]  what is it?
[2:35:35.760 --> 2:35:36.760]  He goes, it's iodine.
[2:35:36.760 --> 2:35:40.880]  It's a sink or everything and I mean, I was like, you're freaking but I should have listened
[2:35:40.880 --> 2:35:41.880]  to him.
[2:35:41.880 --> 2:35:47.800]  I look like he was like a 25 Phelps or something at 70 years old, must have moved or something.
[2:35:47.800 --> 2:35:50.440]  You know, I didn't see him after that.
[2:35:50.440 --> 2:35:55.080]  And it was decades later that Dr. Groups like, I don't answer everything, then I looked it
[2:35:55.080 --> 2:35:56.080]  up and it was true.
[2:35:56.080 --> 2:35:58.360]  Two plus billion people have mental disabilities.
[2:35:58.360 --> 2:36:03.840]  The UN says if you listen to them and from lack of iodine.
[2:36:03.840 --> 2:36:04.840]  But here they are.
[2:36:04.840 --> 2:36:07.440]  And we're going to our guest who wanted to come on about this, that's why I'm playing
[2:36:07.440 --> 2:36:08.440]  this now.
[2:36:08.440 --> 2:36:16.960]  Who's a doctor and then by the way of email on record because Trump would leave this
[2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:21.680]  out the last month that the French studies and the US studies and all these medical doctors
[2:36:21.680 --> 2:36:33.400]  were saying hydro hydro systems of the chloroquine is the gun.
[2:36:33.400 --> 2:36:35.400]  The zinc is the bullet.
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:39.760]  And if a gun doesn't have bullets, it's as worthless as tits on a board.
[2:36:39.760 --> 2:36:46.200]  As we say here in Texas.
[2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:50.560]  And so now the president finally comes out and says this after all these medical doctors
[2:36:50.560 --> 2:36:54.080]  are everywhere saying that they're treating people with 100% recovery and the media attacks
[2:36:54.080 --> 2:36:55.800]  seem because they don't want you having hope.
[2:36:55.800 --> 2:36:58.120]  It's Bill Gates and his microchip and all of it.
[2:36:58.120 --> 2:37:02.600]  Here's ABC News LA because local news to it and totally control.
[2:37:02.600 --> 2:37:05.920]  They get the propaganda they repeat, but they have their own little segments and hey, we
[2:37:05.920 --> 2:37:06.920]  know this medical doctor.
[2:37:06.920 --> 2:37:07.920]  He's got a big practice.
[2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:08.920]  He comes on all the time.
[2:37:08.920 --> 2:37:09.920]  We respect him.
[2:37:09.920 --> 2:37:10.920]  Doctor, what's working for you?
[2:37:10.920 --> 2:37:15.120]  100% recovery zinc with hydroxychloroquine.
[2:37:15.120 --> 2:37:19.360]  But if you take hydroxychloroquine by itself, it can kill you and the doctors explain because
[2:37:19.360 --> 2:37:21.640]  you don't have zinc and it causes a chemical imbalance.
[2:37:21.640 --> 2:37:26.600]  You've got to have the zinc, but zinc by itself as a preventative.
[2:37:26.600 --> 2:37:29.840]  Once you've got it, yeah, you're in trouble, but it's the preventative.
[2:37:29.840 --> 2:37:31.000]  And that's what they're saying.
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:33.920]  They literally have had attorney generals contact us over this.
[2:37:33.920 --> 2:37:40.000]  They've literally had George Soros come after us, sings, stop it.
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:42.320]  How am I supposed to not tell people this?
[2:37:42.320 --> 2:37:44.680]  And now they're saying medical doctors can't tell you.
[2:37:44.680 --> 2:37:46.080]  Now they're saying the president can't tell you.
[2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:49.400]  We're going to go to Dr. Shiva Idorei, one of our favorite guests here in a moment.
[2:37:49.400 --> 2:37:51.280]  We'll do a little bit the next hour before our next guest takes over.
[2:37:51.280 --> 2:37:53.440]  Got a big raft of big guests.
[2:37:53.440 --> 2:37:54.880]  But here's that clip off ABC News.
[2:37:54.880 --> 2:37:55.880]  They don't want you to see.
[2:37:55.880 --> 2:37:56.880]  Okay.
[2:37:56.880 --> 2:37:58.400]  Real quick, we have a little bit of time left.
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:00.520]  I do want to ask you about hydroxychloroquine.
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:03.720]  The president was pushing it pretty strong again yesterday.
[2:38:03.720 --> 2:38:05.720]  You said you have prescribed this.
[2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:09.080]  I want to talk to you about the effects you're seeing and what it might do for people who
[2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:15.480]  take it normally outside of coronavirus and a possible shortage of medicine for them.
[2:38:15.480 --> 2:38:16.480]  Exactly.
[2:38:16.480 --> 2:38:20.520]  What we're finding clinically with our patients is that it really only works in conjunction
[2:38:20.520 --> 2:38:21.520]  with zinc.
[2:38:21.520 --> 2:38:25.800]  So the hydroxychloroquine opens the zinc channel, zinc goes into the cell, it then blocks the
[2:38:25.800 --> 2:38:27.800]  replication of the cellular machinery.
[2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:30.280]  So it has to be used in conjunction with zinc.
[2:38:30.280 --> 2:38:33.360]  We are seeing some clinical responses in that regard.
[2:38:33.360 --> 2:38:37.160]  There are people that take it regularly for other disease processes.
[2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:42.000]  We have to be cautious and mindful that we don't prescribe it for patients who have COVID
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  that are well.
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:47.240]  It really should be reserved for people that are really sick in the hospital or at home
[2:38:47.240 --> 2:38:49.160]  very sick that need that medication.
[2:38:49.160 --> 2:38:52.640]  Otherwise, we're going to blow through our supply for the patients that take it regularly
[2:38:52.640 --> 2:38:53.640]  for other disease processes.
[2:38:53.640 --> 2:38:59.640]  But what you're saying is you're prescribing it and it is working for COVID-19 patients.
[2:38:59.640 --> 2:39:02.560]  Every patient I've prescribed it to has been very, very ill.
[2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:05.880]  And within eight to 12 hours, they were basically symptom free.
[2:39:05.880 --> 2:39:11.640]  And so, critically, I am seeing a resolution that mirrors what we saw in the French study
[2:39:11.640 --> 2:39:13.120]  and some of the other studies worldwide.
[2:39:13.120 --> 2:39:16.240]  And that's exactly what I've said and Trump has said, and I was banned off Google app
[2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:17.640]  for it.
[2:39:17.640 --> 2:39:19.400]  Why would these people try to block that?
[2:39:19.400 --> 2:39:20.920]  Dr. Shiva, I do, right?
[2:39:20.920 --> 2:39:21.920]  Thanks for joining us.
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:24.360]  I know you've been at the tip of the spear exposing this.
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:28.040]  We'll get it out and protect ourselves, but why is Big Pharma trying to block this?
[2:39:28.040 --> 2:39:31.760]  I mean, they're really showing themselves to be villains, telling the president, don't
[2:39:31.760 --> 2:39:38.640]  tell people about zinc, what do you think is happening, doctor?
[2:39:38.640 --> 2:39:45.280]  Well, look, Alex, you know, about two weeks ago on March 23rd, I wrote a letter to the
[2:39:45.280 --> 2:39:50.760]  president which really laid out a methodology for really addressing this without completely
[2:39:50.760 --> 2:39:51.760]  destroying the economy.
[2:39:51.760 --> 2:39:56.800]  I said, we need to balance immune health with economic health.
[2:39:56.800 --> 2:40:01.920]  And that came out, Alex, because a very senior person around the administration contacted
[2:40:01.920 --> 2:40:07.400]  me out of nowhere and he said, look, we as economists are being told to backfill in economic
[2:40:07.400 --> 2:40:10.440]  policy with health policy leading it.
[2:40:10.440 --> 2:40:13.760]  And I said, look, Fauci is practicing fake science.
[2:40:13.760 --> 2:40:20.400]  The science that Anthony Fauci is using is based on a very, very archaic model of the
[2:40:20.400 --> 2:40:21.400]  immune system.
[2:40:21.400 --> 2:40:26.280]  And the fundamental analysis here, Alex, is four months ago, I gave a talk at the National
[2:40:26.280 --> 2:40:27.280]  Science Foundation.
[2:40:27.280 --> 2:40:28.280]  I gave a distinguished lecture.
[2:40:28.280 --> 2:40:33.040]  And I laid out a much more robust view of the immune system, which includes, you know,
[2:40:33.040 --> 2:40:37.200]  the microbiome, the virome, the innate, the adaptive, the interferon, a much more complex
[2:40:37.200 --> 2:40:38.200]  system.
[2:40:38.200 --> 2:40:42.720]  And what I shared was at the fundamental level, it's not the virus or these bacteria, these
[2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:44.560]  pathogens that harm us.
[2:40:44.560 --> 2:40:48.600]  What actually harms us is an overreactive immune system.
[2:40:48.600 --> 2:40:50.160]  It's our own body.
[2:40:50.160 --> 2:40:53.760]  When you shut down, you know, you have, let's say, six cylinders, the innate and the adaptive,
[2:40:53.760 --> 2:40:55.640]  the macrophages and the T cells.
[2:40:55.640 --> 2:41:00.760]  But if those get shut down, for example, by a high sugar diet, the cytokine storm takes
[2:41:00.760 --> 2:41:03.080]  over and we attack our own bodies.
[2:41:03.080 --> 2:41:07.240]  In the case of Ebola, for example, we start attacking the endothelial cells and you start
[2:41:07.240 --> 2:41:09.040]  bleeding out.
[2:41:09.040 --> 2:41:14.280]  In the case of this, we attack our own epithelial cells and we fill the lungs with, you know,
[2:41:14.280 --> 2:41:15.280]  fluid.
[2:41:15.280 --> 2:41:16.280]  And that's what's taking place.
[2:41:16.280 --> 2:41:19.440]  So just like the Spanish flu, it's the autoimmune response.
[2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:20.920]  It's the autoimmune response.
[2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:23.560]  And the fundamental thing here, Alex, is think about it.
[2:41:23.560 --> 2:41:25.920]  One of these freaking guys are talking about that.
[2:41:25.920 --> 2:41:31.120]  Fauci, what is his big establishment goal with his buddies at the Gates Foundation at
[2:41:31.120 --> 2:41:32.640]  the Chan Zuckerberg Foundation?
[2:41:32.640 --> 2:41:33.640]  Vaccines.
[2:41:33.640 --> 2:41:34.640]  Vaccines.
[2:41:34.640 --> 2:41:35.640]  Vaccines.
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:36.640]  Vaccines.
[2:41:36.640 --> 2:41:37.640]  And they're teeing this up to fear monger.
[2:41:37.640 --> 2:41:41.480]  So next year, this time, all of us, we can't get our driver ID, right?
[2:41:41.480 --> 2:41:42.600]  You got to get your driver license.
[2:41:42.600 --> 2:41:44.000]  Where's your vaccine card?
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:45.560]  That's that one trajectory.
[2:41:45.560 --> 2:41:50.280]  But no one is talking about some very central things and how do we get both of this working?
[2:41:50.280 --> 2:41:54.680]  So in that letter to the president, I said, look, let's take the COVID-19 people and give
[2:41:54.680 --> 2:41:56.840]  them high dose vitamin DNA.
[2:41:56.840 --> 2:41:58.360]  And we can talk about that.
[2:41:58.360 --> 2:42:00.600]  Let's take the people are critically ill.
[2:42:00.600 --> 2:42:03.200]  And by the way, 80 to 90% of the people are critically ill.
[2:42:03.200 --> 2:42:07.040]  They put them on these stupid ventilators and they're literally asphyxiating if they
[2:42:07.040 --> 2:42:08.040]  have hypoxia.
[2:42:08.040 --> 2:42:10.960]  And that's why they want more ventilators because they know we got to, the left wants
[2:42:10.960 --> 2:42:13.400]  to kill as many as possible to boost the number.
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:14.400]  Yeah.
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:16.240]  And the hospital administrators make money on that.
[2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:20.920]  The hospitals, the people selling this make money, but the fundamental reason is you have
[2:42:20.920 --> 2:42:24.040]  a cytokine storm taking place in the lungs.
[2:42:24.040 --> 2:42:28.000]  You put these ventilators in and there's beautiful papers written showing this that you actually
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:29.840]  further destroy the lungs.
[2:42:29.840 --> 2:42:30.840]  Simple solution.
[2:42:30.840 --> 2:42:33.560]  By the way, you were saying this two weeks ago, you're the president, I should have had
[2:42:33.560 --> 2:42:34.560]  you on that.
[2:42:34.560 --> 2:42:35.560]  I know you were on with Owen.
[2:42:35.560 --> 2:42:36.560]  Yeah.
[2:42:36.560 --> 2:42:39.000]  Now doctors are coming out saying we're killing people with these ventilators.
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:40.760]  They're having an autoimmune response.
[2:42:40.760 --> 2:42:46.600]  They're having a fever, a vener of email, he's on record, he's in a vener of it, is
[2:42:46.600 --> 2:42:51.280]  with us right now and he owns a medical company, a bunch of stuff he's doing.
[2:42:51.280 --> 2:42:52.280]  We'll be right back.
[2:42:52.280 --> 2:42:53.280]  Stay with us.
[2:42:53.280 --> 2:42:58.880]  Do yourself a favor and fund the info war at the same time.
[2:42:58.880 --> 2:43:04.400]  Go to infowarstore.com and read about the ingredients, the highest quality like black
[2:43:04.400 --> 2:43:08.720]  walnut and others that are in this baby and then read some of those reviews for yourself.
[2:43:08.720 --> 2:43:12.920]  And then don't just believe in force, go out online at major nutrition sites and others
[2:43:12.920 --> 2:43:15.320]  and look at the studies for yourself.
[2:43:15.320 --> 2:43:19.440]  Go out and engage in your first amendment right to research, your first amendment right
[2:43:19.440 --> 2:43:24.440]  to tell others about incredible compounds God has given us through Mother Nature.
[2:43:24.440 --> 2:43:28.160]  Living Defense is at infowarstore.com sold out for four months.

[2:43:54.440 --> 2:43:56.680]  Listen to me very carefully.
[2:43:56.680 --> 2:44:02.600]  We have confirmed that California is shut within days or weeks to announce a total stay
[2:44:02.600 --> 2:44:09.520]  at home order and will shut down grocery stores and yes even pharmacies ladies and gentlemen.
[2:44:09.520 --> 2:44:13.880]  This is what they're announcing to create total panic to try to trigger a depression
[2:44:13.880 --> 2:44:15.720]  to blame on Trump.
[2:44:15.720 --> 2:44:22.080]  Then when Trump doesn't follow suit they will blame every single death on President Trump.
[2:44:22.080 --> 2:44:27.440]  This is a Psyop using a real deadly virus this is super dangerous and everyone needs
[2:44:27.440 --> 2:44:30.560]  to get supplies in now.

[2:44:55.920 --> 2:45:02.920]  As predicted the human rebellion against globalist machines has begun.
[2:45:02.920 --> 2:45:08.480]  The LA Times, The Washington Post, Wired Magazine all reported years ago that major studies
[2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:13.000]  show 5G caused increased cancer in rats.
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  It's a fact.
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:19.040]  5G is just the later generation of systems that are on record for more than 70 years
[2:45:19.040 --> 2:45:20.640]  to cause cancer.
[2:45:20.640 --> 2:45:23.600]  They rub the DNA molecules together.
[2:45:23.600 --> 2:45:26.200]  They are microwaves.
[2:45:26.200 --> 2:45:31.720]  Well now YouTube has admitted to the BBC and others that they're banning anyone criticizing
[2:45:31.720 --> 2:45:36.200]  5G even if you don't connect to coronavirus they're banning it.
[2:45:36.200 --> 2:45:41.080]  But the studies do show that 5G lowers your immunity to viruses period.
[2:45:41.080 --> 2:45:45.840]  They're peer reviewed journals we're showing these documents on air and the globalist can
[2:45:45.840 --> 2:45:46.840]  go to hell.
[2:45:46.840 --> 2:45:50.160]  The human rebellion against globalist machines has begun.
[2:45:50.160 --> 2:45:52.360]  We're not troglodytes afraid of technology.
[2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:55.920]  We don't like technology with Trojan Horse anti human crap in it.
[2:45:55.920 --> 2:46:00.920]  I don't need to remind you how 4 years ago I told you the polls against Trump were fake.
[2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:06.200]  He was winning by a giant margin but election fraud almost stole the election from Trump
[2:46:06.200 --> 2:46:07.200]  and the American people.
[2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:13.720]  Well now they're pushing the idea that oh cancel the Republican and Democrat conventions
[2:46:13.720 --> 2:46:18.920]  maybe cancel the election a year like the Olympics that's because they know Trump in
[2:46:18.920 --> 2:46:25.200]  every internal scientific poll is 20 points ahead of the brain damage Biden.
[2:46:25.200 --> 2:46:30.160]  So they can say sir you look big like the Olympics go back it off a year and then you'll
[2:46:30.160 --> 2:46:32.880]  still win in a year after you fix the crisis no.
[2:46:32.880 --> 2:46:37.960]  They need more time to cook up an assassination an economic collapse a new virus.
[2:46:37.960 --> 2:46:43.520]  Trump needs to say no in America we keep elections on time have the elections win by a landslide
[2:46:43.520 --> 2:46:45.800]  and not give the globalist what they want.
[2:46:45.800 --> 2:46:50.360]  Hillary Biden they all want to suspend the election we shouldn't give them what they
[2:46:50.360 --> 2:46:51.360]  want.
[2:46:51.360 --> 2:46:58.000]  We need to have a vote in America and reelect Trump 2020.
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:27.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[2:47:28.400 --> 2:47:30.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:36.480]  Can you believe how Twilight Zone this is AG bar very concerned for Bill Gates digital
[2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:42.960]  vaccine certificates calls lockdown measures draconian once them gone and then Bill Gates
[2:47:42.960 --> 2:47:49.480]  wants you to take a digital ink that's micro chips that's nano tech to prove you've been
[2:47:49.480 --> 2:47:57.160]  vaccinated to buy or sell or travel that's not coming that's proposed folks Dr. Shiva
[2:47:57.160 --> 2:48:01.440]  idea raise our guest he owns a major medical company there's a lot of research and vendor
[2:48:01.440 --> 2:48:07.400]  of the term email original email protocols and he's here with us now you're making great
[2:48:07.400 --> 2:48:10.960]  points you sent a great letter to the president when you get back into that letter in common
[2:48:10.960 --> 2:48:16.280]  sense but the doctors are backing you up saying this is an autoimmune deal people like the
[2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:20.760]  Spanish flu are having a huge event you know what they need is something to you know calm
[2:48:20.760 --> 2:48:24.960]  that down to kill that and then meanwhile the media tries to stop oh doctors don't give
[2:48:24.960 --> 2:48:30.480]  them a drug to stop inflammation oh don't take turmeric oh don't take vitamin D3 oh don't
[2:48:30.480 --> 2:48:37.720]  take you know zinc don't do any of this just just there's no hope wait for the vaccine
[2:48:37.720 --> 2:48:43.240]  Alex I think what I want to share with your audience because you know there's a huge reach
[2:48:43.240 --> 2:48:47.320]  you have and I've been sharing this directly first of all I think let's go to the first
[2:48:47.320 --> 2:48:51.640]  point is that the immune system is not some weak link you know we live around with about
[2:48:51.640 --> 2:48:57.120]  380 trillion viruses we around 60 trillion bacteria within us we're a walking germ factory
[2:48:57.120 --> 2:49:00.560]  you know and we have all of this stuff around us so first of all people need to get away
[2:49:00.560 --> 2:49:05.040]  from this fear mongering which is what the Fauci's and the elites want us to do so we
[2:49:05.040 --> 2:49:09.080]  give away our all of our rights that's the first thing the other thing we need to understand
[2:49:09.080 --> 2:49:15.120]  is let's start with some very basic principles that if you are consuming proper amounts of
[2:49:15.120 --> 2:49:19.960]  vitamin D and vitamin A you modulate these extraordinary reactions that take place in
[2:49:19.960 --> 2:49:25.520]  your body one of the things Alex said that people don't understand with vitamin D3 we
[2:49:25.520 --> 2:49:31.440]  get it from the sun but vitamin D3 is like the gun and through a series of chemical reactions
[2:49:31.440 --> 2:49:37.240]  your body produces these very powerful chemicals called catholocidins catholocidins are like
[2:49:37.240 --> 2:49:42.360]  bullets that are processed after vitamin D through a process and those catholocidins
[2:49:42.360 --> 2:49:48.560]  literally blow up and disrupt the membrane of viruses fungi parasites etc. bacteria
[2:49:48.560 --> 2:49:53.480]  so vitamin C is a massive antimicrobial in addition to being a powerful hormone this
[2:49:53.480 --> 2:49:56.920]  is something central so in the letter to the president I said first of all if you take
[2:49:56.920 --> 2:50:03.000]  those people of COVID-19 or people who are immunocompromised you give them very high dosage
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:08.920]  around 400,000 I use a vitamin A which I'll come to and 50,000 I use a vitamin D and this
[2:50:08.920 --> 2:50:12.840]  is by the way well written in the literature it's not something I'm making up you know
[2:50:12.840 --> 2:50:19.200]  80,000 papers written on vitamin D so vitamin D is an antimicrobial that's why when the
[2:50:19.200 --> 2:50:23.720]  sun comes that's why all these cultures respect to the sun because it literally blows up you
[2:50:23.720 --> 2:50:26.800]  know disrupts the cell membranes of viruses bacteria etc.
[2:50:26.800 --> 2:50:31.600]  Yeah that's why ancient Germans as you know brought evergreens in because they could live
[2:50:31.600 --> 2:50:35.040]  in the winter they thought it was magic they knew everybody got sick and died in the winter
[2:50:35.040 --> 2:50:38.480]  in the caves but when the sun came out everybody got well.
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:41.960]  Exactly so the thing is what you have Fauci and these guys doing is first of all they're
[2:50:41.960 --> 2:50:46.520]  projected ridiculous numbers of how many were going to die now they're cooking the books
[2:50:46.520 --> 2:50:51.360]  throwing everything under COVID-19 they want to say that flattening the curve and social
[2:50:51.360 --> 2:50:55.440]  distancing is what was going to solve it in June it's going to be really vitamin D.
[2:50:55.440 --> 2:51:01.360]  The second issue is vitamin A by the way what I just shared with you vitamin D 99% of MDs
[2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:05.840]  unfortunately because of their big pharma education have no idea what catholocidins
[2:51:05.840 --> 2:51:06.840]  are they don't learn this.
[2:51:06.840 --> 2:51:10.920]  By the way I showed a few months ago the UN report on vaccines they admitted they don't
[2:51:10.920 --> 2:51:16.240]  study nutrition what vaccines do they don't study any of that that's part of the big pharma
[2:51:16.240 --> 2:51:20.040]  medical education they're victims they're sort of in golden handcuffs the other thing
[2:51:20.040 --> 2:51:24.200]  is vitamin A well what is vitamin A just like vitamin D comes from the sun a natural
[2:51:24.200 --> 2:51:29.560]  source vitamin A if the thyroid is working right you have proper iodine and proper iodide
[2:51:29.560 --> 2:51:34.440]  it's working right we take these beautiful dark grief leafy vegetables and fruits and
[2:51:34.440 --> 2:51:39.480]  our body creates vitamin A but what does vitamin A do in addition to being an amazing hormone
[2:51:39.480 --> 2:51:44.320]  which modulates those immune reactions because I want to get back to A you're right I've
[2:51:44.320 --> 2:51:49.480]  missed that I've seen that literature yeah you mentioned E why is you mentioned C why
[2:51:49.480 --> 2:51:54.920]  is zinc so key or you're you're talking about other stuff right now well zinc inhibits these
[2:51:54.920 --> 2:52:00.240]  viral replication processes okay and zinc as you said is essential if you're going to
[2:52:00.240 --> 2:52:04.480]  take the hydroxyl chloroquine and I want to talk about that but let me just finish with
[2:52:04.480 --> 2:52:08.640]  vitamin A the reason vitamin A again it's not taught in medical schools people really
[2:52:08.640 --> 2:52:14.120]  don't talk about as vitamin A is extremely important because it builds cytokeratin it
[2:52:14.120 --> 2:52:18.200]  literally builds walls around ourselves so if you think about it from a prophylactic
[2:52:18.200 --> 2:52:23.800]  standpoint you stop the viruses from even impinging on coming on the cell surface right
[2:52:23.800 --> 2:52:27.920]  first of all the virus has got to learn to come I mean it's got to come in so the vitamin
[2:52:27.920 --> 2:52:32.480]  A builds the cytokeratin essentially little walls around all cells there's some beautiful
[2:52:32.480 --> 2:52:37.560]  pictures which I've shared in one of my videos if it makes it through then the virus then
[2:52:37.560 --> 2:52:42.600]  has to get in through the ACE2 receptor which is COVID-19 and then when it goes in you have
[2:52:42.600 --> 2:52:48.640]  vitamin D literally knocking it out now the point is vitamin D and A are supporting you
[2:52:48.640 --> 2:52:53.360]  prophylactic prophylactically in amazing way because A they're stopping the virus from
[2:52:53.360 --> 2:52:58.200]  coming in through vitamin A and vitamin D is an antimicrobial particularly high dosage
[2:52:58.200 --> 2:53:04.600]  let's talk about hydrochlorohydroxychloroquine now it's been out there but we have to understand
[2:53:04.600 --> 2:53:09.080]  that it is a pharmaceutical alternative the fouchies of the world want to go vaccines
[2:53:09.080 --> 2:53:13.720]  vaccines vaccines but the hydroxychloroquine you know there's still these sharks around
[2:53:13.720 --> 2:53:18.240]  there which want to still figure out a way to pharma to get in it has some very powerful
[2:53:18.240 --> 2:53:25.200]  beneficial properties no doubt it stops glycosylation so when that virus tries to land and connect
[2:53:25.200 --> 2:53:31.080]  to that ACE2 receptor Alex it stop it inhibits glycosylation because glycosylation needs
[2:53:31.080 --> 2:53:37.120]  to take place so the virus can even get in so that's very good if it gets in hydroxychloroquine
[2:53:37.120 --> 2:53:42.840]  is also very valuable for stopping the RNA replication for the virus transport so can't
[2:53:42.840 --> 2:53:47.720]  get out and furthermore it also helps modulate the cytokine storm but as you just brought
[2:53:47.720 --> 2:53:54.920]  out it's not that effective without zinc zinc is extremely important by and unto itself
[2:53:54.920 --> 2:54:01.480]  hydroxychloroquine you know chloroquine has nearly 61 different side effects okay so
[2:54:01.480 --> 2:54:05.680]  as people are starting to you know let's say a hospital worker believes they were exposed
[2:54:05.680 --> 2:54:11.400]  to someone or you think you got exposed to someone the thesis is that you give the hydroxychloroquine
[2:54:11.400 --> 2:54:17.680]  ahead to protect them my point is okay that's one solution the other thing is none of these
[2:54:17.680 --> 2:54:22.760]  guys are talking about vitamin D and vitamin A okay that I'm not a doctor like you but
[2:54:22.760 --> 2:54:26.840]  in the literature if you take hydroxychloroquine and zinc isn't there it's going to push other
[2:54:26.840 --> 2:54:31.440]  chemicals and things and cause that causes side effects you doctors are saying you've
[2:54:31.440 --> 2:54:36.440]  got to have high levels of zinc they debate this some say 100 milligrams some say 250
[2:54:36.440 --> 2:54:40.800]  but it can't hurt kidneys no one I've talked like five or six medical doctors will give
[2:54:40.800 --> 2:54:45.880]  me a straight answer doctor on how much zinc per pound let's say 200 pounds how much zinc
[2:54:45.880 --> 2:54:51.000]  would you take to front load so you don't get sick if you are sick what do you take
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:55.400]  so so the issue is you know when you get to around 90 milligrams for for a human being
[2:54:55.400 --> 2:55:00.600]  right for a typical adult you're getting to a very very high dosage point but the point
[2:55:00.600 --> 2:55:06.920]  is the hydroxychloroquine solution I'm not going to attack it hard but it does have side
[2:55:06.920 --> 2:55:11.880]  effects the alternative prophylactic you're saying if you have vitamin D3 if you have
[2:55:11.880 --> 2:55:18.360]  vitamin A and vitamin C you're in like Flynn you're exactly you're protected think about
[2:55:18.360 --> 2:55:21.840]  your wearing armor let me ask this next question how do you want to get people solution the
[2:55:21.840 --> 2:55:26.240]  audience knows this I'm glad you here breaking it down so eloquently and I'm glad the White
[2:55:26.240 --> 2:55:29.760]  House is listening to you and others let me ask this question what do you make of the
[2:55:29.760 --> 2:55:36.320]  media attacking the president anybody that says this well look the number look what's
[2:55:36.320 --> 2:55:42.520]  happening Alex's big pharma you know my company cytosolve it's a technology to model molecular
[2:55:42.520 --> 2:55:46.840]  pathways we help figure out how to figure me understand how medicines work faster cheaper
[2:55:46.840 --> 2:55:50.600]  and faster the reason that we created that obviously was in the natural products where
[2:55:50.600 --> 2:55:55.320]  we had hoped that these pharma companies would want to eliminate toxicity the reality is pharma
[2:55:55.320 --> 2:56:00.200]  companies when everyone needs to listen to carefully are going out of business their
[2:56:00.200 --> 2:56:04.840]  pharmaceutical drug compounds year over year they put more and more money to r&d and even
[2:56:04.840 --> 2:56:09.440]  the FDA is not allowing it out because of the supplements are going straight up and
[2:56:09.440 --> 2:56:14.720]  supplements 240 billion dollar industry in functional foods people that's the natural
[2:56:14.720 --> 2:56:20.600]  thing God gave us the earth gave us mother nature versus their BS versus their BS and
[2:56:20.600 --> 2:56:26.800]  the problem is they see this movement of people moving to want to take care of the lies decentralized
[2:56:26.800 --> 2:56:31.680]  why they're coming in you're going to take shots we're going to ban everything we say
[2:56:31.680 --> 2:56:36.760]  because this is their death rose I agree it's top down medicine so their only alternative
[2:56:36.760 --> 2:56:41.120]  is vaccines why vaccines because a they don't need to go through the same just five more
[2:56:41.120 --> 2:56:44.840]  minutes with us and this is so important you've been on politics you're great there but you're

[2:59:47.920 --> 3:00:08.680]  we're listening to the alex jones show waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[3:00:08.680 --> 3:00:12.160]  you know people always give out the letters after this guy's been on probably 30 times
[3:00:12.160 --> 3:00:19.040]  I didn't do that he's a phd mit he's in all the microbiology but integrates it with biomechanical
[3:00:19.040 --> 3:00:22.920]  and with the nanotech and all of it he'll be back with us tomorrow if he can do it early
[3:00:22.920 --> 3:00:29.120]  in the show to get into solutions dr. shiva idore is with us we got four minutes and 15
[3:00:29.120 --> 3:00:35.640]  20 seconds left sir to me I mean everything you're saying we know is established medicine
[3:00:35.640 --> 3:00:42.120]  I mean even md doctors but now they're trying to literally say they banned me off of Google
[3:00:42.120 --> 3:00:47.640]  app last week and they put the video up and said look he says zinc helps and vitamin d
[3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:53.520]  helps and vitamin c I was just reading studies so this is next level they say they're all
[3:00:53.520 --> 3:00:57.960]  about science why in the hell would they not want us to have as we were saying as the number
[3:00:57.960 --> 3:01:03.800]  show big pharma is dying yeah so so alex one of the interesting things that this is
[3:01:03.800 --> 3:01:10.280]  a side note on that in 2015 the 11th circuit court ruled yeah this is an important point
[3:01:10.280 --> 3:01:15.880]  you may want to talk to your lawyers at some point that the fdc must consider they can't
[3:01:15.880 --> 3:01:22.040]  you can support claims if you can show mechanisms of action right how a particular thing affects
[3:01:22.040 --> 3:01:26.320]  some particular I had the attorney general's office in New York not the general itself
[3:01:26.320 --> 3:01:30.280]  but their office goes actually we're supposed to ask for your science now like are you seriously
[3:01:30.280 --> 3:01:34.840]  yeah we want the science and they said okay once we gave them the science well one of
[3:01:34.840 --> 3:01:40.080]  the things is the technology that I created oops out of my phd work at MIT alex sorry
[3:01:40.080 --> 3:01:46.120]  about that try to solve it literally helps us understand the molecular mechanisms of
[3:01:46.120 --> 3:01:51.720]  action so we help a lot of people want to do great products actually find natural products
[3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:56.680]  actually find the mechanisms of action and that creates by law a way that you can defend
[3:01:56.680 --> 3:02:00.640]  claims but separate from that getting back to the coronavirus the important piece here
[3:02:00.640 --> 3:02:07.120]  is that vitamin a and d the d which creates catholosidens which literally support antimicrobial
[3:02:07.120 --> 3:02:13.000]  effects of vitamin a which builds cytokartens to me they're the two real powerful weapons
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:18.080]  that everyone should be using as a baseline which can have equal or better than the hydroxy
[3:02:18.080 --> 3:02:22.800]  chlorachloroquine particularly because there's not as much side side effects that's why I
[3:02:22.800 --> 3:02:27.280]  have prescribed that or promoted that in the letter to the president obviously I promoted
[3:02:27.280 --> 3:02:31.840]  something which you're you've been you know also talking about which is the iodine and
[3:02:31.840 --> 3:02:37.800]  the iodide you need both the iodine and the potassium iodide which really supports our
[3:02:37.800 --> 3:02:42.200]  thyroid health by the way everybody kept asking me if x2 is the best the purest deep
[3:02:42.200 --> 3:02:46.320]  growth crystal iodine we had to get a DEA license to have it why do you have a new one
[3:02:46.320 --> 3:02:51.680]  because doctors like you and I know you're said alex you need the other iodines to make
[3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:56.440]  sure it uploads and that's why we have the potassium iodide right so you need both because
[3:02:56.440 --> 3:03:01.640]  that supports the carotenoids creating vitamin a but the one of the things that I think people
[3:03:01.640 --> 3:03:06.160]  should take away from today's talk and we'll talk I know more tomorrow is that we're actually
[3:03:06.160 --> 3:03:12.200]  freaking killing these people 80% of the people gone ventilators are being basically they're
[3:03:12.200 --> 3:03:18.880]  saying they're dead okay and high dose vitamin C I just tweeted this out alex that the president
[3:03:18.880 --> 3:03:23.560]  should pass an executive order that people are critically ill they should be given the
[3:03:23.560 --> 3:03:30.400]  high dose therapeutic dose of high dose IV right it's it's very simple it actually works
[3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:35.920]  it stops the cytokine storm because what we're doing is the alveolus is filling up with with
[3:03:35.920 --> 3:03:40.640]  fluid and think about it so stupid right you're filling up with fluid because of the cytokine
[3:03:40.640 --> 3:03:44.080]  storm and then you're sending more pressure in there well what the hell is that going
[3:03:44.080 --> 3:03:50.080]  to do right the long tissue yeah you're going to further damage it the the alveolus and
[3:03:50.080 --> 3:03:53.760]  they're almost like more disease being advised the globalists know they want to kill people
[3:03:53.760 --> 3:03:58.120]  because they want to hire a number well they want to kill people and so you're you're going
[3:03:58.120 --> 3:04:02.640]  our vaccines versus vitamins ventilator versus vitamin listen I'm going to leave the show
[3:04:02.640 --> 3:04:07.280]  tomorrow with you if you come on 11 a.m. a doctor this is so important totally right
[3:04:07.280 --> 3:04:12.560]  and we have medical doctors saying good we have a huge opportunity alex to get the word
[3:04:12.560 --> 3:04:16.080]  out there before I close I want everyone to know you know I'm running for U.S. Senate
[3:04:16.080 --> 3:04:20.400]  we'll talk about it more we need to get on the ballot the globalists here the democratic
[3:04:20.400 --> 3:04:25.600]  party listen listen 11 15 tomorrow come on do the ventilators medical doctors agree with
[3:04:25.600 --> 3:04:29.600]  you then get into how to defend and get into Senate everything God bless you my friend
[3:04:29.600 --> 3:04:33.960]  the fact let's put this what's the best place for people to find you online doctor what's
[3:04:33.960 --> 3:04:40.080]  that best place to find you online V.A. Shiva dot com or Shiva numeral force Senate dot
[3:04:40.080 --> 3:04:46.200]  com Shiva force Senate great job Jason Jones is a huge filmmaker he's the first person
[3:04:46.200 --> 3:04:50.680]  exposed his hospitals and things were empty he's about to host with big guess he's got
[3:04:50.680 --> 3:05:00.120]  lined up something huge is happening all over the United States on ABC CBS NBC on local
[3:05:00.120 --> 3:05:04.800]  Fox affiliates but only local ones they're having medical doctors on who successfully
[3:05:04.800 --> 3:05:10.200]  treated their patients with 100% recovery rates with hydroxychloroquine but you've got
[3:05:10.200 --> 3:05:17.280]  to have the zinc this is a known fact but national news other than Fox will not carry
[3:05:17.280 --> 3:05:21.760]  it and when Tucker Carlson Laura Ingram and Shawna entity covered it and had medical doctors
[3:05:21.760 --> 3:05:26.840]  talk about it they got demonized and Fox had them basically shut up but they've been vindicated
[3:05:26.840 --> 3:05:31.560]  info wars has been vindicated we were saying at first with experts we had on air we got
[3:05:31.560 --> 3:05:37.120]  attacked nationally and they said take us off the air Google took our app away saying
[3:05:37.120 --> 3:05:42.640]  that we were putting out fake cures for staying hydroxychloroquine zinc and CPAC when all we
[3:05:42.640 --> 3:05:47.000]  were doing was reporting with medical journals were saying big pharma and the globalist one
[3:05:47.000 --> 3:06:03.040]  is sick and dead and they don't want you to boost your immune system screw them
[3:06:03.040 --> 3:06:24.480]  so I'm Jason Jones gas hosting and I brought my friends so I've been a fan of Alex Jones
[3:06:24.480 --> 3:06:28.800]  for almost 30 years going way back to when he was on public access and before you were
[3:06:28.800 --> 3:06:37.240]  born what year were you born 1995 right around when you were born sweet and so to be asked
[3:06:37.240 --> 3:06:42.240]  to guest host this week of all weeks when I know all of us who follow Alex are paying
[3:06:42.240 --> 3:06:49.040]  attention this week we're looking for answers this week and I didn't intend to start a film
[3:06:49.040 --> 3:06:55.000]  your hospital movement I just wanted to go to our local urgent care and did you mention
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:07:00.800]  to them where we are right now we are in my home office on the west side of Oahu Oahu
[3:07:00.800 --> 3:07:06.120]  which is an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean within the Hawaiian chains so yes we
[3:07:06.120 --> 3:07:13.680]  are getting hit by the coronavirus pandemic here is here as well so we're the only two
[3:07:13.680 --> 3:07:18.960]  brave people enough to sit this close to each other to go on Alex Jones show because everyone
[3:07:18.960 --> 3:07:24.080]  else is you know I'm the only brave one yeah because I've been tested and so you know I
[3:07:24.080 --> 3:07:30.200]  don't have it I don't know about you okay I guess that means the reason I asked Tiana
[3:07:30.200 --> 3:07:39.800]  to be on is it's intimidating to do this show alone and I think she's the best on-air personality
[3:07:39.800 --> 3:07:45.920]  in front of the camera personally we have in Hawaii tell them who you are I agree to disagree
[3:07:45.920 --> 3:07:53.320]  I'm just I don't know I think I just bring a real opinion I don't know much and I will
[3:07:53.320 --> 3:07:59.240]  say that right now I don't know much but I will say what I guess some of my peers will
[3:07:59.240 --> 3:08:06.160]  act like they know how to say if any of you try to maybe do a quick Google search like
[3:08:06.160 --> 3:08:12.720]  why is she on this show because you'll probably see that I was a big leftist about around
[3:08:12.720 --> 3:08:19.720]  election season I used to lead anti-Trump rallies here in my state I was you name it
[3:08:19.720 --> 3:08:25.840]  pro-abortion pro-feminism to off the wall charts I had the pink pussy you led the anti-Trump
[3:08:25.840 --> 3:08:30.360]  rallies in Hawaii yeah I led anti-Trump rallies and I just want to say that's why I was also
[3:08:30.360 --> 3:08:34.840]  excited to be on the show because people like Alan Jones and the information that I've been
[3:08:34.840 --> 3:08:42.160]  able to learn it really is you know seeing a new light and learning the truth about what's
[3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:48.040]  going on and I I've actually was watching some of the old clips of Alex Jones yesterday
[3:08:48.040 --> 3:08:54.920]  just to kind of refresh my memory and he was saying wow I'm so tired of just the social
[3:08:54.920 --> 3:08:59.800]  manipulation from the media and that's where I came from so and you admit that you were
[3:08:59.800 --> 3:09:02.960]  manipulated so when you watch the left the left show she has a good job of admitting
[3:09:02.960 --> 3:09:07.560]  she was manipulated so the guests that I asked to be on the show today were people that have
[3:09:07.560 --> 3:09:12.800]  the answers to the questions I'm most interested in we have Matt Staver from the Liberty Council
[3:09:12.800 --> 3:09:18.680]  who's representing the pastor in Florida who kept his church open because I have I'm not
[3:09:18.680 --> 3:09:24.480]  a constitutional scholar but when you have the Blasio threatening to shut churches forever
[3:09:24.480 --> 3:09:29.400]  Cuomo using the National Guard to take ventilators from private hospitals and now the World Health
[3:09:29.400 --> 3:09:33.440]  Organization saying they're going to come into our homes and take our family members
[3:09:33.440 --> 3:09:37.400]  something I didn't even imagine three days ago I made a video saying they went to the
[3:09:37.400 --> 3:09:41.280]  hospitals they closed the churches next they're going to come take our food I said that Alex
[3:09:41.280 --> 3:09:45.040]  you show last week I would not have imagined they said they were going to come and take
[3:09:45.040 --> 3:09:49.920]  my children take my wife something I could never have imagined the World Health Organization
[3:09:49.920 --> 3:09:55.640]  said this that's why we're having Matt save Ron to see how can this be constitutional
[3:09:55.640 --> 3:10:01.080]  it can't be and how can we defend ourselves we also have the Benham David David Benham
[3:10:01.080 --> 3:10:08.600]  and the Benham brothers David Benham was lost his reality show with his brother because
[3:10:08.600 --> 3:10:13.320]  of his family's commitment to their Christian values and he's been an outspoken advocate
[3:10:13.320 --> 3:10:18.080]  for life he was just arrested he was just arrested this past Saturday yeah in North
[3:10:18.080 --> 3:10:25.400]  Carolina for praying outside of an abortion clinic supposedly because he was going against
[3:10:25.400 --> 3:10:31.240]  coronavirus orders in his state so we're going to talk to him about what's going on
[3:10:31.240 --> 3:10:34.720]  with that situation when he feels about it and I can't wait to talk to him and we're
[3:10:34.720 --> 3:10:41.480]  also having on a gentleman named Arslan Arslan is lives in the Middle East he's ethnically
[3:10:41.480 --> 3:10:48.040]  he's a Uighur and their country was invaded by China in 1949 East Turkestan and China
[3:10:48.040 --> 3:10:52.480]  has been raised by waging a relentless war of ethnic cleansing and genocide and right
[3:10:52.480 --> 3:10:55.480]  now it may seem unbelievable to you if you haven't heard this before there are three
[3:10:55.480 --> 3:11:01.160]  million Uighur in concentration camps with all their DNA taken and they're using them
[3:11:01.160 --> 3:11:06.920]  as farms for human organs for organs slave labor a lot of the brands and the products
[3:11:06.920 --> 3:11:12.400]  the United States that were made that we use that we consume you and I are made by folks
[3:11:12.400 --> 3:11:17.800]  in these slave camps and he this gentleman Arslan made a video going after social justice
[3:11:17.800 --> 3:11:23.440]  warriors in the West calling Trump a racist for referring to it as the China virus when
[3:11:23.440 --> 3:11:30.560]  meanwhile China has three million ethnic Uighur and other minorities not to mention the persecution
[3:11:30.560 --> 3:11:35.600]  of Christians so we're going to have Arslan calling in all the way from where he's living
[3:11:35.600 --> 3:11:41.480]  now in the Middle East but the first thing I want to address you are intrigued by Q yeah
[3:11:41.480 --> 3:11:49.280]  I'm intrigued that's a good question so neither full blown going to every single drop every
[3:11:49.280 --> 3:11:54.320]  single day but I do get the trickles onto my social media feeds every once in a while
[3:11:54.320 --> 3:12:00.040]  so okay so I've been bombarded by Q advocates after expressing skepticism on Alex's show
[3:12:00.040 --> 3:12:06.720]  last week on this show last week and I want to present to all of you followers of Q and
[3:12:06.720 --> 3:12:12.600]  to you we've talked a lot about here are my simple concerns and on my podcast the Jason
[3:12:12.600 --> 3:12:16.920]  Jones show yesterday I interviewed Q advocates on this and they really couldn't answer it
[3:12:16.920 --> 3:12:21.040]  so you know contact me I'll bring you on if you think you can answer these questions my
[3:12:21.040 --> 3:12:28.800]  number one problem is it's not stick and my second problem is that it encourages good
[3:12:28.800 --> 3:12:34.960]  people friends of mine to engage in Calamity saying horrible things about real people and
[3:12:34.960 --> 3:12:41.280]  so let me explain the first nosticism yeah they use an anonymous source speaking with
[3:12:41.280 --> 3:12:50.120]  ambiguous language opaque language at the communicating statements that cannot be verified
[3:12:50.120 --> 3:12:57.080]  and it cannot be prove you can't prove them or disprove them so that creates an opportunity
[3:12:57.080 --> 3:13:03.360]  for division so then they communicate an ambiguous way from an anonymous source facts statements
[3:13:03.360 --> 3:13:09.920]  that cannot be verified or cannot be refuted about real human beings and they'll say something
[3:13:09.920 --> 3:13:15.520]  about a person that's real and exist that's horrible that is Calamity I wouldn't want
[3:13:15.520 --> 3:13:19.040]  an anonymous source communicating something about me in a way that you couldn't refute
[3:13:19.040 --> 3:13:24.720]  or deny like I do you know do you beat your wife Jason type of things but much much worse
[3:13:24.720 --> 3:13:29.440]  and then my third question for followers of Q is you tell me to trust the plan what's
[3:13:29.440 --> 3:13:35.600]  the plan and how does Q benefit from sharing this information to us because all of my friends
[3:13:35.600 --> 3:13:39.640]  are following Q I don't know what they're doing that's productive for any good I have
[3:13:39.640 --> 3:13:43.480]  friends right now that are feeding here in Hawaii you know about the Kapuna project we've
[3:13:43.480 --> 3:13:50.160]  done five thousand two week supplies of food for folks who are home out in elderly that's
[3:13:50.160 --> 3:13:55.840]  very productive we've got Matt Staver fighting for the Constitution we've got David Benham
[3:13:55.840 --> 3:13:59.760]  out in front of abortion clinics praying we have Arsalan making videos standing up for
[3:13:59.760 --> 3:14:05.400]  the president standing up against the racist regime that is communist China what does Q
[3:14:05.400 --> 3:14:11.200]  give me to defend my Constitution to stand with the vulnerable in my community to preserve
[3:14:11.200 --> 3:14:14.480]  the Constitution for my posterity or to advance the dignity of the child in the womb or the
[3:14:14.480 --> 3:14:19.960]  Uyghur in East Turkistan those are my questions those are actually very valid I've never thought
[3:14:19.960 --> 3:14:28.240]  about it in that way I think most people who follow Q I'll give you an example it's not
[3:14:28.240 --> 3:14:33.560]  kind of much an entertainment aspect but usually when I watch videos it's in the living room
[3:14:33.560 --> 3:14:40.560]  on my big TV with my auntie you're like oh what's going on today if there are Q followers
[3:14:40.560 --> 3:14:46.520]  here you know which video series I'm talking about I was watching the fall cabal basically
[3:14:46.520 --> 3:14:51.720]  what it is you're asking you know what it I just want to break it down for anyone who
[3:14:51.720 --> 3:14:56.600]  just wants to start a base the baseline before we even get to what they say I want to know
[3:14:56.600 --> 3:15:02.400]  how it isn't right how can I trust it right and why would I repeat it if it's talking
[3:15:02.400 --> 3:15:09.920]  about humans that are real if I can't verify it right so I think a common idea for everybody
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:17.320]  and I think this is the basis for what it is if you ask any normal everyday American

[3:20:47.320 --> 3:20:51.200]  nor opaque in my language and you can verify my statements that's true and I was giving
[3:20:51.200 --> 3:20:56.720]  him cryptic code in order for him to understand what I was saying so I understand the word

[3:21:07.240 --> 3:21:12.680]  to go ahead and get him on as soon as we can and Jason yeah my organization movie to movement
[3:21:12.680 --> 3:21:16.720]  we produce films but we also have a project called the vulnerable people project where
[3:21:16.720 --> 3:21:21.680]  we leverage our influence and entertainment and government and politics to stand to defend
[3:21:21.680 --> 3:21:26.440]  the vulnerable from the child in the womb to the Yazidi and Mount Sinjar to the Christians
[3:21:26.440 --> 3:21:31.640]  in Iraq and Syria to the Kurds to the new button Sudan and I always tell my friends
[3:21:31.640 --> 3:21:36.080]  that wherever I go they go that I'm going to bring their voice into any room that I
[3:21:36.080 --> 3:21:42.760]  am and a community I've been working with for several years now is the Uighur the Uighur
[3:21:42.760 --> 3:21:49.320]  most of them live in Chinese occupied East Turkestan are suffering a democide and genocide
[3:21:49.320 --> 3:21:53.520]  like the world hasn't seen since the middle of the 20th century and a couple of weeks
[3:21:53.520 --> 3:22:02.720]  ago I saw a viral video on Instagram of a young man who is a music teacher who is his
[3:22:02.720 --> 3:22:08.320]  not living in his home country but not just thinking about himself every moment of his
[3:22:08.320 --> 3:22:13.480]  life every second is thinking about his family and his friends in his country that is being
[3:22:13.480 --> 3:22:19.280]  dominated in suffering from the persecution of the Chinese Communist Party.
[3:22:19.280 --> 3:22:26.640]  So Arslan welcome to the Alex Jones show you made a courageous video and when viral it's
[3:22:26.640 --> 3:22:30.400]  the first time I've seen you I don't know if you have other videos that have gone viral
[3:22:30.400 --> 3:22:36.320]  where you were defending President Trump you know pointing out the hypocrisy of the Western
[3:22:36.320 --> 3:22:42.240]  media and the social justice warriors calling President Trump racist for referring it to
[3:22:42.240 --> 3:22:51.600]  the China virus when the Trump administration Pence Pompeo and Ambassador Brownback have
[3:22:51.600 --> 3:22:56.400]  been the loudest voices in the world for the Uighur and who are suffering the worst kind
[3:22:56.400 --> 3:23:02.080]  of racist oppression so Arslan welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[3:23:02.080 --> 3:23:07.600]  Thank you for having me Jason. When I was on Alex's show for the first
[3:23:07.600 --> 3:23:13.480]  time just two weeks ago now you messaged me and said you could get me on the show and
[3:23:13.480 --> 3:23:19.920]  I said I'll do my best I don't know and so I'm grateful to give you this opportunity
[3:23:19.920 --> 3:23:25.320]  to share with the world the plight of the Uighur and other people and Christians and
[3:23:25.320 --> 3:23:31.960]  others living in and occupied East Turkestan. I still meet elected officials I meet political
[3:23:31.960 --> 3:23:39.480]  scientists professors at universities even some that I respect that are completely ignorant
[3:23:39.480 --> 3:23:44.480]  of what is happening to the Uighur. Can you tell us what is happening and why is the world
[3:23:44.480 --> 3:23:50.120]  why do so many people in the world not know. Well what's been happening to the Uighurs
[3:23:50.120 --> 3:23:55.480]  has going on for hundreds of years. It's only recently since you've probably seen on the
[3:23:55.480 --> 3:24:01.480]  news the opening of the concentration camps it's been hitting Western media because it's
[3:24:01.480 --> 3:24:07.160]  reminiscent of what happened during World War One during what happened to the Jews.
[3:24:07.160 --> 3:24:12.880]  So this is essentially Holocaust part two. The only difference between Holocaust part
[3:24:12.880 --> 3:24:19.480]  one and this version of the Holocaust is that we are not being exterminated en masse in
[3:24:19.480 --> 3:24:25.240]  gas chambers. That's pretty much the last step on China's mind. Other than that pretty
[3:24:25.240 --> 3:24:33.160]  much pretty much what happened to the Jews seven or eight years ago is what's happening
[3:24:33.160 --> 3:24:40.560]  to us from the making religion and culture abandoned from a social cultural perspective
[3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:46.640]  and then you've got the banning of all religions not just Islam Christianity as you mentioned
[3:24:46.640 --> 3:24:55.120]  Buddhism. You have people being taken arbitrarily into these modern day concentration camps
[3:24:55.120 --> 3:25:01.920]  for the lightest of crimes for practicing religion for speaking your own language for
[3:25:01.920 --> 3:25:09.240]  simply being a Uighur and identifying with the culture. People women are being sterilized.
[3:25:09.240 --> 3:25:16.720]  People are being gang raped regardless of gender. Initially when we had the males taken
[3:25:16.720 --> 3:25:25.800]  in because most of the detainees are males. We've had one point one million Chinese official
[3:25:25.800 --> 3:25:35.080]  men essentially occupy the homes of Uighurs in order to surveil them so that they can
[3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:41.040]  assess their assess what's going on at home. Are they practicing religion? Are they speaking
[3:25:41.040 --> 3:25:47.320]  the Uighur language? Are they teaching their children Uighur culture? Are they abiding or
[3:25:47.320 --> 3:25:53.760]  worshipping Xi Jinping because now you have a thing where you actually you are forced
[3:25:53.760 --> 3:26:00.640]  to place the photograph of just like in any Christian home or Islamic home. You would
[3:26:00.640 --> 3:26:05.640]  have certain things that you would put on your wall. So for example I've been to some
[3:26:05.640 --> 3:26:09.920]  of my friends who are Catholics and they would have the cross on their wall or if you're
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:12.960]  a Muslim you would have certain things that you would hang on your wall things like this
[3:26:12.960 --> 3:26:18.960]  they are all banned and when these men do come in they end up raping the women they end
[3:26:18.960 --> 3:26:24.520]  up and not just women raping children as well. We have heard of situations where 12 13 14
[3:26:24.520 --> 3:26:30.800]  year old girls fall pregnant they end up committing suicide. So I mean there is so much going
[3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:43.760]  on that we couldn't really cover it within just a few minutes. Yeah in your segment.
[3:26:43.760 --> 3:26:48.480]  So I wanted to make sure we got you on. What can people do now we're all the world is suffering
[3:26:48.480 --> 3:26:54.120]  because of the Communist Party of China. This is the 30th anniversary this week of the most
[3:26:54.120 --> 3:26:58.800]  unusual genocide ever where China rounded up every pregnant Uighur woman they could find
[3:26:58.800 --> 3:27:04.520]  it in three days performed hundreds of abortions. What China started doing to its own people
[3:27:04.520 --> 3:27:09.600]  and to occupy people like in East Turkestan the world's suffering now. What do you recommend
[3:27:09.600 --> 3:27:14.520]  for the rest of us to throw off the yoke of this bully evasion out bully of the world.
[3:27:14.520 --> 3:27:19.360]  The Communist Party not the people of China but the Communist Party of China. Exactly.
[3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:25.800]  Well China spent so much money close to a billion dollars trying to save face they spend
[3:27:25.800 --> 3:27:31.560]  so much money on their essentially what they they are not considered state media but they
[3:27:31.560 --> 3:27:36.280]  are essentially state media like the Global Times CGTN People's Daily and they spend
[3:27:36.280 --> 3:27:42.040]  another around 500 million dollars a year on what we call 50 cent social army media.
[3:27:42.040 --> 3:27:47.760]  So it's upon us we have we might be locked in our homes but we all have a smartphone
[3:27:47.760 --> 3:27:55.200]  and we can all raise our concerns on social media retweet share any news on the matter
[3:27:55.200 --> 3:28:01.080]  and essentially I see kind of this Chinese virus as a blessing in disguise because we
[3:28:01.080 --> 3:28:07.080]  have been telling the people around the world. If you do not stop Communist China now this
[3:28:07.080 --> 3:28:13.480]  oppression will come to your ball steps and in a way it has because we have seen how China
[3:28:13.480 --> 3:28:21.960]  has dealt with the Chinese virus keeping it a secret trying to write it down. Yes.
[3:28:21.960 --> 3:28:26.040]  We have 30 seconds left. Did you notice my friend Tian is wearing a Dopa. I wear this
[3:28:26.040 --> 3:28:31.480]  all over town as a conversation starter and it's the traditional hat of the Uighur. How

[3:31:57.520 --> 3:32:04.080]  even though it's 240 years old it's more pertinent and more powerful today than it's ever been.
[3:32:04.080 --> 3:32:11.280]  We look at the huge AI takeover total surveillance of our lives and the theory that comes with
[3:32:11.280 --> 3:32:17.680]  the oppression and it's all linked to not having due process and not having a fourth amendment
[3:32:18.400 --> 3:32:27.040]  against being illegally surveilled. It's all predicated on having no privacy. If we simply
[3:32:27.040 --> 3:32:31.920]  embrace the Bill of Rights a constitution and force that against big tech they would never
[3:32:31.920 --> 3:32:36.880]  get away with this. But because we're not enforcing our Bill of Rights a constitution based in
[3:32:36.880 --> 3:32:43.280]  common sense the bottom is falling out and the sky is just the beginning. It's certainly not the
[3:32:43.280 --> 3:32:48.400]  limit. That's why we're rediscovering what made America great and what the Renaissance is all about.

[3:32:51.760 --> 3:33:01.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:07.920 --> 3:33:13.920]  Welcome back to the show. I'm Jason Jones with my good friend Tiana from left to left show.
[3:33:16.480 --> 3:33:21.360]  So we just had our son as our guest and we have another special guest. It's just rolling
[3:33:21.360 --> 3:33:26.080]  man. I feel like we should have had more time and with this guest as well. I'm pretty sure it's
[3:33:26.080 --> 3:33:30.480]  going to be the same. But let's get right to it so we don't cut into any of his precious time.
[3:33:31.120 --> 3:33:36.640]  Tell us about Matt Staber. Well Matt Staber serves as a senior pastor founder and chairman of
[3:33:36.640 --> 3:33:41.680]  Liberty Council. He's a chairman of Liberty Council action Christians in defense of Israel
[3:33:41.680 --> 3:33:49.440]  Freedom Federation Salt and Light Council and National House of Hope amongst a multitude of
[3:33:49.440 --> 3:33:57.360]  many other organizations. Matt has over 230 published legal opinions. He also authored eight
[3:33:57.360 --> 3:34:03.280]  scholarly law review publications to argue before the Supreme Court. He has filed numerous
[3:34:03.280 --> 3:34:08.720]  briefs and argued in many federal and state courts including the U.S. Supreme Court and has argued
[3:34:08.720 --> 3:34:15.280]  two landmark cases that you know him for. He's actually an old friend and he's taking the lead
[3:34:15.280 --> 3:34:22.640]  in defending churches that when folks want to worship in community which is our right that
[3:34:22.640 --> 3:34:27.920]  existed before our Constitution that was given to us by God is protected by the Constitution.
[3:34:28.640 --> 3:34:33.920]  Matt has been the one guy that's been standing out almost alone. To me I see a lot of conservative
[3:34:33.920 --> 3:34:40.320]  leaders quiet or even turn their back on churches in the Constitution. Matt Staber welcome to the
[3:34:40.320 --> 3:34:47.040]  Alex Jones show. Well thank you. It's good to be with you both. Yeah brother first of all thank you
[3:34:47.040 --> 3:34:52.160]  for standing up with our churches. You know as I'm seeing what's going on in Florida we have the
[3:34:52.160 --> 3:34:58.480]  Blasio a mayor of a city saying he's going to close churches for eternity mosques and synagogues
[3:34:58.480 --> 3:35:04.800]  for eternity the dear worship and community. We have the governor of New York Cuomo saying that he
[3:35:04.800 --> 3:35:10.640]  will use the National Guardry is using the National Guard to take ventilators away from
[3:35:11.920 --> 3:35:17.760]  Republican red counties rural counties to the city of New York the blue Democrat city of New York.
[3:35:18.560 --> 3:35:23.440]  We had the World Health Organization now just yesterday come out and say that they will come
[3:35:23.440 --> 3:35:30.480]  into our homes. Authorities will come into our homes and take our family members. We just had
[3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:36.000]  a gentleman a Uyghur human rights activist on telling us about the abuses that happened in China.
[3:35:36.880 --> 3:35:40.080]  It doesn't sound like it's going to be much different soon here but I thought we had the
[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:46.400]  Constitution at what's going on. What are. Well we do unfortunately even some of my friends that
[3:35:46.400 --> 3:35:51.040]  I would think would think otherwise just seem to think that the Constitution evaporates in a time
[3:35:51.040 --> 3:35:55.280]  of crisis. My goodness that's when you need the Constitution the most it doesn't evaporate. The
[3:35:55.280 --> 3:35:59.120]  only difference that happens is you have a different interest of the government but you don't
[3:35:59.120 --> 3:36:04.240]  wipe out the Constitution. It's not can I just worship shoulder to shoulder and pack them into
[3:36:04.240 --> 3:36:09.840]  a church like sardines and just ignore the health or the other hand do I just shut down the churches
[3:36:09.840 --> 3:36:15.120]  because it's a health crisis. No you have to balance it. So for example in Washington state
[3:36:15.920 --> 3:36:22.640]  the state up until just recently did not even allow the pastors to drive to the church a single
[3:36:22.640 --> 3:36:27.840]  individual to drive to the church to do an online Easter service that just got amended just got
[3:36:27.840 --> 3:36:32.000]  amended. Now they're saying well at least you can drive 10 people to the church and do an online
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:36.560]  service but they said originally when we were working with the pastors there just a few days
[3:36:36.560 --> 3:36:42.240]  ago no you can't do that everyone has to stay home. We are working with a pastor in Louisville
[3:36:42.240 --> 3:36:48.720]  Kentucky. The executive order there with the Democrat governor Beshears allows shopping
[3:36:48.720 --> 3:36:54.320]  malls and libraries and you can do that with no problem but the mayor of Louisville Kentucky
[3:36:54.320 --> 3:37:00.880]  said no parking lot churches for this coming Easter none at all because he says my goodness
[3:37:00.880 --> 3:37:05.920]  you'd have all these people driving on the road well the same people can drive to the home depot
[3:37:05.920 --> 3:37:10.880]  and listen to the car radio or go to the shopping mall and listen to something on the radio no
[3:37:10.880 --> 3:37:16.880]  problem but if that shopping mall or the home depot changed its name to ABC church my goodness
[3:37:16.880 --> 3:37:25.360]  it's off limits now we had just recently video of people in Greenville Mississippi given citations
[3:37:25.360 --> 3:37:31.600]  police officers walking through the parking lot knocking on the doors of the cars giving them a
[3:37:31.600 --> 3:37:38.240]  $500 fine for sitting in their cars with the air recirculating listening to the pastor preach
[3:37:38.240 --> 3:37:47.680]  uh from a distance away they're in their cars and they cited them $500 for doing that I mean
[3:37:47.680 --> 3:37:55.680]  we have a pastor in Virginia who has a group of people he ministers to these are prostitutes
[3:37:55.680 --> 3:38:00.720]  and drug addicts that have turned their life around through the ministry of this church
[3:38:00.720 --> 3:38:09.440]  which they had 16 people spread out in a sanctuary of 200 seats very far spaced these
[3:38:09.440 --> 3:38:12.800]  people don't have driver's license they don't have cell phones they don't have internet
[3:38:13.440 --> 3:38:19.440]  they depend upon the church for food and spiritual support and he got criminally charged he could
[3:38:19.440 --> 3:38:26.000]  face up to a year in prison $2,500 in fines because he had six people six people over
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:32.560]  the Democrat governor Northam's 10 person limit and on the other hand there's some common sense
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:40.720]  that is happening just yesterday Kansas changed the governor's restriction of 10 people the Kansas
[3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:46.080]  Attorney General issued a press statement saying that the 10 person limit to churches violates the
[3:38:46.080 --> 3:38:52.160]  state constitution and so the committee of seven got together and just yesterday overruled the
[3:38:52.160 --> 3:38:57.040]  governor in Florida because of the case that we work on with the man who the pastor who was
[3:38:57.040 --> 3:39:03.280]  arrested wrongfully and by the way the sheriff literally lied and has put this man's life in
[3:39:03.280 --> 3:39:10.480]  danger he lied in terms of what he said and what happened it was absolutely false it's
[3:39:10.480 --> 3:39:16.400]  defamatory but as a result of that case Governor DeSantis has declared churches synagogues and
[3:39:16.400 --> 3:39:22.960]  houses of worship as essential services and essential activity Texas has done something
[3:39:22.960 --> 3:39:31.200]  similar Indiana something similar but we're seeing these unbelievable power grabs by governors and
[3:39:31.200 --> 3:39:37.680]  mayors with the stroke of a pin giving the old thumbs up or thumbs down as to whether you exist
[3:39:37.680 --> 3:39:45.040]  by one word the word essential and unfortunately we have people saying that's okay Matt so this
[3:39:45.040 --> 3:39:50.240]  is a problem I have you know they almost said sue me I don't know if this is legal if if it's not
[3:39:50.240 --> 3:39:56.160]  then sue me it isn't it's bothersome that these elected officials don't even seem to care it's
[3:39:56.160 --> 3:40:01.600]  constitutional so should we not worry about these fines and these tickets are all going to be washed
[3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:06.560]  away when this panic is over my daughter was just cited for hiking with her cousin two miles up in
[3:40:06.560 --> 3:40:12.400]  a mountain alone with her cousin and I told her not to worry about it save it for toilet paper
[3:40:12.400 --> 3:40:16.560]  there's no way this is going to stand should we be confident that this is all going to be washed
[3:40:16.560 --> 3:40:20.640]  away in the courts you know I don't know if you can be confident on that I think that that we can
[3:40:20.640 --> 3:40:24.560]  be confident that many of these things are unconstitutional and unfortunately these things
[3:40:24.560 --> 3:40:31.040]  are going to have to be represented and litigated we have a mom with the whether kids she's on the
[3:40:31.040 --> 3:40:37.280]  beach of Volusia County Florida they're sitting in the water the kids want to make a sandcastle
[3:40:37.280 --> 3:40:42.800]  the police said you can walk on the beach but you can't sit still the kids can't make a sandcastle
[3:40:42.800 --> 3:40:51.280]  I mean how much more are we going to allow this kind of thing to happen and I know having monitored
[3:40:51.280 --> 3:40:58.400]  about a thousand of these executive orders around the country they change hour by hour
[3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:03.280]  they do an executive order and then they do a follow-up amendment oops we forgot something
[3:41:03.280 --> 3:41:07.840]  oops we're going to add this oops we're going to we have only we have less than two minutes
[3:41:07.840 --> 3:41:12.240]  tiana has a question for you and I want people who are planning to worship and community this
[3:41:12.240 --> 3:41:17.920]  this Easter to know how to get ahold of you but quickly your question tiana right so there are
[3:41:17.920 --> 3:41:24.080]  specific instances where you know people are saying you know laymen people who are just at home
[3:41:24.080 --> 3:41:29.920]  saying oh yeah well that makes sense can you shed light on some of the instances that I've read about
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:38.080]  if it's constitutional or not in West Virginia the governor on Tuesday acknowledged that his
[3:41:38.080 --> 3:41:44.000]  directive to have police monitor roads and check in on travelers coming from coronavirus hot spots
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:50.160]  like just like here in Hawaii we're saying you know if people are flying in is it constitutional
[3:41:50.160 --> 3:41:58.160]  that we stop them or and make them turn back or test them or house them and and you know police
[3:41:58.160 --> 3:42:05.280]  escorted ways I'm not too sure what's your take on that I think there's so much on constitutionality
[3:42:05.280 --> 3:42:10.800]  going on right now because so many people governors mayors they're operating as though there is no
[3:42:11.360 --> 3:42:16.320]  check and balance there is no constitution and yet we still have it in fact it's more important
[3:42:16.320 --> 3:42:21.600]  the scarier thing is is that a lot of people think that it's okay that's the thing that's shocking to
[3:42:21.600 --> 3:42:26.720]  me you know and when somebody says well my church can just flip off the lights and go online fine
[3:42:26.720 --> 3:42:33.600]  but you're looking at it from your church maybe you got 20 seconds your organization is needed
[3:42:33.600 --> 3:42:38.400]  now more than ever the Liberty Council how do how do pastors and others reach out to your
[3:42:38.400 --> 3:42:50.240]  organization for help they can go to LC.org LC.org LC.org or they can call 407-875-1776 but LC.org is
[3:42:50.240 --> 3:42:55.520]  the easiest way it's Wednesday morning I was just in a local Austin business that was basically
[3:42:55.520 --> 3:43:01.360]  empty and there were three motorcycle police in there and I said what do you think of this whole
[3:43:01.360 --> 3:43:07.920]  coronavirus thing they're like it looks like it's a hoax and I said yeah you're absolutely right the
[3:43:07.920 --> 3:43:15.040]  way it's been handled is a hoax taking everybody that dies who happens to test positive even if
[3:43:15.040 --> 3:43:21.520]  they die of a heart attack or cancer or diabetes as dying from coronavirus is the big one and then
[3:43:21.520 --> 3:43:26.080]  of course they're also classifying everybody that tests positive for coronavirus period not just
[3:43:26.080 --> 3:43:32.880]  COVID-19 as having it so they're they're upping a number of cases they're upping a number of deaths
[3:43:32.880 --> 3:43:38.000]  but still more people died this week and last week than died from the coronavirus from suicide
[3:43:38.800 --> 3:43:43.840]  so if anything it's causing divorces and suicide and stir craziness and basic insanity and a giant
[3:43:43.840 --> 3:43:48.960]  power grab with big pharma preparing a forced inoculation which they even admit will not protect
[3:43:48.960 --> 3:43:54.160]  you from next year's mutation of the coronavirus I don't need to remind you how four years ago I
[3:43:54.160 --> 3:43:59.520]  told you the polls against Trump were fake he was winning by a giant margin but election fraud
[3:43:59.520 --> 3:44:04.480]  almost stole the election from Trump and the american people well now they're pushing the
[3:44:04.480 --> 3:44:11.520]  idea that oh cancel the republican and democrat conventions maybe cancel the election a year
[3:44:11.520 --> 3:44:18.080]  like the olympics that's because they know trump in every internal scientific poll is 20 points ahead
[3:44:18.080 --> 3:44:24.080]  of the brain damage by so they can say sir you look big like the olympics go ahead and back it off
[3:44:24.080 --> 3:44:29.680]  a year and then you'll still win in a year after you fix the crisis no they need more time to cook
[3:44:29.680 --> 3:44:35.120]  up an assassination an economic collapse a new virus trump needs to say no in america we keep
[3:44:35.120 --> 3:44:40.800]  elections on time have the elections win by a landslide and not give the globalist what they want
[3:44:41.360 --> 3:44:46.720]  hillary biden they all want us to spend the election we shouldn't give them what they want
[3:44:46.720 --> 3:44:50.400]  we need to have a vote in america and reelect trump 2020

[3:45:56.320 --> 3:46:01.760]  scientists have noted increased cancers and other health problems with those who work close
[3:46:01.760 --> 3:46:07.840]  to the devices that's where they're really high powered if you're a quarter mile from a cell tower
[3:46:07.840 --> 3:46:12.800]  there's not any real high powered radiation hitting you but if you're a couple hundred feet away
[3:46:12.800 --> 3:46:18.080]  they got fences around them with skull and crossbones on them for a reason it says it can hurt you
[3:46:18.080 --> 3:46:25.600]  so now with 5g that's even stronger these systems are literally above the streets just 20 or 30 feet
[3:46:25.600 --> 3:46:31.280]  from people's heads from their genitals from their bodies people are burning them down and attacking
[3:46:31.280 --> 3:46:37.440]  them all over the world now i'm saying don't do that use information warfare use the truth
[3:46:37.440 --> 3:46:44.000]  to expose it and sue local governments and others until they remove them that's the way to deal with
[3:46:44.000 --> 3:46:49.840]  this ladies and gentlemen take action in the information war but i gotta tell you i can't
[3:46:49.840 --> 3:46:58.880]  blame the people that are doing it because they're under assault you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:46:58.880 --> 3:47:14.800]  hello and aloha everybody welcome to the last segment of the jason jones no alex jones show
[3:47:15.360 --> 3:47:22.320]  jones joe she does my pie yeah alex jones show well as you've been hearing from my previous segments
[3:47:22.320 --> 3:47:29.200]  it's just sounds like a lot of confusion i'm very worried about what to do about this coronavirus
[3:47:29.200 --> 3:47:36.400]  how to act what to do next and actually during our break i found this book right here um
[3:47:37.760 --> 3:47:45.680]  it's been shameless highly highly regarded by people like patrick Buchanan ted cruz governor
[3:47:45.680 --> 3:47:52.000]  mike huckabee abby johnson i mean everyone is reading this book and i think it will show you
[3:47:52.000 --> 3:47:57.360]  what to do in times of how much i owe you so this is my book and the first person i wanted to get
[3:47:57.360 --> 3:48:04.480]  it to is alex jones for alex but really more obviously for his audience because as an undergraduate
[3:48:05.040 --> 3:48:10.240]  over 20 years ago i was seeing the gen studying the genocides democides and total wars of the 20th
[3:48:10.240 --> 3:48:16.480]  century and i saw that we were going to see a repeat in the 21st so i wanted to know what ideologies
[3:48:16.480 --> 3:48:22.960]  were used to divide us and what principles could unite us and those five principles are simple
[3:48:23.680 --> 3:48:29.440]  the amago day that the christ the person is made and the human person is made in the image of god
[3:48:29.440 --> 3:48:35.840]  and has an inviolable dignity to the transcendent moral order there's a law above the laws of man
[3:48:35.840 --> 3:48:42.240]  three subsidiarity the more distant an institution is away from you the less influence should have
[3:48:42.240 --> 3:48:47.360]  so your family your church your neighborhood local and state government the most influence
[3:48:47.360 --> 3:48:53.040]  the world health organization should have zero influence in your life yet we are all on lockdown
[3:48:53.040 --> 3:48:59.040]  the humane economy grounded grounding our uh social order and the right to private property
[3:48:59.040 --> 3:49:04.800]  you're not taking my ventilator my food or my family out of my house and the fifth one which
[3:49:04.800 --> 3:49:12.560]  is the most important one solidarity which means we share our strengths and our privileges we shoulder
[3:49:12.560 --> 3:49:17.920]  the burdens of the vulnerable and that principle was really introduced to the world tomorrow
[3:49:17.920 --> 3:49:23.200]  on easter this radical solidarity is that christian principle where god becomes man that's you
[3:49:23.840 --> 3:49:28.720]  the amago day the image of god and that's where we get this western understanding of human dignity
[3:49:28.720 --> 3:49:33.840]  which is embedded in our declaration of independence which the constitution was written to protect
[3:49:33.840 --> 3:49:39.920]  solid solidarity is the key principle i've been noticing on twitter lately that everything
[3:49:39.920 --> 3:49:45.600]  trending is divisive everything that's really unusual isn't it it is and is it an accident
[3:49:46.320 --> 3:49:52.880]  no i don't think it's an accident so i'm offering my book free to any al shone's listener if you

[3:50:18.320 --> 3:50:25.440]  there is um i just want to give a quick intro before we start um how you introduced me to him
[3:50:25.440 --> 3:50:33.040]  was the benham brothers as you can see on their website um both of them both of them were professional
[3:50:33.040 --> 3:50:38.880]  baseball players not only on top of that i've read i was reading their entire bio yesterday
[3:50:38.880 --> 3:50:46.320]  they are entrepreneurs on steroids like they take steroids they often fit wow we first well
[3:50:46.320 --> 3:50:51.840]  that's you need david you need to call that lawyer we just had and you know if i took steroids
[3:50:51.840 --> 3:50:58.400]  that's still if i took steroids i'd still be playing baseball well david we want to thank you
[3:50:59.360 --> 3:51:04.400]  we've we've got six minutes left and your bio is huge but you are a personal hero of mine
[3:51:04.400 --> 3:51:09.520]  and i'm not going to be on the alex joneshow without taking an opportunity to defend the most
[3:51:09.520 --> 3:51:15.200]  vulnerable human beings in our country the child in the womb of their mothers who are also vulnerable
[3:51:15.200 --> 3:51:21.040]  and your family your father you and your brother your whole family has been standing for life when
[3:51:21.040 --> 3:51:28.080]  it takes risk david you were just arrested yeah for doing something you've been doing since you
[3:51:28.080 --> 3:51:35.760]  were a baby yeah praying in front of an abortion club yeah it's it's and it's my believe it or
[3:51:35.760 --> 3:51:42.240]  not it's my first arrest i couldn't believe it i mean the thing is i'm sick yeah i'm sipping coffee
[3:51:42.240 --> 3:51:48.080]  with my wife saturday morning and i get a phone call from my attorney that said hey david listen
[3:51:48.080 --> 3:51:52.400]  there there's a lot of police down at the abortion facility saying that they're gonna arrest our
[3:51:52.400 --> 3:51:59.840]  sidewalk counselors now just pause for a second we have a pro-life public charity it's a 501c3
[3:51:59.840 --> 3:52:06.160]  it's well within the essential provisions of the state statute for covid laws not only that are we
[3:52:06.160 --> 3:52:12.480]  in essential business but we uh we've gone above board by saying we're going to do social distancing
[3:52:12.480 --> 3:52:17.440]  we only had three sidewalk counselors there they were 10 feet apart hand sanitizer the whole
[3:52:17.440 --> 3:52:22.960]  nine yards i show up the police come right at me and said you can't be here there's more than 10
[3:52:22.960 --> 3:52:28.720]  people and i'm like what they're only 10 people here of police officers and so they said and i
[3:52:28.720 --> 3:52:34.000]  went back and i said we i have a public chairman of the board of a public uh charity federally
[3:52:34.000 --> 3:52:39.520]  recognized public charity you can't tell me if this abortion facility is open then our ministry
[3:52:39.520 --> 3:52:44.320]  is going to remain open and we're going above that's a brilliant point so your organization
[3:52:44.320 --> 3:52:51.600]  is founded to educate women on the reality of abortion was approved by the irs you were doing
[3:52:52.240 --> 3:52:57.200]  the work of your mission which requires you to be in front of an abortion clinic so the
[3:52:57.200 --> 3:53:02.880]  importance that work inside i guess that's essential but people educating women going
[3:53:02.880 --> 3:53:08.320]  in from the outside is not essential that's a brilliant point yeah and the thing is this is
[3:53:08.320 --> 3:53:14.160]  here's what we're doing uh when those mothers come out even after an abortion where the ones
[3:53:14.160 --> 3:53:17.920]  that are there following up with them we're the ones that are getting the medical assistance
[3:53:17.920 --> 3:53:23.680]  we're the ones plugging them into our life network and our mentor network and having families come
[3:53:23.680 --> 3:53:28.800]  alongside them whether they choose life or not and over five thousand mothers have chosen our
[3:53:28.800 --> 3:53:36.320]  services since 2010 so when the covid laws came out we were we are an accepted approved charity
[3:53:36.320 --> 3:53:41.360]  that can actually administer these services but you know what it's viewpoint discrimination
[3:53:41.360 --> 3:53:46.000]  and the charlotte mecklenburg to police department the city attorney the mayor's office and the
[3:53:46.000 --> 3:53:51.520]  governor's office targeted and they're continuing to target pro-life christians they didn't just do
[3:53:51.520 --> 3:53:57.200]  it in charlotte they did it in greensboro as well and so we are operating not only within our
[3:53:57.200 --> 3:54:03.360]  federally protected organization we are operating even within the covid laws and doing social
[3:54:03.360 --> 3:54:10.080]  distancing so this is clearly a breach of our rights yeah david there's a principle that when
[3:54:10.080 --> 3:54:15.600]  you're in solidarity with the vulnerable you become as vulnerable as they are but i see this as a
[3:54:15.600 --> 3:54:20.640]  stepping stone this obstacle that was placed in front of you to stand up for life has become
[3:54:20.640 --> 3:54:27.040]  a stepping stone just like you you courageously walked away from a reality show career and
[3:54:27.040 --> 3:54:33.120]  there would have been lucrative and life changing but you would rather change the lives of one child
[3:54:33.120 --> 3:54:39.360]  at a time one woman at a time and you sacrifice that you've had a habit of sacrificing things
[3:54:39.360 --> 3:54:44.400]  we've got a um about a minute left with you can you share with do you have any questions
[3:54:45.200 --> 3:54:52.480]  david no i just was listening to a story um i also wanted to note that i thought you know
[3:54:52.480 --> 3:54:57.040]  these abortion clinics they also say oh we want to care and we want to save lives by staying open
[3:54:57.040 --> 3:55:01.360]  but they're doing the exact opposite by hoarding all of their medical supplies and taking lives
[3:55:01.360 --> 3:55:08.480]  instead oh jesus jesus tells us greater love has no one than this that they lay their lives down
[3:55:08.480 --> 3:55:13.360]  for their friends love is what motivates us it's not the narrative that the media puts out there
[3:55:13.360 --> 3:55:17.760]  that we hate women and all these other things it is love that motivates us and hopefully love that
[3:55:17.760 --> 3:55:24.640]  compels us to be a voice for the most vulnerable among us and and david you and your family have
[3:55:24.640 --> 3:55:31.120]  loved and love requires cost if you love up until cost you've never let it cost and then walk away
[3:55:31.120 --> 3:55:36.240]  you've never loved at all thank you for uh living a life in solidarity with the most vulnerable in the
