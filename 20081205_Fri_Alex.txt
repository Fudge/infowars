[01:03.320 --> 01:08.640]  going to be discussing in studio though particularly what his whole analysis on the Mubai
[01:08.640 --> 01:16.880]  formerly Bombay attacks in the financial center of India and the clear false flag evidence there

[01:56.400 --> 02:01.640]  have been talking about this for decades but scientists said don't use that type of plastic
[02:01.640 --> 02:08.560]  back in the 50s because it would sterilize not just mammals but amphibians reptiles and that's
[02:08.560 --> 02:13.920]  exactly why they put it in the plastic and then now it's finally breaking major news so we'll talk
[02:13.920 --> 02:18.040]  about it because what's old to us is new to the public public doesn't believe anything till the
[02:18.040 --> 02:24.280]  mainstream media finally has to admit it so we'll be discussing that coming up today trying to
[02:24.280 --> 02:28.320]  get people to consciously become aware of what's happening myself included even though I know all
[02:28.320 --> 02:35.280]  this stuff I still slip up a lot and drink fluoridated water or eat and drink out of that type
[02:35.280 --> 02:41.400]  of plastic that's widely used I still eat some GMO food to my detriment and I'm really trying to
[02:41.400 --> 02:47.280]  focus myself and others I'm not using cell phones as much not having them around my children that's
[02:47.280 --> 02:54.320]  radiating your brain massive studies on that giving you brain tumors and a lot more so we'll
[02:54.320 --> 03:04.320]  be discussing that I'm gonna blitz through the news in the next segment the Rocky Mountain news
[03:04.320 --> 03:11.200]  is on the verge of going bankrupt if they're not sold they're saying 30 plus major papers
[03:11.200 --> 03:16.320]  including the Austin American States from where I live around for 150 something years it's on the
[03:16.320 --> 03:23.880]  verge of well-being sold and then financial trouble and this is a perfect storm of the mainstream
[03:23.880 --> 03:28.640]  media being discredited the internet most people getting their news from the web and not the
[03:28.640 --> 03:42.720]  horse and buggy pulp papers the wood pulp papers and it's also that the economy itself is imploding
[03:42.720 --> 03:46.680]  and so there's less ad revenue at a time when newspapers most of them were already hanging
[03:46.680 --> 03:53.320]  on by their fingernails on the cliff over the abyss of bankruptcy and extinction like the
[03:53.320 --> 03:58.600]  great dinosaurs you know I'm not really happy about the newspapers going bankrupt and being
[03:58.600 --> 04:03.600]  sold and being downsized everywhere because as bad as they are with corporate propaganda you
[04:03.600 --> 04:08.000]  still get some local news out of them and the some of the multinational conglomerates are
[04:08.000 --> 04:15.120]  actually hailing all of this and cheerleading the fact praising the fact this is happening for
[04:15.120 --> 04:20.680]  further consolidation and vertical integration you've got about what six families own over 90
[04:20.680 --> 04:26.680]  percent of the newspapers in this country four conglomerates own over 90 percent of the TV cable
[04:26.680 --> 04:33.040]  and film production and you're only gonna see a greater consolidation of that as well as the
[04:33.040 --> 04:41.160]  government comes in worldwide governments worldwide in unison restrict the first amendment on the
[04:41.160 --> 04:46.640]  web so don't hail the death of the newspapers because the death of the net the free web is
[04:46.640 --> 04:53.680]  also ongoing it's already begun the websites are present planet dot com info wars dot com info wars

[05:08.040 --> 05:12.760]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have
[05:12.760 --> 05:16.880]  your own bread you'll never have to go to the super dough and beg for female to take care of your
[05:16.880 --> 05:21.720]  family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy
[05:21.720 --> 05:26.160]  bailout for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the
[05:26.160 --> 05:30.520]  telephones and email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out
[05:30.520 --> 05:35.680]  of thin air this money now owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now
[05:35.680 --> 05:40.920]  guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly
[05:40.920 --> 05:46.480]  food beyond many americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread

[05:52.480 --> 05:57.120]  there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are
[05:57.120 --> 06:01.600]  refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[06:01.600 --> 06:06.560]  but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be
[06:06.560 --> 06:11.280]  ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of americans have to choose between buying food
[06:11.280 --> 06:16.240]  and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient

[07:45.920 --> 07:51.920]  up in the next segment about the move by situation obama and a lot more the supreme court is
[07:51.920 --> 07:58.160]  privately having a hearing amongst themselves today to decide on whether they are going to go
[07:58.160 --> 08:05.280]  forward with a court case dealing with barrage obama was he really born in kenya or hawaii
[08:06.160 --> 08:13.040]  as his mother claims why won't they release the original copy instead of a receipt of live birth
[08:13.040 --> 08:23.360]  so we're going to be watching that as it develops as well in the news today again as i mentioned
[08:23.360 --> 08:28.800]  will supreme court take on obama's citizenship the u.s supreme court will consider today whether
[08:28.800 --> 08:33.360]  to take up a lawsuit challenging president elect barack obama's u.s citizenship and can
[08:34.320 --> 08:40.160]  continuation of a new jersey case embraced by some opponents of obama's election the meaning of
[08:40.160 --> 08:47.760]  justices will coincide with a vigil by the filer supporters in washington on the steps of the
[08:47.760 --> 08:53.520]  nation's highest court the suit originally sought to stay the election and was filed on behalf of
[08:54.080 --> 08:59.600]  leo dawnfrio against new jersey secretary of state nina michael wells legal experts say the
[08:59.600 --> 09:04.160]  appeal has little chance of succeeding despite appearing on the court's schedule legal record
[09:04.160 --> 09:07.840]  show it is only the tip of the iceberg of nationwide effort seeking to derail obama's
[09:07.840 --> 09:11.520]  election over accusations that he has neither was born in the u.s citizen or that he later
[09:11.520 --> 09:16.800]  renounced his citizenship in indonesia i personally think this is going nowhere the
[09:16.800 --> 09:21.280]  establishment is fully behind obama both the democratic and republican parties
[09:22.320 --> 09:30.640]  and uh but we will certainly see what happens there golf oil ceo says gas could hit one dollar
[09:30.640 --> 09:39.040]  a gallon by next year golf oil ceo joe patrosky said on wednesday that the price of oil could
[09:39.040 --> 09:44.160]  sink to twenty dollars per barrel and there was a chance gasoline prices could drop as low as one
[09:44.160 --> 09:50.320]  dollar per gallon by early next year speaking at the south score chamber of commerce breakfast
[09:52.640 --> 09:57.520]  the brockton native said that after speculators drove all prices up there's a chance that the
[09:57.520 --> 10:02.800]  market will overshoot on the way back down resulting in much lower prices at the pump
[10:02.800 --> 10:08.240]  only about 30 percent of oil price increases up to a hundred dollars a barrel five months ago six
[10:08.240 --> 10:14.480]  months ago was speculation the rest was dollar devaluation there has been a global currency
[10:14.480 --> 10:21.360]  devaluation in the last six months not just the dollar being devalued but all major currencies
[10:21.360 --> 10:27.280]  were devalued the imf and world bank haunt showed that and so you've had all currencies dropping
[10:27.280 --> 10:34.160]  that's why it's appeared that the dollar has stayed it's freefall uh in reality again they are all
[10:34.160 --> 10:40.560]  dropping milwalking neighborhoods could print their own money the chicago firm reports two
[10:40.560 --> 10:47.040]  neighborhoods considered printing own currency for exclusive use in local stores and it goes into
[10:47.040 --> 10:51.680]  the fact that the barter system is now being looked at residents from a walking neighborhoods
[10:51.680 --> 10:56.560]  on river west and east side are scheduling to meet to discuss printing their own money the
[10:56.560 --> 11:00.640]  the idea is that the local cash could be used in neighborhood stores and businesses thus encouraging
[11:00.640 --> 11:05.520]  local spending the result supporters hope would be a bustling local economy even as the rest of
[11:05.520 --> 11:10.240]  the nation deals with recession i think that's beautiful and the feds can't stop that uh if
[11:10.240 --> 11:15.200]  can give neighborhoods and then towns and then cities and then regions and states again doing
[11:15.200 --> 11:20.080]  this this was uh very popular in europe still popular in some areas of europe very popular in
[11:20.080 --> 11:26.080]  this nation's founding and before its founding and uh has been basically extincted by the foreign
[11:26.080 --> 11:32.720]  banking cartel the money changers uh really important news canadian prime minister wins
[11:32.720 --> 11:39.920]  suspension of parliament this is out of reuters today it's up on info wars dot com prison
[11:39.920 --> 11:45.680]  planet dot com we have a link to it if you want to find it and buried in the article is the key
[11:46.560 --> 11:50.160]  every time i get up on air and say that australia canada
[11:50.160 --> 11:59.040]  canada scotland and 20 plus other commonwealth nations are owned and run by the queen canadians
[11:59.040 --> 12:03.200]  australians send me emails and laugh at me or go on the message board at prison planet dot
[12:03.200 --> 12:07.760]  com and say i'm a liar because they don't even know how their own form of government works
[12:07.760 --> 12:21.920]  your parliaments are ceremonial and anytime the witch wants to suspend the parliament
[12:21.920 --> 12:28.080]  she can do that and i've studied the british government now in 1215 that for a while uh there
[12:28.080 --> 12:38.160]  was of course some liberty uh by the middle class and a a a a balancing towards freedom and uh in
[12:38.160 --> 12:43.440]  the last 400 years there were some periods where the parliament in england did have the power
[12:44.400 --> 12:49.280]  those were times when they seized the king and chopped his head off that happened several times
[12:49.280 --> 12:58.320]  or imprisoned the king or queen uh but uh in the last 200 years uh the the the monarchy has been in
[12:58.320 --> 13:07.520]  full control and the queen owns most the oil most the timber most the gold most the diamonds
[13:07.520 --> 13:11.760]  and the natural resources of course this is all done illegally through fraud but they
[13:12.480 --> 13:18.240]  they love to advertise that they have no power that they're a bunch of boobies uh in a bunch of
[13:18.240 --> 13:25.120]  maroons uh who can't get anything done and have to have their noses wiped uh for them
[13:27.360 --> 13:33.680]  but if you read this article the parliament was moving to remove
[13:36.720 --> 13:44.160]  steven harper the canadian prime minister and the queen stepped in because she likes what he's
[13:44.160 --> 13:52.160]  doing and has frozen the parliament and if you read the legalese it has been dissolved now she may
[13:52.160 --> 13:58.080]  reconfigure the parliament and i would challenge canadians that aren't aware of how their government
[13:58.080 --> 14:05.520]  works everyone serves at the queen's pleasure if the ceremonial parliament does what she wants
[14:06.560 --> 14:11.120]  then she stands down she's not just on your money there's not just crowns and all your
[14:11.120 --> 14:15.360]  highway signs when you're over in england no matter where you're at in england routinely in every
[14:15.360 --> 14:20.640]  major town they will just shut down large parts of the city roads and tell you that it is the queen's
[14:20.640 --> 14:27.200]  pleasure if she wants to boat up and down the the tames she will shut it down and make thousands of
[14:27.200 --> 14:32.240]  international ships and billions of dollars free sometimes for weeks she does what she wants
[14:32.240 --> 14:37.040]  when she wants last time i was in england uh they shut down large parts of the city
[14:37.040 --> 14:41.920]  and they would announce on uh you know the loudspeakers and on the tour buses that her majesty
[14:41.920 --> 14:46.160]  has chosen to shut down part of the city today that is part of an exercise of power
[14:48.240 --> 14:52.960]  you know the queen doesn't want billboards up nationwide in england so they're not so there
[14:52.960 --> 15:00.000]  are no billboards outside the cities it's all about an exercise of power but this is not advertised
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.320]  it's not put out in the media very often but on the ground floor they let everybody know
[15:04.320 --> 15:10.400]  the entire british parliament is spied on by the illegitimate
[15:11.440 --> 15:16.560]  mi5 mi6 that serves under the direction of her majesty
[15:18.800 --> 15:23.440]  and that's why the queen through the executive powers that are again totally illegitimate
[15:23.440 --> 15:28.160]  hitler had total power but was illegitimate has been ordering government ministers arrested
[15:28.160 --> 15:33.440]  under terrorism charges for exposing government corruption so so we're seeing tyranny not just
[15:33.440 --> 15:38.000]  in england but in the united states and worldwide here in the united states the president the executive
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.560]  acts as a king now and you're hearing them say the governors are now federal officers serving at
[15:42.560 --> 15:46.720]  the pleasure of the president they can put troops tens of thousands on the streets they are going to
[15:46.720 --> 15:54.800]  do it but but here is roiders for those that are ignorant canadian prime minister wins suspension
[15:54.800 --> 16:01.920]  of parliament suspension of parliament and she can expel it as well canadian prime ministers
[16:01.920 --> 16:06.720]  even harbour want a rare suspension of parliament on thursday managing to avoid being ousted by
[16:06.720 --> 16:10.800]  opposition party anger over the minority conservative government's economic plans
[16:10.800 --> 16:17.760]  and an attempt to cut off party financing governor general michelle gene governor general
[16:17.760 --> 16:22.800]  now that's the we're under a governor general under north com that serves at the discretion of
[16:22.800 --> 16:28.160]  the executive same thing that's and i keep telling canadians and others it's that your governor
[16:28.160 --> 16:35.040]  generals you're in a commonwealth just like we have the 1776 war here that started in 1775
[16:35.760 --> 16:41.360]  when the governor general came in and started removing governors appointing puppet governors
[16:41.360 --> 16:46.240]  removing legislatures putting in puppet legislatures removing judges and magistrates putting in
[16:46.240 --> 16:52.720]  puppets this is how imperial rule works face where you live face what you're under and then you can
[16:52.720 --> 17:00.400]  take your country's back but as long as you continue to live in denial we can't change anything roiders
[17:01.600 --> 17:05.600]  governor general michelle gene representative queen elizabeth canada's head of state
[17:06.160 --> 17:12.320]  see queen elizabeth canada's head of state he didn't harper agreed to harper's request to shut
[17:12.320 --> 17:18.400]  down parliament until january 26 parliament was reconvened just weeks ago at the october 14th
[17:18.400 --> 17:23.680]  election harper's request for suspension was unprecedented no prime minister had asked for
[17:23.680 --> 17:27.760]  parliament to be suspended to avoid a confidence vote in the house of commons let's see that power
[17:27.760 --> 17:32.800]  is always there if the little puppets don't don't don't do what they're told if the ceremonial
[17:33.360 --> 17:39.200]  legislatures and parliaments in congress what happened seven weeks ago congress did a no vote
[17:40.160 --> 17:44.880]  on giving the bankers unlimited total power to steal all the money they want with no review
[17:44.880 --> 17:51.920]  that was in there we read the bill and so the banker representative of the private bank of england
[17:51.920 --> 17:56.000]  via the federal reserve a local governorship the governor general of the banking elite
[17:56.000 --> 18:01.760]  Bernanke went in there with his puppet paulson and said and senator and hops on record now
[18:03.040 --> 18:08.160]  and said marshal law will be declared and and we'll just do it without you if you don't do this
[18:08.160 --> 18:16.320]  and they said okay under pdd 51 now again you're not hearing about this in the news this is why
[18:16.320 --> 18:20.720]  we're under marshal law we're already under marshal law the government is illegitimate
[18:21.280 --> 18:26.480]  but they want to fool people with oh we got a brown face up there this puppet he'll he'll fix it
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.320]  it's a bait and switch it's a new paint job on the same new world order machine

[23:00.640 --> 23:05.360]  to be talking about what really happened with the mu buy attacks all the evidence of false flag
[23:05.360 --> 23:08.880]  there with western intelligence trying to get the two nations fighting with each other we're

[23:25.760 --> 23:31.120]  tarply in studio but he was listening out in the green room during the break when i was covering
[23:31.120 --> 23:35.120]  canadian prime minister when suspension of parliament and we just went live at prison
[23:35.120 --> 23:40.800]  planet dot tv so i'll recap that for the viewers out there canadian prime minister when suspension
[23:40.800 --> 23:44.240]  of parliament and it says governor general michelle gene the representative of the queen
[23:44.240 --> 23:51.360]  elizabeth canada's head of state agreed to harper's request to shut down parliament until january 26
[23:51.360 --> 23:55.600]  parliament was reconvened just weeks ago after october 14th election now he lost control the
[23:55.600 --> 24:00.080]  government became the minority party but was refusing to allow elections within parliament
[24:00.640 --> 24:07.040]  to have a new prime minister seated that's our parliamentary systems work our country was much
[24:07.040 --> 24:14.080]  more similar to this until 1913 with the 17th amendment when states legislators stopped appointing
[24:14.080 --> 24:20.480]  senators that was their trump with states rights over total federalism but but this is imperium
[24:20.480 --> 24:25.520]  here because she is the head of state and canadians and australians and others in the 20 plus common
[24:25.520 --> 24:30.160]  wealth nations always say oh well that's just a figurative that's just ceremonial her as the
[24:30.160 --> 24:35.360]  head of state no no no if you read the charters of these commonwealths it is the parliaments that
[24:35.360 --> 24:41.680]  are ceremonial and it is the queen's governorship or through her governors there's actually the power
[24:41.680 --> 24:48.800]  so there it is in reuters and every time i mention these reports people just don't believe me and
[24:48.800 --> 24:52.800]  webster tarpleys written books on the british imperium written many articles on it in its form
[24:52.800 --> 24:56.320]  of government so in the time we have left in this limited segment webster i would love to
[24:56.960 --> 25:01.920]  well first off welcome you to the studio but then also give you a chance you bet give you a chance
[25:01.920 --> 25:06.000]  to break down the article thank you very much alex thank you thank you for inviting me it's
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.360]  wonderful to be here and congratulations to you for everything that you're doing this is the
[25:11.360 --> 25:15.600]  first i've heard of this they were supposed to be a vote of no confidence against harper by the
[25:15.600 --> 25:22.560]  by the parliament now remember under the canadian and indeed british commonwealth system the queen
[25:22.560 --> 25:28.000]  is the head of state of all of these places and it's about 70 countries it's a huge group
[25:28.640 --> 25:34.800]  and in the case of canada and australia we have these royal governors general and the royal governor
[25:34.800 --> 25:41.680]  general is the guy who's just done this this guy governor general michelle john so he's the
[25:41.680 --> 25:47.520]  personal representative of the queen and you can see that he has more power than the parliament and
[25:47.520 --> 25:53.120]  the uh... and the prime minister meaning that we had this this agitation in canada in the 1960s
[25:53.120 --> 25:58.720]  and 70s saying that the the constitution had to be repatriated right they wanted to bring the
[25:58.720 --> 26:05.120]  constitution home to canada and uh... it turns out that was not done uh... i would say for people
[26:05.120 --> 26:08.960]  who have trouble with this concept there are two two examples you can see that the queen actually
[26:08.960 --> 26:13.840]  runs the show one is in the canadian nafta debate in other words to get the north american free
[26:13.840 --> 26:21.120]  trade agreement passed the queen named new senators to the canadian senate to to stack it right to
[26:21.120 --> 26:26.640]  pack it to make sure that there was no supposedly gonna be elected but as soon as they didn't know
[26:26.640 --> 26:30.960]  the way she wanted she came in packed it yeah right and then the other one is maybe even more
[26:30.960 --> 26:37.280]  spectacular in australia gao wittlem about 1975 was the prime minister of australia and he said
[26:37.280 --> 26:42.880]  look there's an oil crisis i'm gonna make direct deals with arab oil producers oil for technology
[26:42.880 --> 26:47.200]  australia will produce technology for them will get our oil guaranteed and london in new york
[26:47.200 --> 26:52.560]  said no and at that point the governor general of australia intervened to overthrow wittlem
[26:52.560 --> 26:58.080]  and impose malcolm fraser and it was a complicated thing because the the australian parliament
[26:58.080 --> 27:04.000]  immediately voted no confidence in the new puppet or a fraser and try to get wittlem back and there
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.600]  was a period of about six months of of tremendous chaos who won that fight uh... the queen again
[27:09.600 --> 27:13.600]  because you see what the queen represent the queen is not she's not somebody like starlin and
[27:13.600 --> 27:18.640]  but she doesn't have all power but she represents the oligarchy as a whole in other words she's
[27:18.640 --> 27:24.400]  the spokesperson she's the doge if you like of the dogeressa but she does have starlin s she just
[27:24.400 --> 27:30.080]  doesn't want to use the power because then that reveals that these parliaments are really ceremonial
[27:30.080 --> 27:34.880]  but there's still danger within the ceremonial parliaments because they truly have been voted in
[27:34.880 --> 27:41.360]  so they hold the true organic rightful power and then could rally the people with their bully pulpit
[27:41.360 --> 27:47.120]  to throw out the oligarchy right and the question of rallying the people is the absolutely critical
[27:47.120 --> 27:50.800]  thing because if you don't rally the people then the oligarchs are going to run wild and we see
[27:50.800 --> 27:56.240]  that they're running wild it also shows that that the entire anglo-american world is now descending
[27:56.240 --> 28:02.240]  into a form of of chaos emergency rule because they're having to now take the veil off the velvet
[28:02.240 --> 28:07.040]  glove off the iron fist and really show people the true machinery just like here in the us they're
[28:07.040 --> 28:11.040]  announcing yes we're going to use regular army against the people yes the governors are now
[28:11.040 --> 28:15.440]  puppets of the president yes you're living under martial law they're throwing the gauntlet down
[28:15.440 --> 28:20.480]  webster target let's finish up with this riveting information when we get back and then get into

[30:52.800 --> 30:58.080]  being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water we'll snap out of it we now have a
[30:58.080 --> 31:04.160]  deadline joe biden said it's going to happen former secretary of state colin powell went on cbs meet
[31:04.160 --> 31:09.280]  the press and pointed to about january 22nd is the time a major international incident would
[31:09.280 --> 31:15.040]  force the new president to make unpopular decisions while i take the generalities word my best
[31:15.040 --> 31:20.400]  advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration contact e-foods direct
[31:20.400 --> 31:25.920]  dot com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster ask yourself is it better to have

[31:56.640 --> 32:05.120]  now england and 20 plus other commonwealth nations are truly governed by the queen as the head of
[32:05.120 --> 32:11.760]  state her governor generals control the bureaucracy they control the intelligence agencies they push
[32:11.760 --> 32:16.960]  through all of the attacks on the internet free speech in canada it is the governor general if
[32:16.960 --> 32:21.200]  you read deeply into the last six months they're saying we're only gonna let you have a few thousand
[32:21.200 --> 32:26.880]  websites you can visit they've all got to be certified we're talking chinese communist level
[32:26.880 --> 32:33.360]  censorship or even greater china allows millions of sites to be visited and restricts millions
[32:33.360 --> 32:38.720]  canada is talking about just a few thousand and it's not being done even by law they're the regulators
[32:38.720 --> 32:42.800]  because again the governor general controls the commerce and the parliament doesn't do what they
[32:42.800 --> 32:47.440]  want they just remove them as they've just done they suspend them or expel them and that'll be the
[32:47.440 --> 32:52.640]  next move if they don't play ball as they as you talked about them winning a fight decades ago in
[32:52.640 --> 32:58.320]  australia similarly and so that's why you see australia announcing what two weeks ago that they
[32:58.320 --> 33:03.280]  are going to only have a few thousand websites that you can visit headlines you know web to have
[33:03.280 --> 33:09.440]  chinese style censorship in australia google that hundreds of headlines and the news was saying this
[33:09.440 --> 33:14.000]  is good you know because obviously they're the mainstream media they also want to team up
[33:14.000 --> 33:18.560]  you like for like with the establishment to restrict the burgeoning exploding alternative
[33:18.560 --> 33:22.560]  media now here in the united states as webster was just saying they're trying to bring in a
[33:22.560 --> 33:28.960]  similar system of total executive power dictatorial power over the states over the congress threatening
[33:28.960 --> 33:35.280]  them with marshal law north com trips on the streets the question is uh... from the onset of
[33:35.280 --> 33:41.040]  this nation in seventeen seventy six that was a rebellion as i said earlier against the very same
[33:41.040 --> 33:46.240]  sex coberg gothers the very same german family uh... that uh... had just been in for two generations
[33:46.240 --> 33:52.080]  by then in england uh... uh... uh... you know king george the third uh... removing governors
[33:52.080 --> 33:58.080]  removing legislators appointing governor generals uh... bringing back in uh... uh... this type of
[33:58.080 --> 34:03.200]  system and we had a war over it because uh... the british soldiers were coming to then disarm the
[34:03.200 --> 34:09.920]  people and to put troops on the streets of the thirteen colonies so same families same players
[34:09.920 --> 34:14.560]  same nations same groups those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it
[34:14.560 --> 34:18.320]  and and that's why it's so important to study history and and and now in canada
[34:18.960 --> 34:23.360]  she just says you know what parliament you're no longer in authority i'm keeping steven harper
[34:23.360 --> 34:28.960]  and power because he's on showing the north american union he's on showing uh... letting the banks
[34:28.960 --> 34:33.600]  loot canada and changing the rules he is going along with all that and webster tarpoli is just an
[34:33.600 --> 34:38.640]  amazing historian in written papers and books on the subject so so webster uh... i want to get
[34:38.640 --> 34:44.720]  into move by but but let's get back into this and flesh it all out because this is so so vitally
[34:44.720 --> 34:50.560]  important well i would say the the only adequate answer to what the queen and her governor general
[34:50.560 --> 34:55.280]  have done would be a nationwide open-ended general strike saying bring the parliament back together
[34:55.280 --> 35:00.640]  and let them vote and we don't accept dictation from from london or anyplace else but as soon as
[35:00.640 --> 35:04.800]  you say that you see the predicament of the anglo-american world in none of these countries
[35:04.800 --> 35:08.960]  do we have uh... organizations that would be interested in mass struggle
[35:08.960 --> 35:13.120]  or even capable of conducting a mass struggle and that's due to the propaganda through the media
[35:13.120 --> 35:17.760]  well it's due to the atomization i mean political parties used to exist they're largely gone they
[35:17.760 --> 35:22.320]  largely exist on television they don't have organization it's infiltration it's infiltration
[35:22.320 --> 35:28.080]  of the labor unions the media everything has been has been commandeered right but that's the the
[35:28.080 --> 35:34.160]  question now for all of us is uh... we we've got to find ways to create new institutions and that
[35:34.160 --> 35:36.560]  means institutions i mean it means
[35:36.560 --> 35:40.400]  at ultimately the end of this you know offices in cities right if you had a
[35:40.400 --> 35:44.880]  if you had an organization with offices in five hundred or a thousand american cities let's say
[35:44.880 --> 35:49.680]  you could mount a protest against the things that obama is going to be doing i mean we've got
[35:49.680 --> 35:55.440]  to look ahead now to this period of uh... the twentieth of january the inauguration
[35:55.440 --> 35:59.920]  till about may first i want to do that the hundred days to find i want to put bookends
[35:59.920 --> 36:06.320]  on the discussion of the shadow government round table group governor general uh... you know
[36:06.320 --> 36:12.240]  maritime or administrative law system that the british and perium uh... the anglo-american
[36:12.240 --> 36:17.520]  establishment is using finish up breaking down how the shadow government operates on the common
[36:17.520 --> 36:23.600]  wealths how they're trying to executive to set one up here and across europe again and and and
[36:23.600 --> 36:28.480]  finish up because that's key how they're doing this because they're under attack they're losing their
[36:28.480 --> 36:33.600]  power uh... you know they have uh... you know gotten into a crisis and and then let's get into
[36:33.600 --> 36:38.880]  mubai and then into obama just in terms of the british system the british system is a copy of
[36:38.880 --> 36:45.120]  the venetian system the british monarch is the doge or in this case the female doge of the entire
[36:45.120 --> 36:49.920]  oligarchy and this was copied the french model of a monarchy is a little bit different right
[36:49.920 --> 36:55.520]  something like louis louis the fourteenth that's absolutism and that's that's a step beyond although
[36:55.520 --> 37:00.800]  that also has positive features that the divine right of kings yeah pretty much and that was tried
[37:00.800 --> 37:04.960]  in england that was tried by uh... by james the first and charles the first and as you mentioned
[37:04.960 --> 37:10.640]  before charles the first got his head cut off back in about sixteen forty and since then
[37:10.640 --> 37:16.320]  you've had these things the rise of the wig party the the english week party of the great
[37:16.320 --> 37:22.720]  nobility who are about equal to the king and the king or the monarch becomes a spokesperson
[37:22.720 --> 37:28.720]  for that group so the british model is the monarch expresses the collective will
[37:28.720 --> 37:33.200]  of the oligarchy now there have been time they only seated power because of twelve fifteen
[37:33.200 --> 37:37.840]  and then other struggles in sixteen forty when they found that the middle class the upper middle
[37:37.840 --> 37:43.840]  class uh... the gentry uh... continue to overthrow uh... the monarchy so the two interbred and combined
[37:43.840 --> 37:49.280]  forces yeah well the outcome of all that process and it's a complicated one is that that by uh...
[37:49.280 --> 37:53.920]  well by sixteen eighty eight right by the so-called glorious revolution you have the oligarchy
[37:53.920 --> 37:59.600]  in england putting in william of orange right william and mary and that's a that's a venetian
[37:59.600 --> 38:04.960]  doge system with the oligarchy picks the king gets rid of one king right gets rid of james the second
[38:04.960 --> 38:10.000]  brings in uh... william and mary and from about sixteen eighty eight to eighteen thirty two you've
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.640]  got this perfect oligarchy and it's gotten you know they've had some rocky time since the one
[38:14.640 --> 38:20.480]  example that you want to point to king edward the seventh is an example of somebody who really did
[38:20.480 --> 38:26.000]  uh... combine in himself this kind of uh... power because he had been the prince of wales
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.280]  under queen victoria so that meant he had about fifty or sixty years where the mother was the queen
[38:31.280 --> 38:37.200]  he called he called her my eternal mother she never she never decided to leave the scene
[38:37.200 --> 38:42.400]  so the prince of wales edward the seventh created this unparalleled network and he created the
[38:42.400 --> 38:47.200]  alliance system that brought on world war one in which if you wanted to say one person
[38:47.200 --> 38:53.200]  who did most to cause world war one that would be king edward the seventh because he created this
[38:53.200 --> 38:59.600]  triple on taunt right to crush germany between russia france and the british and even he detached
[38:59.600 --> 39:05.280]  italy from the uh... from the german austrian coalition so this is a very very evil institution
[39:05.280 --> 39:10.320]  and it would be with the british monarchy you're getting very close to the to the heart of of power
[39:10.320 --> 39:15.600]  in the world uh... again not not so much that the queen embodies this power in herself
[39:15.600 --> 39:21.280]  but that she represents the city of london the court the foreign office the worldwide networks
[39:21.280 --> 39:26.880]  the commonwealth right the royal bank is the spokesperson yeah and she's the delegated you
[39:26.880 --> 39:32.480]  know she's the uh... the chairman of the board maybe and also spokesperson as the same thing
[39:32.480 --> 39:37.600]  in the netherlands uh... with the queen there as well who are also intermarried uh... you know
[39:37.600 --> 39:42.640]  into that same family right and that's the the the monument to that is this tremendous conglomerate
[39:42.640 --> 39:49.200]  royal dutch shell which really is it's anglo dutch and this is the the heart of the world
[39:49.200 --> 39:54.320]  is fifty percent uh... dutch right and there we had uh... somebody like sir henry deaderding in
[39:54.320 --> 39:58.080]  the nineteen twenties and thirties it was a big supporter of hitler and that went back to three
[39:58.080 --> 40:02.800]  hundred years previously when they merged the dutch east india with the british east india
[40:02.800 --> 40:06.640]  right and the sixteen eighty eight that i just mentioned and it's bringing in william of orange
[40:06.640 --> 40:11.440]  and there was william the the the the the king of holland the stat holder of king or whatever they
[40:11.440 --> 40:15.680]  called him to bring him in and also become king of king of india and he was brought in out of germany
[40:15.680 --> 40:19.760]  and then go against uh... louis the fourteenth there's a question and i've studied this quite a
[40:19.760 --> 40:23.920]  bit but you probably know more obviously uh... was it just there have been so much interbreeding
[40:23.920 --> 40:28.720]  with the original normans and the french and others that the british line uh... were having
[40:28.720 --> 40:32.560]  trouble having children is that why because they had all those little states in germany
[40:32.560 --> 40:37.280]  how did the german royal line which hadn't been dominant previously end up populating all the
[40:37.280 --> 40:43.520]  major royal thrones uh... by seventeen fifty well i i would say maybe a little bit later and a lot
[40:43.520 --> 40:47.760]  of these people are the the uh... the germans were controlled by seventeen hundred the nieces
[40:47.760 --> 40:52.800]  and nephews of of queen victoria uh... that that's again edward the seventh was known as the uncle
[40:52.800 --> 40:58.960]  of europe because all of the uh... the you know the czar of russia was his nephew the german
[40:58.960 --> 41:04.320]  kaiser was his nephew the austrians they had blood there yeah but the the big thing is that queen
[41:04.320 --> 41:08.080]  queen victoria had a lot of children and the intermarriage they are meant that you you have
[41:08.080 --> 41:13.600]  a kind of a merger of many or most of the european royal houses with the british one
[41:13.600 --> 41:17.200]  because the british of course had the you know they had naval supremacy they had financial
[41:17.200 --> 41:22.480]  supremacy they had uh... sure kind of a pecking order supremacy i mean the kaiser willhelm poor
[41:22.480 --> 41:28.160]  guy emperor william the second of germany was obsessed with the idea that edward the seventh
[41:28.160 --> 41:32.880]  of england was you know much more prestigious and much more uh... you know he had much greater
[41:32.880 --> 41:39.360]  rank in the world oligarchical you know universe than than he did so it's basically a united thing
[41:39.360 --> 41:44.560]  and that and that's what you see uh... today but again what she's what the queen is representing
[41:44.560 --> 41:49.680]  here is a decision that you know comes from the city of london it comes from the toronto
[41:49.680 --> 41:53.440]  financial district it comes really from wall street too because there are a lot of people
[41:53.440 --> 41:58.800]  there who are sort of dual you know loyalty people that looking to the to the british as
[41:58.800 --> 42:03.200]  the as the homeland also notice that the seven hundred billion dollar bailout that we fought
[42:03.200 --> 42:08.480]  against and tried you know to stop and there was no point for trillion right right uh...
[42:08.480 --> 42:13.040]  that was a british model bailout in the result of the whole idea from that came from gordon brown
[42:13.040 --> 42:17.280]  allister darlin they had met that they had never been king that he was he was the big
[42:17.280 --> 42:22.160]  inspiration of that now we've got a funny situation if you look at city bank city bank
[42:22.160 --> 42:27.280]  got twenty five billion i think under the first round of the bailout the gordon brown british
[42:27.280 --> 42:32.480]  model bailout and begin to go bankrupt a second time right so now city bank had to get a second
[42:32.480 --> 42:37.280]  bailout this one was done under the swiss model this was done under the bad bank model where
[42:37.280 --> 42:42.080]  you create this separate bank and put all the toxic derivatives into that one and throw it
[42:42.080 --> 42:45.520]  overboard and now they're going to go bankrupt again so what do you do when they go bankrupt
[42:45.520 --> 42:50.880]  for the third time you've tried the british model it failed you try the swiss model i think
[42:50.880 --> 42:56.400]  it's clear the city bank is a candidate for chapter eleven uh... reorganization and wipe
[42:56.400 --> 43:00.240]  out the derivatives let me digress and we'll get more into the bailout the banker takeover
[43:00.240 --> 43:03.760]  and then and then move into mubah because i want to spend time on them and obama coming up the
[43:03.760 --> 43:08.800]  next hour uh... isn't an extremely dangerous they don't do this a lot to have the queen
[43:08.800 --> 43:13.840]  go ahead and come right out in the open and and basically a show canadians and the world
[43:13.840 --> 43:19.360]  that these are commonwealth uh... are really governed by the shadow government and that
[43:19.360 --> 43:25.520]  their parliaments do serve uh... basically at the pleasure and his ceremonial uh...
[43:25.520 --> 43:30.080]  legates it's dangerous and i think the question there was who's going to do something about it
[43:30.080 --> 43:34.800]  now you have uh... this left-wing thing called the new democratic party are they going to do
[43:34.800 --> 43:40.320]  anything how about it new democrats are you going to fight for for some notion of rule of law that's
[43:40.320 --> 43:45.440]  the question why are they what why is the queen and harper going after the liberals i think it's
[43:45.440 --> 43:49.440]  a combination of two things it's on the one side the idea that they think that nobody will fight
[43:49.440 --> 43:54.320]  is there a canadian trade union federation of their of the kebek why how about the kebek why
[43:54.320 --> 43:58.640]  how about the will the canadian media will the canadian media tell people what this is what
[43:58.640 --> 44:04.720]  they're saying yeah it's it's uh... that's unlikely but there might be again what the
[44:04.720 --> 44:09.280]  challenge is if somebody pulls a coup d'etat this is a cold coup by the queen that's a good
[44:10.080 --> 44:14.640]  the only answer to a cold coup of any kind is an open-ended nationwide general strike and there
[44:14.640 --> 44:19.520]  should be a and there should be a million canadians right now protesting in ottawa and that should
[44:19.520 --> 44:24.560]  be a general strike but shut it down uh... did the model for all this stuff is the cop
[44:24.560 --> 44:31.120]  push in germany in uh... what nineteen twenty nineteen twenty one a group of a sort of proto
[44:31.120 --> 44:36.240]  proto fascist uh... civil servants and officers took over the government is this guy cop
[44:36.240 --> 44:40.960]  and the answer to that was the social democratic party and the trade union said
[44:40.960 --> 44:46.640]  we're shutting it all down nothing moves and had tried that with the munich putsch a few years later
[44:46.640 --> 44:50.560]  right that's in it that's a second attempt at the cop putsch but the cop putsch is it is a case
[44:50.560 --> 44:54.400]  where they actually did seize the government in berlin and then had to give it up because the
[44:54.400 --> 45:00.160]  the ruling elite got scared and they said oh my god somebody's fighting we better back off and
[45:00.160 --> 45:05.360]  we'll try again another day understand something that causes random explosions could be dangerous
[45:05.360 --> 45:09.200]  to them right but in this case there was there was a they had organization which we don't have
[45:09.200 --> 45:12.960]  and it was we don't have a social democratic party or anything like it we don't have a trade
[45:12.960 --> 45:18.000]  union we don't have a real liberal arm it's all infiltrated well we don't have mass organizations
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.080]  right that's the biggest thing is that there's a complete atomization of the of the u.s. well
[45:22.080 --> 45:27.360]  that's infiltration uh... by the left gatekeepers and by the right gatekeepers and any organization
[45:27.360 --> 45:31.680]  i mean if we try to have a meeting of two hundred people a provocateur shows up and tries to cause
[45:31.680 --> 45:35.760]  a problem so that gets into the whole other area of the science of dealing with them and throwing
[45:35.760 --> 45:40.400]  them out i mean i let very few in my office because i had folks show up randomly uh...
[45:40.400 --> 45:44.080]  you know with the videotape and try to claim we did something to him you know they run around
[45:44.080 --> 45:49.840]  there's major co-intel pro in this town webster well the only way you fight the uh... the arrogance
[45:49.840 --> 45:54.560]  of secret intelligence agencies and people who do this is with mass organization and that's it's
[45:54.560 --> 45:58.960]  got to start with mass there's got to be more organizations to not just even you say mass
[45:58.960 --> 46:04.320]  those are easy easy to infiltrate with the with the tools the enemies developed uh... what about
[46:04.320 --> 46:09.360]  a general manifesto of liberty and thousands of groups than joining together spontaneously and
[46:09.360 --> 46:14.320]  what the enemy is most worried about in their own uh... military uh... projections and that is
[46:14.320 --> 46:19.920]  flash mobs well uh... a united front another was a united but because right now we don't
[46:19.920 --> 46:23.760]  have such an umbrella organization so we'd have to be with only the only thing we could do right
[46:23.760 --> 46:28.480]  now it would be realistic is to say let's have a united front i've talked about calling something
[46:28.480 --> 46:34.080]  like americans against fascism i believe this is an anti-fascist country i think that's the
[46:34.080 --> 46:39.040]  one thing we can still say about the u.s. the american people are opposed to fascism
[46:39.040 --> 46:43.920]  and the stuff with obama it comes from the crimes of bush cheney in the neocons a lot of people
[46:43.920 --> 46:48.640]  thought they were voting against the devil they knew unfortunately they didn't know the devil they
[46:48.640 --> 46:55.360]  were getting who is several circles deeper in the inferno than bush and cheney he comes from
[46:55.360 --> 46:59.120]  there pretty much but he's not he's not the bottom he's not quite the bottom still there's
[46:59.120 --> 47:05.040]  something even worse than than obama coming from the wings but uh... the uh... a lot of people
[47:05.040 --> 47:08.800]  thought they were voting against that and of course a lot of people are voting because they see a
[47:08.800 --> 47:13.440]  depression and they say well you know let's get these reactionary republicans out of there
[47:13.440 --> 47:17.360]  and let's get a democrat and maybe well meanwhile the enemy had already seen that people were going
[47:17.360 --> 47:22.560]  to rebel after eight years of this so years ago they had groomed and prepared this foundation
[47:22.560 --> 47:28.160]  front with all of these stalinist uh... and and and and linonesk cover points when really he's a
[47:28.160 --> 47:33.920]  corporatist to the core right and he's a musolini and and certainly he does have these overtones
[47:33.920 --> 47:40.560]  of of of soviet style totalitarianism beyond any doubt but the the ultimate borrowing from every
[47:41.520 --> 47:47.120]  i mean the most horrible pieces from every machine of dehumanization and and and combining in here
[47:47.120 --> 47:51.840]  that's it's it's a cookbook and that's the cookbook of the of the cia people power coup or color
[47:51.840 --> 47:57.520]  revolution it's the key of two thousand and four cookbook it's the typhus georgia two thousand and
[47:57.520 --> 48:02.640]  three two thousand and four cookbook uh... they've tried at someplace else they even tried uh...
[48:02.640 --> 48:06.960]  in north of israel and lebanon to come in with these color revolutions but it seems like the
[48:06.960 --> 48:11.440]  cover the color revolutions are blowing up on every front but see that was that the lebanon
[48:11.440 --> 48:14.960]  one is interesting because there they tried to do the cedars revolution with the rich
[48:15.680 --> 48:20.480]  christian marinates and so forth and they ran right up against in this case a real mass organization
[48:20.480 --> 48:24.080]  has below you can you can say what you want about his border right you wouldn't want to endorse
[48:24.080 --> 48:28.800]  everything they do but that is an authentic mass organization and they stopped at cold
[48:28.800 --> 48:33.040]  and they showed that they could put more people into the streets than the than the hysterical
[48:33.040 --> 48:36.800]  mass media and uh... you know the u.s. embassy and all their paid
[48:36.800 --> 48:41.440]  shills so that's it that's a real good example i mean you don't again we're not want to we don't
[48:41.440 --> 48:46.800]  want to find a hezbollah here but no mass organization yeah exactly a mass organization
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.440]  stops them right now we don't have it so what we've got to do is i mean during the phase that
[48:51.440 --> 48:56.880]  we're in now up until january 20th the main thing i think is to educate people right to denounce
[48:56.880 --> 49:02.160]  these people as they come forward right oh robert gates who's he well that's big new burjinsky's
[49:02.160 --> 49:08.960]  office boy from 1977 to 1979 that's a that's a guy who was up to his neck in the october

[53:44.480 --> 53:49.920]  before we leave we'll plug that webster uh webster let's continue right now with where we'd gotten to
[53:50.480 --> 53:56.960]  with what al qaeda is uh how it was created how the establishment created radicalized
[53:56.960 --> 54:01.200]  muslim groups that were already there but funded them expanded them to run around the 50 60 70s
[54:01.200 --> 54:06.080]  80s this just didn't begin with brzezinski to menace governments that the establishment didn't
[54:06.080 --> 54:10.560]  like and then after they let the extremist muslims take over then the west has a new enemy
[54:10.560 --> 54:16.000]  and recycles that uh but the point of uh robert gates the secretary of defense that obama has
[54:16.000 --> 54:23.600]  said he's keeping over uh being literally uh the brzezinski a man at the al qaeda desk with its
[54:23.600 --> 54:30.800]  founding uh its organization in the late 1970s i think gates gates sets the stage from a couple
[54:30.800 --> 54:36.400]  of points of view uh last wednesday i got up in the morning go outside get the washington post
[54:36.400 --> 54:42.640]  gates will stay at the pedigone reading this thing in the afternoon reports coming in Mumbai
[54:42.640 --> 54:50.720]  terrorism so the same day that the world learned in the papers that obama had uh essentially
[54:50.720 --> 54:56.560]  accepted the dictation of his handlers to keep gates at the pentagon throw out all this stuff
[54:56.560 --> 55:03.520]  about hope and change uh the change no more change gates stays at the pentagon now robert gates who
[55:03.520 --> 55:11.360]  is this person uh robert gates first of all was as brzezinski says from 1977 to 1979 80
[55:11.920 --> 55:17.200]  when brzezinski came to the national security council of the jimmy carter twilateral administration
[55:17.200 --> 55:21.840]  every morning the first person he saw in the morning was robert gates and the last person
[55:21.840 --> 55:27.520]  he saw in the evening when he left was robert gates so robert gates was his right hand man
[55:27.520 --> 55:34.560]  his girl friday his uh his office board his gopher his man and we see this with these apprentices
[55:34.560 --> 55:40.560]  with these sith lords just like kashkari is paulson's long-term servant minion now handing out the
[55:40.560 --> 55:47.600]  8.4 trill right so gates uh gates is a clone of spigner brzezinski they say he's a republican
[55:47.600 --> 55:51.520]  that this doesn't matter at all his former cia director yeah we'll get to where we're gonna get
[55:51.520 --> 55:57.760]  to him his his career was sponsored by by spigner brzezinski now recently gates signaled to all of
[55:57.760 --> 56:01.920]  us what he's gonna do and he gave a he gave a speech i don't know if you saw this it's the
[56:01.920 --> 56:07.440]  carnage endowment for international peace yes with jessica mathews the real think tank that
[56:07.440 --> 56:12.640]  really makes a lot of policy it's a pretty high level one it's older uh jessica mathews of course
[56:12.640 --> 56:18.240]  this is the daughter of barbara tuckman this is the daughter of coon lobe warburg all this stuff
[56:18.240 --> 56:23.840]  the attempted nazi coup in the thirties right but she so she's there uh and and gates is in a
[56:23.840 --> 56:29.600]  he's in a mood of nostalgia and he says hey jessica speaking to a gathering at the uh
[56:29.600 --> 56:34.320]  at the carnage endowment he says jessica do you remember when both of us worked for his big new
[56:34.320 --> 56:41.520]  brzezinski at the national security council and we got this invitation to go to algears in algeria
[56:41.520 --> 56:47.680]  on april first i believe it was of 1978 because that was the national day and there was an opportunity
[56:47.680 --> 56:53.760]  to meet with the iranian leadership in other words the komeini acts the komeini guys the komeini
[56:53.760 --> 56:58.800]  prime minister the komeini defense minister and the komeini foreign minister i got that guy was
[56:58.800 --> 57:04.320]  yazdi he was the most important of these and he says jessica you remember how his big new gave a
[57:04.320 --> 57:08.560]  speech and he laid it all out for the iranians and he said to them in a private meeting look
[57:08.560 --> 57:13.040]  iranians stay there we've got a break back in 70 seconds with this riveting and vital information
[57:13.040 --> 57:20.240]  we'll be right back hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[57:20.240 --> 57:24.240]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent
[57:24.240 --> 57:29.040]  and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread
[57:29.040 --> 57:33.280]  you'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for female to take care of your family in any
[57:33.280 --> 57:37.840]  emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[57:37.840 --> 57:42.320]  for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones
[57:42.320 --> 57:48.080]  and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the
[57:48.080 --> 57:53.440]  america and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings
[57:53.440 --> 57:58.720]  to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans reach
[57:58.720 --> 58:04.080]  in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached
[58:04.080 --> 58:09.840]  over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[58:09.840 --> 58:14.640]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money
[58:14.640 --> 58:19.600]  to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business whatever
[58:19.600 --> 58:24.640]  happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third
[58:24.640 --> 58:29.440]  of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever
[58:29.440 --> 58:34.320]  it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very
[58:34.320 --> 58:38.080]  important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the government the new
[58:38.080 --> 58:43.040]  old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[58:43.040 --> 58:47.280]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you

[59:28.800 --> 59:36.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[59:36.080 --> 59:45.680]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones we are back
[59:45.680 --> 59:51.040]  live we have web surrogate internally in studio with us we're getting into right now the real
[59:51.040 --> 59:56.720]  obama administration the real players and individuals uh that he is putting in place
[59:56.720 --> 1:00:02.400]  and if it is possible it's an even more cold-blooded wicked group of uh anglo-american oligarchs
[1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:08.400]  uh but now with left cover and we were getting into just just one person of countless robert gates
[1:00:08.960 --> 1:00:14.240]  that uh he is bringing in to continue on a secretary of defense meeting with the come up the
[1:00:14.240 --> 1:00:21.680]  the comaniacs uh in 78 right as they're being about to be installed uh there uh uh and i ran
[1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:28.000]  so let's continue with the founding of al-ci ada and then that will be a perfect uh segue
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:34.720]  into mubai all of the just happened in india so gates is is a is is a clone of bryzinski
[1:00:34.720 --> 1:00:41.360]  he was his office boy at the national security council 70s 77 to 79 and then you get a bryzinski
[1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:46.480]  coming out with this proposition that islamic fundamentalism is the greatest bulwark against
[1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:52.080]  soviet communism and soviet imperialism so bryzinski plays the islamic fundamentalist
[1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:57.280]  card with the vengeance bryzinski is the founder of islamic modern islamic fundamentalism he's the
[1:00:57.280 --> 1:01:03.440]  one who who made these people great so we have then the secret meeting and i cover this in uh in
[1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:08.480]  obama the postmodern coup it was actually so hot that there was some some some of the additions
[1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:12.640]  around the world say hey wait a minute can you prove this well in meantime i can because gates
[1:01:12.640 --> 1:01:16.720]  has come out and said it so gates meets but that's in so many historical records i mean
[1:01:16.720 --> 1:01:20.720]  i mean i knew that 15 years ago and i didn't know one yet in general but the specific meeting and
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:24.880]  here's your specific meeting okay and and it comes to the hostages because here we have bryzinski
[1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:28.960]  meeting with yazdi now they're in power the communics have seized power they're they're running
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:34.080]  iran like the shah is is fled he's in the u.s at this point so bryzinski talks to the foreign
[1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:40.800]  minister yazdi who's a environmentalist wacko he's a crazy eugenicist yeah genesis he's a paul pot
[1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:48.320]  he's a paul pot of of of iran is the idea a lifehater yeah so he uh he um they they're talking
[1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:52.480]  so bryzinski and this is gates telling the story so gates is telling the karnagy endowment
[1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:59.920]  you know bryzinski laid it all out he said look we don't like komane but we're gonna give you all
[1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:03.760]  the weapons that the shah had ordered everything the shah wanted we're gonna give you we're gonna
[1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:09.200]  give you all the weapons right the hawk missiles the uh you know every spare parts for your airplanes
[1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:15.040]  because we have a common enemy it's the soviets to your north the soviets are our common enemy
[1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:21.040]  so we're gonna arm you so the the intent is clear what what gates is trying to do is to say
[1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:27.440]  remember that our basic approach to iran over decades is to play iran against the russians
[1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:31.440]  in a war centered on the caspian sea and that's why we're in the middle east to begin with i mean
[1:02:31.440 --> 1:02:36.080]  it's not just about weapons contracts or oil it's not so much even about israel that's a part of it
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:40.800]  it's really about this is stated by the pentagon the encirclement of russia the containment of china
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:44.720]  right world power of which these other things that you mentioned the oil and the israelis are
[1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:48.240]  subsets but it's about world domination because when you're dealing with the russian that's always
[1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:52.800]  good when you have subsets because that gets all the power blocks together when you have them unified
[1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:58.320]  with gain right which is what bush failed to do which is now what obama will try to do so so that
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:04.080]  is the nuance we're hearing there's gonna be nuance and it's gonna be a more nuanced more more serpentine
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:11.120]  Byzantine deployment the new the nuances instead of you bombing iran pros you play iran against
[1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:15.360]  the russians and get get rid of both of them that way rather than ending up bogged down in the war
[1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:19.840]  yourself so what gates says then brzezinski tells the iranians look we're going to give you all the
[1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:25.280]  weapons you want and they say fine give us the shah and brzezinski gets all huffy and says no we
[1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:29.280]  can't give you the shah because that that would have been a tremendous political suicide for
[1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:35.680]  carter so out of this meeting then comes the idea of doing what let's get some hostages taken
[1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:39.760]  this this is not the part that the gates will tell you gates will not admit to this part
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:45.200]  but the whole business with the hostages in iran was to say we want the comaniacs to take the
[1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:51.280]  u.s. embassy personnel as hostages because with that the whole u.s. bureaucracy has an excuse a
[1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:56.880]  cover story if anybody says why are you shipping weapons to iran they can see we're doing it to
[1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:01.440]  save the lives of these poor hostages and we know they did give them the armaments and they did
[1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:06.480]  and that's iran contra now so that we're gonna break again we're gonna come back and have plenty
[1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:12.160]  of time the long segment then let's get into what happened in mu by different place same story
[1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:16.960]  same story same method all over again prisonplanet.com be sure and check it out we'll be right back
[1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:28.880]  webster i'm gonna skip john word is now i'm gonna skip this break for internet only
[1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:34.000]  and continue talking but uh but so that it has congruent see let's uh let's talk about another
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:39.600]  subject right now uh and then we'll come back and and and finish up there webster well we have a big
[1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:42.320]  show today i would have you there for three or four hours it's just it's just great to have you
[1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:47.120]  down here i've got paris coming up a big rap star uh he's fighting the new world order and and then
[1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:53.200]  we have a guest about all the gmo food and what's happening with that uh coming up as well but but
[1:04:53.200 --> 1:04:58.240]  but uh just talking about betrayal itself just briefly in the two minutes we're gonna have left
[1:04:58.240 --> 1:05:05.680]  here uh i see the obama minions holding because they can't admit they've been con they can't admit
[1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:09.680]  this euphoria is false they've been taken kind of like conservatives couldn't admit is bush triple
[1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:13.680]  the size of government and did all these anti-american things that he wasn't really a conservative
[1:05:13.680 --> 1:05:20.400]  you know in the uh in the george washington vane or you know uh so so uh where i mean how do you
[1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:24.480]  see this unfolding because i you know i lay the facts out to democrats on the street and i say
[1:05:24.480 --> 1:05:28.480]  but he's doing everything bush did and more and now he'll get a new lease on life for this whole
[1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:33.600]  agenda and they just go i don't care you're just being negative so i'm literally seeing cult like
[1:05:33.600 --> 1:05:39.440]  behavior yeah cult like uh the i think the operative concept is the night of the long knives and the
[1:05:39.440 --> 1:05:46.080]  night of the long knives was something like june 30th 1934 so after about 14 15 months of hitler
[1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:53.200]  in power exterminate sa i don't need these gutter snipes i don't need these goons thugs hooligans
[1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:57.360]  fervently idealistic students was there in revolution mode so you know that they know they'll
[1:05:57.360 --> 1:06:00.640]  and they want to go on and they want to make themselves the head of the army and they're
[1:06:00.640 --> 1:06:05.680]  similar to now but they want to take over the pentagon and just like today it was a predominantly
[1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:10.400]  homosexual cult so that was embarrassing there's that and there are a lot of morphine addicts
[1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:15.040]  and drug addicts running around to some of these are the same people and now with Mussolini it's
[1:06:15.040 --> 1:06:20.000]  done uh sort of on the installment plan i would look to obama to follow the Mussolini model rather
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:24.880]  than the national so safer slower model but now this is what uh what biden has already told us
[1:06:24.880 --> 1:06:31.520]  biden has told us that by 12 months into the new regime it's standing in the polls will be abysmal
[1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:38.480]  in other words they'll be down to truman levels 22 23 24 percent after one year of obama you're
[1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:43.280]  going to find that some of these uh some of these flakes are going to flake off in other words the
[1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:49.840]  the the left liberal uh kool-aid drinking community is going to be you know fragmented and and it's
[1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:54.320]  to some extent you can already see even on the daily coasts in places like this there were there
[1:06:54.320 --> 1:07:00.960]  were people who are not happy with ramen manuel not happy with uh with gates my god hillary uh
[1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:07.440]  hillary they don't like uh valker i mean valker is in some ways the most amazing because everybody
[1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:14.720]  knows what valker did 22 prime rate your credit card rate 30 35 but let's come back then and and
[1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:18.960]  then get back into gates but then before you leave let's talk about how you're how they're planning
[1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:23.840]  to go after the left when the left actually finds out that this means more wars domestic
[1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:29.120]  security forces police state corporate looting valker all of this here we go they'll they'll try
[1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:39.280]  to pull some of this stuff is there's a war on for your mind okay webster let's get right back into
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:46.400]  how uh the islamo fascist as the neocons like to call them were actually put into power uh
[1:07:46.400 --> 1:07:51.920]  buys a big new brzezinski and of course secretary of defense gates at the time who was the man
[1:07:51.920 --> 1:07:57.680]  handling iran contra and this is a historical fact and you bring this up to conservatives and
[1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:02.560]  i mean i had a you know special forces guy black ops guy who's now a lawyer you know with the
[1:08:02.560 --> 1:08:06.960]  terrorism center and he's saying we've got to have basically world war three because the iranians are
[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:11.040]  going to nuke us and kill us and oh my god the islamo fascist when it's a fact that the that
[1:08:11.040 --> 1:08:15.440]  there were that there were already you know these extremist muslims and they were energized
[1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:22.080]  by the west so continue so the basic idea is that that that brzezinski gates and and carter and
[1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:28.960]  syris vance well twilaterals all uh over through the shah not only did they overthrow the shah but
[1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:35.360]  they insisted on bringing in komeini not a gen moles coup not this guy bakti arhu is around but
[1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:40.640]  it had to be komeini because islamic fundamentalism was the great ball walking and soviet communism so
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:47.360]  after this april 1978 meeting in algears with brzezinski and yazdi there was agreement that the
[1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:51.680]  u.s. is going to continue to deliver weapons and then there's a side agreement between brzezinski
[1:08:51.680 --> 1:08:56.560]  and yazdi that nobody talks about i believe in which they say all right we're going to have a
[1:08:56.560 --> 1:09:01.520]  taking of hostages and there's a lot of stuff and i go through it and i got a part on the
[1:09:01.520 --> 1:09:06.960]  carter administration in this book now the october surprise was then the freeing of the hostages
[1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:12.000]  right and the trick was to try to make sure that the hostages were not freed under carter before
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:16.240]  november 1980 because that would have gotten carter re-elected or or might have and then as
[1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:21.120]  soon as reagan's elected they release them right now there were there were then hearings uh this
[1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:25.680]  guy gary sick you may remember him gary sick from the state department of whatever he was
[1:09:25.680 --> 1:09:30.080]  he promoted these hearings about the october surprise and back in my book george bush the
[1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:36.480]  unauthorized biography 1992 i read about the fact that there were lots of reports that george bush
[1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:41.280]  the elder personally flew to paris one night in a private jet to meet with some iranians and then
[1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:47.120]  come back we know that kissinger was reported to be negotiating with iranians and and others uh
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:51.760]  you know dick uh whatever his name was the guy in the the other guy in the reagan national
[1:09:51.760 --> 1:09:56.960]  security council um the thing that barbara hanager has written about but now when when
[1:09:56.960 --> 1:10:04.640]  those hearings started the soviet government moscow sent a whole uh bunch of of information
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:08.640]  to the senate uh committee actually the house committee with lee hamilton our dear friend
[1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:14.000]  lee hamilton who's such a good investigator as we know from 9 11 and it said look here's all the
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:20.880]  information about robert gates up to his neck in iran contra or what was then going to be called
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:27.280]  iran contra and above all the october surprise so this guy is dirty now the other dimension on him
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:32.400]  is as he writes in his own memoirs and this i write about in uh in uh nine eleven synthetic
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:39.200]  terra made in usa gates wrote his memoirs and he said we considered creating an arab legion
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:45.520]  of fighters from all the arab countries to go into afghanistan which is not arab but muslim
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:51.760]  and fight the soviets but we decided not to do it yeah bunk you did decide to do it and it's called
[1:10:51.760 --> 1:11:00.000]  al qaeda so robert gates is fighting his own illegitimate child we might say right robert gates
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:05.200]  at the pentagon is directing the worldwide struggle against al qaeda which he founded
[1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:11.440]  and when his when he was named back in uh 2006 i put out a short release about this saying
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:15.760]  this guy should not be the head of the pentagon because he's the founder of al qaeda let's expand
[1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:20.560]  on that they're not fighting al qaeda as we know five years ago i reported in cyhurst three and a
[1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:25.120]  half years ago and then last year the white house at white house dot gov puts out a press release
[1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:33.360]  saying we are funding uh pro democracy forces here are the four groups uh in eastern iraq into
[1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:39.440]  iran and they are these wahhabist groups and there was one little curd group tacked on and then
[1:11:39.440 --> 1:11:44.560]  it turned out the guy commanding the largest group was the number three listed by the fbi
[1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:50.320]  number three in al qaeda and they're staging terror attacks all over iran and iran is now
[1:11:50.320 --> 1:11:57.040]  suing the united states for blowing up mass schools police stations and then bush remember
[1:11:57.040 --> 1:12:02.480]  last year with mohammed carzai on the wall in the rose garden said we need to go into iran
[1:12:02.480 --> 1:12:07.760]  because iran is funding al qaeda in afghanistan and cars i even though he's this puppet unicoil
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:11.840]  you know narcotics trafficker he sees he says excuse me mr president he knew this was on tv
[1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:17.440]  overseas and this was like saying that you know a spider man really lives or or that santa claus
[1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:24.640]  is real he said uh iran is she died and they're actually helping us uh fight uh the wahhabist
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:30.480]  which are suing and uh we're friends with iran and bush said no that's not true iran is al qaeda
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:34.960]  and we saw many other people say this so so of course bush knows that's not the case they're
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:41.040]  talking to the public like their complete morons and so al qaeda clearly just this catch all for
[1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:45.280]  muslim groups they don't control but then when they have real terror attacks it staged let's now
[1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:53.440]  get into mumbai well we know uh obama first of all is the greatest paki basher of all time in
[1:12:53.440 --> 1:12:58.480]  other words obama is the guy who ran for president saying i'm gonna bomb the hell out of pakistan
[1:12:58.480 --> 1:13:02.640]  and then magically the crisis appears and the crisis appears now let me stress again i do not
[1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:07.680]  believe there's going to be an attack on iran no because i'm not not that i can see i'll be very
[1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:13.360]  surprised okay but israel says they may go in i think this is uh this is a lot of raster and it's
[1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:18.480]  so there's a negotiation going on but as iran's is still part of this or are they broken off from
[1:13:18.480 --> 1:13:22.960]  the neocons you look at uh it's not the neocons again i mean i know it's the i know it's the
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:27.360]  i know it's the liberal regime ski is the guy i understand it's the difference is that it's the
[1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:33.120]  harvard phd but i'm the harvard boutique yeah it's that office but what i'm saying is i'm saying did
[1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:37.440]  they break off during the neocon time they break off before uh there have there's been a period of
[1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:42.320]  bad relations okay but and and you know there's mass politics and other things that go into this
[1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:47.520]  but right now obama ran on a brzezinski platform which is to say i'm going to bomb and destroy
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:51.520]  pakistan and i'm going to negotiate with iran what are you going to negotiate with iran you're
[1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:58.400]  going to negotiate the terms by which iran becomes a cat's paw for the u.s in the kasbian sea against
[1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:05.040]  the enemy to the north and that's of course it's still russia bust up the uh the baku kasbian sea
[1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:10.640]  oil thing get an iranian fleet in the kasbian sea an iranian fleet with nuclear weapons if you
[1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:17.120]  look at brzezinski's track record his track record is delivering very advanced military hardware why
[1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:22.960]  did the west tell why did the west help deliver the the components uh england the u.s to iran
[1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:28.320]  yeah because that was geopolitics then and it's geopolitics now this geo strategic as he likes
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:32.960]  to say now if you look at what brzezinski writes he goes as far as he can he says once we normalize
[1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:38.960]  relations between the u.s and iran iran could be could resume its usual role of being a positive
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:43.920]  factor in regional stability now there used to be this thing called sento remember the central
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:49.600]  treaty organization i think it was turkey iraq iran pakistan it fell apart really in the in the
[1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:53.520]  sixties it fell apart during the during the vietnam war but they'd like they'd like to get back to
[1:14:53.520 --> 1:14:58.480]  this the idea would be play iran against the russians now moving to pakistan this is a totally
[1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:04.000]  different story the whole business in afghanistan is now being run for one purpose and one purpose
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:10.320]  only break up pakistan destroy it with iran you want to negotiate you'd like to have a different
[1:15:10.320 --> 1:15:15.440]  government but for the moment it's going to be a puppet ultimately their schedule to be
[1:15:15.440 --> 1:15:22.000]  carved up into six or seven parts as well but the hot the front burner let's say the hot topic is
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:29.200]  is pakistan now why pakistan because it's a chinese ally it's it has a border with china and china
[1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:34.400]  needs the pipelines that come through it and china has said in an indian pakistan conflict they are
[1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:39.040]  now siding they said two days ago with pakistan yeah and this is a this is a you know long term
[1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:44.880]  thing remember the sino-soviet split india went with the russians but pakistan went most decidedly
[1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:49.600]  with the chinese because they have a common border if you look at pakistan it goes from the arabian
[1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:55.760]  sea and it joins pak it joins with china above india above then you've got napal and all that
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:16:00.080]  yeah but that for the way down the main thing is that there's a common border between pakistan
[1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:05.120]  and china and there's this port guadar we got it you got to get rid of the old map of the persian
[1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:12.000]  gulf and get a really big burjinsky style map guadar is this deep water port at the arabian
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:19.200]  sea so it's southwest pakistan not so far from iran but above all the straits of womos are there
[1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:25.840]  so the idea with the chinese is if they could get tankers coming from saudi arabia iraq iran
[1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:30.640]  from those tanker terminals coming out of the straits of womos they could build a pipeline
[1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:35.520]  that would go up pakistan that's a pipeline up the india it's not there yet but i need that
[1:16:35.520 --> 1:16:39.280]  now let's stop that's only happening except for russia but russia doesn't have big terminals
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:43.280]  and it's landlocked because therefore you get away from the also got that you also got the
[1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:47.040]  himalayas so they can't get it from russia well you can maybe go around it but the main thing is
[1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:51.440]  the anglo-american fleets the anglo-american naval domination of the persian gulf and the
[1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:56.560]  arabian sea is key to work around that and what if you can if you're china and you get you make
[1:16:56.560 --> 1:17:01.760]  pakistan into your energy corridor you can do two things you can have a pipeline that goes directly
[1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:07.760]  from iran to pakistan to china there you have your guaranteed oil supply with no anglo-american
[1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:12.160]  air fleet anywhere and then you can develop the railways cities and then have china dominate the
[1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:15.200]  region now let's stop right there because we're almost out of time webster we have a little bit
[1:17:15.200 --> 1:17:22.240]  left in this segment and a five-minute segment now how does the mubai bombay situation play into
[1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:26.480]  all of this and what is your analysis of what really happened there okay first of all this
[1:17:26.480 --> 1:17:31.120]  basically it's coming in as if on q right it's just when they need it remember there's an indian
[1:17:31.120 --> 1:17:36.960]  us nuclear accord that was approved in october in the hurley burley and brouhaha the presidential
[1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:41.760]  campaign we might have missed the fact that india has now become the spear point of the us the
[1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:46.640]  british and the israelis in eurasia it's what the british used to call a continental dagger
[1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:52.480]  india is a continental dagger it's 1.2 billion pieces of cannon fodder from the point of view
[1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:57.280]  of the us the british and and the israeli so the idea is to play them against china play them against
[1:17:57.280 --> 1:18:03.360]  russia play them against pakistan play them to to bust up any possibility of eurasian coalition
[1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:09.760]  yeah a coalition so uh... the other side of it is this port of guadal that has become operational
[1:18:09.760 --> 1:18:14.800]  this year and they can begin they could build a pipeline up there that would go straight into china
[1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:19.440]  it would cut about twenty five percent of the cost and would save them about what i understand
[1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:22.960]  i understand why it's happening but what i mean looking at that's who we have let's look at the
[1:18:22.960 --> 1:18:28.400]  attacks you basically got five or six indications right first thing is anything happening in the
[1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:33.520]  indian subcontinent the british are always the prime suspect always look for the old colonial power
[1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:38.400]  the british were there for two hundred two hundred and fifty years anything in india pakistan
[1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:42.880]  look to the british what do we find that the initial reports were that they were british
[1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:48.720]  citizens they were pakistani origin british citizens were some of the killers those were
[1:18:48.720 --> 1:18:54.080]  early reports that then somehow uh... disappeared so what do we got there brickston mosque
[1:18:54.080 --> 1:19:00.240]  finsbury mosque maybe they have an operation up in leeds in yorkshire they can recruit pakistanis
[1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:04.400]  they get him out of her majesties prisons they can brainwash them they can send them over that's
[1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:11.120]  number one secondly israelis israel in india has tremendously developed special relationship
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:15.920]  right but the indians are always buying hardware webster stay there webster stay there we've
[1:19:15.920 --> 1:19:20.320]  got a break again this is so important you know i may have you just come back at the end of the

[1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:15.280]  mu biotechs because it's so important they say they're going into pakistan they say there's
[1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:20.320]  going to be a crisis there right and then on cue it starts and you were talking about the israeli
[1:24:20.320 --> 1:24:25.520]  situation uh and this could be a reverse false flag it could be a setup but they were wearing
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:32.720]  the large hindu sect zionist uh uh wristbands uh they they had lsd cocaine classic mind control
[1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:38.800]  you have the intelligence chief who'd been saying who just caught them months ago the indians he
[1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:43.440]  busted a carray yes yes they killed him yes well let's get into that because that i mean
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:48.240]  the evidence there's hundreds of pieces uh only terrorism chiefs that had exposed the indian
[1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:53.920]  government was staging terror attacks they all die within minutes right so basically the british
[1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:59.120]  we've done the israelis general misrahi the head of the of the israeli armed forces ground forces
[1:24:59.680 --> 1:25:05.920]  goes to the disputed area of kashmir that's a bigger front to the moslem pakistani side of it
[1:25:05.920 --> 1:25:10.080]  right the whole kashmir issue is something that we should uh we should go through it's basically
[1:25:10.080 --> 1:25:15.760]  india is occupying islamic populations the un resolutions on kashmir is that they're supposed
[1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:21.920]  to be free elections who's blocking the free elections is india not pakistan so uh the israeli
[1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:26.880]  is a very big you could also say look look at the ineptitude look at the stupidity of these of
[1:25:26.880 --> 1:25:32.000]  the indian special forces right they were trained by the israelis and now they're screwing it all
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:37.280]  up well no no that went on for 65 hours they stood they stand down and don't shoot and and then
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:42.160]  five of the terrorism chiefs and deputies who'd all criticize the government
[1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:48.000]  they are the ones that only magically get triple tapped a piece right impossible but now concerning
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:53.680]  this the the the uh the u.s. let's not forget the the the u.s. in the in the so-called federally
[1:25:53.680 --> 1:25:58.720]  administered tribal areas in other words the northwest frontier the northwest area of pakistan
[1:25:58.720 --> 1:26:05.520]  that that's along the afghan border the the cia in addition to flying these predator drones is
[1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:10.720]  they also have stations i mean they have strong points right they have they have centers of
[1:26:10.720 --> 1:26:16.480]  operations among the federally administered tribal areas and we can assume that they're
[1:26:16.480 --> 1:26:23.280]  busily recruiting patsy's fanatics crazies mercenaries hooligans whatever to also become
[1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:28.320]  terrors one of the things the pakistanis ought to do is to kick the cia out of those federally
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:33.040]  administered tribal areas not let them in there anymore and a few minutes we got learning now
[1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:40.720]  two more the hindu's the hindu's the rss okay there's this thing the rss is a hindu extremist
[1:26:41.280 --> 1:26:47.840]  racist organization with strong fascist overtones they killed gondy yeah in effect they have been
[1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:52.480]  they're the descendants of the killers of gondy exactly they are as he wouldn't kill muslims
[1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:56.640]  right because he was not in favor of religious war so here we have the religious war party
[1:26:56.640 --> 1:26:59.680]  and sure enough the u.s and the british are backing and they're the ones tied in with israel
[1:26:59.680 --> 1:27:04.160]  that would be as far as i could see the ones with the with this blue uh... or the sorry pink
[1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:09.520]  the pink arm band that the one guy was wearing but the see the rss has been killing people all
[1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:13.440]  over india for years and years you never hear about and it's rss infiltrators that keep doing
[1:27:13.440 --> 1:27:18.320]  false flags and muslims look you go you have a terrorist swamp then you have the rss provides
[1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:22.800]  the etiology for that then you have the bjp which is the governing party and they are now bidding
[1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:26.240]  fair to take over the government again in the backlash to what has just gone on and they give
[1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:30.880]  the conduit or the tunnel for the people to be brought in but but putting an end cap on this
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:36.400]  was because it's about the end cap is the raw r a w you heard about the isi right yeah everybody
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:43.600]  knows the isi about the raw the research and uh... uh... whatever they call it the research and
[1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:49.680]  something about research and analysis wing the research and analysis wing of indian intelligence
[1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:57.120]  they are up in afghanistan recruiting crazies from afghanistan to bring them down and have them
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:03.120]  engage in terrorism against pakistan so the indians have a real dirty aspect may be maybe the israel
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:07.600]  it's the same groups setting off bombings in the last few months trying to overthrow the pakistani
[1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:11.840]  government and they're admittedly west right back and and and the pakistani government has been
[1:28:11.840 --> 1:28:18.400]  saying the west is staging this is a pretax that was the final point to bring pressure in on pakistan
[1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:23.520]  or even overthrow them so when you come back in a few hours we will break down that but in the last
[1:28:23.520 --> 1:28:28.560]  minute we have talk about that just what is the point of all this the point of it is to play india
[1:28:28.560 --> 1:28:33.520]  against pakistan bring in a radical government bring in a radical war government india and if
[1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:38.720]  you if you put if you play india against pakistan you destroy both in other words the indian military
[1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:44.240]  would inflict grievous damage on pakistan but india is a country with one billion hindu's
[1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:48.960]  but there are 200 million moslems that'll cause tribal warfare around the time so it's just like
[1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:53.520]  iran iraq being played off against each other both sides being funded by the u.s it's much bigger
[1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:58.640]  it's it's huge it's not 60 million 20 million it's not 60 million and nuclear weapons on both sides
[1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:02.880]  it's uh it's it's hundreds of millions against a billion plus and nukes on both sides which in

[1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:50.240]  absolutely you hey it's a great to talk to you but for those that don't know who you are i mean
[1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:55.040]  breakdown you what sold three four million albums worked on a lot of other huge album yeah yeah i've
[1:35:55.040 --> 1:36:00.800]  um you know basically been making counter establishment hip hop that um that uh you know
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:07.120]  challenges the system is life-affirming music that i've been making for the entirety of my career
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:15.280]  i started in uh in 1990 and uh was have been on a lot of different labels and uh and i am now
[1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:23.440]  completely independent and um well completely independent but distributed by universal uh
[1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:28.240]  ironically enough because they have noticed the fact that uh that there are people out here who
[1:36:28.240 --> 1:36:35.200]  longer for this kind of material and um you know i've produced a public enemy and dead prayers and
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:40.320]  and uh the coup and a lot of other groups that are out there that represent these same sentiments
[1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:51.120]  and uh i'm still doing it paris um let's let's go back to 2001 and then look at what happened there
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:57.520]  and your views and take on that and then let's accelerate forward to what's happening today
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:02.400]  geopolitically what's happening in different sectors of the world in your take on somebody
[1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:11.280]  like barack h obama well you know 2001 my my current company and my last record which was
[1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:18.320]  sonic jihad which i i guess got on your radar a while ago um occurred as a result of our response
[1:37:18.320 --> 1:37:24.320]  to 9 11 and you know after after doing a lot of independent research and and actually uh
[1:37:24.320 --> 1:37:29.440]  viewing some of your films and so can i look up a lot of the information that was available online
[1:37:29.440 --> 1:37:34.560]  i came to the conclusion as have you and most of the people listening to you that self that 9 11
[1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:40.560]  was a self-inflicted wound as you like to put it and uh seeing the response seeing the erosion of
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:45.840]  our civil liberties seeing the shredding of the bill of rights seeing the increase in intolerance
[1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:54.240]  seeing the increase in racism and racist wars uh around the world led me to want to become
[1:37:54.240 --> 1:38:01.360]  um um more involved in making protest statements and to endorsing material that reflects that
[1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:08.240]  viewpoint and so guerrilla funk was formed and my first record sonic jihad came out um
[1:38:10.880 --> 1:38:17.360]  it was pretty much a sale by you know a lot of the mainstream press outlets msnbc fox news the
[1:38:17.360 --> 1:38:24.400]  whole thing and it was embraced by people who recognize truth and uh it did well enough to get
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:30.480]  on universal's radar to allow me to be able to sign other artists to uh you know kind of rally
[1:38:31.280 --> 1:38:38.640]  the people uh around that that you know felt the same who were also disenfranchised and
[1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:45.600]  unavailable you know unable to come out through traditional outlets and you know i've seen the
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:51.520]  whole thing kind of uh you know in in some respects things have gotten worse than some in
[1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:56.480]  some respects things have gotten better at least from outside looking in well before we get into
[1:38:56.480 --> 1:39:01.920]  what's happening currently uh just uh you know finishing up on along the lines of the music
[1:39:01.920 --> 1:39:06.160]  you put out right i mean i have to say i mean i like some hip-hop i like some rap you know i
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:10.800]  grew up listening to a lot of it in dallas but but even then only like certain people and others
[1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:16.240]  it sounded terrible but i mean i mean it's the same with every genre classical country rock and roll
[1:39:16.240 --> 1:39:22.400]  but particularly i don't know hard of really anybody else who when i listen to the music
[1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:28.800]  it sounds a hundred percent in my mind like i can't imagine it sounding uh any better with the beat
[1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:35.520]  your voice uh you know uh bringing in the the choir like you do with what would you do i mean
[1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:40.960]  just all of it so i mean i am really a fan just of your sound and then why it's a hundred percent
[1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:46.560]  then the message especially in some of those songs you did in that uh album after 9 11
[1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:50.960]  i mean that's why i say i think it's really the anthem for 9 11 truth i mean i like uh
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:54.560]  a mortal technique a lot of other folks and he's he's great and has a really great sound as well i
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:58.880]  just don't think that uh it's consistently as powerful uh as yours i mean i hate to i'm not
[1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:03.280]  trying to choose sides i'm just saying you know i mean i mean they're really only two real sides
[1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:10.320]  two so i like the difference between me and a more technique those aren't the choices you know
[1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:15.440]  but uh uh i appreciate that man really i do i just always said that i was going to make music
[1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:20.560]  that i wouldn't be ashamed of in a few years that's really kind of my litmus test like when i'm
[1:40:20.560 --> 1:40:24.960]  when i'm doing things i want to treat each project as though i'll never get the chance to do it again
[1:40:25.920 --> 1:40:30.880]  which is a you know that's pretty legitimate well that's how life really works that's how
[1:40:30.880 --> 1:40:37.600]  life really works now now shifting gears oh everything is nuanced in the world like i just
[1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:42.400]  had webster tarplin here with all the documents the united states funded the iranians to come to
[1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:48.960]  power gave them the weapons that's on record gates and brzezinski admit it now they're the guys
[1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:55.440]  behind obama and whereas i want to i mean i hate george bush called for his arrest you know terrorist
[1:40:55.440 --> 1:40:59.120]  and and and but you know people see this two dimensional like well well you're against bush
[1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:03.840]  you must be for obama or if i'm against obama i must be for mccain when i'm against mccain i'm
[1:41:03.840 --> 1:41:08.400]  saying no they're all bought and paid for but then i look at who will be able to carry the
[1:41:08.400 --> 1:41:14.480]  new world order agenda further who will neutralize the left to stand down and say uh you know yes
[1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:20.560]  to war yes to a police state and then who will actually pacify the public so the abuse of black
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:25.440]  people minorities everybody can continue and you know nine ten months ago i said oh i like obama
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:29.200]  he says he'll get us out of the war he won't spy on the american people without warrants
[1:41:29.200 --> 1:41:32.480]  and then now he's gone backs i mean i'm just setting the table here and then i want you to
[1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:37.200]  take a lot of time going over this and so now with horror i'm seeing this now whereas i like
[1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:41.520]  seeing people happy in relations being good and black folks i see everywhere really i mean you
[1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:45.920]  can see a visual you know feeling good hey white people aren't all racist they elected a black guy
[1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:50.400]  whereas i wish that was a good beautiful thing i know that in the end it's going to be a huge
[1:41:50.400 --> 1:41:55.840]  betrayal and it's going to be designed to actually make everybody in a way even blame black people
[1:41:55.840 --> 1:42:00.480]  in the end when brock obama is a new world order frontman now if you disagree that's fine
[1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:05.280]  but i mean break down i mean i've laid that out it's so nuanced and and and the public only
[1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:10.800]  sees it you know in shades of black and white pun intended where do you see this going you know just
[1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:20.160]  like in uh a mubai cia a masad mi6 are publicly funding the radical hindus the radical muslims
[1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:26.480]  bring them in so that they can get a radical group in control of india to then attack uh pakistan
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:30.800]  and i mean right there see that's nuanced i'm not against the hindus i'm not against the muslims
[1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:36.080]  i'm not against any i want them to see how through tribal control they're being manipulated
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:43.040]  well i'm hoping that's not the case i do i really do i hope that's not the case the one thing that
[1:42:43.040 --> 1:42:48.320]  that causes me to have great pause about obama is the fact that the establishment immediately
[1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:52.560]  embraced him when he came out that's the one thing that you know so this whole idea of him
[1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:59.280]  being an agent of change and some kind of a freedom fighter for social justice is pretty
[1:42:59.280 --> 1:43:07.120]  much scratched off the list for me um in terms of he being him being perhaps you know a lesser of
[1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:12.160]  many evils that's probably how i look at him at this point as a black man of course it it does
[1:43:12.160 --> 1:43:17.760]  make me feel good to see me being reflected in a position of power i'm not gonna lie about that
[1:43:17.760 --> 1:43:25.040]  but by the same token you know as a as a uh somebody that has progressive values man you know
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:28.640]  i am i am disheartened by some of the things that i've seen and some of the things that i've heard
[1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:34.080]  him say a lot of a lot of what he said during the campaign i wanted to chalk up to him needing to say
[1:43:34.880 --> 1:43:40.720]  to be able to get elected but now you know this whole idea of reaching across the aisle and you
[1:43:40.720 --> 1:43:46.480]  know i'm somebody who who has pretty hard left leaning positions man and and and i'm actually
[1:43:46.480 --> 1:43:52.720]  out for blood i don't want to reconcile with anybody you know i don't want to see um everything
[1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:57.200]  swept under the rug and everything be forgiven and you know us try to kind of forge this new
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:44:05.280]  path in this new direction with people who i am um you know are deadly opposed to i want to see
[1:44:05.280 --> 1:44:10.480]  things happen the right way for change and i you know whether or not he's going to be the one to
[1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:18.800]  do it it's still it's still you know uh we still don't know yet but i do know that i'm not in a
[1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:26.640]  reconciling move well um and i've seen the establishment say that obama will bring the people
[1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:32.720]  back to trusting the government and and then look at who he's appointing it's all the same
[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:37.600]  people yeah and that's yeah exactly now as far as the people trust in the government i don't know
[1:44:37.600 --> 1:44:45.360]  if that will ever happen again um i think that first of all this economy has to turn around if
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:49.360]  it is to turn around before anybody pays attention to what anybody in the government has to say
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:53.760]  but that's it paris this is a design and i want you to speak to this i have all the documents and
[1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:57.920]  i know you're a well-read guy and you've got an economics degree there uh but i mean what's
[1:44:57.920 --> 1:45:03.360]  happening is uh the people under clinton and and and the republican supported it's all one group
[1:45:03.360 --> 1:45:08.240]  they changed the uh glass deagle act they made the laws where the banks could do this they have
[1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:14.160]  designed this to implode markets so the establishment can then come in cut off liquidate everybody
[1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:19.120]  else have the real economy implode and the banks over capitalized in the quote bailout with now
[1:45:19.120 --> 1:45:25.600]  8.4 trillion as of december 5th 2008 and then buy up what's left of the real economy and obama
[1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:29.920]  is the biggest cheerleader for that and when the bailout wasn't about to happen he got up there
[1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:34.080]  and and and got on his bully pulpit and said we need this so that's what i'm saying paris so
[1:45:34.080 --> 1:45:39.280]  what are your feelings about this auto bailout then well i i mean i see it as a distraction
[1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:46.080]  because 25 billion 40 billion compared to 8.4 trillion according to bloomberg and ap in seven
[1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:51.280]  weeks uh you know the whole debate about should we bail the autos out that's a diversion but i'm
[1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:57.120]  against socialism but if we're going to uh uh uh devalue the currency and turn up the printing
[1:45:57.120 --> 1:46:02.400]  presses i just say give every american $50,000 that's basically what the safe point uh four
[1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:05.680]  trillion comes out to i just say give it directly to the people because we're the ones that are
[1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:11.440]  going to pay it back in taxes anyways interesting well i know they just came out with the job report
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:16.880]  today so something over at over half a million jobs lost today and that's almost two million
[1:46:16.880 --> 1:46:21.680]  jobs lost since january of this year so it's definitely rough out there exactly and it's
[1:46:21.680 --> 1:46:26.000]  accelerating so i mean specifically what i'm saying here is in studying the world what i do
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:31.760]  is i just go to what the truth is and and and i go to what the real policy reports of the elite say
[1:46:32.400 --> 1:46:38.800]  and then and then i go diametrically opposed to them and and so and so my job's easy so let's
[1:46:38.800 --> 1:46:42.240]  contrarian there you go well let's bring a woman i'm just against their agenda because i know their
[1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:47.680]  agenda is bad for humanity here's another one i'm not against the tens of millions of people
[1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:52.240]  by chase manhattan city bank displaced in mexico driven off their ancestral lands through phony
[1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:57.200]  environmental movements using the left to force them into mexico city then into the united states
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:01.360]  i don't blame them wanting a better life i am against them being abused i've gone out and
[1:47:01.360 --> 1:47:05.520]  protested out at the fema camp north of austin where they keep them without due process but at the
[1:47:05.520 --> 1:47:11.200]  same time i understand the globalist plan is to dissolve borders to drive down wages so paris
[1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:18.320]  shouldn't i be totally against something that is the cornerstone of the big banks against the united
[1:47:18.320 --> 1:47:24.800]  states see how that's nuanced which would be what well all i'm saying i don't mind immigration
[1:47:25.520 --> 1:47:28.720]  yes i mean i know you bring that up and that and that you know you're certainly against the
[1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:33.200]  oppression of these people but at the same time i'm i'm going to the next level and i know you
[1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:37.040]  can grasp all this you're probably smarter than i am i've been more successful in business than i am
[1:47:37.040 --> 1:47:42.720]  so so i'm asking you the question if the new world order wants open borders and then actually
[1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:48.080]  wants to stir americans up with third world populations they bring in to divide and conquer
[1:47:48.080 --> 1:47:52.480]  what should i do should i go along with what the big foundations and the money wants to divide
[1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:56.400]  and conquer i just know that it's easy to scapegoat a population and i know that that this plays
[1:47:56.400 --> 1:48:02.800]  directly into the hands of america's racist legacy i agree you know so just in in in terms of looking
[1:48:02.800 --> 1:48:09.680]  at a particular group of people and and you know kind of galvanizing this this uh jota plumber
[1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:15.360]  public against them i'm i'm opposed to that now in terms of what the end result is going to be
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:20.480]  like this this this solution of borders and i'm i don't know if i even look into it that far
[1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:27.200]  i understand you know um you know from where i'm sitting i see a a group of people who want a
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:35.360]  better life who you know are uh pretty much the kind of the end result of america's foreign
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:42.160]  policy of um economically the bribing people and you know so when you see people who want to come
[1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:47.840]  here to kind of do from what they think anywhere because i've got first of all i don't necessarily
[1:48:47.840 --> 1:48:51.440]  know that america gives you the better life let me say that out the gate because i've traveled a
[1:48:51.440 --> 1:48:57.760]  bunch of other places where things seem to be a lot easier and a lot more people and uh they're
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:04.480]  not least from at least right now they're not in uh any kind of danger of being invaded by america
[1:49:04.480 --> 1:49:09.440]  let me throw this in i don't know paris paris let me throw this in here talk about nuance that's
[1:49:09.440 --> 1:49:13.280]  what i'm saying every as you know everything is five or six i don't think that anything occurs on
[1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:18.080]  the global stage by chance well this is what i'm saying exactly but i want your take on this i want
[1:49:18.080 --> 1:49:21.040]  your take on this and we'll come back and talk about after the break and we're going to plug
[1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:25.440]  your new record and the website and the rest of which is great stuff okay exactly they are announcing
[1:49:25.440 --> 1:49:29.840]  they're going to put 20 000 us troops on the streets of america the army document says it's
[1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:34.480]  going to be against the american people for civil insurrection but then they put out public press
[1:49:34.480 --> 1:49:40.160]  releases that it's going to be stopping the illegal aliens on the border but i know because
[1:49:40.160 --> 1:49:43.760]  they already did that two years ago that that stage and they're not even going to do that
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:50.960]  so you're right it's nuance they are using it as a stereotype catch all false galvanization
[1:49:50.960 --> 1:49:57.280]  to get people to rally around accepting a police state i guess so so what what are you are you
[1:49:57.280 --> 1:50:01.040]  thinking that there's going to be some kind of a national event that really
[1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:05.360]  brings us immigration debate to the surface because honestly that's that's kind of been
[1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:11.280]  squash lately i haven't heard that a lot i know that people become more intolerant as economic
[1:50:11.280 --> 1:50:17.280]  times get harder i know that well listen we'll get your take on this when we get back um i'm
[1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:23.680]  in out of fully made my point my point is yes they work both sides is it we'll be right back it's

[1:54:06.160 --> 1:54:13.920]  is that yes the the global architects do all these evil things the name of america and
[1:54:13.920 --> 1:54:18.000]  oppressed populations then they go in with ford foundation money and others and we have the
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:22.080]  Carnegie documents and all of it on this congressional hearings and then they foment
[1:54:22.080 --> 1:54:28.160]  rebellion and and and then basically you know the average white guy you know uh you know taken
[1:54:28.160 --> 1:54:32.320]  his you know two-year-old for a walk down the street gets the blame as the evil new world
[1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:36.480]  order mastermind and and you know just like uh you know black guys get blamed for supposedly
[1:54:36.480 --> 1:54:40.640]  being murderers because people think oj did something you know it it's this lowest common
[1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:48.000]  denominator and and yes they're going to use uh the huge uh social crises of 30 million people
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:51.840]  in this country you know who'll work for almost nothing uh you know because of what was done
[1:54:51.840 --> 1:54:56.800]  to mexico by our own government by the globalist uh they then come in here and the government
[1:54:56.800 --> 1:55:02.480]  then uses that the name of going after them to actually oppress the entire population that was
[1:55:02.480 --> 1:55:09.200]  the point i was trying to make oh yeah well i got you in that regard i got you man this uh
[1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:15.840]  it as a rule of thumb i take a contrarian stance when it comes to what the government has to say
[1:55:15.840 --> 1:55:21.040]  to you know when i'm told something of a particular way i choose to look at it to the other way to
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:26.560]  just based on the history you know based on the history of oppression based on the policies and
[1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:32.080]  how they've affected people over the over time so yeah i know you know there's a lot going on
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:36.160]  we've got about 30 minutes left with you and instead of uh instead of myself sitting here
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:41.920]  guiding the interview what do you want to get into now paris i actually i i looked to come on your
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:46.480]  show to have you got the interview oh absolutely absolutely i mean i i mean what i'm saying is
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:50.480]  i've got i've got a million questions but is there anything really eating at you right now
[1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:54.080]  something you want to you know tell millions of people and nothing that you haven't heard
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:56:04.080]  over and over and over again you know um i you know i'm always just just uh i feel good to be
[1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:08.720]  in the presence of people who feel the same for change you know ordinarily when i do interviews
[1:56:08.720 --> 1:56:14.560]  i come on and and you know that there's a there's a pretty strong chance that there'll be adversarial
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:19.840]  you know and and to know that i can be a part of a community where people do question what the
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:25.680]  government has to say where people look at uh uh you know the events that have taken place
[1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:32.160]  on the day of 9 11 and everything that's occurred since 9 11 and can digest that and know exactly
[1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:37.440]  what's happening i mean it feels good to be a part of that community really well it absolutely and
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:41.600]  we all are you know together in our fight for liberty and speaking of that we're about to come
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:47.440]  back and start the next hour uh you know as being what i would call a a black leader not just you
[1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:53.120]  know a uh leader of folks that want freedom but particularly a black leader uh i mean here's an
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:58.000]  example i see on the new york daily news right that they're grabbing black children the cps is
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:02.960]  in testing pesticide on them till they die and then i ask why aren't black leaders talking about that
[1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:09.280]  so i don't think anybody knows about that that's my first time hearing of it so there you go the
[1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:13.920]  problem is is that people don't know about it it's not it's disinformation there's a lot of
[1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:18.400]  disinformation out there but there's also just a lot of lack of information you know a lot of
[1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:22.400]  people don't know where to turn and most people do get their news i mean you know most people do get
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:30.240]  their information you know wrong as it often is from tv nobody reads you know that i mean it
[1:57:30.240 --> 1:57:35.440]  wouldn't be so easy to pull the wool over america's eyes uh if people read more what is it nine percent

[2:00:04.800 --> 2:00:10.480]  the last time i had you on the show yeah you're also branching out into film making and and producing
[2:00:10.480 --> 2:00:16.800]  films and distributing films are quite a uh eclectic uh group of films the last time i checked
[2:00:17.520 --> 2:00:23.360]  yes yeah that's that's the next uh that's the final frontier for me is to uh branch out of just
[2:00:23.360 --> 2:00:28.400]  doing music alone start start doing films and you know putting out messages in the visual medium
[2:00:28.400 --> 2:00:34.960]  the first uh project is called sounds like a revolution and it'll be out uh third quarter
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:42.080]  of next year and it's really it's a film about um you know musicians who who want to make a difference
[2:00:42.080 --> 2:00:50.800]  and and kind of details the consequences uh that we've all faced uh as a result of of our beliefs
[2:00:50.800 --> 2:01:00.480]  in you know this post-911 environment where um you know dissent is stifled and the media outlets
[2:01:00.480 --> 2:01:09.600]  that we have come to rely upon self-censor um it features me and uh uh michael franti and antiflag
[2:01:09.600 --> 2:01:17.600]  and the dixie chicks are in it um henry roland's uh the coup uh i believe it's going to be
[2:01:17.600 --> 2:01:24.080]  narrated by eric abadu was pretty involved under yeah so that's one of them you know another one
[2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:29.520]  is called nation building which is kind of along the same lines but it's more hip hop centric
[2:01:30.320 --> 2:01:36.080]  and uh you know there are some other films that are kind of already in stages various stages of
[2:01:36.080 --> 2:01:42.640]  completion i don't really want to start films from from the beginning i know when you make your
[2:01:42.640 --> 2:01:47.680]  films you pretty much do it from start to end i'm looking really to buy into existing films
[2:01:47.680 --> 2:01:52.800]  now i understand and that's great let's see if people kind of haven't you know uh they they're
[2:01:53.440 --> 2:02:00.080]  they can't you know finish them because of economics let's let's uh shift gears uh now now
[2:02:00.080 --> 2:02:05.120]  should perspective filmmakers run stuff by should they email you at guerrilla funker yeah absolutely
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:11.840]  yep please do and please do and you're gonna be putting these out on go ahead um well because
[2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:17.360]  ordinarily you know people who uh who are making films most most people who are independent filmmakers
[2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:23.600]  you know have money issues so if they can send that send send their uh you know their their films
[2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:28.160]  and whatever stage of completion that they're in to us you know i'll review it and see if we can
[2:02:28.160 --> 2:02:33.200]  fit it into what we're doing over here and of course the message has to be consistent and um
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:39.920]  you know my film deal is actually with vivendi through universal and the record side is through
[2:02:39.920 --> 2:02:45.200]  fontana universal well that is exciting uh so folks can do it but i'm alex jones films out

[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:56.400]  the last eight months and i i just couldn't give uh your great offer a proper consideration so
[2:02:56.400 --> 2:03:02.800]  i apologize but but hopefully in the future we could we can do something but um now now uh
[2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:06.880]  paris uh we're about to break and come back in a long segments don't be all these breaks in front

[2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:22.480]  got added to mtv which was which was kind of a surprise because the video is is is pretty much
[2:03:22.480 --> 2:03:30.240]  a kind of a uh a very visual interpretation of the people rising up and overthrowing the government
[2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:38.640]  um the uh the uh album is available uh everywhere online for sure um you know i have

[2:03:48.240 --> 2:03:54.000]  online you can go anywhere um the other thing that's interesting about this project in particular
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:04:00.720]  is that there is a scholarship and housing contest that i'm offering in it kind of as a
[2:04:00.720 --> 2:04:05.920]  golden ticket type of a contest where there are three chances to win ten thousand dollars towards

[2:04:23.680 --> 2:04:28.080]  back ladies and gentlemen stay with us hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a
[2:04:28.080 --> 2:04:32.240]  long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need
[2:04:32.240 --> 2:04:36.720]  to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line
[2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:40.880]  if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for femen and take
[2:04:40.880 --> 2:04:45.840]  care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good
[2:04:45.840 --> 2:04:50.560]  old boy bailout for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off
[2:04:50.560 --> 2:04:55.120]  the telephones and email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of
[2:04:55.120 --> 2:05:00.240]  thin air this money now owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now
[2:05:00.240 --> 2:05:05.440]  guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly
[2:05:05.440 --> 2:05:10.720]  food beyond many americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of
[2:05:10.720 --> 2:05:16.480]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so
[2:05:16.480 --> 2:05:21.520]  fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government
[2:05:21.520 --> 2:05:26.080]  are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[2:05:26.080 --> 2:05:31.040]  but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be
[2:05:31.040 --> 2:05:35.840]  ready everything is zeroing it on food one third of americans have to choose between buying food
[2:05:35.840 --> 2:05:40.800]  and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient
[2:05:40.800 --> 2:05:44.880]  get food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand that by having
[2:05:44.880 --> 2:05:49.280]  a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so
[2:05:49.280 --> 2:05:54.160]  it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care of your
[2:05:54.160 --> 2:05:58.960]  family in the final equation but you you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable

[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:25.280]  paris continuing our discussion about activism and media you know universal approaching you
[2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:30.480]  getting your stuff out that way more and more alternative powerful anti-establishment information
[2:08:30.480 --> 2:08:35.280]  is being allowed out because the old media as you know the establishment media is having trouble
[2:08:35.280 --> 2:08:41.200]  selling their tired old propaganda their products and it's kind of if you can't beat them join them
[2:08:41.840 --> 2:08:46.320]  i'm seeing this everywhere where even you know i am accepted and not on big national tv shows but
[2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:52.720]  on mainline radio international media by liberal conservative journals they're having to admit
[2:08:52.720 --> 2:08:56.720]  that everything i talked about you talked about and others talked about is coming true can you
[2:08:56.720 --> 2:09:02.960]  speak to that the fact that that this struggle of awakening i really see a chance of us turning
[2:09:02.960 --> 2:09:09.520]  the corner here yeah well i agree with you i think that um you know at least in at least
[2:09:09.520 --> 2:09:17.040]  in in in my experiences it's it's amazing like i went on hannity and calms and and i was being
[2:09:17.040 --> 2:09:23.280]  broadcast from a satellite i guess you know i guess a satellite feed in san francisco because
[2:09:23.280 --> 2:09:30.000]  i'm from the bay area out here in california and uh the people that worked at fox knew the music and
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:34.800]  were warm man and and and really embraced the message and they were like man we can't stand
[2:09:34.800 --> 2:09:40.400]  working here which was which was not what i expected i've had seeing in fox people behind the scenes
[2:09:40.400 --> 2:09:44.400]  tell me the same thing i've had i've had host calling me at the office after i was on a few
[2:09:44.400 --> 2:09:49.840]  times and saying we got record ratings the last two days you were on uh but but you are now banned
[2:09:49.840 --> 2:09:55.360]  this wasn't from programming this was from the business office from the board said do not put
[2:09:55.360 --> 2:10:00.640]  him back on so exactly we've got the people on the inside more than anybody know and it's all staged
[2:10:00.640 --> 2:10:06.080]  yeah and they you know and and and people just appreciate appreciate it when somebody comes
[2:10:06.080 --> 2:10:11.520]  out you know like you or me comes out and says what needs to be said and and and can can uh
[2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:15.920]  put out material that people can relate to man that reflects their real-life existence
[2:10:15.920 --> 2:10:21.680]  i think that the the the success that i've had is that i've really kind of taken pains to endear
[2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:27.760]  myself to the public so that people understand that i really do care you know i mean this is not
[2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:33.200]  this is not like a a fast track to riches doing what we do by any stretch of the oh you've got
[2:10:33.200 --> 2:10:37.520]  incredible talent and had plenty of chances to sell out and i'm not saying i've got some great talent
[2:10:37.520 --> 2:10:41.920]  but i've been approached i mean i've been approached many times but um you know this is this is
[2:10:41.920 --> 2:10:46.640]  like uh this is taking the hard road you know and uh and and sticking with it and remaining
[2:10:46.640 --> 2:10:50.560]  consistent man that's just kind of been my focus does that make it that much sweeter to be as
[2:10:50.560 --> 2:10:56.160]  successful as you are over and over again uh taking the uh taking the road being self-made
[2:10:56.160 --> 2:11:01.520]  creating your own distribution system everything you did oh of course i mean being able to do
[2:11:01.520 --> 2:11:05.520]  what i want to do kind of when i want to do it and you know to work with the people that i want
[2:11:05.520 --> 2:11:10.640]  to work with because i'm at the stage in my career now where you know i don't i don't want to uh
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:16.800]  do just anything obviously i think the lowest point in my career was producing a tony braxton
[2:11:16.800 --> 2:11:22.720]  record i don't know if you know that but it was like i was going through the motions man you know
[2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:27.920]  and and the music was like uh something you would hear in the dentist's office and you know to me
[2:11:27.920 --> 2:11:33.760]  music is only really engaging when it moves you you know emotionally well your music certainly
[2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:39.440]  moves me i'm i see it more as poetry uh with the music in the background really well thank you
[2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:45.360]  right speaking of the way the world's changing you know i witnessed urban warfare trips in the
[2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:49.760]  marines and army training to take over our cities arrest our citizens confiscate our guns
[2:11:50.320 --> 2:11:54.480]  and that was the really the wake-up call for me in 96 97 when i physically saw this
[2:11:55.120 --> 2:11:59.280]  and it always heard the stories but then found out it was true and now they're announcing yeah
[2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:04.880]  troops on the streets of america the governors won't be in charge uh the the executive branch is
[2:12:04.880 --> 2:12:09.280]  above congress congress was threatened seven weeks ago with marshal law uh if they didn't go along
[2:12:09.280 --> 2:12:14.640]  with the bank or takeover bill uh and i mean i mean it's i think one reason people are waking up
[2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:20.240]  now is because it is it is late in the game and and the establishment is really i mean the queen
[2:12:20.240 --> 2:12:24.400]  of england just abolished the parliament in canada because they were about to throw her people out
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:29.440]  and said i am the head of state and then pulled out her director general that's in roiders who
[2:12:29.440 --> 2:12:34.240]  really is the dictator and so they're even having to admit now that commonwealth nations never got
[2:12:34.240 --> 2:12:41.680]  off him under the queen that's in roiders today hmm interesting can you speak specifically just to
[2:12:41.680 --> 2:12:49.200]  the expanding police state well yeah well you know that the for example the uh the uh patriot act
[2:12:49.200 --> 2:12:52.800]  is not going to be repealed i know that a lot of people thought that that was going to be the case
[2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:57.120]  when obama came into power and there was going to be like this large cash infusion in the social
[2:12:57.120 --> 2:13:02.320]  programs and you know an immediate pull out of iraq and that kind of stuff and it's unrealistic
[2:13:02.320 --> 2:13:06.160]  to think that that would be the case you know they just said troops for three more years are going to
[2:13:06.160 --> 2:13:13.920]  be there oh really yeah they just said yesterday uh three more years and uh of the main force of
[2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:20.640]  160 000 and uh then a permanent force of 50 000 basically forever i think the way that we can frame
[2:13:20.640 --> 2:13:26.240]  this moving forward is to look at this this economic downturn which is which is probably the worst in
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:35.920]  this country's history it will be yep um as being the 2008 2009 9 11 financial 9 11 i agree there you
[2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:40.880]  go and so when you look at it that way and you look at you know you say you say a traumatized
[2:13:40.880 --> 2:13:46.640]  mind is a susceptible mind like you can you can mold public perception and and have the public
[2:13:46.640 --> 2:13:51.200]  be behind whatever you want them to be behind when they're traumatized you can look at this this
[2:13:51.200 --> 2:13:56.320]  this economic violence being visited on the american people as having the same effect as 9 11
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:02.800]  well again oh i don't even blame obama he is a complete and total puppet i'm sorry to tell
[2:14:02.800 --> 2:14:06.880]  folks just like every other president since kennedy but he is going to end up they're not
[2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:11.200]  going to blame all this on bush even though he's a puppet as well that's what i'm saying paris
[2:14:11.200 --> 2:14:15.680]  they're going to set him up uh the people really believe he's going to bring change and change
[2:14:15.680 --> 2:14:19.760]  things uh it's like bill hicks said the you know they basically take the president and show him
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:24.720]  the subruder film and then say any questions and and so that's my whole point is i want people to
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:28.480]  get it out of their heads that there's going to be any change other than the fact that this guy
[2:14:28.480 --> 2:14:33.360]  can string a sentence together and bush couldn't and this guy is eloquent and you know and has a
[2:14:33.360 --> 2:14:39.120]  nice smile uh yeah i mean he's so it's not as insulting to have obama because you know he is
[2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:43.360]  slick and smart compared to bush up there it's kind of insulting to have this you know monkey up
[2:14:43.360 --> 2:14:48.320]  there every day so with obama it's going to be a lot better but that's it in packaging i mean i
[2:14:48.320 --> 2:14:52.000]  guess they're going to kind of dress themselves up when they rape us instead of you know doing it
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:57.360]  would just get no clothes on and we're both pessimists so you know i can't even say that
[2:14:57.360 --> 2:15:02.400]  i'm cautiously optimistic anymore i'm just a pessimist about the whole thing and you know
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:07.120]  hopefully i'll be proven wrong but chances are i won't be and we'll both still be doing this
[2:15:07.120 --> 2:15:12.240]  a few years from now you know when i can do party music and you can make comedy then we'll all be
[2:15:12.240 --> 2:15:20.080]  cool man i you know actually i would love to make weird documentaries uh you know about
[2:15:22.080 --> 2:15:26.160]  subcultures and things and and i'd love to make you know things about nature i'd love
[2:15:26.160 --> 2:15:31.760]  to make documentaries about whales i like whales i like you know who's in there running the shows
[2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:35.680]  looking at me where did you know that there's a whale called the uh bowhead whale that lives
[2:15:35.680 --> 2:15:41.360]  about 250 years i do now i mean that i'm looking at my guy and they're looking at me like i'm
[2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:46.160]  weird oh like well no man i that's not weird man you think i you think i hate to say this
[2:15:46.160 --> 2:15:50.160]  because it's helically shaped what you think outside the box and i do too man i you know
[2:15:50.160 --> 2:15:55.520]  there's very little in in mainstream media that speaks to me you know and that's why i stay in
[2:15:55.520 --> 2:15:59.600]  my lane doing what i do well i mean the point i was making is that i have all these other thoughts
[2:15:59.600 --> 2:16:03.440]  and all the other things but you feel like that you know you don't want to waste time with any of
[2:16:03.440 --> 2:16:08.080]  that when there are more urgent things to discuss exactly that's the point is actually i'm sick of
[2:16:08.080 --> 2:16:13.520]  this but the fire in my belly just drives me to do it because i have no future if i don't my family
[2:16:13.520 --> 2:16:19.280]  has no future and so i'm kind of mad like my life's been stolen in a way hey well yeah and then
[2:16:19.280 --> 2:16:24.880]  that happens once you become enlightened that's the truth is it's difficult to sit by and just
[2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:30.640]  you know uh take what's spoon fair to you when you know better exactly i mean that's the point
[2:16:30.640 --> 2:16:34.640]  that i've been making for quite a while now when you know better man and none of this is acceptable
[2:16:34.640 --> 2:16:39.200]  well that's it i mean i would love to take three vacations a year and spend more time with my
[2:16:39.200 --> 2:16:44.560]  family right and i want to and i can't disengage because there's always a hundred more stories
[2:16:44.560 --> 2:16:49.280]  a hundred more crimes a thousand of course it's driving me nuts and somebody gotta keep
[2:16:49.280 --> 2:16:55.200]  the torch burning so there it is you have this network set up man don't waste it that's how i
[2:16:55.200 --> 2:16:59.520]  look at it i'm now finally in the driver's seat to be able to reach people globally doing what i do
[2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:04.400]  in a way that is a little bit more comfortable than it's been in the past because i have this
[2:17:04.400 --> 2:17:08.880]  this uh relationship with universal where they manufacture and they distribute everything so
[2:17:08.880 --> 2:17:14.560]  you know i i treat it very seriously and i treat each project as though you know i won't as though
[2:17:14.560 --> 2:17:18.400]  it's my last well you know people always look at folks that have been somewhat successful
[2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:21.760]  and it's like even though we're doing good work sometimes they get mad at us and i just say to
[2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:27.120]  them hey i want to see you do well get in there do the decades of hard work and because but
[2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:31.040]  so many people come into this uh the enlightenment movement or whatever you want to call it and they
[2:17:31.040 --> 2:17:36.880]  want instant success does life work that way uh usually uh paris well i you gotta work for it
[2:17:36.880 --> 2:17:41.920]  like anything else but i do know this i do know that you know there are a lot more there are there
[2:17:41.920 --> 2:17:47.280]  a lot of hip hop artists and musical um you know personalities that i want to work with that are
[2:17:47.280 --> 2:17:52.320]  whose abilities i really respect but more often than not what they have to say doesn't doesn't
[2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:58.480]  job but what i'm doing you know it's like you can't you can't make messages that are degrading to
[2:17:58.480 --> 2:18:03.680]  people and come out on guerrilla fuck you just can't do it well and again let's talk about that in
[2:18:03.680 --> 2:18:08.720]  the final segment it's come out as you know in documents and programs that the establishment
[2:18:08.720 --> 2:18:14.560]  wants to put out this degrading message not just in hip hop or rap but in rock and roll and everything
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:19.840]  and that's been done by design the cia has been involved in that uh and so that's why you see this
[2:18:19.840 --> 2:18:24.560]  degrading materialistic mindlessness and that's why it's so refreshing to see what you're doing

[2:23:44.240 --> 2:23:49.120]  groundwork hit the barbed wire for everybody else in this fight in this war and so now the public
[2:23:49.120 --> 2:23:56.320]  is very receptive paris you know going into break i didn't write a note what was the point i said i
[2:23:56.320 --> 2:23:59.440]  was going to ask you when we came back it was something really important you know i have no
[2:23:59.440 --> 2:24:04.480]  idea either i don't either it'll as soon as you leave it'll pop back in my head but i had some
[2:24:04.480 --> 2:24:08.320]  really important question to ask you but hell it doesn't matter i'm busy running around behind the
[2:24:08.320 --> 2:24:15.040]  scenes lining up a bunch of other stuff um in closing i mean there's so much going on out there
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:19.600]  where do you see things going in the future with so many people waking up
[2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:28.160]  uh you know that who knows who knows man i can only hope that it doesn't it doesn't get violent
[2:24:28.160 --> 2:24:32.400]  and bloody and out of control you know i know that that's probably that's probably an optimistic
[2:24:32.400 --> 2:24:36.880]  statement right there i know that uh things have to change you know i know that all the
[2:24:36.880 --> 2:24:40.720]  wealth can't be maintained by you know such a small portion of the population i know that
[2:24:41.360 --> 2:24:46.240]  things can't remain as unequal as they've been i know that times are harder than they've ever
[2:24:46.240 --> 2:24:50.000]  been and i know that people are going through it man and and you know there are all of these
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  artificial things in place to keep people in line to keep sheep like sheep sheeple in line
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:25:01.040]  you know uh you know kind of lockstep with what the government has going on or what the
[2:25:01.040 --> 2:25:06.000]  agenda is and you know people are waking up the only real way to make them wake up though is by
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:13.280]  doing what we do by hitting them with with information and and uh entertainment sources
[2:25:13.280 --> 2:25:18.480]  is that provide information that goes against the grain of what they see on tv all day long
[2:25:18.480 --> 2:25:21.760]  absolutely i remember what it was it was uh this is a great segue here at the end
[2:25:22.880 --> 2:25:29.360]  government wanting to push mtv in the past choosing what it wanted to push oh right uh i uh
[2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:33.840]  you know talk to so many people in the music industry who say you know something that that
[2:25:33.840 --> 2:25:40.080]  is unpopular but anti-human anti-liberating anti-woman man uh the establishment will push that
[2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:44.960]  while trying to block things that are socially responsible but we've seen that happen in hip
[2:25:44.960 --> 2:25:49.120]  hop alone i mean if i just take hip hop i mean because that's that's obviously my genre and
[2:25:49.120 --> 2:25:53.520]  that's what i started in when i first started in the early 90s the groups were you know me and
[2:25:53.520 --> 2:25:57.920]  public enemy and boogie down productions x clan and all of these groups that reflected
[2:25:57.920 --> 2:26:04.080]  this afrocentric um sensibility that wanted to see the community advance right it wasn't
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:08.160]  an anti-white sensibility it was it was something that we're really wanted to see people do better
[2:26:08.160 --> 2:26:15.600]  overall and that those those types of messages have been squashed for the most part and and
[2:26:15.600 --> 2:26:20.640]  you know the the the rise against the rap you know we see a direct correlation between the
[2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:26.000]  messages and then the outcomes in our community which just prepares the black males to go into
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:32.400]  the president's system of course exactly exactly you know that's big business you know in the same
[2:26:32.400 --> 2:26:35.520]  way that there are college towns and i'll have to tell you where your listeners is but in the same
[2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:39.920]  way that there are college towns there are towns where the entire you know economy is driven by
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:46.320]  prison well take to lia texas where they arrested 56 black people in one month none of them with
[2:26:46.320 --> 2:26:50.720]  drugs with no evidence because the only business in that town was a prison and they put the black
[2:26:50.720 --> 2:26:55.760]  people on the town in the prison there you go and it turned out it was all a setup turned out it was
[2:26:55.760 --> 2:27:01.760]  none of them were using drugs yep yep but when you see you know and like like you see you know
[2:27:01.760 --> 2:27:06.000]  you see the same thing with with any corporate enterprise now that's really large like there's
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:12.960]  certain towns that i've been to for example in uh i have in-laws in north carolina and walmart is
[2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:18.640]  the main employer in some of these small cities you know boarsville statesville north carolina
[2:27:18.640 --> 2:27:23.520]  those kind of spots you know um where the walmart is huge man you might see a walmart that's you
[2:27:23.520 --> 2:27:29.840]  know hundreds of thousands of square feet and i have walmart social events and you know calendar
[2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:34.880]  what basically your entire life is dictated by this corporation that's that's who has taken over
[2:27:34.880 --> 2:27:40.320]  the market with chinese slave goods and you know and you know mom and pop you know mom and pop
[2:27:40.320 --> 2:27:45.360]  enterprise man depending on what it is it's a hard sell right now well that's why it's important
[2:27:45.360 --> 2:27:51.040]  to support alternative music film uh farmers markets anything alternative anything that's

[2:34:09.840 --> 2:34:16.640]  of theirs um now this is a guy uh named kori shaw from a company called bill destroy down in la
[2:34:16.640 --> 2:34:21.760]  does a world-class work i mean this video is oh this blows away the m&m video i mean i'm

[2:34:35.360 --> 2:34:39.200]  since you mentioned it i i'm really honored that you were offered to put me on the universal label
[2:34:39.200 --> 2:34:42.800]  and i was just looking at the contracts that were a great deal best of all i've ever been offered and
[2:34:42.800 --> 2:34:46.720]  i just uh didn't even i was trying to finish something having a new baby and it didn't matter
[2:34:46.720 --> 2:34:50.000]  but i wanted to since i couldn't talk to you behind the scenes i wanted to apologize for not
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:53.200]  getting on the ball with that but i'll work on that paris and i've been honored to talk to you
[2:34:53.200 --> 2:34:57.680]  everybody get acid reflex and we'll talk to you soon my friend i appreciate it man thank you i'm
[2:34:57.680 --> 2:35:02.560]  honored to be here take care all right there he goes ladies and gentlemen uh yeah great guy
[2:35:02.560 --> 2:35:07.840]  like i trust paris but i'm a little bit scaredy universal and that's just one of the many offers
[2:35:07.840 --> 2:35:13.440]  i've had uh and he brought it up earlier so i went ahead and talked about it uh i mean i probably had
[2:35:15.360 --> 2:35:20.960]  60 70 offers in the last 10 years i mean i've i i have been in the office in the big glistening
[2:35:20.960 --> 2:35:26.480]  building in la offered a radio show to be as big as rushland ball with the contract in front of me
[2:35:27.040 --> 2:35:30.720]  but in that case i had to be controlled what i said and i said no with the paris thing whatever i
[2:35:30.720 --> 2:35:35.200]  wanted say whatever i wanted and i knew it would put it you know really out there in a big way
[2:35:35.200 --> 2:35:38.960]  and i've tried some other distributions or another outfit who's a lot smaller and that that was all
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:45.040]  right uh it's just that then i can't put them out for free i can't say make copies i can't leave it
[2:35:45.040 --> 2:35:50.320]  up on google video and so i you know turned down tens of millions of dollars that's just how it works
[2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:55.920]  here folks and then i get screamed at and yelled at for trying to sell a few thousand copies myself
[2:35:55.920 --> 2:36:01.280]  to be able to maybe make a film and the films do lose money i pay for stuff with advertising
[2:36:01.280 --> 2:36:05.680]  and i pay for it uh you know a few other ways i got a small inheritance a few years ago i really
[2:36:05.680 --> 2:36:11.200]  want to know side issue but it doesn't burn me it doesn't get my crawl i feel sorry for people
[2:36:11.920 --> 2:36:15.040]  that have no idea how many deals i've turned down and what i've turned down
[2:36:15.840 --> 2:36:20.160]  you have no idea folks i mean most people say they wouldn't sell out and i might say that would
[2:36:20.160 --> 2:36:28.160]  be that if i did it with paris uh it's just that uh i can't even if something might have some of
[2:36:28.160 --> 2:36:35.440]  that involved or or or might lead down a road because to me the fact that i put out 21 films
[2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:41.840]  the fact that i've made 20 myself and and i've made 19 and produced two no i've made 20 and produced
[2:36:41.840 --> 2:36:48.640]  two uh the fact that uh they reach hundreds of millions online for free that that we contract
[2:36:49.760 --> 2:36:57.280]  that is what i want instead of money that's what i want and uh the death threats everything that
[2:36:57.280 --> 2:37:02.640]  come with it uh and that would have brought all pretty much ended if i uh if i did that so that
[2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:08.240]  so it wasn't selling out that i refused because i could whatever i wanted i could say uh it was
[2:37:08.240 --> 2:37:13.520]  that uh it would be a sellout because the video wouldn't be available everywhere but and but that
[2:37:13.520 --> 2:37:17.120]  that's universals and i shouldn't even be getting into it but he brought it up on there so cat's
[2:37:17.120 --> 2:37:23.680]  out of the bag on that um i'm actually a pretty darn good guys the whole point here folks i mean
[2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:29.360]  i don't know anybody else uh even in this movement i won't take questionable advertising
[2:37:29.360 --> 2:37:34.880]  i won't be involved in any of this stuff um because it doesn't mean anything to me who i am
[2:37:34.880 --> 2:37:39.360]  is what is valuable what i stand for what i believe in i mean i know they've approached
[2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:44.080]  alternative news people alternative health people wanting to buy them out uh and i know a lot of
[2:37:44.080 --> 2:37:48.720]  people out there have said no because you know what they're not going to be involved in poisoning
[2:37:48.720 --> 2:37:53.440]  children but a lot of people will sell out and that's why we've seen a lot of these things happen
[2:37:53.440 --> 2:37:59.200]  uh but that's a side issue they're separately uh paris is somebody who never sold out and has
[2:37:59.200 --> 2:38:03.840]  made it big repeatedly all right i apologize to uh jeffrey r smith we're making him hold five minutes
[2:38:03.840 --> 2:38:08.000]  we're really honored to have him and i've got his bio here but uh i hate to make folks talk
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:11.680]  about themselves but it's better if you just describe yourself and introduce yourself we
[2:38:11.680 --> 2:38:16.400]  we carry some of your amazing books and videos seeds of deception genetically engineered foods
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:22.320]  by jeffrey m smith he calling him r smith i'm out of my mind today and uh genetic roulette

[2:38:35.680 --> 2:38:40.480]  m smith good to have you back with us thank you very much alec great to be here good to have
[2:38:40.480 --> 2:38:45.680]  you here you know i never asked you this have you ever been approached to sell out no i haven't
[2:38:45.680 --> 2:38:50.880]  i i've often thought if my friend is willing to give me millions of dollars to stop talking about
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:57.120]  him i could just funnel that into anti-gmo activities and maybe i'd sell out but no i have
[2:38:57.120 --> 2:39:02.400]  never been asked to sell out in any in any form well that's when you know the new world order
[2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:09.760]  is real buddy when they come at you over and over again uh so far so far i protected myself in fact
[2:39:09.760 --> 2:39:13.920]  i i knew that other people that had written books before i published seeds of deception
[2:39:13.920 --> 2:39:17.440]  some friends of mine published a book against the grain they're about to publish it in three
[2:39:17.440 --> 2:39:22.240]  days before it came off the printer a threatening letter from montan to the attorney forced the
[2:39:22.240 --> 2:39:27.360]  publisher to stop the presses and cancel the publication so they were eventually able to
[2:39:27.360 --> 2:39:32.320]  print it printed somewhere else but i decided to turn down an offer for by a publisher to
[2:39:32.320 --> 2:39:36.960]  publish my books but i could publish it myself because i knew that they couldn't stop me see
[2:39:36.960 --> 2:39:42.000]  also didn't let them yeah that's why i haven't gone with with big film production companies
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:46.240]  that wanted to bring in professional teams all those folks and do tv series and a bunch of other
[2:39:46.240 --> 2:39:52.000]  stuff folks don't know about because exactly by signing on to that then it brings other people
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:56.960]  into control and then and then you could lose control yeah there's a lot of people that've
[2:39:56.960 --> 2:40:01.840]  been wanting to uh option my first book feed the deception for a film but i'm very cautious
[2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:07.200]  about you know losing the control because they might just flip it so that it may may make
[2:40:07.200 --> 2:40:10.800]  uh montan throughout to be benevolent well that happened to jesse ventura i think he got like
[2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:15.600]  three million bucks to do a year tv show and msnbc was a three-year contract a couple million a year
[2:40:15.600 --> 2:40:19.040]  i'm going from memory here when he told me in the car and he's also talked about here on air some
[2:40:19.040 --> 2:40:23.840]  but when he was here visiting us and uh they didn't tell him you know it had golden handcuffs in
[2:40:23.840 --> 2:40:27.680]  there but he you know he he and they said right after he signed it it's like all right now you're
[2:40:27.680 --> 2:40:32.000]  out of the game for the war we're about to have and they just basically bought his contract out
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  and he sat there for three years and then that's why he finally now was able to go public in the
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:41.040]  last year and a half because that contract was up saying he could do no other media so i mean they
[2:40:41.040 --> 2:40:48.080]  do it yeah it's true what i do is um i try like you're getting information out there on on youtube
[2:40:48.080 --> 2:40:55.760]  and on my my website in fact uh just uh four weeks ago i got an email from india saying that
[2:40:55.760 --> 2:41:00.560]  they found that the genetically engineered bt cotton is causing massive deaths and reproductive
[2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:06.800]  failures in buffalo and cows and that hundreds or thousands of people in the region who are
[2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:11.600]  touching the cotton that's genetically engineered to produce this toxic pesticide are developing
[2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:18.080]  allergic reactions like itching okay so what i did is i said i said to them please let's document
[2:41:18.080 --> 2:41:22.400]  this let's get it videotaped and so we were able to raise money to get an investigated team in there
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:27.600]  with a video camera and two veterinarians and a reporter and a project leader so that that will
[2:41:27.600 --> 2:41:32.400]  be able to be put out for everyone to see what's really happening there absolutely now now let's
[2:41:32.400 --> 2:41:36.240]  go back and i'm really gonna try to give you the floor so just you're gonna be running here uh what
[2:41:36.240 --> 2:41:41.840]  you think is most important uh the melamine the the estrogen mimicking endocrine disruptors in the
[2:41:41.840 --> 2:41:47.360]  plastics uh the gmo the india situation i mean because you really are one of the leading experts
[2:41:47.360 --> 2:41:51.360]  tell folks who you are then about some of your books and videos that we have available at info
[2:41:51.360 --> 2:41:55.680]  wars dot com and also on your own side give folks that and and and then you've got the floor sir
[2:41:55.680 --> 2:41:59.200]  whatever you think is most important to tell people because this is a public service announcement
[2:41:59.200 --> 2:42:03.760]  is what this is in the truest sense so people have a chance to know what's in their food in
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:09.520]  their water and and ways to try to protect themselves great well my expertise is really
[2:42:09.520 --> 2:42:14.560]  on the genetically engineered foods and crops that's where you take genes from one species
[2:42:14.560 --> 2:42:20.640]  and you force them into the dna of other species causing massive collateral damage in fact in the
[2:42:20.640 --> 2:42:27.120]  dna and lots of unpredicted side effects now these were originally introduced in our food supply
[2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:33.840]  widely in 1996 now is because the first bush administration uh believe that genetically
[2:42:33.840 --> 2:42:38.960]  engineered foods largely produced from the montanto company would increase us exports
[2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:46.560]  and what happened was they they told the fda to promote the biotechnology industry the fda then
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:52.080]  created a new position for michael taylor montanto's former attorney and later montanto vice president
[2:42:52.080 --> 2:42:56.880]  to be in charge of policy the policy came out with a blatant lie claiming that the
[2:42:56.880 --> 2:43:01.440]  agency wasn't aware of any information showing that gmo's were significantly different different
[2:43:01.440 --> 2:43:07.120]  gmo's means genetically modified organisms as a result of that lie they said no safety studies
[2:43:07.120 --> 2:43:12.080]  are necessary come on fanta and others don't even have to tell the fda in order to put these foods
[2:43:12.080 --> 2:43:20.240]  on the market well we know now seven years after that policy came out in 1999 44 000 internal secret
[2:43:20.240 --> 2:43:25.520]  memos from the fda were made public because of a lawsuit it turns out the overwhelming consensus
[2:43:25.520 --> 2:43:31.600]  among the fda's own scientists were in fact that genetically engineered foods could create allergies
[2:43:31.600 --> 2:43:36.560]  toxins new diseases and nutritional problems that it was different from normal foods and then
[2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:40.720]  in fact the scientists were appalled that it was going to be put on the market quickly and had
[2:43:40.720 --> 2:43:47.040]  urged their superiors like michael taylor to require long-term safety study now i'll say i'll
[2:43:47.040 --> 2:43:52.480]  footnote this by saying michael taylor is now on the obama transition team overseeing agriculture
[2:43:52.480 --> 2:43:58.080]  and that that concerns me although hopefully he's reformed but what's happened since then
[2:43:58.880 --> 2:44:04.160]  gmo's have been out on the market since 1996 there's now eight commercialized genetically
[2:44:04.160 --> 2:44:08.720]  engineered food crops we'll go over them in a minute and what i did is in my second book genetic
[2:44:08.720 --> 2:44:16.480]  roulette i documented with the help of more than 30 scientists all of the known health risks of gmo's
[2:44:16.480 --> 2:44:22.720]  and we've linked gmo's to thousands of toxic and allergic reactions in humans thousands of
[2:44:22.720 --> 2:44:28.560]  six sterile and dead livestock and damaged to virtually every organ in every system studied
[2:44:28.560 --> 2:44:34.880]  in animals and that came out last year but last month two government studies came out which i
[2:44:34.880 --> 2:44:41.680]  blogged about on my huffington post blog and it turns out the austrian government commission study
[2:44:41.680 --> 2:44:49.360]  showed that when mother when parent mice were fed genetically engineered corn which is currently
[2:44:49.360 --> 2:44:56.960]  approved on our diet that it had a reduction in the number of offspring and in the health of the
[2:44:56.960 --> 2:45:03.520]  offspring is judged by the weight of the offspring so it caused a level of infertility and damage
[2:45:03.520 --> 2:45:10.240]  in the next generation and the italian government commission to study which also came out last month
[2:45:10.240 --> 2:45:15.760]  showing that the corn create an immune response suggesting that it might create allergies or
[2:45:15.760 --> 2:45:22.400]  inflammatory responses or immune responses in humans so we continue to pile on information
[2:45:22.400 --> 2:45:25.680]  showing that genetically engineered foods are unsafe so i realized i didn't really talk about
[2:45:25.680 --> 2:45:31.280]  myself now i can talk about myself in the context of my work um i've been working on genetically
[2:45:31.280 --> 2:45:37.680]  engineered foods for about a dozen years i worked at a gmo detection laboratory as a vice president
[2:45:37.680 --> 2:45:43.200]  marketing i ran for u.s congress to raise the awareness of the issue i've published uh
[2:45:43.200 --> 2:45:48.160]  seeds of deception and genetic roulette i have a film out which is available online for free
[2:45:48.160 --> 2:45:54.960]  called your milk on drugs just say no another one called hidden dangers and kids meals and i've
[2:45:54.960 --> 2:46:00.880]  been traveling to about 30 countries uh counseling senior political leaders speaking to the media
[2:46:00.880 --> 2:46:08.000]  and the public about the dangers and more recently my institute for responsible technology has put
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:13.680]  together what's called the campaign for healthier eating in america it's a campaign designed to
[2:46:13.680 --> 2:46:20.080]  achieve the consumer rejection tipping point of genetically engineered foods in the united states
[2:46:20.800 --> 2:46:26.240]  and we think we can do this before the end of 2009 now a tipping point is something where
[2:46:26.240 --> 2:46:34.080]  there we turn the use of the genetically engineered ingredients into a marketing liability forcing
[2:46:34.080 --> 2:46:40.000]  food companies to take it out of their products or face reduced fail now this happened with bovine
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:45.840]  growth hormones genetically modified drugs inserted into cows to increase milk supply
[2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:51.440]  we had a kind of a tipping point against rbgh by consumers because of the obvious health
[2:46:51.440 --> 2:46:56.160]  dangers which i'll tell you about in a minute and that occurred about two and a half years ago
[2:46:56.160 --> 2:47:02.160]  and since then uh more and more dairies and retail stores and chains have taken out of their
[2:47:02.160 --> 2:47:07.200]  products the most recent one to take it out with subway they announced it two weeks ago
[2:47:07.200 --> 2:47:13.360]  walmart earlier this year starbucks the end of last year kroger in february even about 40 the top
[2:47:13.360 --> 2:47:19.840]  yeah even borden's is now you can hardly find the growth hormone milk now so this is one area
[2:47:19.840 --> 2:47:25.200]  where we're having massive victories against these global crime cartels this is so exciting
[2:47:25.200 --> 2:47:32.240]  what's happening so we're having victories consumers can vote absolutely in fact we our
[2:47:32.240 --> 2:47:37.520]  organization was part of the group of organizations that engineered this tipping point it wasn't just
[2:47:37.520 --> 2:47:43.600]  random we started educating people about the health risks of the bovine growth hormone the milk itself
[2:47:43.600 --> 2:47:50.240]  has more pus it has more antibiotics it has more growth hormone it also has more of a hormone
[2:47:50.240 --> 2:47:57.760]  called insulin like growth factor one igf one which in high levels in humans can cause candle
[2:47:57.760 --> 2:48:03.760]  is linked to cancer and high rates of fraternal twins and it's in much much higher levels in
[2:48:03.760 --> 2:48:07.600]  the milk that comes from these treated and that's why we see all these twins suddenly everywhere
[2:48:08.560 --> 2:48:13.200]  yeah in fact there was a study that came out in the journal of uh reproductive medicine
[2:48:13.200 --> 2:48:18.720]  where they compared the fraternal rate twin rate in the united states to the u k now the u k there's
[2:48:18.720 --> 2:48:24.240]  a band of the use of bovine growth hormone in fact it's banned in most industrialized countries
[2:48:24.240 --> 2:48:29.680]  all of europe canada japan australia new zealand but it was put through in the united states
[2:48:29.680 --> 2:48:34.240]  when michael taylor monsanto's former attorney was in charge of policy it's a monsanto it was
[2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:39.600]  a monsanto drug until they sold it off to elie lily this fall because they saw the writing on
[2:48:39.600 --> 2:48:47.280]  the wall that it was going down um but uh we we know that the product the white paper that
[2:48:47.280 --> 2:48:54.000]  michael taylor wrote while he was the deputy commissioner of policy stated that not only
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:49:00.400]  were they not going to lay allow not going to require labeling of dairy products that contained
[2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:08.560]  rbgh they were he was even suggesting that if some dairy were to label it as rbgh free
[2:49:08.560 --> 2:49:12.640]  they should also put the disclaimer according to the FDA there's no difference well they tried to
[2:49:12.640 --> 2:49:16.480]  threaten dairies they tried to threaten dairies as you know to stop doing that with a bluff
[2:49:17.200 --> 2:49:20.800]  just like there's something going on in kansas about that and stay there when we come back
[2:49:20.800 --> 2:49:25.120]  we're gonna talk about this but the key here is with the estrogen hormones in the in the
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:30.320]  mimickers in the milk in the plastic we can have a tipping point we can have a tipping point on the
[2:49:30.320 --> 2:49:37.120]  melamine on all of it we'll be right back toxic heavy metals negatively impact our health
[2:49:37.120 --> 2:49:41.840]  there in the air we breathe the water we drink the food we eat the products we use in the objects
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:47.040]  we touch exposure is impossible to avoid heavy metals build up within the body over a period
[2:49:47.040 --> 2:49:52.480]  of time causing poor health however with keelorex they can be mobilized and excreted in a safe and
[2:49:52.480 --> 2:49:56.960]  effective manner keelorex was developed based on dr allen greenberg's clinical experience
[2:49:56.960 --> 2:50:03.040]  with heavy metal poisoning during his 25 years of medical practice keelorex does not contain edta
[2:50:03.040 --> 2:50:08.160]  and is made from all natural ingredients enhancing the body's natural mechanisms for excreting heavy
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:13.120]  metals and preventing their reabsorption keelorex contains antioxidants to protect the liver

[2:52:42.160 --> 2:52:48.800]  preeminent experts on gmo and not just gmo foods but the policies around the world and the fight
[2:52:48.800 --> 2:52:55.120]  against them overwhelmingly in every poll it's 85 95 99 some polls against these people know
[2:52:55.120 --> 2:52:59.360]  they're bad especially the cross species genetically modified organisms where they put cockroach
[2:52:59.360 --> 2:53:03.600]  genes and tomatoes or for some reason they use the cockroach as one of the favorites of such
[2:53:03.600 --> 2:53:13.120]  old genetics or in salmon i mean pig genes human genes and pigs approving cloned milk
[2:53:13.120 --> 2:53:17.520]  approving cloned animals milk from cloned animals the list just goes on and on we're
[2:53:17.520 --> 2:53:23.200]  going to go back to him in a moment i hope that you will go to info wars dot com and click on

[2:53:29.040 --> 2:53:32.720]  by jeff ream smith exposing industry and government lies about the safety genetically
[2:53:32.720 --> 2:53:38.240]  engineered foods are eating seeds of deception exposing expose by jeff ream smith documents
[2:53:38.240 --> 2:53:42.560]  significant health dangers and genetically modified gm foods and the intense industry
[2:53:42.560 --> 2:53:47.680]  influence of political corruption these are well done like like textbooks but beautiful
[2:53:47.680 --> 2:53:52.880]  colored pages i mean just lavish very easy to understand but all the scientific data they
[2:53:52.880 --> 2:53:59.600]  have the we have a deadly gamble combo that has the two books and the two films with the audio cd
[2:53:59.600 --> 2:54:07.120]  in fact for what is it 1995 we have the gmo trilogy dvd cd set that's probably the best deal
[2:54:07.120 --> 2:54:12.080]  and most people don't read they watch things three disc set that explains why gmo's genetically
[2:54:12.080 --> 2:54:15.920]  modified organisms threaten your health the environment and future generations give this
[2:54:15.920 --> 2:54:23.200]  this christmas instead of a gmo fruitcake or gmo cotton shirt that it's got all sorts of
[2:54:23.200 --> 2:54:29.120]  poisons leaching into you i mean seriously folks go to info wars dot com and support the
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:32.960]  alternative media but more importantly educate yourself your friends and family learn how to
[2:54:32.960 --> 2:54:40.000]  identify these approvingly very dangerous creations that we're eating and consuming and wearing
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:45.920]  at info wars dot com genetic roulette of the gmo trilogy and the deadly gamble combo with all of
[2:54:45.920 --> 2:54:51.440]  them in it and then of course seeds of deception this is a short segment but let's continue sir
[2:54:51.440 --> 2:54:56.640]  with where you left off about tipping points we're having victory after victory worldwide
[2:54:56.640 --> 2:55:00.880]  when we're actually able to reach out and educate the public this is very encouraging
[2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:06.960]  absolutely with genetically modified food the tipping point of consumer rejection in europe
[2:55:06.960 --> 2:55:13.920]  happened in april of 1999 because there's high profile media coverage on the food safety aspects
[2:55:13.920 --> 2:55:20.080]  of gmo's as a result within a single week virtually every major food company committed to stop using
[2:55:20.080 --> 2:55:25.600]  gm ingredients for the european brand but the tipping point caused a swift rejection of gmo's
[2:55:25.600 --> 2:55:31.040]  there now what's needed here in order to create the tipping point are two fundamental pieces
[2:55:31.040 --> 2:55:36.480]  the first is knowledge of the health standard of gmo's and the second is information on how
[2:55:36.480 --> 2:55:41.200]  to avoid them so we have a new non gmo shopping guide and i'll be happy to link that over to
[2:55:41.200 --> 2:55:46.240]  info wars i'll deal with that after after the flood your side of the plug your side people
[2:55:46.240 --> 2:55:51.360]  should buy it right now plug it okay they can do they could it's actually free uh to the look at
[2:55:51.360 --> 2:55:55.600]  and you can also buy it at cost and bundles of 50 so you can give it out to your friends good so
[2:55:55.600 --> 2:55:59.760]  it's free online where you can print it off but i recommend buying it in bundles that saves the
[2:55:59.760 --> 2:56:06.480]  work in the time yes yes so a responsible technology dot org responsible technology
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:11.840]  dot org you can go to our shopping guide the non gmo shopping guide you can look at it online you
[2:56:11.840 --> 2:56:17.440]  can print it out but we also we can ship it we recommend getting these brochures that are also
[2:56:17.440 --> 2:56:23.360]  talk about the gmo health risk when you give them out together the health risks brochures tells people
[2:56:23.360 --> 2:56:30.640]  why to avoid gmo's and the non gmo shopping guide tells people how very simple very simple only 14
[2:56:30.640 --> 2:56:37.040]  pages long very well done everybody should get these what it does is what we're asking doctors
[2:56:37.040 --> 2:56:41.040]  to give it out as patient education materials we're asking religions to give it out to their
[2:56:41.040 --> 2:56:45.840]  congregation parent teacher organization to give it out to children so that all the parents know
[2:56:45.840 --> 2:56:50.560]  what to buy and also it's being made available for free through natural food stores as well
[2:56:50.560 --> 2:56:55.840]  and there's a new film and there's a new film out available the world according to monsanto
[2:56:55.840 --> 2:57:00.480]  we're going to be back in one minute or 70 seconds to be precise with jeffrey m smith and let's talk
[2:57:00.480 --> 2:57:07.440]  about uh this your milk on drugs just say no uh with our guest when we get back in one minute

[2:58:53.920 --> 2:59:00.400]  we are live with jeffrey in smith jeffrey let's get into this incredible new film and let's get
[2:59:00.400 --> 2:59:07.920]  into a wide spectrum of just how bad gmo is and then the melamine and the hormones and the estrogen
[2:59:07.920 --> 2:59:13.120]  endocrine disruptors that are in many types of plastic and how it's being changed worldwide but
[2:59:13.120 --> 2:59:20.160]  we haven't reached the tipping point here yet but this new film tell us about the world according
[2:59:20.160 --> 2:59:27.760]  to monsanto well this is an amazing film i think that if this film was widely seen in the united
[2:59:27.760 --> 2:59:33.520]  states the tipping point would follow soon after so we're actually recommending for individuals to
[2:59:33.520 --> 2:59:39.520]  host um home showing parties and to host free public showing and we have hand out materials
[2:59:39.520 --> 2:59:44.560]  that you can give to people after they see this film because of the level of outrage and the level
[2:59:44.560 --> 2:59:51.360]  of motivation to be anti-gmo campaigner is greater in the 30 minutes after seeing the film the world
[2:59:51.360 --> 2:59:57.760]  according to monsanto than any time in a person's life it just it shows first of all the background
[2:59:57.760 --> 3:00:04.080]  of this company monsanto whose intention is to replace nature with its genetically engineered
[3:00:04.080 --> 3:00:09.040]  patented creation and they brag i mean i mean i mean tell the listeners they brag that they mean
[3:00:09.040 --> 3:00:14.080]  to take everything over so then we don't have a choice no it's definitely true i talked to someone
[3:00:14.080 --> 3:00:20.400]  who had come and come back in 1999 from a conference where Arthur Anderson consulting with the
[3:00:20.400 --> 3:00:25.200]  monsanto's consultant they're also and ronvin consultant of course they had bragged about
[3:00:25.200 --> 3:00:30.720]  that i had worked with the monsanto executives first asking them to describe their ideal future
[3:00:30.720 --> 3:00:36.480]  in 15 to 20 years and the executive described the world in which 100 percent of all commercial
[3:00:36.480 --> 3:00:41.200]  seeds in the world were genetically engineered and patented and Anderson consulting worked
[3:00:41.200 --> 3:00:46.960]  backwards from that goal to create the strategy and tactics to achieve it and so their intention
[3:00:46.960 --> 3:00:51.680]  is to replace our food with nature now i've talked to a number of people who used to work
[3:00:51.680 --> 3:00:58.240]  in monsanto one person i spoke to this year he said about the bovine growth hormone that changes
[3:00:58.240 --> 3:01:04.880]  our milk he said that the three scientists that he talked to who were doing the actual food safety
[3:01:04.880 --> 3:01:11.200]  studies on the drug themselves switched to organic milk which doesn't allow the drug because they
[3:01:11.200 --> 3:01:16.720]  were concerned about the potential influence on their health of increased levels of i gf1 which
[3:01:16.720 --> 3:01:21.600]  is linked to cancer he also told me that other scientists were indicating that they had found
[3:01:21.600 --> 3:01:26.560]  adverse effects of feeding their genetically engineered crops to rodents i don't know if
[3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:32.000]  it was mice or rats and we're trying to figure out how to describe it in such a way that the
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:37.920]  adverse impacts were not apparent to anyone who might look at the study so this is the
[3:01:37.920 --> 3:01:44.560]  another person told me that uh... he he was originally recruited to go to monsanto by
[3:01:44.560 --> 3:01:50.960]  and and he looked at online we looked at the documents that were done by the former ceo
[3:01:50.960 --> 3:01:57.280]  robert Shapiro of monsanto that that glowed about the positive impact of genetic engineering for
[3:01:57.280 --> 3:02:01.600]  health and feeding the world and all that so we decided to take the job and when he was
[3:02:01.600 --> 3:02:09.040]  in st louis he actually stood up at a meeting of all these new recruits and said and describe
[3:02:09.040 --> 3:02:12.160]  all these great things that robert Shapiro wanted for the world and how great it was
[3:02:12.160 --> 3:02:16.480]  that they're working for genetic engineering he was pulled aside after the meeting by a vice
[3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:22.080]  president of monsanto he told me that the vice president said to him now wait a minute what
[3:02:22.080 --> 3:02:27.440]  might what robert Shapiro says is one thing what we do is something else he's the face man
[3:02:27.440 --> 3:02:31.680]  to tell the story we don't even understand what he's talking about we're here to make money
[3:02:32.400 --> 3:02:36.240]  then he discovered that the genetically engineered cotton that was being fed to
[3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:40.400]  the dairy cows down the street from him that was from monsanto's field trials
[3:02:40.400 --> 3:02:44.720]  that it had a potentially dangerous protein that had been the result of this
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:49.040]  uh... kind of random primitive way that they genetically engineer crops
[3:02:49.040 --> 3:02:52.480]  he tried to complain and say this could be endangering the cows
[3:02:52.480 --> 3:02:57.680]  and the food supply and no one in the company listened instead they ostracized him
[3:02:57.680 --> 3:03:02.800]  he tried to blow the whistle to government officials in california to university professors
[3:03:02.800 --> 3:03:06.800]  no one listened to him so he left the company saying he's not going to be part of this disaster
[3:03:07.840 --> 3:03:10.800]  and that's covered in the film long segment coming up plenty of time to get into this
[3:03:10.800 --> 3:03:14.240]  and the big key here is and we'll talk to jeff riem spent about this when we get back
[3:03:14.800 --> 3:03:19.360]  is this is a fight for our lives there are hundreds of gmo foods but what eight or nine big
[3:03:19.360 --> 3:03:24.240]  main staple crop ones they're about to go into hundreds and hundreds where basically everything
[3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:29.360]  will be gmo so we either stop it now it's already been devastating to all of us a lot of us are
[3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:35.680]  gonna probably already die from this or they take over hello friends this is alex jones
[3:03:35.680 --> 3:03:39.600]  i've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[3:03:39.600 --> 3:03:43.920]  important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:48.160]  to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the superdome
[3:03:48.160 --> 3:03:52.720]  and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare our
[3:03:52.720 --> 3:03:57.040]  elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for special interest so they ignored
[3:03:57.040 --> 3:04:01.360]  your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print eight
[3:04:01.360 --> 3:04:05.920]  hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the american and
[3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:11.280]  european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing
[3:04:11.280 --> 3:04:16.800]  and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans reach in pre-nazi
[3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:21.440]  germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached
[3:04:21.440 --> 3:04:27.040]  over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[3:04:27.040 --> 3:04:31.600]  in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores
[3:04:31.600 --> 3:04:36.560]  enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business
[3:04:36.560 --> 3:04:41.680]  whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food
[3:04:41.680 --> 3:04:46.000]  one third of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:50.960]  friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there
[3:04:50.960 --> 3:04:54.800]  listening it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the
[3:04:54.800 --> 3:04:59.440]  government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of
[3:04:59.440 --> 3:05:04.000]  self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation
[3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:09.040]  but you you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from e-coli

[3:06:33.520 --> 3:06:38.640]  but this new film i don't have this new film but i've seen clips of it online incredibly powerful
[3:06:38.640 --> 3:06:44.480]  story jeffrey and smith tell folks where they can get it i know monsanto film dot com monsanto
[3:06:44.480 --> 3:06:51.680]  film dot com people's lives depend on this and i want to be clear here i mean i'm somebody who
[3:06:51.680 --> 3:06:56.320]  does my research when i was first on air 13 years ago i was more of a mainline but only for about a
[3:06:56.320 --> 3:07:01.760]  year kind of libertarian ron paul conservative and i still have a many issues but ron paul now
[3:07:01.760 --> 3:07:06.560]  is concerned about gmo because he's researching he's a medical doctor i over the years went and
[3:07:06.560 --> 3:07:11.040]  read the case studies i had nobel prize winners on i had executives and genetic engineers who
[3:07:11.040 --> 3:07:15.280]  headed up companies made millions a year who where their rats would die or their rats would be
[3:07:15.280 --> 3:07:20.000]  sterile or the animals would get sick and they would go say we've got to go back and fix this
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:25.200]  they'd say no because they fire with these gene guns in randomly and get mutations and then take
[3:07:25.200 --> 3:07:29.280]  the mutation they like and breed it there's a lot of stuff science the point is i have done
[3:07:30.880 --> 3:07:36.240]  oh probably 300 400 500 hours i've probably read 20 books on the subject probably watch
[3:07:36.880 --> 3:07:43.120]  20 30 films hundreds of talks had hundreds of guests on uh jeffrey and smith is one of the
[3:07:43.120 --> 3:07:47.600]  leading figures in fighting this one of the most successful he is very conservative and he'll admit
[3:07:47.600 --> 3:07:52.480]  that uh it's it's frankly far worse than he's even saying let me explain something to you
[3:07:52.480 --> 3:07:57.760]  this is devastating us there's a reason that one in three has cancer from one in 33 now
[3:07:57.760 --> 3:08:02.240]  just 50 years ago there's a reason diabetes is up several thousand percentage points there's a reason
[3:08:02.240 --> 3:08:06.400]  the sperm counts down by 80 plus percent on average there's a reason women are infertile
[3:08:06.400 --> 3:08:11.280]  there's a reason melamine and and and and all of this uh separate from genetic engineering is
[3:08:11.280 --> 3:08:17.520]  hurting us and aspartame uh and i will tell you it's by design it's eugenics i mean it's like
[3:08:17.520 --> 3:08:21.840]  bear pharmaceutical shipping on over a million doses of factor eight every one of them filled with
[3:08:21.840 --> 3:08:26.000]  hiv and hepatitis a b and c knowing it would kill everybody that got it or make them very ill
[3:08:27.120 --> 3:08:32.720]  you know that's on record now even on msnbc this is real you need to get this film uh jeffrey smith
[3:08:32.720 --> 3:08:38.000]  though where's the best place for folks to get it well online montanto film dot com
[3:08:38.560 --> 3:08:42.960]  is the way to get it um it'll be on your site i'm sure very soon yeah i meant to carry it
[3:08:42.960 --> 3:08:47.600]  and uh you know you'll be getting it soon from us i think you put an order in today but um my
[3:08:47.600 --> 3:08:51.200]  favorite of the world according to my friend i gotta give you the backstory in this i've been
[3:08:51.200 --> 3:08:57.040]  interviewed dozens of times for uh by filmmakers about 14 film crews have come to my little town
[3:08:57.040 --> 3:09:03.760]  in iowa and i got a call from this french woman marie monique robin uh and you know it was it was
[3:09:03.760 --> 3:09:09.760]  kind of standard for me to start giving filmmakers the background about gmo's and who to speak to
[3:09:09.760 --> 3:09:15.360]  and what the story was and the disc the discrediting and the disruptions and the deception it turns
[3:09:15.360 --> 3:09:23.600]  out she had been studying this so solidly for so many months she knew more than any other
[3:09:23.600 --> 3:09:29.120]  filmmaker i had ever spoken with more in fact more than most anti-gmo activists that i've seen
[3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:34.640]  around the world in my 30 countries of travel she was so well prepared and she was going to visit
[3:09:34.640 --> 3:09:40.960]  the people that i had just written about all over the world all over the country and so i was excited
[3:09:40.960 --> 3:09:45.840]  about this film i actually went to paris and saw the the run through of the of the film before it
[3:09:45.840 --> 3:09:50.560]  was done and arranged to have it available in the united states because i did not want it to be
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:55.680]  um you know yeah it's very well done it's very well done oh it's incredible it's incredible it
[3:09:55.680 --> 3:10:01.520]  leaves people absolutely shaking one one reviewer said will freeze the blood in your vein and what it
[3:10:01.520 --> 3:10:07.360]  does is it it talks about the history of monsanto and all of the dealings that they had with
[3:10:07.360 --> 3:10:12.720]  agent orange and the lies and apparently rigged research and dumping toxic waste dumping toxic
[3:10:12.720 --> 3:10:17.680]  waste in poor neighborhoods and earlier i didn't finish my point i never do and just briefly what
[3:10:17.680 --> 3:10:22.320]  i'm saying is i didn't believe that gmo was bad i bought the propaganda that it was going to save
[3:10:22.320 --> 3:10:27.200]  everybody and feed the world when in truth it actually destroys farmers and is designed so
[3:10:27.200 --> 3:10:31.920]  they're dependent so agribusiness could take over so my point is i really researched this and found
[3:10:31.920 --> 3:10:38.960]  out that that i was wrong uh to 13 years ago but go ahead no and then exactly what happens with
[3:10:38.960 --> 3:10:42.640]  people is that there's so much money has been spent on convincing people that it's going to feed the
[3:10:42.640 --> 3:10:47.360]  world when they realize how dangerous it is that the average gm crop reduces yield that it actually
[3:10:47.360 --> 3:10:52.800]  destroys farmers it's quite a wake-up call and this comes out in this beautiful film it taught
[3:10:52.800 --> 3:10:58.720]  we talked to someone from the epa whose colleague was basically trashed when she discovered apparently
[3:10:58.720 --> 3:11:04.400]  rigged research by monsanto uh we talked to a whistleblower at the fda who lost his job
[3:11:04.400 --> 3:11:10.320]  when he tried to get proper studies done on bovine growth hormone uh there's it shows how
[3:11:10.320 --> 3:11:15.440]  monsanto's claims that their roundup herbicide is biodegradable was declared false and illegal
[3:11:15.440 --> 3:11:21.680]  by judges in two countries how there's possible cancer effects it was being covered up bob about
[3:11:21.680 --> 3:11:27.760]  their herbicide and each time when this is discovered somehow monsanto gets the upper hand
[3:11:27.760 --> 3:11:35.200]  and stifles the research and ends up booting out the researcher or keeping him quiet now with gmo
[3:11:35.200 --> 3:11:41.520]  this is all a lead-up to gmo which is much worse than the agent arms the dbt the pcb's and aniston
[3:11:41.520 --> 3:11:45.440]  where they said they didn't want to lose a dollar of business so they weren't going to inform the
[3:11:45.440 --> 3:11:50.160]  people locally that they're being poisoned year after year but the gmo's is absolutely the worst
[3:11:50.160 --> 3:11:56.080]  and is it they the the work that this this movie does it makes it absolutely clear that it was
[3:11:56.080 --> 3:12:03.120]  political collusion industry manipulation lies and deception that allowed these very dangerous
[3:12:03.120 --> 3:12:07.600]  genetically engineered crops in fact there was one point where she's doing this rare interview
[3:12:07.600 --> 3:12:13.600]  with the former fda pro biotech manager and he's trying to argue for the safety of gmo saying
[3:12:13.600 --> 3:12:18.880]  there's absolutely no question that these foods are safe and then she pulls out from her own notes
[3:12:18.880 --> 3:12:26.000]  a 1991 memo in which he himself admitted that gmo that the genetically modern genetic modification
[3:12:26.000 --> 3:12:31.120]  might have been responsible for a deadly epidemic in the 1980s that killed about a hundred americans
[3:12:31.120 --> 3:12:35.360]  and caused five ten thousand to fall sick from a genetically engineered food supplement called
[3:12:35.360 --> 3:12:40.960]  el tripti fan and he was like humming and hoeing he just caught absolutely off guard not realizing
[3:12:40.960 --> 3:12:46.720]  that this woman has done her study done her research it all he she also talks to dr arport
[3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:53.200]  who's tied from scotland i think he's been on your show he's he actually um was fired from
[3:12:53.200 --> 3:12:57.600]  his job after 35 years in silence with threats of a lawsuit when he found that genetically
[3:12:57.600 --> 3:13:03.040]  engineered crops are inherently dangerous and caused massive damage to rats that were fed
[3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:07.040]  a genetically engineered potato and by the way he was the head guy he was the head guy there
[3:13:08.080 --> 3:13:12.560]  yeah he was actually he was the guy that had been given three million dollar grant by the
[3:13:12.560 --> 3:13:18.080]  u k government to create the ideal testing protocol for gmo that was going to be instituted
[3:13:18.080 --> 3:13:23.280]  into e u law and he had been studying it you know with a team of about 20 or 30 people in
[3:13:23.280 --> 3:13:28.480]  three different institutes so he was like the leading person in the world doing the most official
[3:13:28.480 --> 3:13:34.000]  research on gmo's and was canned because he discovered that they were bad now when he went
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:39.440]  public with his concerns initially he was a hero at his prestigious institute but then allegedly
[3:13:39.440 --> 3:13:45.760]  montanto called clinton or someone at the white house someone at the white house called blare
[3:13:45.760 --> 3:13:51.520]  and someone from from the prime minister's office in the u k phone the director of the institute
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:57.120]  where this guy worked and the next morning he was fired from his job and by the way he he was a
[3:13:57.120 --> 3:14:01.680]  top engineer i mean genic engineer he told me on air several times he believed in it he wanted it
[3:14:01.680 --> 3:14:07.440]  to work but he couldn't engage in mass murder absolutely he was concerned because he realized
[3:14:07.440 --> 3:14:12.560]  that the potatoes that had caused such damage and they caused potentially pre-cancerous cell
[3:14:12.560 --> 3:14:16.960]  growth smaller brains livers and testicles partial atrophy of the liver damaged the new
[3:14:16.960 --> 3:14:21.840]  system i mean this is after 10 days of getting a genetic engineer crop i mean he realized that
[3:14:21.840 --> 3:14:27.200]  it is if his potatoes had been submitted to the same flimsy superficial terrible research
[3:14:27.760 --> 3:14:31.920]  safety studies that had gotten other products in the market the potatoes would have flown
[3:14:31.920 --> 3:14:38.480]  on to the market yeah soon to say i want to stop you i want to stop you in 10 days in rats
[3:14:38.480 --> 3:14:43.520]  in rodents which they study because physiologically or the weather metabolic system works they're
[3:14:43.520 --> 3:14:48.800]  the closest to humans next to pigs but rats are cheaper and from the scientists i've talked to
[3:14:48.800 --> 3:14:54.080]  that's not my opinion that's a fact that's why they test mice and rats and other rodents skinny
[3:14:54.080 --> 3:15:01.040]  pigs that in 10 days devastating effects i mean this is an imagine we're all eating other stuff
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:06.400]  like this right now you know even there's some studies that didn't get on to this world according
[3:15:06.400 --> 3:15:11.600]  to my standards you got a lot of beautiful stuff on uh but there was this woman a senior scientist
[3:15:11.600 --> 3:15:17.120]  at the russian national academy of sciences who fed rats genetically engineered soy that we do eat
[3:15:17.680 --> 3:15:23.840]  a mother rat and more than half of the offspring died within three weeks and compared to only
[3:15:23.840 --> 3:15:28.480]  one out of ten death rate when the mothers were eating non-genetically engineered ladies and
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:33.920]  gentlemen you understand we're eating this this is deadly that's why there's i mean i was talking
[3:15:33.920 --> 3:15:37.360]  to a medical doctor the other day she talked about how when she was going to the albert
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:42.240]  einstein medical institution i talked to harvard medicals as well you know we were graduating 30
[3:15:42.240 --> 3:15:47.920]  40 years ago they would if there was a child in the war that had cancer it was like going to look at
[3:15:47.920 --> 3:15:54.240]  you know you know the last right whale i mean it was so rare that it was like oh my god and now
[3:15:54.240 --> 3:15:58.640]  they're just kids all around in the neighborhood dying people dying everywhere uh so i mean it's
[3:15:58.640 --> 3:16:05.520]  it this is a holocaust you know it's interesting this particular scientist she was harassed she
[3:16:05.520 --> 3:16:09.280]  was set up in the tax they had she came to her office once and there was a paper that had been
[3:16:09.280 --> 3:16:14.800]  burned on her desk she had samples stolen and she was eventually taken off the ability to do
[3:16:14.800 --> 3:16:19.920]  any more gmail research because her director was pressured by his director so another scientist
[3:16:19.920 --> 3:16:26.160]  at the institute went up to her and tried to cut to comfort her by actually saying
[3:16:26.160 --> 3:16:30.720]  well maybe the genetically engineered so i will solve the overpopulation problem on the earth
[3:16:30.720 --> 3:16:38.560]  oh oh she was supposed to comfort her now another team in in italy stop stop stop stop
[3:16:38.560 --> 3:16:42.400]  sir this is too i gotta have you back this is too incredible and we're running out of time
[3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:47.040]  we've got one minute before this break in this segment specifically the name of this lady where
[3:16:47.040 --> 3:16:52.400]  this was oh don't worry the overpopulation because i've actually found sir it's all by design
[3:16:52.400 --> 3:16:57.120]  i know you don't go that far you stick with the you know this area but but but but it always comes
[3:16:57.120 --> 3:17:02.640]  up go back to that little story a little more specifics sure sure all right her name is dr arena
[3:17:02.640 --> 3:17:08.160]  ermikova and uh there was an interesting thing about her about her research she had she had
[3:17:08.160 --> 3:17:15.440]  done this research three times when she said mother uh rat genetically engineered soy and each time
[3:17:15.440 --> 3:17:22.080]  is a huge death rate and also smaller offspring really run like offspring and a very interesting
[3:17:22.080 --> 3:17:26.640]  twist happened after she did her three research studies which i'll tell you about after the break
[3:17:26.640 --> 3:17:30.240]  what i'm gonna do because the interest of time i'm gonna skip this break for the internet
[3:17:30.240 --> 3:17:35.360]  listeners and video folks watching at present planet dot tv and we'll come back and get into
[3:17:35.360 --> 3:17:42.080]  all the other areas when we return time is too valuable stay with us drinking a course
[3:17:42.080 --> 3:17:48.560]  i'm gonna go back to smith um jeffrey we're on the web we're not only am an fm for this three
[3:17:48.560 --> 3:17:53.040]  minute break but later the web ends up being bigger than the you know the one-shot radio
[3:17:53.040 --> 3:17:57.440]  show so i don't want to miss any time on this flesh out the rest of her story then we'll come back
[3:18:00.960 --> 3:18:08.080]  i'm yeah to to uh these rats and each time they had over 50 percent average death rate
[3:18:08.080 --> 3:18:16.960]  and much smaller offspring now after three times uh spontaneously and coincidentally the clinic itself
[3:18:16.960 --> 3:18:23.520]  the facility that she worked at switched over to a rat feed that was all genetically soy based
[3:18:23.520 --> 3:18:29.360]  so with all GM soy in the rat feed so she couldn't do any more studies because she had no control
[3:18:29.360 --> 3:18:35.120]  all of the rats in the facility were being fed GM soy but after two months she went to her colleagues
[3:18:35.120 --> 3:18:40.480]  and said in your studies which were not GM related what is the offspring mortality rate
[3:18:41.040 --> 3:18:48.800]  it had skyrocketed facility wide to 56.3 percent now this means that it wasn't just her particular
[3:18:48.800 --> 3:18:55.440]  batch of GM soy that was causing this problem it was a generic problem with GM soy in general
[3:18:56.480 --> 3:19:02.400]  and so this demonstrates that this could be happening to us now we have additional studies
[3:19:02.400 --> 3:19:09.760]  could be hold on hold on hold on could be i mean they study rats with drugs and chemicals in GMO
[3:19:09.760 --> 3:19:14.080]  because they're so similar to us with their whole metabolic system and i mean you just had the
[3:19:14.080 --> 3:19:18.560]  austrian study last week totally separate another GMO well that was corn wasn't it
[3:19:19.360 --> 3:19:25.280]  yeah well that was actually the reproductive study uh last week was a corn that was not only
[3:19:25.280 --> 3:19:30.080]  producing it on pesticide but was also roundup ready meaning it was designed not there's no
[3:19:30.080 --> 3:19:35.360]  doubt this has to stop now i mean i don't mean to get emotional here but i i'm fighting to not
[3:19:35.360 --> 3:19:39.680]  have my kids eat this and i'm not a wealthy person but i'm middle class and it's very expensive for
[3:19:39.680 --> 3:19:46.800]  me poor families as you know can't afford this well what i'd be my shopping guide we show
[3:19:46.800 --> 3:19:52.400]  that you can even go and buy you know non-organic regular stuff off the supermarket shelves if you
[3:19:52.400 --> 3:19:58.000]  read the ingredients and you avoid the the basically the offspring of soy corn cotton canola the
[3:19:58.000 --> 3:20:02.480]  four major GM crop because those are the really dead ones well those are the ones that are
[3:20:02.480 --> 3:20:08.640]  everywhere now unfortunately this year and probably this month for the first time our sugar supply
[3:20:08.640 --> 3:20:12.160]  has been contaminated let's come back to the full audience let's come back to the full audience
[3:20:12.160 --> 3:20:17.120]  let's go back to the eugenics the oh it's okay honey if 56 percent of the rats are sterile and
[3:20:17.120 --> 3:20:21.440]  the bunch of them are dying when we feed them this the earth's got too many people specifically
[3:20:21.440 --> 3:20:27.520]  where was she when that was done i'm sorry what where was you were telling the story of them coming
[3:20:27.520 --> 3:20:31.360]  to the scientist and saying don't worry if it's killing them you know making the rats sick and
[3:20:31.360 --> 3:20:35.680]  sterile we need to get rid of the people right you know come on yeah she she told me that we had
[3:20:35.680 --> 3:20:40.640]  just given a presentation together at the european parliament and she was really frustrated because
[3:20:40.640 --> 3:20:45.200]  she couldn't do any more studies uh they wanted they someone finally came to her and said okay
[3:20:45.200 --> 3:20:49.680]  you can do GMO studies if you sign this contract it says you can't talk about your research for
[3:20:49.680 --> 3:20:55.040]  these three years and we can replace any of your cohorts with any of our chosen people
[3:20:55.040 --> 3:20:58.960]  and you have no choice about it so she couldn't sign that because it was basically signing away
[3:20:58.960 --> 3:21:05.920]  all of her independence but um so she found out that not only were there the offspring dying
[3:21:06.480 --> 3:21:10.720]  but she cut the offspring that survived and tried to mate those together
[3:21:10.720 --> 3:21:14.960]  and they would not conceive they never got pregnant vile weapon so there was
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:22.240]  so it it's interesting that another study in italy also said the same genetically engineered
[3:21:22.240 --> 3:21:27.760]  soy which grows on 91 percent of all soy fields in the united states they fed it to mice and then
[3:21:27.760 --> 3:21:32.880]  they looked under an electron microscope at the testicles of the mice and it turns out
[3:21:32.880 --> 3:21:40.320]  that they were damaged young sperm cell then they they they took parent mice gave parent mice
[3:21:40.320 --> 3:21:45.680]  the genetically engineered soy and had them mate together then they took out an embryo a young
[3:21:45.680 --> 3:21:50.560]  embryo or several of them and looked at the dna of the young embryo and it was functioning
[3:21:50.560 --> 3:21:56.800]  differently compared to the dna of embryos whose parents were fed normal genetically engineered
[3:21:56.800 --> 3:22:01.120]  soy now when i went to the east stay there stay there we've got to come back we've got to come
[3:22:01.120 --> 3:22:24.960]  back to the full audience and recap that here we go
[3:22:31.360 --> 3:22:47.120]  hey the globalists are not nice guys we need to stop being nice guys right back to them
[3:22:48.400 --> 3:22:52.480]  all right finishing up jeffrey i know it's a little bit skillet when i've got you behind
[3:22:52.480 --> 3:22:56.800]  the scenes talking when we come back you were finishing up with these these these rats that
[3:22:56.800 --> 3:23:04.160]  have been bred together that had been fed gmo the embryos themselves were different genetics
[3:23:05.680 --> 3:23:10.240]  finish up with that and then and then and then recap in any more specifics you've got
[3:23:10.240 --> 3:23:14.400]  about she goes to them and they say you know she's she's distraught and they say don't worry this
[3:23:14.400 --> 3:23:19.680]  will contribute to world overpopulation which of course she was compartmentalized she she wasn't
[3:23:19.680 --> 3:23:23.600]  told that that was the whole point i know you won't go that far i will i've made the film in game
[3:23:23.600 --> 3:23:28.080]  blueprint for global enslavement then let's get into the 64 billion dollar or trillion dollar
[3:23:28.080 --> 3:23:35.200]  question uh the fight is now they are proliferating gmo into everything and now is the time to stop
[3:23:35.200 --> 3:23:40.080]  them go ahead absolutely all right let's just talk about the reproductive issues because there's
[3:23:40.080 --> 3:23:45.920]  more about reproduction and this and the failure of of animals who've been fed gmo's to reproduce
[3:23:45.920 --> 3:23:50.720]  it's actually not just in the laboratory we're seeing it among livestock and i'll show you i'll
[3:23:50.720 --> 3:23:55.760]  tie it all together right now so we left off with arena ermicova it was at the eu parliament
[3:23:55.760 --> 3:24:01.200]  office as i'd we had just given a talk and she tells me that she can't do any more studies because
[3:24:01.200 --> 3:24:05.200]  um they've been she's been taken off of the job and if someone tried to comfort her
[3:24:05.200 --> 3:24:10.400]  saying that maybe it'll solve the overpopulation problem now at that at that conference she also
[3:24:10.400 --> 3:24:16.960]  showed a slide of testicles of rats that were fed genetically engineered soy and compared to the
[3:24:16.960 --> 3:24:21.680]  testicles of rats that were fed regular soy the testicles of rats that were fed regular soy were
[3:24:21.680 --> 3:24:28.960]  pink those that were fed gem soy were blue a completely different color they showed she showed
[3:24:28.960 --> 3:24:35.520]  slides of the cells they were completely different structure in mice in italy they were fed genetically
[3:24:35.520 --> 3:24:40.720]  engineered soy from a different group they looked under an electron microscope and found damage in
[3:24:40.720 --> 3:24:45.760]  the small and in the in the young sperm cells associated with the mice that were fed genetically
[3:24:45.760 --> 3:24:51.440]  engineered soy they looked into the dna or the cells of the embryos from the offspring of mice
[3:24:51.440 --> 3:24:56.720]  that were fed gem soy and they function differently there's a temporary disruption in the production
[3:24:56.720 --> 3:25:03.200]  of rna from the dna in these mice compared to when the mothers were and fathers were fed non-gm soy
[3:25:03.200 --> 3:25:10.000]  now let's we fast forward to last month and mice that were fed corn that was genetically engineered
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:15.920]  also showed infertility issues and damage in the offspring now we look at what's happened in
[3:25:15.920 --> 3:25:22.240]  iowa and around the world around the country a few years ago when certain varieties of genetically
[3:25:22.240 --> 3:25:29.520]  engineered corn appeared to be causing sterility in pigs and cowl i talked to one farmer jerry
[3:25:29.520 --> 3:25:34.800]  roseman and he said you know he tried everything couldn't figure out what was going on and then
[3:25:34.800 --> 3:25:39.920]  he found some other people that also had sterility and their pigs and it turns out they were feeding
[3:25:39.920 --> 3:25:45.840]  the same genetically engineered corn so he went to the company garst and said your corn they went
[3:25:45.840 --> 3:25:51.040]  as a group to the all three of them and said your corn may be causing our pigs to become sterile
[3:25:51.040 --> 3:25:57.520]  so they gave him a sample of corn and they the garst never got back to him so they had uh one
[3:25:57.520 --> 3:26:01.520]  of the garst reps called the headquarters and he said you're never going to believe is jeffrey
[3:26:01.520 --> 3:26:06.240]  that jerry they lost your sample so they claimed that they lost the sample and so jerry called
[3:26:06.240 --> 3:26:11.520]  them back to don't worry i've been saving 20 000 bushels of corn to do research on you're welcome
[3:26:11.520 --> 3:26:16.800]  to come to get more and they never did when he hit the papers a year later garst immediately went
[3:26:16.800 --> 3:26:21.600]  on television and the radio and papers and said we've done our studies and it wasn't the corn
[3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:27.360]  the same study that's supposedly on this missing sample every time it was it was broadcast on radio
[3:26:27.360 --> 3:26:33.040]  television or newspaper or magazine jerry would get more calls from more farmers that said you know
[3:26:33.040 --> 3:26:40.160]  i'm having the same problem he no one was able no one was willing to do the research on his corn
[3:26:40.160 --> 3:26:46.240]  to see if that was causing the problem in fact supposedly a usda or a university group was going
[3:26:46.240 --> 3:26:50.880]  to get together and try and create a study that was specifically designed to disprove
[3:26:50.880 --> 3:26:54.640]  that it was the corn because they weren't even going to test his corn well he had to do his own
[3:26:54.640 --> 3:27:00.640]  study and he took his own corn and he fed it to his his cows and his bulls and immediately
[3:27:00.640 --> 3:27:08.400]  they got sterile also and and there's more well this is this is the biggest story let's come back
[3:27:08.400 --> 3:27:15.200]  in our final segment with you jeffrey smith and again talk about the proliferation of all of
[3:27:15.200 --> 3:27:20.480]  these systems and and how we stop it and of course humans are also becoming sterile or infertile
[3:27:21.200 --> 3:27:26.640]  right in line with the other mammals that are eating this ladies and gentlemen this is by
[3:27:26.640 --> 3:27:33.760]  design making a mistake i'm gonna talk to him behind scenes right now hey jeffrey
[3:27:34.640 --> 3:27:39.040]  yeah we're still on the internet but i just wanted to have i do this now with total transparency
[3:27:39.040 --> 3:27:44.640]  on the show uh you know i know we cut you short today because we had some producer issues with
[3:27:44.640 --> 3:27:50.560]  some mix ups as we tend to have had murphy's law with you normally said anybody else uh but uh so
[3:27:50.560 --> 3:27:54.720]  you were going to be on for two hours and it was an hour and a half i got behind on some news i've
[3:27:54.720 --> 3:27:58.880]  got to cover someone let you go a little bit after 40 after i know you're very prestigious and very
[3:27:58.880 --> 3:28:03.680]  very busy but but but i would like to really give you a chance to roll uh and i think i've been doing
[3:28:03.680 --> 3:28:07.600]  a decent job of trying to control myself not budding and they're just this is so riveting and
[3:28:07.600 --> 3:28:12.320]  so earth shaking and so important you're doing well thank you do you have your book in front of
[3:28:12.320 --> 3:28:16.640]  you because i would like to set you up again for an hour and a half but really keep you an hour
[3:28:16.640 --> 3:28:21.040]  and a half not cut your time next week or the week after next before christmas do you have some time
[3:28:21.040 --> 3:28:27.600]  uh it's possible i'm leaving for india on the 16th so i don't have i do have some time at the end
[3:28:27.600 --> 3:28:32.080]  of next week yeah let's not let's not wait do you have your book in front of you how about um
[3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:39.920]  let me see who do i have on i have somebody on uh i have somebody on um not next friday what about
[3:28:39.920 --> 3:28:45.120]  friday again i do have somebody on on the some similar subject thursday what about friday friday
[3:28:45.120 --> 3:28:52.320]  the 12th friday the 12th yes sir and i'm live from 11 to 3 central noon to four eastern all right
[3:28:52.320 --> 3:28:57.760]  i'm free friday the 12th okay what time would you like to do it uh you pick the best time and i'll be
[3:28:57.760 --> 3:29:04.720]  there uh what time zone are you in i'm in central okay 11 works because 11 works because we've never
[3:29:04.720 --> 3:29:09.120]  done 11 so maybe a different audience it is so we have different stations uh yeah okay let's do an
[3:29:09.120 --> 3:29:24.720]  hour and a half then let's go from 11 20 to 12 50 all right 11 20 to 12 50 jeff smith will you
[3:29:24.720 --> 3:29:28.240]  get that in the book because my producer's not right now i've got uh john in there right on the
[3:29:28.240 --> 3:29:32.160]  show and paul around the show though they'll get that in there okay when we come back i want to
[3:29:32.160 --> 3:29:37.360]  ask you the big question so don't start answering it now all right for humanity i mean i mean they
[3:29:37.360 --> 3:29:41.280]  get you know poor immigrants and then foster children and people that really don't know what's
[3:29:41.280 --> 3:29:46.400]  happening but but frankly i mean i would almost do it for humanity and i don't have some bleeding
[3:29:46.400 --> 3:29:51.200]  heart syndrome this is so evil you know as a warrior as a man i have this i have this desire
[3:29:51.200 --> 3:29:56.560]  this inbred genetics to to defend the tribe my human species i know that i would probably and i've
[3:29:56.560 --> 3:30:02.160]  never been in a medical test but i guess you'd have to do it uh because humans have a longer
[3:30:02.160 --> 3:30:06.480]  span than rats obviously one of the main reasons they use rodents because the span's so much quicker
[3:30:06.480 --> 3:30:12.560]  to look at it and similar to humans but but but but quicker we need to have people but i guess you
[3:30:12.560 --> 3:30:17.280]  can't do it because it would have to be young and they haven't consented how do we do human studies
[3:30:17.280 --> 3:30:22.560]  of this i know we can do studies with populations that have been eating gmo uh versus those that
[3:30:22.560 --> 3:30:26.960]  haven't but then they'll try to muck them up and claim it's not well answer that question because
[3:30:26.960 --> 3:30:32.160]  we need human studies i know we have a lot of human data uh but uh because it hasn't been controlled
[3:30:32.160 --> 3:30:36.240]  uh it's uh you know they could try to put but there's obviously no doubt so we're gonna ask
[3:30:36.240 --> 3:30:40.800]  that question now and then the big issue of stopping them now at the gates you know only the
[3:30:40.800 --> 3:30:44.080]  four staples right now have this they're trying to move into everything here we go
[3:30:44.080 --> 3:30:53.680]  so
[3:30:53.680 --> 3:31:02.880]  cyrus jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great grandchildren believe you could live to 103
[3:31:04.720 --> 3:31:08.320]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid
[3:31:08.320 --> 3:31:19.440]  so cyrus jones live forever i would volunteer grave digger for when you dig my a study
[3:31:20.640 --> 3:31:27.600]  would you make a shallow of eating gmo for several years and watching my sperm count dropped to
[3:31:27.600 --> 3:31:33.440]  nothing i've seen the studies testicles shriveling everything people can laugh at that this is life
[3:31:33.440 --> 3:31:39.040]  and death folks this is in a game you can't do it with a young because they can't opt in
[3:31:40.000 --> 3:31:46.320]  how do we do controlled studies on humans i know there are volunteers who want to save humanity
[3:31:46.320 --> 3:31:53.440]  from this the genetics of sterilization of mammals is getting out of the open air cross species
[3:31:53.440 --> 3:31:59.120]  naturally into other food crops as you know jeffrey answering those questions how do we get human
[3:31:59.120 --> 3:32:04.000]  studies what human data do we have from populations that have been eating gmo the west is where the
[3:32:04.000 --> 3:32:07.040]  sperm counts are dropping where we do eat it i mean i think that's evidence right there but
[3:32:07.040 --> 3:32:12.720]  i mean you understand the the wide question right there's actually three or four questions
[3:32:12.720 --> 3:32:17.280]  embedded in that first of all what kind of evidence do we have from human studies that have already
[3:32:17.280 --> 3:32:23.440]  done been done and there's only been one human feeding study and it showed that genes that are
[3:32:23.440 --> 3:32:29.920]  inserted into into genetically engineered soil in this case transferred into the dna of the bacteria
[3:32:29.920 --> 3:32:34.880]  living inside our intestines and continue to produce these genetically engineered protein
[3:32:34.880 --> 3:32:40.480]  long after the person that stopped eating the gm soybean now this means that if we eat genetically
[3:32:40.480 --> 3:32:46.000]  engineered corn chips genetically engineered to produce the pesticide called bt if that also
[3:32:46.000 --> 3:32:50.800]  were to transfer to our bacteria inside our intestines it might turn into living pesticide
[3:32:50.800 --> 3:32:59.360]  factories possibly for the rest of our lives now if it does disrupt the gut bacteria which
[3:32:59.360 --> 3:33:06.480]  is involved in immune defense and our end digestion and protecting against intrusions
[3:33:06.480 --> 3:33:12.480]  into the blood then we would end up seeing digestive problems allergies immune problems
[3:33:12.480 --> 3:33:16.880]  gut leaky gut and other things which is what we're seeing when i give talks to medical
[3:33:16.880 --> 3:33:21.520]  medical groups they say you know we've seen a lot of gastrointestinal problems maybe this gene
[3:33:21.520 --> 3:33:27.200]  transfer example crones didn't exist 50 years ago now it's prolific somebody in my office has
[3:33:27.200 --> 3:33:31.760]  got it every time they eat gmo they have to only eat it whole foods every time they don't eat gmo
[3:33:31.760 --> 3:33:37.040]  they have to go to the hospital just just people's guts are disintegrating and they use crones and
[3:33:37.040 --> 3:33:43.840]  other names as ketchels so it certainly could be gmo related now in terms of what's been happening
[3:33:43.840 --> 3:33:49.520]  to the population associated with gmo's there's very little surveillance in fact health candidate
[3:33:49.520 --> 3:33:54.320]  said that they would actually do monitoring of the canadian citizens to see if eating gmo's
[3:33:54.320 --> 3:33:59.280]  was going to cause problems and within a year they do abandon the study saying was too difficult
[3:33:59.280 --> 3:34:05.680]  we do know that soon after gm soy was introduced to the uk soy allergies skyrocketed by 50 percent
[3:34:05.680 --> 3:34:11.760]  there's many reasons why that may be the case due to it genetically engineered soy now uh so you
[3:34:11.760 --> 3:34:17.520]  can't we can't particularly look at the at the whole issues of the united states in terms of
[3:34:17.520 --> 3:34:24.000]  the statistics we see migraines going up we see you know low birth weight uh going up we see allergies
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:29.200]  going up we see gastrointestinal problems going up these certainly might have a contributor
[3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:34.000]  and the genetically engineered crops but in terms of how do we actually do studies on gmo's with
[3:34:34.000 --> 3:34:40.080]  humans we know when we put a drug on the market there's a four phase clinical trial you do clinical
[3:34:40.080 --> 3:34:45.200]  trials you do post marketing surveillance you do you know uh a thick population you do a healthy
[3:34:45.200 --> 3:34:52.640]  population there's a whole protocol that's never been done with gmo's and gmo's offer a special
[3:34:52.640 --> 3:34:58.480]  problem because it's not a particular chemical that's always the same when you test it they are
[3:34:58.480 --> 3:35:05.040]  actually living organisms that change dramatically as a result of the process of genetic engineering
[3:35:05.040 --> 3:35:09.840]  and so therefore the levels of toxins or allergens and whatnot might be completely different
[3:35:09.840 --> 3:35:15.760]  if it's grown in one climate versus another or picked at a different time or happens to be a
[3:35:15.760 --> 3:35:22.240]  different subspecies within that particular plant so you really can't do a properly controlled study
[3:35:22.240 --> 3:35:28.000]  with genetically engineered organisms they typically grow it under ideal conditions
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:32.960]  and then the other thing that they do is they isolate the the the ingredients that's been
[3:35:32.960 --> 3:35:39.440]  produced by the inserted gene and just use that in their animal feeding studies but you see the whole
[3:35:39.440 --> 3:35:44.240]  plant is different when you're genetically engineered two to four percent of the dna is different
[3:35:44.240 --> 3:35:50.080]  hundreds of thousands of mutations are lined up and down the dna any of those any one of which
[3:35:50.080 --> 3:35:55.280]  can cause a deadly toxin or carcinogen and it's never tested for when they put these things on
[3:35:55.280 --> 3:36:02.080]  the market so right now we don't have a proper testing protocol but what we do have is a bunch
[3:36:02.080 --> 3:36:08.640]  of the false assumptions that allow these industry funded studies that basically test nothing to be
[3:36:08.640 --> 3:36:13.600]  rubber stamped by regulatory agencies around the world and then put into our food supply
[3:36:13.600 --> 3:36:17.600]  where then what actually first they put into the environment where cross pollinate
[3:36:17.600 --> 3:36:22.000]  and the self-propagating genetic pollution can easily outlast the effects of global warming
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:26.400]  and nuclear waste and then they put it in our food where they're feeding the products of this
[3:36:26.400 --> 3:36:33.440]  infant science to millions of people so it's a huge uncontrolled experiment which can be devastating
[3:36:33.440 --> 3:36:39.520]  to the health and life of the population and maybe already had and the way to get rid of it
[3:36:39.520 --> 3:36:45.280]  the rate of stop it it turns out to be easier to stop than any of the most most many of the big
[3:36:45.280 --> 3:36:50.640]  problems are facing we think that as little as five percent of us shoppers us consumers
[3:36:50.640 --> 3:36:56.800]  15 million people conscientiously avoiding brands that can change gm ingredients by avoiding them
[3:36:56.800 --> 3:37:01.680]  it turns it creates these products which carry no consumer benefit there's no advantage to using
[3:37:01.680 --> 3:37:07.760]  gmo's by these food companies if they see they're losing market share we can plunge we can easily
[3:37:07.760 --> 3:37:11.840]  get them to remove it jeffrey we need that many people jeffrey i'm going to let you go because
[3:37:11.840 --> 3:37:19.280]  again i got behind the day you have agreed graciously to join us coming up and that is of
[3:37:19.280 --> 3:37:28.240]  course uh next friday at 11 20 central standard time for a little bit over an hour and so we
[3:37:28.240 --> 3:37:32.960]  look forward well actually it'll be about an hour and 30 minute interview to to continue to break
[3:37:32.960 --> 3:37:38.800]  down the facts giving people the sources i would point people at info wars dot com uh in the alex
[3:37:38.800 --> 3:37:46.640]  jones recommend sections of books and videos uh to get the gmo a video an audio trilogy for 1995
[3:37:46.640 --> 3:37:53.120]  and the other books that are excellent uh that uh you have written so uh in summation though just
[3:37:53.120 --> 3:38:00.960]  spend about two minutes if you can please serve uh specifically explaining the latest numbers
[3:38:00.960 --> 3:38:07.600]  i know they're always changing how many staple crops uh have it uh and then and then how they're
[3:38:07.600 --> 3:38:13.920]  trying to roll it out basically into everything i mean i've read even tea even different uh
[3:38:13.920 --> 3:38:19.920]  essential oil plants just basically strawberries i mean everything and and so this is a make it
[3:38:19.920 --> 3:38:25.680]  or break it it's already at at armageddon level and then they're about to go you know two alphas
[3:38:25.680 --> 3:38:31.920]  and turries uh at warp speed right so there's eight commercialized genetically engineered
[3:38:31.920 --> 3:38:37.840]  crops for food uh the four major ones that have been in our diet for years and years are soy
[3:38:37.840 --> 3:38:45.120]  corn cotton seed and canola oil there's also hawaiian papaya and a little bit of zucchini
[3:38:45.120 --> 3:38:51.760]  and crookneck squash starting this year just harvested will be sugar from genetically engineered
[3:38:51.760 --> 3:38:57.200]  sugar beet and also for the first time in our diet yellow uh white corn it used to be just
[3:38:57.200 --> 3:39:02.080]  yellow corn but a little bit of white of white corn has also been introduced this year there's
[3:39:02.080 --> 3:39:08.720]  been between 100 and 200 different species i've heard the number 173 different species that have
[3:39:08.720 --> 3:39:14.160]  been field trials around the world including 50 000 different field trials in the united states
[3:39:14.160 --> 3:39:18.880]  now these are species that have been that are experimental that have not yet been introduced
[3:39:18.880 --> 3:39:25.200]  into our food supply that are awaiting approval there's also genetically engineered salmon
[3:39:25.200 --> 3:39:30.800]  that wants that the company wants to introduce that and the fda may fast track rules that allow
[3:39:30.800 --> 3:39:36.320]  approvals of that salmon before obama steps in and there's also even a even a company that
[3:39:36.320 --> 3:39:41.280]  wants to introduce genetically engineered insects and eventually mosquitoes and so imagine trying
[3:39:41.280 --> 3:39:47.440]  to do a recall there now what we've identified with genetically engineered crops are a long list of
[3:39:47.440 --> 3:39:53.760]  derivatives particularly of the soy and corn that they don't carry the name soy or corn in them but
[3:39:53.760 --> 3:39:59.680]  you have to know that they're created primarily from soy or corn like uh multidextrin and dextrose
[3:39:59.680 --> 3:40:06.080]  and things we've got that list on responsible technology dot org sign up for the campaign for
[3:40:06.080 --> 3:40:10.240]  healthier eating in america you can either be a free member or you can be a donating member
[3:40:10.240 --> 3:40:15.600]  you can you can get all sorts of information you can sign up for a free syndicated monthly column
[3:40:15.600 --> 3:40:21.200]  which you can also go on my blog at huffington post we want to keep people aware as this moves
[3:40:21.200 --> 3:40:27.280]  forward not only with what to avoid but what steps people can take yes sir and and i want folks to
[3:40:27.280 --> 3:40:32.560]  make a commitment because you know they the social engineers know that we habitualize using a cell
[3:40:32.560 --> 3:40:36.960]  phone that radiates our brain thousands of studies we habitualize drinking out of cheap plastics
[3:40:36.960 --> 3:40:42.480]  with the endocrine disruptors leaching out of them we habitualize ourself uh smoking we habitualize
[3:40:42.480 --> 3:40:48.000]  ourselves to the gmo which is far worse as you know the study show than even smoking so so of
[3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:54.160]  course you're not going to have gmo uh tobacco so they are moving into every level now is the time
[3:40:54.160 --> 3:40:58.000]  we have to habitualize you know it's like getting in shape not that i'm good at that you have to
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:02.400]  totally commit to it and make it your life or you can't just do it halfway there are no half
[3:41:02.400 --> 3:41:07.760]  measures this is the biggest issue out there overall for health for our society for our world
[3:41:07.760 --> 3:41:13.520]  and this gmo revolution is so wild now and so dangerous we've got to put the genie back in
[3:41:13.520 --> 3:41:18.320]  the bottle and i just want to commend you and thank you for all your work and we'll talk to you next
[3:41:18.320 --> 3:41:23.840]  friday coming up in seven days sir great see that alex thank you take care uh and by the way i would
[3:41:23.840 --> 3:41:28.480]  add folks if you don't want to buy the dvd uh the world according to monsanto it's on google video
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:35.920]  it's on youtube so but i would buy it from them and just and uh go to uh monsantofilm.com and
[3:41:35.920 --> 3:41:39.840]  and just get this sucker i'm not selling it we just we just bought something we'll be soon but
[3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:43.600]  so later you get it at info wars.com you're watching this on you know prisonplanet.tv in a
[3:41:43.600 --> 3:41:48.560]  few weeks but and we need money i mean you send us money you buy our videos our books our materials
[3:41:48.560 --> 3:41:54.080]  we'll just have more guests on and warn people and do more radio shows and do everything we can
[3:41:54.080 --> 3:41:58.560]  here to fight it let me tell you i feel good fighting the new world order i feel really good uh fighting
[3:41:58.560 --> 3:42:02.480]  the new world order uh on prisonplanet.tv i will give you the image of tarpoli he'll be with us the
[3:42:02.480 --> 3:42:07.520]  last 12 minutes or so uh popping in to finish up on the move by uh situation he was with us for the
[3:42:07.520 --> 3:42:13.920]  first um first uh hour or so uh today that's about to rebroadcast at info wars.com or re-stream
[3:42:13.920 --> 3:42:18.080]  retransmit one of my pet pieces people calling internet broadcasting which is wonderful in

[3:44:39.360 --> 3:44:45.200]  webster griffin tarpoli for round two we ran out of time and we covered obama we covered the queen
[3:44:45.200 --> 3:44:50.000]  taking over canada today uh yes it's in roiders we're not kidding showing she rules when it finally
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:54.480]  comes down to her being thrown out she says i rule boom parliament you're gone uh huge so when that
[3:44:54.480 --> 3:44:59.600]  re so when we rebroadcast coming up you'll hear that the first hour we got into moon by you've got
[3:44:59.600 --> 3:45:05.920]  the floor break down why this is a clear intelligence operation well it's the uh obama policy of
[3:45:05.920 --> 3:45:12.560]  bashing pakistan dividing it into uh five or six parts member was iristan sinned punja balochistan
[3:45:12.560 --> 3:45:19.360]  poshtunistan and and and more and more the immediate framework the u.s. indian nuclear deal so the u.s.
[3:45:19.360 --> 3:45:24.080]  has a nuclear alliance with india on the other side the urgency to get out there and stop the
[3:45:24.080 --> 3:45:30.080]  pakistani chinese alliance which is building up you've also got that they were getting friendly
[3:45:30.080 --> 3:45:36.080]  making deals for the first time in decades just magically so that's got to be stopped the other
[3:45:36.080 --> 3:45:41.200]  thing is the pakistani military fed up with the constant obama policy because obama is the one
[3:45:41.200 --> 3:45:46.240]  who demanded it the bombing and killing of pakistani civilians by these predator drones in
[3:45:46.240 --> 3:45:50.560]  the northwest area i mean imagine suppose they came around here start killing people you'd get
[3:45:50.560 --> 3:45:56.080]  your your backup pretty soon so the pakistani military had cut the supply line at least once
[3:45:56.080 --> 3:46:00.800]  saying look you want to get your truck convoy up into uh afghanistan we're stopping it no
[3:46:00.800 --> 3:46:05.680]  trucks for the next two or three days so this was a big shock for the anglo americans and and
[3:46:05.680 --> 3:46:11.840]  for nato and finally gates gates in position at the pentagon now i just founder of al-qaeda founder
[3:46:11.840 --> 3:46:18.800]  of al-qaeda part of the conspiracy to take the hostages in iran and part of the october surprise
[3:46:18.800 --> 3:46:24.240]  so as dirty as as can be uh and this guy's now confirmed that this is the the new face of hope
[3:46:24.240 --> 3:46:30.400]  and change is robert gates now i would say it's five or six components in the in the in the patsy
[3:46:30.400 --> 3:46:36.880]  operation because this is obviously false flag the british colonial power with uh british
[3:46:36.880 --> 3:46:42.720]  british presence reported people from brickston moske vincebury moske british prisons leads
[3:46:42.720 --> 3:46:48.480]  yorkshire whatever it is the us the cia outpost in the federally administered tribal areas
[3:46:48.480 --> 3:46:54.720]  recruiting patsy's recruiting terrorists there the israelis big israeli india special relation
[3:46:54.720 --> 3:47:01.920]  general miss rahi's visit to uh uh the uh jamun kashmir very very it's that's a little bit like
[3:47:01.920 --> 3:47:06.800]  charon going on the temple mount something like this right big provocation get them all riled up
[3:47:07.680 --> 3:47:11.520]  there's also the fact that the israelis are apparently training indian special forces which
[3:47:11.520 --> 3:47:18.800]  may be why they did such a poor job then you get into the raw right the raw story the research
[3:47:18.800 --> 3:47:24.400]  and analysis wing the indian intelligence intelligence organization everybody knows
[3:47:24.400 --> 3:47:30.720]  the isi they've been demonized u.s media have never talked about the raw r a w raw deal is what
[3:47:30.720 --> 3:47:36.320]  you're going to get from them and they're into going into afghanistan picking up crazies there
[3:47:36.320 --> 3:47:41.920]  mujahideen whether they are taliban fighters and getting them into pakistan so that they can
[3:47:41.920 --> 3:47:46.800]  essentially wage armed civil war against the pakistani government so those guys are terrorists
[3:47:46.800 --> 3:47:52.880]  but not the way you'd normally think now the raw leads us then to this world of hindu terrorism
[3:47:52.880 --> 3:47:58.640]  and this is very very big u.s media never interested in this stuff happens every week but you
[3:47:59.120 --> 3:48:02.400]  happens every week but you never hear about it in particular the guy that you're mentioning
[3:48:02.400 --> 3:48:08.960]  right i think this guy kakare kakare the anti-terrorism boss of mumbai i think is a hero of our time
[3:48:08.960 --> 3:48:14.800]  who busted a hindu extremist group army captain really staging the last train bombing blaming
[3:48:14.800 --> 3:48:18.400]  it on muslims so he goes in there with his commanders they all get killed in the first
[3:48:18.400 --> 3:48:23.120]  minute it's clear that there were snipers who were given the specific task of eliminating kakare
[3:48:23.120 --> 3:48:27.040]  and three four five of his closest because he'd been on the news saying the government staging
[3:48:27.040 --> 3:48:32.640]  the terror saying in particular that this was being done through hindu patsy's not islamic
[3:48:32.640 --> 3:48:36.720]  but hindu patsy this is a big thing there's a whole world of hindu terrorism that they want to
[3:48:36.720 --> 3:48:42.240]  deny and he's killed during the melee hold on let's continue i'm gonna skip this three years
[3:48:42.240 --> 3:48:46.160]  though i'm skipping this one too again just for internet audience will come back and finish up
[3:48:46.880 --> 3:48:52.560]  you've got three minutes to flesh out okay the head of anti-terrorism saying it was a government
[3:48:52.560 --> 3:48:57.920]  op in the days before and then they kill him and then we go back to booker's okay so this is kakare
[3:48:57.920 --> 3:49:06.800]  now he had been investigating the malagon massacre the malagon massacre 2006 37 dead and he had been
[3:49:06.800 --> 3:49:11.760]  saying look it's not clear that these were muslims it's not clear that these were pakistanis at all
[3:49:11.760 --> 3:49:16.000]  it looks to me more like it's this world of hindu and he bust the army terrorism he bust the army
[3:49:16.000 --> 3:49:23.760]  captain and the the the bjp candidate the basically the shadow prime minister of the bjp the hindu
[3:49:24.480 --> 3:49:29.600]  nationalists i guess had come out saying this guy should be fired there were calls to fire and he
[3:49:29.600 --> 3:49:34.800]  was getting killed right so now in the middle of this event it looks like there's a special team
[3:49:34.800 --> 3:49:39.120]  that has only one task which is to kill him because they knew that he would be in the front rank
[3:49:39.120 --> 3:49:43.360]  of the people doing something about it where whereas the other indian forces i mean i want to
[3:49:43.360 --> 3:49:47.920]  warn good people i don't want to warn good cops and good fbi like john o'neill who they kill in
[3:49:47.920 --> 3:49:52.960]  9 11 and threw in the building every time we see an op even waco some cops exposing clinton
[3:49:52.960 --> 3:49:58.240]  that had been uh state police exposing him who'd gotten a batf job you see the batf go in the window
[3:49:58.240 --> 3:50:02.960]  when they climb in and they shoot their own men so they love to use operations to kill their own
[3:50:02.960 --> 3:50:07.760]  people inside the operation to tie up loose ends go ahead and this this brings us to the to the world
[3:50:07.760 --> 3:50:13.440]  of of uh where do you get hindu terrorists again this bjp is the governing party they'll probably
[3:50:13.440 --> 3:50:19.200]  be back in power soon but then there's this other thing called the rss hindu extreme
[3:50:19.200 --> 3:50:24.560]  nationalists racists hindu superiority ones that killed gandhi because he wouldn't because he wouldn't
[3:50:24.560 --> 3:50:29.440]  go to war with muslims and i guess the shorthand for this would be hindu fascism and what we're
[3:50:29.440 --> 3:50:35.040]  getting you see obama is attracting a kind of a fascist international made up of the lunatic
[3:50:35.040 --> 3:50:41.200]  sakashvili polish and ukrainian extremists and now we're getting hindu fascists becoming
[3:50:41.200 --> 3:50:46.880]  the great friends of the united states and your future is going to be hostage to a bunch of hindu
[3:50:46.880 --> 3:50:52.560]  fascists under the indian us nuclear deal and that's what this guy kakari was a threat to that
[3:50:52.560 --> 3:50:56.960]  because he didn't just kill him they killed four other chiefs his whole staff they wiped his whole
[3:50:56.960 --> 3:51:03.040]  team out in separate groups they're all picked out and triple tapped in the chest right so uh
[3:51:03.040 --> 3:51:08.160]  the therefore the notion the indian government says we know who did it it was lashkar el-taiba
[3:51:08.160 --> 3:51:13.920]  well that's a that's a muslim group or you know basically a patsy group operating and that's
[3:51:13.920 --> 3:51:17.680]  and that's trying to kill the pakistani government they're bombing them and they get tremendous
[3:51:17.680 --> 3:51:20.960]  support from the u.s. and the british and that's that's also well known because that's part of
[3:51:20.960 --> 3:51:25.760]  so why would pakistan control a group is trying to kill them and why would they why would they do
[3:51:25.760 --> 3:51:29.840]  this at all what what what does why when they're doing peace overtures and have every reason to
[3:51:29.840 --> 3:51:34.640]  be friends with india and they're what they're trying to do is to say look let's build the oil
[3:51:34.640 --> 3:51:38.960]  pipeline from iran to pakistan to india let's finish up and then we get a common interest
[3:51:38.960 --> 3:51:45.280]  we're coming back with where you see all this going here we go
[3:51:48.240 --> 3:51:51.280]  final segment i'll be live this sunday from four to six p.m.

[3:53:00.400 --> 3:53:04.240]  okay that said webster uh... you got about three and a half minutes go ahead and finish up with
[3:53:04.240 --> 3:53:09.520]  where this is going well it's going to be a new phase of world confrontation cd the anglo-american
[3:53:09.520 --> 3:53:13.920]  empire is collapsing financially everybody can see this right what's going on in london
[3:53:13.920 --> 3:53:19.360]  and above all new york is a total financial collapse we seem to be in a phase of deflation and
[3:53:19.360 --> 3:53:24.320]  strength of the dollar but i think this is an illusion and it's only a passing phase it's because
[3:53:24.320 --> 3:53:28.720]  a lot of people are trying to deleverage they're trying to pay down debt which is largely dollar
[3:53:28.720 --> 3:53:33.520]  denominated that everybody's dumping their assets right now right so there's a glut of all commodities
[3:53:33.520 --> 3:53:38.160]  the hedge funds are in liquidation more everybody's selling selling selling to try to get dollars to
[3:53:38.160 --> 3:53:44.640]  pay off debt so you don't go bankrupt but with this seven trillion and some odd injected
[3:53:44.640 --> 3:53:49.600]  we can i think look forward to a phase of hyperinflation in two thousand and nine in
[3:53:49.600 --> 3:53:54.960]  the woods we're going through a valley of deflation we had hyperinflation already clearly beginning
[3:53:54.960 --> 3:53:59.360]  in july august with the oil price you know up to a house in the depression of main street in
[3:53:59.360 --> 3:54:04.240]  a real economy they will now soon be an overlay of hyperinflation right so phase of deflation
[3:54:04.240 --> 3:54:10.480]  hyperstack inflation actually yes exactly the worst of both hyperinflationary depression
[3:54:10.480 --> 3:54:14.720]  hyperstackflation we're going to need a new term you're exactly right and that and that's what we
[3:54:14.720 --> 3:54:21.760]  should do so the point is now when the anglo-american banking system and currency collapses the entire
[3:54:21.760 --> 3:54:26.560]  anglo-american ruling elite goes nuts and that's what we saw with the queen the queen is expressing
[3:54:26.560 --> 3:54:31.440]  that her her oligarchy over there and not happy campers they're going nuts because they've got
[3:54:31.440 --> 3:54:36.960]  northern rock they've got gordon brown allister dawling at the exchequer and mervyn king at the
[3:54:36.960 --> 3:54:40.400]  bank really trying to keep this thing together they can't do it so they say we've got to have
[3:54:40.400 --> 3:54:44.880]  outside events and that's what rand said as you know a month ago and this pub was all over far
[3:54:44.880 --> 3:54:50.160]  and press ran corporation said we need a war bigger than iraq bigger than iran we need something
[3:54:50.160 --> 3:54:56.640]  of world war proportions and obama says it's going to be pakistan and remember that brzezinski
[3:54:56.640 --> 3:55:00.400]  is the big power at rand in other words if there's a bleeding ideologue of the rand corporation
[3:55:00.400 --> 3:55:04.400]  it's it's big my god so they're gonna who knows what they're gonna do so now look that what we got
[3:55:04.400 --> 3:55:10.560]  us british and israel against the world was bad enough but now it's us britain israel
[3:55:11.120 --> 3:55:17.280]  plus india most likely plus georgia that's not much but that's showing india never really got
[3:55:17.280 --> 3:55:22.080]  away from england the crown is showing its power again yeah it's it's oligarchy the oligarchy
[3:55:22.080 --> 3:55:26.720]  unfortunately is based in the religion that's an unfortunate fact but then the british occupation
[3:55:26.720 --> 3:55:33.040]  but now in addition to georgia ukraine split but but uh yushenko wants to go with the u.s and the
[3:55:33.040 --> 3:55:40.000]  british and the imf and nato poland reliable nato puppet latvia lithuania estonia and we're headed
[3:55:40.000 --> 3:55:45.920]  into a polish missile crisis and there will be an attempt to cut the russian gas deliveries from
[3:55:45.920 --> 3:55:51.360]  russia into western europe they got to get an anti russian hysteria in europe and that'll be blamed
[3:55:51.360 --> 3:55:55.200]  on russia even though the west is talking about even though even though it'll be ukraine and poland
[3:55:55.200 --> 3:55:59.680]  cutting it off and stealing the gas for their own purposes and probably selling it and you
[3:55:59.680 --> 3:56:04.320]  got this thing about the collinian grad x-clave right this little piece of russia that's separate
[3:56:04.320 --> 3:56:09.040]  from the rest it's basically a east prussia kernik's bed yeah it's right out on the ocean so that's
